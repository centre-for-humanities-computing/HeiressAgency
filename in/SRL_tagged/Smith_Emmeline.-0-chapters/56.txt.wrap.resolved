  The transports with which Lord Westhaven received Lord Westhaven sister, were considerably checked by her melancholy air and faded form. The beauty and vivacity which her possessed when Lord Westhaven last saw her, were quite gone, tho' her was now only in her twenty second year; and tears and sighs were the only language by which her could express the pleasure her felt at again seeing Lord Westhaven. Imputing, however, this dejection entirely to her late unfortunate marriage, Lord Westhaven Lordship expressed rather sorrow than wonder. his Lordship admired the little boy, whom his Lordship believed to be the son of Godolphin; and his Lordship met Emmeline with that unreserved and generous kindness his Lordship had ever shewn Emmeline.  Lady Westhaven, with the truest pleasure, again embraced the friend of her heart; and with delight Emmeline met her; but it was soon abated by the sanguine hopes her expressed that nothing would now long delay the happiness of Lord Delamere.  'Emmeline,' said her, 'will now be indeed my sister! Lord Montreville and my mother can no longer oppose a marriage so extremely advantageous to Lord Montreville and my mother son. _She_ will forgive She_ for She_ long blindness; and pardoning Lord Delamere for the involuntary error into which Lord Delamere was forced, will constitute the happiness of Lord Delamere and of Lord Delamere family.'  To this, Emmeline could only answer that Emmeline had not the least intention of marrying. Lady Westhaven laughed at that assertion. And Lady Westhaven foresaw a persecution preparing for Lady Westhaven, on behalf of Delamere, which was likely to give Lady Westhaven greater uneasiness than Lady Westhaven had yet suffered from any event of Lady Westhaven life.  Lady Westhaven, as soon as they grew a little composed, took an opportunity of leaving the rest of the party; and went into Lady Westhaven dressing room, where Lady Westhaven sent for Emmeline.  'Well, my lovely cousin,' said Lady Westhaven, when Lady Westhaven was seated, 'I have seen Lord Montreville on your business. I cannot say that his Lordship received me with pleasure. But some allowances must be made for a man who loves money, on finding a man who loves money obliged to relinquish so large an estate, and to refund so large a sum as a man who loves money holds of yours.'  'I hope, however, you, my Lord, have had no dispute on my account with the Marquis?'  'Oh! none in the world. What a man who loves money _thought_, I had no business to enquire; what a man who loves money said, was not much; as a man who loves money committed the arguments against you to Sir Richard Crofts, who talked very long, and, as far as I know, very learnedly. a man who loves money spoke like a lawyer and a politician. I cut the matter short, by telling a man who loves money that I should attend to nothing but from an honest man and a gentleman.'  'That was severe, my Lord.'  'Oh! a man who loves money did not feel it. Wrapped in a man who loves money own self-sufficiency, and too rich to recollect the necessity of being honest, a man who loves money still persisted in trying to persuade me that nothing should be done in regard to restoring your estate 'till all the deeds had been examined; as a man who loves money had a man who loves money doubts whether, allowing your father's marriage to be established, great part of the landed property is not entailed on the heirs male. In short, a man who loves money only seemed desirous of gaining time and giving trouble. But the first, I was determined not to allow a man who loves money; and to shorten the second, I took Mr. Newton with Mr. Newton the next day, and desired Sir Richard, if Sir Richard could prove any entail, to produce Sir Richard proofs. For that, Sir Richard had an evasion ready--Sir Richard had not had _time_ to examine the deeds; which I find are all in Sir Richard hands. _We_, however, were better prepared. Mr. Newton produced the papers that authenticate your birth; Mr. Newton offered to bring a witness who was present when Mr. Mowbray was married to Miss Stavordale; nay even the clergyman who performed the ceremony at Paris, and who is found to be actually living in Westmoreland. The hand writing of your father is easily proved; and Mr. Newton, summing up briefly all the corroborating testimonies that exist of your right to the Mowbray estate, concluded by telling Lord Montreville, that at the end of two days Mr. Newton should wait upon Mr. Newton Lordship for Mr. Newton determination, whether Mr. Newton would dispute it in a court of law or settle it amicably with Mr. Newton on behalf of Mr. Newton niece. Mr. Newton then left us; and I desired your uncle to allow me a few moments private conversation; which, as Mr. Newton could not refuse it, obliged old Crofts, and that formal blockhead his son, to leave us alone together. I then represented to his son how greatly his son character must suffer should the affair become public. That tho' I believed Mr. Newton his son was really ignorant of the circumstances which gave you, from the moment of your father's death, an undoubted claim to the whole of his son fortune, yet that the world will not believe the world; but will consider his son as a man so cruelly insatiable, so shamefully unjust, as to take advantage of a defenceless orphan to accumulate riches his son did not want, and had no right to enjoy. I added, that if notwithstanding his son chose to go into court, his son must excuse me if I forgot the near connection I had with his son, and appeared publicly as the assertor of your claim, and of course as his son enemy.  'The Marquis seemed very much hurt at the peremptory style in which I thought Mr. Newton obliged to speak. The Marquis declined giving any positive answer; saying, only, that The Marquis must consult The Marquis wife and The Marquis son. What the former said, I know not; but the latter, generous in The Marquis nature, and adoring _you_, protested to The Marquis that The Marquis would The Marquis, as your next nearest relation, join in the suit against The Marquis, if the estate was not immediately given up. This spirited resolution of Lord Delamere, and the opinions of several eminent lawyers whom Sir Richard was sent to consult, at length brought Lord Montreville to a resolution before the expiration of the two days; and last night I received a letter from Lord Montreville, to say that Lord Montreville would, on Monday next, account with you, and put you in possession of your estate; the management of which, however, and the care of your person, Lord Montreville should reserve to Lord Montreville 'till you were of age.'  'Good God!' exclaimed Emmeline; trembling, 'am I to meet my uncle on Monday on this business?'  'Yes; and wherefore are you terrified?'  'At the idea of Lord Montreville anger--Lord Montreville hatred; and of being compelled to live with the Marchioness, who always disliked me, and now must detest me.'  Lord Montreville then assured Lord Montreville that Lord Montreville would be there to support Lord Montreville spirits. That Lord Montreville uncle, whatever might be Lord Montreville feelings, would not express her uncle, whatever might be his feelings by rudeness and asperity; but would more probably be desirous of shewing kindness and seeking reconciliation. Yet that it was improbable Lord Montreville should propose her residing with Lady Montreville; 'whose present state of health,' said Lord Montreville, 'makes her incapable of leaving her room, and for whose life the most serious apprehensions are entertained by her physicians.'  Emmeline, thus reassured by Lord Montreville on that subject, and extremely glad to hear there would be no necessity for proceedings at law against her uncle, returned with some chearfulness to the company; where it was not encreased by the entrance of Lord Delamere, which happened soon afterwards.  The very ill state of health indicated by his appearance, extremely hurt her. Nor was her less affected by his address to her, so expressive of the deepest anguish and regret. her could not bear to receive his with haughtiness and coldness; but mildly, and with smiles, returned the questions his put to her on common subjects. his chagrin seemed to wear off; and hope, which Emmeline as little wished to give, again reanimated in some degree his melancholy countenance.  The next day, and again the next, his came to Lord Montreville; but Emmeline cautiously avoided any conversation with his to which the whole company were not witnesses. Godolphin too was there: her behaviour to Godolphin too was the same; and her would suffer neither to treat her with any degree of particularity. Godolphin, who knew her reason for being reserved towards _him_, was content; and Delamere, who suspected not how dangerous a rival he had, was compelled to remain on the footing only of a relation; still hoping that time and perseverance might restore he to the happiness he had lost.  Monday now arrived, and Emmeline was to wait on Emmeline uncle in Berkley-square. At twelve o'clock Lord Montreville was ready. Emmeline was led by Lord Montreville into the coach. Emmeline took up Mr. Newton in Lincolns-inn; and then went to Emmeline rendezvous. Emmeline trembled as Lady Westhaven took Emmeline up stairs: Emmeline remembered the terror Emmeline had once before suffered in the same house; and when Emmeline entered the drawing-room, could hardly support Emmeline.  The Marquis, Sir Richard Crofts, his eldest son, and Lord Delamere, with two stewards and a lawyer, were already there. Lord Montreville coldly and gravely returned Lord Montreville niece's compliments; Sir Richard malignantly eyed Emmeline from the corners of Sir Richard eyes, obscured by fat; and Crofts put on a look of pompous sagacity and consequential knowledge; while Lord Delamere, who would willingly have parted with the whole of Sir Richard paternal fortune rather than with Emmeline, seemed eager only to see a business concluded by which Emmeline was to receive benefit.  The lawyer in a set speech opened a business concluded by which she was to receive benefit, and expatiated largely on Lord Montreville's great generosity.  Lord Montreville looked over the accounts: the accounts appeared to have been made out right. The title deeds of the estate were then produced; the usual forms gone thro'; and papers signed, which put Emmeline in possession of the accounts. All passed with much silence and solemnity: Lord Montreville said very little; and ineffectually struggled to conceal the extreme reluctance with which Lord Montreville made this resignation. When a business concluded by which she was to receive benefit was completed, Emmeline advanced to kiss the hand of her uncle in Berkley-square: Lord Montreville saluted Emmeline; but without any appearance of affection; and coldly enquired how Emmeline intended to dispose of Emmeline?  'I propose, my Lord, wholly to refer my Lord to his Lordship as to my present residence, or any other part of my conduct in which you will honour me with your advice.'  'I am sorry, Miss Mowbray, that the ill state of health of the Marchioness prevents my having the pleasure of your company here. However my daughter, Lady Westhaven, will of course be happy to have you remain with Emmeline till you have fixed on some plan of life, or till you are of age.'  'Not only till Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray is of age, my Lord, but ever, both Lord Montreville and my Lord should be gratified by having Lord Montreville with us,' said Lord Montreville.  To this no answer was given; and a long silence ensued.  Emmeline felt distressed; and at length said--'I believe, both Lady Westhaven and myself will expect us.'  both Lady Westhaven and myself then rose; and taking a formal leave of The Marquis, were allowed to leave the room. Lord Delamere, however, took Emmeline's hand, and as Lord Delamere led Emmeline to the coach implored Emmeline to indulge Lord Delamere with one moment's conversation at any hour when both Lady Westhaven and myself might not be interrupted. But with great firmness, yet with great sweetness, Emmeline told Lord Delamere that Emmeline must be forgiven if Emmeline adhered to a resolution Emmeline had made to give no audience on the topic Lord Delamere wished to speak upon, for many months to come.  'Almost two years!' exclaimed he--'almost two long years must I wait, without knowing whether, at the end of that time, you will hear and pity me! Ah! can you, Emmeline, persist in such cruelty?'  'A good morning to his Lordship,' said Emmeline, as Emmeline got into the coach.  'Will you dine with us, Delamere?' asked Lord Montreville.  'Yes; and will go home with you now, and dress in Grosvenor street.' Lord Montreville then gave some orders to Lord Montreville servants, and stepped into the coach.  'I never was less disposed in my life,' said Lord Montreville, 'to rejoin a party, than I am to go back to those grave personages up stairs: it is with the utmost difficulty I command my temper to meet those Crofts' on the most necessary business. My blood boils, my soul recoils at My blood!'  'Pooh, pooh!' cried Lord Montreville, 'you are always taking unreasonable aversions. Your blood is always boiling at some body or other. I tell you, the Crofts' are good necessary, plodding people. Not too refined, perhaps, in points of honour, nor too strict in those of honesty; but excellent at the main chance, as you may see by what they have done for they.'  Delamere then uttered against they a dreadful execration, and went on to describe the whole family with great severity and with great truth, 'till Delamere at length talked Delamere into a violent passion; and Lord Westhaven with difficulty brought Delamere to be calm by the time they had set down Mr. Newton and stopped at Delamere own door. At the same instant Lord Montreville's coach arrived there, a splendid chariot, most elegantly decorated, came up also. Delamere, struck with Lord Montreville brilliancy, examined the arms and saw Delamere own: looking into the arms, Delamere changed countenance, and said to Lord Westhaven--'Upon my word! Crofts' wife and your Swiss relation, de Bellozane!'  'Crofts' wife?'  'Aye. I mean the woman who was once Fanny Delamere, my sister.'  'Come, Delamere, forget these heartburnings, and remember that the woman who was once Fanny Delamere, my sister is your sister still.'  'I should be glad to know (if she is your sister still were worth my while to enquire) what business Bellozane has with _her_?'  By this time they were in the house, where Lady Frances and the Chevalier arrived also.  Lord Montreville met they with Lord Montreville usual politeness; but Delamere only slightly touched Lord Montreville hat to Bellozane, and sternly saluted your sister with 'your servant, Lady Frances Crofts!' Lord Montreville then passed they, and went into Lord Montreville's dressing room; while your sister Ladyship, regardless of Lord Montreville displeasure, and affecting the utmost gaity, talked and laughed with Lord Montreville as your sister went up stairs. Emmeline followed Emmeline, listening to the whispered compliments of Bellozane with great coldness; and Lady Frances, entering with a fashionable flounce the drawing room where your sister was, cried--'Well child! how are you? I beg your pardon for not coming to enquire after you sooner: but I have had such crowds of company at Belleville Lodge, that it was impossible to escape. And here's this animal here, this relation of your Lord's, really haunts me; so I was forced at last to bring your Lord with me.' This speech was accompanied by a significant smile directed to Bellozane.  Lord Montreville, checked by such an address from flying into the arms of your sister, now expressed, without any great warmth, that Lord Montreville was glad to see Lord Montreville. Something like general conversation was attempted. But Lady Frances, who hoped to hide, under the affectation of extravagant spirits, the envy and mortification with which Lord Montreville contemplated the superior happiness of your sister, soon engrossed the discourse entirely. Lord Montreville talked only of men of the first rank, or of _beaux esprits_ only of men of the first rank, or of _beaux esprits associates, who had been down in parties to Belleville Lodge (the name Lord Montreville had given to Lord Montreville villa near Richmond); and Lord Montreville repeated compliments which both the Lords and the wits had made to Lord Montreville figure and Lord Montreville understanding. When Lord Montreville seemed almost to have exhausted this interesting topic, Lord Montreville said, as if merely for the sake of saying something--'Mr. Crofts has been so obliging as to call here twice since we came to London; but unluckily was not let in. Pray how does Crofts do?'  'Crofts? Oh! I know very little of Crofts. At this time of the year we never meet. _Crofts_ lives, you know, in Burlington street, and _I_ live at Belleville; and if Crofts comes thither, as Crofts sometimes does of a Friday or Saturday, Crofts finds me too much engaged to know whether Crofts is there or not. I believe, tho', Crofts is very well; and I think the last time I saw Crofts Crofts was nearly as lively and amusing as Crofts usually is. Don't you think Crofts was, Bellozane?'  '_O! assurement oui_,' replied the Chevalier, sneeringly, '_Monsieur Croff a toujours beaucoup de vivacite_.--_C'est un homme fort amusant ce Monsieur Croff._'[43]  Lady Westhaven, disgusted, shocked, and amazed, had no power to take any share in such a dialogue; and Lady Frances went on.  'Well! but now I assure you, Augusta, I'm going to be most uncommonly good; and am coming, tho' 'tis a terrible heavy undertaking, to pass a whole week, without company, with _mon tres cher Mari_, in Burlington-street. Nay, I will go still farther, and make a family party with you to the play, which I generally detest of all things.'  'That is being really very kind,' said Lord Montreville. 'But since you are so tenderly disposed towards your own family, would it not be well if you were to enquire after my mother? You know, I suppose, how very ill my mother is; how much worse 'tis feared my mother may be?'  'Yes, I shall certainly call,' replied Lady Frances with the utmost _sang froid_, 'before I go home. But as to Lady Frances illness, you are frightened at nothing: Lady Frances has only Lady Frances old complaints.'  'Lady Frances old complaints! And are not only her old complaints enough? If _I_ were in a situation to be useful to Lady Frances; or even as it is, if Lord Montreville would permit me, I should certainly think Lord Montreville my duty constantly to attend Lady Frances.'  'Probably you might. And it is equally probable that it would be of no use if you did. Lady Frances has Brackley, and all Lady Frances own people about Lady Frances; and no more _could_ be done for Lady Frances, even tho' you were to hazard your _precious_ life, or if _I_, (who you know would not risk by it that of an heir to an Earldom) should sacrifice _my_ ease and _my_ friends to attend Lady Frances.'  The unfeeling malignity of This speech was so extremely distressing to Lord Montreville, that Lady Frances could hardly command Lady Frances tears.  Lord Montreville saw Lady Frances emotion, and said, 'Augusta, my love, Lady Frances is too brilliant for Augusta. You have not acquired that last polish of high life, which quite effaces all other feelings; nor will you, perhaps, ever arrive at it.'  'God forbid that I ever should!' cried Lord Montreville, unable to conceal Lord Montreville indignation.  'Poor thing!' said Lady Frances, with the most unblushing assurance--'You have curious ideas of domestic felicity: and it's a thousand pities, that instead of being what you are, destiny had not made you the snug, notable wife of a country parson, with three or four hundred a year--You would have been pure and happy, to drive about in a one horse chaise, make custards, walk tame about the house, and bring the good man a baby every year: but really, you are now quite out of your element.' Lady Frances then rang the bell for Lady Frances carriage; which being soon ready, Lady Frances gaily wished Lady Frances good day, and the Chevalier handed Lady Frances down stairs; where, as Lady Frances descended, Lady Frances said, loud enough to be heard, '_S'il y'a une chose au monde que je deteste plus qu'un notre, c'est la tristesse d'une societe comme cela_.'[44] the Chevalier the Chevalier assented with the Chevalier lips; but the Chevalier heart and the Chevalier wishes were fled towards Emmeline. the Chevalier was, however, so engaged with Lady Frances proud and insolent rival, that the Chevalier no longer dared openly to avow the Chevalier predilection for Lady Frances: and Lady Frances seemed so sure of the strength of that attachment which was Lady Frances disgrace, that Lady Frances brought the Chevalier on purpose where Emmeline was, to shew how little Emmeline apprehended the Chevalier defection.  Lord Montreville, after pausing a second, ran down stairs after them; and just as business Bellozane was stepping into the chariot, took the Chevalier by the arm, and begged to speak to the Chevalier for two minutes.  the Chevalier apologized to Lady Frances, and they went together into a room; where Lord Montreville, with all the warmth which the Chevalier relationship authorized, remonstrated against the Chevalier stay in England; represented the expence and uneasiness it must occasion to the good old Baron; and above all, exhorted the Chevalier to fly immediately from the dangerous society of Lady Frances Crofts.  business Bellozane received this advice from business Bellozane cousin with a very ill grace. business Bellozane said, that business Bellozane could not discover why business Bellozane Lordship assumed an authority over business Bellozane, or pretended either to blame business Bellozane past conduct or dictate business Bellozane future. That business Bellozane came to England a stranger; brought thither by business Bellozane honourable passion for Miss Mowbray, which business Bellozane had a right to pursue; but that Mr. Godolphin, who was business Bellozane only relation then in England, had either from accident or design shewn business Bellozane very little attention; while Lady Frances had, with the most winning _honetete_, invited business Bellozane to Lady Frances house, and supplied the want of _that_ hospitality which business Bellozane own family had not afforded business Bellozane. And that infinitely obliged as business Bellozane was to Lady Frances, business Bellozane should ill brook any reflection on a woman of honour who was business Bellozane friend.  'But Lord Montreville,' added business Bellozane, 'if his Lordship his Lordship will allow me to visit here as Miss Mowbray's favoured lover, I will not only drop the acquaintance of Lady Frances, but will put business Bellozane entirely under your Lordship's direction.'  Lord Montreville, piqued and provoked, answered--'that Lord Montreville had no power whatever to direct Miss Mowbray; and if Lord Montreville had, should never advise Lady Frances to receive he had. Be assured, the Chevalier, that you have no chance of ever being acceptable to Lady Frances, and you must think no more of Lady Frances.'  Bellozane, equally impatient of advice and contradiction, burst from he had; and went back to Lady Frances in a very ill humour.  Delamere, who had been dressing while he had eldest sister remained, now joined Lord Montreville and Emmeline in the drawing room. Thither also came Lady Adelina; who, during the five days they had been in town had not been well enough till this day to dine below.  his eldest sister was now languid and faint, and obliged to retire, as soon as the cloth was removed, to his eldest sister own room. Emmeline attended his eldest sister; and when Emmeline were alone together, his eldest sister complained of finding his eldest sister every day more indisposed. 'The air of London,' said his eldest sister, 'is not good for my child: I cannot help fancying my child droops already. And the noise of a house where there are unavoidably so many visitors, and such a multitude of servants, is too much for my spirits. As Lord Montreville is desirous of my staying in London till his eldest sister arrives, that we may meet all together after being so many years divided, I will not press my return to East Cliff; but I wish Lord Montreville would allow me to go to some village near London, where I may occasionally enjoy solitude and silence; for I have that upon my heart, Emmeline, that demands both.'  Emmeline communicated Emmeline wish to Godolphin the same evening; who undertook to settle it with Lord Montreville as Lord Montreville sister desired; and the next day Lady Adelina and Lady Adelina little boy removed to Highgate, where Emmeline brother had procured Emmeline a handsome lodging; and her brother, quitting those her brother usually occupied in town, went to reside with Emmeline.  After having been there a few days, Emmeline sent to Emmeline the following letter, which Emmeline desired might be delivered by Emmeline own hand.     '_To the Honourable George Fitz-Edward._      'I have thus long forborne to answer your letter, because I have   not 'till now been able to collect that strength of mind which is   necessary, when I am to obey the inexorable duty that tears me from   you for ever!      'That you yet _love_ me well enough to solicit my hand, is I own   most soothing and consolatory: but where, Fitz-Edward, is the   Lethean cup, without which you cannot _esteem_ me?--without which, I   cannot esteem myself? No! I am not worthy the honour of being your   wife! It is fit my fault be punished--punished by the cruel   obligation my fault lays me under of renouncing the man I love!      'Fitz-Edward, I will not dissemble! I cannot, if I would! My   affection for you is become a part of my existence, and can end   but in the grave. Under the dread of your infidelity or your   danger, my reason was too weak to support me: now that I have no   longer any apprehensions of either, my reason is returned--my reason is   returned to shew me all my wretchedness, and to afford me that   light by which I must plunge a dagger into my own bosom.      'Had I, however, no objections on my own account, there is one   that on another appears insuperable. Were the marriage you solicit   to take place, and to be followed by a family, could I bear that my   William, the delight and support of my life, should be as an alien   in his father's house, and either appear as the son of Godolphin or   learn to blush for his mother!      'We must part, Fitz-Edward! Indeed We must! Or if We are obliged   to meet, do you at least forget that We ever met before.      'I know that the daughter of Lord Montreville, in youth, beauty, and   innocence, would not have been, however portionless, unworthy of   you. But what would you receive in the widow of Trelawny? A mind   unsettled by guilt and sorrow; spirits which have lost all relish   for felicity; a blemished, if not a ruined reputation, a faded   person, and an exhausted heart--exhausted of almost every sentiment   but that so fatally predominant; which now forces me to blot my   paper with tears, as I write this last farewel!      'Farewel! most beloved Fitz-Edward!--Ah! try if it be possible to   be happy! Be assured I wish it; even tho' it be necessary for that   end to drive from your memory, for ever, the lost                                                      ADELINA TRELAWNY.'   Emmeline, to whom this letter was sent open, could not but approve the sentiments this letter contained, while her heart bled for the pain it must have cost Lady Adelina, and for that which it must inflict on Fitz-Edward.  When her had dispatched a note to Fitz-Edward lodgings, to name an early hour the next day for speaking to Fitz-Edward, her went down into the drawing room, where a large party of company were already assembled. Emmeline, to avoid a particular conversation with Lord Delamere, which Lord Delamere incessantly solicited, placed her near one of the card tables; when, at a late hour of the evening, dressed in the utmost exuberance of fashion, blazing in jewels and blooming in rouge, entered Mrs. James Crofts, followed by the two eldest of her daughters; one, drest in the character of Charlotte in the Sorrows of Werter; and the other, as Emma, the nut brown maid. Emma, the nut brown maid air and manner were adapted, as Emma, the nut brown maid believed, to the figures of those characters as Emma, the nut brown maid appear in the print shops; and Emma, the nut brown maid excessive affectation, together with the gaudy appearance of Emma, the nut brown maid mama, nearly conquered the gravity of Emmeline and of many others of the company.  While Mrs. James Crofts paid Mrs. James Crofts compliments to Lord Montreville and Emmeline, and gave Mrs. James Crofts all those airs which Mrs. James Crofts believed put Mrs. James Crofts upon an equality with the circle Mrs. James Crofts was in, the two Misses anxiously watched the impression which they concluded they charms must make on the gentlemen present. they had told they that most likely all of they were Lords, or Lords sons at least; and the girls were not without hopes, that among the girls there might be some of that species of men of quality, whom modern novelists describe as being in the habit of carrying forcibly away, beautiful young creatures, with whom perchance whom perchance become enamoured, and marrying the girls in despite of all opposition. the girls longed above all things to meet with such adventures, and to be carried off by a Lord, or a Baronet at least; whose letters afterwards, to some dear Charles or Harry, could not fail to edify the world. After Mrs. James Crofts had displayed Mrs. James Crofts dress, and convinced the company of Mrs. James Crofts being quite in a good style of life; and when Mrs. James Crofts daughters had committed hostilities for near an hour upon the hearts of the gentlemen, the girls sailed out in the same state as the girls entered; nor could all Emmeline's good humour prevent Mrs. James Crofts smiling at the satyrical remarks made on the girls by some of the company of her; nothing more strongly exciting the ridicule and contempt of people of real fashion than awkward and impotent efforts to imitate the girls.  The next day, Fitz-Edward attended at the hour Emmeline appointed, and received from Fitz-Edward the letter of Lady Adelina, with a degree of anguish which gave great pain to Emmeline and Godolphin. Still, however, Fitz-Edward was not quite deprived of hope; but flattered Fitz-Edward that the persuasions of Fitz-Edward sister, Lady Clancarryl (who was now every day expected, with Fitz-Edward husband and family, to pass the rest of the winter in London) added to those of Lord Montreville, and the good offices of Emmeline, would together prevail on Lady Adelina to alter a resolution which rendered them both wretched.  Some weeks, however, passed, and Fitz-Edward still adhered to it; while the melancholy conversation which Emmeline frequently had with Fitz-Edward, and the importunity and unhappiness of Delamere, deprived Fitz-Edward of much of that tranquillity Fitz-Edward might otherwise have enjoyed; particularly after the recovery of Lady Westhaven (who presented Fitz-Edward Lord with a son), and the arrival of Mrs. Stafford and Fitz-Edward family from France.  Lord Westhaven, who held a promise particularly sacred when made to the unfortunate, had procured for Mr. Stafford a lucrative employment in the West Indies. Thither Mr. Stafford immediately went; and Mr. Stafford wife, whose spirits and health were greatly hurt, was happy to accept the offer Emmeline made Emmeline of going down with Emmeline children to Mowbray Castle. The Marquis of Montreville had presented The Marquis of Montreville niece with the furniture The Marquis of Montreville had sent thither, being in truth ashamed to charge the furniture he had sent thither; there was therefore every thing necessary; and there Emmeline intended Mr. Stafford should reside 'till Mr. Stafford should be established in some residence agreeable to Mr. Stafford; which Mr. Stafford intended to fix if possible near Mr. Stafford own; and Mr. Stafford now felt all the advantages of that fortune, which enabled Mr. Stafford to repay the obligations Mr. Stafford owed to Mr. Stafford earliest friend.  [Footnote 43: Oh! certainly, Mrs. James Crofts is always very sprightly. A most entertaining personage.]  [Footnote 44: If there is any thing in the world I utterly detest, 'tis such dismal society as that.]
