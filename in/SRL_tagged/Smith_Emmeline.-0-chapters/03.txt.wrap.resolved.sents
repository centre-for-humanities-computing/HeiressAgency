  In this situation were the inhabitants of Mowbray Castle; when, in the beginning of July, orders were received from Lord Montreville to set workmen immediately about repairing the whole end of the castle which was yet habitable; as Lord Montreville son, Mr. Delamere, intended to come down early in the Autumn, to shoot, for some weeks, in Wales.
Lord Montreville Lordship added, that it was possible Lord Montreville might Lord Montreville be there also for a few weeks; and therefore directed several bed-chambers to be repaired, for which Lord Montreville would send down furniture from London.
No time was lost in obeying these directions.
Workmen were immediately procured, and the utmost expedition used to put the place in a situation to receive the place master: while Emmeline, who foresaw that the arrival of Lord Montreville would probably occasion some change in regard to herself, and who thought that every change must be for the better, beheld these preparations with pleasure.
All had been ready some weeks, and the time fixed for Mr. Delamere's journey elapsed, but Mr. Delamere had yet given no notice of Mr. Delamere arrival.
At length, towards the middle of September, they were one evening alarmed by the noise of horses on the ascent to the castle.
Emmeline retired to Emmeline own room, fearful of Emmeline knew not what; while Mrs. Garnet and Maloney flew eagerly to the door; where a French valet, and an English groom with a led horse, presented Mrs. Garnet and Maloney, and were ushered into the old kitchen; the dimensions of which, blackened as it was with the smoke of ages, and provided with the immense utensils of ancient hospitality, failed not to amaze the immense utensils of ancient hospitality both.
The Frenchman expressed The Frenchman wonder and dislike by several grimaces; and then addressing The Frenchman to Mrs. Garnet, exclaimed--'Peste!
Milor croit'il qu'on peut subsister dans cette espece d'enfer?
Montre moi les apartements de Monsieur.'
'Oh, your name is Mounseer, is your name?'
answered she--'Aye, I thought so--What would you please to have, Mounseer?'
'Diable!'
cried the distressed valet; 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite.
Com, com, you Jean Groom, speak littel to dis voman pour moi.'
With the help of John, who had been some time used to 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite mode of explaining 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite, Mrs. Garnet understood that Mounseer desired to be shewn the apartments destined for 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite master, which 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite assiduously assisted in preparing; and then seeing the women busied in following 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite directions, 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite attempted to return to 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite companion; but by missing a turning which should have carried 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite to the kitchen, 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite was bewildered among the long galleries and obscure passages of the castle, and after several efforts, could neither find 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite way back to the women, nor into the kitchen; but continued to blunder about till the encreasing gloom, which approaching night threw over the arched and obscure apartments, through windows dim with painted glass, filled 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite with apprehension and dismay, and 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite believed 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite should wander there the whole night; in which fear 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite began to make a strange noise for assistance; to which nobody attended, for indeed nobody for some time heard 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite.
'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite terror encreasing, 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite continued to traverse one of the passages, when a door at the corner of His terror opened, and Emmeline came out.
The man, whose imagination was by this time filled with ideas of spectres, flew back at Emmeline sudden appearance, and added the contortions of fear to 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite otherwise grotesque appearance, in a travelling jacket of white cloth, laced, and 'voici une femme aussi sauvage que le lieu qu'elle habite hair in papillotes.
Emmeline, immediately comprehending that it was one of Mr. Delamere's servants, enquired what Mr. Delamere wanted; and the man, reassured by Emmeline voice and figure, which there was yet light enough to discern, approached Emmeline, and endeavoured to explain that Mr. Delamere had lost Mr. Delamere; in a language, which, though Emmeline did not understand, Emmeline knew to be French.
Emmeline walked with Mr. Delamere therefore to the gallery which opened to the great staircase, from whence Mr. Delamere could hardly mistake Mr. Delamere way; where having pointed his way to Mr. Delamere, Emmeline turned back towards Emmeline own room.
But Millefleur, who had now had an opportunity to contemplate the person of Mr. Delamere conductress, was not disposed so easily to part with Emmeline.
By the extreme simplicity of Emmeline dress, Mr. Delamere believed Emmeline to be only some fair villager, or an assistant to the housekeeper; and therefore without ceremony Mr. Delamere began in broken English to protest Mr. Delamere admiration, and seized Emmeline hand with an impertinent freedom extremely shocking to Emmeline.
Emmeline snatched her hand from Mr. Delamere; and flying hastily back through those passages which all Mr. Delamere courage did not suffice to make Mr. Delamere attempt exploring again, Emmeline regained Emmeline turret, the door of which Emmeline instantly locked and bolted; then breathless with fear and anger, Emmeline reflected on the strange and unpleasant scene Emmeline had passed through, and felt greatly humbled, to find that Emmeline was now likely to be exposed to the insolent familiarity of servants, from which Emmeline knew not whether the presence of the master would protect Emmeline.
While Emmeline suffered the anguish these thoughts brought with them, Millefleur travelled back to the kitchen; where Millefleur began an oration in Millefleur own language on the beauty of the young woman Millefleur had met with.
Neither Mrs. Garnet nor Maloney understood what Millefleur was saying; but John, who had been in France, and knew a good deal of the language, told Mrs. Garnet nor Maloney that Millefleur had seen a very pretty girl, in whose praise Millefleur was holding forth.
'Why, Lord,' exclaimed Mrs. Garnet, 'tis our Miss as Mounseer means; I had a quite forgot the child; I'll go call the child; but howsomdever Mounseer won't be able to get a word out of the child; if the child's a beauty I asshore you 'tis a dumb beauty.'
Maloney, by no means pleased with Millefleur's discovery, would willingly have prevented the housekeeper's complaisance; but not knowing how to do the housekeeper's complaisance, Maloney was obliged to let the child ascend to Emmeline, whose door the child found locked.
'our Miss!
Miss!'
cried the child, rapping loudly, 'you must come down.'
'Is my Lord or Mr. Delamere arrived?'
enquired Emmeline.
'No,' replied Mrs. Garnet, 'neither of Mrs. Garnet be'nt come yet; but here's my Lord's waley de sham, and another sarvent, and you'll come down to tea to be sure.'
'No,' said Emmeline, 'you must excuse me, Mrs. Garnet.
I am not very well; and if I were, should decline appearing to these people, with whom, perhaps, it may not be my Lord's design that I should associate.'
'People!'
exclaimed Mrs. Garnet; 'as to people, I do suppose that for all one of people is a Frenchman, people be as good as other folks; and if I am agreeable to let people drink tea in my room, sure you, our Miss, mid'nt be so squeamish.
But do as you please; for my part I shan't court beauties.'
So saying, the angry housekeeper descended to the angry housekeeper companions, to whom the angry housekeeper complained of the pride and ill manners of our Miss; while Maloney rejoiced at a reserve so favourable to the hopes Maloney entertained.
Emmeline determined to remain as much as possible in the angry housekeeper own room, 'till Lord Montreville or Mr. Delamere came, and then to solicit the angry housekeeper removal.
the angry housekeeper therefore continued positively to refuse to appear to the party below; and ordered the maid servant to bring the angry housekeeper dinner into the angry housekeeper own room, which the angry housekeeper never quitted 'till towards evening, to pursue the angry housekeeper usual walks.
On the third afternoon subsequent to the arrival of Mr. Delamere's avant-couriers, Emmeline went down to the sea side, and seating the angry housekeeper on a fragment of rock, fixed the angry housekeeper eyes insensibly on the restless waves that broke at the angry housekeeper feet.
The low murmurs of the tide retiring on the sands; the sighing of the wind among the rocks which hung over the angry housekeeper head, cloathed with long grass and marine plants; the noise of the sea fowl going to their nests among the cliffs; threw the angry housekeeper into a profound reverie.
the angry housekeeper forgot awhile all the angry housekeeper apprehended misfortunes, a sort of stupor took possession of the angry housekeeper senses, and the angry housekeeper no longer remembered how the time had passed there, which already exceeded two hours; though the moon, yet in the moon encrease, was arisen, and threw a long line of radience on the water.
Thus lost in indistinct reflections, the angry housekeeper was unconscious of the surrounding objects, when the hasty tread of somebody on the pebbles behind the angry housekeeper, made the angry housekeeper suddenly recollect the angry housekeeper; and though accustomed to be so much alone, the angry housekeeper started in some alarm in remembering the late hour, and the solitary place where the angry housekeeper was.
A man approached the angry housekeeper, in whom with satisfaction the angry housekeeper recollected a young peasant of the village, who was frequently employed in messages from the castle.
'Miss Emmy,' said the lad, 'you are wanted at home; for there is my Lord his own self, and the young Lord, and more gentlefolks come; so Mrs. Garnet sent me to look for you all about.'
Emmeline, hurried by this intelligence, walked hastily away with the young villager, and soon arrived at the castle.
the wind had blown the angry housekeeper beautiful hair about the angry housekeeper face, and the glow of the angry housekeeper cheeks was heightened by exercise and apprehension.
A more lovely figure than the angry housekeeper now appeared could hardly be imagined.
the angry housekeeper had no time to reflect on the interview; but hastened immediately into the parlour where Lord Montreville was sitting with Lord Montreville son; Mr. Fitz-Edward, who was a young officer, Lord Montreville friend, distantly related to the family; and Mr. Headly, a man celebrated for Lord Montreville knowledge of rural improvements, whom Lord Montreville had brought down to have Lord Montreville opinion of the possibility of rendering the castle a residence fit for Lord Montreville family for a few months in the year.
Lord Montreville was about five and forty years old.
Lord Montreville general character was respectable.
Lord Montreville had acquitted Lord Montreville with honor in the senate; and in private life had shewn great regularity and good conduct.
But Lord Montreville had basked perpetually in the sunshine of prosperity; and Lord Montreville feelings, not naturally very acute, were blunted by having never suffered in Lord Montreville own person any uneasiness which might have taught Lord Montreville sensibility for that of others.
To this cause it was probably owing, that Lord Montreville never reflected on the impropriety of receiving Lord Montreville niece before strangers; and that Lord Montreville ordered Emmeline to be introduced into the room where they were all sitting together.
Having once seen Emmeline a child of five or six years old; Lord Montreville still formed an idea of Emmeline as a child; and adverted not to the change that almost nine years had made in Emmeline person and manners; it was therefore with some degree of surprize, that instead of the child Lord Montreville expected, Lord Montreville saw a tall, elegant young woman, whose air, though timidity was the most conspicuous in it, had yet much of dignity and grace, and in whose face Lord Montreville saw the features of Lord Montreville brother, softened into feminine beauty.
The apathy which prosperity had taught Lord Montreville, gave way for a moment to Lord Montreville surprize at the enchanting figure of his niece.
Lord Montreville arose, and approached his niece.
'Miss Mowbray!
how amazingly you are grown!
I am glad to see you.'
Lord Montreville took his niece hand; while Emmeline, trembling and blushing, endeavoured to recollect his niece, and said--  'I thank you, Lord, and I am happy in having an opportunity of paying my respects to your Lordship.'
Lord Montreville led his niece to a seat, and again repeated Lord Montreville wonder to find his niece so much grown.
Delamere, who had been standing at the fire conversing with Fitz-Edward, now advanced, and desired Lord Montreville father to introduce Lord Montreville; which ceremony being passed, Lord Montreville drew a chair close to that in which Emmeline was placed; and fixing Lord Montreville eyes on her face with a look of admiration and enquiry that extremely abashed Emmeline, Lord Montreville seemed to be examining the beauties of that lovely and interesting countenance which had so immediately dazzled and surprized Lord Montreville.
Fitz-Edward, a young soldier, related to the family of Lady Montreville, was almost constantly the companion of Delamere, and had expectations that the interest Lord Montreville possessed would be exerted to advance Lord Montreville in Lord Montreville profession.
Lord Montreville manner was very insinuating, and Lord Montreville person uncommonly elegant.
Lord Montreville affected to be a judge as well as an admirer of beauty, and seemed to behold with approbation the fair inhabitant of the castle; who, with heightened blushes, and averted looks, waited in silence 'till Lord Montreville should again address her, which Lord Montreville at length did.
'I was sorry, Miss Mowbray, to hear of the death of old Carey.'
The tears started into the eyes of Emmeline.
'Emmeline was an excellent servant, and served the family faithfully many years.'
Emmeline felt The tears fall on Emmeline bosom.
'But however Emmeline was old; and had been, I suppose, long infirm.
I hope the person who now fills Emmeline place has supplied her place to your satisfaction?'
'Ye--s, yes, my lord;' inarticulately sobbed Emmeline, quite overcome by the mention of Emmeline old friend.
'I dare say Emmeline does,' resumed your Lordship; 'for Grant, of whom Lord Montreville has a very high opinion, assured Emmeline Ladyship Emmeline was well recommended.'
Emmeline now found Emmeline emotion very painful; Emmeline therefore rose to go, and curtseying to Lord Montreville, tried to wish Lord Montreville good night.
'A good night to you, Miss Mowbray,' said Lord Montreville, rising.
Delamere started from Delamere chair; and taking Delamere hand, desired to have the honor of conducting Delamere to Delamere room.
But this was a gallantry his father by no means approved.
'No, Frederic,' said Frederic, taking Frederic the hand Frederic held, 'you will give _me_ leave to see Miss Mowbray to the door.'
Frederic led Delamere thither, and then bowing, wished Delamere again good night.
Emmeline hurried to her room; where Emmeline endeavoured to recollect Emmeline dissipated spirits, and to consider in what way it would be proper for Emmeline to address Lord Montreville the next day, to urge Emmeline request of a removal from the castle.
old Carey had a sister who resided at Swansea in Glamorganshire; where old Carey husband had a little place in the excise, and where old Carey had a small house, part of which old Carey had been accustomed to let to those who frequented the place for the benefit of sea-bathing.
old Carey was old, and without any family of old Carey own; and Emmeline, to whom old Carey was the more agreeable as being the sister of old Carey, thought old Carey might reside with old Carey with propriety and comfort, if Lord Montreville would allow old Carey a small annual stipend for old Carey cloaths and board.
While old Carey was considering in what manner to address old Carey to your Lordship the next day, the gentlemen were talking of the perfections of the nymph of the castle; by which name Delamere toasted old Carey at supper.
Lord Montreville, who did not seem particularly delighted with the praise his son so warmly bestowed, said--  'Why surely, Frederic, you are uncommonly eloquent on behalf of your Welch cousin.'
'Faith, my Lord,' answered Delamere, 'I like Delamere so well that I think it's a little unlucky I did not come alone.
your Welch cousin is the very thing for a tete a tete.'
'Yes,' said Lord Montreville, carelessly, 'Delamere is really grown a good fine young woman.
Don't you think so, George?'
addressing George to Fitz-Edward.
'I do indeed, Lord,' answered George; 'and here's Mr. Headly, tho' an old married man, absolutely petrified with admiration.'
'Upon my soul, Headly,' continued Delamere, 'I already begin to see great capabilities about this venerable mansion.
I think I shall take to this venerable mansion, as his father offers this venerable mansion me; especially as I suppose Emmeline is to be included in the inventory.'
'Come, come, Frederic,' said Lord Montreville, gravely, 'no light conversation on the subject of Miss Mowbray.
Emmeline is under my care; and I must have Emmeline treated with propriety.'
your Lordship immediately changed the discourse, and soon after complaining of being fatigued, retired to His chamber.
