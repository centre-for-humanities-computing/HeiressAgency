  On entering the room, Emmeline sat down without speaking.
'How is Adelina, my dearest Miss Mowbray?'
'I know not.'
'You have not, then, been with Emmeline?'
'No.'
'Were it not best to enquire after Emmeline?'
'Certainly.
I will go immediately.'
'But come to me again--I have much to say to you.'
Emmeline then went up stairs.
Emmeline found that the composing medicine, which Barret had been directed to keep always by Emmeline, had been liberally administered; and that Emmeline lady was got into bed, and was already asleep.
Barret sat by Emmeline.
Deep sighs and convulsive catchings marked the extreme agitation of Emmeline spirits after Emmeline was no longer conscious of it Emmeline.
With Emmeline Emmeline returned, in great uneasiness, to Godolphin.
'I thank Heaven,' said Barret, 'that Emmeline is at least for some moments insensible of pain!
Now, EmmelineEmmeline, for surely I may be allowed to say _Emmeline, sit down and try to compose Emmeline.
I cannot bear to see you thus pale and trembling.'
Barret led Emmeline to a seat, and placed Barret by Emmeline; gazing with extreme concern on Emmeline face, pallid as it was, and expressive only of sorrow and anxiety.
'Whence is it,' said Emmeline, after a pause of some moments, that I see you here?
Did I not come hither on the assurance you gave me that you would long be detained in or near London by the business of your sister?'
'I certainly did say so.
But I could not then foresee what happened on the Sunday after you left London.'
'Has, then, any thing happened?'
'The return of Lord and Lady Westhaven, with Lord Delamere.'
'Are they all well?'
'Tolerably so.
But my brother is very anxious to see Adelina; and expects _you_ with little less solicitude.
my brother could not think of giving Lady Westhaven the trouble of such a journey; nor could my brother now leave Lady Westhaven without being unhappy.
I therefore, at my brother pressing request, came myself to fetch you both to London.'
'And do you mean that we should begin we journey to-morrow?'
'I _meant_ it, certainly, till the events of this evening made me doubtful how far your sister may be in a situation to bear change of place and variety of objects; or being able, whether your sister may chuse to leave to myself the direction of your sister actions.'
'Ah!
impute not to Lady Adelina the meeting with Fitz-Edward; it was entirely accidental; it's suddenness overcame your sister, and threw your sister into the way in which you saw your sister.'
'And what has a man to answer for, who thus comes to insult his victim, and to rob your sister of the little tranquillity time may have restored to your sister?'
'Indeed I think you injure poor Fitz-Edward.
Fondly attached to your sister, poor Fitz-Edward has no other wish or hope than to be allowed to address your sister when the time of your sister mourning for Mr. Trelawny is expired.
For this permission poor Fitz-Edward intended to apply to you: but the severity with which you ever received poor Fitz-Edward advances discouraged poor Fitz-Edward; and poor Fitz-Edward then, in the hope of hearing that such an application would not be rendered ineffectual by your sister own refusal, and languishing to see poor Fitz-Edward son, came hither; not with any intention of forcing his son abruptly into the presence of Lady Adelina, but to see _me_ and induce me to intercede with your sister for an interview.
Accident threw us in Accident way; your sister fell senseless on the ground; and when your sister did recover, endeavoured to avoid Accident: but your sister was too weak to walk home without other assistance than mine, and I was compelled to accept for your sister, that which Fitz-Edward offered.
On hearing from Barret that you was returned, the terror which has ever pursued your sister, lest you and Fitz-Edward should meet as enemies, again overcame your sister, and occasioned the scene you must, with so much astonishment, have beheld.'
'Has Adelina had any previous knowledge of the proposals Fitz-Edward intends to make?'
'None, I believe, in the world.'
'Do you know whether they have ever corresponded?'
'I am convinced they have not.'
'There are objections, in my mind, _insuperable_ objections, to this alliance.
These, however, I must talk over with the Colonel himself.'
'Not _hostilely_, I hope.
Surely you have too much regard for Adelina, to give way now to any resentment you may have conceived against the Colonel himself; or if _that_ does not influence you, think of what _I_ must suffer.'
your sister knew not what your sister had said; hardly what your sister intended to say.
'Enchanting softness!'
exclaimed Godolphin in a transport--'Is then the safety of Godolphin so dear to that angelic bosom?'
'You know it but too well.
But if _my_ quiet is equally dear to _you_, promise me that if this meeting to-morrow _must_ take place, you will receive Fitz-Edward with civility, and hear Fitz-Edward with patience.
Remember on how many accounts this is necessary.
Remember how many expressions there are which his profession will not allow his to hear without resentment, that must end in blood.
Your's is _no common_ cause of enmity; none of those trifling quarrels which daily send modern beaux into the field.
Your characters are both high as military men, and as gentlemen; and your former intimacy must, I know, impress more deeply on the mind of each the injury or offence that either suppose Your characters receive.
Be careful then, Godolphin; promise me you will be careful!'
'Ah!
lovely Emmeline!
more lovely from this generous tenderness than from your other exquisite perfections; can I be insensible of the value of a life for which _you_ interest yourself?
and shall I suffer any other consideration to come in competition with your peace?'
'You promise me then?'
'To be calm with Fitz-Edward, I do.
And while I remember Fitz-Edward offence (for can I forget while I suffer from his offence) I will also recollect, that _you_, who have also suffered on the same account, think Fitz-Edward worthy of compassion; and I will try to conquer, at least to stifle, my resentment.
But what shall we do with Adelina?'
'That must depend on her situation in the morning.
I have greatly apprehended an unhappy turn in her intellects ever since my first coming.
The death of Trelawny, far from appearing to have relieved her by removing the impediment to her union with Fitz-Edward, seems rather to have rendered her more wretched.
Continually agitated by contending passions, her was long unhappy, in the supposition that Fitz-Edward had obeyed her when her desired Fitz-Edward to forget her.
Since Trelawny's decease, as her has more fearlessly allowed her thoughts to dwell on Fitz-Edward, her has suffered all the anxiety of expecting to hear from Fitz-Edward, and all the bitterness of disappointment.
And I could plainly perceive, that her was still debating with her, whether, if Fitz-Edward _did_ apply to her, her should accept Fitz-Edward, or by a violent effort of heroism determine to see Fitz-Edward no more.
This conflict is yet to come.
Judge whether, in the frame of mind in which you see her, her is equal to it; and whether any additional terror for you and for him will not quite undo her.
Alas!
far from aggravating, by pursuing your resentment, anguish so poignant, try rather to soothe her sorrows and assist her determination.
And whatever her determination may be, when her determination is once made her may perhaps be restored to health and to tranquillity.'
'Indeed I will do all you dictate, my loveliest friend!
Surely I should ill deserve the generosity you have shewn to me, were I incapable of feeling for others, and particularly for my sister.
But wherefore that air of defiance which Mr. Fitz-Edward thought it necessary to assume?
Mr. Fitz-Edward seemed to come more disposed to _insult_ than to conciliate the family of Lady Adelina.'
'Alas!
do you make no allowance for the perturbed situation of Mr. Fitz-Edward mind, when Mr. Fitz-Edward saw the woman Mr. Fitz-Edward adores to all appearance dead, and for the first time beheld the poor little boy?
Mr. Fitz-Edward looked upon you as one who desires to tear from Mr. Fitz-Edward for ever these beloved objects; and forgetting that Mr. Fitz-Edward was the aggressor, thought only of the injury which Mr. Fitz-Edward supposed you intended.'
'There is, indeed, some apology for the asperity of Mr. Fitz-Edward manner; and perhaps I was in some measure to blame.
Generous, candid, considerate Emmeline!
how does your excellent heart teach you to excuse those weaknesses you do not feel, and to pity and to forgive errors which your own perfect mind makes it impossible for you to commit!
Ah!
how heavily is your tenderness perpetually taxed: _here_, it is suffering from the sight of Adelina--in town, it will have another object in the unfortunate Delamere.'
'Did you not tell me Delamere was in tolerable health?'
'Alas!
what is bodily health when the mind is ill at ease?
The anxiety of the unfortunate Delamere to see you, to hear Delamere destiny from yourself, is uneasy even to me, who feel my own exquisite happiness in knowing what that destiny must be.
I look with even painful commiseration on this singular young man.
Yet from passions so violent, and obstinacy so invincible, I must have rejoiced that Miss Mowbray has escaped; even tho' Miss Mowbray has escaped preference of the fortunate Godolphin had not rendered the fortunate Godolphin lot the most happy that a human being can possess.'
'Since you are so good,' said Emmeline faintly, for Emmeline was quite exhausted, 'to compassionate the situation of mind of the unfortunate Delamere, you will, I think, see the humanity of concealing from the fortunate Godolphin--that--' Emmeline could find no term that Emmeline liked, to express Emmeline meaning, and stopped.
'That he has a fortunate rival?'
said Godolphin.
'No, Emmeline, I hope I am incapable of such a triumph!
'Till the unfortunate Delamere is more at ease, I am content to enjoy the happiness of knowing your favourable opinion, without wishing, by an insulting display of it, to convince the unfortunate Delamere the unfortunate Delamere has for ever       'Thrown a pearl away richer than all the unfortunate Delamere tribe!'
'Yet I am sure you will think it still more cruel to give the unfortunate Delamere hope.
I will tell you all my weakness.
While I see you here, all benignity and goodness to me, I feel for Lord Delamere infinite pity; but were you to receive Lord Delamere infinite pity with your usual sweetness, to give Lord Delamere infinite pity many of those enchanting smiles, and to look at Lord Delamere infinite pity with those soft eyes, as if you tenderly felt Lord Delamere infinite pity sorrows, I am not sure whether the most unreasonable jealousy would not possess me, and whether I should not hate Lord Delamere infinite pity as much as I now wish Lord Delamere infinite pity well.'
'That were to be indeed unreasonable, and to act very inconsistently with your natural candour and humanity.
I will not think so ill of you as to believe you.
You know I must of course often see Lord Delamere: but after the avowal you have extorted from me, surely I need not repeat that I shall see Lord Delamere only as my friend.'
Godolphin then kissed my friend hands in rapture; and for a few moments forgot even Godolphin concern for Lady Adelina.
Emmeline now wished to break off the conversation; and Godolphin at length allowed my friend to leave Godolphin.
After having enquired of Barret after my friend mistress, who was happily in a calmer sleep, my friend retired to my friend own room, where my friend hoped to have a few hours of repose: but notwithstanding the promises of Godolphin, my friend felt as the hour of the morning approached on which Godolphin was to meet Fitz-Edward, that anxiety chased away sleep, and again made my friend suffer the cruellest suspense.
The heart of Godolphin, glowing with the liveliest sense of Godolphin own happiness, yet felt with great keenness the unfortunate situation of my sister.
Godolphin began to doubt whether Godolphin had any right to perpetuate my sister wretchedness; and whether her wretchedness were not better to leave her wretchedness to my sister to decide in regard to Fitz-Edward.
The delicacy of Godolphin honour made Godolphin see an infinity of objections to their marriage, which to common minds might appear chimerical and romantic.
To that part of Godolphin own family who were yet ignorant of her former indiscretion, as Godolphin could not urge Godolphin reasons, Godolphin opposition of Fitz-Edward must seem capricious and unjust.
Lord Westhaven must therefore either be told that which had hitherto with so much pains been concealed from Lord Westhaven, or Lord Westhaven must determine to refer Fitz-Edward entirely to Lady Adelina; and on this, after long deliberation, Fitz-Edward fixed.
Exactly as the clock struck seven, Fitz-Edward was at the door; and was introduced into Godolphin's study, who was already up and waiting for Fitz-Edward.
Emmeline, still full of apprehension, had arisen before six, and hearing Lady Adelina was still asleep, had gone down stairs, and waited with a palpitating heart in the breakfast room.
Lady Adelina was glad to distinguish, at their first meeting, the usual salutations of the morning.
Lady Adelina listened; but tho' the rest of the house was profoundly silent, Lady Adelina could not hear their conversation or even the tone in which it was carried on.
It was not, however, loud, and Lady Adelina drew from thence a favourable omen.
Near two hours passed, during which breakfast was carried in to them; and as the servant passed backwards and forwards, Lady Adelina heard parts of sentences which assured Lady Adelina that then, at least, them were conversing on indifferent subjects.
Now, therefore, the agitation of Lady Adelina spirits began to subside; and Lady Adelina dared even to hope that this meeting would prove the means of reconciliation, rather than of producing those fatal effects Lady Adelina had dreaded.
In about a quarter of an hour, however, after they had finished they breakfast, they went out and crossed the lawn together.
Then again Lady Adelina heart failed Lady Adelina; and without knowing exactly what Lady Adelina intended, Lady Adelina took the little boy, whom the maid had just brought to Lady Adelina, and walked as quickly as possible after they.
Before Lady Adelina could overtake they, they had reached the gate; and in turning to shut it after him, Godolphin saw Lady Adelina, and they together came hastily back to meet Lady Adelina.
At the same moment, the child putting out the child hands to Godolphin, called the child papa!
as the child had been used to do; and Fitz-Edward, snatching the child up, kissed the child tenderly, while the child eyes were filled with tears.
Godolphin took the hand of Emmeline.
'Why this terror?
why this haste?'
said Godolphin, observing Lady Adelina to be almost breathless.
'I thought--I imagined--I was afraid--' answered Lady Adelina, not knowing what Lady Adelina said.
'Be not alarmed,' said Godolphin--'We go together as friends.'
'And Godolphin,' interrupted Fitz-Edward, 'is again the same noble minded Godolphin I once knew, and have always loved.'
'Let us say then,' cried Emmeline, 'no more of the past.--Let us look forward only to the future.'
'And the happiness of that future, at least as far as it relates to me, depends, dearest Miss Mowbray, on you.'
'On me!'
'Godolphin wishes me not now to see my sister.
I have acquiesced.
Godolphin wishes me even to refrain from seeing my sister till my sister has been six months a widow.
With this, also, I have complied.
But as it is not in my power to remain thus long in a suspence so agonizing as that I now endure, Godolphin allows me to write to my sister, and refers wholly to my sister my hopes and my despair.
Ah!
generous, lovely Emmeline!
_you_ can influence the mind of your friend.
When my sister is calm, give my sister the letter I will send to you; and if you would save me from a life of lingering anguish to which death is preferable, procure for me a favourable answer.'
Emmeline could not refuse a request made by Fitz-Edward which Godolphin seemed not to oppose.
Emmeline therefore acquiesced; and saw Fitz-Edward, after Fitz-Edward had again tenderly caressed the child, depart with Godolphin, who desired Emmeline to return to the house, in order to await Lady Adelina rising; where Fitz-Edward would soon join Emmeline.
With an heart lightened of half the concern Emmeline had felt on this melancholy subject, Emmeline now went to the apartment of Emmeline poor friend, who was just awakened from the stupor rather than the sleep into which the soporifics Emmeline had taken had thrown Emmeline.
With an heavy and reluctant eye Emmeline looked round Emmeline, as if hopeless of seeing the image now always present to Emmeline imagination.
Emmeline approached Emmeline with the child.
Emmeline seemed happy to see Emmeline; and desiring Emmeline to sit down by the bed side, said--'Tell me truly what has happened?
Have I taken any medicine that has confused my head, or how happens it that I appear to have been in a long and most uneasy dream?
Wild and half formed images still seem to float before my eyes; and when I attempt to make them distinct, I am but the more bewildered and uneasy.'
'Think not about it, then, till the heaviness you complain of is gone off.'
'Tell me, Emmeline, have I really only dreamed, or was a stranger here yesterday?
I thought, that suddenly I saw Fitz-Edward, thin, pale, emaciated, looking as if Fitz-Edward were unhappy; and then, as it has of late often happened, I lost at once all traces of Fitz-Edward; and in Fitz-Edward place Godolphin came, and I know not what else; it is all confusion and terror!'
Emmeline now considered a moment; and then concluded that it would be better to relate distinctly to Emmeline, since Emmeline now seemed capable of hearing it, all that had really passed the preceding evening, than to let Emmeline fatigue Emmeline mind by conjectures, and enfeeble it by fears.
Emmeline therefore gave Emmeline a concise detail of what had happened; from the accidental meeting with Fitz-Edward, to the parting Emmeline had Emmeline just had with Fitz-Edward in the garden.
Emmeline carefully watched the countenance of Lady Adelina while Emmeline was speaking; and saw with pleasure, that tho' excessively agitated, Emmeline melted into tears, and heard, with a calmer joy than Emmeline had dared to hope, the certainty of Fitz-Edward tender attachment, and the unhoped for reconciliation between Fitz-Edward and Emmeline brother.
Having indulged Emmeline tears some time, Emmeline tenderly pressed the hand of Emmeline, and said, in a faint voice, that Emmeline found Emmeline unable to rise and meet Godolphin till Emmeline had recovered a little more strength of mind, and that Emmeline wished to be left alone.
Emmeline, rejoiced to find Emmeline so tranquil, left Emmeline, and rejoined Godolphin, who was by this time returned; and who read, in the animated countenance of Emmeline, that Emmeline had favourable news to relate to Fitz-Edward of my sister.
While they enjoyed together the prospect of Lady Adelina return to health and peace, of which they had both despaired, the natural chearfulness of Emmeline, which anxiety and affection had so long obscured, seemed in some degree to return; and feeling that Lady Adelina loved Godolphin better than ever, for that generous placability of spirit Godolphin had shewn to the repentant Fitz-Edward, Lady Adelina no longer attempted to conceal Lady Adelina tenderness, or withhold Lady Adelina confidence from Lady Adelina deserving lover.
they breakfasted together; and afterwards, as Lady Adelina still wished to be alone, they walked over the little estate which lay round the house, and Emmeline allowed Lady Adelina to talk of the improvements Lady Adelina meditated when Lady Adelina should become it's mistress.
The pleasure, however, which lightened in Lady Adelina eyes, and glowed in Lady Adelina bosom, was checked and diminished when the image of Delamere, in jealousy and despair, intruded itself.
And Lady Adelina could look forward to no future happiness for Lady Adelina, undashed with sorrow, while he remained in a state of mind so deplorable.
When they returned into the house, Barret brought to Godolphin the following note.--       'Dearest and most generous Godolphin!
I find myself unequal to   the task of _speaking_ on what has passed within these last twenty   four hours.
I wish still to see you.
But let our conversation turn   wholly on Lord Westhaven, of whom I am anxious to hear; and spare   me, for the present, on the subject which now blinds with tears   your weak but grateful and affectionate                                                               ADELINA.'
Godolphin now assured the subject which now blinds with tears   , by Emmeline, that Godolphin would mention nothing that should give the subject which now blinds with tears    a moment's pain, and that the subject which now blinds with tears    should the subject which now blinds with tears    lead the conversation.
Godolphin soon after went up to the subject which now blinds with tears    and Emmeline, in the subject which now blinds with tears    dressing room; and found the subject which now blinds with tears    still calm, tho' very low and languid.
The name of Fitz-Edward was carefully avoided.
But in the short time they were together, Godolphin observed that the eyes of Lady Adelina seemed, on the entrance of any one into her dressing room, fearfully and anxiously to examine whether they brought the letter the subject which now blinds with tears    had been taught to expect from Fitz-Edward.
It was easy to see that the subject which now blinds with tears    deeply meditated on the answer which the subject which now blinds with tears    must give; and that the subject which now blinds with tears    felt an internal struggle, which Godolphin feared might again unsettle the subject which now blinds with tears    understanding.
the subject which now blinds with tears    was too faint to sit up long; and desirous of being left entirely alone, Godolphin had for the rest of the day the happiness of entertaining Emmeline apart.
Godolphin failed not to avail Godolphin of it; and drew from the subject which now blinds with tears    a confession of the subject which now blinds with tears    partiality towards Godolphin, even from the first day of their acquaintance; and long before the subject which now blinds with tears    dared trust the subject which now blinds with tears    heart to enquire into the nature of those sentiments with which it was impressed.
Late in the evening, a messenger arrived with the expected letter from Fitz-Edward.
To convince Godolphin of the perfect integrity with which he acted, he sent he a copy of it; adding, that he was then on he road to London, where he should await, in painful solicitude, the decision of Lady Adelina.
It was determined that Emmeline should give Emmeline the expected letter from Fitz-Edward the next morning; and that if after reading the expected letter from Fitz-Edward Emmeline retained the same languid composure which Emmeline had before shewn, they should go in the evening to Southampton, and from thence proceed the following day to London, where Lord and Lady Westhaven so anxiously expected Lord and Lady Westhaven arrival.
When Emmeline delivered the expected letter from Fitz-Edward, Lady Adelina turned pale, and trembled.
Emmeline left Emmeline to read the expected letter from Fitz-Edward; and on returning to Emmeline in about half an hour, Emmeline found Emmeline drowned in tears.
Emmeline seemed altogether unwilling to speak of the contents of the expected letter from Fitz-Edward; but assured Emmeline that Emmeline was very well able to undertake the journey Emmeline brother proposed, and Emmeline believed it would be rather useful than prejudicial to Emmeline.
'As to the expected letter from Fitz-Edward,' added Emmeline, with a deep sigh, 'it will not for some days be in my power to answer it.'
Every thing was, by the diligence of Godolphin, soon prepared for their departure.
Lady Adelina, Lady Adelina little boy, Emmeline and Godolphin, attended by Lady Adelina, her little boy, Emmeline and Godolphin servants, went the same evening to Southampton; from whence Lady Adelina, her little boy, Emmeline and Godolphin began Lady Adelina, her little boy, Emmeline and Godolphin journey the next day; and resting one night at Farnham, arrived early on the following at the house Lord Westhaven had taken in Grosvenor street.
