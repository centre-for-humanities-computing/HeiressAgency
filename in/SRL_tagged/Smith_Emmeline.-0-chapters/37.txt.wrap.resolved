  Mrs. Stafford now saw that nothing remained but to follow   Mrs. Stafford husband to a prison, or prevail on her husband to go to the Continent while   Mrs. Stafford attempted anew to settle her husband affairs.  Obstinate even in despair,   Mrs. Stafford had the utmost difficulty to convince Obstinate of the necessity of this measure; and would never, perhaps, have done this measure, if the more persuasive argument of a writ, taken out by James Crofts, had not driven Obstinate to embrace it rather than go into confinement.  Mrs. Stafford with difficulty procured money to furnish Obstinate for Obstinate journey, and saw Obstinate depart for Dover; while   Mrs. Stafford herself returned to Emmeline, who had passed the three weeks of   Mrs. Stafford absence in great uneasiness. No news had been received of Delamere; and   Mrs. Stafford now believed, that of the promise Obstinate had forced from   Mrs. Stafford Obstinate meant not to avail Obstinate; yet did not relinquish it; but in proud and sullen resentment, disdained even to enquire whether Obstinate had justly harboured anger against   Mrs. Stafford.   Mrs. Stafford wished to have withdrawn a promise   Mrs. Stafford could no longer think of without pain and regret; but   Mrs. Stafford found   Mrs. Stafford so unhappy, that   Mrs. Stafford could not resolve to oppress   Mrs. Stafford by complaints; and after some struggles with   Mrs. Stafford, determined to let the matter take it's course.  Willingly, however,   Mrs. Stafford consented to accompany   Mrs. Stafford friend to France; where   Mrs. Stafford, at   Mrs. Stafford husband's request, now determined to go with   Mrs. Stafford family.   Mrs. Stafford had found an opulent tradesman in a neighbouring town, who engaged, on receiving a mortgage on the estate, and ten per cent. interest, (which he so managed as to evade the appearance of usury,) to let   Mrs. Stafford have the money to pay Mr. Crofts, and a farther sum for the support of her family: and having got a tenant for the house, and satisfied as many of the clamorous creditors as   Mrs. Stafford could,   Mrs. Stafford prepared, with a heavy heart, to quit   Mrs. Stafford abode, with Emmeline and   Mrs. Stafford infant family.  As it was necessary that little William should be sent to the Isle of Wight before their departure, Emmeline wrote to fix a day at the distance of a month, on which Emmeline desired Lady Adelina to send some careful person for Lady Adelina. But ten days before the expiration of that period, letters came from Mr. Stafford, in which he directed he wife, who intended to embark at Brighthelmstone and land at Dieppe, to change Emmeline route, and sail from Southampton to Havre. he also desired Emmeline to hasten Emmeline journey: and as every thing was now put on the best footing the time would allow, Emmeline immediately complied; and with Emmeline own unfortunate family, Emmeline, and little William, (whom they now meant to carry they to Lady Adelina) they left Woodfield.  The pain of quitting, probably for ever, a favourite abode, which Emmeline feared would at length be torn from Emmeline children by the rapacity of the law, and the fatigue of travelling with infant children, under such circumstances, almost overcame the resolution and spirits of Emmeline. Emmeline, ever reasonable, gentle, and consoling, was Emmeline principal support; and on the evening of the second day Emmeline, ever reasonable, gentle, and consoling arrived at Southampton.  While Emmeline almost forgot in Emmeline attention to Emmeline friend Emmeline own uncertain and unpleasant state, Delamere remained in Norfolk, where Delamere had hid Delamere from the enquiries of Delamere father, and from the importunities of Delamere mother, who was now, with Delamere eldest daughter, settled again in Berkley Square. Here Delamere nourished inveterate resentment against Fitz-Edward: and finding it impossible to forget Emmeline, Delamere continued to think of Emmeline as much as ever, but with indignation, jealousy and rage.  Delamere had, immediately on receiving, as Delamere believed, a confirmation of all those suspicions with which the Crofts' had so artfully inspired Delamere, resolved to demand satisfaction of Fitz-Edward; and hearing on enquiry that Delamere was in Ireland, but Delamere return immediately expected, Delamere waited with eager and restless uneasiness till the person whom Delamere had commissioned to inform Delamere of his return should send notice that Delamere was again in London.  Week after week, however, passed away. Delamere still heard, that tho' expected hourly, Fitz-Edward arrived not. Time, far from softening the asperity with which Fitz-Edward thoughts dwelt on this supposed rival, seemed only to irritate and inflame Fitz-Edward resentment; and ingenious in tormenting Fitz-Edward, Fitz-Edward now added new anguish to that which corroded Fitz-Edward heart, by supposing that Emmeline, aware of the danger which threatened her lover from the vengeance of Fitz-Edward injured friend, had written to Fitz-Edward to prevent his return. This idea was confirmed, when the agent whom Fitz-Edward employed to watch the return of Fitz-Edward at length informed Fitz-Edward that Fitz-Edward had obtained leave of absence from Fitz-Edward regiment, now in England, and was to pass the remainder of the winter with Lord and Lady Clancarryl.  The fury of Fitz-Edward passions seemed to be suspended, while with gloomy satisfaction Fitz-Edward looked forward to a speedy retribution: but now, when no immediate prospect offered of meeting the author of Fitz-Edward calamities, they tormented Fitz-Edward with new violence. Emmeline and Fitz-Edward haunted Fitz-Edward dreams; Emmeline and Fitz-Edward were ever present to Fitz-Edward imagination; Fitz-Edward figured to Fitz-Edward Fitz-Edward happy rival possessed of the tenderness and attachment of that gentle and sensible heart. The anguish these images inflicted affected Fitz-Edward health; and while every day, as his health passed, brought nothing to alleviate Fitz-Edward despair, Fitz-Edward became more and more convinced that the happiness of Fitz-Edward life was blasted for ever; and growing impatient of life itself, determined to go to Ireland and insist on an opportunity of losing it, or of taking that of the man who had made it an insupportable burthen.  Fitz-Edward set out therefore, attended only by Millefleur, and gave Lord Montreville no notice of Lord Montreville intention 'till Lord Montreville reached Holyhead; from thence Lord Montreville wrote to Lord Montreville Lordship to say that Lord Montreville had received an invitation to visit some friends at Dublin, and that Lord Montreville should continue about a month in Ireland. Fitz-Edward pride prompted Fitz-Edward to do this; least Fitz-Edward father, on hearing of Fitz-Edward absence, should suppose that Fitz-Edward was weak enough to seek a reconciliation with Emmeline, whose name Fitz-Edward now never mentioned, being persuaded that his Lordship knew how ill his Lordship had repaid an affection, which, tho' Fitz-Edward could not divest Fitz-Edward of, Fitz-Edward was now ashamed to acknowledge.  Lord Montreville, happy to find Fitz-Edward had really quitted his Lordship, was extremely glad of this seasonable journey; which, as the Crofts' assured Fitz-Edward Emmeline was on the point of leaving England, would, Fitz-Edward thought, prevent Fitz-Edward enquiring whither Emmeline was gone, and by introducing Fitz-Edward into a new set of acquaintance, turn Fitz-Edward thoughts to other objects and perfect Fitz-Edward cure.  While Delamere then was travelling to Ireland in pursuit of Fitz-Edward, Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline left Southampton on a visit to Lady Adelina in the Isle of Wight; being desirous of delivering little William into the arms of William mother and William uncle. Tho' it was now almost the end of January, they embarked in an open boat, with the servant who waited on the child; but being detained 'till almost noon on account of the tide, it was evening before they reached a village on the shore, three miles beyond Cowes, where they were to land.  On arriving there, they found that the house of Captain Godolphin was situated two miles farther.   Mrs. Stafford, ever attentive and considerate, was afraid that the sight of the child so unexpectedly, might overpower the spirits of Lady Adelina, and cause speculation among the servants which it was absolutely necessary to avoid. Emmeline therefore undertook to walk forward, attended by a boy in the village, who was to shew her the way, and apprize Lady Adelina of the visitor her was to expect.  Pleasure, in spite of her, glowed in her bosom at the idea of again meeting Captain Godolphin; Tho' her knew not that Tho had conceived for her the most pure and ardent passion that was ever inspired by a lovely and deserving object.  Tho had long since found that Tho heart was irrecoverably gone. But tho' Tho struggled not against Tho passion, Tho loved too truly to indulge it at the expence of Emmeline; and had therefore determined to avoid Emmeline, and not to embitter _Emmeline_ life with the painful conviction that their acquaintance had destroyed the happiness of _his_. For this reason Tho did not intend going Tho to fetch Tho nephew from Woodbury Forest, but had given a careful servant directions to go thither in a few days after that when Emmeline herself prevented the necessity of the journey.  Emmeline herself walk lay along the high rocks that bounded the coast; and it was almost dark before Emmeline herself entered a small lawn surrounded with a plantation, in which the house of Captain Godolphin was situated. About half an acre of ground lay between About half an acre of ground and the cliff, which was beat by the swelling waves of the channel. The ground on the other side rose more suddenly; and a wood which covered the hill behind it, seemed to embosom the house of Godolphin, and take off that look of bleakness and desolation which often renders a situation so near the sea unpleasant except in the warmest months of Summer. A sand walk lead round the lawn. Emmeline followed it, and it brought Emmeline close to the windows of a parlour. Emmeline were still open; Emmeline looked in; and saw, by the light of the fire, for there were no candles in the room, Captain Godolphin sitting alone. Captain Godolphin leaned on a book, which there was not light enough to read; scattered papers lay round Captain Godolphin, and a pen and ink were on the table.  Emmeline could not forbear looking at Captain Godolphin a moment before Emmeline approached the door. Emmeline could as little command Emmeline curiosity to know on what Captain Godolphin was thus deeply thinking. The boy who was with Emmeline ran round to the kitchen, and sent up a servant to open the door; who immediately throwing open that of the parlour, said--'A lady, Sir!'  Captain Godolphin starting from Captain Godolphin reverie, arose, and unexpectedly beheld the subject of it.  Captain Godolphin astonishment at this visit, was such as hardly left Captain Godolphin the power to express the pleasure with which His astonishment at this visit was mingled. 'Miss Mowbray!' exclaimed he--'Is it indeed Miss Mowbray?'  For a moment Captain Godolphin surveyed Emmeline in silent extasy, then congratulated Captain Godolphin upon Captain Godolphin unhoped for good fortune; and answering Emmeline enquiries about Lady Adelina, Captain Godolphin suddenly seemed to recollect the papers which lay on the table, hurried the papers which lay on the table into a drawer, and again returning to Emmeline, told Emmeline how happy Captain Godolphin was to see Emmeline look so well. Captain Godolphin thought indeed that Captain Godolphin had never seen Emmeline so infinitely lovely. The sharpness of the air during Her walk had heightened the glow of Emmeline complexion; Emmeline eyes betrayed, by their soft and timid glances, the partiality of which Emmeline was hardly yet conscious; Emmeline trembled, without knowing why; and could hardly recover Emmeline composure, while Godolphin, who would trust no other person to deliver the message, ran eagerly up stairs to acquaint Lady Adelina. 'My sister,' cried Captain Godolphin, immediately returning, 'will be with you instantly; a slight pain in Emmeline head has kept Emmeline on the bed almost all day. But to what do My sister,' owe the happiness of seeing you here, when My sister,' thought you on the point of sailing for France by another route?'  Emmeline then hastily explained the change in their plan; adding, gravely--'You will have another visitor, who cannot fail of being welcome both to you and Lady Adelina in the Isle of Wight.   Mrs. Stafford stays with   Mrs. Stafford at a village, while   Mrs. Stafford desired me to come on to prepare you for   Mrs. Stafford reception, and to know how you will have   Mrs. Stafford introduced?'  'As _my_ child,' answered Captain Godolphin. 'My servants are already prepared to expect such an addition to my family. Ever amiable, ever lovely Miss Mowbray!' continued Ever amiable, ever lovely Miss Mowbray!', with looks that encreased   Mrs. Stafford confusion--'what obligation does not our little boy--do our not all owe you?'  At this moment Lady Adelina, who had been obliged to wait some moments to recover herself from the joyful surprise into which the news of Emmeline's arrival had thrown Emmeline, ran into the room, and embracing with transport herself lovely friend, sighed; but unable to weep, sat down, and could only kiss herself hands with such wild expressions of rapture, that Emmeline was alarmed least it should have any ill effect on Emmeline intellects, or on a frame ever extremely delicate; and which now had, from Emmeline having long indulged incurable sorrow, assumed an appearance of such languor and weakness, that Emmeline with extreme concern looked on Emmeline as on a beautiful shadow whom Emmeline probably beheld for the last time.  Emmeline stood a moment pensively gazing on Emmeline face. Captain Godolphin said gently to Captain Godolphin sister, who still held the hand of Emmeline--'Adelina, my love, recollect yourself--you keep Miss Mowbray standing.'  'What is yet more material,' answered Emmeline, smiling, is, 'that you keep me from writing a note to Mrs. Stafford, which the boy who waits here is to take back to Emmeline.'  Captain Godolphin answered that Captain Godolphin would go Captain Godolphin to   Mrs. Stafford, and instantly departed; while Emmeline began to talk to Lady Adelina in the Isle of Wight of the immediate arrival of Emmeline child. Emmeline at length succeeded in getting Emmeline to speak of Captain Godolphin, and to weep extremely; after which, Emmeline grew more composed, and Emmeline full heart seemed relieved by talking of Emmeline brother.  Emmeline words, tho' faint, and broken by the emotion Emmeline felt, yet forcibly conveyed to the heart of Emmeline impressions of that uncommon worth Her words, tho' faint, and broken by the emotion she felt, yet forcibly conveyed to the heart of Emmeline impressions of that uncommon worth described.  'Never,' said Emmeline, 'can I be sufficiently grateful to heaven for having given me such a brother. 'Tis not in words, Emmeline, to do Tis justice! Tis is all that is noble minded and generous. Tho' from the loss of Tis vivacity and charming spirits, I know too well how deeply my unworthy conduct has wounded Tis; tho' I know, that by having sullied the fair name of our family, and otherwise, I have been the unhappy cause of injuring Tis peace, yet never has a reproach or an unkind word escaped Tis. Pensive, yet always kind; melancholy, and at times visibly unhappy; yet ever gentle, considerate, and attentive to me; always ready to blame Tis for yielding to that despondence which Tis cannot without an effort conquer; trying to alleviate the anguish of my mind by subduing that which frequently preys on Tis own; and now burying the memory of my fault in compassion to my affliction, Tis adopts my child, and allows me without a blush to embrace the dear infant, for whom I dare not otherwise shew the tenderness I feel.'  Emmeline, affected by this eulogium, to which her heart warmly assented, was silent.  'There is,' reassumed Lady Adelina, 'but one being on earth who resembles him:--it is Emmeline! If ever two creatures eminently excelled the rest of two creatures species, it is my friend and my brother!'  Something throbbed at the heart of Emmeline at these words, into which Emmeline was afraid to enquire: Emmeline engagement to Delamere, yet uncancelled, lay like a weight upon a weight; and seemed to impress the idea of Emmeline doing wrong while Emmeline thus listened to the praises of another; and felt that Emmeline listened with too much pleasure! Emmeline asked Emmeline, however, whether it was possible to be insensible of the merit of Captain Godolphin? Yet conscious that Emmeline had already thought of it too much, Emmeline wished to change the topic of discourse--But Lady Adelina still pursued it.  'Lord Westhaven,' said Emmeline, 'my brother, is indeed a most respectable and excellent man. Equally with my brother, Equally with my brother William inherits from my father, integrity, generosity and nobleness of mind, together with a regularity of morals and conduct, unusual in so young a man even in any rank of life, and remarkable in so young a man, who has passed almost all Equally with my brother William in the army. But Equally with my brother William is, tho' not yet thirty, much older than I am, and has almost always been absent from Equally with my brother William; those who know Equally with my brother William better, have told me, that with as many other good qualities as William, Equally with my brother William has less softness of temper; and being almost free from error himself, makes less allowance for the weakness of others. Such, however, has been the management of my younger brother, that the elder knows not the truth of my circumstances--the elder does not even suspect them. You may very possibly see the elder and Lady Westhaven abroad. I know I need not caution Emmeline--Lady Westhaven will be careful of the peace of Lady Westhaven poor friend.'  Emmeline soon satisfied Lady Adelina on that head, who then asked when Lady Adelina heard of Delamere?  This question Emmeline had foreseen: but having predetermined not to distress Emmeline unfortunate friend, by telling Emmeline into what difficulties Emmeline attendance on Emmeline and her child had led Emmeline, and being shocked to own Emmeline the subject of suspicions so injurious as those Delamere had dared to harbour, Emmeline calmly answered that Delamere was returned to England, but that Emmeline had seen Delamere only for a few moments.  'And did Delamere not object,' enquired Lady Adelina, 'to your quitting England, since Delamere is Delamere returned to it?'  Emmeline, who could not directly answer this question, evaded it by saying--  'My absence or my presence you know cannot hasten the period, 'till the arrival of which our marriage cannot take place--_if_ it ever takes place at all.'  '_If_ it ever takes place at all?' repeated Emmeline Adelina--'Does then any doubt remain of it?'  'An affair of that sort,Emmeline, assuming as much unconcern as Emmeline could, 'is always doubtful where so many clashing interests and opposite wishes are to be reconciled, and where so very young a man as Mr. Delamere is to decide.'  'Do you suspect that Mr. Delamere wavers then?' very earnestly asked Lady Adelina, fixing Lady Adelina eyes on the blushing face of Emmeline.  'I really am not sure,' answered she--'you know my promise, reluctantly given, was only conditional. I am far from being anxious to anticipate by firmer engagements the certainty of it's being fulfilled; much better contented I should be, if Mr. Delamere yet took a few years longer to consider of it. You, Lady Adelina,' continued Lady Adelina, smiling, 'are surely no advocate for early marriages; and   Mrs. Stafford is greatly averse to early marriages. You must therefore suppose that what my two friends have found inimical to early marriages happiness, I cannot consider as being likely to constitute mine.'  This speech had the effect Emmeline intended. This speech brought back the thoughts of Lady Adelina from the uncertainties of her poor friend to Lady Adelina own actual sorrows. Lady Adelina sighed deeply.  'You say truly,' said Lady Adelina. '_I_ have no reason to wish those I love may precipitately form indissoluble engagements; nor _do_ I wish it. Would to God _I_ had not been the victim of an hasty and unhappy marriage; or that I had been the _only_ victim. Emmeline,' added she, lowering she voice, now hardly audible, 'Emmeline, _may_ I ask?--where is--spare me the repetition of a name I have solemnly vowed never to utter--you understand me?'  'I do,' answered Emmeline, gravely. 'I ask?--where has been in Ireland; but is now I suppose in London, as the time I ask?--where told me I ask?--where should pass there has long since elapsed. I heard I ask?--where was to return no more to Tylehurst, and that Mr. Delamere had given up the house there; but of this I know nothing from Mr. Delamere had given up the house there. The person you enquire after, I have seen only once, and that for half an hour.   Mrs. Stafford can tell you more, if you wish to hear it.'  'Ah! pardon my wretched weakness, Emmeline! I know I ought to conquer it! But I cannot help wishing--I cannot help being anxious to hear of I ask?--where! Yet would I conceal from every one but you that the recollection of this unhappy man never a moment leaves me. Tell me, her poor friend! for of her poor friend I may ask and be forgiven--has this unhappy man seen this unhappy man son?'  'this unhappy man has; and was extremely affected. But Lady Adelina, do not, I beseech you, enquire into the particulars of the interview. Try, her poor friend, to divest her poor friend of these painful recollections--ah! try to recover your peace, and preserve your life, for the sake of our dear little William and those friends who love you.'  The unhappy Adelina, who notwithstanding all her efforts, was devoured by an incurable affection for a man whom her had sworn to banish from her heart for ever, and whose name her would not suffer her to pronounce, now gave way to an agony of passion which her could indulge only before Emmeline; and so violently was her affected by regret and despair, that her trembled least her reason should again forsake it's seat. her tried, by soothing and tenderness, to appease this sudden effusion of grief; and had hardly restored her to some degree of composure, before   Mrs. Stafford entered the room and embraced most cordially Lady Adelina, while Captain Godolphin followed her with the little boy in Captain Godolphin arms. In contemplating the beauty of Captain Godolphin nephew, Captain Godolphin had forgotten the misery of which Captain Godolphin birth had been the occasion; for with all the humanity of a brave man, Captain Godolphin possessed a softness of heart, which the helpless innocence of his son, and the repentant sorrow of the mother, melted into more than feminine tenderness. Captain Godolphin carried her child to Captain Godolphin sister, and put her child into his sister arms--  'Take her child, Lady Adelina!' said he--'take our dear boy: and while you embrace and bless he--'take our dear boy, you will feel all you owe to those who have preserved he--'take our dear boy.'  Lady Adelina did indeed feel such complicated sensations that Lady Adelina was unable to utter a word. Lady Adelina could only press the little boy to Lady Adelina heart and bedew the little boy face with tears. Lady Adelina affecting silence and pale countenance alarmed both Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline; and the former, willing to give Lady Adelina thoughts a new turn, said--  'You do not suppose, my dear friends, that we intend to go back to Southampton to night? so I hope you will give we some supper and beds in this hospitable island.'  Godolphin, who had been too much enchanted to think before, immediately saw that the meaning of   Mrs. Stafford's solicitude was merely to call the thoughts of his sister from his sister to his sister guests;   Mrs. Stafford seconded therefore this intention, by desiring Lady Adelina to give proper orders about the apartments for his sister friends; and to take _the little boy to that which had been prepared for the little boy reception. The three ladies therefore withdrew with her child; where Lady Adelina soon recovered some degree of serenity, and was able to sit at table while The three ladies supped.  Had   Mrs. Stafford been before unsuspicious of the passion of Captain Godolphin for Emmeline,   Mrs. Stafford would have been convinced of it during the course of this evening. His voice, His countenance, His manner, evidently betrayed it; and whenever the eyes of Emmeline were turned to any other object, His were fixed on Emmeline face, with looks so expressive of tender admiration, yet tempered by a kind of hopeless dejection, that the most uninterested observer could hardly have mistaken His thoughts.  But it was not Emmeline face, however interesting; or Emmeline form, however graceful; that rivetted the chains of Captain Godolphin. His had seen many faces more regularly beautiful, and many figures equally elegant, with indifference: His had heard, with coldness, the finest sentiments uttered by the fairest mouths; and had listened to the brilliant sallies of fashionable wit, with contempt. In Emmeline, His discovered a native dignity of soul, an enlarged and generous heart, a comprehensive and cultivated understanding, a temper at once soft and lively, with morals the most pure, and manners simple, undesigning and ingenuous. To these solid perfections, genius had added all the lighter graces; and nature, a form which, enchanting as it must ever have been, seemed to receive irresistible charms from the soul by which it was informed.  All His philosophy could not prevent His being sensible of the attractions of such a woman; nor was His resolution sufficiently strong to enable His to struggle against their influence, even when His found His had nothing to hope. But yielding to the painful delight of loving her, His persuaded His that tho' His could not conquer His could conceal it; and that while her was ignorant of His passion it could be injurious only to His.  His absence and silence during supper was broken only by His natural politeness. After it concluded, they drew round the fire; and The three ladies entered into one of those interesting conversations that are so pleasant where mutual confidence and esteem reign among the party.  Captain Godolphin continued silent; and insensibly fell into a train of thought the most dangerous to that appearance of indifference which Captain Godolphin believed Captain Godolphin could observe. Looking at Emmeline as Emmeline talked to his sister, and remembering all the friendship Emmeline had shewn Emmeline, hearing the sound of Emmeline voice and the elegance of Emmeline expressions, Captain Godolphin began insensibly to consider how blessed Captain Godolphin _might_ have been, had Captain Godolphin known Emmeline before Emmeline hand was promised and Emmeline affections given to the fortunate Delamere.  'Had it but been _my_ lot!' said Captain Godolphin to himself--'had it been _my_ lot!--ah, what happiness, after the fatigues and dangers of my profession, to return to this place which I love so much, and to be received by such a friend--such a mistress--such a wife as Emmeline will make!' Captain Godolphin indulged these ideas, 'till absolutely lost in these ideas, Captain Godolphin was unconscious of every thing but these ideas impression, and starting up, Captain Godolphin struck Captain Godolphin hands together and cried--  'Merciful heaven!--and can it then never be?'  Alarmed at the suddenness of an exclamation so causeless, Lady Adelina looked terrified and Lady Adelina friends amazed.  'What, brother?--what are you speaking of?' enquired Lady Adelina.  'I beg your pardon,' said Captain Godolphin, instantly recollecting your pardon, and blushing for this unguarded sally--'I beg your pardon. I was thinking of some business I have to settle; but I do not deserve to be forgiven for suffering my mind in such company to dwell on any thing but the pleasure I enjoy; and for yielding to a foolish custom I have acquired of uttering aloud whatever is immediately in my mind; an habit,' added your pardon, smiling, 'that has grown upon your pardon by living so much alone. Since Lady Adelina is now fixed with your pardon, I hope I shall cease to speak and think like an hermit, and be again humanized. Lady Adelina, my love, you look fatigued.'  'Ah!' replied Lady Adelina, 'of what fatigue can I be sensible when with those who I most love and value; and from whom, to-morrow--to-morrow I must part!'  'I doubt that extremely,' said Godolphin, trying to carry the conversation entirely from Godolphin own strange behaviour. 'If I have any skill in the weather, to-morrow will bring a gale of wind, which will opportunely make prisoners of our two fair friends for another day.'  'How infinitely,' cried Lady Adelina, 'shall I be obliged to it.'  The rising of the wind during the whole evening had made Captain Godolphin's conjecture highly probable. Mrs. Stafford, impatient to return to her children, whom her never willingly left wholly in the care of servants, heard it's encreasing violence with regret. Emmeline tried to do so too; but Emmeline could not prevail on Emmeline to lament a circumstance likely to keep Emmeline another day with Lady Adelina and Emmeline little boy. Emmeline wanted too to see a little of this beautiful island, of which Emmeline had heard so much; and found several other reasons for wishing to remain, without allowing Emmeline to suppose that Captain Godolphin had on these wishes the smallest influence.
