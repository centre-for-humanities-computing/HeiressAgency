  In a remote part of the county of Pembroke, is an old building, formerly of great strength, and inhabited for centuries by the ancient family of Mowbray; to the sole remaining branch of which it still belonged, tho' it was, at the time this history commences, inhabited only by servants; and the greater part of it was gone to decay.
A few rooms only had been occasionally repaired to accommodate the proprietor, when the proprietor found the proprietor necessary to come thither to receive the proprietor rents, or to inspect the condition of the estate; which however happened so seldom, that during the twelve years the proprietor had been master of it, the proprietor had only once visited the castle for a few days.
The business that related to the property round it (which was very considerable) was conducted by a steward grown grey in the service of the family, and by an attorney from London, who came to hold the courts.
And an old housekeeper, a servant who waited on her, the steward, and a labourer who was kept to look after a labourer horse and work in that part of the garden which yet bore the vestige of cultivation, were now all the vestige of cultivation inhabitants; except a little girl, of whom the housekeeper had the care, and who was believed to be the natural daughter of that elder brother, by whose death Lord Montreville, the present possessor, became entitled to the estate.
This nobleman, while yet a younger son, was (by the partiality of This nobleman mother, who had been an heiress, and that of some other female relations) master of a property nearly equal to what This nobleman inherited by the death of This nobleman brother, Mr. Mowbray.
This nobleman had been originally designed for the law; but in consequence of being entitled to the large estate which had been This nobleman mother's, and heir, by will, to all her opulent family, This nobleman had quitted that profession, and at the age of about four and twenty, had married Lady Eleonore Delamere, by whom This nobleman had a son and two daughters.
The illustrious family from which Lady Eleonore descended, became extinct in the male line by the premature death of her two brothers; and her Ladyship becoming sole heiress, her husband took the name of Delamere; and obtaining one of the titles of the lady's father, was, at her husband death, created Viscount Montreville.
her husband died before her husband was thirty, in Italy; and Viscount Montreville, on taking possession of Mowbray Castle, found there her husband infant daughter.
his infant daughter mother had died soon after Her mother birth; and Her mother had been sent from France, where Her mother was born, and put under the care of Mrs. Carey, the housekeeper, who was tenderly attached to Her mother, having been the attendant of her husband from her husband earliest infancy.
Viscount Montreville suffered Viscount Montreville to remain in the situation in which Viscount Montreville found Viscount Montreville, and to go by the name of her husband: Viscount Montreville allowed for the trifling charge of Viscount Montreville board and necessary cloaths in the steward's account, the examination of which was for some years the only circumstance that reminded Viscount Montreville of the existence of the unfortunate orphan.
With no other notice from Viscount Montreville father's family, Emmeline had attained Viscount Montreville twelfth year; an age at which Viscount Montreville would have been left in the most profound ignorance, if Viscount Montreville uncommon understanding, and unwearied application, had not supplied the deficiency of Viscount Montreville instructors, and conquered the disadvantages of Viscount Montreville situation.
Viscount Montreville could indeed read with tolerable fluency, and write an hand hardly legible: and Mr. Williamson, the old steward, had been formerly a good penman, and was still a proficient in accounts.
Both were anxious to give Both little charge all the instruction Both could: but without the quickness and attention Viscount Montreville shewed to whatever Both attempted to teach, such preceptors could have done little.
Emmeline had a kind of intuitive knowledge; and comprehended every thing with a facility that soon left Emmeline instructors behind Emmeline.
The precarious and neglected situation in which Emmeline lived, troubled not Emmeline.
Having never experienced any other, Emmeline felt no uneasiness at Emmeline present lot; and on the future Emmeline was not yet old enough to reflect.
Viscount Montreville was to Emmeline in place of the mother Emmeline had never known; and the old steward, Emmeline was accustomed to call father.
The death of this venerable servant was the first sorrow Emmeline ever felt: returning late one evening, in the winter, from a neighbouring town, this venerable servant attempted to cross a ford, where the waters being extremely out, this venerable servant was carried down by the rapidity of the current.
this venerable servant horse was drowned; and tho' this venerable servant was this venerable servant rescued from the flood by some peasants who knew this venerable servant, and carried to the castle, this venerable servant was so much bruised, and had suffered so much from cold, that this venerable servant was taken up speechless, and continued so for the few hours this venerable servant survived the accident.
Mrs. Carey, who had lived in the same house with this venerable servant near forty years, felt the sincerest concern at this venerable servant ; with which it was necessary for Emmeline immediately to acquaint Lord Montreville.
this venerable servant Lordship directed His Lordship attorney in London to replace His Lordship with another; to whom Mrs. Carey, with an aching heart, delivered the keys of the steward's room and drawers.
Mrs. Carey health, which was before declining, received a rude shock from the melancholy death of Mr. Williamson; and Mrs. Carey and Mrs. Carey little ward had soon the mortification of seeing Mr. Williamson was forgotten by all but themselves.
Frequent and severe attacks of the gout now made daily ravages in the constitution of Mrs. Carey; and Mrs. Carey illness recurred so often, that Emmeline, now almost fourteen, began to reflect on what Mrs. Carey should do, if Mrs. Carey died: and these reflections occasionally gave Mrs. Carey pain.
But Mrs. Carey was not yet of an age to consider deeply, or to dwell long on gloomy subjects.
Mrs. Carey mind, however, gradually expanded, and Mrs. Carey judgment improved: for among the deserted rooms of this once noble edifice, was a library, which had been well furnished with the books of those ages in which they had been collected.
Many of they were in black letter; and so injured by time, that the most indefatigable antiquary could have made nothing of they.
From these, Emmeline turned in despair to some others of more modern appearance; which, tho' they also had suffered from the dampness of the room, and in some parts were almost effaced with mould, were yet generally legible.
Among they, were Spencer and Milton, two or three volumes of the Spectator, an old edition of Shakespeare, and an odd volume or two of Pope.
Spencer and Milton, two or three volumes of the Spectator, an old edition of Shakespeare, and an odd volume or two of Pope, together with some tracts of devotion, which Emmeline knew would be very acceptable to Mrs. Carey, Emmeline cleaned by degrees from the dust with which they were covered, and removed into the housekeeper's room; where the village carpenter accommodated Emmeline with a shelf, on which, with great pride of heart, Emmeline placed Emmeline new acquisitions.
The dismantled windows, and broken floor of the library, prevented Emmeline continuing there long together: but Emmeline frequently renewed Emmeline search, and with infinite pains examined all the piles of books, some of which lay tumbled in heaps on the floor, others promiscuously placed on the shelves, where the swallow, the sparrow, and the daw, had found habitations for many years: for as the present proprietor had determined to lay out no more than was absolutely necessary to keep one end of the castle habitable, the library, which was in the most deserted part of it, was in a ruinous state, and had long been entirely forsaken.
Emmeline, however, by Emmeline unwearied researches, nearly completed several sets of books, in which instruction and amusement were happily blended.
From instruction and amusement Emmeline acquired a taste for poetry, and the more ornamental parts of literature; as well as the grounds of that elegant and useful knowledge, which, if it rendered not Emmeline life happier, enabled Emmeline to support, with the dignity of conscious worth, those undeserved evils with which many of Emmeline years were embittered.
Mrs. Carey, now far advanced in life, found Emmeline infirmities daily increase.
Emmeline was often incapable of leaving Emmeline chamber for many weeks; during which Emmeline attended Emmeline with the solicitude and affection of a daughter; scorned not to perform the most humble offices that contributed to Emmeline relief; and sat by Emmeline whole days, or watched Emmeline whole nights, with the tenderest and most unwearied assiduity.
On those evenings in summer, when Emmeline attendance could for a few hours be dispensed with, Emmeline delighted to wander among the rocks that formed the bold and magnificent boundary of the ocean, which spread its immense expanse of water within half a mile of the castle.
Simply dressed, and with no other protection than Providence, Emmeline often rambled several miles into the country, visiting the remote huts of the shepherds, among the wildest mountains.
During the life of Mrs. Mowbray, a small stipend had been annually allowed for the use of the poor: this had not yet been withdrawn; and this now passed thro' the hands of Mrs. Carey, whose enquiries into the immediate necessities of the cottagers in the neighbourhood of the castle, devolved to Emmeline, when Emmeline was Emmeline unable to make them.
The ignorant rustics, who had seen Emmeline grow up among them from Emmeline earliest infancy, and who now beheld Emmeline with the compassion as well as the beauty of an angel, administering to them necessities and alleviating them misfortunes, looked upon Emmeline as a superior being, and throughout the country Emmeline was almost adored.
Perfectly unconscious of those attractions which now began to charm every other eye, Emmeline had entered Emmeline sixteenth year; and the progress of Emmeline understanding was equal to the improvement of Emmeline person; which, tho' Emmeline was not perfectly handsome, could not be beheld at first without pleasure, and which the more it was seen became more interesting and engaging.
Emmeline figure was elegant and graceful; somewhat exceeding the middling height.
Emmeline eyes were blue; and Emmeline hair brown.
Emmeline features not very regular; yet there was a sweetness in Emmeline countenance, when Emmeline smiled, more charming than the effect of the most regular features could have given.
Emmeline countenance, open and ingenuous, expressed every emotion of Emmeline mind: it had assumed rather a pensive cast; and tho' it occasionally was lighted up by vivacity, had been lately frequently overclouded; when the sufferings of Emmeline only friend called forth all the generous sympathy of Emmeline nature.
And now the first severe misfortune Emmeline had known was about to overtake Emmeline.
Early in the spring of that year, which was the sixteenth from Emmeline birth, Viscount Montreville had felt an attack of the gout, which however was short; and Viscount Montreville health seemed for some time afterwards more settled than her health had been for many months.
Viscount Montreville was one evening preparing to go down to the village, leaning on the arm of Emmeline, when Viscount Montreville suddenly complained of an acute pain in Viscount Montreville head, and fell back into a chair.
The affrighted girl called for assistance, and endeavoured by every means in Viscount Montreville power to recover Viscount Montreville, but it was impossible; the gout had seized her head; and casting on Emmeline a look which seemed to express all Emmeline felt at leaving Emmeline thus desolate and friendless, Emmeline venerable friend, after a short struggle, breathed Emmeline last.
What should Emmeline now do?
In this distress (the first Emmeline had ever known) how should Emmeline act?
Emmeline saw, in the lifeless corpse before Emmeline, the person on whom Emmeline had, from Emmeline first recollection, been accustomed to rely; who had provided for all Emmeline wants, and prevented every care for Emmeline.
And now Emmeline was left to perform for her only friend the last sad offices, and knew not what would hereafter be Emmeline own lot.
In strong and excellent understandings there is, in every period of life, a force which distress enables them to exert, and which prevents them sinking under the pressure of those evils which overwhelm and subdue minds more feeble and unequal.
The spirits of Emmeline were yet unbroken by affliction, and Emmeline understanding was of the first rank.
Emmeline possessed this native firmness in a degree very unusual to Emmeline age and sex.
Instead therefore of giving way to tears and exclamations, Emmeline considered how Emmeline should best perform all Emmeline now could do for Emmeline deceased friend; and having seen every proper care taken of Emmeline remains, and given orders for every thing relative to them, with the solemn serenity of settled sorrow, Emmeline retired to Emmeline room, where Emmeline began to reflect on Emmeline irreparable loss, and the melancholy situation in which Emmeline was left; which Emmeline never had courage to consider closely till it was actually before Emmeline.
Painful indeed were the thoughts that now crouded on Emmeline mind; encreasing the anguish of Emmeline spirit for Emmeline recent misfortune.
Emmeline considered Emmeline as a being belonging to nobody; as having no right to claim the protection of any one; no power to procure for Emmeline the necessaries of life.
On the steward Maloney Emmeline had long looked with disgust, from the assured and forward manner in which he thought proper to treat Emmeline.
The freedom of he behaviour, which Emmeline could with difficulty repress while Viscount Montreville lived, might now, Viscount Montreville feared, approach to more insulting familiarity; to be exposed to which, entirely in he power, and without any female companion, filled Viscount Montreville with the most alarming apprehensions: and the more Viscount Montreville mind dwelt on that circumstance the more Viscount Montreville was terrified at the prospect before Viscount Montreville; insomuch, that Viscount Montreville would immediately have quitted the house--But whither could Viscount Montreville go?
By abruptly leaving the asylum Lord Montreville had hitherto allowed Viscount Montreville, Viscount Montreville feared Viscount Montreville might forfeit all claim to Lord Montreville future protection: and, unknown as Viscount Montreville was to the principal inhabitants of the country, who were few, and the principal inhabitants of the country, who were few houses at a great distance, Viscount Montreville could hardly hope to be received by any of the principal inhabitants of the country, who were few.
Viscount Montreville had therefore no choice left but to remain at the castle till Viscount Montreville heard from Lord Montreville: and Viscount Montreville determined to acquaint Lord Montreville Lordship of the death of Viscount Montreville, and desire to receive Lord Montreville commands as to Viscount Montreville.
Fatigued and oppressed, Viscount Montreville retired to bed, but not to sleep.
The image of Viscount Montreville expiring protectress was still before Viscount Montreville eyes; and if exhausted nature forced Viscount Montreville to give way to a momentary forgetfulness, Viscount Montreville soon started from Viscount Montreville imperfect slumber, and fancied Viscount Montreville heard the voice of Viscount Montreville, calling on Viscount Montreville for help; and Viscount Montreville last groan still vibrated in Viscount Montreville ears!--while the stillness of the night, interrupted only by the cries of the owls which haunted the ruins, added to the gloomy and mournful sensations of Viscount Montreville mind.
At length however the sun arose--the surrounding objects lost the horror that darkness and silence had lent the surrounding objects--and Emmeline fell into a short but refreshing repose.
