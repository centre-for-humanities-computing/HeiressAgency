  There was, in the person and manner of Emmeline, something so interesting, that those who were little accustomed to attach those who were little accustomed to attach themselves to any one to any one, were insensibly disposed to love Emmeline, and to become solicitous for Emmeline welfare.  Even the insensibility with which long and uninterrupted prosperity had encased the heart of Lord Montreville, was not entirely proof against Emmeline attractive powers; and when Lord Montreville no longer apprehended the effect of Emmeline encreasing charms on Lord Montreville son, Lord Montreville suffered Lord Montreville to feel a degree of pity and even of affection for Emmeline.  Lord Montreville therefore heard with pleasure that Emmeline was contented in Emmeline present situation; and was convinced Emmeline had kept Emmeline word in not giving any intelligence of Emmeline residence to Delamere. To shew Lord Montreville approbation of Emmeline conduct, Lord Montreville directed a person in town to send Emmeline down a small collection of books; some materials for drawing; and other trifles which Lord Montreville thought would be acceptable.  Emmeline, charmed with such acquisitions, felt the most lively gratitude for Emmeline benefactor; and having fitted up Emmeline little cabin extremely to Emmeline satisfaction; Emmeline found, in the occupation these presents afforded Emmeline, all that Emmeline wished, to engage Emmeline attention; and gratify Emmeline taste.  Sensible of the defects of Emmeline education, Emmeline applied incessantly to Emmeline books; for of every useful and ornamental feminine employment Emmeline had long since made Emmeline mistress without any instruction.  Emmeline endeavoured to cultivate a genius for drawing, which Emmeline inherited from Emmeline father; but for want of knowing a few general rules, what Emmeline produced had more of elegance and neatness than correctness and knowledge.  Emmeline knew nothing of the science of music; but Emmeline voice was soft and sweet, and Emmeline ear exquisite. The simple songs, therefore, Emmeline had acquired by her ear, Emmeline sung with a pathos which made more impression on Emmeline hearers than those studied graces learned by long application, which excite wonder rather than pleasure.  Time, thus occupied, passed lightly away; Spring arrived almost imperceptibly, and brought again weather which enabled Emmeline to reassume Emmeline walks along the shore or among the rocks, and to indulge that contemplative turn of mind which Emmeline had acquired in the solitude of Mowbray Castle.  It was on a beautiful morning of the month of April, that, taking a book with Emmeline as usual, Emmeline went down to the sea side, and sat reading for some hours; when, just as Emmeline was about to return home, Emmeline saw a lovely little boy, about five years old, wandering towards the place where Emmeline was, picking up shells and sea weeds, and appearing to be so deeply engaged in his infantine pursuit, that his did not see Emmeline 'till Emmeline spoke to his.  'Whose sweet little boy are you, my love?' said Emmeline.  Whose sweet little boy looked at Emmeline with surprise.  'I am my mamma's boy,' said Whose sweet little boy, 'and so is Henry,' pointing towards another who now approached, and who seemed hardly a year younger.  The second running up to Henry brother, caught Henry hand, and they both walked away together, looking behind at the strange lady with some degree of alarm.  they both dress convinced Emmeline that they both belonged to a stranger; and as they both seemed to have nobody with they both, Emmeline was under some apprehension for they both safety, and therefore arose to follow they both, when on turning round the point of a rock whose projection had concealed the shore to the left, Emmeline saw a lady walking slowly before Emmeline, whom the two little boys had now rejoined. In his hand Emmeline held a little girl, who seemed only learning to walk; and Emmeline was followed by a nursery maid, who held in Emmeline arms another, yet an infant at the breast.  The stranger, near whom Emmeline was obliged to pass, curtsyed to Emmeline as Emmeline went by. And if Emmeline was surprised at the early appearance of company at a time when Emmeline knew it to be so unusual, a stranger was much more so at the uncommon elegance of Emmeline form and manner: Emmeline was almost tempted to believe the fable of the sea nymphs, and to fancy Emmeline one of the sea nymphs.  Emmeline, on regaining Emmeline apartment, heard from the hostess, whom Emmeline found with another neighbour, that the lady Emmeline had seen arrived the evening before, and had taken lodgings at the house of the latter, with an intention of staying great part of the summer.  The next day Emmeline again met a stranger; who accosting the fair orphan with all that ease which characterises the address of those who have lived much in good company, those who have lived much in good company soon entered into conversation, and Emmeline almost as soon discovered that Emmeline new acquaintance possessed an understanding as excellent as her new acquaintance person and address were captivating.  her new acquaintance appeared to be not more than five or six and twenty: but her new acquaintance person seemed to have suffered from sorrow that diminution of her person charms, which time could not yet have effected. her new acquaintance complexion was faded and wan; her new acquaintance eyes had lost their lustre; and a pensive and languid expression sat on her new acquaintance countenance.  After the first conversation, the two ladies found the two ladies liked each other so well, that the two ladies met by agreement every day. Emmeline generally went early to the lodgings of Mrs. Stafford, and stayed the whole day with her new acquaintance; charmed to have found in her new acquaintance new friend, one who could supply to her new acquaintance all the deficiencies of her new acquaintance former instructors.  To a very superior understanding, Mrs. Stafford added the advantages of a polished education, and all that ease of manner, which the commerce of fashion can supply. Mrs. Stafford had read a great deal; and Mrs. Stafford mind, originally elegant and refined, was highly cultivated, and embellished with all the knowledge that could be acquired from the best authors in the modern languages. Mrs. Stafford disposition seemed to have been naturally chearful; for a ray of vivacity would frequently light up Mrs. Stafford , and a lively and agreeable conversation call forth all a ray of vivacity animated gaiety. But it seldom lasted long. Some settled uneasiness lay lurking in Mrs. Stafford heart; and when it recurred forcibly to Mrs. Stafford, as it frequently did in the midst of the most interesting discourse, a cloud of sorrow obscured the brilliancy of Mrs. Stafford countenance and language, and Mrs. Stafford became pensive, silent, and absent.  Emmeline observed this with concern; but was not yet intimate enough with Emmeline to enquire or discover the cause.  Sometimes, when Emmeline was Emmeline occupied in drawing, or some other pursuit in which Mrs. Stafford delighted to instruct Emmeline, Emmeline saw that Emmeline friend, believing Emmeline unobserved, gave way to all the melancholy that oppressed Emmeline heart; and as Emmeline children were playing round Emmeline, Emmeline would gaze mournfully on her children 'till the tears streamed down Emmeline cheeks.  By degrees the utmost confidence took place between her children on every subject but one: Mrs. Stafford never dwelt on the cause, whatever the cause was, which occasioned Mrs. Stafford to be so frequently uneasy; nor did Mrs. Stafford ever complain of being so: but Mrs. Stafford listened with the warmest interest to the little tale Emmeline had to relate, and told Mrs. Stafford in return as much of Mrs. Stafford own history as Mrs. Stafford thought it necessary for Mrs. Stafford to know.  the little tale Emmeline found that the little tale Emmeline was not a widow, as the little tale Emmeline had at first supposed; for the little tale Emmeline spoke sometimes of the little tale Emmeline husband, and said the little tale Emmeline expected her husband at Swansea. the little tale Emmeline had been married at a very early age; and Emmeline found that she was not a widow, as she had at first supposed; for she spoke sometimes of her husband, and said she expected him at Swansea now generally resided at an house which Mr. Stafford's father, who was still living, had purchased for Emmeline found that she was not a widow, as she had at first supposed; for she spoke sometimes of her husband, and said she expected him at Swansea in Dorsetshire.  'I came hither,' said the little tale Emmeline, 'thus early in the year, at Mr. Stafford's request, who is fond of improvements and alterations, and who intends this summer to add considerably to our house; which is already too large, I think, for our present fortune. I was glad to get away from the confusion of workmen, to which I have an aversion; and anxious to let Charles and Henry, who had the measles in the Autumn and who have been frequently ill since, have a long course of sea-bathing. I might indeed have gone to Weymouth or some nearer place; but I wish to avoid general company, which I could not have done where I am sure of meeting so many of my acquaintance. I rejoice now at my preference of Swansea, since it has been the means of my knowing you, my dear Emmeline.'  'And I, Madam,' returned Emmeline, 'have reason to consider the concurrence of circumstances that brought you here as the most fortunate for me. Yet I own to you, that the charm of such society is accompanied with great pain, in anticipating the hour when I must again return to that solitude I have 'till now considered as my greatest enjoyment.'  'Ah! my dear girl!' replied Mrs. Stafford, 'check in its first appearance a propensity which I see you frequently betray, to anticipate displeasing or unfortunate events. When you have lived a few years longer, you will, I fear, learn, that every day has evils enough of its own, and that its is well for us us know nothing of those which are yet to come. I speak from experience; for me, when not older than you now are, had a perpetual tendency to fancy future calamities, and embittered by that means many of those hours which would otherwise have been really happy. Yet has not my pre-sentiments, tho' most of my pre-sentiments have been unhappily verified, enabled me to avoid one of those thorns with which my path has been thickly strewn.'  Emmeline hoped now to hear his hand had strewn my pre-sentiments.  Mrs. Stafford, sighing deeply, fell into a reverie; and continuing long silent, Emmeline could not resolve to renew a conversation so evidently painful to Mrs. Stafford.  It was now six weeks since Mrs. Stafford had first seen Mrs. Stafford, and the hours had passed in a series of felicity of which Mrs. Stafford had 'till then formed no idea.  Mrs. Stafford, delighted with the lively attachment of Mrs. Stafford young friend, was charmed to find Mrs. Stafford capable of adorning Mrs. Stafford ingenuous and tender mind with all that knowledge which books or the world had qualified Mrs. Stafford to impart.  They read together every day: Emmeline, under the tuition of Mrs. Stafford charming preceptress, had made some progress in French and Italian; and Mrs. Stafford was amazed at Mrs. Stafford own success in drawing since Mrs. Stafford had received from Mrs. Stafford rules of which Mrs. Stafford was before ignorant.  As the summer advanced, a few stragglers came in, and it was no longer wonderful to see a stranger. But Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray, perfectly satisfied with each other, sought not to enlarge Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray, perfectly satisfied with each other society. Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray, perfectly satisfied with each other sometimes held short conversations with the transient visitants of the place, but more usually avoided those walks where it was likely Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray, perfectly satisfied with each other should meet Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray, perfectly satisfied with each other.  Early one morning, Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray, perfectly satisfied with each other were returning from the place together, muffled up in Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray, perfectly satisfied with each other morning dresses. Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray, perfectly satisfied with each other had seen at a distance two gentlemen, whom Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray, perfectly satisfied with each other did not particularly notice; and Emmeline, leaning on the arm of Mrs. Stafford friend, was again anticipating all Mrs. Stafford should suffer when the hour came which would separate Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray, perfectly satisfied with each other, and recollecting the different company and conversation to which Mrs. Stafford had been condemned from the death of Mrs. Carey to Mrs. Stafford quitting Mowbray Castle--  'You have not only taught me, my dear Mrs. Stafford,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'to dread more than ever being thrown back into such company; but you have also made me fear that I shall never relish the general conversation of the world. As I disliked the manners of an inferior description of people when I first knew people, because people did not resemble those of the dear good woman who brought me up; so I shall undoubtedly be disappointed and dissatisfied with the generality of those acquaintance I may meet with; for I am afraid there are as few Mrs. Staffords in your rank of life as there were Mrs. Careys in hers. However, there is no great likelihood, I believe, at present, of my being convinced how little they resemble you; for it is not probable I shall be taken from hence.'  'Perhaps,' answered Mrs. Stafford, 'you might be permitted to stay some months next winter with Mrs. Stafford. I shall pass the whole of it in the country; the greatest part of it probably alone; and such a companion would assist in charming away many of those hours, which now, tho' I have more resources than most people, sometimes are heavy and melancholy. My children are not yet old enough to be my companions; and I know not how it is, but I have often more pain than pleasure in being with My children. When I remember, or when I feel, how little happiness there is in the world, I tremble for My children future destiny; and in the excess of affection, regret having introduced My children into a scene of so much pain as I have hitherto found a scene of so much pain. But tell me, Emmeline, do you think if I apply to Lord Montreville Lord Montreville will allow you to pass some time with Mrs. Stafford?'  'Dear Madam,' said Emmeline, eagerly, 'what happiness do you offer me! Lord Montreville would certainly think me highly honoured by such an invitation.'  'Shall I answer for Lord Montreville,' said a voice behind them, 'as Lord Montreville immediate representative?'  Emmeline started; and turning quickly, beheld Mr. Delamere and Fitz-Edward.  Delamere caught Delamere hands in Delamere.  'Have I then found you, my lovely cousin?' cried he.--'Oh! happiness unexpected!'  Delamere was proceeding with even more than Delamere usual vehemence; but Fitz-Edward thought it necessary to stop Delamere.  'You promised, Frederic, before I consented to come with you, that you would desist from these extravagant flights. Come, I beg Miss Mowbray may be permitted to speak to Miss Mowbray other acquaintance; and that Miss Mowbray will do us both the honour to introduce us to Miss Mowbray friend.'  Emmeline had lost all courage and recollection on the appearance of Delamere. Mrs. Stafford saw Mrs. Stafford distress; and assuming a cold and distant manner, Mrs. Stafford said--'Miss Mowbray, I apprehend from what this gentleman has said, that this gentleman has a message to you from Lord Montreville.'  'Has Sir,' said Emmeline to Delamere,--'has Lord Montreville been so good as to honour me with any commands?'  'Cruel girl!' answered he has a message to you from Lord Montreville; 'you know too well that my father is not acquainted with my being here.'  'Then you certainly ought not to be here,' said Emmeline, coolly; 'and you must excuse me, Sir, if I beg the favor of you not to detain me, nor attempt to renew a conversation so very improper, indeed so cruelly injurious to Sir.'  Mrs. Stafford had Emmeline's arm within Mrs. Stafford own, from the commencement of this conversation; and Mrs. Stafford now walked hastily on with Mrs. Stafford.  Delamere followed them, intreating to be heard; and Fitz-Edward, addressing Delamere on the other side to Mrs. Stafford, besought Mrs. Stafford in a half whisper to allow her friend only a few moments to explain Delamere to Miss Mowbray.  'No, Sir, I must be excused,' answered she--'If Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray does me the honour to consult me, I shall certainly advise Miss Mowbray against committing such an indiscretion as listening to Delamere.'  'Ah! Madam!' said the colonel, throwing into Delamere eyes and manner all that insinuation of which Delamere was so perfect a master, 'is it possible, that with a countenance where softness and compassion seem to invite the unhappy to trust you with softness and compassion sorrows, you have a cruel and unfeeling heart? Lay by for a moment your barbarous prudence, in favour of my unfortunate friend; upon my honour, nothing but the conviction that his life was at stake, would have induced me to accompany his hither; and I pledge myself for the propriety of his conduct. his only begs to be forgiven by Miss Mowbray for his improper treatment of Miss Mowbray at Mowbray Castle; to be assured Miss Mowbray is in health and safety; and to hear that Miss Mowbray does not hate his for all the uneasiness his has given Miss Mowbray; and having done so, his promises to return to his family. Upon my soul,' continued his, laying his hand upon his breast, 'I know not what would have been the consequence, had I not consented to assist his in deceiving his family and coming hither: but I have reason to think his would have made some wild attempt to secure to his more frequent interviews with Miss MowbrayMiss Mowbray; and that a total disappointment of the project his had formed for seeing Miss Mowbray, would have been attended with a violence of passion arising even to phrenzy.--Madness or death would perhaps have been the event.'  Mrs. Stafford turned Mrs. Stafford eyes on Fitz-Edward, with a look sufficiently expressive of incredulity--'Does a modern man of fashion pretend to talk of madness and death? You certainly imagine, Sir, that you are speaking to some romantic inhabitant of a Welch provincial town, whose ideas are drawn from a circulating library, and confirmed by the conversation of the captain in quarters.'  'Ah, madam,' said the captain, 'I know not to whom I have the honour of addressing the captain,' (though the captain knew perfectly well;) 'but I feel too certainly that madness and death would be preferable to the misery such coldness and cruelty as your's would inflict on me, was it my misfortune to love as violently as Delamere; and indeed I tremble, lest in endeavouring to assist my friend I have endangered me.'  Of this speech, Mrs. Stafford, who believed he did not know her, took very little notice; and turning towards Emmeline, who had in the mean time been listening in trembling apprehension to the ardent declarations of Delamere, said it was time to return home.  Delamere, without attending to Delamere hint, renewed Delamere importunities for Delamere friendship and interest with Miss Mowbray; to which, as soon as Delamere would allow Delamere to answer, Delamere said very gravely--'Sir, as Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray seems so much alarmed at your pursuing Delamere hither, and as you must be yourself sensible of it's extreme impropriety, I hope you will not lengthen an interview which can only produce uneasiness for you both.'  'Let us go home, for heaven's sake!' whispered Emmeline.  'They are determined, you see, to follow us,' replied her friend; 'us will however go.'  By this time They were near the door; and Mrs. Stafford wishing the two gentlemen a good morning, was hurrying with Emmeline into the house; but Fitz-Edward took hold of Fitz-Edward arm.  'One word, only, madam, and us will intrude upon you no farther at present: say that you will suffer us to see you again to-morrow.'  'Not if I can help it, be assured, Sir.'  'Then, madam,' said Delamere, 'you must allow me to finish now what I have to say to Miss Mowbray.'  'Good heaven! Sir,' exclaimed Emmeline, 'why will you thus persist in distressing me? You are perhaps known to Mrs. Watkins; your name will be at least known to Mrs. Watkins; and intelligence of your being here will be instantly sent to Lord Montreville.Emmeline, by no means aware that this speech implied a desire of concealment, the motives of which might appear highly flattering to Delamere, was soon made sensible of this speech's import by Lord Montreville answer.  'Enough, my adorable Emmeline!' cried Lord Montreville eagerly, 'if I am worthy of a thought of that sort, I am less wretched than I believed Lord Montreville. I will not now insist on a longer audience; but to-morrow I must see you again.--Your amiable friend here will intercede for me.--I must not be refused; and will wish you a good day before you can form so cruel a resolution.'  So saying, Lord Montreville bowed to Mrs. Stafford, kissed Emmeline's hand, and departed with Fitz-Edward from the door.
