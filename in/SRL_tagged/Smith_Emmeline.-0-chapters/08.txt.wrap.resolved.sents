  The two fair friends no sooner entered the house, than Emmeline threw Emmeline into a chair, and burst into tears.
'Ah!
my dear madam,' said my dear madam, sobbing, 'what will now become of my dear madam?
Lord Montreville will believe I have corresponded with Lord Montreville son; Lord Montreville will withdraw all favour and confidence from my dear madam; and I shall be undone!'
'Do not thus distress yourself,' said my dear madam, tenderly taking my dear madam hand--'I hope the rash and cruel conduct of this young man will not have the consequences you apprehend.
Lord Montreville, from your former conduct, will easily credit your not having encouraged this visit.'
'Ah!
my dear Mrs. Stafford,' replied Emmeline, 'you do not know Lord Montreville.
Lord Montreville hastily formed a notion that I made an appointment with Mr. Delamere at Mowbray Castle, when I had not even seen Lord Montreville above once; and though, from my eagerness to leave it, I believe Lord Montreville afterwards thought Lord Montreville had been too hasty, yet so strong was that first impression, that the slightest circumstance would, I know, renew it as forcibly as ever: for Lord Montreville has one of those tempers, which having once entertained an idea of a person's conduct or character, never really alters it, though a person's conduct or character see the most convincing evidence of it's fallacy.
Having once supposed I favoured the addresses of Mr. Delamere, as you know Mr. Delamere did, at Mowbray Castle, this visit will convince Mr. Delamere Mr. Delamere was right, and that I am the most artful as well as the most ungrateful of beings.'
Mrs. Stafford hesitated a moment, and then said, 'I see all the evil you apprehend.
To convince Lord Montreville, and your total rejection of Lord Montreville clandestine addresses, suppose I were to write to Lord Montreville?
Lord Montreville must be prejudiced and uncandid indeed, if after such information Lord Montreville is not convinced of your innocence.'
To this proposal, Emmeline consented, with assurances of the liveliest gratitude; and Mrs. Stafford returning to Mrs. Stafford lodgings, wrote the following letter to Lord Montreville:                                                      _Swansea, June 20._    'My Lord,      'A short abode at this place, has given me the pleasure of knowing   Miss Mowbray, to whose worth and prudence I am happy to bear   testimony.
At the request of this amiable young woman, I am now to   address your Lordship with information that Mr. Delamere came hither   yesterday with Mr. Fitz-Edward, and has again renewed those   addresses to Miss Mowbray which this amiable young woman knows to be so disagreeable to your Lordship, and which cannot but be extremely prejudicial to this amiable young woman.
Circumstanced as this amiable young woman is at this place, this amiable young woman cannot entirely avoid   Mr. Delamere; but this amiable young woman hopes your Lordship will be convinced how truly this amiable young woman   laments the pain this improper conduct of Mr. Delamere will give   you, and this amiable young woman loses not a moment in beseeching you to write to Mr. Delamere,   or otherwise to interfere, in prevailing on Mr. Delamere to quit Swansea; and   to prevent Mr. Delamere continuing to distress this amiable young woman by a pursuit so unwelcome   to you, and so injurious to this amiable young woman honour and repose.
I have the honour to be,                                                          my Lord,                                                     your Lordship's                                                most obedient servant,                                                           C.
STAFFORD.'
This letter being extremely approved of by Emmeline, was put into the next day's post; and the two ladies set out for their walk at a very early hour, flattering their their should return before Delamere and Fitz-Edward (who was lately raised to the rank of lieutenant-colonel) were abroad.
But in this their deceived their.
their were again overtaken by their importunate pursuers, who had now agreed to vary the mode of their attack.
Fitz-Edward, who knew the power of Fitz-Edward insidious eloquence over the female heart, undertook to plead for Fitz-Edward friend to Emmeline, while Delamere was to try to interest Mrs. Stafford, and engage Mrs. Stafford good offices in Fitz-Edward behalf.
Delamere was to try to interest Mrs. Stafford, and engage her good offices in his behalf no sooner joined the ladies, than Delamere said to the latter--'After the discouraging reception of yesterday, nothing but being persuaded that your heart will refuse to confirm the rigour you think yourself obliged to adopt, could make me venture, Madam, to solicit your favour with Miss Mowbray.
I now warmly implore your favour; and surely'----  'Can you believe, Sir,' said Mrs. Stafford, interrupting Sir, 'that _I_ shall ever influence Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray to listen to Sir; knowing, as I do, the aversion of your family to your entertaining any honourable views?
and having reason to believe you have Sir formed those that are very different?'
'You have no reason to believe so, Madam,' interrupted Delamere in Delamere turn; 'and must wilfully mistake me, as an excuse for your cold and unkind manner of treating me.
By heaven!
I love Emmeline with a passion as pure as it is violent; and if she would but consent to it, will marry she in opposition to all the world.
Assist me then, dear and amiable Mrs. Stafford!
assist me to conquer the unreasonable prejudice she has conceived against a secret marriage!'
'Never, Sir, will I counsel Miss Mowbray to accept such a proposal!
never will I advise she to unite she with one whose family disdain to receive she!
and by clandestinely stealing into it, either disturb it's peace, or undergo the humiliation of living the wife of a man who dares not own she!'
'And who, Madam, has said that I dare not own she?
Does not the same blood run in our veins?
Is she not worthy, from she personal merit, of a throne if I had a throne to offer she?
And do you suppose I mean to sacrifice the happiness of my whole life to the narrow policy or selfish ambition of my father?'
'Wait then, Sir, 'till time shall produce some alteration in your favour.
Emmeline is yet very young, too young indeed to marry.
Perhaps, when Lord and Lady Montreville are convinced that Lady Montreville only can make you happy, Lord and Lady Montreville may consent to your union.'
'You little know, Madam, the hopelessness of such an expectation.
Were it possible that any arguments, any motives could engage my father to forego all the projects of aggrandizing my father family by splendid and rich alliances, my mother will, I know, ever be inexorable.
my mother will not hear the name of Emmeline.
Last winter my mother incessantly persecuted me with proposals of marriage, and is now bent upon persuading me to engage my hand to Miss Otley, a relation of my mother own, who possesses indeed an immense fortune, and is of rank; but who of all women living would make me the most miserable.
The fatigueing arguments I have heard about this match, and the fruitless and incessant solicitude of my mother, convince me I cannot, for both our sakes, too soon put an end to it.'
my mother, notwithstanding the vehement plausibility of Delamere, still declined giving to Emmeline such advice as he wished to engage my mother to offer; and tho' aware of all the advantages such a marriage would procure my mother friend, my mother would not influence my mother to a determination my mother heart could not approve.
While Delamere therefore was pleading vainly to my mother, Fitz-Edward was exhausting in Fitz-Edward discourse with Emmeline, all that rhetoric on behalf of Fitz-Edward friend, which had already succeeded so frequently for Fitz-Edward.
Tho' Fitz-Edward had given way to Delamere's eagerness, and had accompanied Fitz-Edward in pursuit of Miss Mowbray, after a few feeble arguments against it, Fitz-Edward never intended to encourage Fitz-Edward in Fitz-Edward resolution of marrying her; which Fitz-Edward thought a boyish and romantic plan, and one, of which Fitz-Edward would probably be weary before it could be executed.
But as it was a military maxim, that in love and war all stratagems are allowable, Fitz-Edward failed not to lay as much stress on the honourable intentions of Delamere, as if Fitz-Edward had really meant to assist in carrying them into effect.
Emmeline heard Fitz-Edward in silence: or when an answer of some kind seemed to be extorted from Emmeline, Emmeline told Fitz-Edward that Emmeline referred Emmeline entirely to Mrs. Stafford, and would not even speak upon the subject but before Emmeline, and as Emmeline should dictate.
In this way several meetings passed between Delamere, the colonel, and the two ladies; for unless the latter had wholly confined the two ladies, there was no possible way of avoiding the importunate assiduity of the gentlemen.
Fitz-Edward had a servant who was an adept in such commissions, and who was kept constantly on the watch; so that they were traced and followed, in spite of all they endeavours to avoid it.
Mrs. Stafford, however, persuaded Emmeline to be less uneasy at it, as Emmeline assured Emmeline Emmeline would never leave Emmeline; and that there could be no misrepresentation of Emmeline conduct while they were together.
Every day they expected some consequence from Mrs. Stafford's letter to Lord Montreville; but for ten days, though they had heard nothing, they satisfied they with conjectures.
Ten days more insensibly passed by; and they began to think it very extraordinary that your Lordship your Lordship should give no attention to an affair, which only a few months before seemed to have occasioned your Lordship so much serious alarm.
In this interval, Delamere saw Emmeline every day; and Fitz-Edward, on behalf of Delamere friend's views, attached Delamere to Mrs. Stafford with an attention as marked and as warm as that of Delamere towards Miss Mowbray.
Delamere was well aware of the power a woman of Mrs. Stafford understanding must have over an heart like Emmeline's; so new to the world, so ingenuous, and so much inclined to indulge all the delicious enthusiasm of early friendship.
Delamere had had a slight acquaintance with Mrs. Stafford when Mrs. Stafford was first married; and knew enough of Mrs. Stafford husband to be informed of the source of that dejection, which, through all Mrs. Stafford endeavours to conceal it, frequently appeared; and having lived always among those who consider attachments to married women as allowable gallantries, and having had but too much success among married women, Fitz-Edward thought Fitz-Edward could take advantage of Mrs. Stafford's situation, to entangle Mrs. Stafford in a connection which would make Mrs. Stafford more indulgent to the weakness of Mrs. Stafford friend for Delamere.
But such was the awful, yet simple dignity of Mrs. Stafford manner, and so sacred the purity of unaffected virtue, that Fitz-Edward dared not hazard offending Mrs. Stafford; while aware of the tendency of Fitz-Edward flattering and incessant assiduity, Mrs. Stafford was always watchful to prevent any diminution of the respect Mrs. Stafford had a right to exact; and without affecting to shun Fitz-Edward society, which was extremely agreeable, Mrs. Stafford never suffered Fitz-Edward to assume, in Fitz-Edward conversation with Mrs. Stafford, those freedoms which often made Fitz-Edward admired by others; nor allowed Fitz-Edward to avow that libertinism of principle which Mrs. Stafford lamented that Fitz-Edward possessed.
Fitz-Edward, who had at first undertaken to entertain Mrs. Stafford merely with a view of favouring Delamere's conversation with Emmeline, almost imperceptibly found that it had charms on his own account.
his could not be insensible of the graces of a mind so highly cultivated; and his felt his admiration mingled with a reverence and esteem of which his had never before been sensible: but his vanity was piqued at the coldness with which Mrs. Stafford received his studied and delicate adulation; and, for the first time in his life, his was obliged to acknowledge to his, that there might be a woman whose mind was superior to it's influence.
Not being disposed very tranquilly to submit to this mortifying conviction, his became more anxious to secure that partiality from Mrs. Stafford, which, since his found it so hard to acquire, became necessary to his happiness; and, in the hope of obtaining it, his would probably long have persisted, had not his attention been soon afterwards diverted to another object.
it wanted only a few days of a month since Mrs. Stafford's letter was dispatched to Lord Montreville.
But the carelessness of the servant who was left in charge of the house in Berkley-square was the only reason of the servant who was left in charge of the house in Berkley-square not noticing it.
Immediately after the birth-day, the servant who was left in charge of the house in Berkley-square had quitted London on a visit to a nobleman in Buckinghamshire, whither your Lordship son had attended his son, and where they parted.
Delamere, under pretence of seeing his son friend Percival, really went into Berkshire; and Lord Montreville, having insisted on Delamere's joining his son at the house of Lady Mary Otley, beyond Durham, where Lord Montreville and Lord Montreville two daughters were already gone, set out his son for that place, where Lady Montreville and her two daughters intended to pass the months of July and August.
his son had many friends to visit on the road; and when his son your Lordship arrived there, your Lordship found all your Lordship letters had, instead of following your Lordship as your Lordship had directed, been sent immediately thither; and instead of finding your Lordship son, or an account of his son intended arrival, his son had the mortification of reading Mrs. Stafford's information.
Delamere had, indeed, passed a few days with Mr. Percival, and had written to Mr. Percival father from thence; but Mr. Percival had also seen Headly, from whom Mr. Percival had extorted the secret of Emmeline's residence.
Fitz-Edward, to whose sister Mr. Percival was lately married, had joined Delamere at the house of Delamere brother-in-law: and Delamere persisting in Delamere resolution of seeing Emmeline, had, without much difficulty, prevailed on Fitz-Edward, (who had some weeks on Delamere hands before Delamere was to join Delamere regiment in Ireland, and who had no aversion to any plan that looked like an intrigue) to accompany Delamere.
They contrived to gain Mr. Percival: and Delamere, by inclosing letters to Delamere, which were forwarded to his father as if Delamere had been still there, imagined that Delamere had prevented all probability of discovery.
Could Delamere have persuaded Emmeline to a Scottish marriage, (which Delamere very firmly believed Delamere should) Delamere intended as soon as they were married, to have taken Emmeline to the house of Lady Mary OtleyLady Mary Otley, and to have presented Emmeline to Delamere father, Delamere mother, Delamere sisters, and Lady Mary and Lady Mary daughter, who were also Delamere relations, as Delamere wife.
Lord Montreville, on reading Mrs. Stafford's letter, shut Lord Montreville up in Lord Montreville own apartment to consider what was to be done.
Lord Montreville knew Delamere too well to believe that writing, or the agency of any other person, would have on Lord Montreville the least effect.
Lord Montreville was convinced therefore Lord Montreville must go Lord Montreville; yet to return immediately, without giving Lord Montreville some very good reason, was impossible; nor could Lord Montreville think of any that would content Lord Montreville, but the truth.
Though Lord Montreville would very willingly have concealed from Lord Montreville what had happened, Lord Montreville was obliged to send for Lord Montreville, and communicate to Lord Montreville the intelligence received from Mrs. Stafford.
Lord Montreville Ladyship, whose pride was, if possible, more than adequate to Lord Montreville high blood, and whose passions were as strong as Lord Montreville reason was feeble, received this information with all those expressions of rage and contempt which Lord Montreville had foreseen.
Though the conduct of Emmeline was such as all Emmeline prejudice could not misunderstand, Emmeline loaded Emmeline with harsh and injurious appellations, and blamed your Lordship your Lordship for having fostered a little reptile, who was now likely to disgrace and ruin the family to which Emmeline pretended to belong.
Emmeline protested, that if Delamere dared to harbour so degrading an idea as that of marrying Emmeline, Emmeline would blot your Lordship for ever from Emmeline affection, and if possible from Emmeline memory.
Lord Montreville was obliged to wait 'till the violence of Emmeline first emotion had subsided, before Lord Montreville ventured to propose going Lord Montreville to recall Delamere.
To this proposal, however, Emmeline Ladyship agreed; and when Emmeline became a little cooler, consented readily to conceal, if possible, from Lady Mary Otley, the reason of Lord Montreville's abrupt departure, which was fixed for the next day; for the knowledge of this proposal could not have any good effect on the sentiments of Lady Mary and Lady Mary daughter; the former of whom was at present as anxious as Lord Montreville for an union of whom families.
After some farther reflection, Lord Montreville thought that as Delamere was extremely fond of Lord Montreville youngest sister, Emmeline influence might be of great use in detaching Lord Montreville from Lord Montreville pursuit.
It was therefore settled that Emmeline should accompany Lord Montreville your Lordship; making the most plausible story they could, to account for a departure so unexpected; and leaving Lord Montreville and Miss Delamere as pledges of Lady Montreville and Miss Delamere intended return, Lord Montreville and Lord Montreville daughter Augusta set out post for London, in Lady Montreville and Miss Delamere way to Swansea.
