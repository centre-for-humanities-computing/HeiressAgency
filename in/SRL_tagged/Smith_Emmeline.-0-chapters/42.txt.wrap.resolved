  The Baron de St. Alpin was a venerable soldier, near sixty, in whom the natural roughness of   The Baron de St. Alpin was a venerable soldier, near sixty, in whom the natural roughness of his country was polished by a long residence among the French country was polished by a long residence among the French.   The Baron de St. Alpin was a venerable soldier, near sixty, in whom the natural roughness of his country was polished by a long residence among the French was extremely good humoured and chearful, and passionately fond of the Chevalier de Bellozane, who was the youngest of three sons, the two elder of whom had fallen in the field. The military ardour however of the Baron had not been buried with three sons; and the Baron still entrusted the sole survivor of the Baron house, and the last support of the Baron hopes, in the same service.  With infinite satisfaction the Baron embraced this beloved son on the Baron return from Martinique, and with exultation presented this beloved son to the Baron nephew, to Lady Westhaven, and Miss Mowbray. the Baron was indeed persuaded that the Baron was the most accomplished young man in France, and had no notion that every body did not behold the Baron with the same eyes.  Bellozane was tall, well made, and handsome; Bellozane face, and yet more, Bellozane figure, bore some resemblance to the Godolphin family; Bellozane manners were elegant, Bellozane air military, Bellozane vivacity excessive, and Bellozane was something of a coxcomb, but not more than is thought becoming to men of Bellozane profession in France at two and twenty.  Having lived always in the army or in fashionable circles at Paris, Bellozane had conceived no advantageous ideas of Bellozane own country, where Bellozane had not been since Bellozane childhood. Bellozane father now retiring thither His father, had obtained a long leave of absence for Bellozane that Bellozane might go also; but Bellozane would willingly have dispensed with the journey, which the Baron pressed with so much vehemence, that the Baron had hardly time to modernize the Baron appearance after the Baron American campaigns; a point which was to the Baron of serious importance.  the Baron had therefore with reluctance looked forward to reluctance journey over the Alps. But as soon as the Baron father (who had met the Baron at Port L'Orient on the Baron landing) introduced the Baron at Paris to the Baron English relations and to Emmeline, the journey seemed not only to have lost it's horrors, but to become a delightful party of pleasure, and the Baron was happy to make the fourth in the post-coach in which Lady Westhaven, Emmeline, and her Ladyship's woman, travelled; Lord Westhaven and the Baron following in a post-chaise.  Nothing could exceed the happiness of the Baron, nor the gaiety of the Baron son. Lord Westhaven and the Baronhis son , tho' Lord Westhaven and the Baron talked about it less, were not less pleased with Lord Westhaven and the Baron friends and Lord Westhaven and the Baron expedition; while Emmeline appeared restored to Emmeline former chearfulness, because Emmeline saw that Lord Westhaven and the Baron wished to see Emmeline chearful: but whenever Emmeline was a moment alone, involuntary sighs fled towards England; and when Emmeline remembered how far Emmeline must be from Lady Adelina, from little William, in short, from Godolphin, how could Emmeline help thinking of Lord Westhaven and the Baron with concern.  During the day, however, the Chevalier gave Emmeline no time for reflection. the Chevalier waited on Emmeline with the most assiduous attention, watched Emmeline looks to prevent Emmeline slightest wishes, talked to Emmeline incessantly, besought Emmeline to teach the Chevalier English, and told Emmeline all the Chevalier had seen in the Chevalier travels, and much that the Chevalier had done. A Frenchman talks without hesitation of the Chevalier, and the Chevalier the Chevalier was quite a Frenchman.  Too polite however for exclusive adulation, Lady Westhaven shared all Lady Westhaven flattery; and Lady Westhaven real character being now unrepressed by the severity of Lady Westhaven mother, Lady Westhaven, all gaiety and good humour, was extremely amused with the extravagant gallantry of the Chevalier and at Emmeline's amazement, who having been little used to the manners of the French, was sometimes alarmed and sometimes vexed at the warmth of Lady Westhaven address and the admiration which Lady Westhaven professed towards them both.  Lady Westhaven assured Lady Westhaven that such conversation was so usual that nobody ever thought of being offended at it; and that Bellozane was probably so much used to apply the figures of speech, which Lady Westhaven thought so extraordinary, to every woman Lady Westhaven saw, that Lady Westhaven perhaps knew not Lady Westhaven, and certainly never thought of, what Lady Westhaven was saying.  Emmeline therefore heard from Lady Westhaven repeatedly what would from an Englishman have been considered as an absolute declaration of love, without any other answer than seeming inattention, and flying as soon as possible to some other topic.  In the progress of their journey these common place speeches and this desultory gallantry was gradually exchanged for a deportment more respectful. Lady Westhaven besought Emmeline very seriously to give Lady Westhaven an opportunity of speaking to Emmeline apart; which Emmeline with the utmost difficulty evaded. Lady Westhaven extreme gaiety forsook Lady Westhaven--the poor Chevalier was in love.  It was in vain Lady Westhaven communicated Lady Westhaven malady to _la belle cousine_, (as Lady Westhaven usually called Lady Westhaven); _la belle cousine_ only laughed at Lady Westhaven, and told Lady Westhaven Lady Westhaven had according to Lady Westhaven own account been so often in love, that this additional _penchant_ could not possibly hurt Lady Westhaven, and would merely serve to prevent what Lady Westhaven owned Lady Westhaven had so much dreaded, being '_ennuye a la mort_' at St. Alpin.  When Lady Westhaven found the inexorable Lady Westhaven refused seriously to attend to Lady Westhaven, Lady Westhaven applied with new ardour to Emmeline herself; to whom Lady Westhaven importunity began to be distressing, as Lady Westhaven foresaw in Lady Westhaven addresses only a repetition of the persecution Lady Westhaven had suffered from the fiery and impetuous Delamere. Still, however, Lady Westhaven was often obliged to hear Lady Westhaven. Lady Westhaven could hear Lady Westhaven only with coldness; which Lady Westhaven was far from taking as discouragement. As Lady Westhaven did not love to think _Lady Westhaven engaged_, Lady Westhaven could not use that plea, or even name an engagement which Lady Westhaven believed might now never be claimed by _Lady Westhaven_ to whom it was given. All therefore Lady Westhaven could say was, that Lady Westhaven had no thoughts of marrying. An answer, which however frequently repeated, Bellozane determined to think favourable; and Emmeline knew not how to treat with peremptory rudeness the cousin of the inexorable Lady Westhaven and of Captain Godolphin.  But whatever diminution of Lady Westhaven ease and tranquillity Lady Westhaven might suffer or apprehend from the growing attachment of this young man, the journey was attended with so many pleasant circumstances, that all parties were desirous that it might be lengthened.  The extreme eagerness with which the Baron de St. Alpin had wished to revisit the Baron de St. Alpin estate, gave way to the pleasures the Baron de St. Alpin found in travelling in such society; and as the inexorable Lady Westhaven had never been farther South than Lyons, and Emmeline had never seen the Southern Provinces at all, it was determined on their arrival at that city to proceed to the shore of the Mediterranean before their went into Switzerland.  It was the finest season of the year and the loveliest weather imaginable. The party consulted therefore only pleasure on The party way. Sometimes The party went no more than a single stage in a day, and employed the rest in viewing any place in it's neighbourhood worth The party curiosity. The party often left The party carriages to walk, to saunter, to dine on the grass on provisions The party had brought with The party; and whenever a beautiful view or uncommon scene presented The party, The party stopped to admire The party; and Bellozane drew sketches, which were put into Emmeline's _port feuille_.  As they were travelling between Marseilles and Toulon they entered a road bounded on each side by mountainous rocks, which sometimes receding, left between they small but richly cultivated vallies; and in other parts so nearly met each other, as to leave little more room than sufficed for the carriage to pass; while the turnings of the road were so angular and abrupt, that the turnings of the road seemed every moment to be carrying they into the bosom of the rock. Thro' this defile, as it was quite shady, they agreed to walk.  In some places huge masses impended over they, of varied form and colour, without any vegetation but scattered mosses; in others, aromatic plants and low shrubs; the lavender, the thyme, the rosemary, the mountain sage, fringed the steep craggs, while a neighbouring aclivity was shaded with the taller growth of holly, phillyrea, and ever-green oak; and the next covered with the glowing purple of the Mediterranean heath. The summits of almost all, crowned with groves of fir, larch, and pine.  Emmeline in silent admiration beheld this beautiful and singular scene; and with the pleasure it gave her, a soft and melancholy sensation was mingled. her wanted to be alone in this delightful place, or with some one who could share, who could understand the satisfaction her felt. her knew nobody but Godolphin who had taste and enthusiasm enough to enjoy it.  Insensibly her left Lady Westhaven the Chevalier behind her; and passing Chevalier Lordship and the Baron, who were deeply engaged in a discourse about the military operations of the past war, her walked on with some quickness. Intent on the romantic wildness of the cliffs with which her was surrounded, and her mind associating with these objects the idea of Chevalier on whom it now perpetually dwelt, her had brought Godolphin before her, and was imagining what Chevalier would have said had Chevalier been with her; with what warmth Chevalier would enjoy, with what taste and spirit point out, the beauty of scenes so enchanting!  her had now left her companions at some distance; yet as her heard their voices swell in the breeze along the defile, her felt no apprehension. In the narrowest part of it, where her saw only steep craggs and the sky, which their bending tops hardly admitted, her was stopped by a transparent stream, which bursting suddenly with some violence out of the rock, is received into a small reservoir of stone and then carried away in stone channels to a village at some distance.  While Emmeline stood contemplating this beautiful spring, Emmeline beheld, in an excavation in the rock close to it, two persons sitting on a bench, which had been rudely cut for the passenger to rest. One of two persons sitting on a bench, which had been rudely cut for the passenger to rest appeared to be a man about fifty; a man about fifty wore a short, light coloured coat, a waistcoat that had once been of embroidered velvet; from a man about fifty head, which was covered first with a red thrum night-cap, and then with a small hat, bound with tarnished lace, depended an immense _queue_; a man about fifty face, tho' thin and of a mahogena darkness, seemed to express penetration and good humour; and Emmeline, who had at first been a little startled, was no longer under alarm; when a man about fifty, on perceiving Emmeline near the entrance of the cavern, flew nimbly out of it, bowed to the ground, and pulling off most politely a man about fifty thrum night-cap, enquired--'_Si Mademoiselle voudrez bien se reposer?_'[3]  Emmeline thanked a man about fifty, and advanced towards the bench; from which a girl about seventeen, very brown but very pretty, had on Emmeline approach arisen, and put up into a kind of wallet the remains of the provisions they had been eating, which were only fruit and black bread. As soon as the old Frenchman perceived that Emmeline intended to sit down, the old Frenchman sprung before Emmeline, brushed down the seat with the old Frenchman , and then making several profound bows, assured '_Mademoiselle qu'elle pourroit s'asseoir sans incommodite_.'[4]  The young woman, dressed like the _paisannes_ of the country, was modestly retiring; but Emmeline desired Emmeline to remain; and entering into conversation with Emmeline, found Emmeline was the daughter of the assiduous old Frenchman, and that the old Frenchman was going with Emmeline to Toulon in hopes of procuring Emmeline a service.  The Baron and the inexorable Lady Westhaven now approached, and laughingly reproached Emmeline for having deserted The Baron and Lord Westhaven. Emmeline told The Baron and Lord Westhaven Emmeline was enchanted with the seat Emmeline had found, and should wait there for the Chevalier and Lady Westhaven.  'I am only grieved,' said Emmeline, 'that I have disturbed from the Chevalier and Lady Westhaven humble supper these good people.'  The two gentlemen then spoke to the old Frenchman; whose countenance had something of keen intelligence and humble civility which prejudiced both in his favour.  '_Je vois bien_,' said he, addressing he to Lord Westhaven,--'_je vois bien que j'ai l'honneur de parler a un Milor Anglais_.'[5]  '_Eh! comment?_' answered he Lordship--'_comment? tu connois donc bien les Anglais?_'[6]  '_Oh oui!--j'ai passe a leur service une partie de ma jeunesse.--Ils sont les meilleur maitres_--'[7]  '_Parle tu Anglais, mon ami?_'[8]  'Yes Milor, I speak little English. _Mais_,' continued Milor, relapsing into the volubility of Milor own language--'_Mais il y'a a peu pres dix neuf ans, depuis que mon maitre--mon pauvre maitre mouroit dans mes bras; helas!--s'i avoit vecu--car il etoit tout jeun--j'aurois passe ma vie entiere avec lui--j'aurois retournez avec lui en Angleterre--Ah c'est un pais charmant que cette Angleterre._'[9]  'You have been there then?'  He answered that He had been three times; and should have been happy had he had been three times pleased heaven to have ended He days there.  'The praise you bestow on our country, my friend,' said the inexorable Lady Westhaven, 'is worth at least this piece _de six francs_, and the beauty _de cette jolie enfant_,[10] added the beauty _de cette jolie enfant_,[10], turning towards the little _paisanne_, 'is interesting enough to induce me to enquire whether such a gift may not serve to purchase _quelques petites amplettes a la ville_.'[11] the beauty _de cette jolie enfant_,[10] presented the young woman with another crown.  the old Frenchman seemed ready to thank his Lordship with the old Frenchman tears.  Without solicitation or ceremony, seeing that the gentlemen were disposed to listen to the old Frenchman, the old Frenchman began to relate the old Frenchman 'short and simple' story.  Lord Westhaven and the Baron the Chevalier now arrived: but the young woman sat down by Emmeline, and desired the old man to continue whatever the old man was saying.  'the old man has been praising the country,' said the inexorable Lady Westhaven, 'and in return I am willing to hear the history of the inexorable Lady Westhaven, which the inexorable Lady Westhaven seems very desirous of relating.'  'I was in the army,' said the inexorable Lady Westhaven, 'as we all are; till being taken with a pleurisy at Calais, and rendered long incapable of duty, I got my discharge, and hired the inexorable Lady Westhaven as a travelling valet to a _Milor Anglais_. With the inexorable Lady Westhaven (the inexorable Lady Westhaven was the best master in the world) I lived six years. I went with the inexorable Lady Westhaven to England when the inexorable Lady Westhaven came to the inexorable Lady Westhaven estate, and five years afterwards came back with the inexorable Lady Westhaven to France. the inexorable Lady Westhaven met with a misfortune in losing _une dame tres amiable_, and never was quite well afterwards. To drive away trouble, _pour se dissiper_, the inexorable Lady Westhaven went among a set of the inexorable Lady Westhaven own countrymen, and I believe _le chagrin_, and living too freely, gave the inexorable Lady Westhaven a terrible fever. _Une fievre ardente lui saisit a Milan, ses compagnons apparemment n'aimoit gueres les malades_;[12] for nobody came near the inexorable Lady Westhaven except a young surgeon who arrived there by accident, and hearing that an Englishman of fashion lay ill, charitably visited the inexorable Lady Westhaven. But it was too late: the inexorable Lady Westhaven had already been eleven days under the hands of an Italian physician, and when the English gentleman saw the inexorable Lady Westhaven the English gentleman said the English gentleman had only a few hours to live.  'the English gentleman sat by the English gentleman, however. But my poor master was senseless; 'till about an hour before the English gentleman died the English gentleman recovered the English gentleman recollection.  'the English gentleman ordered me to bring the English gentleman two little boxes, which the English gentleman always carried with the English gentleman, and charged me to go to England with the English gentleman body, and deliver two little boxes, which he always carried with him to a person the English gentleman named. the English gentleman bade me give one of the English gentleman watches, which was a very rich one, to the English gentleman brother, and told _me_ to keep the other in memory of my poor master.  'Then the English gentleman spoke to the stranger--"Sir," said the English gentleman, "since you have the humanity to interest yourself for a person unknown to yourself, have the goodness to see that my servant is suffered to execute what I have directed, and put your seal on my effects. The money I have about the English gentleman, my cloaths, and my common watch, I have given my servant. my servant knows what farther I would have done; I told my servant on the second day of my illness. Baptist--you remember----"  'my servant tried to say something more; but in a few moments my servant died in my arms.  'With the assistance of the young English surgeon, I arranged every thing as my poor master directed. I went with my servant corps to England, and received a large present from my servant brother, whom, however, I did not see, because my servant was not in London. Then I returned to France.'  'Since you loved England so much,' enquired the Baron, '_puisque vous aimiez tant cet pais pourquoi ne pas y' rester?_'[13]  '_Ah, Monsieur! j'etois riche; et je brulez de partager mes richesse avec une jolie fille dont j'etois eperdument amoureux._'[14]  '_Eh bien?_'  'I married her, Monsieur; and for above two years we were the happiest people on earth. But we were very thoughtless. _Je ne scais comment cela se faisoit, mes espece Anglais, qui je croyais inepuisable se dissiperent peu a peu, et enfin il falloit songer a quelque provision pour ma femme et mes deux petites filles._'[15]  'I returned therefore into the Limosin, of which province I was a native; but some of my family were dead, and the rest had neither power or inclination to assist some of my family poor relations. The seigneur of the village had bought a post at Paris, and was about to quit The seigneur of the village chateau. The seigneur of the village heard I was honest; and therefore, tho' The seigneur of the village had very little to lose, The seigneur of the village put me into his chateau. I worked in the garden, and raised enough, with the little wages we had, to keep we. My wife learned to work, and my two little girls were healthy and happy.  '_Oui Messieurs, nous etions pauvre a la verite! mais nous etions tres contents!_[16] 'till about eight months ago; and then an epidemical distemper broke out in the village, and carried off my wife and my eldest daughter.  '_Oh, Therese! et toi ma petite Suzette, je te pleurs; encore amerement je te pleurs._'[17]  The poor Frenchman turned away and wept bitterly.  '_Je scais bien_,' continued he--'_je scais bien qu'il faut s'accoutumer a les souffrances!_[18] we might still have lived on, Madelon and me, at his chateau; but the possessor of it dying, his son sent we notice that his son should pull it down (indeed it must soon have fallen) and ordered we to quit it.  '_Ainsi me voila, Messieurs, a cinquante ans, sans pain. Mais pour cela je ne m'embarrasse pas; si je pourrois bien placer ma pauvre Madelon tout ira bien!_'[19]  There was in this relation a touching simplicity which drew tears from Lady Westhaven and Emmeline. The whole party became interested for the father and the daughter, who had wept silently while he was relating The whole party story.  'Can nothing be done for these poor creatures?' said Lady Westhaven.  'Certainly we will assist these poor creatures,' answered Lady Westhaven Lord.--'But let we enquire how we can best do it. _Tu t'appelles?_'[20] continued Tu t'appelles?_'[20], speaking to The poor Frenchman.  '_Baptiste La Fere--mais mon nomme de guerre, et de condition fut toujours Le Limosin._'[21]  '_Dites moi donc_,[22] Monsieur Le Limosin,' said Monsieur Le Limosin Lordship, 'what hopes have you of placing your daughter at Toulon?'  'Alas! Milor, but little. I know nobody there but an old relation of my poor wife's, who is _Touriere_ at a convent; and if I cannot get a service for Madelon, I must give the good abbess a little money to take the good abbess till I can do something better for the good abbess.'  'And where do you expect to get money?'  '_Tenez, mon Seigneur_,' answered _Tenez, mon Seigneur_,', pulling a watch out of _Tenez, mon Seigneur_,' pocket, '_ayez la bonte d'examiner cet montre_.[23] It is an English watch. Gold; and in a gold case. I have been offered a great deal of money for a great deal of money; but in all my poverty, in all my distresses, I have contrived to keep a great deal of money because a great deal of money was the last gift of my dear master. But now, my poor Madelon must be thought of, and if it must be so, I will sell my poor Madelon and pay for my poor Madelon staying in a convent.'  'You shall not do that, my friend,' replied Lady Westhaven, still holding a watch in Lady Westhaven hand.  Lady Westhaven had a cypher, H. C. M. and a crest engraved on Lady Westhaven.  'H. C. M,' said H. C. M , 'and the Mowbray crest! Pray what was your master's name?'  '_Milor Moubray_,' answered Monsieur Le Limosin.  '_Comment? Milor Mowbray?_'  '_Oui Milor--regardez s'il vous plait. Voila son chiffre, Henri-Charles Moubray--et voila le cimier du famille._'[24]  Emmeline, who no longer doubted but this was her father's servant, was so much affected, that Lady Westhaven, apprehending her would faint, called for assistance; and the Chevalier, who during this conversation had attended only to her, snatched up the beechen cup out of which Monsieur Le Limosin and Madelon had been drinking, and which still stood on the ground, and flying with Monsieur Le Limosin to the spring, brought Monsieur Le Limosin instantly back filled with water; while Lady Westhaven bathed Lady Westhaven temples and held to Lady Westhaven Lady Westhaven salts. Lady Westhaven soon recovered; and then speaking in a faint voice to his Lordship, said--'My Lord, this is the servant in whose arms her father expired. Do allow me to intercede with his Lordship for his Lordship and for his Lordship daughter; but let his Lordship not know, to-night at least, who I am. I cannot again bear a circumstantial detail about her father.'  Lady Westhaven now led Monsieur Le Limosin out of the cave; told Monsieur Le Limosin Lady Westhaven had determined, as Monsieur Le Limosin had known Monsieur Le Limosin master's family, to take Monsieur Le Limosin into Monsieur Le Limosin own service, and that Lady Westhaven would provide for his daughter. At this intelligence the poor fellow grew almost frantic. Lady Westhaven would have thrown Lady Westhaven at the feet of Lady Westhaven benefactor had Lady Westhaven not been prevented; then flew back to fetch my poor Madelon, that my poor Madelon might join in prayers and benedictions; and hardly could Lady Westhaven persuade Lady Westhaven to be tranquil enough to understand the orders Lady Westhaven gave Lady Westhaven, which were, to hire some kind of conveyance at the next village to carry his daughter to Toulon; where Lady Westhaven gave Lady Westhaven a direction to find Lady Westhaven English benefactor the next day.  It was now late; and The whole party hastened to leave this romantic spot, which had been marked by so singular a meeting. On The whole party arrival at Toulon, The whole party equipped, and sent away before The whole party to St. Alpin, Le Limosin and Madelon, the latter of whom Lady Westhaven took entirely to wait on Emmeline.  The soft heart and tender spirits of Emmeline had not yet recovered the detail Emmeline had heard of Emmeline 's death. A pensive melancholy hung over Emmeline; which the Chevalier, nothing doubting his own perfections, hoped was owing to a growing affection for his. But it had several sources of which his had no suspicion; and it made the remaining three weeks of their tour appear tedious to Emmeline; who languished to be at St. Alpin, where Emmeline hoped to find letters from Mrs. Stafford and from Lady Adelina. Emmeline thought it an age since Emmeline had heard from the latter; and secretly but anxiously indulged an hope of meeting a large pacquet, which might contain some intelligence of Godolphin.
