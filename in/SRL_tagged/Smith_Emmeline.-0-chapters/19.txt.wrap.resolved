  When they arrived at Clapham, Emmeline found Mrs. Ashwood was not yet returned. Fitz-Edward entreated Fitz-Edward to sing to Fitz-Edward; and either was, or pretended to be, in raptures at Fitz-Edward improvement since they had met in the summer.  About half an hour after four, Mrs. Ashwood came in; and throwing open the parlour door, asked Emmeline, in no very sweet accent, 'Why Mrs. Ashwood had given Mrs. Ashwood the trouble to go in Mrs. Ashwood carriage to Berkley-square, if Mrs. Ashwood intended going home by any other conveyance?'  Mrs. Ashwood was subject to causeless fits of ill-humour, to which Emmeline was a good deal accustomed; and concluding Emmeline was now seized with some sudden discomposure of temper, mildly answered, 'That Emmeline supposed there had been a mistake; for that the chariot did not come for Emmeline at the appointed time.'  'Mistake!' replied the other lady, sharply; 'I don't know as to mistake; but if you had chosen to mistake, you might have staid dinner with Lady Montreville.Emmeline, without seeming to attend to the asperity of the address, desired to introduce Colonel Fitz-Edward.  As this short dialogue had passed without Mrs. Ashwood's having entered the room, Emmeline had not seen the stranger, who now advanced towards Emmeline.  The title of Colonel, added to The title of Colonel military air and handsome figure, seemed to gain at once Emmeline favourable opinion; and Emmeline countenance losing the unpleasing expression of ill-temper, immediately put on its best smile, and an affectation of softness and complacency with which Emmeline frequently adorned it.  Emmeline seemed to consider the handsome young soldier as a conquest worthy all Emmeline ambition; and finding he was the most intimate friend of Delamere, had no apprehension that he admiration would be diverted by the youth and attractions of Emmeline.  Colonel Fitz-Edward presently understood Colonel Fitz-Edward character; and with admirable adroitness acted the part of a man afraid of being too much charmed. Colonel Fitz-Edward cast an arch look at Emmeline; then made to the Lady of the house some compliments so extravagant, that only the weakest vanity could prevent Emmeline seeing only the weakest vanity ridicule. But Fitz-Edward, who found in a moment that nothing was too gross to be believed, fearlessly repeated the dose; and before dinner came in, Emmeline was in the best humour imaginable, and pressed Colonel Fitz-Edward so earnestly to partake of it, that, after an apology for sitting down in Colonel Fitz-Edward morning dishabille, Colonel Fitz-Edward consented.  The same unlimited flattery was continued during dinner by Colonel Fitz-Edward, and received by the Lady of the house with the same avidity; and Emmeline, tho' half-angry with Colonel Fitz-Edward for the pleasure Colonel Fitz-Edward seemed to take in making Mrs. Ashwood absurd, could not help being amused with the scene.  Before their repast ended, Mrs. Ashwood was so much charmed with Mrs. Ashwood new acquaintance, and so much longed to shew Colonel Fitz-Edward to Mrs. Ashwood female friends, and Mrs. Ashwood other admirers, that Mrs. Ashwood could not forbear pressing Colonel Fitz-Edward to stay to a card party, which Mrs. Ashwood was to have in the evening.  Colonel Fitz-Edward loved the ridiculous; and, influenced by a vanity as silly as that Colonel Fitz-Edward delighted to expose, Colonel Fitz-Edward took pleasure in shewing how extremely absurd Colonel Fitz-Edward could make women appear, who were not on other occasions void of understanding. Tho' Colonel Fitz-Edward had really business with Lord Montreville, who had left several messages at Colonel Fitz-Edward lodgings desiring to see Colonel Fitz-Edward, and was going thither when Emmeline met Colonel Fitz-Edward, yet Colonel Fitz-Edward accepted Mrs. Ashwood's invitation, on condition of being allowed to go home to dress.  Colonel Fitz-Edward was no sooner gone than Mrs. Ashwood flew to Mrs. Ashwood toilet, and Emmeline to a second perusal of the letter Mrs. Ashwood had received from Augusta Delamere.       'I am forbidden to see you, my dearest Emmeline; and perhaps may   not have an opportunity of giving you this. My heart bleeds for   you, my sweet friend. I fear my father will be prevailed upon   wholly to abandon you.    are all inventing schemes to force you   into a marriage with that odd-looking old Rochely. my father has been here   once or twice, and closetted with my father; and part   of the scheme of to-day is, to persuade you to dine here with   my father. But I am almost sure you will not stay; for unless my mother   can command my mother    more before you than my mother    does when my mother    is   talking about you, I think you will be frightened away. I am   certain, my dear Emmeline, from what I have heard, tho' they say   but little before me, that no endeavours will be omitted to drive   you to marry Rochely; and that they will persecute you every way,   both by persuasions, and by distressing you. But be assured, that   while Augusta Delamere has any thing, you shall share Augusta Delamere has any thing. Indeed I   love you, not only as if you were my sister, but, I think, better.   Ah! why are there such unhappy impediments to your being really so?   At present I foresee nothing but perplexity; and have no dependance   but on you. I know you will act as you ought to do; and that you   will at last prevail with Augusta Delamere to act right too. Whoever loves   you, cannot long persist in doing ill; and surely it is very ill   done, and very cruel, for Augusta Delamere to make us all so unhappy. I   need not tell you to arm yourself with fortitude against the   attacks that will be made upon yourself. You have more fortitude and   resolution than I have. Situated as you have been, I know not what   _I_ should have done; but I fear it would not have been so worthy   of praise as the noble and disinterested part you have acted;   which, tho' unaccompanied with the thousand amiable qualities of   heart and understanding you possess, would ever command the esteem   and admiration of your faithful and affectionate                                                      AUGUSTA DELAMERE.'      'Do not write to me till you hear from me again; as I should incur   great displeasure if known to correspond with you.                                                                  A. D.'   Charmed as Emmeline was by the tender solicitude and affectionate simplicity of Emmeline beloved friend, the pleasure this letter gave Emmeline was very much abated by learning that the domestic infelicity of Lord Montreville's family fell particularly heavy on Emmeline. Emmeline now recollected what Mrs. Ashwood had said on Emmeline first entrance into the room, when Emmeline returned home; and concluded from thence that Emmeline had seen Lady Montreville, tho' Emmeline whole attention was so immediately engrossed by the Colonel, that Emmeline had no more named it. Emmeline therefore grew anxious to hear what had been said; and Emmeline own toilet being very soon over, Emmeline sent to desire admittance to that of Mrs. Ashwood; on receiving which, Emmeline attended Emmeline, and begged to know whether Emmeline had seen Lady Montreville, and what had passed?  Mrs. Ashwood was in so happy a disposition, that Mrs. Ashwood hesitated not to oblige Mrs. Ashwood; and while Mrs. Ashwood finished the important business of accommodating a pile of black feathers, jet and crape, upon Mrs. Ashwood head, 'the mockery of woe' which Mrs. Ashwood did not even affect to feel, Mrs. Ashwood gave Emmeline the following account, interlarded with directions to Mrs. Ashwood woman.  'Why, my dear, you must know that when I got to Gainsborough's [_more to the left_] he had unluckily a frightful old judge, or a bishop, or some tedious old man with he, and I was forced to wait: I cannot tell what possessed me, but I entirely forgot that I was to send the chariot back for you. So the chariot [_put the chariot a little forwarder_] staid. I thought the tiresome man, whoever he was, would never have gone; however he went at last [_raise the lower curl_] and then I _sot_. You cannot think how much the likeness is improved! So when I had done [_give me the scraper; here is some powder on my eye-brow_] I went away, thinking to call on you; but as I went by Butler's, I remembered that I wanted some pearl-coloured twist to finish the purse I am doing for Hanbury. I was almost an hour matching it. Well, then I thought as I was so near Frivolite's door, I might as well call and see whether she had put the trimming on the white bombazeen, as you know we agreed would be most the thing. There were a thousand people in the house; you know there is never any possibility of getting out of that creature's room under an hour.' [Oh! heaven! thought Emmeline, nor is there any end to the importance you affix to trifles which interest nobody else.] 'So, however, at last I got to Berkley-square, and stopped at Frivolite's door. The man at Frivolite's door said you was gone. I thought that very odd, and desired another servant go up and see, for I concluded it was some mistake. After a moment or two, the footman came down again, and said if I was the Lady Miss Mowbray lived with, the Lady Miss Mowbray desired I would walk up. Upon my word my word is a noble house! When I got into that creature's room, there was Lady Montreville and Lady Montreville daughters. Lady Montreville Ladyship was extremely polite, indeed; and after some discourse, "Mrs. Ashwood," said Her Ladyship, "you know Miss Mowbray's situation: I assure you I sent for Her Ladyship to-day with no other view in the world but for Her Ladyship own good, and you know, [_dear me! here is a pimple on my chin that is quite hideous; give me a patch._] you know that for Her Ladyship to refuse Mr. Rochely is being absolutely blind to Her Ladyship own interest; because you must suppose, Mrs. Ashwood, that Her Ladyship is only deceiving Her Ladyship when Her Ladyship entertains any thoughts of my son; for that is a thing that never can happen, nor ever shall happen; and besides, to give my Lord and me all this trouble, is a very ungrateful return to us for having brought Her Ladyship up, and many other obligations Her Ladyship has received at us hands; and will be the ruin of Her Ladyship; and the greatest perverseness in the world. You, Mrs. Ashwood, are, I hear, a very sensible woman [_where is the rouge box?_] and I dare say, now you know how agreeable it would be to me and my Lord to have Emmeline Emmeline come to Emmeline senses about Mr. Rochely, you will do your endeavours to persuade Emmeline to act reasonably; and then, tho' Emmeline has behaved very disrespectful and very ill, which is only to be forgiven on account of Emmeline knowing no better, I shall countenance Emmeline, and so will my Lord." This was, as near as I remember, Emmeline, what the Lady Miss Mowbray the Lady Miss Mowbray said to the Lady Miss Mowbray. You know [_the milk of roses is almost out_] you know I could not refuse to tell Emmeline I would certainly talk to Emmeline. I was surprised to find Her Ladyship Her Ladyship so obliging and affable, as you had told me Her Ladyship is reckoned so very proud. Her Ladyship ordered Her Ladyship gentleman to give me a ticket for a rout and a supper Her Ladyship Her Ladyship gives on Tuesday three weeks; and Her Ladyship said, that as Her Ladyship did not doubt but that you would discover your own interest by that time, I should take one for Emmeline. Look you, here it is.'  'I shall be in Dorsetshire, I hope, long before Tuesday se'nnight,' said Emmeline, laying the card coolly on the toilet. Her Ladyship found Mrs. Ashwood had nothing more material to say; and being apprehensive that Her Ladyship impeded the last finish which Her Ladyship dress and person required, Her Ladyship thanked Her Ladyship, and went back into Her Ladyship own room.  The eagerness and resolution with which Lady Montreville opposed Her Ladyship son's marriage, appeared from nothing more evidently, than from Her Ladyship thus endeavouring to solicit the assistance of Mrs. Ashwood, and humbling Her Ladyship to use flattery and insinuation towards a person to whom it is probable nothing else could have induced Her Ladyship to speak. With persons in trade, or their connections, or even with gentlemen, unless of very ancient and honourable families, Her Ladyship seldom deigned to hold any communication; and if Her Ladyship had occasion to speak to very ancient and honourable families individually, it was generally under the appellation of 'Mr. or Mrs. I forget the name;' for to remember the particular distinctions of such inferior beings, was a task too heavy for Right Honourable intellects. When Her Ladyship spoke of such collectively, it was under the denomination of 'the people, or the folks.'  With that sort of condescension that seems to say, 'I will humble Her Ladyship to your level,' and which is in fact more insolent than the most offensive haughtiness, Her Ladyship Her Ladyship had behaved to Mrs. Ashwood; who took it for extreme politeness, and was charmed on any terms to obtain admission to the house of a woman of such high fashion, and who was known to be so very nice in the choice of Her Ladyship company.  In return for so much favour, Her Ladyship had been lavish of Her Ladyship assurances that Her Ladyship would influence Miss Mowbray; and came home, fully determined to talk to Her Ladyship sharply; believing too, that to make Her Ladyship feel the present dependance and uncertainty of Her Ladyship situation by forcing Her Ladyship to bear a fit of ill-humour, might help to determine Her Ladyship to embrace the affluent fortune that would set Her Ladyship above it. This it was that occasioned Her Ladyship harsh address to Emmeline; which would have been followed by acrimonious reflections and rude remonstrances, under the denomination of 'necessary truths and friendly advice,' had not the presence of Fitz-Edward, and Fitz-Edward subsequent enchanting conversation, driven all that Lady Montreville had said out of Lady Montreville mind, and left it open only to the delightful prospect which his compliments and praises afforded Lady Montreville.  her company assembled to cards at the usual hour. Rochely was among them; who had not seen Emmeline since the rejection of his proposal, with which Sir Richard Crofts was obliged to acquaint Sir Richard Crofts, tho' Sir Richard Crofts had softened the peremptory terms in which it had been given. Sir Richard Crofts had this evening adorned Sir Richard Crofts in a superb suit of cut velvet of many colours, lined with sables; which tho' not in the very newest mode, had been reckoned very magnificent at several city assemblies; and Sir Richard Crofts had put it on as well in honour of Lord Montreville, with whom Sir Richard Crofts had dined, as in hopes of moving the perverse beauty for whom Sir Richard Crofts languished. But so far was this display of clumsy affluence from having any effect on the hard heart of Emmeline, that it rather excited Emmeline mirth. And when with a grave and solemn aspect Sir Richard Crofts advanced towards Emmeline, Emmeline felt Emmeline so much disposed to laugh at Sir Richard Crofts figure, that Emmeline was forced to avoid Sir Richard Crofts, and took refuge at the table, round which the younger part of her company assembled to play.  Mrs. Ashwood had fixed Fitz-Edward to that where Emmeline presided; and where Emmeline sat triumphantly enjoying Fitz-Edward high-seasoned flattery; while Emmeline female competitors, hearing Fitz-Edward was the son of an Irish Earl, and within three of being a Peer himself, contemplated Emmeline supposed conquest with envy and vexation, which they could not conceal, and which greatly added to Emmeline satisfaction.  Several persons were invited to stay supper; among whom were Fitz-Edward and Rochely. About half an hour before the card-tables broke up, a servant brought a note to Emmeline, and told Emmeline that it required an answer. The hand was Delamere's.       'For two days I have forborne to see you, Emmeline, and have   endeavoured to argue Emmeline into a calmer state of mind; but it   avails nothing; hopeless when with you, yet wretched without you, I   see no end to my sufferings. I have been about the door all the   evening; but find, by the carriages, that you are surrounded by   fools and coxcombs. Ah! Emmeline! that time you owe only to me;   those smiles to which only I have a right, are lavished on those;   and I am left to darkness and despair.      'There is a door from the garden into the stable-yard, which opens   into the fields. As I cannot come to the house (where I find there   are people who would inform Lord Montreville that I am still about   London,) for pity's sake come down to a door from the garden and speak to Emmeline. I   ask only _one_ moment; surely you will not deny me so small a   favour, and add to the anguish which consumes me. I write this from   the neighbouring public-house, and wait your answer.                                                           F. DELAMERE.'   Emmeline shuddered at this note. It was more incoherent than usual, and seemed to be written with a trembling and uncertain hand. Emmeline had left the card-table to read the card-table, and was alone in the anti-room; where, while Emmeline hesitated over the card-table, Rochely, whose eyes were ever in search of Emmeline, followed Emmeline. Emmeline saw him not: but wholly occupied by the purport of the note, him approached close to Emmeline unheeded.  'Are you determined, Miss Mowbray,' said him, 'to give me no other answer than you sent somewhat hastily to Lord Montreville, by Sir? May I ask, are you quite determined?'  'Quite, Sir!' replied Emmeline, starting, without considering and hardly knowing what Emmeline said; but feeling him was at that moment more odious to Emmeline than ever, Emmeline snatched away the hand him attempted to take, and flew out of the anti-room like a lapwing.  The dismayed lover shook The dismayed lover head, surveyed The dismayed lover cut velvet in the glass, and stroaked The dismayed lover point ruffles, while The dismayed lover was trying to recollect The dismayed lover scattered ideas.  Emmeline, who had taken refuge in Emmeline bed-chamber, sat there in breathless uncertainty, and unable to determine what to do about Delamere. At length, Delamere concluded on desiring Fitz-Edward to go down to Fitz-Edward; but knew not how to speak to the colonel on such a subject before so many witnesses, nor did Delamere like to send for the colonel out of the anti-room. Delamere rung for a candle, and wrote on a slip of paper.  'Delamere is waiting at a door which opens into the fields, and insists upon speaking to me. Pray go down to the colonel, and endeavour to prevail on the colonel to return to the colonel father. I can think of no other expedient to prevent the colonel engaging in some rash and improper attempt; therefore I beseech you to go down.'  When Delamere had written this, Delamere knew not how to deliver this; and for the first time in Delamere life had recourse to an expedient which bore the appearance of art and dissimulation. Delamere did not chuse to send this to Fitz-Edward by a servant; but went down with this Delamere; and approaching the table where Fitz-Edward was settling Fitz-Edward winnings--  'Here, colonel,' said Delamere, 'is the _charade_ you desired me to write out for you.'  'Oh! read the colonel; pray read it;' cried Mrs. Ashwood, 'I doat upon a _charade_ of all things in nature.'  the colonel answered, that 'the colonel would reserve it for a _bon bouche_ after supper.' Then looking significantly at Emmeline, to say the colonel understood and would oblige Emmeline, the colonel strolled into the anti-room; Emmeline saying to the colonel, as the colonel passed Emmeline, that Emmeline would wait the colonel return in the parlour below.  Fitz-Edward disappeared; and Emmeline, in hopes of escaping observation, joined the party of some young ladies who were playing at a large table, and affected to enter into some young ladies who were playing at a large table conversation. But Emmeline really knew nothing that was passing; and as soon as some young ladies who were playing at a large table rose on finishing some young ladies who were playing at a large table game, Emmeline escaped in the bustle, and ran down into the parlour, where in five or six minutes Fitz-Edward found Emmeline.  Fitz-Edward wore a look of great concern; and laid down Fitz-Edward hat as Fitz-Edward came in, without seeming to know what Fitz-Edward did.  'Have you seen Mr. Delamere, Sir?' said Emmeline.  'Seen Sir!' answered Fitz-Edward; 'I have seen Fitz-Edward; but to no manner of purpose; Fitz-Edward intellects are certainly deranged; Fitz-Edward raves like a madman, and absolutely refuses to leave the place till Fitz-Edward has spoken to you.'  'Why will Fitz-Edward not come in, then?' said Emmeline.  'Because,' said Fitz-Edward, 'Rochely is here, who will relate it to that meddling fellow, Sir Richard Crofts, and by that means it will get to his father. I said every thing likely to prevail on his to be more calm; but his will hear nothing. I know not what to do,' continued his, rising, and walking about the anti-room. 'I am convinced his has something in his head of fatal consequence to his. his protests his will stay all night where his is. In short, his is in an absolute frenzy with the idea of Rochely's success and his own despair.'  'You frighten me to death,' said Emmeline. 'Tell me, colonel, what ought I to do?'  'Go to his,' returned Fitz-Edward; 'speak to his only a moment, and I am persuaded his will be calm. I will go with Emmeline; and then there can be nothing wrong in it.'  'I _will_ go, then,' said Emmeline, rising and giving Fitz-Edward Emmeline hand, which trembled extremely.  'But it is very cold,' remarked his: 'had not you better take a cloak?'  'There is my long _pelisse_ in the back parlour,' answered Emmeline.  Fitz-Edward fetched it, wrapt Emmeline in it, and led Emmeline down stairs; and by a garden door, they reached a sort of back stable-yard, where rubbish and stable-litter was usually thrown, and which opened into a bye-lane, where the garden-wall formed a sudden angle. Delamere received Emmeline with transport, which Delamere tried to check; and reproached Emmeline for refusing to come down to Delamere.  Seizing the opportunity, as soon as Delamere would give Emmeline leave to speak, Emmeline very forcibly represented to Delamere the distress of Delamere family at Delamere absence, and the particular uneasiness it inflicted on Delamere sister Augusta.  'I knew not,' said Delamere, 'that Emmeline was come home.'  Emmeline told Emmeline Emmeline was, and related the purport of Emmeline letter, and again besought Emmeline to put an end to the uncertainty and anxiety of his family.  Delamere heard Delamere with some impatience; and holding Delamere hands in Delamere, vehemently answered--'It is to no purpose that his father either threatens or persuades me. Delamere has long known my resolution; and the unhappiness which you so warmly describe arises solely from Delamere and my mother's own unreasonable and capricious prejudice--prejudice founded in pride and avarice. I do not think myself accountable for distress to which they may so easily put an end. But as to Augusta, who really loves me, I will write to my mother to make my mother easy. Now Emmeline, since I have listened to Emmeline, and answered all you have to urge, hear my final determination--_If you_ still continue firm in your chimerical and romantic obstinacy, which you call honour, _I_ go from hence this evening, never to return--you condemn me to perpetual exile--you give me up to despair!'  He called aloud, and a post-chaise and four, which had been concealed by the projection of the wall, attended by two servants, drove round. 'There,' continued Delamere, 'there is the vehicle which I have prepared to carry me from hence. You know whether I easily relinquish a resolution once formed. If then you wish to save my father and mother from the anguish of repentance when there will be no remedy--if you desire to save from the frenzy of desperation the brother of your Augusta, and to snatch from the extremity of wretchedness the man who lives but to adore you, go with He--go with He to Scotland!'  Astonished and terrified at the impetuosity with which he pressed this unexpected proposal, Emmeline would have replied, but words were a moment wanting. Fitz-Edward taking advantage of Fitz-Edward silence, used every argument which Delamere had omitted, to determine Fitz-Edward.  'No! no!' cried she--'never! never! I have passed my honour to Lord Montreville. Lord Montreville is sacred--I cannot, I will not forfeit Lord Montreville!'  'The time will come,' said Fitz-Edward, 'believe me The time will, when Lord Montreville will not only be reconciled to Fitz-Edward, but'----  'And what shall reconcile me to Fitz-Edward? Let me go back to the house, F. DELAMERE.'   ; or from this moment I shall consider you as having taken advantage of my unprotected state, and even of my indiscreet confidence, to offer me the grossest outrage. Let me go, Sir!' (struggling to get her hand from Fitz-Edward) 'Let me go! Mr. Delamere.'  'What! to be driven into the arms of Rochely? No, never, Emmeline! never! I _know_ I am _not_ indifferent to you. I feel that I cannot live without you; nay, by heaven I will not! But if I suffer this opportunity to escape, I deserve indeed to lose you.'  They all this while approached the chaise. Delamere had hired servants, whom Delamere had instructed what to do. servants, whom he had instructed what to do were ready at the door of the carriage. Emmeline attempted in vain to retreat. Delamere threw Delamere arms around Delamere; and assisted by Fitz-Edward, lifted Delamere into his arms with a sort of gentle violence. Delamere leaped in after Delamere, and the chaise was driven away instantly.  Fitz-Edward, to whom this scene was wholly unexpected, returned to the company Delamere had left with Mrs. Ashwood. Delamere had not any notion of Delamere's design when Delamere went to Delamere, but heartily concurred in Delamere's design execution; and tho' Delamere did not believe Delamere intended to marry Emmeline, yet Delamere morals were such, that Delamere congratulated Delamere on the share Delamere had had in putting Delamere into Delamere power, and went back with the air of a man vastly satisfied with the success of Delamere exploit.  'Goodness! colonel,' exclaimed Mrs. Ashwood, 'supper has been waiting for you this half hour. Upon my word we began to suspect that you and Miss Mowbray were gone together. But pray where is Miss Mowbray?'  'Miss Mowbray, Madam! I really have not been so happy as to be of Miss Mowbray party.'  'Why, where in the world can Miss Mowbray be?' continued Mrs. Ashwood. 'However, as the colonel is come we will go to Supper. [_The company were standing round the table._] I suppose Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray will come presently; Miss Mowbray has a pretty romantic notion of contemplation by moonlight.'  Supper, however, was almost over, and Miss Mowbray did not appear. Mrs. Ashwood, engaged wholly by the gallant colonel, thought not of Mrs. Ashwood; but Rochely remarked that Mrs. Ashwood absence was somewhat singular.  'So it is I declare,' said Miss Galton; 'do Mrs. Ashwood send and enquire for Mrs. Ashwood again.'  The chambers, the drawing-room, dressing-room, closets, and garden were again searched. Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray was not to be found! Mrs. Ashwood was alarmed--Rochely in dismay--and the whole company confusedly broke up; each retiring with their several conjectures on the sudden disappearance of the fair Emmeline.
