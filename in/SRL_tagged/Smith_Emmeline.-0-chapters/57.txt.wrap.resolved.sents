  The rank, and extensive connections of Lady Westhaven, led Lady Westhaven unavoidably into a good deal of company; but it was among persons as respectable for   The rank, and extensive connections of Lady Westhaven virtues as   The rank, and extensive connections of Lady Westhaven station.
Emmeline, of course, often accompanied Lady Westhaven: but almost all Lady Westhaven mornings, and frequently Lady Westhaven evenings, were dedicated to Lady Adelina; who hardly saw any body but Lady Westhaven, Lady Westhaven, Lady Westhaven brothers, and Lady Westhaven sister; and never went out but for the air.
Godolphin passed with Lady Westhaven much of Godolphin time: to the love and pity Godolphin had before felt for Lady Westhaven, was added veneration and esteem, excited by the heroism of Lady Westhaven conduct.
At Lady Westhaven lodgings, too, Godolphin could see Emmeline without the restraint they were under in other places.
There, Godolphin could talk to Emmeline of Godolphin love; and there, Emmeline consented to hear Godolphin.
Lady Westhaven went constantly every morning to visit Lady Westhaven mother, who had lately been rather better, and whose health Lady Westhaven physicians entertained some hopes of re-establishing.
Lady Westhaven own unhappy temper seemed to be the chief impediment to Lady Westhaven recovery; Lady Westhaven violent passions, unsubdued by sickness and disappointment; and Lady Westhaven immeasurable pride, which even the approach of death could not conquer, kept Lady Westhaven nerves continually on the stretch; and allowed Lady Westhaven no repose of mind, even when Lady Westhaven bodily sufferings were suspended.
That Lady Westhaven favourite project of uniting the only surviving branches of Lady Westhaven own family, by the marriage of Lord Delamere and Miss Otley, was now for ever at an end, was a perpetual source of murmuring and discontent.
And tho' Emmeline had as splendid a fortune, with a person and a mind infinitely more lovely, Lady Westhaven Ladyship could not yet prevail upon Lady Westhaven to desire, that the name for which Lady Westhaven felt such proud veneration, and the fortune of Lady Westhaven own illustrious ancestors, should be enjoyed, or carried down to posterity by Lady Westhaven, who had become the object of Lady Westhaven capricious but inveterate dislike.
Emmeline was very glad that the Marchioness thro' prejudice, and Emmeline uncle thro' shame, forbore to persecute Lady Westhaven in favour of their son: but tho' perfectly aware of the antipathy Lady Montreville entertained towards Lady Westhaven, Lady Westhaven yet shewed Lady Westhaven all the attention Lady Westhaven would receive; and would even constantly have waited on Lady Westhaven, had Lady Westhaven not expressed more pain than pleasure in Lady Westhaven presence.
Lady Frances Crofts, by this time fixed in Burlington street for the winter, called now and then on Lady Westhaven mother; but Lady Westhaven visits were short and cold.
It unfortunately happened, that the Marchioness, whose amusement was now almost solely confined to reading the daily prints, had found in one of them a paragraph evidently pointed at the intimacy subsisting between Lady Frances and the Chevalier de Bellozane, which had long been the topic of public scandal.
Lady Frances called upon Lady Frances while Lady Frances mind was under the first impression of this disgraceful circumstance; and Lady Frances spoke to Lady Frances daughter of Lady Frances improper attachment to that young foreigner with more than Lady Frances usual severity.
Lady Frances, far from hearing Lady Frances remonstrance with calmness, retorted, with rudeness and asperity, what Lady Frances termed unjust reproaches; and asserted Lady Frances own right to associate with whom Lady Frances pleased.
The Marchioness grew more enraged, and they parted in great wrath: in consequence of which, Lady Montreville, in the inconsiderate excess of Lady Frances anger, sent for Lady Frances husband and Lady Frances son; and exclaiming with all Lady Frances natural acrimony against the shameful conduct of Lady Frances, insisted upon their obliging Crofts to separate Crofts wife from his wife dangerous and improper acquaintance, and forcing his wife immediately into the country.
Lord Montreville, who had already heard too much of Crofts daughter's general light conduct, and his daughter particular partiality to Bellozane, now saw new evils gathering round Crofts, from which Crofts knew not how to escape.
The fiery and impatient Delamere, already irritated against Bellozane for Crofts pretensions to Emmeline, broke forth in menace and invective; and nothing but Crofts father's anguish, and even tears, prevented Crofts flying directly to Crofts to execute that vengeance which Crofts mother had dictated.
his mother herself, in the violence of his mother passion, had overlooked the consequence of putting this affair into the hands of the inconsiderate and headlong Delamere; but when his mother saw Crofts thus inflamed, terror for _Crofts_, was added to resentment against his mother ; and altogether produced such an effect on his mother broken constitution, that in a few days afterwards his mother complaints returned with great violence, and all remedies proving ineffectual, his mother expired in less than a fortnight.
Lady Westhaven and Emmeline attended on Lady Westhaven and Emmeline Lady Westhaven and Emmeline for the last four or five days; but his mother was insensible; and knew neither of Lady Westhaven and Emmeline.
Delamere, very fond of his mother, and whose feelings were painfully acute, suffered for many days the most violent paroxysms of grief; yet it was a considerable alleviation to reflect that his had not finally been the cause of his mother death.
Lord Montreville bore Lord Montreville with more composure: and the softer, tho' deep sorrow of Lady Westhaven, found relief in the constant and tender attention of his mother Lord, and the sympathy of Emmeline.
Lady Frances Crofts, not insensible to remorse, but resolutely stifling it, affected to hear the news with proper concern, yet as what had been for many months expected.
his mother sent constantly to enquire after his mother father; and the Marquis hoping that while his mother mind was softened by such a mournful event Lord Montreville remonstrance might make a deeper impression, determined to go to his mother; therefore the day after the remains of the Marchioness had been carried to the family vault of the Delameres, Lord Montreville took Lord Montreville chair, and went to Burlington street.
On entering the house, the servants, who concluded Lord Montreville came to Mr. Crofts, were taking Lord Montreville into those apartments below which the servants, who concluded he came to Mr. Crofts master occupied: but Lord Montreville Lordship told those apartments below which their master occupied his Lordship must speak to Lady Frances.
Her own footman said Her Ladyship had given orders to be denied.
'To Her father, puppy?'
--said Lord Montreville.
'Where is Her?'
'In Her dressing room, my Lord.'
his Lordship then passed alone up stairs--As his Lordship went, his Lordship heard the voice of laughter and gaiety, and was more shocked than surprised, when, on opening the door, his Lordship saw Lady Frances in a morning dishabille, and the Chevalier de Bellozane making Lady Frances tea.
At the entrance of her father thus unexpectedly, Lady Frances changed colour; but soon assuming Lady Frances usual assured manner, said Lady Frances was glad to see her father well enough to come out.
'Dismiss his Lordship,' said his Lordship sternly.
'I must speak to his Lordship alone.'
'_Va mon ami_,' cried Lady Frances, with the utmost ease, '_pour quelques moments_.'
the Chevalier de Bellozane left the room; and then Lord Montreville, with paternal affection, tried to move the Chevalier de Bellozane.
But the Chevalier de Bellozane had conquered the Chevalier de Bellozane feelings; and answered with great calmness--'That conscious of the Chevalier de Bellozane own innocence, the Chevalier de Bellozane was quite indifferent to the opinion of the world.
And that tho' the Chevalier de Bellozane certainly wished to be upon good terms with the Chevalier de Bellozane own family, yet if any part of it chose to think ill of the Chevalier de Bellozane, they must do so entirely from prejudice, which it was little worth the Chevalier de Bellozane while to attempt removing.'
Lord Montreville, now provoked beyond all endurance, gave way to the indignation with which he was inflamed, and denounced he malediction against the Chevalier de Bellozane, if the Chevalier de Bellozane did not immediately dismiss the Chevalier de Bellozane and regulate the Chevalier de Bellozane manner of life.
the Chevalier de Bellozane heard he with the most callous insensibility; and let he depart without making any attempt to appease he anger or calm he apprehensions.
From the Chevalier de Bellozane, he went down to Lady Frances Crofts; to whom he forcibly represented the necessity there was for putting an immediate stop to the scandal which the conduct of he occasioned.
Pusillanimous and mean-spirited, Lady Frances Crofts chose neither to risk he personal safety with the Chevalier de Bellozane, nor the diminution of he fortune by attempting to procure a divorce, which would compel he to return what he loved much better than honour.
he saw many others do extremely well, and mightily respected, whose wives were yet gayer than he own; and convinced that while he had money he should always obtain as much regard as he desired, he rather excused to Lord Montreville the conduct of Lady Frances than shewed any disposition to resent it.
the Marquis left the Marquis with contempt, and ordered his chair to Lady Westhaven's.
As the Marquis went, the Marquis could not forbear reflecting on the contrast between the Marquis eldest and youngest daughter, and between the Marquis eldest daughter and the Marquis niece.
the Marquis grew extremely anxious for Lord Delamere's marriage with Emmeline: sure of finding, in Emmeline, an honour to the Marquis family, which might console the Marquis for the Marquis present misfortunes: and the Marquis deeply regretted that infatuation which had blinded the Marquis to Emmeline superior merit, and hazarded losing Emmeline for ever.
Disgusted already with Lady Frances Crofts, the Marquis remembered that it had been in a great measure owing to them, and the Marquis thought of them only with repentance and dislike.
the Marquis saw Lady Westhaven; and relating to Lady Westhaven all that had passed that morning, besought Lady Westhaven to consider what could be done to divide the Chevalier de Bellozane from Lady Frances Crofts.
Lady Westhaven had seen and heard too much of the intimacy between them.
Lady Westhaven was extremely hurt that so near a relation of Lady Westhaven own should occasion such uneasiness in the family of his wife; but as Lady Westhaven had not invited Lady Westhaven over, and always discouraged Lady Westhaven stay, Lady Westhaven had on that head nothing with which to reproach Lady Westhaven.
And all Lady Westhaven could now do, was, to promise that Lady Westhaven would speak again to the Chevalier de Bellozane, and write to the Baron de St. Alpin, entreating Lady Westhaven to press the return of Lady Westhaven son to Switzerland.
his Lordship entered warmly into the apprehensions of Lord Montreville; and undertook to use all Lady Westhaven influence with Lord Delamere to prevent Lady Westhaven running rashly into a quarrel with a young man as passionate and as violent as Lady Westhaven.
Lord Montreville then spoke of Emmeline; and expressed Lord Montreville wishes that the union between Emmeline and his son might speedily be accomplished: but on this subject Lady Westhaven gave his son very little hopes.
Tho' Emmeline had done Tho utmost to conceal even from Lord and Lady Westhaven the true state of Tho heart, his son his Lordship had, in their frequent conferences on Tho affairs, clearly perceived what were Tho sentiments.
But since her sentiments were in favour of his Lordship brother, his Lordship could not think of attempting to alter her sentiments, however sorry for Lord Delamere; and could only determine to observe an absolute neutrality.
his Lordship did not communicate to the Marquis all his Lordship thought, but told his Lordship in general, that Emmeline seemed at present averse to every proposal of marriage, and firm in the resolution Emmeline had made, to remain single 'till Emmeline had completed Emmeline twenty-first year.
Lady Westhaven sent for the Chevalier de Bellozane; who had lately been less frequent in Lady Westhaven visits at Grosvenor-street, and who seemed to resent the coldness with which Lady Westhaven cousins received Lady Westhaven, and to have conceived great anger at the reserve and even aversion with which Emmeline treated Lady Westhaven.
The servant whom his Lordship his Lordship dispatched with a note to Bellozane, returned in about ten minutes, and said that the Chevalier de Bellozane was gone to Bath.
Lady Westhaven now hoped that for some time the intercourse which had given such offence, and occasioned such misery, would be at an end: in the afternoon, however, Lady Frances Crofts came in; and on Lady Westhavenenquiry after Lady Frances Crofts sister, Lady Frances Crofts told Lady Frances Crofts that Lady Frances Crofts was going that afternoon to Speenhamland in Lady Frances Crofts way to Bath.
Conduct, so glaringly improper and unfeeling, a defiance so bold to the opinions of the world and the common decencies of society, extremely hurt both Lady Frances Crofts Ladyship and her Lord.
The latter, however, found some satisfaction in reflecting that at least Delamere and Bellozane could not immediately meet.
Above a month now passed with as much tranquillity as the ardent supplications of Lord Delamere to Emmeline would admit.
Lord and Lady Clancarryl, with Lord and Lady Clancarryl family, arrived in London to pass the rest of the winter; and Lady Adelina, insensibly won from her retirement by the pleasure of meeting at once her sister and her two brothers, seemed to be in better health, and sometimes in better spirits.
As her was now frequently induced to join these charming family parties, her was obliged to see Fitz-Edward among these charming family parties; and Fitz-Edward entertained new hopes that her would at length conquer her scruples and accept Fitz-Edward hand: her carefully, however, avoided all conversation with Fitz-Edward but in mixed company; and Emmeline being continually with her, him but in mixed company were equally prevented from hearing, with any degree of particularity, Godolphin or Fitz-Edward.
the Marchioness had now been dead almost two months; and Lady Westhaven, who from respect to her memory had hitherto forborne to appear in public, was prevailed upon to go to a new play; for the author of which, a nobleman, one of her friends, being particularly interested, the Marchioness prevailed on all the people of fashion and taste whom the Marchioness knew to attend on the third night of it's representation.
Lady Westhaven, Lady Clancarryl, and Emmeline, were by the Marchioness earnest entreaties induced to be among Lady Westhaven, Lady Clancarryl, and Emmeline: but as Lord Westhaven, Lord Clancarryl, Godolphin, and Fitz-Edward, were absent, being gone all together to the seat of the former, in Kent, for a few days, Lady Westhaven, Lady Clancarryl, and Emmeline foresaw but little pleasure in the party; and Lady Westhaven expressed even a reluctance for which Lady Westhaven knew not how to account.
The eagerness of Lord----to serve Lord----to friend at length over-ruled his friend objections; Lord----to Lordship himself and Lord Delamere were to attend his Lordship himself and Lord Delamere; and his Lordship himself and Lord Delamere were to be joined by some other ladies there.
The stage box had been retained for his Lordship himself and Lord Delamere; and his Lordship himself and Lord Delamere proceeded to the playhouse, where his Lordship himself and Lord Delamere were hardly seated, before Lady Westhaven saw, with infinite mortification and alarm, Lady Westhaven sister, Lady Frances Crofts, enter the next box, handed by the Chevalier de Bellozane, and accompanied by a lady, of fashion indeed, but of very equivocal character, with whom Lady Westhaven had lately contracted a great intimacy.
All attention to the play was now at an end.
Incapable of receiving amusement, Lady Westhaven would instantly have returned home; and Emmeline, who saw rage and fierceness in the countenance of Lord Delamere, was equally anxious to do so: but they knew not how to account for such a wish to they without making they fears public; and while they deliberated how to act, the play went on.
Lady Frances, as if quite unconscious of any impropriety in Lady Frances conduct, spoke to they and to Lord Delamere.
them and to Delamere forced them and to Delamere to answer Lady Frances with civility; but Lady Frances brother, turning from Lady Frances, darted an angry look at the Chevalier de Bellozane, and went to the other side of the house.
He from thence watched with indignation the familiar whispers which passed between Lady Frances and the Chevalier de Bellozane; and reflecting on the recent death of He mother, which had been hastened if not occasioned by this connection; remembering how greatly the sufferings of Lady Frances last hours had been embittered by this connection, and recalling to He memory a thousand other causes of anger against the Chevalier de Bellozane, He heated He imagination with the review of these injuries, till He raised He into an agony of passion, which it was soon impossible for He, had He been so disposed, to restrain.
A very few minutes after the play ended, Lady Westhaven, impatient to get away before Lady Westhaven sister, beckoned to Lord Delamere; and finding Lady Westhaven servants ready, told the party Lady Westhaven was too much tired to stay the entertainment, and rose with Emmeline to go.
Lord----led Lady Westhaven Ladyship, and Lord Delamere took the hand of Emmeline: the two former walked hastily thro' the lobby; but as the two latter followed, they were suddenly stopped by Rochely, who, making one of his solemn bows, advanced close to Emmeline, and with great composure congratulated Lady Westhaven in his usual slow and monotonous manner, on Lady Westhaven late acquisitions; assured Lady Westhaven of his great respect and esteem; and added, that as his understood Lady Westhaven would, when Lady Westhaven came of age, be possessed of a large sum of money, his flattered his Lady Westhaven would allow his to manage it for Lady Westhaven, as Lord Montreville at present did; declaring that nobody could be more attentive to the interest of his customers.
The profound gravity with which, in such a place, his made such a request; the sordid meanness of spirit, which could induce a man already so very rich, to solicit custom with the avidity of a mechanic beginning business; and the uncouth and formal figure of the person himself; would have excited in Emmeline ridicule as well as contempt, at any other time: but now, distrest at the delay this meeting occasioned, Lady Westhaven hurried over some answer, Lady Westhaven hardly knew what, and hastened towards the door.
Just, however, before they reached it, Bellozane, with Lady Frances Crofts hanging on Lady Frances Crofts arm, overtook and passed they: the Chevalier de Bellozane slightly touched the Chevalier de Bellozane hat to Emmeline; and Lady Frances, nodding familiarly, said--'Good night!
good night!'
Lady Frances and Bellozane went on; and Emmeline, who saw fury in the eyes of Lord Delamere, now wished as much to linger behind as Lady Westhaven had before done to hurry forward.
But Delamere quickening his pace, overtook them as them descended the steps, and rushed so closely and with so much intended rudeness by Bellozane, that it was with the utmost difficulty his could avoid falling and dragging his fair associate with his.
The fiery Frenchman recovering his footing, turned fiercely to Lord Delamere, and asked, in French, what Frenchman meant?
Lord Delamere, in the same language, replied, that Frenchman meant to tell Lord Delamere Frenchman was a scoundrel!
Instantly a mutual blow was exchanged: the shrieks of Emmeline brought the sentinels; who, together with the croud which immediately gathered, forced together with the croud which immediately gathered from each other.
Lord----who had taken care of Lady Westhaven to Lord----who coach, alarmed at Emmeline's not joining her coach, alarmed at Emmeline, and at the noise Lord----who heard, now came back to see what was the matter.
Lord----who met Lord----who, more dead than alive, coming towards Lord----who, attended by a stranger; and Lord----who had just breath enough to implore Lord----who not to think of _Lord----who_, but to find Lord Delamere, and try to prevent the fatal consequence of what had just happened.
Leaving Lord----who to the care of the gentleman Lord----who had found Lord----who with, who almost supported Lord----who to the coach, Lord----who went forward in quest of Delamere, whom his Lordship met with two or three other gentlemen.
the Chevalier de Bellozane, after stating to Delamere, whom he met with two or three other gentlemen the affront his Lordship had received, and giving Lord Delamere a card, had returned back into the lobby with Lady Frances and Lady Frances friend; from whence it was supposed his Lordship had gone out with Delamere, whom he met with two or three other gentlemen across the stage, as Lady Frances appeared in great alarm.
Lord Delamere to go with his Lordship to the coach, where his Lordship told Lord Delamere Lord Delamere sister was in the utmost terror for Lord Delamere safety.
But enquiring eagerly whether Miss Mowbray was safe with his sister, and hearing his sister was, Lord Delamere said Lord Delamere would be in Grosvenor-street to supper, and desired Miss Mowbray was safe with her, and hearing she was would go home.
Lord----then very warmly remonstrated on the cruelty of terrifying his sister, and insisted on Lord Delamere going with Lord Delamere to the coach: but they were by this time among the croud at the door, where people began to go out fast; and Delamere, whose passions were now inflamed to a degree of madness, broke violently away from Lord Delamere ; and rushing into Grosvenor-street, instantly disappeared.
Every attempt which himself, himself servants, or some gentlemen who were witnesses to the transaction, made to find himself, being ineffectual, Lord----now returned to the coach, where Lady Westhaven was fainting in the arms of Emmeline; who, equally alarmed, and hardly able to support Lady Westhaven, was trying to assist and console Lady Westhaven.
Lord----, instead of returning to his own family, now sent a footman to desire they would go home without a footman; and remaining in Lady Westhaven carriage, directed it to be driven with the utmost speed to Grosvenor street.
As they went, his attempted to appease the agonizing fears of them both, by persuading them both that them both might find Lord Delamere at home before them both; but them both knew too well the ferocity with which his was capable of pursuing his vengeance when it was once awakened; and arrived at home in such disorder, that neither could speak.--The coach, however, no sooner stopped than somebody ran out.
them both had no power to ask who; but the voice was that of Godolphin; who finding his brother likely to be detained two days longer, and existing only while his could see Emmeline every hour, had returned alone to town, and now waited them both arrival from the play.
his was astonished at the situation his found them both in, as his assisted them both out of the carriage.
his received, however, a brief account of the cause from Lord----; while Lady Westhaven, a little recovered by the sight of Godolphin and the hartshorn and water Emmeline had taken, found Emmeline voice.
'For God's sake!
Godolphin, lose not a moment, but go after his brother.
We dread lest his brother went immediately in search of the Chevalier de Bellozane--Oh!
fly!
and endeavour to prevent the horrid effects that may be expected from their meeting!'
'Pray go!'
said Emmeline.
'Pray go instantly!'
Godolphin needed not entreaty.
Godolphin took Godolphin , and ran away directly, without knowing whither to go.
Godolphin thought, however, that it was possible Lord Delamere might go to Berkley square, and send from thence an appointment to the Chevalier de Bellozane.
Thither therefore Thither hastened; but heard that Lord Delamere had not been at home since Lord Delamere dressed to dine in Grosvenor street, and that the Marquis was gone to Lord Dornock's, where Lord Delamere was to stay some days; news, which encreased the alarm of Godolphin, who had hoped that Lord Delamere influence might be used to prevent the rashness of Lord Delamere son.
Lord Delamere ordered Millefleur, and Delamere's coachman, footmen, and grooms, to run different ways in search of Delamere's coachman, footmen, and grooms master, while Lord Delamere went Lord Delamere to the lodgings of the Chevalier de Bellozane.
the Chevalier de Bellozane, Lord Delamere learnt, came from Bath only that morning, and had dressed at the lodgings of Bellozane, but had not been there since.
Lord Delamere now flew to the house of Lady Frances Crofts.
Lady Frances Crofts was gone down to Lady Frances Crofts father's; and Lady Frances, who had come from Bath the same day, had dined with her friend, and was to be set down by Lady Frances Crofts carriage after supper.
Eagerly asking the name of her friend, Lady Frances Crofts was directed to Charlotte street, Oxford street; where on hastening Lady Frances Crofts found Lady Frances, who was vainly attempting to conquer the terrors that possessed Lady Frances.
the Chevalier de Bellozane, the Chevalier de Bellozane heard, had procured chairs for Lady Frances and Lady Frances Crofts with Lady Frances, at the stage door, and had there wished her and the lady a good night, tho' her and the lady had her and the lady intreated of Lady Frances Crofts to go home with her and the lady.
her and the lady added, that her and the lady had refused to let Lady Frances Crofts look for her and the lady carriage, which was driven off in the croud, lest Lady Frances Crofts should meet with Lord Delamere; but were greatly afraid Lady Frances Crofts had gone back to the avenues of the playhouse with that design.
Godolphin, however unpromising Lady Frances Crofts search yet appeared, determined not to relinquish his search.
But while Lady Frances Crofts continued running from place to place, Lady Westhaven and Emmeline sat listening to every noise and terrifying Lady Westhaven and Emmeline with conjectures the most dreadful.
Almost as soon as Godolphin was gone, Lady Westhaven and Emmeline had conjured Lord----to go on his search: but Lord----to returned not; and of Godolphin Lady Westhaven and Emmeline heard nothing.
Even the late hours when fashionable parties break up, now passed by.
Every coach that approached made Lady Westhaven and Emmeline tremble between hope and fear; but it rolled away to a distance.
Another and another passed, and Another and another dreadful suspence still continued.
Emmeline would have persuaded Lady Westhaven to go to bed; but nothing could induce Lady Westhaven to think of it.
Lady Westhaven sometimes traversed the room with hurried steps; sometimes sat listening at the window; and sometimes ran out to the stair case, where all the servants except those who had been dispatched in pursuit of Lord Delamere were assembled.
The streets were now quiet; the watch called a quarter past five; and convinced that if something fatal had not happened some body would have returned to them by this time, them terror grew insupportable.
A quick rap was now heard at the stage door.
Emmeline flew to the stairs--'Is it Lord Delamere?'
'No, Madam,' replied a servant, 'it is Godolphin.'
Afraid of asking, yet unable to bear another moment of suspence, Lady Westhaven flew down part of the stairs.
Godolphin, with a countenance paler than death, caught Lady Westhaven in his arms--'Whither would you go?'
cried his, trembling as his spoke.
'Have you found--Delamere?'
'I have.'
'Alive and well?'
'Alive--but--'  'Oh!
God!--but what?'
'Wounded, I fear, to death.
Keep his from knowing his sister too suddenly.'
That was almost impossible.
Lady Westhaven had at first sat down in the drawing room in that breathless agony which precluded the power of enquiry; then losing Lady Westhaven weakness in desperation, Lady Westhaven ran down, determined to know the worst, and was already on the stairs.
Emmeline, white and faint, leaned on Godolphin--'Where is he, where is his brother?'
cried Lady Westhaven.
Godolphin beckoned to the servants to assist Godolphin in getting Lady Westhaven up stairs.
After a moment, they were all in the drawing room.
'Tell me,' cried Lady Westhaven, with an accent and look of despair--'Tell me for I will know!
You have seen his brother; his brother is killed!
I know his brother is killed!'
'his brother is alive,' answered Godolphin, hardly bearing to wound Lady Westhaven ears with such intelligence as his brother had to deliver--'at least he _was_ alive when I left his brother.'
'_Was_ alive!
his brother is wounded then--and dying!'
'It were useless and cruel to deceive you.
I greatly fear his brother is.'
Uttering a faint shriek, Lady Westhaven now sprung towards the stage door, and protested Lady Westhaven would go to Lady Westhaven wherever Lady Westhaven was.
Emmeline clung about Lady Westhaven, and besought Lady Westhaven to be patient--to be pacified.
'Perhaps,' cried Lady Westhaven, 'Lady Westhaven situation may not be so desperate.
Let us rather enquire what can be done for Lady Westhaven, than indulge the extravagance of us own despair.'
'Ah!
tell me, then, where?--how?'
Lady Westhaven could say no more.
Godolphin thought it best to satisfy Lady Westhaven.
'I will not relate the first part of my search.
It was fruitless.
At length I saw a croud before the stage door.
I asked what was the matter?
and heard that two gentlemen had fought a duel, by candlelight, with swords; that one was killed and the other had escaped.
This was too much like what I expected to hear: I forced my way into the room.
Lord Delamere was bleeding on the ground.
Two surgeons were with Lord Delamere.
I cleared the room of all but Two surgeons, and the necessary attendants.
I saw Lord Delamere carefully conveyed to bed.
I left Two surgeons with Lord Delamere; and came to tell you.
Now I must hasten back to Lord Delamere.
I will not flatter you; Two surgeons gave me very little--indeed no hope of Lord Delamere life.'
'Oh!
my father!
my father!'
exclaimed Lady Westhaven, 'what will become of Lord Delamere when Lord Delamere hears this?'
'I would go to Lord Delamere,' said Godolphin, 'but that I must return to Lord Delamere.
What little Lord Delamere said was to request that I would stay with Lord Delamere.'
'Go then,' said Emmeline--'we must do without Lord Delamere.
Let Lord Delamere not miss the comfort of your presence.'
'Yes,' answered Lord Delamere, 'I must indeed go.'
Emmeline, leaving Lady Westhaven a moment to Lady Westhaven woman, followed Lord Delamere out, and Lord Delamere said to her--'Try, I conjure you, my Emmeline, to exert Lord Delamere for the sake of your poor friend.
Keep Lady Westhaven as tranquil as you can; and may ye both acquire fortitude to bear what is, I fear, inevitable!'
'Oh!
my father!'
loudly exclaimed Lady Westhaven, with a dreadful shriek--'Who shall dare to announce these tidings to Lord Delamere?'
'Send,' continued Godolphin, 'an express to Lord Montreville.
Lord Montreville is at Lord Dornock's; and dispatch another to his brother.
Pray take care of your own health.
It is now impossible for me to stay--Lord Delamere Lord Delamere expects me.'
Lord Delamere then ran hastily away; and Emmeline, struggling with all Emmeline power against Emmeline own anguish, was obliged to commit Emmeline to the care of Emmeline servants, while Emmeline sat down to write to Lord Montreville.
Emmeline letter contained only two lines.
'My dear Lord,      'Your son is very ill. We are much alarmed; and Lady Westhaven   begs you will immediately come hither.
Do not go to Berkley-square.
EMMELINE MOWBRAY.'
_Grosvenor-street,       April 5th._   This note, short as it was, Emmeline had the utmost difficulty to make legible.
A servant was sent off with it, who was ordered to answer no questions; and in another short and incoherent note Emmeline told to Lady Westhaven the melancholy truth, and sent Lady Westhaven by express into Kent.
Having thus obeyed Godolphin as well as Emmeline could; Emmeline returned to Lady Westhaven, who could not be prevailed upon to go to bed, but insisted on being allowed to see Emmeline .
Emmeline, dreadfully terrified by Emmeline obstinacy, now sent for the two physicians who usually attended the family.
One of the two physicians who usually attended the family had been taken by Godolphin to Lord Delamere; but the other instantly attended the summons.
Every argument he could use failing entirely of effect, he was obliged to administer to Emmeline a remedy, which soon acting on Emmeline fatigued and exhausted spirits, threw Emmeline for a short time into insensibility.
While poor Emmeline, who expected soon the arrival of his father, and who waited with torturing anxiety for news from Godolphin, could not even sit down; but wandered about the house of Lady Frances Crofts, and walked from room to room, as if change of place could shorten or lessen Emmeline dreadful suspence.
No news, however, came from Godolphin.
But a little before eight o'clock, the Marquis's chaise stopped at the stage door.
He got out; asked faulteringly of the servants for He son.
Their looks imported sad tidings; but Their were ordered to profess ignorance, and it was the excruciating task allotted to Emmeline to inform this wretched parent that Emmeline only son, the pride and support of Emmeline life, had fallen; and what made it still more horrid, by the hand of Emmeline daughter's paramour.
Lord Montreville entered the drawing room; and the wild and pallid looks of Lord Montreville niece struck Lord Montreville with such horror, that Lord Montreville could only pronounce with trembling lips the name of Delamere: and then throwing he could only pronounce with trembling lips the name of Delamere into a chair, seemed to expect his niece should tell he could only pronounce with trembling lips the name of Delamere what he could only pronounce with trembling lips the name of Delamere was unable to ask.
his niece approached he could only pronounce with trembling lips the name of Delamere; but words failed his niece.
'Delamere!--my son!'
cried 'Delamere!--my son, in a voice hollow and tremulous.
''Delamere!--my son is not dead, my Lord.'
'Not dead!
wherefore is it then that you look thus?
Oh!
what is it I am to know?'
Emmeline then briefly related his situation, as Emmeline had heard it from Godolphin.
Emmeline had only said, that tho' desperately wounded he yet lived, when Lord Montreville, gazing on Emmeline with eyes that bespoke the agony of Lord Montreville soul, and seizing Emmeline violently by the hand, said--'Come, then, with Lord Montreville!
come to Lord Montreville with Lord Montreville, now, this instant!'
Lord Montreville then burst out of the room, still taking Emmeline with Lord Montreville.
Emmeline knew not why Lord Montreville wished Emmeline to follow; but went, unequal to resistance or enquiry.
Lord Montreville chariot was at the stage door.
They both got in, and just as it was driving away, Millefleur ran up to Millefleur.
'Your master?--your master?--' said Lord Montreville.
'Ah!
my Lord, my Lord is--yet living!'
'_Yet_ living!'
'And Godolphin sent me to see if you was come, in hopes that you might see Godolphin.'
'Go on!'
cried Lord Montreville, with a degree of fierceness that made Emmeline shudder.
The horses flew.
Godolphin continued in dreadful and gloomy silence, interrupted only by deep groans.
Emmeline had no comfort to offer, and dared not speak to Godolphin.
At length they arrived at the place.
the servants assisted the servants lord to leave His chariot.
Just as Godolphin got out of it, Dr. Gardner came out; but too much shocked to be able to speak, Dr. Gardner waved Dr. Gardner hand to say that all was over; and almost instantly, Godolphin, with a countenance most expressive of what Dr. Gardner felt, came out to Dr. Gardner also.
'my Lord, your going up will be of no use; spare yourself so great a shock, and suffer me to attend you home.'
'Dr.
Gardner is dead then?'
Deep and mournful silence told Dr. Gardner it was so.
'I will see Dr. Gardner, however,' said Dr. Gardner, pushing by those who would have detained Dr. Gardner.
'No, no,' cried Emmeline.
'Pray, my Lord!
pray, my dear uncle!'
'Uncle!'
exclaimed 'Uncle!'.
'Have I deserved to be my dear uncle?
But I am punished--dreadfully, dreadfully punished!'
A croud was now gathering; and Godolphin was compelled to let A croud proceed; while A croud himself approached Emmeline, who was left half dead in His chariot.
'Ah!
attend not to me!'
said Emmeline.
'Go, I beg of Emmeline, with my dear uncle!'
Dreadful was the scene when the miserable father beheld the body of the miserable father son.
In that bitter anguish which is incapable of tears, the miserable father reproached the miserable father for the obstinacy with which, even against the miserable father own judgment, the miserable father had opposed the miserable father marriage with Emmeline.--'Instead of seeing thus my hopes blasted for ever, I might have grown old among the miserable father children and the children of my brother's daughter!
But I drove my brother's daughter to France; and in consequence of that, the scourge, the dreadful scourge has fallen upon the miserable father!
I and the house of Lady Frances Crofts are low in the dust!
Weak and wretched infatuation!
Dreadful sacrifice to vain and empty ambition; Oh!
my poor murdered boy!'
Then, after a moment's pause, the miserable father turned suddenly to Godolphin, whose manly countenance was covered with tears.
'Tell me, the miserable father!
did the miserable father not wish to see the miserable father?
did the miserable father leave me nothing--not even the miserable father forgiveness?'
'Lord Delamere,' said Godolphin, 'was wounded in the lungs, and every effort to speak threatened the miserable father immediate dissolution.
the miserable father expressed a wish to see you and Miss Mowbray; but said very little else.'
'I brought my brother's daughter, because I knew the miserable father must wish to see my brother's daughter.
But the miserable father will see my brother's daughter no more!'
A deep and hollow groan now burst from the miserable father: the miserable father sorrow began to choak the miserable father; and exclamation was at an end; yet struggling a moment with it, the miserable father said quickly to Godolphin--'Do you think the miserable father suffered great pain?'
'I believe very little, my Lord.'
'And the miserable father had every assistance?'
'the miserable father had instantly every assistance that skill could offer.
Two surgeons of eminence were at supper with company in the house; and Two surgeons of eminence were with the miserable father before I was, which was not ten minutes after the accident.
I never left the miserable father afterwards, but to run to Lady Westhaven.'
'Excellent young man!
you will still, I know, remain with the miserable father, and do what _I_ cannot do.'
the miserable father then paused a moment, and the miserable father anguish seemed to gather strength--while with a look of deep and gloomy despair the miserable father approached the bed; slowly and sternly invoked the vengeance of heaven on the miserable father eldest daughter; and then continued with glazed and motionless eyes to gaze on the body.
From this dreadful torpor it was necessary to rouse the miserable father, and to remove the miserable father from the room.
The united efforts of Godolphin and the surgeons, with difficulty effected The united efforts of Godolphin and the surgeons.
Godolphin was however at length placed in His chariot; and with Emmeline, who was more dead than alive, was conveyed to Grosvenor-street.
Godolphin, dreading the scene Godolphin was to encounter when they got thither, followed they on foot; and assisted Lord Montreville to Lord Montreville chamber, where Lord Montreville entreated the servants not to allow Lord Montreville to see Lady Westhaven, till the servants were both better able to bear the interview.
Lord Montreville then returned to Emmeline; who, quite overcome by excessive terror and fatigue, had hardly strength to speak to Lord Montreville; and unable to support herself longer, retired to bed, where a violent fever seized herself; and for near a week herself was so alarmingly ill, that Godolphin, in the wildest distraction, believed Lord Montreville saw herself snatched from Lord Montreville by the inexorable hands of death.
Lady Westhaven came to Lady Westhaven the evening after Delamere's decease, and never left Lady Westhaven bed side while there was the least appearance of danger; Godolphin continued whole days in the little dressing room that adjoined to it; and Fitz-Edward, who insisted on attending Lord Montreville during these hours of torturing suspence, was unavoidably frequently in the presence of Lady Adelina, whose every sentiment was for the time absorbed in Lady Westhaven fear for a life so dear to them all.
At length Emmeline, tho' yet too ill to leave Lady Westhaven room, was no longer in danger; and Lord Westhaven, who returned instantly to town on hearing the mournful news helped to appease the violent grief of Lord Montreville wife.
But on the more settled and silent anguish of his wife wretched father, Lord Montreville good offices made not the least impression.
Lord Montreville seemed to abhor all thoughts of consolation: and when the remains of poor Delamere were carried to be deposited with those of Lord Montreville mother, Lord Montreville shut Lord Montreville up in total darkness, and refused to admit Lady Westhaven Lady Westhaven to participate Lord Montreville sorrows.
When his wife was allowed to pay his wife duty to Lord Montreville, Lord Montreville conjured his wife to keep from Lord Montreville the sight of any of the Crofts', and that his wife would prevent even their name being repeated in Lord Montreville presence.
With their visits there was no danger of Lord Montreville Lordship's being offended; for as Lord Montreville had, in consequence of this family calamity, resigned all the places Lord Montreville held, Sir Richard and Lord Montreville two sons were already eagerly paying Sir Richard and his two sons court to Lord Montreville successor; and had entered into new views, and formed new political connections, with an avidity which made Sir Richard and his two sons equally forgetful of Sir Richard and his two sons patron's personal afflictions and of that favour to which Sir Richard and his two sons owed Sir Richard and his two sons sudden and unmerited elevation.
Amidst all the misery which the guilty and scandalous conduct of his wife had brought upon the family of his benefactor, the point on which Mr. Crofts felt the most solicitude, was to know what portion of the Delamere estate was irrevocably settled in equal divisions on the daughters, if the Marquis of Montreville died without a son.
The physicians now advised Lady Westhaven to carry the Marquis of Montreville into the country as soon as possible; where Lady Westhaven might enjoy the solitude Lady Westhaven so much desired, without being excluded from the air, as Lady Westhaven was in town, by being confined entirely to Lady Westhaven bed chamber and dressing room.
The sight of any of Lady Westhaven own seats; places which Lady Westhaven had so lavishly embellished for the residence of Lady Westhaven who was now no more, Lady Westhaven could not yet endure; and Lady WesthavenLady Westhaven Lady Westhaven.
Thither, therefore, the Marquis and Lady Westhaven's family removed, at the end of a fortnight; but Emmeline, tho' pretty well recovered, desired Lady Westhaven not to insist on Lady Westhaven being of the party; being convinced, that tho' Lady Westhaven tried to see Lady Westhaven with fortitude, and to behave to Lady Westhaven with tenderness, the sight of Lady Westhaven was painful to my dear uncle, and perpetually brought to Lady Westhaven mind Lady Westhaven own fatal misconduct in regard to Lady Westhaven son.
Lady Westhaven yielded reluctantly to Lady Westhaven reasons, and departed without Lady Westhaven: but as Lady Westhaven health made Lady Westhaven immediate departure from London necessary, Lady Westhaven went with Lady Westhaven to Highgate; who now remained there only for the purpose of taking leave of Lord and Lady Clancarryl, as Lord and Lady Clancarryl were within a fortnight to return to Ireland.
In this interval, Lord and Lady Clancarryl heard that Lady Frances Crofts, infatuated still with Lady Westhaven passion for Bellozane, had followed his son to Paris, whither his son had fled after his son fatal encounter with Lady Westhaven brother.
Bellozane, stung with guilt, and pursued by remorse, hurried from Bellozane with detestation; and concealing his son in Switzerland, saw Bellozane no more.
For some time Bellozane continued to live in France in a style the most disgraceful to Bellozane family and Bellozane.
Nobody dared name Bellozane to Bellozane .
But Lady Westhaven interposed with Crofts, who, influenced by his authority, and still more by his own desire to lessen Bellozane expences, went over, and found no great difficulty in procuring a _lettre de cachet_, which confined Bellozane during pleasure to a convent.
