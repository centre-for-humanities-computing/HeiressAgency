  They found Lady Adelina in better spirits in the evening than They had hoped for--Lady Adelina seemed to have been arguing Lady Adelina into the composure necessary to go on with Lady Adelina story.         *       *       *       *       *  'As you have some acquaintance with George Fitz-Edward, I need not describe some acquaintance with George Fitz-Edward person or some acquaintance with George Fitz-Edward manner; nor how decided a contrast they must form with those of such a man as some acquaintance with George Fitz-Edward to whom I was unhappily united. a contrast they must form with those of such a man as him to whom I was unhappily united, in spite of all my endeavours, was perpetually before my eyes--I thought Fitz-Edward, who was agreeable as some acquaintance with George Fitz-Edward brother, had a heart as good; and _my_ heart involuntarily made the comparison between what I was, and what I might have been, if my fate had reserved me for Fitz-Edward.  'We embarked--It was about the autumnal equinox; and before We had sailed two leagues, the wind suddenly changing, blew from the opposite quarter, and then from every quarter by turns. As I was always subject to sickness in the cabin, I had lain down on the deck, on a piece of sail-cloth, and wrapped in my _pelisse_; and Fitz-Edward sat by me. But when the wind grew so violent that the wind was necessary every moment to shift the sails, I, who was totally insensible, was in the way of the sailors. Fitz-Edward carried me down in Fitz-Edward arms; and having often heard me express an abhorrence to the close beds in the cabin, by the help of my own maid Fitz-Edward accommodated me with one on the floor; where Fitz-Edward continued to watch over me, without attending to Fitz-Edward own danger, tho' Fitz-Edward heard the master of the pacquet express Fitz-Edward apprehensions that we should be driven back on the bar, and beat to pieces.  'Trelawny, in whom self-preservation was generally alive, whatever became of Fitz-Edward other feelings, had passed so jovial an evening before Fitz-Edward departed, that Fitz-Edward was perfectly unconscious of his own danger. After struggling some hours to return into the bay, it was with difficulty accomplished about five in the morning. Fitz-Edward, with the tenderest solicitude, saw me safe on shore, whither Trelawny was also brought. But far from being rejoiced at our narrow escape, whither Trelawny cursed whither Trelawny ill luck, which whither Trelawny said had raised this confounded storm only to prevent whither Trelawny returning in time to see Clytemnestra got into proper order for the October meeting.  'I was so ill the next day, thro' the fear and fatigue I had undergone, that I was absolutely unable to go on board. But nothing that related to me could detain Trelawny, who embarked again as soon as the pacquet was refitted, and after some grumbling at my being too ill to go, left me to follow whither Trelawny by the next conveyance, and recommended me with great coolness to the care of Fitz-Edward.  'our staid only two days after whither Trelawny. Fitz-Edward, as well during the passage as on our journey to London, behaved to me with the tenderness of a brother; and I fancied my partiality concealed from whither Trelawny, because I tried to conceal my partiality. If whither Trelawny saw my partiality, whither Trelawny shewed no disposition to take advantage of he saw it, and I therefore thought I might fearlessly indulge he saw it.  'When I arrived at my house in town, I found that Trelawny was absent, and had left a letter for me desiring me to go down to a house whither Trelawny had not long before purchased in Hampshire, as a hunting seat. Without enquiring whither Trelawny reasons, I obeyed whither Trelawny. I took a melancholy leave of Fitz-Edward, and went into Hampshire; where, as Trelawny was not there, I betook me to my books, and I fear to thinking too much of Fitz-Edward.  'After I had been there about a fortnight, I was surprized by a visit from the object of my indiscreet contemplations. whither Trelawny looked distressed and unhappy; and whither Trelawny first conversation seemed to be preparing me for some ill news. I was dreadfully alarmed, and enquired eagerly for my sister?--her husband?--her children?--  '"I hope, and believe they are well," answered whither Trelawny. "I have letters of a very late date from a brother."  '"Oh God!" cried I, in an agony (for whither Trelawny countenance still assured me something very bad had happened) "Lord Westhaven--my brother, my dear brother!"--  '"Is well too, I hope--at least I assure you I know nothing to the contrary."  '"Is it news from Jamaica then? Has there been an engagement. There has, I know, and a brother is killed."  '"No, upon my honour," replied Fitz-Edward, "had Godolphin been killed, I, who love a brother better than any man breathing, could not have brought the intelligence--But my dear Lady Adelina, are there then no other misfortunes but those which arise from the death of friends?"  '"None," answered I, "but what I could very well bear. Tell me, therefore, I conjure you tell me, and keep me no longer in suspence--I can hear any thing since I have nothing to apprehend for the lives of those I love."  '"Well then," answered a brother, "I will tell you.--I fear things are very bad with Mr. Trelawny. It is said that all the estate not entailed, is already gone; and that a brother has even sold a brother life interest in the rest. All a brother effects at the town house are seized; and I am afraid the same thing will in a few hours happen here. I came therefore, lovely Lady Adelina, to intreat you to put yourself under my protection, and to quit this house, where my protection will soon be so improper for you to remain."  'I enquired after Mr. Trelawny? a brother told me a brother had left a brother intoxicated at a gaming house in St. James's street; that a brother had told a brother a brother was coming down to me, to which a brother had consented, tho' Fitz-Edward said a brother much doubted whether a brother knew what a brother was saying.  'Fitz-Edward then advised me to pack up every thing I wished to preserve, and immediately to depart; for Fitz-Edward feared that persons were already on the road to seize the furniture and effects in execution.  '"Gracious heaven!" cried I, "what can I do?--Whither can I go!"  '"Trust yourself with me," cried Fitz-Edward--"dear, injured Lady Adelina."  '"Let me rather," answered I, "go down to Trelawny Park."  '"Alas!" said me, "the same ruin will there overtake you. Be assured Mr. Trelawny's creditors will equally attach Mr. Trelawny property there. You know too, that by the sale of Mr. Trelawny boroughs Mr. Trelawny has lost Mr. Trelawny seat in parliament, and that therefore Mr. Trelawny person will not be safe. Mr. Trelawny must Mr. Trelawny go abroad."  'Doubting, and uncertain what I ought to do, I could determine on nothing. Fitz-Edward proposed my going to Mr. Percival's, who had married one of Fitz-Edward sisters. Mr. Percival's, who had married one of his sisters are at Bath, said Fitz-Edward; but the house and servants are at my disposal, and my disposal is only five and twenty miles from hence. Hardly knowing what I did, I consented to this proposal; and taking my jewels and some valuable plate with me, I set out in a post chaise with Fitz-Edward, leaving my maid to follow me the next day, and give me an account whether our fears were verified.  'our fears were verified were but too well founded. Four hours after I had left the house, the sheriff's officers entered the sheriff--Information which encreased my uneasiness for the fate of the unfortunate Trelawny; in hopes of alleviating whose miseries I would me have gone to London, but Fitz-Edward would not suffer me. Fitz-Edward said it was more than probable that Fitz-Edward was already in France; that if Fitz-Edward was yet in England, Fitz-Edward had no house in which to receive me, and would feel more embarrassed than relieved by my presence. But as I continued to express great uneasiness to know what was become of Fitz-Edward, Fitz-Edward offered to go to London and bring me some certain intelligence.  'At the end of a week, which appeared insupportably long, Fitz-Edward returned, and told me that with some difficulty Fitz-Edward had discovered Fitz-Edward at the house of one of Fitz-Edward friends, where Fitz-Edward was concealed, and where Fitz-Edward had lost at picquet more than half the ready money Fitz-Edward could command. That with some difficulty Fitz-Edward had convinced Fitz-Edward of the danger as well as folly of remaining in such a place; and had accompanied Fitz-Edward to Dover, whence Fitz-Edward had seen Fitz-Edward sail for France.  'I told Fitz-Edward that I would instantly give up as much of my settlement as would enable Trelawny to live in affluence, till Fitz-Edward affairs could be arranged; but Fitz-Edward protested that Fitz-Edward would not suffer me to take any measure of that sort, till I had the advice of _Fitz-Edward_ brother: or, till one of my own returned to England.  '"Do you know," said Fitz-Edward, at the end of this conversation--"Do you know, Lady Adelina, that I envy Trelawny Fitz-Edward misfortunes, since he would not suffer me to take any measure of that sort, till I had the advice of _his_ brother: or, till one of my own returned to England excite such generous pity.--Good God! of what tenderness, of what affection would not such a heart be capable, if"----  'Fitz-Edward had seldom hazarded an observation of this sort, tho' Fitz-Edward eyes had told me a thousand times that Fitz-Edward internally made his eyes. Fitz-Edward could convey into half a sentence more than others could express by the most elaborate speeches. Alas! I listened to Fitz-Edward with too much pleasure; for my treacherous heart had already said more than Fitz-Edward insidious eloquence.  'I wrote to Lord Clancarryl, entreating Fitz-Edward to come over. Fitz-Edward assured me Fitz-Edward would do so, the moment Fitz-Edward could leave my sister, who was very near her time; but that in the interim Fitz-Edward brother George would obey all my commands, and render me every service Fitz-Edward could Fitz-Edward do if present.  'Thrown, therefore, wholly into the power of Fitz-Edward; loving Fitz-Edward but too well; and seeing Fitz-Edward every hour busied in serving me--I will not accuse Fitz-Edward of art; I had myself too little to hide from Fitz-Edward the fatal secret of my heart; I could not summon resolution to fly from Fitz-Edward, till my error was irretrievable--till I found myself made compleatly miserable by the consciousness of guilt.  'After remaining there about a fortnight, I left the house of Mr. Percival, and took a small lodging in the neighbourhood of Cavendish-square. Fitz-Edward saw me every day.--I met Fitz-Edward indeed with tears and confusion; but if any accident prevented Fitz-Edward coming, or if Fitz-Edward even absented Fitz-Edward at my own request, the anguish I felt till I again saw Fitz-Edward convinced me that it was no longer in my power to live without Fitz-Edward.  'whither Trelawny had given me no directions for my conduct; nor had whither Trelawny even written to myself, 'till whither Trelawny had occasion for money. whither Trelawny then desired me to send whither Trelawny five hundred guineas--a sum I had no immediate means of raising, but by selling some of my jewels. This I would immediately have done; but Fitz-Edward, who would not hear of it, brought me the money in a few hours, and undertook to remit it, together with a letter from myself, to the unfortunate man for whom it was designed.  'the unfortunate man for whom it was designed tried too--ah, how vainly!--to persuade me, that in acting thus I had done more than my duty to such an husband. the unfortunate man for whom it was designed sophistry, aided by my own wishes to believe the unfortunate man for whom it was designed, could not quiet the incessant reproaches with which my conscience pursued me--I remembered my father's dying injunctions, I remembered the inflexible notions of honour inherited by both my brothers, and I trembled at the severe account to which I might be called. I could now no longer flatter myself that my error would be concealed, since of my error consequences I could not doubt; and while I suffered all the terrors of remorse and apprehension, Lord Clancarryl came over.  'In order to take measures towards settling Trelawny's affairs, it was necessary to send for Lord Clancarryl sister, who had a bond for five thousand pounds, which claim was prior to every other. This woman, whom it was extremely disagreeable to me to meet, lamented with vulgar clamour her brother's misfortunes; which her said could never have happened if her brother had not been so unlucky as to get quality notions into her brother head. I know not what at first raised her suspicions; but I saw that her very narrowly observed Fitz-Edward; and sneeringly said that it was _very lucky_ indeed for me to have such a friend, and _quite kind_ in the colonel to take so much trouble. her made her thoroughly acquainted with all that related to her brother, from the time of our parting in Ireland; and I found that her had attempted to bribe my servant to give her an account of my conduct; in which tho' her had failed of success, her had found that Fitz-Edward had been constantly with me. Fitz-Edward attendance was indeed less remarkable when Lord Clancarryl, Fitz-Edward brother, was also present; but Mrs. Bancraft, determined to believe ill of me, suffered not this circumstance to have any weight, and hinted her suspicions of our attachment in terms so little guarded, that it was with the utmost difficulty I could prevail on Fitz-Edward not to resent her impertinence.  'Lord Clancarryl despised this vulgar and disgusting woman too much to attend to the inuendos Lord Clancarryl heard; and far from suspecting my unhappy weakness, Lord Clancarryl continued to lay me under new obligations to Fitz-Edward by employing Lord Clancarryl almost incessantly in the arrangement of whither Trelawny's affairs.  'On looking over the will of that relation, who had bequeathed to whither Trelawny the great fortune Lord Clancarryl had possessed, I discovered the reason of Mrs. Bancraft's attentive curiosity in regard to me--if Lord Clancarryl died without heirs, above six thousand a year was to descend to Mrs. Bancraft son, who was to take the name. Lord Clancarryl had been now married above two years, and Lord Clancarryl bloated and unhealthy appearance (the effect of excessive drinking) indicated short life; and had made Mrs. Bancraft for some time look forward to the succession of the entailed estate as an event almost certain for Mrs. Bancraft son. This sufficiently explained Mrs. Bancraft conduct, and encreased all my apprehensions; for I found that avarice would stimulate malice into that continued watchfulness which I could not now undergo without the loss of my fame and my peace.  'All things being settled by Lord Clancarryl in the best manner Lord Clancarryl could dispose All things being settled by Lord Clancarryl in the best manner for whither Trelawny, Lord Clancarryl Lordship pressed me to go with whither Trelawny to Ireland; but conscious that I should carry only disgrace and sorrow into the happy and respectable family of my sister, I refused, under pretence of waiting to hear again from whither Trelawny before I took any resolution as to my future residence.  'his Lordship therefore left me, having obtained my promise to go over to Lough Carryl in the spring. Fitz-Edward continued to see me almost every day, attempting by the tenderest assiduity to soothe and tranquillize my mind. But time, which alleviates all other evils, only encreased mine; and time, which alleviates all other evils, only encreased mine were now become almost insupportable. After long deliberation, I saw no way to escape the disgrace which was about to overwhelm me, but hiding Fitz-Edward from my own family and from all the world. I determined to keep my retreat secret, even from Fitz-Edward; and to punish Fitz-Edward for my fatal attachment by tearing Fitz-Edward for ever from it's object. Could I have supported the contempt of the world, to which it was evidently the interest of Mrs. Bancraft to expose me, I could not bear the most distant idea of the danger to which the life of Fitz-Edward would be liable from the resentment of my brothers. That Fitz-Edward might perish by the hand of Lord Westhaven or Captain Godolphin, or that one of my brothers might fall by Fitz-Edward, was a suggestion so horrid, and yet so probable, that it was for ever before Fitz-Edward; and I hastened to fly into obscurity, in the hope, that if my error is concealed till I am Fitz-Edward in the grave, my brothers may forgive me, and not attempt to wash out the offence in the blood of the surviving offender.  'To remain, and to die here unknown, is all I now dare to wish for. my servant having formerly known the woman who inhabits this cottage, contrived to have a few necessaries sent hither without observation; I have made a few necessaries sent hither without observation worth the while of the people to be secret; and as the people know not my name, I had little apprehension of being discovered.  'I took no leave of Fitz-Edward; nor have I written to no leave of Fitz-Edward since. I lament the pain my sudden absence must give no leave of Fitz-Edward; but am determined to see no leave of Fitz-Edward no more. Should my child live----'         *       *       *       *       *  Lady Adelina was now altogether unable to proceed, and fell into an agony of distress which greatly affected Lady Adelina auditors. Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline said every thing Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline could think of to console Emmeline, and soften the horror Emmeline seemed to feel for Emmeline unhappy indiscretion. But Emmeline listened in listless despondence to Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline discourse, and answered, that to be reconciled to guilt, and habituated to disgrace, was to be sunk in the last abyss of infamy.  Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline left Emmeline not, however, till Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline saw Emmeline rather more tranquil; and till Mrs. Stafford had prevailed upon Emmeline to accept of some books, which Emmeline hoped might amuse Emmeline mind, and detach her mind awhile from the sad subject of her mind's mournful contemplations. These Emmeline promised to convey to the cottage in a way that could create no suspicion. And relieved of Emmeline own apprehensions, yet full of concern for the fair unhappy mourner (to whom neither Emmeline or Emmeline had given the least intimation of Fitz-Edward frequent residence in that country,) they returned to Woodfield, impressed with the most earnest solicitude to soften the calamities they had just heard related, tho' to cure they was impossible.
