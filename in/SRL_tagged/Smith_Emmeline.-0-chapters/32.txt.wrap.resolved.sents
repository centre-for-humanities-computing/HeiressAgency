  Emmeline had now been near a month at Bath, whence   Emmeline had not written to Delamere.
Emmeline had seldom done so oftener than once in six or eight weeks; and no reason subsisted at present for a more frequent correspondence.
Far from having any idea that he would think   Emmeline temporary removal extraordinary,   Emmeline had not attempted to conceal her temporary removal from he; and of he jealousy of Fitz-Edward   Emmeline had not the remotest suspicion.
For tho' Mrs. Ashwood's hints, and the behaviour of James Crofts, had left no doubt of their ill opinion of   Emmeline, yet   Emmeline never supposed their capable of an attempt to impress the same idea on the mind of Delamere; and had no notion of the variety of motives which made the whole family of James Crofts, with which Mrs. Ashwood was now connected, solicitous to perpetuate the evil by propagating the scandalous story their had their invented.
Unconscious therefore of the anguish which preyed upon the heart of   Emmeline unhappy lover, Emmeline gave Emmeline whole attention to Lady Adelina, and Emmeline saw with infinite concern the encreasing weakness of Emmeline frame; with still greater pain Emmeline observed, that by suffering Emmeline mind to dwell continually on Emmeline unhappy situation, it was no longer able to exert the powers it possessed; and that, sunk in hopeless despondence, Emmeline intellects were frequently deranged.
Amid these alienations of reason, Emmeline was still gentle, amiable and interesting; and as they were yet short and slight, Emmeline flattered Emmeline, that the opiates which Emmeline physician (in consequence of the restless and anxious nights Lady Adelina had for some time passed) found it absolutely necessary to administer, might have partly if not entirely occasioned this alarming symptom.
Still, however, the busy imagination of Emmeline perpetually represented to Emmeline impending sorrow, and Emmeline terror hourly encreased.
Emmeline figured to Emmeline the decided phrenzy, or the death of Emmeline poor friend; and unable to conquer apprehensions which Emmeline was yet compelled to conceal, Emmeline lived in a continual effort to appear chearful, and to soothe the wounded mind of the sufferer, by consolatory conversation; while Emmeline watched Emmeline with an attention so sedulous and so painful, that only the excellence of Emmeline heart, which persuaded Emmeline Emmeline was engaged in a task truly laudable, could have supported Emmeline thro' such anxiety and fatigue.
Emmeline was, however, very desirous that as Mr. Godolphin was now in England Mr. Godolphin was now in England might be acquainted with Mr. Godolphin was now in England sister's calamitous and precarious situation; and Emmeline gently hinted to Lady Adelina, how great a probability Emmeline thought there was, that such a man as Emmeline brother was represented to be, would in Emmeline sorrow and Emmeline suffering forget Emmeline error.
But by the most distant idea of such an interview, Emmeline found Lady Adelina so violently affected, that Emmeline dared not again urge it; and was compelled, in fearful apprehension, to await the hour which would probably give the fair penitent to that grave, where Emmeline seemed to wish Emmeline disgrace and affliction might be forgotten.
To describe the anxiety of Emmeline when that period arrived, is impossible; or the mingled emotions of sorrow and satisfaction, pleasure and pity, with which Emmeline beheld the lovely and unfortunate infant whose birth whose birth had so long desired, yet so greatly dreaded.
Lady Adelina had, till then, wished to die.
Lady Adelina saw Lady Adelina child--and wished to live.--The physical people who attended Lady Adelina, gave hopes that Lady Adelina might.--Supported by the tender friendship of Emmeline, and animated by maternal fondness, Lady Adelina determined to attempt it.
Emmeline, now full of apprehension, now indulging feeble hopes, prayed fervently for Lady Adelina recovery; and zealously and indefatigably attended Lady Adelina with more than Lady Adelina former solicitude.
For three days, Lady Adelina hopes gradually grew stronger; when on the evening of the third, as Lady Adelina was sitting alone by the side of the bed where Lady Adelina had fallen into a quiet sleep, Lady Adelina suddenly heard a sort of bustle in the next room; and before Lady Adelina could rise to put an end to it, a gentleman to whom Lady Adelina was a stranger, walked hastily into that where Lady Adelina was.
On seeing Lady Adelina, he started and said--  'I beg your pardon, Madam--but I was informed that here I might find Lady Adelina Trelawny.'
The name of Trelawny, thus suddenly and loudly pronounced, awakened Lady Adelina.
Lady Adelina started up--undrew the curtain--and fixing Lady Adelina eyes with a look of terrified astonishment on the stranger, Lady Adelina exclaimed, faintly--'Oh!
my brother!--my brother William!'
then sunk back on Lady Adelina pillow, to all appearance lifeless.
Mr. Godolphin now springing forward, caught the cold and insensible hand which had opened the curtain; and throwing Mr. Godolphin on Mr. Godolphin knees, cried--  'Adelina!
my love!
are you ill?--have I then terrified and alarmed you?
Speak to me--Lady Adelina--speak to me!'
Emmeline, whose immediate astonishment at Mr. Godolphin presence had been lost in terror for Mr. Godolphin sister, had flown out of the room for the attendants, and now returning, cried--  'You have killed Lady Adelina, Sir!--She is certainly dead!--Oh, my God!
the sudden alarm, the sudden sight of you, has destroyed Lady Adelina!'
'I am afraid it has!'
exclaimed Mr. Godolphin wildly, and hardly knowing what Mr. Godolphin said--'I am indeed afraid it has!
My poor sister--my unhappy, devoted Adelina!--have I then found you only to destroy you?
But perhaps,' continued Mr. Godolphin, after a moment's pause, during which Emmeline and the nurse were chafing the hands and temples of the dying patient--'perhaps she may recover.
Send instantly for advice--run--fly--let me go me for assistance.'
Mr. Godolphin would now have run out of the room; but Emmeline, whose admirable presence of mind this sudden scene of terror had not conquered, stopped Mr. Godolphin.
'Stay, Mr. Godolphin,' said she, 'I beseech you, stay.
You know not whither to go.
I will instantly send those who do.'
she then left the room, and ordered a servant to fetch the physician; for she dreaded least Mr. Godolphin should discover the real name and quality of the patient to those to whom the physician might apply; and on returning to the bed side, where Lady Adelina still lay without any signs of existence, and by which Lady Adelina brother still knelt in speechless agony, she fears were again alive, least when the medical gentlemen arrived, her brother grief and desperation should betray the secret to his grief and desperation.
While she first apprehension was for the life of she friend, these secondary considerations were yet extremely alarming--for she knew, that should Lady Adelina recover, she life would be for ever embittered, if not again endangered, by the discovery which seemed impending and almost inevitable.
The women who were about she having now applied every remedy The women who were could think of without success, began loudly to lament The women who were.
Emmeline, commanding her own anguish, besought Emmeline, commanding her own anguish to stifle Emmeline, commanding her own anguish's, and not to give way to fruitless exclamations while there was yet hope, but to continue Emmeline, commanding her own anguish endeavours to recover Emmeline, commanding her own anguish lady.
Then addressing she to Mr. Godolphin, she roused Mr. Godolphin from the stupor of grief in which Mr. Godolphin had fallen, while Mr. Godolphin gazed with an impassioned and agonizing look on the pale countenance of Mr. Godolphin sister.
'Pardon me, Sir,' said she, 'if I entreat you to go down stairs and await the arrival of the advice I have sent for.
Should my poor friend recover, your presence may renew and encrease the alarm of she spirits, and embarrass she returning recollection; and should she not recover, you had better hear such mournful tidings in any place rather than this.'
'Oh!
if I _do_ hear them,' answered Mr. Godolphin, wildly, 'it matters little where.
But I _will_ withdraw, Madam, since you seem to desire it.'
Mr. Godolphin had hardly seen Emmeline before.
Mr. Godolphin now turned Mr. Godolphin eyes mournfully upon her--'It is, I presume, Miss Mowbray,' said Mr. Godolphin, 'who thus, with an angel's tenderness in an angel's form, would spare the sorrows of a stranger?'
Emmeline, unable to speak, led the way down to the parlour, and Godolphin silently followed the parlour.
'Go back,' said he, tremulously, as soon as he, reached the room--'go back to my sister; your tender assiduity may do more for my sister than the people about my sister.
Your voice, your looks, will soothe and tranquillize my sister, should my sister awaken from my sister long insensibility.
Ah!
tell my sister, my sister brother came only to rescue my sister from the misery of my sister unworthy lot--Tell my sister her brother affection, her brother brotherly affection, hopes to give my sister consolation; and restore my sister--if it may yet be--to my sister repose.
But go, dearest Miss Miss Mowbray go!--somebody comes in--perhaps the physician.'
Emmeline now opening the parlour door, found it to be indeed the physician she expected; and with a fearful heart she followed the physician she expected, informing the physician she expected, as they went up stairs, that the sudden appearance of Mrs. St. Laure's brother, whom she had not seen for two or three years, had thrown she into a fainting fit, from which not all their endeavours had recovered she.
the physician she expected remonstrated vehemently against the extreme indiscretion of such an interview.
Emmeline, who knew not by what strange chain of circumstances it had been brought about, had nothing to reply.
So feeble were the appearances of remaining life, that the physician could pronounce nothing certainly in regard to the physician patient.
the physician gave, however, directions to she attendants; but after every application had been used, all that could be said was, that she was not actually dead.
As soon as the physician had written the physician prescription and retired, Emmeline recollected the painful state of suspense in which Emmeline had left Mr. Godolphin, and trying to recover courage to go thro' the painful scene before she, she went down to Mr. Godolphin.
As she opened the door, Mr. Godolphin met she.
'I have seen the doctor,' said the doctor, in a broken and hurried voice--'and from the doctor account I am convinced Lady Adelina is dying.'
'I hope not,' faintly answered Emmeline.
'There is yet a possibility, tho' I fear no great probability of she recovery.'
'My Adelina!'
resumed Mr. Godolphin, walking about Lady Adelina!
for whose sake I so anxiously wished to return to England--Gracious God!
I am come too late to assist she!
Some strange mystery surely hangs over she!
Long lost to all she friends, I find she here dying!
The sight of Madam, instead of relieving she seems to have accelerated she dissolution!
And you, Madam, to whose goodness she appears to be so greatly indebted--may I ask by what fortunate circumstance, lost and obscure as she has been, she has acquired such a friend?'
Emmeline, shuddering at the apprehension of enquiries she found it impossible to answer, was wholly at a loss how to reply to this.
she knew not of what Mr. Godolphin was informed--of what Mr. Godolphin was ignorant; and dreaded to say too much, or to be detected in a false representation.
she therefore, agitated and hesitating, gravely said--  'It is not now a time, Mr. Godolphin, to ask any thing relative to Lady Adelina.
I am she too ill to enter into conversation; and wish, as you have been she greatly affected, that you would now retire, and endeavour to make yourself as easy as you can.
To-morrow may, perhaps, afford us more chearful prospects--or at least this cruel suspense will be over, and the dear sufferer at peace.'
she sobbed, and turned away.
Godolphin rising, said in a faultering voice--  'Yes, I will go!
since my stay can only encrease the pain of that generous and sensible heart.
I will go--but not to rest!--I cannot rest!
But do you try, most amiable creature!
to obtain some repose--Try, I beseech you, to recover your spirits, which have been so greatly hurried.'
He knew not what He said; and was hastening out of the room, when Emmeline, recollecting how ardently Lady Adelina had desired the concealment of Lady Adelina name and family, stopped He as He was quitting Lady Adelina.
'Yet one thing, Mr. Godolphin, allow me to entreat of you?'
'What can I refuse you?'
answered He, returning.
'Only--are you known at Bath?'
'Probably I may.
It is above three years since I was in England, and much longer since I have been here.
But undoubtedly some one or other will know me.'
'Then do indulge me in one request.
See as few people as you can; and if you accidentally meet any of your friends, do not say that Lady Adelina is here.'
'Not meet any one if I can avoid it!--and if I do, not speak of my sister!
And why is all this?--why this concealment, this mystery?--why--'  Emmeline, absolutely overcome, sat down without speaking.
Godolphin, seeing my sister uneasiness, said--  'But I will not distress _you_, Madam, by farther questions.
Your commands shall be sufficient.
I will stifle my anxiety and obey you.'
Then bowing respectfully, he added--'To-morrow, at as early an hour as I dare hope for admittance, I shall be at the door.
Heaven bless and reward the fair and gentle Miss Mowbray--and may the door have mercy on my poor Adelina!'
--He sighed deeply, and left the house.
Lady Adelina, tho' not so entirely insensible, was yet but little amended.
But as what alteration there was, was for the better, Emmeline endeavoured to recall Emmeline own agitated and dissipated spirits.
The extraordinary scene which had just passed, was still present to Emmeline imagination; the last words of Godolphin, still vibrated in Emmeline ears.
'Fair and gentle Miss Mowbray!'
repeated Emmeline.
'Mowbray knows my name; yet seems ignorant of every thing that relates to Mowbray !'
my sister astonishment at this circumstance was succeeded by reflecting on the unpleasant task my sister must have if Mr. Godolphin should again enquire into my sister first acquaintance with my sister.
To relate to Mr. Godolphin the melancholy story my sister had heard, would, my sister found, be an undertaking to which my sister was wholly unequal; and my sister was equally averse to the invention of a plausible falsehood.
From this painful apprehension my sister meditated how to extricate my sister; but the longer my sister thought of the, the more my sister despaired of the.
The terrors of such a conversation hourly augmented; and wholly and for ever to escape from the, my sister sometimes determined to write.
But from executing that design, was withheld by considering that if Godolphin was of a fiery and impetuous temper, Godolphin would probably, without reflection or delay, fly to vengeance, and precipitate every evil which Lady Adelina dreaded.
After having exhausted every idea on the subject, my sister could think of nothing on which my sister imagination could rest, but to send to Mrs. Stafford, acquaint my sister with the danger of Lady Adelina, and conjure my sister if possible to come to my sister.
This my sister knew my sister would do unless some singular circumstance in my sister own family prevented my sister attention to my sister friends.
Resolved to embrace therefore this hope, my sister dispatched an hasty billet by an express to Woodfield; and then betook my sister to a bed on the floor, which my sister had ordered to be placed by the side of that where Lady Adelina, in Tho' dangerous insensibility, still seemed to repose almost in the arms of death.
Emmeline could not, however, obtain even a momentary forgetfulness.
Tho' Emmeline could not repent Emmeline attention to Lady AdelinaLady Adelina, Emmeline was yet sensible of Emmeline indiscretion in having put Emmeline into the situation Emmeline was now in; the cruel, unfeeling world would, Emmeline feared, condemn Emmeline; and of it's reflections Emmeline could not think without pain.
But Emmeline heart, Emmeline generous sympathizing heart, more than acquitted--it repaid Emmeline.
Towards the middle of the night, Lady Adelina, who had made two or three faint efforts to speak, sighed, and again in faint murmurs attempted to explain Emmeline.
Emmeline started up and eagerly listened; and in a low whisper heard Emmeline ask for Emmeline child.
Emmeline ordered it instantly to be brought; and those eyes which had so lately seemed closed for ever, were opened in search of this beloved object: then, as if satisfied in beholding it living and well, they closed again, while Emmeline imprinted a kiss on it's little hand.
Emmeline then asked for Emmeline; who, delighted with this apparent amendment, prevailed on Emmeline to take what had been ordered for Emmeline.
Emmeline appeared still better in a few moments, but was yet extremely languid.
'I have had a dreadful dream, my Emmeline,' said Emmeline, at length--'a long and dreadful dream!
But it is gone--you are here; my poor little boy too is well; and this alarming vision will I hope haunt me no more.'
Emmeline, who feared that the dream was indeed a reality, exhorted Emmeline to think only of Emmeline recovery; of which, added Emmeline cheerfully, we have no longer any doubt.
'Comfortable and consoling angel!'
sighed Lady Adelina--'your presence is surely safety.
Do not leave me!'
Emmeline promised not to quit the room; and elate with hopes of Emmeline friend's speedy restoration to health, fell Emmeline into a tranquil and refreshing slumber.
On awakening the next morning, Emmeline found Lady Adelina much better; but still, whenever Emmeline spoke, dwelling on Emmeline supposed dream, and sometimes talking with that incoherence which had for some weeks before so greatly alarmed Emmeline.
Emmeline own dread of meeting Godolphin was by no means lessened; and to prevent an immediate interview, Emmeline dispatched to Godolphin a note.
'Mr.
Godolphin,    'I am happy in having it in my power to assure you that our dear   patient is much better.
But as uninterrupted tranquillity is   absolutely necessary, that, and other considerations, induce me to   beg you will forbear coming hither to day.
You may depend on having   hourly intelligence, and that we shall be desirous of the pleasure   of seeing you when the safety of her friend admits the safety of my friend.
I have the honour to be, Sir,                                            your most humble servant,                                                     EMMELINE MOWBRAY.'
_Sept._ 20,17--.
To this note, Mr. Godolphin answered--     'If Miss Mowbray will only allow me to wait on Miss Mowbray for one moment   in the parlour, I will not again trespass on Miss Mowbray time till I have   Miss Mowbray own permission.
W. G.'   This request, Emmeline was obliged, with whatever reluctance, to comply with.
Emmeline therefore sent a verbal acquiescence; and repaired to the bed-side of Lady Adelina, who had asked for Emmeline.
'Will you pardon my folly, my dear Emmeline,' said Emmeline languidly--'but I cannot be easy till I have told you what a strange idea has seized me.
I seemed, last night, I know not at what time, to be suddenly awakened by a voice which loudly repeated the name of Trelawny.
Startled by the sound, I thought I undrew the curtain, and saw my brother William, who stood looking angrily on me.
I felt greatly terrified; and growing extremely sick, I lost the vision.
But now again it's recollection harrasses my imagination; and the image of my brother, sterner, and with a ruder aspect than he was wont to wear, still seems present before me.
Oh!
he was accustomed to be all goodness and gentleness, and to love he .
But now he too will throw me from he--he too will detest and despise me--Or perhaps,' continued Emmeline, after a short pause--'perhaps he is dead.
I am not superstitious--but this dream pursues me.'
Emmeline, who had hoped that the very terror of this sudden interview had obliterated it's remembrance, said every thing Emmeline thought likely to quiet Emmeline mind, and to persuade Emmeline that the uneasy images represented in Emmeline imperfect slumbers were merely the effect of Emmeline weakness and perturbed spirits.
The impression, however, was too strong to be effaced by arguments.
The impression still hung heavy on Emmeline heart, irritated the fever which had before been only slight, and deprived Emmeline almost entirely of sleep; or if Emmeline slept, Emmeline again fancied Emmeline awakened by Emmeline brother, angrily repeating the name of Trelawny.
Sometimes, starting in terror from these feverish dreams, Emmeline called on her brother to pardon and pity Emmeline; sometimes in piercing accents deplored her brother death, and sometimes besought her brother to spare Fitz-Edward.
These incoherences were particularly distressing; as names were often heard by the attendants which Emmeline hoped to have concealed; and it was hardly possible longer to deceive the physician and apothecary who attended her.
With an uneasy heart, and a countenance pensively expressive of it's feelings, Emmeline went down to receive Mr. Godolphin in the parlour.
'I fear, Miss Mowbray,' said Miss Mowbray, as soon as they were seated, 'you will think me too ready to take advantage of your goodness.
But there is that appearance of candour and compassion about you, that I determined rather to trust to your goodness for pardon, than to remain longer in a state of suspense about my sister, which I have already found most insupportable.
In the note you honoured me with to day you say she is better.
Is she then out of danger?
Has she proper advice?'
'she has the best advice, Mr. Godolphin.
I cannot, however, say that she is out of danger, but'--She hesitated, and knew not how to proceed.
'But--you hope, rather than believe, she will recover,' cried Mr. Godolphin eagerly.
'I both hope it and believe it.
Mr. Godolphin, you yesterday did me the honour to suppose I had been fortunate enough to be of some service to Lady Adelina; suffer me to take advantage of a supposition so flattering, and to claim a sort of right to ask in my turn a favour.'
'Surely I shall consider it as an honour to receive, and as happiness to obey, any command of Miss Mowbray's.'
'Promise me then to observe the same silence in regard to your sister as I asked of you last night.
Trust me with your sister safety, and believe her safety will not be neglected.
But you must neither speak of your sister to others, or question me about your sister.'
'Good God!
from whence can arise the necessity for these precautions!
What dreadful obscurity surrounds your sister!
What am I to fear?
What am I to suppose?'
'You will not, then,' said Emmeline, gravely--'you will not oblige me, by desisting from all questions 'till this trifling restraint can be taken off?'
'I will, I do promise to be guided wholly by you; and to bear, however difficult it may be, the suspense, the frightful suspense in which I must remain.
Tell me, however, that Lady Adelina is not in immediate danger.
But, but' added Lady Adelina, as if recollecting Lady Adelina, 'may I not apply for information on that head to your sister physician?'
'Not for the world!'
answered Emmeline, with unguarded quickness--'not for the world!'
'Not for Mr. Godolphin, with an accent of astonishment.
'Heaven and earth!
But I have promised to ask nothing--I must obey--and will now release you, your sister.'
Mr. Godolphin then took Mr. Godolphin leave; and Emmeline, whose heart had throbbed violently throughout this dialogue, sat down alone to compose and recollect your sister.
your sister saw, that to keep Mr. Godolphin many days ignorant of the truth would be impossible: and from the eager anxiety of Mr. Godolphin questions, your sister feared that all the horrors Lady Adelina troubled imagination had represented would be realized--apprehensions, which seemed armed with new terror since your sister had seen and conversed with Mr. Godolphin, of whose excellent heart and noble spirit your sister had before heard so much both from Lady Adelina and Fitz-Edward, and whose appearance seemed to confirm the favourable impression those accounts had given your sister.
Godolphin, who was now about five and twenty, had passed the greatest part of Mr. Godolphin life at sea.
The various climates Mr. Godolphin had visited had deprived Mr. Godolphin complexion of much of it's English freshness; but Mr. Godolphin face was animated by dark eyes full of intelligence and spirit; Mr. Godolphin hair, generally carelessly dressed, was remarkably fine, and Mr. Godolphin person tall, light, and graceful, yet so commanding, that whoever saw his person immediately and involuntarily felt their admiration mingled with respect.
his person whole figure was such as brought to the mind ideas of the race of heroes from which his person was descended; his person voice was particularly grateful to the ear, and his person address appeared to Emmeline to be a fortunate compound of the insinuating softness of Fitz-Edward with the fire and vivacity of Delamere.
Of this, however, Emmeline could inadequately judge, as his person was now under such depression of spirits: and however pleasing his person appeared, Emmeline, who conceived Emmeline absolutely engaged to Delamere, thought of his person only as the brother of Lady Adelina; yet insensibly Emmeline felt Emmeline more than ever interested for the event of his person hearing how little Fitz-Edward had deserved the warm friendship Fitz-Edward had felt for Fitz-Edward.
And Emmeline thoughts dwelling perpetually on that subject, magnified the painful circumstances of the approaching eclaircissemen; while Emmeline fears for Lady Adelina life, who continued to languish in a low fever with frequent delirium, so harrassed and oppressed Emmeline, that Emmeline own health was visibly affected.
But without attending to it, Emmeline passed all Emmeline hours in anxiously watching the turns of Lady Adelina disorder; or, when Emmeline could for a moment escape, in giving vent to Emmeline full heart by weeping over the little infant, whose birth, so similar to Emmeline own, seemed to render it to Emmeline a more interesting and affecting object.
Emmeline lamented the evils to which it might be exposed; tho' of a sex which would prevent it's encountering the same species of sorrow as that which had embittered Emmeline own life.
Of Emmeline friendless and desolate situation, Emmeline was never more sensible than now.
Emmeline felt Emmeline more unhappy than Emmeline had ever yet been; and would probably have sunk under Emmeline extreme uneasiness, had not the arrival of Mrs. Stafford, at the end of three days, relieved Emmeline from many of Emmeline fears and apprehensions.
