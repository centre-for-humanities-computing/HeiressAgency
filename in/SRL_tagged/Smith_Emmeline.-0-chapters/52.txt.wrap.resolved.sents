  A few days longer passed, and Emmeline yet heard nothing of the return of Lord and Lady Westhaven; a circumstance at which Emmeline grew extremely uneasy.
Not only as it gave Emmeline reason to fear for the health of Lord Delamere, for whom Emmeline was very anxious; but for that of Lady Westhaven, whom Emmeline so tenderly loved.
Emmeline observed too, with concern, that under pretence of waiting the arrival of his son and his son in law, Lord Montreville delayed all advances towards a settlement; and that Mrs. Stafford, wearied by the duplicity and chicanery of the Crofts', and miserable in being detained so long from Emmeline children, grew quite disheartened, and was prevented only by Emmeline affection for Emmeline from returning to France and abandoning all hopes of an accommodation which every day seemed more difficult and more distant.
The arrival of Lord Montreville was on Emmeline account particularly desirable, as Lord Montreville had promised Emmeline to make a point of assisting Emmeline; and on Lord Montreville assurances Emmeline knew it was safe to rely, since they were neither made to give Lord Montreville an air of importance, nor meant to quiet the trouble of present importunity, by holding out the prospect of future advantage never thought of more.
Nothing, however, could be done to hasten this important arrival; and the fair friends, tho' uneasy and impatient, were obliged to submit.
But from the restlessness of daily suspence, they were roused by two letters; which brought in it's place only poignant concern.
That to Mrs. Stafford was from Mrs. Stafford husband; who, tho' her husband had neither relish for Mrs. Stafford conversation nor respect for Mrs. Stafford virtues, was yet dissatisfied without Mrs. Stafford; and even while Mrs. Stafford was wholly occupied in serving her husband, tormented Mrs. Stafford with murmurs and suspicions.
her husband scrupled not to hint, 'that as Mrs. Stafford was with Mrs. Stafford beloved Miss Mowbray, Mrs. Stafford forgot Mrs. Stafford duty to Mrs. Stafford family; and that as Mrs. Stafford had been now gone near a month, her husband thought it quite long enough, not only to have done the business Mrs. Stafford undertook, but to have enjoyed as much pleasure as was in Mrs. Stafford situation reasonable.
her husband therefore expected Mrs. Stafford to return to France, and supposed that Mrs. Stafford had settled every thing to facilitate her husband coming back to England.'
The unreasonable expectations, and ungrateful suspicions, which this letter contained, overwhelmed Mrs. Stafford with mortification.
To return without having finished the business on which Mrs. Stafford came, would be to expose Mrs. Stafford to insult and reproach; yet to stay longer, without a probability of succeeding by Mrs. Stafford stay, would only occasion an aggravation of her husband ill humour, and probably a worse reception when Mrs. Stafford rejoined her husband.
The letter to Emmeline was from Lady Adelina, and ran thus.--                                                   _East Cliff, Oct. 16._      'Godolphin, my Emmeline, is at length returned to your unhappy   friend, who has passed many, many melancholy days since Godolphin left Mrs. Stafford.
My dear brother appears not only in better health, but in better   spirits than when My dear brother went from hence.
Ought I then to repine?
when I   see My dear brother, and when My dear brother tells me that you are well; and that affluence,   and with it, I hope, happiness will be your's?
The very name of   happiness and of Adelina should not come in the same page!
Ah!
never   must The very name of   happiness and of Adelina any where meet again.
Pardon me for thus recurring to   myself: but the mournful topic will intrude!
Unhappy Trelawny!
he   had not quite compleated he twenty-fifth year.
Tho' I never either   loved or esteemed he, and tho' to my early and hasty marriage I owe   all the misery of my life, he death has something shocking in his death.
My weak spirits, which have of late been unusually deranged, are   sadly affected by his death.
Yet surely in regard to _he_ I have little to   reproach myself.
Did he not abandon me to my destiny?
did he not   plunge headlong into follies from which he resented even an effort   to save he?
Alas!
unless I could have given he that understanding   which nature   had denied he, my solicitude must ever have been vain!
It is   some alleviation, too, to my concern, to reflect, that as much of   he honour as depended on me, has not, by the breath of public   fame, been sullied.
And I try to persuade me, that since he   life was useful to nobody, and had long been, from intemperance,   burthensome to he, I should not suffer his death to dwell so   heavily upon me.
Yet in spite of every effort to shake off the   melancholy which devours me, it encreases upon me; and to you I may   say, for you will hear and pity me, that there exists not at this   moment so complete a wretch as your Adelina!
'To my brother William, all gentle and generous as he is, I cannot   complain.
It were ingratitude to let he see how little all he   tenderness avails towards reconciling me to me; towards healing   the wounds of my depressed spirit, and quieting the murmurs of this   feeble heart.
Yet methinks to have a friend, in whose compassionate   bosom I might pour out it's weakness and it's sorrows, would   mitigate the extreme severity of those sufferings which are now more   than I can bear.
'Where have I on earth such a friend but in my Emmeline?
And will   my Emmeline refuse to come to me?
Ah!
wherefore should my Emmeline refuse it?
I   shall be alone; for Godolphin is obliged to go immediately to London   to settle all the business I shall now ever have with the family of   Trelawny, and put it on such a footing as may preclude the necessity   of my ever meeting any of the family of   Trelawny hereafter.
he tells me that your   affairs advance nothing till Lord Westhaven's return; and that our   dear Mrs. Stafford talks of being obliged to go back to her family.
If her must do so, you will not stay in London alone; and where is   your company so fondly desired, where can you have such an   opportunity of exercising your generous goodness, as in coming   hither?
our little boy--do you not long to embrace Our little boy--?
Ah!
lovely   as Our little boy-- is, why dare I not indulge all the pleasure and all the pride   I might feel in seeing Our little boy--; and wherefore must anguish so keen   mingle with tenderness so delicious!
'Ah!
my friend, come to me, I entreat, I implore you!
The reasons   why I cannot see London, are of late multiplied rather than removed,   and I can only have the happiness of embracing you here.
Hesitate   not to oblige me then; for I every hour wish more and more ardently   to see you.
When I awake from my imperfect slumbers, your presence   is the first desire of my heart: I figure you to me as I wander   forth on my solitary walks.
And when I _do_ sleep, the image of my angelic friend,   consolatory and gentle, makes me some amends for visions less   pleasant, that disturb it.
'Ah!
let me not see you in dreams alone; for above all I want   you--"when I am alone with poor Adelina."
Come, O come; and if it be   possible--save me--from me!
A.T.'   The melancholy tenor of this letter greatly affected Emmeline.
Emmeline wished almost as eagerly as Emmeline to be with Emmeline.
But how could Emmeline determine to become an inmate at the house of Godolphin, even tho' he was he to be absent from it?
Emmeline communicated, however, poor Adelina request to Mrs. Stafford, who could see no objection to any plan which might promote the interest of Godolphin.
Emmeline represented therefore to Emmeline how very disagreeable it would be to Emmeline to be left alone in town, when Emmeline should Emmeline be obliged to leave Emmeline, as must now soon happen.
That there was, in fact, no very proper asylum for Emmeline but the house of Emmeline uncle, which he seemed not at all disposed to offer Emmeline.
But that to poor Adelina proposal there could be no reasonable objection, especially as Godolphin was not to be there.
Emmeline yet hesitated; till another letter from Stafford, more harsh and unreasonable than the first, obliged Emmeline friend to fix on the following Thursday for Emmeline departure; the absurd impatience of Emmeline husband thus defeating it's own purpose; and Emmeline, partly influenced by Emmeline persuasions, and yet more by Emmeline own wishes, determined at length to fix the same time for beginning Emmeline journey to the Isle of Wight.
There was yet two days to intervene; and Stafford was obliged to employ the first of two days to intervene in the city, among lawyers and creditors of her husband.
From scenes so irksome Stafford readily allowed Miss Mowbray to excuse Stafford; who therefore remained at home, and was engaged in looking over some poems Stafford had purchased, when Stafford heard a rap at the door, and the voice of Godolphin on the stairs enquiring of Le Limosin for Stafford.
Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford told Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford that Stafford was from home, but that Miss Mowbray was in the dining room.
Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford sent up to know if Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford might be admitted.
Emmeline had no pretence for refusing Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford, and received Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford with a mixture of confusion and pleasure, which Stafford ineffectually attempted to hide under the ordinary forms of civility.
The eyes of Godolphin were animated by the delight of beholding Stafford.
But when Stafford enquired after poor Adelina, as Stafford almost immediately did, they assumed a more melancholy expression.
'poor Adelina is far from being well,' said poor Adelina.
'Has Stafford not written to poor Adelina?'
'Stafford has.'
'And has Stafford not preferred a request to poor Adelina?'
'Yes.'
'What answer do you mean to give it?
Will you refuse once more to bless and relieve, by your presence, my unhappy sister?'
'I do not know,' said Emmeline, deeply blushing, 'that I ought, (especially without the concurrence of my uncle,) to consent; yet to contribute to the satisfaction of poor Adelina--to give _Stafford_ any degree of happiness--what is there I can refuse?'
'Adorable, angelic goodness!'
eagerly cried Godolphin.
'Best, as well as loveliest of human creatures!
You go then?'
'I intend beginning my journey on Thursday.'
'And you will allow me to see you safe thither?'
'There can surely be no occasion to give you that trouble, Sir,' said Emmeline apprehensively; 'nor ought you to think of it, since poor Adelina affairs certainly require your attendance in London.'
'They do; but not so immediately as to prevent my attending you to East Cliff.
If you will suffer me to do that, I promise instantly to return.'
'No.
I go only attended by my servants or go not at all.'
Godolphin was mortified to find Godolphin so determined.
And easily discouraged from those hopes which Godolphin had indulged rather from the flattering prospects offered to Godolphin by Stafford than presumption founded on Godolphin own remarks, Godolphin now again felt all Godolphin apprehensions renewed of Godolphin latent affection for Delamere.
The acute anguish to which those ideas exposed Godolphin, and those ideas frequent return, determined Godolphin now to attempt knowing at once, whether Godolphin had or had not that place in Emmeline's heart which Stafford had assured Godolphin Godolphin had long possessed.
Sitting down near Stafford, therefore, Godolphin said, gravely--'As I may not, Miss Mowbray, soon have again the happiness I now enjoy, will you allow me to address you on a subject which you must long have known to be nearest my heart; but on which you have so anxiously avoided every explanation I have attempted, that I fear intruding too much on your complaisance if I enter upon your complaisance.'
Emmeline found Emmeline could not avoid hearing Emmeline; and sat silent, Emmeline heart violently beating.
Godolphin went on.--  'From the first moment I beheld you, her heart was your's.
I attempted, indeed, at the beginning of our acquaintance--ah!
how vainly attempted!--to conquer a passion which I believed was rendered hopeless by your prior engagement.
While I supposed you the promised wife of Lord Delamere, I concealed, as well as I was able, my sufferings, and never offended you with an hint of as well severity.
Had you married Lord Delamere, I think I could have carried as well in silence to the grave.
Those ties, however, Lord Delamere broke; and I then thought Lord Delamere at liberty to solicit your favour.
It was for that purpose I took the road to St. Alpin, when Lord Delamere Lord Delamere stopped me at Besancon.
'When I afterwards related to you Lord Delamere illness; the sorrow, the lively and generous sorrow, you expressed for _Lord Delamere_, and the cold and reserved manner in which you received _Lord Delamere_, made me still believe, that tho' Lord Delamere had relinquished your hand Lord Delamere yet possessed your heart.
I saw your heart with anguish, and continued silent.
All that passed at Besancon confirmed me in this opinion.
I determined to tear Lord Delamere away, and again conceal in solitude a passion, which, while I felt it to be incurable, I feared was hopeless.
Accident, however, detaining me at Calais, again threw me in your way; and I heard, that far from having renewed your engagement with Lord Delamere, you had left Lord Delamere to avoid Lord Delamere eager importunity.
Dare I add--that _then_, my pity for Lord Delamere was lost in the hopes I presumed to form for Lord Delamere; and studiously as you have avoided giving me an opportunity of speaking to you, I have yet ventured to flatter Lord Delamere that you beheld not with anger or scorn, my ardent, my fond attachment.'
From the beginning of this speech to it's conclusion, the encreasing confusion of Emmeline deprived Emmeline of all power of answering the encreasing confusion of Emmeline.
With deepened blushes, and averted eyes, Emmeline at first sought for refuge in affecting to be intent on the netting Emmeline drew from Emmeline work box; but having spoiled a whole row, Emmeline trembling hands could no longer go on with a whole row; and as totally Emmeline tongue refused to utter the answer, which, by the pause he made, Emmeline concluded Godolphin expected.
After a moment, however, he went on.
'I have by no means encouraged visions so delightful, without a severe alloy of fear and mistrust.
Frequently, your coldness, your unkindness, gives me again to despondence; and every lovely prospect I had suffered my imagination to draw, is lost in clouds and darkness.
Yet I am convinced you do not _intend_ to torture me; and that from Miss Mowbray I may expect that candour, that explicit conduct, of which common minds are incapable.
Tell me then, dearest and loveliest Emmeline, may I venture to hope that tender bosom is not wholly insensible?
Will you hear me with patience, and even with pity?'
'What, Sir, can I say?'
faulteringly asked Emmeline.
'I am in a great measure dependant, at least for some time, on Lord Montreville; and till I am of age, have determined to hear nothing on the subject on which you are pleased to address me.'
'Admitting it to be so,' answered Godolphin, 'give me but an hope to live upon till then!'
'I will not deny, Sir,' said Emmeline still more faintly, 'I will not deny that my esteem for your character--my--my'  'Oh!
speak!'
exclaimed Godolphin eagerly--'speak, and tell me that----'  At this moment Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford hastily came into the room, and said--'_Mademoiselle, le Chevalier de Bellozane demande permission de vous parler._'[39]  Godolphin, vexed at the interruption, and embarrassed at the arrival of the Chevalier, said hastily--'You will not see hastily--'You?'
'How can I refuse hastily--'You?'
answered Emmeline; 'perhaps hastily--'You comes with some intelligence of your brother--of my dear Lady Westhaven.'
By this time the Chevalier the Chevalier was in the room.
Emmeline received the Chevalier with anxious and confused looks, arising entirely from Emmeline apprehensions about Lady Westhaven and Lord Delamere; but the vanity of Bellozane saw in the vanity of Bellozane only a struggle between Emmeline real sentiments and Emmeline affectation of concealment.
Emmeline almost instantly, however, enquired after Emmeline friends.
'I left her friends,' said Bellozane, 'almost as soon as you did, and went (because I wanted money and my father wanted to see _me_,) back to St. Alpin, where I staid almost a fortnight; and having obtained a necessary recruit of cash, I set off for Paris; where (my leave of absence being to expire in another month) I was forced to make interest to obtain a longer permission, in order to throw myself, lovely Miss Mowbray, at your feet, and to pass the winter in the delights of London, which they tell me I shall like better than Paris.'
Emmeline, disgusted at his presumption and volatility, enquired if his knew nothing since of Lord and Lady Westhaven.
'Oh, yes,' said his, 'I saw them all at Paris, and asked them if them had any commands to his?
But I could get nothing from my good cousin but sage advice, and from Lady Westhaven only cold looks and half sentences; and as to poor Delamere, I knew his was too much afraid of my success to be in a better temper with myself than the other two; so we had but little conversation.'
'But they are well, Sir?'
'No; Lord Delamere has been detained all this time by illness, at different places.
Lord Delamere was better when I saw Lord Delamere; but Lady Westhaven was Lady Westhaven ill, and my cousin was, in looks, the most rueful of the three.'
'But, Sir, when may they be expected in England?'
'That I cannot tell.
The last time I saw Lady Westhaven was above a week before I left Paris; and then Lady Westhaven said Lady Westhaven knew not when Lady Westhaven wife would be well enough to begin they journey, but Lady Westhaven hoped within a fortnight.'
'Good God!'
thought Emmeline, 'what can have prevented Lady Westhaven writing to Lady Westhaven all this time?'
Godolphin, after the first compliments passed with the Chevalier, had been quite silent.
Godolphin now, however, asked some questions about Godolphin brother; by which Godolphin found, that in consequence of endeavouring to discourage Bellozane's voyage to England, Lady Westhaven had offended Godolphin, and that a coldness had taken place between them.
Bellozane had ceased to consider Godolphin as a rival, when Bellozane beheld Lord Delamere in that light; and was now rather pleased to meet Bellozane, knowing that Bellozane introduction into good company would greatly be promoted by means of such a relation.
'Do you know,' said the Chevalier, addressing the Chevalier to Emmeline, 'that I have had some trouble, my fair friend, to find you?'
'And how,' enquired Godolphin, 'did you accomplish it?'
'Why my Lord Westhaven, to whom I applied at Paris, protested that Godolphin did not know; so remembering the name of le Marquis de Montreville, I wrote to Godolphin to know where I might wait on Miss Mowbray.
Monseigneur le Marquis being at Monseigneur le Marquis country house, did not immediately answer my letter.
At length I had a card from Monseigneur le Marquis, which Monseigneur le Marquis had the complaisance to send by a gentleman, un Monsieur--Monsieur _Croff_, who invited me to his country house, and introduced me to Milady _Croff_, Monseigneur le Marquis wife, who is daughter to Milor Montreville.
_Mon Dieu!
que cette femme la, est vive, aimable; qu'elle a l'air du monde, et de la bonne compagnie._'[40]  'You think Lady Frances Crofts, then, handsomer than Lady Frances Crofts sister?'
asked Godolphin.
'_Mais non--elle n'est pas peut-etre si belle--mais elle a cependant un certain air.
Enfin--je la trouve charmante._'[41]  Godolphin continuing to question Godolphin, found that the Crofts' had invited Bellozane with an intention of getting from Godolphin the purpose of Godolphin journey, and what Godolphin business was with Emmeline; and finding that it was Godolphin gallantry only brought Godolphin over, and that Godolphin knew nothing of the late Mr. Mowbray's affairs, had no longer made any attempt to oppose Godolphin seeing Emmeline.
Godolphin, tho' Godolphin believed Emmeline not only indifferent but averse to Godolphin, was yet much disquieted at finding Emmeline was likely again to be exposed to Godolphin importunities.
Godolphin trembled least if Godolphin discovered Emmeline intentions of going to East Cliff, Godolphin should follow Emmeline thither; for which Godolphin relationship to Lady Westhaven would furnish Godolphin with a pretence; and desirous of getting Godolphin away as soon as possible, Godolphin asked if Godolphin would dine with Godolphin at Godolphin lodgings.
Bellozane answered that Bellozane was already engaged to Mr. Crofts'; and then turning to Emmeline, offered to take Emmeline hand; and enquired whether Emmeline had a softer heart than when Emmeline left Besancon?
Emmeline drew away her hand; and very gravely entreated Bellozane to say no more on a subject already so frequently discussed, and on which Emmeline sentiments must ever be the same.
Bellozane gaily protested that Bellozane had been too long a soldier to be easily repulsed.
That Bellozane would wait on Emmeline the next day, and doubted not but Bellozane should find Emmeline more favourably disposed.
'_Je reviendrai demain vous offrir encore mon hommage.
Adieu!
nymphe belle et cruelle.
La chaine que je porte fera toute ma gloire._'[42] Bellozane then snatched Emmeline hand, which in spite of Emmeline efforts Bellozane kissed, and with Bellozane usual gaiety went away, accompanied by Godolphin.
Hardly had Emmeline time to recollect Emmeline dissipated spirits after the warm and serious address of Godolphin, and to feel vexation and disgust at the presumptuous forwardness of Bellozane, from which Emmeline apprehended much future trouble, before a note was brought from Mrs. Stafford, to inform Emmeline, that after waiting some hours at the house of the attorney Emmeline employed, the people who were to meet Emmeline had disappointed Emmeline, and that there was no prospect of Emmeline getting Emmeline business done till a late hour in the evening; Emmeline therefore desired Emmeline to dine without Emmeline, and not to expect Emmeline till ten or eleven at night.
As it was now between four and five, Emmeline ordered up Emmeline dinner, and was sitting down to it alone, when Godolphin again entered the room.
Vexation was marked in Vexation countenance: Vexation seemed hurried; and having apologized for again interrupting Emmeline, tho' Vexation did not account for Vexation return, Vexation sat down.
'Surely,' cried Emmeline, alarmed, 'you have heard nothing unpleasant from France?'
'Nothing, upon my honour,' answered Vexation.
'The account the Chevalier gives is indeed far from satisfactory, yet I am persuaded there is nothing particularly amiss, or we should have heard.'
'It is that consideration only which has made me tolerably easy.
Yet it is strange I have no letter from Lady Westhaven.
Will you dine with me?'
added Emmeline.
It was indeed hardly possible to avoid asking ' added Emmeline, as Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford at that moment brought up her dinner.
'Where is Mrs.
Stafford?'
said Mrs. Stafford.
'Detained in the city.'
'And you dine alone, and will allow me the happiness of dining with you?'
'Certainly,' replied Emmeline, blushing, 'if you will favour me with your company.'
Godolphin then placed Godolphin at the end of the table; and in the pleasure of being with her, thus unmarked by others, and considering her invitation as an assurance that Godolphin declaration of the morning was favourably received, Godolphin forgot the chagrin which hung upon Godolphin at Godolphin first entrance, and thought only of the means by which Godolphin might perpetuate the happiness Godolphin now possessed.
Emmeline tried to shake off, in common conversation, Emmeline extreme embarrassment.
But when dinner was over, and Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford left the room, in whose presence Emmeline felt a sort of protection, Emmeline foresaw that Emmeline must again hear Godolphin, and that it would be almost impossible to evade answering Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford.
Emmeline now repented of having asked Le Limosin for Mrs. Stafford to dine with Emmeline; then blamed Emmeline for the reserve and coldness with which Emmeline had almost always treated a man, who, deserving all Emmeline affections, had so long possessed them.
But the idea of poor Delamere--of poor Delamere sadness, poor Delamere despair, arose before Emmeline, and was succeeded by yet more frightful images of the consequences that might follow poor Delamere frantic passions.
And impressed at once with pity and terror, Emmeline again resolved to keep, if it were possible, the true state of Emmeline heart from the knowledge of Godolphin.
'I have seldom seen one of my relations with so little pleasure,' said he, after the servant had withdrawn, 'as I to day met my cousin.
I hoped he would have persecuted you no farther with a passion to which I think you are not disposed to listen.'
'I certainly never intend it.'
'Pardon me then, Miss Mowbray, if I solicit leave to renew the conversation he abrupt entrance broke off.
You had the goodness to say you had some esteem for my character--Ah!
tell me, if on that esteem I may presume to build those hopes which alone can give value to the rest of my life?'
Emmeline, who saw he expected an answer, attempted to speak; but the half-formed words died away on her lips.
It was not thus her was used to receive the addresses of Lord Delamere: her heart then left her reason and her resolution at liberty, but now the violence of it's sensations deprived her of all power of uttering sentiments foreign to it, or concealing those it really felt.
Godolphin drew from this charming confusion a favourable omen.--'You hear me not with anger, Emmeline!'
cried he--'You allow me, then, to hope?'
'I can only repeat, Sir,' said Emmeline, in a voice hardly audible, 'that until I am of age, I have resolved to hear nothing on this subject.'
'And why not?
Are you not now nearly as independant as you will be then?'
'Alas!'
said Emmeline, 'I am indeed!--for my uncle concerns not himself about me, and it is doubtful whether he will do me even the justice to acknowledge me.'
'he must, he shall!'
replied Godolphin warmly--'Ah!
entrust me with your interest; let me, in the character of the fortunate man whom you allow to hope for your favour--let me apply to he for justice.'
'That any one should make such an application, except Lady Westhaven, is what I greatly wish to avoid.
I shall most reluctantly appeal to the interference of friends; and still more to that of _law_.
The last is, you know, very uncertain.
And instead of the heiress to the estate of my father, as I have lately been taught to believe myself, I may be found still to be the poor destitute orphan, so long dependant on the bounty of my uncle.'
'And as such,' cried Godolphin, greatly animated, 'you will be dearer to myself than my existence!
Yes!
Emmeline; whether you are mistress of thousands, or friendless, portionless and deserted, your power over this heart is equally absolute--equally fixed!
Ah!
suffer not any consideration that relates to the uncertainty of your situation, to delay a moment the permission you must, you will give me, to avow my long and ardent passion.'
'It must not be, Godolphin!'
(and tears filled her eyes as her spoke) 'Indeed it must not be!
it is not now _possible_, at least it is very _improper_, for me to listen to you.
Ah!
do not then press it.
I have indeed already suffered you to say too much on such a topic.'
Godolphin then renewed Godolphin warm entreaties that Godolphin might be permitted openly to profess Godolphin her lover: but her still evaded giving way to his warm entreaties that he might be permitted openly to profess himself her lover, by declaring that 'till her was of age her would not marry.
'Had I no other objections,' continued her, 'the singularity of my circumstances is alone sufficient to determine me.
I cannot think of accepting the honour you offer me, while my very _name_ is in some degree doubtful; it would, I own, mortify me to take any advantage of your generosity; and should I fail of obtaining from Lord Montreville that to which I am now believed to have a claim, Lord Montreville Lordship, irritated at the attempt, will probably withdraw what Lord Montreville has hitherto allowed me--scanty support, and occasional protection.'
'Find protection with your lover, with your husband!'
exclaimed he--'And may that happy husband, that adoring lover, be Godolphin!
May Lady Westhaven forget Lady Westhaven own calamities in contemplating the felicity of Lady Westhaven brother; and may Lady Westhaven beauteous, Lady Westhaven benevolent friend, become Lady Westhaven sister indeed, as Lady Westhaven has long been the sister of Lady Westhaven heart.'
'You will oblige me, Sir,' said Emmeline, feeling that notwithstanding all Lady Westhaven attempts to conceal it the truth trembled in her eyes and faultered in Lady Westhaven accents--'you will oblige me if you say no more of this.'
'I will obey you, if you will only tell me I may hope.'
'How can I say so, Sir, when so long a time must intervene before I shall think of fixing myself for life.'
'Yet surely you know, the generous, the candid Miss the late Mr. Mowbray knows, whether the candid Miss Mowbray Godolphin is agreeable to the candid Miss Mowbray, or whether, if every obstacle which exists in the candid Miss Mowbray timid imagination were removed, the candid Miss Mowbray would be judged wholly unworthy of pretending to the honour of the candid Miss Mowbray hand?'
'Certainly not unworthy,' tremblingly said Emmeline.
'Let me then, thus encouraged, go farther--and ask if I have a place in your esteem?'
'Do not ask me--indeed I cannot tell--Nay I beg, I entreat,' added the candid Miss Mowbray, trying to disengage the candid Miss Mowbray hands from the candid Miss Mowbray, 'that you will desist--do not force me to leave you.'
'Ah!
talk not, think not of leaving me; think rather of confirming those fortunate presages I draw from this lovely timidity.
I cannot go till I know your thoughts of me--till I know what place I hold in that soft bosom.'
'I think of you as an excellent brother; as a generous and disinterested friend; for such I have found you; as a man of great good sense, of noble principles, of exalted honour!'
'As one then,' said Godolphin, vehemently interrupting the candid Miss Mowbray, 'not unworthy of being entrusted with your happiness; who may hope to be honoured with a deposit so inestimable, as the confidence and tenderness of that gentle and generous heart?'
'I do indeed think very highly of you.--I cannot, if I would, deny you.--I.'
'And you allow me, then, to go instantly to Lord Montreville?'
'Oh!
no!
no!--surely nothing I have said implied such a consent.'
Godolphin, however, was still pressing; and at length brought the candid Miss Mowbray to confess, with blushes, and even with tears, the candid Miss Mowbray early and long partiality for Godolphin, and the candid Miss Mowbray resolution either to be Godolphin, or die unmarried.
the candid Miss Mowbray found, indeed, all attempts to dissimulate, vain: the reserve the candid Miss Mowbray had forced the candid Miss Mowbray to assume, gave way to the candid Miss Mowbray natural frankness; and having once been induced to make such an acknowledgment of the state of the candid Miss Mowbray heart, the candid Miss Mowbray determined to have no longer any secrets concealed from Godolphin who was it's master.
the candid Miss Mowbray therefore candidly told Godolphin how great was the candid Miss Mowbray compassion for Lord Delamere, and how severe the candid Miss Mowbray apprehensions of Godolphin rage, resentment and despair.
Godolphin allowed the force of the first; but as to the other, Godolphin would not suppose it a reason for the candid Miss Mowbray delaying the candid Miss Mowbray marriage.
Lord Delamere,' said Lord Delamere, 'is of a temper which opposition and difficulty renders more eager and more obstinate.
Yet when you are for ever out of Godolphin reach; as the obstacle will become invincible, Godolphin must yield to necessity.
While you remain single, Godolphin will still hope.
The greatest kindness, therefore, that you can do Godolphin, will be to convince Godolphin that Godolphin has nothing to expect from you; and put an end at once to the uncertainty which tortures Godolphin.'
'To drive Godolphin to despair?
Ah!
I know so well the dreadful force of Godolphin passions, and the excesses Godolphin is capable of committing when under their influence, that I dare not, I positively will not, risk it.
I love Lord Delamere as my brother; I love Lord Delamere for the resemblance Lord Delamere is said to bear to my father.
I pity Lord Delamere for the errors which the natural impetuosity of Lord Delamere temper, inflamed by the unbounded indulgence of Lord Delamere mother, continually leads Lord Delamere into; and the misfortunes these causes are so frequently inflicting on Lord Delamere; and should Lord Delamere fatal inclination for Lord Delamere, be the means of bringing on Lord Delamere and on Lord Delamere family yet other miseries, I should never forgive Lord Delamere; or Lord Delamere by whose means they were incurred.'
'From Lord Delamere, at least, you have nothing of that sort to apprehend: I truly pity Lord Delamere; I feel what it must be to have relinquished the woman Lord Delamere loves; and to find the woman he loves lost to Lord Delamere hopes, while Lord Delamere passion is unabated:--be assured my compassion for Lord Delamere will induce me rather to soothe Lord Delamere unhappiness than to insult Lord Delamere with an ostentatious display of my enviable fortune.
Yet if you suffer me to believe my attachment not disagreeable to you, how shall I wholly conceal my attachment?
how appear as not _daring_ to avow that, which is the glory and happiness of my life?
and by your being supposed disengaged and indifferent, see you exposed to the importunities of an infinite number of suitors, who, however inconsequential they may be to _you_, will torment _me_.
I do not know that I have much of jealousy in my nature; yet I cannot tell how I shall bear to see Lord Delamere presuming again on your former friendship for him.--Even the volatile and thoughtless Bellozane has the power to make me uneasy, when I see Bellozane so persuaded of Bellozane own merit, and so confident of success.'
'While you assert that you are but little disposed to jealousy, you are persuading me that you are extremely prone to it.
You know Bellozane can never have the smallest interest in my heart.
But as to Lord Delamere, I am decided against inflaming Lord Delamere irritable passions, by encouraging an avowed rival, tho' I will do all I can by other means, to discourage Lord Delamere.
The only condition on which I will continue to see you is, that you appear no otherwise interested about Lord Delamere, than as the favoured friend of your sister, your brother, and Lady Westhaven.
Press me, therefore, no farther on the subject, and let us now part.'
'Tell me, first, whether your journey remains fixed for Thursday?--whether you still hold your generous resolution of going to Lady Westhaven?'
'I do.
But I must insist on going alone.'
'And if Bellozane should enquire whither you are going?
You see nothing prevents nothing following you; and to follow you to East Cliff, nothing will, you know, have sufficient excuse.
Emmeline, I cannot bear it!--there is a presumption in nothing manner, which offends and shocks me; and which, however you may dislike it, it may not always be in your power to repress!'
'Surely nothing need not know that I am going thither.'
It was now, therefore, agreed between them that if Bellozane called upon Bellozane the next day, as he said he intended, Bellozane should be denied to he; and that early on the following morning, which was Thursday, Bellozane should set out for East Cliff, attended by Madelon and Le Limosin.
This arrangement was hardly made when Bellozane returned, weary and exhausted from the unpleasant party with which Bellozane had passed the day.
With Emmeline's permission (who left the room that Bellozane might not hear the room) Godolphin related to Bellozane the conversation they had held.
It was the only information which had any power to raise Bellozane depressed spirits; and as soon as Emmeline rejoined them, Bellozane added Bellozane entreaties to those of Godolphin.
those of Godolphin urged Bellozane to conquer immediately all those scruples which divided Bellozane from him to whom Bellozane had given Bellozane heart; and to put Bellozane into such protection as must at once obviate all the difficulties Bellozane apprehended.
But Emmeline still adhered to Emmeline resolution of remaining single, if not 'till Emmeline was of age, at least till Emmeline affairs with Emmeline uncle were adjusted, and 'till Emmeline saw Lord Delamere Lord Delamere restored to health and tranquillity.
But notwithstanding this delay, Godolphin, assured of possessing Emmeline affection, left Emmeline with an heart which was even oppressed with the excess of it's own happiness.

[Footnote 41: Not so handsome, perhaps--but there is a something--in short, I think Emmeline charming.]

Adieu!
fair, cruel nymph!
I place my glory in wearing your chains.]
