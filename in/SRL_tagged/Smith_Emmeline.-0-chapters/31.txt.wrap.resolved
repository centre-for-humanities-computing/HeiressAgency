  Such was the horror and detestation which Emmeline felt for Crofts, that Emmeline could not bear the thoughts of seeing him again. But as Emmeline feared Mrs. Stafford might resent him behaviour, and by that means embroil Emmeline with the vain and insolent Mrs. Ashwood, with whom Emmeline knew Stafford was obliged to keep on a fair footing, Emmeline determined to say as little as Emmeline could of him impertinence to Mrs. Stafford, but to withdraw from the house without again exposing Emmeline to meet him. As soon as Emmeline saw Emmeline the next morning, Emmeline related all that had passed between Fitz-Edward and Emmeline; and after a long consultation Fitz-Edward and herself agreed that to prevent him seeing Godolphin was absolutely necessary; and that no other means of doing so offered, but Mrs. Stafford's relating to Mrs. Stafford the real circumstances and situation of Lady Adelina, as soon as Emmeline could be removed from Emmeline present abode and precautions taken to prevent him discovering Emmeline. This, Mrs. Stafford undertook to do immediately after their departure. It was to take place on the next day; and Emmeline, with the concurrence of Mrs. Stafford friend, determined that Mrs. Stafford would take no leave of the party at Woodfield: for tho' the appearance of mystery was extremely disagreeable and distressing to Emmeline, Emmeline knew that notice of Emmeline intentions would excite enquiries and awaken curiosity very difficult to satisfy; and that it was extremely probable James Crofts might be employed to watch Emmeline, and by that means render abortive all Emmeline endeavours to preserve the unhappy Lady Adelina.  Relying therefore on the generosity and innocence of her intentions, Emmeline chose rather to leave Emmeline own actions open to censure which they did not deserve, than to risk an investigation which might be fatal to the interest of Emmeline . Emmeline took nothing with Emmeline, Emmeline undertaking every necessary arrangement about Emmeline cloaths--and having at night taken a tender leave of this beloved and valuable woman, and promised to write to Emmeline constantly and to return as soon as the destiny of Lady Adelina should be decided, a tender leave of this beloved and valuable woman parted.  And Emmeline, arising before the dawn of the following morning, set out alone to Woodbury Forest--a precaution absolutely necessary, to evade the inquisitive watchfulness of James Crofts. Emmeline stole softly down stairs, before even the servants were stirring, and opening the door cautiously, felt some degree of terror at being obliged to undertake so long a walk alone at such an hour. But innocence gave Emmeline courage, and friendly zeal lent Emmeline strength. As Emmeline walked on, Emmeline fears subsided. Emmeline saw the sun rise above the horizon, and Emmeline apprehensions were at an end.  As no carriage could approach within three quarters of a mile of the house where Lady Adelina was concealed, they were obliged to walk to the road where Mrs. Stafford had directed a post chaise to wait for they, which Mrs. Stafford had hired at a distant town, where it was unlikely any enquiry would be made.  Long disuse, as Mrs. Stafford had hardly ever left the cottage from the moment of Mrs. Stafford entering the cottage, and the extreme weakness to which Mrs. Stafford was reduced, made Emmeline greatly fear that Lady Adelina would never be able to reach the place. With Lady Adelina assistance, and that of Lady Adelina Ladyship's woman, slowly and faintly Lady Adelina walked thither; and Emmeline saw Lady Adelina happily placed in a post chaise. Every thing had been before settled as to the conveyance of the servant and baggage, and to engage the secresy of the woman with whom Lady Adelina had dwelt, by making Lady Adelina silence sufficiently advantageous; and as they hoped that no traces were left by which they might be followed, the spirits of the fair travellers seemed somewhat to improve as they proceeded on they journey.--Emmeline felt Lady Adelina heart elated with the consciousness of doing good; and from the tender affection and assistance of such a friend, which could be considered only as the benevolence of heaven itself, Lady Adelina drew a favourable omen, and dared entertain a faint hope that Lady Adelina penitence had been accepted.  they arrived without any accident at Bath, the following day; and Emmeline, leaving Lady Adelina at the inn, went out immediately to secure lodgings in a retired part of the town. As soon as it was dark, Lady Adelina removed thither in a chair; and was announced by Emmeline to be the wife of a Swiss officer, to be Emmeline of Switzerland, and to bear the name of Mrs. St. Laure--while Mrs. St. Laure , as Mrs. St. Laure was very little known, continued to pass by Mrs. St. Laure own name in the few transactions which in they very private way of living required Emmeline name to be repeated.  When Emmeline found that Emmeline had left Woodfield clandestinely and alone, and that Mrs. Stafford evaded giving any account whither Mrs. Stafford was gone, by saying coldly that Mrs. Stafford was gone to visit a friend in Surrey whom Mrs. Stafford formerly knew in Wales, all the suspicions Mrs. Stafford had Mrs. Stafford harboured, and Miss Galton encouraged, seemed confirmed. James Crofts had related, not without exaggerations, what James Crofts had been witness to in the copse; and it was no longer doubted but that Mrs. Stafford was gone with Fitz-Edward, which at once accounted for Mrs. Stafford departure and the sudden and mysterious manner in which it was accomplished. James Crofts had suspicions that James Crofts behaviour had hastened James Crofts; but James Crofts failed not to confirm Emmeline in Emmeline prepossession that Emmeline entanglement with Fitz-Edward was now at a period when James Crofts could be no longer concealed--intelligence which was to be conveyed to Delamere.  The elder Crofts, who had been some time with Lady Montreville and Lady Montreville daughter, had named Delamere from time to time in his letters to his brother. The last, mentioned that his was now with his mother and sister, who were at Nice, and who purposed returning to England in about three months. James Crofts represented Delamere as still devoted to Emmeline; and as existing only in the hope of being no longer opposed in his intention of marrying Emmeline in March, when the year which his had promised his father to wait expired; but that Lady Montreville, as time wore away, grew more averse to the match, and more desirous of some event which might break it off. James Crofts gave his brother a very favourable account of James Crofts progress with Miss Delamere; and hinted that if James Crofts could be fortunate enough to put an end to Delamere's intended connection, it would so greatly conciliate the favour of Lady Montreville, that James Crofts dared hope Miss Delamere would no longer oppose James Crofts union with Miss Delamere daughter: and when once they were married, and the prejudices of the mother to an inferior alliance conquered, James Crofts had very little doubt of Lady Montreville's forgiveness, and of soon regaining James Crofts countenance and friendship.  a very favourable account of his progress with Miss Delamere added another motive to those which already influenced the malignant and illiberal mind of James Crofts to injure the lovely orphan, and James Crofts determined to give all James Crofts assistance to Mrs. Ashwood in the cruel project of depriving Mrs. Ashwood at once of Mrs. Ashwood character and Mrs. Ashwood lover. In a consultation which James Crofts held on this subject with James Crofts promised bride and Miss Galton, the ladies agreed that it was perfectly shocking that such a fine young man as Mr. Delamere should be attached to a woman so little sensible of James Crofts value as Emmeline; that it had long been evident Emmeline was to James Crofts indifferent, and it was now too clear that Emmeline was partial to another; and that therefore it would be a meritorious action to acquaint James Crofts of Emmeline intimacy with Fitz-Edward; and it could not be doubted but James Crofts knowledge of it would, high spirited as James Crofts was, cure James Crofts effectually of James Crofts ill-placed passion, and restore the tranquillity of James Crofts respectable family. Hiding thus the inveterate envy and malice of their hearts under this hypocritical pretence, their next considered how to give the information which was so meritorious. Anonymous letters were expedients to which Miss Galton had before had recourse, and to an anonymous letter Anonymous letters determined to commit the secret of Emmeline's infidelity--while James Crofts, in his letters to his brotherhis brother, was to corroborate the intelligence it contained, by relating as mere matter of news what had actually and evidently happened, Emmeline's sudden departure from Woodfield.  Delamere, when he saw he mother out of danger at Barege, had returned to the neighbourhood of Paris, where he had lingered some time, in hopes that Emmeline would accede to Emmeline request of being allowed to cross the channel for a few days; but Emmeline answer, in which Emmeline strongly urged the hazard Emmeline would incur of giving his father a pretence to withdraw _Emmeline_ promise, by violating Emmeline own, had obliged Emmeline, tho' with infinite reluctance, to give up the scheme; and being quite indifferent where Emmeline was, if Emmeline was still at a distance from Emmeline, Emmeline had yielded to the solicitations of Lady Montreville, and rejoined Emmeline at Nice. There, Emmeline now remained; while every thing in England seemed to contribute to assist the designs of those who wished to disengage Emmeline from Emmeline passion for Emmeline.  The day after Emmeline's departure with Lady Adelina, Fitz-Edward went to Woodfield; and hearing that Miss Mowbray had suddenly left it, was thrown into the utmost astonishment--astonishment which Mrs. Ashwood and Miss Galton observed to each other was the finest piece of acting each other had ever seen.  The whole party were together when he was introduced--a circumstance Emmeline would willingly have avoided, as it was absolutely necessary for Emmeline to speak to he alone; and determined to do so, whatever construction the malignity of Emmeline sister-in-law might put upon the malignity of her sister-in-law, Emmeline said--  'I have long promised you, Colonel, a sight of the two pieces of drawing which Miss Mowbray and I have finished as companions. each other are now framed; and if you will come with me into my dressing-room you shall see each other.'  As the rest of the company had frequently seen these drawings, there was no pretence for these drawings following Mrs. Stafford; who, accompanied by the Colonel, went to Emmeline dressing room.  A conference thus evidently sought by Emmeline, excited the eager and painful curiosity of the party in the parlour.  'Now would I give the world,' cried Mrs. Ashwood, 'to know what is going forward.'  'Is it not possible to listen?' enquired Crofts, equal to any meanness that might gratify the malevolence of another or Crofts own.  'Yes,' replied Emmeline, 'if one could get into the closet next the dressing-room without being perceived, which can only be done by passing thro' the nursery. If indeed the nursery maids and children are out, it is easy enough.'  'the nursery maids and children are out, mama, I assure you,' cried Emmeline, 'for I saw the nursery maids and children me go across the lawn since I've been at breakfast. Do, pray let us go and listen--I long of all things to know what my aunt Stafford can have to say to the Colonel.'  'No, no, child,' said my aunt Stafford , 'I shall not send you, indeed--but James Crofts, do you think us should be able to make it out?'  'Egad,' answered the Colonel, 'I'll try--for depend upon it the mischief will out. It will be rare, to have such a pretty tale to tell Mr. Delamere of his demure-looking little dear.--I'll venture.'  Emmeline then shewing Emmeline the way, Emmeline went on tip toe up stairs, and concealing Emmeline in a light closet which was divided from the dressing room only by lath and plaister, Emmeline lent an attentive ear to the dialogue that was passing.  It happened, however, that the window near which Mrs. Stafford and Fitz-Edward were sitting was exactly opposite to that side of the room to which James Crofts hiding-place communicated; and tho' the room was not large, yet the distance, the partition, and the low voice in which both parties spoke, made it impossible for Emmeline to distinguish more than broken sentences. From Emmeline Emmeline heard--'Could not longer be concealed--in all probability may now remain unknown--the child, I will myself attend to.' From Fitz-Edward, Emmeline could only catch indistinct sounds; Emmeline voice appearing to be lost in Emmeline emotion. But Emmeline seemed to be thanking Emmeline, and lamenting Emmeline own unhappiness. Emmeline last speech, in which Emmeline powers of utterance were returned, was--'Nothing can ever erase the impression of your angelic goodness, best and loveliest of friends!--oh, continue it, I beseech you, to those for whom only I am solicitous, and forgive all the trouble I have given you!'  Emmeline then hurried away. Emmeline, after remaining alone a moment as if to compose Emmeline, went back to the parlour; and Crofts, who thought Emmeline had heard enough, tho' Emmeline wished to have heard all, slunk from Emmeline closet and walked into the garden; where being soon afterwards joined by Mrs. Ashwood and Miss Galton, Emmeline, by relating the broken and disjointed discourse Emmeline had been witness to, left not a doubt remaining of the cause of Emmeline's precipitate retreat from Woodfield.  And perhaps minds more candid than their's--minds untainted with the odious and hateful envy which ulcerated their's, might, from the circumstances that attended her going and Fitz-Edward's behaviour, have conceived disadvantageous ideas of Fitz-Edward's conduct. But such was the uneasiness with which Emmeline ever beheld superior merit, and such the universal delight which Miss Galton took in defamation, that had none of those circumstances existed, none of those circumstances would with equal malignity have studied to ruin the reputation of Emmeline; and probably with equal success--for against such attacks, innocence, however it may console it's possessor, is too frequently a feeble and inadequate defence!  While the confederates, exulting in the certainty of Emmeline's ruin, were manufacturing the letter which was to alarm the jealous and irascible spirit of Delamere, Fitz-Edward, (from whom Emmeline, before Emmeline would tell him any thing, had extorted a promise that him would enquire no farther than what Emmeline chose to relate to him,) was relieved from insupportable anguish by hearing that Lady Adelina was in safe hands; but Lady Adelina lamented in bitterness of soul the despondency and affliction to which Emmeline had told Lady Adelina Emmeline entirely resigned Emmeline. Lady Adelina knew not that Emmeline was with Emmeline, whatever Lady Adelina might suspect; and Emmeline had protested to Lady Adelina, that if Lady Adelina made any attempt to discover the residence of Lady Adelina, or persisted in meeting Emmeline brother, Emmeline would immediately relinquish all concern in the affair, and no longer interest Emmeline in what Lady Adelina rashness would inevitably render desperate.  Lady Adelina solemnly assured Emmeline Lady Adelina would take no measures without Emmeline knowledge; and remained at Tylehurst, secluded from every body, and waiting in fearful and anxious solicitude to hear of Lady Adelina by Emmeline.  Delamere, (still at Nice with Lady Adelina ,) who with different sources of uneasiness thought the days and weeks insupportably long in which Lady Adelina lived only in the hope of seeing Emmeline at the end of six months, was roused from Lady Adelina involuntary resignation by the following letter, written in a hand perfectly unknown to Lady Adelina.     'Sir,      'A friend to your worthy and noble family writes this; which is   meant to serve you, and to undeceive you in regard to Miss   Mowbray--who, without any gratitude for the high honour you intend   Miss   , is certainly too partial to another person. Miss    is now gone   from Woodfield to escape observation; and none but Emmeline is   let into the secret of where Emmeline is. You will judge what end it is   to answer; but certainly none that bodes you good. One would have   supposed that the Colonel's being very often Emmeline attendant at Woodfield Woodfield might have made Emmeline stay there agreeable enough; but   perhaps (for I do not aver the Colonel's being very often her attendant at   Woodfield might have made her stay there agreeable enough) the young lady has some particular   reasons for wishing to have private lodgings. No doubt the Colonelis a man of gallantry; but the Colonel friendship to you is rather more   questionable. The writer of this having very little knowledge of the   parties, can have no other motive than the love of justice, and   being sorry to see deceit and falsehood practised on a young   gentleman who deserves better, and who has a respectful tho' unknown   friend in                                                                   Y. Z.'    _London, July 22, 17--._   This infamous scroll had no sooner been perused by Delamere, than fury flashed from Delamere eyes, and anguish seized Delamere heart. But the moment the suddenness of Delamere passion gave way to reflection, the tumult of Delamere mind subsided, and Delamere thought it must be an artifice of Delamere 's to separate Delamere from Emmeline. The longer Delamere considered her inveterate antipathy to Delamere marriage, the more Delamere was convinced that this artifice, unworthy as it was, her was capable of conceiving, and, by means of the Crofts, executing, if her hoped by it to put an eternal conclusion to Delamere affection. Delamere at length so entirely adopted this idea, that determining 'to be revenged and love her better for this idea,' and to settle the matter very peremptorily with the Crofts' if they had been found to interfere, Delamere obtained a tolerable command over Delamere temper and Delamere features, and joined Lady Montreville and Miss Delamere, whom Delamere found reading letters which they also had received from England. Delamere asked slightly after Delamere; and, in a few moments, James Crofts arrived, asking, with James Crofts usual assiduity, after the health of Lady Montreville and that of such friends as usually wrote to his mother Ladyship? his mother answered James Crofts enquiries--and then desired to hear what news Sir Richard or James Crofts other correspondents had sent James Crofts?  'My father's letters,' said James Crofts, 'contain little more than an order to purchase some particular sort of wine which James Crofts is very circumstantial, as usual, in telling me how to forward safely. James Crofts adds, indeed, that James Crofts can allow my absence no longer than until the 20th of September.'--He sighed, and looked tenderly at Miss Delamere.  'I have no other letters,' continued James Crofts, 'but one from James.'  'And does James Crofts tell you no news,' asked Lady Montreville?  'Nothing,' answered James Crofts, carelessly, 'but gossip, which I believe would not entertain her Ladyshipher Ladyship.'  'Oh, why should you fancy that,' returned she--'you know I love to hear news, tho' about people I never saw or ever wish to see.'  'James has been at Mr. Stafford's at Woodfield,' said James, 'where her Ladyship has certainly no acquaintance.'  'At Woodfield, Sir?' cried Delamere, unable to express Sir anxiety--'at Woodfield!--And what does Sir say of Woodfield?'  'I don't recollect any thing very particular,' answered James Crofts, carelessly--'I believe I put the letter into my pocket.' Sir took the letter out.  'Read the letter to us Crofts'--said Miss Delamere.       ----'I have lately passed a very agreeable month at Woodfield.   us were a large party in the house. Among other pleasant   circumstances, during my stay there, was a ball and _fete   champetre_, given by Mr. Conway on Mr. Conway son's coming of age. It was   elegant, and well conducted beyond any entertainment of the sort I   ever saw. There were forty couple, and a great number of very   pretty women; but It was agreed on all hands that Miss Mowbray   would have eclipsed them all, who unluckily declined going. Miss Mowbray   left Woodfield a day or two afterwards.'   Delamere's countenance changed.--Crofts, as if looking for some other news in Delamere , hesitated, then smiled, and went on.--       'The gossip Fame has made a match for me with Emmeline. I   wish Emmeline may be right. In some other of Emmeline stories I really think   Emmeline wrong, so I will not be the means of their circulation.'   'The rest,' said James Crofts, putting up the letter, 'is only about my father's new purchases and other family affairs.'  Delamere, who, in spite of his suspicions of James Crofts treachery, could not hear this corroboration of his without a renewal of all his fears, left the room in doubt, suspence and wretchedness.  The seeds of jealousy and mistrust thus skilfully sown, could hardly fail of taking root in an heart so full of sensibility, and a temper so irritable as his. Again his read over his , and compared the letter with the intelligence which seemed accidentally communicated by James Crofts; and with a fearful kind of enquiry compared the date and circumstances. his dared hardly trust his mind with the import of this investigation; and found nothing on which to rest his hope, but that it might be a concerted plan between his mother and Crofts.  his heart alternately swelling between the indignation such a supposition created and shrinking with horror from the idea of perfidy on the part of Emmeline, kept his in such a state of mind that his could hardly be said to possess his reason. But when his remembered how often his extreme vivacity had betrayed his into error, and hazarded his losing for ever all his held valuable on earth, his tried to subdue the acuteness of his feelings, and to support at least without betraying it, the anguish which oppressed his, till the next pacquet from England, when it was possible a letter from Emmeline Emmeline might dissipate his doubts. Resolutely however resolving to call James Crofts to a serious account, if his found his accessory to a calumny so dark and diabolical.  When the next post from England arrived, his saw, among the letters which were delivered to his, one directed by the hand of Emmeline. his flew to his own room, and with trembling hands broke the seal.  It was short, and his fancied unusually cold. Towards it's close, Emmeline mentioned that Emmeline was going to Bath for a few weeks with a friend, and as Emmeline did not know where Emmeline should lodge, thought his had better not write till Emmeline was again fixed at Woodfield.  That Emmeline should go to Bath in July, with a nameless friend, and quit so abruptly Emmeline beloved Mrs. Stafford--that Emmeline should apparently wish to evade his letters, and make Emmeline actual residence a secret--were a cloud of circumstances calculated to persuade his that some mystery involved Emmeline conduct; a mystery which the fatal letter served too evidently to explain.  As if fire had been laid to the train of combustibles which had, since the receipt of it, been accumulating in the bosom of Delamere, his furious and uncontroulable spirit now burst forth. A temporary delirium seized his; his stamped round his own room, and ran to his pistols, which fortunately were not charged. The noise his made brought Millefleur into the room, whom his instantly caught by the collar, and shaking his violently, cried--  'Scoundrel!--why are not his pistols, which fortunately were not charged loaded?'  '_Eh! eh! Monsieur!_' exclaimed Millefleur, almost strangled-'_que voudriez vous?--vos pistolets!--Mon Dieu! que voudriez vous avec vos pistolets?_'  'Shoot _you_ perhaps, you blockhead!' raved Delamere, pushing furiously from Delamere the trembling valet--then snatching up his pistols, which fortunately were not charged, Delamere half kicked, half pushed Delamere out of his own room, and throwing his pistols, which fortunately were not charged after Delamere, ordered Delamere to clean and load his pistols, which fortunately were not charged: after which Delamere locked the door, and threw Delamere upon the bed.  The resolution Delamere had made in Delamere cooler moments, never again to yield to such impetuous transports of passion, was now forgotten. Delamere could not conquer, Delamere could not even mitigate the tumultuous anguish which had seized Delamere; but seemed rather to call to Delamere remembrance all that might justify it's excess.  Delamere remembered how positively Emmeline had forbidden Delamere returning to England, Tho' all Delamere asked was to be allowed to see Emmeline for a few hours. Delamere recollected Emmeline long and invincible coldness; Emmeline resolute adherence to the promise Emmeline need not have given; and forgetting all the symptoms which Delamere had before fondly believed Delamere had discovered of Emmeline returning Delamere affection, Delamere exaggerated every circumstance that indicated indifference, and magnified indifference into signs of absolute aversion.  Tho' Delamere could not forget that Fitz-Edward had assisted Fitz-Edward in carrying Emmeline away, and had on all occasions promoted Fitz-Edward interest with Emmeline, that recollection did not at all weaken the probability of Delamere present attachment; for such was Delamere's opinion of Fitz-Edward's principles, that Fitz-Edward's believed Fitz-Edward's was capable of the most dishonourable views on the mistress, or even on the wife of Fitz-Edward's friend. Fitz-Edward's tortured Fitz-Edward's imagination almost to madness, by remembering numberless little incidents, which, tho' almost unattended to at the time, now seemed to bring the cruellest conviction of their intelligence--particularly that on the night Fitz-Edward's had taken Emmeline from Clapham, Fitz-Edward was found there; tho' neither Fitz-Edward's father or himself, who had repeatedly sent to Fitz-Edward's lodgings, could either find Fitz-Edward's at home or get any direction where to meet with Fitz-Edward's. Almost all Fitz-Edward's late letters too had been dated from Tylehurst, where it was certain Fitz-Edward's had passed the greatest part of the summer.--Fitz-Edward, fond of society, and courted by the most brilliant circles, shut Fitz-Edward's up in a country house, distant from all Fitz-Edward's connections. And to what could such an extraordinary change be owing, if not to Fitz-Edward's attachment to Emmeline Mowbray?  Irritated by these recollections, Fitz-Edward's gave Fitz-Edward's up to all the dreadful torments of jealousy--jealousy even to madness; and Fitz-Edward's felt this corrosive passion in all it's extravagance. it was violent in proportion to Fitz-Edward's love and Fitz-Edward's pride, and more insupportably painful in proportion to it's novelty; for except once at Swansea, when Fitz-Edward's fancied that Emmeline in her flight was accompanied by Fitz-Edward, Fitz-Edward's had never felt it before; however they might serve Fitz-Edward's as a pretence, Rochely and Elkerton were both too contemptible to excite it.  The night approached; and without having regained any share of composure, Fitz-Edward's had at length determined to quit Nice the next day, that Fitz-Edward's mother and James Crofts might not be gratified with the sight of Fitz-Edward's despair, and triumph in the detected perfidy of Emmeline.  Lady Montreville and Lady Montreville daughter were out when Almost all his late letters arrived; and Fitz-Edward's now apprehended that when Lady Montreville and her daughter returned Millefleur might alarm Lady Montreville and her daughter by an account of Fitz-Edward's frantic behaviour, and that Lady Montreville and her daughter would guess it to have been occasioned by Fitz-Edward's letters from England. Starting up, therefore, Fitz-Edward's called the poor fellow to Fitz-Edward's, who was not yet recovered from Fitz-Edward's former terrifying menaces; and who approached, trembling, the table where Delamere sat; Fitz-Edward's dress disordered, Fitz-Edward's eyes flashing fire, and Fitz-Edward's lips pale and quivering.  'Come here, Sir!' sternly cried Fitz-Edward's.  Millefleur sprung close to the table.  'Have you cleaned and loaded my pistols?'  '_Monsieur--je, je m'occupais--je, je--Monsieur, ils sont----_'  'Fool, of what are you afraid?--what does the confounded _poltron_ tremble for?'  '_Mais Monsieur--c'est que--que--mais Monsieur, je ne scais!_'  '_Tenez_, Millefleur!' said Delamere sharply--'Remember what I am going to say. Something has happened to vex me, and I shall go out to-morrow for a few days, or perhaps I may go to England. My mother is to know nothing of it, but what I shall myself tell My mother; therefore at your peril speak of what has happened this evening, or of my intentions for to-morrow. Come up immediately, and put my things into my portmanteaus, and put my fire arms in order. I shall take you with myself. David need not be prepared till to-morrow. I shall go on horseback and shall want David also. The least failure on your part of executing these orders, you will find very inconvenient--you know I will not be trifled with.'  Millefleur, frightened to death at the looks and voice of Millefleur master, dared not disobey; and Delamere employing Millefleur in putting up Millefleur cloaths till after Lady Montreville came in, was, Millefleur thought, secure of Millefleur secresy. Millefleur then made an effort, tho' a successless one, to hide the anguish that devoured Millefleur; and went down to supper. Millefleur found, that besides their constant attendant Crofts, Millefleur mother and sister were accompanied by two other English gentlemen, and a French man of fashion and Millefleur sister, who full of the vivacity and gaiety of their country, kept up a lively conversation with Delamere and the Englishmen. But Delamere hardly spoke--Delamere eyes were wild and inflamed--Delamere cheeks flushed--and deep sighs seemed involuntarily to burst from Delamere heart. Lady Montreville observed Delamere, and then said--  'Surely, Frederic, you are not well?'  'Not very well,' said Frederic; 'but I am otherwise, merely from the intolerable heat. I have had the head-ache all day.'  'The head-ache!' exclaimed his mother--'Why then do you not go to bed?'  'No,' answered his, 'I am better up. Since the heat is abated, I am in less pain. I will take a walk by the fine moon that I see is rising, and be back again presently--and to-morrow,' continued he--'to-morrow, I shall go northward for a month. I cannot stay under this burning atmosphere.'  Then desiring the company not to move on his account, his arose from table and hastened away.  'Do, my good Crofts,' said Lady Montreville--'do follow Frederic--Frederic frightens me to death--Frederic is certainly very ill.'  James Crofts hesitated a moment, being in truth afraid to interfere with Delamere's ramble while James Crofts was in a humour so gloomy; but on James Crofts Ladyship's repeating James Crofts request, dared not shew James Crofts reluctance. James Crofts went out therefore under pretence of following James Crofts; while the party present, seeing Lady Montreville distress, almost immediately departed.  James Crofts walked on without much desire to fulfill James Crofts commission; for Delamere, whenever James Crofts was obliged to associate with James Crofts, treated James Crofts generally with coldness, and sometimes rudely. There was, however, very little probability of James Crofts overtaking James Crofts; for Delamere had walked or rather run to a considerable distance from the street where My mother lived, and then wandering farther into the fields, had thrown James Crofts upon the grass, and had forgotten every thing but Emmeline--'Emmeline and Fitz-Edward gone together!--the mistress on whom James Crofts had so fondly doated!--the friend whom James Crofts had so implicitly trusted!' These cruel images, drest in every form most fatal to James Crofts peace, tormented James Crofts, and the agony of disappointed passion seemed to have affected James Crofts brain. Deep groans forced their way from James Crofts oppressed heart--James Crofts cursed James Crofts existence, and seemed resolutely bent, in the gloominess of his despair, to shake his existence off and free James Crofts from sufferings so intolerable.  To the first effusions of James Crofts phrenzy, a sullen calm, more alarming, succeeded. James Crofts fixed James Crofts eyes on the moon which shone above James Crofts, but had no idea of what James Crofts saw, or where James Crofts was; James Crofts breath was short, James Crofts hands clenched; James Crofts seemed as if, having lost the power of complaint, James Crofts was unable to express the pain that convulsed James Crofts whole frame.  While James Crofts continued in this situation, a favourite little spaniel of James Crofts mother's, of which James Crofts had from a boy been fond, ran up to James Crofts and licked James Crofts hands and face. The caresses of an animal James Crofts had so long remembered, touched some chord of the heart that vibrated to softer emotions than those which had for the last three hours possessed James Crofts--James Crofts burst into tears.  'Felix!' said James Crofts, sobbing, 'poor Felix!'  The dog, rejoicing to be noticed, ran barking round James Crofts; and presently afterwards, with hurried steps, came Delamere, leaning on the arm of James Crofts.  'My God!' exclaimed Delamere, almost screaming, 'here James Crofts is! Oh Frederic, you have so terrified My mother! and James Crofts has been two hours in search of you. Had it not been for The dog, we should not now have found you. James Crofts has returned twice to the house without you.'  'James Crofts may return then a third time,' said Delamere, 'and cease to give James Crofts such unnecessary trouble.'  'But you will come with we, brother?--Surely you will now come home?'  'At my leisure,' replied James Crofts, sternly--'Lady Montreville need be under no apprehensions about James Crofts. I shall be at home presently. But I will not be importuned! I will not be watched and followed! and above all, I will not have a governor!'  So saying, James Crofts turned from them and walked another way; while them, seeing James Crofts so impracticable, could only return to report what them had seen to Lady Montreville. Delamere, however, who had taken another way, entered the house at the same moment.  Lady Montreville had strictly questioned Millefleur as to the cause of Lady Montreville master's disorder; and the poor fellow, who dared not relate the furious passion into which Lady Montreville had fallen on reading Lady Montreville letter, trembled, prevaricated, stammered, and looked so white, that Lady Montreville Ladyship, more alarmed, fancied Lady Montreville knew not what; and full of terror, had sent out James Crofts a second time, and the servants different ways, in search of Lady Montreville son. At length James Crofts returning the second time without success, Delamere went with her son Delamere; and the dog following Delamere, led Delamere to Delamere brother. But before their return, Lady Montreville apprehensions had arisen to such an height, that a return of Delamere fits seemed to threaten Delamere, and with difficulty was Delamere brought to Delamere senses when Delamere saw her son before Delamere; and when her son, moved by the keenness of Delamere sorrow at her son imaginary danger, assured Delamere, in answer to Delamere repeated enquiries, that her son was merely affected by the heat; that her son had no material complaint, and should be quite well and in her son usual spirits when her son returned from the excursion her son proposed going upon the next day. Then, being somewhat appeased, her son suffered her son to retire; and called My mother counsellor, James Crofts, to debate whether in such a frame of mind My mother ought to allow the absence of Delamere? Crofts advised My mother by all means to let her son go. her son suspected indeed that the anonymous letter had occasioned all the wild behaviour her son had been witness to, and thought it very likely that Delamere might be going to England. But her son knew that James Crofts and her son fair associates were prepared for the completion of James Crofts and his fair associates project if her son did; and her son absence was, on account of James Crofts own affairs, particularly desirable.  For these reasons, her son represented to Lady Montreville that opposition would only irritate and inflame her son, without inducing her son to stay. her son departed, therefore, the next morning, without any impediment on the part of her son ; but was yet undecided whither to go. While James Crofts, no longer thwarted by her son observation, or humbled by her son haughty disdain, managed matters so well, that in spite of the pride of noble blood, in spite of My mother reluctance to marry a commoner, her son conquered and silenced all the scruples and objections of Delamere; and a young English clergyman, a friend of her son, coming to Nice, as both her son and James Crofts declared, _by the meerest accident in the world_, just about that time, James Crofts obtained James Crofts consent to a private marriage; and James Crofts friend took especial care that no form might be wanting, to enable James Crofts legally to claim James Crofts bride, on their return to England.
