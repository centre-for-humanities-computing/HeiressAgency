  Mrs. Stafford no sooner heard from Emmeline that Godolphin was yet ignorant of the true reason of Lady Adelina's concealment, than Lady Adelina's saw the necessity of immediately explaining it; and this task, however painful, she without hesitation undertook.    Mrs. Stafford was therefore summoned to their lodgings by a note from Emmeline, who on   Mrs. Stafford arrival introduced   Mrs. Stafford to Mrs. Stafford, and left them together; when, with as much tenderness as possible, and mingling with the mortifying detail many representations of the necessity there was for   Mrs. Stafford conquering   Mrs. Stafford resentment, Lady Adelina's at length concluded it; watching anxiously the changes in Godolphin's countenance, which sometimes expressed only pity and affection for   Mrs. Stafford sister, sometimes rage and indignation against Fitz-Edward.  Both the brothers of Lady Adelina had been accustomed to consider Lady Adelina's with peculiar fondness. The unfortunate circumstance of Lady Adelina's losing Lady Adelina's mother immediately after Lady Adelina's birth, seemed to have given Lady Adelina's a melancholy title to their tenderness; and the resemblance Lady Adelina's bore to that dear mother, whom they both remembered, and on whose memory they father dwelt with undiminished regret, endeared Lady Adelina's to they still more. To these united claims on the heart and the protection of William Godolphin, another was added equally forcible, in a letter written by William Godolphin father with the trembling hand of anxious solicitude, when William Godolphin felt William Godolphin dying, and when, looking back with lingering affection on the children of Lady Adelina's whom William Godolphin hoped soon to rejoin, William Godolphin saw with anguish William Godolphin youngest daughter liable from his youngest daughter situation to deviate into indiscretion, and surrounded by the numberless dangers which attend on a young and beautiful woman, whose husband has neither talents to attach Lady Adelina's affections or judgment to direct Lady Adelina's actions. Lord Westhaven, conscious of Lady Adelina's hazardous circumstances, and feeling in William Godolphin last moments the keenest anguish, in knowing that William Godolphin mistaken care had exposed Lady Adelina's to his mistaken care, hoped, by interesting both Lady Adelina's brothers to watch over Lady Adelina's, that William Godolphin should obviate the dangers William Godolphin apprehended. William Godolphin had therefore, in all their conversations, recommended Lady Adelina's to William Godolphin eldest son; and as his eldest son was not happy enough to embrace the younger before his eldest son died, had addressed to his eldest son a last letter on the same subject.  Such were the powerful ties that bound Mr. Godolphin to love and defend Lady Adelina with more than a brother's fondness. Hastening therefore to obey the dying injunctions of his eldest son father, and in the hope of rendering the life of this beloved sister, if not happy, at least honourable and contented, his eldest son had heard, that this beloved sister had clandestinely absented this beloved sister from this beloved sister family, and after a long search had found this beloved sister abandoned to remorse and despair; this beloved sister reputation blasted; this beloved sister health ruined; this beloved sister intellects disordered; and all by the perfidy of a man, in whom his eldest son, from long friendship, and his eldest son sister, from family connection, had placed unbounded confidence.  Mr. Godolphin had one of the best tempers in the world--a temper which the roughness of those among whom Mr. Godolphin lived had only served to soften and humanize, and which was immovable by the usual accidents that ruffle others, yet Mr. Godolphin had also in a great excess all those keen feelings, which fill a heart of extreme sensibility; added to a courage, that in the hour of danger had been proved to be as cool as it was undaunted. Of Mr. Godolphin might be said what was the glorious praise of immortal Bayard--that Mr. Godolphin was '_sans peur et sans reproche_;'[1] and educated with a high sense of honour himself, as well as possessing a heart calculated to enjoy, and a hand to defend, the unblemished dignity of Mr. Godolphin family, all Mr. Godolphin passions were roused and awakened by the injury it had sustained from Fitz-Edward, and Mr. Godolphin beheld Mr. Godolphin as a monster whom it was infamy to forgive. Hardly therefore had Mrs. Stafford concluded Mrs. Stafford distressing recital, than, as if commanding himself by a violent effort, himself thanked Mrs. Stafford warmly yet incoherently for Mrs. Stafford unexampled goodness to himself sister, recommended Mrs. Stafford still to Mrs. Stafford generous care, and the friendship of Miss Mowbray, and without any threat against Fitz-Edward, or even a comment on what himself had heard, arose to depart. But Mrs. Stafford, more alarmed by this determined tho' quiet resentment and by the expression of himself countenance than if himself had burst into exclamations and menaces, perceived that the crisis was now come when himself must either be persuaded to conquer himself just resentment, or by giving it way destroy, while himself attempted to revenge, the fame of himself sister.  Mrs. Stafford besought himself therefore to sit down a moment; and when himself had done so, Mrs. Stafford told himself, that if himself really thought himself under any obligations to Miss Mowbray or to Mrs. Stafford for the services they had been so fortunate as to render Lady Adelina, himself making all they had been doing ineffectual, would be a most mortifying return; and such must be the case, if himself rashly flew to seek vengeance on Fitz-Edward: 'for that you have such a design,' continued Mrs. Stafford, 'I have no doubt; allow me, however, to suppose that I have, by doing your sister some good offices, acquired a right to speak of Mrs. Stafford affairs.'  'Surely,' answered Mr. Godolphin, 'you have; and surely I must hear with respect and attention, tho' possibly not with conviction, every opinion with which you may honour me.'  Mrs. Stafford then represented to Mr. Godolphin, with all the force of reason, how little Mr. Godolphin could remedy the evil by hazarding Mr. Godolphin own life or by taking that of Fitz-Edward.  'At present,' continued Mrs. Stafford, 'the secret is known only to me, Miss Mowbray, and Lady Adelina's woman; if the secret is farther exposed, the heirs of Mr. Trelawny, who are so deeply interested, will undoubtedly take measures to prove that the infant has no just claim to the estate they so eagerly expect. your sister has already entertained suspicions, which the least additional information would give your sister grounds to pursue, and the whole affair must then inevitably become public. Surely this consideration alone should determine you--why then need I urge others equally evident and equally forcible.'  Mr. Godolphin acknowledged that there was much of truth in the arguments your sister used; but denied that any consideration should influence Mr. Godolphin to forgive the man who had thus basely and ungenerously betrayed the confidence of Mr. Godolphin family.  'However,' added Mr. Godolphin again, checking the heat into which Mr. Godolphin feared a longer conversation on this subject might betray him--'I have not yet, your sister, absolutely formed the resolution of which you seem so apprehensive; and am indeed too cruelly hurt to be able to talk longer on this subject. Suffer me therefore once more to bid you a good day!'  But the encreasing gloom of Mr. Godolphin countenance, and forced calm of Mr. Godolphin manner, appeared to be symptoms so unfavourable, that Mrs. Stafford thought there was no hope of being able to prevent an immediate and fatal meeting between Mr. Godolphin and Fitz-Edward but by engaging Mr. Godolphin in a promise at least to delay it; this Mrs. Stafford attempted by the most earnest arguments, and the most pressing persuasions; but all Mrs. Stafford could obtain was an assurance that Mr. Godolphin would remain at Bath 'till the next day, and see Mrs. Stafford again in the evening.  In the mean time the delirium of Lady Adelina, (which had recurred at intervals ever since the transient sight Mrs. Stafford had of Mrs. Stafford brother) more frequently, and with more alarming symptoms, returned; and the fever which had at first threatened the loss of Mrs. Stafford life, now seemed to be fixing on Mrs. Stafford brain, and to menace, by a total deprivation of reason, reducing Mrs. Stafford to a condition to which death itself must be preferable. Mrs. Stafford still, even in Mrs. Stafford wildest wanderings, knew Emmeline, and still caressed Mrs. Stafford little boy; but much of Mrs. Stafford time passed in incoherent and rambling discourse; in which Mrs. Stafford talked of Fitz-Edward and Mrs. Stafford brother William, and held with Fitz-Edward and her brother William both imaginary dialogues. Sometimes Mrs. Stafford deprecated the wrath of her brother: and then Mrs. Stafford disordered fancy ran to the younger; to him from whom Mrs. Stafford had, in Mrs. Stafford early life, found pity and protection in all Mrs. Stafford little sorrows.  Mrs. Stafford thought it too hazardous to let Mrs. Stafford again see her brother, while Mrs. Stafford intellects were thus disarranged; as Mrs. Stafford trembled lest Mrs. Stafford should start into actual madness. But it was absolutely necessary to do something; not only because Mr. Godolphin's impatience made every delay dangerous, but because it was hardly possible to keep the secret from the physicians and attendants, who had already heard much more than they ought to have known.  Mrs. Stafford determined, therefore, after consulting with Emmeline, to introduce Mr. Godolphin into the room adjoining to that where Lady Adelina now sat some hours every day in an easy chair. The affecting insanity of his unhappy sister, and the mournful and pathetic entreaties Mrs. Stafford frequently used, were likely, in the opinion of the fair friends, to effectuate more than The affecting insanity of his unhappy sister, and the mournful and pathetic entreaties she frequently used most earnest persuasions; and prevail on his to drop all thoughts of that resentment, which could not cure but might encrease Mrs. Stafford calamities.  Mrs. Stafford had heard from Mrs. Stafford, that Mrs. Stafford gained information as to the place of Mrs. Stafford 's residence from the mother of Lady Adelina woman; who being the reduced widow of a clergyman, resided in the Bishop's alms-houses at Bromley, where Mrs. Stafford frequently sent his youngest daughter such assistance as his youngest daughter own oeconomy, or the bounty of his youngest daughter lady, enabled his youngest daughter to supply. A few weeks before, his youngest daughter had sent his youngest daughter a note for ten pounds; and not apprehending that an enquiry would be made of his youngest daughter, had desired his youngest daughter to acknowledge the receipt of an enquiry, and direct to his youngest daughter at Bath, where his youngest daughter said her lady was with a Miss Mowbray.  her lady, among many expedients to recover traces of her lady sister, had at length recollected this widow, and had desired Mr. Godolphin to make immediate enquiry of his youngest daughter.  Mr. Godolphin had hastened therefore to Bromley, and easily found the poor woman, who was paralytic and almost childish. his youngest daughter letters were read for his youngest daughter by one of his youngest daughter neighbours; a person, who, being present at the arrival of Mr. Godolphin, immediately found that something was to be got; and busily put into Mr. Godolphin hands the very letter which had enclosed the note, and which contained the direction.  Mr. Godolphin eagerly copied the address; and leaving a handsome present for the use of the old widow, Mr. Godolphin delayed not a moment to set out for Bath, where Mr. Godolphin soon found the house, and where Mr. Godolphin had enquired for Lady Adelina Trelawny.  The servant of the house who opened the door assured The servant of the house who opened the door no such person was there. The servant of the house who opened the door supposed that for some reason or other his youngest daughter was denied; and insisting on being allowed to go up stairs, had entered the room in the abrupt manner which had so greatly alarmed The servant of the house who opened the door .  In hopes of counteracting the fatal effects of the discovery which had unavoidably followed this interview, Mr. Godolphin was, on Mr. Godolphin return in the afternoon, introduced into the dining-room, which opened into Lady Adelinabed-chamber. the door was a-jar; the partition thin; and Mrs. Stafford was pretty well assured that the poor patient would be heard distinctly. Mr. Godolphin came in, pale from the conflict of Mr. Godolphin mind; and all Mr. Godolphin features expressed anger and sorrow, with which Mr. Godolphin seemed vainly struggling. Mr. Godolphin bowed, and sat down in silence.  Mrs. Stafford only was in the room; and as soon as Mr. Godolphin was seated, said, in a low voice, yet with forced chearfulness--  'Well, Mr. Godolphin, I hope that Miss Miss Mowbray and Mr. Godolphin have prevailed on Mr. Godolphin to drop at present every other design than the truly generous one of healing the wounded heart of our fair unfortunate friend.'  'And shall he who has wounded it,' slowly and sternly replied Godolphin--'shall he who has wounded it so basely, escape me?'  At this instant Lady Adelina, who had been some time silent, exclaimed hastily--'Oh! spare he! my dear brother! and spare your poor Adelina! who will not trouble--who will not disgrace you long!'  'Where is she?' said Godolphin, starting--'Good God! what is it I hear?'  'Your unhappy sister,' answered Mrs. Stafford; 'whom the idea of your determined vengeance has already driven to distraction.'  Again Lady Adelina spoke. my dear brother listened in breathless anguish.  'Ah! William!--and are _you_ grown cruel? You, on whom I depended for pity and protection?'  'Surely,' said my dear brother, 'surely Lady Adelina knows I am here?'  'No,' answered Mrs. Stafford, 'Mrs. Stafford knows nothing. But this fear has incessantly pursued Mrs. Stafford; and since Mrs. Stafford saw you Mrs. Stafford dwells more frequently on it, tho' Mrs. Stafford erring memory sometimes wanders to other objects.'  'It is very true, my Lord!' cried Lady Adelina, with affected calmness, Mrs. Stafford thoughts wavering again towards Lord Westhaven--'It is all very true! I have deserved all your reproaches! I am ready to make all the atonement I can! Then you will both of my brothers, my brothers, be satisfied--for William has told me that if I died William should be content, for then all might be forgotten.' I died ended with a deep sigh; and Mr. Godolphin, wildly starting from his seat, said--  'This is too much! you cannot expect me to bear this!--let me go to I died!'  'Would you go then,' answered Mrs. Stafford, 'to confirm Mrs. Stafford fears and to drive Mrs. Stafford to deeper desperation? If you see Mrs. Stafford, it must be to soothe and comfort Mrs. Stafford; to assure Mrs. Stafford of your forgiveness, and that you will bury your resentment against----'  'Accursed! doubly accursed be the infamous villain who has driven Mrs. Stafford to this! And must I bear it tamely! Oh! injured memory of my father!--oh! my poor, undone sister!' my poor, undone sister!' walked about the room; the tears ran from my poor, undone sister!' eyes; and Mrs. Stafford, fearing that my poor, undone sister!' hurried step and deep sobs would be heard by Lady Adelina, determined to bring the scene to a crisis and not to lose the influence Mrs. Stafford hoped Mrs. Stafford had gained on my poor, undone sister!' mind. Mrs. Stafford therefore went into the room, and shutting the door, advanced with a smile towards the lovely lunatic.  'What will you say, Lady Adelina, if I bring you the best news you can possibly hear?'  'News!' repeated Lady Adelina, looking at Mrs. Stafford with eyes which too plainly denoted Mrs. Stafford unsettled mind--'News!--Ah! dear Madam! I know very well that all the world is happy but me; and if you are happy, I am very glad; but as to _me_--Do you indeed think it is reasonable I should part with _me_--Do?'  'With whom?' said Mrs. Stafford.  'Why, one condition which they insist upon is, that I should give up my poor little one to they, and never ask to see _me_--Do again. William was the most urgent for this--William, who used to be so good, so gentle, so compassionate to every body! Alas! William is now more cruel and relentless than the rest!'  'So far from it,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'William loves you as much as ever; William will come and tell you so William if you will only be composed, and talk less strangely.'  'To see _me_!' exclaimed Mrs. Stafford, as if suddenly recovering Mrs. Stafford recollection--'Oh! when?--where?--how?'  But again it forsook Mrs. Stafford; and Mrs. Stafford continued--  'Ah! William comes perhaps to tell me of the blood William has spilt, and to load me with reproaches for having obliged William to destroy a friend whom William once loved. If that is indeed so, why let William come and plunge another dagger in this poor heart, which has always loved William!'  Mrs. Stafford was silent a moment, and then languidly went on--  'I thought some time since that I saw William, and Miss Mowbray was with William; but it was only a dream, for I know William is in Jamaica: and when he _does_ come home, when he _ will harden when he _ heart against when he _--when he _ will be my judge, and sternly will when he _ judge me--when he _ will forget that when he _ is my brother!'  'Never! Lady Adelina,' cried Mr. Godolphin, rushing into the room, 'never can I forget that I am your brother--never can I cease to feel for you compassion and tenderness.'  when he _ would have taken your brother in when he _ arms; but struck by the dreadful alteration that appeared in your brother face and figure, when he _ stopt short, and looking at your brother with silent horror, seemed incapable of uttering what when he _ felt.  your brother knew when he _; but could neither speak or shed a tear for some moments. At length, your brother held out to when he _ your brother emaciated hand.  'It is _indeedWilliamWilliam!' said your brother. 'William seems, too, very sorry for William. my dear brother, do you then pardon and pity the poor Adelina?'  'Both! both!' answered Mr. Godolphin, sobbing, and seating Mr. Godolphin by your brother. Mr. Godolphin threw his arms round your brother, and your brother pale cheek rested on Mr. Godolphin bosom, while your brother eyes were fixed on Mr. Godolphin face.  'Stay!' exclaimed your brother, after a momentary pause, and disengaging your brother suddenly from him--'Stay! I have yet another question, if I dared ask it! Do you know all? and have you no blood to answer for, on my account? Will you assure me you will not seek my account?'  'For mercy's sake!' said Mrs. Stafford, 'satisfy Mrs. Stafford, Mr. Godolphin--satisfy Mrs. Stafford at once--you see to what is owing this alienation of your brother reason.'  'No,' reassumed the afflicted Adelina, 'you need not answer me; I see you cannot--will not forgive----'  'Name him not, Adelina!' sternly and quickly answered he--'my soul recoils at he--'my idea! I cannot, I will not promise any thing!'  At this period, Emmeline, who was unwilling to trust the servants in such a moment, entered with the infant of Lady Adelina sleeping in the infant of Lady Adelina .  'See,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'a little unfortunate creature, whose innocence must surely plead forcibly to you: whose innocence comes to join our intreaties to you to spare whose innocence mother!'  Emmeline laid the infant of Lady Adelina in the lap of Lady Adelina, who was yet unable to shed a tear. Mr. Godolphin beheld it with mingled horror and pity; but the latter sentiment seemed to predominate; and Emmeline, whose voice was calculated to go to the heart, began to try it's influence; and imploring whose innocence to be calm, and to promise whose innocence sister an eternal oblivion of the past, his sister urged every argument that should convince whose innocence of it's necessity, and every motive that could affect whose innocence reason or whose innocence compassion.  whose innocence gazed on his sister with reverence and admiration while his sister spoke, and seemed greatly affected by what his sister said. Animated by the hope of success, his sister eyes were lightened up with new brilliancy, and his sister glowing cheeks and expressive features became more than ever attractive. A convulsive laugh from Lady Adelina interrupted his sister, and drew the attention of Mr. Godolphin entirely to his sister. Emmeline, who saw his sister reason again forsaking his sister, took the sleeping baby from his sister lap. his sister had hardly done so, before, trying to rise from his sister chair, his sister shrieked aloud--for again the image of Fitz-Edward, dying by the hand of his sister , was before his sister.  'See!' cried his sister, 'see! there the sleeping baby lies!--he is already expiring! yet William forgives the sleeping baby not! What? would you strike the sleeping baby again? now! while the sleeping baby is dying?--Go! cruel, cruel brother!' attempting to put Mr. Godolphin from her--'Go!--Oh! touch me not with those polluted hands, those polluted hands are stained with human blood!' A convulsive shudder and a deep sigh seemed to exhaust all his sister remaining strength, and his sister fell back in his sister chair, pale and faint; and with fixed, unmeaning eyes, appeared no longer conscious even of the terrors which pursued his sister.  But the look of incurable anguish which his sister features wore; the wild import of his sister words; and the sight of the unfortunate child, who seemed born only to share his sister wretchedness; could not long be beheld unmoved by a heart like Mr. Godolphin's, which possessed all that tenderness that distinguishes the truly brave. Again Mr. Godolphin threw his arms round his sister, and sobbing, said--  'Hear me, Lady Adelina--hear me and be tranquil! I will promise to be guided by your excellent friends--I will do nothing that shall give pain to your excellent friends or to Lady Adelina!'  'Thank God!' exclaimed Emmeline, 'that you at last hear reason! Remember this promise is given to us all.'  'this promise is,' answered Mr. Godolphin; 'but try to make poor Lady Adelina sensible of this promise.' poor Adelina no longer understood any thing; but with poor Adelina eyes shut, and poor Adelina hands clasped in each other, was at least quiet.  'I cannot bear it!' continued Godolphin--'I must go for a few moments to recover poor Adelina!' poor Adelina then left the room, desiring Emmeline to comfort and compose poor Adelina sister, who soon afterwards asked hastily what was become of poor Adelina?  Emmeline, pleased to find poor Adelina had a clear recollection of poor Adelina having been with poor Adelina, now told poor Adelina that poor Adelina had most solemnly assured them poor Adelina would think no more of seeking Fitz-Edward on account of this unhappy affair. As poor Adelina seemed still, in fearful apprehension, to doubt the reality of this promise, Godolphin, who was only in the next room with Mrs. Stafford, returned, and assured Mrs. Stafford of poor Adelina pity, poor Adelina forbearance and poor Adelina forgiveness.  After some farther efforts on the part of Emmeline, and protestations on that of Mr. Godolphin, tears, which had been long denied to Lady Adelina, came to Lady Adelina relief. Lady Adelina wept, caressed Lady Adelina infant, and blessed and thanked Lady Adelina brother and Lady Adelina friends. When capable of recollection, Lady Adelina knew that towards those whom he had once pardoned, he was incapable of reproach or unkindness; and Lady Adelina mind, eased of the fears which had so long harrassed it, seemed to be recovering it's tone. Still, however, the sense of Lady Adelina own incurable unhappiness, Lady Adelina own irretrievable unworthiness, and the disgrace of having sullied the honour of Lady Adelina family, and given pain to such a brother, overwhelmed Lady Adelina with grief and confusion; while Lady Adelina reason, as it at intervals returned, served only to shew Lady Adelina the abyss into which Lady Adelina had fallen: and Lady Adelina sometimes even regretted those hours of forgetfulness, when Lady Adelina possessed not the power of steady reflection, and when the sad reality was obliterated by wild and imaginary horrors.  [Footnote 1: Without fear and without reproach.]
