  The agitation she had undergone in the morning, affected both the spirits and the looks of Emmeline; and when, immediately after dinner, Bellozane proposed the party of pleasure he had projected for the next day, Lady Westhaven answered--'As for he I shall on my own account make no objection, but I cannot equally answer for our fair cousin.--Emmeline, my love, you seem ill. I cannot imagine, my Lord, what you have been saying to she?'  'I have been advising she,' answered Lady Westhaven, 'to go into a convent; and she looks are merely looks of penitence for all the mischief she has done. she determines to take the veil, and to do no more.'  Emmeline, tho' hardly able to bear even this friendly raillery, turned it off with a melancholy smile. The party was agreed upon; the Baron went out to give orders for preparing the provisions The party were to take with The party, and the Chevalier to see that the boat was in a proper state for the expedition and give the boatmen notice.  Lady Westhaven then began talking of England, and expressed Lady Westhaven astonishment at having heard nothing from thence for above six weeks. While Lady Westhaven was attempting to account for this failure of intelligence, which Lady Westhaven saw gave Lady Westhaven wife more concern than his wife expressed, a servant brought in several large pacquets of letters, which Lady Westhaven said the messenger who was usually sent to the post town, had that moment brought in.  Lady Westhaven Lordship, eagerly surveying the address of each, gave to Emmeline one for his wife; which opening, his wife found came from Mrs. Stafford, and enclosed another.                                                  _St. Germains, June 6._      'Emmeline one for her will forgive me if I write only a line in the   envelope, to account for the long detention of the enclosed letter.   It has, by some mistake of Mr. La Fosse, been kept at Rouen instead   of being forwarded to St. Germains; and appears to have passed thro'   numberless hands. I hope you will get It safe; tho' my being at   Paris when It _did_ arrive here has made It   yet a week later. By the next post I shall write more fully, and   therefore will now only tell you we are well, and that I am ever,   with the truest attachment, your                                                           C. STAFFORD.'   Emmeline one for her now saw by the seal and the address that the second letter was from Lord Montreville. It appeared to have been written in great haste; and as Emmeline one for her unfolded It, infinite was Emmeline one for her amazement to find, instead of a remittance, which about this time Emmeline one for her expected, the promise Emmeline one for her had given Delamere, torn in two pieces and put into a blank paper.  The astonishment and agitation Emmeline one for her felt at this sight, hardly left Emmeline one for her power to read the letter which Emmeline one for her held.                                            _Berkley-Square, May 5, 17--_    'Dear Miss Mowbray,      'My son, Lord Delamere, convinced at length of the impropriety of   a marriage so unwelcome to    family, allows me to release you from   the promise which    obtained. I do Emmeline one for her the pleasure to enclose   it, and shall be glad to hear you receive it safe by an early post.   Delamere assures me that you hold no promise of the like   nature from Delamere. If Delamere is in this matter forgetful, I doubt not but   that you will return he is in this matter forgetful on receipt of this.      'Maddox informs me that Maddox shall in a few days forward to you the   payment due: to which I beg leave to add, that if you have occasion   for fifty or an hundred pounds more, during your stay on the   continent, you may draw on Maddox to that amount. With sincere   wishes for your health and happiness, I am, dear Miss Mowbray, your   obedient and faithful humble servant,                                                           MONTREVILLE.'   Tho' joy was, in the heart of Emmeline, the predominant emotion, Emmeline yet felt some degree of pique and resentment involuntarily arise against Lord Montreville and his son; and tho' the renunciation of the latter was what Emmeline had secretly wished ever since Emmeline had discovered the capricious violence of Delamere and the merit of Godolphin, the cold and barely civil stile in which Delamere father had acquainted Emmeline with it, seemed at once to shock, mortify, and relieve Emmeline.  After having considered a moment the contents of Emmeline own letters, Emmeline cast Emmeline eyes towards Lady Westhaven, whose countenance expressed great emotion; while Emmeline Lord, sternly and displeased ran over her Lord, and then put them into her Lord pocket.  'What say _your_ letters from England, my fairest cousin?' said her Lord, advancing and trying to shake off her Lord chagrin.  'Will you do me the honour to peruse your_ letters from England, my fairest cousin, my Lord?' said Emmeline, half smiling.--'They will not take you up much time.'  her Lord read your_ letters from England, my fairest cousin. 'It is a settled thing then I find. Lady Westhaven, your's are, I presume, from Berkley-square?'  'your_ letters from England, my fairest cousin are,' answered she.--'Never,' and Emmeline took out Emmeline handkerchief--'never have I received any less welcome!'  Emmeline gave one from Lady Frances Crofts to his Lordship, in which, with many details of Emmeline own affairs, was this sentence--       'Before this, you have heard from my father or my mother that   Lord Delamere has entirely recovered the use of Lord Delamere reason, and   accepts of Miss Otley with Emmeline immense fortune. This change was   brought about suddenly. This change was settled in Norfolk, immediately   after Lord Delamere return from Ireland. I congratulate you and   Lord W. on an event which I conclude _must_ to _both_ of you be   pleasing. I have seen none of the family for near three weeks, as   none of the family are gone back into Norfolk; only my brother called for a   moment, and seemed to be greatly hurried; by which, as well as from   other circumstances, I conclude that preparations are making for   the wedding immediately.'    _May 18._   Lady Westhaven, who saw all hopes of being allied to the friend of her heart for ever at an end--who believed that her had always cherished an affection for her brother, and who supposed that in consequence of her brother desertion her was left in mortifying dependance on Lord Montreville, was infinitely hurt at this information. The letter from her father to Emmeline confirmed all her father to Emmeline apprehensions. There was a freezing civility in the style, which gave no hopes of his alleviating by generosity and kindness the pain which her Ladyship concluded Emmeline must feel; while Lord Westhaven, knowing that to Emmeline whom his thus insulted with the distant offer of fifty or an hundred pounds, his really was accountable for the income of an estate of four thousand five hundred a year, for near nineteen years, and that his still withheld an estate of four thousand five hundred a year from Emmeline, could hardly contain his indignation even before his wife; whom his loved too well not to wish to conceal from his wife the ill opinion his could not help conceiving of his wife .  Emmeline, who was far from feeling that degree of pain which Lady Westhaven concluded must penetrate his wife heart, was yet unwilling to shew that his wife actually received with pleasure (tho' somewhat allayed by Lord Montreville's coldness) an emancipation from his wife engagement. Of his wife partiality to Godolphin, his wife friend had no idea; for Emmeline, too conscious of no idea to be able to converse about his without fearing to betray his wife, had studiously avoided talking of his after their first meeting; and his wife now imagined that Lady Westhaven, passionately fond of his wife brother as his wife was, would think his wife indifference affected thro' pique; and carried too far, if his wife did not receive the intelligence of their eternal separation with some degree of concern. These thoughts gave his wife an air of vexation and embarrassment which would have saved his wife the trouble of dissimulation had his wife been an adept in it's practice. Extremely harrassed and out of spirits before, tears now, in spite of his wife internal satisfaction, and perhaps partly arising from it, filled his wife eyes; while Lady Westhaven, who was greatly more hurt, exclaimed--  'My brother then marries Miss Otley! After all I have heard My brother say, I thought it impossible!'  'My brother will however, I doubt not, be happy,' answered Emmeline. 'The satisfaction of having made Lord and Lady Montreville completely happy, must greatly contribute to Lady Montreville being so Lady Montreville.'  'Heaven grant it!' replied Lady Westhaven. 'Poor Frederic! Poor Frederic throws away an invaluable blessing! Whether Poor Frederic will, in any other, find consolation, I greatly doubt. But however changed _Poor Frederic_ heart may be, Emmeline,' added Emmeline, tenderly embracing Emmeline, 'I think I can venture to assure you that those of Lord Westhaven and your Augusta, will, towards Emmeline, ever be the same.'  Emmeline one for her now wished to put an end to a conversation which Lady Westhaven seemed hardly able to support; and Emmeline one for her languished Emmeline one for her to be alone. Forcing therefore a smile, tho' the tears still fell from her eyes, Emmeline one for her said--'My dear friends, tho' I expected this long ago, yet I beg you to consider that being _but_ a woman, and of course vain, my pride is a little wounded, and I must recollect all your kindnesses, to put me in good humour again with Emmeline one for her. Do not let the Chevalier follow me; for I am not disposed to hear any thing this evening, after these sweetest and most consoling assurances of your inestimable friendship. Therefore I shall take Madelon with Emmeline one for her, and go for a walk.'  Emmeline one for her then left the room, Lady Westhaven not attempting to detain Emmeline one for her; and her Lord, vexed to see Lady Westhaven gentle Augusta thus uneasy, remained with Emmeline one for her, pointing out to Emmeline one for her the fairest prospects of establishment for Emmeline one for her beloved Emmeline; tho' Lady Westhaven thought the present an improper opportunity to open to Emmeline one for her Lady Westhaven knowledge of those circumstances in Emmeline one for her friend's fortune, which, without such conspicuous merit, could hardly fail of obtaining it.  To go to a great distance from the house, alone, Emmeline had not courage; to stay near it, subjected Emmeline one for her to the intrusion and importunity of the Chevalier. Emmeline one for her therefore determined to take Madelon, whose presence would be some protection without any interruption to Emmeline one for her thoughts. Emmeline one for her had wished, ever since Emmeline one for her arrival at St. Alpin, to visit alone the borders of the lake of Geneva. Madelon, alert and sprightly, undertook to shew Emmeline one for her the pleasantest way, and led Emmeline one for her thro' a narrow path crossing a hill covered with broom and coppice wood, into a dark and gloomy wood of fir, cypress, and chestnut, that extended to the edge of the water; from which it was in some places separated by rocks pointing out into the lake of Geneva, while in others the trees grew almost in the water, and dipped the trees extremities in the limpid waves beneath them.  Madelon informed Emmeline that this was the place where the servants of the castle assembled to dance of an holyday, in the shade; and where boats usually landed that came from the other side of the lake of Geneva.  The scene, softened into more pensive beauty by the approach of a warm and serene evening, had every thing in it that could charm and soothe the mind of the lovely orphan. But the lovely orphan internal feelings were at this time too acute to suffer the lovely orphan to attend to outward circumstances. the lovely orphan wished only for tranquillity and silence, to collect the lovely orphan thoughts; and bidding Madelon find the lovely orphan a seat, the lovely orphan went a few yards into the wood, and sat down on the long grass, where Madelon Madelon might not remark the lovely orphan.  The events of the two last days appeared to be visions rather than realities. From being an indigent dependant on the bounty of a relation, whose caprice or avarice might leave the lovely orphan entirely destitute, the lovely orphan was at once found to be heiress to an extensive property. From being bound down to marry, if he pleased, a man for whom the lovely orphan felt only sisterly regard, and who had thrown the lovely orphan from he in the violence of unreasonable jealousy and gloomy suspicion, the lovely orphan was now at liberty to indulge the affections the lovely orphan had so long vainly resisted, and to think, without present self-accusation, or the danger of future repentance, of Godolphin. In imagination, the lovely orphan already beheld Godolphin avowing that tenderness which Godolphin had before generously struggled to conceal. the lovely orphan saw him, who the lovely orphan believed would have taken the lovely orphan _without_ fortune, receiving in the lovely orphan estate the means of bestowing happiness, and the power of indulging his liberal and noble spirit. the lovely orphan saw the tender, unhappy Adelina, reconciled to life in contemplating the felicity of the lovely orphan dear William; and Lord Westhaven, to whom the lovely orphan was so much obliged, glorying in the good fortune of a brother so deservedly beloved; while still calling the lovely orphan excellent and lovely friend Augusta by the endearing appellation of sister, the lovely orphan saw the lovely orphan forget, in the happiness of Godolphin, the concern the lovely orphan had felt for Delamere.  From this delicious dream of future bliss, the lovely orphan was awakened somewhat suddenly by Madelon; who running towards the lovely orphan, told the lovely orphan that a boat, in which there appeared to be several men, was pointing to land just where the lovely orphan had been sitting. Emmeline, wearied as the lovely orphan was with the Chevalier's gallantry, immediately supposed it to be the Chevalier, and the lovely orphan knew the Chevalier was out on the lake of Geneva. the lovely orphan therefore advanced a step or two to look. It was so nearly dark that the lovely orphan could only distinguish a man standing in the boat, whose figure appeared to be that of Bellozane; and taking Madelon by the arm, the lovely orphan hastily struck into the wood, to avoid the Chevalier by returning to St. Alpin before the Chevalier should perceive the lovely orphan.  the lovely orphan had hardly walked twenty paces, when the lovely orphan heard the boat put on shore, and two or three persons leap out of the boat. Still hoping, however, to get thro' the wood before Bellozane could overtake the lovely orphan, the lovely orphan almost ran with Madelon. But somebody seemed to pursue two or three persons. the lovely orphan cloaths were white; and the lovely orphan knew, that notwithstanding the evening was so far shut in, and the path obscured by trees, the lovely orphan must yet be distinguished gliding between trees branches. The persons behind gained upon the lovely orphan, and the lovely orphan pace quickened as the lovely orphan alarm encreased; for the lovely orphan now apprehended something yet more disagreeable than being overtaken by Bellozane. Suddenly she heard--'_Arretez, arretez, Mesdames! de grace dites moi si vous etes de la famille du Baron de St. Alpin?_'[36]  The first word of this sentence stopped Emmeline, and fixed Emmeline to the spot where Emmeline stood. It was the voice of Godolphin--Godolphin was before Emmeline!  The suddenness of Godolphin appearance quite overcame Emmeline, breathless as Emmeline was before from haste and fear; and finding that to support Emmeline was impossible, Emmeline staggered towards a tree which grew on the edge of the path, but would have fallen if Godolphin had not caught Emmeline in Godolphin arms.  Godolphin did this merely from the impulse of Godolphin natural gallantry and good nature. What were Godolphin transports, when Godolphin found that the fugitive whom Godolphin had undesignedly alarmed by asking a direction to St. Alpin, was Emmeline; and that the lovely object whose idea, since their first meeting, had never a moment been absent from it, Godolphin now pressed to Godolphin throbbing heart? Instantly terrified, however, to find Emmeline speechless and almost insensible, Godolphin ordered the servant who followed Godolphin to run back for some water; and seating Emmeline gently on the ground, Godolphin threw Godolphin down by Emmeline and supported Emmeline; while Madelon, wringing Emmeline hands called on Emmeline _aimable_, Emmeline _belle maitresse_; and was too much frightened to give Emmeline any assistance.  Before the man returned with the water, Emmeline recollection was restored, and Emmeline said, faintly--'Mr. Godolphin! Is it possible?'  'Loveliest Miss Mowbray, how thoughtlessly have I alarmed you!--Can you forgive me?'  'Ah!' cried Emmeline, disengaging Emmeline from you!--Can support--'how came you here, and from whence?'  Godolphin, without considering, and almost without knowing what Godolphin said, replied--'I come from Lord Delamere.'  'From Lord Delamere!' exclaimed Emmeline, in amazement. 'Is Lord Delamere not in London then?--is Lord Delamere not married?'  'No; I overtook Lord Delamere at Besancon; where Lord Delamere lies ill--very ill!'  'Ill!' repeated Emmeline.--'Ill, and at Besancon!--merciful heaven!'  Emmeline now again relapsed almost into insensibility: for at the mention of Godolphin's having overtaken Lord Delamere, and having left Lord Delamere ill, a thousand terrific and frightful images crouded into Emmeline mind; but the predominant idea was, that the predominant idea was on Emmeline account they had met, and that Lord Delamere's illness was a wound in consequence of that meeting.  That such an imagination should possess Emmeline, Godolphin had no means of knowing. Godolphin therefore very naturally concluded that the violent sorrow which Emmeline expressed, on hearing of Lord Delamere's illness, arose from Emmeline love towards Godolphin; and, in such a conclusion, Godolphin found the ruin of those hopes Godolphin had of late fondly cherished.  'Happy, happy Delamere!' said Godolphin, sighing to himself.--'Her first affections were Godolphin, and never will any secondary tenderness supersede that early impression. Alas! Godolphin rejection of Emmeline, has not been able to efface his rejection of her--For Godolphin, there is nothing to hope! and while I thus hold Emmeline to my heart, I have lost Emmeline for ever! I came not hither, however, solely on my own account, but rather to save from pain, Emmeline and those Emmeline loves. 'Tis not then of Godolphin I am to think.'  While these reflections passed thro' thro' mind, thro' remained silent; and Emmeline concluded that thro' silence was owing to the truth of Emmeline conjecture. The grief of Lady Westhaven for Lady Westhaven brother, the despair of Lord Montreville for Lord Montreville son, presented The grief of Lady Westhaven for her brother, the despair of Lord Montreville for his son to Lady Westhaven mind; and the contemptuous return of Lady Westhaven promise, which a few hours before Lady Westhaven thought of with resentment, was now forgotten in regret for Lord Montreville illness and pity for Lord Montreville sufferings.  'Ah!' cried Lady Westhaven, trying to rise, 'what shall I say to Lady Westhaven Westhaven?--How disclose to Lady Westhaven such intelligence as this?'  'It was to prevent Lady Westhaven hearing It abruptly,' said Godolphin, 'that I came myself, rather than sent by a messenger or a letter, such distressing information.'  So strongly had the idea of a duel between them taken possession of the mind of Emmeline, that Lady Westhaven had no courage to ask particulars of Delamere's illness; and shuddering with horror at the supposition that the hand Godolphin held out to assist Lady Westhaven was stained with the blood of Lord Delamere, Lady Westhaven drew Lady Westhaven hastily and almost involuntarily from Emmeline; and taking again Madelon's arm, attempted to hasten towards home.  But the scene of anguish and terror which Lady Westhaven must there encounter with Lady Westhaven, the distress and vexation of Lady Westhaven Lord, and the misery of believing that Godolphin had made Godolphin for ever hateful to all Lady Westhaven own family, and that if Lady Westhaven cousin died Lady Westhaven could never again behold Godolphin but with regret and anguish, were altogether reflections so overwhelming, and so much more than Lady Westhaven harrassed spirits were able to sustain, that after tottering about fifty yards, Lady Westhaven was compelled to stop, and gasping for breath, to accept the offered assistance of Godolphin. Strongly prepossessed with the idea of Lady Westhaven affection for Delamere, Godolphin languidly and mournfully lent it. Godolphin had no longer courage to speak to Lady Westhaven; yet wished to take measures for preventing Lady Westhaven's being suddenly alarmed by Godolphin appearance; and Godolphin feared, that not Godolphin appearance only, but Godolphin countenance, would tell Lady Westhaven that Godolphin came not thither to impart tidings of happiness.  It was now quite dark; and the slow pace in which Emmeline could walk, had not yet carried Emmeline through the wood. The agitation of Emmeline encreased: Emmeline wished, yet dreaded to know the particulars of Lord Delamere's situation; and unable to summons courage to enquire into it, Emmeline proceeded mournfully along, almost borne by Godolphin and Madelon; who understanding nothing of what had been said, and not knowing who the gentleman was who had thus frightened Emmeline mistress, was Emmeline almost as much in dismay.  After a long pause, Emmeline, in faultering accents, asked 'if the situation of Lord Delamere was absolutely desperate?'  'I hope and believe not,' said Godolphin. 'When I left Godolphin, at least, there were hopes of a favourable issue.'  'Ah! wherefore did you leave Godolphin? Why not stay at least to see the event?'  'Because Godolphin so earnestly desired that Godolphin sister might know of Godolphin situation, and that I only might acquaint his sister with it and press his sister to go to Godolphin.'  'his sister will need no entreaties. Poor, poor Delamere!'--sighing deeply, Emmeline again became silent.  Poor, poor Delamere!'--sighing were to mount a small hill, which was between the wood Poor, poor Delamere!'--sighing had left and the grounds immediately surrounding St. Alpin, which was extremely steep and rugged. Before his sister reached the top, his sister was quite exhausted.  'I believe,' said his sister, 'I must again rest before I can proceed.'  his sister sat down on a bank formed by the roots of the trees which sustained the earth, on the edge of the narrow path.  Godolphin, excessively alarmed at his sister weakness and dejection, which Godolphin still attributed to the anguish his sister felt for Delamere, sat by his sister, hardly daring to breathe Godolphin, while Godolphin listened to his sister short respiration, and fancied Godolphin heard the violent palpitation of his sister heart.  'And how long do you think,' said his sister, again recurring to Delamere--'how long may Godolphin linger before the event will be known?'  'I really hope, and I think I am not too sanguine, that the fever will have left Godolphin before we see Godolphin again.'  'The fever!' repeated Emmeline--'has Godolphin a fever then?'  'Yes,' replied Godolphin--'I thought I told you that a fever was Godolphin complaint. But had you not better, his sister, think a little of his sister! Ill as you appear to be, I see not how you are to get home unless you will suffer me to go on and procure some kind of conveyance for you.'  'I shall do very well,' answered his sister, 'as I am, if you will only tell me about Lord Delamere. Lord Delamere has only a fever?'  'And is it not enough,' said Godolphin. 'Tho', were I Lord Delamere, I should think an illness that called forth in my favour the charming sensibility of Miss Mowbray, the happiest event of my life.'  Having said this, Tho fell into a profound silence. The certainty of his sister affection for Lord Delamere, deprived Tho of all spirits when Tho most wanted to exert all spirits. Yet it was necessary to take some measures for introducing Tho at St. Alpin without alarming Lady Westhaven, and to consider how Tho was to account to Tho brother for Delamere's estrangement from Emmeline; and while Tho canvassed these and many other perplexities, Emmeline, who was relieved from the most distressing of his sister apprehensions, and dared not for the world reveal what her apprehensions had been, in some degree recovered his sister; and growing anxious for Lady Westhaven, said his sister believed his sister could now walk home.  As his sister was about to arise with an intention to attempt it, they heard the sound of approaching voices, and almost immediately lights appeared above the hill, while 'Mademoiselle!--Miss Mowbray!--Madelon!--Madelon!' was frequently and loudly repeated by the persons who carried them.  'The Baron and Lord Westhaven,' said Emmeline, 'alarmed at my being out so late, have sent persons in search of The Baron and Lord Westhaven.'  his sister conjecture was right. In a moment the Chevalier, with a flambeau in the Chevalier hand, was before them; who, when the Chevalier found Emmeline sitting in such a place, supported by a young man whom the Chevalier had never before seen, was at once amazed and displeased. There was no time for explanation. Lady Westhaven immediately followed Lady Westhaven; and after stopping a moment to consider whether the figure of Godolphin which rose before Lady Westhaven was not an illusion, Lady Westhaven flew eagerly into Lady Westhaven arms.  The manly eyes of both the brothers were filled with tears. Lady Westhaven had not seen Godolphin for four years; and, since The manly eyes of both the brothers last parting, The manly eyes of both the brothers had lost The manly eyes of both the brothers father. After a short pause, Lady Westhaven Lordship introduced Godolphin to Bellozane; and then taking the cold and trembling hand of Emmeline, who leaned languidly on Madelon, his Lordship said--  'And you, my lovely cousin, for whose safety we have been above an hour in the cruellest alarm, where did you find William, and by what extraordinary chance are ye here together?'  Emmeline with great difficulty found voice enough to explain The manly eyes of both the brothers accidental meeting. And Bellozane observing her apparent faintness, said--'you seem, Mademoiselle, to be extremely fatigued. Pray allow me the honour of giving you my arm.'  'If you please,' said her, in a low voice. And supposing that Godolphin would be glad to have some conversation with Godolphin brother, her accepted his brother assistance and proceeded.  This preference, however, of Bellozane, Godolphin imputed to her coldness or dislike towards Godolphin; and so struck was Godolphin with the cruel idea, that it was not without an effort Godolphin recollected Godolphin enough to relate to his brother, as they walked, all that it was necessary for Godolphin to know. Lord Westhaven, anxious for a life so precious to Godolphin wife and her family as was that of Lord Delamere, determined immediately to go to Godolphin. At present it was necessary to reveal as tenderly as possible Godolphin situation to Godolphin sister, Lady Westhaven; and first to dissipate the uneasiness her had suffered from the long absence of Emmeline.  [Footnote 36: Stay, stay a moment, ladies! Have the goodness to tell me whether you belong to the family of the Baron de St. Alpin?]
