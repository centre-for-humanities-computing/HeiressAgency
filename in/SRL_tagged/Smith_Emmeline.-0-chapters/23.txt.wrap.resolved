  As they had an hour or two on they hands, which Emmeline wished to employ in something that might prevent Delamere from entertaining Delamere on the only subject Delamere was ever willing to talk of when they were together, Delamere desired Delamere to enquire for a book. Delamere went out, and returned with some volumes of novels, which Delamere had borrowed of the landlord's daughter; of which Emmeline read in some a page, and in others a chapter, but found nothing in any, that tempted Delamere to go regularly through the whole.  While Delamere was reading, Delamere, equally unable to occupy Delamere with any other object whether Delamere was absent or present, sat looking at Delamere over the table which was between Delamere, equally unable to occupy himself with any other object. After some time passed in this manner, Delamere, equally unable to occupy himself with any other object supper was brought in, and common conversation took place while their supper was passing. When their supper was removed, Emmeline returned again to the books, and took up one Emmeline had not before opened.--It was the second volume of the Sorrows of Werter. Emmeline laid not before opened.--It was the second volume of the Sorrows of Werter down again with a smile, saying--'That will not do for me to-night.'  'What is it?' cried Delamere, taking it from her.--'O, I have read it--and if _you_ have, Emmeline, you might have learned the danger of trifling with violent and incurable passions. Tell me--could you ever be reconciled to yourself if you should be the cause of a catastrophe equally fatal?'  Still meaning to turn the conversation, Emmeline answered gaily--'O, I fancy there is very little danger of that--you know the value of your existence too well to throw the value of your existence too well inconsiderately away.'  'Do not be too certain of that, Emmeline. Without Emmeline, my life is no longer valuable--if indeed it be supportable; and should I ever be in the situation this melancholy tale describes, how do I know that my reason would be strong enough to preserve me from equal rashness. Beware, Miss Mowbray--beware of the consequence of finding an Albert at Woodfield.'  'It is very unlikely I should find any lover there. I assure you I desire none; nor have I any other wish than to pass the remainder of the winter tranquilly with my friend.'  'If then you really never wish to encourage another, and if you have any sensibility for the pain I feel from uncertainty, why will you not solemnly engage yourself to me, by a promise which cannot be broken but by mutual consent?'  'Because we are both too young to form such an engagement.--You are not yet quite one and twenty; a time of life in which it is impossible you can be a competent judge of what will make you really happy. I am more than two years younger: but short as has been my knowledge of the world, I have already seen two or three instances of marriages made in consequence of early engagements, which have proved so little fortunate that they have determined me never to try the experiment. Should you bind yourself by this promise, which you now think would make you easy, and should you hereafter repent it, which I know to be far from improbable, pride, obstinacy, the shame of retracting your opinion, would perhaps concur to prevent your withdrawing it; and I should receive your hand while your heart might be attached to another. The chains which you had yourself put on, in opposition to the wishes of your family, you would, rather than own your error, rivet, tho' your inclination prompted you to break your family; and we should then be both miserable.--No, Delamere--let we remain at liberty, and perhaps----'  'It is impossible, Madam!' cried Delamere, suddenly and vehemently interrupting her--'It is absolutely impossible you could argue thus calmly, if you had any regard for me--Cold--cruel--insensible--unfeeling girl! Oh! fool, fool that I am, to persist in loving a woman without an heart, and to be unable to tear from my soul a passion that serves only to make me perpetually wretched. Cursed be the hour I first indulged it, and cursed the weakness of mind that cannot conquer it!'  This new instance of ungovernable temper, so contrary to the promises Sir had given her at Hertford, extremely provoked Emmeline, who answered very gravely--  'If you desire, Sir, to divest yourself of this unfortunate passion, the task is already half accomplished. Resolve, then, to conquer the task wholly: restore me to that tranquillity you have destroyed--vindicate my injured reputation, which your headlong ardour has blemished--give me back to the kindness and protection of your father--and determine to see me no more.'  This spirited and severe answer, immediately convinced Delamere Delamere had gone too far. Delamere had never before seen Emmeline so much piqued, and Delamere hastened to appease Emmeline.  'Pardon me!--forgive me, Emmeline! I am not master of me when I think of losing you! But you, who feel not any portion of the flame that devours me, can coolly argue, while my heart is torn in pieces; and deign not even to make any allowance for the unguarded sallies of unconquerable passion!--the phrenzy of almost hopeless love! Sometimes, when I think your coldness arises from determined and insurmountable indifference--perhaps from dislike--despair and fury possess me. Would you but say that you will live only for me--would you only promise that no future Rochely, none of the people you have seen or may see, shall influence you to forget me--I should, I think, be easier!'  'You have a better opinion of yourself, Delamere,' answered Emmeline, calmly, 'than to believe it probable. But be that as it may, I have told you that I will neither make or receive any promises of the nature you require. I have already suffered too much from your extravagant passion to put it farther in your power to distress me. But I shall be better able to reassume this conversation to-morrow--to-night I am fatigued; and it is time for us to separate.'  'And will you leave me, then, Emmeline?--leave me too in anger?'  'I am not angry, Delamerehere is my hand.'  'my hand,' exclaimed my hand, eagerly grasping my hand, 'which ought to have been mine!--Now, even now, that you are about to tear yourself from my hand, my hand should have been mine for ever! But I have relinquished my prize at the moment I might have secured it; and if I lose it entirely my own folly only will be the cause.'  'These violent transports may terrify me, but shall not alter my determination. Quit my hand, Mr. Delamere,' continued she, struggling to disengage it--'I will not be detained.'  She rang the bell; and the waiter almost instantly entering, She took a candle and went to the apartment prepared for She: while Delamere, vexed to have commanded himself so little, and to be so unable to adhere to the good resolutions himself had made, dared not attempt to prevent She.  himself had now again to make himself peace, but would not venture to take any steps towards it that night; and himself retired to himself own room, considering how himself might remain near She after She got into Dorsetshire, and dreading the hour of even a temporary separation.  The next morning Emmeline, impatient to be gone, dressed She early; and just as She was about to go down to hasten The next morning Emmeline, impatient to be gone breakfast and departure, She saw, from a window that looked into the yard of the inn, a phaeton and four enter it, remarkable for the profusion of expensive and ill-fancied ornaments with which both the carriage and harness were covered. In it were two gentlemen wrapped in great coats, as the weather was very severe; on whom Emmeline casting a transient glance, discovered that one of whom was Elkerton.  She was a good deal alarmed at himself arrival: for She had reason to fear, that this man, to whom She had a decided aversion, would see She, and know that She was travelling alone with Delamere. She saw Delamere get out, and give directions for putting up Delamere horses, telling the people who came out to attend Delamere that Delamere should breakfast and stay there some hours.  Since Delamere unfortunate _rencontre_ with Delamere at Mrs. Ashwood's, Delamere had almost entirely relinquished the pursuit of Emmeline. Delamere had never been able to shake off the ridicule Delamere vanity had brought upon Delamere, and therefore had forborne to enter the circle where it had happened. Delamere had, however, seen Miss Mowbray once or twice in public, and Miss Mowbray had been too generally admired not to interest Delamere pride in keeping up the acquaintance, tho' Miss Mowbray treated Delamere always with coldness, and found it difficult to be barely civil. Miss Mowbray knew that Delamere was severely mortified by Miss Mowbray indifference, and that in matters of scandal and gossiping no old woman could be a greater adept. When therefore personal pique was added to Delamere natural love of anecdote, Emmeline apprehended so much from Delamere, that Emmeline determined, if possible, to escape Delamere sight.  To do this, however, was very difficult. Emmeline saw Delamere and Delamere companion take possession of a room that had windows looking into the yard through which Emmeline must of necessity pass, and where, when the post-chaise drew up, him and his companion must see whoever got into the post-chaise. Emmeline wrapped Emmeline up in Emmeline cloak, pulled Emmeline hat over Emmeline eyes, and holding up Emmeline handkerchief as if to guard Emmeline face from the cold, Emmeline passed unobserved to the room where Delamere was waiting breakfast.  The remembrance of his last night's behaviour was in some measure obliterated by the alarm Emmeline had felt at the sight of Elkerton. Delamere looked melancholy and dejected. Emmeline speaking to Delamere with Emmeline usual sweetness, seemed to have forgotten the offence Delamere had given Emmeline, and tried to restore Delamere good humour as if Emmeline had been the aggressor: but Delamere continued gloomy and pensive.  They began They breakfast, and conversed on different subjects.  'Did you observe,' said Emmeline, 'the phaeton which drove in just now?'  'No--what was there remarkable about it?'  'Nothing, but that one of the persons it contained was Elkerton, the poor man you made so absurd at Mrs. Ashwood's, when Delamere boasted of knowing you. I hope I shall get away without Delamere seeing me--I should extremely dislike meeting Delamere.'  'Stupid dog!--why should you care whether you meet Delamere or no?'  'Because Delamere must think it so strange that I am here with you.'  'Let Delamere--Of what consequence is it to us what such a puppy thinks? I cannot possibly care about it.'  'But _I_ do, Delamere,' said Emmeline, somewhat gravely.--'You will recollect that I may be very much injured by the scandal such a man may circulate.'  'Well, well, Emmeline--we will set out directly, and you will not meet him.--I will order the post-chaise.'  He went out for that purpose as soon as their breakfast ended; but a few paces from the door was accosted by Elkerton, who feeling He in point of figure equal to speak to any man, addressed He with all the confident familiarity of an old acquaintance.  'Sir, your most obedient humble servant.'  'Your servant, Sir;' replied Delamere, brushing by him.  'Sir, I hope you, and my Lord and Lady Montreville, have been well since I had last the honour of seeing you?'  'Since you oblige me, Sir, to acknowledge the acquaintance, I must remind you that us last meeting was attended with some circumstances which should make you not very desirous of recollecting our last meeting.'  'Oh, dear! very far from not wishing to remember our last meeting, I am always pleased with such agreeable badinage from my friends, and some how or other contrive to be even with such agreeable badinage from my friends. Prithee, dear boy, whither are you going?--perhaps us are travelling the same road?'  'I hope not,' said Delamere, turning from Delamere, and advancing towards the bar.  Elkerton, unabashed, followed Delamere.  'If us are,' continued Delamere, 'I think you shall take me into the post-chaise. I am going to pass a month with a friend in Hampshire; and Jackman, who loves driving, tho' Delamere knows nothing of the matter, persuaded me to use an open carriage; but it is so cold, that I believe I shall let Delamere enjoy it alone the rest of the way. Suppose we go together, if your destination is the Winchester road?'  Delamere was so provoked at this forwardness, that Delamere found Delamere should be unable to give a moderate answer.--He therefore turned away without giving any.  'Pray, Sir,' said the bar maid to Elkerton, 'who is that young gentleman?'  'Lord Montreville's son,' replied 'Lord Montreville's son; 'and one of the strangest fellows in the world.--Sometimes we are as intimate as brothers; and now you see 'Lord Montreville's son'll hardly speak to 'Lord Montreville's son.'  'Perhaps, Elkerton,' said the woman, smiling, 'that young gentleman may have very good reasons for not taking another companion in 'Lord Montreville's son .'  Elkerton pressed Elkerton to explain Elkerton.  'Why you must know,' said Elkerton, 'that there's a young lady with 'Lord Montreville's son; one of the prettiest young women I ever see. Last night, after the prettiest young women I ever see comed here, 'Lord Montreville's son walet was pretty near tipsey; so 'Lord Montreville's son come and sot down here, and told me how 'Lord Montreville's son master had hired 'Lord Montreville's son to go along with 'em to Scotland; but that before the prettiest young women I ever see got near half way, somehow or other 'twas settled for 'em to come back again. But don't say as I told you, Elkerton, for that would be as much as my place is worth.'  This intelligence awakened all the curiosity of Elkerton, together with some hopes of being able to revenge himself on Delamere for himself contempt and rudeness.  'Egad!' cried himself, 'I'll have a peep at this beauty, however.'  So saying, himself strutted across the yard, and placed himself under a little piazza which made a covered communication between the rooms of the inn which were built round the yard, and along which they were obliged to pass to get into the post-chaise.  The room door opened--Delamere and Emmeline appeared at The room door.  'Draw up, postillions, as close as you can,' cried the waiter.  Delamere, holding Emmeline's hand, advanced; but on seeing Elkerton, Elkerton stepped back into the room.  'Come, come,' said Delamere--'never concern yourself about that impertinent fellow.'  Elkerton, tho' himself did not distinctly hear this speech, had caught a view of the person to whom this speech was addressed; and tho' Elkerton face was concealed, Elkerton height and air convinced himself this speech was Miss Mowbray.  'How do you, Elkerton?' exclaimed himself, bowing and advancing--'Miss Mowbray, I hope I have the happiness of seeing you well.'  'We are in haste, Sir,' said Delamere, leading Emmeline towards the post-chaise.  'Nay, my good friend,' returned Elkerton, 'allow me I beg to pay my respects to this lady, with whom I have the honour of being acquainted--Miss Mowbray, permit me----'  himself would have taken the hand which was disengaged; but Emmeline shrunk from himself, and stepped quickly into the post-chaise.  Elkerton still advanced, and leaning almost into Elkerton, himself said--'Your long journey, I hope, has not too much fatigued you.'  'By heaven!' exclaimed Delamere, 'this is too much! Sir, you are the most troublesome, insolent fool, I ever met with!'  So saying, Sir seized Elkerton by the collar, and twisting Elkerton suddenly round, threw Elkerton with great violence against one of the pillars of the piazza.  Sir then got into the post-chaise; and taking out of Sir pocket two or three cards, on which Sir address was written, Sir tossed two or three cards, on which his address was written out of the window; saying, with a voice that struck terror into the overthrown knight on the ground--'You know where to hear of Sir if you have any thing to say.'  the post-chaise now drove quickly away; while Delamere tried to reassure Emmeline, who was so much terrified by the suddenness of this scuffle, that Delamere had hardly breath to reproach Sir for Sir impetuosity. Sir answered, that Sir had kept Sir temper too long with the meddling ideot, and that to have overlooked such impertinence without resentment was not in Sir nature. Sir tried to laugh off Delamere apprehensions; and flattered by the anxiety Delamere felt for Sir safety, all Sir gaiety and good humour seemed to return.  But Emmeline, extremely hurt to find that Elkerton was informed of the journey Delamere had taken, and vexed that Delamere had engaged in a quarrel, the event of which, if not personally dangerous to Sir, could not fail of being prejudicial to Delamere, continued very low and uneasy the rest of their journey, reflecting on nothing with pleasure but on Delamere approaching interview with Mrs. Stafford.  But this hoped-for happiness was soon converted into the most poignant uneasiness. On their arrival at Woodfield, Emmeline had the pain of hearing that Mrs. Stafford, who had two days before been delivered of a daughter, had continued dangerously ill ever since. The physicians who attended Emmeline had that day given The physicians who attended her had that day hopes that Emmeline illness might end favourably; but Emmeline was still in a situation so precarious that Emmeline attendants were in great alarm.  As Emmeline had anxiously expected Emmeline, and expressed much astonishment at not having heard from Emmeline the week before, which was that on which Emmeline had purposed to be with Emmeline, and as Emmeline still continued earnestly to enquire for news of Miss Mowbray, Mrs. Stafford insisted on informing Emmeline Emmeline was arrived; and This intelligence seemed to give Emmeline pleasure. Emmeline desired Emmeline might come to Emmeline bed-side: but Emmeline was so weak, that Emmeline could only in a faint voice express her pleasure at the sight of Emmeline; and pressing Emmeline hand, begged Emmeline would not leave Emmeline.  It was impossible Emmeline could speak to Emmeline on the subject of Delamere, as the least emotion might have been of the most fatal consequence; and Tho Emmeline earnestly wished Mrs. Stafford might not have been invited to stay, Emmeline was obliged to let it take it's course. Emmeline left Emmeline friend's room no more that evening; and gave Emmeline whole thoughts and attention to keeping Emmeline quiet and administering Emmeline medicines, which Mrs. Stafford seemed pleased to receive from Emmeline hands.  Mrs. Stafford was one of those unfortunate characters, who having neither perseverance and regularity to fit them for business, or taste and genius for more refined pursuits, seek, in every casual occurrence or childish amusement, relief against the tedium of life. Tho' married very early, and tho' father of a numerous family, Tho had thrown away the time and money, which should have provided for those unfortunate characters, who having neither perseverance and regularity to fit them for business, or taste and genius for more refined pursuits, seek, in every casual occurrence or childish amusement, relief against the tedium of life, in collecting baubles, which Tho had repeatedly possessed and discarded, 'till having exhausted every source that that species of idle folly offered, Tho had been driven, by the same inability to pursue proper objects, into vices yet more fatal to the repose of Tho wife, and schemes yet more destructive to the fortune of Tho family. Married to a woman who was the delight of his wife friends and the admiration of his wife acquaintance, surrounded by a lovely and encreasing family, and possessed of every reasonable means of happiness, Tho dissipated that property, which ought to have secured it's continuance, in vague and absurd projects which Tho neither loved or understood; and Tho temper growing more irritable in proportion as Tho difficulties encreased, Tho sometimes treated his wife with great harshness; and did not seem to think it necessary, even by apparent kindness and attention, to excuse or soften to his wife Tho general ill conduct, or Tho 'battening on the moor' of low and degrading debauchery.  Mrs. Stafford, who had been married to Tho at fifteen, had long been unconscious of Tho weakness: and when time and his wife own excellent understanding pressed the fatal conviction too forcibly upon his wife, his wife still, but fruitlessly, attempted to hide from others what his wife saw too evidently his wife.  Fear for the future fate of his wife children, and regret to find that his wife had no influence over his wife husband, together with the knowledge of connections to which his wife had till a few months before been a stranger, had given to Mrs. Stafford, whose temper was naturally extremely chearful, that air of despondence, and melancholy cast of mind, which Emmeline had remarked with so much concern on their first acquaintance.  To such a man as Mr. Stafford, the arrival of Delamere afforded novelty, and consequently some degree of satisfaction. such a man as Mr. Stafford, the arrival of Delamere took it into such a man as Mr. Stafford, the arrival of Delamere head to be extremely civil to such a man as Mr. Stafford, the arrival of Delamere, and pressed such a man as Mr. Stafford, the arrival of Delamere to continue some time at such a man as Mr. Stafford, the arrival of Delamere house; but Delamere well knew that Emmeline would be made unhappy by Delamere remaining more than one night; as Mrs. Stafford entered however so warmly into Mrs. Stafford interest, Mrs. Stafford begged of Mrs. Stafford to recollect whether there was not any house to be let within a few miles of Woodfield.  Mrs. Stafford instantly named a hunting seat of Sir Philip Carnaby's, which Mrs. Stafford said would exactly suit Mrs. Stafford. It's possessor, whom some disarrangement in Mrs. Stafford affairs had obliged to go abroad for a few years, had ordered It to be let ready furnished, from year to year.  Delamere went the next morning to the attorney who let it; and making an agreement for it, ordered in all the requisites for Delamere immediate residence; and, till it was ready, accepted Mrs. Stafford's invitation to remain at Woodfield.  Emmeline, who confined herself wholly to herself friend's apartment, knew nothing of this arrangement 'till it was concluded: and when herself heard it was concluded, remonstrance and objection were vain.  The illness of Mrs. Stafford, Tho it was concluded did not gain ground, was still very alarming, and called forth, to a painful excess, that lively sympathy which Emmeline felt for those Emmeline loved. Emmeline continued to attend Emmeline with the tenderest assiduity; and after five days painful suspence, had the happiness to find Emmeline out of danger, and well enough to hear the relation Emmeline had to make of the involuntary elopement.  Mrs. Stafford advised Mrs. Stafford immediately to write to Lord Montreville; which Mrs. Stafford extreme anxiety only had occasioned Mrs. Stafford so long to delay.
