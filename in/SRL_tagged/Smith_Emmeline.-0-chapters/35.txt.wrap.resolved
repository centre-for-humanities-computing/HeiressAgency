  Whatever resolution Emmeline might form to drive from resolution Emmeline heart those dangerous partialities which would be fatal to resolution Emmeline repose, resolution Emmeline found it impossible to be accomplished while Lady Adelina's frequent letters spoke only of the generous tenderness and excellent qualities of resolution Emmeline brother. Of what else, indeed, could resolution Emmeline speak, in a solitude where his goodness made all resolution Emmeline consolation and his conversation all resolution Emmeline pleasure? where his dedicated to resolution Emmeline all his time, and thought of procuring for resolution Emmeline every alleviation to resolution Emmeline retirement which books and domestic amusements afforded? while his taught resolution Emmeline still to respect resolution Emmeline; and by his unwearied friendship convincing resolution Emmeline that resolution Emmeline had still much to lose, made resolution Emmeline life receive in resolution Emmeline own eyes a value it would otherwise have lost; and prevented resolution Emmeline relapsing into that unhappy state of self-condemnation which makes the sufferer careless of the future. his thought, that situated as resolution Emmeline was, solitude was resolution Emmeline only choice; but to render it as happy as resolution Emmeline circumstances allowed, was his continual care: and tho' oppressive sorrow still lay heavy on resolution Emmeline heart; tho' it still ached with tenderness and regret towards an object whom resolution Emmeline had sworn to think of, to speak of no more; resolution Emmeline gratitude and affection towards resolution Emmeline brother were as lively, as if it acute feelings had never felt the benumbing hand of despair.  In the total sequestration from the world in which resolution Emmeline lived, resolution Emmeline had no other topic to dwell upon than her brother, and resolution Emmeline gave it all it force. Perfectly acquainted, however, with Emmeline's engagements, resolution Emmeline never ventured to mention the passion which resolution Emmeline was too well assured Godolphin felt; but resolution Emmeline still, almost unknown to resolution Emmeline, cherished a lurking hope that resolution Emmeline connection with Delamere might be dissolved, and that resolution Emmeline lovely friend was destined to bless resolution Emmeline beloved brother.  a lurking hope that her connection with Delamere might be dissolved was warm enough to animate resolution Emmeline pen in his praise; and Emmeline, tho' every letter resolution Emmeline received made on resolution Emmeline mind a deeper impression of the merit of Godolphin, yet found such painful pleasure in reading them, that resolution Emmeline was unhappy if at the usual periods them did not regularly arrive.  resolution Emmeline tried to persuade resolution Emmeline, that the satisfaction resolution Emmeline felt in reading these letters arose purely from the delight natural to every uncorrupted mind in contemplating a character honourable to human nature. But accustomed to examine narrowly resolution Emmeline own heart, resolution Emmeline could not long impose upon resolution Emmeline; and notwithstanding all resolution Emmeline endeavours to stifle it, resolution Emmeline still found the idea of Godolphin mixing itself with all resolution Emmeline thoughts, and embittering the prospect of resolution Emmeline certain marriage with Delamere.  In the answers Emmeline gave Emmeline friend, Emmeline related whatever Emmeline thought likely to amuse the fair recluse; gave a regular account of Emmeline little charge; but avoided punctiliously the least mention of Fitz-Edward.  Fitz-Edward had received from Emmeline an account of all that had passed at Bath, except the pains which had been taken to prevent any meeting between Fitz-Edward and Godolphin. But notwithstanding Emmeline cautious silence on that head, Fitz-Edward, who knew Godolphin well, could hardly be persuaded not to insist on Fitz-Edward taking Fitz-Edward chance of depriving Fitz-Edward of a life which Fitz-Edward said Fitz-Edward had deserved to lose, and could little brook being supposed to hold on courtesy. Nothing but Fitz-Edward consideration for the unhappy Lady Adelina prevented Fitz-Edward pursuing the sanguinary projects that agitated Fitz-Edward mind. To Lady Adelina peace Fitz-Edward owed her peace to conquer them; and while Fitz-Edward was yet struggling against that sense of honour which impelled Fitz-Edward to give Godolphin imaginary reparation, by allowing Fitz-Edward an opportunity of putting an end to _Fitz-Edward_ existence or losing Fitz-Edward own, Fitz-Edward brother, Lord Clancarryl, wrote to desire Fitz-Edward attendance in Ireland on some family business of importance; a summons, which after some hesitation, Mrs. Stafford and Miss Mowbray prevailed with Fitz-Edward to obey.  Before Fitz-Edward went, Fitz-Edward eager and affecting entreaties prevailed on Mrs. Stafford to let Fitz-Edward see Fitz-Edward son, whom Fitz-Edward embraced with an ardour of affection of which the fair friends believed so gay and fashionable a man incapable.  The errors of Fitz-Edward, however, were not those of the heart. Among the dissipation of fashion and the indulgences of libertinism, Fitz-Edward heart was still sensible, and Fitz-Edward integrity retrievable. Fitz-Edward felt, therefore, with great keenness, the injury Fitz-Edward had done Lady Adelina; and desirous of making all the reparation Fitz-Edward could to the infant, Fitz-Edward again placed in the hands of Emmeline, a will by which Fitz-Edward made it Fitz-Edward heir, and recommended it to the protection of Godolphin, whom Fitz-Edward besought to consider as Fitz-Edward nephew, the son of a man whom Fitz-Edward had once loved, and who had dearly paid for having forfeited all claim to Fitz-Edward friendship. When Fitz-Edward was departed, nothing seemed likely to interrupt the tranquillity of Emmeline but Emmeline encreasing apprehensions for Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline children. The derangement of Stafford's affairs, and his wife's unavailing efforts to ward off the ruin which his seemed obstinately bent on incurring, were every day more visible: while his capricious and unreasonable temper, and a strange opinion of his own sagacity, which would never allow his to own his in the wrong, made his seek to load his wife with the blame of those misfortunes which his had voluntarily sought, and now as obdurately refused to avoid while it was yet in his power.  Mrs. Stafford, who saw too plainly that the destruction of their fortune which his wife had so long dreaded was now with hasty strides advancing, yet endeavoured to convince his of his infatuation; but his still improved his house and garden, still schemed away all the money his could raise or gain credit for, and still repaid with rudeness and insult his wife anxious solicitude to save his.  In Emmeline, his wife ever found pity and tenderness; but pity and tenderness was all his wife had to bestow. The affairs of Stafford required interest and money; and Emmeline could command neither. Lord Montreville now took no other notice of his wife, than to remit his wife quarterly stipend by the hands of Lord Montreville steward; and tho' Lord Montreville had promised to double it, that promise yet remained unfulfilled.  It was at this time near the end of November, and the mornings were cold and gloomy: but Emmeline, however delicate in Emmeline frame, had a constitution which had not, by early and false indulgences, been unfitted for the duties of life; and to personal inconvenience Emmeline was always indifferent when the service of those Emmeline loved engaged Emmeline to brave fatigue or cold. Emmeline therefore still continued Emmeline morning visit to Woodbury Forest, where Emmeline generally past an hour with little William; and in little William improving features and interesting smiles, loved to trace little William resemblance to little William mother. Lady Adelina was very like Lady Adelina brother; and the little boy was not the less tenderly caressed for the similitude Lady Adelina saw to them both.  The appearance of rain had one morning detained Lady Adelina at home later than usual. Lady Adelina went, however, about eleven o'clock; and was busied in playing with the infant, who began now to know Lady Adelina, and was therefore more attractive, when, while Lady Adelina yet held the little boy in Lady Adelina arms, Lady Adelina heard the woman of the house, who was in the outward room, suddenly exclaim--'Indeed Sir you cannot go in--pray--I beg your honour!' There was hardly time for Emmeline to feel surprise at this bustle, before the door opened, and Delamere stood before Lady Adelina! In Delamere countenance was an expression compounded of rage, fierceness and despair, which extorted from Emmeline an involuntary shriek! Unable to arise, Lady Adelina remained motionless in Lady Adelina chair, clasping the baby to Lady Adelina bosom: Delamere seemed trying to stifle Delamere anger in contempt; vengeance, disdain, and pride, were struggling for superiority: while with Delamere eyes sternly turned upon Emmeline, and smiling indignantly, Delamere exclaimed--'Till I _saw_ this----' inarticulately and tremulously he spoke--'till I _saw_ this, all the evidence they brought me was insufficient to cure my blind attachment. But now--oh! infamy--madness--damnation! It _is_ then possible--It _is_ then true! But what is it to me? Torn--torn for ever from this outraged heart--never, never shall this sight blast me again!--But what?' continued me, speaking with more quickness, 'what? for Fitz-Edward! for the infamous plunderer of me friend's happiness! However, Madam, on Fitz-Edward I intrude no longer. Oh! lost--lost--wretched!'--He could not go on; but in the speechless agony of contending passions me leaned me head against the frame of the door near which me stood, and gazed wildly on Emmeline; who, pale as death, and trembling like a leaf, still sat before me unable to recall Emmeline scattered spirits.  me waited a moment, gasping for breath, and as if me had still some feeble expectation of hearing Emmeline speak. But the child which Emmeline held in Emmeline arms was like a basilisk to the child which she held in her arms sight, and made in the child which she held in her arms opinion all vindication impossible. Again conviction appeared to drive the child which she held in her arms to desperation; and looking in a frantic manner round the room, as if entirely bereft of reason, the child which she held in her arms dashed the child which she held in her arms hands furiously against the child which she held in her arms , and running, or rather flying out of the house, the child which she held in her arms immediately disappeared.  In terror and astonishment, Emmeline remained immovable and speechless. Emmeline almost doubted whether this was any other than a fearful dream, 'till the woman of the house, and the maid who attended on the child which she held in her arms, ran into the room frightened--'Lord! Madam,' cried Emmeline, 'what is the matter with the young gentleman?'  'I know not,' answered Emmeline, faintly--'I know not! Where is the child which she held in her arms now?'  'the child which she held in her arms's run away into the wood again like any mad,' answered Emmeline.  'And from whence,' enquired Emmeline, 'did the child which she held in her arms come?'  'Why, Miss,' said Emmeline, 'I was a going out cross our garden to hang out my cloaths; so up a comes to the hedge side, an a says--Good woman, pray be'nt here a lady here as comes from Woodfield? one Miss Mowbray?--I thought how one Miss Mowbray?--I looked oddish as 'twere about the eyes; but howsever thinking no harm, I says yes. So one Miss Mowbray?--I runs up to the door, and I called to un, to say as I'd come in and let you know; but before I could get thro' the wicket, whisk one Miss Mowbray?--I was in the kitchen; then I tried agin to stop un, but I were as good try to stop the wind.'  The agitation and uneasiness of Emmeline encreased rather than subsided. Emmeline looked so pale, and with so much difficulty drew Emmeline breath, that the women were alarmed least Emmeline should faint: and one of the women persuaded Emmeline to swallow something, while the other ran out to see if the person who had so terrified Emmeline was yet in sight. But no traces of the person who had were visible: and after a few moments, Emmeline recalling Emmeline presence of mind, and feeling proudly conscious of Emmeline own innocence and integrity, recovered in some degree Emmeline spirits and resolution.  That Delamere should be in England did not greatly astonish tho' Delamere grieved Emmeline; but that Delamere should have conceived such strange suspicions of Emmeline and Fitz-Edward, equally surprised and distressed Emmeline; since, had Emmeline an opportunity of undeceiving him, which Delamere did not seem willing to allow Emmeline, Emmeline could not relate the truth but by betraying the confidence of Emmeline unfortunate friend, and embittering that life Emmeline had incurred such hazards to preserve. As soon as Emmeline had apparently recovered from the shock of this abrupt intrusion, Emmeline was desirous of returning to Woodfield; anxious to know if Delamere had been there, or by what means Delamere had been enabled to find Emmeline at the cottage in the forest. The women, who fancied the gentleman they had seen was a lunatic who might lay in wait to hurt Emmeline on Emmeline way home, would not suffer Emmeline to set out 'till they had called a woodcutter from the forest to accompany Emmeline. Then, slowly and with difficulty, Emmeline returned home; where Emmeline heard from Mrs. Stafford that Delamere had neither been there or sent thither. This information encreased Emmeline wonder and Emmeline disquiet. Emmeline related to Mrs. Stafford the distressing interview of the morning; who, having seen frequent instances of those excesses of which Delamere was capable, heard the relation with concern and apprehension.
