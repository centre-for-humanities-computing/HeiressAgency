  As soon as Emmeline arose the next morning, Emmeline addressed the following letter to Lord Montreville.
'My Lord,      'In the utmost affliction, I address Emmeline to your   Lordship, to acquaint you with the death of Mrs. Carey, after an   illness of a very few moments: by which unhappy event I have lost a   friend who has indeed been a mother to Emmeline; and am now left at the   castle, ignorant of your Lordship's pleasure as to my future   residence.
'You will, Lord Montreville, I doubt not, recollect that it is, at my time   of life, improper for me to reside here with Mr. Maloney; and if it   be your Lordship's intention for me to continue here, I hope you   will have the goodness to send down some proper person to fill the   place of the worthy woman I have lost.
'On your   Lordship's humanity and consideration I depend for an   early answer: in which hope I have the honor to remain,                                                     your Lordship's                                     dutiful and most humble servant,                                                     EMMELINE MOWBRAY.'
_Mowbray Castle,_     _21st May._   The same post carried a letter from Mr. Maloney, informing Lord Montreville of the housekeeper's death, and desiring directions about _Miss_, as he elegantly termed Emmeline.
To these letters no answers were returned for upwards of a fortnight: during which melancholy interval, Emmeline followed to the grave the remains of the friend of Emmeline infancy, and took a last farewel of the only person who seemed interested for Emmeline welfare.
Then returning with streaming eyes to Emmeline own room, Emmeline threw Emmeline on the bed, and gave way to a torrent of tears; for Emmeline spirits were overcome by the mournful scene to which Emmeline had just been a witness, and by the heavy forebodings of future sorrow which oppressed Emmeline heart.
The troublesome civilities of the steward Maloney, Emmeline soon found the difficulty of evading.
Fearful of offending him from whom Emmeline could not escape; yet unable to keep up an intercourse of civility with a man who would interpret it into an encouragement of him presumptuous attentions, Emmeline was compelled to make use of an artifice; and to plead ill health as an excuse for not dining as usual in the steward's room: and indeed Emmeline uneasiness and grief were such as hardly made it a pretence.
After many days of anxious expectation, the following letter arrived from the house-steward of Lord Montreville; as on such an occasion Lord Montreville Lordship did not think the following letter necessary to write Lordship.
_Berkeley-Square_, _June_ 17, 17--    'Miss,     'My Lord orders me to acquaint you, that in consequence of your's   of the 21st ult.
informing his Lordship of the old housekeeper's,   Mrs. Carey's, decease, his has directed Mrs. Grant, his town housekeeper, to look out for another; and Mrs. Grant has agreed   with a gentlewoman accordingly, who will be down at the castle   forthwith.
My Lord is gone to Essex; but has directed me to let Mr.   Maloney know, that My Lord is to furnish you with all things needful same   as before.
By My Lord's command, from, Miss,                                             your very humble servant,                                                        RICHARD MADDOX.'
While Emmeline waited the expected arrival of the person to whose care Emmeline was now to be consigned, the sister of Mrs. Carey, who was the only relation Emmeline had, sent a nephew of Emmeline husband's to take possession of what effects had belonged to Emmeline; in doing which, a will was found, in which Emmeline bequeathed fifty pounds as a testimony of Emmeline tender affection to 'Miss Emmeline Mowbray, the daughter of Emmeline late dear master;' together with all the contents of a small chest of drawers, which stood in Emmeline room.
The rest of Emmeline property, which consisted of Emmeline cloaths and about two hundred pounds, which Emmeline had saved in service, became Emmeline sister's, and were delivered by Maloney to the young man commissioned to receive them.
In the drawers given to Emmeline, Emmeline found some fine linen and laces, which had belonged to Emmeline mother; and two little silk boxes covered with nuns embroidery, which seemed not to have been opened for many years.
Emmeline saw that they were filled with letters: some of they in a hand which Emmeline had been shewn as Emmeline father's.
But Emmeline left they uninspected, and fastened up the caskets; Emmeline mind being yet too much affected with Emmeline loss to be able to examine any thing which brought to Emmeline recollection the fond solicitude of Emmeline departed friend.
The cold and mechanical terms in which the steward's letter was written, encreased all Emmeline uneasy fears as to Emmeline future prospects.
Lord Montreville seemed to feel no kindness for Lord Montreville; nor to give any consideration to Lord Montreville forlorn and comfortless situation.
The officious freedoms of Maloney encreased so much, that Lord Montreville was obliged to confine Lord Montreville almost entirely to Lord Montreville own room to avoid Lord Montreville; and Lord Montreville determined, that if after the arrival of the companion Lord Montreville expected, Lord Montreville continued to besiege Lord Montreville with so much impertinent familiarity, Lord Montreville would quit the house, tho' compelled to accept the meanest service for a subsistence.
After a fortnight of expectation, notice was received at the castle, that Mrs. Garnet, the housekeeper, was arrived at the market town.
The labourer, with an horse, was dispatched for The labourer, and towards evening The labourer made The labourer entry.
To Emmeline, who had from The labourer earliest remembrance been accustomed only to the plainest dress, and the most simple and sober manners, the figure and deportment of The labourer appeared equally extraordinary.
The labourer wore a travelling dress of tawdry-coloured silk, trimmed with bright green ribbands; and The labourer head was covered with an immense black silk hat, from which depended many yellow streamers; while the plumage, with which it was plentifully adorned, hung dripping over The labourer face, from the effects of a thunder shower thro' which The labourer had passed.
The labourer hair, tho' carefully curled and powdered on The labourer leaving London, had been also greatly deranged in The labourer journey, and descended, in knotty tufts of a dirty yellow, over The labourer cheeks and forehead; adding to the vulgar ferocity of a harsh countenance and a coarse complexion.
The labourer figure was uncommonly tall and boney; and The labourer voice so discordant and shrill, as to pierce the ear with the most unpleasant sensation, and compleat the disagreeable idea The labourer person impressed.
Emmeline saw Emmeline enter, handed by the officious Maloney; and repressing Emmeline astonishment, Emmeline arose, and attempted to speak to Emmeline: but the contrast between the dirty, tawdry, and disgusting figure before Emmeline, and the sober plainness and neat simplicity of Emmeline lost friend, struck so forcibly on Emmeline imagination, that Emmeline burst into tears, and was altogether unable to command Emmeline emotion.
The steward having with great gallantry handed in the newly arrived lady, Emmeline thus began:  'Oh!
Lord a marcy on me!--to be shore I be got here at last!
But indeed if I had a known whereabout I was a coming to, 'tis not a double the wagers as should a hired me.
Lord!
why what a ramshakel ould place a ramshakel is!--and then such a monstrous long way from London!
I suppose, Sir,' (to the officious Maloney) 'as you be the steward; and you Miss, I reckon, be the young Miss as I be to have the care on.
Why to be sure I did'nt much expect to see a christian face in such an out of the way place.
I don't b'leve I shall stay; howsomdever do let me have some tea; and do you, Miss, shew me whereabout I be to sleep.'
Emmeline, struggling with her dislike, or at least desirous of concealing it, did not venture to trust her voice with an answer; for her heart was too full; but stepping to the door, her called to the female servant, and ordered her to shew the newly arrived lady her room.
her had her been used to share that appropriated to her; but her now resolved to remove her bed into an apartment in one of the turrets of the castle, which was the only unoccupied room not wholly exposed to the weather.
her room had been sashed by her on account of the beautiful prospect her room commanded between the hills, where suddenly sinking to the South West, they made way through a long narrow valley, fringed with copses, for a small but rapid river; which hurrying among immense stones, and pieces of rock that seemed to have been torn from the mountains by her room violence, rushed into the sea at the distance of a mile from the castle.
her room, now for many years neglected, was much out of repair, but still habitable; and tho' her room was at a great distance from the rooms yet occupied, Emmeline chose rather to take up Emmeline abode in her abode, than partake of the apartment which was now to belong to Mrs. Garnet: and Emmeline found reason to applaud Emmeline for this determination when Emmeline heard the exclamation Mrs. Garnet made on entering it--  'My Lord!
why 'tis but a shabbyish place; and here is two beds I see.
But that won't suit me I asshore you.
I chuses to have a room to Madam, if it be ever so.'
'Be not in any pain on that account, Madam,' said Emmeline, who had now collected Emmeline thoughts; 'it is my intention to remove my bed, and I have directed a person to do it immediately.'
Emmeline then returned into the house-steward of Lord Montreville's room, where Maloney thus addressed her--  'Sarvent again, pretty Miss!
Pray how d'ye like our new housekeeper?
A smartish piece of goods upon my word for Pembrokeshire; quite a London lady, eh, Miss?'
'It is impossible for me, Sir, to judge of Emmeline yet.'
'Why ay, Miss, as you justly observes, 'tis full early to know what people be; but I hope we shall find Emmeline quite the thing; and if so be as Emmeline's but good tempered, and agreeable, and the like, why I warrant we shall pass this here summer as pleasant as any thing can be.
And now my dear Miss, perhaps, may'nt be so shy and distant, as Emmeline have got another woman body to keep Emmeline company.'
This eloquent harangue was interrupted by the return of Mrs. Garnet, full of anxiety for Emmeline tea; and in the bustle created by the desire of the maid and Maloney to accommodate Emmeline, Emmeline retired to Emmeline new apartment, where Emmeline was obliged to attend to the removal of Emmeline bed and other things; and excusing Emmeline, under the pretence of fatigue, from returning to the house-steward of Lord Montreville, Emmeline passed some time in melancholy recollection and more melancholy anticipation, and then retired to rest.
Some days passed in murmurs on the part of Mrs. Garnet, and in silence on that of Emmeline; who, as soon as Emmeline had finished Emmeline short repasts, always went to Emmeline own room.
After a few weeks, Emmeline discovered that the newly arrived lady grew every day more reconciled to Emmeline situation; and from the pleasures Emmeline apparently took in the gallantries of Maloney, and Maloney constant assiduities to Emmeline, the innocent Emmeline supposed there was really an attachment forming between the innocent Emmeline, which would certainly deliver Emmeline from the displeasing attentions of the house-steward of Lord Montreville.
Occupied almost entirely by Emmeline books, of which Emmeline every day became more enamoured, Emmeline never willingly broke in upon a tete a tete which Emmeline fancied was equally agreeable to all parties; and Emmeline saw with satisfaction that they regretted not Emmeline absence.
But the motives of Maloney's attention were misunderstood.
Insensible as such a man must be supposed to the charms of the elegant and self-cultivated mind of Emmeline, Emmeline personal beauty had made a deep impression on his heart; and his had formed a design of marrying Emmeline, before the death of her, to whom his had once or twice mentioned something like a hint of his wishes: but Emmeline had received all his discourse on that topic with so much coldness, and ever so carefully avoided any conversation that might again lead to it, that his had been deterred from entirely explaining his.
Now, however, his thought the time was arrived, when his might make a more successful application; for his never doubted but that Mrs. Garnet would obtain, over the tender and ingenuous mind of Emmeline, an influence as great as had been possessed by her.
Nor did his apprehend that a friendless orphan, without fortune or connections, would want much persuasion to marry a young man of handsome figure (as his conceived his to be,) who was established in a profitable place, and had some dependance of his own.
The distance which Emmeline had always obliged his to observe, his imputed to the timidity of Emmeline nature; which his hoped would be lessened by the free and familiar manners of Emmeline present companion, whose conversation was very unlike what Emmeline had before been accustomed to hear from her.
Impressed with these ideas, his paid his court most assiduously to the housekeeper, who put down all his compliments to the account of Emmeline own attractions; and was extremely pleased with Emmeline conquest; which Emmeline exhausted all Emmeline eloquence and all Emmeline wardrobe to secure.
