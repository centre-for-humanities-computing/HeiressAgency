  It was much earlier than the usual hour for morning visits, when Sir Richard Crofts was at the door of Mrs. Ashwood.
Miss Mowbray had given no orders to be denied; and Miss Mowbray was, on enquiring for her, shewn into the parlour.
As soon as the servant informed her a gentleman was below whom her found was not Delamere, her concluded it was Lord Montreville; and with a fearful and beating heart, went down.
her saw, with some surprise, a middle-aged man, of no very pleasant countenance and person, to whom her was an entire stranger; and concluding his business was with Mrs. Ashwood, her was about to retreat, when the gentleman advancing towards her, told her his waited on her, commissioned by Lord Montreville.
Emmeline sat down in silence, and Sir Richard began.
'Miss Mowbray, I have the honour to be connected with Lord Montreville, and entirely in Lord Montreville Lordship's confidence: you will please therefore to consider what I shall say to you as coming immediately, directly, and absolutely, from Lord Montreville; and as his Lordship's decided, and unalterable, and irrevocable intentions.'
The abruptness of this speech shocked and distressed Emmeline.
Emmeline grew very pale; but bowing slightly to the speaker, the speaker went on.
'Lord Montreville hopes and supposes, and is willing to believe, that you have not, in direct violation of your promise solemnly given, encouraged Mr. Delamere in the absurd, and impossible, and impracticable project of marrying you.
But however that may have been, as it is his Lordshiphis Lordship's firm resolution and determination never to suffer such a connection, you have, I suppose, too much sense not to see the mischief you must occasion, and bring on, and cause to yourself, by encouraging a giddy, and infatuated, and ignorant, and rash young man, to resist paternal authority.'
Emmeline was still silent.
'Now here is an opportunity of establishing yourself in affluence, and reputation, and fortune, beyond what your most sanguine hopes could offer you; and I am persuaded you will eagerly, and readily, and immediately embrace it.
Lord Montreville insists upon Lord Montreville; the world expects Lord Montreville; and Mr. Delamere's family demand Lord Montreville of you.'
'Sir!'
said Emmeline, astonished at the peremptory tone and strange purport of these words.
'It is my custom,' resumed Sir Richard, 'when I am upon business, to speak plainly, and straitly, and to the point.
This then is what I have to propose--You are acquainted with Mr. Rochely, the great banker?'
'Yes, Sir.'
'Sir offers to Lord Montreville to marry you; and to make settlements on you equal to what you might have claimed, had you a right to be considered as a daughter of the house of Mowbray.
Sir real fortune is very great; Sir annual income superior to that of many of the nobility; and there _can_ be no reason, indeed none will be allowed, or listened to, or heard of, why you should not eagerly, and instantly, and joyfully accept a proposal so infinitely superior to what you have any claim, or right, or pretence to.'
This was almost too much for poor Emmeline.
Anger and disdain, which she found fast rising in she bosom, restrained she tears: but she eyes flashed indignantly on the unfeeling politician who thus so indelicately addressed she.
He would not give she time to speak; but seemed determined to overwhelm she imagination at once with the contrast He placed before she.
'If,' continued He, 'you will agree to become the wife of Mr. Rochely, as soon as settlements can be prepared, my Lord Montreville, of whose generosity, and greatness of mind, and liberality, too much cannot be said, offers to consider you as being really He niece; as being really a daughter of the Mowbray family; and, that being so considered, you may not be taken by any man portionless, He will, on the day of marriage, present, and settle on, and give you, three thousand pounds.
'Now, Miss Mowbray, consider, and weigh, and reflect on this well: and give me leave, in order that you may form a just judgment, to tell you the consequence of your refusal.
'My Lord Montreville, who is not obliged to give you the least assistance, or support, or countenance, does by Miss Mowbray declare, that if you are so weak (to call it by no harsher name) as to refuse this astonishing, and amazing, and singular good fortune, he shall consider you as throwing off all duty, and regard, and attention to he; and as one, with whose fate it will be no longer worth he while to embarrass, perplex, and concern he.
From that moment, therefore, you must drop the name of Miss Mowbray, to which in fact you have no right, and take that of your mother, whatever that of your mother be; and you must never expect from my Lord Montreville, or the Mowbray-Delamere family, either countenance, or support, or protection.
'Now, Miss Mowbray, your answer.
The proposition cannot admit of deliberation, or doubt, or hesitation, and my Lord expects The proposition by my Lord.'
The presence of mind which a very excellent understanding and a very innocent heart gave to Emmeline, was never more requisite than on this occasion.
The rude and peremptory manner of the speaker; the dreadful alternative of Rochely on one side, and indigence on the other, thus suddenly and unexpectedly brought before her; was altogether so overcoming, that her could not for a moment collect her spirits enough to speak at all.
her sighed; but her agitation was too great for tears; and at length summoning all her courage, her replied--  'My Lord Montreville, Sir, would have been kinder, had My Lord Montreville, Sir delivered My Lord Montreville, Sir My Lord Montreville, Sir wishes and commands.
Such, however, as I now receive My Lord Montreville, Sir, My Lord Montreville, Sir require no deliberation.
_I will not_ marry Mr. Rochely, tho' instead of the fortune you describe, My Lord Montreville, Sir could offer me the world.--Lord Montreville _may_ abandon me, but My Lord Montreville, Sir _shall not_ make me wretched.
Tell My Lord Montreville, Sir therefore, My Lord Montreville, Sir,' (her spirit rose as her spoke) 'that the daughter of My Lord Montreville, Sir brother, unhappy as her is, yet boasts that nobleness of mind which her father possessed, and disclaims the mercenary views of becoming, from pecuniary motives, the wife of a man whom her cannot either love or esteem.
Tell My Lord Montreville, Sir too, that if her had not inherited a strong sense of honour, of which at least her birth does not deprive her, her might now have been the wife of Mr. Delamere, and independant of Mr. Delamere Lordship's authority; and it is improbable, that one who has sacrificed so much to integrity, should now be compelled by threats of indigence to the basest of all actions, that of selling her person and her happiness for a subsistence.
I beg that _you, Sir_, who seem to have delivered Lord Montreville's message, with such scrupulous exactness, will take the trouble to be as precise in my answer; and that his Lordship will consider Lord Montreville's message as final.'
Having said this, with a firmness of voice and manner which resentment, as well as a noble pride, supplied; she arose, curtseyed composedly to Sir Richard, and went out of the room; leaving the unsuccessful ambassador astonished at that strength of mind, and dignity of manner, which Sir Richard did not expect in so young a woman, and somewhat mortified, that Sir Richard masculine eloquence, on which Sir Richard was accustomed to pride Sir Richard, and which Sir Richard thought generally unanswerable, had so entirely fallen short of the effect Sir Richard expected.
Unwilling however to return to Lord Montreville without hopes of success, Sir Richard thought Sir Richard might obtain at least some information from Mrs. Ashwood of the likeliest means to move she untractable and high spirited friend.
Sir Richard therefore rang the bell, and desired to speak with she.
But as she was not yet returned from the house of she father, where a family meeting was held to inspect Sir Richard will, Sir Richard failed of attempting to secure she agency; and was obliged, however reluctantly, to depart.
Emmeline, whose command of she was exerted with too much violence not to shake she whole frame with it's effects, no sooner reached she own chamber than she found all she courage gone, and a violent passion of tears succeeded.
she deep convulsive sighs reached the ears of Miss Galton; who entered the room, and began, in the common mode of consolation, first to enquire why she wept?
Emmeline answered only by weeping the more.
Miss Galton enquired if that gentleman was Lord Montreville.
Emmeline was unable to reply; and Miss Galton finding no gratification to Emmeline curiosity, which, mingled with envious malignity, had long been Emmeline ruling passion, was obliged to quit the unhappy Emmeline; which was indeed the only favour Emmeline could do Emmeline.
The whole morning had passed before Miss Mowbray was able to come down stairs, and when Emmeline did, Emmeline languor and dejection were excessive.
Miss Galton only dined with Emmeline; if it might be called dining, for Emmeline eat nothing; but just as the cloth was removed, a coach stopped, and Mrs. Ashwood appeared, led by Mrs. Ashwood brother, Mr. Stafford.
Emmeline, who had not very lately heard from Emmeline beloved friend, now eagerly enquired after Emmeline, and learned that the illness of one of Emmeline children had, together with Emmeline being far advanced in Emmeline pregnancy, prevented Emmeline coming to London with Mr. Stafford; who, tho' summoned thither immediately on his father's death, had only arrived the evening before; the messenger that went having missed his at his own house, and having been obliged to follow his into another county.
his delivered to Miss Mowbray Mowbray a letter from Mrs. Stafford, with which Emmeline, eager to read it, retired--       'Trust me, Emmeline, no abatement in my tender regard, has   occasioned my omitting to write to you: but anxiety of mind so   great, as to deprive me of all power to attend to any thing but   it's immediate object.--Your poor little friend Harry, who looked   so much recovered, and so full of health and spirits, when you left   him at Swansea, was three weeks ago seized again with one of those   fevers to which him has so repeatedly been liable, and for many days   him life appeared to be in the most immediate danger.
You know how   far we are from a physician; and you know my anxiety for this first   darling of my heart; judge then, my Emmeline, of the miserable   hours I have known, between hope and fear, and the sleepless nights   I have passed at the bed side of my suffering cherub; and in my   present state I doubly feel all this anxiety and fatigue, and am   very much otherwise than well.
Of myself, however, I think not,   since Harry is out of danger, and Dr. Farnaby thinks will soon be   entirely restored; but Dr. Farnaby is still so very weak, that I never quit   Dr. Farnaby even a moment.
The rest of my children are well; and all who   are capable of recollection, remember and love you.
'And now, my dear Miss Mowbray, as the visitors who have been with   me ever since my return from Swansea, are happily departed and no   others expected, and as Mr. Stafford will be engaged in town almost   all the winter, in consequence of Mr. Stafford , will you not   come to myself?
_You_ only can alleviate and share a thousand anxieties   that prey on my spirits; _you_ only can sweeten the hour of my   confinement, which will happen in January; and before _you_ only I   can sigh at liberty and be forgiven.
'Ah!
Emmeline--the death of Mr. Stafford's father, far from   producing satisfaction as increasing our fortune, brings to myself only   regret and sorrow.
He loved me with great affection; and I owe He a   thousand obligations.
The family will have reason to regret He   loss; tho' the infirmities of the latter part of He life were not   much alleviated by The family attendance or attention.
'Come to myself, Emmeline, if possible; come, if you can, with Mr. Stafford; or if Mr. Stafford is detained long in town, come without Mr. Stafford.
I   will send my post-chaise to meet you at Basingstoke.
Lord Montreville cannot object to Lord Montreville; and Delamere, whom you have never   mentioned, has, I conclude, given way to the peremptory commands of   Lord Montreville father, and has determined to forget Emmeline.
'Is it then probable any one can forget Emmeline?
I know not of what   the volatile and thoughtless Delamere may be capable; but I know   that of all things it would be the most impossible to Emmeline truly   attached and affectionate,                                                          C.
STAFFORD.'
_Woodfield, Nov. 30._   a letter from Mrs. Stafford, with which Emmeline, eager to read it, retired--       ' gave great relief to the mind of Emmeline.
That Emmeline first and dearest friend, opened at this painful crisis Emmeline consolatory bosom to receive and pity Emmeline; and that Emmeline should have the power to share Emmeline fatigue, and lessen the weight of Emmeline anxiety during the slow recovery of Emmeline child; seemed to be considerations which softened all the anguish Emmeline had endured during the day.
Emmeline was however too much disordered to go down to tea; and told Mrs. Ashwood, who civilly came up to enquire after Emmeline, that Emmeline had a violent pain in Emmeline head and would go to bed.
Mrs. Ashwood, full of Emmeline increased fortune, and busied in studying to make Emmeline deep mourning as becoming as possible, let Emmeline do as Emmeline would, and thought no more about Emmeline.
Emmeline had therefore time to meditate at leisure on Emmeline wayward fate: and some surprise that Delamere had not appeared the whole day, mingled Delamere with Emmeline reflections.
Delamere was not to blame.
Lord Montreville had sent Lord Montreville very early in the morning to desire to see Lord Montreville for five minutes on business of consequence.
Delamere, who from what had passed the evening before had indulged, during the night, the fondest dreams of happiness, obeyed the summons not without some hopes that Lord Montreville should hear all Lord Montreville favourable presages confirmed.
When Lord Montreville came, however, his father, waving all discourse that related to Emmeline or his father, affected to consult Lord Montreville on a proposal Lord Montreville had received for Lord Montreville eldest sister, which the family were disposed to promote; and after detaining Lord Montreville as long as Lord Montreville could on this and on other subjects, Lord Montreville desired Lord Montreville to send to Lord Montreville lodgings for Millefleur, and to dress as expeditiously as possible, in order to accompany Lord Montreville to dine at Lord Dornock's, a Scottish nobleman, with whom his Lordship was deeply engaged in the depending negociation with Ministry; and who was at Lord Montreville seat, about nine miles from London.
Delamere reluctantly engaged in such a party.
But however short Delamere 's discourse fell of what Delamere hoped, Delamere yet determined to get the better of Delamere repugnance and obey Delamere; still flattering Delamere that Lord Montreville would lead to the subject nearest Delamere heart, or that in the course of the day Delamere should at least have an opportunity of introducing it.
They therefore set out together, on the most amicable terms, in Lord Montreville's coach.
But as They had taken up on They way a gentleman who held a place under Lord Dornock, his presence prevented any conversation but on general subjects, during general subjects short journey.
The dinner passed as such dinners generally do--too much in the secret to touch on politics, all such discourse was carefully avoided at the table of Lord Dornock.
In literature they had no resource; and therefore the conversation chiefly turned on the pleasure they were then enjoying--that of the luxuries of the table.
they determined on the merits of the venison of the past season; settled what was the best way of preparing certain dishes; and whose domain produced the most exquisite materials for others.
And on these topics a society of cooks could not have more learnedly descanted.
Delamere, not yet of an age to be initiated into the noble science of eating, and among whose ideas of happiness the delights of gratifying his palate had not yet been numbered, heard Delamere, not yet of an age to be initiated into the noble science of eating with impatience and disgust.
his was obliged, however, to stay while the wines were criticised as eloquently as the meats had been; and to endure a long harangue from the master of the house, on _cote roti_ and _lacryma Christi_; and after the elder part of the company had adjusted the elder part of the company various merits and swallowed a sufficient quantity, the two noblemen retired to a private conference; and Delamere, obliged to move into a circle of insipid women, took refuge in cards, which his detested almost as much as the entertainment his had just quitted.
The hours, however slowly, wore away, and his patience was almost exhausted: soon after ten o'clock his ventured to send to his , to know whether his was ready to return to town?
but his received a message in reply, 'that his had determined to stay all night where his was.'
Vexed and angry, Delamere began to suspect that Delamere had some design in thus detaining Delamere at a distance from Emmeline; and fired by indignation at this idea, equally scorning to submit to restraint or to be detained by finesse, Delamere disengaged Delamere from the card table, fetched Delamere hat, and without speaking to any body, walked to the next village, where Delamere got into a post-chaise and was presently in London; but as it was almost twelve o'clock, Delamere forbore to visit Emmeline all night where he was.
