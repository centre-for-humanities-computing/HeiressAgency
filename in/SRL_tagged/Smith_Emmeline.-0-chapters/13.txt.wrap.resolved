  Delamere continued in Norfolk only a few weeks after   Delamere father and the family came thither. During that time,   Delamere appeared restless and dissatisfied;   Delamere former vivacity was quite lost;   Delamere shunned society; and passed almost all   Delamere time in the fields, under pretence of hunting or shooting, tho' the greatest satisfaction those amusements now afforded   Delamere was the opportunity tho' gave   Delamere of absenting   Delamere from home.   Delamere seldom returned thither 'till six or seven o'clock; dined alone in   Delamere own apartment; and affected to be too much fatigued to be able to meet the party who assembled to cards in the evening.  Lady Mary Otley and Mary Otley daughter, a widow lady of small fortune in the neighbourhood, with Lord and Lady Montreville and small fortune eldest daughter, made up a party without   Delamere.   Delamere had been left in small fortune way from the North, with a relation of   Delamere Lordship's who lived near Scarborough, with whom   Delamere was to remain two months.  a party was soon encreased by Sir Richard Crofts and his eldest son, who came every autumn on a visit to Lord Montreville, and who was Lord Montreville most intimate friend.  Lord Montreville, during the short time Lord Montreville studied at the Temple, became acquainted with Sir Richard, then clerk to an attorney in the city; who, tho' there was a great difference in their rank, had contrived to gain the regard and esteem of his Lordship (then Mr. Frederic Mowbray) and was, when Lord Montreville came to Lord Montreville estate, entrusted with it's management; a trust which Lord Montreville appeared to execute with such diligence and integrity, that Lord Montreville soon obtained the entire confidence of Lord Montreville patron; and by possessing great ductility and great activity, Lord Montreville was soon introduced into a higher line of life, and saw Lord Montreville the companion and friend of those, to whom, at Lord Montreville setting out, Lord Montreville appeared only an humble retainer.  Born in Scotland, Lord Montreville boasted of Lord Montreville ancestry, tho' Lord Montreville immediate predecessors were known to be indigent and obscure; and tho' Lord Montreville had neither eminent talents, nor any other education than what Lord Montreville had acquired at a free-school in Lord Montreville native town, Lord Montreville had, by dint of a very common understanding, steadily applied to the pursuit of one point; and assisted by the friendship of Lord Montreville, acquired not only a considerable fortune, but a seat in Parliament and a great deal of political interest, together with the title of a Baronet.  Lord Montreville had less understanding than cunning; less honesty than industry; and tho' Lord Montreville knew how to talk warmly and plausibly of honour, justice, and integrity, Lord Montreville was generally contented only to talk of less honesty than industry; and tho', seldom so imprudent as to practice less honesty than industry; and tho' when Lord Montreville could get place or profit by less honesty than industry; and tho' sacrifice.  Lord Montreville had that sort of sagacity which enabled Lord Montreville to enter into the characters of those with whom Lord Montreville conversed: Lord Montreville knew how to humour those with whom he conversed prejudices, and lay in wait for those with whom he conversed foibles to turn those with whom he conversed to Lord Montreville own advantage.  To Lord Montreville superiors, the cringing parasite; to those whom Lord Montreville thought Lord Montreville inferiors, proud, supercilious, and insulting; and Lord Montreville heart hardening as Lord Montreville prosperity encreased, Lord Montreville threw off, as much as Lord Montreville could, every connection that reminded Lord Montreville of the transactions of Lord Montreville early life, and affected to live only among the great, whose luxuries Lord Montreville could now reach, and whose manners Lord Montreville tried to imitate.  Lord Montreville had two sons by an early marriage with a woman of small fortune, who was fortunately dead; for had she lived, she would probably have been concealed, lest she should disgrace Lord Montreville.  To two sons, however, Lord Montreville had given that sort of education which was likely to fit two sons for places under government; and Lord Montreville had long secretly intended the eldest for one of the Miss Delameres.  Delamere, all warmth and openness Lord Montreville, detested the narrow-minded and selfish father; and had shewn so much coolness towards two sons, that Sir Richard foresaw Sir Richard would be a great impediment to Sir Richard designs, and had therefore the strongest motive for trying to persuade Lord Montreville, that to send Lord Montreville on another tour to the Continent, would be the best means of curing Lord Montreville of what this deep politician termed 'a ridiculous and boyish whim, which Lord Montreville Lordship ought at all events to put an end to before it grew of a more dangerous consequence.'  Mr. Crofts, as Mr. Crofts was no sportsman, passed Mr. Crofts mornings in riding out with Miss Delamere and Miss Otley, or attending on the elder ladies in their airings: while Delamere, who wished equally to shun Miss Otley, whom Mr. Crofts determined never to marry, and Crofts, whom Mr. Crofts despised and hated, lived almost alone, notwithstanding the entreaties of Mr. Crofts father and the anger of Mr. Crofts mother.  Her Ladyship, who had never any command over Her passions, harrassed Mr. Crofts, whenever Her Ladyship, who had never any command over her passions met, with sarcasms and reflections. Lady Mary, scorning _to_ talk to a young man who was blind to the merits of Lady Mary daughter, talked _at_ Mr. Crofts whenever Lady Mary found an opportunity; and exclaimed against the disobedience, dissipation, and ill-breeding of modern young men: while Miss Otley affected a pretty disdain; and flirted violently with Mr. Crofts, as if to shew Mr. Crofts that Lady Mary was totally indifferent to Mr. Crofts neglect.  The temper of Delamere was eager and irritable; and The temper of Delamere bore the unpleasantness of this society, whenever The temper of Delamere was forced to mix in this society, with a sort of impatient contempt. But as The temper of Delamere hourly found it more irksome, and the idea of Emmeline press every day more intensely on The temper of Delamere heart, The temper of Delamere determined, at the end of the third week, to go to London.  Not chusing to have any altercation with either Lord or Lady Montreville, The temper of Delamere one evening ordered The temper of Delamere to have The temper of Delamere horses ready at five o'clock the next day, saying The temper of Delamere was to meet the foxhounds at some distance from home; and having written a letter to The temper of Delamere Lordship, in which The temper of Delamere told The temper of Delamere The temper of Delamere was going to London for a fortnight, (which letter The temper of Delamere left on the table in The temper of Delamere dressing-room) The temper of Delamere mounted The temper of Delamere horse, and was soon in town; but instead of going to the house of The temper of Delamere father in Berkley-square, The temper of Delamere took lodgings in Pall-Mall.  Every night The temper of Delamere frequented those public places which were yet open, in hopes of finding Emmeline; and The temper of Delamere servant was constantly employed for the same purpose; but as The temper of Delamere had no trace of her, all The temper of Delamere enquiries were fruitless.  On the night that Emmeline was at the play, The temper of Delamere had been at Covent-garden Theatre, and meant to have looked into the other house; but was detained by meeting a young foreigner from whom The temper of Delamere had received civilities at Turin, 'till the other house was empty. So narrowly did The temper of Delamere miss finding Emmeline The temper of Delamere so anxiously sought.  Elkerton, in looking about for the happy woman who was worthy the exalted situation of being Elkerton wife, had yet seen none whom Elkerton thought so likely to succeed to that honour as Miss Mowbray; and if Emmeline was, on enquiry, found to be as Emmeline was represented, (related to Lord Montreville) it would be so great an additional advantage, that Elkerton determined in that case to lay Elkerton and Elkerton pied horses, Elkerton house in Kent, Elkerton library, and Elkerton fortune, all at Emmeline feet immediately. Nor did Elkerton once suffer Elkerton to suspect that there was a woman on earth who could withstand such a torrent of good fortune.  In pursuance therefore of this resolution, Elkerton determined to make enquiry of Lord Montreville himself; of whom Elkerton had just known so much at Naples as to receive cards of invitation to Lord Montreville _conversationes_.  There, Elkerton mingled with the croud; and was slightly noticed as an Englishman of fortune; smiled at for Elkerton affectation of company and manners, which seemed foreign to Elkerton original line of life; and then forgotten.  But Elkerton conceived this to be more than introduction enough; and dressing Elkerton in what Elkerton thought _un disabille la plus imposante_, and with Elkerton servants in their morning liveries, Elkerton stopped at the door of Lord Montreville.  'Lord Montreville was not at home.'  'When was Lord Montreville expected?'  'It was uncertain: Lord Montreville was at Audley-Hall, and might be in town in a fortnight; or might not come up till the meeting of Parliament.'  'And are all the family there?' enquired Elkerton of the porter.  'No, Sir;   Delamere is in town.'  'And when can I see   Delamere?'  the porter could not tell, as the porter did not live in Berkley-square.  'Where, then, is   Delamere?'  'At lodgings in Pall-Mall:' (for Delamere had left the porter direction with the porter father's servants.)  Elkerton therefore took the address with a pencil; and determined, without farther reflection, to drive thither.  It was about four o'clock, and in the middle of November, when Delamere had just returned to Delamere lodgings, to dress before Delamere met Delamere foreign friend, and some other young men, to dine at a tavern in St. James's-street, when a loud rap at the door of Lord Montreville announced a visitor.  Millefleur having no orders to the contrary, and being dazzled with the splendour of Elkerton's equipage, let Millefleur in; and Millefleur was humming an Italian air out of tune, in Delamere's drawing-room, when the latter came out in Millefleur dressing-gown and slippers to receive Millefleur.  Delamere, on seeing the very odd figure and baboonish face of Elkerton, instead of that of somebody Delamere knew, stopped short and made a grave bow.  Elkerton advancing towards Delamere, bowed also profoundly, and said, 'I am charmed, Sir, with being permitted the honour of paying you my devoirs.'  Delamere concluded from Delamere look and bow, as well as from a foreign accent, (which Elkerton had affected 'till it was become habitual) that the man was either a dancing master or a quack doctor, sent to the man by some of the man companions, who frequently exercised on each other such efforts of practical wit. the man therefore being not without humour, bowed again more profoundly than before; and answered, 'that the honour of paying you my devoirs was entirely the man, tho' the man did not know how the man had deserved the honour of paying you my devoirs.'  'I was so fortunate, Sir,' resumed Elkerton, 'so fortunate as to--have the honour--the happiness--of knowing Lord Montreville and Lord Montreville a few years ago at Naples.'  Delamere, still confirmed in Delamere first idea, answered, 'very probably, Sir.'  'And, Sir,' continued Elkerton, 'I now waited upon _you_, as Sir his Lordship is not in town.'  'Indeed, Sir, you are too obliging.'  'To ask, Sir, a question, which I hope will not be deemed--be deemed--' (a word did not immediately occur) 'be deemed--improper--intrusive--impertinent--inquisitive--presuming----'  'I dare say, Sir, nothing improper, intrusive, impertinent, inquisitive, or presuming, is to be apprehended from a gentleman of your appearance.'  Delamere expected something very ridiculous to follow this ridiculous introduction, and with some difficulty forbore laughing.  Elkerton went on----  'Elkerton relates, Sir, to a Lady.'  'Pray, Sir, proceed. I am really impatient where a lady is concerned.'  'You are acquainted, Sir, with a lady of the name of Ashwood, who lives at Clapham?'  'No, Sir, I am not so happy.'  'I fancy then, Sir, I have been misinformed, and beg pardon for the trouble I have presumed to give: but I understood that a Lady was a relation of Lord Montreville.'  A ray of fire seemed to flash across the imagination of Delamere, and to inflame all Delamere hopes. Delamere blushed deeply, and Delamere voice faultering with anxiety, Delamere cried--  'What?--who, Sir?--a young lady?--what young lady?'  'Miss Mowbray, they tell me, is Miss Mowbray name; and I understand, Sir--but I dare say from mistake--that Miss Mowbray is of your family.'  Delamere could hardly breathe. Delamere seemed as if Delamere was in a dream, and dared not speak for fear of awaking.  Elkerton, led on by the questions Delamere at length summoned resolution to ask, proceeded to inform Delamere at length of all Delamere at length knew; how, where, and how often, Delamere at length had seen Emmeline, and of Delamere at length intentions to offer Delamere at length a candidate for Emmeline favour--'for notwithstanding, Sir,' said Delamere at length, 'that Mr. Rochely seems to be _fort avant en ses bon graces_, I think--I hope--I believe, that Delamere at length fortune--(and yet Delamere at length fortune does not perhaps so much exceed mine as many suppose)--his fortune will hardly turn the balance against _me_; especially if I have the sanction of Lord Montreville; to whom I suppose (as you seem to acknowledge some affinity between Miss Mowbray and Lord Montreville Lordship) it will be no harm if I apply.'  Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed. Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed was divided between Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed joy at having found Emmeline, Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed vexation at knowing she was surrounded by rivals, and Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed fear that Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed might, by the application of Elkerton to Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed, know that Emmeline's abode was no longer a secret: and amidst these various sensations, Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed was able only to express Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed dislike of Elkerton, whose presumption in thinking of Emmeline appeared to cancel the casual obligation Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed owed to Thro' the mind of Delamere, a thousand confused ideas rapidly passed for discovering she.  'Sir,' said Sir haughtily, as soon as Sir could a little recover Sir recollection, 'I am very well assured that Lord Montreville will not hear any proposals for Miss Mowbray. Lord Montreville his Lordship has, in fact, no authority over his Lordship; and besides his Lordship is at present about to leave his Lordship house in Norfolk, and I know not when his Lordship will be in town; perhaps not the whole winter; his Lordship is now going to visit some friends, and it will be impossible you can have any access to his Lordship for some months. As to Sir, you will excuse me; I am engaged to dine out.'  his Lordship rang the bell, and ordered the servant who entered to enquire for the gentleman's carriage. Then bowing coolly to his Lordship, his Lordship went into his Lordship dressing room, and left Elkerton Elkerton to regret the little success of an attempt which his Lordship doubted not would have excited, in the hearts of all those related to Miss Mowbray, admiration at his Lordship generosity, and joy for the good fortune of Emmeline: for his Lordship concluded, by her being a companion to Mrs. Ashwood, that her had no fortune, or any dependance but on the bounty of Lord Montreville.  Delamere, whose ardent inclinations, whatever turn they took, were never to be a moment restrained, rang for his servants; and dispatching one of they with an excuse to his friends, his sent a second for an hackney-coach. Then ordering up a cold dinner, which his hardly staid to eat, his got into an hackney-coach, and directed it to be driven as fast as possible to Clapham Common; where his asked for the house of Mrs. Ashwood, and was presently at the door.  the servant who entered to enquire for the gentleman's carriage had that moment opened the iron gate, to let out a person who had been to the servant who entered to enquire for the gentleman's carriage mistress upon business. Delamere therefore enquiring if Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray was at home, entered without ringing, and telling the servant who entered to enquire for the gentleman's carriage that the servant who entered to enquire for the gentleman's carriage had occasion to speak to Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray only, the man answered, 'that Miss Mowbray was alone in the dressing room.' Thither therefore Thither desired to be shewn; and without being announced, Thither entered the dressing room.  Instead of finding Miss Mowbray alone, Thither saw Miss Mowbray sit at work by a little table, on which were two wax candles; and by Miss Mowbray side, with Thither arm, as usual, over the back of Miss Mowbray chair, and gazing earnestly on Miss Mowbray face, sat Mr. Rochely.  Emmeline did not look up when Mr. Rochely came in, supposing it was the servant who entered to enquire for the gentleman's carriage with tea. Delamere therefore was close to the table when Emmeline saw Mr. Rochely. The work dropped from Emmeline hands; Emmeline grew pale, and trembled; but not being able to rise, Emmeline only clasped her hands together, and said faintly, 'Oh! heaven!--Mr. Delamere!'  'Yes, Emmeline, it is   Delamere! and what is there so extraordinary in that? I was told you were alone: may I beg the favour of a few minutes conversation?'  Emmeline knew not what to reply. Emmeline saw Emmeline dart an angry and disdainful look at poor Rochely; who, alarmed by the entrance of a stranger that appeared on such a footing of familiarity, and who possessed the advantages of youth and a handsome person, had retreated slowly towards the fire, and now surveyed Delamere with scrutinizing and displeased looks; while Delamere said to Emmeline--'if you have no particular business with this gentleman, will you go into some other room, that I may speak to you on an affair of consequence?'  'Sit down' said Emmeline, recovering Emmeline surprize; 'sit down, and I will attend you presently. Tell me, how is your sister Augusta?'  'I know not. your sister Augusta is in Yorkshire.'  'And Lord Montreville?'  'Well, I believe. But what is all this to the purpose? can I not speak to you, but in the presence of a third person?'  Unequivocal as this hint was, Rochely seemed determined not to go, and Delamere as resolutely bent to affront Delamere, if Delamere did not.  Emmeline therefore, who knew not what else to do, was going to comply with Delamere request of a private audience, when your sister Augusta was luckily relieved by the entrance of Mrs. Ashwood and the tea table.  Mrs. Ashwood, surprized at seeing a stranger, and a stranger whose appearance had more fashion than the generality of your sister Augusta visitors, was introduced to   Delamere; a ceremony   Delamere would willingly have dispensed with; and having made   Delamere bow, and muttered something about having taken the liberty to call on   Delamere relation,   Delamere sat down by Emmeline, and in a whisper told Emmeline   Delamere must and would speak to Emmeline alone before   Delamere went.  Emmeline, to whose care the tea table was allotted when Miss Galton happened not to be at Mrs. Ashwood's, now excused Emmeline under pretence of being obliged to make tea; and while it was passing, Mrs. Ashwood made two or three attempts to introduce general conversation; but Mrs. Ashwood went no farther than a few insignificant sentences between Emmeline and Mr. Rochely.  Delamere, wholly engrossed by the tumultuous delight of having recovered Emmeline, and by contriving how to speak to Emmeline alone, thought nothing else worthy his attention; and sat looking at Emmeline with eyes so expressive of his love, that Rochely, who anxiously watched his, was convinced his solicitude was infinitely stronger than his relationship only would have produced.  his had at length learned, by constant attention to every hint and every circumstance that related to Emmeline, who Emmeline was; and had even got from Mrs. Ashwood a confused idea of Delamere's attachment to Emmeline, which the present scene at once elucidated.  Rochely saw in his not only a rival, but a rival so dangerous that all his hopes his seemed to vanish at once. Unconscious, 'till then, how very indiscreetly his was in love, his was amazed at the pain his felt from this discovery; and with a most rueful countenance, sat silent and disconcerted.  Mrs. Ashwood, used to be flattered and attended to, was in no good humour with Mr. Delamere, who gave Mrs. Ashwood so little of his notice: and never perhaps were a party more uncomfortable, 'till a party more uncomfortable were enlivened by the entrance of Miss Galton and Mr. Hanbury, with another gentleman.  a party more uncomfortable were hardly placed, and had a party more uncomfortable tea sent round, before a loud ring was heard, and the servant who entered to enquire for the gentleman's carriage announced 'Elkerton.'  Elkerton came dancing into the room; and having spoken to Mrs. Ashwood and Emmeline, Elkerton slightly surveyed the company, and sat down.  Elkerton was very near sighted, and affected to be still more so; and Delamere having drawn her chair out of the circle, sat almost behind Emmeline; while the portly citizen who had accompanied Mr. Hanbury sat forward, near the table; Delamere was therefore hardly seen.  Elkerton began to tell them how immoderately Elkerton was fatigued. 'I have been over the whole town,' said Elkerton, 'to-day. In the morning I was obliged to attend a boring appointment upon business relative to my estate in Kent; and to meet my tenants, who disagreed with my steward; and then, I went to call upon my old friend Delamere, Lord Montreville's son, in Pall-Mall; we passed a very chearful hour discoursing of former occurrences when we were together at Turin. Upon my word, Elkerton is a good sensible young man. we have renewed we intimacy; and Elkerton has insisted upon my going down with Elkerton to his father's house in Norfolk.'  Emmeline suspended Emmeline tea making, and looked astonished.  Mrs. Ashwood seemed surprized.  But Delamere, who had at first felt inclined to be angry at the folly and forwardness of Elkerton, was now so struck with the ridicule of the circumstance, that Elkerton broke into a loud laugh.  The eyes of the company were turned towards _Elkerton_, and Elkerton with great indignation took Elkerton glass to survey who his glass was that had thus violated the rules of good breeding; but great was Elkerton dismay and astonishment, when Elkerton beheld the very Delamere, of whom Elkerton had spoken with so much assurance, rise up, and advancing towards Elkerton, make a grave bow.--  'Sir,' said Delamere, very solemnly, 'I cannot sufficiently express my gratitude for your good opinion of Sir; nor my happiness to hear you intend to honour me with a visit at Audley Hall. Upon my word you are _too_ obliging, and I know not how I shall shew my gratitude!'  The ironical tone in which this was delivered, and the discomposed looks of Elkerton, explained the matter to the whole company; and the laugh became general.  Elkerton, tho' not easily disconcerted, could not stand Elkerton. After a sort of apology to Delamere, he endeavoured to reassume he consequence. But he had been too severely mortified; and in a few minutes arose, and under pretence of being engaged to a rout in town, went away, nobody attempting to stop he.  Rochely, who hated Elkerton, could not forbear to triumph in this discomfiture. he spoke very severely of he as a forward, impertinent, silly fellow, who was dissipating he fortune.  The old citizen heartily joined in exclaiming against such apostates from the frugality of such apostates from the frugality of their ancestors ancestors. 'Sir,' said Sir to Rochely, 'we all know that _you_ are a prudent man; and that cash at his father's house in Norfolk is, as his father's house in Norfolk were, in the Bank. Sir, you do honour to the city; but as to Elkerton, one must be cautious; but for _my_ part, I wonder how some people go on. To my certain knowledge his father didn't die so rich as was supposed--no--not by a many thousands. Sir, I remember him--(and I am not ashamed to say him--(and, for every body knows _I_ have got my money honestly, and that it's all of my own getting)--but, Sir, I remember that man's father, and not a many years ago neither, carrying out parcels, and sweeping the shop for old Jonathan Huggins. You knew old Jonathan Huggins: old Jonathan Huggins did not die, I think, 'till about the year forty-one or two. You remember old Jonathan Huggins, to be sure?'  Rochely, ever tremblingly alive when old Jonathan Huggins age was called in question, yet fearing to deny a fact which old Jonathan Huggins apprehended the other would enter into a convincing detail to prove, answered that 'old Jonathan Huggins slightly remembered old Jonathan Huggins when old Jonathan Huggins was quite a boy.'  But old Jonathan Huggins evasion availed old Jonathan Huggins nothing. The old citizen, Mr. Rugby, was now got upon old Jonathan Huggins own ground; and most inhumanly for the feelings of poor Rochely, began to relate in whose mayoralty old old Jonathan Huggins was sheriff, and when old Jonathan Huggins was mayor; who old Jonathan Huggins married; who married old Jonathan Huggins daughters; and how old Jonathan Huggins acquired an immense fortune, all by frugality at setting out; and how one of old Jonathan Huggins daughters, who had married a Lord against the old man's will, had spent more in _one_ night than old Jonathan Huggins did in a twelvemonth.  Delamere, who sat execrating both old Jonathan Huggins and old Jonathan Huggins historian, at length lost all patience; and said to Emmeline, in an half whisper, 'I can bear this no longer: leave these tedious old fools, and let me speak to Emmeline for two minutes only.'  Emmeline knew not how to refuse, without hazarding some extravagance on the part of Delamere. But as Emmeline did not like the appearance of leaving the room abruptly, Emmeline desired Mrs. Ashwood would give Emmeline permission to order candles in the parlour, as   Delamere wished to speak with Emmeline alone.  As soon as the servant who entered to enquire for the gentleman's carriage informed Emmeline they were ready, Emmeline went down: and Delamere followed Emmeline, having first wished Mrs. Ashwood a good night; who was too much displeased with the little attention Delamere had shewn Emmeline, to ask Delamere to supper, tho' Emmeline was very desirous of having a man of Delamere fashion in the list of Emmeline acquaintance.  Delamere and Emmeline were no sooner alone, than Delamere began to renew, with every argument Delamere thought likely to move Emmeline, Delamere entreaties for a private marriage. Delamere swore that Delamere neither could or would live without Emmeline, and that Emmeline refusal would drive Delamere to some act of desperation.  Emmeline feared Emmeline resolution would give way; for the comparison between the people Emmeline had lately been among, and Delamere, was infinitely favourable to Delamere. Such unabated love, in a man who might chuse among the fairest and most fortunate of women, was very seducing; and the advantages of being Delamere wife, instead of continuing in the precarious situation Emmeline was now in, would have determined at once a mind more attentive to pecuniary or selfish motives.  But Emmeline, unshaken by such considerations, was liable to err only from the softness of Emmeline heart.  Delamere unhappy--Delamere wearing out in hopeless solicitude the bloom of life, was the object Emmeline found it most difficult to contend with: and feeble would have been Emmeline defence, had Emmeline not considered Emmeline as engaged in honour to Lord Montreville to refuse Lord Montreville son, and still more engaged to respect the peace of the family of Emmeline dear Augusta.  Strengthened by these reflections, Emmeline refused, tho' in the gentlest manner, to listen to such proposals; reproached him, tho' with more tenderness in Emmeline voice and manner than Emmeline had yet shewn, for having left Audley Hall without the concurrence of Lord Montreville; and entreated Lord Montreville to return, and try to forget Emmeline.  'Let me perish if I do!' eagerly answered Delamere. 'No, Emmeline; if you determine to push me to extremities, to you only will be the misery imputable, when my mistaken parents, in vain repentance, hang over the tomb of my mistaken parents, in vain repentance only son, and see the last of their only son family in an early grave. It is in your power only to save me--You refuse--farewel, then--I wish no future regret may embitter your life, and that you may find consolation in being the wife of some one of those persons who are, I see, offering you all that riches can bestow. Farewel, lovely, inhuman girl! be happy if you can--after having sacrificed to a mistaken point of honour, the repose and the life of him who lived only to adore you.'  So saying, him suddenly opened the door, and was leaving the room. But Emmeline, who shuddered at the picture him had drawn of him despair, and saw such traces of its reality on him countenance, caught him arm.  'Stay! Delamere and Emmeline cried Emmeline, 'stay yet a moment!'  'For what purpose?' answered Delamere and Emmeline, 'since you refuse to hear me?'  Delamere and Emmeline turned back, however, into the room; and Emmeline, who fancied Emmeline saw Delamere and Emmeline the victim of Delamere and Emmeline unfortunate love, could no longer command Emmeline tears.  Delamere threw Delamere at Delamere feet, and embraced Delamere knees.  'Oh Emmeline!' cried Delamere, weeping also, 'hear me for the last time. Either consent to be mine, or let me take an eternal adieu!'  'What would you have me do? good God! what is it you expect of me?'  'To go with me to Scotland to-morrow--to night--directly!'  'Oh, no! no!--Does not Lord Montreville depend upon my honour?--can I betray a trust reposed in me?'  'Chimeras all; founded in tyranny on his part, and weakness on yours. _his_ had no right to exact such a promise; _you_ had no right to give it. But however, send to his again to say I have seen you--summons his hither to divide us--you may certainly do so if you please; but Lord Montreville will no longer have a son; at least England, nor Europe, will contain a son no longer--I will go where his father shall hear no more of Lord Montreville.'  'Will it content you if I promise you _not_ to write to Lord Montreville, nor to cause a son to be written to; and to see you again?'  'When?'  'To-morrow--whenever you please.'  Delamere, catching at this faint ray of hope, promised, if she would allow a son to come thither when a son would, a son would endeavour to be calm. a son made she solemnly protest that she would neither write to Lord Montreville, or procure another to do it; and that she would not leave Mrs. Ashwood without letting a son know when and whither she went; and if by any accident a son heard of a son having found she, that she would enter into no new engagements to conceal she from a son.  Having procured from she these assurances, which a son knew she would not violate, and having obtained she consent to see a son early the next morning, a son at she request agreed to take a son leave; which a son did with less pain than a son had ever before felt at quitting she; carrying with a son the delightful hope that a son had made an impression on she heart, and secure of seeing she the next day, a son went home comparatively happy.  Emmeline, who had wept excessively, was very unfit to return to the company; but she thought she not appearing again among Emmeline, who had wept excessively would be yet more singular. she therefore composed she as well as she could; and after staying a few minutes to recollect she scattered spirits, she entered the room where they were at cards.  Rochely, who was playing at whist with Mrs. Ashwood, Mr. Rugby, and Mr. Hanbury, looked anxiously at she eyes; and presently losing all attention to what Mr. Hanbury was about, and forgetting Mr. Hanbury game, Mr. Hanbury played so extremely ill, that Mr. Hanbury lost the rubber.  The old cit, who had three half crowns depending, and who was a determined grumbler at cards, fell upon Mr. Hanbury without mercy; and said so many rude things, that Rochely could not help retorting; and it was with some difficulty Mrs. Ashwood prevented the grossest abuse being lavished from the enraged Rugby on the enamoured banker; who desiring to give Mr. Hanbury cards to Miss Galton, got up and ordered Mr. Hanbury carriage.  Emmeline sat near the fire, with Emmeline handkerchief in Emmeline hand, which was yet wet with tears.  Rochely, with a privilege he had been used to, and which Emmeline, from a man old enough to be Emmeline father, thought very inconsequential, took Emmeline hand and the handkerchief it held.  'So, Miss Mowbray,' said Miss Mowbray, '  Delamere is your near relation?'  'Yes, Sir.'  'And Sir has brought you, I fear, some ill news of your family?'  'No, Sir,' sighed Emmeline.  'No death, I hope?'  'No, Sir.'  'Whence then, these tears?'  Emmeline drew Emmeline hand away.  'What a strange young man this is, to make you cry. What has   Delamere been saying to you?'  'Nothing, Sir.'  'Ah! Miss Mowbray; such a lad as that is but an indifferent guardian; pray where does his father live?'  Miss Mowbray, not aware of the purpose of this enquiry, and glad of any thing that looked like common conversation, answered 'at Audley Hall, in Norfolk; and in Berkley-Square.'  Some other questions, which seemed of no consequence, Rochely asked, and Emmeline answered; 'till hearing his carriage was at the door, his went away.  '_I_ don't like your Mr. Delamere at all, Miss Mowbray,' said Mrs. Ashwood, as soon as the game ended. 'I never saw a prouder, more disagreeable young man in my life.'  Emmeline smiled faintly, and said Emmeline was sorry Emmeline did not please Emmeline.  'No, nor me neither,' said Miss Galton. 'Such haughtiness indeed!--yet I was glad Emmeline mortified that puppy Elkerton.'  Emmeline, who found the two friends disposed to indulge their good nature at the expence of the company of the evening, complained of being fatigued, and asked for a glass of wine and water: which having drank, Emmeline retired to bed, leaving the lady of the house, who had invited Mr. Hanbury and Emmeline friend to supper, to enjoy more stories of Jonathan Huggins, and the pretty satyrical efforts of Miss Galton, who made Emmeline court most effectually by ridiculing and villifying all their acquaintance whenever it was in Emmeline power.
