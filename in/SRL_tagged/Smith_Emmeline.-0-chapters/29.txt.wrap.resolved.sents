  Whenever Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline were afterwards alone, Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline could think and speak of nothing but Lady Adelina.
The misfortunes in which an unhappy marriage had involved Lady Adelina, Lady Adelina friendless youth, Lady Adelina lovely figure, the settled sorrow and deep regret that Lady Adelina seemed to feel for the error into which Lady Adelina too great sensibility of heart had betrayed Lady Adelina, engaged The misfortunes in which an unhappy marriage had involved her, her friendless youth, her lovely figure, the settled sorrow and deep regret that she seemed to feel for the error into which her too great sensibility of heart had betrayed her tenderest pity, and made The misfortunes in which an unhappy marriage had involved her, her friendless youth, her lovely figure, the settled sorrow and deep regret that she seemed to feel for the error into which her too great sensibility of heart had betrayed her both anxious to give Lady Adelina all the consolation and assistance Lady Adelina was now capable of receiving.
When The misfortunes in which an unhappy marriage had involved her, her friendless youth, her lovely figure, the settled sorrow and deep regret that she seemed to feel for the error into which her too great sensibility of heart had betrayed her considered the uncertainty of Lady Adelina remaining long concealed where Lady Adelina was, and the probability that Fitz-Edward himself might discover Lady Adelina, The misfortunes in which an unhappy marriage had involved her, her friendless youth, her lovely figure, the settled sorrow and deep regret that she seemed to feel for the error into which her too great sensibility of heart had betrayed her saw the necessity of Lady Adelina removal from Woodbury Forest.
But it was a proposal The misfortunes in which an unhappy marriage had involved her, her friendless youth, her lovely figure, the settled sorrow and deep regret that she seemed to feel for the error into which her too great sensibility of heart had betrayed her could not yet make--nor had The misfortunes in which an unhappy marriage had involved her, her friendless youth, her lovely figure, the settled sorrow and deep regret that she seemed to feel for the error into which her too great sensibility of heart had betrayed her yet recollected any place where Lady Adelina might be more secure.
Emmeline, who felt Lady Adelina particularly interested by Lady Adelina misfortunes, and who was more pleased with Lady Adelina conversation the oftener Lady Adelina conversed with Lady Adelina, seldom failed of seeing Lady Adelina every day: but Mrs. Stafford, more apprehensive of observation, could not so frequently visit Lady Adelina; and the precaution of both redoubled, when Mrs. Ashwood, Miss Galton, and the two Miss Ashwood's, arrived at Woodfield, where Mrs. Stafford, more apprehensive of observation declared an intention of staying the months of June and July.
Thither also, soon after, came the younger Mr. Crofts, who had made an acquaintance with Mr. Stafford in London with the hope of obtaining an invitation, which Mr. Stafford in London eagerly accepted.
Sir Richard Crofts, in the ambition of making a family, had determined to give every advantage to Sir Richard Crofts eldest son, which might authorise Sir Richard Crofts to look up to those alliances that would, Sir Richard Crofts hoped, make Sir Richard Crofts own obscurity forgotten.
From the first dawn of Sir Richard Crofts fortune, Sir Richard Crofts had considered Sir Richard Crofts as it's general heir; and had very plainly told Sir Richard Crofts younger son, that a place under government, which his younger son had procured for his younger son, of about three hundred a year, must be his younger son only dependance; till his younger son should possess two thousand pounds, all the provision his younger son intended making for his younger son at his younger son death--as his younger son meant not to diminish, by a more equal division, the patrimony of his younger son brother.
his younger son recommended to his younger son therefore to remedy this deficiency of fortune, by looking out for an affluent wife.
Nature had not eminently qualified his younger son for success in such a project; for his younger son person was short, thick, and ill made, and his younger son face composed of large broad features, two dim grey eyes, and a complexion of a dull sallow white.
A vain attempt to look like a gentleman, served only to render the meanness of his younger son figure more remarkable; and the qualities of his younger son heart and understanding were but little calculated to make his younger son personal imperfections forgotten.
his younger son heart was selfish, narrow, unfeeling, and at once mean and proud; his younger son understanding beneath mediocrity; and his younger son conversation consisted of quaint scraps of something that his younger son supposed was wit, or at least very like it.
And even such attempts to be entertaining, poor as they were, his younger son retailed from the office where his younger son passed the greatest part of his younger son time, and for a subaltern employment in which, his younger son education had been barely such as fitted his younger son.
But ignorant as his younger son was, and devoid of every estimable accomplishment, his younger son had an infinite deal of that inferior kind of policy called cunning; and being accustomed to consider his younger son establishment as depending wholly on his younger son, his younger son had acquired a habit of sacrificing every sentiment and every passion to that one purpose; and would adopt the opinions, and submit to the caprices of others, whenever his younger son thought the opinions could promote it.
his younger son had learned the obsequious attention, the indefatigable industry, the humble adulation which is necessary for the under departments of political business: and while such acquisitions gave his younger son hopes of rising in that line, the opinions failed not to contribute to his younger son success in another.
his younger son would walk from the extremity of Westminster to Wapping, to smuggle a set of china or of quadrille boxes, for the mother or aunt of an heiress; and would, with great temper, suffer the old ladies to take advantage of his younger son at cards, while his younger son ogled the young ones.
Which, together with his younger son being always ready to perform for them petty services, and to flatter them without scruple, had obtained for his younger son the character of 'one of the best creatures breathing.'
But whatever favour these various recommendations obtained for his younger son for a time, from the old ladies, his younger son lost his younger son ground when his younger son views were discovered; and tho' his younger son had received what his younger son fancied encouragement from two or three young women of fortune on two or three young women of fortune first emerging from the nursery, yet two or three young women of fortune had no sooner acquired an handsomer or richer lover, than 'the best creature breathing' was discarded.
his younger son was not however discouraged; and meeting with Mrs. Ashwood at a rout at Lady Montreville's, his younger son was told by Miss Delamere, who was extremely diverted with Mrs. Ashwood airs of elegance, that Mrs. Ashwood was a rich widow who wanted a husband.
his younger son enquired into the circumstances of Mrs. Ashwood fortune; and being assured Mrs. Ashwood possessed such an income as would make his younger son easy, his younger son thought some little advantage Mrs. Ashwood had over his younger son in point of age no diminution of Mrs. Ashwood attractions, and found it convenient to fall immediately in love.
Mrs. Ashwood listened to his younger son with complaisance; and soon discovered 'that his younger son was not so plain as at first his younger son appeared to be'--soon afterwards, 'that his younger son was rather handsome, and vastly sensible and agreeable.'
After which, his younger son made a rapid progress in Mrs. Ashwood heart; and it was concerted between he was rather handsome, and vastly sensible and agreeable that his younger son should follow Mrs. Ashwood to Woodfield.
Emmeline and Mrs. Stafford were wearied to death with the party.
But the former forbore to complain, and the latter was forced to submit, and to smile, while anguish was frequently at Mrs. Ashwood heart.
Mrs. Ashwood talked of nothing but fashionable parties and fashionable people, to whom Mrs. Ashwood acquaintance with Lord Montreville's family had introduced Mrs. Ashwood; and Mrs. Ashwood now seldom deigned to name an untitled acquaintance--while Crofts hung on Mrs. Ashwood long narratives with affected admiration; and the two elder of Mrs. Ashwood three daughters, who were all in training to be beauties, aped nothing but fashionable parties and fashionable people, to whom her acquaintance with Lord Montreville's family had introduced her mother in vanity and impertinence.
The eldest Miss Ashwood, now about fourteen, was an insupportable torment to Emmeline, as Emmeline had taken it into Emmeline head to form, with Emmeline, a sentimental friendship.
Emmeline had learned all the cant of sentiment from novels; and Emmeline mama's lovers had extremely edified Emmeline in teaching Emmeline to express it.
Emmeline talked perpetually of delicate embarrassments and exquisite sensibilities, and had probably a lover, as Emmeline extremely wanted a confidant; a post which Emmeline with some difficulty declined.--Of 'the sweet novels' Emmeline had read, Emmeline just understood as much as made Emmeline long to become the heroine of such an history Emmeline, and Emmeline wanted somebody to listen to Emmeline hopes of being so.
But Emmeline shrunk from Emmeline advances, and repaid Emmeline fondness with general and cool civility; Tho' Mrs. Ashwood, who loved rather to listen to Crofts than to attend to Crofts daughters, continually promoted the intimacy, in hopes that Crofts would take them off Crofts own hands, and allow them to be the companions of Crofts walks.
This, Emmeline was obliged studiously to evade, as such companions would entirely have prevented Emmeline seeing Lady Adelina; and by repeated excuses Emmeline not only irritated the curiosity of Mrs. Ashwood and Miss Galton, but gave the former an additional cause of dislike to that which Emmeline had already conceived; inasmuch as Emmeline was younger, handsomer, and more admired than Emmeline.
Emmeline received frequent letters from Delamere, as warm and passionate as Emmeline personal professions.
Emmeline told Emmeline, that as Emmeline mother's health was greatly amended, Emmeline intended soon to visit those parts of France with which Emmeline was yet unacquainted; and should pass some time in the Northern Provinces, from whence Emmeline entreated Emmeline to allow Emmeline to come only for a few days to England to see Emmeline--an indulgence which Emmeline said would enable Emmeline to bear with more tranquillity the remaining months of Emmeline exile.
Tho'' now accustomed to consider Emmeline as Tho' husband, Emmeline resolutely refused to consent to this breach of Emmeline engagement to Emmeline father.
Tho' had lately seen in Tho' friends, Mrs. Stafford and Lady Adelina, two melancholy instances of the frequent unhappiness of very early marriages; and Tho' had no inclination to hazard Tho' own happiness in hopes of proving an exception.
Tho' wished, therefore, rather to delay Tho' union with Delamere two or three years; but to Delamere Tho' never dared hint at such a delay.
A clandestine interview it was, however, in Tho' power to decline; and Tho' answered Delamere request by entreating Delamere not to think of such a journey; and represented to Delamere that Delamere could not expect Lord Montreville would finally adhere to _Delamere_ promises, if Delamere himself was careless of fulfilling the conditions on which he himself Lordship had insisted.
Having thus, as Tho' supposed, prevented Delamere from offending Delamere , and without any immediate uneasiness on Tho' own account, Tho' gave up Tho' mind to the solicitude Tho' could not help feeling for Lady Adelina.
This occupied almost all Tho' time when Tho' was alone; and gave Tho', when in company, an air of absence and reserve.
Mrs. Ashwood so much encouraged the attention of James Crofts, Mrs. Ashwood had not forgotten Fitz-Edward, whom Mrs. Ashwood had vainly sought at Lord Montreville, in hopes of renewing an acquaintance which had in it's commencement offered Mrs. Ashwood so much satisfaction.
Fitz-Edward had been amused with Fitz-Edward absurdity at the moment, but had never thought of Fitz-Edward afterwards; nor would Fitz-Edward then have bestowed so much time on a woman to Fitz-Edward entirely indifferent, had not Fitz-Edward been thrown in a woman way by Fitz-Edward desire to befriend Delamere with Emmeline, on one of those days when Lady Adelina insisted on Fitz-Edward leaving Lady Adelina, to avoid the appearance of Fitz-Edward passing with Lady Adelina all Fitz-Edward time.
Happy in successful love, Fitz-Edward gaiety then knew no bounds; and Fitz-Edward agreeable flattery, Fitz-Edward lively conversation, Fitz-Edward fashionable manners, and Fitz-Edward handsome person, had not since been absent from the memory of Mrs. Ashwood.
Fitz-Edward being sometimes at the house Fitz-Edward had borrowed of Delamere, near Woodfield, was one of the principal inducements to Lady Adelina to go thither.
Lady Adelina indulged sanguine hopes of securing such a conquest; and evaded giving to Crofts a positive answer, till Lady Adelina had made another essay on the heart of the Colonel.
the Colonel came, however, so seldom to Woodfield, that Mrs. Stafford had seen the Colonel there only once since Lady Adelina meeting Lady Adelina; and then the Colonel appeared to be under encreased dejection, for which Lady Adelina knew now, how to account.
Emmeline had given Mrs. Stafford so indifferent an account of Lady Adelina one evening, that Emmeline determined the next morning to see Emmeline.
Emmeline therefore went immediately after breakfast, on pretence of visiting a poor family who had applied to Emmeline for assistance; when as Mrs. Ashwood, Miss Galton and Emmeline, were sitting together, Colonel Fitz-Edward was announced.
Colonel Fitz-Edward came down to Tylehurst only the evening before; and not knowing there was company at Woodfield, rode over to pass an hour with the two friends, to whom Colonel Fitz-Edward had frequently been tempted to communicate the source of Colonel Fitz-Edward melancholy.
Whether it was owing to the consciousness of Lady Adelina mournful story that arose in the mind of Emmeline, or whether seeing Fitz-Edward again in company with Mrs. Ashwood renewed the memory of what had befallen Mrs. Ashwood when seeing Fitz-Edward again in company with Mrs. Ashwood last met, Mrs. Ashwood blushed deeply the moment Mrs. Ashwood beheld Colonel Fitz-Edward, and arose from Mrs. Ashwood chair in confusion; then sat down and took out Mrs. Ashwood work, which Mrs. Ashwood had hastily put up; and trying to recover Mrs. Ashwood, grew still more confused, and trembled and blushed again.
Mrs. Ashwood was in the mean time overwhelming Fitz-Edward with compliments and kind looks, which Mrs. Ashwood answered with the distant civility of a slight acquaintance; and taking a chair close to Emmeline, enquired if Mrs. Ashwood was not well?
Mrs. Ashwood answered that Mrs. Ashwood was perfectly well; and attempted to introduce general conversation.
But Fitz-Edward was attentive only to Mrs. Ashwood; and Mrs. Ashwood, extremely piqued at Fitz-Edward distant manner, meditated an excuse to get Emmeline out of the room, in hopes of obtaining more notice.
Fitz-Edward, however, having talked apart with Miss Mowbray a short time, arose and took leave, having by Fitz-Edward manner convinced Mrs. Ashwood of what Mrs. Ashwood reluctantly believed, that some later attachment had obliterated the impression Mrs. Ashwood had made at their first interview.
'I never saw such a figure in my life,' cried Mrs. Ashwood, 'as Fitz-Edward.
Mercy on me!--he is grown _so_ thin, and _so_ sallow!'
'And _so_ stupid,'interrupted Miss Galton.
'_so_ stupid,'interrupted Miss Galton. '
is in love I fancy.'
Emmeline blushed again; and Mrs. Ashwood casting a malicious look at Emmeline, said--'Oh!
yes--_so_ stupid,'interrupted Miss Galton. '
doubtless is in love.
To men of _so_ stupid,'interrupted Miss Galton. '
gay turn you know it makes no difference, whether a person be actually married or _engaged_.'
Emmeline, uncertain of the meaning of this sarcasm, and unwilling to be provoked to make a tart reply, which she felt she ready to do, put up she work and left the room.
While she went in search of Mrs. Stafford, to enquire after Lady Adelina, and to relate the conversation that had passed between she and Fitz-Edward, Mrs. Ashwood and Miss Galton were indulging her and Fitz-Edward, Mrs. Ashwood and Miss Galton natural malignity.
Tho'' well apprized of Emmeline's engagement to Delamere, yet they hesitated not to impute she confusion, and Fitz-Edward behaviour, to a passion between they.
they believed, that while she elopement with Delamere had beyond retreat entangled she with him, and while him fortune and future title tempted she to marry him, she heart was in possession of Fitz-Edward; and that Delamere was the dupe of Delamere mistress and Delamere friend.
This idea, which could not have occurred to a woman who was not she capable of all the perfidy it implied, grew immediately familiar with the imagination of Mrs. Ashwood, and embittered the sense of she own disappointment.
Miss Galton, who hated Emmeline more if possible than Mrs. Ashwood, irritated Emmeline suspicions by remarks of Emmeline own.
Emmeline observed 'that it was very extraordinary Miss Mowbray should walk out so early in a morning, and so studiously avoid taking any body with Emmeline--and that unless Emmeline had appointments to which Emmeline desired no witness, it was very singular Emmeline should chuse to ramble about by Emmeline.'
From these observations, and Emmeline evident confusion on seeing him, they concluded that Emmeline had daily assignations with Fitz-Edward.
they agreed, that it would be no more than common justice to inform Mr. Delamere of they discovery; and this they determined to do as soon as they had certain proofs to produce, with which they concluded a very little trouble and attention would furnish they.
James Crofts, whose success was now indisputable, since of the handsome Colonel there were no hopes, was let into the secret of James Crofts, whose success was now indisputable, since of the handsome Colonel suspicions; and readily undertook to assist in detecting the intrigue, for which the handsome Colonel assured James Crofts, whose success was now indisputable, since of the handsome Colonel the handsome Colonel had particular talents.
While, therefore, Mrs. Ashwood, Miss Galton, and James Crofts, were preparing to undermine the peace and character of the innocent, ingenuous Emmeline, she and Mrs. Stafford were meditating how to be useful to Lady AdelinaLady Adelina.
she and Mrs. Stafford became every day more interested and more apprehensive for the fate of that devoted young woman, whose health seemed to be such as made it very improbable she should survive the birth of she child.
she spirits, too, were so depressed, that Her spirits could not prevail on she to think of she own safety, or to allow Her spirits to make any overtures to she family; but, in calm and hopeless languor, she seemed resigned to the horrors of she destiny, and determined to die unlamented and unknown.
she elder brother, Lord Westhaven, had returned from abroad almost immediately after she concealment.
His enquiries on His first arrival in England had only informed His of the embarrassment of Trelawny's affairs, and the inconvenience to which His sister had consequently been exposed; and that after staying some time in England, to settle things as well as his sister could, his sister had disappeared, and every body believed was gone to his sister husband.
her husband Lordship's acquaintance and marriage with Augusta Delamere, almost immediately succeeded; but while it was depending, her husband was astonished to hear from Lord and Lady Clancarryl that Lady Adelina had never written to His Lordship's acquaintance and marriage with Augusta Delamere before his sister departure.
her husband went in search of Fitz-Edward; but could never meet her husband at home or obtain from her husband servants any direction where to find her husband.
Fitz-Edward, indeed, purposely avoided her husband, and had left no address at Fitz-Edward lodgings in town, or at Tylehurst.
Lord Westhaven then wrote to Trelawny, but obtained no answer; and growing daily more alarmed at the uncertainty Fitz-Edward was in about Lady Adelina, Fitz-Edward determined to go, as soon as Fitz-Edward was married, to Switzerland; being persuaded Tho'' some accident had prevented Fitz-Edward receiving her letters, her had found an asylum there, amongst Fitz-Edward mother's relations.
Fitz-Edward, with anxiety even more poignant, had sought her with as little success.
After the morning when her discharged her lodgings, and left them in an hackney coach with her maid, Fitz-Edward could never, with all Fitz-Edward unwearied researches, discover any traces of her.
Fitz-Edward knew her was not gone to Trelawny; and dreading every thing from her determined sorrow, Fitz-Edward passed Fitz-Edward whole time between painful and fruitless conjectures, and the tormenting apprehension of hearing of some fatal event.
Incessantly reproaching Fitz-Edward for being the betrayer of Fitz-Edward trust, and the ruin of a lovely and amiable woman, Fitz-Edward gave Fitz-Edward up to regret and despondence.
The gay Fitz-Edward, so lately the envy and admiration of the fashionable world, was lost to society, Fitz-Edward friends, and Fitz-Edward.
Fitz-Edward passed much of Fitz-Edward time at Tylehurst; because Fitz-Edward could there indulge, without interruption, Fitz-Edward melancholy reflections, and only saw Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline, in whose soft and sensible conversation Fitz-Edward found a transient alleviation of Fitz-Edward sorrow--sorrow which now grew too severe to be longer concealed, and which Fitz-Edward resolved to take the earliest opportunity of acknowledging, in hopes of engaging the pity of Fitz-Edward fair friends--perhaps his fair friends assistance in discovering the unhappy fugitive who caused it.
From Lady Adelina, his fair friends had most carefully concealed, that Fitz-Edward residence was so near the obscure abode his residence had chosen.
Fatal as Fitz-Edward had been to his residence peace, and conscientiously as his residence had abstained from naming Fitz-Edward after their first conversation, their knew that his residence still fondly loved Fitz-Edward, and that his residence fears for Fitz-Edward safety had assisted his residence sense of rectitude when his residence determined to tear his residence from Fitz-Edward.
But were his residence again to meet Fitz-Edward, their feared his residence would either relapse into his residence former fatal affection, or conquer it by an effort, which in his residence precarious state of health might prove immediately fatal.
The request which Fitz-Edward had made to Emmeline, that Fitz-Edward might be allowed to see his residence and Mrs. Stafford together, without any other person being present, they both wished to evade; dreading least they both should by they both countenances betray the knowledge they both had of Fitz-Edward unhappy story, and the interest they both took in it's catastrophe.
they both hoped, therefore, to escape hearing Fitz-Edward confession till Lady Adelina should be removed--and to remove Lady Adelina became indispensibly necessary, as Emmeline was convinced Lady Adelina was watched in Lady Adelina visits to the cottage.
Twice Lady Adelina had met James Crofts within half a quarter of a mile of the cottage; and at another time discovered, just as Lady Adelina was about to enter James Crofts, that the Miss Ashwoods had followed Lady Adelina almost to the door; which Lady Adelina therefore forbore to enter.
These circumstances made both Lady Adelina and Mrs. Stafford solicitous to have Lady Adelina placed in greater security; and, added to Emmeline's uneasiness for Emmeline, was the unpleasant situation in which Lady Adelina found Lady Adelina.
Observed with malicious vigilance by Mrs. Ashwood, James Crofts, Miss Galton, and the two Misses, Lady Adelina felt as awkward as if Lady Adelina really had some secret of Lady Adelina own to hide; and with all the purity and even heroism of virtue, learned the uneasy sensation which ever attends mystery and concealment.
The hours which used to pass tranquilly and rationally with Mrs. Stafford, were now dedicated to people whose conversation made Lady Adelina no amends; and if Lady Adelina retired to Lady Adelina own room, it failed not to excite sneers and suspicions.
Lady Adelina saw Mrs. Stafford struggling with dejection which Lady Adelina had no power to dissipate or relieve, and obliged to enter into frequent parties of what is called pleasure, tho' to Lady Adelina it gave only fatigue and disgust, to gratify Mrs. Ashwood, who hated all society but a crowd.
James Crofts, indeed, helped to keep Lady Adelina in good humour by James Crofts excessive adulation; and chiefly by assuring Lady Adelina, that by any man of the least taste, the baby face of Emmeline could be considered only as a foil to Emmeline more mature charms, and that Emmeline fine dark eyes eclipsed all the eyes in the world.
James Crofts protested too against Emmeline for affecting knowledge--'It is,' said James Crofts, 'a maxim of my father's--and my father is no bad judge--that for a woman to affect literature is the most horrid of all absurdities; and for a woman to know any thing of business, is detestable!'
Mrs. Ashwood laid by Mrs. Ashwood dictionary, determined for the future to spell Mrs. Ashwood own way without it.
Besides the powerful intervention of flattery, James Crofts had another not less successful method of winning the lady's favour.
James Crofts told Mrs. Ashwood that James Crofts brother, who had long cherished a passion in which James Crofts was at length likely to be disappointed, was in that case determined never to marry; that James Crofts was in an ill state of health; and if James Crofts died without posterity, the estate and title of my father would descend to James Crofts.
The elder Crofts, very desirous of seeing a brother established who might otherwise be burthensome or inconvenient to James Crofts, suggested this finesse; and secured it's belief by writing frequent and melancholy accounts of James Crofts own ill health--an artifice by which James Crofts promoted at once James Crofts brother's views and James Crofts own.
James Crofts affected the valetudinarian so happily, and complained so much of the ill effect that constant application to business had on James Crofts constitution, that nobody doubted of the reality of James Crofts sickness.
James Crofts took care that Augusta Delamere should receive an account of it, which James Crofts knew Augusta Delamere would consider as the consequence of James Crofts despairing love; and when James Crofts had interested Augusta Delamere vanity and of course Augusta Delamere compassion, James Crofts contrived to obtain leave of absence for three months from the duties of James Crofts office, in order to go abroad for the recovery of James Crofts health.
James Crofts hastened to Barege; and soon found means to re-establish James Crofts in the favour of Augusta Delamere; from which, absence, and large draughts of flattery dispensed with French adroitness, had a little displaced James Crofts.
This stratagem put James Crofts brother James on so fair a footing with the widow, that James Crofts thought Augusta Delamere fortune would be secured before Augusta Delamere could discover her fortune to be only a stratagem, and that Augusta Delamere lover was still likely to continue a younger brother.
James Crofts seeing the necessity of dispatch, became so importunate, that Mrs. Ashwood, despairing of Fitz-Edward, and believing James Crofts might not again meet with a man so near a title, for which James Crofts had a violent inclination, was prevailed on to promise James Crofts would make James Crofts happy as soon as James Crofts returned to James Crofts own house.
It was now the end of June; and Lady Adelina, whose situation grew very critical, had at length yielded to the entreaties of James Crofts two friends, and agreed to go wherever the entreaties of her two friends thought James Crofts could obtain assistance and concealment in the approaching hour.
Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline, after long and frequent reflections and consultations on the subject, concluded that no situation would be so proper as Bath.
In a place resorted to by all sorts of people, less enquiry is excited than in a provincial town, where strangers are objects of curiosity to less enquiry's idle inhabitants.
To Bath, therefore, it was determined Lady Adelina should go.
But when the time of James Crofts journey, and James Crofts arrangements there, came to be discussed, James Crofts expressed so much terror least James Crofts should be known, so much anguish at leaving those to whose tender pity James Crofts was so greatly indebted, and such melancholy conviction that James Crofts should not survive, that the sensible heart of Emmeline could not behold without sharing Emmeline agonies; nor was Mrs. Stafford less affected.
When they returned home after this interview, Emmeline was pursued by the image of the poor unhappy Lady Adelina.
But to give, to the wretched, only barren sympathy, was not in Emmeline nature, where more effectual relief was in Emmeline power.
Emmeline thought, that if by Emmeline presence Emmeline could alleviate the anguish, and soothe the sorrows of the fair mourner, perhaps save Emmeline character and Emmeline life, and be the means of restoring Emmeline to Emmeline family, Emmeline should perform an action gratifying to Emmeline own heart, and acceptable to heaven.
The more Emmeline reflected on The, The more anxious Emmeline became to execute The--and Emmeline at length named The to Mrs. Stafford.
Mrs. Stafford, tho' aware of the numberless objections which might have been made to such a plan, could not resolve strenuously to oppose such a plan.
Emmeline felt infinite compassion for Lady Adelina; but could Emmeline do little to assist Emmeline, as Emmeline time was not Emmeline own and Emmeline absence must have been accounted for: but Emmeline was liable to no restraint; and would not only be meritoriously employed in befriending the unhappy, but would escape from the society at Woodfield, which became every day more disagreeable to Emmeline.
These considerations, particularly the benevolent one of saving an unhappy young woman, over-balanced, in the mind of Mrs. Stafford, the objection that might be made to Emmeline accompanying a person under the unfortunate and discreditable circumstances of Lady Adelina; and Lady Adelina heart, too expansive to be closed by the cold hand of prudery against the sighs of weakness or misfortune, assured Emmeline that Emmeline was right.
Emmeline knew that Emmeline was of a character to pity, but not to imitate, the erroneous conduct of Emmeline friend; and Emmeline believed that the reputation of Lady Adelina Trelawny might be rescued from reproach, without communicating any part of it's blemish to the spotless purity of Emmeline Mowbray.
