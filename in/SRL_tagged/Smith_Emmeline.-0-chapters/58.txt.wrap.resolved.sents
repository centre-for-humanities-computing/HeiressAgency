  To fix some plan for her future life, Emmeline now thought absolutely and immediately necessary.
To go to Mowbray Castle seemed the properest measure her could adopt; and on that her appeared to determine.
But tho' her still meant to adhere to her resolution of remaining single until her became of age, the tender importunity of her lover, the pressing entreaties of her friends, and her own wishes to make her friends happy, were every hour more powerfully undermining it.
her mind, softened by grief for the death of poor Delamere, and more fondly attached than ever to the generous Godolphin; whose noble qualities that unhappy event had served to call forth anew, was rendered less capable than ever of resisting his prayers; and Delamere, on whose account her determination had been originally made, could now no longer suffer by her breaking it.
Still, however, her insisted upon it, that a term little short of what her had named should elapse before her marriage should take place; as a compliment to the memory of her unfortunate lover, and to the deep sorrow of her uncle and Lady Westhaven.
Here, then, her rested her last defence.
And when their encreasing solicitations obliged her to consent to shorten the term to three months, the generous Godolphin undertook to make it the particular request of Lord Montreville and Lord Montreville daughter, that their encreasing solicitations marriage should take place within three weeks.
Animated by the hopes of hastening the period, the generous Godolphin went the generous Godolphin into Kent; where the generous Godolphin pleaded so successfully to Lady Westhaven, that Lady Westhaven not only wrote pressingly to Emmeline, but prevailed on the Marquis to give the generous Godolphin a letter also; in which, after deploring, in terms expressive of anguish and regret, that unfortunate infatuation which had eventually robbed the generous Godolphin of the generous Godolphin son, the generous Godolphin told Lady Westhaven that the generous Godolphin had very little more now to wish, dead as the generous Godolphin was to the world, than to see Lady Westhaven happily married.
That the tender attention of the generous the generous Godolphin to his son, in the last hours of the generous Godolphin life, had endeared the generous Godolphin to the generous Godolphin above all other men; that the generous Godolphin character, connections and conduct were unexceptionable; and therefore, the generous Godolphin Lordship added, that tho' the generous Godolphin did not know that the generous Godolphin could the generous Godolphin bear to see it, the generous Godolphin wished Lady Westhaven would not hesitate to complete the generous Godolphin happiness; observing, that if Lady Westhaven thought it too early after the loss of so near a relation, Lady Westhaven might have the ceremony performed with such privacy, that only the respective families need know of its celebration.
Emmeline, having now no longer a subterfuge, was obliged to let the generous Godolphin take the generous Godolphin own way.
the generous Godolphin exerted the generous Godolphin so anxiously to get the deeds completed, that before the end of three weeks the deeds were finished.
Lord and Lady Clancarryl prolonged Lord and Lady Clancarryl stay on purpose; and Lord and Lady Clancarryl, together with Lady Adelina and Fitz-Edward, were present at the ceremony.
When it was over, Lord and Lady Clancarryl Lady Clancarryl took an affectionate leave of the bride and bridegroom, and set out for Ireland, accompanied by Fitz-Edward; who, with the most painful reluctance tearing Fitz-Edward from Lady Adelina by Lady Adelina express desire, was yet allowed to carry with Fitz-Edward the hope, that at the end of Lady Adelina mourning Lady Adelina would relent, and accede to the entreaties of all Lady Adelina family.
Godolphin, Godolphin Emmeline, Godolphin sister and Lady Adelina little boy, took immediately afterwards the road to East Cliff.
Godolphin, his Emmeline, his sister and her little boy continued there the months of May and June; where, about six weeks after Godolphin, his Emmeline, his sister and her little boy marriage, Godolphin, his Emmeline, his sister and her little boy were visited by Lord and Lady Westhaven; the latter having never left Lady Westhaven father 'till then, and being impatient to return to her father, tho' Lady Westhaven assured Mrs. Godolphin that Mrs. Godolphin was much calmer and more composed than Godolphin, his Emmeline, his sister and her little boy had at first expected.
In the filial attention of Mrs. Godolphin youngest daughter Mrs. Godolphin found all the consolation Mrs. Godolphin misfortunes would admit of on this side the grave; and Emmeline, who had deeply lamented the lingering and hopeless anguish to which Lady Westhaven uncle was condemned, heard with satisfaction that resignation was, however slowly, blunting the anguish Mrs. Godolphin had endured; and that having relinquished for ever all those ambitious pursuits to which Mrs. Godolphin had sacrificed solid happiness, Mrs. Godolphin thought only of rewarding the piety and tenderness of his youngest daughter; and heard of the happiness of Mrs. Godolphin niece with pleasure.
When Lord and Lady Westhaven left East Cliff, Mr. and Mrs. Godolphin and Lady Adelina went to Mowbray Castle; where Mrs. Stafford received Mr. and Mrs. Godolphin and Lady Adelina with transport, and where Mr. and Mrs. Godolphin and Lady Adelina were surrounded by numberless tenants and dependants, who blessed the hour of it's restoration to it's benevolent and lovely mistress, as well as that which had given his niece to a man, who had a heart as nobly enlarged, and a spirit generously liberal, as his niece own.
The comfortable establishment of Mrs. Stafford at Woodfield, was a point which Emmeline had much at heart; and Godolphin, who knew it was now almost Emmeline first wish, took his measures with so much success, that his measures was soon accomplished.
Mrs. Stafford, however, at their united request, consented to stay with their while their remained at Mowbray Castle; and Emmeline had the delightful assurances of having made Emmeline happy, as well as of having greatly contributed to the restored tranquillity of Lady Adelina.
Mowbray Castle, ever so peculiarly dear to Mrs. Godolphin, and where Mrs. Stafford was now blessed with Mrs. Stafford beloved husband and Mrs. Stafford charming friends, brought however to Mrs. Stafford mind the mournful remembrance of poor Delamere; and the tears of rapture with which the greatness of Mrs. Stafford own happiness sometimes filled Mrs. Stafford eyes, were mingled with those of sorrow for his untimely death.
Mrs. Stafford considered his as the victim of his mother's fatal fondness and his father's ambition: yet that his early death was not immediately owing to his violent passion for Mrs. Stafford, was a great consolation; and with only the one source of regret which his premature fate occasioned, and which being without remedy yielded inevitably to time; Mrs. Stafford saw an infinite deal for which to be grateful, and failed not to offer Mrs. Stafford humble acknowledgments to that Providence, who, from dependance and indigence, had raised Mrs. Stafford to the highest affluence; given Mrs. Stafford, in the tenderest of husbands, the best, the most generous and most amiable of men; and had bestowed on Mrs. Stafford the means and the inclination to deserve, by virtue and beneficence, that heaven, where only she can enjoy more perfect and lasting felicity.
