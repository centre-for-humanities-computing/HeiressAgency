  Sir Richard Crofts brought Mr. Rochely to Lord Montreville at the time appointed; and in consequence of the conversation then held, Lord Montreville Lordship was confirmed in his Lordship resolution of persisting in the plan Sir Richard had laid down, to force Emmeline to accept the good fortune offered Emmeline. Lord Montreville had sent as soon as Lord Montreville got to town to Delamere's lodgings, whose servants said that Lord Montreville had slept there, but was then gone out. his Lordship his Lordship concluded Lord Montreville was gone to Clapham; but as Lord Montreville could not remedy Lord Montreville uneasiness on that head, Lord Montreville was obliged to endure that head. About twelve o'clock Delamere had arranged matters for Delamere concealment; and about three, as Lord Montreville was dressing to go out, Millefleur, together with Delamere's footman and groom, came as Delamere's footman and groom had been ordered to Berkley-square. This circumstance was no sooner related to Lord Montreville by Lord Montreville valet de chambre, than Lord Montreville ordered Millefleur to be sent up. The Frenchman related to his Lordship, that his master was certainly gone to Mr. Percival's; but Lord Montreville concluded Lord Montreville was gone to Scotland, and, in a tempest of anger and vexation, cursed the hour when Lord Montreville had listened to the advice of Sir Richard Crofts, the harshness of whose proceedings had, Lord Montreville imagined, precipitated the event Lord Montreville had so long dreaded. Lord Montreville was so entirely persuaded that this conjecture was the truth, that Lord Montreville first gave orders for a post-chaise and four to be ready directly; then recollecting that if Lord Montreville overtook Lord Montreville son Lord Montreville had no power to force his son back, his son thought it better to take with his son some one who could influence Emmeline. his son youngest daughter was still in Yorkshire; Mrs. Stafford his son knew not where to find; but his son supposed that Mrs. Ashwood, with whom Mrs. Stafford had lived some months, might have power to persuade Mrs. Stafford; and not knowing what else to do, indeed hardly knowing what his son expected from the visit, his son ordered his son coachman to be as expeditious as possible in conveying his son to the house of that lady.  Mrs. Ashwood, His youngest daughter brother, and four or five other persons related to the family, were at dinner. Lord Montreville entered the room; spoke to those Lord Montreville knew with as much civility as Lord Montreville could; but not seeing Emmeline among those he knew with as much civility as he could, Lord Montreville apprehensions were confirmed. Lord Montreville desired those he knew with as much civility as he could would not disturb those he knew with as much civility as he could; and declined sharing those he knew with as much civility as he could repast; but being unable to conceal Lord Montreville emotion till it was over, Lord Montreville said to Mrs. Ashwood--'I am sorry, Madam, to trouble you on this unhappy business. I did hope you would have had the goodness at least to inform me of the goodness. What can I do?' exclaimed Lord Montreville, breaking suddenly from Lord Montreville discourse and rising--'Good God, what can I do?'  the goodness were silent, and amazed.  Mrs. Ashwood--'I, however, said, 'I am sorry that any thing, my Lord, has disturbed your Lordship. I am sure I should have been happy, my Lord, could I have been of any service to your Lordship in whatever it is.'  'Disturbed!' cried Lord Montreville, striking Lord Montreville forehead with Lord Montreville hand, 'I am distracted! When did Mrs. Ashwood--'I go? How long has Mrs. Ashwood--'I been gone?'  'Who, my Lord?'  'Miss Mowbray--Emmeline--Oh! it will be impossible to overtake them!'  'Gone! my Lord?'  'Gone with Delamere!--Gone to Scotland!'  ''Miss Mowbray--Emmeline-- was however in the house not an hour ago,' said Miss Galton; 'I saw Miss Galton go up the garden just as we sat down to dinner.'  'Then Miss Galton went to meet him!--then they went together!'--exclaimed Lord Montreville, walking round the room.  An assertion so positive staggered every one. they rose from table in confusion.  'Let we go up,' said Mrs. Ashwood; 'I can hardly think it possible, my Lord, that 'Miss Mowbray--Emmeline-- 'Miss Mowbray--Emmeline-- is gone, unless your Lordship absolutely saw they.'  Yet Mrs. Ashwood remembered that Delamere had been there in the morning, and that Emmeline had dined early alone, and had remained by Emmeline all the rest of the day, under pretence of sickness; and Emmeline began to believe that all this was done to give Emmeline time to elope with Delamere.  Emmeline went up stairs; and Lord Montreville, without knowing what Lord Montreville did, followed Emmeline. stairs were carpetted; any one ascending was hardly heard; and Mrs. Ashwood suddenly throwing open the door of Mrs. Ashwood chamber, Lord Montreville saw Mrs. Ashwood, with Mrs. Ashwood handkerchief held to Mrs. Ashwood face, hanging over a packet of papers which lay on the table before Mrs. Ashwood.  Emmeline did not immediately look up--an exclamation from Lord Montreville made Emmeline take her handkerchief from Emmeline eyes.  Emmeline arose; tried to conceal the sorrow visible in Emmeline countenance yet wet with tears, and assuming as much as Emmeline could Emmeline native ease and sweetness, Emmeline advanced towards his Lordship, who still stood at the door of her chamber, amazed, and asked his if his would pardon Emmeline for desiring his to sit down in a bed-chamber; if not, Emmeline would wait on his below. Emmeline then went back to the table; threw the papers into the casket that was on the papers; and placing a chair between that and the fire, again asked his if his would do Emmeline the honour to sit down.  Lord Montreville did so, but said nothing. Lord Montreville was ashamed of Lord Montreville precipitancy; yet as Emmeline did not know it, Lord Montreville would not mention it; and was yet too full of the idea to speak of any thing else.  Mrs. Ashwood had left them--Emmeline continued silent.  Lord Montreville, after a long pause, at length said, with a stern and displeased countenance, 'I understand, Miss Mowbray, that my son was here this morning.'  'Yes, my Lord.'  'Pray, do you know where my son now is?'  'I do not, indeed. Is my son not at your Lordship's house?'  'No; I am told by my son servants that my son is gone to Mr. Percival's--But _you_--'(continued my son, laying a strong emphasis on the word) '_you_, Miss Mowbray, are I dare say better informed of my son intentions than any one else.'  'Upon my word, Lord Montreville,' answered Emmeline, astonished, 'I do _not_ know. my son said nothing to my son of an intention to go any where; on the contrary, my son told me my son should be here again to-morrow.'  'And is it possible you are ignorant of my son having left London this morning, immediately after my son returned from visiting you?'  'Lord Montreville, I have never yet stooped to the meanness of a falsehood. Why should your Lordship now suppose me guilty of your Lordship? I repeat--and I hope you will do me the justice to believe me--upon my honour I do _not_ know whither Mr. Delamere is gone--nor do I know that Mr. Delamere has left London.'  Lord Montreville could not but believe Lord Montreville. But while Lord Montreville fears were relieved as to the elopement, they were awakened anew by the uncertainty of what was become of Lord Montreville son, and what Lord Montreville motive could be for this sudden disappearance.  Lord Montreville thought however the present opportunity of speaking to Emmeline of Lord Montreville resolution was not to be neglected.  'However ignorant you may be, Miss Mowbray,' said Lord Montreville, 'of the reason of Lord Montreville having quitted Lord Montreville lodgings, you are not to learn that Lord Montreville motive for estranging Lord Montreville from Lord Montreville family, and becoming a stranger to Lord Montreville father's house, originates in Lord Montreville inconsiderate attachment to you. Contrary to the assurances you gave me at Swansea, you have encouraged this attachment; and, as I understand from Sir Richard Crofts, you peremptorily and even rudely refuse the opportunity now offered you of establishing yourself in rank and affluence, which no other young woman would a moment hesitate to accept. Such a refusal cannot be owing to mere caprice; nor could it possibly happen had you not determined, in despite of every objection, and of bringing discord into my family, to listen to that infatuated and rash young man.'  'your Lordship does not treat me with your usual candour. I have promised you, voluntarily promised you, not to marry Mr. Delamere without your Lordship's consent. To prevent Mr. Delamere coming here was out of my power; but if I really aspired to the honour of which your Lordship thinks me ambitious, _what_ has prevented me from engaging at once with Mr. Delamere? who has, I own to you, pressed me repeatedly to elope. Lord Montreville, while I am treated with kindness and confidence, I can rely upon his resolution of persisting in the plan Sir Richard had laid down to deserve his resolution of persisting in the plan Sir Richard had laid down; _but_ when your Lordship, on suspicion or misrepresentation, is induced to withdraw that kindness and confidence--why should _I_ make a point of honour, where _you_ no longer seem to expect it?'  The truth of this answer, as well as it's spirit, at once hurt and irritated Lord Montreville.  Determined to separate Emmeline from his son, Lord Montreville was mortified to be forced to acknowledge in Lord Montreville own breast that Emmeline merited all Lord Montreville affection, and angry that Emmeline should be in the right when Lord Montreville wished to have found something to blame in Emmeline conduct. Pride and self-love seemed to resent that a little weak girl should pretend to a sense of rectitude, and a force of understanding greater than Lord Montreville own.  Miss Mowbray,' said your Lordship sharply, 'I will be very explicit with you--either consent to marry Mr. Rochely, whose affection does you so much honour, or expect from your Lordship no farther kindness.'  'your Lordship knows,' answered Emmeline, 'that I have no friend on whom I have the least claim but you. If you abandon me--but, Lord Montreville, ought you to do it?----I am indeed most friendless!'  Emmeline could no longer command Emmeline tears--sobs obliged Emmeline to cease speaking.  Lord Montreville thought Emmeline resolution would give way; and trying to divest Lord Montreville of all feeling, with an effort truly political, Lord Montreville determined to press Lord Montreville point.  'It is in your power,' resumed Lord Montreville, 'not only to place yourself above all fear of such desertion, but to engage my affection and that of my whole family. You will be in a situation of life which I should hardly refuse for one of the Miss Delameres. You will possess the most unbounded affluence, and a husband who adores you. A man unexceptionable in character; of a mature age; and whose immense fortune is every day encreasing. You will be considered by A man unexceptionable in character; of a mature age; and whose immense fortune is every day encreasing, and by Lady Montreville, as a daughter of the house of 'Miss Mowbray--Emmeline--. The blemish of your birth will be wiped off and forgotten.'  Emmeline wept more than before.  And your Lordship continued, 'If you absurdly refuse an offer so infinitely above your expectations, I shall consider A man unexceptionable in character; of a mature age; and whose immense fortune is every day encreasing as having more than done my duty in putting it in your way; and that your folly and imprudence dissolve all obligation on my part. You must no longer call yourself 'Miss Mowbray--Emmeline--; and you must forget that you ever were allowed to be numbered among the relations of my family. Nor shall I think A man unexceptionable in character; of a mature age; and whose immense fortune is every day encreasing obliged in any manner to provide for a person, who in scorn of gratitude, prudence and reputation, throws from A man unexceptionable in character; of a mature age; and whose immense fortune is every day encreasing an opportunity of providing for A man unexceptionable in character; of a mature age; and whose immense fortune is every day encreasing.'  Emmeline regained some degree of resolution. Emmeline looked up, Emmeline eyes streaming with tears, and said, 'Well, Lord Montreville! to the lowest indigence I must then submit; for to marry Mr. Rochely is not in my power.'  'We will suppose for a moment,' resumed Lord Montreville, 'that you could realize the visionary hopes you have presumed to indulge of uniting yourself to Mr. Delamere. Dear as Mr. Delamere is to me and Mr. Delamere mother, We are determined from that moment to renounce Mr. Delamere--never shall the rebellious son who has dared to disobey We, be again admitted to We presence!--never will We acknowledge as Mr. Delamere wife, a person forced upon We and introduced into We family in despite of We commands, and in violation of duty, honour, and affection. _You_ will be the occasion of his being loaded with the curses of both his parents, and of introducing misery and discord into his family. Can you yourself be happy under such circumstances? In point of fortune too you will find yourself deceived--while _we_ live, Mr. Delamere can have but a very slender income; and of every thing in We power We shall certainly deprive Mr. Delamere, both while We live, and at We decease. Consider well what I have said; and make use of your reason. Begin by giving up to me the ridiculous witnesses of a ridiculous and boyish passion, which must be no longer indulged; to keep a picture of Delamere is discreditable and indelicate--you will not refuse to relinquish a picture of Delamere?'  Delamere reached over the table, and took from among two or three loose papers, which yet lay before Emmeline, a little blue enamelled case, which Delamere concluded contained a miniature of Delamere, of whom several had been drawn. Emmeline, absorbed in tears, did not oppose a picture of Delamere. The spring of the case was defective. The spring of the case opened in Delamere hand; and presented to Delamere view, not a portrait of Delamere son, but of Delamere brother, drawn when Delamere was about twenty, and at a period when Delamere was more than a brother--when Delamere was the dearest friend Lord Montreville had on earth. A likeness so striking, which Delamere had not seen for many years, had an immediate effect upon Delamere.  his brother seemed to look at Delamere mournfully. A melancholy cast about the eye-brows diminished the vivacity of the countenance, and the faded colour (for the picture had been painted seven and twenty years) gave the picture a look of languor and ill health; such perhaps as the original wore before Delamere death, when a ruined constitution threatened Delamere for some months, tho' Delamere life terminated by a malignant fever in a few hours.  The poor distrest Emmeline was the only memorial left of Delamere; and Lord Montreville felt Emmeline tears a reproach for Lord Montreville cruelty in thus threatening to abandon to Emmeline fate, the unhappy daughter of this once loved brother.  Sir Richard Crofts and Lord Montreville were not by, to intercept these sentiments of returning humanity. Sir Richard Crofts and Lady Montreville found the tears fill Sir Richard Crofts and Lady Montreville eyes as Sir Richard Crofts and Lady Montreville gazed on the picture.  Emmeline, insensible of every thing, saw it not; and not conscious that Sir Richard Crofts and Lady Montreville had taken it, the purport of Sir Richard Crofts and Lady Montreville last words she believed to relate to a sketch she had she made of Delamere. she was therefore surprized, when Lord Montreville arising, took she hand, and in a voice that witnessed the emotion of Lord Montreville soul, said--'Come, my dear Emmeline, pardon me for thus distressing you, you shall _not_ be compelled to marry Mr. Rochely if you have so great a dislike to Mr. Rochely. You shall still have an adequate support; and I trust I shall have nothing to fear from your indiscretion in regard to Delamere.'  'your Lordship,' answered Emmeline, without taking Emmeline handkerchief from his eyes, 'has never yet found me capable of falsehood: I will repeat, if you desire it, the promise I gave you--I will even take the most solemn oath you shall dictate, never to be the wife of Mr. Delamere, unless your your Lordship and Lord Montreville consent.'  'I take your promise,' answered your Lordshipyour Lordship, 'and shall rely firmly upon your Lordship. But Emmeline, you must go from hence for your own sake; your peace and reputation require your Lordship; Delamere must not frequent the house where you are: you must conceal from Delamere the place of your abode.'  'Lord Montreville, I will be ingenuous with Emmeline. To go from hence is what I intend, and with your Lordshipyour Lordship's permission I will set out immediately for Mrs. Stafford's. But to conceal from Mr. Delamere where I am, is not in my power; for I have given Mr. Delamere where I am a solemn promise to see Mr. Delamere where I am if Mr. Delamere where I am desires it, wherever I shall be: and as I hope you depend on my honour, it must be equally sacred whether given to Mr. Delamere where I am or you. You will therefore not insist on my breaking this engagement, and I promise you again never to violate the other.'  With this compromise, Lord Montreville was obliged to be content. Lord Montreville entreated Emmeline to see Rochely again, and hear Lord Montreville offers. But Mrs. Stafford absolutely refused; assuring Lord Montreville, that were Lord Montreville fortune infinitely greater, Mrs. Stafford would not marry Lord Montreville, tho' servitude should be the alternative.  your Lordship therefore forbore to press Mrs. Stafford farther. Lord Montreville desired, that if Delamere wrote to Mrs. Stafford, or saw Mrs. Stafford, Mrs. Stafford would let Lord Montreville know, which Mrs. Stafford readily agreed to; and Lord Montreville told Mrs. Stafford, that so long as Mrs. Stafford was single, and did nothing to disoblige Lord Montreville, Lord Montreville would pay Mrs. Stafford an hundred guineas a year in quarterly payments. Lord Montreville gave Mrs. Stafford a bank note of fifty pounds; and recommending a bank note of fifty pounds to Mrs. Stafford to go as soon as possible to Mrs. Stafford's, Lord Montreville kissed Mrs. Stafford cheek with an appearance of affection greater than Lord Montreville had yet shewn, and then went home to prepare for the reception of Lady Montreville, whose arrival Lord Montreville did not greatly wish for; dreading lest Mrs. Stafford violence and ill-temper should drive his son into some new extravagance. But as Mrs. Stafford will was not to be disputed, Lord Montreville submitted without remonstrance to the alteration of the plan Lord Montreville had proposed; which was, that Lord Montreville family should pass his family Christmas in Norfolk, whither Lord Montreville intended to have returned.  The next day Delamere was again at Clapham, very early.  Emmeline, the additional agitation of whose mind had prevented Delamere sleeping during the night, appeared more indisposed than Delamere had done the day before.  Delamere, very much alarmed at Delamere altered looks, anxiously enquired the cause? And without hesitation Delamere told him simply all that had passed; the promise Delamere had given to him father, to which Delamere intended strictly to adhere, and the arrangement Delamere had agreed to on condition of being persecuted no more on the score of Mr. Rochely.  It is impossible to describe the grief and indignation of Delamere, at hearing this relation. He saw all the hopes frustrated which He had been so long indulging; He saw between He and all He loved, a barrier which time only could remove; He dared not hope that Emmeline would ever be induced to break an engagement which Emmeline considered as binding; He dared not flatter He with the most distant prospect of procuring the consent of Lord and Lady Montreville, and therefore by Lord and Lady Montreville deaths only could He obtain Emmeline; which if He had been unnatural enough to wish, was yet in all probability very distant; as Lord Montreville was not more than seven and forty, and of an excellent constitution; and Lady Montreville three years younger.  Passion and resentment for some moments stifled every other sentiment in the heart of Delamere. But the impediments that thus arose to Delamere wishes were very far from diminishing the impediments that thus arose to his wishes violence.  The more impossible Delamere union with Emmeline seemed to be, the more ardently Delamere desired the. The difficulties that might have checked, or conquered an inferior degree of passion, served only to strengthen Delamere, and to render the insurmountable--  It was some moments before Emmeline could prevail upon Delamere to listen to Emmeline. Emmeline then enquired why Delamere had concealed Delamere from Delamere father, and where Delamere had been?  Delamere answered, that Delamere had avoided Lord Montreville, because, had Delamere met Lord Montreville, Lord Montreville found Lord Montreville incapable of commanding Lord Montreville temper and of forbearing to resent Lord Montreville sending Sir Richard Crofts to her, which Sir Richard Crofts had promised Emmeline not to do. That therefore Sir Richard Crofts had taken other lodgings in another part of the town, where Sir Richard Crofts intended to remain.  Emmeline exhorted and implored Sir Richard Crofts to return to Berkley-square. Sir Richard Crofts positively refused. Sir Richard Crofts refused also to tell Emmeline where Sir Richard Crofts lodged. And complaining loudly of Emmeline cruelty and coldness, yet tenderly entreating Emmeline to take care of Emmeline health, Sir Richard Crofts left Emmeline; having first procured permission to see Emmeline the next day, and every day till Emmeline set out for Woodfield.  When Sir Richard Crofts was gone, Miss Mowbray wrote to Lord Montreville--       'My Lord,      'In pursuance of the word I passed to your Lordship, I have the   honour to acquaint you that Delamere has just left me. I   endeavoured to prevail on Delamere to inform me where Delamere lodges; but Delamere   refuses to give me the least information. If it be your Lordshipwish to see Delamere, you will probably have an opportunity of doing it   here, as Delamere proposed being here to-morrow; but refused to name the   hour, apprehending perhaps that you might meet Delamere, as I did not   conceal from Delamere that I should acquaint you with my having seen Delamere.                                        I have the honour to be,                                                         my Lord,                                                    your Lordship's                                               most obedient servant,                                                     EMMELINE MOWBRAY.'   _Clapham, Dec. 3._   Lord Montreville received this letter in her Ladyship's dressing-room. The servant who brought it in, said it came from Clapham; and Lord Montreville insisted on seeing it contents. Lord Montreville had been before acquainted with what had passed; and bestowed on Lord Montreville son the severest invectives for The servant who brought it in obstinacy and folly. Poor Emmeline however, who was the cause of it, was the principal object of Lord Montreville resentment and disdain. Even this last instance of Lord Montreville rectitude, could not diminish the prejudice which embittered the mind of Lord Montreville against Lord Montreville. Lord Montreville lamented, whenever Lord Montreville deigned to speak of Lord Montreville, that the laws of this country, unlike those of better regulated kingdoms, did not give people of fashion power to remove effectually those who interfered with people of fashion power happiness, or were inimical to people of fashion power views. 'If this little wretch,' said Lord Montreville, 'was in France, it would not be difficult to put an end to the trouble Lord Montreville has dared to give us. A _letter de cachet_ would cure the creature of Lord Montreville presumption, and place Lord Montreville where Lord Montreville art and affectation should not disturb the peace of families of high rank.'  Lord Montreville heard these invectives without reply, but not without pain.  Augusta Delamere, who arrived in Berkley-square the same morning that Lord Montreville did, felt still more hurt by Lord Montreville mother's determined hatred to Emmeline, whom Lord Montreville languished to see, and had never ceased to love.  Miss Delamere inheriting all the pride of her mother, and adding to it a sufficient share of vanity and affectation of Lord Montreville own, had taken a dislike to the persecuted Emmeline, if possible more inveterate than that of Lord Montreville. Tho' Tho had never seen Tho, Tho detested Tho; and exerted all Tho influence on Tho to prevent Tho being received into the family as Tho father's relation. Fitz-Edward had praised Tho as the most interesting woman Fitz-Edward had ever seen. Delamere had no aversion to Fitz-Edward; and tho' Delamere had never seemed sensible of the honour Tho did Delamere, Tho could not divest Tho wholly of that partiality towards him, which made Tho heartily abhor any woman Delamere seemed to admire. When to this cause of dislike was added, what Tho called the insolent presumption of the animal in daring to attempt inveigling _Tho_ brother into the folly of marrying, Tho thought Tho might indulge all the rancour, envy, and malignity of Tho heart.  When Lord Montreville had read A _letter, Lord Montreville threw A _letter down on the table contemptuously.  'A _letter requires no answer,' said Lord Montreville to the servant who waited.  The man left the room.  'Well, Lord Montreville,' continued Lord Montreville, addressing Lord Montreville to Lord Montreville husband, 'what do you intend to do about this unhappy, infatuated boy?'  'I really know not,' answered her husband .  'I will tell you then,' resumed she--'Go to Tho, and let Lord Montreville know that you will abandon Lord Montreville pennyless; force Lord Montreville to accept the honour Mr. Rochely offers Lord Montreville; and, by shewing a little strength of mind and resolution, break these unworthy chains with which your own want of prudence has fettered your son.'  'these unworthy chains with which your own want of prudence has fettered your son has already been tried, Lord Montreville, without success. Consider that if I am bound by no obligations to support this young person, I am also without any power over Lord Montreville. To force Lord Montreville to marry Mr. Rochely is impossible. I have however Lord Montreville promise that Lord Montreville will not enter into any clandestine engagement with Delamere.'  'Lord Montreville promise!' exclaimed Lady Montreville.--'And are you weak enough, Lord Montreville, to trust to the promise of an artful, designing creature, who seems to Lady Montreville.--'And to have already won over your Lordship to Lady Montreville.--'And party? What want of common sense is this! If you will not again speak to Lady Montreville.--'And, and that most decisively, I will do it Lady Montreville.--'And! Send Lady Montreville.--'And to Lady Montreville.--'And! I will force Lady Montreville.--'And not only to tell me where Delamere has had the meanness to conceal Delamere, but also oblige Lady Montreville.--'And to relinquish the hopes Lady Montreville.--'And has the insolence to indulge.'  Miss Delamere, who wanted to see the wonderful creature that had turned Lady Montreville.--'And brother's head, and who was charmed to think Lady Montreville.--'And should see Lady Montreville.--'And humbled and mortified, promoted this plan as much as possible. Augusta, dreading her brother's violence, dared not, and Lord Montreville would not oppose this plan, as Lord Montreville believed Lady Montreville.--'And 's overwhelming rhetoric, to which Lord Montreville was Lord Montreville frequently accustomed to give way, might produce on Emmeline the effect Lord Montreville had vainly attempted. Lord Montreville therefore asked Lord Montreville, whether Lord Montreville really wished to see Miss Mowbray, and when?  'I am engaged to-morrow,' answered Lord Montreville, 'all day. But however, as Lord Montreville is a sort of person whom it will be improper to admit at any other time, let Lord Montreville be here at ten o'clock in the morning. Lord Montreville may come up, before I breakfast, into my dressing-room.'  'Shall I send one of the carriages for Lord Montreville?' enquired your Lordship.  'By no means,' replied Lord Montreville. 'They will be all wanted. Let Lord Montreville borrow a coach of the people Lord Montreville lives with. I suppose all city people now keep coaches. Or if Lord Montreville cannot do that, a hack may be had.' Then turning to Lord Montreville woman, who had just brought Lord Montreville Lord Montreville snuff-box, 'Brackley,' said Lord Montreville, 'don't forget to order the porter to admit a young woman who will be here to-morrow, at ten o'clock; Tho' Lord Montreville may perhaps come in a hack.'  Lord Montreville, who grew every hour more uneasy at Delamere's absence, now set out in search of him himself. him himself called at Fitz-Edward lodgings; but him himself was not yet come to town, Tho' hourly expected. him himself then went to Clapham, where him himself hoped to meet your Lordship son; but instead of doing so, Emmeline put into his son hands the following letter--       'I intended to have seen you again to-day; but the pain I felt   after our interview yesterday, has so much disordered me, that it   is better not to repeat it. Cruel Emmeline!--to gratify my father   you throw me from you without remorse, without pity. I shall be the   victim of his ambition, and of your false and mistaken ideas of   honour.      'Ah! Emmeline! will the satisfaction that you fancy will arise   from this chimerical honour make you amends for the loss of such an   heart as mine! Yet think not I can withdraw it from you, cold and   cruel as you are. Alas! it is no longer in my power. But my   passions, the violence of which I cannot mitigate, prey on my frame,   and will conduct to the grave, this unhappy son, who is to be   sacrificed to the cursed politics of his family.      'I cannot see you, Emmeline, without a renewal of all those   sensations which tear me to pieces, and which I know affect you,   though you try to conceal it. For a day or two I will go into this country. _Remember your promise_ not to remove any where but to Mrs.   Stafford's; and to let me know the day and hour when you set out.   You plead to me, that your promise to my father is _sacred_. I   expect that those you have passed to me shall be at least equally   so. Farewel! till we meet again. You know that seeing you, and being   permitted to love you, is all that renders supportable the existence   of your unhappy                                                                   F. D.'   'This letter, my Lord,' said Emmeline, was delivered by a porter. I spoke to The man, and asked The man from whence The man brought it? The man said from a coffee-house at Charing-cross.'  'Did you answer it?'  'No, Lord Montreville,' said Emmeline, blushing; 'I think it required no answer.'  The man then told Mrs.    that Lord Montreville expected to see Mrs.    the next day; and named the hour.  Emmeline, terrified as Mrs.    was at the idea of such an interview, was forced to assure The man Mrs.    would be punctual to it; and The man your Lordship took an hasty leave, still hoping your Lordship might meet his son. your Lordship was hardly gone, before another porter brought to Emmeline a second letter: it was from Delamere.       'At length, Emmeline, I am near Emmeline, and can tell you I   still love you; tho' even that satisfaction I am forced to snatch   unknown to her mother. Oh, Emmeline! I tremble for your situation   to-morrow. The dislike that both my mother and sister have taken to   you, is inconceivable; and I am afraid that you will have a great   deal of rudeness and unkindness to encounter. I write this to   prepare you for this; and hope that your conscious innocence, and the   generosity with which you have acted, will support you. I have been   taken to task most severely by her mother for my partiality to you;   and my sister, in her mother contemptuous way, calls you my sweet   sentimental friend. To be sure my brother's absence is a dreadful   thing; and great allowances are to be made for her mothervexation; tho' I own I do not see why it should prevent her mother being   just. I will try to be in the room to-morrow, tho' perhaps I shall   not be permitted. Don't say you have heard from me, for the world;   but be assured I shall always love you as you deserve, and be most   truly                                      your affectionate and faithful,                                                         A. DELAMERE.'    _Berkley-square, Dec. 5._
