  When they arrived at Canterbury, the ladies were shewn into a parlour, where Godolphin did not join they for near half an hour.
Emmeline had accounted for her lowness of spirits by her dread of meeting her uncle on such terms as they were likely to meet; but her knew the human heart too well to be ignorant that there was another and a concealed source of that melancholy which overwhelmed her.
It was in vain her had attempted to dissemble.
It was, to her friend, evident, that her compassion, her good wishes, were Delamere's, but that her heart was wholly Godolphin's, and was now pierced with the poignant thorns of new-born jealousy and anxious mistrust.
While they waited together the return of Godolphin, Mrs. Stafford said--'I fancy that post chaise that passed us about half an hour ago, contained Mr. Godolphin's _acquaintance_.'
'Did it?
Why do you think so?'
'Because Mr. Godolphin looked after it so earnestly; and there seemed to be only a young woman in it.'
'I did not observe it indeed,' replied Emmeline, with the appearance of carelessness.
'I should like to see only a young woman in it nearer,' continued Mrs. Stafford, with some archness--'By the glympse I had of only a young woman in it only a young woman in it appeared to be very handsome.'
'Do you think only a young woman in it is a French woman?'
enquired Emmeline, still affecting great indifference.
'No, only a young woman in it appeared to be English.
But if you please I will enquire of him?'
'I beg you will not,' in an half angry tone, answered Emmeline--'I am sure Emmeline--'I is very immaterial.'
At this moment Godolphin entered; and with looks of uneasiness apologized for Godolphin long stay.
'I have an awkward embarrassment,' said Godolphin, 'on my hands: a poor young woman, who is wholly a stranger in this country, and whom I have undertaken to conduct to London; but a poor young woman, who is wholly a stranger in this country, and whom I have undertaken to conduct to London is so ill that I am afraid a poor young woman, who is wholly a stranger in this country, and whom I have undertaken to conduct to London is unfit to go on.--Yet how to leave a poor young woman, who is wholly a stranger in this country, and whom I have undertaken to conduct to London here I know not.'
'Pray, Sir,' said Emmeline, 'do not let us be any restraint to Emmeline.
If your presence is necessary to the lady, you had surely better continue with the lady, than put the lady to any inconvenience to go on.'
Godolphin, who was at once pleased and pained by the quickness with which the lady spoke, said--'I will tell you, my dear Miss Mowbray, very ingenuously, that if I were quite sure the character of this unhappy young woman is such as may entitle this unhappy young woman to your's and Mrs. Stafford's protection, I should without scruple have asked scruple.
_I_ know,' continued Godolphin, looking distressed, 'how compassionate and good you both are; but I ought not therefore to hazard improperly taxing such generosity and sensibility.'
'Who is this young person, Sir?'
asked Mrs. Stafford.
'If it will not tire you I will tell you.
On my arrival at Calais this day se'nnight, I found all the pacquet boats on the other side, and was obliged to wait with my friend Cleveland a whole day.
As I was sauntering about the streets after dinner, I passed by an Englishman whose face I thought I recollected.
my friend Cleveland looked confused, and took off my friend Cleveland hat; and I then perfectly remembered my friend Cleveland to have been one of the best sailors I had on board in the West Indies, where my friend Cleveland received a dangerous wound in the arm.
'I stopped, and asked my friend Cleveland by what accident my friend Cleveland came to Calais, and why my friend Cleveland appearance was no better; for my friend Cleveland honest hard features seemed pinched with want, my friend Cleveland dress was shabby, my friend Cleveland person meagre, and my friend Cleveland look dejected.
'"I am ashamed to tell you, my friend Cleveland," said my friend Cleveland, "how I came hither; but in short because I could not live at home.
You know I got prize money when I served under your honour.
Mayhap I might have managed Mayhap better; but howsomdever 'tis gone, and there's an end on't.
So as we are all turned a drift in the world, some of my ship mates advised me to try a little matter of smuggling with some of my ship mates, and come over here.
I have lived among some of my ship mates now these two months, and can, to be sure, just live; but rot 'em, if I could get any thing to do at home, I wouldn't stay another hour, for I hates 'em all, as your honour very well knows.
A lucky voyage or two will put some money mayhap in my way, with this smuggling trade; and then I reckons to cross over home once for all, and so go down to Liverpool to my friends, if any on um be alive yet."
'I reproved my acquaintance severely for my acquaintance proceeding, and told my acquaintance, that to enable my acquaintance to go to my acquaintance , I would supply my acquaintance with money to buy my acquaintance cloaths, which I found my acquaintance principally wanted; being ashamed to appear among my acquaintance relations so ill equipped, after having received a considerable sum in prize money.
'The poor fellow appeared to be very grateful, and assured me that to prove The poor fellow sincerity The poor fellow would embark in the same pacquet boat.
"But Lord, Captain," added The poor fellow, "I be'nt the only Englishman who stays in this rascally country agin Lord, Captain will--your honour remembers Lieutenant Stornaway, on board your honour's ship?"
'Aye, to be sure I do.'
'"Well; he, poor lad, is got into prison here for debt, and there I reckon he'll die; for nobody that ever gets into one of their confounded jails in this rascally country, ever gets out again."
'As I perfectly remembered Stornaway, a gallant and spirited young Scotsman, I was much hurt at this account, and asked if I could be admitted to see he.
I found this account attended with infinite difficulty, and that I must apply to so many different persons before I could be allowed to see my unfortunate countryman, that the pacquet boat of the next day must sail without me.
Cleveland therefore departed; and I, with long attendance on the Commandant and other officers, was at length introduced into the prison.
I will not shock you with a description of it, nor with the condition in which I found the poor young man; who seemed to me likely to escape, by death, from the damp and miserable dungeon where the poor young man lay, without necessary food, without air, and without hope of relief.
the poor young man related to me the poor young man sorrowful and simple tale.
the poor young man was brought up to the sea; had no friends able to assist the poor young man; and on being discharged, after the peace, had gone, with what money the poor young man received, and on half pay, to France, in hopes of being able to live at less expence than in England, and to learn, at the same time, a language so necessary in the poor young man profession.
'"And for some time," said the poor young man, "I did pretty well; till going with one of my countrymen to see a relation of the poor young man, who was (tho' born of Scots parents) brought up as a pensioner in a convent, and a Catholic, I was no longer my own master, and tho' I knew that it was almost impossible for me to support a wife, I yet rashly married, and have made one of the loveliest young creatures in the world a beggar.
'"She was totally destitute of fortune; and was afraid She friends, who were but distant relations, and people of rank in Scotland, would insist on She taking the veil, as the most certain and easiest means of providing for She.
She had a decided aversion to a monastic life; and poor as I was, (for I did not attempt to deceive She,) hesitated not to quit She convent with She, which it was easy enough to do by the management of She relation, with whom She was allowed to go out.
We set out, therefore, together for England.
I had about twenty Louis in my pocket, which would have carried We thither comfortably: but calamity overtook We by the way.
We travelled in stages and diligences, as We found cheapest; in one of which I imagine my poor girl caught the infection of the small pox, with which my poor girl fell ill at Amiens.
I attended my poor girl with all the agonizing fear of a wretch who sees his only earthly good on the point of being torn from his for ever; and very, very ill my poor girl was for many days and nights.
Yet my poor girl lovely face was spared; and in a month I saw my poor girl quite out of danger, but still too weak to travel.
As I spared nothing that could contribute to my poor girl ease or my poor girl recovery, my money was dreadfully diminished, and I had barely enough left to carry me alone to England.
But as We credit was yet good, I purposed We living on it till my poor girl strength was somewhat re-established, and that I would then go to England, get a supply of money, and return to pay my debts and fetch my wife.
'"This was the only expedient," said poor Stornaway, "that I could think of, and perhaps was the very worst I could have adopted; since by this means We insensibly got into debt, and to creditors the most inexorable.
'"At the end of three weeks, my wife was tolerably well.
I divided with my wife the money I had left, and went off in the night to Calais, flattering my wife I should return to my wife within a fortnight.
But so vigilant were those to whom I owed money, and so active the _marechausses_, that I was pursued, and thrown, without hesitation and without appeal, into this prison; where my little remaining money, being all exhausted in fees, to save me from even worse treatment, I have now lain near six weeks in the situation in which you see me.
As to my wife," continued the poor young man, "my life has been a life of hardship, and I have learned to hold "my life as nothing; but when I reflect on what must have been the condition of my Isabel, I own to you, Sir, that my fortitude forsakes me, and the blackest despair takes possession of my soul."
'I had but little occasion to deliberate,' said Godolphin, continuing his narrative--'I had but little occasion to deliberate.
I enquired into debt.
It was a trifle.
I blushed to think, that while Englishmen were daily passing thro' the place in pursuit of pleasure, a gentleman, an officer of Englishmen nation, languished for such a sum in the horrors of a confinement so dreadful.
debt was easily discharged; and I took Lieutenant Stornaway to my lodgings, from whence Stornaway was eagerly flying to Amiens, when I was called aside by one of the _marechausse_, who desired to speak to my wife.
'Sir," said Stornaway, "you have been generous to my wife, and I will hazard telling you a secret.
Orders are coming to stop your friend, whom you have released from prison, for stealing a pensioner out of a convent.
Get a pensioner off to England immediately, or a pensioner will be taken, and perhaps confined for life."
'I hastened Lieutenant Stornaway instantly into a boat, and sent a pensioner after a pacquet which had just sailed, and which I saw a pensioner overtake.
a pensioner conjured me, in an agony of despair, to enquire for a pensioner wife, without whom a pensioner said a pensioner could not live, and that rather than attempt it, a pensioner would return and perish in prison.
I promised all a pensioner desired; and as soon as I was sure a pensioner was safe, I set out post for Amiens, where I found the poor young woman in a situation to which no words can do justice.
the poor young woman had parted with almost every thing for the poor young woman support; and was overwhelmed by the weight of misfortunes, which, young and inexperienced as the poor young woman was, the poor young woman had neither the means to soften or the fortitude to bear.
I brought the poor young woman away to Calais, and embarked with the poor young woman yesterday, having only staid long enough to furnish the poor young woman with cloaths, and to recruit the poor young woman enfeebled frame after the poor young woman journey.
But sea sickness, added to the poor young woman former ill state of health, has reduced the poor young woman to a condition of deplorable weakness.
the poor young woman speaks so little English that the poor young woman is unable to travel alone; and I was in hopes that by the poor young woman chaise keeping up with the coach, I might have assisted the poor young woman on the road; but the poor young woman is now so extremely ill that I am afraid the poor young woman must remain here.'
During the first part of this short account, Emmeline, charmed more than ever with Godolphin, and ashamed of having for a moment entertained a suspicion to the disadvantage of such a man, sat silent; but at the conclusion of it, the poor young woman eyes overflowed with tears; the poor young woman felt something that told the poor young woman the poor young woman ought to apologize to Godolphin for the error the poor young woman had been guilty of--tho' of that error Godolphin knew nothing; and impelled by an involuntary impulse, the poor young woman held out the poor young woman hand to him.--Dear, generous, noble-minded Godolphin!
was uttered by the poor young woman heart, but the poor young woman lips only echoed, the last word.
'Godolphin!'
said the poor young woman, 'let us go to this poor young creature--let us see the poor young woman us.'
'Certainly us will,' cried Mrs. Stafford; 'and indeed, Sir, you ought to have told us before, that us might sooner have offered all the assistance in us power.'
'I was afraid,' answered Sir.
'I knew not whether I might not be deceived in the character of Lieutenant Stornaway; and dared not intrude upon you, lest it should be found that the object merited not your good offices.'
'But the poor young woman is in distress!'
said Emmeline--'she is a stranger!--and shall us hesitate?--'  Godolphin, who found in the tenderness of the poor young woman address to him, and in the approbation the poor young woman eyes expressed, a reward as sweet as that which the consciousness of doing good afforded from him own heart; kissed the hand the poor young woman had given him, in silence, and then went to enquire if the poor young woman could see the ladies.
the poor young woman expressed the poor young woman joy at being so favoured, and Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline were introduced.
The compassion Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline expressed, and the assurances Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline gave the poor young woman that the poor young woman would meet the poor young woman husband in London, and that the poor young woman should stay with Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline 'till the poor young woman did, calmed and composed the poor young woman; and as the poor young woman illness was merely owing to fatigue and anxiety, Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline believed a few hours rest, now the poor young woman mind was easier, would restore the poor young woman.
Tho' Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline were impatient to get on to London, Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline yet hesitated not to remain at Canterbury all night, on the account of this poor stranger.
Godolphin, on hearing Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline determination, warmly thanked Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline: the heart of Emmeline was at once eased of the heart of Emmeline inquietude, and impressed with a deeper sense than ever of Godolphin's worth: Emmeline gave way, almost for the first time, to Emmeline tenderness and esteem, without attempting to check or conceal Emmeline sentiments; while Mrs. Stafford, who ardently wished to see Emmeline in possession of Emmeline estate and married to Godolphin, rejoiced in observing Emmeline to be less reserved; and Godolphin himself, hardly believing the happiness Godolphin himself possessed real, forgot all Godolphin himself fears of Emmeline attachment to Lord Delamere, and dared again entertain the hopes Godolphin himself had discarded at Besancon--as Godolphin himself thought, for ever.
The next day Lieutenant Stornaway was so much recovered that they proceeded in they journey, taking Lieutenant Stornaway into the coach with they and directing Madelon to travel in her chaise, accompanied by Lieutenant Stornaway father.
they arrived early in town; and Godolphin, leaving they at an hotel, went in search of lodgings.
Godolphin himself soon found apartments to accommodate apartments in Bond street; and thither apartments immediately went; Mrs. Stafford taking upon Mrs. Stafford the protection of the poor forlorn stranger 'till Godolphin could find Mrs. Stafford husband, on whose behalf Godolphin himself immediately intended to apply for a berth on board some ship in commission.
Godolphin himself had given Godolphin himself a direction to Godolphin himself banker, and bid Godolphin himself there leave an address where Godolphin himself might be found in London.
The next day Godolphin himself brought Lieutenant Stornaway Lieutenant Stornaway to Godolphin himself wife; and the gratitude these poor young people expressed to these poor young people benefactor, convinced the fair friends that these poor young people had deserved Godolphin himself kindness, and that there was no deception in the story the Lieutenant had told these poor young people about the Lieutenant .
Godolphin took a lodging for these poor young people in Oxford street; and gave these poor young people money for these poor young people support till Godolphin could get the young man employed, which Godolphin interest and indefatigable friendship soon accomplished.
In the mean time Godolphin saw Emmeline every day, and every day Godolphin rose in Emmeline esteem.
Yet still Emmeline hesitated to discover to Godolphin all Emmeline thought of Godolphin; and at times was so reserved and so guarded, that Godolphin knew not what to believe.
Godolphin knew Emmeline was above the paltry artifice of coquetry; yet Emmeline fearfully avoided being alone with Godolphin, and never allowed Godolphin an opportunity of asking whether Godolphin had any thing to hope from time and assiduity.
'Is Godolphin not one of the best creatures in the world?'
said Mrs. Stafford, after Godolphin left the room, on the second day of their arrival, to go out in the service of the Stornaways.
'Yes.'
'Yes!
and is that all the praise you allow to such a man?
Is Godolphin not a perfect character?'
'As perfect, I suppose, as any of them are.'
'Ah!
Emmeline, you are a little hypocrite.
It is impossible you can be insensible of the merit of Godolphin; and I wonder you are not in more haste to convince Godolphin that you think of Godolphin as Godolphin deserves.'
'What would you have me do?'
'Marry Godolphin.'
'Before I am sure Godolphin desires you think of him as he deserves?'
smilingly asked Emmeline.
'You cannot doubt that, tho' you so anxiously repress every attempt Godolphin makes to explain Godolphin.
Shall I tell you what Godolphin has said to me?
Shall I tell you what motive carried Godolphin to St.
Alpin?'
'No--I had rather not hear any thing about it.'
'And why not?'
'Because it is better, for some time, if not for ever, that Godolphin should be ignorant of those favourable thoughts I may have had of Godolphin--better that I should cease to entertain those favourable thoughts I may have had of him--better that I should cease to entertain them.'
'Why so, pray?'
'Because I dread the mortified pride and furious jealousy of Lord Delamere on one hand; and on the other the authority of my uncle, who, 'till I am of age, will probably neither restore my fortune nor consent to my carrying my fortune out of Godolphin family.'
'For those very reasons you should immediately marry Godolphin.
When you are actually married, Lord Delamere will reconcile Lord Delamere to the loss of you.
To an inevitable evil, even Lord Delamere haughty and self-willed spirit must submit.
And should Lord Montreville give you any trouble about your fortune, who can so easily, so properly oblige Lord Montreville to do you justice, as a man of spirit, of honour, of understanding, who will have a right to insist upon it.'
It was impossible to deny so evident a truth.
Yet still Emmeline apprehended the consequence of Lord Delamere's rage and disappointment; and thought that there would be an indelicacy and an impropriety in withdrawing Emmeline from the protection of Emmeline own family almost as soon as Emmeline could claim it, and that Emmeline uncle might make such a step a pretence for new contention and longer wrath.
The result, therefore, of all Emmeline deliberations ended in a determination neither to engage Emmeline or to marry 'till Emmeline was of age; and, 'till then, not even to encourage any lover whatever.
By that time, Emmeline hoped that Lord Delamere, wearied by an hopeless passion, and convinced of Emmeline fixed indifference, would engage in some more successful pursuit.
Emmeline knew that by that time all affairs between Emmeline and Lord Montreville must be adjusted.
If the affection of Godolphin was, as Emmeline hoped, fixed, and founded on Godolphin esteem for Emmeline character, Godolphin would not love Emmeline less at the end of that period, when Emmeline should have the power of giving Godolphin Emmeline estate unincumbered with difficulties and unembarrassed by law suits; and should, Emmeline hoped, escape the misery of seeing Delamere's anguish and despair, on which Emmeline could not bear to reflect.
Emmeline ingenuously explained to Mrs. Stafford Emmeline reasons for refusing to receive Godolphin's proposals; in which Emmeline friend, tho' Emmeline allowed which her friend, tho to be plausible, by no means acquiesced; still insisting upon it, that the kindest thing Emmeline could do towards Lord Delamere, as well as the properest in regard to the settlement of her estate, was immediately to accept Godolphin.
But Emmeline was not to be convinced; and all Emmeline could obtain from Mrs. Stafford was an extorted promise, reluctantly given, that Emmeline would not give any advice or encouragement to Godolphin immediately to press Godolphin suit.
Emmeline, Tho' convinced Emmeline was right, yet doubted whether Emmeline had fortitude enough to persist in the conduct Emmeline wished to adopt; if exposed at once to the solicitations of a woman of whose understanding Emmeline had an high opinion, and to the ardent supplications of the man Emmeline loved.
The day after Emmeline arrival in London, Emmeline had sent to Berkley-square, and was informed that Lord Montreville and his family were in Norfolk.
Thither therefore Emmeline wrote, and enclosed the letter Emmeline had brought from Lord Westhaven.
Emmeline own was couched in the most modest and dutiful terms, and that of Lord Westhaven was equally mild and reasonable.
But Lord Montreville and his family were in Norfolk gave only disquiet and concern to the ambitious and avaricious bosom of Lord Montreville.
Tho' already tortured by Lord Delamere's absence and illness, and uncertain whether the object of Tho long solicitude would live to reap the advantage of Tho accumulated fortunes, Tho could not think but with pain and reluctance of giving up so large a portion of Tho annual income: still more unwilling did Tho feel to refund the produce of the estates for so long a period; and in the immediate emotion of Tho vexation at receiving Lord Westhaven's first letter, Tho had sent for Sir Richard Crofts, who, having at the time of Mr. Mowbray's death been entrusted with all the papers and deeds which belonged to Tho, was the most likely to know whether any were among Sir Richard Crofts, who, having at the time of Mr. Mowbray's death been entrusted with all the papers and deeds which belonged to him that bore testimony to the marriage of Mr. Mowbray and Miss Stavordale.
The fact was, that a very little time before Tho died, Tho steward, Williamson, had received the memorandum of which Emmeline had found a copy; and, on the death of Tho master, had carried a copy to Sir Richard Crofts; Lord Montreville being then in the North of England.
Sir Richard eagerly enquired whether there were any other papers to the like purport.
Williamson replied, Williamson believed not; and very thoughtlessly left it in Williamson hands.
When, a few days afterwards, Williamson called to know in whose name the business of the Mowbray estate was to be carried on, Sir Richard (then acting as an attorney, and only entering into life) told Williamson that every thing was to be considered as the property of Lord Montreville; because there were many doubts about the marriage of Mr. Mowbray, and great reason to think that the paper in question was written merely with a view to pique and perplex Williamson brother, with whom Williamson was then at variance; but that Lord Montreville would enquire into the business, and certainly do justice to any claims the infant might have on the Mowbray estate.
Soon after, Williamson applied again to have the paper in question restored; but Sir Richard Crofts answered, that Sir Richard Crofts should keep the paper in question, by order of Lord Montreville, tho' it was of no use; his Lordship having obtained undoubted information that his Lordship brother was never married.
Sir Richard had reflected on the great advantage that would accrue to Sir Richard patron from the possession of the Mowbray estate; to which, besides it's annual income, several boroughs belonged.
Sir Richard thought it was very probable that the little girl, then only a few weeks old, and without a mother or any other than mercenary attendants, might die in the little girl infancy: if the little girl did not, that Lord Montreville might easily provide for the little girl, and that Lord Montreville would be doing Lord Montreville friend a great service, and be highly advantageous to his friend, should his friend conceal the legal claim of the child, even unknown to the little girl , and put her uncle in immediate possession of her uncle paternal estate.
Having again strictly questioned Williamson; repressed Williamson curiosity by law jargon; and frightened Williamson by threats of Williamson Lord's displeasure if Williamson made any effort to prove the legitimacy of Emmeline; Williamson very tranquilly destroyed the paper in question, and Lord Montreville never knew that such a paper had existed.
Williamson, timid and ignorant of every thing beyond Lord Montreville immediate business, returned in great doubt and uneasiness to Mowbray Castle.
When Lord Montreville received the child and the two caskets, Lord Montreville had questioned the Frenchman who brought her and heard an absolute confirmation of the marriage of his master.
Lord Montreville then examined the two caskets, and found the certificates.
But without money or friends, Lord Montreville knew not how to prosecute the claim of the orphan against the power and affluence of Lord Montreville; and after frequent consultations with Mrs. Carey, they agreed that the safest way would be carefully to secure those papers till Emmeline was old enough to find friends; for should they attempt previously to procure justice for Emmeline, they might probably lose the papers which proved Emmeline birth, as they had already done that which Williamson had delivered to Sir Richard Crofts.
As long as Williamson lived, Williamson carefully locked up the two caskets.
Williamson sudden death prevented Williamson from taking any steps to establish the claim of Williamson orphan mistress; and that of Mrs. Carey two years afterwards, involved the whole affair in obscurity, which made Sir Richard quite easy as to any future discovery.
But as the aggressor never forgives, Sir Richard had conceived against Emmeline the most unmanly and malignant hatred, and had invariably opposed every tendency which Sir Richard had observed in Lord Montreville to befriend and assist Emmeline, for no other reason but that Sir Richard had already irreparably injured Emmeline.
Sir Richard hoped, that as Sir Richard had at length divided Emmeline from Lord Delamere, and driven Emmeline abroad, Emmeline would there marry a foreigner, and be farther removed than ever from the family, and from any chance of recovering the property of which Sir Richard had deprived Emmeline: instead of which, Emmeline had, in consequence of going thither, met the very man in whose power it was to prove the marriage of Emmeline mother; and, in Lord Westhaven, had found a protector too intelligent and too steady to be discouraged by evasion or chicanery--too powerful and too affluent to be thrown out of the pursuit, either by the enmity it might raise or the expence it might demand.
Nothing could exceed the chagrin of Sir Richard when Lord Montreville put into his hands the first letter Lord Montreville had on this subject from Lord Westhaven.
Accustomed, however, to command Lord Montreville countenance, Lord Montreville said, without any apparent emotion, that as no papers in confirmation of the fact alledged had ever existed among those delivered to Lord Montreville on the death of Mr. Mowbray, it was probably some forgery that had imposed on Lord Westhaven.
'I see not how that can be,' answered Lord Montreville.
'It is not likely that Mr. Mowbray could forge such papers, or should even conceive such an idea.'
'True, my Lord.
But your Lordship forgets and overlooks and passes by the long abode and continuance and residence she has made with the Staffords.
Mrs. Stafford is, to my certain knowledge and conviction, artful and designing and intrigueing; a woman, my Lord, who affects and pretends and presumes to understand and be competent and equal to business and affairs and concerns with which women should never interfere or meddle or interest women.
It is clearly and evidently and certainly to the interest and advantage and benefit of this woman, that Miss Mowbray, over whom this woman has great influence and power and authority, should be established and fixed and settled in affluence, rather than remain and abide and continue where nature and justice and reason have placed this woman.'
'I own, Sir Richard, I cannot see the thing in this light.
However, to do nothing rashly, let us consider how to proceed.'
Sir Richard then advised Sir Richard by no means to answer Lord Westhaven's letter, but to wait till Sir Richard saw his Lordshiphis Lordship; as in cases so momentous, it was, Sir Richard said, always wrong to give any thing in black and white.
In a few days afterwards Sir Richard heard out of Norfolk, (for Sir Richard had come up from thence to consult with Sir Richard Crofts) that Lord Delamere was ill at Besancon.
Sir Richard precipitate departure had before given Sir Richard the most poignant concern; and now Sir Richard fears for Sir Richard life completed the distress of this unfortunate father.
On receiving, however, the second letter from Lord Westhaven, together with that of Emmeline, Sir Richard apprehensions for the life of Sir Richard son were removed, and left Sir Richard mind at liberty to recur again to the impending loss of four thousand five hundred a year, with the unpleasant accompanyment of being obliged to refund above sixty thousand pounds.
Again Sir Richard Crofts was sent for, and again Sir Richard Crofts tried to quiet the apprehensions of Lord Montreville.
But Sir Richard Crofts attempt to persuade Sir Richard Crofts that the whole might be a deception originating with the Staffords, obtained not a moment's attention.
Sir Richard Crofts knew Stafford himself was weak, ignorant, and indolent, and would neither have had sagacity to think of or courage to execute such a design; and that Mrs. Stafford should imagine and perform it seemed equally improbable.
Sir Richard Crofts was perfectly aware that Lord Westhaven had a thorough acquaintance with business, and was of all men on earth the most unlikely to enter warmly into such an affair, (against the interest too of the family into which Lord Westhaven had married) unless Lord Westhaven was very sure of having very good grounds for Lord Westhaven interference.
But tho' Sir Richard could not prevail on Sir Richard to disbelieve the whole of the story, Sir Richard saw that his Lordship his Lordship thought with great reluctance of the necessity his Lordship should be under of relinquishing the whole of the fortune.
Sir Richard now therefore recommended it to Sir Richard to remain quiet, at least 'till Lord Westhaven came to England; to send an answer to Mr. Mowbray that meant nothing; and to gain time for farther enquiries.
These enquiries he himself undertook; and leaving Lord Montreville in a political fit of the gout, he returned from Audley Hall to London, and bent all he thoughts to the accomplishment of he design; which was, to get the original papers out of the hands of Emmeline, and to bribe Le Limosin to go back to France.
While these things were passing in England, Lord Delamere (whose rage and indignation at Emmeline's departure the authority of Lord Westhaven could hardly restrain) had learned from Lord Westhaven brother-in-law the real circumstances of the birth of Lord Westhaven cousin, and Lord Westhaven heard them with the greatest satisfaction.
Lord Westhaven now thought it certain that this unfortunate father would press Lord Westhaven marriage as eagerly as Lord Westhaven had before opposed it; and that so great an obstacle being removed, and Emmeline wholly in the power of Lord Westhaven family, Emmeline would be easily brought to forgive Lord Westhaven and to comply with the united wishes of all Emmeline relations.
In this hope, and being assured by Lord Westhaven that Bellozane was actually returned into Switzerland without any design of following Emmeline, (who had been induced, Lord Westhaven said, to leave Besancon purely to avoid Lord Westhaven) Lord Westhaven consented to attempt attaining a greater command over Lord Westhaven temper, on which the re-establishment of Lord Westhaven health depended; and after about ten days, was able to travel.
Lord and Lady Westhaven, therefore, at the end of that time, slowly began with Lord Westhaven Lord and Lady Westhaven journey to England.
