  His Lordship told   His Lordship that Lady Westhaven had been less alarmed at the account   His Lordship had given Lady Westhaven of Delamere than   His Lordship had apprehended; and that Lady Westhaven was preparing to begin   His Lordship journey towards   His Lordship immediately after breakfast.  'I must send,' continued   His Lordship, 'Miss Mowbray to Lady Westhaven; who is, I understand, already up and walking.'  Bellozane then informed Bellozane Lordship of what Bellozane knew of Emmeline. But Godolphin was silent: Godolphin dared not trust Godolphin with speaking much of Emmeline; Godolphin dared not relate Emmeline illness, lest the cause of it should be enquired into. 'Does Miss Mowbray go with my sister?' asked Miss Mowbray.  'That I know not,' replied Lady Westhaven. 'Augusta will very reluctantly go without Lady Westhaven. Yet Lady Westhaven situation in regard to Lord Delamere is such'--He ceased speaking; looked embarrassed; and, soon after, the Chevalier quitting the room, before whom civility would not allow whom to converse long in English, and to whom his Lordship thought his Lordship had no right to reveal the real situation of Emmeline, while it yet remained unknown to others, his Lordship related to his Lordship brother the circumstances of the discovery that had been made of Emmeline birth, and of Emmeline consequent claim to the Mowbray estate.  Godolphin, who would, from the obscurest indigence, have chosen Emmeline in preference to all other women, heard this account with pleasure, only as supposing that independance might be grateful to Emmeline sensibility, and affluence favourable to the liberality of Emmeline spirit. But the satisfaction he derived from these reflections, was embittered and nearly destroyed, when he considered, that Emmeline acquiring so large a fortune would make Emmeline alliance eagerly sought by the very persons who had before scorned and rejected Emmeline; and that all the family would unite in persuading Emmeline to forgive Delamere, the more especially as this would be the only means to keep in this the Mowbray estate, and to preclude the necessity of refunding the income which had been received for so many years, and which now amounted to a great sum of money. When the pressing instances of all her own family, and particularly of Lady Westhaven, whom her so tenderly loved, were added to the affection he believed her had invariably felt for Delamere, he thought it impossible that her pride, however it might have been piqued by the desertion of her lover, could make any effort against a renewal of her engagement; and he own hopes, which he had never cherished till he was convinced Delamere had given her up, and which had been weakened by her apparent affection for he, were by this last event again so nearly annihilated, that, no longer conscious he retained any, he fancied he condemned still to love, serve, and adore the object of he passion, without making any effort to secure it's success, or being permitted to appear otherwise than as her friend. he was vexed that he had been unguardedly explicit, in telling her that he had ever indulged those hopes at all; since he now feared it would be the means of depriving her conversation and her manner, when they were together, of that charming frankness, of which, tho' it rivetted he chains and encreased he torments, he could not bear to be deprived. Melancholy and desponding, he continued long silent after Lord Westhaven ceased speaking. Suddenly, however, awakening from he reverie, he said--'Does your Lordship think Miss Mowbray _ought_ to go to meet Lord Westhaven?'  'Upon my word I know not how to advise: my wife is miserable without my wife, and fancies the sight of my wife will immediately restore Lord Westhaven. On the other hand, I believe Emmeline herself will with reluctance take a step that will perhaps, appear like forcing Emmeline herself into the notice of a man from whom Emmeline herself has received an affront which it is hardly in female nature to forgive.'  They were now interrupted by Bellozane, who flew about the house in evident uneasiness and confusion. a man from whom she has received an affront which it is hardly in female nature to forgive did not yet know how Emmeline herself was to be disposed of: a man from whom she has received an affront which it is hardly in female nature to forgive saw that Lord Westhaven was Lord Westhaven uncertain of Lord Westhaven; and Lord Westhaven had been applying for information to Le Limosin and Madelon, who had yet received no orders to prepare for Emmeline herself departure.  While Emmeline herself had created in the bosoms of others so much anxiety, Emmeline herself was Emmeline herself tortured with the cruellest uncertainty. Unable to resolve how Emmeline herself ought to act, Emmeline herself had yet determined on nothing, when Lord Westhaven sent for Emmeline herself, who, as soon as Emmeline herself entered the room, Emmeline herself, are you not preparing for our journey?'  'How can I, dearest Emmeline herself--how can I, with any propriety, go where Lord Delamere is? After the separation which has now so decidedly and irrevocably taken place between our, shall I intrude again on Lord Delamere Lordship's sight? and solicit a return of that regard with which I most sincerely wish Lord Delamere had forborne to honour me?'  'You are piqued, my lovely friend; and I own with great reason. But Mr. Godolphin has undoubtedly told you that poor Frederic is truly penitent; that Mr. Godolphin has taken our journey merely to deprecate your just anger and to solicit Mr. Godolphin pardon. Will my Emmeline, generous and gentle as she is to others, be inexorable only to Mr. Godolphin? Besides, my sweet coz, pray consider a moment, what else can you do? You certainly would not wish to stay here? Surely you would not travel alone to St. Germains. And let me add my own hopes that you will not quit me now, when poor FredericFrederic's illness, and my own precarious health, make your company not merely pleasant but necessary.'  'That is indeed a consideration which must have great force with me. When Lady Westhaven commands, how shall I disobey, even tho' to obey be directly contrary to my judgment and my wishes.'  'Commands, my dear friend,' very gravely, and with an air of chagrin, said Lady Westhaven Ladyship, 'are neither for me to give or for you to receive. Certainly if you are so determined against going with me, I must submit. But I did not indeed think that Emmeline, however the brother may have offended Emmeline, would thus have resented it to the sister.'  'I should be a monster, Lady Westhaven,' (hardly was Emmeline able to restrain Emmeline tears as Emmeline spoke,)--'was I a moment capable of forgetting all I owe you. But do you really think I _ought_ again to put myself in the way of Lord Delamere--again to renew all the family contention which Lord Delamere very unfortunate partiality for myself has already occasioned; and again to hazard being repulsed with contempt by the Marquis, and still more probably by the Marchioness of Montreville. My lot has hitherto been humble: I have learned to submit to it, if not without regret, at least with calmness and resignation; yet pardon me if I say, that however unhappy my fortune, there is still something due to myself; and if I again make myself liable to the humiliation of being _refused_, I shall feel that I am degraded in mind, as much as I have been in circumstances, and lost to that proper pride to which innocence and rectitude has in the lowest indigence a right, and which cannot be relinquished but with the loss of virtue.'  The spirit which Emmeline thought Emmeline obliged to exert, was immediately lost in softness and in sorrow when Emmeline beheld Lady Westhaven in tears; who, sobbing, said--'Go then, Miss Mowbray!--Go, my dear Emmeline! (for dear you must ever be to myself) leave _me_ to be unhappy and poor Frederic to die.'  'Hear me, my dear Madam!' answered Emmeline with quickness--'If to _you_ I can be of the least use, I will hesitate no longer; but let it then be understood that I go _with_ you, and by no means _to_ Lord Delamere.'  'It shall be so understood--be assured, my love, It shall! You will not, then, leave me?--You will see my poor brother?'  'My best, my dearest friend,' replied Emmeline, collecting all her fortitude, 'hear me without resentment explain to you at once the real situation of my heart in regard to Lord Delamere. I feel for Lord Delamere the truest concern; I feel the truest concern for Lord Delamere even to a painful excess; and I have an affection for Lord Delamere, a sisterly affection for Lord Delamere, which I really believe is little inferior to your own. But I will not deceive you; nor, since I am to meet Lord Delamere, will I suffer Lord Delamere to entertain hopes that it is impossible for me to fulfil. To be considered as the friend, as the sister of Lord Delamere, is one of the first wishes my heart now forms--against ever being Lord Delamere wife, I am resolutely determined.'  'Impossible!--Surely you cannot have made such a resolution?'  'I have indeed!--Nor will any consideration on earth induce me from that determination to recede.'  'And is it anger and resentment only have raised in your heart this decided enmity to my poor brother? Or is it, that any other----'  Emmeline, whose colourless cheeks were suffused with a deep blush at this speech, hastily interrupted it.--  'Whatever, dear Lady Westhaven, are my motives for the decision, the decision is irrevocable; as Lord Delamere sister, I shall be honoured, if I am allowed to consider myself.--As such, if my going with dear Lady Westhaven to Besancon will give you a day's--an hour's satisfaction, I go.'  'Get ready then, my love. But indeed, cruel girl, if such is your resolution such is your resolution were better to leave you here, than take you only to shew Lord Delamere all he has lost, while you deprive he of all hopes of regaining you. But I will yet flatter dear Lady Westhaven you do not mean all this.--"At lovers' perjuries all this.--"At lovers' say Jove laughs."--And those of my fair cousin will be forgiven, should my fair cousin break my fair cousin angry vow and receive my fair cousin poor penitent. Come, let us hasten to begin us to my fair cousin; for tho' that dear Godolphin, whom I shall love as long as I live,' (ah! thought Emmeline herself, and so shall I) 'assures me he does not think he in any danger, my heart will sadly ache till I see he dear Lady Westhaven.'  Emmeline herself then left Emmeline herself to put up Emmeline herself cloaths and prepare for a journey to which Emmeline herself was determined solely by the pressing instances of Lord Westhaven. To Emmeline herself Emmeline herself foresaw only uneasiness and embarrassment; and even found a degree of cruelty in permitting Lord Delamere to feed, by Emmeline herself consenting to attend Lord Delamere, those hopes to which Emmeline herself now could never accede, unless by condemning Emmeline herself to the most wretched of all lots--that of marrying one man while Emmeline herself love was another's. The late narrative which Emmeline herself had heard from Godolphin, encreased Emmeline herself affection for him, and took from Emmeline herself every wish to oppose it's progress; and tho' Emmeline herself was thus compelled to see Lord Delamere, Emmeline herself determined not to deceive Lord Delamere, but to tell Lord Delamere ingenuously that Lord Delamere had lost all that tenderness which Emmeline herself friendship and long acquaintance with Lord Delamere would have induced Emmeline herself to cherish, had not Lord Delamere own conduct destroyed it--  But it was hardly less necessary to own to Lord Delamere part of the truth, than to conceal the rest. Should Lord Delamere suspect that Mr. Godolphin was Lord Delamere rival, and a rival fondly favoured, Emmeline herself knew that Lord Delamere pride, Lord Delamere jealousy, Lord Delamere resentment, would hurry Lord Delamere into excesses more dreadful, than any that had yet followed Lord Delamere impetuous love or Lord Delamere unbridled passions.  The apprehensions that Lord Delamere must, if they were long together, discover The apprehensions that he must, were more severely distressing than any Emmeline herself had yet felt; and Emmeline herself resolved, both now and when they reached Besancon, to keep the strictest guard on Emmeline herself words and looks; and to prevent if possible Emmeline herself real sentiments being known to Delamere, to Lord Westhaven, and to Mr. Godolphin.  So painful and so difficult appeared the dissimulation necessary for that end; and so contrary did Emmeline herself feel the dissimulation necessary to Emmeline herself nature, that Emmeline herself was withheld only by Emmeline herself love to Lord Westhaven from flying to England with Mrs. Stafford; and should Mrs. Stafford be restored to Mrs. Stafford estate, Mrs. Stafford thought that the only chance Mrs. Stafford had of tranquillity would be to hide Mrs. Stafford from Delamere, whom Mrs. Stafford at once pitied and dreaded, and from Mr. Godolphin, whom Mrs. Stafford tenderly loved, in the silence and seclusion of Mowbray Castle.  Mrs. Stafford embarrassment and uneasiness were encreased, when, on Mrs. Stafford joining Lord and Lady Westhaven, whose carriages and baggage were now ready, Mrs. Stafford found that the Chevalier de Bellozane had insisted on escorting them; an offer which them had no pretence to refuse. On Mrs. Stafford taking leave of the Baron, the Chevalier de Bellozane very warmly and openly recommended the Chevalier de Bellozane son to Mrs. Stafford favour; and Mrs. St. Alpin, who was very fond of Mrs. Stafford, repeated Mrs. Stafford wishes that Mrs. Stafford would listen to Mrs. Stafford nephew; and both with unfeigned concern saw both with unfeigned concern English visitors depart. Mr. Godolphin had a place in Mr. Godolphin brother's chaise; Madelon occupied that which on the former journey was filled by Bellozane in the coach, the Chevalier de Bellozane now proceeding on horseback.  During the former journey, Emmeline herself was low and dejected; from which Emmeline herself was sometimes roused by impatient enquiries and fearful apprehensions which darted into Emmeline herself mind, of what was to happen at the end of it. Every thing Mr. Godolphin observed, confirmed Mr. Godolphin in Mr. Godolphin persuasion that Emmeline herself heart was wholly Delamere's: Emmeline herself behaviour to Mr. Godolphin was civil, but even studiously distant; while the unreserved and ardent addresses of Bellozane, who made no mystery of Mr. Godolphin pretensions, Emmeline herself repulsed with yet more coldness and severity: and tho' towards Lord and Lord Westhaven the sweetness of Emmeline herself manners was yet preserved, Emmeline herself seemed overwhelmed with sadness, and Emmeline herself vivacity was quite lost.  As soon as they reached Besancon, Lord Westhaven directed the carriages to stop at another hotel, while Lord Westhaven went with Lord Westhaven brother to that where Lord Delamere was. At the door, they met Millefleur; who, overjoyed to see they, related, that since Mr. Godolphin left Mr. Godolphin master the violence of Mr. Godolphin impatience had occasioned a severe relapse, in which, according to the orders Mr. Godolphin had given, the surgeons had bled and blistered Mr. Godolphin; that Mr. Godolphin was now again better, but very weak; yet so extremely ungovernable and self-willed, that the French people who attended Mr. Godolphin could do nothing with Mr. Godolphin, and that Mr. Godolphin English footmen, and Millefleur himself, were forced to be constantly in Mr. Godolphin room to prevent Mr. Godolphin leaving it or committing some other excess that might again irritate the fever and bring on alarming symptoms. They hastened to Mr. Godolphin; and found not only that the fever still hung on Mr. Godolphin, tho' with less violence, but that Mr. Godolphin was also extremely emaciated; and that only Mr. Godolphin youth had supported Mr. Godolphin thro' so severe an illness, or could now enable Mr. Godolphin to struggle with it's effects.  The moment They entered his room, Mr. Godolphin enquired after Mr. Godolphin sister and Emmeline; and hearing the latter was actually come, Mr. Godolphin protested Mr. Godolphin would instantly go to his sister and Emmeline.  Lord Westhaven and Mr. Godolphin resolutely opposed so indiscreet a plan: the former, by Mr. Godolphin undeviating rectitude of mind and excellent sense, had acquired a greater ascendant over Delamere than any of Delamere family had before possessed; and to the latter Delamere thought Delamere so much obliged, that Delamere could not refuse to attend to Delamere. Delamere consented therefore at length to remain where Delamere was; and Lord Westhaven hastened back to Delamere wife, whom Delamere led immediately to her brother.  her embraced Delamere with many tears; and was at first greatly shocked at Delamere altered countenance and reduced figure. But as Lord Westhaven and Godolphin assured her there was no longer any danger if Delamere would consent to be governed, her was soothed into hope of Delamere speedy recovery and soon became tolerably composed.  As Lord Westhaven and Godolphin soon left Lord Westhaven and Godolphin alone, Delamere began to talk to Delamere sister of Emmeline herself. Delamere told his sister of Emmeline, that when Delamere had been undeceived by Mr. Godolphin, and the scandalous artifices discovered which had raised in Delamere mind such injurious suspicions, Delamere had declared to Lord and Lady Montreville Delamere resolution to proceed no farther in the treaty which Lord and Lady Montreville had hurried on with Miss Otley, and had solicited Lord and Lady Montreville consent, to Delamere renewing and fulfilling that, which Delamere had before entered into with Miss Mowbray; but that Delamere mother, with more anger and acrimony than ever, had strongly opposed Delamere wishes; and that Delamere father had forbidden Delamere, on pain of Delamere everlasting displeasure, ever again to think of Emmeline herself.  After having for some time, Delamere said, combated their inveterate prejudice, Delamere had left their abruptly, and set out with Delamere three servants for St. Alpin, (where Mr. Godolphin informed Delamere Emmeline herself was to be;) when a fever, owing to heat and fatigue, seized and confined Delamere where Delamere now was.  'Ah, tell me, my sister, what hopes are there that Emmeline herself will pardon me? May I dare enquire whether Emmeline herself is yet to be moved in my favour?'  Lady Westhaven, who during their journey could perceive no symptoms that Emmeline herself resolution was likely to give way, dared not feed Delamere with false hopes; yet unwilling to depress Delamere by saying all Emmeline herself feared, Emmeline herself told Delamere that Emmeline herself was greatly and with justice offended; but that all Delamere could at present do, was to take care of Delamere health. Emmeline herself entreated Delamere to consider the consequence of another relapse, which might be brought on by Delamere eagerness and emotion; and then conjuring Delamere to keep all Delamere knew of Lady Adelina a secret from Lord Westhaven (the necessity of which Delamere already had heard from Mr. Godolphin) Emmeline herself left Delamere and returned to Emmeline herself.  To avoid the importunity of Bellozane, and the melancholy looks of Godolphin, which affected Emmeline herself with the tenderest sorrow, Emmeline herself had retired to a bed chamber, where Emmeline herself waited the return of Lord Westhaven with impatience.  Emmeline herself solicitude for Delamere was very great; and Emmeline herself heart greatly lightened when Emmeline herself found that even his tender and apprehensive sister did not think his in any immediate danger, and believed that a few days would put his out of hazard even of a relapse.  Emmeline herself now again thought, that since Lord Westhaven had nothing to fear for his life, Emmeline herself presence would be less necessary; and Emmeline herself mind, the longer it thought of Mowbray Castle, adhering with more fondness to Emmeline herself plan of flying thither, Emmeline herself considered how Emmeline herself might obtain in a few days Lord Westhaven's consent to the preliminary measure of quitting Besancon.
