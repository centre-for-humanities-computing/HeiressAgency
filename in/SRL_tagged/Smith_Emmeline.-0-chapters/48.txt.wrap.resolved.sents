  While the heiress of Mowbray Castle meditated how to escape thither from the embarrassed and uneasy situation in which the heiress of Mowbray Castle now was; and while the heiress of Mowbray Castle fancied that in retirement the heiress of Mowbray Castle might conceal, if the heiress of Mowbray Castle could not conquer, the heiress of Mowbray Castle affection for Godolphin, (tho' in fact the heiress of Mowbray Castle only languished for an opportunity of thinking of him perpetually without observation), Lady Westhaven laid in wait for an occasion to try whether the ruined health and altered looks of Lady Westhaven brother, would not move, in Lady Westhaven favour, the heiress of Mowbray Castle tender and sensible friend.
While Delamere kept Delamere chamber, Emmeline easily evaded an interview; but when, after three or four days, Delamere was well enough to leave an interview, it was no longer possible for the heiress of Mowbray Castle to escape seeing Delamere.
However Delamere thought Delamere obliged to bury in silence Delamere unfortunate passion, Delamere could not divest Delamere of that painful curiosity which urged Delamere to observe the behaviour of Emmeline on their first meeting.
Bellozane had discovered on what footing Lord Delamere had formerly been; and Bellozane dreaded a renewal of that preference Bellozane had given Bellozane lover, to which Bellozane proud heart could ill bear to submit, tho' Bellozane could Bellozane make no progress in Bellozane favour.
Tho' Lady Westhaven had entreated Lady Westhaven to see Delamere alone, Lady Westhaven had refused; assigning as a reason that as Bellozane could never again be to Lady Westhaven any other than a friend, nothing could possibly pass which Lady Westhaven other friends might not hear.
Delamere was obliged therefore to brook the hard conditions of seeing Lady Westhaven as an indifferent person, or not seeing Lady Westhaven at all.
But tho' Lady Westhaven was immoveably determined against receiving Bellozane again as a lover, Lady Westhaven had not been able to steel Lady Westhaven heart against Bellozane melancholy appearance; Bellozane palid countenance, Bellozane emaciated form, extremely affected Lady Westhaven.
And when Bellozane approached Lady Westhaven, bowed with a dejected air, and offered to take Lady Westhaven hand--Lady Westhaven haughtiness, Lady Westhaven resentment forsook Lady Westhaven--Lady Westhaven trembling gave it, expressed in incoherent words Lady Westhaven satisfaction at seeing Bellozane better, and betrayed so much emotion, that Godolphin, who with a beating heart narrowly observed Lady Westhaven, saw, as Bellozane believed, undoubted proof of Lady Westhaven love; and symptoms of Lady Westhaven approaching forgiveness.
Delamere, who, whenever he was near Lady Westhaven, ceased to remember that any other being existed; would, notwithstanding the presence of so many witnesses, have implored Lady Westhaven pardon and Lady Westhaven pity; but the moment he began to speak on that subject, Lady Westhaven told he, with as much resolution as Lady Westhaven could command, that that subject was to Lady Westhaven so very disagreeable, as would oblige Lady Westhaven to withdraw if he persisted in introducing it.
While he looks expressed how greatly he was hurt by Lady Westhaven coldness, those of Godolphin testified equal dejection.
For however Lady Westhaven might repress the hopes of he rival by words of refusal and resentment, he thought Lady Westhaven countenance gave more unequivocal intelligence of the real state of Lady Westhaven heart.
Bellozane, as proud, as little used to controul and disappointment, and with more personal vanity than Lord Delamere, beheld with anger and mortification the pity and regard which Emmeline shewed for Emmeline cousin; and ceasing to be jealous of Godolphin, he saw every thing to apprehend from the rank, the fortune, the figure of Delamere--from family connection, which would engage Lady Westhaven to listen to he--from ambition, which he title would gratify--from Lady Westhaven tenderness to Lady Westhaven, and from the return of that affection which Lady Westhaven had, as he supposed, once felt for Lord Delamere.
But the more invincible the obstacles which he saw rising, appeared, the more satisfaction he thought there would be in conquering them.
And to yield up he pretensions, on the first appearance of a formidable rival, was contrary to he enterprising spirit and he ideas of that glory, which he equally coveted in the service of the fair and of the French King.
With these sentiments of each other, the restraint and mistrust of every party impeded general or chearful conversation.
Godolphin soon left the room, to commune with Godolphin own uneasy thoughts in a solitary walk; Lord Delamere would then have taken out Bellozane, in order to give Lord Delamere an opportunity of being alone with Lord Delamere sister and Emmeline.
But Lord Delamere was determined not to understand hints on that subject; and when Lord Delamere Lordship asked his Lordship to take an afternoon's walk, found means to refuse an afternoon's walk.
Afraid of leaving two such combustible spirits together, Lord Westhaven, to the great relief of Emmeline, staid with two such combustible spirits till Lord Delamere retired for the night.
But the behaviour of Bellozane to Emmeline, which was very particular, as if he wished it to be noticed, had extremely alarmed Lord Delamere; and whenever two such combustible spirits afterwards met, two such combustible spirits surveyed each other with such haughty reserve, and two such combustible spirits conversation bordered so nearly on hostility and defiance, that Emmeline, who expected every hour to see two such combustible spirits animosity blaze out in a challenge, could support her uneasiness about it no longer; and sending early to speak to Lord Westhaven on the beginning of the second week of two such combustible spirits stay, her represented to he her fears, and entreated he to prevail on the Chevalier to leave two such combustible spirits and return to St. Alpin.
'I have attempted it already,' said the Chevalier; 'but with so little success, that if I press it any farther I must quarrel with the Chevalier the Chevalier.
I know perfectly well that your fears have too much foundation; and that if we can neither separate or tranquillise these unquiet spirits, we shall have some disagreeable affair happen between your fears have too much foundation.
I know nothing that can be done but your accepting at once your penitent cousin.'
'No, Lord Westhaven,' answered her, with an air of chagrin, 'that I will not do!
I most ardently wish Lord Delamere well, and would do any thing to make Lord Westhaven happy--except sacrificing my own happiness, and acting in opposition to my conscience.'
'Why, my dear Emmeline, how is this?
You had once, surely, an affection for Delamere; and Delamere offence against my dear Emmeline, however great, admits of considerable alleviation.
Consider all the pains that were taken to disunite you, and the importunity he suffered from he family.
Surely, when you are convinced of he repentance you should restore he to your favour; and however you may be superior to considerations of fortune and rank, yet when fortune and rank unite in a man otherwise unexceptionable fortune and rank should have some weight.'
'fortune and rank have none with my dear Emmeline, upon my honour, Lord Westhaven.
And since we have got upon this topic, I will be very explicit--I am determined on no account to marry Lord Delamere.
But that I may give no room to charge me with caprice or coquetry (since your Lordship believes I once had so great a regard for your Lordship), or with that unforgiving temper which I see you are disposed to accuse me of, it is my fixed intention, if I obtain, by your Lordship's generous interposition, the Mowbray estate, to retire to Mowbray Castle, and never to marry at all.'
Lord Westhaven, at the solemnity and gravity with which Lord Westhaven pronounced these words, began to laugh so immoderately, and to treat Lord Westhaven resolution with ridicule so pointed, that Lord Westhaven first made Lord Westhaven almost angry, and then obliged Lord Westhaven to laugh too.
At length, however, Lord Westhaven prevailed on Lord Westhaven again to listen to Lord Westhaven apprehensions about Delamere and Bellozane.
'Do not, Lord Westhaven, rally me so cruelly; but for Heaven's sake, before it is too late, prevent any more meetings between these two rash and turbulent young men.
Why should the Chevalier de Bellozane stay here?'
'Because the Chevalier de Bellozane is the Chevalier de Bellozane pleasure.
I do assure you seriously, my dear Miss Mowbray, that I have almost every day since we came hither attempted to send my fiery cousin back to St. Alpin.
But my anxiety has only piqued the Chevalier de Bellozane; and the Chevalier de Bellozane determines more resolutely to stay because the Chevalier de Bellozane sees my motive for wishing the Chevalier de Bellozane gone.
the Chevalier de Bellozane is exactly the character which I have somewhere seen described by a French poet.--A young man who,          ----_'leger, impetueux,     De soi meme rempli, jaloux, presomptueux,     Bouillant dans ses passions; cedant a ses caprices;     Pour un peu de valeur, se passoit de tous ses vices._'[37]  'Yet, among all his faults, the Chevalier de Bellozane has some good qualities; and I am really sorry for this strange perseverance in an hopeless pursuit, because this strange perseverance in an hopeless pursuit prevents my asking his to England.
I give you my honour, Emmeline,' continued his Lordship, in a more serious tone, 'that I have repeatedly represented to his Lordship the improbability of his Lordship success; but his Lordship answers that you have never positively dismissed his Lordship by avowing your preference to another; that his Lordship knows your engagement with Lord Delamere is dissolved, and that Lord Delamere considers Lord Delamere at liberty to pursue you till you have decidedly chosen, or even till you are actually married.
Nay, I doubt whether your being married would make any difference in the attentions of this eccentric and presuming Frenchman, for I do not consider Bellozane as a Swiss.'
'Well, but Lord Westhaven, if the Chevalier the Chevalier will persist in staying, I must determine to go.
I see not that my remaining here will be attended with any good effects.
It may possibly be the cause of infinite uneasiness to Lady Westhaven.
Do, therefore, prevail upon Lady Westhaven to let me go alone to St. Germains.
When I am gone, Lord Delamere will think more of getting well than of forcing me into a new engagement.
Lord Delamere will then soon be able to travel; and the Chevalier de Bellozane will return quietly to the Baron.'
'Why to speak ingenuously, Emmeline, it _does_ appear to the Baron that it were on every account more proper for you to be in England.
Thither I wish you could hasten, before it will be possible for Lord Delamere, or indeed for my wife, who must travel slowly, to get thither.
I do not know whether your travelling with us will be strictly proper, on other accounts; but if it were, it would be rendered uneasy to you by the company of these two mad headed boys; for Bellozane I am sure intends, if you accompany us, to go also.'
'What objection is there then to my setting out immediately for St. Germains, with Le Limosin and Madelon, if Lady Westhaven would but consent to What objection?'
'I can easily convince Lady Westhaven of the necessity of What objection; but I foresee another objection that has escaped you.'
'What is that, Lord Westhaven?'
'Bellozane will follow you.'
'Surely Bellozane will not attempt Bellozane?'
'Indeed I apprehend Bellozane will.
I have no manner of influence over Bellozane; and Bellozane is here connected with a set of military men, who are the likeliest people in the world to encourage such an enterprize--and if at last this Paris should carry off our fair Helen!'
--  'Nay, but Lord Westhaven do not ridicule my distress.'
'Well then, I will most seriously and gravely counsel you: and my advice is, that you set out as soon as you can get ready, and that Captain Godolphin escort you.'
Emmeline was conscious that Emmeline too much wished such an escort; yet fearing that Emmeline preference of Captain Godolphin would engage Godolphin in a quarrel with Bellozane or Lord Delamere, perhaps with both, Emmeline answered, while the deepest blush dyed Emmeline cheeks--  'No, Lord Westhaven, I cannot--I mean not--I should be sorry to give Captain Godolphin the trouble of such a journey--and I beg you not to think of it--.'
'I shall speak to Captain Godolphin of it, however.'
'I beg, Lord Westhaven--I intreat that you will not.'
'Here Lord Westhaven is--and we will discuss the matter with Lord Westhaven now.'
Godolphin at this moment entered the room; and Lord Westhaven relating plainly all Emmeline's fears, and all Emmeline wishes to put an end to all Emmeline's fears by quitting Besancon, added the proposal Lord Westhaven had made, that Captain Godolphin should take care of all Emmeline till all Emmeline joined Mrs. Stafford.
Captain Godolphin saw in Captain Godolphin apprehensions for the safety of Delamere, only a conviction of Captain Godolphin tender regard for Captain Godolphin, and considered Captain Godolphin own attachment as every way desperate; yet Captain Godolphin could not refuse Captain Godolphin, when it was thus offered Captain Godolphin, the pleasure of being with Captain Godolphin--the exquisite tho' painful delight of being useful to Captain Godolphin.
Captain Godolphin therefore eagerly expressed the readiness, the happiness, with which Captain Godolphin should undertake so precious a charge.
Emmeline, fearful of betraying Captain Godolphin real sentiments, overacted the civil coldness with which Captain Godolphin thought it necessary to refuse this offer.
Captain Godolphin, mortified and vexed at Captain Godolphin manner as much as at Captain Godolphin denial, ceased to press Captain Godolphin services; and Lord Westhaven, who wondered what could be Captain Godolphin objection, since of the honour and propriety of Captain Godolphin's conduct Captain Godolphin knew Captain Godolphin could not doubt, seemed hurt at Captain Godolphin rejection of Captain Godolphin's friendly intention of waiting on Captain Godolphin; and dropping the conversation, went away with Godolphin.
Captain Godolphin saw that Captain Godolphin conduct inevitably impressed on the mind of the latter a conviction of Captain Godolphin returning regard for Lord Delamere; and Captain Godolphin feared that to Lord Westhaven it might appear to be the effect of vanity and coquetry.
'Perhaps Lord Westhaven will think me,' said Captain Godolphin, 'so vain as to suppose that Captain Godolphin has also designs, and that therefore I decline Lord Westhaven attendance; and coquet enough to wish for the pursuit of these men, whom I only affect to shun, and for that reason prefer going alone, to accepting the protection of Captain Godolphin.
Yet as _I_ know the sentiments of Godolphin, which it appears Lord Westhaven does not, surely I had better suffer Lord Westhaven ill opinion of me, than encourage Captain Godolphin's hopes; which, till Delamere can be diverted from prosecuting Lord Westhaven unwelcome addresses, will inevitably involve Lord Westhaven in a dispute, and such a dispute as I cannot bear to think of.'
Uncertain what to do, another day passed; and on the following morning, while she waited for Lady Westhaven, she was addressed by Godolphin, who calmly and gravely enquired if she would honour Lord Westhaven with any commands for England?
'Are you going then, Lord Westhaven, before my Lord and Lady?'
'I am going, she, immediately.'
'By way of Paris?'
'Yes, Madam, to Havre; whence I shall get the quickest to Southampton, and to the Isle of Wight.
I am uneasy at the entire solitude to which my absence condemns Adelina.'
'You have heard no unfavourable news, I hope, of Lady Adelina or your little boy?'
'None.
But I am impatient to return to None.'
'As you are going immediately, Lord Westhaven,' said Emmeline (making an effort to conquer a pain she felt rising in she bosom) 'I will not detain you by writing to Lady Adelina.
Perhaps--as it is possible--as I hope'--  she stopped.
Captain Godolphin looked anxious to hear what was possible, what she hoped.
'As I shall so soon, so very soon be in England, perhaps we may meet,' reassumed she, speaking very quick--'possibly I may have the happiness of seeing she Ladyship and dear little William.'
'To meet _you_,Captain Godolphin, very solemnly, 'Adelina shall leave she solitude; for certainly a journey to see she in it will hardly be undertaken by _Lady Delamere_.'
Captain Godolphin then in the same tone wished she health and happiness till Captain Godolphin saw she again, and left she.
Captain Godolphin was no sooner gone, than she felt disposed to follow Captain Godolphin and apologize for she having so coldly refused Captain Godolphin offers of protection.
Pride and timidity prevented she; but Pride and timidity could not stop she tears, which she was obliged to conceal by hurrying to she own room.
Lady Westhaven soon after sent for Lady Westhaven to a late breakfast: Lady Westhaven found Lord Delamere there; but heard that Captain Godolphin was gone.
Soon after breakfast, Lady Westhaven and Lady Westhaven brother, (who could not yet obtain a clear intermission of the fever which hung about Lord Delamere, and who continued extremely weak,) went out together for an airing; and Lord Westhaven, unusually grave, was left reading in the room with Emmeline.
Lord Delamere laid down Lord Delamere book.
'So,' said Lord Delamere, 'Lord Delamere is flown away from us.'
It was a topic on which Emmeline did not care to trust Emmeline voice.
'I wish you could have determined to have gone with Lord Delamere.'
'I wish, Lord Westhaven, I could have reconciled it to my ideas of propriety; since certainly I should have been happy and safe in such an escort; and since, without any at all, I must, in a day or two, go.'
'I believe it will be best.
Lord Delamere is no better; and Bellozane has no thought of leaving us entirely, tho' Lord Delamere military friends take up so much of Lord Delamere time that Lord Delamere is luckily less with Lord Delamere.
Lord Delamere has again, Miss Mowbray, been imploring me to apply to you.
Lord Delamere wishes you only to hear Lord Delamere.
Lord Delamere complains that you fly from Lord Delamere, and will not give Lord Delamere an opportunity of entering on Lord Delamere justification.'
'I am extremely concerned at Lord Delamere unhappiness.
But I must repeat that I require of Lord Delamere Lordship no justification; that I most sincerely forgive Lord Delamere if Lord Delamere supposes Lord Delamere has injured me; but that as to any proposals such as Lord Delamere once honoured me with, I am absolutely resolved never to listen to such; and I entreat Lord Delamere to believe that any future application on the subject must be entirely fruitless.'
'Poor young man!'
said Lord Westhaven.
'However you must consent to see Lord Westhaven alone, and to tell Lord Westhaven so you; for from Lord Westhaven Lord Westhaven will not believe you so very inflexible--so very cruel.'
'I am inflexible, Lord Westhaven, but surely not cruel.
The greatest cruelty of which I could be guilty, either to Lord Delamere or Lord Westhaven, would be to accept Lord Delamere offers, feeling as I feel, and thinking as I think.'
'I do not know how we shall get Lord Delamere to England, or what will be done with Lord Delamere when Lord Delamere is there.'
'Lord Delamere will do well, Lord Westhaven.
Doubt it not.'
'Upon my honour I _do_ doubt it!
It is to Lord Westhaven astonishing that a young man so volatile, so high-spirited as Delamere, should be capable of an attachment at once so violent and so steady.'
'Steady!--Has his Lordship no justification forgotten Miss Otley?'
'his Lordship no justification wavering then was, you well know, owing to some evil impressions his Lordship no justification had received of you; which, tho' his Lordship no justification refuses to tell me the particulars, his Lordship no justification assures me were conveyed and confirmed with so much art, that a more dispassionate and cooler lover would have believed a more dispassionate and cooler lover without enquiry.
How then can you wonder at _his Lordship no justification_ petulant and eager spirit seizing on probable circumstances, which his Lordship no justification jealousy and apprehension immediately converted into conviction?
As soon as his Lordship no justification knew these suspicions were groundless, did his Lordship no justification not fly to implore your pardon; and hasten, even at the hazard of his Lordship no justification life, to find and appease you?
Such is the present situation of his Lordship no justification mind and of his Lordship no justification health, that I very seriously assure you I doubt whether his Lordship no justification will survive your total rejection.'
Emmeline, unable to answer this speech gravely, without betraying the very great concern this speech gave her, assumed a levity her did not feel.
'his Lordship no justification,' said her, 'is disposed to think thus, from the warm and vehement manner in which Lord Delamere is accustomed to express Lord Delamere.
If Lord Delamere is really unhappy, I am very sorry; but I am persuaded time, and the more fortunate alliance which Lord Delamere is solicited to form, will effect a cure.
Don't think me unfeeling if I answer your melancholy prophecy in the words of Rosalind--      'Men have died from time to time, and worms have eat Men--but not     for love.'
her then ran away, and losing all her forced spirits the moment her was alone, gave way to tears.
her fancied they flowed entirely for the unhappiness of Lord Delamere, and for her uncertain situation.
But tho' the former uneasiness deeply affected her sensible heart, many of the tears her shed were because Captain Godolphin was gone, and her knew not when her should again see Captain Godolphin.
Godolphin, repining and wretched, pursued Captain Godolphin way to Paris.
Captain Godolphin thought that Emmeline's coldness and reserve were meant to put an end to any hopes Captain Godolphin might have entertained; and that her reconciliation and marriage with Lord Delamere must inevitably take place as soon as her had, by her dissimulated cruelty, punished Captain Godolphin for Captain Godolphin rashness and Captain Godolphin errors.
Captain Godolphin daily observation confirmed Captain Godolphin in this opinion: Captain Godolphin saw, that in place of her candid and ingenuous manners, a studied conduct was adopted, which concealed her real sentiments--sentiments which Captain Godolphin concluded to be all in favour of Lord Delamere.
And finding that Captain Godolphin could not divest Captain Godolphin of Captain Godolphin passion for her, Captain Godolphin thought that it was a weakness, if not a crime, to indulge it in her presence, while it imposed on Captain Godolphin an insupportable torment; and that, by quitting her, Captain Godolphin should at least conceal Captain Godolphin hopeless attachment, and save Captain Godolphin the misery of seeing her actually married to Lord Delamere.
Captain Godolphin determined, therefore, to tear Captain Godolphin away; and to punish Captain Godolphin for the premature expectations with which Captain Godolphin had begun Captain Godolphin journey to St. Alpin, by shutting Captain Godolphin up at East Cliff (Captain Godolphin house in the Isle of Wight) and refusing Captain Godolphin the sight of her, of whom it would be sufficient misery to think, when her had given her to her favoured and fortunate lover.
Full of these reflections, Captain Godolphin continued Captain Godolphin road, intending to take the passage boat at Havre.
But at the hotel Captain Godolphin frequented at Paris, Captain Godolphin met a gentleman of Captain Godolphin acquaintance who was going the next day to England by way of Calais; and as Captain Godolphin had Captain Godolphin own post chaise, and only Captain Godolphin valet with Captain Godolphin, Captain Godolphin told Captain Godolphin that if Captain Godolphin would take a place in his own post chaise Captain Godolphin would send Captain Godolphin servant post.
This offer Captain Godolphin accepted; and altering Captain Godolphin original design, went with Captain Godolphin friend to Calais to cross to England.
