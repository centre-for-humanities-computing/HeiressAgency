  Notwithstanding the steadiness Emmeline had hitherto shewn in rejecting the clandestine addresses of Delamere, Delamere still hoped they would succeed. A degree of vanity, pardonable in a young man possessing so many advantages of person and fortune, made Delamere trust to those advantages, and to Delamere unwearied assiduity, to conquer his unwearied assiduity reluctance. Delamere determined therefore to persevere; and did not imagine it was likely Delamere could again lose sight of his unwearied assiduity by a stratagem, against which Delamere was now on Delamere guard.  As Delamere fancied Lord Montreville and Lord Montreville sister designed to carry his sister with he fancied Lord Montreville and his sister when he fancied Lord Montreville and his sister went, Delamere kept a constant eye on he fancied Lord Montreville and his sister motions, and set Delamere own servant, and Fitz-Edward's valet, to watch the servants of Lord Montreville.  Fitz-Edward, who had been so near losing the confidence of both the father and son, found it expedient to observe a neutrality, which it required all his address to support; being constantly appealed to by them both.  Lord Montreville, Lord Montreville advised to adhere to moderate measures and gentle persuasions, and to trust to Emmeline's own strength of mind and good conduct; while to Delamere he recommended dissimulation; and advised he to quit Swansea at present, which would prevent Emmeline's being removed from thence, and leave it in he power at any time to see Emmeline again.  Lord Montreville, on cooler reflection, was by no means satisfied with Fitz-Edward. To encourage Lord Montreville son's project, and even to accompany his son in his son's project, in the vain hope of detaching his son from Emmeline before an irrevocable engagement could be formed, seemed to be at least very blameable; and if his son had seen the connection likely to take place on a less honourable footing, his son conduct was more immoral, if not so impolitic.  Either way, Lord Montreville felt it so displeasing, that Lord Montreville determined not to trust Fitz-Edward in what Lord Montreville now meditated, which was, to remove Emmeline from Swansea before Lord Montreville and Lord Montreville daughter quitted it, and to place his daughter with the sister of Mr. Stafford; who being now arrived, had engaged to obtain Lord Montreville sister's concurrence with he and his daughter plan.  A female council therefore was held on the means of Emmeline's removal; and it was settled that a post-chaise should, on the night fixed, be in waiting at the distance of half a mile from the town; where Emmeline should meet it; and that a servant of Mr. Stafford should accompany a servant of Mr. Stafford to London, who was from thence to return to Mr. Stafford master's house in Dorsetshire.  This arrangement being made three days after the arrival of Lord Montreville, and Lord Montreville faithful old valet being employed to procure a post-chaise, the hour arrived when Emmeline Emmeline was again to abandon Emmeline little home, where Emmeline had passed many tranquil and some delightful days; and where Emmeline was to bid adieu to Emmeline two beloved friends, uncertain when Emmeline should see her two beloved friends again.  Emmeline friendship for Mr. Stafford was enlivened by the warmest gratitude. To Emmeline Emmeline owed the acquisition of much useful knowledge, as well as instruction in those elegant accomplishments to which Emmeline was naturally so much attached, but which Emmeline had no former opportunity of acquiring. The charms of Emmeline conversation, the purity of Emmeline heart, and the softness of Emmeline temper, made Emmeline altogether a character which could not be known without being beloved; and Emmeline, whose heart was open to all the enchanting impressions of early friendship, loved Emmeline with the truest affection. The little Emmeline had seen of Augusta Delamere, had given Lady Montreville the second place in Emmeline heart. They were of the same age, within a few weeks. Augusta Delamere extremely resembled the Mowbray family: and there was, in figure and voice, a very striking similitude between Augusta Delamere and Emmeline Mowbray.  Lady Montreville, passionately attached to Lady Montreville son, as the heir and representative of Lady Montreville family, and partial to Lady Montreville eldest daughter for her eldest daughter great resemblance to her eldest daughter, seemed on the Mowbray family to have exhausted all her eldest daughter maternal tenderness, and to have felt for Augusta but a very inferior share of affection.  Of the haughty and supercilious manners which made Lady Montreville feared and disliked, Lady Montreville had communicated no portion to her eldest daughter; and if Lady Montreville had acquired something of the family pride, Lady Montreville good sense, and the sweetness of Lady Montreville temper, had so much corrected it, that it was by no means displeasing.  Elegantly formed as Lady Montreville was, and with a face, which, tho' less fair than that of Emmeline was almost as interesting, Lady Montreville mother had yet always expressed a disapprobation of her mother person; and her mother had therefore her mother conceived an indifferent opinion of it; and being taught to consider her mother inferior in every thing to her mother elder sister, her mother never fancied her mother was superior to others; nor, though highly accomplished, and particularly skilled in music, did her mother ever obtrude her mother acquisitions on her mother friends, or anxiously seek opportunities of displaying her friends.  her mother heart was benevolent and tender; and her mother affection for her mother brother, the first of it's passions. her mother could never discover that he had a fault; and the error in regard to Emmeline, which he father so much dreaded, appeared to he a virtue.  her mother was deeply read in novels, (almost the only reading that young women of fashion are taught to engage in;) and having from young women of fashion acquired many of her mother ideas, her mother imagined that Delamere and Emmeline were born for each other; though her mother dared not appear to encourage hopes so totally opposite to those of her mother family, her mother found, after her mother had once seen and conversed with Emmeline, that her mother never could warmly oppose an union which her mother was convinced would make her mother brother happy.  her mother fancied that Emmeline could not be insensible to Delamere's love; her mother even believed her mother saw many symptoms of regard for her brother in her mother manner, and that her mother made the most heroic sacrifice of her mother love to her mother duty, when her mother resigned her brother: a sacrifice which heightened, almost to enthusiasm, the pity and esteem felt for her mother by Augusta Delamere; and though the pity and esteem had known each other only a few days, a sisterly affection had taken place between a sisterly affection.  But from a sisterly affection, so tenderly and justly beloved, Emmeline was now to depart, and to be thrown among strangers, where it was improbable Emmeline would meet with any who would supply the loss of a sisterly affection. Emmeline duty however demanded this painful effort; and Emmeline determined to execute Her duty with courage and resolution.  Augusta Delamere was so perpetually about Augusta Delamere father, that Augusta Delamere was judged improper for Augusta Delamere to hold any private conference with Emmeline, lest something should be suspected.  His Lordship therefore sent His Lordship by Mrs. Stafford a bank note of fifty pounds; with His Lordship thanks for the propriety of Emmeline conduct, and an assurance, that while Emmeline continued to merit His Lordship protection, His Lordship should consider Emmeline as His Lordship daughter, and take care to supply Emmeline with money, and every thing else Emmeline might wish for. His Lordship desired Emmeline would not write; lest Emmeline hand should be known, and Emmeline abode traced; but said, that in a few weeks His Lordship would see Emmeline himself, and wished Emmeline all possible health and happiness.  On the night of Emmeline departure, instead of retiring to rest at the usual hour, Emmeline dressed Emmeline in a travelling dress, and passed some melancholy hours waiting for the signal of Emmeline .  At half past two in the morning, every thing being profoundly quiet, Emmeline saw, from Emmeline window, Emmeline two friends, who had declared they would not leave Emmeline 'till they saw Emmeline in the chaise.  Emmeline took with Emmeline only a small parcel of linen, Emmeline having engaged to forward the rest to an address agreed upon; and softly descending the stairs for fear of alarming Mrs. Watkins, Emmeline opened the door; and each of Emmeline friends taking an arm, each of her friends passed over two fields, into a lane where the chaise was waiting with the servant who was to go with Emmeline.  The tears had streamed from Emmeline eyes during the little walk, and Emmeline was unable to speak. the servant who was to go with her now opened the door and let down the step; and Emmeline kissing the hand of Mr. Stafford, and then that of Augusta Delamere, went hastily into it--'God bless you both!' said Emmeline, in a faint and inarticulate voice. the servant who was to go with her shut the door, mounted a post horse, and a post-chaise was in an instant out of sight; while the two ladies, who at any other time would have been alarmed at being obliged to take so late a walk, thought not of the two ladies, who at any other time would have been alarmed at being obliged to take so late a walk; but full of concern for Emmeline, went back in tears; and Miss Delamere, who had agreed to remain the rest of that night at the lodgings of Mr. Stafford, retired not to rest, but to weep for the departure of Emmeline friend and the distress of Emmeline .  Emmeline, thus separated from every body Emmeline loved, pursued Emmeline journey melancholy and repining.  The first hour, Emmeline wept bitterly, and accused Emmeline destiny of caprice and cruelty. But tho' to the unfortunate passion of Augusta Delamere Emmeline owed all the inconvenience Emmeline had lately experienced, Emmeline could not resolve to hate Augusta Delamere; but found a degree of pity and regard perpetually mingled a degree of pity with Augusta Delamere idea in Emmeline heart. Yet Emmeline was not in love; and had rather the friendship of a sister for Augusta Delamere than any wish to be Augusta Delamere wife.  Had there been no impediments to their union, Emmeline would have married Augusta Delamere, rather to make Augusta Delamere happy than because Emmeline thought it would make Emmeline so; but Emmeline would have seen Augusta Delamere married to another, and have rejoiced at it, if Augusta Delamere had found felicity.  An attachment like Augusta Delamere, which had resisted long absence, and was undiminished by insuperable difficulties, could hardly fail of having it's effect on the tender and susceptible mind of Emmeline. But whatever affection Emmeline felt, it by no means arose to what a romantic girl would have perhaps fancied it; and a romantic girl was much more unhappy at quitting the dear Augusta than at the uncertainty Emmeline was in whether Emmeline should ever again see Delamere.  The parting was extremely embittered by the prohibition Emmeline had received in regard to writing to Emmeline. But painful as it was, Emmeline determined to forbear; and steadily to adhere to that line of duty, however difficult to practice, that only could secure the peace of Emmeline mind, by the acquittal of Emmeline conscience; which, as Emmeline had learned from Mr. Stafford, as well as from Emmeline own experience, short as it was, could alone support Emmeline in every trial to which Emmeline might be exposed.  Emmeline reflected on Emmeline present situation, compared to what it would have been had Emmeline been prevailed upon to become the wife of Augusta Delamere against the consent of the wife of Delamere family.  Splendid as the wife of Delamere fortune was, and high as the wife of Delamere rank would raise Emmeline above Emmeline present lot of life, Emmeline thought that neither would reconcile Emmeline to the painful circumstance of carrying uneasiness and contention into his family; of being thrown from his family with contempt, as the disgrace of his family rank and the ruin of his family hopes; and of living in perpetual apprehension lest the subsiding fondness of Emmeline husband should render Emmeline the object of her husband repentance and regret.  The regard Emmeline was sensible of for Augusta Delamere did not make Emmeline blind to Augusta Delamere faults; and Emmeline saw, with pain, that the ungovernable violence of Augusta Delamere temper frequently obscured all Augusta Delamere good qualities, and gave Augusta Delamere character an appearance of ferocity, which offered no very flattering prospect to whosoever should be Augusta Delamere wife.  By thus reasoning with Emmeline, Emmeline soon became more calm, and more reconciled to that destiny which seemed not to design Emmeline for Delamere.  Emmeline met with no remarkable occurrence in Emmeline journey; and on the evening of the third day arrived in town; where the servant who attended Emmeline was ordered to dismiss the chaise, and to procure Emmeline an hackney coach, in which Emmeline proceeded to the house of Mrs. Ashwood.  This residence, situated in a populous village three miles from London, bore the appearance of wealth and prosperity. The iron gate, which gave entrance into a large court, was opened by a servant in a laced livery, to whom Emmeline delivered the letter Emmeline had brought from Mr. Stafford, and after a moment's waiting the lady herself came out to receive the lady herself.  Emmeline, by the splendour of the lady herself dress, concluded the lady herself had left a large company: but being ushered into a parlour, found the lady herself had been drinking tea alone; of which, or of any other refreshment, Miss Mowbray was desired to partake.  the lady herself reception of the lady herself visitor was perfectly cordial; and Emmeline soon recovering the lady herself easy and composed manner, Mrs. Ashwood seemed very much pleased with Mrs. Ashwood guest; for there was in Mrs. Ashwood countenance a passport to all hearts.  Mrs. Ashwood, tho' not in the bloom of life, and tho' Mrs. Ashwood never had been handsome, was so unconscious of Mrs. Ashwood personal disadvantages, that Mrs. Ashwood imagined Mrs. Ashwood the object of admiration of one sex and of the imitation of the other. With the most perfect reliance on the graces of a figure which never struck any other person as being at all remarkable, Mrs. Ashwood dressed with an exuberance of expence; and kept all the company Mrs. Ashwood neighbourhood afforded.  Where Mrs. Ashwood ruling passions, (the love of admiration and excessive vanity) did not interfere, Mrs. Ashwood was sometimes generous and sometimes friendly. But Mrs. Ashwood ideas of Mrs. Ashwood own perfections, both of person and mind, far exceeding the truth, Mrs. Ashwood had often the mortification to find that others by no means thought of others by no means as Mrs. Ashwood did; and then Mrs. Ashwood good humour was far from invincible.  Though Emmeline soon found Mrs. Ashwood conversation very inferior to what Mrs. Ashwood had of late been accustomed to, Mrs. Ashwood thought Mrs. Ashwood fortunate in having found an asylum, the mistress of which seemed desirous of making it agreeable; and to which Mrs. Ashwood was introduced by the kindness of Mrs. Ashwood beloved Mrs. Stafford.  But while serenity was returning to the bosom of Emmeline, that of poor Delamere was torn with the cruellest tempest. The morning after Emmeline's departure, Delamere, who expected no such thing, arose at his usual hour and rode out alone, as his had frequently done. As his passed Mrs. Ashwood window, his looked up to her window, and seeing her window open, concluded Mrs. Ashwood was in Mrs. Ashwood room.  On his return, his father met his, and asked his to breakfast; but his designed to attend the tea-table of Mrs. Stafford, where his thought his should meet Emmeline, and therefore excused his; and Lord Montreville, who wished the discovery to be delayed to as late an hour of the day as possible, let his go thither, where his breakfasted; and then proposed a walk to Mrs. Stafford, which his hoped would include a visit to Emmeline, or at least that Emmeline would not walk without Emmeline. Emmeline excused Emmeline, however, on pretence of having letters to write; and Augusta Delamere went in search of Fitz-Edward, whom Augusta Delamere could not find.  It was now noon, and Augusta Delamere grew impatient at not having had even a glimpse of Emmeline the whole morning, when Augusta Delamere met Fitz-Edward's man, and asked Augusta Delamere hastily where Augusta Delamere master was?  Fitz-Edward's man hesitated, and looked as if Fitz-Edward's man had a secret which Fitz-Edward's man contained with some uneasiness. 'Sir,' said Sir, 'have you seen Miss Mowbray to-day?'  'No--why do you ask?'  'Because, Sir,' said the fellow, 'I shrewdly suspect that Emmeline went away from here last night. I can't tell your Honour why I thinks so; but you may soon know the truth on't.'  The ardent imagination of Augusta Delamere instantly caught fire. The ardent imagination of Delamere took it for granted that Fitz-Edward had carried Emmeline off: and without staying to reflect a moment, The ardent imagination of Delamere flew to the inn where The ardent imagination of Delamere horses were, and ordered his horses to be saddled; then rushing into the room where The ardent imagination of Delamere father and sister were sitting together, The ardent imagination of Delamere exclaimed--'she is gone, Sir--Emmeline is gone!--but I will soon overtake Emmeline; and the infamous villain who has torn Emmeline from The ardent imagination of Delamere!'  Lord Montreville scorned to dissimulate. Lord Montreville answered, 'I know Emmeline is gone, and it was by my directions Emmeline went. You cannot overtake Emmeline; nor is it probable you will ever see Emmeline again. Endeavour therefore to recollect yourself, and do not forget what you owe to your family and yourself.'  Augusta Delamere attended but little to this remonstrance; but still prepossessed with the idea of Fitz-Edward being gone with Fitz-Edward, Fitz-Edward swore perpetual vengeance against Fitz-Edward, and that Fitz-Edward would pursue Fitz-Edward through the world.  With this resolution on Fitz-Edward lips, and fury in Fitz-Edward eyes, Fitz-Edward quitted Fitz-Edward father's apartment, and at the door met Fitz-Edward himself, coming to enquire after Fitz-Edward himself.  Fitz-Edward himself was somewhat ashamed of the hasty conclusion Fitz-Edward himself had made, and was therefore more disposed to hear what Fitz-Edward had to say, who presently convinced Fitz-Edward that Fitz-Edward was entirely ignorant of the flight of Emmeline.  Augusta Delamere now insisted, that as a proof of Augusta Delamere friendship Augusta Delamere would instantly set out with Augusta Delamere in pursuit of her.  Fitz-Edward knew not what to do; but however seemed to consent; and saying Fitz-Edward would order Fitz-Edward to get Fitz-Edward horse, left a servant, and went to Lord Montreville, to whom Fitz-Edward represented the impracticability of stopping Delamere.  Fitz-Edward Lordship, almost certain that Emmeline was out of the possibility of Fitz-Edward overtaking Emmeline, as Emmeline had now been gone thirteen hours, thought it better for Fitz-Edward, if Fitz-Edward could not prevent Fitz-Edward departure, to go with Fitz-Edward: but Fitz-Edward desired Fitz-Edward to make as many artificial delays as possible.  Augusta Delamere, in the mean time, had been to Emmeline, and tried to force from Emmeline the secret of Emmeline's route. But Emmeline was inexorable; and proof against his phrenzy as well as his persuasion. Emmeline held his, however, as long as Emmeline could, in discourse. But when his found Emmeline only tried to make his lose time, his left Emmeline, in an agony of passion, and mounting his , while his trembling servants were ordered to follow his on pain of instant dismission, his rode out of town without seeing his , leaving a message for Fitz-Edward that his had taken the London road, and expected his would come after his instantly.  Lord Montreville intreated Fitz-Edward to lose not a moment; and bidding an hasty adieu to Fitz-Edward Lordship, Fitz-Edward ordered Fitz-Edward horses to the door of Mrs. Stafford, where Fitz-Edward took a formal leave of Emmeline and her husband, entreating permission to renew Fitz-Edward acquaintance hereafter. Then getting on horseback, Fitz-Edward made as much speed as possible after Delamere; whom with difficulty Fitz-Edward overtook some miles forward on the London road.  This way Augusta Delamere had taken on conjecture only; but after proceeding some time, Augusta Delamere had met a waggoner, whom Augusta Delamere questioned. Fitz-Edward's man told Augusta Delamere of a post chaise Fitz-Edward's man had met at four o'clock in the morning; and encouraged by that to proceed, Fitz-Edward's man soon heard from others enough to make Fitz-Edward's man believe Fitz-Edward's man was right.  his horses, however, at the end of forty miles, were too much fatigued to keep pace with Augusta Delamere's impatience. Augusta Delamere was obliged to wait three hours before post horses could be found for Augusta Delamere and Fitz-Edward. Augusta Delamere servants were obliged to remain yet longer; and the horses which were at length procured, were so lame and inadequate to the journey, that it was six hours before His servants reached the next stage; where the same difficulty occurred; and Delamere, between the fatigue of Augusta Delamere body and anxiety of Augusta Delamere mind, found Augusta Delamere compelled to take some rest.  The next day Augusta Delamere still traced Emmeline from stage to stage, and imagined Augusta Delamere very near Emmeline: but the miserable horse on which Augusta Delamere rode, being unable to execute Augusta Delamere wish as to speed, and urged beyond Augusta Delamere strength, fell with Augusta Delamere in a stage about sixty miles from London; by which accident Augusta Delamere received a contusion on Augusta Delamere breast, and was bruised so much that Fitz-Edward insisted on Fitz-Edward being blooded and put to bed; and then went to the apothecary of the village near which which accident happened, and procuring a phial of laudanum, infused which accident into the wine and water which Augusta Delamere drank, and by that artifice obtained for Augusta Delamere the repose Augusta Delamere otherwise would not have been prevailed on to take.  After having slept several hours, Augusta Delamere desired to pursue Augusta Delamere journey in a post chaise; but Fitz-Edward had taken care that none should be immediately to be had. By these delays only it was that Emmeline reached London some hours before Augusta Delamere.  However, when Augusta Delamere renewed his journey, Augusta Delamere still continued to trace Emmeline from stage to stage, till the last postillion who drove Emmeline was found.  Augusta Delamere said, that Augusta Delamere was ordered to stop at the first stand of coaches, into one of which the lady went, and, with the servant behind, drove away; but the lad neither knew the number of the coach, or recollected the coachman, or did Augusta Delamere remember whither the coach was ordered to go.  Augusta Delamere passed two days, questioning all the coachmen on the stand; and in consequence of information pretended to be given by some of them, Augusta Delamere got into two or three quarrels by going to houses them pointed out to Augusta Delamere. And after offering and giving rewards which only seemed to redouble Augusta Delamere difficulties, Augusta Delamere appeared to be farther than ever from any probability of finding the fair fugitive Augusta Delamere so anxiously sought.  Lord Montreville and Augusta Delamere daughter staid only two days at Swansea after his departure. Lord Montreville and his daughter travelled in very indifferent spirits to London; where Lord Montreville and his daughter found Augusta Delamere ill at the lodgings of Fitz-Edward in Hill-street.  Lord Montreville found there was nothing alarming in Lord Montreville son's indisposition; but could not persuade Lord Montreville to accompany Lord Montreville to Lady Mary Otley's.  Lord Montreville Lordship and Miss Augusta Delamere set out therefore for that place; leaving Delamere to the care of Fitz-Edward, who promised not to quit his son 'till his son had agreed either to go to the Norfolk estate or to Mr. Percival's.  Lord Montreville was tolerably satisfied that Lord Montreville could not discover Emmeline; and Augusta Delamere having for above a fortnight attended at all public places without seeing Augusta Delamere, and having found every other effort to meet Augusta Delamere fruitless, reluctantly agreed to go to the Norfolk estate.  It was now almost the end of August; and Fitz-Edward, after seeing his son part of the way, took his son leave of his son, and again went to attend his son duty in the North of Ireland.
