  Emmeline had now lost   Emmeline lover, at least for some time; and one of   Emmeline friends too was gone where   Emmeline could seldom hear of   Emmeline. These deprivations attached   Emmeline more closely than ever to   Emmeline.   Emmeline was gone to town; and except now and then a short and melancholy visit from Fitz-Edward, to whom Delamere had lent   Emmeline house at Tylehurst, they saw nobody; for all the neighbouring families were in London. they found not only society but happiness together enough to compensate for almost every other; and passed they time in a way particularly adapted to the taste of both.  Adjoining to the estate where   Emmeline resided, a tract of forest land, formerly a chase and now the property of a collegiate body, deeply indents the arable ground beyond the arable ground, and fringes the feet of the green downs which rise above the arable ground. This part of the country is called Woodbury Forest; and the deep shade of the beech trees with which This part of the country is covered, is broken by wild and uncultured glens; where, among the broom, hawthorn and birch of the waste, a few scattered cottages have been built upon sufferance by the poor for the convenience of fewel, so amply afforded by the surrounding woods. These humble and obscure cabbins are known only to the sportsman and the woodcutter; for no road whatever leads through Woodbury Forest: and only such romantic wanderers as Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline, were conscious of the beautiful walks which might be found among these natural shrubberies and solitary shades. The two friends were enjoying the softness of a beautiful April morning in these woods, when, in passing near one of a few scattered cottages, The two friends saw, at a low casement half obscured by the pendant trees, a person sitting, whose dress and air seemed very unlike those of the usual inhabitants of such a place. She was intent on a paper, over which She leaned in a melancholy posture; but on seeing the two ladies approach, She started up and immediately disappeared.  Tho' the distance at which The two friends saw She, and the obscurity of the window, prevented The two friends distinguishing the features of the stranger, The two friends saw that She was young, and The two friends fancied She was beautiful. The same idea instantly occurred to Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline; that it was some unfortunate young woman, whom Mr. Stafford had met with and had concealed there. Something of the same sort had happened once before, and Mrs. Stafford's anxiety and curiosity were both awakened by this incident. Tho' the latter was a passion Tho never indulged where it's object was the business of others, Tho could not repress it where it was excited by suspicion of a circumstance which so nearly concerned Tho.  Nor could Tho conceal from Emmeline Tho fears on this occasion; and Emmeline, tho' unwilling to encrease them, yet knew enough of Tho husband's conduct to believe them were too well founded.  Mrs. Stafford had been accustomed to buy poultry of the woman who lived at this cottage, and therefore went in, in hopes of finding some vestige of the person them had seen, which might lead to an enquiry. But them found nothing but the usual humble furniture and few conveniences of such an house; and Mrs. Stafford forbore to enquire, lest the person Mrs. Stafford had seen might be alarmed and take more effectual means of concealment. But unable to rest, and growing every moment more desirous to know the truth, and to know the truth before Mrs. Stafford husband, whom Mrs. Stafford expected in a few days, returned, Mrs. Stafford arose very early the next morning, and, accompanied by Emmeline, went to the cottage in the forest.  The man who inhabited it was already gone out to The man who inhabited it work, and the woman to a neighbouring town to buy necessaries for Mrs. Stafford family. The door was open; and the ladies received this intelligence from three little children who were playing before The door.  the ladies entered the low, smoky room, usually inhabited by the family. And Mrs. Stafford, with a beating heart, determining to be satisfied, opened a door which led from it, into that, at the window of which Mrs. Stafford knew the stranger had appeared; and which the people of the house dignified with the appellation of the people of the house parlour.  In this room, on the brick floor, and surrounded by bare walls, stood a bed, which seemed to have been brought thither for the accommodation of some person who had not been accustomed to such an apartment.  Mrs. Stafford saw, sleeping in it, a very young woman, pale, but extremely beautiful; and Mrs. Stafford hand, of uncommon delicacy, lay on the white quilt--A sight, which gave Mrs. Stafford pain for Mrs. Stafford, and pity for the unfortunate person before Mrs. Stafford, affected Mrs. Stafford so much, that having stood a moment in astonishment, Mrs. Stafford stepped back to the place where Emmeline sat, and burst into tears.  The noise, however trifling, brought from above stairs a person evidently my Lady's maid, of very creditable appearance, who came down hastily into the room where Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline were, saying, as Mrs. Stafford descended the stairs--'I am coming immediately, my Lady.' But at the sight of two strangers, Mrs. Stafford stopped in great confusion; and at the same moment Mrs. Stafford mistress called to Mrs. Stafford.  Mrs. Stafford hastened, without speaking, to attend the summons; and shut the door after Mrs. Stafford. After remaining a few moments, Mrs. Stafford came out again, and asked Mrs. Stafford if Mrs. Stafford wanted the woman of the house?  To which Mrs. Stafford, determined whatever it cost Mrs. Stafford to know the truth, said--'No--my business is with my Lady.'  the woman of the house now appeared more confused than before; and said, hesitatingly--'I--I--my lady--I fancy you are mistaken, madam.'  'Go in, however, and let your mistress know that Mrs. Stafford desires to speak to the woman of the house.'  The maid reluctantly and hesitatingly went in, and after staying some time, came back.  'My mistress, Madam, says the woman of the house has not the pleasure of knowing you; and being ill, and in bed, the woman of the house hopes you will excuse the woman of the house if the woman of the house desires you will acquaint the woman of the house with your business by the woman of the house.'  'No,' replied Mrs. Stafford, 'I must see Mrs. Stafford the woman of the house. Tell Mrs. Stafford my business is of consequence to us both, and that I will wait till it is convenient to Mrs. Stafford to speak to the woman of the house.'  With this message The maid went back, with looks of great consternation, to your mistress. They fancied They heard somebody sigh and weep extremely. The maid came out once or twice and carried back water and hartshorn.  At length, after waiting near half an hour, the door opened, and the stranger appeared, leaning on the arm of Mrs. Stafford woman. Mrs. Stafford wore a long, white muslin morning gown, and a large muslin cap almost concealed Mrs. Stafford face; Mrs. Stafford dark hair seemed to escape from under it, to form a decided contrast to the extreme whiteness of Mrs. Stafford skin; and Mrs. Stafford long eye lashes hid Mrs. Stafford eyes, which were cast down, and which bore the marks of recent tears. If it were possible to personify languor and dejection, it could not be done more expressively than by representing Mrs. Stafford form, Mrs. Stafford air, Mrs. Stafford complexion, and the mournful cast of Mrs. Stafford very beautiful countenance.  Mrs. Stafford slowly approached Mrs. Stafford, lifted up Mrs. Stafford melancholy eyes to Emmeline, and attempted to speak.  'I am at a loss to know, ladies,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'what can be your'----But unable to finish the sentence, Mrs. Stafford sat down, and seemed ready to faint. The maid held Mrs. Stafford smelling bottle to Mrs. Stafford.  'I waited on you, Mrs. Stafford,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'supposing you were acquainted--too well acquainted--with my name and business.'  'No, upon my honour,' said the young person, 'I cannot even guess.'  'You are very young,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'and, I fear, very unfortunate. Be assured I wish not either to reproach or insult you; but only to try if you cannot be prevailed upon to quit a manner of life, which surely, to a person of your appearance, must be dreadful.'  'It is indeed dreadful!' sighed the young woman--'nor is it the least dreadful part of it that I am exposed to this.'  Mrs. Stafford now fell into an agony of tears; which affected both Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline so much, that forgetting Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline fears and suspicions, Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline endeavoured tenderly to console Mrs. Stafford. Having in some measure succeeded, and Mrs. Stafford having summoned resolution to tell Mrs. Stafford what were Mrs. Stafford apprehensions, the stranger saw that to give Mrs. Stafford a simple detail of Mrs. Stafford real situation was the only method Mrs. Stafford had to satisfy Mrs. Stafford doubts, and to secure Mrs. Stafford compassion and secresy; for which reason Mrs. Stafford determined to do it; and Mrs. Stafford, whose countenance was all ingenuousness as well as Mrs. Stafford heart, assured Mrs. Stafford Mrs. Stafford should never repent Mrs. Stafford confidence; while Emmeline, whose looks and voice were equally soothing and engaging to the unhappy, expressed the tenderest interest in the fate of a young creature who seemed but little older than Mrs. Stafford, and to have been thrown from a very different sphere into Mrs. Stafford present obscure and uncomfortable manner of life.  the stranger would have attempted to relate the stranger history to them immediately; but the stranger maid, a steady woman of three or four and thirty, told the stranger that the stranger was certainly unable then, and begged the ladies not to insist upon she was certainly unable then till the evening, or the next day; adding--'My Lady has been very poorly indeed all this week, and is continually fainting away; and you see, ladies, how much adding--'My Lady has been frightened this morning, and I am sure adding--'My Lady will not be able to go through this morning.'  To the probability of this observation, The two friends assented; and the young lady naming the next morning to gratify The two friends curiosity, The two friends left adding--'My Lady,   Emmeline first offering   Emmeline any thing   Emmeline house afforded. To which   Emmeline replied, that at present   Emmeline was tolerably well supplied, and only conjured The two friends to observe the strictest secresy, without which,   Emmeline said,   Emmeline was undone.  At the appointed time The two friends returned; equally eager to hear, and, if possible, to relieve, the sorrows of this young person, for whom The two friends could not help being interested, tho' The two friends yet knew not how far   Emmeline deserved The two friends pity.    Emmeline had prepared   Emmeline own little room as well as it would admit of to receive The two friends, and sat waiting The two friends arrival with some degree of composure. The two friends contemplated with concern the ruins of eminent beauty even in early youth, and saw an expression of helpless sorrow and incurable unhappiness, which had greatly injured the original lustre and beauty of   Emmeline eyes and countenance. A heavy languor hung on   Emmeline whole frame.   Emmeline tried to smile; but A heavy languor was a smile of anguish; and their looks seemed to distress and pain   Emmeline. Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline, to relieve   Emmeline, took out Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline, to relieve her work; and when Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline, to relieve her were seated at it,   Emmeline hesitated--then sighed and hesitated again--and at length seemed to enter on   Emmeline story with desperate and painful resolution, as if to get quickly and at once thro' a task which, however necessary, was extremely distressing.   Emmeline began in a low and plaintive voice; and frequently stopped to summon courage to continue, while   Emmeline wiped away the tears that slowly fell from   Emmeline eyes.         *       *       *       *       *  'I cannot believe I shall ever repent the confidence I am about to place in you. My heart assures me I shall not. Perhaps I may find that pity I dare no longer solicit from my own family; perhaps--but I must hasten to tell you her story, before its recollection again overwhelms me. Yet my fate has nothing in my fate very singular; numbers have been victims of the same calamity, but some have been more easily forgiven than I shall be.--Some are better able to bear infamy, and be reconciled to disgrace.  'My father, the late Earl of Westhaven, during the life of my grandfather, married, while he was making the tour of Europe, a very beautiful and amiable woman, the daughter of a man of rank in Switzerland; who having lost he life in the French service, had left a family without any provision, except for the eldest son. My grandfather, extremely disobliged by this marriage, made a will by which the eldest son gave to the eldest son only daughter every part of the eldest son extensive property, except what was entailed, and which went with the title; with this reserve, that the eldest son grandson should claim and inherit the whole, whenever his grandson became Lord Westhaven. By a will by which he gave to his only daughter every part of his extensive property, his grandson disinherited my father for his grandson life; and Tho his grandson survived my father's marriage five years, and knew his grandson had three children, the two younger of whom must be inevitably impoverished by such a disposition, his grandson obstinately refused to alter the will his grandson made under the first impulse of resentment, and died before his grandson could prevail upon the eldest son, by means of three children general friends, to withdraw the maledictions with which his grandson had loaded his grandson.  'his grandson death, not only hurt my father in his grandson feelings, but irreparably in my father fortune. my father sister, who was married to a Scottish nobleman, took possession of estates to the amount of fifteen thousand a year; and all that remained to my father, to support my father rank and my father encreasing family, was little more than three thousand; and even that income my father had considerably diminished, by taking up money, which my father was obliged to do while my grandfather lived, for the actual maintenance of my grandfather family.  'These unhappy circumstances, while These unhappy circumstances injured the health and spirits of my father, diminished not my grandfather tenderness for my grandfather wife, whom my grandfather loved with unabated passion.  'To retrench as much as possible, my grandfather retired with my grandfather and my grandfather three children to an estate, which being attached to the title, belonged to my grandfather in Cumberland; in hopes of being able to live on the income my grandfather had left, and to clear off the burden with which my grandfather had been compelled to load my grandfather paternal estates. But a slow fever, the effect of sorrow, had seized on my mother, then far advanced in my mother pregnancy with me; my father, solicitous to save my mother in whom all his happiness was centered, sent to London for the best advice to attend my mother. But their assistance was vain; the fever encreased upon my mother, and my mother died three weeks after my birth, leaving my father deprived of every thing that could make life valuable in my father estimation. my father gave my father up to a despair equal to the violence of my father love, and would probably have fallen a victim to a victim, had not the servants sent to Mr. Thirston, and for whom my father had the greatest friendship and respect. This excellent man represented to This excellent man that it was This excellent man duty to live for the children of This excellent man deplored Adelina; and This excellent man consented to try to live.  'It was long before This excellent man could bear to see any of us; particularly me, whom This excellent man beheld with a mixture of tenderness and regret. The gloomy solitude in which This excellent man lived, where every object reminded This excellent man of her whose smiles had rendered it a paradise, was ill calculated to meliorate This excellent man affliction; but This excellent man could not be persuaded, for some months, to leave his affliction, or could This excellent man be diverted from going every evening to visit the spot where lay the relicts of his deplored Adelina.  'At length Mr. Thirston prevailed on Mr. Thirston to go abroad. But Mr. Thirston could not determine to leave my elder brother, then about five years old, of whom Mr. Thirston was passionately fond. my elder brother, then about five years old, of whom he was passionately fond embarked for Naples; and Mr. Thirston remained abroad five years; while my sister, my brother William, and myself, were left at Kensington, under the care of a female relation, and received such instruction as our ages admitted.  'my father returned to England only to place my father at Eton. Finding no relief from the sorrow which perpetually preyed on the eldest son, but in continual change of place, my father soon afterwards went again abroad, and wandered over Europe for almost seven years longer, returning once or twice to England in that interval to satisfy my father of our health and the progress of our education.  'When my father last returned, my elder brother, then near eighteen, desired to be allowed to go into the army. my father reluctantly consented; and the regiment into which my father purchased was soon after ordered abroad. The grief the departure of my father gave the eldest son, was somewhat relieved by seeing the eldest son elder daughter advantageously disposed of in marriage to the eldest son of an Irish peer. The beauty of Lady Camilla was so conspicuous, and Lady Camilla manners so charming, that though entirely without fortune, the family of Lady Camilla could not object to the marriage. Lady Camilla went to Ireland with Lady Camilla Lord; and it was long before I saw Lady Camilla again.  'My brother William, who had always been designed for the navy, left me also for a three years station in the Mediterranean; and I was now always alone with my governess and my old relation, whose temper, soured by disappointment and not naturally chearful, made Lady Camilla a very unpleasant companion for a girl of fourteen. I learned, from masters who attended me from London, all the usual accomplishments; but of the world I knew nothing, and impatiently waited for the time when I should be sixteen; for then the Dutchess of B----, who had kindly undertaken to introduce my sister into company, had promised that my sister would afford me also my sister countenance. I remember my sister smiled, and told me that as I was not less pretty than Lady Camilla, I might probably have as good fortune, if I was but as accomplished. To be accomplished, therefore, I endeavoured with all my power; but the time seemed insupportably long, before this essay was to be made. this essay was to be made was relieved, tho' mournfully, by frequent visits from my father; who was accustomed to sit whole hours looking at me, while his tears bore witness to the great resemblance I had to my mother. My voice too, particularly when we conversed in French, frequently made his start, as if his again heard that which his had never ceased to remember and to regret. his would then fondly press me to his heart, and call me his poor orphan girl, the image of his lost Adelina!  'Tho' my mother had been now dead above fifteen years, Tho passion for my mother memory seemed not at all abated. Tho had, by a long residence abroad, paid off the debts with which Tho had incumbered Tho income, but could do no more; and the expences necessary for young men of my brothers' rank pressed hardly upon Tho. Ever since Tho return to England, Tho friends had entreated Tho to attempt, by marrying a woman of fortune, to repair the deficiency of Tho own; representing to Tho, that to provide for the children of his deplored Adelina, would be a better proof of Tho affection to her memory than indulging a vain and useless regret.  'Tho had however long escaped from their importunity by objecting, on some pretence or other, to all the great fortunes which were pointed out to Tho--Tho heart rejected with abhorrence every idea of a second marriage. But my brothers' every day required a larger supply of money to support my brothers' as my brothers' birth demanded; and to my brothers' interest my father at length determined to sacrifice the remainder of a life, which had on Tho own account no longer any value. The heiress of a rich grocer in the city was soon discovered by The heiress of a rich grocer in the city assiduous friends, who was reputed to be possessed of two hundred thousand pounds. On closer enquiry, the sum was found to be very little if at all exaggerated by fame. Miss Jobson, with a tall, meagre person, a countenance bordering on the horrible, and armed with two round black eyes which Miss Jobson fancied beautiful, had seen Miss Jobson fortieth year pass, while Miss Jobson attended on Miss Jobson papa, in Leadenhall-street, or was dragged by two sleek coach horses to and from Hornsey. Rich as Miss Jobson father was, Rich as her father was would not part with any thing while Rich as her father was lived; and, by the assistance of two maiden sisters, had so guarded Rich as her father was from the dangerous attacks of Irishmen and younger brothers, that his only daughter had reached that mature period without hearing the soothing voice of flattery, to which his only daughter was extremely disposed to listen. My father, yet in middle age, and with a person remarkably fine, would have been greatly to his only daughter taste if Rich as her father was could have gratified, with a better grace, his only daughter love of admiration. But Rich as her father was friends undertook to court his only daughter for Rich as her father was; and Rich as her father was title still more successfully pleaded in Rich as her father was favour. his only daughter made some objection to Rich as her father was having a family; but as I alone remained at home, his only daughter at length agreed to undertake to be at once a mother-in-law and a Countess. While this treaty was going on, and settlements and jewels preparing, I was taken several times to wait on Miss JobsonMiss Jobson: but it was easy to see I had not the good fortune to please Miss Jobson.  'I was but just turned of fifteen, was full of gaiety and vivacity, and possessed those personal advantages, which, if _Miss Jobson_ ever had any share of _, were long since faded. Miss Jobson seemed conscious that the splendour of Miss Jobson first appearance would be eclipsed by the unadorned simplicity of mine; and Miss Jobson hated me because it was not in my power to be old and ugly. Giddy as I then was, nothing but respect for my father prevented my repaying with ridicule, the supercilious style in which Miss Jobson usually treated me. Miss Jobson vulgar manners, and awkward attempts to imitate those of people of fashion, excited my perpetual mirth; and as Miss Jobson dislike of me daily encreased, I am afraid I did not always conceal the contempt I felt in return. Miss Jobson Miss Jobson chose to pass some time at Tunbridge previous to Miss Jobson marriage. Thither my father followed Thither; and I went with my father, eager to make my first appearance in public, and to see whether the prophecies of the Duchess would be fulfilled.  'This experiment was made in a party from Tunbridge to Lewes Races, where I had the delight of dancing for the first time in public, and of seeing the high and old fashioned little head of Miss Jobson, who affected to do something which the Duchess thought was dancing also, almost at the end of the set, while I, as an Earl's daughter, was nearly at the top. Had I been ever accustomed to appear in public, these distinctions would have been too familiar to have given me any pleasure; but now these distinctions were enchanting; and, added to the universal admiration I excited, intoxicated me with vanity. My partner, who had been introduced to me by a man of high rank the moment I entered the room, was a gentleman from the West of England, who was just of age, and entered into the possession of a fortune of eight thousand a year.  'Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name) followed us to Tunbridge, and frequently danced with me afterwards. Educated in obscurity, and without any prospect of the fortune to which Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name) succeeded by a series of improbable events, a man of high rank had suddenly emerged into life. a man of high rank was tolerably handsome; but had a heavy, unmeaning countenance, and was quite unformed. Several men of fashion, however, were kind enough to undertake to initiate a man of high rank into a good style of living; and for every thing that bore the name of fashion and ton, a man of high rank seemed to have a violent attachment. To that, I owed a man of high rank unfortunate prepossession in my favour.--I was admired and followed by men whom a man of high rank had been taught to consider as the arbiters of elegance, and supreme judges of beauty and fashion; but men whom he had been taught to consider as the arbiters of elegance, and supreme judges of beauty and fashion could only admire--men whom he had been taught to consider as the arbiters of elegance, and supreme judges of beauty and fashion could not afford to marry an indigent woman of quality; and men whom he had been taught to consider as the arbiters of elegance, and supreme judges of beauty and fashion told Trelawny that men whom he had been taught to consider as the arbiters of elegance, and supreme judges of beauty and fashion envied a man of high rank the power of pleasing himself.--So Trelawny was talked to about me, till a man of high rank believed a man of high rank was in love. In this persuasion a man of high rank procured a statement of a man of high rank fortune to be shewn to my father, by one of a man of high rank friends, and made an offer to lay it at my feet; an offer which, tho' my father would have been extremely glad to have me accept, a man of high rank answered by referring Trelawny to a man of high rank.  'I suspected no such thing; but with the thoughtless inattention of sixteen, remembered little of the fine things which were said to a man of high rank by Trelawny at the last ball. While I was busied in inventing a new _chapeau_ for the next, at which I intended to do more than usual execution, my father introduced Trelawny, and left the room. I concluded my father was come to engage me for the evening, and felt disposed to refuse my father out of pure coquetry; when, with an infinite number of blushes, and after several efforts, my father made me in due form an offer of my father heart and fortune. I had never thought of any thing so serious as matrimony; and indeed was but just out of the nursery, where I had never been told it was necessary to think at all. I did not very well know what to say to my admirer; and after the first speech, which I believe my admirer had learned by heart, my admirer knew almost as little what to say to a man of high rank; and my admirer was not sorry when I, in a great fright, referred my admirer to my father, merely because I knew not a man of high rank what answer to give my admirer. Our conversation ended, and my admirer went to find my father, while I, for the first time in my life, began to reflect on my prospects, and to consider whether I preferred marrying Mr. Trelawny to living with Miss JobsonMiss Jobson. To Miss JobsonMiss Jobson, I had a decided aversion; for Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name), I felt neither love or hatred. My mind was not made up on the subject, when my father came to a man of high rank: my father had seen Trelawny, and expressed my father greatly pleased with the prudence and propriety of my answer.  '"his deplored Adelina knows," continued his deplored Adelina, "that the happiness of my children is the only wish I have on earth; and I may tell my children, too, that my solicitude for my children exceeds all my other cares--solicitude, which will be at an end if I can see my children in the protection of a man of honour and fortune. If therefore, my love, you really do not disapprove this young man, whose fortune is splendid, and of whose character I have received the most favourable accounts, I shall have a weight removed from My mind, and enjoy all the tranquillity I can hope for on this side the grave.  '"You know how soon I am to marry Miss Jobson. A mother-in-law is seldom beloved. I may die, and leave you unprovided for; for you know, Adelina, the circumstances into which your grandfather's will has thrown me. Our dear Charles, whenever Our dear Charles inherits my title, will repossess the fortune of my ancestors, and will, I am sure, act generously by you and William; but such a dependance, if not precarious, is painful; and by accepting the proposal of Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name), all my apprehensions will be at an end, and his deplored Adelina secure of that affluence to which his deplored Adelina merit as well as his deplored Adelina birth entitles his deplored Adelina. But powerful as these considerations are, let these considerations are not influence you if you feel any reluctance to the match. Were these considerations are infinitely stronger, I will never again name these considerations are, if in doing so I hazard persuading his only daughter to a step which may render his only daughter for every unhappy."  'Tho' I was very far from feeling for Mr. Trelawny that decided preference which would in other circumstances have induced me to accept his hand, yet I found my father so desirous of my being settled, that as I had no aversion to a man of high rank, I could not resolve to disappoint my father. Perhaps the prospect of escaping from the power of my mother-in-law, and of being mistress of an affluent fortune instead of living in mortifying dependance on his only daughter, might have too much influence on my heart. my father, however, obtained without any difficulty my consent to close with Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name)'s proposals. We all went to London, where Lord Westhaven married Miss JobsonMiss Jobson, and the settlements were preparing by which Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name) secured to Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name) a jointure as great as I could have expected if my fortune had been equal to my rank.  'As the new Lord Westhaven was so soon to be relieved from the presence of a daughter Lord Westhaven did not love, Lord Westhaven behaved to Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name) with tolerable civility. Occupied with Lord Westhaven rank, Lord Westhaven seemed to have infinite delight in displaying it to Lord Westhaven city acquaintance. Lord Westhaven Ladyship thought a coronet so delightful an ornament, that the meanest utensils in Her Ladyship house were adorned with Her Ladyship; and Lord Westhaven wore Her Ladyship woven or worked on all Lord Westhaven cloaths, in the vain hope perhaps of counteracting the repelling effect of an hideous countenance, a discordant voice, and a manner more vulgar than either. I saw with concern that my father was not consoled by the possession of Lord Westhaven great fortune, for the mortification of having given the name and place of his deplored Adelina to a woman so unlike Lord Westhaven in mind and person. my father was seldom well; seldomer at home; and seemed to have no other delight than in hearing from my father two sons and from my father eldest daughter; and when we were alone, my father told me that to see me married would also give my father pleasure; but my father appeared, I thought, less anxious for the match than when it was first proposed. The preparations, however, went on, and in six weeks were compleated.  'In that interval, I had seen Trelawny almost every day. my father always seemed very good humoured, and was certainly very thoughtless. my father loved me, or fancied my father loved me, extremely; but I sometimes suspected that it was rather in compliance with the taste of others than my father own; and that a favourite hunter or a famous pointer were very likely to rival me. my father sometimes laughed at my father boyish fondness for such things, and the importance my father annexed to them; and sometimes I thought my father looked grave and hurt at observing it.  'For my own part, I saw my father follies; but none that I did not equally perceive in the conduct of other young men. Tho' I had no absolute partiality to Tho, I was totally indifferent to every other man. I married Tho, therefore; and gave away my person before I knew I had an heart.  'We went immediately into Cornwall, to an old fashioned but magnificent family seat; where I was received by Mr. Trelawny's sister, a woman some years older than Mr. Trelawny was, and who had brought Mr. Trelawny up. The coarse conversation of this woman, which consisted entirely in details of family oeconomy; and the stupidity of family oeconomy husband and a booby son of fourteen, were but ill calculated to render my retirement pleasing. Having laughed and wondered once at the uncouth figures and obsolete notions of Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name)'s Cornish cousins, who hastened, in their best cloaths, to congratulate him, from places whose barbarous names I could not pronounce--and having twice entertained the voters of two boroughs which belonged to the family; I had exhausted all the delights of Cornwall, and prevailed on him to return to a country where I could see a few beings like him.  'When I came back into the world, I was surrounded by a croud of idle people, whose admiration flattered the vanity of Trelawny more than the vanity of Trelawny did the vanity of Trelawny; for I became accustomed to adulation, and the vanity of Trelawny lost it's charms with the vanity of Trelawny's novelty. Trelawny was continually with young men of fashion, who called themselves Trelawny friends; and who besides doing Trelawny the kindness to advise and instruct Trelawny in the disposal of Trelawny fortune, would have relieved Trelawny from the affections of Trelawny wife, if Trelawny had ever possessed themselves. themselves made love to _me_, with as little scruple as themselves borrowed money of _Trelawny_; and told me that neglect on the part of her husband, well deserved to be repaid with infidelity on mine: but I felt for these shallow libertines only disgust and contempt; and received these shallow libertines professions with so much coldness, that their professions left me, in search of some other giddy creature, who might not, by ill-timed prudery, belie the promise of early coquetry. It was yet however very much the fashion to admire me; and her husband seemed still to take some delight in hearing and reading in the daily papers that Lady Adelina Trelawny was the most elegant figure at Court, or that every beauty at the Opera was eclipsed on _Lady Adelina Trelawny_ entrance. The eagerness and avidity with which I had entered, from the confinement of the nursery, to a life of continual dissipation, was now considerably abated. I continued it from habit, and because I knew not how to employ my time otherwise; but I felt a dreary vacuity in my heart; and amid splendor and admiration was unhappy.  'The return of my elder brother from my elder brother first campaign in America, was the only real pleasure I had long felt. my elder brother is perhaps one of the most elegant and accomplished young men of my elder brother time; but to be elegant and accomplished is my elder brother least praise--my elder brother solid understanding, and my elder brother excellent heart, are an honour to my elder brother country and to human nature. That quick sense of honour, and that strictness of principle, which now make my greatest terror, give a peculiar lustre and dignity to my elder brother character. my father received my elder brother with that delight a father only can feel; and saw and gloried with all a father's pride, in a successor worthy of a father ancestors.  'My brother, who had always loved me extremely, tho' we had been very little together, took up a father abode at my house while a father staid in England. Lady Adelina Trelawny seemed to feel a sort of awe before him, which made a father endeavour to hide a father vices if not a father weakness, while a father remained with we. a father was more attentive to me than a father had long been. my elder brother hoped I was happy; and Mr. Trelawny (for that was his name) Lady Adelina Trelawny was a man whose conversation afforded a father no pleasure, a father behaved to a father with every appearance of friendship and regard. a father was soon however to return to a father regiment; and my father, who had been in a declining state of health ever since a father second marriage, appeared to grow worse as the period of separation approached. a father seemed to have waited only for this beloved son to close a father eyes; for a few days before this beloved son was again to take leave, my father found this beloved son end very rapidly approaching.  'Perfectly conscious of it, my father settled all my father affairs; and made a provision for me and our dear William out of the money of the present Lady Westhaven, which the marriage articles gave this beloved son a right to dispose of after Her Ladyship's death if this beloved son left no children by her; and recommended no children to this beloved son.  '"You will act nobly by our dear William," said this beloved son; "I have no doubt of it; but above all, remember his deplored Adelina. Camilla is happily married. Tell Camilla I die blessing Camilla, and Camilla children! But his deplored Adelina--his deplored Adelina his deplored Adelina is Camilla but a child, and Camilla is very young and thoughtless. Watch over Camilla honour and Camilla repose, for the sake of my father and that dear woman Camilla so much resembles, your sainted mother."  'I was in the room, in an agony of sorrow. my father called me to my father. "his only daughter," said my father, in a feeble voice, "remember that the honour of your family--of your brothers--is in your hands--and remember it is sacred.--Endeavour to deserve the happiness of being sister to such brothers, and daughter to such a mother as his only daughter was!"  'I was unable to answer. I could only kiss my father convulsed hands; which I eagerly did, as if to tell my father that I promised all my father expected of me. My own heart, which then made the vow, now perpetually reproaches me with having kept the vow so ill!  'A few hours afterwards, my father died. My brother, unable to announce to me the melancholy tidings, took my hand in silence, and led me out of the house, which was now Lord Westhaven. my father had only a few days to stay in England, which my father employed in paying the last mournful duties to my father; and then embarked again for America, leaving my father affairs to be settled by my sister's husband, Lord Clancarryl, to whom my father wrote to come over from Ireland; for my elder brother William was now stationed in the West Indies, where my father obtained the command of a man of war; and our dear William knew, that to leave any material business to Lady Adelina Trelawny, was to leave any material business to ignorance and imbecility.  'In her husband, I had neither a friend or a companion--I had not even a protector; for except when even a protector was under the restraint of my elder brother's presence, even a protector was hardly ever at home. Sometimes even a protector was gone on tours to distant counties to attend races or hunts, to which even a protector belonged; and sometimes to France, where even a protector was embarked in gaming associations with Englishmen who lived only to disgrace their name. Left to pass my life as the wife of such a man as Trelawny, I felt my elder brother's departure as the deprivation of all I loved. But the arrival of my sister and her husband relieved me. I had not seen the arrival of my sister and her husband for some years; and was delighted to meet my sister happy with a man so worthy and respectable as Lord Clancarryl.  'her husband took possession on behalf of my brother of the estate my aunt was now obliged to resign; and as my sister was impatient to return to Ireland, where my sister had left my sister children, her children pressed me extremely to go thither with her children. Lady Adelina Trelawny was gone out on one of Lady Adelina Trelawny rambles; but I wrote to Lady Adelina Trelawny and obtained Lady Adelina Trelawny consent--indeed Lady Adelina Trelawny long since ceased to trouble Lady Adelina Trelawny about Lady Adelina Trelawny.  'I attended my sister therefore to Lough Carryl; on the beautiful banks of which my sister Lord had built an house, which possessing as much magnificence as was proper to their rank, was yet contrived with an attention to all the comforts of domestic retirement. Here Lord Clancarryl chose to reside the whole year; and her Lord never left it but to attend the business of Parliament at Dublin.  'her Lord tender attention to her Lord wife; her Lord ardent, yet regulated fondness for her Lord children; the peace and order which reigned in her Lord house; the delightful and easy society her Lord sometimes collected in his house, and the chearful confidence we enjoyed in quiet family parties when without company; made me feel with bitterness and regret the difference between my sister's lot and mine. _my sister_ husband made it the whole business of Her_ husband life to fulfill every duty of Her_ husband rank, _mine_ seemed only solicitous to degrade Her_ husband below Her_ husband. One was improving Her_ husband fortune by well regulated oeconomy; the other dissipating Her_ husband among gamesters and pick-pockets. The conversation of Lord Clancarryl was sensible, refined, and improving; Lady Adelina Trelawny's consisted either in tiresome details of adventures among jockies, pedigrees of horses, or scandalous and silly anecdotes about persons of whom nobody wished to hear; or Lord Clancarryl sunk into sullen silence, yawned, and shewed how very little relish Lord Clancarryl had for any other discourse.  'When I married Lord Clancarryl, I knew not to what I had condemned Lord Clancarryl. As Lord Clancarryl character gradually discovered itself, my reason also encreased; and now, when I had an opportunity of comparing Lord Clancarryl to such a man as Lord Clancarryl, I felt all the horrors of my destiny! and beheld, with a dread from which my feeble heart recoiled, a long, long prospect of life before Lord Clancarryl--without attachment, without friendship, without love.  'I remained two months in Ireland; and heard nothing of Lady Adelina Trelawny, 'till a match having been made on the Curragh of Kildare, on which Lord Clancarryl had a large bet depending, Lord Clancarryl came over to be present at it; and I heard with regret that I was to return with Lord Clancarryl. While Lord Clancarryl remained in Ireland, Lord Clancarryl disgusting manners, and continual intoxication, extremely displeased Lord Clancarryl; and I lived in perpetual uneasiness. A few days before we were to embark for England, George Fitz-Edward, his Lordship's younger brother, came from the north of Ireland, where his had been with his , to Lough Carryl; but it was only a passing visit to his family--his was going to England, and we were to sail in the same pacquet.'         *       *       *       *       *  At the mention of George Fitz-Edward, Lady Adelina Trelawny grew more distressed than Lady Adelina Trelawny had yet been in the course of Lady Adelina Trelawny narrative. Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline testified signs of surprize. Lady Adelina Trelawny observed it; and asked if Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline knew his? Lady Adelina Trelawny answered, Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline had some acquaintance with his; and Emmeline remarked that Lady Adelina Trelawny either never heard or had forgotten that his 's second title was Clancarryl.  his very name seemed to affect Lady Adelina Trelawny so much, and Lady Adelina Trelawny appeared so exhausted by having spoken so long, that tho' Lady Adelina Trelawny told Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline Lady Adelina Trelawny had but little to add to Lady Adelina Trelawny mournful story, Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline insisted upon Lady Adelina Trelawny permitting Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline to release Lady Adelina Trelawny till the evening, when Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline would attend Lady Adelina Trelawny again.
