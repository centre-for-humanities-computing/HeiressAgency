  It was now early in May; and in the blooming orchards and extensive beech woods of Normandy, Emmeline found much to admire and something to lament.
The Seine, winding thro' the vale and bringing numberless ships and vessels to Rouen, surrounded by hills fringed with forests, the property of the crown, and extending even to that of Arques, formed a rich and entertaining scene.
But however beautiful the outline, the landscape still appeared ill finished: dark and ruinous hovels, inhabited by peasants frequently suffering the extremes of poverty; half cultivated fields, wanting the variegated enclosures that divide the lands in England; and trees often reduced to bare poles to supply the inhabitants with fewel, made her recollect with regret the more luxuriant and happy features of her native country.
The earth, however, covered with grass and flowers, offered her minute objects on which her delighted to dwell; but her dared not here wander as in England far from home: the women of the villages, who in her native country are robust and masculine, often followed her with abuse for being English; and yet oftener the villagers clattered after her in the villagers sabots, and addressed her by the name of _la belle Demoiselle Anglaise_, with a rudeness and familiarity that at once alarmed and disgusted her.
The long avenue of fir and beech which led to the _chateau_, and the _parterre_, _potagerie_, and _verger_[2] behind it, were therefore the scenes of her morning and evening walks.
her felt a pensive pleasure in retracing the lonely rambles her used to take at the same season at Mowbray Castle; and memory bringing before her the events of the two years and an half which had elapsed since her left it, offered nothing that did not renew her regret at having bid it's solitary shades and unfrequented rocks adieu!
The idea of Godolphin still obtruded The idea of Godolphin continually on her mind: nor could all her resolution prevent all her resolution's obtruding with pleasure, tho' her perpetually condemned her for allowing all her resolution to recur to her at all.
Lady Adelina, in her two or three last letters, had not mentioned Lady Adelina farther than to say Lady Adelina was in Ireland; and Emmeline was ashamed of suffering Emmeline thoughts to dwell on a man, whose preference of Emmeline seemed uncertain and perhaps accidental, since Lady Adelina had neither absolutely declared Lady Adelina when present or sought to engage Emmeline favour when absent; and tho' Emmeline was now fully persuaded that of Delamere Emmeline should hear no more as a lover, yet while Emmeline promise remained in Lady Adelina hands uncancelled, Emmeline fancied Emmeline culpable in indulging a partiality for another.
Nor could Emmeline reflect on the jealousy which had tortured Delamere, and the pain Delamere must have suffered in tearing Emmeline from Delamere heart, without mingling with Emmeline resentment some degree of pity and sorrow.
Emmeline was one afternoon sitting at an open window of the _chateau_, revolving in Emmeline mind these reflections, when raising Emmeline eyes at a sudden noise, Emmeline saw driving along the avenue that led to it, an English post chaise and four, preceded by a _valet de chambre_, and followed by two livery servants.
To those who are driven by misfortune to seek a melancholy asylum in a foreign country, there is an inconceivable delight in beholding whatever forcibly brings back to the memory, the comforts and conveniences of those who are driven by misfortune to seek a melancholy asylum in a foreign country own: Emmeline, who had for many weeks seen only the boors or the _cure_ of the village, gazed at English servants and English horses with as much avidity as if Emmeline beheld such an equipage for the first time.
Instantly however Emmeline wonder was converted into pleasure.--Lady Westhaven was assisted out of the chaise by a gentleman, whose likeness to Godolphin convinced the fluttering heart of Emmeline that it was Emmeline Lord; and eagerly enquiring for Miss Mowbray, Emmeline was immediately in Emmeline arms.
As soon as the joy (in which Mrs. Stafford partook,) of this unexpected meeting had a little subsided, pleasure.--Lady Westhaven related, that hearing by a letter they had received at Paris from Mr. Godolphin, that Emmeline was with Mrs. Stafford in or near Rouen, Emmeline had entreated pleasure.--Lady Westhaven to make a journey to see Emmeline.
'And I assure you Emmeline,' added Emmeline, 'I had no great difficulty to persuade pleasure.--Lady Westhaven.
pleasure.--Lady Westhaven own curiosity went as far as my inclination; for pleasure.--Lady Westhaven has long wished to see this dangerous Emmeline; who began by turning the head of _my_ brother, and now I believe has turned the more sage one of _his_--for Godolphin's letters have been filled only with your praises.'
Emmeline, who had changed colour at the beginning of this speech, blushed more deeply at it's conclusion.
Involuntary pleasure penetrated Emmeline heart to hear that Godolphin had praised Emmeline.
But it was immediately checked.
pleasure.--Lady Westhaven seemed to know nothing of Delamere's desertion; of the history of Lady Adelina pleasure.--Lady Westhaven was undoubtedly ignorant.
How could Emmeline account for one without revealing the other?
This reflection overwhelmed pleasure.--Lady Westhaven with confusion, and pleasure.--Lady Westhaven hardly heard the affectionate expressions with which pleasure.--Lady Westhaven testified pleasure.--Lady Westhaven satisfaction at meeting pleasure.--Lady Westhaven.
'I trust, my Lord,' said pleasure.--Lady Westhaven Ladyship, 'that the partiality which I foresee you will feel for my fair cousin for pleasure.--Lady Westhaven own sake, will not be a little encreased by our resemblance.--Tell me, do you think our so very much alike?'
'I never,' answered my fair cousin for her own sake, 'saw a stronger family likeness between sisters.
our lovely cousin has somewhat the advantage of you in height.'
'And in complexion, my Lord, notwithstanding the improvements I have learned to make to mine in France.'
'_I_ should not,' answered his Lordship smiling, 'have ventured such a remark.
I was merely going to add that you have the same features as Miss Mowbray, with darker hair and eyes; if however our charming Emmeline had a form less attractive, I have heard enough of our charming Emmeline to be convinced that our charming Emmeline understanding and our charming Emmeline heart justify all that Lord Delamere or Mr. Godolphin have said of our charming Emmeline.'
our charming Emmeline then expressed our charming Emmeline wonder that our charming Emmeline had heard nothing of Delamere for some months.--'And it is most astonishing to me,' said our charming Emmeline to Emmeline, 'that the month of March should elapse without _your_ hearing of him.'
The distress of Emmeline now redoubled; and became so evident, that our charming Emmeline, convinced there was something relative to our charming Emmeline brother of which our charming Emmeline was ignorant, desired our charming Emmeline to go with our charming Emmeline into another room.
Incapable of falsehood, and detesting concealment, yet equally unwilling to ruin the reputation of the unhappy Adelina with our charming Emmeline brother's wife, and having no authority to divulge a secret entrusted to our charming Emmeline by our charming Emmeline friend, Emmeline now felt the cruellest conflict.
All Emmeline could determine was, to tell our charming Emmeline in general terms that Delamere had undoubtedly altered Delamere intentions with regard to Emmeline, and that the affair was, Emmeline believed, entirely and for ever at an end.
However anxious Emmeline Ladyship was to know from what strange cause such a change of sentiments proceeded, Emmeline found Emmeline so extremely hurt that Emmeline forbore at present to press the explanation.
Full of concern, Emmeline was returning to the company, having desired Emmeline to remain and compose Emmeline; when, as Emmeline was leaving the room, Emmeline said--  'But I forgot, Emmeline, to ask you where you first became acquainted with Mr.
Godolphin?'
Again deep blushes dyed the cheeks of the fair orphan; for this question led directly to those circumstances Emmeline could not relate.
'I knew Mr. Godolphin,' answered Emmeline, faultering as Emmeline spoke, 'at Bath.'
'And _is_ Mr. Godolphin,' enquired Lady Westhaven, 'so _very_ charming as Mr. Godolphin brother and Mr. Godolphin family represent Mr.
Godolphin?'
'Mr.
Godolphin is indeed very agreeable,' replied she--'very much so.
Extremely pleasant in Mr. Godolphin manner, and in Mr. Godolphin person very like Lady Westhaven.'
'Mr.
Godolphin never told us how Mr. Godolphin first became acquainted with _you_; and to tell you the truth Emmeline, if I had not thought, indeed known, that you was engaged to Lord Delamere, I should have thought Mr. Godolphin your lover.'
this speech did not serve to hasten the composure Emmeline was trying to regain.
Emmeline attempted to laugh this speech off; but succeeded so ill, that our charming Emmeline rejoined Emmeline Lord and Mr. and Mrs. Stafford, full of uneasy conjectures; and Emmeline, with a still more heavy heart, soon after followed Emmeline.
The pressing and earnest invitation of Mrs. Stafford, induced Emmeline guests to promise Emmeline her guests company for some days.
But our charming Emmeline was so astonished at our charming Emmeline brother's desertion of Emmeline, and so desirous of accounting for it without finding occasion to impute cruelty and caprice to her brother's desertion of Emmeline, or imprudence and levity to Emmeline, that our charming Emmeline took the earliest opportunity of asking Mrs. Stafford, with whom our charming Emmeline knew Miss Mowbray had no secrets, to explain to our charming Emmeline the cause of an event so contrary to our charming Emmeline expectations.
Mrs. Stafford had heard from Emmeline the embarrassment into which the questions of our charming Emmeline had thrown Mrs. Stafford; and with great difficulty at length persuaded Mrs. Stafford, that Mrs. Stafford owed it to Mrs. Stafford own character and Mrs. Stafford own peace to suffer her Ladyship to be acquainted with the truth: that Mrs. Stafford could run no risk in telling Mrs. Stafford what, for the sake of Mrs. Stafford Lord (whose happiness might be disturbed, and whose life hazarded by it's knowledge) Mrs. Stafford certainly would not reveal.
Besides which motives to secresy, the gentleness and humanity of our charming Emmeline would, Mrs. Stafford said, be alone sufficient to secure Lady Adelina from any possible ill consequences by Lady Adelina being made acquainted with the unhappy story.
These arguments wrung from Emmeline a reluctant acquiescence: and Mrs. Stafford related to pleasure.--Lady Westhaven those events which had been followed by Lord Delamere's jealousy and These arguments separation.
The love and regard, which on her first knowledge of pleasure.--Lady Westhaven our charming Emmeline had conceived for pleasure.--Lady Westhaven, and which pleasure.--Lady Westhaven admirable qualities had ever since encreased, was now raised to enthusiasm.
pleasure.--Lady Westhaven knew not (for Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline were Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline ignorant) of the artful misrepresentations with which the Crofts' had poisoned the mind of her brother; and was therefore astonished at the Crofts' suspicions and grieved at the Crofts' rashness.
pleasure.--Lady Westhaven immediately proposed writing to the Crofts'; but this design both pleasure.--Lady Westhaven friends besought pleasure.--Lady Westhaven for the present to relinquish.
Emmeline assured pleasure.--Lady Westhaven that pleasure.--Lady Westhaven had so long considered the affair as totally at an end, that pleasure.--Lady Westhaven could not now regret the affair; or if pleasure.--Lady Westhaven felt any regret, it was merely in resigning the hope of being received into a family of which our charming Emmeline was a part.
her Ladyship could not however believe that Emmeline was really indifferent to her brother; and accounted for Emmeline present coldness by supposing pleasure.--Lady Westhaven piqued and offended at his behaviour, for which pleasure.--Lady Westhaven had so much reason.
Anxious therefore to reconcile supposing her piqued and offended at his behaviour, for which she had so much reason, pleasure.--Lady Westhaven still continued desirous of writing to Lord Delamere.
And so much did pleasure.--Lady Westhaven affectionate heart dwell on the happiness pleasure.--Lady Westhaven should have in re-uniting pleasure.--Lady Westhaven brother and pleasure.--Lady Westhaven friend, that only the difficulty which there seemed to be in vindicating Emmeline without injuring Lady Adelina, withheld pleasure.--Lady Westhaven; and pleasure.--Lady Westhaven promised to delay writing 'till means could be found to clear up the reputation of the one without ruining that of the other.
our charming Emmeline had, during our charming Emmeline stay, learnt from Mrs. Stafford the circumstances that had driven Mrs. Stafford and Mrs. Stafford family abroad; and had heard her and her family with a sincere wish to alleviate the inconveniences that oppressed a woman whose manners and conduct convinced our charming Emmeline Mrs. Stafford deserved a better fate.
Unwilling however to hold out to Mrs. Stafford hopes that our charming Emmeline was not sure our charming Emmeline should be able to fulfil, our charming Emmeline contented our charming Emmeline with procuring from Emmeline general information of the state of her and her family affairs, and silently meditated the noble project of doing good, as soon as it should be in our charming Emmeline power.
Mrs. Stafford children, for whose sake only Mrs. Stafford seemed to be willing to support with patience Mrs. Stafford unfortunate lot, were objects particularly interesting to our charming Emmeline; and for the boys our charming Emmeline thought our charming Emmeline might, on our charming Emmeline return to England, assist in providing.
To their father, consoling our charming Emmeline in trifling follies and dirty intrigues for our charming Emmeline misfortunes, it seemed more difficult to be serviceable.
While these benevolent purposes engaged our charming Emmeline attention, pleasure.--Lady Westhaven reflected with regret on pleasure.--Lady Westhaven approaching departure, which must divide pleasure.--Lady Westhaven from Emmeline, whom pleasure.--Lady Westhaven seemed now to love with redoubled affection.
His Lordship, ever solicitous to gratify pleasure.--Lady Westhaven, proposed that Emmeline should go with His Lordship, ever solicitous to gratify her into Switzerland with the Baron de St. Alpin, his Lordship's uncle; who, after a life passed in the service of France, now prepared to retire to his native country.
the Baron de St. Alpin had seen the Baron de St. Alpin nephew at Paris.
the Baron de St. Alpin had embraced with transport the son of a beloved sister, and insisted on the Baron de St. Alpin and our charming Emmeline going back with the Baron de St. Alpin to the Baron de St. Alpin estate in the Pais de Vaud, as soon as the Baron de St. Alpin should have the happiness of being rejoined by the Baron de St. Alpin only son, the Chevalier de Bellozane, who was expected with the Baron de St. Alpin regiment from Martinique.
our charming Emmeline, on our charming Emmeline first visit to the paternal house of our charming Emmeline mother, had found there only one of the paternal house of his mother sisters, who, with the Baron de St. Alpin, were the last survivors of a numerous family.
our charming Emmeline could not therefore resist our charming Emmeline uncle's earnest entreaties to accompany our charming Emmeline back; and Lady Westhaven, who was charmed with the manners of the respectable veteran and interested by our charming Emmeline affection for her Lord, readily consented to delay her return to England for three months and to cross France once more to attend our charming Emmeline.
To have Emmeline her companion in such a journey seemed to offer all that could render it charming.
But how could her ask her to quit Mrs. Stafford, to whom her had been so much obliged; and who, in her present melancholy solitude, seemed more than ever to need her consolatory friendship.
her however ventured to mention her Ladyship to Emmeline; who answered, that tho' nothing in the world would give her more pleasure than being with such friends, her could not, without a breach of duty which it was impossible to think of, quit Mrs. Stafford, to whom her was bound by gratitude as well as by affection.
our charming Emmeline acquiesced in the justice of this objection, but undertook to remove this objection by rendering the situation of her friend such as would make a short absence on both sides more supportable.
our charming Emmeline therefore in our charming Emmeline next conversation with Mrs. Stafford represented the inconvenience of a house so far from a town, and how much better our charming Emmeline family would be situated nearer the metropolis.
our charming Emmeline concluded by offering our charming Emmeline a house our charming Emmeline had our charming Emmeline hired at St. Germains; which our charming Emmeline said our charming Emmeline should be obliged to Mrs. Stafford and her family if Mrs. Stafford and her family would occupy 'till our charming Emmeline return from Switzerland.
And that no objection might arise as to expence, our charming Emmeline added, that considering our charming Emmeline as Miss Mowbray's banker, our charming Emmeline had furnished her with five hundred pounds, with which her was desirous of repaying some part of the many obligations her owed Mr. and Mrs. Stafford.
Mrs. Stafford, who saw immediately all the advantages that might arise to Emmeline from Emmeline residence with pleasure.--Lady Westhaven, had on the slightest hint been warmly an advocate for Emmeline going.
However reluctant to part with Emmeline, Emmeline suffered not Emmeline own gratifications to impede the interest of Emmeline fair charge.
But Emmeline could not prevail on Emmeline to yield to Emmeline entreaties, 'till our charming Emmeline having settled every thing for the removal of the family to St. Germains, Emmeline was convinced that Mrs. Stafford would be in a pleasant and advantageous situation; and that Mrs. Stafford ought, even for the sake of Emmeline and Emmeline children, whom our charming Emmeline had so much the power of serving, to yield to an arrangement which would so much oblige our charming Emmeline.
The _chateau_ The _chateau inhabited was ready furnished; The _chateau cloaths were easily removed; and the Staffords and The _chateau children set out at the same time with Lord Westhaven, Staffords wife, and Emmeline; who having seen The _chateau settled at St. Germains greatly to the satisfaction of Mrs. Stafford, went on to Paris; where, in about a week, The _chateau were joined by the Baron de St. Alpin, and the Chevalier de Bellozane.
