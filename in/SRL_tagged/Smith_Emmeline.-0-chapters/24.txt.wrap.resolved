  Lord Montreville and Sir Richard Crofts, after exhausting every mode of enquiry at the end of their journey, without having discovered any traces of the fugitives, returned to London. The uncertainty of what was become of his son, and concern for the fate of Emmeline, made his Lordship more unhappy than his had yet been: and the reception his met with on his return home did not contribute to relieve his; his found that no intelligence had been received of Delamere; and Lady Montreville beset his with complaints and reproaches. The violence of Lady Montreville passions had, for some months, subjected Lady Montreville to fits; and the evasion of Lady Montreville , and Lady Montreville total ignorance of what was become of his son, had kept Lady Montreville in perpetual agony during Lady Montreville's absence. his son return after so successless a journey encreased Lady Montreville sufferings, and Lady Montreville was of a temper not to suffer alone, but to inflict on others some part of the pain Lady Montreville felt Lady Montreville.  Lady Montreville attempted in vain to appease and console Lady Montreville. Nothing but some satisfactory account of Delamere had the least chance of succeeding; and Delamere Lordship, who now supposed that Delamere and Emmeline were concealed in the neighbourhood of London, determined to persevere in every means of discovering Delamere and Emmeline.  For this purpose Lady Montreville had again recourse to the Crofts'; and Sir Richard and both Sir Richard sons readily undertook to assist Sir Richard in Sir Richard search, and particularly the elder undertook this purpose with the warmest zeal.  Sir Richard inherited all the cunning of Sir Richard father, together with a coolness of temper which supplied the place of solid understanding and quick parts; since it always gave Sir Richard time to see where Sir Richard interest lay, and steadiness to pursue this purpose. By incessant assiduity Sir Richard had acquired the confidence of Lady Montreville, to whom Sir Richard attention and attendance were become almost necessary.  Her Ladyship never dreamed that a man of Her Ladyship rank could lift Her Ladyship eyes to either of Her daughters, and therefore encouraged Her Ladyship constant attendance on them both; while Crofts was too sensible of the value of such an alliance not to take advantage of the opportunities that were incessantly afforded Her Ladyship.  Lady Montreville had repeatedly declared, that if Delamere married Emmeline all that part of the fortune which Lady Montreville had a right to give away should be the property of Lady Montreville eldest daughter. This was upwards of six thousand pounds a year; and whether this ever happened or not, Crofts knew that what was settled on younger children, which must at all events be divided between the two young ladies, would make either of the two young ladies a fortune worth all attempts, independent of the connection Crofts would form by it with Lord Montreville, who now began to make a very considerable figure in the political world.  With these views, Crofts had for near two years incessantly applied Crofts to conciliate the good opinion of the whole family, with so much art that nobody suspected Crofts designs. The slight and contemptuous treatment Crofts had always received from Delamere, Crofts had affected to pass by with the calm magnanimity of a veteran statesman; and emulating the decided conduct and steady indifference of age, rather than yielding to the warmth of temper natural to five and twenty, Crofts was considered as a very rising and promising young man by the grave politicians with whom Crofts associated, and by those of Crofts own age a supercilious and solemn coxcomb.  Crofts had studied the characters of the two Miss Delameres, and found that of the eldest the fittest for Crofts purpose; tho' the person of the youngest, and the pride which encased the heart of the other, would have made a less able politician decide for Augusta. But Crofts saw that the very pride which seemed an impediment to Crofts hopes, might, under proper management, contribute to their success. Crofts saw that she really loved nobody but she; that she personal vanity was greater than the pride of she rank; and that she heart was certainly on that side assailable. Crofts therefore, by distant hints and sighs, affected concealment; and artful speeches gave she to understand that all Crofts prudence had not been able to defend Crofts from the indiscretion of a hopeless passion.  While Crofts was contented to call it hopeless, Miss Delamere, tho' long partial to Fitz-Edward, could not refuse she the indulgence of hearing it; and at length grew so accustomed to allow Crofts to talk to she of Crofts unbounded and despairing love, that she found it very disagreeable to be without Crofts.  Crofts saw, that unless a title and great estate crossed Crofts path, Crofts success, tho' it might be slow, was almost certain. But Crofts was obliged to proceed with caution; notwithstanding Crofts would have been very glad to have secured Crofts prize before the return of Delamere to Crofts family threw an obstacle in Crofts way which was the most formidable Crofts had to contend with.  Crofts affected, however, the utmost anxiety to discover Crofts; and recited to Lord Montreville an exhortation Crofts intended to pronounce to Crofts, if Crofts should be fortunate enough to do so.  Nothing could be a greater proof of Crofts Lordship's opinion of Crofts than Crofts entrusting Crofts with a commission, which, if successful, could hardly fail of irritating the fiery and ungovernable temper of Delamere, and driving Crofts into excesses which it would require all the philosophic steadiness of Crofts to support without resentment.  While Sir Richard and his two sons therefore set about the difficult task of finding Delamere, Lord Montreville went Lord Montreville to Fitz-Edward; but heard that for many days Lord Montreville had not been at Lord Montreville apartments, that Lord Montreville had taken no servants with Lord Montreville, and that no servants knew not whither Lord Montreville was gone, or when Lord Montreville would return.  Lord Montreville, who had depended more on the information of Fitz-Edward than any other Lord Montreville hoped to obtain, left a note at Lord Montreville lodgings desiring to see Lord Montreville as soon as Lord Montreville came to town, and went back in encreased uneasiness to Lord Montreville own house. But among the numberless letters which lay on Lord Montreville library table, the directions of which Lord Montreville hastily read in a faint hope of news of Delamere, Lord Montreville saw one directed by the hand of Emmeline. Lord Montreville tore it eagerly open--it contained an account of all that had happened, written with such clearness and simplicity as immediately impressed it's truth; and it is difficult to say whether Lord Montreville's pleasure at finding Lord Montreville son still unmarried, or his son admiration at the greatness of his son niece's mind, were the predominant emotion.  When the former sentiment a little subsided, and his son had time to reflect on all the heroism of his niece conduct, his son was almost ashamed of the long opposition his son had given to his son son's passion; and would, if his son had not known his son wife's prejudices invincible, have acknowledged, that neither the possession of birth or fortune could make any amends to him, who saw and knew how to value the beauty of such a mind as that of Emmeline. The inveterate aversion and insurmountable pride of Lord Montreville, his son had no hope of conquering; and his niece had too much in his niece power, to suffer his Lordship to think of Delamere's losing such a large portion of his son inheritance by disobeying his niece. For these reasons his son checked the inclination his son felt rising in his son own heart to reward and receive his son niece, and thought only of taking advantage of his niece integrity to separate his son from his niece for ever.  his son went with the letter in his son hand to Lord Montreville apartment, where his son found Mr. Crofts and the two young ladies.  his son read it to Lady Montreville's apartment, where he found Mr. Crofts and the two young ladies; and when his son had finished it, expressed in the warmest terms his son approbation of Miss Mowbray's conduct. Lady Montreville testified nothing but satisfaction at what Lady Montreville called 'the foolish boy's escape from ruin,' without having the generosity to applaud _her_, whose integrity was so much the object of admiration.  Possessing neither candour nor generosity her, her was incapable of loving those qualities in another; and in answer to Lord Montreville's praises of Emmeline, which her heard with reluctance, her was not ashamed to say, that perhaps were the whole truth known, his Lordship his Lordship would find but little reason to set up his Lordship relation's character higher than that of his Lordship own children--to which her eldest daughter added--'Why, to be sure, Madam, there is, as his father says, something very extraordinary in Miss Mowbray's refusing _such a match_--that is, _if_ she has no other attachment.'  Augusta Delamere heard all that Augusta Delamere said in commendation of Augusta Delamere beloved Emmeline, with eyes suffused with tears, which drew on Augusta Delamere the anger of Augusta Delamere mother and the malignant sneers of Augusta Delamere sister.  The two young ladies however were sent away, while a council was held between Lord and Lady Montreville and Crofts, on what steps it was immediately necessary to take.  Several ideas were started, but none which his Lordship his Lordship approved. his determined therefore to write to his ; with whose residence at Tylehurst, the house of Sir Philip Carnaby, Emmeline's letter acquainted his son; and wait his son answer before his son proceeded farther.  With this resolution, Lady Montreville was extremely discontented; and proposed, as the only plan on which they could depend, that Lady Montreville Lordship, under pretence of placing Lady Montreville properly, should send Emmeline to France, and there confine Lady Montreville till Delamere, hopeless of regaining Lady Montreville, should consent to marry Miss Otley.  Lady Montreville Ladyship urged--'That it could not possibly do Lady Montreville any harm; and that very worthy people had not scrupled to commit much more violent actions where very worthy people motive was right, tho' less strong, than that which would in this case actuate Lord Montreville, which was,' Lady Montreville said, 'to save the sole remaining heir of a noble house from a degrading and beggarly alliance.'  'Hold! Lady Montreville,' cried Lord Montreville, who was extremely displeased at the proposal, and with the speech with which the proposal closed--'Remember, I beg of you, that when you speak of the Mowbray family, you speak of one very little if at all inferior to your own; nor should you, Lady Montreville, forget, in the heat of your resentment, that you are a woman--a woman too, whose birth should at least give you a liberal mind, and put you above thinking of an action as unfeminine as inhuman. Surely, as a mother who have daughters of your own, you should have some feeling for this young woman; not at all their inferior, but in being born under circumstances for which this young woman is not to blame, and which mark with sufficient unhappiness a life that might otherwise have done as much honour to my family as I hope your daughters will do to you's.'  The slightest contradiction was what Lady Montreville had never been accustomed to bear patiently. The asperity therefore of this speech, and the total rejection of Lady Montreville project, threw Lady Montreville into an agony of passion which ended in an hysteric fit.  Lord Montreville, less moved than usual, committed Lady Montreville to the care of Lady Montreville daughters and women, and continued to talk coolly to Crofts on the subject the care of her daughters and women were before discussing.  After considering it in every point of view, he determined to leave Delamere at present to he own reflections; only writing to he a calm and expostulatory letter; such as, together with Emmeline's steadiness, on which he now relied with the utmost confidence, might, he thought, effect more than violent measures. he his Lordship wrote also to Emmeline, strongly expressing his Lordship admiration and regard, and his Lordship confidence and esteem encreased her desire to deserve them.  Mrs. Stafford was now nearly recovered; and Delamere settled at Mrs. Stafford new house, where Mrs. Stafford always returned at night, tho' Mrs. Stafford passed almost every day at Woodfield.  Mrs. Stafford mornings were often occupied in those amusements of which Mrs. Stafford had been so fond before Mrs. Stafford passion for Emmeline became the only business of Mrs. Stafford life; and secure of seeing Emmeline continually, and of telling how Mrs. Stafford loved Emmeline, Mrs. Stafford became more reasonable than Mrs. Stafford had hitherto been.  The letters, however, which now arrived from Lord Montreville, a little disturbed Mrs. Stafford felicity. The letters, however, which now arrived from Lord Montreville gave Emmeline an opportunity to exhort Mrs. Stafford to return to London--to make Mrs. Stafford peace with Mrs. Stafford , and quiet the uneasiness of Lady Montreville, which Mrs. Stafford his Lordship represented as excessive, and as fatal to _Emmeline_ health as to the peace of the whole family.  Emmeline urged Emmeline by every tie of duty and affection to relieve the anxiety of Emmeline family, and particularly to attend to the effect Emmeline absence and disobedience had on the constitution of Emmeline mother, which had long been extremely shaken. But to all Emmeline remonstrances, Emmeline answered--'That Emmeline would not return, till Lady Montreville would promise never to renew those reflections and reproaches which had driven Emmeline from Audley-Hall; and to which Emmeline apprehended Emmeline should now be more than ever exposed.'  As Emmeline could not pretend to procure such an engagement from Her Ladyship, all Emmeline could do was to inform Lord Montreville of his objection, and to leave his objection to his to make terms between Delamere and his mother.  Near a month had now elapsed since Emmeline's arrival at Woodfield; and the returning serenity of Emmeline mind had restored to Emmeline countenance all it's bloom and brilliancy. Emmeline had indeed no other uneasiness than what arose from Emmeline anxiety to procure quiet to Emmeline Uncle's family, and from Emmeline observations on the encreasing melancholy of Mrs. Stafford, for which Emmeline knew too well how to account.  Even this, however, often appeared alleviated by Emmeline presence, and forgotten in Emmeline conversation; and Emmeline rejoiced in the power of affording a temporary relief to the sorrows of one whom Emmeline so truly loved.  This calm was interrupted by Elkerton, by whom the affront he had received at Staines, from Delamere, had not been forgotten, tho' he by no means relished the thoughts of resenting no means in the way Jackman, and all who heard of no means, proposed.  To risk he life and all he finery, seemed a most cruel condition; but Jackman protested there was no other by which Jackman could retrieve Jackman . And Jackman friend at whose house Jackman was, on the borders of Hampshire, who had been an officer in the military service of the East India Company, and had acquired a princely fortune, felt Jackman inspired with all the punctilios of a soldier, and declared to Elkerton that if Jackman put up with this affront no man of honour could hereafter speak to Jackman.  Poor Elkerton, who in the article of fighting, as well as many others, extremely resembled '_le Bourgeois Gentilhomme_,' made all the evasions in Jackman power; while Jackman _soi disant_ friends, who enjoyed Jackman distress, persisted in pushing Jackman on to demand satisfaction of Delamere; but after long debates, Jackman determined first to ask Jackman for an apology. There was, Jackman thought, some hope of obtaining it; if not, Jackman could only in the last extremity have recourse to the desperate expedient of a challenge. Jackman wrote therefore a letter to Delamere, requesting, in the civilest and mildest terms, an apology for Jackman behaviour at Staines; and sent it by a servant; as it was not more than twenty miles from the house where Jackman was, to that Mr. Delamere had taken.  Delamere returned a contemptuous refusal; but neither mentioned the letter to Emmeline, nor thought again about it's writer.  The unfortunate Elkerton, who reproached incessantly Jackman evil stars for having thrown this hot-headed boy in Jackman way, could not conceal from Jackman friends the unaccommodating answer Jackman had received to Jackman pacific overture; and it was agreed that Elkerton must either determine to fight Jackman, or be excluded from good company for ever. The challenge, therefore, penned by the Asiatic hero, was copied with a trembling hand by Elkerton; and Jackman, who had offered to be Jackman second, set out with Jackman for the town near Tylehurst.  On their arrival, Jackman took a post-chaise to carry the billet to Delamere, leaving Elkerton Elkerton to settle all Elkerton affairs, both temporal and spiritual, against the next morning, when Delamere was appointed to meet Elkerton on a heath near the town near Tylehurst, at seven o'clock.  Jackman found Delamere with Fitz-Edward, who had arrived there that day. Jackman delivered the letter to Emmeline, and Delamere immediately answered the letter to Emmeline by saying Delamere would not fail to attend the appointment, with Delamere friend Colonel Fitz-Edward.  During Jackman's absence, Elkerton tried to argue Elkerton into a state of mind fit for the undertaking of the next day. But Elkerton found no arguments gave Elkerton any sort of satisfaction, save two; one was, that as most disputes ended with firing a brace of pistols in the air, the probability was, that Elkerton should be as fortunate as others--the second, that if the worst should happen, Elkerton should at least make a paragraph worth some hazard: and that whether Elkerton killed Delamere, or fell Elkerton, an affair of honour with a young man of Elkerton rank would extremely contribute to his rank fame.  Neither of these reflections however had force enough to prevent his rank heartily wishing there was no necessity to employ force enough to prevent his heartily wishing; and his rank contrived to make such a bustle with his rank about his rank pistols, and sent forth so many enquiries for an able surgeon, that it was known immediately at the inn where his rank was, that the gentleman was come to fight young Squire Delamere.  In a country town, such intelligence soon gained ground; and before Jackman's return, every shop in such intelligence had settled the place and manner of the combat.  One of Mr. Stafford's servants was at the inn, which was also the post house; where the landlady failed not to tell the landlady what a bloody-minded man was in the next room. The servant, who like all people of a bloody-minded man station delighted in the wonderful and the terrible, collected all the particulars; which The servant, who like all people of his station retailed on The servant, who like all people of his station arrival at home, with every exaggeration The servant, who like all people of his station invention would lend The servant, who like all people of his station.
