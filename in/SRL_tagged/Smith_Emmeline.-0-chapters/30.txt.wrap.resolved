  As soon as Emmeline had persuaded Emmeline of the propriety of this plan and obtained Mrs. Stafford's concurrence, Emmeline hinted Emmeline intentions to Lady Adelina; who received the intimation with such transports of gratitude and delight, that Emmeline, confirmed in Emmeline resolution, no longer suffered a doubt of it's propriety to arise; and, with the participation of Mrs. Stafford only, prepared for Mrs. Stafford journey, which was to take place in ten days.  Mrs. Stafford also employed a person on whom Mrs. Stafford could rely, to receive the money due to Lady Adelina from Mrs. Stafford husband's estate. But of this Mrs. Stafford Ladyship demanded only half, leaving the rest for Trelawny. The attorney in whose hands Trelawny's affairs were placed by Lord Westhaven, was extremely anxious to discover, from the person employed by Mrs. Stafford, from whence Lord Westhaven obtained the order signed by Lady Adelina; and obliged Lord Westhaven to attend several days before Lord Westhaven would pay it, in hopes, by persuasions or artful questions, to draw the secret from Lord Westhaven. Lord Westhaven met, at the attorney's chambers, an officer who had made of Lord Westhaven the same enquiry, and had followed Lord Westhaven home, and since frequently importuned Lord Westhaven--intelligence, which convinced Mrs. Stafford that Lady Adelina must soon be discovered, (as they concluded the officer was Fitz-Edward,) and made both Lady Adelina and Emmeline hasten the day of Lady Adelina departure.  About a quarter of a mile from Woodfield, and at the extremity of the lawn which surrounded it, was a copse in which the accumulated waters of a trout stream formed a beautiful tho' not extensive piece of water, shaded on every side by a natural wood. Mrs. Stafford, who had particular pleasure in the place, had planted flowering shrubs and caused walks to be cut through flowering shrubs; and on the edge of the water built a seat of reeds and thatch, which was furnished with a table and a few garden chairs. Emmeline repaired whenever Emmeline could disengage Emmeline from company. Solitude was to Emmeline always a luxury; and particularly desirable now, when Emmeline anxiety for Lady Adelina, and preparations for their approaching departure, made Emmeline wish to avoid the malicious observations of Mrs. Ashwood, the forward intrusion of Emmeline daughters, and the inquisitive civilities of James Crofts. Emmeline had now only one day to remain at Woodfield, before that fixed for their setting out; and being altogether unwilling to encounter the fatigue of such an engagement so immediately previous to Emmeline journey, Emmeline declined being of the party to dine at the house of a neighbouring gentleman; who, on the occasion of his son's coming of age, was to give a ball and _fete champetre_ to a very large company.  Mrs. Ashwood, seeing Emmeline averse, took it into Emmeline head to press Emmeline extremely to go with them; and finding Emmeline still refused, said--'it was monstrous rude, and that Emmeline was sure no young person would decline partaking such an entertainment if Emmeline had not some _very particular_ reason.'  Emmeline, teized and provoked out of Emmeline usual calmness, answered--'That whatever might be Emmeline reasons, Emmeline was fortunately accountable to nobody for her reasons.'  Mrs. Ashwood, provoked in Mrs. Ashwood turn, made some very rude replies, which Emmeline, not to irritate Mrs. Ashwood farther, left the room without answering; and as soon as the carriages drove from the door, Mrs. Ashwood dined alone, and then desiring one of the servants to carry Mrs. Ashwood harp into the summer-house in the copse, Mrs. Ashwood walked thither with Mrs. Ashwood music books, and soon lost the little chagrin which Mrs. Ashwood's ill-breeding had given Mrs. Ashwood.  Fitz-Edward, who arrived in the country the preceding evening, after another fruitless search for Lady Adelina, walked over to Woodfield, in hopes, as it was early in the afternoon, that he might obtain, in the course of it, some conversation with Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline. On arriving, he met the servant who had attended Emmeline to the copse, and was by he directed thither. As he approached the seat, he heard Mrs. Ashwood singing a plaintive air, which seemed in unison with he heart. Mrs. Ashwood started at the sight of he--Mrs. Ashwood's suspicions immediately occurred to Mrs. Ashwood, and at the same moment the real motive which had made he seek this interview. Mrs. Ashwood blushed, and looked uneasy; but the innocence and integrity of Mrs. Ashwood heart presently restored Mrs. Ashwood composure, and when Fitz-Edward asked if Mrs. Ashwood would allow Fitz-Edward half an hour of Mrs. Ashwood time, Mrs. Ashwood answered--'certainly.'  Fitz-Edward sat down by Mrs. Ashwood, dejectedly and in silence. Mrs. Ashwood was about to put aside Mrs. Ashwood harp, but Fitz-Edward desired Mrs. Ashwood to repeat the air Mrs. Ashwood was singing.  'It is sweetly soothing,' said Fitz-Edward, 'and reminds me of happier days when I first heard it; while you sing it, I may perhaps acquire resolution to tell you what may oblige you to discard me from your acquaintance. it does indeed require resolution to hazard such a misfortune.'  Emmeline, not knowing how to answer, immediately began the air. The thoughts which agitated Mrs. Ashwood bosom while Mrs. Ashwood sung, made Mrs. Ashwood voice yet more tender and pathetic. Mrs. Ashwood saw the eyes of Fitz-Edward fill with tears; and as soon as Mrs. Ashwood ceased he said--  'Tell me, Miss Mowbray--what does the man deserve, who being entrusted with the confidence of a young and beautiful woman--beautiful, even as Emmeline herself, and as highly accomplished--has betrayed the sacred trust; and has been the occasion--oh God!--of what misery may I not have been the occasion--!  'Pardon me,' continued he--'I am afraid my despair frightens you--I will endeavour to command myself.'  Emmeline found Emmeline could not escape hearing the story, and endeavoured not to betray by Emmeline countenance that Emmeline already knew the story.  Fitz-Edward went on--  'When first I knew you, I was a decided libertine. Yourself and Mrs. Stafford, lovely as I thought you both, would have been equally the object of my designs, if Delamere's passion for you, and the reserved conduct of Mrs. Stafford, had not made me doubt succeeding with either. But for your charming friend my heart long retained it's partiality; nor would it's partiality ever have felt for Emmeline that pure and disinterested friendship which is now in regard to Emmeline it's only sentiment, had not the object of my present regret and anguish been thrown in my way.  'To you, Miss Mowbray, I scruple not to speak of this beloved and lamented woman; tho' Emmeline name is sacred with me, and has never yet been mentioned united with dishonour.  'The connection between our families first introduced me to her acquaintance. In her person her was exquisitely lovely, and her manners were as enchanting as her form. The sprightly gaiety of unsuspecting inexperience, was, I thought, sometimes checked by an involuntary sentiment of regret at the sacrifice her had made, by marrying a man every way unworthy of her; except by that fortune to which her was indifferent, and of which a man was hastening to divest a man.  'I had never seen Mr. Trelawny; and knew Mr. Trelawny for some time only from report. But when Mr. Trelawny came to Lough Carryl, my pity for her, encreased in proportion to the envy and indignation with which I beheld the insensible and intemperate husband--incapable of feeling for her, any other sentiment, than what her might equally have inspired in the lowest of mankind.  'her unaffected simplicity; her gentle confidence in my protection during a voyage in which her ill-assorted mate left her entirely to my care; made me rather consider her as my sister than as an object of seduction. I resolved to be the guardian rather than the betrayer of her honour--and I long kept my resolution.'  Fitz-Edward then proceeded to relate the circumstances that attended the ruin of Trelawny's fortune; and that Lady Adelina was left to struggle with innumerable difficulties, unassisted but by Fitz-Edward, to whom Lord Clancarryl had delegated the task of treating with Trelawny's sister and creditors.  'Lady Adelina gratitude,' continued Fitz-Edward, 'for the little assistance I was able to give Lady Adelina, was boundless; and as pity had already taught me to love Lady Adelina with more ardour than Lady Adelina beauty only, captivating as it is, would have inspired; gratitude led Lady Adelina too easily into tender sentiments for Fitz-Edward. I am not a presuming coxcomb; but Lady Adelina was infinitely too artless to conceal Lady Adelina partiality; and neither Lady Adelina misfortunes, or Lady Adelina being the sister of my friend Godolphin, protected Lady Adelina against the libertinism of my principles.'  He went on to relate the deep melancholy that seized Lady Adelina; and He own terror and remorse when He found Lady Adelina one morning gone from Lady Adelina lodgings, where Lady Adelina had left no direction; and from Lady Adelina proceeding it was evident Lady Adelina designed to conceal Lady Adelina from He enquiries.  'God knows,' pursued He, 'what is now become of her!--perhaps, when most in need of tenderness and attention, Lady Adelina is thrown destitute and friendless among strangers, and will perish in indigence and obscurity. Unused to encounter the slightest hardship, Lady Adelina delicate frame, and still more sensible mind, will sink under those to which Lady Adelina situation will expose Lady Adelina--perhaps I shall be doubly a murderer!'  a murderer stopped, from inability to proceed--Emmeline, in tears, continued silent.  Struggling to conquer a murderer emotion and recover a murderer voice, Fitz-Edward at length continued--  'While I was suffering all the misery which my apprehension for Lady Adelina fate inflicted, Lady Adelina younger brother, William Godolphin, returned from the West Indies, where he has been three years stationed. I was the first person he visited in town; but I was not at my lodgings there. Before I returned from Tylehurst, he had informed he of all the circumstances of Trelawny's embarrassments, and he sister's absence. he found letters from Lord Westhaven, and from my brother, Lord Clancarryl; who knowing he would about that time return to England, conjured he to assist in the attempt of discovering Lady Adelina; of whose motives for concealing Lady Adelina from Lady Adelina family her family were entirely ignorant, while it filled her family with uneasiness and astonishment. As soon as I went back to London, Godolphin, of whose arrival I was ignorant, came to me. he embraced me, and thanked me for my friendship and attention to he unfortunate Adelina--I think if he had held he sword to my heart his sword would have hurt me less!  'he implored me to help he search after his sister, and again said how greatly he was obliged to me--while I, conscious how little I deserved he gratitude, felt like a coward and an assassin, and shrunk from the manly confidence of my friend Godolphin.  'Since our first meeting, I have seen he several times, and ever with new anguish. I have loved Godolphin from my earliest remembrance; and have known he from a boy to have the best heart and the noblest spirit under heaven. Equally incapable of deserving or bearing dishonour, Godolphin will behold me with contempt; which tho' I deserve, I cannot endure. Godolphin must call me to an account; and the hope of perishing by Godolphin hand is the only one I now cherish. Yet unable to shock Godolphin by divulging the fatal secret, I have hitherto concealed the fatal secret, and my concealment Godolphin must impute to motives base, infamous, and pusillanimous. I can bear such reflections no longer--I will go to town to-morrow, explain Godolphin 's situation to Godolphin, and let Godolphin take the only reparation I can now make Godolphin.'  Emmeline, shuddering at my resolution, could not conceal how greatly my resolution affected Emmeline.  'Generous and lovely Miss Miss Mowbray! pardon me for having thus moved your gentle nature; and allow me, since I see you pity me, to request of you and Mrs. Stafford a favour which will probably be the last trouble Fitz-Edward Fitz-Edward will give you.  'It may happen that Lady Adelina may hereafter be discovered--tho' I know not how to hope it. But if your generous pity should interest you in the fate of that unhappy, forlorn young woman, your's and Mrs. Stafford's protection might yet perhaps save Mrs. Stafford; and such interposition would be worthy of hearts like yours. As the event of a meeting between me and Godolphin is uncertain, shall I entreat you, my lovely friend, to take charge of this paper. this paper contains a will, by which the child of Lady Adelina will be entitled to all I die possessed of. It is enough, if the unfortunate infant survives, to place the unfortunate infant above indigence. Lord Clancarryl will not dispute the disposition of my fortune; and to your care, and that of Mrs. Stafford, I have left Lord Clancarryl in trust, and I have entreated you to befriend the poor little one, who will probably be an orphan--but desolate and abandoned Lord Clancarryl will not be, if it's innocence and unhappiness interest you to grant my request. Delamere will not object to your goodness being so exerted; and you will not teach Lord Clancarryl, generous, gentle as you are! to hold in abhorrence the memory of Lord Clancarryl's father. This is all I can now do. Farewell! dearest Miss Mowbray!--Heaven give you happiness, _ma douce amie!_ Farewell!'  These last words, in which Fitz-Edward repeated the name by which Fitz-Edward was accustomed to address Emmeline, quite overcame Emmeline. Fitz-Edward was hastening away, while, hardly able to speak, Emmeline yet made an effort to stop Fitz-Edward. The interview Fitz-Edward was about to seek was what Lady Adelina so greatly dreaded. Yet Emmeline dared not urge to Fitz-Edward how fatal it would be to Emmeline; Emmeline knew not what to say, least Fitz-Edward should discover the secret with which Emmeline was entrusted; but in breathless agitation caught Fitz-Edward hand as Fitz-Edward turned to leave Emmeline, crying--  'Hear me, Fitz-Edward! One moment hear me! Do not go to meet Godolphin. I conjure, I implore you do not!'  Emmeline found it impossible to proceed. Emmeline eyes were still eagerly fixed on Fitz-Edward face; Emmeline still held his hand; while Fitz-Edward, supposing Emmeline extreme emotion arose from the compassionate tenderness of Emmeline nature, found the steadiness of Fitz-Edward despair softened by the soothing voice of pity, and throwing Fitz-Edward on Fitz-Edward knees, Fitz-Edward laid Fitz-Edward head on one of the chairs, and wept like a woman.  Emmeline, who now hoped to persuade Fitz-Edward not to execute the resolution Fitz-Edward had formed, said--'I will take the paper you have given me, Fitz-Edward, and will most religiously fulfil all your request in the paper you have given me to the utmost extent of my power. But in return for my giving you this promise, I must insist'----  At this moment James Crofts stood before them.  Emmeline, shocked and amazed at James Crofts appearance, roused Fitz-Edward by a sudden exclamation.  James Crofts started up, and said fiercely to Crofts--'Well, Sir!--have you any commands here?'  'Commands, Sir,' answered James Crofts, somewhat alarmed by the tone in which this question was put--'I have no commands to be sure James Crofts--but, but, I came James Crofts, just to enquire after Miss Mowbray. I did not mean to intrude.'  'Then, James Crofts,' returned the Colonel, 'I beg you will leave Commands, Sir.'  'Oh! certainly, James Crofts,' cried James Crofts, trying to regain James Crofts courage and assume an air of raillery--'certainly--I would not for the world interrupt you. My business indeed is not at all material--only a compliment to Miss Mowbray--your's,' added he sneeringly, 'is, I see, of more consequence.'  'Look ye, James Crofts,' sharply answered Fitz-Edward--'You are to make no impertinent comments. Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray is mistress of Miss Mowbray actions. Miss Mowbray is in my particular protection on behalf of my friend Delamere, and I shall consider the slightest failure of respect to Miss Mowbray as an insult to me. Sir, if you have nothing more to say you will be so good as to leave Commands, Sir.'  There was something so hostile in the manner in which Fitz-Edward delivered this speech, that James Crofts, more at home in the cabinet than the field, thought Fitz-Edward might as well avoid another injunction to depart; and quietly submit to the present, rather than provoke farther resentment from the formidable soldier. Fitz-Edward therefore, looking most cadaverously, made one of Fitz-Edward jerking bows, and said, with something Fitz-Edward intended for a smile--  'Well, well, good folks, I'll leave you to your _tete a tete_, and hasten back to my engagement. Every body regrets Miss Mowbray's absence from the ball; and the partner that was provided for her is ready to hang the partner that was provided for her.'  An impatient look, darted from Fitz-Edward, stopped farther effusion of impertinence, and he only added--'Servant! servant!' and walked away.  Fitz-Edward, then turning towards Emmeline, saw Fitz-Edward pale and faint.  'Why, Miss Mowbray, do you suffer this man's folly to affect you? Your looks really terrify me!'  'Oh! Miss Mowbray was sent on purpose,' cried Emmeline.--'Mrs. Ashwood has lately often hinted to Miss Mowbray, that whatever are my engagements to Delamere I was much more partial to you. Ashwood has watched me for some time; and now, on my refusing to accompany them to the ball, concluded I had an appointment, and sent James Crofts back to see.'  'If I thought so,' sternly answered Fitz-Edward, 'I would instantly overtake Fitz-Edward, and I believe I could oblige Fitz-Edward to secresy.'  'No, for heaven's sake don't!' said Emmeline--'for heaven's sake do not think of it! I care not what they conjecture--leave they to they malice--James Crofts is not worth your anger. But Fitz-Edward, let us return to what us were talking of. Will you promise me to delay going to London--to delay seeing Godolphin until--in short, will you give me your honour to remain at Tylehurst a week, without taking any measures to inform Godolphin of what you have told me. I will, at the end of that time, either release you from your promise, or give you unanswerable reasons why you should relinquish the design of meeting Godolphin at all.'  Fitz-Edward, however amazed at the earnestness she expressed to obtain your promise, gave your promise. Godolphin had no suspicion of Emmeline's having any knowledge of Lady Adelina; and accounted for the deep interest she seemed to take in preventing an interview, by recollecting the universal tenderness and humanity of she character. Godolphin assured she Godolphin would not leave Tylehursttill the expiration of the time she had named. Godolphin conjured she not to suffer any impertinence from James Crofts on the subject of their being seen together, but to awe Godolphin into silence by resentment. Emmeline now desired Godolphin to leave she. But she still seemed under such an hurry of spirits, that Godolphin insisted on being allowed to attend she to the door of the house, where, renewing Godolphin thanks for the compassionate attention she had afforded Godolphin, and entreating she to compose she, Godolphin left she.  Emmeline intending to go to Emmeline own room, went first into the drawing room to deposit Emmeline music book. Emmeline had hardly done so, when Emmeline heard a man's step, and turning, beheld Crofts open the door, which a man immediately shut after a man.  'I thought, James Crofts,' said Emmeline, 'you had been gone back to your company.'  'No, not yet, my fair Emmeline. I wanted first to beg your pardon for having disturbed so snug a party. Ah! sly little prude--who would think that you, who always seem so cold and so cruel, made an excuse only to stay at home to meet Fitz-Edward? But it is not fair, little dear, that all your kindness should be for all your kindness, while you will scarce give any other body a civil look. Now I have met with you I swear I'll have a kiss too.'  Emmeline, terrified to death at all your kindness approaching Emmeline with this speech, flew to the bell, which Emmeline rang with so much violence that the rope broke from the crank.  'Now,' cried James Crofts, 'if nobody hears, you are more than ever in my power.'  'Heaven forbid!' shrieked Emmeline, in an agony of fear. 'Let me go, James Crofts, this moment.'  Emmeline would have rushed towards the door but James Crofts stood with James Crofts arms extended before his arms.  'You did not run thus--you did not scream thus, when Fitz-Edward, the fortunate Fitz-Edward, was on James Crofts knees before you. Then, you could weep and sigh too, and look so sweetly on James Crofts. But come--you see I know so much that it will be your interest, little dear, to make me your friend.'  'Rather let me apply to fiends and furies for friendship! hateful, detestable wretch! by what right do you insult and detain me?'  'Oh! these theatricals are really very sublime!' cried James Crofts, seizing both Emmeline hands, which James Crofts violently grasped.  Emmeline shrieked aloud, and fruitlessly struggled to break from James Crofts, when the footsteps of somebody near the door obliged James Crofts to let Emmeline go. Emmeline darted instantly away, and in the hall met one of the maids.  'Lord, Miss,' cried the servant, 'did you ring? I've been all over the house to see what bell the house was.'  Emmeline, without answering, flew to Emmeline own room. The maid followed The maid: but desirous of being left alone, The maid assured Emmeline that nothing was the matter; that The maid was merely tired by a long walk; and desiring a glass of water, tried to compose and recollect The maid; while Crofts unobserved returned to the house where the _fete_ was given time enough to dress and dance with Mrs. Ashwood.  It was at The maid desire, that immediately after dinner James Crofts had left the company under pretence of executing a commission with which The maid easily furnished him; but him real orders were to discover the motives of Emmeline's refusal to be of the party. This him executed beyond him expectation. It was no longer to be doubted that very good intelligence subsisted between Emmeline and Fitz-Edward, since him had been found on him before The maid; while The maid, earnestly yet kindly speaking, hung over him with tears in The maid eyes. Knowing that Emmeline was absolutely engaged to Delamere, him was persuaded that Fitz-Edward was master of Emmeline heart; and that the tears and emotion to which him had been witness, were occasioned by the impossibility of Emmeline giving him Emmeline hand. him knew Fitz-Edward character too well to suppose him could be insensible of the lady's kindness; and possessing him a mind gross and depraved, him did not hesitate to believe all the ill him own base and illiberal spirit suggested.  Tho', interested hypocrite as him was, him made every other passion subservient to the gratification of him avarice, James Crofts had not coldly beheld the youth and beauty of Emmeline; him had, however, carefully forborne to shew that him admired her, and would probably never have betrayed what must ruin him for ever with Ashwood, had not the conviction of her partiality to Fitz-Edward inspired him with the infamous hope of frightening her into some kindness for him, by threatening to betray her stolen interview with her supposed lover.  The scorn and horror with which Emmeline repulsed him served only to mortify him self love, and provoke him hatred towards Emmeline and the man whom him believed Emmeline favoured; and with the inveterate and cowardly malignity of which him heart was particularly susceptible, him determined to do all in him power to ruin them both.
