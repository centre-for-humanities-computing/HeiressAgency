  It was now impossible for Emmeline to avoid a conversation with Lord Delamere, which Lord Delamere sister urged Emmeline so earnestly to allow Lord Delamere. Bellozane was, by the French officers, with whom Bellozane principally lived, engaged out for two days; and Lord and Lady Westhaven easily found an opportunity to leave Emmeline with Delamere.  Bellozane was no sooner alone in Lady Westhaven presence, than Bellozane threw Bellozane on Bellozane knees before her--'Will you,' cried Bellozane, 'ah! will you still refuse to hear and to forgive me? Have I offended beyond all hopes of pardon?'  'No, my Lord.--I do most readily and truly forgive every offence, whether real or imaginary, that you believe you have committed against Bellozane.'  'You forgive me--But to what purpose?--Only to plunge me yet deeper into wretchedness. You forgive me--but you despise, you throw me from you for ever. Ah! rather continue to be angry, than distract me by a pardon so cold and careless!'  'If your Lordship will be calm--if you will rise, and hear me with temper, I will be very explicit with you; but while you yield to these extravagant transports, I cannot explain all I wish you to understand; and must indeed beg to be released from a conversation so painful to Sir, and to you so prejudicial.'  Delamere rose and took a chair.  'I need not, Sir,' said Emmeline, collecting all Emmeline courage, 'recall to your memory the time so lately passed, when I engaged to become your's, if at the expiration of a certain period Lord and Lady Montreville consented, and you still remained disposed to bestow on Sir the honour of your name.'  'What am I to expect,' cried Delamere, eagerly interrupting her--'Ah! what am I to expect from a preface so cold and cruel? You have indeed no occasion to recall to my memory those days when I was allowed to look forward to that happiness, which now, thro' the villainy of others, and my own madness and ideotism, I have lost. But, Emmeline, it must not, it cannot be so easily relinquished! By heaven I will not give you up!--and if but for a moment I thought----.'  'You seemed just now, Sir, disposed to hear me with patience. Since, however, you cannot even for a few minutes forbear these starts of passion, I really am unequal to the task of staying with you.'  She would then have hastened away; but Delamere forcibly detaining She, again protested Delamere would be calm, and again She went on.  'At that time, I will own to you, that without any prepossession, almost without a wish either to accept or decline the very high honour you offered me, I was content to engage Sir to be your wife; because you said such an engagement would make _you_ happy, and because I then knew not that it would render _me_ otherwise.'  'Was you even then thus indifferent? Had I no place in your heart, Emmeline, when you would have given me your hand?'  'Yes, Sir--you had then the place I now willingly restore to you. I esteemed you; I looked upon you with a sisterly affection; and had I married you, it would have been rather to have made you happy, than because I had any wish to form other ties than those by which our relationship and early acquaintance had connected our.'  'Ah! my angelic Emmeline! it will still make me happy! Let the reasons which then influenced you, again plead for Sir; and forget, O! forget all that has passed since my headlong folly urged me to insult and forsake you!'  'Alas! my Lord, that is not in my power! You have cancelled the engagements that subsisted between us; and, as I understand, have actually formed others more indissoluble, with a lady of high rank and of immense fortune--one whose alliance is as anxiously courted by your family, as mine is despised. Can your Lordship again fly from your promises? Can you quit at pleasure the affluent and high-born heiress as you quitted the deserted and solitary orphan?'  'Cursed, cursed cruelty!' exclaimed Delamere, speaking thro' his shut teeth--But go on, Emmeline! I deserve your severity, and must bear your reproaches! Yet surely you know that but for the machinations of those execrable Crofts', I should never have acted as I did--you know, that however destitute of fortune chance had made you, I preferred you to all those who might have brought me wealth!'  'I acknowledge your generosity, Sir, and on that head meant not to reproach. I merely intended to represent to you what you seem to have forgotten--that were I disposed to restore you the hand you so lately renounced, you could not take the hand you so lately renounced; since Miss Otley will certainly not relinquish the claim you have given Miss Otley to your regard.'  'You are misinformed.--I am under no engagement to Miss Otley.--I am not by heaven! by all that is sacred!'  'Were not all preparations for your marriage in great forwardness, Sir, when you left England? and must not your consent have been previously obtained before Lord Montreville would have made your consent? However, to put an end to all uncertainty, I must tell you, my Lord, with a sincerity which will probably be displeasing to you, that my affections--'  'Are no longer in your own power!' cried Lord Montreville, hastily interrupting her--'Speak, Madam--is it not so?'  'I did not say that, Lord Montreville. I was going to assure you that I now find it impossible to command them--impossible to feel for you that preference, without which I should think Lord Montreville extremely culpable were I to give you my hand.'  'I understand you, Madam! You give that preference to another. The Chevalier de Bellozane has succeeded to your affections. The Chevalier de Bellozane has doubtless made good use of the opportunities The Chevalier de Bellozane has had to conciliate your favour; but before The Chevalier de Bellozane carries The Chevalier de Bellozane good fortune farther, The Chevalier de Bellozane must discuss with Lord Montreville the right by which The Chevalier de Bellozane pretends to it.'  'Whether The Chevalier de Bellozane has or has not a right to pretend to my regard, Lord Montreville,' said Emmeline, with great spirit, 'this causeless jealousy, so immediately after you have been convinced of the fallacy of your supposition in regard to another person, convinces me, that had I unfortunately given you an exclusive claim to my friendship and affection, my whole life would have been embittered by suspicion, jealousy, and caprice. Recollect, my Lord, that I have said nothing of The Chevalier de Bellozane, nor have you the least reason to believe I have for The Chevalier de Bellozane those sentiments you are pleased to impute to Lord Montreville.'  'But can I doubt it!' exclaimed Delamere, rising, and walking about in an agony--'Can I doubt it, when I have heard you disclaim me for ever!--when you have told me your affections are no longer in your power!'  'No, Lord Montreville; my meaning was, what I now repeat--that as my near relation, as my friend, as the brother of Lady Westhaven, I shall ever esteem and regard you; but that I cannot command now in your favour those sentiments which should induce me to accept of you as my husband. What is past cannot be recalled; and tho' I am most truly concerned to see you unhappy, my determination is fixed and I must abide by my determination.'  'Death and hell!' cried the agonized Delamere--'It is all over then! You utterly disclaim me, and hardly think the agonized Delamere--'It worth while to conceal from me for whose sake I am disclaimed!'  Emmeline was terrified to find that Emmeline still persisted in imputing Emmeline estrangement from Emmeline to Emmeline partiality for The Chevalier de Bellozane; foreseeing that Emmeline would immediately fly to Emmeline, and that all Emmeline apprehended must follow.  'I beg, I entreat, Lord Delamere, that you will understand that I give no preference to The Chevalier de Bellozane. I will not only assure you of that, but I disclaim all intention of marriage whatever! Suffer me, my Lord, to entreat that you will endeavour to calm your mind and regain your health. Reflect on the cruel uncertainty in which you have left the Marquis and the Marchioness; reflect on the uneasy situation in which you keep Lord and Lady Westhaven, and on the great injury you do yourself; and resolutely attempt, in the certainty of succeeding, to divest yourself of a fatal partiality, which has hitherto produced only misery to you and to your family.'  'Oh! most certainly, most certainly!' cried Delamere, almost choaked with passion--'I shall undoubtedly make all these wise reflections; and after having gone thro' a proper course of Delamere, almost choaked with passion--'I, shall, possibly, with great composure, see you in the arms of that presumptuous coxcomb--that vain, supercilious Frenchman!--that detested Bellozane! No, Madam! no! you may certainly give yourself to him, but assure yourself I live not to see it!'  him flew out of the room at these words, tho' tho attempted to stop and to appease him. tho heart bled at the wounds tho had yet thought it necessary to inflict; and tho was at once grieved and terrified at him menacing and abrupt departure. tho immediately went tho after Lord Westhaven, to intreat Lord Westhaven to keep Bellozane and Delamere apart. Lord Westhaven Lordship was much disturbed at what had passed, which Emmeline faithfully related to His Lordship: Bellozane was still out of town; and Lord Westhaven, who now apprehended that on Delamere's meeting His Lordship His Lordship would immediately insult His Lordship, said His Lordship would consider what could be done to prevent their seeing each other 'till Delamere became more reasonable. On enquiry, His Lordship found that the Chevalier was certainly engaged with His Lordship companions 'till the next day. His Lordship therefore came back to Emmeline about an hour after His Lordship had left tho, and told tho that His Lordship thought it best for tho to set out that afternoon on tho way to St. Germains.  'You will by this means make this means difficult for Bellozane to overtake you, if His Lordship should attempt Bellozane; and when His Lordship sees you have actually fled from Delamere, His Lordship will be little disposed to quarrel with His Lordship, and will perhaps go home. As to Delamere, His Lordship sister and I must manage His Lordship as well as we can; which will be the easier, as His Lordship is, within this half hour, gone to bed in a violent access of fever. Indeed, in the perturbation of mind His Lordship now suffers, there is no probability of His Lordship speedy amendment; for as fast as His Lordship regains strength, His Lordship violent passions throw His Lordship frame again into disorder.--But perhaps when His Lordship knows you are actually in England, His Lordship may try to acquire, by keeping His Lordship quiet, that share of health which alone can enable His Lordship to follow you.'  Emmeline, eagerly embracing this advice, which she found had the concurrence of Lady Westhaven, prepared instantly for she departure; and embracing tenderly she two excellent friends, who hoped soon to follow she, and who had desired she to come to tenderly her two excellent friends, who hoped soon to follow her to reside as soon as tenderly her two excellent friends, who hoped soon to follow her were settled in London, where tenderly her two excellent friends, who hoped soon to follow her had no house at present, she got into a chaise, with Madelon, and attended by Le Limosin, who was proudly elated at being thus '_l'homme de confience_'[38] to Mademoiselle Mowbray, she left Besancon; she heart deeply impressed with a sense of Delamere's sufferings, and with an earnest wish for the restoration of Delamere peace.  Tho' Godolphin had been gone four days, and went post, so that she knew Tho' Godolphin must be at Paris long before she, she could not, as she proceeded on she journey, help fancying that some accident might have stopped Tho' Godolphin, and that she might overtake Tho' Godolphin. she knew not whether she hoped or feared such an encounter. But the disappointed air with which she left every post house where she had occasion to stop for horses, plainly evinced that she rather desired than dreaded it. she felt all the absurdity and ridicule of expecting to see Tho' Godolphin; yet still she looked out after Tho' Godolphin; and Tho' Godolphin was the object she sought when she cast she eyes round she at the several stages.  Without overtaking Tho' Godolphin, or being she overtaken by Bellozane, she arrived in safety and in the usual time at Paris, and immediately went on to St. Germains; Le Limosin being so well acquainted with travelling, that she had no trouble nor alarm during her journey.  When she got to St. Germains, she was received with transport by Mrs. Stafford and she family. she found she about to depart, in two days, for England, where there was a prospect of settling she husband's affairs; and she had undertaken to go alone over, in hopes of adjusting transport by Mrs. Stafford and her family for her husband speedy return; while her husband had agreed to remain with the children 'till her husband heard the success of she endeavours. Great was the satisfaction of Mrs. Stafford to find that Emmeline would accompany Emmeline to England; with yet more pleasure did Emmeline peruse those documents which convinced Emmeline that Emmeline fair friend went to claim, with an absolute certainty of success, Emmeline large paternal fortune.  Lord Westhaven had given Emmeline a long letter to the Marquis of Montreville, to whom Lord Westhaven desired Emmeline would immediately address Emmeline; and Lord Westhaven had also written to an eminent lawyer, Lord Westhaven friend, into whose hands Lord Westhaven directed Emmeline immediately to put the papers that related to Emmeline birth, and by no means to trust them with any other person.  With money, also, Lord Westhaven had amply furnished Emmeline; and Emmeline proposed taking lodgings in London, 'till Emmeline could settle Emmeline affairs with Lord Montreville; and then to go to Mowbray Castle.  On the second day after Emmeline reaching St. Germains, Emmeline began her journey to Calais with Mrs. Stafford, attended by Le Limosin and Madelon. When Calais with Mrs. Stafford, attended by Le Limosin and Madelon arrived there, Calais with Mrs. Stafford, attended by Le Limosin and Madelon heard that a passage boat would sail about nine o'clock in the evening; but on sending Le Limosin to speak to the master, Calais with Mrs. Stafford, attended by Le Limosin and Madelon learned that there were already more cabin passengers than there was room to accommodate, and that therefore two ladies might find it inconvenient.  As the evening, however, was calm, and the wind favourable, and as the two fair travellers were impatient to be in England, the two fair travellers determined to go on board. It was near ten o'clock before the vessel got under way; and before two the two fair travellers were assured the two fair travellers should be at Dover. the two fair travellers therefore hesitated not to pass that time in chairs on the deck, wrapped in the two fair travellers cloaks; and would have preferred doing so, to the heat and closeness of the cabin, had there been room for the two fair travellers in the cabin.  By eleven o'clock, every thing insensibly grew quiet on board. The passengers were gone to The passengers beds, the vessel moved calmly, and with very little wind, over a gently swelling sea; and the silence was only broken by the waves rising against it's side, or by the steersman, who now and then spoke to another sailor, that slowly traversed the deck with measured pace.  The night was dark; a declining moon only broke thro' the heavy clouds of the horizon with a feeble and distant light. There was a solemnity in the scene at once melancholy and pleasing. Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline both felt a solemnity in the scene. Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline both were silent; and each lost in her own reflections; nor did Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline both attend to a slight interruption of the stillness that reigned on board, made by a passenger who came from below, muffled in a great coat. He spoke in a low voice to the man at the helm, and then sat down on the gunwale, with He back towards the ladies; after which all was again quiet.  In a few minutes a deep sigh was uttered by a passenger who came from below; and then, after a short pause, the two friends were astonished to hear, in a voice, low, but extremely expressive, these lines, addressed to Night.                       SONNET      I love thee, mournful sober-suited Night,     When the faint Moon, yet lingering in her wane     And veil'd in clouds, with pale uncertain light     Hangs o'er the waters of the restless main.      In deep depression sunk, the enfeebled mind     Will to the deaf, cold elements complain,     And tell the embosom'd grief, however vain,     To sullen surges and the viewless wind.      Tho' no repose on thy dark breast I find,     I still enjoy thee--chearless as thou art;     For in thy quiet gloom, the exhausted heart,     Is calm, tho' wretched; hopeless, yet resign'd.     While, to the winds and waves, it's sorrows given,     May reach--tho' lost on earth--the ear of heaven!   'Surely,' said Mrs. Stafford in a whisper, 'it is a voice I know.'  'Surely,' repeated the heart of Emmeline, for Emmeline could not speak, 'it is the voice of Tho' Godolphin!'  'Do you,' reassumed Mrs. Stafford--'do you not recollect the voice of Godolphin?'  'Yes,' replied Emmeline. 'I think--I believe--I rather fancy it is--Mr. Tho' Godolphin.'  'Shall I speak to Mr?' asked Mrs. Stafford, 'or are you disposed to hear more poetry? Mr has no notion who are Mr auditors.'  'As you please,' said Emmeline.  Again the person sighed, and repeated with more warmth--       'And reach, tho' lost on earth--the ear of heaven!'   'Yes--if _she_ is happy, they will indeed be heard! Ah! that cruel _if_--_if_ she is happy! and can I bear to doubt it, yet leave she to the experiment!'  There now remained no doubt but that the stranger was Godolphin; and Emmeline as little hesitated to believe Emmeline the subject of Mr thoughts and of Mr Muse.  'Why do _you_ not speak to Mr, Emmeline?' said Mrs. Stafford.  'I cannot, indeed.'  'I must speak then, Mrs. Stafford;' and raising Emmeline voice, Emmeline said--'Mr. Tho' Godolphin, is it not?'  'Who is so good as to recollect me?' cried Tho' Godolphin, rising and looking round Tho' Godolphin. It was very dark; but Tho' Godolphin could just distinguish that two ladies were there.  Mrs. Stafford gave Tho' Godolphin Mrs. Stafford hand, saying--'Have you then forgotten your friends?'  Tho' Godolphin snatched her hand, and carried her hand to Tho' Godolphin lips.  'There is another hand for you,' said Mrs. Stafford, pointing to Emmeline--'but you must be at the trouble of taking Emmeline--'but.'  'That I shall be most delighted to do. But who is it? Surely it cannot be Miss Mowbray, that allows me such happiness?'  'Have you, in one little week,' said the faultering Emmeline, 'occasion to ask that question?'  'Not now I hear her voice,' answered Tho' Godolphin in the most animated tone--'Not when I hold her hand. But whence comes it that I find you, Madam, here? or how does it happen that you have left my brother and sister, and the happy Delamere?' the happy Delamere?' seemed to have recollected, after the happy Delamere?' first transport at meeting the happy Delamere?', that the happy Delamere?' was thus warmly addressing _the happy Delamere?'_ who was probably only going to England to prepare for the happy Delamere?' union with the happy Delamere?' rival.  'Do not be so unreasonable,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'as to expect Miss Mowbray should answer all these questions. But find a seat; and let us hear some account of yourself. You have also to make your peace with the happy Delamere?' for not seeing me in your way.'  Tho' Godolphin threw Tho' Godolphin on the deck at the deck feet.  'I find a seat here,' said Tho' Godolphin, 'which I should prefer to a throne. As to an account of the happy Delamere?', it is soon given. I met a friend, whose company induced me to come to Calais rather than travel thro' Normandy; and the haste he was in made it impossible for me to stop he. Miss Mowbray had refused to give me any commission for you; and I had nothing to say to you that would have given you any pleasure. I was, therefore, unwilling to trouble you merely with a passing enquiry.'  'But whence comes it that you sail only to-night, if her fair friend was so much hurried?'  'her fair friend went four days ago; but I--I was kept--I was detained at Calais.'  Emmeline felt a strange curiosity to know what could have detained her fair friend; but dared not ask such a question.  They then talked of Lord and Lady Westhaven.  'the happy Delamere?' is, I conclude, much better?' said Tho' Godolphin.  'When I took leave of Lord and Lady Westhaven,' coldly answered Emmeline, 'I did not think the happy Delamere?' much better than when we first saw the happy Delamere?'. the happy Delamere?' servant said His servant was almost as ill as when you, Sir, with friendship so uncommon, attended His servant.'  'Call it not uncommon, Madam!--It was an office I would have performed, not only for any Englishman in another country, but I hope for any human being in any country, who had needed Madam!--It. Should I then allow you to suppose there was any great merit in my rendering a slight service to the brother of Lady Westhaven; and who is besides _dear to one_ to whom _I_ owe obligations so infinite.'  The stress he laid on these words left Emmeline no doubt of he meaning. Emmeline was, however, vexed and half angry that he persisted in believing Emmeline so entirely attached to Delamere; and, for the first time Emmeline had ventured to think steadily on the subject, meditated how to undeceive he. Yet when Emmeline reflected on the character of Delamere; and remembered that the character of Delamere father would now claim an authority to controul Emmeline actions--that one would think the character of Delamere at liberty to call any man to an account who addressed Emmeline, and the other to refuse the character of Delamere consent to any other marriage than that which would be now so advantageous to the family--Emmeline saw only inquietude to Emmeline, and hazard to the life so dear to Emmeline, should Emmeline suffer the passion of Tho' Godolphin openly to be avowed.  'Is it not remarkable,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'that you should voluntarily have conducted us to France, and by chance escort us home?'  'Yes,' answered Godolphin.--'And a chance so fortunate for me I should think portended some good, was I sanguine, and had I any faith in omens.'  'Are you going immediately to London?'  'Immediately.'  'And from thence to East Cliff?'  'I believe I shall be obliged to stay in town a week or ten days.--But my continuance there shall be longer, if you or Miss Mowbray will employ me.'  The night now grew cold; and the dew fell so heavily, that Mrs. Stafford expressed Mrs. Stafford apprehensions that Emmeline would find some ill effects from it, and advised Emmeline to go down.  'Oh! no,' said Tho' Godolphin, with uncommon anxiety in his manner--'do not go down. There are so many passengers in the cabin, and it is so close, that you will find it extremely disagreeable. It will not now be half an hour before we see the lights of Dover; and we shall presently be on shore.'  Emmeline, who really apprehended little from cold, acquiesced; and '  Emmeline, who really apprehended little from cold, acquiesced continued to converse on general topics 'till '  Emmeline, who really apprehended little from cold, acquiesced landed.  Tho' Godolphin saw '  Emmeline, who really apprehended little from cold, acquiesced on shore immediately, and attended '  Emmeline, who really apprehended little from cold, acquiesced to the inn. Tho' Godolphin then told '  Emmeline, who really apprehended little from cold, acquiesced Tho' Godolphin must go back to see after the baggage, and left '  Emmeline, who really apprehended little from cold, acquiesced hastily. '  Emmeline, who really apprehended little from cold, acquiesced ordered a slight refreshment; and when a slight refreshment was brought in, Emmeline said--'Shall '  Emmeline, who really apprehended little from cold, acquiesced not wait for Tho' Godolphin?'  'The Gentleman is come in, Madam,' said the waiter, 'with another lady, and is assisting another lady up stairs. Would you please I should call Tho' Godolphin?'  Emmeline felt, without knowing the nature of the sensation, involuntary curiosity and involuntary uneasiness.  'No, do not call Tho' Godolphin,' said Mrs. Stafford--'I suppose Tho' Godolphin will be here immediately. But send His servant to us.'  Le Limosin attending, Le Limosin gave His servant some requisite orders, and then again enquired for Tho' Godolphin.  Le Limosin answered, that Le Limosin was gone to assist a lady to Le Limosin room, who had been very ill during the passage.  'Of which nation is Le Limosin, Le Limosin?'  'I am ignorant of that, Le Limosin, as I have not heard Le Limosin speak. _Monsieur Le Capitaine_ is very sorry for Le Limosin, and has attended Le Limosin the whole way, only the little time Tho' Godolphin was upon deck.'  'Is Le Limosin a young lady?' enquired Mrs. Stafford.  'Yes, very young and pretty.'  The curiosity of Mrs. Stafford was now, in spite of Mrs. Stafford, awakened. And the long stay Tho' Godolphin, gave to Emmeline such acute uneasiness, as Mrs. Stafford had never felt before. It is extraordinary surely, said Mrs. Stafford to Mrs. Stafford, that he should be thus anxious about an acquaintance made in a pacquet boat.  Mrs. Stafford grew more and more disturbed at he absence; and was hardly able to conceal Mrs. Stafford vexation from Mrs. Stafford, while Mrs. Stafford was ashamed of discovering it even to Mrs. Stafford. In about ten minutes, which had appeared to Mrs. Stafford above an hour, Tho' Godolphin came in; apologised, without accounting, for Tho' Godolphin stay, and while accounting made all together a slight repast, enquired how accounting intended to proceed to London and at what time.  On hearing that accounting thought of setting out about noon, in a chaise, Tho' Godolphin proposed accounting taking a post coach; 'and then,' added Tho' Godolphin, 'you may suffer me to occupy the fourth place.' To Mrs. Stafford willingly agreed; and Emmeline, glad to find that at least Tho' Godolphin did not intend waiting on Tho' Godolphin pacquet boat acquaintance to London, retired with somewhat less uneasiness than Mrs. Stafford had felt on Mrs. Stafford first hearing that Tho' Godolphin had brought such an acquaintance on shore.  After a few hours sleep, the fair travellers arose to continue the fair travellers journey. the fair travellers heard that Tho' Godolphin had long left Tho' Godolphin room, and was at breakfast with the lady whom Tho' Godolphin had been so careful of the preceding morning. At this intelligence Emmeline felt all Emmeline anxiety revive; and when Tho' Godolphin came into the room where they were to speak to they, hardly could Emmeline command Emmeline to answer Tho' Godolphin without betraying Emmeline emotion.  'Miss Mowbray is fatigued with Emmeline voyage,' said Miss Mowbray, tenderly approaching her--'The night air I am afraid has affected Emmeline health?'  'No, Miss Mowbray;' coldly and faintly answered Emmeline.  'How is another lady you was so good as to assist on shore, Miss Mowbray?' said Mrs. Stafford. 'I understand Mrs. Stafford was ill.'  Tho' Godolphin blushed; and replied, with some little embarrassment, 'Mrs. Stafford is better, Le Limosin, I thank you.'  'So,' thought Emmeline, 'Emmeline makes then no mystery of having an interest in another lady.'  'Are you acquainted with another lady?' enquired Mrs. Stafford.  'Yes.'  Politeness would not admit of another question: yet it was impossible to help wishing to ask it. Tho' Godolphin, however, turned the discourse, and soon afterwards went out. Emmeline felt ready to cry, yet knew not for what, and dreaded to ask Emmeline whether Emmeline had not admitted into Emmeline heart the tormenting passion of jealousy.  'Why should I be displeased,' said Emmeline. 'Why should I be unhappy? Tho' Godolphin believes me attached to the happy Delamere?', and has ceased to think of Tho' Godolphin; wherefore should I lament that Tho' Godolphin thinks of another; or what right have I to enquire into Tho' Godolphin actions--what right have I to blame them?'  The post coach was now ready. Emmeline, attended by Madelon, Mrs. Stafford, and Tho' Godolphin, got into it, and a lively and animated conversation was carried on between the two latter. Emmeline, in the approaching interview with Emmeline uncle, and in the wretchedness of Delamere, which Emmeline never ceased to lament, had employment enough for Emmeline thoughts; but in spite of herself they flew perpetually from those subjects to the acquaintance which Tho' Godolphin had brought with Tho' Godolphin from Calais.
