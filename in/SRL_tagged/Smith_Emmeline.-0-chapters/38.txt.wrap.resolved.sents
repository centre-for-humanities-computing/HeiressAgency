  Early the next morning, Emmeline arose; and looking towards the sea, saw a still encreasing tempest gathering visibly over it.
Emmeline wandered over the house; which tho' not large was chearful and elegant, and Emmeline fancied every thing in which tho' not large bore testimony to the taste and temper of which tho' not large master.
The garden charmed Emmeline still more; surrounded by copse-wood and ever-greens, and which seemed equally adapted to use and pleasure.
The country behind it, tho' divested of The country behind it foliage and verdure, appeared more beautiful than any Emmeline had seen since Emmeline left Wales; and with uncommon avidity Emmeline enjoyed, even amid the heavy gloom of an impending storm, the great and magnificent spectacle afforded by the sea.
By reminding Emmeline of Emmeline early pleasures at Mowbray Castle, it brought back a thousand half-obliterated and agreeable, tho' melancholy images to Emmeline mind; while it grandeur gratified Emmeline taste for the sublime.
As Emmeline was indulging these contemplations, the wind suddenly blew with astonishing violence; and before Mrs. Stafford arose, the sea was become so tempestuous and impracticable, that eagerly as Emmeline wished to return to Emmeline children Emmeline could not think of braving the wind.
Godolphin had seen Emmeline wandering along the cliff, and had resolutely denied Godolphin the pleasure of joining Emmeline; for from what had passed the evening before, Godolphin began to doubt Godolphin own power to forbear speaking to Emmeline of the subject that filled Godolphin heart.
They now met at breakfast; and Emmeline was charmed with Emmeline walk, tho' Emmeline had been driven from it by the turbulence of the weather, which by this time had arisen to an hurricane.
When They breakfast ended, Mrs. Stafford followed Lady Adelina, who wanted to consult Emmeline on something that related to the little boy; Godolphin went out to give some orders; and Emmeline retired to a bow window which looked towards the sea.
Could Emmeline have divested Emmeline mind of its apprehensions that what formed for Emmeline a magnificent and sublime scene brought shipwreck and destruction to many others, Emmeline would have been highly pleased with a sight of the ocean in its present tremendous state.
Lost in contemplating the awful spectacle, Emmeline did not see or hear Godolphin; who imagining Emmeline had left the room with Godolphin sister, had returned, and with Godolphin arms crossed, and Godolphin eyes fixed on Emmeline face, stood on the other side of the window like a statue.
The gust grew more vehement, and deafened Emmeline with The gust's fury; while the mountainous waves it's fury had raised, burst thundering against the rocks and seemed to shake the rocks very foundation.
Emmeline, at the picture Emmeline imagination drew of their united powers of desolation, shuddered involuntarily and sighed.
'What disturbs Miss Mowbray?'
said Godolphin.
Emmeline, unwilling to acknowledge that Emmeline had been so extremely absent as not to know Godolphin was in the room, answered, without expressing Emmeline surprise to see Godolphin there--'I was thinking how fatal this storm which we are contemplating, may be to the fortunes and probably the lives of thousands.'
'The gale,' returned Godolphin, 'is heavy, but by no means of such fatal power as you apprehend.
I have been at sea in several infinitely more violent, and shall probably be in many others.'
'I hope not,' answered Emmeline, without knowing what Emmeline said--'Surely you do not mean it?'
'A professional man,' said A professional man, smiling, and flattered by the eagerness with which Emmeline spoke, 'has, you know, no will of A professional man own.
I certainly should not seek danger; but it is not possible in such service as ours to avoid it.'
'Why then do you not quit it?'
'If I intended to give you a high idea of my _prudence_, I should say, because I am a younger brother.
But to speak honestly, that is not my only motive; my fortune, limited as it is, is enough for all my wishes, and will probably suffice for any I shall _now_ ever form; but a man of my age ought not surely to waste in torpid idleness, or trifling dissipation, time that may be usefully employed.
Besides, I love the profession to which I have been brought up, and, by engaging in which, I owe a life to my country if ever a life should be called for.'
'God forbid a life ever should!'
said Emmeline, with quickness; 'for then,' continued Emmeline, hesitating and blushing, 'what would poor Lady Adelina do?
and what would become of my dear little boy?'
Godolphin, charmed yet pained by this artless expression of sensibility, and thrown almost off his guard by the idea of not being wholly indifferent to Emmeline, answered mournfully--'To mournfully--'To, indeed, my life may be of some value; but to his my life is of none.
Ah, Miss Mowbray!
it might have been worth preserving had I----But wherefore presume I to trouble you on a subject so hopeless?
I know not what has tempted me to intrude on your thoughts the incoherences of a mind ill at ease.
Pardon me--and suffer not my folly to deprive me of the happiness of being your friend, which is all I will ever pretend to.'
his turned away, and hastened out of the room; leaving Emmeline in such confusion that it was not 'till Mrs. Stafford came to call Mrs. Stafford to Lady Adelina dressing-room, that Mrs. Stafford remembered where Mrs. Stafford was, and the necessity of recollecting Mrs. Stafford scattered thoughts.
When mournfully--'To met at dinner, Mrs. Stafford could not encounter the eyes of Godolphin without the deepest blushes: Lady Adelina, given wholly up to the idea of mournfully--'To approaching separation, and Mrs. Stafford, occupied by uneasiness of Mrs. Stafford own, did not attend to the singularity of Mrs. Stafford manner.
The latter had never beheld such a tempest as was now raging; and Mrs. Stafford could not look towards the sea, whose high and foaming billows were breaking so near whose high and foaming billows, without shivering at the terrifying recollection, that in a very few hours Mrs. Stafford children, all Mrs. Stafford held dear on earth, would be exposed to this capricious and furious element.
Tho' of the steadiest resolution in any trial that merely regarded Mrs. Stafford, Mrs. Stafford was a coward when these dear objects of Mrs. Stafford fondness were in question; and Mrs. Stafford could not help expressing to Godolphin some part of Mrs. Stafford apprehensions.
'As I have gained some credit,' answered Godolphin, 'for my sagacity in foreseeing the gale, I might perhaps as well not hazard the loss of the gale, by another prophecy, for which you, Lady Adelina, will not thank me.--It will be fine, I am afraid, to-morrow.'
'And the day following we embark for France,' said Mrs. Stafford; 'how providential that we could not sail yesterday!'
'Your heart fails you, my dear Mrs. Stafford,' replied Godolphin, 'and I do not wonder at Your heart.
But I will tell you what you shall allow me to do: I will attend you to-morrow to Southampton, where in the character of a veteran seaman I will direct your departure, (as the whole pacquet is yours) according to the appearance of the weather; and to indulge me still farther, you shall suffer me to see you landed at Havre.
Adelina, I know, will be wretched 'till Adelina hears you are safe on the other side; and will therefore willingly spare me to bring Adelina such intelligence; and give me at the same time a fortunate opportunity of being useful to you.'
Mrs. Stafford, secretly rejoiced at a proposal which would secure them a protector and as much safety as depended on human skill, could not conceal Adelina wish to assent to it; tho' Adelina expressed great reluctance to give him so much trouble.
Godolphin then consulted the eyes of Emmeline, which on meeting Godolphin were cast down; but Godolphin could not find that they expressed any displeasure at Godolphin offer: Godolphin therefore assured Mrs. Stafford that Godolphin should consider it as a pleasurable scheme with a party to whom Godolphin was indifferent; 'but when,' added Godolphin, 'it gives me the means of being of the least use to you, to Miss Mowbray, and your children, I shall find in it not only pleasure but happiness.
Alas!
how poorly it will repay the twentieth part of the obligation we owe you!'
it was settled therefore that Godolphin was to cross the channel with them.
Again Emmeline tried to be sorry, and again found Emmeline incapable of feeling any thing but satisfaction in hearing that Godolphin would be yet longer with them.
During the rest of the evening, Godolphin tried to assume a degree of chearfulness; and did in some measure feel it in the prospect of this farther temporary indulgence.
Lady Adelina, unable to conceal Lady Adelina concern, drooped without any effort to imitate Godolphin; and when Lady Adelina, unable to conceal her concern parted for the night, could not help deploring in terms of piercing regret Lady Adelina, unable to conceal her concern approaching separation.
The assurances Godolphin had given Lady Adelina, unable to conceal her concern of a favourable morning were fulfilled.
Lady Adelina, unable to conceal her concern found that tho' there was yet a considerable swell, the wind had subsided entirely, and that Lady Adelina, unable to conceal her concern might safely cross to Southampton.
The boat that was to convey Lady Adelina, unable to conceal her concern was ready; and Emmeline could not take leave of Lady Adelina without sharing the anguish which Emmeline could not mitigate.
Lady Adelina, unable to conceal her concern embraced silently and in tears; and Emmeline pressed to Emmeline heart the little boy, to whom Emmeline was tenderly attached.
Godolphin was a silent spectator of this melancholy farewel.
The softness of Emmeline's heart was to Godolphin Emmeline greatest charm, and Godolphin could hardly help repeating, in the words of Louis XIV--'She has so much sensibility that it must be an exquisite pleasure to be beloved by Emmeline!'
Godolphin sighed in remembering that such could not be Godolphin happiness; then wishing to shorten a scene which so violently affected the unsettled spirits of Lady Adelina, Godolphin would have led Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline away; but Lady Adelina insisted on following Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline to the shore; smiled thro' Lady Adelina tears; and promised to behave better.
Silently Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline walked to the sea-side.
Mrs. Stafford hastily embracing Mrs. Stafford, was handed into the boat by Godolphin; who then advancing with forced gaiety to Emmeline, about whom his sister still fondly hung, said--'Come, come, I must have no more adieus--as if you were never to meet again.'
'Ah!
who can tell,' answered Lady Adelina, 'that we ever shall!'
Emmeline spoke not; but kissing the hand of Emmeline weeping friend, gave Emmeline own to Godolphin; while Lady Adelina, resting on the arm of Emmeline woman, and overwhelmed with sorrow, suffered the boat to depart.
It rowed swiftly away; favoured by the tide.
Lady Adelina remained on the shore as long as Lady Adelina could distinguish Lady Adelina; and then slowly and reluctantly returned to solitude and tears: while Lady Adelina two friends, attended by Lady Adelina brother, landed safely at Southampton, where he busied he in settling every thing for her two friends, attended by her brother departure the next morning in the pacquet which her two friends, attended by her brother had hired, and which now lay ready to receive her two friends, attended by her brother.
During her two friends, attended by her brother passage to Havre, which was short and prosperous, the attention of Godolphin was equally divided between Mrs. Stafford, Lady Adelina children, and Emmeline.
But when he assisted the latter to leave the vessel, he could not forbear pressing Lady Adelina to he heart, while in a deep sigh he bade adieu to the happiness of being with Lady Adelina; for he concluded Lady Adelina would not long remain single, and after Lady Adelina was married he determined never more to trust he with the dangerous pleasure of beholding Lady Adelina.
he had never mentioned the name of Delamere; and knew not that he was returned to England.
Having once been assured of Lady Adelina engagement, he was unable to enquire into the circumstances of what had destroyed he happiness.
he knew they were to be married in March, and that Delamere had promised to remain on the Continent 'till that period.
he doubted not, therefore, but that Emmeline, in compliance with the entreaties of Emmeline lover, had consented to accompany Mrs. Stafford to France, and by Emmeline presence to charm away the months that yet intervened; after which he supposed they would be immediately united.
Notwithstanding some remarks he had made on the interest Emmeline seemed to take in regard to he, he imputed it merely to Emmeline general sensibility and to he relationship to Lady Adelina.
he supposed that Delamere possessed Emmeline heart; and tho' it was the only possession on earth that would give he any chance of happiness, he envied her lover without hating he.
he could not blame he for loving her, who was in he own opinion irresistible; nor for having used the opportunity he good fortune had given he of winning her affections.
The longer he conversed with her, The more he was convinced that Delamere, in being as he believed master of that heart, was the most fortunate of human beings.
But tho' he had not resolution enough to refuse he the melancholy yet pleasing gratification of contemplating perfections which he thought could never be he, and tho' he could not help sometimes betraying the fondness which that indulgence hourly encreased, he never seriously meditated supplanting the happy Delamere.
he did not think that to attempt it was honourable; and he integrity would have prevented the trial, had he supposed the trial possible to succeed.
Mrs. Stafford had at first seen with concern that Godolphin, whom Mrs. Stafford sincerely esteemed, was nourishing for Mrs. Stafford friend a passion which could only serve to make he unhappy.
But Mrs. Stafford now saw it's progress rather with pleasure than regret.
Mrs. Stafford was piqued at the groundless jealousy and rash injustice of Delamere towards Emmeline: and disappointed and disgusted at Lord Montreville's conduct towards Mrs. Stafford; sickening at the little sincerity of the latter, and doubtful of the temper of the former, Mrs. Stafford feared that if the alliance took place, her friend would find less happiness than splendour: and Mrs. Stafford looked with partial eyes on Godolphin; who in morals, manners, and temper, was equally unexceptionable, and whose fortune, tho' inferior to his birth, was yet enough for happiness in that style of life which Mrs. Stafford knew better calculated for the temper and taste of Emmeline than the parade and grandeur Mrs. Stafford might share with Delamere.
Godolphin had no parents to accept Mrs. Stafford with disdainful and cold acquiescence--no sister to treat Mrs. Stafford with supercilious condescension.--But all Godolphin family, tho' of a rank superior to that of Delamere, would receive Mrs. Stafford with transport, and treat Mrs. Stafford with the respect and affection Mrs. Stafford deserved.
Mrs. Stafford, however, spoke not to Emmeline of this revolution in Mrs. Stafford sentiments, but chose rather to let the affair take it's course than to be in any degree answerable for it's consequences.
The hour in which Godolphin was to leave them now approached.
Unable to determine on bidding Emmeline farewel, Godolphin would still have lingered with Mrs. Stafford, and would have gone on with them to Rouen, where Mrs. Stafford waited them arrival: but this, Mrs. Stafford was compelled to decline; fearing least this extraordinary attention in a stranger should induce Mrs. Stafford husband to make enquiry into them first acquaintance, and by that means lead to discoveries which could not fail of being injurious to Lady Adelina.
Of all that related to Mrs. Stafford, Godolphin was at present ignorant.
Godolphin had been told, that the infant which Godolphin wife and Miss Mowbray so often visited, was the son of an acquaintance of the latter; who being obliged soon after it's birth to go to the West Indies, had sent it to Bath to Emmeline, who had undertaken to overlook the nurse to whose care it was committed.
Into a circumstance which offered neither a scheme to occupy Godolphin mind, or money to purchase Godolphin pleasures, Mrs. Stafford thought it not then worth Mrs. Stafford while farther to enquire; but now, in a country of which Mrs. Stafford understood not the language, and detached from Mrs. Stafford usual pursuits, Mrs. Stafford knew not what strange suspicions the assiduity of Godolphin might excite in a head so oddly constructed; and without explaining Mrs. Stafford reasons to Godolphin, Mrs. Stafford said enough to convince Godolphin that Godolphin must, with whatever reluctance, leave the lovely travellers at Havre.
Godolphin busied Godolphin, however, in adjusting every thing for the safety of their journey; and being in the course of their preparations left alone with Emmeline in a room of the hotel, Godolphin could not forbear using the last opportunity Godolphin was likely to have of speaking to her.--  'Has Miss Mowbray any commands to Lady Adelina?'
'My most affectionate love!'
answered Emmeline, 'my truest remembrance!
And tell Emmeline, that the moment I am settled I will give Emmeline an account of my situation, and of all that happens worth Emmeline knowing.'
'We shall hear then,' said Godolphin, forcing a melancholy smile, 'we shall hear when you meet the fortunate, the happy Mr.
Delamere.'
'Lady Adelina,' blushingly replied Emmeline, 'will certainly know it if I should meet Godolphin; but nothing is at present more improbable.'
'Tis now,' reassumed Godolphin, 'the last week of January--February--March--ah!
how soon March will come!
Tell me, how long in that month may Lady Adelina direct to Miss Mowbray?'
'Mr.
Delamere, Sir,' said Emmeline, gravely, 'is not now in France.'
'But may Mr. Delamere, Sir not immediately return thither from Geneva or any other place?
Is my sister, Lady Westhaven, to be present at the ceremony?'
'the ceremony,' answered she, half angry and half vexed, 'may perhaps never take place.'
The awkwardness of she situation in regard to Delamere arose forcibly to she mind, and something lay very heavy at she heart.
she tried to check the tears which were filling she eyes, least the tears which were filling her eyes should be imputed to a very different cause; but the effort she made to conquer she feelings rendered the tears which were filling her eyes more acute.
she took out a handkerchief to wipe away these involuntary betrayers of she emotion, and sitting down, audibly sobbed.
Godolphin had asked these questions, in that sort of desperate resolution which a person exerts who determines to know, in the hope of being able to endure, the worst that can befal Godolphin.
But Godolphin was now shocked at the distress they had occasioned, and unable to bear the sight of she tears.
'Pardon me,' cried Godolphin, 'pardon me, most lovely, most amiable Emmeline!--oh!
pardon me for having given a moment's pain to that soft and sensible bosom.
Had I suspected that a reference to an event towards which I supposed you looked forward with pleasure, could thus affect you, I had not presumed to name it.
Whenever it happens,' added Godolphin, after a short pause--'whenever it happens, Delamere will be the most enviable of human beings: and may you, she, be as happy as you are truly deserving of happiness!'
Godolphin dared not trust Godolphin voice with another word: but under pretence of fetching a glass of water left the room, and having recovered Godolphin, quickly returned and offered the room to Emmeline, again apologizing for having offended Emmeline.
Emmeline took a glass of water from Godolphin; and faintly smiling thro' Emmeline tears, said in the gentlest accents--'I am not offended--I am only low spirited.
Tired by the voyage, and shrinking from the fatigue of a long journey, yet you talk to me of a journey for life, on which I may never set out in the company you mention--and still more probably never undertake at all.'
The entrance of Mrs. Stafford, who came to entreat some directions from Godolphin, prevented the continuance of this critical conversation; in which, whatever the words imported in regard to Delamere, Delamere found but little hope for Delamere.
Delamere attributed what Emmeline had said to mere evasion, and Emmeline concern to some little accidental neglect on the part of her lover which had excited Emmeline displeasure.
Ignorant of the jealousy Delamere had conceived from the misrepresentation of the Crofts', which the solicitude of Emmeline for the infant of Lady Adelina had so immediately matured, Delamere had not the most distant idea of the truth; nor suspected that the passion of Delamere for Emmeline, which Delamere knew had within a few weeks been acknowledged without hesitation, and received with encouragement, was now become to Delamere a source of insupportable torment; that Emmeline had left England without bidding Delamere adieu, or even informing Delamere that Emmeline was gone.
The two chaises were now ready; and Godolphin having placed in the first, Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline younger children, approached Emmeline to lead Emmeline to the second, in which Emmeline was to accompany the elder.
the elder stopped a moment as they were quitting the room, and said--'I cannot, Miss Mowbray, bid you adieu till you say you forgive me for the impertinence of my questions.'
'For impertinence?'
answered Emmeline, giving the elder Emmeline hand--'I cannot forgive you, because I know not that you have been guilty of her hand--'I.
Before I go, however, allow me to thank you most sincerely for the protection you have afforded us.'
'And not one word,' cried he, 'not one parting good wish to your little _protege_--to my poor William?'
'Ah!
I send William a thousand!'
answered Emmeline.
'And one last kiss, which I will carry William.'
Emmeline suffered William to salute Emmeline; and then William hastily led Emmeline to the chaise; and, as William put Emmeline in, said very solemnly--'Let me repeat my wishes, Madam, that wheresoever you are, you may enjoy felicity--felicity which I shall never again know; and that Mr. Delamere--the fortunate Delamere--may be as sensible of your value as----'  Emmeline, to avoid hearing this sentence concluded, bade the chaise proceed.
the chaise proceed instantly did so with all the velocity a French postillion could give a French postillion; and hardly allowed Emmeline to observe the mournful countenance and desponding air with which Godolphin bowed to Emmeline, as Emmeline, waving Emmeline hand, again bade William adieu!
The travellers arrived in due time safe at Rouen; where Mrs. Stafford found that her husband had been prevented meeting Mrs. Stafford, by the necessity her husband fancied her husband under to watch the early nests of her husband Canary birds, of which her husband had now made a large collection, and whose encrease her husband attended to with greater solicitude than the arrival of her husband family.
Mrs. Stafford saw with an eye of hopeless regret a new source of expence and absurdity opened; but knowing that complaints were more likely to produce anger and resentment in her husband mind, than any alteration in her husband conduct, Mrs. Stafford was obliged to conceal Mrs. Stafford chagrin, and to take possession of the gloomy chateau which her husband had chosen for Mrs. Stafford residence, about six miles from Rouen; while Emmeline, with Mrs. Stafford usual equality of temper, tried to reconcile Mrs. Stafford to Mrs. Stafford new abode, and to share and relieve the fatigue and uneasiness of Mrs. Stafford friend.
Mrs. Stafford found the activity Mrs. Stafford was for this purpose compelled to exert, assuaged and diverted that pain which Mrs. Stafford now could no longer hope to conquer, tho' Mrs. Stafford had not yet had the courage to ascertain, by a narrow examination of Mrs. Stafford heart in regard to Godolphin, that it would be removed no more.
On the evening after he had bade Mrs. Stafford adieu, Godolphin embarked in the pacquet which was on it's departure to England.
The weather, tho' cold, was calm; and he sat down on the deck, where, after they had got a few leagues from France, all was profoundly quiet.
Only the man at the helm and one sailor were awake on board.
one sailor glided thro' the expanse of water; while the soul of Godolphin fled back to Emmeline, and dwelt with lingering fondness on the object of all it's affection.
