  Some few days elapsed before there was any great alteration for the better in Lady Adelina.
But the incessant attention of Lady Adelina friends, the soothing pity of Lady Adelina brother, and the skill of Lady Adelina physician, slowly conquered the lurking fever which had so long hung about Lady Adelina; and Lady Adelina intellects, tho' still disordered at times, were more collected, and gave reason to hope that Lady Adelina would soon entirely recover.
In the mean time Captain Godolphin communicated to Mrs. Stafford the resolution Captain Godolphin had taken about Captain Godolphin sister.
Captain Godolphin said that his sister should renounce for ever all claim on the Trelawny estate, except only the stipend settled on his sister as a consideration for the fortune his sister was to receive at the death of the dowager Lady Westhaven, and which was only three hundred a year; a sum which Captain Godolphin thought made his sister but a paltry and inadequate compensation for having passed two years in the society of such a man as Trelawny.
Captain Godolphin added, that Captain Godolphin had a house in the Isle of Wight (almost all the patrimony Captain Godolphin father had been able to give Captain Godolphin,) where, as Captain Godolphin ship was now out of commission, Captain Godolphin proposed residing Captain Godolphin; and whither Captain Godolphin should insist upon Lady Adelina's retiring, without any future attempt to see or correspond with Fitz-Edward.
As to the child, Captain Godolphin asked if Mrs. Stafford would have the goodness to see that it was taken care of at some cottage in Mrs. Stafford neighbourhood, 'till Captain Godolphin could adjust matters with the Trelawny family, and put an end to all those fears which might tempt the Trelawny family to enquire into it's birth; after which Captain Godolphin said Captain Godolphin would take it to Captain Godolphin own house, and call it a son of Captain Godolphin own; a precaution that would throw an obscurity over the truth which would hardly ever be removed, when none were particularly interested to remove it.
These designs he desired Mrs. Stafford to communicate to Lady Adelina; and as Mrs. Stafford was obliged to return home in two days, Mrs. Stafford took the earliest opportunity of doing so.
To the conditions Mrs. Stafford brother offered, Lady Adelina thought Lady Adelina most happy to consent.
The little boy was immediately baptized by the name of William Godolphin, and The little boy unfortunate mother now began to flatter Mrs. Stafford that Mrs. Stafford disastrous history might be concealed even from Mrs. Stafford elder brother, Lord Westhaven; of whose indignation and resentment Mrs. Stafford had ever the most alarming apprehensions.
But while the hope of escaping them by Mrs. Stafford brother William's generous compassion, gave to Mrs. Stafford heavy sorrows some alleviation, them were renewed with extreme poignancy, by the approaching separation from Mrs. Stafford inestimable friends.
Mrs. Stafford could no longer delay Mrs. Stafford return to Mrs. Stafford family; and Emmeline, who now saw Lady Adelina out of danger and in the protection of her brother, was desirous of accompanying Mrs. Stafford back to Woodfield.
Lady Adelina ineffectually tried to bear this early departure with some degree of fortitude and resolution.
Nor was it _Lady Adelina_ heart alone that felt desolate and unhappy at it's approach--That of her brother, had received an impression from the mental and personal perfections of Emmeline, which being at first deep, had soon become indelible; and ignorant of Lady Adelina engagement, he had indulged it till he found it no longer possible for he to forbear making Lady Adelina the first object of he life, and that the value of he existence depended wholly on Lady Adelina.
Emmeline was yet quite unconscious of this: but Mrs. Stafford had seen this almost from the first moment of Mrs. Stafford seeing Godolphin.
In their frequent conversation, Emmeline observed that the very name of Emmeline had the power of fascination; that he was never weary of hearing Emmeline praises; that whenever he thought he unobserved, he eyes were in pursuit of Emmeline; while fondly gazing on Emmeline face, he seemed to drink deep draughts of intoxicating passion.
Mrs. Stafford, who knew what ardent and fatal love, such excellence of person and understanding might produce in a heart susceptible of all their power, was alarmed for the happiness of this amiable man; and with regret saw this amiable man nourishing an affection which she thought must be entirely hopeless.
These apprehensions, every hour's observation encreased.
Yet Mrs. Stafford determined not to communicate These apprehensions to Emmeline; but to put an end to the flattering delusion which led on Godolphin to indulge Godolphin passion, by telling Godolphin, as soon as possible, of the engagement Emmeline had formed with Mr. Delamere.
Accident soon furnished Mrs. Stafford with an opportunity.
While they were all sitting together after dinner, a packet of letters was brought in, and among others which were forwarded to Mrs. Stafford from Woodfield, was one for Emmeline.
Mrs. Stafford gave it to Mrs. Stafford, saying--'From France, by the post mark?'
Emmeline replied that it was.
Emmeline changed colour as Emmeline opened it was.
'From Mr.
Delamere?'
enquired Mrs. Stafford.
'No,' answered Emmeline, 'it is from Lady Westhaven.
Your brother and Emmeline Ladyship are well,' continued Emmeline, addressing Emmeline to Mr. Godolphin, 'and are at Paris; where Your brother and her Ladyship propose staying 'till Lady Montreville and Mr. Delamere join Your brother and her Ladyship as Your brother and her Ladyship come to England.'
'And when are Your brother and her Ladyship expected?'
said Mr. Godolphin.
'In about a month,Emmeline.
'But Lord and Lady Westhaven do not propose to return 'till next spring--Lord and Lady Westhaven only pass a few days all together at Paris.'
'And where is Mr. Delamere wandering to?'
significantly and smilingly asked Mrs. Stafford.
'Lady Westhaven says only,' answered Emmeline, blushing and casting down Emmeline eyes, 'that Mr. Delamere has left Lady Montreville, and is, they believe, gone to Geneva.'
'However,' reassumed Mrs. Stafford, 'we shall undoubtedly see Mrs. Stafford in England in March.'
Emmeline, in still greater embarrassment, answered two or three other questions which Mr. Godolphin asked Mrs. Stafford about Mr. Godolphin brother, and soon after left the room.
Godolphin, who saw there was something relative to Delamere with which he was unacquainted, had a confused idea immediately occur to he of he attachment: and the pain his attachment gave he was so acute, that he wished at once to know whether his attachment was well founded.
'Why does Mr. Delamere certainly return in March?'
said Mr. Delamere, addressing Mr. Delamere to Mrs. Stafford, 'rather than with Mr. Delamere mother?'
'To fulfil Mr. Delamere engagement,' gravely and coldly replied his mother.
'Of what nature is it?'
asked Mr. Delamere.
Mrs. Stafford then related the history of Delamere's long and violent passion for Emmeline; and the reluctant consent he had wrung from Lord and Lady Montreville, together with the promise obtained from Miss Mowbray.
While Mrs. Stafford was making this recital, Mrs. Stafford saw, by the variations of Godolphin's countenance, that Mrs. Stafford had too truly guessed the state of Mrs. Stafford heart.
Expressive as Mrs. Stafford features were, it was not in Mrs. Stafford power to conceal what Mrs. Stafford felt in being convinced that Mrs. Stafford had irrecoverably fixed Mrs. Stafford affections on a woman who was the destined wife of another: and awaking from the soft visions which Hope had offered, to certain despondence, Mrs. Stafford found Mrs. Stafford too cruelly hurt to be able to continue the conversation; and after a few faint efforts, which only betrayed Mrs. Stafford internal anguish, Mrs. Stafford hurried away.
Such, however, was the opinion Mrs. Stafford conceived of Mrs. Stafford honour and Mrs. Stafford understanding, that Mrs. Stafford had no apprehension that Mrs. Stafford would attempt imparting to the heart of Emmeline any portion of that pain with which Mrs. Stafford own was penetrated; and Mrs. Stafford hoped that absence and reflection, together with the conviction of it's being hopeless, would conquer this infant passion before this infant passion could gather strength wholly to ruin Mrs. Stafford repose.
Mrs. Stafford was glad that their departure was so near; and hastened their departure was so near as much as possible.
The short interval was passed in mournful silence on the part of Captain Godolphin--on that of Lady Adelina, in tears and regret; while Emmeline, who was Mrs. Stafford sensible of great pain in the approaching parting, struggled to appear chearful; and Mrs. Stafford attempted, tho' without much success, to reconcile them all to a separation which was become as necessary as it was inevitable.
At length the hired coach in which they were to return to Woodfield was at the door.
Lady Adelina, unable to speak to either of they, brought Mrs. Stafford little boy in Mrs. Stafford arms, and passionately kissing her little boy, gave her little boy into those of Emmeline.
Then taking a hand of each of Mrs. Stafford friends, Mrs. Stafford pressed those of Emmeline to Mrs. Stafford throbbing heart, and hastened to conceal the violence of Mrs. Stafford sorrow in Mrs. Stafford own room.
Mr. Godolphin approached to take leave.
Mr. Godolphin kissed the hand of Mrs. Stafford, and inarticulately expressed Mr. Godolphin thanks for Mrs. Stafford goodness to Mr. Godolphin sister.
'I know,' continued Mr. Godolphin, 'I need not recommend to Mr. Godolphin this poor infant: the same generosity which prompted you to save his mother, will effectually plead for Mr. Godolphin, and secure for Mr. Godolphin your protection 'till I can take Mr. Godolphin to that of Mr. Godolphin own family.
And you, Miss Miss Mowbray,' said Mr. Godolphin, turning to Emmeline and taking Emmeline hand--'most amiable, loveliest of human creatures!
where shall I find words to thank you as I ought?'
Mr. Godolphin emotion was too great for utterance.
Emmeline felt it but too sensibly; and hastening into the coach to hide how much Emmeline was Emmeline affected, Emmeline could only say--  'All happiness attend you, Sir!
Lady Adelina of my hopes of soon hearing from Emmeline.'
Mrs. Stafford being then seated, and the servant who had been hired to attend the infant following Emmeline, the coach drove from the door.
Mr. Godolphin pursued the door with Mr. Godolphin eyes to the end of the street; and then, as if deprived of all that made life desirable, Mr. Godolphin gave Mr. Godolphin up to languor and despondence, afraid of examining Mr. Godolphin own heart, least Mr. Godolphin reason should condemn an inclination, which, however hopeless, Mr. Godolphin could not resolve to conquer.
But while Mr. Godolphin found charms in the indulgence of Mr. Godolphin unhappy love, Mr. Godolphin determined never to disturb the peace of it's object.
But rather to suffer in silence, than to give pain to a heart so generous and sensible as Mrs. Stafford's, merely for the melancholy pleasure of knowing that Mrs. Stafford pitied Mr. Godolphin.
As soon as Lady Adelina could bear the journey, they departed together to Lady Adelina house in the Isle of Wight; where Lady Adelina left Mrs. Stafford, and went in search of Mrs. Bancraft, the sister of Trelawny, of whom Lady Adelina enquired where Trelawny himself might be found.
Mrs. Stafford, apprehensive that Trelawny himself meditated a reconciliation between Mrs. Stafford brother and Trelawny himself wife, which it was so much Mrs. Stafford interest to prevent, refused for some time to give Trelawny himself the information Trelawny himself desired.
Having however at length convinced Mrs. Stafford that Trelawny himself had no wish to renew a union which had been productive only of misery to Trelawny himself , Mrs. Stafford told Trelawny himself that Trelawny himself was returned to England, and lived at a house hired in the name of Mrs. Stafford husband, a few miles from London.
There Mr. Godolphin sought Mr. Godolphin; and found the unhappy man sunk into a state of perpetual and unconscious intoxication; in which Bancraft, the husband of the unhappy man sister, encouraged the unhappy man, foreseeing that it must soon end in Mr. Godolphin son's being possessed of an income, to which the meanness of his son own origin, and former condition, made his son look forward with anxious avidity.
It was difficult to make Trelawny, sinking into idiotism, comprehend either who Mr. Godolphin was, or the purport of Mr. Godolphin business.
But Bancraft, more alive to Mr. Godolphin own interest, presently understood, that on condition of Mr. Godolphin entering into bonds of separation, Lady Adelina would relinquish the greater part of Lady Adelina claim on the Trelawny estate; and Mr. Godolphin undertook to have the deeds signed as soon as they could be drawn up.
In a few days therefore Mr. Godolphin saw Trelawny's part of they compleated; and returned to Lady Adelina, satisfied in having released Lady Adelina from an engagement, which, since Mr. Godolphin had seen Trelawny, had rendered Lady Adelina in Mr. Godolphin eyes an object of tenderer pity; and in having acquitted Mr. Godolphin according to Mr. Godolphin strict sense of honour, by causing Lady Adelina to relinquish all the advantages Trelawny's fortune offered, except those to which Lady Adelina had an absolute right.
This affair being adjusted, Mr. Godolphin again resigned Mr. Godolphin to the mournful but pleasing contemplations which had occupied Mr. Godolphin ever since Mr. Godolphin had heard of Emmeline's engagement.
While Lady Adelina, whose intellects were now restored, but who was lost in profound melancholy, saw too evidently the state of Lady Adelina brother's heart; and could not but lament that Mr. Godolphin tenderness for Lady Adelina had been the means of involving Mr. Godolphin in a passion, which the great merit of it's object, and Mr. Godolphin own sensibility, convinced Lady Adelina must be incurable.
The letters of Emmeline were the only consolation Lady Adelina was capable of receiving.
The letters of Emmeline gave Lady Adelina favourable accounts of Lady Adelina child, and of the continued affection of Lady Adelina inestimable friends.
Whenever one of The letters of Emmeline was brought, Mr. Godolphin eagerly watched Lady Adelina while Lady Adelina was reading it; and then, faultering and impatient, asked if all were well; and if Mr. Delamere was yet returned?
Lady Adelina sometimes gave Mr. Delamere The letters of Emmeline; after which Mr. Delamere generally fell into long absence, broken only by deep drawn and involuntary sighs--symptoms which Lady Adelina knew too well to doubt of the cause.
In the mean time Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline visited every day Mrs. Stafford and Emmeline innocent charge, who passed for the child of one of Emmeline's friends gone to the West Indies.
Emmeline insensibly grew so fond of Mr. Delamere, that Emmeline was uneasy if any accident prevented Emmeline daily visit; and Emmeline friend sometimes laughingly reproached Emmeline with the robbery little William committed on Emmeline time.
When they were alone, they conversation frequently turned on Lady Adelina and her brother.
The subject, tho' melancholy, was ever a favourite with them both; and perhaps the more so because the led them to mournful reflections--for Mrs. Stafford was unhappy, and Emmeline was not gay; nor were Mrs. Stafford spirits greatly heightened by finding that in spite of Mrs. Stafford Mrs. Stafford thought as much of the brother as the sister, and with a degree of softness and complacency which could not be favourable to Mrs. Stafford happiness.
When Mrs. Stafford first discovered in Mr. Godolphin those admirable qualities of heart and understanding which he so eminently possessed, Mrs. Stafford asked Mrs. Stafford whether Mrs. Stafford might indulge the admiration they excited without prejudice to he whom Mrs. Stafford considered as Mrs. Stafford husband?
And Mrs. Stafford fancied that Mrs. Stafford might safely give he that esteem which he tenderness to he unhappy sister, the softness of he manners, the elegance of he mind, and the generosity of he heart, could hardly fail of extorting from the most indifferent observer.
But insensibly he idea obtruded his idea more frequently on Mrs. Stafford imagination; and Mrs. Stafford determined to attempt to forget he, and no longer to allow any partiality to rob Delamere of that pure and sincere attachment with which he would expect Mrs. Stafford to meet he at the altar.
It was now long since Mrs. Stafford had heard from he; but Mrs. Stafford accounted for it by supposing that he was rambling about, and Mrs. Stafford knew that letters were frequently lost.
It was at this time something more than two years since letters were frequently lost had first met at Mowbray Castle, and in a few weeks Mr. Delamere would complete Mr. Delamere twenty-first year--a period to which Lord Montreville had long looked forward with anxious solicitude.
And now Lord Montreville could not but think with bitterness that Lord Montreville would not be present to animate the joy of his son dependants at this period; but was kept in another country, in the vain hope of extinguishing a passion which could not be indulged without rendering abortive all the pains his son Lordship had taken to restore his son family to the eminent rank it had formerly borne in another country.
To Sir Richard Crofts, Sir Richard Crofts sons had communicated the success of those plans, by which his sons had sown, in the irritable mind of Mr. Delamere, jealousy and mistrust of Emmeline; and Sir Richard Crofts failed not to animate and encourage his sons endeavours, while Sir Richard Crofts used Sir Richard Crofts power over the mind of Lord Montreville to limit the bounty and lessen the affection his Lordship his Lordship was disposed to shew his Lordship as the daughter of Lord Montreville brother.
his Lordship received regularly his Lordship quarterly payment, but his Lordship received no more; and instead of hearing, on those occasions, from Lord Montreville, his Lordship had twice only a methodical letter from Maddox, the London steward.
This might, however, be merely accidental; and Emmeline was far from supposing that his Lordship uncle was estranged from his Lordship; nor could his Lordship guess that the malice of Mrs. Ashwood, and the artifices of Sir Richard Crofts, had occasioned that estrangement.
Lord Montreville rather connived at than participated in their ungenerous proceedings; and as if fearful of trusting Lord Montreville own ideas of integrity with a plan which so evidently militated against their, Lord Montreville was determined to take advantage of their endeavours, without enquiring too minutely into their justice or candour.
Sir Richard had assured Sir Richard that Mr. Delamere was in a great measure weaned from Mr. Delamere attachment; and that Sir Richard Crofts was almost sure, that if their meeting could be prevented for a few months longer, there would be nothing more to fear from this long and unfortunate prepossession.
Crofts himself, who had at length torn Sir Richard Crofts from Sir Richard Crofts bride to pave the way for Sir Richard Crofts being received by his bride family as his bride husband, soon appeared, and confirmed all this.
Sir Richard Crofts told Lord Montreville that Mr. Delamere had conceived suspicions of Emmeline's conduct, (Tho'' Sir Richard Crofts knew not from what cause) that had at first excited the most uneasy jealousy, but which had at length subsided with Sir Richard Crofts love; that Sir Richard Crofts had regained Sir Richard Crofts spirits; and, when Sir Richard Crofts left Sir Richard Crofts mother and sister, seemed resolved to make a vigorous effort to expel from Sir Richard Crofts mind a passion Sir Richard Crofts was ashamed of having so long indulged.
In saying all this, Sir Richard Crofts rather attended to what Sir Richard Crofts his Lordship wished to hear, than to what was really the truth.
Sir Richard Crofts knew that a meeting between Mr. Delamere and Emmeline would probably at once explain all the unworthy artifices which had been used to divide Delamere and Emmeline, and render all the unworthy artifices which had been used to divide them abortive.
Sir Richard Crofts therefore told Lord Montreville, that to prevent all probability of a relapse, it would be advisable to remove Emmeline to some place where Mr. Delamere could not meet Emmeline: and his Lordship, forgetting at once all the obligations his Lordship owed Emmeline, thought only of following this advice.
Embarrassed, however, Sir Richard Crofts with public business, Sir Richard Crofts was unable to give to these domestic politics all the attention which these domestic politics demanded.
Sir Richard Crofts threw Sir Richard Crofts more than ever into the power of Sir Richard Crofts, to whose policy Sir Richard Crofts left whose policy to contrive the means, between the months of November and March, of raising an invincible barrier between Sir Richard Crofts son and Sir Richard Crofts niece.
Tho' Mr. Delamere's being of age encreased the difficulties of this undertaking, Sir Richard Crofts having no scruples about the methods Sir Richard Crofts was to pursue, had no doubt of accomplishing Sir Richard Crofts end: and to stimulate Sir Richard Crofts endeavours, Sir Richard Crofts needed only the particular advantages which would accrue to Sir Richard Crofts from the pardon and reception which Sir Richard Crofts hoped to obtain from Lord Montreville and Sir Richard Crofts family.
Every engine therefore that ambition, avarice, malice and cunning could employ, was now put in motion against the character and the peace of the unprotected and unsuspicious Emmeline.
In conscious innocence and unsullied purity, she dreamed not that she had an enemy on earth; for of Mrs. Ashwood, now Mrs. James Crofts, she only remembered that she had once been obliged to she.
The little, malicious envy which had given she some pain at the time it was shewn, she now no longer recollected; and Tho' she always continued to dislike Sir Richard Crofts, yet Sir Richard Crofts impertinence she had forgiven, and had written in the usual form to congratulate them both on them marriage.
Of Mr. Delamere, she heard nothing; but imputing Mr. Delamere silence to Mr. Delamere frequent change of place, she conceived no anger against Mr. Delamere on that account; and still felt she bound to keep from she mind, as much as possible, the intrusive image of Mr. Godolphin.
