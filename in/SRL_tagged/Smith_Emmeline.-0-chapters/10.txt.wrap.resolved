  Lord Montreville, on hearing from his daughter what had passed between his daughter and Emmeline, was disposed to hope, that since his daughter was so willing to assist in terminating for ever the views of Delamere,   Lord Montreville, on hearing from his daughter what had passed between her and Emmeline should be able to prevail on his to relinquish   Lord Montreville, on hearing from his daughter what had passed between her and Emmeline.  While Delamere was with Emmeline, Delamere Lordship had his Lordship waited on Mrs. Stafford, to whom his Lordship thought his Lordship obliged.  his Lordship thanked his daughter for the letter with which his daughter had favoured his Lordship; and said, 'that having heard of the great regard with which his daughter honoured Miss Mowbray, his Lordship waited on his daughter to beg his daughter advice in the present difficult circumstance. Since Delamere has pursued his daughter hither,' said his Lordshiphis Lordship, 'his daughter cannot remain here; but to find a situation that will be proper for his daughter, and concealed from his Lordship, I own appears so difficult, that I know not on what to determine.'  'My Lord,' answered Mrs. Stafford, 'I intended to have asked his Lordshiphis Lordship's permission to have been favoured with Miss Mowbray's company for some months; and still hope to be indulged with your Lordship's permission to have been favoured with Miss Mowbray's company for some months when I return home. But could I go thither now, which I cannot, (my house not being in a condition to receive me,) my house would be impossible to prevent Delamere's knowledge of Delamere abode, if Delamere was with My Lord. But surely Delamere will leave this place with you, and will not oblige Miss Mowbray to quit Miss Mowbray home to avoid Delamere.'  'Ah, Miss Mowbray!' answered Lord Montreville, 'you do not yet know my son. The impetuosity of my son temper, which has never been restrained, it is now out of my power to check; whatever my son determines on my son will execute, and I have too much reason to fear that opposition only serves to strengthen my son resolution. While Emmeline is here, it will be impossible to prevail on my son to quit this place: and though Emmeline behaviour has hitherto been irreproachable and meritorious, how can I flatter My Lord that so young a woman will continue steadily to refuse a marriage, which would not only relieve so young a woman at once from the difficulties and dependance of so young a woman situation, but raise so young a woman to an elevated rank, and a splendid fortune.'  'To which,' said Delamere, 'Delamere would do honour. I do not, however, presume to offer my opinion to Lordship. You have, undoubtedly, very strong reasons for your opposition to Mr. Delamere's wishes: and Mr. Delamere affluent fortune and future rank certainly give Mr. Delamere a right to expect both the one and the other in whoever Mr. Delamere shall marry. But a more lovely person, a better heart, a more pure and elegant mind, Mr. Delamere will no where meet with. Miss Mowbray will reflect as much credit as Miss Mowbray can borrow, on any family to which Miss Mowbray may be allied.'  'I acknowledge, madam, that Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray is a very amiable young woman; but Miss Mowbray is a very amiable young woman never can be the wife of my son; and you I am sure are too considerate to give any encouragement to so impossible an idea.'  After some farther conversation, Delamere promised to endeavour to recollect a proper situation for Miss Mowbray, where Delamere might be secured from the importunities of Delamere; and Lordship took Lordship leave.  By six o'clock the next morning, Mr. Delamere was at Mrs. Watkins's door; and nobody being visible but the maid servant, Mr. Delamere entered the parlour, and told Mr. Delamere Mr. Delamere wanted to speak with Miss Mowbray; but would wait until Mr. Delamere arose.  The maid told Mr. Delamere mistress, who immediately descended; and Delamere, who was known to Mr. Delamere as a young Lord who was in love with Miss Emmy, was courteously invited to Mr. Delamere own parlour, and Mr. Delamere offered to go up with any message Mr. Delamere should be pleased to send.  Mr. Delamere begged Mr. Delamere would only say to Miss Mowbray that a gentleman desired to speak to Mr. Delamere on business of consequence.  But the good woman, who thought Mr. Delamere could do more justice to Mr. Delamere employer, told Emmeline, who was dressing Mr. Delamere, that 'the handsome young Lord, as used to walk every night with Mr. Delamere and Madam Stafford, was below, and wanted to speak to Mr. Delamere directly.'  At this information, Emmeline was extremely alarmed. Emmeline considered Emmeline as particularly bound by what had passed the evening before between Emmeline and Augusta Delamere, to avoid Emmeline brother; and such an interview as her brother now demanded must have an appearance to Lord Montreville of which Emmeline could not bear to think. Emmeline desired Mrs. Watkins, therefore, to let the gentleman know that Emmeline was not well, and could not see any body.  'Why, Lord, Miss!' exclaimed the officious landlady, 'what can you mean now by that? What! go for to refuse seeing such an handsome young man, who is a Lord, and the like of that? I am sure it is so foolish, that I shan't carry no such message.'  'Send Betty with no such message then,' answered Emmeline coldly; 'let Betty inform the gentleman I cannot be seen.'  'Well,' said Mrs. Watkins, as Betty descended, 'it is strange nonsense, to my fancy; but some folks never knows what some folks would be at.'  Betty then returned to the parlour, and very reluctantly delivered the answer to Mr. Delamere; who asked if Emmeline was really ill?  'Ill,' said the complaisant hostess, 'I see nothing that ails the complaisant hostess: last night, indeed, the complaisant hostess was in a desperate taking, and we had much ado to hinder the complaisant hostess from going into a fit; but to day I am sure the complaisant hostess looks as if the complaisant hostess was as well as ever.'  Delamere asked for a pen and ink, with which the complaisant hostess immediately furnished him; and as the complaisant hostess officiously offered to get him some breakfast, him accepted it to gain time. While it was preparing him sent up to Emmeline the following note:       'I came hither to entreat only one quarter of an hour's   conversation, which you cruelly deny me! You determine then,   Emmeline, to drive me to despair!      'You may certainly still refuse to see me; but you cannot oblige   me to quit this place, or to lose sight of your abode. My father   will, therefore, gain nothing by My father    ill-judged journey hither.      'But if you will allow me the interview I solicit, and after it   still continue to desire my absence, I will give you my promise to   go from hence to-morrow.                                                          F. DELAMERE.'   The maid was sent up with this billet to Emmeline; who, after a moment's consideration, determined to send The maid to Miss Delamere, and to tell The maid, in an envelope, how The maid was situated.  Having enclosed The maid therefore, and desired The maid to go with The maid without saying whither The maid was going, The maid bid The maid, as The maid went through the house, deliver to Mr. Delamere another note, which was as follows:     'Sir,      'Your request of an interview, I think The maid obliged on every   account to refuse. I am extremely sorry you determine to persevere   in offering me proposals, to which, though they do me a very high   and undeserved honour, I never ought to listen; and excuse me if I   add, that I never will.                                                    EMMELINE MOWBRAY.'   Emmeline had not before so positively expressed Emmeline rejection of Delamere's addresses. The peremptory stile, therefore, of this billet, added to his extreme vexation at being overtaken by his father, and the little hope that seemed to remain for his any way, operated altogether on his rash and passionate disposition, and seemed to affect his with a temporary phrenzy. his stamped about the room, dashed his head against the wainscot, and seizing Mrs. Watkins by the arm, swore, with the most frightful vehemence, that his would see Miss Mowbray though death were in the way.  The woman concluding his was mad, screamed out to The woman husband, who descending from his chamber in astonishment, put his between his wife and the stranger, demanding his business?  'Alack-a-day!' cried Mrs. Watkins, 'tis the young Lord. the young Lord is gone mad, to be sure, for the love of Miss up stairs!'  Emmeline, who in so small a house could not avoid hearing all that passed, now thought it better to go down; for The woman knew enough of Delamere to fear that the effects of the young Lord fit of passion might be very serious; and was certain that nothing could be more improper than so much confusion.  The woman therefore descended the stairs, with trembling feet, and entered Mrs. Watkins's parlour; where The woman saw Delamere, Delamere eyes flashing fire and Delamere hands clenched, storming round the room, while Mrs. Watkins followed Mrs. Watkins, and bowing in Mrs. Watkins awkward way, 'begged Mrs. Watkins Honour would only please to be pacified.'  There was something so terrifying in the wild looks of the young man, that Emmeline having only half opened the door, retreated again from the door, and was hastening away. But Delamere had seen The woman; and darting out after The woman, caught The woman before The woman could escape out of the passage, and The woman was compelled to return into the roomMrs. Watkins; where, on condition of Mrs. Watkins being more composed, The woman agreed to sit down and listen to Mrs. Watkins.  Mrs. Watkins and Mrs. Watkins wife having left the room, Mr. Delamere again renewed Mr. Delamere solicitations for a Scottish expedition. 'However averse,' said Mr. Delamere, 'my father and mother may at present be to our marriage, I know my father and mother will be immediately reconciled when it is irrevocable. But if you continue to harden your heart against me, of what advantage will it be to my father and mother? my father and mother ambition will still suffer; for I here swear by all that is sacred, that then I never will marry at all; and by my dying without posterity, my father and mother views will for ever be abortive, and my father and mother projects disappointed.'  To this, and every other argument Mr. Delamere used, Emmeline answered, 'that having determined never to accept of Emmeline hand, situated as Emmeline at present was, nothing should induce Emmeline to break through a determination which alone could secure Emmeline the approbation of Emmeline own heart.'  Emmeline then asked Emmeline, 'whether, if the consent of Lord and Lady Montreville could be obtained, Emmeline would continue averse to Emmeline?'  This question Emmeline evaded, by saying, 'that it was to no purpose to consider how Emmeline should act in an event so unlikely to happen.'  Emmeline then again exerted all the eloquence which love rather than reason lent Emmeline. But Emmeline combated Emmeline arguments with those of rectitude and honour, by which Emmeline was resolutely bent to abide.  This steadiness, originating from principles Emmeline could not controvert or deny, seemed, while This steadiness shewed Emmeline all This steadiness hopelessness, to give new force to Emmeline passion. Emmeline became again almost frantic, and was anew acting the part of a madman, when Mrs. Stafford and Miss Delamere entered the house, and enquiring for Miss Mowbray, were shewn into the room where Emmeline was with Delamere; who, almost exhausted by the violence of those emotions Emmeline had so boundlessly indulged, had now thrown Emmeline into a chair, with Emmeline head leaning against the wainscot; Emmeline hair was dishevelled, Emmeline eyes swoln, and Emmeline countenance expressed so much passionate sorrow, that Augusta Delamere, extremely shocked, feared to speak to Emmeline; while Emmeline, on the opposite side of the room, sat with Emmeline handkerchief to Emmeline eyes; and as soon as Emmeline saw Delamere, Emmeline threw Emmeline into Emmeline arms and sobbed aloud.  Mr. Delamere looked at Mrs. Stafford and Mr. Delamere sister, but spoke to neither; till Augusta approaching Mr. Delamere, would have taken Mr. Delamere hand; but Mr. Delamere turned from Emmeline.  'Oh, Frederic!' cried Emmeline, 'I beseech you to consider the consequence of all this.'  'I consider nothing!' said Mr. Delamere, starting up and going to the window.  his sister followed Mr. Delamere.  'Go, go,' said Mr. Delamere, turning angrily from her--'Go, leave me, leave me! assist Lord Montreville to destroy Lord Montreville only son! go, and be a party in the cruel policy that will make you and Fanny heiresses!'  The poor girl, who really loved his sister better than any thing on earth, was quite overwhelmed by this speech; and his sister tears now flowed as fast as those of Emmeline, who continued to weep on the bosom of Mrs. Stafford.  Mr. Delamere looked at them both with a stern and angry countenance; then suddenly catching his sister by the hand, which Mr. Delamere eagerly grasped, Mr. Delamere said, in a low but resolute voice--'Tears, Augusta, are of no use. Do not lament me, but try to help me. I am now going out for the whole day; for I will not see his father only to repeat to his father what I have already said. Before I return, see what you can do towards persuading his father to consent to my marriage with Miss Mowbray; for be assured that if his father does not, the next meeting, in which I expect his father answer, will be the last we shall have.'  his father then snatched up his father hat, and disengaging his father from his father sister, who attempted to detain his father, his father went hastily out of the house; leaving Mrs. Stafford, Miss Mowbray, and his father sister, under great uneasiness and alarm.  Mrs. Stafford, Miss Mowbray, and his sister thought it necessary immediately to inform Lord Montreville of the whole conversation, and Miss Delamere dispatched a note to Fitz-Edward, desiring Miss Delamere to attend to the motions of Miss Delamere friend.  Fitz-Edward was at breakfast with Lord Montreville; who took the first opportunity of their being alone, to reproach Fitz-Edward with some severity for what Fitz-Edward had done.  The Colonel heard Fitz-Edward with great serenity; and then began to justify The Colonel, by assuring The Colonel Lordship that The Colonel had accompanied Mr. Delamere only in hopes of being able to detach The Colonel from The Colonel pursuit, and because The Colonel thought it preferable to The Colonel being left wholly to The Colonel. The Colonel declared that The Colonel meant to have given Lord Montreville information, if there had appeared the least probability of Mr. Delamere's marriage; but that being perfectly convinced, from the character of Emmeline, that there was nothing to apprehend, The Colonel had every day hoped The Colonel would have quitted a project in which there seemed not the least likelihood of success, and would have returned to The Colonel family cured of The Colonel passion.  Though this was not all strictly true, Fitz-Edward possessed a sort of plausible and insinuating eloquence, which hardly ever failed of removing every impression, however strong, against Fitz-Edward; and Lord Montreville was conversing with Fitz-Edward with Fitz-Edward usual confidence and friendship, when the note from Miss Delamere was brought in.  Fitz-Edward Lordship, ever anxious for Fitz-Edward son, gazed eagerly at it while Fitz-Edward read it; and trembling, asked from whom it came?  Fitz-Edward put it into Fitz-Edward hand; and having ran it over in breathless terror, his Lordship hurried out, directing all Fitz-Edward servants to go several ways in search of Mr. Delamere; while his Lordship entreated Fitz-Edward to run to whatever place his Lordship was likely to be in; and went his Lordship to Mrs. Stafford's lodging, who was by this time returned home.  What his Lordship heard from her of the scene of the morning, contributed to encrease his Lordship alarm. The image of his son in all the wildness of ungovernable passion, shook his Lordship nerves so much, that his Lordship seemed ready to faint, yet unable to move to enquire where his Lordship was. As his Lordship could attend to nothing else, Mrs. Stafford told his Lordship how anxiously Mrs. Stafford had thought of a situation for Emmeline, and that Mrs. Stafford believed Mrs. Stafford had at length found one that would do, 'if,' said Mrs. Stafford, 'his Lordship cannot prevail on his Lordship to quit Swansea, which I think you had better attempt, though from the scene of this morning I own I despair of it more than ever.  'The person with whom I hope to be able to place Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray is Mrs. Ashwood, the sister of Mr. Stafford. Mrs. Stafford has been two years a widow, with three children, and resides at a village near London. Mrs. Stafford has a very good fortune; and would be happy to have with Mrs. Stafford such a companion as Miss Mowbray, 'till I am so fortunate as to be enabled to take Mrs. Stafford Mrs. Stafford. As Mrs. Stafford connections and acquaintance lie in a different set of people, and in a remote part of the country from those of Miss Delamere, it is improbable, that with the precaution we shall take, Miss Delamere will ever discover Mrs. Stafford residence.'  Lord Montreville expressed Lord Montreville sense of Mrs. Stafford's kindness in the warmest terms. Lord Montreville assured Mrs. Stafford that Lord Montreville should never forget the friendly part Mrs. Stafford had taken, and that if ever it was in Lord Montreville power to shew Lord Montreville gratitude by being so happy as to have the ability to serve Mrs. Stafford or Mrs. Stafford family, Lord Montreville should consider it as the most fortunate event of Lord Montreville life.  Mrs. Stafford heard this as matter of course; and would have felt great compassion for Lord Montreville, whose state of mind was truly deplorable, but Mrs. Stafford reflected that Lord Montreville had really been the author of Lord Montreville own misery: first, by bringing up Lord Montreville son in a manner that had given such boundless scope to Lord Montreville passions; and now, by refusing to gratify his son in marrying a young woman, who was, in the eye of unprejudiced reason, so perfectly unexceptionable. Mrs. Stafford advised his son to try once more to prevail on his son to leave Swansea with his son; and his son left Mrs. Stafford to enquire whether Fitz-Edward had yet found Delamere, whose absence gave his son the most cruel uneasiness.  Fitz-Edward, after a long search, had overtaken Mr. Delamere on an unfrequented common, about a mile from the town, where Fitz-Edward was walking with a quick pace; and seeing Fitz-Edward, endeavoured to escape Fitz-Edward. But when Fitz-Edward found Fitz-Edward could not avoid Fitz-Edward, Fitz-Edward turned fiercely towards him--'Why do you follow me, Sir? Is it not enough that you have broken through the ties of honour and friendship in betraying me to his father? must you still persecute me with your insidious friendship?'  Fitz-Edward heard Fitz-Edward with great coolness; and without much difficulty convinced Fitz-Edward that Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray had given the information to Lord Montreville by means of Mrs. Stafford.  This conviction, while This conviction added to the pain and mortification of Delamere, greatly reconciled Fitz-Edward to Fitz-Edward, whom Fitz-Edward had before suspected; and after a long conversation, which Fitz-Edward so managed as to regain some degree of power over the passions of Fitz-Edward impetuous friend, Fitz-Edward persuaded Fitz-Edward to go and dine with Lord Montreville; having first undertaken for his Lordship that nothing should be said on the subject which occupied the thoughts of his father; on which condition only the son consented to meet only the son.
