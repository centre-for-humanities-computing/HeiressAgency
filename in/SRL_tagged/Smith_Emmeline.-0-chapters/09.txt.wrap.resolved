  Emmeline had, for some days, complained of a slight indisposition; and being somewhat better, had determined to walk out in the evening; but having rather favoured and indulged   Emmeline illness, as it gave   Emmeline a pretext for avoiding Delamere, whose long and vehement assiduities began to give great uneasiness to both the ladies,   Emmeline still answered to both the ladies enquiries that   Emmeline was too ill to leave   Emmeline room, and in consequence of this message,   Emmeline and Mrs. Stafford, who came to sit with   Emmeline, soon afterwards saw the Colonel and Delamere ride by as if for the Colonel and Delamere evening airing. the Colonel and Delamere kissed the Colonel and Delamere hands as the Colonel and Delamere passed; and as soon as both the ladies believed the Colonel and Delamere quite out of sight, and had observed the way the Colonel and Delamere had gone, Emmeline, who had confined   Emmeline three days to   Emmeline room, and who languished for air, proposed a short walk the opposite way, to which Mrs. Stafford consented; and as soon as the heat was a little abated, the Colonel and Delamere set out, and enjoyed a comfortable and quiet walk for near an hour; from which the Colonel and Delamere were returning, when the Colonel and Delamere saw Delamere and Fitz-Edward riding towards the Colonel and Delamere.  the Colonel and Delamere dismounted, and giving the Colonel and Delamere horses to the Colonel and Delamere servants, joined their horses; Delamere reproaching Emmeline for the artifice   Emmeline had used, yet congratulating Fitz-Edward on seeing   Emmeline again. But Fitz-Edward eyes eagerly running over   Emmeline person, betrayed Fitz-Edward extreme anxiety and concern at observing   Emmeline pale and languid looks, and the lassitude of   Emmeline whole frame.  Fitz-Edward, in a whisper, made the same remarks on Fitz-Edward appearance to Mrs. Stafford; who answered, 'that if Mr. Delamere persisted in pursuing   Emmeline, Mr. Delamere did not doubt but that it would end in Mr. Delamere going into a decline.'  'Say rather,' answered Fitz-Edward artfully, 'that the interesting languor on the charming countenance of your friend, arises from the sensibility of Mr. Delamere heart. Mr. Delamere cannot surely see Mr. Delamere, dying for Mr. Delamere as Mr. Delamere is, without feeling some disposition to answer a passion so ardent and sincere: I know it is impossible Mr. Delamere should. It is only your Stoic prudence, your cold and unfeeling bosom, which can arm It against all the enthusiasm of love, all the tenderness of friendship. Miss Mowbray's heart is made of softer materials; and were Miss Mowbray's heart not for the inhuman reserve you have taught Mr. Delamere, Mr. Delamere Mr. Delamere had long since met a more suitable return to an attachment, of which, almost any other woman would glory in being the object.'  There was something in this speech particularly displeasing to Mrs. Stafford; who answered, 'that he could not pay Mr. Delamere a compliment more gratifying, than when he told Mr. Delamere Mr. Delamere had been the means of saving Miss Mowbray from indiscretion; though Mr. Delamere was well convinced, that Mr. Delamere own excellent understanding, and purity of heart, made any monitor unnecessary.'  'However,' continued Mr. Delamere, 'if you think that _my_ influence has prevented Mr. Delamere entering into all the wild projects of Mr. Delamere, continue to believe, that while I am with Mr. Delamere the same influence will invariably be exerted to the same purpose.'  Delamere and Emmeline, who were a few paces before them while this dialogue was passing, were now met by Parkinson, the colonel's servant, who addressing himself to Delamere, told himself that Lord Montreville and one of the young ladies were that moment alighted from Lord Montreville and one of the young ladies carriage at the inn, and had sent to himself lodgings to enquire for himself.  Mrs. Stafford advancing, heard the intelligence, and looked anxiously at Emmeline, who turned paler than death at the thoughts of Lord Montreville.  Mr. Delamere was alternately red and pale. Mr. Delamere hesitated, and tried to flatter Mr. Delamere that Parkinson was mistaken; while Fitz-Edward, who found Mr. Delamere should be awkwardly situated between the father and son, silently meditated Mr. Delamere defence.  Mrs. Stafford, who saw Emmeline ready to sink with the apprehension of being seen walking with Mr. Delamere, intreated the gentlemen to leave them and go to Lord Montreville; which she at length prevailed on them to do; Delamere pressing Emmeline's hand to Emmeline lips, and protesting, with a vehemence of manner particularly Emmeline own, that no power on earth should oblige Emmeline to relinquish she.  Mrs. Stafford got the trembling Emmeline home as well as Mrs. Stafford could; where Mrs. Stafford endeavoured to strengthen Mrs. Stafford resolution and restore Mrs. Stafford spirits, by representing to Mrs. Stafford the perfect rectitude with which Mrs. Stafford had acted.  But poor Delamere, who had no such consolatory reflections, felt very uneasy, and would willingly have avoided the immediate explanation which he saw must now take place with he father.  he determined, however, to temporize no longer; but being absolutely fixed in he resolution of marrying Emmeline, to tell his father so, and to meet all the effects of his father anger at once.  In this disposition, his father desired Fitz-Edward to leave Fitz-Edward; and Fitz-Edward entered alone the parlour of the inn where Lord Montreville waited for Fitz-Edward. Lord Montreville countenance expressed a mixture of anger and confusion; while that of Lord Montreville Lordship betrayed yet sterner symptoms of the state of his Lordship mind.  Augusta Delamere, her eyes red with weeping, and her voice faultering through agitation, arose, and met her brother half-way.  'My dear brother!' said her, taking 'My dear brother hand.  'My dear brother kissed her cheek; and bowing to 'My dear brother , sat down.  'I have taken the trouble to come hither, 'My dear brother,' said Lord Montreville, 'in consequence of having received information of the wicked and unworthy pursuit in which you have engaged. I command you, upon your duty, instantly to return with 'My dear brother, and renounce for ever the scandalous project of seducing an innocent young woman, whom _you_ ought rather to respect and whom _I_ will protect.'  'I intend ever to do both, 'My dear brother; and when she is my wife, you will be released from the task of protecting she, and will only have to love she as much as she merit deserves. Be assured, Lord Montreville, I have no such designs against the honour of Miss Mowbray as you impute to 'My dear brother. It is my determined and unalterable intention to marry she. Would to God your Lordship would conquer the unreasonable prejudice which you have conceived against the only union which will secure the happiness of your son, and endeavour to reconcile my mother to a marriage on which I am resolved.'  Having pronounced these words in a resolute tone, he arose from he seat, bowed slightly to he father, and waving he hand to he sister, as if to prevent his sister following he, he walked indignantly out of the room.  Lord Montreville made no effort to stop Lord Montreville. But the recollection of the fatal indulgence with which Lord Montreville had been brought up recurred forcibly to Lord Montreville 's mind; and Lord Montreville felt Lord Montreville anger against Lord Montreville son half subdued by the reproaches Lord Montreville had to make Lord Montreville. The very sight of his son half, was so gratifying, that Lord Montreville almost forgot Lord Montreville errors when Lord Montreville beheld Lord Montreville.  After a moment's pause, Lord Montreville said to Lord Montreville daughter, 'You see, Augusta, the disposition your brother is in. Violent measures will, I fear, only make your brother desperate. We must try what can be done by Miss Mowbray Miss Mowbray, who will undoubtedly consent to elude Miss Mowbray pursuit, and time may perhaps detach Miss Mowbray from his pursuit entirely. For this purpose, I would have _you_ see Emmeline to-morrow early; and having talked to Emmeline to-morrow early, We can consider on what to determine. To night, try to recover your fatigue.'  'Let me go to night, Sir,' said Sir daughter.--'It is not yet more than eight o'clock, and I am sensible of no fatigue that should prevent my seeing the young lady immediately.'  Lord Montreville assenting, Miss Delamere, attended by a servant, walked to the house of Mrs. Watkins.  The door was opened by the good woman herself; and on enquiry for Miss Mowbray, the good woman herself desired the young lady to walk in, and sit down in the good woman herself little room, while the good woman herself went up to let Miss Mowbray know.--'For I can't tell,' said the good woman herself, (folding up a stocking the good woman herself was knitting) 'whether the good woman herself be well enough to see a strange gentlewoman. the good woman herself have been but poorly for this week; and to night, after the good woman herself came from walking, the good woman herself was in such a taking, poor thing, we thought the good woman herself'd a had a fit; and so Madam Stafford, who is just gone, bid the good woman herself the good woman herself should lie down a little and keep quiet.'  This account, added to the disquiet of the fair mediatrix; who fancied the heart of Emmeline could hardly fail of being of Mr. Delamere's party, and that uneasiness at his father's arrival occasioned the agitation of the good woman herself spirits which Mrs. Watkins described.  Mrs. Watkins returned immediately, saying that Miss Emmy would be down in a moment.  Emmeline instantly guessed who it was, by the description of the young Lady and the livery of the servant who attended Emmeline: and now, with a beating heart and uncertain step, Emmeline entered her little room.  Mr. Delamere had been prepared to see a very beautiful person: but the fair figure whom Mr. Delamere now beheld, though less dazlingly handsome than Mr. Delamere expected, was yet more interesting and attractive than Mr. Delamere would have appeared in the highest bloom of luxuriant beauty. Mr. Delamere late illness had robbed Mr. Delamere cheeks of that tender bloom they usually boasted; timidity and apprehension deprived Mr. Delamere of much of the native dignity of Mr. Delamere manner; yet there was something in Mr. Delamere face and deportment that instantly prejudiced Mr. Delamere Mr. Delamere in Mr. Delamere favour, and made Mr. Delamere acknowledge that Mr. Delamere brother's passion had at least personal charms for it's excuse.  A silent curtsey passed between the two ladies--and both being seated, Miss Delamere began.--  'I believe, Miss Mowbray, you know that my father, Lord Montreville, in consequence of a letter received from Mrs. Stafford, who is, Miss Mowbray understands, a friend of your's, arrived here this morning.'  'The letter, madam, was written at my particular request; that Lord Montreville did not notice my particular request sooner, has, believe me, given me great concern.'  'I do sincerely believe my particular request; and every body must applaud your conduct in this affair. his father was, by accident, prevented receiving the letter for some weeks: as soon as the letter reached his father, we set out, and his father has now sent me to you, my dear cousin (for be assured I am delighted with the relationship) to consult with your on what we ought to do.'  Emmeline, consoled yet affected by this considerate speech, found herself relieved by tears.  'Though I am unable, madam,' said herself, recovering herself, 'to advise, be assured I am ready to do whatever you and Lord Montreville shall dictate, to put an end to the projects your brother so perseveringly attempts. Ah! Mr. Delamere; my situation is singularly distressing. It demands all your pity; all your father's protection!'  'You have, you shall have both, Emmeline! as well as our admiration for your noble and heroic conduct; and I beg you will not, by being thus uneasy, injure your health and depress your spirits.'  This and many other consoling speeches, delivered in the persuasive voice of friendly sympathy, almost restored Emmeline to Emmeline usual composure; and after being together near an hour, Mr. Delamere Mr. Delamere took Mr. Delamere leave, charmed with Mr. Delamere new acquaintance, and convinced that Mr. Delamere would continue to act with the most exact obedience to the wishes of Lord Montreville.
