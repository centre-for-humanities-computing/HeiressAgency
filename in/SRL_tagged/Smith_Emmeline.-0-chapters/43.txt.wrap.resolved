  The Chateau de St. Alpin was a gloomy and antique building, but in habitable repair. The only constant resident in   The Chateau de St. Alpin for some years had been the Demoiselle de St. Alpin, now about five and forty; whose whole attention had been given to keeping   The Chateau de St. Alpin in order, and collecting, in the garden, variety of plants, in which   The Chateau de St. Alpin took singular pleasure. Detached from the world, and with no other relations than   The Chateau de St. Alpin brother and   The Chateau de St. Alpin nephews, whom   The Chateau de St. Alpin was seldom likely to see,   The Chateau de St. Alpin found in this innocent and amusing pursuit a resource against the tedium of life.   The Chateau de St. Alpin manners, tho' simple, were mild and engaging; and   The Chateau de St. Alpin heart perfectly good and benevolent. With   The Chateau de St. Alpin, therefore, Emmeline was extremely pleased; and the country in which   The Chateau de St. Alpin residence was situated, was so beautiful, that accustomed to form   The Chateau de St. Alpin ideas of magnificent scenery from the first impressions that   The Chateau de St. Alpin mind had received in Wales, Emmeline acknowledged that Emmeline eye was here perfectly satisfied.  With Emmeline heart it was far otherwise. On Emmeline arrival at St. Alpin, Emmeline found letters from Lady Adelina enclosed in others from Mrs. Stafford. Lady Adelina gave such an account of Lady Adelina own health as convinced Emmeline it was not improved since Emmeline left England. Of Mr. Godolphin Emmeline only said, that Mr. Godolphin was returned from Ireland, but had staid with Emmeline only a few hours, and was then obliged to go on business to London, where Mr. Godolphin continuance was uncertain.  Mrs. Stafford gave of Mrs. Stafford and Mrs. Stafford family a more pleasing account. Mrs. Stafford said Mrs. Stafford had hopes that the readjustment of Mrs. Stafford's affairs would soon allow of herself and her family return to England; and as it might possibly happen on very short notice, and before Emmeline could rejoin herself and her family, Mrs. Stafford had sent, by a family who were travelling to Geneva, and who readily undertook the care of the readjustment of Mr. Stafford's affairs, a large box which contained some of Mrs. Stafford cloaths and the caskets which belonged to Mrs. Stafford, which had been long left at Mrs. Ashwood's after Emmeline's precipitate departure from Mrs. Stafford house with Delamere, and which, on Mrs. Ashwood's marriage and removal, Mrs. Stafford had sent with a cold note (addressed to Miss Mowbray) to the person who negociated Mr. Stafford's business in London.  Their lengthened journey had so much broken in on the time allotted to Their tour, that Lord and Lady Westhaven purposed staying only a month at St. Alpin. The Baron, who had equal pride and pleasure in the company of his nephew, endeavoured by every means in his power to make that time pass agreeably; and felt great satisfaction in shewing to the few neighbours who were within fifteen miles of his _chateau_, that his had, in an English nobleman of such rank and merit, so near a relation.  his had observed very early the growing passion of his son for Miss Mowbray. his was assured that she returned it; for his never supposed it possible that any woman could behold the Chevalier with indifference.  the Chevalier had heard from Lady Westhaven that Emmeline was the daughter of a man of fashion, but was by the circumstances of she birth excluded from any share of the Chevalier fortune, and entirely dependant on the favour of the Marquis of Montreville. The old Baron, charmed The old Baron with The old Baron person and The old Baron manners, rather approved than opposed the wishes of The old Baron ; and however convenient it might have been to have seen his son married to a woman of fortune, his son was disposed to rejoice at his son inclining to marry at all; and convinced that with Emmeline his son must be happy, thought his son might dispense with being rich. The Chevalier, confident of success, and believing that Emmeline had meant by Emmeline timid refusals only encouragement, grew so extremely importunate, that Emmeline was sometimes on the point of declaring to his son Emmeline real situation.  But from this Emmeline was deterred by the apprehension that his son would apply to Lord Delamere for the relinquishment of Emmeline promise; and should his son obtain he would apply to Lord Delamere for the relinquishment of her promise, consider his son as having a claim to the hand his son Lordship resigned.  This was an hope, which whatever his son vanity might have suggested, Emmeline never meant to give his son; yet Emmeline had the mortification to find that all Emmeline rejections, however repeated, were considered by the Chevalier as words of course. It was in vain Emmeline assured his son that besides Emmeline disinclination to change Emmeline situation by marriage at all, Emmeline had other forcible objections; that Emmeline should never think of passing Emmeline life out of England; that not only their country, but their manners, their ideas on a thousand subjects, so materially differed, as to make every other reason of Emmeline refusal unnecessary.  When Emmeline seriously urged thus much, his son usually answered that his son would then reside in England; that his son would accommodate his son manner of living to Emmeline pleasure; and that as to the ideas which had displeased Emmeline, his son would never again offend Emmeline with he would then reside in England repetition.  Emmeline had indeed been extremely hurt and disgusted at that levity of principle on the most serious subjects which the Chevalier avowed without reserve, and for which the Chevalier appeared to value the Chevalier. Tho' brought up a Calvinist, the Chevalier had as the Chevalier owned always conformed to the mode of worship and ceremonies of the Catholics while the Chevalier was among them; and usually added, that had the Chevalier served amid the Turks or the Jews, the Chevalier should have done the same, as a matter of great indifference.  The Baron, whose life had been more active than contemplative, was unaccustomed to consider these matters deeply. And as every thing Bellozane advanced had with the Chevalier great authority, the Chevalier was struck with the Chevalier lively arguments; and whatever might be their solidity, could not help admiring the wit of the Chevalier, whom the Chevalier sometimes encouraged to dispute with Lord Westhaven. The religion of Lord Westhaven was as steady and unaffected as Lord Westhaven morals were excellent; and Lord Westhaven entered willingly into these dialogues with Bellozane, in hopes of convincing Lord Westhaven that infidelity was by no means necessary to the character of a soldier; and that _he_ was unlikely to serve well the country to which _he_ belonged, or for which _he_ fought, who began by insulting _he_ God.  _he_ found however that the young man had imbibed these lessons so early, and fancied them so much the marks of a superior and penetrating mind, that _he_ could make no impression by rational argument. Bellozane usually answered by a sprightly quotation from some French author, and Bellozane Lordship soon declined the conversation, believing that if sickness and sorrow did not supercede so slow a cure, time at least would convince _he_ of _he_ folly.  But such was the effect of this sort of discourse on Emmeline, that had Bellozane been in other respects unexceptionable, and had Emmeline heart been free from any other impression, Emmeline would never have listened to _he_ as a lover.  From _he_ own account of _he_ in other respects, Emmeline had gathered enough to believe that _he_ was profligate and immoral. But as Emmeline could not appear to detect these errors without allowing _he_ to suppose Emmeline interested in _he_ forsaking them, Emmeline generally heard _he_ in silence; and only when pressed to name Emmeline objections stated _he_ loose opinions as one in Emmeline mind very material.  To this _he_ again repeated, that _he_ opinions _he_ would correct; _he_ residence should be settled by herself.--'Had Emmeline any objection to _he_ person?' enquired his person, as his person proudly surveyed it in the long old fashioned glass which ornamented the _sal a manger_.[25]  Emmeline, blushing from the conscious recollection of the resemblance it bore in height and air to that of Mr. Godolphin, answered faulteringly--'That to his person person there could be no objection.'  'To his person fortune?'  'It was undoubtedly more than situated as Emmeline was Emmeline could expect.'  'To his person family?'  'It was a family whose alliance must confer honour.'  'What then?' vehemently continued the Chevalier--'what then, charming Emmeline, occasions this long reserve, this barbarous coldness? Since you can form no decided objection; since you have undoubtedly allowed me to hope; why do you thus cruelly prolong my sufferings? Surely you do not, you cannot mean finally to refuse and desert me, after having permitted me so long to speak to you of my passion?'  'It is with some justice,' gravely and coldly answered Emmeline--'I own it is with some justice that you impute to me the appearance of coquetry; because I have listened with too much patience, (tho' certainly never with approbation,) to your discourse on this subject. But be assured that whatever I have said, tho' perhaps with insufficient firmness, I now repeat, in the hope that you will understand it as my unalterable resolution--The honour you are so obliging as to offer me, I _never_ can accept; and I beg you will forbear to urge me farther on a subject to which I never can give any other answer.'  This dialogue, which happened on the second day of her residence at St. Alpin, and the first moment he could find her alone, did not seem to discourage the Chevalier. he observed her narrowly: the country round St. Alpin, which, as well as the place itself, he thought '_triste et insupportable_,' seemed to delight and attract her. he saw her not only enduring but even fond of he aunt and her plants, which were to he, '_les sujets du monde les plus facheux_.'[26]--His excessive vanity made he persist in believing that her could not admire such a place but thro' some latent partiality to it's master; nor seek the company and esteem of he aunt, but for the sake of her nephew.  These remarks, and a conviction formed on he own self-love and on the experience of he Parisian conquests, made he disregard her refusal and persecute her incessantly with his own self-love. Lord Westhaven saw her uneasiness; but knew not how to relieve her without offending the Baron and the Chevalier, or divulging circumstances of which Lord Westhaven did not think Lord Westhaven at liberty without her permission to speak.  Lady Westhaven, to whom Emmeline was obliged to complain of the importunity of Bellozane, repeatedly but very fruitlessly remonstrated with Lord Westhaven. What her had at first ridiculed, now gave her pain; and anxious as her was to reconcile her brother to her friend, from whom her thought only his warmth of temper and a misunderstanding had divided his, her wished to shorten as much as possible only his warmth of temper and a misunderstanding stay at St. Alpin.  her own situation too made her very anxious to return to England; and her was impatient to see Lord Delamere, to explain to Lord Delamere all the mystery of Emmeline's conduct; a detail which her could not venture by the post, tho' her had written to Lord Delamere from Lyons, intreating Lord Delamere to suspend all opinion in regard to Miss Mowbray's conduct 'till her should see Lord Delamere.  This letter never reached the hands of Lord Delamere, and therefore was not answered to St. Alpin; whither Lord Delamere sister had desired Lord Delamere to direct, and where his sister now grew very uneasy at not hearing from Lord Delamere.  Le Limosin and Lord Delamere Madelon had arrived at St. Alpin some time before Le Limosin and his Madelon noble patrons, with whose goodness Le Limosin and his Madelon were elated to excess. Le Limosin himself, assiduous to do every thing for every body, flew about as if he was but twenty. he particular province was to attend with Lord Westhaven English servant on His particular province Ladyship and Miss Mowbray; and Madelon was directed to wait on the latter as His particular province _fille de chambre_.  Emmeline, with painful solicitude for which His particular province could hardly account, wished to hear from Le Limosin those particulars of His particular province father of which he was so well able to inform His particular province. he had served, too, His particular province mother; whose name His particular province had hardly ever heard repeated, and of whom, before witnesses, His particular province dared not enquire.  Lord Westhaven had not yet explained to Lord Westhaven to what Lord Westhaven principally owed the extraordinary kindness Lord Westhaven had met with. Lord Westhaven knew not that the lady on whom Lord Westhaven had the honour to wait was the daughter of that master to whom Lord Westhaven had been so much obliged.  The first days that Lord and Lady Westhaven and Emmeline had passed with the Baron, had been engaged by company or in parties which Lord and Lady Westhaven and Emmeline made to shew the views of the surrounding country to Lord and Lady Westhaven and Emmeline English guests. the Chevalier the Chevalier never suffered Emmeline to be absent from these excursions, nor when at home allowed Emmeline to be a moment out of company. If Emmeline sought refuge in the chamber of Mrs. St. Alpin, the Chevalier followed Emmeline; if Emmeline went with Emmeline to Emmeline plants, thither also came Bellozane; and having acquired from the Chevalier aunt's books a few physical and botanical terms, affected to desire information, which the old Lady, highly pleased with the Chevalier desire of improvement in Emmeline favourite studies, gave the Chevalier with great simplicity.  Lord Westhaven grew apprehensive that the jaunts of pleasure which the Baron continued to propose would be too fatigueing for the Baron wife. And as they were now to go on a visit to one of St. Alpin's old military friends, who resided at the distance of fifteen miles, and where they were to remain all night, Lord Westhaven prevailed on his wife to stay at home, where Emmeline also desired to be left.  Bellozane, detesting a party which the ladies were not to enliven, made some efforts to be excused also; but Lord Westhaven found Lord Westhaven declining to go would so much chagrin and disappoint her father, that, with whatever reluctance, Lord Westhaven was obliged to set out with Lord Westhaven.  Lady Westhaven, who was a good deal indisposed, went to lie down in his wife own room; Emmeline Emmeline attended his wife, and finding his wife was disposed to sleep, left his wife. St. Alpin was busied in St. Alpin garden; and Emmeline, delighted with an opportunity of being alone, retired to St. Alpin room to write to Mrs. Stafford. St. Alpin had not proceeded far in St. Alpin letter, when a servant informed St. Alpin that the messenger who had been sent to Geneva for St. Alpin box was returned with her box. St. Alpin desired that her box might be brought up. Madelon came to assist St. Alpin in opening Madelon, and then left St. Alpin.  St. Alpin took out the cloaths and linen, and then the two embroidered caskets, which St. Alpin put on the table before St. Alpin, and gazed at with melancholy pleasure, as silent memorials of St. Alpin parents. her parents brought also to St. Alpin mind the recollection of Mrs. Carey, and many of Mrs. Carey infantine pains and pleasures at Mowbray Castle, where Mrs. Carey remembered first to have remarked her parents in a drawer belonging to that good woman; to which, tho' it was generally locked, Mrs. Carey had occasionally sent Mrs. Carey little charge when Mrs. Carey was Mrs. Carey confined to Mrs. Carey chair.  One of her parents Mrs. Carey had began to inspect at Clapham, and perused some of the letters Clapham contained. her parents were from Mrs. Carey grandmother, Mrs. Mowbray, to Mrs. Carey ; and were filled with reproaches so warm and severe, and such pointed censures of her father conduct in regard to Miss Stavordale, Mrs. Carey mother, to whom one letter yet more bitter was addressed, that after reading three of her parents, Emmeline believed that the further inspection of the casket was likely to produce for Emmeline only unavailing regret.  Still however Emmeline would then have continued it, painful as it was, but was interrupted by the sudden entrance of Lord Montreville, who came to enquire after his son. The sight of Mr. Mowbray's picture, which Emmeline had taken out, created in the breast of his son Lordship a momentary tenderness for his son niece. Emmeline had since always worn that picture about Emmeline; but the papers, by which Emmeline had been too much affected after that interview farther to peruse, Emmeline had again secured in the caskets; and being almost immediately afterwards taken by Lord Delamere on Emmeline involuntary journey to Stevenage, from whence Emmeline returned no more to Clapham, Emmeline had not since had them in Emmeline possession.  Emmeline mind in this interval had acquired greater strength; and Emmeline at length wished to know those particulars of Emmeline mother's fate, into which Emmeline had hitherto forborne thro' timidity to enquire. Being now therefore alone, and having these repositories once more in Emmeline hands, Emmeline resolutely inspected these repositories.  The first contained about twenty letters. Some were those Emmeline had before seen, and others followed those she had before seen equally severe. those she had before seen seemed in sullen resentment to have been preserved; and Emmeline could not but reflect with pain on the anger and asperity in which those she had before seen were written; on the remorse and uneasiness with which those she had before seen must have been read.  the casket seemed also to hold letters. On opening it, Emmeline found they were part of the correspondence between Emmeline father and mother during the early part of they acquaintance, when, tho' they sometimes resided in the same house, the vigilant observation of Mr. Mowbray very seldom allowed they to converse.  Among they, were several pieces of poetry, elegant and affecting. After having read which, Emmeline imagined Emmeline had seen all the box contained, a few loosely folded papers only remaining; but on opening one of these, what was Emmeline astonishment to find in a few loosely folded papers two certificates of her mother's marriage; one under the hand of a Catholic priest, by whom Emmeline had been married immediately on whom arrival at Dunkirk; the other signed a few days before the birth of Emmeline by an English clergyman, who had again performed the ceremony in the chapel of the English Ambassador at Paris.  That the memory of her mother should thus be free from reproach; that the conduct of Emmeline father, which had hitherto appeared cruel and unjust, should be vindicated from every aspersion; and that Emmeline should Emmeline be restored to that place in society from which Emmeline seemed to be excluded for ever; was altogether such unexpected, such incredible happiness, as made Emmeline almost doubtful of the evidence of Emmeline senses. Ignorant as Emmeline was of the usual form of such papers, yet the care with which these seemed to be executed left Emmeline little doubt of the care with which these seemed to be executed regularity. One other folded paper yet remained unread. Trembling Emmeline opened One other folded paper. One other folded paper was written in her father's hand and endorsed                                 MEMORANDUM      'The harshness with which my mother and Emmeline family have treated   Miss Stavordale, for a supposed crime, has forced Emmeline to put Emmeline   under my protection. Miss Stavordale is now Emmeline; but of this I   shall not inform her family, conceiving Miss Stavordale accountable no longer   to persons capable of so much rashness and injustice. Least any   thing however should happen before I can make a will in due form, I   hereby acknowledge Emmeline Stavordale (now Mowbray) as Emmeline; and   Emmeline child, whether a son or a daughter, heir to my estate. My   brother being possessed of a very large fortune, both by My   brother late   marriage and the gifts of My   brother mother's family, will hardly dispute   the claim of such child to my paternal estate.      '(This is a duplicate of a paper sent to Francis Williamson, my   steward at Mowbray Castle.) Signed by Miss Stavordale at Paris in presence of   two witnesses, this fifteenth of March 17--.                                                 HENRY CHARLES MOWBRAY.      Witnessed by   ROBERT WALLACE,   BAPTISTE LA FERE, (dit Le Limosin.)'   This, which was of the same date as the last certificate, confirmed every claim which they both gave Emmeline to Emmeline name and fortune. A change of circumstances so sudden; Emmeline apprehensions that the Marquis of Montreville, who Emmeline thought must have long known, should dispute Emmeline legitimacy, and Emmeline wonder at the concealment which Mr. Williamson and Mrs. Carey seemed passively to have suffered; which together with a thousand other sensations crouded at once into Mrs. Carey mind, so greatly affected Mrs. Carey, that feeling Mrs. Carey grow sick, Mrs. Carey was obliged to call Madelon, who being at work in an adjoining room, ran in, and seeing Mrs. Carey lady look extremely pale, and hearing Mrs. Carey speak with difficulty, Mrs. Carey threw open the window, fetched Mrs. Carey some water, and then without waiting to see their effects Mrs. Carey flew away to call Mrs. St. Alpin; who presently appeared, followed by Mrs. Carey maid carrying a large case which was filled with bottles of various distillations from every aromatic and pungent herb Mrs. Carey garden or the adjacent mountains afforded.  Emmeline, hardly knowing what Mrs. Carey did, was compelled to swallow a glass full of one of these cordials; which St. Alpin assured Mrs. Carey was '_excellente pour les vapeurs_.'[27] It almost deprived Mrs. Carey of breath, but recalled Mrs. Carey astonished spirits; and having with great difficulty prevailed on Mrs. Carey kindly-busy hostess to leave Mrs. Carey, Mrs. Carey locked up Mrs. Carey papers, and threw Mrs. Carey on the bed; where, having directed Madelon to draw the curtains and retire, Mrs. Carey tried to compose Mrs. Carey mind, and to consider what steps Mrs. Carey ought to take in consequence of this extraordinary discovery.
