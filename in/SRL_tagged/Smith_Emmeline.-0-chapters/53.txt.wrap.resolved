  Emmeline seemed to be happier since   Emmeline had confessed to Godolphin   Emmeline influence over   Emmeline mind, and since   Emmeline had made   Emmeline in some measure the director of   Emmeline actions.   Emmeline hoped that   Emmeline might conceal   Emmeline partiality 'till   Emmeline had nothing to fear from Delamere; at present   Emmeline was sure Delamere had no suspicion that Godolphin was Delamere rival; and   Emmeline flattered   Emmeline, that on Delamere return to England, the conviction of   Emmeline coldness would by degrees wean Delamere from Delamere attachment, and that Delamere would learn to consider   Emmeline only as Delamere sister.  These pleasing hopes, however, were insufficient to balance the concern   Emmeline felt for Mrs. Stafford; who having long struggled against   Emmeline calamities, now seemed on the point of sinking under their pressure, and of determining to attend, in despondent resignation, the end of   Emmeline unmerited sufferings.  Emmeline attempted to re-animate Emmeline, by repeating all the promises of Lord Westhaven, on whose word Emmeline had the most perfect reliance. Emmeline assured Emmeline, that the moment Emmeline own affairs were settled, Emmeline first care should be the re-establishment of those of Emmeline beloved friend. For some time the oppressed spirits of Mrs. Stafford would only allow Emmeline to answer with Emmeline tears these generous assurances. At length Emmeline said--  'It is to you, Emmeline, I could perhaps learn to be indebted without being humbled; for you have an heart which receives while it confers an obligation. But think what it is for one, born with a right to affluence and educated in it expectation, with feelings keen from nature, and made yet keener by refinement, to be compelled, as I have been, to solicit favours, pecuniary favours, from persons who have no feeling at all--from the shifting, paltry-spirited James Crofts, forbearance from the claim of debts; from the callous-hearted and selfish politician, his father, pity and assistance; from Rochely, who has no ideas but of getting or saving money, to ask the loan of it! and to bear with humility a rude refusal. I have endured the brutal unkindness of hardened avarice, the dirty chicane of law, exercised by the most contemptible of beings; I have been forced to attempt softening the tradesman and the mechanic, and to suffer every degree of humiliation which the insolence of sudden prosperity or the insensible coolness of the determined money dealer, could inflict. Actual poverty, I think, I could have better borne;       'I should have found, in some place of my soul,     A drop of patience!'   But ineffectual attempts to ward it off by such degradation I can no longer submit to. While Mr. Stafford, for whom I have encountered it all, is not only unaffected by the poignant mortifications which torture me; but receives my efforts to serve him, if successful, only as a duty--if unsuccessful, him considers my failure as a fault; and loads me with reproach, with invective, with contempt!--others have, in their husbands, protectors and friends; mine, not only throws on me the burthen of affairs which him has him embroiled, but adds to their weight by cruelty and oppression. Such complicated and incurable misery must overwhelm me, and then--what will become of my children?'  Penetrated with pity and sorrow, Emmeline listened, in tears, to this strong but too faithful picture of the situation of Emmeline unfortunate friend; and with difficulty said, in a voice of the tenderest pity--  'Yet a little patience and surely things will mend. It cannot be very long, before I shall either be in high affluence or reduced to my former dependance; perhaps to actual indigence. Of these events, I hope the former is the most probable: but be it as it may, you and your children will be equally dear to me.--If I am rich, my house, my fortune shall be your's--if I am poor, I will live with you, and we will work together. But for such resources as the pencil or the needle may afford we, we shall, I think, have no occasion. You, my dear friend, will continue to exert you for your children; Lord Westhaven is greatly interested for you; and all will yet be well.'  'I am afraid not,' replied Mrs. Stafford. 'Among the various misfortunes of life, there are some that admit of no cure; some, which even the tender and generous friendship of Emmeline can but palliate. Of that nature, I fear, are many of mine. My past life has been almost all bitterness; God only knows what the remainder of it may be, but       'Shadows, clouds, and darkness, rest upon it.'   'Ah! give not up your mind to these gloomy thoughts,' said Emmeline. 'Setting aside all hopes I have of being able, without the assistance of any one, to clear those prospects, I have a firm dependance on Lord Westhaven, and am sure I shall yet see you happy.'  'Never, I believe, in this world!' dejectedly answered Mrs. Stafford. 'But why should I distress you, my best Emmeline, with a repetition of my hopeless sorrows; why cannot I now refrain, as I have hitherto done, from taxing with my complaints your lively sensibility?' Mrs. Stafford then began to talk of their journey for the next day, for which every thing was now ready. It would have been very agreeable to Emmeline could Mrs. Stafford have gone by Southampton, and have accompanied Mrs. Stafford for a few days to East Cliff; but Mrs. Stafford said, that besides Mrs. Stafford suffering so much at sea, which made the long passage to France very dreadful to Mrs. Stafford, Mrs. Stafford had already, in a letter to Mrs. Stafford husband, fixed to go by Calais; and as her husband might either send or come to meet Mrs. Stafford on that road, her husband might be offended if Mrs. Stafford took the other: besides these reasons, Mrs. Stafford had yet another in the chance the Calais road afforded of meeting Lord and Lady Westhaven. The two last arguments were unanswerable: Emmeline relinquished the project of The two last arguments going together; and The two last arguments passed the rest of the day in the last preparations for The two last arguments separate journeys. In the course of it, Bellozane called twice, but was not admitted. Godolphin was allowed to sup with The two last arguments; and early the next morning came again to see The two last arguments set out. The two last arguments parted on all sides with tears and reluctance--Emmeline, with Madelon in the chaise with Mrs. Stafford, and Le Limosin on horseback, took the road to Southampton, and Mrs. Stafford pursued Mrs. Stafford melancholy journey to Dover.  Emmeline arrived at Southampton late the same evening, where Emmeline slept; and the next morning landed on the Isle of Wight.  It was a clear and mild day, towards the end of October; and Emmeline walked, attended by Emmeline servants, to East Cliff. As Emmeline approached the door of Godolphin's house, Emmeline heart beat quick; a thousand tender recollections arose that related to Master, and some mournful apprehensions for the fate of it's's present lovely and unhappy inhabitant.  The maid who had so long waited on Lady Adelina opened the door of Godolphin's house, and expressed the utmost delight at seeing Emmeline. 'Ah! dearest Madam!' said Emmeline, 'how good it is in Emmeline to come to Lady Adelina! Now, I hope, both Emmeline health and Emmeline spirits will be better. But the joy of knowing you are here, will overcome Emmeline, unless I inform Emmeline of it with caution; for tho' Emmeline rather expected you, I know tho will be extreme.'  Barret then ran to execute this welcome commission, and in a few moments Lady Adelina, supported by Emmeline, walked into the room, holding in Emmeline hand little William, and fell, almost insensible, into the arms of Emmeline friend.  The expression of Emmeline countenance, faded as it was, where a gleam of exquisite pleasure seemed to lighten up the soft features which had long sunk under the blighting hand of sorrow; Emmeline weeds, forming so striking a contrast to the fairness of Emmeline transparent skin; and the lovely child, now about fourteen months old, which hung on Emmeline arm; made Emmeline altogether appear to Emmeline the most interesting, the most affecting figure, Emmeline had ever seen. Neither of the lovely child, now about fourteen months old, which hung on her arm could speak. Lady Adelina murmured something, as Lady Adelina fondly pressed Emmeline to Lady Adelina heart; but it was not till it's oppression was relieved by tears, that Lady Adelina could distinctly thank Lady Adelina for coming. Emmeline, with equal marks of tenderness, embraced the mother and caressed the son, whose infantine beauty would have charmed the mother had the son, whose infantine beauty would have charmed her been the child of a stranger. After a little, they grew more composed; and Emmeline, while Lady Adelina in the most melting accents spoke of Lady Adelina brother William, and enquired tenderly after Lady Adelina elder brother and her brother William wife, had time to contemplate Lady Adelina lovely but palid face; from which the faint glow of transient pleasure, the animated vivacity of momentary rapture, was gone; and a languor so great seemed to hang over Lady Adelina, such pensive and settled melancholy had taken possession of Lady Adelina features, that Emmeline could hardly divest Lady Adelina of the idea of immediate danger; and fancied that Lady Adelina was come thither only to see the beauteous mourner sink into the grave. Lady Adelina trembled to think on the consequence which, in such a state of health, might arise from the conflict Lady Adelina would probably have to undergo in regard to Fitz-Edward. Emmeline herself dared not name Fitz-Edward to Godolphin in their long conference. It was a subject, on which (however slightly touched) Fitz-Edward had always expressed such painful sensibility, that Lady Adelina could not resolve to enter upon it with Fitz-Edward. Yet Lady Adelina foresaw, that on Lord Westhaven's arrival either a general explanation must take place, or that his Lordship would accept, for his Lordship sister, the offer of Fitz-Edward, to which there would be in his Lordship eyes, (while his Lordship yet remained ignorant of their former unfortunate acquaintance,) no possible objection. Lady Adelina supposed that Lord and Lady Clancarryl, equally ignorant of that error (which had been partly owing to their own confidence in Fitz-Edward) would press Lady Adelina to accept his Lordship; and that Godolphin must either consent to forgive, and receive Godolphin as Godolphin brother, or give such reasons for opposing Godolphin alliance with Lady Adelina, as would probably destroy the peace of Godolphin family and the fragile existence of Godolphin sister. Sometimes, Lady Adelina thought that Godolphin inflexible honour would yield, and induce Godolphin to bury the past in oblivion. But then Lady Adelina recollected all the indignation Godolphin had but lately expressed against Fitz-Edward, and doubted, with fearful apprehension, the event.  The first day passed without that mutual and unreserved confidence being absolutely established, which the lovely friends longed to repose in each other. Lady Adelina languished to enquire after, to talk of Fitz-Edward, yet dared not trust Lady Adelina with Lady Adelina name; and Emmeline, tho' well assured that the knowledge of those terms which Lady Adelina was now on with Godolphin would give infinite pleasure to his sister, yet had not courage to reveal that truth which his sister conscious heart secretly enjoyed. Affected with his sister friend's depression, and unwilling to keep his sister up late, his sister complained of fatigue soon in the evening, and retired to his sister own room. his sister there dismissed Madelon, and bade his sister, as soon as Mrs. Barret came from his sister lady's apartment, let his sister know that his sister desired to speak to his sister.  his sister wished to enquire of this faithful servant his sister opinion of her lady's health. And as soon as his sister came to his sister, expressed his sister fears about it in terms equally anxious and tender.  'Ah! his sister,' said Barret, 'all you observe as to her lady is but too just; and what I go thro' about her lady, (especially when the Captain is not here) I am sure no tongue can tell. Sometimes, Ma'am, when I have left her lady of a night, and her lady tells me her lady is going to bed, I hear her lady walk about her own room talking; then her lady goes to bed (for I have looked thro' the key hole) where Godolphin Godolphin sleeps, and looks at Godolphin, and bursts into tears and laments her lady over Godolphin, and again begins to walk about her own room, and speaks as it were to her lady; and at other times, her lady will open the window, and leaning her lady head on her lady two hands, sit and look at the clouds and the stars; and sighs so deeply, and so often, that it makes my heart quite ache to hear her lady. the child of a stranger was very ill once with a tooth fever, while the Captain was gone to France; and then indeed I thought her lady would have been quite, quite gone in her head again; for her lady talked _so_ wildly of what her lady would do if the Captain died, and said such things, as almost frightened me to death. We sent to Winchester for a physician; and before a physician could come, for you know, Ma'am, what a long way 'tis to send, her lady grew so impatient, and had terrified her lady into such agonies, that when the doctor did come, the doctor said her lady was in a great deal the most danger of the two. Thank God, Godolphin soon got well; but it was a long time before her lady was quite her lady again; and since that, Ma'am, her lady will hardly suffer Master out of her lady sight at all; but makes either Master own maid or me sit in her own room to attend upon Master while her lady reads or writes. When her lady walks out, her lady generally orders one of We to take Master with her lady; and only goes out alone after Master is in bed of a night. Then, indeed, her lady stays out long enough; and tho' you see, Ma'am, how sadly her lady looks, her lady never seems to care at all about her lady own health, but does things that really would kill a strong person.'  'What then does her lady do?' enquired Emmeline.  'Why, Ma'am, quite late sometimes of a night, when every body else is asleep, her lady will go away by her lady perhaps to that wood you see there, or down to the sea shore; and her lady orders me to let nobody follow her lady. Quite of cold nights this Autumn, when the wind blew, and the sea made a noise so loud and dismal, her lady has staid there whole hours by her lady; only I ventured to disobey her lady so far as to see that no harm came to her lady. But three or four times, Ma'am, her lady remained so long that I concluded her lady must catch her lady death. At last, I bethought me of getting one of the maids to go and tell her lady was awake; and I have got her lady to come in by that means out of the wind and the cold. Then, Ma'am, her lady seems to take pleasure in nothing but sorrow and melancholy. The books her lady reads are so sad, that sometimes, when her lady own eyes are tired and her lady makes me read her own eyes to her lady, I get quite horrible thoughts in her head. But my lady, instead of trying, as I do, to shake her own eyes off, will go directly to her lady music, and play such mournful tunes, that it really quite overcomes me, as I am at work in another room. At other times her lady goes and writes verses about her lady own unhappiness. How is it possible, Ma'am, that with such ways of passing her lady time, her lady, always so delicate as her lady was in health, should be well: for my part I only wonder her lady is not quite dead.'  'But how do you know, Barret, that her lady employs her lady in writing verses about her lady own unhappiness?'  'Dear, Ma'am, I have found your lady employs herself in writing verses about her own unhappiness about every where. When the Captain is absent, her lady is indifferent where her lady leaves your lady employs herself in writing verses about her own unhappiness. Sometimes four or five sheets lay open on the table in her lady little dressing room, and sometimes upon her lady music.'  Emmeline was too certain that such were the occupations of Emmeline poor friend. During the short time your lady employs herself in writing verses about her own unhappiness had been together, Lady Adelina had shewn Lady Adelina some work; and as Lady Adelina took Lady Adelina out of Lady Adelina drawer, Lady Adelina drew out some papers with Lady Adelina.  'I do but little work,' said Lady Adelina. 'I find even embroidery does not serve to call off my thoughts sufficiently from the Captain. I read a good deal in books of mere amusement, for of serious application I am incapable; and here is another specimen of my method of employing the Captain, which perhaps you will not think a remedy for melancholy thoughts.'  Lady Adelina put a written paper into Emmeline's hand, who was about to open a written paper; but Lady Adelina added, with a pensive smile, 'do not read a written paper now; rather keep a written paper till you are alone.'  Emmeline Emmeline took out to peruse as soon as Emmeline had dismissed Barret. Emmeline heart bled as Emmeline ran over this testimony of the anguish and despondence which preyed on the heart of Lady Adelina. It was an                  ODE TO DESPAIR      Thou spectre of terrific mien,     Lord of the hopeless heart and hollow eye,     In whose fierce train each form is seen     That drives sick Reason to insanity!     I woo thee with unusual prayer,     'Grim visaged, comfortless Despair!'     Approach; in comfortless Despair a willing victim find,     Who seeks thine iron sway--and calls thee kind!      Ah! hide for ever from my sight     The faithless flatterer Hope--whose pencil, gay,     Portrays some vision of delight,     Then bids the fairy tablet fade away;     While in dire contrast, to mine eyes     Thy phantoms, yet more hideous, rise,     And Memory draws, from Pleasure's wither'd flower,     Corrosives for the heart--of fatal power!      I bid the traitor Love, adieu!     Who to this fond, believing bosom came,     A guest insidious and untrue,     With Pity's soothing voice--in Friendship's name;     The wounds _he_ gave, nor Time shall cure,     Nor Reason teach me to endure.     And to that breast mild Patience pleads in vain,     Which feels the curse--of meriting it's pain.      Yet not to me, tremendous power!     Thy worst of spirit-wounding pangs impart,     With which, in dark conviction's hour,     Thou strik'st the guilty unrepentant heart!     But of Illusion long the sport,     That dreary, tranquil gloom I court     Where my past errors I may still deplore     And dream of long-lost happiness no more!      To thee I give this tortured breast,     Where Hope arises but to foster pain;     Ah! lull it's agonies to rest!     Ah! let me never be deceiv'd again!     But callous, in thy deep repose     Behold, in long array, the woes     Of the dread future, calm and undismay'd,     Till I may claim the hope--that shall not fade!   The feelings of a mind which could dictate such an address, appeared to Emmeline so greatly to be lamented, and so unlikely to be relieved, that the tender and painful compassion Emmeline had ever been sensible of for Emmeline unhappy friend, was if possible augmented. Full of ideas almost as mournful as those by which they had been inspired, Emmeline went to bed, but not to tranquil sleep. Emmeline spirits, worn by Emmeline journey, and oppressed by Emmeline concern for Lady Adelina, were yet busy; and instead of the uneasy images which had pursued Emmeline while Emmeline waked, Her spirits, worn by her journey, and oppressed by her concern for Lady Adelina represented to Emmeline others yet more terrifying. Emmeline beheld, in Emmeline dreams, Godolphin wildly seeking vengeance of Fitz-Edward for the death of his sister. Then, instead of Fitz-Edward, Lord Delamere appeared to be the object of Lord Delamere wrath, and mutual fury seemed to animate mutual fury against the lives of each other. To mutual fury, Emmeline uncle, in all the phrenzy of grief and despair, succeeded; overwhelmed Emmeline with reproaches for the loss of his only son, and tore Emmeline violently away from Godolphin, who in vain pursued Emmeline.  These horrid visions returned so often, drest in new forms of terror, that Emmeline, having long resisted the impression These horrid visions made upon Emmeline, could at length bear These horrid visions no longer; but shaking off all disposition to indulge sleep on such terms, Emmeline arose from Emmeline bed, and wrapping Emmeline up in Emmeline night gown, went to the window. The dawn did not yet appear; but Emmeline sat down by the window, of which Emmeline had opened the shutter to watch it's welcome approach.  The morning, for it was between three and four, was mild; the declining stars were obscured by no cloud, and served to shew dimly the objects in the garden beneath Emmeline. Emmeline softly opened the sash; listened to the low, hollow murmur of the sea; and surveyed the lawn and the hill behind it, which, by the faint and uncertain light, Emmeline could just discern. All breathed a certain solemn and melancholy stillness calculated to inspire horror. Emmeline's blood ran cold; yet innocence like Emmeline's really fears nothing if free from the prejudices of superstition. Emmeline endeavoured to conquer the disagreeable sensations Emmeline felt, and to shake off the effects of her dreams; but the silence, and the gloominess of the scene, assisted but little Emmeline efforts, and Emmeline cast an eye of solicitude towards the Eastern horizon, and wished for the return of the sun.  In this disposition of mind, Emmeline was at once amazed and alarmed, by seeing the figure of a man, tall and thin, wrapped in a long horseman's coat, as if on purpose to disguise him, force him out from between the shrubs which bounded one part of the lawn. him looked not towards the windows; but with folded arms, and him hat over him eyes, was poring on the ground, while with slow steps him crossed the lawn and came immediately under the windows of the house.  When Emmeline first perceived him, Emmeline had started back from that where Emmeline sat; but tho' greatly surprized, Emmeline could not forbear watching him: on longer observing him figure, Emmeline fancied it was that of a gentleman; and by him slow walk and manner him did not appear to have any design to attack the house. Emmeline presence of mind never forsook Emmeline unless where Emmeline heart was greatly affected; and Emmeline had now courage enough to determine that Emmeline would still continue for some moments to observe him, and would not alarm the servants till Emmeline saw reason to believe him had ill intentions. Emmeline sat therefore quite still; and saw, that instead of making any attempt to enter the house, him traversed the whole side of the house next the lawn, with a measured and solemn pace, several times; then stopped a moment, again went to the end, and slowly returned; and having continued to do so near an hour, him crossed the grass, and disappeared among the shrubs from whence him had issued.  Had not Emmeline been very sure that Emmeline not only heard him footsteps distinctly as him passed over a gravel walk in him way, but even heard him breathe hard and short, as if agitated or fatigued, Emmeline would almost have persuaded Emmeline that it was a phantom raised by Emmeline disordered spirits. The longer Emmeline reflected on The, the more incomprehensible The seemed, that a man should, at such an hour, make such an excursion, apparently to so little purpose. That it was with a dishonest design there seemed no likelihood, as he made no effort to force he way into the house, which he might easily have done; and had he come on a clandestine visit to any of the servants, he would probably have had some signal by which he confederates would have been informed of he approach. But he seemed rather fearful of disturbing the sleeping inhabitants; he step was slow and light; and on perceiving the first rays of the morning, he 'started like a guilty thing,' and swiftly stepped away to he concealment.  Emmeline continued some time at the window after he disappearance, believing he might return. But it soon grew quite light: the gardener appeared at he work; and Emmeline was then convinced that he would for that time come no more.  So extraordinary a circumstance, however, dwelt on Emmeline mind; nor could Emmeline entirely divest Emmeline of alarm. A strange and confused idea that this visitor might be some one not unknown to Emmeline, crossed her mind. he height answered almost equally to that of Bellozane, Godolphin, and Fitz-Edward. The latter, indeed, was rather the tallest, and to he Emmeline thought the figure bore the greatest resemblance. Yet the figure had taken leave of Emmeline ten days before Emmeline left London, and told Emmeline the figure was going down to Mr. Percival's, in Berkshire; where, as the figure was very anxious to hear of Lady Adelina, the figure had desired Mrs. Stafford to write to the figure; (who had done so, and had received an answer of thanks dated from thence before the departure of Emmeline from London). That Fitz-Edward, therefore, should be the person, seemed improbable; yet it was hardly less so that a night ruffian should be on foot so long, without any attempt to execute mischief, or even the appearance of examining how it might be perpetrated. After long consideration, That Fitz-Edward determined, that lest the first conjecture should be true, That Fitz-Edward would speak to nobody of the stranger That Fitz-Edward had seen; but would watch another night, before That Fitz-Edward either terrified Lady Adelina with the apprehension of robbers, or gave rise to conjectures in That Fitz-Edward and the servants of yet more disquieting tendency. Having taken this resolution, and argued That Fitz-Edward out of all those fears for That Fitz-Edward personal safety which might have enfeebled a less rational mind, That Fitz-Edward met Lady Adelina at breakfast with That Fitz-Edward usual ease, and almost with That Fitz-Edward usual chearfulness: but That Fitz-Edward was pale, and That Fitz-Edward eyes were heavy: Lady Adelina remarked it with concern; but Emmeline, making light of it, imputed it intirely to the fatigue of That Fitz-Edward ; and when their breakfast was finished, proposed a walk. To this Lady Adelina friend assented; and while Lady Adelina went to give some orders, and to fetch the crape veil in which Lady Adelina usually wrapped Lady Adelina, (for even Lady Adelina dress partook something of the mournful cast of Lady Adelina mind), Emmeline, already equipped, went into the lawn, and saw plainly where the stranger she had seen had made his way thro' the thick shrubs, and where the flexible branches of a young larch were twisted away, a laurel broken, and that some deciduous trees behind the flexible branches of a young larch had lost all some deciduous trees behind them lower leaves; which, having sustained the first frosts, fell on the slightest violence. Lady Adelina marked the place with Lady Adelina eye; and determined to observe whether, if his came again, it was from thence.  Emmeline now desired that Madelon might come with Emmeline to wait on little William, rather than William own maid; as Lady Adelina understood English so ill, that Lady Adelina would be no interruption to Emmeline discourse. Emmeline then walked arm in arm together towards the sea; and there Lady Adelina, who now enjoyed the opportunity Lady Adelina had so long languished for, opened to Lady Adelina sympathizing friend the sorrows of an heart struggling vainly with a passion Lady Adelina condemned, and sinking under ineffectual efforts to vindicate Lady Adelina honour and eradicate Lady Adelina love.  Lady Adelina knew not that Fitz-Edward had ever written to Lady Adelina. Godolphin, well acquainted with Fitz-Edward hand, had kept the letter from Lady Adelina. Lady Adelina knew not that Fitz-Edward had applied to Emmeline: and tho' Lady Adelina had torn Lady Adelina from Fitz-Edward, and had vowed never again to write to Fitz-Edward, to name Fitz-Edward, to hear from Fitz-Edward, Lady Adelina involuntarily felt disposed to accuse Fitz-Edward of neglect, of ingratitude, of cruelty, for having never attempted to write to Lady Adelina or see Lady Adelina; and added the poignant anguish of jealousy to the dreary horrors of despair. That Fitz-Edward was for ever lost to Lady Adelina, Lady Adelina seemed to be convinced; yet that Fitz-Edward should forget Lady Adelina, or attach Fitz-Edward to another, seemed a torment so entirely insupportable, that when Lady Adelina mind dwelt upon it, as her mind perpetually did, Lady Adelina reason was inadequate to the pain it inflicted; and when Lady Adelina touched on that subject, Emmeline too evidently saw symptoms of that derangement of intellect to which Emmeline had once before been a melancholy witness.  With a mind thus unsettled, and a heart thus oppressed, the consequences of touching on the application of Fitz-Edward to Fitz-Edward, might, as Emmeline believed, have the most alarming effect on Lady Adelina. And Fitz-Edward dared not therefore name it unless Fitz-Edward had the concurrence of Godolphin. Fitz-Edward only attempted to soothe and tranquillize Fitz-Edward mind, without giving Fitz-Edward those assurances of his undiminished attachment, which, Fitz-Edward thought, might in the event only encrease Fitz-Edward anguish, if Fitz-Edward brother remained inflexible. On the other hand, Fitz-Edward forbore to remonstrate with Fitz-Edward on the necessity there might be to forget his; being too well convinced that the arguments which were to enforce that doctrine, would be useless, and perhaps appear cruel, to a heart so deeply wounded as was that of the luckless, lovely Adelina.  But in pouring Fitz-Edward sorrows into the bosom of Fitz-Edward Fitz-Edward appeared to find consolation. The tender pity of Emmeline was a balm to Emmeline wounded mind; and growing more composed, Emmeline began to discourse on the singular discovery Emmeline had made, and to enter with some interest into the affairs depending between Emmeline and the Marquis of Montreville; and by questions, aided by the natural frankness of Emmeline, at length became acquainted with the happy prospects, which, tho' distant, opened to Godolphin.  This was the only information that seemed to have the power of suspending for a moment the weight of those afflictions which Lady Adelina suffered. 'My brother then,' cried she--'my dear Godolphin, will be happy! And you, my most amiable friend, will constitute, while you share dear Godolphin felicity. Ah! fortunate, thrice fortunate for ye both, was the hour of your meeting; for heaven and nature surely designed ye for each other! Fortunate, too, were those circumstances which divided my Emmeline from Delamere, before indissoluble bonds enchained you for ever. Had it been otherwise; had _your_ guardian angel slumbered as _mine did_; you too, all lovely and deserving as you are, would have been condemned to the bitterest of all lots, and might have discovered all the excellence and worth of Godolphin, when your duty and your honour allowed you no eyes but for Delamere. _Your_ destiny is more happy--yet not happier than you deserve. Oh! may it quickly be fixed unalterably; and long, very long, may it endure! So shall your Adelina, for the little while the little drags on a reluctant existence, have something on which to lean for the alleviation of the little ; and when the little shall interrupt your felicity no longer by the sight of cureless calamity, the little will, in full confidence, entrust the sole tie the little has on earth, the dear and innocent victim of the little fatal weakness, to the compassionate bosoms of Godolphin and Godolphin Emmeline!'  The tremulous voice and singular manner in which Lady Adelina uttered these words, made Emmeline tremble. Emmeline now tried to divert the attention of Emmeline poor friend, from dwelling too earnestly either on Emmeline own wretchedness or the promised felicity of her brother: but, as if exhausted by the mingled emotions of pain and pleasure, Emmeline soon afterwards fell into a deep silence; scarce attending to what was said; and after a long pause, Emmeline suddenly called to Madelon, in whose arms Emmeline little boy had fallen asleep, and looking at her little boy earnestly a moment, took her little boy from the maid, and carried her little boy towards the house. Emmeline, more and more convinced of Emmeline partial intellectual derangement, followed Emmeline, dreading lest Emmeline should see it encrease, without the power of applying any remedy. Before Lady Adelina reached the gate, which opened from the cliffs to the lawn, Emmeline was fatigued by Emmeline lovely burthen and forced to stop. Emmeline would then have taken her little boy; but Emmeline said 'No!' and sitting down on the ground, held her little boy in Emmeline lap, till Barret, who had seen Emmeline from a window, came out and took her little boy from Emmeline; to which, as to a thing usual, Emmeline consented, and then walked calmly home with Emmeline, who, extremely discomposed by the wildness of Emmeline manner, was fearful of again introducing any interesting topic, lest Emmeline should again touch those fine chords which were untuned in the mind of Emmeline unhappy friend; and which seemed occasionally to vibrate with an acuteness that threatened the ruin of the whole fabric. Barret, who afterwards came to assist Emmeline in dressing, told Emmeline, that within the last six weeks Emmeline had often been subject to long fits of absence, sometimes of tears; which generally ended in Emmeline snatching the child eagerly to Emmeline, kissing the child with the wildest fondness, and that after having kept the child with Emmeline some time, and wept extremely, Emmeline usually became rational and composed for the rest of the day.
