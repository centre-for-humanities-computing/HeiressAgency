  While Delamere, in the deepest despondence, which    could neither conquer or conceal, made a vain effort to divert    mind with those amusements for which    no longer had any relish, Emmeline, at her new residence, attracted the attention of many of Mrs. Ashwood's visitors.  A widow, in possession of an handsome jointure, and A widow children amply provided for, Mrs. Ashwood was believed to entertain no aversion to a second marriage: and Mrs. Ashwood house being so near London, was frequented by a great number of single men; many of whom came there because it was a pleasant jaunt from the city, where most of many of whom resided; and others, with hopes of amending many of whom fortunes by an alliance with the lady herself.  These latter, however, were chiefly the younger sons of merchants; and though pleased with the younger sons of merchants flattery and assiduity, Mrs. Ashwood, who had an almost equal share of vanity and ambition, had yet given no very decided preference to any; for she imagined she personal attractions, of which she had a very high idea, added to the advantages of a good income, good expectations, and opulent connections, entitled she to marry into an higher line of life than that in which she father had first engaged she.  she acquaintance, however, was yet very limited among persons of fashion; and it was not wholly without hopes of encreasing it that she had consented to receive Miss Mowbray, whose relationship to Lord Montreville would, she imagined, be the means of introducing she to his Lordship's notice and to that of his family.  she civility and kindness to Emmeline were unbounded for some time. And as she was not easily convinced of she own want of beauty, she never apprehended that she ran some risk of becoming a foil, instead of the first figure, as she expected generally to be.  The extreme simplicity of Emmeline's appearance, who notwithstanding the remonstrances of Mrs. Ashwood continued to dress nearly as Mrs. Ashwood did in Wales; and Mrs. Ashwood perfect ignorance of fashionable life and fashionable accomplishments, gave Mrs. Ashwood, in the eyes of many of Mrs. Ashwood's visitors, the air of a dependant; and those who visited with a view to the fortune of the latter, carefully avoided every appearance of preference to Emmeline, and kept Mrs. Ashwood friend in good humour with Mrs. Ashwood.  But there were, among those who frequented Mrs. Ashwood house, some men of business; who being rather in middle life, and immensely rich, had no other views in going thither than to pass a few hours in the country, when those who frequented her house mercantile engagements prevented those who frequented her house leaving London entirely; and who loved pleasure better than any thing but money.  With one or two of these, Mrs. Ashwood and her father had at different times encouraged overtures of marriage. But Mrs. Ashwood and her father knew and enjoyed the pleasure Mrs. Ashwood and her father fortune and single state afforded Mrs. Ashwood and her father too well to give those indulgences up for the advantage of increasing Mrs. Ashwood and her father incomes, unless the object had possessed greater attractions than fell to the share of Mrs. Ashwood; and Mrs. Ashwood could not be prevailed upon to give Mrs. Ashwood (at least while her father lived) a sum of money large enough to tempt money avarice. These overtures therefore had ended in nothing more than an intercourse of civility.  But Emmeline no sooner appeared, than one of these gentlemen renewed her father visits with more than her father original assiduity.  The extreme beauty of Emmeline person, and the _naivete_ of Emmeline manners, gave Emmeline, to her father, the attractive charms of novelty; while the mystery there seemed to be about Emmeline, piqued her father curiosity.  his curiosity was known that Emmeline was related to a noble family; but Mrs. Ashwood had been so earnestly entreated to conceal as much as possible Mrs. Ashwood real history, lest Delamere should hear of and discover Emmeline, that Emmeline only told it to a few friends, and it had not yet reached the knowledge of Mr. Rochely.  Mr. Rochely was nearer fifty than forty. Mr. Rochely person, heavy and badly proportioned, was not relieved by Mr. Rochely countenance, which was dull and ill-formed. Mr. Rochely voice, monotonous and guttural, was fatiguing to the ear; and the singularity of Mr. Rochely manners, as well as the oddness of Mr. Rochely figure, often excited a degree of ridicule, which the respect Mr. Rochely riches demanded could not always stifle.  With a person so ill calculated to inspire affection, Mr. Rochely was very desirous of being a favourite with the ladies; and extremely sensible of the ladies attractions. In the inferior ranks of life, Mr. Rochely money had procured Mr. Rochely many conquests, tho' Mr. Rochely was by no means lavish of it; and much of the early part of Mr. Rochely time had been passed in low amours; which did not, however, impede Mr. Rochely progress to the great wealth Mr. Rochely possessed. Mr. Rochely had always intended to marry: but as Mr. Rochely required many qualifications in a wife which are hardly ever united, Mr. Rochely had hesitated till Mr. Rochely had long been looked upon as an old bachelor.  Mr. Rochely was determined to chuse beauty, but expected also fortune. Mr. Rochely desired to marry a woman of family, yet feared the expensive turn of those brought up in high life; and had a great veneration for wit and accomplishments, but dreaded, lest in marrying a woman who possessed them, Mr. Rochely should be liable to be governed by superior abilities, or be despised for the mediocrity of Mr. Rochely own understanding.  With such ideas, Mr. Rochely relations saw Mr. Rochely perpetually pursuing some matrimonial project; but so easily frightened from Mr. Rochely pursuit, that they relied on Mr. Rochely succession with the most perfect confidence.  When first Mr. Rochely beheld Emmeline, Mr. Rochely was charmed with Emmeline person; Emmeline conversation, at once innocent and lively, impressed Mr. Rochely with the most favourable ideas of Emmeline heart and understanding; and, brought up at a great distance from London, Emmeline had acquired no taste for expences, no rage for those amusements and dissipations which Mr. Rochely so much apprehended in a wife.  When Mr. Rochely came to Mrs. Ashwood's, (which was almost every afternoon) Emmeline, who was generally at work, or drawing in the dressing-room, never discomposed Emmeline; but sat quietly to what Emmeline was doing; listening with the most patient complaisance to the long and uninteresting stories with which he endeavoured to entertain Emmeline; an attention which greatly contributed to win the heart of Rochely; and he was as much in love as so prudent a man could be, before he ventured to ask he what he intended? or what was the family and what the fortune of the person who now occupied most of he time and a great portion of he thoughts?  Mrs. Ashwood, frequently engaged at the neighbouring card-tables, from which Emmeline almost always excused Emmeline, often left Emmeline and Rochely to drink tea together; and when Emmeline was at home, would sometimes make Emmeline party in another room, where the subject of laughter with Emmeline own admirers, was the growing passion of the rich banker for the fair stranger.  Emmeline did not, when present, escape ridicule on this subject: but as Emmeline had not the least idea that a man so much older than Emmeline had any intention of offering a man so much older than herself as an husband, Emmeline bore it with great tranquillity, and continued to behave to Rochely with the attentive civility dictated by natural good breeding; while Emmeline heard, without any concern but on Rochely account, the perpetual mirth and loud bursts of laughter which followed Rochely compliments and attentions to Emmeline.  If Rochely was absent a few days, the door of Mrs. Ashwood was crouded with servants and porters with game from Rochely. And Rochely assiduities became at every visit more marked.  As it was now late in the autumn, Mrs. Ashwood was desirous of shewing Miss Mowbray some of those public places Mrs. Ashwood had not yet seen; and Emmeline (not apprehending there was any reason to fear meeting Mr. Delamere at a season when Mrs. Ashwood knew field sports kept Mr. Delamere altogether in the country) made no difficulty to accompany Mrs. Ashwood.  Mr. Rochely no sooner heard a party to the play proposed, than Mr. Rochely desired to join the play proposed; and Mrs. Ashwood, Miss Galton, (an intimate friend of her's), with Miss Mowbray, Mr. Hanbury, (one of Mrs. Ashwood's admirers), and Mr. Rochely, met at Drury-Lane Theatre; where Emmeline was extremely well entertained.  When the play proposed was over, the box was filled with several of Mrs. Ashwood's acquaintance, who talked to _her_, while their eyes were fixed on her young friend; an observation that did not greatly lighten up her countenance.  The most conspicuous among these was a tall, thin, but extremely awkward figure, which in a most fashionable undress, and with a glass held to Mr. Rochely eye, strided into the box, and bowing with a strange gesture to Mrs. Ashwood, exclaimed--'Oh! my dear Mrs. A!--here I am!--returned from Spa only last night; and already at your feet. So here you are? and not yet enchained by that villainous fellow Hymen? You are a good soul, not to give yourself away while I was at Spa. I was horridly afraid, my dear widow! you would not have waited even to have given me a wedding favour.'  To this speech, as this speech required no answer, Mrs. Ashwood gave very little; for besides that Mrs. Ashwood was not pleased with the matter, the manner delighted Mrs. Ashwood still less. The speaker had, during the whole of The speaker, leaned almost across the person who was next to The speaker, to bring The speaker glass nearly close to Emmeline's face.  Emmeline, extremely discomposed, drew back; and Mr. Rochely, who sat near Mrs. Ashwood, putting away his glass softly with The speaker hand, said very calmly to the leaning beau--'Sir, is there any occasion to take an account of this lady's features?'  'Ah! my friend Rochely!' answered my friend Rochely!' familiarly, 'what are you this lady's Cicisbeo? as we say in Italy. Here is indeed beauty enough to draw you from the contemplation of three per cent. consols, India bonds, omnium, scrip, and douceurs. But prithee, my old friend, is this lady your ward?'  'your ward! no,' answered Rochely, 'how came you to think this lady was?'  Mr. Elkerton, who fancied he had vastly the advantage in point of wit, as well as of figure, over he antagonist, now desired to know, 'whether this lady was he niece? though if I had not recollected' said he, 'that you never was married, I should have taken this lady for your grand daughter.'  This sarcasm had, on the features of Rochely, all the effect the travelled man expected. But while the travelled man was preparing an answer, at which the travelled man was never very prompt, the coach was announced to be ready, and Emmeline, extremely weary of Emmeline situation, and disgusted even to impatience with Emmeline new acquaintance, hastily arose to go.  Elkerton offered to take Emmeline hand; which Emmeline drew from the travelled man without attempting to conceal Emmeline dislike; and accepting the arm of Rochely, followed Mrs. Ashwood; while Elkerton, determined not to lose sight of Emmeline, seized the hand of Miss Galton, who being neither young, handsome, or rich, had been left to go out alone: the hand of Miss Galton, who being neither young, handsome, or rich followed the rest of a party to the coach, where Mrs. Ashwood and Miss Mowbray were already seated, with Mr. Hanbury; who, as Mr. Hanbury resided with Mr. Hanbury mother in the village where Mrs. Ashwood lived, was to accompany the hand of Miss Galton, who being neither young, handsome, or rich home.  the coach, seemed to preclude all possibility of Elkerton's admittance. But the travelled man was not so easily put off: and telling Mrs. Ashwood the travelled man intended to go home to sup with Mrs. Ashwood, the travelled man stepped immediately in, and ordered the travelled man servant, who waited at the door of Mrs. Ashwood with a flambeau, to direct the travelled man vis-a-vis to follow.  Rochely, who meant to have wished his servant, who waited at the coach door with a flambeau a good night after seeing his servant, who waited at the coach door with a flambeau to his servant, who waited at the coach door with a flambeau carriage, was too much hurt by this happy essay of assurance not to resolve to counteract it's consequences. Elkerton, though not a very young man, was near twenty years younger than Rochely; besides the income of his business (for his was in trade) his had a large independent fortune, of which his was extremely lavish; his equipages were splendid; his house most magnificently furnished; and his cloaths the most expensive that could be bought.  Rochely, whose ideas of elegance, manners, or taste, were not very refined, had no notion that the absurdity of Elkerton, or his disagreeable person, would prevent his being a very formidable rival. his therefore saw his with great pain accompany Emmeline home; and though his had formed no positive designs his, his could not bear to suppose that another might form them with success.  Directing therefore his chariot to follow the coach, his was set down at the door of Mrs. Ashwood a few minutes after Mrs. Ashwood and her party; where Emmeline, still more displeased with Elkerton, and having been teized by his impertinent admiration the whole way, looked as if her could have burst into tears.  Mrs. Ashwood, in a very ill humour, hardly attended to Mrs. Ashwood flourishing speeches with common civility; Mrs. Ashwood had therefore recourse to Miss Galton, to whom Mrs. Ashwood was giving the history of Mrs. Ashwood travels, which seemed to take up much of Mrs. Ashwood thoughts.  Miss Galton, who by long dependance and repeated disappointments had acquired the qualifications necessary for a patient hearer, acquiesced in smiling silence to all Mrs. Ashwood assertions; looked amazed in the right place; and heard, with great complacency, Mrs. Ashwood wonderful success at cards, and the favour Mrs. Ashwood was in with women of the first fashion at Spa.  The entrance of Rochely gave no interruption to Rochely discourse. Rochely bowed slightly to Rochely without rising, and then went on, observing that Rochely had now seen every part of Europe worth seeing, and meant, at least for some years, to remain in England; the ladies of which country Rochely preferred to every other, and therefore intended taking a wife among every other. Fortune was, Fortune declared, to Fortune no object; but Fortune was determined to marry the handsomest woman Fortune could meet with, for whom Fortune was now looking out.  As Fortune said this, Fortune turned Fortune eyes towards Emmeline; who affecting not to hear Fortune, tho' Fortune spoke in so loud a tone as to make it unavoidable, was talking in a low voice to Rochely.  Rochely placing Fortune close to her, had thrown Fortune arm over the back of her chair; and leaning forward, attended to her with an expression in Fortune countenance of something between apprehension and hope, that gave it the most grotesque look imaginable.  Mrs. Ashwood, who had been entertained apart by Mr. Hanbury, now hurried over the supper; during which Elkerton, still full of Fortune, engrossed almost all the conversation; gave a detail of the purchases Fortune had made abroad, and the trouble Fortune had to land them; interspersed with _bon mots_ of French Marquises and German Barons, and witty remarks of an English Duke with whom Fortune had crossed the water on Fortune return. But whatever story Fortune told, Fortune was still forwardest in the picture; Fortune project of marrying an handsome wife was again repeated; and Fortune told a party how charming a house Fortune had bought in Kent, and how Fortune had furnished Fortune library.  Rochely, who lay in wait to revenge Fortune for all the mortifications Fortune had suffered from Fortune during the evening, took occasion to say, in Fortune grave, cold manner, 'to be sure a man of your taste and erudition, Elkerton, cannot do without a library; but for my part, I think you will find no books can say so much to the purpose as those kept by your late father in Milk-street, Cheapside.'  Elkerton turned pale at this sneer; but forcing a smile of contempt, answered, 'You bankers have no ideas out of your compting-houses; and rich as ye are, will never be any thing but _des bourgeois les plus grossieres_! For my part I see no reason why--why a man's being in business, should prevent a man enjoying the _elegancies_ and _agrements_ of life, especially if a man can _afford_ it; as it is well known, I believe, even to _you_, Sir, _that I can_.'  'Oh! Sir,' replied Rochely, 'I know your late father was _reputed_ to have died rich, and that no body has made a better _figure about town_ than _you_ have, ever since.'  'As to figure, Sir,' returned the other, 'it is true I like to have every thing about me _comme il faut_. And though I don't make fifty per cent. of money, as _some_ gentlemen do in _your_ way of business, I assure you, Sir, I do nothing that I cannot very well afford.'  Mrs. Ashwood, who thought it very likely a quarrel might ensue, here endeavoured to put an end to such very unpleasant discourse; and prevented Mr. Hanbury, who equally hated them both, from trying to irritate them farther, to which he maliciously inclined.  The hints, however, of fatigue, given by her and Miss Mowbray, obliged Rochely to ring that Rochely chariot might be called, which had waited at the door of Mrs. Ashwood; while Elkerton, who had a pair of beautiful pied horses in his vis-a-vis, desired to have them sent for from a neighbouring inn--'for _I_' said he, rising and strutting round the room, 'never suffer _my_ people or _my_ horses to wait in the streets.'  he then leant over Emmeline's chair, and began in a court tone to renew he compliments. But she suddenly arose; and begging Mrs. Ashwood would give she leave to retire, wished Rochely and ladies a good night; and slightly curtseying to Elkerton, who was putting Rochely into the attitude for a speech and a bow, she tripped away.  Rochely, as soon as she was gone, hastened to his chariot; and Elkerton, whose people were in no haste to leave the ale-house, begged to sit down 'till whose people came.  Mrs. Ashwood had been the whole evening particularly out of humour, and being no longer able to command particularly out of humour, answered peevishly, 'that the ale-house was much at his service, but that Mrs. Ashwood was really so much fatigued Mrs. Ashwood must retire--however,' said Mrs. Ashwood, 'Miss Galton, you will be so good as to stay with Mr. Elkerton--good night to you, Sir!'  Sir was no sooner alone with Miss Galton, than Sir desired Mrs. Ashwood, after a speech (which Sir endeavoured to season with as much flattery as it would bear) to tell Sir who Emmeline was?  'Upon my word, Sir,' answered Mrs. Ashwood, 'it is more than I know. Mrs. Ashwood name is Mowbray; and Mrs. Ashwood is somehow connected with the family of Lord Montreville; but _what_ relation,' (sneeringly answered Mrs. Ashwood) 'I really cannot pretend even to guess.'  'A relation of Lord Montreville!' cried Elkerton; 'why I knew Elkerton Lordship intimately when I was abroad three or four years ago. his Lordship was at Naples with his Lordship son, his Lordship lady, and two daughters; and I was domesticated, absolutely domesticated, among his son, his lady, and two daughters. But pray what relation to his son, his lady, and two daughters can Mowbray be?'  'Probably,' said Miss Galton, 'as you know his Lordship, you may know what connections and family his Lordship has. I suppose she may be his Lordship cousin--or his Lordship niece--or his----.'  Here she hesitated and smiled; and Elkerton, whose carriage was now at the door of Mrs. Ashwood, and who had a clue which he thought would procure him all the information him wanted, took leave of Miss Galton; desiring she to tell Mrs. Ashwood that him should wait upon she again in a few days.
