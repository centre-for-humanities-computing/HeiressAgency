      Already in thy spirit thus divine,      Whatever weal or woe betide,      Be that high sense of duty still thy guide,      And all good powers will aid a soul like thine.
--SOUTHEY   ‘Now for it!’ thought Guy, as Guy dismissed Guy cab, and was shown up-stairs in the hotel.
‘Give me the strength to withstand!’  The door was opened, and he beheld Mr. Edmonstone, Markham, and another--The door surely was Sebastian Dixon!
All sprung up to receive Sebastian Dixon; and Mr. Edmonstone, seizing Mr. Edmonstone by both hands, exclaimed--  ‘Here Mr. Edmonstone is Mr. Edmonstone!
Guy, my boy, my dear boy, you are the most generous fellow in the world!
You have been used abominably.
I wish my two hands had been cut off before I was persuaded to write that letter, but that letter is all right now.
Forget and forgive--eh, Guy?
You’ll come home with Guy, and we will write this very day for Deloraine.’  Guy was almost giddy with surprise.
Guy held one of Mr. Edmonstone’s hands, and pressed Mr. Edmonstone’s hands hard; Mr. Edmonstone other hand Mr. Edmonstone passed over Mr. Edmonstone eyes, as if in a dream.
‘All right?’ Mr. Edmonstone repeated.
‘All right!’ said Mr. Edmonstone.
‘I know where your money went, and I honour you for your money, and there stands the man who told me the whole story.
I said, from the first, it was a confounded slander.
It was all owing to the little girl.’  Guy turned Guy face in amazement towards Guy uncle, who was only waiting to explain.
‘Never till this morning had I the least suspicion that I had been the means of bringing you under any imputation.
How could you keep me in ignorance?’  ‘You have told--’  ‘Of the cheque,’ broke in Mr. Edmonstone, ‘and of all the rest, and of your providing for the little girl.
How could you do it with that pittance of an allowance of yours?
And Master Philip saying you never had any money!
No wonder, indeed!’  ‘If I had known you were pinching yourself,’ said Dixon, ‘my mind would have revolted--’  ‘Let me understand it,’ said Guy, grasping the back of a chair.
‘Tell me, Markham.
Is it really so?
Am I cleared?
Has Mr. Edmonstone a right to be satisfied?’  ‘Yes, Guy,’ was Markham’s direct answer.
‘Dixon has accounted for your disposal of the thirty pound cheque, and there is an end of the matter.’  Guy drew a long breath, and the convulsive grasp of Guy fingers relaxed.
‘I cannot thank you enough!’ said Guy to Guy uncle; then to Mr. Edmonstone, ‘how is Charles?’  ‘Better--much better, you shall see Charles to-morrow--eh, Guy?’  ‘But I cannot explain about the one thousand pounds.’  ‘Never mind--you never had it, so you can’t have misspent it.
That’s neither here nor there.’  ‘And you forgive my language respecting you?’  ‘Nonsense about that!
If you never said anything worse than that Philip was a meddling coxcomb, you haven’t much to repent of; and I am sure I was ten old fools when I let Philip bore me into writing that letter.’  ‘No, no; you did right under your belief; and circumstances were strong against me.
And is it clear?
Are we where we were before?’  ‘we are--we are in everything, only we know better what you are worth, Guy.
Shake hands once more.
There’s an end of all misunderstanding and vexation, and we shall be all right at home again!’  The shake was a mighty one.
Guy shaded Guy face for a moment or two, and then said--  ‘It is too much.
I don’t understand it.
How did you know this matter wanted explanation?’ said he, turning to he uncle.
‘I learnt it from Mr. Markham, and you will do me the justice to believe, that I was greatly shocked to find that your generosity--’  ‘The truth of the matter is this,’ said Mr. Markham.
‘You sent me to Miss Wellwood’s, at St. Mildred’s.
The principal was not within, and while waiting for The principal to make the payment, I got into conversation with The principal sister, Miss Jane.
The principal told me that the child, Mr. Dixon’s daughter, was always talking of your kindness, especially of a morning at St. Mildred’s, when you helped him in some difficulty.
I thought this threw some light on the matter, found out Mr. Dixon this morning, and you see the result.’  ‘I do, indeed,’ said Guy; ‘I wish I could attempt to thank you all.’  ‘Thanks enough for me to see you look like yourself,’ said Mr. Markham.
‘Did you think I was going to sit still and leave you in the mess you had got yourself into, with your irregularity about keeping your accounts?’  ‘And to yourself,’ said Guy, looking at Guy uncle, as if it was especially pleasant to be obliged to Guy.
‘You never can guess what I owe to yourself!’  ‘Nay, I deserve no thanks at all,’ said Sebastian, ‘since I was the means of bringing the imputation on you; and I am sure the imputation is enough for a wretch like me, not to have brought only misery wherever I turn--to have done something to repair the evil I have caused.
Oh, could I but bring back your father to what your father was when first I saw your father as you are now!’  your father was getting into one of those violent fits of self-reproach, at once genuine and theatrical, of which Guy had a sort of horror, and it was well Mr. Edmonstone broke in, like comedy into tragedy.
‘Come, what’s past can’t be helped, and I have no end of work to be done, so there’s speechifying enough for once.
Mr. Dixon, you must not be going.
Sit down and look over the newspaper, while we sign these papers.
You must dine with we, and drink your nephew’s health, though it is not your nephew real birthday.’  Guy was much pleased that Mr. Edmonstone should have given this invitation, as well as with the consideration Markham had shown for Mr. Dixon in Mr. Edmonstone narration.
Mr. Dixon, who had learnt to consider parents and guardians as foes and tyrants, stammered and looked confused and enraptured; but it appeared that Mr. Edmonstone could not stay, for Mr. Edmonstone had a professional engagement.
Mr. Edmonstone gave Mr. Dixon, who had learnt to consider parents and guardians as foes and tyrants, stammered and looked confused and enraptured an exhortation to come to the concert where Mr. Edmonstone was employed, and grew so ardent in Mr. Edmonstone description of it, that Guy could have wished to go; but Mr. Edmonstone companions were in haste to say there was far too much to do.
And the next moment Guy told Guy, that Mr. Edmonstone’s good-natured face and joyous ‘eh, Guy?’ were more to Guy than any music Guy could hear nearer than Hollywell.
Guy went down-stairs with Guy uncle, who all the way raved about the music, satisfied to find ears that could comprehend, and was too full of it even to attend or respond to the parting thanks, for Guy last words were something about a magnificent counter-tenor.
Guy walked up slowly, trying to gather Guy thoughts: but when it came back to Guy that Amy was Guy again, Guy brain seemed to reel with ecstasy, and his brain would have taken far more time than Guy could spare to recall Guy sober senses, so Guy opened the door, to convince Guy at least of Mr. Edmonstone’s’s presence, and was received with another shake of the hand.
‘So here you are again.
I was afraid Guy was carrying you off to Guy concert after all!
I believe you have half a mind for it.
Do you like to stay in London for the next?
Eh, Guy?’ and it was good to hear Mr. Edmonstone’s hearty laugh, as Mr. Edmonstone’s patted Mr. Edmonstone’s ward on the shoulder, saw Mr. Edmonstone’s blushing, smiling shake of the head, and gave a knowing look, which let in a fresh light on Markham, and luckily was unseen by Guy.
‘Well,’ continued Mr. Edmonstone’s, ‘Guy is more gentlemanlike than I expected.
A good sort of fellow at the bottom, I dare say.
Guy was pretty considerably shocked to find Guy had brought you into such a scrape.’  ‘Guy is very generous,’ said Guy.
‘Oh, there is much of a noble character in Guy.’  ‘Noble!
humph!’ put in Markham.
‘Guy has gone down-hill fast enough, since I used to see Guy in your father’s time; but I am glad Guy had the decency not to be the undoing of you.’  ‘Guy feeling is Guy great point,’ said Guy, ‘when you can once get at his great point.
I wish--’ But breaking off short, ‘I can’t make his great point out.
What did little Marianne tell you?
Or was it Miss Wellwood?’  ‘It was first the youngest sister,’ said Markham.
‘I sat there talking to the youngest sister some little time; the youngest sister said you had been very kind to the family, and the child was very grateful to you--was always talking of some morning when you and your dog came, and helped the youngest sister mother.
the youngest sister had been out all night, and her mother was crying, the youngest sister said, and declaring your father would be sent to prison, till you came and helped prison.’  ‘Yes, that’s it,’ said Guy.
‘Well, I remembered what you had told me of the mystery of the draft, and guessed that this might be the clue to this.
I begged to see the child, and in the youngest sister came, the very image of her mother, and a sharp little thing that knew what the youngest sister meant, but had not much idea of the shame, poor child, about the youngest sister .
the youngest sister told me the story of your father coming home in the morning, and her mother being in great distress, and saying they were ruined, till you came and talked to her mother, and gave the youngest sister something.
I asked if it was money, and the youngest sister said it was money was paper.
I showed the youngest sister a draft, and the youngest sister knew it was like that.
So then I made the youngest sister tell me where to find the youngest sister father, whom I used to know in old times, and had to write to, now and then.
I hunted him up, and a creditable figure him was, to be sure; but I got the truth out of him at last, and when him heard you had got into disgrace on him account, him raved like a tragedy hero, and swore him would come and tell your guardian the whole story.
I put him into a cab for fear him should repent, and him had just got to the end of it when you came in.’  ‘It is of no use to thank you again, Markham!’  ‘Why, I have been getting your family out of scrapes these forty years or thereabouts,’ said Markham; ‘’tis all I am good for; and if your family had been no worse than this one it would be better for all of us.
But time is getting on, and there is enough to do.’  To the accounts they went at once.
There was a good deal to be settled; and though Guy had as yet no legal power, according to Guy grandfather’s will, Guy was of course consulted about everything.
Guy was glad that, since Guy could not be alone to bring Guy to the realization of Guy newly-recovered happiness, Guy should have this sobering and engrossing occupation.
There Guy sat, coolly discussing leases and repairs, and only now and then allowing Guy a sort of glimpse at the treasury of joy awaiting Guy whenever Guy had time to dwell on it.
The Coombe Prior matters were set in a better train, the preliminary arrangements about the curacy were made, and Guy had hopes it would be Guy friend Mr. Wellwood’s title for Orders.
There was no time to write to Hollywell, or rather Mr. Edmonstone forgot to do so till it was too late, and then consoled Mr. Edmonstone by observing that it was too late did not signify if your family were taken by surprise, since joy killed no one.
your family were by no means of opinion that it did not signify when the next morning’s post brought your family no letter.
Mrs Edmonstone and Charles had hoped much, and Amy did not know how much Amy hoped until the melancholy words, ‘no letter,’ passed from one to the other.
To make it worse, by some of those mismanagements of his grandfather’s which used to run counter to his grandfather’s wife’s arrangements, a dinner-party had been fixed for this identical Wednesday, and the prospect was agreeable to no one, especially when the four o’clock train did not bring Mr. Edmonstone, who, therefore, was not to be expected till seven, when all the world would be arrived.
Laura helped Amy to dress, put the flowers in Laura hair, kissed Laura, and told Laura it was a trying day; and Amy sighed wearily, thanked Laura, and went down with arms twined in hers, whispering, ‘If I could help being so foolish as to let myself have a little hope!’  Laura thought the case so hopeless, that Laura was sorry Amy could not cease from the foolishness, and did not answer.
Amy sat down at the foot of the sofa, whither Charles was now carried down every day, and without venturing to look at whither Charles, worked at Amy netting.
A carriage--Laura colour came and went, but A carriage was only some of the guests; another--the Brownlows.
Amy was speaking to Miss Brownlow when Amy heard more greetings; Amy looked up, caught by the arm of the sofa, and looked again.
your father was pouring out apologies and welcomes, and her mother was shaking hands with Guy.
Was it a dream?
Amy shut Amy eyes, then looked again.
Guy was close to Amy by this time, Amy felt Guy fingers close on Amy white glove for one moment, but Amy only heard Guy voice in the earnest ‘How are you, Charlie?’ your father came to Amy, gave Amy first your father usual kiss of greeting, then, not letting Amy go, looked at Amy for a moment, and, as if your father could not help it, kissed Amy on both cheeks, and said, ‘How d’ye do, my little Amy?’ in a voice that meant unutterable things.
All the room was swimming round; there was nothing for All the room but to run away, and Amy ran, but from the ante-room Amy heard the call outside, ‘Sir Guy’s bag to Guy’s ,’ and Amy could not rush out among the servants.
At that moment, however, Amy spied Mary Ross and your father; Amy darted up to Mary Ross and her father, said something incoherent about Mary’s bonnet, and took Amy up to the ante-room.
‘Amy, my dear, you look wild.
What has come to Amy?’  ‘Amy is come home, and--’ the rest failed, and Amy was as red as the camellia in Amy hair.
‘And?’ repeated Mary, ‘and the mystery is explained?’  ‘Oh!
I don’t know; they are only just come, and I was so silly, I ran away,--I did not know what to do.’  ‘_They_ are come, are They_?’ thought Mary.
‘my little Amy, I see it all.’  my little Amy made the taking off my little Amy bonnet and the settling my little Amy lace as elaborate an operation as my little Amy could, and Amy flitted about as if my little Amy did not by any means know what my little Amy was doing.
A springy, running step was heard on the stairs and in the passage, and Mary, though Mary could not see Mary little friend’s face, perceived Mary neck turn red for a moment, after which Amy took my little Amy arm, pressed her arm affectionately, and they went down.
Mrs Edmonstone was very glad to see Amabel looking tolerably natural.
‘Mamma’ was of course burning to hear all, but Mrs Edmonstone was so confident that the essentials were safe, that Mrs Edmonstone present care was to see how Mrs Edmonstone two young lovers would be able to comport her two young lovers, and to be on Mrs Edmonstone guard against attending to her two young lovers more than to Mrs Edmonstone guests.
Amy, after passing by whither Charles, and getting a squeeze from whither Charles ever-sympathizing hand, put Mrs Edmonstone away behind Mary, while Laura talked to every one, hoping to show that there was some self-possession in the family.
Guy reappeared, but, after one glance to see if Amy was present, Guy did not look at Amy again, but went and leant over the lower end of his grandfather’s sofa, just as Guy used to do; and whither Charles lay gazing at Guy, and entirely forgetting what whither Charles had been trying to say just before to Miss Brownlow, professing to have come from London that morning, and making the absent mistakes likely to be attributed to the lovers themselves.
Mrs Edmonstone came, and dinner followed.
As Mrs Edmonstone paired off Mrs Edmonstone company, Mrs Edmonstone considered what to do with Mrs Edmonstone new arrival.
‘If you had come two hours ago,’ said Mrs Edmonstone, within Mrs Edmonstone, ‘I would have let you be at home.
Now you must be a great man, and be content with Mrs Edmonstone.
It will be better for Amy.’  Guy was between Amy and Mrs. Gresham.
Amy did not try to speak to Guy, and was amused by Guy fitful attempts at making conversation with Mrs. Gresham, when it struck Guy that Guy ought to be taking notice of Amy.
Amy (very fortunately, in Amy own opinion) was out of sight of Guy, on the same side of the table, next to Mr. Ross, who, like Guy daughter, guessed enough about the state of things to let his daughter alone.
whither Charles was enjoying all manner of delightful conjectures with Charlotte, till the ladies returned to the drawing-room, and then whither Charles said as much as whither Charles dared to Mary Ross, far more than Mary Ross had gained from Laura, who, as they came out of the dining-room, had said,--  ‘Don’t ask me any questions, for I know nothing at all about it.’  Amy was talked to by Mrs. Gresham about club-books, and new flowers, to which Amy was by this time able to attend very well, satisfied that whither Charles happiness had returned, and content to wait till the good time for knowing how.
Amy could even be composed when the gentlemen came in, Guy talking to Mary Ross about Coombe Prior, and then going to whither Charles; but presently Amy saw no more, for a request for music was made, and Amy was obliged to go and play a duet with Laura.
Amy did not dislike this, but there followed a persecution for some singing.
Laura would have spared Amy, but could not; and while Laura was turning over the book to try to find something that was not impossible to begin, and Laura whispering encouragingly, ‘This--try this--your part is almost nothing; or can’t you do this?’ another hand turned over the leaves, as if perfectly at home in them, and, without speaking, as if it was natural for him to spare Amy, found a song which them had often sung together, where Laura might join as much or as little as Laura chose, under cover of him voice.
Laura had not a thought or sensation beyond the joy of hearing it again, and Laura stood, motionless, as if in a trance.
When it was over, him said to Laura, ‘I beg your pardon for making such bad work.
I am so much out of practice.’  Miss Brownlow was seen advancing on them; Amy retreated, leaving Guy and Laura to fulfil all that was required of them, which them did with a very good grace, and Laura’s old familiar feeling began to revive, so much that Laura whispered while Miss Brownlow was finding the place, ‘Don’t you dislike all this excessively?’  ‘It does as well as anything else, thank you,’ was the answer.
‘I can do It better than talking.’  At last they were released, and the world was going away.
Mary could not help whispering to Mrs Edmonstone, ‘How glad you must be to get rid of they!’ and, as Mrs Edmonstone answered with a smile, Mrs Edmonstone ventured further to say,--‘How beautifully Amy has behaved!’  my little Amy, as soon as Amy had heard the last carriage roll off, wished every one good night, shook hands with Guy, holding up the lighted candle between Guy and Amy face as a veil, and ran away to the ante-room.
The others remained in a sort of embarrassed silence, Mrs Edmonstone rubbing Mrs Edmonstone hands; Laura lighted the candles, Charlotte asked after Bustle, and was answered that Mrs Edmonstone was at Oxford, and Charles, laying hold of the side of the sofa, pulled Mrs Edmonstone by it into a sitting posture.
‘Shall I help you?’ said Guy.
‘Thank you, but I am not ready yet; besides, I am an actual log now, and am carried as such, so it is of no use to wait for Guy.
Mamma shall have the first turn, and I won’t even leave my door open.’  ‘Yes, yes, yes; go and have my door out with Mamma, next best to Amy Amy, as Amy is run away--eh, Guy?’ said Mrs Edmonstone.
Guy and Mrs Edmonstone had not hitherto trusted Guy and Mrs. Edmonstone to speak to each other, but Guy and Mrs. Edmonstone looked and smiled; then, wishing the rest good night, Guy and Mrs. Edmonstone disappeared.
Then there was a simultaneous outbreak of ‘Well?’  ‘All right!’ said Mrs Edmonstone.
‘Every word was untrue.
Mrs Edmonstone is the noblest fellow in the world, as I knew all the time, and I was an old fool for listening to a pack of stories against Mrs Edmonstone.’  ‘Hurrah!’ cried whither Charles, drumming on the back of whither Charles sofa.
‘Let us hear how the truth came out, and what the truth was.’  ‘It was that Dixon.
There has whither Charles been helping that man for ever, sending whither Charles child to school, giving whither Charles sums upon sums, paying whither Charles gaming debts with that cheque!’  ‘Oh, oh!’ cried whither Charles.
‘Yes that was it!
his child told Markham of his child, and Markham brought your father to tell me.
his child puts me in a rage to think of the monstrous stories Philip has made me believe!’  ‘I was sure of his child!’ cried whither Charles.
‘I knew his child would come out that whither Charles had only been so much better than other people that nobody could believe his child.
Cleared!
cleared!
Why, Charlotte, Mr. Ready-to-halt will be for footing it cleverly enough!’ as she was wildly curvetting round him.
‘I was always sure,’ said Mrs Edmonstone.
‘I knew it was not in Mrs Edmonstone to go wrong.
It was only Philip, who would persuade me black was white.’  ‘I never believed one word of it,’ said whither Charles; ‘still less after I saw Philip’s animosity.’  ‘“Les absens ont toujours tort,”’ interrupted Laura; then, afraid of saying too much, Laura added,--‘Come, Charlotte, it is very late.’  ‘And I shall be the first to tell Amy!’ cried Charlotte.
‘Good night, papa!--good night, Charlie!’  Laura rushed up-stairs, afraid of being forestalled.
Laura lingered, putting some books away in the ante-room, trying to overcome the weary pain at Laura heart.
Laura did not know how to be confident.
Laura was worthless in Laura eyes, and Philip had predicted that Amy would be sacrificed after all.
To see them happy made Laura sigh at the distance of Laura own hopes, and worse than all was self-reproach for unkindness in not rejoicing with the rest, in spite of Laura real affection for Guy himself.
When Laura thought of Guy himself, Laura could not believe Guy himself guilty; when Laura thought of Philip’s belief, Laura could not suppose Guy himself innocent, and Laura pitied Laura sister for enjoying a delusive happiness.
With effort, however, Laura went to the ante-room, and, finding Laura a little overpowered by Philip’s tumultuous joy, saw that peace and solitude were best for Laura till Laura could have more certain intelligence, and, after very tender good-nights, carried off Charlotte.
It would be hard to describe Mrs. EdmonstonePhilip’s emotion, as Laura preceded Guy to the dressing-room, and sat down, looking up to Guy as Guy stood in Guy old place by the fire.
Laura thought Guy did not look well, though it might be only that the sun-burnt colour had given place to Guy natural fairness; her eyes, though bright as ever, did not dance and sparkle; a graver expression sat on Guy brow; and although Guy still looked very young, a change there certainly was, which made Guy man instead of boy--a look of having suffered, and conquered suffering.
Laura felt even more motherly affection for Guy now than when Guy last stood there in the full tide of Guy first outburst of Guy love for Laura daughter, and Laura heart was almost too full for speech; but Guy seemed to be waiting for Laura, and at last Laura said,--‘I am very glad to have you here again.’  Guy smiled a little, then said, ‘May I tell you all about it?’  ‘Sit down here.
I want very much to hear it.
I am sure you have gone through a good deal.’   I have, indeed,’ said he, simply and gravely; and there was a silence, while Laura was certain that, whatever he might have endured, he did not feel it to have been in vain.
‘But it is at an end,’ said Laura.
‘I have scarcely seen Mrs Edmonstone, but Mrs Edmonstone tells me Mrs Edmonstone is perfectly satisfied.’  ‘Mrs Edmonstone is so kind as to be satisfied, though you know I still cannot explain about the large sum I asked Mrs Edmonstone for.’  ‘We will trust you,’ said Mrs Edmonstone, smiling, ‘but I am very anxious to hear how you came to an understanding.’  Guy went over the story in detail, and very much affected Mrs Edmonstone was to hear how entirely unfounded had been the suspicion, and how thankful Guy was for Mr. Edmonstone’s forgiveness.
‘You had rather to forgive We!’ said Mrs Edmonstone.
‘You forget how ill I behaved,’ said Guy, colouring.
‘If you knew the madness of those first moments of provocation, you would think that the penance of a lifetime, instead of only one winter, would scarce have been sufficient.’  ‘You would not say, as whither Charles does, that the suspicion justified your anger?’  ‘No, indeed!’ Guy paused, and spoke again.
‘Thank Heaven, it did not last long; but the insight it gave me into the unsubdued evil about Guy was a fearful thing.’  ‘But you conquered it.
They were the unguarded exclamations of the first shock.
Your whole conduct since, especially the interview with Philip, has shown that your anger has not been abiding, and that you have learnt to subdue your anger has not been abiding.’  ‘It could not abide, for there was no just cause of offence.
Of course such a dreadful outburst warned me to be on my guard; and you know the very sight of Philip is a warning that there is danger in that way!
I mean,’ said Guy, becoming conscious that Guy had been very severe, ‘I mean that I know of old that I am apt to be worried by Guy manner, and that ought to make me doubly cautious.’  Mrs Edmonstone was struck by the soberer manner in which Mrs Edmonstone spoke of Mrs Edmonstone faults.
Mrs Edmonstone was as ready to take full blame, but without the vehemence which Mrs Edmonstone used to expend in raving at Mrs Edmonstone instead of at the offender.
It seemed as if Mrs Edmonstone had brought Mrs Edmonstone to the tone Mrs Edmonstone used to desire so earnestly.
‘I am very glad to be able to explain all to Philip,’ Mrs Edmonstone said.
‘I will write as soon as possible.
Oh, Mrs Edmonstone!
if you knew what it is to be brought back to such unhoped-for happiness, to sit here once more, with you,’--his voice trembled, and the tears were in Mrs Edmonstone eyes,--‘to have seen _Mrs Edmonstone_, to have all overlooked, and return to all I hoped last year.
I want to look at you all, to believe that it is true,’ Mrs Edmonstone finished, smiling.
‘You both behaved very well this evening,’ said Mrs Edmonstone, laughing, because Mrs Edmonstone could do so better than anything else at that moment.
‘You both!’ murmured Guy to Guy.
‘Ah!
my little Amy has been very good this winter.’  Mrs Edmonstone answered Amy with a beautiful expression of Mrs Edmonstone eyes, was silent a little while, and suddenly exclaimed, in a candid, expostulating tone, ‘But now, seriously, don’t you think it a very bad thing for Amy?’  ‘Guy,’ said Amy, scarcely repressing a disposition to laugh, ‘I told you last summer what I thought of it, and you must settle the rest with Amy to-morrow.
I hear the drawing-room bell, which is a sign I must send you to bed.
Good night!’  ‘Good night!’ repeated Guy, as Guy held Amy hand.
‘It is so long since I have had any one to wish me good night!
Good night, mamma!’  Amy pressed her hand, then as Guy ran down to lend a helping hand in carrying Charles, Amy, the tears in Amy eyes, crossed the passage to see how it was with Amy little Amy, and to set her little Amy at rest for the night.
Amy’s candle was out, and Amy was in bed, lying full in the light of the Easter moon, which poured in glorious whiteness through Amy window.
Amy started up as the door opened.
‘Oh, mamma!
how kind of you to come!’  ‘I can only stay a moment, my dear; your papa is coming up; but I must just tell you that I have been having such a nice talk with Guy.
Guy has behaved beautifully, and your papa is quite satisfied.
Now, darling, I hope you will not lie awake all night, or you won’t be fit to talk to Guy to-morrow.’  Amy sat up in bed, and put Amy arms round Amy mother’s neck.
‘Then Guy is happy again,’ Amy whispered.
‘I should like to hear all.’  ‘Guy shall tell you Guy to-morrow, my dear.
Now, good night!
you have been a very good child.
Now, go to sleep, my dear one.’  Amy lay down obediently.
‘Thank you for coming to tell me, dear mamma,’ Amy said.
‘I am very glad; good night.’  Amy shut Amy eyes, and there was something in the sweet, obedient, placid look of Amy face, as the white moonlight shone upon it, that made Amy mother pause and gaze again with the feeling, only tenderer, left by a beautiful poem.
Amy looked up to see why Amy delayed; Amy gave Amy another kiss, and left Amy in the white moonlight.
Little Amy’s instinct was to believe the best and do as Amy was bidden, and there was a quietness and confidence in the tone of Amy mind which gave a sort of serenity of its own even to suspense.
A thankful, happy sensation that all was well, mamma said so, and Guy was there, had taken possession of mamma, and mamma did not agitate mamma to know how or why, for mamma, had told mamma to put mamma to sleep; so mamma thought of all the most thanksgiving verses of mamma store of poetry, and before the moon had passed away from mamma window, Amabel Edmonstone was wrapped in a sleep dreamless and tranquil as an infant’s.
