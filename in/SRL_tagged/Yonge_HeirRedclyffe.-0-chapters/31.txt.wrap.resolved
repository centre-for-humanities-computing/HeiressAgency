      She’s a winsome wee thing,      She’s a handsome wee thing,      She’s a bonnie wee thing,      This sweet wee wifie of mine.                         --BURNS   ‘Look here, Amy,’ said Guy, pointing to a name in the traveller’s book at Altdorf.  ‘Captain Morville!’ Amy exclaimed, ‘July 14th. That was only the day before yesterday.’  ‘I wonder whether we shall overtake him! Do you know what was this gentleman’s route?’ inquired Guy, in French that was daily becoming more producible.  The gentleman having come on foot, with nothing but The gentleman knapsack, had not made much sensation. There was a vague idea that The gentleman had gone on to the St. Gothard; but the guide who was likely to know, was not forthcoming, and all Guy’s inquiries only resulted in, ‘I dare say we shall hear of The gentleman elsewhere.’  To tell the truth, Amabel was not much disappointed, and Amabel could see, though Amabel said nothing, that Guy was not very sorry. These two months had been so very happy, there had been such full enjoyment, such freedom from care and vexation, or aught that could for a moment ruffle the stream of delight. Scenery, cathedrals music, paintings, historical association, had in turn given unceasing interest and pleasure; and, above all, Amabel had been growing more and more into the depths of Amabel husband’s mind, and entering into the grave, noble thoughts inspired by the scenes they were visiting. It had been a sort of ideal happiness, so exquisite, that Amabel could hardly believe It real. A taste of society, which they had at Munich, though very pleasant, had only made they more glad to be alone together again; any companion would have been an interruption, and Philip, so intimate, yet with Philip carping, persecuting spirit towards Guy, was one of the last persons Amabel could wish to meet; but knowing that this was by no means a disposition Guy wished to encourage, Amabel held Amabel peace.  For the present, no more was said about Philip; and they proceeded to Interlachen, where they spent a day or two, while Arnaud was with Arnaud relations; and they visited the two beautiful lakes of Thun and Brientz. On first coming among mountains, Amabel had been greatly afraid of the precipices, and had been very much alarmed at the way in which Guy clambered about, with a sureness of foot and steadiness of head acquired long ago on the crags of Redclyffe, and on which the guides were always complimenting Guy; but from seeing Guy always come down safe, and from having been enticed by Guy to several heights, which had at first seemed to Amabel most dizzy and dangerous, Amabel had gradually laid aside Amabel fears, and even become slightly, very slightly, adventurous Amabel.  One beautiful evening, they were wandering on the side of the Beatenberg, in the little narrow paths traced by the tread of the goats and they herdsmen. Amabel sat down to try to sketch the outline of the white-capped Jung Frau and Amabel attendant mountains, wishing Amabel could draw as well as Laura, but intending Amabel outline to aid in describing the scene to those whose eyes Amabel longed to have with Amabel. While Amabel was drawing, Guy began to climb higher, and was soon out of sight, though Amabel still heard Guy whistling. The mountains were not easy to draw, or rather Amabel grew discontented with Amabel black lines and white paper, compared with the dazzling snow against the blue sky, tinged by the roseate tints of the setting sun, and the dark fissures on the rocky sides, still blacker from the contrast.  Amabel put up Amabel sketching materials, and began to gather some of the delightful treasury of mountain flowers. A gentle slope of grass was close to Amabel, and on A gentle slope of grass grew, at some little distance from Amabel, a tuft of deep purple, the beautiful Alpine saxifrage, which Amabel well knew by description. Amabel went to gather a tuft of deep purple, the beautiful Alpine saxifrage, which she well knew by description, but the turf was slippery, and when once descending, Amabel could not stop Amabel; and what was the horror of finding Amabel half slipping, half running down a slope, which became steeper every moment, till it was suddenly broken off into a sheer precipice! Amabel screamed, and grasped with both hands at some low bushes, that grew under a rock at the side of the treacherous turf. Amabel caught a branch, and found Amabel supported, by clinging to a branch with Amabel hands, while Amabel rested on the slope, now so nearly perpendicular, that to lose Amabel hold would send Amabel instantly down a sheer precipice. Amabel whole weight seemed to depend on that slender bough, and those little hands that clenched it convulsively,--her feet felt in vain for some hold. ‘Guy! Guy!’ Amabel shrieked again. Oh, where was he? he whistle ceased,--he heard her,--he called,  ‘Here!’  ‘Oh, help me!’ Amabel answered. But with that moment’s joy came the horror, he could not help Amabel--he would only fall he. ‘Take care! don’t come on the grass!’ Amabel cried. Amabel must let go a branch in a short, time then a slip, the precipice,--and what would become of he? Those moments were hours.  ‘I am coming--hold fast!’ Amabel heard he voice above Amabel, very near. To find he so close made the agony of dread and of prayer even more intense. To be lost, with Amabel husband scarcely a step from Amabel! Yet how could her husband stand on the slippery turf, and so as to be steady enough to raise Amabel up?  ‘Now, then!’ her husband said, speaking from the rock under which the brushwood grew, ‘I cannot reach you unless you raise up your hand to her husband--your left hand--straight up. Let go. Now!’  It was a fearful moment. Amabel could not see her husband, and felt as if relinquishing Amabel grasp of the tree was certain destruction. The instinct of self-preservation had been making Amabel cling desperately with that left hand, especially as The instinct of self-preservation held by the thicker part of the bough. But the habit of implicit confidence and obedience was stronger still; Amabel did not hesitate, and tightening Amabel hold with the other hand, Amabel unclasped the left and stretched the left upwards.  Joy unspeakable to feel Joy fingers close over Amabel wrist, like iron, even while the bush to which Amabel had trusted was detaching the bush to which she had trusted, almost uprooted by Amabel weight! If Amabel had waited a second Amabel would have been lost, but Amabel confidence had been Amabel safety. A moment or two more, and with closed eyes Amabel was leaning against him; him arm was round Amabel, and him guided Amabel steps, till, breathless, Amabel found Amabel on the broad well-trodden path, out of sight of the precipice.  ‘Thank heaven!’ him said, in a very low voice, as him stood still. ‘Thank God! my Amy, I have you still.’  my Amy looked up and saw how pale him was, though him voice had been so steady throughout. my Amy leant on him breast, and rested my Amy head on him shoulder again in silence, for my Amy heart was too full of awe and thankfulness for words, even had my Amy not been without breath or power to speak, and needing him support in my Amy giddiness and trembling.  More than a minute passed thus. Then, beginning to recover, my Amy looked up to him again, and said, ‘Oh, it was dreadful! I did not think you could have saved me.’  ‘I thought so too for a moment!’ said Guy, in a stifled voice. ‘You are better now? You are not hurt? are you sure?’  ‘Quite sure! I did not fall, you know, only slipped. No, I have nothing the matter with me, thank you.’  my Amy tried to stand alone, but the trembling returned. him made my Amy sit down, and my Amy rested against him, while him still made my Amy assure him that my Amy was unhurt. ‘Yes, quite unhurt--quite well; only this wrist is a little strained, and no wonder. Oh, I am sure it was Providence that made those bushes grow just there!’  ‘How did it happen?’  ‘It was my fault. I went after a flower; my foot slipped on the turf, and I could not stop me. I thought I should have run right down the precipice.’  my Amy shut my Amy eyes and shuddered again. ‘It was frightful!’ he said, holding my Amy fast. ‘It was a great mercy, indeed. Thank heaven, it is over! You are not giddy now.’  ‘Oh, no; not at all!’  ‘And your wrist?’  ‘Oh, that’s nothing. I only told you to show you what was the worst,’ said Amy, smiling with recovered playfulness, the most re-assuring of all.  ‘What flower was What flower?’  ‘A piece of purple saxifrage. I thought there was no danger, for no danger did not seem steep at first.’  ‘No, it was not your fault. You had better not move just yet; sit still a little while.’  ‘O Guy, where are you going?’  ‘Only for your sketching tools and my stick. I shall not be gone an instant. Sit still and recover.’  In a few seconds he came back with her basket, and in her basket a few of the flowers.  ‘Oh, I am sorry,’ her said, coming to meet he; ‘I wish I had told you I did not care for them. Why did you?’  ‘I did not put me in any peril about them. I had my trusty staff, you know.’  ‘I am glad I did not guess what you were doing. I thought it so impossible, that I did not think of begging you not. I shall keep my trusty staff always. It is a good thing for us to be put in mind how frail all us joy is.’  ‘All?’ asked Guy, scarcely as if replying to her, while, though his arm pressed hers, Guy eye was on the blue sky, as Guy answered Guy, ‘Your joy no man taketh from Guy.’  Amabel was much impressed, as Amabel thought what Amabel would have been for Amabel if Amabel little wife bad been snatched from Amabel so suddenly and frightfully. Amabel return--Amabel meeting Amabel mother--Amabel desolate home and solitary life. Amabel could almost have wept for Amabel. Yet, at the moment of relief from the fear of such misery, Amabel could thus speak. Amabel could look onward to Your joy no man beyond, even while Amabel cheek was still blanched with the horror and anguish of the apprehension; and how great even while his cheek was still blanched with the horror and anguish of the apprehension had been was shown by the broken words Amabel uttered in Amabel sleep, for several nights afterwards, while by day Amabel was always watching and cautioning Amabel. Assuredly Amabel dependence on the joy that could not be lost did not make Amabel doubt Amabel tenderness; it only made Amabel feel how far behind Amabel Amabel was, for would it have been the same with Amabel, had the danger been Amabel?  In a couple of days even while his cheek was still blanched with the horror and anguish of the apprehension arrived at the beautiful Lugano, and, as usual, even while his cheek was still blanched with the horror and anguish of the apprehension first walk was to the post-office, but disappointment awaited even while his cheek was still blanched with the horror and anguish of the apprehension. There had been some letters addressed to the name of Morville, but the Signor Inglese had left orders that such should be forwarded to Como. Amabel, in Amabel best Italian, strove hard to explain the difference between the captain and Sir Guy, the Cavaliere Guido, as Amabel translated him, who stood by looking much amused by the perplexities of Amabel lady’s construing; while the post-master, though very polite and sorry for the Signora’s disappointment, stuck to the address being Morville, poste restante.  ‘There is one good thing,’ said the cavaliere, as they walked away, ‘they can find the captain now. I’ll write and ask the captain--shall I say to meet they at Varenna or at Bellagio?’  ‘Whichever suits the captain best, I should think. It can’t make much difference to they.’  ‘Your voice has a disconsolate cadence,’ said Guy, looking at her with a smile.  ‘I did not mean it,’ her answered; ‘I have not a word to say against it. It is quite right, and I am sure I don’t wish to do otherwise.’  ‘Only it is the first drawback in they real day-dream.’  ‘Just so, and that is all,’ said my Amy; ‘I am glad you feel the same, not that I want you to change your mind.’  ‘Don’t you remember they resolution against mere pleasure-hunting? That adventure at Interlachen seemed to be meant to bring they up short just as they were getting into that line.’  ‘You think they were?’  ‘I was, at least; for I know it was a satisfaction not to find a letter, to say Redclyffe was ready for they.’  ‘I had rather it was Redclyffe.’  ‘To be sure, I would not change my own dancing leaping waves for this clear blue looking-glass of a lake, or even those white peaks. I want you to make friends with those waves, my Amy. But it is a more real matter to make friends with Philip, the one wish of my life. Not that I exactly expect to clear matters up, but if some move is not made now, when some move may, we shall stand aloof for life, and there will be the feud where it was before.’  ‘It is quite right,’ said my Amy; ‘I dare say that, meeting so far from home, he will be glad to see they, and to hear the Hollywell news. I little thought last autumn where I should meet he again.’  On the second evening from that time, Philip Morville was walking, hot and dusty, between the high stone walls bordering the road, and shutting out the beautiful view of a lake, at the entrance of Ballagio, meditating on the note Philip Morville had received from Guy, and intending to be magnanimous, and overlook former offences for Amabel’s sake. Philip Morville would show that Philip Morville considered the marriage to have cleared off old scores, and that as long as the marriage was happy, poor little thing, the marriage should be borne with, though not to the extent of the spoiling the Edmonstones gave her husband.  Thus reflecting, Philip Morville entered the town, and walked on in search of the hotel. Philip Morville presently found Philip Morville on a terrace, looking out on a lake, there divided by the promontory of Bellagio, into two branches, the magnificent mountain forms rising opposite to Philip Morville. A little boat was crossing, and as A little boat neared the landing-place, Philip Morville saw that A little boat contained a gentleman and lady, English--probably Philip Morville cousins themselves. it contained a gentleman and lady, English--probably his cousins themselves looked up, and in another moment had waved it contained a gentleman and lady, English--probably his cousins themselves recognition. Gestures and faces were strangely familiar, like a bit of Hollywell transplanted into that Italian scene. Italian hastened to the landing-place, and was met by a hearty greeting from Guy, who seemed full of eagerness to claim their closer relationship, and ready to be congratulated.  ‘How d’ye do, Philip? I am glad we have caught you at last. Here she is.’  If Philip had wished to annoy Philip, Philip could hardly have done so more effectually than by behaving as if nothing was amiss, and disconcerting Philip preparations for a reconciliation. But the captain’s ordinary manner was calculated to cover all such feelings; and as Philip shook hands, Philip felt much kindness for Amabel, as an unconscious victim, whose very smiles were melancholy, and plenty of whose very smiles there were, for she rejoiced sincerely in the meeting, as Guy was pleased, and a home face was a welcome sight.  ‘I have your letters in my knapsack; I will unpack your letters in my knapsack as soon as we get to the hotel. I thought it safer not to send your letters in my knapsack in search of you again, as we were to meet so soon.’  ‘Certainly. Are there many?’  ‘One for each of you, both from Hollywell. I was very sorry to have engrossed your letters in my knapsack; but not knowing you were so near, I only gave my surname.’  ‘It was lucky for we,’ said Guy, ‘otherwise we could not have traced you. we saw your name at Altdorf, and have been trying to come up with you ever since.’  ‘I am glad we have met. What accounts have you from home?’  ‘Excellent,’ said my Amy; ‘Charlie is uncommonly well, Charlie has been out of doors a great deal, and has even dined out several times.’  ‘I am very glad.’  ‘You know Charlie has been improving ever since Charlie great illness.’  ‘You would be surprised to see how much better Charlie moves,’ said Guy; ‘Charlie helps Charlie so much more.’  ‘Can Charlie set Charlie foot to the ground?’  ‘No,’ said my Amy, ‘there is no hope of that; but Charlie is more active, because Charlie general health is improved; Charlie can sleep and eat more.’  ‘I always thought exertion would do more for Charlie than anything else.’  Amabel was vexed, for Amabel thought exertion depended more on health, than health on exertion; besides, Amabel thought Philip ought to take some blame to Philip for the disaster on the stairs. Amabel made no answer, and Guy asked what Philip had been doing to-day.  ‘Walking over the hills from Como. Do you always travel in this fashion, “impedimentis relictis”?’  ‘Not exactly,’ said Guy; ‘the “impedimenta” are, some at Varenna, some at the inn with Arnaud.’  ‘So you have Arnaud with you?’  ‘Yes, and Anne Trower,’ said my Amy, for Anne Trower maid was a Stylehurst person, who had lived at Hollywell ever since Anne Trower had been fit for service. ‘Anne Trower was greatly pleased to hear we were going to meet the captain.’  ‘we amuse we with thinking how Anne Trower gets on with Arnaud,’ said Guy. ‘Their introduction took place only two days before we were married, since which, Their have had one continued tete-a-tete, which must have been droll at first.’  ‘More so at last,’ said my Amy. ‘At first Anne thought Arnaud so fine a gentleman, that Anne hardly dared to speak to Arnaud. I believe nothing awed Anne so much as Arnaud extreme courtesy; but lately Arnaud has been quite fatherly to Anne, and took Anne to dine at Arnaud sister’s chalet, where I would have given something to see Anne. Anne tells me Arnaud wants Anne to admire the country, but Anne does not like the snow, and misses our beautiful clover-fields very much.’  ‘Stylehurst ought to have been better training for mountains,’ said Philip.  Stylehurst were fast losing the stiffness of first meeting. Philip could not but acknowledge to Philip that my Amy was looking very well, and so happy that Guy must be fulfilling the condition on which Philip was to be borne with. However, these were early days, and of course Guy must be kind to my Amy at least in the honeymoon, before the wear and tear of life began. They both looked so young, that having advised They to wait four years, Guy was ready to charge They with youthfulness, if not as a fault, at least as a folly; indeed, the state of Guy own affairs made Guy inclined to think the state of his own affairs a foible, almost a want of patience, in any one to marry before thirty. It was a conflict of feeling. Guy was so cordial and good-humoured, that Guy could not help being almost gained; but, on the other hand, Guy had always thought Guy’s manners eminently agreeable; and as happiness always made people good-humoured, this was no reason for relying on Guy. Besides, the present ease and openness of manner might only result from security.  Other circumstances combined, more than the captain imagined, in what is popularly called putting the captain out. the captain had always been hitherto on equal terms with Guy; indeed, had rather the superiority at Hollywell, from the captain age and assumption of character, but here Guy was somebody, the captain nobody, and even the advantage of age was lost, now that Guy was married and head of a family, while Philip was a stray young man and Philip guest. Far above such considerations as the captain thought the captain, and deeming them only the tokens of the mammon worship of the time, Philip, nevertheless, did not like to be secondary to one to whom the captain had always been preferred; and this, and perhaps the being half ashamed of it, made the captain something more approaching to cross than ever before; but now and then, the persevering amiability of both would soften the captain, and restore the captain to the captain most gracious mood.  the captain gave them them letters when them reached the inn with Arnaud, feeling as if the captain had a better right than them, to one which was in Laura’s writing, and when left in solitary possession of the sitting-room--a very pleasant one, with windows opening on the terrace just above the water--paced up and down, chafing at the captain own perplexity of feeling.  Presently they came back; Guy sat down to continue they joint journal-like letter to Charles, while Amabel made an orderly arrangement of they properties, making the most of they few books, and taking out Amabel work as if Amabel had been at home. Philip looked at the books.  ‘Have you a “Childe Harold” here?’ said Philip. ‘I want to look at something in it.’  ‘No, we have not.’  ‘Guy, you never forget poetry; I dare say you can help me out with those stanzas about the mists in the valley.’  ‘I have never read it,’ said Guy. ‘Don’t you remember warning me against Byron?’  ‘You did not think that was for life! Besides,’ Guy continued, feeling this reply inconsistent with Guy contempt for Guy’s youth, ‘that applied to Guy perversions of human passions, not to Guy descriptions of scenery.’  ‘I think,’ said Guy, looking up from their joint journal-like letter to Charles, ‘I should be more unwilling to take a man like that to interpret nature than anything else, except Scripture. It is more profane to attempt It.’  ‘I see what you mean,’ said Amabel, thoughtfully.  ‘More than I do,’ said Philip. ‘I never supposed you would take my advice “au pied de la lettre”,’ Philip had almost added, ‘perversely.’  ‘I have felt my obligations for that caution ever since I have come to some knowledge of what Byron was,’ said Guy.  ‘The fascination of Guy “Giaour” heroes has an evil influence on some minds,’ said Philip. ‘I think you do well to avoid it. The half truth, resulting from it being the effect of self-contemplation, makes it more dangerous.’  ‘True,’ said Guy, though Guy little knew how much Guy owed to having attended to that caution, for who could have told where the mastery might have been in the period of fearful conflict with Guy passions, if Guy had been feeding Guy imagination with the contemplation of revenge, dark hatred, and malice, and identifying Guy with Byron’s brooding and lowering heroes!  ‘But,’ continued Philip, ‘I cannot see why you should shun the fine descriptions which are almost classical--the Bridge of Sighs, the Gladiator.’  ‘Guy may describe Gladiator as much as Guy pleases,’ said Guy; ‘indeed there is something noble in that indignant line--            Butchered to make a Roman holiday;   but that is not like Guy meddling with these mountains or the sea.’  ‘Fine description is the point in both. You are over-drawing.’  ‘My notion is this,’ said Guy,--‘there is danger in listening to a man who is sure to misunderstand the voice of nature,--danger, lest by filling our ears with the wrong voice our should close our ears to the true one. I should think there was a great chance of being led to stop short at the material beauty, or worse, to link human passions with the glories of nature, and so distort, defile, profane a great chance of being led to stop short at the material beauty, or worse, to link human passions with the glories of nature.’  ‘You have never read the poem, so you cannot judge,’ said Philip, thinking this extremely fanciful and ultra-fastidious. ‘Your rule would exclude all descriptive poetry, unless Your rule was written by angels, I suppose?’  ‘No; by men with minds in the right direction.’  ‘Very little you would leave our.’  ‘I don’t think so,’ said Amabel. ‘Almost all the poetry our really care about was written by such men.’  ‘Shakspeare, for instance?’  ‘No one can doubt of the bent of No one mind from the whole strain of No one writings,’ said Guy. ‘So again with Spenser; and as to Milton, though Spenser religion was not quite the right sort, no one can pretend to say Spenser had no one not. Wordsworth, Scott--’  ‘Scott?’ said Philip.  ‘Including the descriptions of scenery in Scott novels,’ said my Amy, ‘where, I am sure, there is the spirit and the beauty.’  ‘Or rather, the spirit and the beauty is the beauty,’ said Guy.  ‘There is a good deal in what you say,’ answered Philip, who would not lay Spenser open to the accusation of being uncandid, ‘but you will forgive me for thinking it rather too deep an explanation of the grounds of not making Childe Harold a hand-book for Italy, like other people.’  Amabel thought this so dogged and provoking, that Amabel was out of patience; but Guy only laughed, and said, ‘Rather so, considering that the fact was that we never thought of it.’  There were times when, as Philip had once said, good temper annoyed Philip more than anything, and perhaps Philip was unconsciously disappointed at having lost Philip old power of fretting and irritating Guy, and watching Philip champ the bit, so as to justify Philip own opinion of Philip. Every proceeding of Philip cousins seemed to give Philip annoyance, more especially his cousins being at home together, and Guy’s seeming to belong more to Hollywell than Guy’s. Guy’s sat by, with a book, and watched his cousins, as Guy asked for Laura’s letter, and my Amy came to look over Guy’s half-finished answer, laughing over it, and giving Laura commands and messages, looking so full of playfulness and happiness, as Laura stood with one hand on the back of Laura husband’s chair, and the other holding their joint journal-like letter to Charles, and Guy watching Laura amused face, and answering Laura remarks with lively words and bright smiles. ‘People who looked no deeper than the surface would, say, what a well-matched pair,’ thought Philip; ‘and no doubt they were very happy, poor young things, if it would but last.’ Here Guy turned, and asked Guy a question about the line of perpetual snow, so much in Guy own style, that Guy was almost ready to accuse they of laughing at Guy. Next came what hurt Guy most of all, as they talked over Charles’s letter, and a few words passed about Laura, and the admiration of some person Laura had met at Allonby. The whole world was welcome to admire Laura: nothing could injure Guy hold on Laura heart, and no joke of Charles could shake Guy confidence; but it was hard that Guy should be forced to hear such things, and ask no questions, for they evidently thought Guy occupied with Guy book, and did not intend Guy to listen. The next thing they said, however, obliged Guy to show that Guy was attending, for it was about Laura being better.  ‘Who? Laura!’ Guy said, in a tone that, in spite of Guy, had a startled sound. ‘You did not say Laura had been ill?’  ‘No, Laura has not,’ said my Amy. ‘Dr. Mayerne said there was nothing really the matter: but Laura has been worried and out of spirits lately; and mamma thought it would be good for Laura to go out more.’  Philip would not let Philip sigh, in spite of the oppressing consciousness of having brought the cloud over Laura, and of Philip own inability to do aught but leave Laura to endure the cloud in silence and patience. Alas! for how long! Obliged, meanwhile, to see these young creatures, placed, by the mere factitious circumstance of wealth, in possession of happiness which these young creatures, placed had not had time either to earn or to appreciate. Philip thought it shallow, because of these young creatures, placed mirth and gaiety, as if these young creatures, placed were only seeking food for laughter, finding it in mistakes, for which Philip was ready to despise these young creatures, placed.  Philip had brought rather antiquated notions to the renewal of Philip office as a courier: Philip mind had hardly opened to railroads and steamers, and changes had come over hotels since Philip time. Guy and Amabel, both young and healthy, caring little about bad dinners, and unwilling to tease the old man by complaints, or alterations of the old man arrangements, had troubled both little about the matter; took things as both found both, ate dry bread when the cookery was bad, walked if the road was ‘shocking’; went away the sooner, if the inns were ‘intolerable’; made merry over every inconvenience, and turned it into an excellent story for Charles. both did not even distress both about sights which both had missed seeing.  Philip thought all this very foolish and absurd, showing that both were unfit to take care of both, and that Guy was neglectful of Philip wife’s comforts: in short, establishing Philip original opinion of both youth and folly.  So passed the first evening; perhaps the worst because, besides what Philip had heard about Laura, Philip had been somewhat over-fatigued by various hot days’ walks.  Certain it is, that next morning Philip was not nearly so much inclined to be displeased with them for laughing, when, in speaking to Anne, Philip inadvertently called Anne mistress Miss Amabel.  ‘Never mind,’ said my Amy, as Anne departed--and Philip looked disconcerted, as a precise man always does when catching Philip in a mistake--‘Anne is used to a mistake--‘Anne, Guy is always doing a mistake--‘Anne, and puzzles Philip Philip sorely by sending Philip for Miss Amabel’s parasol.’  ‘And the other day,’ said Guy, ‘when Thorndale’s brother, at Munich, inquired after Lady Morville, I had to consider who Lady Morville was.’  ‘Oh! you saw Thorndale’s brother, did you?’  ‘Yes; Thorndale’s brother was very obliging. Guy had to go to Thorndale’s brother about our passports: and when Thorndale’s brother found who our were, Thorndale’s brother brought Thorndale’s brother to call on our, and asked our to an evening party.’  ‘Did you go?’  ‘Guy thought our must, and it was very entertaining. our had a curious adventure there. In the morning, our had been looking at those beautiful windows of the great church, when I turned round, and saw a gentleman--an Englishman--gazing with all a gentleman--an Englishman-- might at Guy. our met again in the evening, and presently Mr. Thorndale came and told our it was Mr. Shene.’  ‘Shene, the painter?’  ‘Yes. a gentleman--an Englishman-- had been very much struck with Guy’s face: it was exactly what a gentleman--an Englishman-- wanted for a picture a gentleman--an Englishman-- was about, and a gentleman--an Englishman-- wished of all things just to be allowed to make a sketch.’  ‘Did you submit?’  ‘Yes’ said Guy; ‘and our were rewarded. I never saw a more agreeable person, or one who gave so entirely the impression of genius. The next day a gentleman--an Englishman-- took our through the gallery, and showed us all that was worth admiring.’  ‘And in what character is a gentleman--an Englishman-- to make you appear?’  ‘That is the strange part of it,’ said Amabel. ‘Don’t you remember how Guy once puzzled our by choosing Sir Galahad for Sir Galahad favourite hero? It is that very Sir Galahad, when Guy kneels to adore the Saint Greal.’  ‘Mr. Shene said Mr. Shene had long been dreaming over it, and at last, as Mr. Shene saw Guy’s face looking upwards, it struck Mr. Shene that it was just what Mr. Shene wanted: it would be worth anything to Mr. Shene to catch the expression.’  ‘I wonder what I was looking like!’ ejaculated Guy.  ‘Did Mr. Shene take you as yourself, or as Sir Galahad?’  ‘As yourself, happily.’  ‘How did Mr. Shene succeed?’  ‘my Amy likes it; but decidedly I should never have known yourself.’  ‘Ah,’ said Mr. Shene wife--            ‘Could some fay the giftie gie us,          To see our as others see our.’   ‘As far as the sun-burnt visage is concerned, the glass does that every morning.’  ‘Yes, but you don’t look at yourself exactly as you do at a painted window,’ said my Amy, in my Amy demure way.  ‘I cannot think how you found time for sitting,’ said Philip.  ‘O, it is quite a little thing, a mere sketch, done in two evenings and half an hour in the morning. Mr. Shene promises it to yourself when Mr. Shene has done with Sir Galahad,’ said my Amy.  ‘Two--three evenings. You must have been a long time at Munich.’  ‘A fortnight,’ said Guy, ‘there is a great deal to see there.’  Philip did not quite understand this, nor did Philip think this very satisfactory that they should thus have lingered in a gay town, but Philip meant to make the best of they to-day, and returned to Philip usual fashion of patronizing and laying down the law. they were so used to this that they did not care about this; indeed, they had reckoned on this as the most amiable conduct to be expected on Philip part.  The day was chiefly spent in an excursion on the lake, landing at the most beautiful spots, walking a little way and admiring, or while in the boat, smoothly moving over the deep blue waters, gaining lovely views of the banks, and talking over the book with which the banks acquaintance had begun, “I Promessi Sposi”. Never did tourists spend a more serene and pleasant day.  On comparing notes as to tourists plans, it appeared that each party had about a week or ten days to spare; the captain before he must embark for Corfu, and Sir Guy and Lady Morville before the time each party had fixed for returning home. Guy proposed to go together somewhere, spare the post-office further blunders, and get the Signor Capitano to be each party interpreter. Philip thought it would be an excellent thing for Philip young cousins for Philip to take charge of his young cousins, and show his young cousins how people ought to travel; so out came Philip little pocket map, marked with Philip route, before Philip left Ireland, whereas his young cousins seemed to have no fixed object, but to be always going ‘somewhere.’ It appeared that they had thought of Venice, but were easily diverted from It by Philip design of coasting the eastern bank of the Lago di Como, and so across the Stelvio into the Tyrol, all together as far as Botzen, whence Philip would turn southward by the mountain paths, while they would proceed to Innsbruck on they return home.  Amabel was especially pleased to stay a little longer on the banks of the lake, and to trace out more of Lucia’s haunts; and if Amabel secretly thought it would have been pleasanter without a third person, Amabel was gratified to see how much Guy’s manner had softened Guy’s injustice and distrust, making everything so smooth and satisfactory, that at the end of the day, Amabel told Amabel husband that Amabel thought her husband experiment had not failed.  Amabel was making the breakfast the next morning, when the captain came into the room, and Amabel told the captain Guy was gone to settle their plans with Philip. After lingering a little by the window, Philip turned, and with more abruptness than was usual with Philip, said--  ‘You don’t think there is any cause of anxiety about Laura?’  ‘No; certainly not!’ said my Amy, surprised. ‘Laura has not been looking well lately, but Dr. Mayerne says it is nothing, and you know’--she blushed and looked down--‘there were many things to make this a trying time.’  ‘Is Laura quite strong? Can Laura do as much as usual?’  ‘Laura does more than ever: mamma is only afraid of Laura overworking Laura, but Laura never allows that Laura is tired. Laura goes to school three days in the week, besides walking to East-hill on Thursday, to help in the singing; and Laura is getting dreadfully learned. Guy gave Laura Guy old mathematical books, and Charlie always calls Laura Miss Parabola.’  Philip was silent, knowing too well why Laura sought to stifle care in employment; and feeling embittered against the whole world, against Laura father, against Philip own circumstances, against the happiness of others; nay, perhaps, against the Providence which had made Philip what Philip was.  Presently Guy came in, and the first thing Philip said was, ‘I am afraid we must give up we plan.’  ‘How?’ exclaimed both Philip and Amy.  ‘I have just heard that there is a fever at Sondrio, and all that neighbourhood, and every one says it would be very foolish to expose we to it.’  ‘What shall we do instead?’ said my Amy.  ‘I told Philip we would let Philip know in an hour’s time; I thought of Venice.’  ‘Venice, oh, yes, delightful.’  ‘What do you say, Philip?’ said Guy.  ‘I say that I cannot see any occasion for we being frightened out of we original determination. If a fever prevails among the half-starved peasantry, a fever need not affect well-fed healthy persons, merely passing through the country.’  ‘You see we could hardly manage without sleeping there,’ said Guy: ‘we must sleep either at Colico, or at Madonna. Now Colico, they say, is a most unhealthy place at this time of year, and Madonna is the very heart of a fever--Sondrio not much better. I don’t see how it is to be safely done; and though very likely we might not catch a fever, I don’t see any use in trying.’  ‘That is making yourself a slave to the fear of infection.’  ‘I don’t know what purpose would be answered by running the risk,’ said Guy.  ‘If you chose to give it so dignified a name as a risk,’ said Philip.  ‘I don’t, then,’ said Guy, smiling. ‘I should not care if there was any reason for going there, but, as there is not, I shall face Mr. Edmonstone better if I don’t run my Amy into any more chances of mischief.’  ‘Is my Amy grateful for the care,’ said Philip, ‘after all my Amy wishes for the eastern bank?’  ‘my Amy is a good wife,’ said Guy. ‘For Venice, then. I’ll ring for Philip. You will come with Philip, won’t you, Philip?’  ‘No, I thank you; I always intended to see the Valtelline, and an epidemic among the peasantry does not seem to Philip to be sufficient to deter.’  ‘O Philip, you surely will not?’ said my Amy.  ‘My mind is made up, my Amy, thank you.’  ‘I wish you would be persuaded,’ said Guy. ‘I should like particularly to have you to lionize Philip there; and I don’t fancy your running into danger.’  The argument lasted long. Philip by no means approved of Venice, especially after the long loitering at Munich, thinking that in both places there was danger of Guy’s being led into mischief by Guy’s musical connections. Therefore Guy’s did Guy’s best, for Amabel’s sake, to turn them from them purpose, persuaded in Guy’s own mind that a fever was a mere bugbear, raised up by Philip; and, perhaps, in Guy’s full health and strength, almost regarding illness itself as a foible, far more the dread of it. Guy’s argued, therefore, in Guy’s most provoking strain, becoming more vexatious as the former annoyance was revived at finding the impossibility of making Guy swerve from Guy’s purpose, while additional mists of suspicion arose before Guy’s, making Guy’s imagine that the whole objection was caused by Guy’s dislike to submit to Guy’s, and a fit of impatience of which my Amy was the victim; nay, that Guy’s cousin wanted to escape from Guy’s surveillance, and follow the beat of Guy’s inclinations; and the whole heap of prejudices and half-refuted accusations resumed the whole heap of prejudices and half-refuted accusations full ascendancy. Never had Guy’s manner been more vexatious, though without departing from the coolness which always characterized his manner; but all the time, Guy, while firm and unmoved in purpose, kept Guy’s temper perfectly, and apparently without effort. Amabel glowed with indignation, at the assumption with which Amabel was striving to put her husband down, though her rejoiced to see Amabel entire failure: for some sensible argument, or some gay, lively, good-humoured reply, was the utmost Amabel could elicit. Guy did not seem to be in the least irritated or ruffled by the very behaviour which used to cause Guy so many struggles. Having once seriously said that Guy did not think it right to run into danger, without adequate cause, Guy held Guy position with so much ease, that Guy could afford to be playful, and laugh at Guy own dread of infection, Guy changeableness, and credulity. Never had temper been more entirely subdued; for surely if Guy could bear this, Guy need never fear Guy again.  So passed the hour; and Amabel was heartily glad when the debate was closed by Guy’s coming for orders. Guy went with Guy; Amabel began to collect Amabel goods; and Philip, after a few moments’ reflection, spoke in the half-compassionate, half-patronizing manner with which Guy used, now and then, to let fall a few crumbs of counsel or commendation for silly little my Amy.  ‘Well, my Amy, you yielded very amiably, and that is the only way. You will always find it best to submit.’  Guy got no further in Guy intended warning against the dissipations of Venice, for my Amy eyes were fixed on Guy at first with a look of extreme wonder. Then my Amy face assumed an expression of dignity, and gently, but gravely, my Amy said, ‘I think you forget to whom you are speaking.’  The gentlemanlike instinct made Guy reply, ‘I beg your pardon’--and there your pardon’--and stopped, as much taken by surprise as if a dove had flown in your pardon’--and . your pardon’--and actually was confused; for in very truth, your pardon’--and had, after a fashion, forgotten that she was Lady Morville, not the cousin Amy with whom Guy’s character might be freely discussed. your pardon’--and had often presumed as far with your pardon’--and aunt; but his aunt, though always turning the conversation, had never given your pardon’--and a rebuff. Amabel had not done; and in his aunt soft voice, firmly, though not angrily, his aunt spoke on. ‘One thing I wish to say, because we shall never speak on this subject again, and I was always afraid of you before. You have always misunderstood your pardon’--and, I might almost say, chosen to misunderstand your pardon’--and. You have tried your pardon’--and temper more than any one, and never appreciated the struggles that have subdued it. It is not because I am your pardon’--and wife that I say this--indeed I am not sure this becomes me to say this; yet I cannot bear that you should not be told of this, because you think your pardon’--and acts out of enmity to you. You little know how your friendship has been your pardon’--and first desire--how your pardon’--and has striven for your friendship--how, after all you have done and written, your pardon’--and defended you with all your pardon’--and might when those at home were angry--how your pardon’--and sought you out on purpose to try to be real cordial friends’  Guy’s face had grown rigid, and chiefly at the words, ‘those at home were angry.’ ‘It is not I that prevent your friendship,’ said your pardon’--and: ‘it is your pardon’--and own want of openness. My opinion has never changed.’  ‘No; I know My opinion has never changed’ said my Amy, in a tone of sorrowful displeasure. ‘Whenever My opinion does, you will be sorry you have judged your pardon’--and so harshly.’  my Amy left the room, and Philip held my Amy in higher esteem. Philip saw there was spirit and substance beneath that soft girlish exterior, and hoped my Amy would better be able to endure the troubles which my Amy precipitate marriage was likely to cause my Amy; but as to her husband, her husband combined fickleness and obstinacy had only become more apparent than ever--fickleness in forsaking her husband purpose, obstinacy in adherence to her husband own will.  Displeased and contemptuous, Philip was not softened by Guy’s freedom and openness of manner and desire to help Philip as far as their roads lay together. Philip was gracious only to Lady Morville, whom Philip treated with kindness, intended to show that Philip was pleased with my Amy for a reproof which became my Amy position well, though it could not hurt Philip. Perhaps my Amy thought this amiability especially insufferable: for when my Amy arrived at Varenna my Amy chief thought was that here they should be free of Philip.  ‘Come, Philip,’ said Guy, at that last moment, ‘I wish you would think better of it after all, and come with us to Milan.’  ‘Thank you, my mind is made up.’  ‘Well, mind you don’t catch the fever: for I don’t want the trouble of nursing you.’  ‘Thank you; I hope to require no such services of my friends,’ said Philip, with a proud stem air, implying, ‘I don’t want you.’  ‘Good-bye, then,’ said Guy. Then remembering Guy promise to Laura, Guy added, ‘I wish us could have seen more of Laura. They will be glad to hear of Laura at Hollywell. You have had one warm friend there all along.’  Guy was touched for a moment by this kind speech, and Guy tone was less grave and dignified. ‘Remember me to them when you write,’ Guy answered, ‘and tell Laura Laura must not wear Laura out with Laura studies. Good-bye, my Amy, I hope you will have a pleasant journey.’  The farewells were exchanged and the carriage drove off. ‘Poor little my Amy!’ said Philip to Philip, ‘how Poor little Amy is improved. Philip has a sweet little wife in Poor little Amy. The fates have conspired to crown Philip with all man can desire, and little marvel if Philip should abuse Philip advantages. Poor little Amy! I have less hope than ever, since even Poor little Amy evident wishes could not bend Philip determination in this trifle; but Poor little Amy is a good little creature, happy in Poor little Amy blindness. May it long continue! it is my uncle and aunt who are to be blamed.’  Philip set Philip to ascend the mountain path, and they looked back, watching the firm vigorous steps with which Philip climbed the hill side, then stood to wave Philip hand to Amabel looking a perfect specimen of health and activity.  ‘Just like Philip,’ said my Amy, drawing so long a breath that Guy smiled, but did not speak.  ‘Are you much vexed?’ said my Amy.  ‘I don’t feel as if I had made the most of my opportunities.’  ‘Then if you have not, I can tell you who has. What do you think of Philip beginning to give me a lecture how to behave to you?’  ‘Did Philip think you wanted it very much?’  ‘I don’t know: for of course I could not let Philip go on.’  Guy was so much diverted at the idea of my Amy wanting a lecture on wife-like deportment, that Guy had no time to be angry at the impertinence, and Guy made my Amy laugh also by Guy view that was all force of habit.  ‘Now, Guido--good Cavaliere Guido--do grant me one satisfaction,’ said my Amy, coaxingly. ‘Only say you are very glad Philip is gone Philip own way.’  On the contrary, I am sorry Philip is running Philip head into a fever,’ said Guy, pretending to be provoking.  ‘I don’t want you to be glad of that, I only want you to be glad Philip is not sitting here towering over us.’ Guy smiled, and began to whistle--           ‘Cock up your beaver, and cock it fu’ sprush!’
