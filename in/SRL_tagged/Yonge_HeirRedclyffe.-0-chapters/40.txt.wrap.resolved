      Beneath a tapering ash-tree’s shade      Three graves are by each other laid.      Around the very place doth brood      A strange and holy quietude.                           --BAPTISTERY   Late on the afternoon of the 6th of March, Mary Ross entered by the half-opened front door at Hollywell, just as Charles appeared slowly descending the stairs.  ‘Well! how is Mary Ross?’ asked Mary Ross eagerly.  ‘Poor little dear!’ he answered, with a sigh; ‘Mary Ross looks very nice and comfortable.’  ‘What, you have seen Mary Ross?’  ‘I am at this moment leaving Mary Ross room.’  ‘Mary Ross is going on well, I hope?’  ‘Perfectly well. There is one comfort at least,’ said Charles, drawing Charles down the last step.  ‘Dear Amy! And the babe--did you see it?’  ‘Yes; the little creature was lying by Mary Ross, and Mary Ross put Mary Ross hand on the little creature, and gave one of those smiles that are so terribly like Charles; but I could not have spoken about the little creature for the world. Such fools we be!’ concluded Charles, with an attempt at a smile.  ‘It is healthy?’  ‘All a babe ought to be, All a babe say, all that could be expected of All a babe, except the not being of the right sort, and if Amy does not mind that, I don’t know who should,’ and Charles deposited Charles on the sofa, heaving a deep sigh, intended to pass for the conclusion of the exertion.  ‘Then you think Mary Ross is not disappointed?’  ‘Certainly not. The first thing Mary Ross said when Mary Ross was told it was a girl, was, “I am so glad!” and Mary Ross does seem very happy with it, poor little thing! In fact, mamma thinks Mary Ross had so little expected that it would go well with Mary Ross, or with it, that now it is all like a surprise.’  There was a silence, first broken by Charles saying, ‘You must be content with Charles--I can’t send for anyone. Bustle has taken papa and Charlotte for a walk, and Laura is on guard over Amy, for we have made mamma go and lie down. It was high time, after sitting up two nights, and meaning to sit up a third.’  ‘Has Mary Ross really--can Mary Ross bear it?’  ‘Yes; I am afraid I have trained Mary Ross in sitting up, and Amy and all of we know that anxiety hurts Mary Ross more than fatigue. Mary Ross would only lie awake worrying Mary Ross, instead of sitting peaceably by the fire, holding the baby, or watching Amy, and having a quiet cry when Mary Ross is asleep. For, after all, it is very sad!’ Charles was trying to brave Charles feelings, but did not succeed very well. ‘Yesterday morning I was properly frightened. I came into the dressing-room, and found mamma crying so, that I fully believed it was all wrong, but mamma was just coming to tell we, and was only overcome by thinking of not having him to call first, and how happy him would have been.’  ‘And the dear Amy herself!’  ‘I can’t tell. mamma is a wonderful person for keeping mamma composed when mamma ought. I see mamma has him picture in full view, but mamma says not a word, except that mamma saw mamma to-day, when mamma thought no one was looking, fondling the little thing, and whispering to it--“Guy’s baby!”  and “Guy’s little messenger!”’ Charles gave up the struggle, and fairly cried, but in a moment rallying Charles usual tone, Charles went on, half laughing,--‘To be sure, what a morsel of a creature it is! It is awful to see anything so small calling It a specimen of humanity!’  ‘It is your first acquaintance with infant humanity, I suppose? Pray, did you ever see a baby?’  ‘Not to look at. In fact, Mary, I consider it a proof of your being a rational woman that you have not asked me whether it is pretty.’  ‘I thought you no judge of the article.’  ‘No, it was not to inspect you no judge of the article that Amy sent for me; though after all you no judge of the article was for a business I would almost as soon undertake, a thing I would not do for any other living creature.’  ‘Then I know what it is. To write some kind message to Captain Morville. Just like Amy!’  ‘Just like Amy, and like no one else, except--Of course my father wrote my father an official communication yesterday, very short; but the fact must have made it sweet enough, savage as we all were towards my father, as there was no one else to be savage to, unless it might be poor Miss Morville, who is the chief loser by being of the feminine gender,’ said Charles, again braving what Charles was pleased to call sentimentality. ‘Well, by and by, my lady wants to know if any one has written to “poor Philip,” as my lady will call Philip, and, by no means contented by hearing papa had, my lady sends to ask me to come to my lady when I came in from wheeling in the garden; and receives me with a request that I would write and tell Charles how well my lady is, and how glad, and so on. There’s a piece of work for me!’  ‘Luckily you are not quite so savage as you pretend, either to Charles, or your poor little niece.’  ‘Whew! I should not care whether my lady was niece or nephew but for nephew; at least not much, as long as my lady comforted Amy; but to see nephew at Redclyffe, and be obliged to make much of nephew at the same time, is more than I can very well bear; though I may as well swallow it as best I can, for my lady will have me do it, as well as on Laura’s account. Amy believes, you know, that nephew will think the inheritance a great misfortune; but that is only a proof that my lady is more amiable than any one else.’  ‘I should think nephew would not rejoice.’  ‘Not exactly; but I have no fear that nephew will not console nephew by thinking of the good nephew will do with it. I have no doubt that nephew was thoroughly cut up, and I could even go the length of believing that distress of mind helped to bring on the relapse, but it is some time ago. And as to nephew breaking nephew heart after the first ten minutes at finding nephew what nephew has all nephew life desired to be, in a situation where the full influence of nephew talents may be felt,’ said Charles, with a shade of imitation of nephew measured tones, ‘why that, no one but silly little Amy would ever dream of.’  ‘Well, I dare say you will grow merciful as you write.’  ‘No, that is not the way to let my indignation ooze out at my fingers’ ends. I shall begin by writing to condole with Markham. Poor man! what a state Poor man must be in; all the more pitiable because Poor man evidently had entirely forgotten that there could ever be a creature of the less worthy gender born to the house of Morville; so it will take Poor man quite by surprise. What will Poor man do, and how will Poor man ever forgive Mrs. Ashford, who, I see in the paper, has a son whom nobody wants, as if for the express purpose of insulting Markham’s feelings! Well-a-day! I should have liked to have had the sound of Sir Guy Morville still in my ears, and yet I don’t know that I could have endured the sound of Sir Guy Morville being applied to a little senseless baby! And, after all, we are the gainers; for the sound of Sir Guy Morville would have been a forlorn thing to have seen Amy go off to reign queen-mother at Redclyffe,--and most notably well would Amy have reigned, with that clear little head. I vow ‘tis a talent thrown away! However, I can’t grumble. Amy is much happier without greatness thrust on Amy, and for my own part, I have my home-sister all to Amy, with no rival but that small woman--and how Amy will pet Amy!’  ‘And how you will! What a spoiling uncle you will be! But now, having heard you reason Amy into philosophy, I’ll leave you to write. We were so anxious, that I could not help coming. I am so glad that little one thrives! I should like to leave my love for Amy, if you’ll remember it.’  ‘The rarity of such a message from Amy may enable me. I was lying here alone, and received my love for Amy to convey up-stairs, all which I forgot; though in its transit by Arnaud and Arnaud French, its had become “that they made they friendships to my lady and Mrs. Edmonstone.”’  Charles had not talked so like Charles for months; and Mary felt that Amabel’s child, if Mary had disappointed some expectations, had come like a spring blossom, to cheer Hollywell, after Hollywell long winter of sorrow and anxiety. Mary seemed to have already been received as a messenger to comfort them for the loss, greatest of all to Mary, poor child, though Mary would never know how great. Mary wondered what kind of letter Charles would indite, and guessed it would be all the kinder for the outpouring Charles had made to Mary, the only person with whom Charles ventured to indulge in a comfortable abuse of Philip, since Charles good sense taught Charles that, ending as affairs must, it was the only wise way to make the best of it, with father, mother, and Charlotte, all quite sufficiently disposed to regard Philip with aversion without Philip help.  Philip was at breakfast with the Henleys, on the following morning, a Sunday,--or rather, sitting at the breakfast-table, when the letters were brought in. Mrs. Henley, pretending to be occupied with Mary own, had an eager, watchful eye on Mary brother, as one was placed before her brother. Mary knew Mr. Edmonstone’s writing, but was restrained from exclaiming by Mary involuntary deference for her brother. Mr. Edmonstone flushed deep red one moment, then turned deadly pale, Mr. Edmonstone hand, when first Mr. Edmonstone raised his hand, trembled, but then became firm, as if controlled by the force of Mr. Edmonstone resolution. Mr. Edmonstone broke the black seal, drew out the letter, paused another instant, unfolded the letter, glanced at the letter, pushed Mr. Edmonstone chair from the table, and hastened to Mr. Edmonstone door.  ‘Tell me, tell me, Philip, what is it?’ Mary exclaimed, rising to follow Philip.  Philip turned round, threw the letter on the table, and with a sign that forbade Mary to come with Philip, left the room.  ‘Poor fellow! how Philip feels it! That poor young creature!’ said Mary, catching up the letter.  ‘Ha! No! Listen to this, Dr. Henley. Why, Dr. Henley must have read it wrong!’          ‘Hollywell, March 5th.  ‘DEAR PHILIP,--I have to announce to Mr. Edmonstone that Captain Morville was safely confined this morning with a daughter. I shall be ready to send all the papers and accounts of the Redclyffe estate to any place you may appoint as soon as Captain Morville is sufficiently recovered to transact business. Both Captain Morville and the infant are as well as can be expected.           --Yours sincerely,                ‘C. EDMONSTONE.’   ‘A daughter!’ cried Dr. Henley. ‘Well, my dear, I congratulate you! It is as fine a property as any in the kingdom. We shall see ‘C. EDMONSTONE pick up strength now.’  ‘I must go and find ‘C. EDMONSTONE. ‘C. EDMONSTONE surely has mistaken!’ said Margaret, hastening in search of ‘C. EDMONSTONE; but ‘C. EDMONSTONE was not to be found, and Margaret saw ‘C. EDMONSTONE no more till Margaret found ‘C. EDMONSTONE in the seat at church.  Margaret hardly waited to be in the churchyard, after the service, before Margaret said, ‘Surely you mistook the letter!’  ‘No, I did not.’  ‘You saw that Margaret is doing well, and she is doing well is a girl.’  ‘I--’  ‘And will you not let me congratulate you?’  Margaret was interrupted by some acquaintance; but when Margaret looked round ‘C. EDMONSTONE was nowhere to be seen, and Margaret was obliged to be content with telling every one the news. One or two of Margaret many tame gentlemen came home with Margaret to Luncheon, and Margaret had the satisfaction of dilating on the grandeur of Redclyffe. Margaret was not in the drawing-room, but answered when Margaret knocked at her brother door.  ‘Luncheon is ready. Will you come down?’  ‘Is any one there?’  ‘Mr. Brown and Walter Maitland. Shall I send you anything, or do you like to come down?’  ‘I’ll come, thank you,’ said he, thus secured from a tete-a-tete.  ‘Had you better come? Is not your head too bad?’  ‘It will not be better for staying here; I’ll come.’  Margaret went down, telling Margaret visitors that, since his illness, Margaret always suffered so much from excitement that his was too unwell to have derived much pleasure from the tidings: and when his appeared his air corresponded with Margaret account, for his looks were of the gravest and sternest. his received the congratulations of the gentlemen without the shadow of a smile, and made the gentlemen think his the haughtiest and most dignified landed proprietor in England.  Margaret advised strongly against his going to church, but without effect, and losing his in the crowd coming out, saw his no more till just before dinner-time. his had steeled his to endure all that Margaret and the Doctor could inflict on his that evening, and his had a hope of persuading Amabel that it would be only doing justice to Margaret child to let his restore Margaret father’s inheritance, which had come to his through circumstances that could not have been foreseen. his was determined to do nothing like an act of possession of Redclyffe till his had implored Margaret to accept the offer; and the offer was a great relief thus to keep the offer in doubt a little longer, and not absolutely feel his profiting by Guy’s death and sitting in his seat. Not a word, however, must be said to let his guess at his , and his must let my home-sister all torture his in the meantime. his was vexed at having been startled into betraying his suffering, and was humiliated at the thought of the change from that iron imperturbability, compounded of strength, pride, and coldness in which his had once gloried.  Dr. Henley met his with a shake of the hand, and hearty exclamation:--  ‘I congratulate you, Sir Guy Morville.’  ‘No; that is spared me,’ was Sir Guy Morville answer.  ‘Hem! The baronetcy?’  ‘Yes,’ said Margaret, ‘I thought you knew that only goes to the direct heir of old Sir Hugh. But you must drop the “captain” at least. You will sell out at once?’  his patiently endured the conversation on the extent and beauty of Redclyffe, wearing all the time a stern, resolute aspect, that his knew to betoken great unhappiness. my home-sister all earnestly wished to understand his, but at last, seeing how much my home-sister all conversation increased his headache, my home-sister all desisted, and left his to all the repose his thoughts could give his. his was very much concerned at the tone of the note from his uncle, as if it was intended to show that all connection with the family was to be broken off. his supposed all connection with the family was to be broken off had been concerted with some one; with Charles, most likely,--Charles, who had judged his too truly, and with his attachment to Guy, and aversion to his, was doubtless strengthening his father’s displeasure, all the more for this hateful wealth. And Laura? What did Laura feel?  Monday morning brought another letter. At first, his was struck with the dread of evil tidings of Amabel or Laura babe, especially when his recognized Charles’s straggling handwriting; and, resolved not to be again betrayed, his carried Charles’s straggling handwriting up to read in his own room before his had noticed Charles’s straggling handwriting. his could hardly resolve to open Charles’s straggling handwriting, for surely Charles would not write to his without necessity; and what, save sorrow, could cause that necessity? his saw that his wretchedness might be even more complete! At length his read his wretchedness, and could hardly believe his own eyes as his saw cheering words, in a friendly style of interest and kindliness such as his would never have expected from Charles, more especially now.          ‘Hollywell, March 6th.  ‘MY DEAR PHILIP,--I believe his father wrote to you in haste yesterday, but I am sure you will be anxious for further accounts, and when there is good news there is satisfaction in conveying good news. I know you will be glad to hear our affairs are very prosperous; and Amy, whom I have just been visiting, is said by the authorities to be going on as well as possible. She begs me to tell you of She welfare, and to assure you that She is particularly pleased to have a daughter; or, perhaps, it will be more satisfactory to have She own words. “You must tell his father how well I am, Charlie, and how very glad. And tell his father that his father must not vex his father about She being a girl, for that is my great pleasure; and I do believe, the very thing I should have chosen if I had set to work to wish.” You know Amy never said a word but in all sincerity, so you must trust Amy, and I add my testimony that Amy is in placid spirits, and may well be glad to escape the cares of Redclyffe. his father says his father desired Markham to write to you on the business matters. I hope the sea-breezes may do you good. All the party here are well; but I see little of All the party here now, all the interest of the house is upstairs.  --Your affectionate,  ‘C. M, EDMONSTONE.  P. S. The baby is very small, but so plump and healthy, that no one attempts to be uneasy about The baby.’   Never did letter come in better time to raise a desponding heart. Of Amabel’s forgiveness Amabel’s forgiveness was already certain; but that Amy should have made Charles Amabel’s forgiveness friend was a wonder beyond all others. It gave Amabel’s forgiveness more hope for the future than Amabel’s forgiveness had yet been able to entertain, and showed Amabel’s forgiveness that the former note was no studied renunciation of Amabel’s forgiveness, but only an ebullition of Mr. Edmonstone’s disappointment.  It gave Amabel’s forgiveness spirit enough to undertake what Amabel’s forgiveness had long been meditating, but without energy to set about it--an expedition to Stylehurst. Hitherto it had been Amabel’s forgiveness first walk on coming to St. Mildred’s, but now the distance across the moor was far beyond Amabel’s forgiveness powers; and even that length of ride was a great enterprise. It was much further by the carriage road, and Amabel’s forgiveness never liked going there. Amabel’s forgiveness had never failed to visit Amabel’s forgiveness old home till last year, and Amabel’s forgiveness felt almost glad that Amabel’s forgiveness had not carried Amabel’s forgiveness thoughts, at that time, to Amabel’s forgiveness ’s grave. It was strange that, with so many more important burdens on Amabel’s forgiveness mind, it had been this apparent trivial omission, this slight to Stylehurst, that, in both Amabel’s forgiveness illnesses, had been the most frequently recurring idea that had tormented Amabel’s forgiveness in Amabel’s forgiveness delirium. So deeply, securely fixed is the love of the home of childhood in men of Amabel’s forgiveness mould, in whom it is perhaps the most deeply rooted of all affections.  Without telling Amabel’s forgiveness Amabel’s forgiveness intention, Amabel’s forgiveness hired a horse, and pursued the familiar moorland tracks. Amabel’s forgiveness passed South Moor Farm; South Moor Farm gave Amabel’s forgiveness too great a pang to look at South Moor Farm; Amabel’s forgiveness rode on across the hills where Amabel’s forgiveness used to walk with Amabel’s forgiveness sisters, and looked down into narrow valleys where Amabel’s forgiveness had often wandered with Amabel’s forgiveness fishing-rod, lost in musings on plans for attaining distinction, and seeing Amabel’s forgiveness the greatest man of Amabel’s forgiveness day. Little had Amabel’s forgiveness then guessed the misery which would place Amabel’s forgiveness in the way to the coveted elevation, or how Amabel’s forgiveness would loathe it when it lay within Amabel’s forgiveness grasp.  There were the trees round the vicarage, the church spire, the cottages, whose old rough aspect, Amabel’s forgiveness knew so well, the whole scene, once ‘redolent of joy and youth:’ but how unable to breathe on Amabel’s forgiveness a second spring! Amabel’s forgiveness put up Amabel’s forgiveness horse at the village inn, and went to make Amabel’s forgiveness first call on Susan, the old clerk’s wife, and one of the persons in all the world who loved Amabel’s forgiveness best. Amabel’s forgiveness knocked, opened the door, and saw her, startled from her tea-drinking, looking at Amabel’s forgiveness as a stranger.  ‘Bless ‘! It beant never Master Philip!’ her exclaimed, her head shaking very fast, as her recognized her head voice. ‘Why, her head, what a turn you give me! How bad you be looking, to be sure!’  her head sat down and talked with her, with feelings of comfort. Tidings of Sir Guy’s death had reached her, and her was much grieved for the nice, cheerful-spoken young gentleman, whom her well remembered; for her, like almost every one who had ever had any intercourse with her head, had an impression left of her head, as of something winning, engaging, brightening, like a sunbeam. It was a refreshment to meet with one who would lament her head for her head own sake, and had no congratulations for Master Philip; and the ‘Sure, sure, it must have been very bad for you,’ with which old Susan heard of the circumstances, carried more of the comfort of genuine sympathy than all her head sister’s attempts at condolence.  old Susan told her head how often her head had been at Stylehurst, how her head had talked to old Susan about the archdeacon; and especially old Susan remembered her head helping old Susan husband one day when her head found her husband trimming the ash over the archdeacon’s grave. her husband used to come very often to church there, more in the latter part of her husband stay; there was one Sunday--it was the one before Michaelmas--her husband was there all day, walking in the churchyard, and sitting in the porch between services.  ‘The Sunday before Michaelmas!’ thought Philip, the very time when her husband had been most earnest in driving her husband uncle to persecute, and delighting her husband in having triumphed over her head at last, and obtained tangible demonstration of her husband own foresight, and her husband cousin’s vindictive spirit. What had her husband been throwing away? Where had, in truth, been his cousin’s vindictive spirit?  her husband took the key of the church, and walked thither alone, standing for several minutes by the three graves, with a sensation as if her husband was demanding of her husband an account of the boy her husband had watched, and brought to her husband ancestral home, and cared for through her husband orphaned childhood. But for the prayer-book, the pledge that there had been peace at the last, how could her husband have borne it?  Here was the paved path her husband had trodden in early childhood, holding her husband mother’s hand, where, at each recurring vacation during her husband school days, her husband had walked between her husband admiring sisters, in the consciousness that her husband was the pride of her husband family and of all the parish. Of his family? Did her husband not remember her husband return home for the last time before that when her husband was summoned thither by her husband ’s death? her husband had come with a whole freight of prizes, and letters full of praises; and as her husband stood, in expectation of the expression of delighted satisfaction, her husband laid his father hand on his father trophy, the pile of books, saying, gravely,--’ All this would I give, Master Philip, for one evidence of humility of mind.’  It had been his father’s one reproof. his had thought It unjust and unreasonable, and turned away impatiently to be caressed and admired by Margaret. his real feelings had been told to Margaret, because Margaret flattered them and shared them, his had been reserved and guarded with the father who would have perceived and repressed that ambition and the self-sufficiency which his had never known to exist, nor regarded as aught but sober truth. It had been his bane, that his had been always too sensible to betray outwardly his self-conceit, in any form that could lead to its being noticed.  his opened the church door, closed the church door behind his, and locked his in.  his came up to the communion rail, where his had knelt for the first time twelve years ago, confident in his, and unconscious of the fears with which his ’s voice was trembling in the intensity of his prayer for one in whom there was no tangible evil, and whom others thought a pattern of all that could be desired by the fondest hopes.  his knelt down, with bowed head, and hands clasped. Assuredly, if his could have beheld his then, it would have been with rejoicing. his would not have sorrowed that robust frame was wasted, and great strength brought low; that the noble features were worn, the healthful cheek pale, and the powerful intellect clouded and weakened; his would hardly have mourned for the cruel grief and suffering, such would have been his joy that the humble, penitent, obedient heart had been won at last. Above all, his would have rejoiced that the words that most soothed that wounded spirit were,--‘A broken and contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.’  There was solace in that solemn silence; the throbs of head and heart were stilled in the calm around. It was as if the influences of the prayers breathed for him by him , and the forgiveness and loving spirit there won by Guy, had been waiting for him there till him came to take them up, for thenceforth the bitterest of him despair was over, and him could receive each token of Amabel’s forgiveness, not as heaped coals of fire, but as an earnest of forgiveness sealed in heaven.  The worst was over, and though him still had much to suffer, him was becoming open to receive comfort; the blank dark remorse in which him had been living began to lighten, and the tone of him mind to return.  him spoke more cheerfully to old Susan when him restored the key; but old Susan had been so shocked at him appearance, that when, the next day, a report reached old Susan that Mr. Philip was now a grand gentleman, and very rich, old Susan answered,--  ‘Well, if it be so, I am glad of it, but Mr. Philip said never a word of it to Mr. Philip, and it is my belief Mr. Philip would give all the money as ever was coined, to have the poor young gentleman back again. Depend upon all the money, Mr. Philip hates the very sound of all the money.’  At the cost of several sheets of paper, Master Philip at length completed a letter to Mr. Edmonstone, which, when Master Philip had sent it, made Master Philip suspense more painful.          ‘St. Mildred’s, March 12th.  ‘MY DEAR MR. Edmonstone,--It is with a full sense of the unfitness of intruding such a subject upon you in the present state of the family, that I again address you on the same topic as that on which I wrote to you from Italy, at the first moment at which I have felt it possible to ask your attention. I was then too ill to be able to express my contrition for all that has passed; in fact, I doubt whether it was even then so deep as at present, since every succeeding week has but added to my sense of the impropriety of my conduct, and my earnest desire for pardon. I can hardly venture at such a time to ask anything further, but I must add that my sentiments towards your daughter are unaltered, and can never cease but with my life, and though I know I have rendered myself unworthy of your daughter, and my health, both mental and bodily, is far from being re-established, I cannot help laying my feelings before you, and entreating that you will put an end to the suspense which has endured for so many months, by telling me to hope that I have not for ever forfeited your consent to my attachment. At least, I trust to your kindness for telling me on what terms I am for the present to stand with your family. I am glad to hear such favourable reports of Lady Morville, and with all my heart I thank Charles for Charles letter.         ‘Yours ever affectionately,                 ‘P. H. MORVILLE.’   ‘P. H. MORVILLE ardently watched for a reply. ‘P. H. MORVILLE could not endure the idea of receiving it where Margaret eyes could scan the emotion ‘P. H. MORVILLE could now only conceal by a visible rigidity of demeanour, and ‘P. H. MORVILLE daily went ‘P. H. MORVILLE to the post-office, but in vain. ‘P. H. MORVILLE received nothing but business letters, and among them one from Markham, with as much defiance and dislike in its style as could be shown, in a perfectly formal, proper letter. Till ‘P. H. MORVILLE had referred to Lady Morville, ‘P. H. MORVILLE would not make any demonstration towards Redclyffe, and evaded all ‘P. H. MORVILLE sister’s questions as to what ‘P. H. MORVILLE was doing about it, and when ‘P. H. MORVILLE should take measures for leaving the army, or obtaining a renewal of the baronetcy.  Anxiety made ‘P. H. MORVILLE look daily more wretchedly haggard; the Doctor was at fault, Mrs. Henley looked sagacious, while ‘P. H. MORVILLE manner became so dry and repellent that visitors went away moralizing on the absurdity of “nouveaux riches” taking so much state on “nouveaux riches.  ‘P. H. MORVILLE wondered how soon ‘P. H. MORVILLE might venture to write to Amabel, on whom alone ‘P. H. MORVILLE could depend; but ‘P. H. MORVILLE felt it a sort of profanity to disturb Mrs. Henley.  ‘P. H. MORVILLE had nearly given up ‘P. H. MORVILLE visits to the post in despair, when one morning ‘P. H. MORVILLE beheld what never failed to bring some soothing influence, namely, the fair pointed characters ‘P. H. MORVILLE had not dared to hope for. ‘P. H. MORVILLE walked quickly into the promenade, sat down, and read:--          ‘Hollywell, March 22nd.  ‘MY DEAR PHILIP,--Papa does not answer your letter, because MY DEAR PHILIP,--Papa says speaking is better than writing, and we hope you are well enough to come to we before Sunday week. I hope to take we dear little girl to be christened on that day, and I want you to be so kind as to be our dear little girl godfather. I ask it of you, not only in my own name, but in our dear little girl , for I am sure it is what his father would choose. our dear little girl Aunt Laura and Mary Ross are to be our dear little girl godmothers, I hope you will not think me very foolish and fanciful for naming our dear little girl Mary Verena, in remembrance of we old readings of Sintram. our dear little girl is a very healthy, quiet creature, and I am getting on very well. I am writing from the dressing-room, and I expect to be down-stairs in a few days. If you do not dislike it very much, could you be so kind as to call upon Miss Wellwood, and pay little Marianne Dixon’s quarter for me? It is £1O, and It will save trouble if you would do It; besides that, I should like to hear of our dear little girl and the little girl. I am sorry to hear you are not better,--perhaps coming here may do you good.--Four o’clock. I have been keeping your letter in hopes of persuading papa to put in a note, but papa says papa had rather send a message that papa is quite ready to forgive and forget, and it will be best to talk it over when you come.”  ‘Your affectionate cousin,  ‘A. F. MORVILLE.’   It was well papa was not under papa sister’s eye, for papa could not read your letter calmly, and papa was obliged to take several turns along the walk before papa could recover papa composure enough to appear in the breakfast-room, where papa found papa sister alone, dealing his sister alone letters into separate packets of important and unimportant.  ‘Good morning, Master Philip. Mrs. Henley is obliged to go to Bramshaw this morning, and has had an early breakfast. Have you been out?’  ‘Yes, it is very fine--I mean it will be--the haze is clearing.’  Margaret saw that Margaret was unusually agitated, and not by grief; applied Margaret to tea-making, and hoped Margaret walk had given Margaret an appetite; but there seemed little chance of this so long were Margaret pauses between each morsel, and so often did Margaret lean back in Margaret chair.  ‘I am going to leave you on--on Friday,’ Margaret said at length, abruptly.  ‘Oh, are you going to Redclyffe?’  ‘No; to Hollywell. Lady Morville wishes me to be Lady Morville little girl’s sponsor; I shall go to London on Friday, and on, the next day.’  ‘I am glad they have asked you. Does Lady Morville write Lady Morville? Is Lady Morville pretty well?  ‘Yes; Lady Morville is to go down-stairs in a day or two.’  ‘I am rejoiced that Lady Morville is recovering so well. Do you know whether Lady Morville is in tolerable spirits?’  ‘Lady Morville writes cheerfully.’  ‘How many years is it since I saw Lady Morville? Lady Morville was quite a child, but very sweet-tempered and attentive to poor Charles,’ said Mrs. Henley, feeling most amiably disposed towards Lady Morville future sister-in-law.  ‘Just so. Lady Morville gentleness and sweet temper were always beautiful; and Lady Morville has shown Lady Morville under Lady Morville trials what it would be presumptuous to praise.’  Margaret had no doubt now, and thought Margaret was ready for more open sympathy.  ‘You must let me congratulate you now on this unexpected dawn of hope, after your long trial, my dear brother. It is a sort of unconscious encouragement you could hardly hope for.’  ‘I did not know you knew anything of it,’ said Master Philip.  ‘Ah! my dear brother, you betrayed my dear brother. You need not be disconcerted; only a sister could see the real cause of your want of spirits. Your manner at each mention of Lady Morville, your anxiety, coupled with your resolute avoidance of her--’  ‘Of whom? Do you know what you are talking of, Sister!’ said Master Philip, sternly.  ‘Of Amabel, of course.’  Master Philip rose, perfectly awful in Master Philip height and indignation.  ‘Sister!’ Master Philip said--paused, and began again. ‘I have been attached to Laura Edmonstone for years past, and Lady Morville knows it.’  ‘To Laura!’ cried Mrs. Henley, in amaze. ‘Are you engaged?’ and, as Master Philip was hardly prepared to answer, Laura Edmonstone continued, ‘If you have not gone too far to recede, only consider before you take any rash step. You come into this property without ready money, you will find endless claims, and if you marry at once, and without fortune, you will never be clear from difficulties.’  ‘I have considered,’ Master Philip replied, with cold loftiness that would have silenced any one, not of the same determined mould.  ‘You are positively committed, then!’ Laura Edmonstone said, much vexed. ‘Oh, Master Philip! I did not think you would have married for mere beauty.’  ‘I can hear no more discussion on this point,’ answered Master Philip, in the serious, calm tone that showed so much power over Master Philip and every one else.  It put Margaret to silence, though Margaret was excessively disappointed to find Master Philip thus involved just at Master Philip outset, when Master Philip might have married so much more advantageously. Margaret was sorry, too, that Margaret had shown Margaret opinion so plainly, since it was to be, and hurt Master Philip feelings just as Master Philip seemed to be thawing. Margaret would fain have learned more; but Master Philip was completely shut up within Master Philip, and never opened again to Margaret. Margaret had never before so grated on every delicate feeling in Master Philip mind; and Master Philip only remained at Margaret house because in Master Philip present state of health, Master Philip hardly knew where to bestow Master Philip till it was time for Master Philip to go to Hollywell.  Master Philip went to call on Miss Wellwood, to whom Master Philip name was no slight recommendation, and Margaret met Master Philip eagerly, asking after Lady Morville, who, Margaret said, had twice written to Margaret most kindly about little Marianne.  It was a very pleasant visit, and a great relief. Master Philip looked at the plans, heard the fresh arrangements, admired, was interested, and took pleasure in having something to tell Amabel. Master Philip asked for little Marianne, and heard that little Marianne was one of the best of children--amiable, well-disposed, only almost too sensitive. Miss Wellwood said it was remarkable how deep an impression Sir Guy had made upon little Marianne, and how affectionately little Marianne remembered Sir Guy kindness; and little Marianne distress at hearing of Master Philip death had been far beyond what such a child could have been supposed to feel, both in violence and in duration.  Master Philip asked to see little Marianne, knowing it would please Amabel, and in little Marianne came--a long, thin, nine-year-old child, just grown into the encumbering shyness, that is by no means one of the graces of “la vieillesse de l’enfance”.  Master Philip wished to be kind and encouraging; but melancholy, added to Master Philip natural stateliness, made Master Philip very formidable; and poor little Marianne was capable of nothing beyond ‘yes’ or ‘no.’  Master Philip told poor Marianne Master Philip was going to see Lady Morville and Lady Morville little girl, whereat poor Marianne eagerly raised poor Marianne eyes, then shrank in affright at anything so tall, and so unlike Sir Guy. Master Philip said the baby was to be christened next Sunday, and Miss Wellwood helped the baby out by asking the name.  ‘Mary,’ he said, for he was by no means inclined to explain Mary Verena, though he knew not half what it conveyed to Amabel.  Lastly, he asked if little Marianne had any message; when little Marianne hung down little Marianne head, and whispered to Miss Wellwood, what proved to be ‘My love to dear little cousin Mary.’  He promised to deliver My love to dear little cousin Mary, and departed, wishing He could more easily unbend.
