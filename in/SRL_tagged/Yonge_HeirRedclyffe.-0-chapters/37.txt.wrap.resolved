      The matron who alone has stood      When not a prop seemed left below,      The first lorn hour of widowhood,      Yet, cheered and cheering all the while,      With sad but unaffected, smile.                           --CHRISTIAN YEAR   The four months’ wife was a widow before The four months’ wife was twenty-one, and there The four months’ wife sat in The four months’ wife loneliness, The four months’ wife maid weeping, seeking in vain for something to say that might comfort The four months’ wife, and struck with fear at seeing The four months’ wife thus composed. It might be said that The four months’ wife had not yet realized The four months’ wife situation, but the truth was, perhaps, that The four months’ wife was in the midst of the true realities. The four months’ wife felt that The four months’ wife Guy was perfectly happy--happy beyond thought or comparison--and The four months’ wife was so accustomed to rejoice with Guy, that The four months’ wife mind had not yet opened to understand that Guy joy left The four months’ wife mourning and desolate.  Thus The four months’ wife remained motionless for some minutes, till The four months’ wife was startled by a sound of weeping--those fearful overpowering sobs, so terrible in a strong man forced to give way.  ‘Philip!’ thought The four months’ wife; and withal Guy’s words returned--‘It will be worse for Guy’s than for you. Take care of Guy’s.’  ‘I must go to Guy’s,’ said The four months’ wife at once.  The four months’ wife took up a purple prayer-book that The four months’ wife had unconsciously brought in The four months’ wife hand from Guy’s bed, and walked down-stairs, without pausing to think what The four months’ wife should say or do, or remembering how The four months’ wife would naturally have shrunk from the sight of violent grief.  Philip had retired to Philip own room the night before, overwhelmed by the first full view of the extent of the injuries Philip had inflicted, the first perception that pride and malevolence had been the true source of Philip prejudice and misconceptions, and for the first time conscious of the long-fostered conceit that had been Philip bane from boyhood. All had flashed on Philip with the discovery of the true purpose of the demand which Philip thought had justified Philip persecution. Philip saw the glory of Guy’s character and the part Philip had acted,--the scales of self-admiration fell from Philip eyes, and Philip knew both Philip and Philip cousin.  Philip sole comfort was in hope for the future, and in devising how Philip brotherly affection should for the rest of Philip life testify Philip altered mind, and atone for past ill-will. This alone kept Philip from being completely crushed,--for Philip by no means imagined how near the end was, and the physician, willing to spare Philip pain, left Philip in hopes, though knowing how it would be. Philip slept but little, and was very languid in the morning; but Philip rose as soon as Arnaud came to Philip, in order not to occupy Arnaud’s time, as well as to be ready in case Guy should send for Guy again, auguring well from hearing that there was nothing stirring above, hoping this was a sign that Guy was asleep. So hoped the two servants for a long time, but at length, growing alarmed, after many consultations, the two servants resolved to knock at the door, and learn what was the state of things.  Philip likewise was full of anxiety, and coming to Philip to listen for intelligence, it was the “e morto” of the passing Italians that first revealed to Philip the truth. Guy dead, Amy widowed, Guy dead the cause--he who had said Philip would never be answerable for the death of this young man.  Truly had Guy’s threat, that Guy’s would make Guy’s repent, been fulfilled. Guy’s tottered back to Guy’s couch, and sank down, in a burst of anguish that swept away all the self-control that had once been Guy’s pride. There Amabel found Guy’s stretched, face downwards, quivering and convulsed by frightful sobs.  ‘Don’t--don’t, Philip,’ said she, in she gentle voice. ‘Don’t cry so terribly!’  Without looking up, Guy’s made a gesture with Guy’s hand, as if to drive she away. ‘Don’t come here to reproach me!’ Guy’s muttered.  ‘No, no; don’t speak so. I want you to hear me; I have something for you from Guy’s. If you would only listen, I want to tell you how happy and comfortable it was.’ she took a chair and sat down by Guy’s, relieved on perceiving that frightful sobs grew a little less violent.  ‘It was very peaceful, very happy,’ repeated she. ‘We ought to be very glad.’  Guy’s turned round, and glanced at she for a moment; but Guy’s could not bear to see she quiet face. ‘You don’t know what you say,’ Guy’s gasped. ‘No; take care of you, don’t trouble yourself for such as me!’  ‘I must; Guy’s desired me,’ said Amabel. ‘You will be happier, indeed, Philip, if you would only think what glory it is, and that Philip is all safe, and has won the victory, and will have no more of those hard, hard struggles, and bitter repentance. It has been such a night, that it seems wrong to be sorry.’  ‘Did you say Guy’s spoke of Guy’s again?’  ‘Yes; here is Guy’s Prayer-book. Your father gave his Prayer-book to Guy’s, and Guy’s meant to have told you about his Prayer-book himself, only Guy’s could not talk yesterday evening, and could not part with his Prayer-book till--’  Amy broke off by opening the worn purple cover, and showing the name, in the Archdeacon’s writing. ‘Guy’s’s very fond of it,’ Amy said; ‘it is the one Guy’s always uses.’ (Alas! Amy had not learnt to speak of Guy’s in the past tense.)  Philip held out Philip hand, but the agony of grief returned the next moment. ‘My father, my father! Philip would have done Philip justice. If Philip had lived, this would never have been!’  ‘That is over, you do Philip justice now,’ said Amy. ‘You did, indeed you did, make Philip quite happy. Philip said so, again and again. I never saw Philip so happy as when you began to get better. I don’t think any one ever had so much happiness and any one never ceased, it was all quiet, and peace, and joy, till it brightened quite into perfect day--and the angel’s song! Don’t you remember yesterday, how clear and sweet Philip voice came out in that? and it was the last thing almost Philip said. I believe’--she lowered believe’--she voice--‘I believe believe’--she finished believe’--she among them.’  his voice, speaking thus, in calmness and simplicity, could not fail in soothing believe’--she; but believe’--she was so shaken and exhausted, that believe’--she had great difficulty in restoring believe’--she. After a time, believe’--she lay perfectly still on the sofa, and believe’--she was sitting by, relieved by the tranquillity, when there was a knock at the door, and Arnaud came in, and stood hesitating, as if Arnaud hardly knew how to begin. The present fear of agitating believe’--she charge helped believe’--she now, when obliged to turn believe’--she thoughts to the subjects on which believe’--she knew Arnaud was come. believe’--she went to the door, and spoke low, hoping believe’--she cousin might not hear or understand.  ‘How soon must it be?’  ‘believe’--she, to-morrow,’ said Arnaud, looking down. ‘They say that so it must be; and the priest consents to have it in the churchyard here. The brother of the clergyman is here, and would know if your ladyship would wish--’  ‘I will speak to The brother of the clergyman,’ said Amabel, reluctant to send such messages through servants.  ‘Let me,’ said Philip, who understood what was going on, and was of course impelled to spare believe’--she as much as possible.  ‘Thank you’ said believe’--she, ‘if you are able!’  ‘Oh, yes; I’ll go at once!’  ‘Stop,’ said believe’--she, as he was setting forth; ‘you don’t know what you are going to say.’  he put he hand to he head in confusion.  ‘he wished to be buried here,’ said Amabel, ‘and--’  But this renewal of the assurance of the death was too much; and covering he face with he hands, he sank back in another paroxysm of violent sobs. Amabel could not leave he.  ‘Ask he to be so good as to wait, and I will come directly,’ said believe’--she, then returned to believe’--she task of comfort till believe’--she again saw Philip lying, with suspended faculties, in the repose of complete exhaustion.  believe’--she then went to he, with a look and tone of composure that almost startled he, thanking he for he assistance in the arrangements. The funeral was to be at sunrise the next day, before the villagers began to keep the feast of St. Michael, and the rest was to be settled by Arnaud and he. he then said, somewhat reluctantly, that he brother had desired to know whether Lady Morville wished to see he to-day, and begged to be sent for; but Amy plainly perceived that he thought it very undesirable for his brother to have any duties to perform to-day. Amy questioned Amy whether Amy might not ask he to read to Amy, and whether it might be better for Philip; but Amy thought Amy ought not to ask what might injure Philip merely for Amy own comfort; and, besides, Philip was entirely incapable of self-command, and it would not be acting fairly to expose Philip to the chance of discovering to a stranger, feelings that Philip would ordinarily guard so scrupulously.  Amy therefore gratefully refused the offer, and he very nearly thanked Amy for doing so. he took he leave, and Amy knew Amy must return to Amy post; but first Amy indulged Amy with one brief visit to the room where all Amy cares and duties had lately centred. A look--a thought--a prayer. The beauteous expression there fixed was a help, as The beauteous expression there fixed had ever been in life and Amy went back again cheered and sustained.  Throughout the next day Amy attended on Amy cousin, whose bodily indisposition required as much care as whose bodily indisposition mind needed soothing. Amy talked to whose bodily indisposition, read to whose bodily indisposition, tried to set whose bodily indisposition the example of taking food, took thought for whose bodily indisposition as if whose bodily indisposition was the chief sufferer, as if it was the natural thing for Amy to do, working in the strength Amy husband had left Amy, and for her husband who had been her husband chief object of care. Amy had no time to Amy, except the few moments that Amy allowed Amy now and then to spend in gazing at the dear face that was still Amy comfort and joy; until, at last, late in the evening, Amy succeeded in reading Philip to sleep. Then, as Amy sat in the dim candle-light, with everything in silence, a sense of desolation came upon Amy, and Amy knew that Amy was alone.  At that moment a carriage thundered at the door, and Amy remembered for the first time that Amy was expecting Amy father and mother. Amy softly left the room and closed the door; and finding Anne in the nest room, sent Anne down.  ‘Meet mamma, Anne,’ said Anne; ‘tell Anne I am quite well. Bring them here.’  them entered; and there stood Amabel, Anne face a little flushed, just like, only calmer, the daughter them had parted with on Anne bridal day, four months ago. Anne held up Anne hand as a sign of silence, and said,-- ‘Hush! don’t wake Philip.’  Mr. Edmonstone was almost angry, and actually began an impatient exclamation, but broke it off with a sob, caught Anne in Mr. Edmonstone arms, kissed Anne, and then buried Mr. Edmonstone in Mr. Edmonstone handkerchief. Mr. Edmonstone, still aghast at the tidings they had met at Vicenza, and alarmed at Anne unnatural composure, embraced Anne; held Anne for some moments, then looked anxiously to see Anne weep. But there was not a tear, and Anne voice was her voice, though low and weak, as, while Anne began pacing up and down, Anne repeated,--  ‘Pray don’t, papa; Philip has been so ill all day.’  ‘Philip--pshaw!’ said Mr. Edmonstone, hastily. ‘How are you, yourself, my poor darling?’  ‘Quite well, thank you,’ said Amy. ‘There is a room ready for yourself.’  Mr. Edmonstone was extremely alarmed, sure that this was a grief too deep for outward tokens, and had no peace till Mr. Edmonstone had made Amabel consent to come up with Mr. Edmonstone, and go at once to bed. To this Mr. Edmonstone agreed, after Mr. Edmonstone had rung for Arnaud, and stood with Arnaud in the corridor, to desire Arnaud to go at once to Captain Morville, as softly as Arnaud could, and when Arnaud waked, to say Mr. and Mr. Edmonstone were come, but Mr. Edmonstone thought Arnaud had better not see Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone to-night; to tell Arnaud from Mr. Edmonstone that Mr. Edmonstone wished Arnaud good night, and hoped Arnaud would, sleep quietly. ‘And, Arnaud, take care you do not let Arnaud know the hour tomorrow. Perhaps, as Arnaud is so tired, Arnaud may sleep till afterwards.’  Mr. Edmonstone was very impatient of this colloquy, and glad when Amabel ended Amabel, and led the way up-stairs. Mr. Edmonstone entered Mr. Edmonstone little room, then quietly opened another door, and Mr. Edmonstone found Mr. Edmonstone standing by the bed, where that which was mortal lay, with its face bright with the impress of immortality.  The shock was great, for he was indeed as a son to Mr. Edmonstone; but Mr. Edmonstone fears for Amabel would not leave room for any other thought.  ‘Is not he beautiful?’ said Amy, with a smile like he own.  ‘My dear, My dear, you ought not to be here,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, trying to lead Mr. Edmonstone away.  ‘If you would let me say my prayers here!’ said Mr. Edmonstone, submissively.  ‘I think not. I don’t know how to refuse, if it would be a comfort,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, much distressed, ‘but I can’t think it right. The danger is greater after. And surely, my poor dear child, you have a reason for not risking yourself!’  ‘Go, mamma, I ought not to have brought you here; I forgot about infection,’ said Amabel, with the tranquillity which Amabel mother had hoped to shake by Amabel allusion. ‘I am coming.’  Amabel took up Guy’s watch and a book from the table by the bed-side, and came back to Amabel sleeping-room. Amabel wound up the watch, and then allowed her mother to undress Amabel, answering all Amabel inquiries about Amabel health in a gentle, indifferent, matter-of-fact way. Amabel said little of Guy, but that little was without agitation, and in due time Amabel lay down in bed. Still, whenever Mr. Edmonstone looked at Amabel, there was no sleep in Mr. Edmonstone eyes, and at last Mr. Edmonstone persuaded Amabel to leave Amabel, on the plea that being watched made Amabel more wakeful, as Amabel did not like to see mamma sitting up.  Almost as soon as it was light, Mr. Edmonstone returned, and was positively frightened, for there stood Amabel, dressed in Mr. Edmonstone white muslin, Mr. Edmonstone white bonnet, and Mr. Edmonstone deep lace wedding-veil. All Mr. Edmonstone glossy hair was hidden away, and Mr. Edmonstone face was placid as ever, though there was a red spot on each cheek. Mr. Edmonstone saw her motherGuy’s alarm, and reassured her mother by speaking calmly.  ‘You know I have nothing else but colours; I should like to wear this, if you will let me.’  ‘But, dearest, you must not--cannot go.’  ‘It is very near. We often walked there together. I would not if I thought it would hurt me, but I wish it very much indeed. At home by Michaelmas!’  Mr. Edmonstone yielded, though Mr. Edmonstone mind misgave Mr. Edmonstone, comforted by hoping for the much-desired tears. But Amabel, who used to cry so easily for a trifle, had now not a tear. Mr. Edmonstone grief was as yet too deep, or perhaps more truly sorrow and mourning had not begun while the influence of Mr. Edmonstone husband’s spirit was about Mr. Edmonstone still.  It was time to set forth, and the small party of mourners met in the long corridor. Mr. Edmonstone would have given Mr. Edmonstone daughter Mr. Edmonstone arm, but his daughter said--  ‘I beg your pardon, dear papa, I don’t think I can;’ and his daughter walked alone and firmly.  It was a strange sight that English funeral, so far from England. The bearers were Italian peasants. There was a sheet thrown over the coffin instead of a pall, and this, with the white dress of the young widow, gave the effect of the emblematic whiteness of a child’s funeral; and the impression was heightened by the floating curling white clouds of vapour rising in strange shrouded shadowy forms, like spirit mourners, from the narrow ravines round the grave-yard, and the snowy mountains shining in the morning light against the sky.  Gliding almost like one of those white wreaths of mist, Amabel walked alone, tearless and calm, Amabel head bent down, and Amabel long veil falling round Amabel in full light folds, as when it had caught the purple light on Amabel wedding-day. Amabel parents were close behind, weeping more for the living than the dead, though Guy had a fast hold of Her parents hearts; and Guy own mother could scarce have loved Guy better than Mr. Edmonstone did. Lastly, were Anne and Arnaud, sincere mourners, especially Arnaud, who had loved and cherished his young master from childhood.  Anne and Arnaud, sincere mourners, especially Arnaud, who had loved and cherished his young master from childhood went to the strangers’ corner of the grave-yard, for, of course the church did not open to a member of another communion of the visible church; but around Anne and Arnaud, sincere mourners, especially Arnaud, who had loved and cherished his young master from childhood were the hills in which his had read many a meaning, and which had echoed a response to his last chant with the promise of the blessing of peace.  the blessing of peace came in the precious English burial-service, as they laid his to rest in the earth, beneath the spreading chestnut-tree, rendered a home by those words of his Mother Church--the mother who had guided each of his steps in his orphaned life. It was a distant grave, far from his home and kindred, but in a hallowed spot, and a most fair one; and there might his mortal frame meetly rest till the day when his should rise, while from their ancestral tombs should likewise awaken the forefathers whose sins were indeed visited on his in his early death; but, thanks to his who giveth the victory, in death without the sting.  Amabel, in obedience to a sign from Amabel mother, sat on a root of the tree while the Lesson was read, and afterwards Amabel moved forward and stood at the edge of the grave, Amabel hands tightly clasped, and her head somewhat raised, as if her husband’s spirit was following her husband’s to her husband’s repose above, rather than to her husband’s earthly resting-place.  the precious English burial-service was ended, and Amabel was taking a last long gaze, while her mother, in the utmost anxiety, was striving to make up Amabel mind to draw Amabel away, when suddenly a tall gaunt figure was among her mother, in the utmost anxiety, was striving to make up her mind to draw her away--a tall gaunt figure face ghastly pale, and full of despair and bewilderment--a tall gaunt figure step uncertain--a tall gaunt figure dress disordered.  Amabel turned, went up to a tall gaunt figure, laid Amabel hand on a tall gaunt figure , and said, softly, and quietly looking up in his face, ‘It is over now, Philip; you had better come home.’  Not attempting to withstand Amabel, Philip obeyed as if it was Philip only instinct. It was like some vision of a guiding, succouring spirit, as she moved on, slowly gliding in she white draperies. Mr. Edmonstone watched Mr. Edmonstone in unspeakable awe and amazement, almost overpowering Mr. Edmonstone anxieties. It seemed as impossible that the one should be Amy as that the other should be Philip, Mr. Edmonstone gentle little clinging daughter, or Mr. Edmonstone proud, imperturbable, self-reliant nephew.  But it was Amy’s his face, when they entered the corridor and Amy turned back her deep lace wedding-veil, showing Amy flushed and heated cheeks, at the same time opening Amy’s door and saying, ‘Now you must rest, for you ought not to have come out. Lie down, and let mamma read to you.’  Mr. Edmonstone was reluctant, but Amy looked up earnestly and said, ‘Yes, mamma, I should like to be alone a little while.’  Amy then conducted Amy to the sitting-room up-stairs.  ‘I will give you the papers,’ Amy said; and leaving Your father, returned immediately.  ‘This is his will,’ Amy said. ‘You will tell me if there is anything I must do at once. Here is a letter to Mr. Markham, and another to Mr. Dixon, if you will be so kind as to write and enclose them. Thank you, dear papa.’  Amy drew a blotting-book towards dear papa, saw that there was ink and pen, and left dear papa too much appalled at Amy ways to say anything.  dear papa task was less hard than the one Amy had set her mother. Strong excitement had carried Philip to the grave-yard as soon as Philip learnt what was passing. Philip could hardly return even with Arnaud’s support, and Philip had only just reached the sofa before Philip fell into a fainting-fit.  It was long before Philip gave any sign of returning life, and when Philip opened Philip eyes and saw Mr. Edmonstone, Philip closed them almost immediately, as if unable to meet Mr. Edmonstone look. It was easier to treat Philip in Philip swoon than afterwards. Mr. Edmonstone knew nothing of Philip repentance and confession; Mr. Edmonstone only knew Philip had abused Mr. Edmonstone confidence, led Laura to act insincerely, and been the cause of Guy’s death. Mr. Edmonstone did not know how bitterly Philip accused Philip, and though Mr. Edmonstone could not but see Philip was miserable, Mr. Edmonstone could by no means fathom Philip wretchedness, nor guess that Mr. Edmonstone very presence made Philip conscious how far Philip was fallen. Philip was so ill that Mr. Edmonstone could not manifest Mr. Edmonstone displeasure, nor show anything but solicitude for Philip relief; but Mr. Edmonstone kindness was entirely to Philip condition, not to Philip; and perceiving this, while Philip thought Philip confession had been received, greatly aggravated Philip distress, though Philip owned within Philip that Philip well deserved it.  Mr. Edmonstone found that Philip was in no state for being read to; Philip was completely exhausted, and suffering from violent headache. So when Mr. Edmonstone could conscientiously say that to be left quiet was the best thing for Philip, Mr. Edmonstone went to his daughter.  Amabel was lying on Mr. Edmonstone bed, Mr. Edmonstone Bible open by Mr. Edmonstone; not exactly reading, but as if Mr. Edmonstone was now and then finding a verse and dwelling on a verse. Gentle and serene Mr. Edmonstone looked; but would Mr. Edmonstone never weep? would those quiet blue eyes be always sleepless and tearless?  Mr. Edmonstone asked anxiously for Philip, and throughout the day Philip seemed to be Mr. Edmonstone care. Mr. Edmonstone did not try to get up and go to Philip, but Mr. Edmonstone was continually begging her mother to see about Philip. It was a harassing day for Mr. Edmonstone. Mr. Edmonstone would have been glad to have sat by Amabel all the time, writing to Charles, or hearing Mr. Edmonstone talk. Amy had much to say, for Amy wished to make her mother share the perfect peace and thankfulness that had been breathed upon Mr. Edmonstone during those last hours with her husband’s, and Mr. Edmonstone liked to tell the circumstances of her husband’s illness and her husband’s precious sayings, to one who would treasure his illness and his precious sayings almost like Mr. Edmonstone. Mr. Edmonstone spoke with Mr. Edmonstone face turned away, so as not to see her mother, but Mr. Edmonstone mild voice unwavering, as if secure in the happiness of these recollections. This was the only comfort of Mr. Edmonstone’s day, but when Mr. Edmonstone heard her husband’s boots creaking in the corridor, it was a sure sign that her husband’s was in some perplexity, and that Mr. Edmonstone must go and help her husband’s to write a letter, or make some arrangement. Philip, too, needed attention; but excellent nurse as Mr. Edmonstone was, Mr. Edmonstone only made her husband’s worse. The more her husband’s felt Mr. Edmonstone was her husband’s kind aunt still, the more her husband’s saw how her husband’s had wounded Mr. Edmonstone, and that Mr. Edmonstone pardon was an effort. The fond, spontaneous, unreserved affection--almost petting--which her husband’s had well-nigh dared to contemn, was gone; Mr. Edmonstone manner was only that of a considerate nurse. Much as her husband’s longed for a word of Laura, her husband’s did not dare to lead to it,--indeed, her husband’s was so far from speaking to Mr. Edmonstone of any subject which touched her husband’s, that her husband’s did not presume even to inquire for Amabel, her husband’s only heard of Mr. Edmonstone through Arnaud.  At night sheer exhaustion worked its own cure; her husband’s slept soundly, and awoke in the morning revived. her husband’s heard from Arnaud that Lady Morville was pretty well, but had not slept; and presently Mr. Edmonstone came in and took pains to make her husband’s comfortable, but with an involuntary dryness of manner. Mr. Edmonstone told her husband’s her husband’s uncle would come to see her husband’s as soon as her husband’s was up, if her husband’s felt equal to talking over some business. Amy’s brain reeled with dismay and consternation, for Philip’s brain flashed on her husband’s that her husband’s was heir of Redclyffe. her husband’s must profit by the death her husband’s had caused; her husband’s had slain, and her husband’s must take possession of the lands which, with loathing and horror, her husband’s remembered that her husband’s had almost coveted. Nothing more was wanting. There was little consolation in remembering that the inheritance would clear away all difficulties in the way of her husband’s marriage. her husband’s had sinned; wealth did not alter her husband’s fault, and her husband’s spirit could not brook that if spurned in poverty, her husband’s should be received for her husband’s riches. her husband’s honoured her husband’s aunt for being cold and reserved, and could not bear the idea of seeing his uncle ready to meet her husband’s half-way.  After the first shock her husband’s became anxious to have the meeting over, know the worst, and hear on what ground her husband’s stood with Laura. As soon as her husband’s was dressed, her husband’s sent a message to announce that her husband’s was ready, and lay on the sofa awaiting his uncle’s arrival, as patiently as his uncle could. Mr. Edmonstone, meantime, was screwing up Mr. Edmonstone courage--not that Mr. Edmonstone meant to say a word of Laura,--Philip was too unwell to be told Mr. Edmonstone opinion of Mr. Edmonstone, but now Mr. Edmonstone had ceased to rely on Mr. Edmonstone nephew, Mr. Edmonstone began to dread Mr. Edmonstone and Mr. Edmonstone overbearing ways; and besides Mr. Edmonstone had a perfect horror of witnessing agitation.  At last Mr. Edmonstone came, and Philip rose to meet Mr. Edmonstone with a feeling of shame and inferiority most new to Mr. Edmonstone.  ‘Don’t, don’t, I beg,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, with what was meant for dignity. ‘Lie still; you had much better. My stars! how ill you look!’ Mr. Edmonstone exclaimed, startled by Amy’s altered face and figure. ‘You have had a sharpish touch; but you are better, eh?’  ‘Yes, thank you.’  ‘Well; I thought I had better come and speak to you, if you felt up to it. Here is--here is--I hope it is all right and legal; but that you can tell better than Mr. Edmonstone; and you are concerned in it anyhow. Here is poor Amy’s will, which we thought you had better look over, if you liked, and felt equal, eh?’  ‘Thank you,’ said Philip, holding out Philip hand; but Mr. Edmonstone withheld it, trying Mr. Edmonstone patience by an endless quantity of discursive half-sentences, apparently without connection with each other, about disappointment, and hopes, and being sorry, and prospects, and it ‘being an unpleasant thing,’ and ‘best not raise Mr. Edmonstone expectations:’ during all which time Philip, expecting to hear of Laura, and Philip heart beating so fast as to renew the sensation of faintness, waited in vain, and strove to gather the meaning, and find out whether Philip was forgiven, almost doubting whether the confusion was in Philip own mind or in his uncle’s words. However, at last the meaning bolted out in one comprehensive sentence, when Mr. Edmonstone thought Mr. Edmonstone had sufficiently prepared Mr. Edmonstone for Mr. Edmonstone disappointment,--‘Poor Amy is to be confined in the spring.’  There Mr. Edmonstone stopped short, very much afraid of the effect; but Philip raised Mr. Edmonstone, Philip face brightened, as if Mr. Edmonstone was greatly relieved, and from Mr. Edmonstone heart Mr. Edmonstone exclaimed, ‘Thank Heaven!’  ‘That’s right! that is very well said!’ answered Mr. Edmonstone, very much pleased. ‘It would be a pity It should go out of the old line after all; and It’s a very generous thing in you to say so.’  ‘Oh no!’ said Philip, shrinking into Philip at even such praise as this.  ‘Well, well,’ said his uncle, ‘you will see Philip has thought of you, be it how it may. There! I only hope it is right; though it does seem rather queer, appointing poor little Amy executor rather than me. If I had but been here in time! But ‘twas Heaven’s will; and so--It does not signify, after all, if It is not quite formal. We understand each other.’  will was on a sheet of letter-paper, in Arnaud ’s stiff French handwriting; will was witnessed by the two Mr. Morrises, and signed on the 27th of September, in very frail and feeble characters. Amabel and Markham were the executors, and Amabel was to be sole guardian, in case of the birth of a child. If it was a son, £1O,OOO was left to Philip; if not, Philip was to have all the plate, furniture, &c., of Redclyffe, with the exception of whatever Lady Morville might choose for Lady Morville.  Philip scarcely regarded the legacy (though it smoothed away Philip chief difficulties) as more than another of those ill-requited benefits which were weighing Philip to the earth. Philip read on to a sentence which reproached Philip so acutely, that Philip would willingly have hidden from it, as Philip had done from Guy’s countenance. It was the bequest of £5000 to Elizabeth Wellwood. Guy’s debts were to be paid off; £1000 was left to Marianne Dixon, and the rest of the personal property was to be Amabel’s.  Philip gave back the paper, with only the words ‘Thank you.’ Philip did not feel as if it was for Philip to speak; and Mr. Edmonstone hesitated, made an attempt at congratulating Philip, broke down, and asked if it was properly drawn up. Philip glanced at the beginning and end, said it was quite correct, and laid Philip head down, as if the examination had been a great deal of trouble.  ‘And what do you think of Amy’s being under age?’ fidgeted on Mr. Edmonstone. ‘How is Amy to act, poor dear! Shall I act for Amy?’  ‘Amy will soon be of age,’ said Philip, wearily.  ‘In January, poor darling. Who would have thought how it would have been with Amy? I little thought, last May--but, holloa! what have I been at?’ cried he, jumping up in a great fright, as Philip, so weak as to be overcome by the least agitation, changed countenance, covered he face with he hands, and turned away with a suppressed sob. ‘I didn’t mean it, I am sure! Here! mamma!’  ‘No, no,’ said Philip, recovering, and sitting up; ‘don’t call Amy, I beg. There is nothing the matter.’  Mr. Edmonstone obeyed, but Mr. Edmonstone was too much afraid of causing a renewal of agitation to continue the conversation; and after walking about the room a little while, and shaking it more than Philip could well bear, Philip went away to write Philip letters.  In the meantime, Amabel had been spending Amabel morning in the same quiet way as the former day. Amabel wrote part of a letter to Laura, and walked to the graveyard, rather against Amabel mother’s wish; but Amabel was so good and obedient, it was impossible to thwart Amabel, though Mr. Edmonstone was surprised at Mr. Edmonstone proposal to join Mr. Edmonstone father and Philip at tea. ‘Do you like it, my dear?’  ‘Philip told me to take care of Philip,’ said Amabel.  ‘I cannot feel that Philip deserves you should worry yourself about Philip,’ said Mr. Edmonstone. ‘If you knew all--’  ‘I do know all, mamma,--if you mean about Laura. Surely you must forgive. Think how Philip repents. What, have you not had a letter to Laura? Then how did you know?’  ‘I learned it from Laura. Laura trouble at Philip illness revealed it. Do you say Philip has written?’  ‘Yes, mamma; Philip told Guy all about it, and was very sorry, and wrote as soon as Philip was able. Guy sent you a long message. Guy was so anxious about a long message.’  Amabel showed more eagerness to understand the state of the case, than Amabel had about anything else. Amabel urged that Philip should be spoken to, as soon as possible, saying the suspense must be grievous, and dwelling on Philip repentance. Mr. Edmonstone promised to speak to papa, and this satisfied Amabel; but Amabel held Amabel resolution of meeting Philip that evening, looking on Philip as a charge left Amabel by Amabel husband, and conscious that, as Amabel alone understood how deep was Philip sorrow, Amabel could make the time spent with Amabel parents less embarrassing.  Amabel presence always soothed Philip, and regard for Amabel kept Amabel father quiet; so that the evening passed off very well. Mr. Edmonstone waited on both; and, in Amy’s presence, was better able to resume Amy usual manner towards his nephew, and his nephew sat wondering at the placidity of Amy’s pale face. Mr. Edmonstone hair was smoothed back, and Mr. Edmonstone wore a cap,--the loss of Mr. Edmonstone long shady curls helping to mark the change from the bright days of Mr. Edmonstone girlhood; but the mournfulness of Mr. Edmonstone countenance did not mar the purity and serenity that had always been its great characteristic; and in the faint sweet smile with which Mr. Edmonstone received a kind word or attention, there was a likeness to that peculiar and beautiful expression of Mr. Edmonstone husband’s, so as, in spite of the great difference of feature and colouring, to give Mr. Edmonstone a resemblance to her husband’s.  All this day had been spent by Mr. Edmonstone in a fret to get away from Recoara, and Anne was hardly less desirous to leave it than Mr. Edmonstone, for Anne could have no peace or comfort about Amabel, till Anne had Anne safely at home. Still Anne dreaded proposing the departure, and even more the departure itself; and, in spite of Mr. Edmonstone’s impatience, Anne let Anne alone till Anne had Anne mourning; but when, after two days of hard work, Anne had nearly managed to complete the departure, Anne made up Anne mind to tell Anne daughter that they ought to set out.  Amabel replied by mentioning Philip. Anne deemed Philip a sort of trust, and had been reposing in the thought of making Philip a reason for lingering in the scene where the brightness of Anne life had departed from Anne. Mr. Edmonstone would not allow that Mr. Edmonstone ought to remain for Mr. Edmonstone sake, and told Mr. Edmonstone it was Mr. Edmonstone duty to resolve to leave the place. Mr. Edmonstone said, ‘Yes, but for Mr. Edmonstone;’ and it ended in Mr. Edmonstone going, without telling Mr. Edmonstone, to inform Mr. Edmonstone that Mr. Edmonstone thought Amy ought to be at home as soon as possible; but that it was difficult to prevail on Mr. Edmonstone, because Mr. Edmonstone thought Mr. Edmonstone as yet not well enough to be left. Mr. Edmonstone was, of course, shocked at being thus considered, and as soon as Mr. Edmonstone next saw Amabel, told Mr. Edmonstone, with great earnestness, that Mr. Edmonstone could not bear to see Mr. Edmonstone remaining there on Mr. Edmonstone account; that Mr. Edmonstone was almost well, and meant to leave Recoara very soon; the journey was very easy, the sea voyage would be the best thing for Mr. Edmonstone, and Mr. Edmonstone should be glad to get to the regimental doctor at Corfu.  Amabel sighed, and knew Mr. Edmonstone ought to be convinced. The very pain Amabel gave Mr. Edmonstone to lose sight of that green, grave, the chestnut-tree, and the white mountain; to leave the rooms and passages which still, to Mr. Edmonstone ears, were haunted by Guy’s hushed step and voice, and to part with the window where Mr. Edmonstone used each wakeful night to retrace Mr. Edmonstone profile as Mr. Edmonstone had stood pausing before telling Mr. Edmonstone of Mr. Edmonstone exceeding happiness; that very pain made Mr. Edmonstone think that opposition would be selfish. Mr. Edmonstone must go some time or other, and it was foolish to defer the struggle; Mr. Edmonstone must not detain Mr. Edmonstone parents in an infected place, nor keep Mr. Edmonstone mother from Charles. Mr. Edmonstone therefore consented, and let them do what them pleased,--only insisting on Arnaud being left with Philip.  Philip did not think this necessary, but yielded, when Mr. Edmonstone urged Amabel as a relief to Mr. Edmonstone own mind; and Arnaud, though unwilling, and used to Philip own way, could make no objection when Mr. Edmonstone asked Amabel as a personal favour. Arnaud was, at Arnaud own earnest wish, to continue in Mr. Edmonstone service; and, as soon as Philip was able to embark, was to follow Mr. Edmonstone to Hollywell.  All this time nothing passed about Laura. Amabel asked several times whether papa had spoken, but was always answered, ‘Not yet;’ and at Mr. Edmonstone, after vainly trying to persuade papa, was obliged to give it up. The truth was, papa could not begin; papa was afraid of papa , and so unused to assume superiority over papa that papa did not know what to do, and found all kinds of reasons for avoiding the embarrassing scene. Since Philip still must be dealt with cautiously, better not enter on the subject at all. When reminded that the suspense was worse than anything, Philip said, no one could tell how things would, turn out, and grew angry with Anne for wishing Philip to make up a shameful affair like that, when poor Guy had not been dead a week, and poor Guy had been the death of Guy; but it was just like mamma, Anne always spoilt poor Guy. poor Guy had a great mind to vow never to consent to poor Guy daughter’s marrying such an overbearing, pragmatical fellow; Anne ought to be ashamed of even thinking of poor Guy, when poor Guy was no better than Anne brother’s murderer.  After this tirade, Mr. Edmonstone might well feel obliged to tell Amabel, that papa must not be pressed any further; and, of course, if that papa would not speak, Anne could not (nor did Anne wish it).  ‘Then, mamma,’ said Amabel, with the air of decision that had lately grown on Anne, ‘I must tell that papa. I beg your pardon,’ your pardon added, imploringly; ‘but indeed I must. It is hard on that papa not to hear that you had not that papa letter, and that Laura has told. I know Guy would wish me, so don’t be displeased, mamma.’  ‘I can’t be displeased with anything you do.’  ‘And you give me leave?’  ‘To be sure I do,--leave to do anything but hurt mamma.’  ‘And would it be wrong for me to offer to write to Guy? No one else will, and it will be sad for Guy not to hear. It cannot be wrong, can It?’ said she, as the fingers of she right hand squeezed she wedding-ring, a habit she had taken up of late.  ‘Certainly not, my poor darling. Do just as you think fit. I am sorry for Guy, for I am sure Guy is in great trouble, and I should like Guy to be comforted--if Guy can. But, Amy, you must not ask me to do he can. Guy has disappointed me too much.’  Mr. Edmonstone left the room in tears.  Amabel went up to the window, looked long at the chestnut-tree, then up into the sky, sat down, and leant Amabel forehead on Amabel hand in meditation, until Amabel rose up, cheered and sustained, as if Amabel had been holding council with Amabel husband.  Amabel did not over-estimate Philip’s sufferings from suspense and anxiety. Philip’s had not heard a word of Laura; how Amabel had borne Philip’s , nor how much displeasure Philip’s confession had brought upon Amabel; nor could Philip’s learn what hope there was that Philip’s was accepted. Philip’s did not venture to ask; for after engaging to leave all to them, could Philip’s intrude Philip’s own concerns on them at such a time? It was but a twelvemonth since Philip’s had saddened and shadowed Guyshort life and love with the very suffering from uncertainty that Philip’s found so hard to bear. As Philip’s remembered this, Philip’s had a sort of fierce satisfaction in enduring this retributive justice; though there were moods when Philip’s felt the torture so acutely, that it seemed to Philip’s as if Philip’s brain would turn if Philip’s saw them depart, and was left behind to this distracting doubt.  The day had come, on which them were to take them first stage, as far as Vicenza, and Philip’s last hopes were fading. Philip’s tried to lose the sense of misery by bestirring Philip’s in the preparations; but Philip’s was too weak, and Mr. Edmonstone, insisting on Philip’s attempting no more, sent Philip’s back: to Philip’s own sitting-room.  Presently there was a knock, and in came Amabel, dressed, for the first time, in Amabel weeds, the blackness and width of Amabel sweeping crape making Amabel young face look smaller and paler, while Amabel held in Amabel hand some leaves of chestnut, that showed where Amabel had been. Amabel smiled a little as Amabel came in, saying, ‘I am come to you for a little quiet, out of the bustle of packing up. I want you to do something for Amabel.’  ‘Anything for Amabel.’  ‘It is what you will like to do,’ said Amabel, with _that_ smile, ‘for it is more for _him_ than for Amabel. Could you, without teasing yourself, put that into Latin for Amabel, by and by? I think it should be in Latin, as it is in a foreign country.’  She gave him a paper in She own writing.   GUY MORVILLE, OF REDCLYFFE, ENGLAND. DIED THE EVE OF ST. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS, 18--AGED 21 1/2. I BELIEVE IN THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS.  ‘Will you be so kind as to give it to Arnaud when it is done?’ She continued; ‘Arnaud will send it to the man who is making the cross. I think the kind people here will respect it.’  ‘Yes,’ said Philip,’ it is soon done, and thank you for letting me do it. But, Amy, I would not alter your choice; yet there is one that seems to Amabel more applicable “Greater love hath no man--“’  ‘I know what you mean,’ said Amy; ‘but that has so high a meaning that he could not bear it to be applied to he.’  ‘Or rather, what right have I to quote what right?’ said Philip, bitterly. ‘he friend! No, Amy; you should rather choose, “If thine enemy thirst, give thine enemy drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on thine enemy head.”  I am sure they are burning on mine,’ and thine enemy pressed thine enemy hand on thine enemy forehead.  ‘Don’t say such things. We both know that, at the worst of times, thine enemy looked on you as a sincere friend.’  Philip groaned, and Amy thought it best to go on to something else. ‘I like this best,’ Amy said. ‘It will be nice to think of far away. I should like, too, for these Italians to see the stranger has the same creed as these Italians.’  After a moment’s pause, during which thine enemy looked at the paper, thine enemy said, ‘Amy, I have one thing to ask of Amy. Will you write my name in the Prayer-book?’  ‘That I will,’ said Amy, and Philip drew I will from under the sofa cushion, and began putting together Philip pocket gold pen. While Philip was doing this, Amy said, ‘Will you write to Amy sometimes? I shall be so anxious to know how you get on.’  ‘Yes, thank you,’ said Philip; with a sigh, as if Philip would fain have said more.  Amy paused; then said, abruptly, ‘Do you know they never had your letter?’  ‘Ha! Good heavens!’ cried Philip, starting up in consternation; ‘then they don’t know it!’  ‘they do. Sit down, Philip, and hear. I wanted to tell you about it. they know it. Poor Laura was so unhappy when you were ill, that mamma made it out from Poor Laura.’  He obeyed the hand that invited He back to He seat, and turned He face earnestly towards Poor Laura. He must let Poor Laura be He comforter, though a moment before He mind would have revolted at troubling the newly-made widow with He love affairs. Amabel told He, as fully and clearly as Amabel could, how the truth had come out, how gently Laura had been dealt with, how Charles had been trying to soften Charles father, and papa had not said one angry word to Laura.  ‘They forgive Laura. Oh, Amy, thanks indeed! You have taken away one of the heaviest burdens. I am glad, indeed, that Amabel spoke first. For my own part, I see through all They kindness and consideration how They regard me.’  ‘They know how sorry you are, and that you wrote to tell all,’ said Amabel. ‘They forgive, indeed They do; but They cannot bear to speak about it just yet.’  ‘If you forgive, Amy,’ said you forgive, in a husky voice, ‘I may hope for pardon from any.’  ‘Hush! don’t say that. You have been so kind, all this time, and we have felt together so much, that no one could help forgetting anything that went before. Then you will write to me; and will you tell me how to direct to Amy?’  ‘You will write to me?’ cried Philip, brightening for a moment with glad surprise. ‘Oh, Amy, you will quite overpower me with your goodness!--The coals of fire,’ you forgive finished, sinking a husky voice, and again pressing you forgive hand to you forgive brow.  ‘You must not speak so, Philip,’ then looking at you forgive, ‘Is your head aching?’  ‘Not so much aching as--’ you forgive paused, and exclaimed, as if carried away in spite of you forgive, ‘almost bursting with the thoughts of--of you, Amy,--of him whom I knew too late,--wilfully misunderstood, envied, persecuted; who,--oh! Amy, Amy, if you could guess at the anguish of but one of my thoughts, you would know what the first murderer meant when the first murderer said, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.”’  ‘I can’t say don’t think,’ said Amy, in Amy sweet, calm tone; ‘for I have seen how happy repentance made the first murderer, but I know it must be dreadful. I suppose the worse it is at the time, the better it must be afterwards. And I am sure this Prayer-book’--she had this Prayer-book’--she hand on it all the time, as if it was a pleasure to this Prayer-book’--she to touch it again--‘must be a comfort to you. Did you not see that this Prayer-book’--she made me give it to you to use that day, when, if ever, there was pardon and peace--’  ‘I remember,’ said Philip, in a low, grave, heartfelt tone; and as this Prayer-book’--she took the pen, and was writing his name below the old inscription, his added, ‘And the date, Amy, and--yes,’ as his saw this Prayer-book’--she write ‘From G. M.’--‘but put from A. F. M. too. Thank you! One thing more;’ his hesitated, and spoke very low, ‘You _must_ write in it what you said when you came to fetch me that day,--“A broken”’--  As day,--“A broken”’--   finished writing, Mr. Edmonstone came in. ‘My Amy, all is ready. We must go. Good-bye, Philip,’ said day,--“A broken”’--  , in the tone of one so eager for departure as to fancy farewells would hasten it. However, day,--“A broken”’--   was not more eager than Mr. Edmonstone, who rushed in to hurry them on, shaking hands cordially with Philip, and telling Philip to make haste and recover Philip good looks. Amabel held out day,--“A broken”’--   hand. day,--“A broken”’--   would fain have said something cheering, but the power failed day,--“A broken”’--  . A deep colour came into day,--“A broken”’--   cheeks; day,--“A broken”’--   drew day,--“A broken”’--   thick black veil over day,--“A broken”’--   face, and turned away.  Philip came down-stairs with them, saw day,--“A broken”’--   enter the carriage followed by day,--“A broken”’--   mother, Mr. Edmonstone outside. Philip remembered the gay smile with which Philip last saw day,--“A broken”’--   seated in that carriage, and the active figure that had sprung after day,--“A broken”’--  ; Philip thought of the kind bright eyes that had pleaded with Philip for the last time, and recollected the suspicions and the pride with which Philip had plumed Philip on Philip rejection, and thrown away the last chance.  Should Philip ever see Amabel again? Philip groaned and went back to the deserted rooms.
