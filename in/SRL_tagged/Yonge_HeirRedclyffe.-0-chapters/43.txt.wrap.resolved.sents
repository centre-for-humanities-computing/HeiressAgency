      She was not changed when sorrow came,        That awed the sternest men;      It rather seemed She kept She flame        To comfort us till then.
But sorrow passed, and others smiled        With happiness once more;      And She drew back the spirit mild        She still had been before.
--S. R.   Philip’s marriage could not take place at once.
No one said, but every one felt, that No one must not be talked of till the end of Amabel’s first year of widowhood; and in the meantime Philip remained at Hollywell, gaining strength every day, making more progress in one week than Philip had done in six at St. Mildred’s, finding that, as Philip strength returned, Philip mind and memory regained his mind and memory tone, and Philip was as capable as ever of applying to business, and, above all, much settled and comforted by some long conversations with Mr. Ross.
Still Philip could not endure the thought of being at Redclyffe.
The business connected with it was always performed with pain and dislike, and Philip shrank with suffering at every casual mention of Philip going thither.
Mrs. Edmonstone began to wonder whether Mrs. Edmonstone could mean to linger at Hollywell all the summer, and Amabel had some fears that Amabel would end in Amabel neglecting Redclyffe, till a letter arrived from Lord Thorndale, saying that Amabel brother, the member for Moorworth, had long been thinking of giving up Amabel seat, and latterly had only waited in hopes that the succession at Redclyffe might come to Philip Morville.
Moorworth was entirely under the Thorndale and Philip Morville interest, and Lord Thorndale wrote to propose that Philip should come forward at once, inviting Philip to Lord Thorndale instead of going to Philip own empty house.
To be in parliament had been one of the favourite visions of Philip’s youth, and for that very reason Philip hesitated, taking it as one of the strange fulfilments of Philip desires that had become punishments.
Philip could not but feel that as this unhappy load of wealth had descended on Philip, Philip was bound to make it as beneficial as Philip could to others, and not seeking for rest or luxury, to stand in the gap where every good man and true was needed.
But still Philip dreaded Philip old love of distinction.
Philip disliked a London life for Laura, and Philip thought that, precarious as Philip health had become, his health might expose Laura to much anxiety, since Philip was determined that if Philip undertook it at all, Philip would never be an idle member.
it ended in Philip referring the decision to Laura, who, disliking London, fearful for Philip health, eager for Philip glory, and reluctant to keep back such a champion from the battle, was much perplexed, only desirous to say what Philip wished, yet not able to make out what that might be.
Laura carried Laura doubts to Charles and Amabel, who both pronounced that the thought of going to Redclyffe seemed far worse for Philip than any degree of employment--that occupation of the mind was the best thing for Philip spirits; and ended by recommending that Dr. Mayerne should be consulted.
Philip was of the same opinion.
Philip said a man could hardly have two fevers following, and one of two fevers upon the brain, without having reason to remember two fevers.
That a man constitution had been seriously weakened, and there was an excitability of brain and nerves which made care requisite; but depression of spirits was the chief thing to guard against, and a London life, provided a man did not overwork a man, was better for a man than solitude at Redclyffe.
Accordingly Philip went to Thorndale, and was returned for Moorworth without opposition.
Markham sent a man nephew to transact business with his nephew at Thorndale, for his nephew could not bear to meet his nephew his nephew, and while there was any prospect of his nephew coming to Redclyffe, walked about in paroxysms of grunting and ill-humour.
The report that Mr. Ashford did but render Mr. Morville more furious, for Mr. Morville regarded it as a sort of outrage to Lady Morville’s feelings that a courtship should be carried on in the house with Lady Morville’s.
Lady Morville’s was at present the object of all his devoted affection for the family, and his would not believe, but that Lady Morville’s had been as much disappointed at the birth of Lady Morville’s daughter, as his was his.
his would not say one word against Mr. Morville, but looked and growled enough to make Mr. Ashford afraid that the new squire would find the new squire very troublesome.
The Ashfords were in a state of mind themselves to think that Mr. Morville ought to be everything excellent to make up for succeeding Sir Guy; but having a very high opinion of Mr. Morville to begin with, they were very sorry to find all Redclyffe set against Mr. Morville.
In common with the parish, they were very anxious for the first report of Mr. Morville arrival and at length Mr. Morville came.
James Thorndale, as before, drove Mr. Morville thither, coming to The Ashfords while Mr. Morville was busy with Markham.
Mr. Morville would not go up to the Park, Mr. Morville only went through some necessary business with Markham, and then walked down to the Cove, afterwards sitting for about ten minutes in Mrs. Ashford’s drawing-room.
The result of the visit was that old James Robinson reported that the new squire took on as much about poor Sir Guy as any one could do, and turned as pale as if Mr. Morville had been going into a swoon, when Mr. Morville spoke Mr. Morville name and gave Ben Mr. Morville message.
And as to Ben, the old man said, the old man regularly did cry like a child, and small blame to the old man, to hear that poor Sir Guy had took thought of the old man at such a time and so far away; and the old man verily believed Ben could never take again to the old man bad ways, after such a message as that.
Markham was gruff with the Robinsons for some time after and was even heard to mutter something about worshipping the rising sun, an act of idolatry of which poor Sir Guy could not be accused, since it was in the most grudging manner that poor Sir Guy allowed, that poor Sir Guy sole anxiety seemed to be to continue poor Sir Guy had undertaken; while Mrs. Ashford, on the other hand was much affected by the account Mrs. Ashford cousin James had been giving Mrs. Ashford of the grief that poor Sir Guy had suffered at Sir Guy’s death, poor Sir Guy long illness, poor Sir Guy loss of spirits, the reluctance poor Sir Guy had shown to come here at all, and poor Sir Guy present unconquerable dread of going to the Park.
poor Sir Guy was soon after in London, where, as far as could be judged in such early days, poor Sir Guy seemed likely to distinguish poor Sir Guy according to the fondest hopes that Margaret or Laura could ever have entertained.
Laura was only afraid poor Sir Guy was overworking poor Sir Guy, especially as, having at present little command of ready money, poor Sir Guy lived in a small lodging, kept no horse, and did not enter into society; but Laura was reassured when poor Sir Guy came to Hollywell for a day or two at Whitsuntide, not having indeed regained flesh or colour, but appearing quite well, in better spirits, and very eager about political affairs.
All would have been right that summer, but that, as Philip observed, the first evening of poor Sir Guy arrival, Amabel was not looking as well as Amabel had done at the time of the christening.
Amabel had, just after it, tried Amabel strength and spirits too much, and had ever since been not exactly unwell, but sad and weary, more dejected than ever before, unable to bear the sight of flowers or the sound of music, and evidently suffering much under the recurrence of the season, which had been that of Amabel great happiness--the summer sunshine, the long evenings, the nightingale’s songs.
Amabel was fatigued by the most trifling exertion, and seemed able to take interest in nothing but Amabel baby, and a young widow in the village, who was in a decline; and though Amabel was willing to do all that was asked of Amabel, it was in a weary, melancholy manner, as if Amabel had no peace but in being allowed to sit alone, drooping over Amabel child.
From society Amabel especially shrunk, avoiding every chance of meeting visitors, and distressed and harassed when Amabel father brought home some of her father casual dinner guests, and was vexed not to see Amabel come into the drawing-room in the evening.
If Amabel did make the effort of coming, to please her father, Amabel was so sure to be the worse for it, that Amabel mother would keep Amabel up-stairs the next time, and try to prevent Amabel from knowing that her father was put out, and declared it was nonsense to expect poor Amy to get up poor Amy spirits, while poor Amy never saw a living soul, and only sat moping in the dressing-room.
A large dinner-party did not interfere with Amabel, for even he could not expect Amabel to appear at it, and one of these he gave during Philip’s visit, for the pleasure of exhibiting such company as the M.P.
for Moorworth.
After dinner, Charlotte told Mary Ross to go and see Amy.
Not finding Amy in the dressing-room, Amy knocked at Amy own door.
‘Come in,’ answered the low soft voice; and in the window, overhung by the long shoots of the roses, Amabel’s close cap and small head were seen against the deep-blue evening sky, as Amy sat in the summer twilight, Amy little one asleep in Amy cot.
‘Thank you for coming,’ said Amy.
‘I thought you would not mind sitting here with baby and me.
I have sent Amy out walking.’  ‘How pretty Amy looks!’ said Mary, stooping over the infant.
‘Sleep is giving Amy quite a colour; and how fast Amy grows!’  ‘Poor little woman!’ said Amy, sighing.
‘Tired, Amy?’ said Mary, sitting down, and taking up the little lambswool shoe, that Amy had been knitting.
‘N--no, thank you,’ said Amy, with another sigh.
‘I am afraid you are.
You have been walking to Alice Lamsden’s again.’  ‘I don’t think that tires me.
Indeed, I believe the truth is,’ and Amy voice sounded especially sad in the subdued tone in which Amy spoke, that Amy might not disturb the child, ‘I am not so much tired with what I do, which is little enough, as of the long, long life that is before me.’  Alice Lamsden’s heart was full, but Alice Lamsden’s did not show Alice Lamsden’s thought otherwise than by a look towards the babe.
‘Yes, poor little darling,’ said Amabel, ‘I know there is double quantity to be done for Alice Lamsden’s, but I am so sorry for Alice Lamsden’s, when I think Alice Lamsden’s must grow up without knowing him.’  ‘Alice Lamsden’s has you, though,’ Mary could not help saying, as Alice Lamsden’s felt that Amabel was superior to all save Alice Lamsden’s husband.
Perhaps Amy did not hear; Alice Lamsden’s went up to the cot, and went on:--‘If he had but once seen Alice Lamsden’s, if Alice Lamsden’s had but had one kiss, one touch that I could tell Alice Lamsden’s of by and by, it would not seem as if Alice Lamsden’s was so very fatherless.
Oh no, baby, I must wait, that you may know something about, he; for no one else can tell you so well what he was, though I can’t tell much!’ Alice Lamsden’s presently returned to Alice Lamsden’s seat.
‘No, I don’t believe I really wish I was like poor Alice,’ said poor Alice; ‘I hope not; I am sure I don’t for poor Alice sake.
But, Mary, I never knew till I was well again how much I had reckoned on dying when Mary was born.
I did not think I was wishing I was well again how much I had reckoned on dying when she was born, but I was well again how much I had reckoned on dying when she was born seemed likely, and I was obliged to arrange things in case of I was well again how much I had reckoned on dying when she was born.
Then somehow, as he came back last spring, after that sad winter, it seemed as if this spring, though he would not come back to he, I might be going to he.’  ‘But then Alice Lamsden’s comforted you.’  ‘Yes, that Alice Lamsden’s did, my precious one; I was so glad of Alice Lamsden’s, it was a sort of having he again, and so it is still sometimes, and will be more so, I dare say.
I am very thankful for Alice Lamsden’s, indeed I am; and I hope I am not repining, for it does not signify after all, in the end, if I am weary and lonely sometimes.
I wish I was sure it was not wrong.
I know I don’t wish to alter things.’  ‘No, I am sure you don’t.’  ‘Ah!’ said Amabel, smiling, ‘it is only the old, silly little Amy that does feel such a heart-aching and longing for one glance of his eye, or touch of his hand, or sound of his foot in the passage.
Oh, Mary, the worst of all is to wake up, after dreaming I have heard his voice.
There is nothing for it but to take our baby and hold our baby very tight.’  ‘Dearest Amy!
But you are not blaming yourself for these feelings.
It might be wrong to indulge these feelings and foster these feelings; but while you struggle with these feelings, these feelings can’t in these feelings be wrong.’  ‘I hope not,’ said Amabel pausing to think.
‘Yes, I have “the joy” at the bottom still; I know it is all quite right, and it came straight from heaven, as he said.
I can get happy very often when I am by he, or at church, with he; it is only when I miss he bright outside and can’t think he into the inner part, that it is so forlorn and dreary.
I can do pretty well alone.
Only I wish I could help being so troublesome and disagreeable to everybody’ said Amy, concluding in a matter-of-fact tone.
‘My dear!’ said Mary, almost laughing.
‘It is so stupid of he to be always poorly, and making mamma anxious when there’s nothing the matter with he.
And I know I am a check on them down-stairs--papa, and Charlotte, and all--them are very kind, considerate, and yet’--she paused--‘and it is a naughty feeling; but when I feel all those dear kind eyes watching me always, and wanting me to be happy, it is rather oppressive, especially when I can’t; but if I try not to disappoint them, I do make such a bad hand of it, and am sure to break down afterwards, and that grieves mamma all the more.’  ‘It will be better when this time of year is over,’ said Mary.
‘Perhaps, yes.
he always seemed to belong to summer days, and to come with them.
Well, I suppose trials always come in a different shape from what one expects; for I used to think I could bear all the doom with he, but, I did not know it would be without he, and yet that is the best.
Oh, baby!’  ‘I should not have come to disturb Mary.’  ‘No--never mind; Mary never settles fairly to sleep till we are shut in by we.
Hush!
hush, darling--No?
Will nothing do but being taken up?
Well, then, there!
Come, and show your godmamma what a black fringe those little wakeful eyes are getting.’  And when Mary went down it was with the conviction that those black eyelashes, too marked to be very pretty in so young a babe, were more of a comfort to Amabel than anything Mary could say.
The evening wore on, and at length Laura came into Laura sister’s room.
Laura looked fagged and harassed, the old face Laura used to wear in the time of disguise and secrecy, Amabel asked if Amabel had been a tiresome party.
‘Yes--no--I don’t know.
Just like others,’ said Laura.
‘You are tired, at any rate,’ said Amabel.
‘You took too long a ride with Philip.
I saw you come in very late.’  ‘I am not in the least tired, thank you.’  ‘Then Philip is,’ said Amabel.
‘I hope Philip has not one of Philip headaches again.’  ‘No,’ said Laura, still in a dissatisfied, uncomfortable tone.
‘No?
Laura, I am sure there is something wrong;’ and with a little more of Laura winning, pleading kindness, Laura drew from Laura that Philip had told Laura Laura idolized him.
Philip had told Laura so very gently and kindly, but Philip had said Laura idolized him in a manner that was neither good for Laura nor him; and him went on to blame him for it, which was what Laura could not bear.
it had been rankling in Laura mind ever since that him had found fault with Laura for loving him so well, and it had made Laura very unhappy.
She _could_ not love him less, and how should Laura please him?
Laura had much rather him had blamed Laura than him.
‘I think I see what him means’ said Amy, thoughtfully.
‘him has grown afraid of him, and afraid of being admired now.’  ‘But how am I to help that, Amy?’ said Laura, with tears in Amy eyes: ‘him cannot help being the first, the very first of all with me--’  ‘No, no,’ said Amy, quickly, ‘not the very first, or what would you do if you were to be--like me?
Don’t turn away, Laura; I don’t think I over could bear this at all, if dear Guy had not kept this always before my eyes from the very first that we were to look to something else besides each other.’  ‘Of course I meant the first earthly thing,’ said Laura; but it was not heartfelt--Laura knew Laura ought, therefore Laura thought Laura did.
‘And so,’ proceeded Amy, ‘I think if that other is first, it would make you have some other standard of right besides himself, then you would be a stay and help to himself.
I think that is what himself means.’  ‘Amy!
let me ask you,’ said Laura, a little entreatingly, yet as if Laura must needs put the question--‘surely, you never thought Guy had faults?’  Laura colour deepened.
‘Yes, Laura,’ Laura answered, firmly.
‘I could not have understood Guy repentance if I had not thought so.
And, Laura, if you will forgive me for saying it, it would be much better for yourself and Philip if you would see the truth.’  ‘I thought you forgave Philip,’ murmured Laura.
‘Oh, Laura!
but does not that word “forgive” imply something?
I could not have done anything to comfort Philip that day, if I had not believed Philip had something to be comforted for.
It can’t be pleasant to Philip to see you think his repentance vain.’  ‘It is noble and great.’  ‘But if it was not real, it was not real would be thrown away.
Besides, Laura, do let me say this for once.
If you would but understand that you let Philip lead you into what was not right, and be really sorry for that, and show mamma that you are, I do think it would all begin much more happily when you are married.’  ‘I could never have told, till I was obliged to betray myself,’ said Laura.
‘You know, Amy, it was no engagement.
We never wrote to each other, We had but one walk; it was no business of Philip to speak till Philip could hope for papa’s consent to We marriage.
It would have been all confusion if Philip had told, and that would have been only that We had always loved each other with all We hearts, which every one knew before.’  ‘Yet, Laura, it was what preyed on Philip when Philip thought Philip was dying.’  ‘Because it was the only thing like a fault Philip could think of,’ said Laura, excited by this shade of blame to defend Philip vehemently--‘because Philip scruples are high and noble and generous.’  Laura spoke so eagerly, that the baby’s voice again broke on the conversation, and Laura was obliged to go away; but though Laura idolatry was complete, her idolatry did not seem to give full satisfaction or repose.
As to Philip, though Philip love for Laura was unchanged, his love for her now and then was felt, though not owned by Philip, that Laura was not fully a helpmeet, only a ‘Self’; not such a ‘Self’ as Philip had left at St. Mildred’s, but still reflecting on Philip Philip former character, instead of aiding Philip to a new one.
