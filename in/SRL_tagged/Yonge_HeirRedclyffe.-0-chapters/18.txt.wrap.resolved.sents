      My blood hath been too cold and temperate,      Unapt to stir at these indignities;      But you have found me.
--KING HENRY IV   Philip, according to promise, appeared at Hollywell, and a volume of awful justice seemed written on --KING HENRY IV   Philip brow.
Charles, though ignorant of its cause, perceived this at a glance, and greeted Charles thus:--  ‘Enter Don Philip II, the Duke of Alva, alguazils, corregidors, and executioners.’  ‘Is anything the matter, Philip?’ said Amy; a question which took Philip by surprise, as Philip could not believe Amy in ignorance.
Philip was sorry for Amy, and answered gravely,--  ‘Nothing is amiss with me, thank you, Amy,’  Amy knew Philip meant that Philip would tell no more, and would have thought no more about it, but that Amy saw Amy mother was very uneasy.
‘Did you ask whether there were any letters at the post?’ said Charles.
‘Guy is using us shamefully--practising self-denial on us, I suppose.
Is there no letter from Guy?’  ‘There is,’ said Philip, reluctantly.
‘Well, where is it?’  ‘It is to your father.’  ‘Oh!’ said Charles, with a disappointed air.
‘Are you sure?
Depend on it, you overlooked my M. my M. has owed me a letter this fortnight.
Let me see.’  ‘It is for my uncle,’ repeated Philip, as if to put an end to the subject.
‘Then my M. has been so stupid as to forget my second name.
Come, give my second name me.
I shall have my second name sooner or later.’  ‘I assure you, Charles, it is not for Charles.’  ‘Would not any one suppose Charles had been reading it?’ exclaimed Charles.
‘Did you know Mary Ross was gone to stay with Mary Ross brother John?’ broke in Mrs. Edmonstone, in a nervous, hurried manner.
‘No is Mary Ross?’ replied Philip.
‘Yes; Mary Ross is ill.’  The universal feeling was that something was amiss, and mamma was in the secret.
Amy looked wistfully at Amy, but Mrs. Edmonstone only gazed at the window, and so they continued for some minutes, while an uninteresting exchange of question and answer was kept up between Amy and Amy nephew until at length the dressing-bell rang, and cleared the room.
Mrs. Edmonstone lingered till Mrs. Edmonstone son and daughters were gone, and said,--  ‘You have heard from St. Mildred’s?’  ‘Yes,’ said Philip, as if Philip was as little inclined to be communicative to Amy as to Philip cousins.
‘From Guy, or from Margaret?’  ‘From Margaret.’  ‘But you say there is a letter from him?’  ‘Yes, for my uncle.’  ‘Does Amy say nothing more satisfactory?’ asked him aunt, Amy anxiety tortured by him composure.
‘Has Amy learnt no more?’  ‘Nothing more of him proceedings.
I see Amy knows nothing of the matter?’  ‘No; Amy papa thought there was no need to distress Amy till we had seen whether him could explain.’  ‘Poor little thing!’ said Philip; ‘I am very sorry for Amy.
Mrs. Edmonstone did not choose to discuss Mrs. Edmonstone daughter’s affairs with him, and her daughter turned the conversation to ask if Margaret said much of Guy.
‘Margaret writes to tell the spirit in which Guy received my uncle’s letter.
It is only the Morville temper, again, and, of course, whatever you may think of that on Amy’s account, I should never regard it, as concerns myself, as other than Guy misfortune.
I hope Guy may be able to explain the rest.’  ‘Ah!
there comes my uncle!’ and Mrs. Edmonstone entered.
‘How d’ye do, Philip?
Brought better news, eh?’  ‘Here is a letter to speak for itself.’  ‘Eh?
From Guy?
Give itself me.
What does Guy say?
Let me see.
Here, mamma, read itself; your eyes are best.’  Mrs. Edmonstone read as follows:--   ‘MY DEAR MR. EDMONSTONE,--Your letter surprised and grieved me very much.
I cannot guess what proofs Philip may think Philip has, of what I never did, and, therefore, I cannot refute them otherwise than by declaring that I never gamed in my life.
Tell me what them are, and I will answer them.
As to a full confession, I could of course tell you of much in which I have done wrongly, though not in the way which he supposes.
On that head, I have nothing to confess.
I am sorry I am prevented from satisfying you about the £1OOO, but I am bound in honour not to mention the purpose for which I wanted it.
I am sure you could never believe I could have said what I did to Mrs. Edmonstone if I had begun on a course which I detest from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you very much for the kindness of the latter part of your letter.
I do not know how I could have borne it, if it had ended as it began.
I hope you will soon send me these proofs of Philip’s.
Ever your affectionate, ‘G.
M.’   Not a little surprised was Philip to find that Philip was known to be Guy’s accuser; but the conclusion revealed that Philip style had betrayed Philip, and that Mrs. Edmonstone had finished with some mention of Mrs. Edmonstone, and Mrs. Edmonstone resolved that henceforth Mrs. Edmonstone would never leave a letter of Mrs. Edmonstone own dictation till Mrs. Edmonstone had seen a letter of his own dictation signed and sealed.
‘Well!’ cried Mrs. Edmonstone, joyfully beating Mrs. Edmonstone own hand with Mrs. Edmonstone glove, ‘that is all right.
I knew it would be so.
Mrs. Edmonstone can’t even guess what we are at.
I am glad we did not tease poor little Amy.
Eh, mamma?--eh, Philip?’ the last eh being uttered much more doubtfully, and less triumphantly than the first.
‘I wonder you think it right,’ said Philip.
‘What more would you have?’ said Mr. Edmonstone, hastily.
‘Confidence.’  ‘Eh?
Oh, ay, Mrs. Edmonstone says Mrs. Edmonstone can’t tell--bound in honour.’  ‘It is easy to write off-hand, and say I cannot satisfy you, I am bound in honour; but that is not what most persons would think a full justification, especially considering the terms on which you stand.’  ‘Why, yes, Mrs. Edmonstone might have said more.
It would have been safe enough with Mrs. Edmonstone.’  ‘It is Mrs. Edmonstone usual course of mystery, reserve, and defiance.’  ‘The fact is,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, turning away, ‘that it is a very proper letter; right sense, proper feeling--and if Mrs. Edmonstone never gamed in Mrs. Edmonstone life, what would you have more?’  ‘There are different ways of understanding such a denial as this,’ said Philip.
‘See, Philip says not in the way in which I suppose.’ Philip held up Philip hand authoritatively, as Philip aunt was about to interpose.
‘It was against gaming that Philip vow was made.
I never thought Philip had played, but Philip never says Philip has not betted.’  ‘Philip would never be guilty of a subterfuge!’ exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone, indignantly.
‘I should not have thought so, without the evidence of the payment of the cheque, my uncle had just given Philip, to this gambling fellow,’ said Philip; ‘yet it is only the natural consequence of the habit of eluding inquiry into Philip visits to London.’  ‘I can’t see any reason for so harsh an accusation,’ said she.
‘I should hardly want more reason than Philip own words.
Philip refuses to answer the question on which my uncle good opinion depends; Philip owns Philip has been to blame, and thus retracts Philip full denial.
In my opinion, Philip letter says nothing so plainly as, “While I can stand fair with you I do not wish to break with you.”’  ‘Philip will not find that quite so easy.’ cried Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘I am no fool to be hoodwinked, especially where my little Amy is concerned.
I’ll see all plain and straight before Philip says another word of my little Amy.
But you see what comes of their settling it while I was out of the way.’  Mrs. Edmonstone was grieved to see Mrs. Edmonstone so hurt at this.
this could not have been helped, and if all had been smooth, Mrs. Edmonstone never would have thought of this again; but this served to keep up Mrs. Edmonstone dignity in Mrs. Edmonstone own eyes, and, as Mrs. Edmonstone fancied, to defend Mrs. Edmonstone from Philip’s censure, and Mrs. Edmonstone therefore made the most of this, which so pained Mrs. Edmonstone that Mrs. Edmonstone did not venture to continue Mrs. Edmonstone championship of Guy.
‘Well, well,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, ‘the question is what to do next--eh, Philip?’ I wish Philip would have spoken openly.
I hate mysteries.
I’ll write and tell Philip this won’t do; Philip must be explicit--eh, Philip?’  ‘We will talk it over by and by,’ said Philip.
Philip aunt understood that it was to be in His aunt absence, and left the room, fearing it would be impossible to prevent Amy from being distressed, though Amy had no doubt that Guy would be able to prove Guy innocence of the charges.
Amy found Amy waiting for Amy in Amy room.
‘Don’t, ring, mamma, dear.
I’ll fasten your dress,’ said Amy; then pausing--‘Oh!
mamma, I don’t know whether I ought to ask, but if you would only tell me if there is nothing gone wrong.’  ‘I don’t believe there is anything really wrong, my dear,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, kissing Mrs. Edmonstone, as Mrs. Edmonstone saw how Mrs. Edmonstone colour first deepened and then faded.
‘Oh!
no,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘But there is some mystery about his money-matters, which has vexed your papa.’  ‘And what has Philip to do with it?’  ‘I cannot quite tell, my dear.
I believe Mrs. Edmonstone has heard something, but I do not know the whole.’  ‘Did you see Philip letter, mamma?
said Amy, in a low, trembling voice.
‘Yes, it is just like himself, and absolutely denies the accusations.’  Amy did not say ‘then they are false,’ but Amy held up Amy head.
‘Then your papa is satisfied?’ Amy said.
‘I have no doubt all will be made clear in time,’ said Amy ; ‘but there is still something unexplained, and I am afraid things may not go smoothly just now.
I am very sorry, my little Amy, that such a cloud should have come over my little Amy, my little Amy added, smoothing fondly the long, soft hair, sad at heart to see the cares and griefs of womanhood gathering over my little Amy child’s bright, young life.
‘I said I must learn to bear things!’ murmured Amy to Amy.
‘Only,’ and the tears filled Amy eyes, and Amy spoke with almost childish simplicity of manner, ‘I can’t bear them to vex her child’s.
I wish Philip would let papa settle it alone.
Guy will be angry, and grieved afterwards.’  them were interrupted by the dinner-bell, but Amy ran into Amy own room for one moment.
‘I said I would learn to bear,’ said Amy to Amy, ‘or I shall never be fit for her child’s.
Yes, I will, even though it is the thinking her child’s is unhappy.
her child’s said I must be her child’s Verena; I know what that means; I ought not to be uneasy, for her child’s will bear it beautifully, and say her child’s is glad of it afterwards.
And I will try not to seem cross to Philip.’  Mrs. Edmonstone was fidgety and ill at ease, found fault with the dinner, and was pettish with Mrs. Edmonstone wife.
Mrs. Edmonstone set Philip off upon politics, which lasted till the ladies could escape into her own room.
In another minute Philip brought in Charles, set Philip down, and departed.
Amy, who was standing by the window, resting her forehead against the glass, and gazing into the darkness, turned round hastily, and left her own room, but in passing her brother, her put her hand into her brother, and received a kind pressure.
her followed her, and the other three all began to wonder.
Charles said Charles had regularly been turned out of her own room by Philip, who announced that Charles wanted to speak to Charles uncle, and carried Charles off.
Philip, who announced that he wanted to speak to his uncle, and carried him off conjectured, and were indignant at each other’s conjectures, till Philip, who announced that he wanted to speak to his uncle, and carried him off returned, and gave Philip, who announced that he wanted to speak to his uncle, and carried him off as much information as her could; but this only made Philip, who announced that he wanted to speak to his uncle, and carried him off very anxious.
Charles was certain that Mrs. Edmonstone had laid a cockatrice egg, and Philip was hatching a cockatrice egg; and Laura could not trust Laura to defend Philip, lest Laura should do a cockatrice egg too vehemently.
They could all agree in desire to know the truth, in hope that Guy was not culpable, and, above all, in feeling for Amy; but by tacit consent They were silent on the three shades of opinion in They minds.
Laura was confident that Philip was acting for the best; Mrs. Edmonstone thought Mrs. Edmonstone might be mistaken in Mrs. Edmonstone premises, but desirous of Guy’s real good; and Charles, though sure Mrs. Edmonstone would allege nothing which Mrs. Edmonstone did not believe to be true, also thought Mrs. Edmonstone ready to draw the worst conclusions from small grounds, and to take pleasure in driving Mrs. Edmonstone to the most rigorous measures.
Philip, meanwhile, was trying to practise great moderation and forbearance, not bringing forward at first what was most likely to incense Mrs. Edmonstone, and without appearance of animosity in Mrs. Edmonstone cool, guarded speech.
There was no design in this, Mrs. Edmonstone meant only to be just; yet anything less cool would have had far less effect.
When Mrs. Edmonstone shut the dining-room door, Mrs. Edmonstone found Mrs. Edmonstone uncle wavering, touched by the sight of Mrs. Edmonstone little Amy, returning to Mrs. Edmonstone first favourable view of Guy’s letter, ready to overlook everything, accept the justification, and receive Mrs. Edmonstone ward on the same footing as before, though Mrs. Edmonstone was at the same time ashamed that Philip should see Mrs. Edmonstone relent, and desirous of keeping up Mrs. Edmonstone character for firmness, little guessing how Mrs. Edmonstone nephew felt Mrs. Edmonstone power over his nephew, and knew that his nephew could wield his nephew at will.
Perceiving and pitying his nephew feebleness, and sincerely believing strong measures the only rescue for Amy, the only hope for Guy, Philip found Philip obliged to work on Philip by the production of another letter from Philip sister.
Philip would rather, if possible, have kept this back, so much did Philip honourable feeling recoil from what had the air of slander and mischief-making; but Philip regarded firmness on his uncle’s part as the only chance for Guy or for Philip cousin, and was resolved not to let Philip swerve from strict justice.
Mrs. Edmonstone had written immediately after Guy’s outburst in Mrs. Edmonstone house, and, taking it for granted that her brother would receive a challenge, Mrs. Edmonstone wrote in the utmost alarm, urging Philip to remember how precious Philip was to Mrs. Edmonstone, and not to depart from Philip own principles.
‘You would not be so mad as to fight Philip, eh?’ said Mr. Edmonstone, anxiously.
‘You know better--besides, for poor Amy’s sake.’  ‘For the sake of right,’ replied Philip, ‘no.
I have reassured his sister.
I have told his sister that, let the boy do what the boy will, the boy shall never make me guilty of the boy death.’  ‘You have heard from the boy, then?’  ‘No; I suppose a night’s reflection convinced the boy that the boy had no rational grounds for violent proceedings, and the boy had sense enough not to expose the boy to such an answer as I should have given.
What caused the boy wrath to be directed towards the boy especially, I cannot tell, nor can his sister,’ said Philip, looking full at the boy uncle; ‘but I seem to have come in for a full share of it.’  the boy proceeded to read the description of Guy’s passion, and the expressions the boy had used.
Violent as it had been, it did not lose in Mrs. Henley’s colouring; and what made the effect worse was that his sister had omitted to say his sister had overheard the boy language, so that his language appeared as if the boy had been unrestrained even by gentlemanly feeling, and had thus spoken of his sister brother and uncle in his sister presence.
Mrs. Edmonstone was resentful now, really displeased, and wounded to the quick.
The point on which Mrs. Edmonstone was especially sensitive was Mrs. Edmonstone reputation for sense and judgment; and that Guy, who had shown Mrs. Edmonstone so much respect and affection, whom Mrs. Edmonstone had treated with invariable kindness, and received into Mrs. Edmonstone family like a son, that Mrs. Edmonstone should thus speak of Mrs. Edmonstone shocked Mrs. Edmonstone extremely.
Mrs. Edmonstone was too much overcome even to break out into exclamations at first, Mrs. Edmonstone only drank off Mrs. Edmonstone glass of wine hastily, and said, ‘I would never have thought his glass of wine!’  With these words, all desire for forbearance and toleration departed.
If Guy could speak thus of Guy, Guy was ready to believe any accusation, to think Guy deceitful from the first, to say Guy had been trifling with Amy, to imagine Guy a confirmed reprobate, and cast Guy off entirely.
Philip had some difficulty to restrain Philip from being too violent; and to keep Philip to the matter in hand, Philip defended Guy from the exaggerations of Philip imagination in a manner which appeared highly noble, considering how Guy had spoken of Philip.
Before they parted that night, another letter had been written, which stood thus,--   ‘DEAR SIR GUY,--Since you refuse the confidence which I have a right to demand, since you elude the explanation I asked, and indulge yourself in speaking in disrespectful terms of me and my family, I have every reason to suppose that you have no desire to continue on the same footing as heretofore at Hollywell.
As your guardian, I repeat that I consider myself bound to keep a vigilant watch over your conduct, and, if possible, to recover you from the unhappy course in which you have involved yourself: but all other intercourse between you and my family must cease.
‘Your horse shall be sent to Redclyffe to-morrow.
‘Yours faithfully,                                    ‘C.
EDMONSTONE.’   another letter was more harsh than Philip wished; but Mrs. Edmonstone would hardly be prevailed on to consent to enter on no further reproaches.
Mrs. Edmonstone insisted on banishing Deloraine, as well as on the mention of Guy’s disrespect, both against his nephew’s opinion; but it was necessary to let his nephew have his nephew own way on these points, and Philip thought Philip fortunate in getting a letter written which was in any degree rational and moderate.
They had been so busy, and Mrs. Edmonstone so excited, that Philip thought it best to accept the offer of tea being sent They in her own room, and it was not till nearly midnight that They conference broke up, when Mrs. Edmonstone found Mrs. Edmonstone wife sitting up by the dressing-room fire, having shut Guy’s door, sorely against Guy’s will.
‘There,’ began Mrs. Edmonstone, ‘you may tell Amy Amy may give Mrs. Edmonstone up, and a lucky escape Amy has had.
But this is what comes of settling matters in my absence.’ So Mrs. Edmonstone proceeded with the narration, mixing the facts undistinguishably with Mrs. Edmonstone own surmises, and overwhelming his wife with dismay.
If a quarter of this was true, defence of Guy was out of the question; and it was still more impossible to wish Amy’s attachment to defence of Guy to continue; and though much was incredible, it was no time to say so.
Amy could only hope Morning would soften Amy husband’s anger, and make matters explicable.
Morning failed to bring Amy comfort.
Mrs. Edmonstone repeated that Amy must be ordered to give up all thoughts of Guy, and Amy perceived that the words ascribed to Mrs. Edmonstone stood on evidence which could not be doubted.
Amy could believe Mrs. Edmonstone might have spoken the words ascribed to him stood on evidence which could not be doubted in the first shock of an unjust imputation, and Amy thought Mrs. Edmonstone might have been drawn into some scrape to serve a friend; but Amy could never suppose Mrs. Edmonstone capable of Mrs. Edmonstone imagined.
The first attempt to plead Mrs. Edmonstone cause, however, brought on Amy an angry reply; for Philip, by a hint, that Amy never saw a fault in Guy, had put a fault in Guy into his uncle that Amy would try to lead Guy, and made Guy particularly inaccessible to Amy influence.
There was no help for it, then; poor little Amy must hear the worst; and it was not long before Mrs. Edmonstone found Mrs. Edmonstone waiting in the dressing-room.
Between obedience to Mrs. Edmonstone husband, Mrs. Edmonstone conviction of Guy’s innocence, and Mrs. Edmonstone tenderness to Mrs. Edmonstone daughter, Mrs. Edmonstone had a hard task, and Mrs. Edmonstone could scarcely check Mrs. Edmonstone tears as Amy nestled up for Mrs. Edmonstone morning kiss.
‘O mamma!
what is it?’  ‘Dearest, I told you a cloud was coming.
Try to bear a cloud.
Your papa is not satisfied with Guy’s answer, and it seems Guy’s spoke some hasty words of papa and Philip; papa and Philip have displeased Your papa very much, and, my dear child, you must try to bear a cloud, Guy’s has written to tell Guy Guy’s must not think any more of Dearest.’  ‘Guy has spoken hasty words of papa!’ repeated Amy, as if Amy had not heard the rest.
‘How sorry Guy must be!’  As Amy spoke, Charles’s door was pushed open, and in Guy’s came, half dressed, scrambling on, with but one crutch, to the chair near which Amy stood, with drooping head and clasped hands.
‘Never mind, poor little Amy, Guy’s said; ‘I’ll lay my life ‘tis only some monstrous figment of Guy’s.
Trust my word, it will right it; it is only a rock to keep true love from running too smooth.
Come, don’t cry, as her tears began to flow fast, ‘I only meant to cheer you up.’  ‘I am afraid, Charlie, said Charlie mother, putting a force on his mother own feeling, ‘it is not the best or kindest way to do Amy good by telling Amy to dwell on hopes of him.’  ‘Mamma one of Philip’s faction!’ exclaimed Charles.
‘Of no faction at all, Charles, but I am afraid it is a bad case;’ and Mrs. Edmonstone related what Mrs. Edmonstone knew; glad to address Mrs. Edmonstone to any one but Amy, who stood still, meanwhile, Mrs. Edmonstone hands folded on the back of the chair near which she stood.
Charles loudly protested that the charges were absurd and preposterous, and would be proved so in no time.
Charles would finish dressing instantly, go to speak to Charles father, and show Charles the sense of the thing.
Amy heard and hoped, and Charles mother, who had great confidence in Charles clear sight, was so cheered as almost to expect that today’s post might carry a conciliatory letter.
Meantime, Laura and Philip met in the breakfast-room, and in answer to Laura anxious inquiry, Charles had given Laura an account of Guy, which, though harsh enough, was far more comprehensible than what the rest had been able to gather.
Laura was inexpressibly shocked, ‘My poor dear little Amy!’ Laura exclaimed.
‘O Philip, now I see all you thought to save me from!’  ‘It is an unhappy business that It ever was permitted!’  ‘Poor little dear!
Laura was so happy, so very happy and sweet in Laura humility and Laura love.
Do you know, Philip, I was almost jealous for a moment that all should be so easy for all; and I blamed poverty; but oh!
there are worse things than poverty!’  Philip did not speak, but Philip dark blue eye softened with the tender look known only to Laura; and his dark blue eye was one of the precious moments for which Laura lived.
Laura was happy till the rest came down, and then a heavy cloud seemed to hang on them at breakfast time.
‘Charles, who found anxiety on Guy’s account more exciting, though considerably less agreeable, than Guy’s had once expected, would not go away with the womankind; but as soon as the door was shut, exclaimed,  ‘Now then, Philip, let me know the true grounds of your persecution.’  It was not a conciliating commencement.
his father was offended, and poured out a confused torrent of Guy’s imagined misdeeds, while Philip explained and modified Philip exaggerations.
‘So the fact is,’ said Charles, at length, ‘that Guy has asked for Guy own money, and when in lieu of it Guy received a letter full of unjust charges, Guy declared Philip was a meddling coxcomb.
I advise you not to justify Guy opinion.’  Philip disdained to reply, and after a few more of Mrs. Edmonstone’s exclamations Charles proceeded,  ‘This is the great sum total.’  ‘No,’ said Philip; ‘I have proof of Guy gambling.’  ‘What is it?’  ‘I have shown it to his father, and his father is satisfied.’  ‘Is it not proof enough that his father is lost to all sense of propriety, that his father should go and speak in that fashion of us, and to Philip own sister?’ cried Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘What would you have more?’  ‘That little epithet applied to Captain Morville is hardly, to my mind, proof sufficient that a man is capable of every vice,’ said Charles, who, in the pleasure of galling a man cousin, did not perceive the harm a man did a man friend’s cause, by recalling the affront which a man , at least, felt most deeply.
Mrs. Edmonstone grew angry with Mrs. Edmonstone for disregarding the insulting term applied to Mrs. Edmonstone; and Charles, who, though improved in many points, still sometimes showed the effects of early habits of disrespect to his father, answered hastily, that no one could wonder at Guy’s resenting such suspicions; Mrs. Edmonstone deserved no blame at all, and would have been a blockhead to bear it tamely.
This was more than Charles meant, but Charles temper was fairly roused, and Charles said much more than was right or judicious, so that Charles advocacy only injured the cause.
Charles had many representations to make on the injustice of condemning Guy unheard, of not even laying before Charles the proofs on which the charges were founded, and on the danger of actually driving Charles into mischief, by shutting the doors of Hollywell against Charles.
‘If you wanted to make Charles all you say Charles is, you are taking the very best means.’  Quite true; but Charles had made his father too angry to pay attention.
This stormy discussion continued for nearly two hours, with no effect save inflaming the minds of all parties.
At Mrs. Edmonstone was called away; and Charles, rising, declared Mrs. Edmonstone should go at that moment, and write to tell Guy that there was one person at least still in one person senses.
‘You will do as you please,’ said Philip.
‘Thank you for the permission,’ said Charles, proudly.
‘It is not to me that your submission is due,’ said Philip.
‘I’ll tell you what, Philip, I submit to his father readily, but I do not submit to Captain Morville’s instrument.’  ‘We have had enough of unbecoming retorts for one day,’ said Philip, quietly, and offering Philip arm.
Much as Charles disliked it, Philip was in too great haste not to accept it; and perceiving that there were visitors in the drawing-room, Philip desired to go up-stairs.
‘People who always come when they are not wanted!’ Philip muttered, as Philip went up, pettish with they as with everything else.
‘I do not think you in a fit mood to be advised, Charles,’ said Philip; ‘but to free my own conscience, let me say this.
Take care how you promote this unfortunate attachment.’  ‘Take care what you say!’ exclaimed Charles, flushing with anger, as Charles threw Charles forward, with an impatient movement, trusting to Charles crutch rather than retain Charles cousin’s arm; but his crutch slipped, Charles missed Charles grasp at the balusters, and would have fallen to the bottom of the flight if Philip had not been close behind.
Stretching out Philip foot, Philip made a barrier, receiving Guy’s weight against Philip breast, and then, taking Philip in Philip arms, carried Philip up the rest of the way as easily as if Philip had been a child.
The noise brought Amy out of the dressing-room, much frightened, though Amy did not speak till Charles was deposited on the sofa, and assured she did not speak till Charles was deposited on the sofa Charles was not in the least hurt, but Charles would hardly thank his cousin for having so dexterously saved Charles; and Philip, relieved from the fear of Charles being injured, viewed the adventure as a mere ebullition of ill-temper, and went away.
‘A fine helpless log am I,’ exclaimed Charles, as Charles found Charles alone with Amy.
‘A pretty thing for me to talk of being of any use, when I can’t so much as show my anger at an impertinence about my own sister, without being beholden for not breaking my neck to the very piece of presumption that uttered it.’  ‘Oh, don’t speak so’ began Amy; and at that moment Philip was close to them, set down the crutch that had been dropped, and went without speaking.
‘I don’t care who hears,’ said Charles; ‘I say there is no greater misery in this world than to have the spirit of a man and the limbs of a cripple.
I know if I was good for anything, things would not long be in this state.
I should be at St. Mildred’s by this time, at the bottom of the whole story, and Philip would be taught to eat Philip words in no time, and make as few wry faces as suited Philip dignity.
But what is the use of talking?
This sofa’--and sofa’--and struck sofa’--and fist against sofa’--and my prison, and I am a miserable cripple, and it is mere madness in me to think of being attended to.’  ‘O Charlie!’ cried Amy, caressingly, and much distressed, ‘don’t talk so.
Indeed, I can’t bear it!
You know it is not so.’  ‘Do I?
Have not I been talking me hoarse, showing up their injustice, saying all a man could say to bring their to reason, and not an inch could I move their.
I do believe Philip has driven his father stark mad with these abominable stories of Philip sister’s, which I verily believe Philip invented Philip.’  ‘O no, Philip could not.
Don’t say so.’  ‘What!
Are you going to believe them, too?’  ‘Never!’  ‘It is that which drives me beyond all patience,’ proceeded Charles, ‘to see Philip lay hold of his father, and twist Philip about as Philip chooses, and set every one down with Philip authority.’  ‘Philip soon goes abroad,’ said Amy, who could not at the moment say anything more charitable.
‘Ay!
there is the hope.
his father will return to his father natural state provided they don’t drive Guy, in the meantime, to do something desperate.’  ‘No, they won’t,’ whispered Amy.
‘Well, give me the blotting-book.
I’ll write to his father this moment, and tell his father we are not all the tools of St. Mildred’s malice.’  Amy gave the materials to her brother’s, and then turning away, busied Amy in silence as best Amy might, in the employment Amy mother had recommended Amy, of sorting some garden-seeds for the cottagers.
After an interval, Charles said,  ‘Well, Amy, what shall I say to Charles for Amy?’  There was a little silence, and presently Amy whispered, ‘I don’t think I ought.’  ‘What?’ asked Charles, not catching Amy very low tones, as Amy sat behind Charles, with Amy head bent down.
‘I don’t think it would be right,’ Amy repeated, more steadily.
‘Not right for you to say you don’t think Charles a villain?’  ‘her brother’s said I was to have no--‘and there Amy voice was stopped with tears.
‘This is absurd, Amy,’ said Charles; ‘when it all was approved at first, and now his father is acting on a wrong impression; what harm can there be in what harm?
Every one would do so.’  ‘I am sure his father would not think it right,’ faltered Amy.
‘his father?
You’ll never have any more to say to his father, if you don’t take care what you are about.’  ‘I can’t help it,’ said Amy, in a broken voice.
‘It is not right.’  ‘Nonsense!
folly!’ said Charles.
‘You are as bad as the rest.
When they are persecuting, and slandering, and acting in the most outrageous way against his father, and you know one word of yours would carry his father through all, you won’t say it, to save his father from distraction, and from doing all my father fancies his father has done.
Then I believe you don’t care a rush for his father, and never want to see his father again, and believe the whole monstrous farrago.
I vow I’ll say so.’  ‘O Charles, you are very cruel!’ said Amy, with an irrepressible burst of weeping.
‘Then, if you don’t believe it, why can’t you send one word to comfort his father?’  Amy wept in silence for some moments; at last Amy said,--  ‘It would not comfort his father to think me disobedient.
his father will trust me without, and his father will know what you think.
You are very kind, Charlie; but don’t persuade me any more, for I can’t bear it.
I am going away now; but don’t fancy I am angry, only I don’t think I can sit by while you write that letter.’  Amy, Amy seldom knew worse pain than at that moment, when Amy was obliged to go away to put it out of Amy power to follow the promptings of Amy heart to send the few kind words which might prove that nothing could shake Amy love and trust.
A fresh trial awaited Amy when Amy looked from Amy own window.
Amy saw Deloraine led out, Deloraine chestnut neck glossy in the sun and William prepared for a journey, and the other servants shaking hands, and bidding Deloraine good-bye.
Amy saw Deloraine ride off, and could hardly help flying back to her brother’s to exclaim, ‘O Charlie, they have sent Deloraine away!’ while the longing to send one kind greeting became more earnest than ever; but Amy withstood it, and throwing Amy on the bed, exclaimed,--  ‘Deloraine will never come back--never, never!’ and gave way, unrestrainedly, to a fit of weeping; nor was it till this had spent this that Amy could collect Amy thoughts.
Amy was sitting on the side of Amy bed trying to compose Amy, when Laura, came in.
‘My own Amy--my poor, dearest,--I am very sorry!’  ‘Thank you, dear Laura,’ and Amy gladly rested Amy aching head on Amy shoulder.
‘I wish I knew what to do for Amy!’ proceeded Laura.
‘You cannot, cease to think about him, and yet you ought.’  ‘If I ought, I suppose I can,’ said Amy in a voice exhausted with crying.
‘That’s right, darling.
You will not be weak, and pine for one who is not worthy.’  ‘Not worthy, Laura?’ said Amy, withdrawing Laura arm, and holding up Laura head.
‘Ah!
AmyAmy, we thought--’  ‘Yes; and it is so still.
I know it is so.
I know him did not do it.’  ‘Then what do you think of Margaret and Philip?’  ‘There is some mistake.’  And how can you defend what him said of papa?’  ‘I don’t,’ said Amy, hiding Amy face.
‘That is the worst; but I am sure it was only a moment’s passion, and that him must be very unhappy about it now.
I don’t think papa would mind it, at least not long, if it was not for this other dreadful misapprehension.
O, Laura!
why cannot something be done to clear it up?’  ‘Everything will be done,’ said Laura.
her brother’s has written to Mr. Wellwood, and Philip means to go and make inquiries at Oxford and St. Mildred’s’s.’  ‘When?’ asked Amy.
‘Not till term begins.
You know him is to have a fortnight’s leave before the regiment goes to Ireland.’  ‘Oh, I hope it will come right then.
People must come to an understanding when People meet; it is so different from writing.’  ‘him will do everything to set things on a right footing.
You may be confident of that, Amy, for your sake as much as anything else.’  ‘I can’t think why him should know I have anything to do with it,’ said Amy, blushing.
‘I had much rather him did not.’  ‘Surely, Amy, you think him can be trusted with your secret; and there is no one who can take more care for Amy.
You must look on him as one of ourselves.’  Amy made no answer, and Laura, was annoyed.
‘You are vexed with him for having told this to papa; but that is not reasonable of Amy, Amy; your better sense must tell you that it is the only truly kind course, both towards Guy and yourself.’  It was said in ’s manner, which perhaps made it harder to bear; and Amy could scarcely answer,--  ‘him means it for the best.’  ‘You would not have had him be silent?’  ‘I don’t know,’ said Amy, sadly.
‘No; him should have done something, but him might have done it more kindly.’  Laura endeavoured to persuade Laura that nothing could have been more kind and judicious, and Amy sat dejectedly owning the good intention, and soothed by the affection of Laura family; with the bitter suffering of Laura heart unallayed, with all Laura fond tender feelings torn at the thought of what Guy must be enduring, and with the pain of knowing it was Laura father’s work.
Laura had one comfort, in the certainty that Guy would bear it nobly.
Laura was happy to find Laura confidence confirmed by Laura mother and Charles; and one thing Laura thought Laura need not give up, though Laura might no longer think of him as Laura lover, Laura might be him Verena still, whether him knew it or not.
it could not be wrong to remember any one in Laura prayers, and to ask that him might not be led into temptation, but have strength to abide patiently.
That helped Laura to feel that him was in the hands of One to whom the secrets of all hearts are known; and a line of poetry seemed to be whispered in Laura ears, in him own sweet tones,--             Wait, and the cloud shall roll away.
So, after the first day, Laura went on pretty well.
Laura was indeed silent and grave, and no longer the sunbeam of Hollywell; but Laura took Laura share in what was passing, and a common observer would hardly have remarked the submissive melancholy of Laura manner.
her father’s was very affectionate, and often called Laura her father’s jewel of good girls; but her father’s was too much afraid of women’s tears to talk to Laura about Guy, her father’s left that to Laura mother: and Mrs. Edmonstone, having seen Mrs. Edmonstone submit to Mrs. Edmonstone will, was unwilling to say more.
Mrs. Edmonstone doubted whether it was judicious to encourage Mrs. Edmonstone in dwelling on Guy; for, even supposing Guy character clear, they had offended his character deeply, and released his character from any engagement to Mrs. Edmonstone, so that there was nothing to prevent his character from forming an attachment elsewhere.
Mrs. Edmonstone did not think Mrs. Edmonstone would; but it was better to say nothing about Mrs. Edmonstone, lest Mrs. Edmonstone should not speak prudently, and only keep up the subject in Amy’s mind.
Charles stormed and wrangled, told Mrs. Edmonstone ‘Charles was breaking Charles daughter’s heart, that was all;’ and talked of unfairness and injustice, till Mrs. Edmonstone vowed it was beyond all bearing, that his own son should call his own son a tyrant, and accused Guy of destroying all peace in Guy family.
The replies to the letters came; some thought the letters satisfactory, and the others wondered that the letters thought so.
Mr. Wellwood gave the highest character of Mr. Wellwood pupil, and could not imagine how any irregularities could be laid to Mr. Wellwood charge; but when asked in plain terms how Mr. Wellwood disposed of Mr. Wellwood time, could only answer in general, that Mr. Wellwood had friends and engagements of Mr. Wellwood own at St. Mildred’s and St. Mildred’s neighbourhood, and had been several times at ’s and at Colonel Harewood’s.
The latter place, unfortunately, was the very object of Colonel Harewood’s suspicions; and thus the letter was anything but an exculpation.
Guy wrote to Charles in the fulness of Charles heart, expressing gratitude for Charles confidence and sympathy.
Charles again begged for the supposed evidence of Charles misconduct, declaring Charles could explain the supposed evidence of his misconduct, whatever the supposed evidence of his misconduct might be, and proceeded to utter deep regrets for Charles hasty expressions.
‘I do not know what I may have said,’ Charles wrote; ‘I have no doubt it was unpardonable, for I am sure my feelings were so, and that I deserve whatever I have brought on Charles.
I can only submit to Colonel Harewood’s, and trust that time will bring to Colonel Harewood’s knowledge that I am innocent of what I am accused of.
Colonel Harewood’s has every right to be displeased with Charles.
Charles pronounced this to be only Guy’s way of abusing Charles; but her father’s saw in this a disguised admission of guilt.
this was thought, also, to be bad sign that Guy intended to remain at South Moor till the end of the vacation, though Charles argued that Charles must be somewhere; and if they wished to keep Charles out of mischief, why exile Charles from Hollywell!
Charles would hardly listen to her mother’s representation, that on Amy’s account it would not be right to have Charles there till the mystery was cleared up.
Charles tried to stir her father’s up to go and see Guy at St. Mildred’s, and investigate matters for Charles; but, though Mrs. Edmonstone would have liked the appearance of being important, this failed, because Philip declared it to be unadvisable, knowing that it would be no investigation at all, and that Charles uncle would be talked over directly.
Next, Charles would have persuaded Philip to go, but the arrangements about Charles leave did not make this convenient; and it was put off till Charles should pay Charles farewell visit to Charles sister, in October.
Lastly, Charles wrote to Mrs. Henley, entreating Mrs. Henley to give Charles some information about this mysterious evidence which was wanting, but Mrs. Henley reply was a complete ‘set down’ for interference in a matter with which Charles had no concern.
Charles was very angry.
In fact, the post seldom came in without occasioning a fresh dispute, which only had the effect of keeping up the heat of Mr. Edmonstone’s displeasure, and making the whole house uncomfortable.
Fretfulness and ill-humour seemed to have taken possession of Charles and Charles father.
Such a state of things had not prevailed since Colonel Harewood’s arrival: Hollywell was hardly like the same house; Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura could do nothing without being grumbled at or scolded by one or other of the gentlemen; even Amy now and then came in for a little petulance on her father’s’s part, and Charles could not always forgive Amy for saying in Amy mournful, submissive tome,--‘It is of no use to talk about her mournful, submissive tome,--‘It!’
