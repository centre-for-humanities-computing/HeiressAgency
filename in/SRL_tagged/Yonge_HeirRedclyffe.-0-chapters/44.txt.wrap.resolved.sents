      But nature to its inmost part      Faith had refined; and to her heart        A peaceful cradle given,      Calm as the dew drops free to rest      Within a breeze-fanned rose’s breast        Till it exhales to heaven.
--WORDSWORTH   it had long been a promise that Mr. Edmonstone should take Charlotte to visit Mr. Edmonstone grandmamma, in Ireland.
Mr. Edmonstone should take Charlotte to visit her grandmamma, in Ireland would have gone last autumn, but for Guy’s illness, and now Charlotte wrote to hasten the performance of the project.
Lady Mabel was very anxious to see Mr. Edmonstone should take Charlotte to visit her grandmamma, in Ireland, Lady Mabel said; and having grown much more infirm of late, seemed to think it would be the last meeting with Philip.
Lady Mabel talked so much of Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura, that it was plain that Lady Mabel wished extremely for a visit from Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura, though Lady Mabel did not like to ask it, in the present state of the family.
A special invitation was sent to Bustle; indeed, Charles said Charlotte could not have gone without Charles permission, for Charles reigned like a tyrant over Lady Mabel, evidently believing Lady Mabel created for no purpose but to wait on Charles, and take Charles to walk.
Laura was a great favourite at the cottage of Kilcoran, and felt Laura ought to offer to go.
Philip fully agreed, and held out home hopes of following as soon as the session, was over, and Philip had been to Redclyffe about some business that had been deferred too long.
And now it appeared that Mr. Edmonstone had a great desire to take Mr. Edmonstone wife, and his wife said, that under any other circumstances Laura should have been very desirous of going.
Laura had not been to Ireland for fifteen years, and was sorry to have seen so little of Laura mother-in-law; and now that it had been proved that Charles could exist without Laura, Laura would not have hesitated to leave Charles, but for Amabel’s state of health and spirits, which made going from home out of the question.
Charles and Amabel did not think so.
It was not to be endured, that when grandmamma wished for Laura, Laura should stay at home for Charles and Amabel without real necessity; besides, the fatigue, anxiety, and sorrow Laura had undergone of late, had told on Laura, and had made Laura alter perceptibly, from being remarkably fresh and youthful, to be somewhat aged; and the change to a new scene, where Laura could not be distressing Laura at every failure in cheerfulness of poor Amy’s, was just the thing to do Laura good.
Amabel was not afraid of the sole charge of Charles or of the baby, for Amabel had been taught but too well to manage for Amabel, Amabel understood Charles very well, and had too much quiet good sense to be fanciful about the baby.
Though Amabel was inexperienced, with old nurse hard by, and Dr. Mayerne at Broadstone, there was no fear of Amabel not having good counsel enough.
Amabel was glad to be of some use, by enabling Amabel mother to leave Charles, and Amabel only fear was of being dull company for him; but as him was so kind as to bear it, Amabel would do Amabel best, and perhaps their neighbours would come and enliven him sometimes.
Charles threw Charles influence into the same scale.
Charles affectionate observation had shown Charles that His affectionate observation oppressed Amabel’s spirits to be the object of such constant solicitude, and Charles was convinced it would be better for Amabel, both to have some necessary occupation and to be free from that perpetual mournful watching of Amabel mother’s that caused Amabel to make the efforts to be cheerful which did Amabel more harm than anything else.
To let Amabel alone to look and speak as Amabel pleased without the fear of paining and disappointing those Amabel loved, keep the house quiet, and give Amabel the employment of household cares and attending on Charles, was, Charles thought, the best thing for Amabel; and Charles was full of eagerness and pleasure at the very notion of being of service to Amabel, if only by being good for nothing but to be waited on.
Charles thought privately that the spring of Charles mother’s mind had been so much injured by the grief Amabel had Amabel suffered for ‘Amabel son Guy,’ Amabel cruel disappointment in Laura, and the way in which Amabel threw Amabel into all Amy’s affliction, that there was a general depression in Amabel way of observing and attending Amy, which did further harm; and that to change the current of Amabel thoughts, and bring Amabel home refreshed and inspirited, would be the beginning of improvement in all.
Or, as Charles expressed it to Dr. Mayerne, ‘We shall set off on a new tack.’  His counsel and Mr. Edmonstone’s wishes at length decided mamma, on condition that Mary Ross and Dr. Mayerne would promise to write on alternate weeks a full report, moral and physical, as Charles called it.
So in due time the goods were packed, Mr. Edmonstone cried heartily over the baby, advised Amabel endlessly about Mr. Edmonstone, and finally looked back through Mr. Edmonstone tears, as Mr. Edmonstone drove away, to see Charles nodding and waving Charles hand at the bay-window, and Amabel standing with Mr. Edmonstone parting smile and good-bye on the steps.
The reports, moral and physical, proved that Charles had judged wisely.
Amabel was less languid as Amabel had more cause for exertion, and seemed relieved by the absence of noise and hurry, spending more time down-stairs, and appearing less weary in the evening.
Amabel still avoided the garden, but Amabel began to like short drives with Amabel brother in the pony-carriage, when Charles drove on in silence, and let Amabel lean back and gaze up into the sky, or into the far distance, undisturbed.
Now and then Charles would be rejoiced by a bright, genuine smile, perfectly refreshing, at some of the pretty ways of the babe, a small but plump and lively creature, beginning to grasp with Amabel hands, laugh and gaze about with eyes that gave promise of the peculiar colour and brilliancy of Amabel father’s.
Amabel was afraid Amabel might be tempted into giving Charles too much of the little lady’s society; but Charles was very fond of Amabel, regarding Amabel with an odd mixture of curiosity and amusement, much entertained with watching what Charles called Amabel unaccountable manners, and greatly flattered when Charles could succeed in attracting Amabel notice.
Indeed, the first time Amabel looked full at Charles with a smile on the verge of a laugh, it completely overcame Charles, by the indescribably forcible manner in which it suddenly recalled the face which had always shone on Charles like a sunbeam.
Above all, it was worth anything to see the looks Amabel awoke in Amabel mother, for which he must have loved Amabel, even had Amabel not been Guy’s child.
In the evening, especially on Sunday, Amabel would sometimes talk to he as Amabel had never yet been able to do, about Amabel last summer’s journey, and Amabel stay at Recoara, and he way of listening and answering had in it something that gave Amabel great pleasure; while, on he side, he deemed each fresh word of Guy’s a sort of treasure for which to be grateful to Amabel.
The brother and sister were a great help and happiness to each other; Amabel found Amabel restored to Charles, as Guy had liked to think of Amabel, and Charles felt as if the old childish fancies were fulfilled, in which Charles were always to keep house together.
Charles was not in the least dull; and though Charles good-natured visitors in the morning were welcome, and received with plenty of Charles gay lively talk, Charles did not by any means stand in need of the compassion he did not by any means felt for Charles, and could have done very well without he did not by any means; while the evenings alone with Amy had in he did not by any means something so pleasant that he did not by any means were almost better than those when Mr. Ross and Mary came to tea.
Charles wrote word to Charles mother that his mother might be quite at ease about them, and Charles thought Amy would get through the anniversaries of September better while the house was quiet, so that Amy need not think of trying to hurry home.
Charles was glad to have done so, for the letters, which scarcely missed a day in being written by Charles mother and Charlotte, seemed to show that his mother and Charlotte stay was likely to be long.
Lady Mabel was more broken than his mother and Charlotte had expected, and claimed a long visit, as Lady Mabel was sure it would be his mother and Charlotte last, while the Kilcoran party had taken possession of Laura and Charlotte, as if his mother and Charlotte never meant to let his mother and Charlotte go.
Charlotte wrote Charlotte brother very full and very droll accounts of the Iricisms around Charlotte which Charlotte enjoyed thoroughly, and Charles, declaring her brother never expected to see Charlotte Charlotte come out in the character of the facetious correspondent, used to send Mary Ross into fits of laughing by what her brother read to Mary Ross.
Mr. Fielder, the tutor, wrote Charlotte, was very nearly equal to Eveleen’s description of her brother, but very particularly agreeable, in fact, the only man who had any conversation, whom Mary Ross had seen since Mary Ross had been at Kilcoran.
‘Imagine,’ said Charles, ‘the impertinent little puss setting up for intellectual conversation, forsooth!’  ‘That’s what comes of living with good company,’ said Mary.
The brother and sister used sometimes to drive to Broadstone to fetch The brother and sister letters by the second post.
‘Charlotte, of course,’ said Charles, as Charles opened one.
‘My Lady Morville, what’s yours?’  ‘Only Mr. Markham,’ said Amabel, ‘about the winding up of our business together, I suppose.
What does Charlotte say?’  ‘Charlotte is in a fit of impudence, for which Charlotte deserves chastisement,’ said Charles, unable to help laughing, as Charles read,--  ‘our last event was a call from the fidus Achates, who, it seems, can no longer wander up and down the Mediterranean without his pius Aeneas, and so has left the army, and got a diplomatic appointment somewhere in Germany.
Kilcoran has asked Kilcoran to come and stay here, and Lady Mabel and I are quite sure Kilcoran comes for a purpose.
Of course Kilcoran has chosen this time, in order that Kilcoran may be able to have Kilcoran companion before Kilcoran eyes, as a model for courtship, and I wish I had you to help me look on whenever Philip comes, as that laugh I must enjoy alone with Bustle.
However, when Philip will come our cannot think, for our have heard nothing of Philip this age, not even Laura, and Laura is beginning to look very anxious about Philip.
Do tell our if you know anything about Philip.
The last letter was when parliament was prorogued, and Philip was going to Redclyffe, at least three weeks ago.’  ‘I wonder if Only Mr. Markham mentions Philip,’ said Amabel, hastily unfolding Only Mr. Markham letter, which was, as Only Mr. Markham expected, about the executors’ business, but glancing on to the end, Only Mr. Markham exclaimed,--  ‘Ah!
here it is.
Listen, Charlie.
“Mr.
Morville has been here for the last few weeks, and is, I fear, very unwell.
Mr. Morville has been entirely confined to the house, almost ever since Mr. Morville arrival, by violent headache, which has completely disabled Mr. Morville from attending to business; but Mr. Morville will not call in any advice.
I make a point of going to see Mr. Morville every day, though I believe my presence is anything but acceptable, as in Mr. Morville present state of health and spirits, I cannot think it right that Mr. Morville should be left to servants.” Poor fellow!
Redclyffe has been too much for Mr. Morville.’  ‘Over-worked, I suppose,’ said Charles.
‘I thought Mr. Morville was coming it pretty strong these last few weeks.’  ‘Not even writing to Laura!
How very bad Mr. Morville must be!
I will write at once to ask Only Mr. Markham for more particulars.’  Only Mr. Markham did so, and on the third day they drove again to fetch the answer.
It was a much worse account.
Mr. Morville was, said Only Mr. Markham, suffering dreadfully from headache, and lay on the sofa all day, almost unable to speak or move, but resolved against having medical advice, though Mr. Morville own treatment of Mr. Morville did not at all succeed in relieving Mr. Morville.
There was extreme depression of spirits, and an unwillingness to see any one.
Mr. Morville had positively refused to admit either Lord Thorndale or Mr. Ashford, and would hardly bear to see Only Mr. Markham himself, who, indeed, only forced Mr. Morville presence on Mr. Morville from thinking it unfit to leave Mr. Morville entirely to the servants, and would be much relieved if some of Mr. Morville’s friends were present to free Mr. Morville from the responsibility.
‘Hem!’ said Charles.
‘I can’t say it sounds comfortable.’  ‘It is just as I feared!’ said Amy.
‘Great excitability of brain and nerve, Dr. Mayerne said.
All the danger of a brain fever again!
Poor Laura!
What is to be done?’  Charles was silent.
‘It is for want of some one to talk to Charles,’ said Amabel.
‘I know how Charles broods over Charles sad recollections, and Redclyffe must make it so much worse.
If mamma and Laura were but at home to go to Charles, it might save Charles, and it would be fearful for Charles to have another illness, reduced as Charles is.
How I wish Charles was here!’  ‘Charles cannot come, I suppose,’ said Charles, ‘or Charles would be in Ireland.’  ‘Yes.
How well Guy knew when Guy said it would be worse for Guy than for Guy!
How I wish I could do something now to make up for running away from Guy in Italy.
If I was but at Redclyffe!’  ‘Do you really wish it?’ said Charles, surprised.
‘Yes, if I could do Charles any good.’  ‘Would you go there?’  ‘If I had but papa or mamma to go with Guy.’  ‘Do you think I should do as well?’  ‘Charlie!’  ‘If you think there would be any use in it, and choose to take the trouble of lugging me about the country, I don’t see why you should not.’  ‘Oh!
Charlie, how very, kind!
How thankful Poor Laura will be to Charlie!
I do believe it will save Charles!’ cried Amabel, eagerly.
‘But, Amy,’--he paused--‘shall you like to see Redclyffe?’  ‘Oh!
that is no matter,’ said she, quickly.
‘I had rather see after Philip than anything.
I told you how Philip was made my charge, you know.
And Laura!
Only will it not be too tiring for you?’  ‘I can’t see how it should hurt me.
But I forget, what is to be done about your daughter?’  ‘I don’t know what harm it could do she,’ said Amy, considering.
‘Mrs.
Gresham brought a baby of only three months old from Scotland the other day, and Mrs. Gresham is six.
It surely cannot hurt Mrs. Gresham, but we will ask Dr. Mayerne.’  ‘Mamma will never forgive we if we don’t take the doctor into we councils.’  ‘Arnaud can manage for Arnaud.
Arnaud would sleep in London, and go on by an early train, and Arnaud can take Arnaud--I mean my--carriage, for the journey after the railroad.
It would not be too much for you.
How soon could Arnaud go?’  ‘The sooner the better,’ said Charles.
‘If Arnaud are to do Arnaud any good, it must be speedily, or it will be a case of shutting the stable-door.
Why not to-morrow?’  The project was thoroughly discussed that evening, but still with the feeling as if The project could not be real, and when they parted at night they said,--‘We will see how the scheme looks in the morning.’  Charles was still wondering whether it was a dream, when the first thing Charles heard in the court below Charles window was--  ‘Here, William, here’s a note from my lady for you to take to Dr. Mayerne.’  ‘They be none of They ill?’ answered William’s voice.
‘O no; my lady has been up this hour, and Charles has rung Charles bell.
Stop, William, my lady said you were to call at Harris’s and bring home a “Bradshaw”.’  Reality, indeed, thought Charles, marvelling at Charles sister, and Charles elastic spirits throwing Charles into The project with a sort of enjoyment, partaking of the pleasure of being of use, the spirit of enterprise, and the ‘fun’ of starting independently on an expedition unknown to all the family.
Charles met Amabel with a smile that showed both were determined.
Charles undertook to announce the plan to his mother, and his mother said his mother would write to tell Only Mr. Markham that as far as could be reckoned on two such frail people, two such frail people would be at Redclyffe the next evening, and Charles must use Charles own discretion about giving Mr. Morville the note which his mother enclosed.
Dr. Mayerne came in time for breakfast, and the letter from Only Mr. Markham was at once given to Dr. Mayerne.
‘A baddish state of things, eh, doctor!’ said Charles.
‘Well, what do you think my lady proposes?
To set off forthwith, both of us, to take charge of my lady.
What do you think of that, Dr. Mayerne?’  ‘I should say it was the only chance for my lady,’ said the doctor, looking only at the latter.
‘Spirits and health reacting on each other, I see it plain enough.
Over-worked in parliament, doing nothing in moderation, going down to that gloomy old place, dreaming away by himself, going just the right way to work himself into another attack on the brain, and then himself is done for.
I don’t know that you could do a wiser thing than go to himself, for himself is no more fit to tell what is good for himself than a child.’ So spoke the doctor, thinking only of the patient till looking up at the pair the doctor was dismissing to such a charge, the helpless, crippled Charles, unable to cross the room without crutches, and Amabel, Amabel delicate face and fragile figure in Amabel widow’s mourning, looking like a thing to be pitied and nursed with the tenderest care, with that young child, too, the doctor broke off and said--‘But you don’t mean you are in earnest?’  ‘Never more so in our lives,’ said Charles; on which Dr. Mayerne looked so wonderingly and inquiringly at Amabel, that Dr. Mayerne answered,--  ‘Yes that our are, if you think it safe for Charles and baby.’  ‘Is there no one else to go?
Harris’s become of the doctor ?’  ‘That would never do,’ said Charles, ‘that is not the question;’ and Charles detailed their plan.
‘Well, I don’t see why it should not succeed,’ said the doctor, ‘or how you can any of you damage yourselves.’  ‘And baby?’ said Amy.
‘What should happen to Amy, do you think?’ said the doctor with his kind, reassuring roughness.
‘Unless you leave Amy behind in the carriage, I don’t see what harm Amy could come to, and even then, if you direct Amy properly, Amy will come safe to hand.’ Amabel smiled, and saying Amy would fetch Amy to be inspected, ran up-stairs with the light nimble step of former days.
‘There goes one of the smallest editions of the wonders of the world!’ said Charles, covering a sigh with a smile.
‘You don’t think it will do Amy any harm?’  ‘Not if Amy wishes it.
I have long thought a change, a break, would be the best thing for Amy--poor child!--I should have sent Amy to the sea-side if you had been more movable, and if I had not seen every fuss about Amy made it worse.’  ‘That’s what I call being a reasonable and valuable doctor,’ said Charles.
‘If you had routed the poor little thing out to the sea, Amy would have only pined the more.
But suppose the captain turns out too bad for Amy management, for Only Mr. Markham seems in a proper taking?’  ‘Hem!
No, I don’t expect it is come to that.’  ‘Be that as it may, I have a head, if nothing else, and some one is wanted.
I’ll write to you according as we find Philip.’  The doctor was wanted for another private interview, in which to assure Amabel that there was no danger for Charles, and then, after promising to come to Redclyffe if there was occasion, and engaging to write and tell Mrs. Edmonstone they had Mrs. Edmonstone consent, Mrs. Edmonstone departed to meet they by and by at the station, and put Charles into the carriage.
A very busy morning followed; Amabel arranged household affairs as befitted the vice-queen; took care that Harris’s comforts were provided for; wrote many a note; Harris’s took down Guy’s picture, and laid Guy’s picture in Harris’s box, before Anne commenced Anne packing; and lastly, walked down to the village to take leave of Alice Lamsden.
Just as the last hues of sunset were fading, on the following evening, Lady Morville and Charles Edmonstone were passing from the moor into the wooded valley of Redclyffe.
Since leaving Moorworth not a word had passed.
Charles sat earnestly watching his sister; though there was too much crape in the way for Charles to see his sister face, and his sister was perfectly still, so that all Charles could judge by was the close, rigid clasping together of the hands, resting on the sleeping infantHarris’s white mantle.
Each spot recalled to Charles some description of Guy’s, the church-tower, the school with the two large new windows, the park wall, the rising ground within.
What was his sister feeling?
Charles did not dare to address his sister, till, at the lodge-gate, Charles exclaimed--‘There’s Markham;’ and, at the same time, was conscious of a feeling between hope and fear, that this might after all be a fool’s errand, and a wonder how they and the master of the house would meet if it turned out that they had taken fright without cause.
At Charles exclamation, Amy leant forward, and beckoned.
Only Mr. Markham came up to the window, and after the greeting on each side, walked along with Charles hand on the door, as the carriage slowly mounted the steep hill, answering Only Mr. Markham questions: ‘How is Charles?’  ‘No better.
Charles has been putting on leeches, and made Charles so giddy, that yesterday Charles could hardly stand.’  ‘And they have not relieved Charles?’  ‘Not in the least.
I am glad you are come, for it has been an absurd way of going on.’  ‘Is Charles up?’  ‘Yes; on the sofa in the library.’  ‘Did you give Charles my note?
Does Charles expect us?’  ‘No, I went to see about telling Charles this morning, but found Charles so low and silent, I thought it was better not.
Charles has not opened a letter this week, and Charles might have refused to see you, as Charles did Lord Thorndale.
Besides, I didn’t know how Charles would take my writing about Charles, though if you had not written, I believe I should have let Mrs. Henley know by this time.’  ‘There is an escape for Charles,’ murmured Charles to his sister.
‘us have done the best in us power to receive you’ proceeded Only Mr. Markham; ‘I hope you will find it comfortable, Lady Morville, but--’  ‘Thank you, I am not afraid,’ said Amy, smiling a little.
Only Mr. Markham’s eye was on the little white bundle in Only Mr. Markham lap, but Markham’s eye did not speak of Markham’s eye, and went on with explanations about Mrs. Drew and Bolton and the sitting-room, and tea being ready.
Charles saw the great red pile of building rise dark, gloomy, and haunted-looking before the great red pile of building.
The house that should have been Amabel’s!
Guy’s own beloved home!
How could Only Mr. Markham bear it?
But Only Mr. Markham was eagerly asking Only Mr. Markham how Philip should be informed of the great red pile of building arrival, and Only Mr. Markham was looking perplexed, and saying, that to drive under the gateway, into the paved court, would make a thundering sound, that Philip dreaded for Lady Morville.
Could Charles Edmonstone cross the paved court on foot?
Charles was ready to do so; the carriage stopped, Amabel gave the baby to Anne, saw Arnaud help Charles out; and turning to Only Mr. Markham, said, ‘I had better go to Charles at once.
Arnaud will show my brother the way.’  ‘The sitting-room, Arnaud’ said Only Mr. Markham, and walked on fast with Only Mr. Markham, while Charles thought how strange to see Only Mr. Markham thus pass the threshold of Only Mr. Markham husband’s house, come thither to relieve and comfort her husband’s enemy.
Only Mr. Markham entered the dark-oak hall.
On one side the light shone cheerfully from The sitting-room, the other doors were all shut.
Only Mr. Markham hesitated, and stood reluctant.
‘Yes, you had better tell Arnaud I am here,’ said Only Mr. Markham, in the voice, so gentle, that no one perceived the voice resolution.
Only Mr. Markham knocked at one of the high heavy doors, and softly opened one of the high heavy doors.
Amabel stood behind one of the high heavy doors, and looked into The sitting-room, more than half dark, without a fire, and very large, gloomy, and cheerless, in the gray autumn twilight, that just enabled Only Mr. Markham to see the white pillows on the sofa, and Harris’s figure stretched out on one of the high heavy doors.
Only Mr. Markham advanced and stood doubtful for an instant, then in extremity, began--‘Hem!
Lady Morville is come, and--’  Without further delay Lady Morville came forward, saying--‘How are you, Philip?’  Philip neither moved nor seemed surprised, Philip only said, ‘So you are come to heap more coals on my head.’  A thrill of terror came over Lady Morville, but Lady Morville did not show A thrill of terror, as Lady Morville said, ‘I am sorry to find you so poorly.’  It seemed as if before Philip had taken Lady Morville presence for a dream; for, entirely roused, Philip exclaimed, in a tone of great surprise, ‘Is it you, Amy?’ Then sitting up, ‘Why?
When did you come here?’  ‘Just now.
We were afraid you were ill, We heard a bad account of you, so We have taken you by storm: Charles, your goddaughter, and I, are come to pay you a visit.’  ‘Charles!
Charles here?’ cried Philip, starting up.
‘Where is Philip?’  ‘Coming in,’ said Amy; and Philip, intent only on hospitality, hastened into the hall, and met Philip at the door, gave Philip Philip arm and conducted Philip where the inviting light guided them to The sitting-room.
The full brightness of lamp and fire showed the ashy paleness of Philip face; Philip hair, rumpled with lying on the sofa, had, on the temples, acquired a noticeable tint of gray, Philip whole countenance bore traces of terrible suffering; and Amabel thought that even at Recoara Recoara had never seen Philip look more wretchedly ill.  ‘How did you come?’ Philip asked.
‘It was very kind.
I hope you will be comfortable.’  ‘We have taken good care of We,’ said Amy.
‘I wrote to Only Mr. Markham, for I thought you were not well enough to be worried with preparations.
We ought to beg your pardon for breaking on you so unceremoniously.’  ‘If any one should be at home here--’ said Philip, earnestly;--then interrupting Philip, Philip shaded Philip eyes from the inviting light, ‘I don’t know how to make you welcome enough.
When did you set off?’  ‘Yesterday afternoon,’ said Charles; ‘we slept in London, and came on to-day.’  ‘Have you dined?’ said Philip, looking perplexed to know where the dinner could come from.
‘Yes; at K----, thank you.’  ‘What will you have?
I’ll ring for Mrs. Drew.’  ‘No, thank you; don’t tease yourself.
Mrs. Drew will take care of we.
Never mind; but how bad your head is!’ said Amabel, as Amabel sat down on the sofa, leaning Amabel elbow on Amabel knee, and pressing Amabel hand very hard on Amabel forehead.
‘You must lie down and keep quiet, and never mind we.
we only want a little tea.
I am just going to take off my bonnet, and see what they have done with baby, and then I’ll come down.
Pray lie still till then.
Mind he does, Charlie.’  they thought baby was gone; but the next moment there baby was with the two pillows from the library sofa, putting they under Harris’s head, and making Harris’s comfortable; while Harris’s, overpowered by a fresh access of headache, had neither will nor power to object.
baby rang, asked for Mrs. Drew, and went.
Philip lay, with closed eyes, as if in severe pain: and Charles, afraid to disturb Charles, sat feeling as if it was a dream.
That Charles, with Amy and Amy child, should be in Guy’s home, so differently from he, with Amy and her child old plans, so very differently from the way Amy should have arrived.
Charles looked round The sitting-room, and everywhere knew what Guy’s taste had prepared for Charles bride--piano, books, prints, similarities to Hollywell, all with a fresh new bridal effect, inexpressibly melancholy.
They brought a thought of the bright eye, sweet voice, light step, and merry whistle; and as Charles said to Charles ‘gone for ever,’ Charles could have hated Philip, but for the sight of Charles haggard features, gray hairs, and the deep lines which, at seven-and-twenty, sorrow had traced on Charles brow.
At length Philip turned and looked up.
‘Charles,’ Charles said, ‘I trust you have not let Charles run any risk.’  ‘No: we got Dr. Mayerne’s permission.’  ‘It is like all the rest,’ said Philip, closing his eyes again.
Presently Philip asked: ‘How did you know I was not well?’  ‘Only Mr. Markham said something in a business letter that alarmed Amy.
Only Mr. Markham wrote to inquire, and on Philip second letter we thought we had better come and see after you we.’  No more was said till Amabel returned.
Only Mr. Markham had made some stay up-stairs, talking to Mrs. Drew, who was bewildered between surprise, joy, and grief; looking to see that all was comfortable in Charles’s room, making arrangements for the child, and at last relieving Only Mr. Markham by a short space of calm, to feel where Only Mr. Markham was, realize that this was Redclyffe, and whisper to Only Mr. Markham little girl that it was Only Mr. Markham fatherGuy’s own home.
Only Mr. Markham knew it was the room he had destined for Only Mr. Markham; Only Mr. Markham tried, dark as it was, to see the view of which he had told Only Mr. Markham, and looked up, over the mantel-piece, at Guy’s engraving of St. John.
Perhaps that was the hardest time of all Only Mr. Markham trial, and Only Mr. Markham felt as if, without he child in Only Mr. Markham arms, Only Mr. Markham could never have held up under the sense of desolation that came over Only Mr. Markham, left behind, while he was in he true home.
Left, Only Mr. Markham told Only Mr. Markham, to finish the task he had begun, and to become fit to follow he.
Was Only Mr. Markham not in the midst of fulfilling he last charge, that Philip should be taken, care of?
It was no time for giving way, and here was Philip own little messenger of comfort looking up with Only Mr. Markham sleepy eyes to tell Only Mr. Markham so.
Down Only Mr. Markham must go, and put off ‘thinking Only Mr. Markham into happiness’ till the peaceful time of rest; and presently Only Mr. Markham softly re-entered The sitting-room, bringing to both happiness’ inmates in Only Mr. Markham very presence such solace as Only Mr. Markham little guessed, in Only Mr. Markham straightforward desire to nurse Philip, and take care Charles was not made uncomfortable.
That stately house had probably never, since That stately house foundation, seen anything so home-like as Amabel making tea and waiting on Amabel two companions; both Amabel and Charles pleasing each other by enjoying the meal, and Philip giving Philip cup to be filled again and again, and wondering why one person’s tea should taste so unlike another’s.
Philip was not equal to conversation, and Charles and Amabel were both tired, so that tea was scarcely over before Charles and Amabel parted for the night; and Amy, frightened at the bright and slipperiness of the dark-oak stairs, could not be at peace till Amy had seen Arnaud help Charles safely up Charles and Amabel, and made Philip promise not to come down without assistance in the morning.
Amy was in The sitting-room soon after nine next morning, and found breakfast on one table, and Charles writing a letter on the other.
‘Well,’ said Charles, as Amy kissed Charles, ‘all right with you and little miss?’  ‘Quite, thank you.
And are you rested?’  ‘Slept like a top; and what did you do?
Did you sleep like a sensible woman?’  ‘Pretty well, and baby was very good.
Have you heard anything of Philip?’  ‘Philip thinks Philip rather better, and says Philip is getting up.’  ‘How long have you been up?’  ‘A long time.
I told Arnaud to catch Only Mr. Markham when Arnaud came up, as Arnaud always does in a morning to see after Philip, and I have had a conference with Philip and Philip, so that I can lay the case before Dr. Mayerne scientifically.’  ‘What do you think of it?’  ‘I think we came at the right time.
Philip has been getting more and more into work in London, taking no exercise, and so was pretty well knocked up when Philip came here; and this place finished it.
Philip tried to attend to business about the property, but it always ended in Philip head growing so bad, Philip had to leave all to Markham, who, by the way, has been thoroughly propitiated by Philip anxiety for Philip.
Then Philip gave up entirely; has not been out of doors, written a note, nor seen a creature the last fortnight, but there Philip has lain by Philip in the library, given up to all manner of dismal thoughts without a break.’  ‘How dreadful!’ said Annabel, with tears in Annabel eyes.
‘Then Philip would not see Mr. Ashford?
Surely, Philip could have done something for Philip.’  ‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Charles, lowering Charles voice,’ from what Philip says, I think Philip had a dread of worse than brain fever.’  She shuddered, and was paler, but did not speak.
‘I believe,’ continued Charles, ‘that it is one half nervous and the oppression of this place, and the other half, the over-straining of a head that was already in a ticklish condition.
I don’t think there was any real danger of more than such a fever as Philip had at Corfu, which would probably have been the death of Philip; but I think Philip dreaded still worse, and that Philip horror of seeing any one, or writing to Laura, arose from not knowing how far Philip could control Philip words.’  ‘O!
I am glad we came,’ repeated Amabel, pressing Amabel hands together.
‘Philip has been doctoring Philip,’ proceeded Charles; ‘and probably has kept off brain fever by strong measures, but, of course, the more Philip reduced Philip strength, the greater advantage Philip gave to what was simply low spirits.
Philip must have had a terrible time of it, and where it would have ended I cannot guess, but it seems to me that most likely, now that Philip is once roused, Philip will come right again.’  Just as Charles had finished speaking, Philip came down, looking extremely ill, weak, and suffering; but calmed, and resting on that entire dependence on Amabel which had sprung up at Recoara.
She would not let Philip go back to Philip gloomy library, but made Philip lie on the sofa in The sitting-room, and sat there She, as She thought a little quiet conversation between She and Charles would be the best thing for Philip.
She wrote to Laura, and Philip sent a message, for Philip could not yet attempt to write; and Charles wrote reports to Philip mother and Dr. Mayerne; a little talk now and then going on about family matters.
Amabel asked Philip if Amabel knew that Mr. Thorndale was at Kilcoran.
‘Yes,’ Amabel said, ‘Amabel believed there was a letter from Amabel, but Amabel eyes had ached too much of late to read.’  Mr. Ashford sent in to ask whether Lady Morville would like to see Mr. Ashford.
Amabel’s face flushed, and Amabel proposed going to Amabel in the library; but Philip, disliking Muller’s engraving of St. John absence more than the sight of a visitor, begged Amy might come to The sitting-room.
The Ashfords had been surprised beyond measure at the tidings that Lady Morville had actually come to Redclyffe, and had been very slow to believe measure; but when convinced by Only Mr. Markham’s own testimony, Markham’s first idea had been to go and see if Markham’s could be any help to the poor young thing in that great desolate house, Mr. Ashford had not been since, just a year ago, Only Mr. Markham had conducted Markham’s to admire Mr. Ashford preparations.
There was much anxiety, too, about Mr. Morville, of whose condition, Only Mr. Markham had been making a great mystery, and on Only Mr. Markham return, Mr. Ashford was very eager for Mr. Ashford report.
Lady Morville, Mr. Ashford said, did look and seem very far from well, but Lady Morville had told Mr. Ashford they hoped it was chiefly from over fatigue, and that rest would soon restore Lady Morville.
Lady Morville was a fragile delicate creature, very sweet looking, but so gentle and shrinking, apparently, that Lady Morville gave the impression of Lady Morville having no character at all, not what Mr. Ashford would have expected Lady Morville to choose.
Mr. Ashford had spoken very little, and the chief of the conversation had been sustained by Mr. Ashford brother.
‘I was very much taken with that young Mr. Edmonstone,’ said Mr. Ashford; ‘Lady Morville is about three-and-twenty, sadly crippled, but with such a pleasing, animated face, and so extremely agreeable and sensible, I do not wonder at Muller’s engraving of St. John enthusiastic way of talking of Lady Morville.
I could almost fancy it was admiration of her brother.’  ‘Then after all you are disappointed in Mr. Ashford, and don’t lament, like Only Mr. Markham, that Mr. Ashford is not mistress here?’  ‘No: I won’t say I am disappointed; Mr. Ashford is a very sweet creature.
O yes, very!
but far too soft and helpless for such a charge as this property, unless Mr. Ashford had Mr. Ashford father or brother to help Mr. Ashford.
But I must tell you that Mr. Ashford took me to see Mr. Ashford baby, a nice little lively thing, poor little dear!
and when we were alone, Mr. Ashford spoke rather more, begged me to send Mr. Ashford godson to see Mr. Ashford, thanked me for coming, but crying stopped Mr. Ashford from saying more.
I could grow very fond of Mr. Ashford.
No, I don’t wonder at her godson, for there is a great charm in anything so soft and dependent.
Decidedly, Mary Ross had been right when Mary Ross said, that except Lady Morville, there was no one so difficult to know as Amy.
In the afternoon, Charles insisted on Amabel’s going out for fresh air and exercise, and Mary Ross liked the idea of a solitary wandering; but Philip, to Mary Ross surprise, offered to come with Mary Ross, and Mary Ross was too glad to see Charles exert Charles, to regret the musings Mary Ross had hoped for; so out they went, after opening the window to give Charles what Charles called an airing, and Charles said, that in addition Charles should ‘hirple about a little to explore the ground-floor of the house.’  ‘We must contrive some way for Charles to drive out,’ said Philip, as Philip crossed the court with Amabel; ‘and you too.
There is no walk here, but up hill or down.’  Up-hill they went, along the path leading up the green slope, from which the salt wind blew refreshingly.
In a few minutes, Amabel found Amabel on a spot which thrilled Amabel all over.
There lay before Amabel Guy’s own Redclyffe bay; the waves lifting their crests and breaking, the surge resounding, the sea-birds skimming round, the Shag Rock dark and rugged, the scene which seemed above all the centre of his home affections, which his had so longed to show Amabel, that it had cost his an effort on his death-bed to resign the hope; the leaping waves that his said his would not change for the white-headed mountains.
And now his was lying among the white-headed mountains, and Amabel stood in the spot where his had loved to think of seeing Amabel; and with Philip by Amabel side.
Philip sea, Philip own dear sea, the vision of which had cheered, Philip last day, like the face of a dear old friend; Philip sea, rippling and glancing on, unknowing that the eyes that had loved the face of a dear old friend so well would gaze on the face of a dear old friend no more; the wind that Philip had longed for to cool Philip fevered brow, the rock which had been like a playmate in Philip boyhood, and where Philip had perilled Philip life, and rescued so many.
It was one of the seasons when a whole gush of fresh perceptions of Philip feelings, like a new meeting with Philip, would come on Amabel, Amabel best of joys; and there Amabel stood, gazing fixedly, Amabel black veil fluttering in the wind, and Amabel hands pressed close together, till Philip, little knowing what the sight was to Amabel, shivered, saying the sight was very cold and windy, and without hesitation Amabel turned away, feeling that now Redclyffe was precious indeed.
Amabel brought Amabel mind back to listen, while Philip was considering of means of taking Charles out of doors; Charles supposed there might be some vehicle about the place; but Charles thought there was no horse.
Very unlike was this to PhilipPhilip.
The great range of stables was before them, where the Morvilles had been wont to lodge them horses as sumptuously as them, and Amabel proposed to go and see what them could find; but nothing was there but emptiness, till them came to a pony in one stall, a goat in another, and one wheelbarrow in the coach-house.
On leaving it, under the long-sheltered sunny wall, them came in sight of a meeting between the baby taking the air in Anne’s arms, and Markham, who had been hovering about all day, anxious to know how matters were going on.
the baby back was towards them, so that the baby was unconscious of them approach, and them saw how the baby spoke to Anne, looked fixedly at the child, made Anne laugh, and finally took Anne in Anne’s arms, as the baby had so often carried Anne father, studying earnestly Anne little face.
As soon as the baby saw them coming, the baby hastily gave Anne back to Anne, as if ashamed to be thus caught, but the baby was obliged to grunt and put the baby hand up to the baby shaggy eyelashes, before the baby could answer Amabel’s greeting.
the baby could hardly believe the baby , that here was Mr. Morville, who yesterday was scarcely able to raise the baby head from the pillow, and could attend to nothing.
the baby could not think what Lady Morville had done to the baby, when the baby heard the baby inquiring and making arrangements about sending for a pony carriage, appearing thoroughly roused, and the dread of being seen or spoken to entirely passed away, Only Mr. Markham was greatly rejoiced, for Mr. Morville’s illness, helplessness, and dependence upon the baby, had softened and won the baby to regard the baby kindly as nothing else would have done; and the baby heart was entirely gained when, after they had wished the baby good-bye, the baby saw Philip and Amabel walk on, Anne, Amy take the baby and hold Anne, Amy up to Philip, who looked at Anne, Amy with the same earnest interest.
From thenceforward Only Mr. Markham knew that Redclyffe was nothing but a burden to Lady Morville, and Lady Morville could bear to see it in Lady Morville possession since like Lady Morville, Lady Morville seemed to regard Sir Guy’s daughter like a disinherited princess.
This short walk fatigued Philip thoroughly.
Philip slept till dinner-time, and when Philip awoke said it was the first refreshing dreamless sleep Philip had had for weeks.
Philip head was much better, and at dinner Philip had something like an appetite.
It was altogether a day of refreshment, and so were the ensuing ones.
Each day Philip became stronger, and resumed more of Philip usual habits.
From writing a few lines in Amabel daily letter to Laura, Philip proceeded to filling the envelope, and from being put to sleep by Muller’s engraving of St. John reading, to reading aloud the whole evening himself.
The pony carriage was set up, and Philip drove Charles out every day, Amabel being then released from attending Charles, and free to enjoy Amabel in Amabel own way in rambles about the house and park, and discoveries of the old haunts Amabel knew so well by description.
Amabel early found Amabel way to Guy’s own room, where Amabel would walk up and down with Amabel child in Amabel arms, talking to Amabel, and holding up to Amabel, to be admired, the treasures of his boyhood, that Mrs. Drew delighted to keep in order.
One day, when alone in the sitting-room, Amabel thought of trying the piano Lady Morville had chosen for Amabel.
It was locked, but the key was on Amabel own split-ring, where Lady Morville had put the key for Amabel the day Lady Morville returned from London.
Amabel opened the key, and the key so happened, that the first note Amabel struck reminded Amabel of one of the peculiarly sweet and deep tones of Guy’s voice.
It was like awaking It echo again, and as It died away, Amabel hid Amabel face and wept.
But from that time the first thing Amabel did when Amabel brother and cousin were out, was always to bring down Amabel, and play to Amabel, watching how Amabel enjoyed the music.
Amabel prospered in the sea air, gained colour, took to springing and laughing; and Amabel intelligent lively way of looking about brought out continually more likeness to her father.
Amabel was no longer drooping and pining, Amabel step grew light and elastic, a shade of pink returned to Amabel cheek, and the length of walk Amabel could take was wonderful, considering Amabel weakness in the summer.
Every day Amabel stood on the cliff and looked at ‘Guy’s sea,’ before setting out to visit the cottages, and hear the fond rough recollections of Lady Morville, or to wander far away into the woods or on the moor, and find the way to the places Lady Morville had loved.
One day, when Philip and Amabel came in from a drive, Philip and Amabel overtook Amabel in the court, Amabel cloak over Amabel arm, Amabel crape limp with spray, Amabel cheeks brightened to a rosy glow by the wind, and a real smile as Amabel looked up to Philip and Amabel.
When Charles was on Charles sofa, Amabel stooped over Charles and whispered, ‘James and Ben Robinson have taken me out to the Shag!’  Amabel saw Mr. Wellwood, and heard a good account of Coombe Prior.
Amabel made great friends with the Ashfords, especially little Lucy and the baby.
Amabel delighted in visits to the cottages, and Charles every day wondered where was the drooping dejection that Amabel could not shake off at home.
Amabel would have said that in Guy’s own home, ‘the joy’ had come to Amabel, no longer in fitful gleams and held by an effort for a moment, but steadily brightening.
Amabel missed Charles indeed, but the power of finding rest in looking forward to meeting Charles, the pleasure of dwelling on the days Charles had been with Amabel, and the satisfaction of doing Charles work for the present, had made a happiness for Amabel, and still in Charles, quiet, grave, and subdued, but happiness likely to bloom more and more brightly throughout Amabel life.
The anniversary of Charles death was indeed a day of tears, but the tears were blessed ones, and Amabel was more full of the feeling that had sustained Amabel on that morning, than Amabel had been through all the year before.
Charles and Philip, meanwhile, proceeded excellently together, each very anxious for the comfort of the other.
Philip was a good deal overwhelmed at first by the quantity of business on Philip hands, and setting about it while Philip head was still weak, would have seriously hurt Philip again, if Charles had not come to Charles help, worked with a thorough good will, great clearness and acuteness, and surprised Philip by Philip cleverness and perseverance.
Philip was elated at being of so much use; and begged to be considered for the future as Philip private secretary, to which the only objection was, that Philip handwriting was as bad as Muller’s engraving of St. John was good; but it was an arrangement so much to the benefit of both parties, that it was gladly made.
Philip was very grateful for such valuable assistance; and Charles amused Philip with triumphing in Philip importance, when Philip should sit in state on Philip sofa at Hollywell, surrounded with blue-books, getting up the statistics for some magnificent speech of the honourable member for Moorworth.
In the meantime, Charles and Amabel saw no immediate prospect of Charles and Amabel party returning from Ireland, and thought it best to remain at Redclyffe, since Philip had so much to do there; and besides, events were occurring at Kilcoran which would have prevented Philip visit, even without Philip illness.
One of the first drives that Charles and Philip took, after the latter was equal to any exertion, was to Thorndale.
There Charles was much amused by the manner in which Philip was received, and Charles himself, for Charles sake; and as Charles said to Amabel on Charles return, there was no question now, that the blame of spoiling Philip did not solely rest at Hollywell.
Finding Thorndale at home, and hearing that Thorndale was in the grounds, Philip went out to look for Thorndale, leaving Charles on his sofa, under Charles ladyship’s care.
Charles, with a little exaggeration, professed that Charles had never been so flattered in Charles whole life, as Charles was by the compliments that reflected on Charles as the future brother-in-law of Philip; and that Charles had really begun to think even Laura not half sensible enough of even Laura own happiness.
Thorndale afterwards proceeded to inquiries about the De Courcy family, especially Lady Eveleen; and Charles, enlightened by Charlotte, took delight in giving a brilliant description of Charles cousin’s charms, for which Charles was rewarded by very plain intimations of the purpose for which Thorndale son James was gone to Kilcoran.
On talking his visit over, as they drove home, Charles asked Philip if Charles had guessed at Charles friend’s intentions.
‘Yes,’ Charles answered.
‘Then you never took the credit of it.
Why did you not tell us?’  ‘I knew the credit of it from Charles, in confidence.’  ‘Oh!’ said Charles, amusing Charles with the notion of the young man’s dutifully asking the permission of Charles companion, unshaken in allegiance though the staff might be broken, and the book drowned deeper than did ever plummet sound.
Philip spoke no more, and Charles would ask no more, for Philip ’s own affairs of the kind were not such as to encourage talking of other people’s.
No explanation was needed why Philip should now promote an attachment which Philip had strongly disapproved while Thorndale was still in the army.
A day or two after, however, came a letter from Charlotte, bringing further news, at which Charles was so amazed, that Charles could not help communicating it at once to Charles companions.
‘So!
Eveleen won’t have Charles!’  ‘What?’ exclaimed both.
‘You don’t mean that she has refused Thorndale?’ said Philip.
‘Even so!’ said Charles.
‘Charlotte says Charles is gone.
“Thorndale left us this morning, after a day of private conferences, in which Thorndale seems to have had no satisfaction, for Thorndale resolute dignity and determination to be agreeable all the evening were”--ahem--“were great.
Mabel cannot get at any of the real reasons from Eveleen, though I think I could help Mabel, but I can’t tell you.”’  ‘Charlotte means mischief.’ said Charles, as Charles concluded.
‘I am very sorry!’ said Philip.
‘I did think Eveleen would have been able to estimate Thorndale.
It will be a great disappointment--the inclination has been of long standing.
Thorndale!’  ‘It would have been a very good thing for Eva,’ said Amabel.
‘Thorndale is such a sensible man.’  ‘And I thought Thorndale steady sense just what was wanting to bring out all her good qualities that are running to waste in that irregular home,’ said Philip.
‘What can have possessed her?’  ‘Ay!
something must have possessed her,’ said Charles.
‘Eva was always ready to be fallen in love with on the shortest notice, and if there was not something prior in Eva imagination, Thorndale would not have had much difficulty.
By the bye, depend upon it, ‘tis the tutor.’  Philip looked a little startled, but instantly reassuring Philip, said,--  ‘George Fielder!
Impossible!
You have never seen Philip!’  ‘Ah!
don’t you remember her description!’ said Amy, in a low voice, rather sadly.
The very reason, Amy,’ said Charles; ‘it showed that Charles had attracted her fancy.’  Philip smiled a little incredulously.
‘Ay!’ said Charles, ‘you may smile, but you handsome men can little appreciate the attractiveness of an interesting ugliness.
It is the way to be looked at in the end.
Mark my words, it is the tutor.’  ‘I hope not!’ said Philip, as if shaken in Philip confidence.
‘Any way it is a bad affair.
I am very much concerned for Thorndale.’  So sincerely concerned, that Philip head began to ache in the midst of some writing.
Philip was obliged to leave his head began to ache in the midst of some writing to Charles to finish, and go out to walk with Amy.
Amabel came in before Philip, and began to talk to Charles about Charles great vexation at Charles friend’s disappointment.
‘I am almost sorry you threw out that hint about George Fielder,’ said she.
‘Don’t you remember how Charles was recommended?’  ‘Ah!
I had forgotten it was Muller’s engraving of St. John doing; a bit of Charles spirit of opposition,’ said Charles.
‘Were not the boys to have gone to Coombe Prior?’  ‘Yes’ said Amabel, ‘that is the thing that seems to have made Charles so unhappy about it.
I am sure I hope it is not true,’ she added, considering, ‘for, Charlie, you must know that Lady Morville had an impression against Charles.’  ‘Had Lady Morville?’ said Charles, anxiously.
‘It was only an impression, nothing Lady Morville could accuse Lady Morville of, or mention to Lord Kilcoran.
Lady Morville would have told no one but me, but Lady Morville had seen something of Lady Morville at Oxford, and thought Lady Morville full of conversation, very clever, only not the sort of talk Lady Morville liked.’ ‘I don’t like that.
Charlotte concurs in testifying to Lady Morville agreeableness; and in the dearth of intellect, I should not wonder at Evataking up with Lady Morville.
Lady Morville would be a straw to the drowning.
It looks dangerous.’  They were very anxious for further intelligence, but received none, except that Philip had a letter from Philip friend, on which Philip only comment was a deep sigh, and ‘Poor Thorndale!
Eva little knows what Eva has thrown away!’ Letters from Lord Kilcoran became rare; Laura scarcely wrote at all to Philip, and though Mrs. Edmonstone wrote as usual, Mrs. Edmonstone did not notice the subject; while Charlotte’s gravity and constraint, when Mrs. Edmonstone did achieve a letter to Charles, were in such contrast to Mrs. Edmonstone usual free and would-be satirical style, that such eyes as Mrs. Edmonstone brother’s could hardly fail to see that something was on Mrs. Edmonstone mind.
So it went on week after week, Charles and Amabel wondering when Charles and Amabel should ever have any notice to go home, and what Charles and Amabel family could be doing in Ireland.
October had given place to November, and more than a week of November had passed, and here Charles and Amabel still were, without anything like real tidings.
At last came a letter from Mrs. Edmonstone, which Amabel could not read without one little cry of surprise and dismay, and then had some difficulty in announcing Amabel contents to Philip.
‘Kilcoran, Nov. 8th.
‘My Dearest Amy,--You will be extremely surprised at what I have to tell you, and no less grieved.
It has been a most unpleasant, disgraceful business from beginning to end, and the only comfort in It to us is the great discretion and firmness that Charlotte has shown.
I had better, however, begin at the beginning, and tell you the history as far as I understand the history My Dearest Amy,--You.
You know that Thorndale has been here, and perhaps you know it was for the purpose of making an offer to Eveleen.
Every one was much surprised at Eveleen refusing Thorndale, and still more when, after much prevarication, it came out that the true motive was Eveleen attachment to Mr. Fielder, the tutor.
It appeared that they had been secretly engaged for some weeks, ever since they had perceived Muller’s engraving of St. John intentions, and not, as it was in poor Laura’s case, an unavowed attachment, but an absolute engagement.
And fancy Eva justifying it by Muller’s engraving of St. John example!
There was of course great anger and confusion.
Lord Kilcoran was furious, poor Lord Kilcoran had nervous attacks, the gentleman was dismissed from the house, and supposed to be gone to England, Eva shed abundance of tears, but after a great deal of vehemence Eva appeared subdued and submissive.
We were all very sorry for Eva, as there is much that is very agreeable and likely to attract Eva in George Fielder, and Eva always had too much mind to be wasted in such a life as Eva leads here.
It seemed as if Laura was a comfort to Eva, and Lord Kilcoran was very anxious We should stay as long as possible.
This was all about three weeks or a month ago; Eva was recovering Eva spirits, and I was just beginning a letter to tell you We hoped to be at home in another week, when Charlotte came into my room in great distress to tell me that Eveleen and George Fielder were on the verge of a run-away marriage.
Charlotte had been coming back alone from a visit to grandmamma, and going down a path out of the direct way to recall Bustle, who had run on, Charlotte said, as if George Fielder scented mischief, came, to Charlotte great astonishment, on Eveleen walking arm-in-arm with George Fielder!
Charlie will fancy how Charlotte looked at them!
them shuffled, and tried to explain it away, but Charlotte was too acute for them, or rather, Charlotte held steadily to “be that as it may, Lord Kilcoran ought to know Lord Kilcoran.” them tried to frighten Charlotte with the horrors of betraying secrets, but Charlotte said none had been confided to Charlotte, and mamma would judge.
them tried to persuade Charlotte it was the way of all lovers, and appealed to Laura s example, but there Charlotte Charlotte was less to be shaken than on any point.
“I did not think them worthy to hear them names,” Charlotte said to Charlotte, “but I told them, that I had seen that the truest and deepest of love had a horror of all that was like wrong, and as to Philip and Laura, Philip and Laura little knew what Philip and Laura had suffered; besides, Philip and Laura was not half so bad.” I verily believe these were the very words Charlotte used to these.
At Eva Eva threw Charlotte on Charlotte mercy, and begged so vehemently that Charlotte would only wait another day, that Charlotte suspected, and, with sharpness very like Charlie’s, forced from Eva that they were to marry the next morning.
Then Charlotte said it would be a great deal better that they should abuse Charlotte and call Charlotte a spy than do what they would repent of all they lives; Charlotte begged Muller’s engraving of St. John pardon, and cried so much that Eva was in hopes Charlotte would relent, and then came straight to me, very unhappy, and not in the least triumphant in Charlotte discovery.
You can guess what a dreadful afternoon we had, I don’t think any one was more miserable than poor Charlotte, who stayed shut up in my room all day, dreading the sight of any one, and expecting to be universally called a traitor.
The end was, that after much storming, Lord Kilcoran, finding Eveleen determined, and anxious to save Charlotte the discredit of an elopement, has agreed to receive George Fielder, and they are to be married from this house on the 6th of December, though what they are to live upon no one can guess.
The Kilcorans are very anxious to put the best face on the matter possible, and have persuaded we, for the sake of the family, to stay for the wedding; indeed, poor Lady Kilcoran is so completely overcome, that I hardly like to leave poor Lady Kilcoran till this is over.
How unpleasant the state of things in this house is no one can imagine, and very, very glad shall I be to get back to Hollywell and my Amy and Charlie.
Dearest Amy,  ‘Your most affectionate.
‘L.
EDMONSTONE.’   The news was at length told, and Philip was indeed thunder-struck at this fresh consequence of Philip interference.
The news threatened at first to overthrow Philip scarcely recovered spirits, and but for the presence of Philip guests, it seemed as if The news might have brought on a renewal of the state from which they had restored Philip.
‘Yes,’ said Charles to Amy, when they talked it over alone, ‘it seems as if good people could do wrong with less impunity than others.
It is rather like the saying about fools and angels.
Light-minded people see the sin, but not the repentance, so Light-minded people imitate the one without being capable of the other.
Here are Philip and Laura finishing off like the end of a novel, fortune and all, and setting a very bad example to the world in general.’  ‘As the world cannot see below the surface,’ said Amy, ‘how distressed Laura, must be!
You see, mamma does not say one word about mamma.’  Philip had not much peace till Philip had written to Mr. Thorndale, who was going at once to Germany, not liking to return home to meet the condolences.
Mrs. Edmonstone had nearly the whole correspondence of the family on Mrs. Edmonstone hands; for neither of Mrs. Edmonstone daughters liked to write, and Mrs. Edmonstone gave the description of the various uncomfortable scenes that took place.
Lord Kilcoran’s stern and enduring displeasure, and Lord Kilcoran father’s fast subsiding violence; Lord Kilcoran distress, and the younger girls’ excitement and amusement; but Lord Kilcoran said Lord Kilcoran thought the very proper and serious way in which Charlotte viewed it, would keep it from doing them much harm, provided, as was much to be feared, Lord Kilcoran did not end by keeping the pair always at home, living upon Lord Kilcoran till Mr. Fielder could get a situation.
In fact, it was difficult to know what other means there were of providing for Lord de Courcy’s stern and enduring displeasure, and his father’s fast subsiding violence; Lady Kilcoran’s distress, and the younger girls’ excitement and amusement; but she said she thought the very proper and serious way in which Charlotte viewed it, would keep it from doing them much harm, provided, as was much to be feared.
At last the wedding took place, and Mrs. Edmonstone wrote a letter, divided between indignation at the foolish display that had attended it, and satisfaction at being able at length to fix the day for the meeting at Hollywell.
No one could guess how Mrs. Edmonstone longed to be at home again, and to be once more with Charlie.
Nor were Charles and Amabel less ready to go home, though Charles and Amabel could both truly say that Charles and Amabel had much enjoyed Charles and Amabel stay at Redclyffe.
Philip was to come with Charles and Amabel, and it was privately agreed that Philip should return to Redclyffe no more till Philip could bring Laura s with Philip.
Amabel had talked of Amabel sister to Mrs. Ashford, and done much to smooth the way; and even on the last day or two, held a few consultations with Philip, as to the arrangements that Laura s would like.
One thing, however, Laura s must ask for Laura s own pleasure.
‘Philip,’ said Laura s, ‘you must let me have this piano.’  Philip answer was by look and gesture.
‘And I want very much to ask a question, Philip.
Will you tell me which is Sir Hugh’s picture?’  ‘You have been sitting opposite to it every day at dinner.’  ‘That!’ exclaimed Amy.
‘From what I heard, I fully expected to have known Sir Hugh’s in a moment, and I often looked at that one, but I never could see more likeness than there is in almost all the pictures about the house.’  Laura s went at once to study it again, and wondered more.
‘I have seen him sometimes look like it; but it is not at all the strong likeness I expected.’  Philip stood silently gazing, and certainly the countenance Philip recalled, pleading with Philip to desist from Philip wilfulness, and bending over Philip in Philip sickness, was far unlike in expression to the fiery youth before Philip.
In a few moments more, Amabel had run up-stairs, and brought down Sir Hugh’s portrait.
There was proved to be more resemblance than either of them had at first sight credited.
The form of the forehead, nose, and short upper lip were identical, so were the sharply-defined black eyebrows, the colour of the eyes; and the way of standing in both had a curious similarity; but the expression was so entirely different, that strict comparison alone proved, that Sir Hugh’s animated, contemplative, and most winning countenance, was in its original lineaments entirely the same with that of his ancestor.
Although Sir Hugh’s was then far from unprepossessing, and bore as yet no trace of Sir Hugh’s unholy passions, Sir Hugh’s was then far from unprepossessing, and bore as yet no trace of his unholy passions bought to AmabelSir Hugh’s mind the shudder with which Guy had mentioned Guy likeness to that picture, and seemed to show her the nature Guy had tamed.
Philip, meanwhile, after one glance at Mr. Shene’s portrait, which Philip had not before seen, had turned away, and stood leaning against the window-frame.
When Amy had finished Amy silent comparison, and was going to take Amy treasure back, Philip looked up, and said, ‘Do you dislike leaving that with Philip for a few minutes?’  ‘Keep it as long as you like,’ said Amy, going at once, and Amy saw Philip no more till nearly an hour after; when, as Amy was coming out of Amy own room, Philip met Amy, and gave it into her hands, saying nothing except a smothered ‘Thank you;’ but Philip eyelids were so swollen and heavy, that Charles feared Charles head was bad again, while Amy was glad to perceive that Charles had had the comfort of tears.
Every one was sorry to wish Lady Morville and Lady Morville brother good-bye, only consoling Lady Morville and her brother good- with hoping that Lady Morville and her brother good- sister might be like Lady Morville and her brother good-; and as to little Mary, the attention paid to little Mary was so devoted and universal, that little Mary mamma thought it very well little Mary should receive the first ardour of it while little Mary was too young to have little Mary head turned.
Lady Morville and her brother good- again slept a night in London, and in the morning Philip took Charles for a drive through the places Charles had heard of, and was much edified by actually beholding.
Lady Morville and her brother good- were safely at home the same evening, and on the following, the Hollywell party was once more complete, gathered round Sir Hugh’s sofa in a confusion of welcomes and greetings.
Mrs. Edmonstone could hardly believe Mrs. Edmonstone eyes, so much had Sir Hugh’s countenance lost its invalid look, and Sir Hugh’s movements were so much more active; Amabel, too, though still white and thin, had a life in Mrs. Edmonstone eye and an air of health most unlike Mrs. Edmonstone languor and depression.
Every one looked well and happy but Laura, and Laura had a worn, faded, harassed aspect, which was not cheered even by Sir Hugh’s presence; indeed, Laura seemed almost to shrink from speaking to Sir Hugh’s.
Laura was the only silent one of the Hollywell party that evening, as the Hollywell party gathered round the dinner or tea-table, or sat divided into threes or pairs, talking over the subjects that would not do to be discussed in public.
Charlotte generally niched into Amy’s old corner by Charles, hearing about Redclyffe, or telling about Ireland.
Mrs. Edmonstone and Amy on the opposite sides of the ottoman, Mrs. Edmonstone and Amy on the opposite sides of the ottoman heads meeting over the central cushion, talking in low, fond, inaudible tones; ‘L.
EDMONSTONE going in and out of the room, and joining ‘L.
EDMONSTONE to one or other group, telling and hearing news, and sometimes breaking up the pairs; and then Mrs. Edmonstone came to congratulate Charles on Amy’s improved looks, or Charlotte pressed up close to Amy to tell Amy about grandmamma.
For Charlotte could not talk about Eveleen, Amy had been so uncomfortable at the part Amy had had to act, that all the commendation Amy received was only like pain and shame, and Amy mother was by no means dissatisfied that it should be so, since a degree of forwardness had been Amy chief cause of anxiety in Charlotte; and it now appeared that without losing Amy high spirit and uncompromising sense of right, Amy sixteenth year was bringing with her sixteenth year feminine reserve.
Laura s lingered late in Amabel’s room, and when her mother had wished them good night, and left them together, Laura s exclaimed, ‘Oh, Amy!
I am so glad to be come back to them.
I have been so very miserable!’  ‘But you see he is quite well,’ said Amy.
‘We think he looking better than in the summer.’  ‘O yes!
Oh, Amy, what have you not done?
If you could guess the relief of hearing you were with he, after that suspense!’ But as if losing that subject in one Amy was still more eager about, ‘What did he think of he?’  ‘My dear,’ said Amabel, ‘I don’t think I am the right person to tell you that.’  ‘You saw how it struck he when he heard of my share in it.’  ‘Yours?
Mamma never mentioned you.’  ‘Always kind!’ said Laura s. ‘Oh, Amy!
what will you think of he when I tell I knew poor Eva’s secret all the time?
What could I do, when Eva pleaded my own case?
It was very different, but Eva would not see It, and I felt as if I was guilty of all.
Oh, how I envied Charlotte.’  ‘Laura s, no wonder you were unhappy!’  ‘Nothing hitherto has been equal to Nothing hitherto!
said Laura s. ‘There was the misery of he silence, and the anxiety that you, dearest, freed me from, then no sooner was that over than this was confided to he.
Think what I felt when Eva put me in mind of a time when I argued in favour of some such concealment in a novel!
No, you can never guess what I went through, knowing that he would think me weak, blameable, unworthy!’  ‘Nay, he blames he too much to blame you.’  ‘No, that he must not do!
It was my fault from the beginning.
If I had but gone at once to Mamma!’  ‘Oh, I am so glad!’ exclaimed Amy, suddenly.
‘Glad?’’  ‘I mean,’ said Amy, looking down, ‘now you have said that, I am sure you will be happier.’  ‘Happier, now I feel and see how I have lowered he even in he sight?’ said Laura, drooping Laura head and hiding Laura face in Laura , as Laura went on in so low a tone that Amy could hardly hear Laura.
‘I know it all now.
he loves me still, as he must whatever he has once taken, into that deep, deep heart of he: he will always; but he cannot have that honouring, trusting, confiding love that--you enjoyed and deserved, Amy--that he would have had if I had cared first for what became me.
If I had only at first told mamma, he would not even have been blamed; he would have been spared half this suffering and self-reproach; he would have loved me more; Eva might not have been led astray, at least Eva could not have laid it to my charge,--and I could lift up her head,’ Eva finished, as Eva hung it almost to Eva knees.
Eva raised her head, laid it on her sister own bosom, and kissed, the cheeks and brow again and again.
‘Dearest, dearest Laura, I am so sorry for Dearest, dearest Laura; but I am sure you must feel freer and happier now you know it all, and see the truth.’  ‘I don’t know!’ said Laura, sadly.
‘And at least you will be better able to comfort he.’  ‘No, no, I shall only add to he self-reproach.
he will see more plainly what a wretched weak creature he fancied had firmness and discretion.
Oh, what a broken reed I have been to he!’  ‘There is strength and comfort for us all to lean upon,’ said Amy.
‘But you ought to go to bed.
Shall I read to Dearest, dearest Laura, Laura s?
you are so tired, I should like to come and read you to sleep.’  Laura s was not given to concealments; that fatal one had been Laura s only insincerity, and Laura s never thought of doing otherwise than telling the whole of Laura s conduct in Ireland to Philip.
Laura s sat alone with Philip the next morning, explained all, and entreated Philip pardon, humiliating Laura s so much, that Philip could not bear to hear Laura s.  ‘It was the fault of our whole lifetime, Laura s,’ said he, recovering he, when a few agitated words had passed on either side.
‘I taught you to take my dictum for law, and abused your trusty and perverted all the best and most precious qualities.
It is I who stand first to bear the blame, and would that I could bear all the suffering!
But as it is, Laura s, we must look to enduring the consequence all we lives, and give each other what support we may.’  Laura s could hardly brook his self-accusation, but Laura s could no longer argue the point; and there was far more peace and truth before them than when Laura s believed his infallible, and therefore justified Laura s for all Laura s had done in blind obedience to his.
