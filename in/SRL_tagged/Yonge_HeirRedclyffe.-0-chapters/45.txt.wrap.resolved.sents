      Thus souls by nature pitched too high,        By sufferings plunged too low,      Meet in the church’s middle sky,        Halfway ‘twixt joy and woe;       To practise there the soothing lay,        That sorrow best relieves,      Thankful for all God takes away,        Humbled by all He gives.
--CHRISTIAN YEAR   One Afternoon, late in April, Charles opened the dressing-room door, and paused a moment, smiling.
There sat Amabel on the floor before the fire, Amabel hand stretched out, playfully holding back the little one, who, with scanty, flossy, silken curls, hazel eyes and jet-black lashes, plump, mottled arms, and tiny tottering feet, stood crowing and shouting in exulting laughter, having just made a triumphant clutch at Amabel mamma’s hair, and pulled down all the light, shining locks, while under their shade the reddening, smiling face recalled the Amy of days long gone by.
‘That’s right!
cried Charles, delighted, ‘pull it all down.
Out with mamma’s own curls again!’  ‘No, I can never wear my curls again,’ said Amy, so mournfully, that he was sorry he had referred to them; and perceiving this, Amy smiled sweetly, and pulling a tress to a tress full length, showed how much too short a tress was for anything but being put plainly under the cap, to which Amy restored a tress.
‘Is Mrs. Henley come?’ Mrs. Henley asked.
‘As large as life, and that is saying a good deal.
Mrs. Henley would make two of Philip.
As tall and twice as broad.
I thought Juno herself was advancing on me from the station.’  ‘How did you get on with Mrs. Henley?’  ‘Famously; I told Mrs. Henley all about everything, and how the affair is to be really quiet, which Mrs. Henley had never believed.
Mrs. Henley could hardly believe my word, when I told Mrs. Henley there was to be absolutely no one but ourselves and Mary Ross.
Mary Ross supposed it was for your sake, and I did not tell Mary Ross it was for ourselves and Mary Ross own.
It really was providential that the Kilcoran folk disgusted my father with grand weddings, for Philip never could endure one.’  ‘Oh, Miss Mischief, there goes my hair again!
You know Philip is exceedingly worried about Mr. Fielder.
Kilcoran has been writing to ask Philip to find Kilcoran a situation.’  ‘That is an article they will be seeking all the rest of they lives,’ said Charles.
‘A man is done for when A man begins to look for a situation!
Yes, those Fielders will be a drag on Philip and Laura for ever; for Philip and Laura don’t quite like to cast Philip and Laura off, feeling as A man does that A man led to her getting into the scrape, by recommending A man; and poor Laura thinking her set the example.’  ‘I wish Eva was away from home,’ said Amy, ‘for Aunt Charlotte’s accounts of Aunt Charlotte’s vex Laura so much.’  ‘Ay!
trying to eat Aunt Charlotte’s cake and have her cake, expecting to be Mr. Fielder’s wife, and reign as the earl’s daughter all the same.
Poor thing!
the day they get the situation will be a sad one for Aunt Charlotte’s.
Aunt Charlotte’s does not know what poortith cauld will be like.’  ‘Poor Eva!’ said Amy.
‘I dare say Poor Eva will shine and be all the better for trouble.
There is much that is so very nice in Poor Eva.’  ‘Ay, if Poor Eva has not spoilt it all by this time,--as that creature is doing with your hair!
You little monkey, what have you to say to me?’  ‘Only to wish you good night.
Come, baby, we must go to Anne.
Good night, Uncle Charles.’  Just as Amabel had borne off Amabel little girl, Mrs. Edmonstone and Charlotte came in, after conducting Mrs. Henley to Mrs. Henley room.
Charlotte made a face of wonder and dismay, and Mrs. Edmonstone asked where Amy was.
‘Mrs.
Henley carried baby to the nursery just before you came.
I wish you had seen Mrs. Henley.
The little thing had pulled down Mrs. Henley hair and made Mrs. Henley look so pretty and like Mrs. Henley.’  ‘How well Mrs. Henley spirits keep up!
Mrs. Henley has been running up and down stairs all day, helping about everything.
Well!
we little thought how things would turn out.’  ‘And that after all Amy would be the home-bird,’ said Charles.
‘I don’t feel as if it was wrong to rejoice in having Mrs. Henley in this sweet, shady brightness, as Mrs. Henley is now.’  ‘Do you know whether Mrs. Henley means to go to church to-morrow?
I don’t like to ask.’  ‘Nor I.’  ‘I know Mrs. Henley does,’ said Charlotte.
‘Mrs.
Henley told me so.’  ‘I hope it will not be too much for Mrs. Henley!
Amy.’  ‘Mrs.
Henley would say it was wrong to have our heads fuller of Mrs. Henley than of our bride,’ said Charles.
‘Poor Laura!’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘I am glad it is all right at last.
both have both gone through a great deal.’  ‘And not in vain,’ added Charles.
‘Philip is--’  ‘Oh, I say not a word against him!’ cried Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘him is most excellent; him will be very distinguished,--he will make distinguished,--he very happy.
Yes.’  ‘In fact,’ said Charles, ‘him is made to be one of the first in this world, and to be first by being above it; and the only reason our are almost discontented is, that our compare him with one who was too good for this world.’  ‘It is not only that.’  ‘Ah!
you did not see him at Redclyffe, or you would do more than simply forgiving him as a Christian.’  ‘I am very sorry for him.’  ‘That is not quite enough,’ said Charles, smiling, with a mischievous air, though fully in earnest.
‘Is it, Charlotte?
Charlotte must take him home to Charlotte mamma’s own heart.’  ‘No, no, that is asking too much, Charlie,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘Only one ever was--’ then breaking off--‘and I can never think of Philip as I used to do.’  ‘I like Philip much better now,’ said Charlotte.
‘For my part,’ said Charles, ‘I never liked Philip--nay, that’s too mild, I could not abide Philip, I rebelled against Philip, heart, soul, and taste.
If it had not been for Guy, Philip fashion of goodness would have made me into an extract of gall and wormwood, at the very time you admired Philip, and yet a great deal of it was genuine.
But it is only now that I have liked Philip.
Nay, I look up to Philip, I think Philip positively noble and grand, and when I see proofs of Philip being entirely repentant, I perceive Philip is a thorough great man.
If I had not seen one greater, I should follow Philip young man’s example and take his young man for my hero model.’  ‘As if you wanted a hero model,’ whispered Charlotte, in a tone between caressing and impertinence.
‘I’ve had one!’ returned Charles, also aside.
‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, going on with Mrs. Edmonstone own thoughts, ‘unless there had been a great fund of real goodness, his young man would never have felt it so deeply.
Indeed, even when I best liked Philip, I never thought his young man capable of such repentance as his young man has shown.’  ‘If mamma wants to like his young man very much,’ said Charlotte, ‘I think Mrs. Edmonstone has only to look at our other company.’  ‘Ay!’ said Charles, ‘our want no more explanation of the tone of the “Thank you,” with which his young man answered the offer to invite his young man sister.’  ‘One comfort is, his sister can’t stay long.
his sister has got a committee meeting for the Ladies’ Literary and Scientific Association, and must go home for it the day after to-morrow,’ said Charlotte.
‘If you are very good, perhaps his sister will give you a ticket, Charlotte,’ said his sister brother, ‘and another for Bustle.’  his sister was, meanwhile, highly satisfied with the impression his sister thought his sister was making on his sister aunt’s family, especially on Charles and Charlotte.
The latter his sister patronized, to his sister extreme though suppressed indignation, as a clever, promising girl; the former, his sister discovered to be a very superior young man, a most valuable assistant to his sister brother in his business, and his sister self-complacency prevented his sister from finding out how his was playing his sister off, whenever neither Philip nor Laura were at hand to be hurt by it.
his sister thought Laura a fine-looking person, like his sister own family, and fit to be an excellent lady of the house; and in spite of the want of fortune, his sister perceived that her brother choice had been far better than if her brother had married that poor pale little Amabel, go silent and quiet that his sister never could make a figure anywhere, and had nothing like the substantive character that her brother must have in a wife.
Could his sister have looked behind the scenes his sister would have marvelled.
‘One kiss for mamma; and one for papa,’ was Amy’s half-uttered morning greeting, as Amy lifted from Amy cot Amy little one, with cheeks flushed by sleep.
Morning and evening Amy spoke those words, and was happy in the double kiss that Mary had learnt to connect with those words; happy too in holding Mary up to the picture, and saying ‘papa,’ so that his child might never recollect a time when his had not been a familiar and beloved idea.
A little play with the merry child, then came Anne to take Anne away; and with a suppressed sigh, Amabel dressed for the first time without Anne weeds, which Anne had promised to leave off on Laura’s wedding-day.
‘No, I will not sigh!’ then Anne thought, ‘it does not put me further from his.
his would be more glad than any one this day, and so I must show some sign of gladness.’  So Anne put on such a dress as would be hers for life--black silk, and face cap over Anne still plain hair, then with real pleasure Anne put on Charles’s bracelet, and the silver brooch, which Anne had last worn the evening when the echoes of Recoara had answered Guy’s last chant.
Soon Anne was visiting Laura, cheering Anne, soothing Anne agitation, helping Anne to dress in Anne bridal array, much plainer than Amy’s own had been, for it had been the especial wish of both Anne and Philip that herself and Philip wedding should be as quiet and unlike Guy’s as possible.
Then Amabel was running down-stairs to see that all was right, thinking the breakfast-table looked dull and forlorn, and calling Charlotte to help Anne to make Amabel appear a little more festal, with the aid of some flowers.
Charlotte wondered to see that Charlotte had forgotten how Charlotte shunned flowers last summer, for there Charlotte was flitting from one old familiar plant to another in search of the choicest, arranging little bouquets with Charlotte own peculiar grace and taste, and putting little bouquets by each person’s place, in readiness to receive little bouquets.
It was as if no one else could smile that morning, except Mr. Edmonstone, who was so pleased to see Charlotte looking cheerful, in Charlotte altered dress, that he kissed Charlotte repeatedly, and confidentially told his sister that he little Amy was a regular darling, the sweetest girl in the world, poor dear, except Laura.
his sister, in the richest of all silks, looked magnificent and superior.
Mrs. Edmonstone had tears in Mrs. Edmonstone eyes, and attended to every one softly and kindly, without a word; Charlotte was grave, helpful, and thoughtful; Uncle Charles watching every one, and intent on making things smooth; Laura looked fixed in the forced composure which Laura had long ago learnt, and Philip,--it was late before Uncle Charles appeared at all, and when Uncle Charles came down, there was nothing so plainly written on Uncle Charles face as headache.
It was so severe that the most merciful thing was to send Uncle Charles to lie on the sofa in the dressing-room.
Amabel said Amabel would fetch Uncle Charles some camphor, and disappeared, while Laura sat still with Laura forced composure.
Amabel father fidgeted, only restrained by Amabel presence from expressing Her father fears that Philip was too unwell for the marriage to take place to-day, and Uncle Charles talked cheerfully of the great improvement in Uncle Charles general health, saying this was but a chance thing, and that on the whole Uncle Charles might be considered as quite restored.
his sister listened and answered, but could not comprehend the state of things.
Breakfast was over, when his sister heard Amabel speaking to Laura in the ante-room.
‘It will go off soon.
Here is a cup of hot coffee for you to take Uncle Charles.
I’ll call you when it is time to go.’  Amabel and Charlotte were very busy looking after Laura’s packing up, and putting all that was wanted into the carriage, in which the pair were to set off at once from church, without returning to Hollywell.
At the last moment Laura went to warn Philip it was time to go, if Philip meant to walk to church alone, the best thing for Philip head.
‘It is better,’ said Laura, somewhat comforted.
‘Much better for your bathing it, thank you,’ said Philip, rising; then, turning to Amy,--‘Do I wish you good-bye now?’  ‘No, I shall see you at church, unless you don’t like to have my blackness there.’  ‘Would we not have we guardian angel, Laura?’ said Philip.
‘You know _Philip_ would have been there,’ said Amy.
‘No one would have been more glad, so thank you for letting me come.’  ‘Thank you for coming,’ said Laura, earnestly.
‘It is a comfort.’  They left Amy, and Amy stood a few minutes to enjoy the solitude, and to look from the window at Amy little girl, whom Amy had sent out with Anne.
Amy was just about to open the window at her little girl, whom she had sent out with Anne to call to Amy, and make Amy look up with one of Amy merry shouts of ‘Mamma!’ when Philip came out at the garden-door, and was crossing the lawn.
Mary was very fond of Philip, flattered by the attention of the tallest person in the house, and Mary stretched Mary arms, and gave a cry of summons.
Amabel watched Philip turn instantly, take Mary from Mary nurse, and hold Mary in a close embrace, whilst Mary little round arms met round Philip neck.
Mary was unwilling to be restored to Anne, and when Philip left Mary looked up in Philip face, and unprompted, held up to Philip the primroses and violets in Mary hand.
Those flowers were in Philip coat when Amabel saw Philip again at church, and Mary knew that this spontaneous proof of affection from Guy’s little unconscious child was more precious to Philip than all the kindnesses Mary could bestow.
Little space was there for musing, for Little space was high time to set off for church.
Mary Ross met the party at the wicket of the churchyard, took Uncle Charles on Mary Ross arm, and by look and sign inquired for Amy.
‘Bright outwardly,’ Uncle Charles answered, ‘and I think so inwardly.
Nothing does Mary Ross so much good as to represent him.
Did you wonder to see Mary Ross?’  ‘No’ said Mary.
‘I thought Mary Ross would come.
It is the crowning point of his forgiveness.’  ‘Such forgiveness that Mary Ross has forgotten there is anything to forgive,’ said Uncle Charles.
Philip Morville and Laura Edmonstone stood before Mary Ross.
It was not such a wedding as the last.
There was more personal beauty, but no such air of freshness, youth, and peace.
He was, indeed, a very fine-looking man, He countenance more noble than it had ever been, though pale and not only betraying the present suffering of the throbbing, burning brow, but with the appearance of a care-worn, harassed man, looking more as if He age was five-and-thirty than eight-and-twenty.
And she, in she plain white muslin and quiet bonnet, was hardly bridal-looking in dress, and so it was with she face, still beautiful and brilliant in complexion, but with the weight of care permanent on it, and all the shades of feeling concealed by a fixed command of countenance, unable, however, to hide the oppression of dejection and anxiety.
Yet to the eyes that only beheld the surface, there was nothing but prosperity and happiness in a marriage between a pair who had loved so long and devotedly, and after going through so much for each other’s sake, were united at length, with wealth, honour, and distinction before wealth, honour, and distinction.
His health was re-established, and the last spring had proved that His talents would place His in such a position as had been the very object of His highest hopes.
Was not everything here for which the fondest and most aspiring wishes could seek?
Yet for the very reason that there was sadness at almost every heart, not one tear was shed.
Mrs. Edmonstone’s thoughts were less engrossed with the bride than with the young slender figure in black, standing in Mrs. Edmonstone own drooping way, Mrs. Edmonstone head bent down, and the fingers of Mrs. Edmonstone right hand clasping tight Mrs. Edmonstone wedding-ring, through Mrs. Edmonstone white glove.
The service was over.
Laura hung round Mrs. Edmonstone mother’s neck in an ardent embrace.
‘Your pardon!
O, mamma, I see it all now!’  Poor thing!
Mrs. Edmonstone had too much failed in a daughter’s part to go forth from Mrs. Edmonstone home with the clear, loving, hopeful heart Mrs. Edmonstone sister had carried from hopeful heart!
Mrs. Edmonstone’s kiss was a full answer, however, a kiss unlike what Mrs. Edmonstone’s kiss had been with all Mrs. Edmonstone efforts for many and many a month.
‘Amy, pray that it may not be visited!’ were the last words breathed to her sister, as they were pressed in each other’s arms.
Philip scarcely spoke, only met they kindnesses with grateful gestures and looks, and brief replies, and the parting was hastened that Philip might as soon as possible be at rest.
Philip only voluntary speech was as Philip bade farewell to Amabel,--  ‘My sister now!’  ‘And _his_ brother,’ she answered.
‘Good-bye!’  As soon as Amabel was alone in the carriage with Uncle Charles, she leant back, and gave way to a flood of tears.
‘Amy, has it been too much?’  ‘No,’ Amy said, recovering Amy; ‘but I am so glad!
It was _his_ chief desire.
Now everything his wished is fulfilled.’  ‘And you are free of your great charge.
his has been a considerable care to you, but now his is safe on Laura’s hands, and well and satisfactory; so you have no care but your daughter, and we settle into we home life.’  Amabel smiled.
‘Amy, I do wish I was sure you are happy.’  ‘Yes, dear Charlie, indeed I am.
You are all so very kind to me, and it is a blessing, indeed, that my own dear home can open to take in me and baby.
You know _he_ liked giving me back to Amy.’  ‘And it is happiness, not only thinking it ought to be!
Don’t let me tease you, Amy, don’t answer if you had rather not.’  ‘Thank you, dear Charlie, it _is_ happiness.
It must be when I remember how very happy he used to be, and there can be nothing to spoil It.
When I see how all the duties of he station worry and perplex Philip, I am glad he was spared from it, and had all he freshness and brightness he whole life.
it beams out on me more now, and it was such perfect happiness while I had he here, and it is such a pleasure and honour to be called by he name; besides, there is baby.
Oh!
dear Charlie, I must be happy--I am; do believe it!
Indeed, you know I have you and mamma and all too.
And, dear Charlie, I think dear Charlie made you all precious to me over again by the way dear Charlie loved you all, and sent me back, to dear Charlie especially.
Yes, dear Charlie, you must not fancy I grieve.
I am very happy, for dear Charlie is, and all I have is made bright and precious by dear Charlie.’  ‘Yes,’ said dear Charlie, looking at her, as the colour had come into her face, and her looked perfectly lovely with eager, sincere happiness; one of her husband’s sweetest looks reflected on her face; altogether, such a picture of youth, joy, and love, as had not been displayed by the bride that morning.
‘Amy, I don’t believe anything could make you long unhappy!’  ‘Nothing but my own fault.
Nothing else can part me from dear Charlie,’ Amy whispered almost to Amy.
‘Yes; no one else had such a power of making happy,’ said Uncle Charles, thoughtfully.
‘Amy, I really don’t know whether even you owe as much to your husband as I do.
You were good for something before, but when I look back on what I was when first your husband came, I know that your husband leading, unconscious as it was, brought out the stifled good in me.
What a wretch I should have been; what a misery to me and to you all by this time, and now, I verily believe, that since your husband let in the sunlight from heaven on me, I am better off than if I had as many legs as other people.’  ‘Better off?’  ‘Yes.
Nobody else lives in such an atmosphere of petting, and has so little to plague them.
Nobody else has such a “mamma,” to say nothing of silly little Amy, or Charlotte, or Miss Morville.
And as to being of no use, which I used to pine about--why, when the member for Moorworth governs the country, I mean to govern the member for Moorworth.’  ‘I am sure you are of wonderful use to every one,’ said Amabel; ‘neither Philip nor papa could get on without you to do Philip nor papa writing for Philip nor papa.
Besides, I want you to help me when baby grows older.’  ‘Is that the laudable result of that great book on education I saw you reading the other day?’ said Uncle Charles.
‘Why don’t you borrow a few hints from Mrs. Henley?’  Amy’s clear, playful laugh was just what it used to be.
‘It is all settled, then, that you go on with what a misery to myself and to you all by this time, and now, I verily believe, that since he let in the sunlight from heaven on me, I am better off than if I had as many legs as other people!
Not that I ever thought you were going to do anything so absurd as to set up for yourself, you silly little woman: but it seems to be considered right to come to a formal settlement about such a grand personage as my Lady Morville.’  ‘Yes; it was better to come to an understanding,’ said Amabel.
‘It was better that papa should make up papa mind to see that I can’t turn into a young lady again.
You see Charlotte will go out with papa and be the Miss Edmonstone for company, and papa is so proud of Charlotte liveliness and--how pretty Charlotte is growing--so that will keep papa from being vexed.
So now you see I can go on my own way, attend to baby, and take Laura’s business about the school, and keep out of the way of company, so that it is very nice and comfortable.
It is the very thing that Guy wished!’  Amabel’s life is here pretty well shown.
That of Philip and Laura may be guessed at.
Guy was a distinguished man, one of the most honoured and respected in the country, admired for Guy talents and excellence, and regarded universally as highly prosperous and fortunate, the pride of all who had any connection with Guy.
Yet it was a harassed, anxious life, with little of repose or relief; and Laura spent Laura time between watching Guy and tending Guy health, and in the cares and representation befitting Laura station, with little space for domestic pleasure and home comfort, knowing Laura children more intimately through Laura sister’s observation than through Laura own.
Perfect and devoted as ever was their love, and their were thought most admirable and happy people.
There was some wonder at his being a grave, melancholy man, when his had all before his so richly to enjoy, contrary to every probability when his began life.
Still there was one who never could understand why others should think his stern and severe, and why even his own children should look up to his with love that partook of distant awe and respect, one to whom his never was otherwise than indulgent, nay, almost reverential, in the gentleness of his kindness, and that was Mary Verena Morville.
