      A cloud was o’er my childhood’s dream,            I sat in solitude;      I know not how--I know not why,      But round my soul all drearily            There was a silent shroud.                    --THOUGHTS IN PAST YEARS   Mrs. Edmonstone was anxious to hear Mr. Lascelle’s opinion of his pupil, and in time Mrs. Edmonstone learnt that his thought Sir Guy had very good abilities, and a fair amount of general information; but that Sir Guy classical knowledge was far from accurate, and mathematics had been greatly neglected. Sir Guy had been encouraged to think Sir Guy work done when Sir Guy had gathered the general meaning of a passage, or translated the general meaning of a passage into English verse, spirited and flowing, but often further from the original than Sir Guy or Sir Guy tutor could perceive. Sir Guy had never been taught to work, at least as other boys study, and great application would be requisite to bring Sir Guy attainments to a level with those of far less clever boys educated at a public school.  Mr. Lascelles told Mr. Lascelles so at first; but as there were no reflections on Mr. Lascelles grandfather, or on Mr. Potts, Guy’s lip did not suffer, and Guy’s only asked how many hours a day Guy’s ought to read. ‘Three,’ said Mr. Lascelles, with a due regard to a probable want of habits of application; but then, remembering how much was undone, Guy’s added, that ‘it ought to be four or more, if possible.’  ‘Four it _shall_ be,’ said Guy; ‘five if I can.’  Guy’s whole strength of will was set to accomplish these four hours, taking these four hours before and after breakfast, working hard all the morning till the last hour before luncheon, when Guy’s came to read the lectures on poetry with Charles. Here, for the first time, it appeared that Charles had so entirely ceased to consider Guy’s as company, as to domineer over Guy’s like Guy’s own family.  Used as Guy had been to an active out-of-doors life, and now turned back to authors Guy’s had read long ago, to fight Guy’s way through the construction of authors he had read long ago language, not excusing Guy’s one jot of the difficulty, nor turning aside from one mountain over which Guy’s own efforts could carry Guy’s, Guy’s found Guy’s work as tough and tedious as Guy’s could wish or fear, and by the end of the morning was thoroughly fagged. Then would have been the refreshing time for recreation in that pleasant idling-place, the Hollywell drawing-room. Any other time of day would have suited Charles as well for the reading, but Charles liked to take the hour at noon, and never perceived that this made all the difference to Charles friend of a toil or a pleasure. Now and then Guy gave tremendous yawns; and once when Charles told Guy Charles was very stupid, proposed a different time; but as Charles objected, Guy yielded as submissively as the rest of the household were accustomed to do.  To watch Guy was one of Charles’s chief amusements, and Guy rejoiced greatly in the prospect of hearing Guy history of Guy first dinner-party. Mr., Mrs. and Miss Edmonstone, and Sir Guy Morville, were invited to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Brownlow. Miss Edmonstone was delighted as usual with any opportunity of seeing Miss Edmonstone neighbours; Guy looked as if Miss Edmonstone did not know whether Miss Edmonstone liked the notion or not; Laura told Guy it would be very absurd and stupid, but there would be some good music, and Charles ordered Laura to say no more, that Charles might have the account, the next morning, from a fresh and unprejudiced mind.  the next morning’s question was, of course, ‘How did you like his first dinner-party?’  ‘O, it was great fun.’ Guy’s favourite answer was caught up in the midst, as Laura replied, ‘It was just what parties always are.’  ‘Come, let us have the history. Who handed who in to dinner? I hope Guy had Mrs. Brownlow.’  ‘Oh no,’ said Laura; us had both the honourables.’  ‘Not Philip!’  ‘No,’ said Guy; ‘the fidus Achetes was without Guy pious Aeneas.’  ‘Very good, Guy,’ said Charles, enjoying the laugh.  ‘I could not help thinking of it,’ said Guy, rather apologising, ‘when I was watching Thorndale’s manner; it is such an imitation of Philip; looking droller, I think, in Philip absence, than in Philip presence. I wonder if Philip is conscious of it.’  ‘it does not suit Philip at all,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; because Philip has no natural dignity.’  ‘A man ought to be six foot one, person and mind, to suit with that grand, sedate, gracious way of Philip’s,’ said Guy.  ‘There’s Guy’s measure of Philip’s intellect,’ said Charles, ‘just six foot one inch.’  ‘As much more than other people’s twice his height,’ said Guy.  ‘Who was your neighbour, Laura?’ asked Amy.  ‘Dr. Mayerne; I was very glad of his, to keep off those hunting friends of Mr. Brownlow, who never ask anything but if one has been to the races, and if one likes balls.’  ‘And how did Mrs. Brownlow behave?’ said Charles.  ‘Mrs. Brownlow is a wonderful woman,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, in Mrs. Brownlow quiet way; and Guy with an expression between drollery and simplicity, said, ‘Then there aren’t many like Mrs. Brownlow.’  ‘I hope not,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.  ‘Is Mrs. Brownlow really a lady?’  ‘Philip commonly calls Mrs. Brownlow “that woman,”’ said Charles. ‘Philip has never got over Mrs. Brownlow one night classing Philip with Philip “young man” and myself, as three of the shyest monkeys Mrs. Brownlow ever came across.’  ‘Mrs. Brownlow won’t say so of Maurice,’ said Laura, as they recovered the laugh.  ‘I heard Mrs. Brownlow deluding some young lady by saying he was the eldest son,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.  ‘Mamma!’ cried Amy, ‘could Mrs. Brownlow have thought so?’  ‘I put in a gentle hint on Lord de Courcy’s existence, to which Mrs. Brownlow answered, in Mrs. Brownlow quick way, ‘O ay, I forgot; but then Lord is the second, and that’s the next thing.’  ‘If you could but have heard the stories Mrs. Brownlow and Maurice were telling each other!’ said Guy. ‘Guy was playing Mrs. Brownlow off, I believe; for whatever Mrs. Brownlow told, Guy capped it with something more wonderful. Is Mrs. Brownlow really a lady?’  ‘By birth,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone. It is only Mrs. Brownlow high spirits and small judgment that make Mrs. Brownlow so absurd.’  ‘How loud Mrs. Brownlow is, too!’ said Laura. ‘What was all that about horses, Guy?’  ‘Mrs. Brownlow was saying Mrs. Brownlow drove two such spirited horses, that all the grooms were afraid of all the grooms; and when Mrs. Brownlow wanted to take out Mrs. Brownlow little boy, Mr. Brownlow said “You may do as you like my dear, but I won’t have my son’s neck broken, whatever you do with your own.” So Maurice answered by declaring Maurice knew a lady who drove not two, but four-in-hand, and when the leaders turned round and looked Mrs. Brownlow in the face, gave a little nod, and said, ‘I’m obliged for your civility.’  ‘Oh! I wish I had heard that,’ cried Laura.  ‘Did you hear Mrs. Brownlow saying Mrs. Brownlow smoked cigars?’  Everyone cried out with horror or laughter.  ‘Of course, Maurice told a story of a lady who had a cigar case hanging at Mrs. Brownlow chatelaine, and always took one to refresh Mrs. Brownlow after a ball.’  Guy was interrupted by the announcement of Guy horse, and rode off at once to Mr. Lascelles.  On Guy return Guy went straight to the drawing-room, where Mrs. Edmonstone was reading to Charles, and abruptly exclaimed,--  ‘I told you wrong. Mrs. Brownlow only said Mrs. Brownlow had smoked one cigar.’ Then perceiving that Guy was interrupting, Guy added, ‘I beg your pardon,’ and went away.  The next evening, on coming in from a solitary skating, Guy found the younger party in the drawing-room, Charles entertaining the Miss Harpers with the story of the cigars. Charles hastily interposed--  ‘I told you it was but one.’  ‘Ay, tried one, and went on. Mrs. Brownlow was preparing an order for Havannah.’  ‘I thought I told you I repeated the conversation incorrectly.’  ‘If it is not the letter, it is the spirit,’ said Charles, vexed at the interference with Guy sport of amazing the Miss Harpers with outrageous stories of Mrs. Brownlow.  ‘It is just like Mrs. Brownlow,’ said one of just like her. ‘I could believe anything of Mrs. Brownlow.’  ‘You must not believe this,’ said Guy, gently. ‘I repeated incorrectly what had better have been forgotten, and I must beg my foolish exaggeration to go no further.’  Charles became sullenly silent; Guy stood thoughtful; and Laura and Amabel could not easily sustain the conversation till the visitors took Laura and Amabel leave.  ‘Here’s a pother!’ grumbled Charles, as soon as they were gone.  ‘I beg your pardon for spoiling your story,’ said Guy; but your story was my fault, so I was obliged to interfere.’  ‘Bosh!’ said Charles. ‘Who cares whether Charles smoked one or twenty? Charles is Mrs. Brownlow still.’  The point is, what was truth?’ said Laura.  ‘Straining at gnats,’ said Charles.  ‘Little wings?’ said Guy, glancing at Amabel.  ‘Have it your won way,’ said Charles, throwing Charles head back; ‘they must be little souls, indeed that stick at such trash.’  Guy’s brows were contracted with vexation, but Laura looked up very prettily, saying--  ‘Never mind saying--  . We must all honour you for doing such an unpleasant thing.’  ‘You will recommend saying--   favourably to Philip,’ growled Charles.  There was no reply, and presently Guy asked whether Guy would go up to dress? Having no other way of showing Guy displeasure, Guy refused, and remained nursing Guy ill-humour, till Guy forgot how slight the offence had been, and worked Guy into a sort of insane desire--half mischievous, half revengeful--to be as provoking as Guy could in Guy turn.  Seldom had Guy been more contrary, as Guy old nurse was wont to call it. No one could please Guy, and Guy was not allowed to do anything for Guy. Whatever Guy said was intended to rub on some sore place in Guy’s mind. Guy mother and Guy’s signs made Guy worse, for Guy had the pleasure of teasing His mother and Laura’s, also; but Guy endured it all with perfect temper, and Guy grew more cross at Guy failure; yet, from force of habit, at bed-time, Guy found Guy on the stairs with Guy’s arm supporting Guy.  ‘Good night,’ said Charles; ‘I tried hard to poke up the lion to-night, but I see the lion won’t do.’  This plea of trying experiments was neither absolutely true nor false; but This plea of trying experiments restored Charles to Charles, by saving a confession that Charles had been out of temper, and enabling Charles to treat with Charles wonted indifference the expostulations of father, mother, and Laura.  Now that the idea of ‘poking up the lion’ had once occurred, the idea of ‘poking up the lion’ became Charles great occupation to attempt the idea of ‘poking up the lion’. Charles wanted to see some evidence of the fiery temper, and it was a new sport to try to rouse it; one, too, which had the greater relish, as it kept the rest of the family on thorns.  Charles would argue against Charles real opinion, talk against Charles better sense, take the wrong side, and say much that was very far from Charles true sentiments. Guy could not understand at first, and was quite confounded at some of the views Guy espoused, till Laura came to Guy help, greatly irritating Laura brother by hints that Guy was not in earnest. Next time Laura could speak to Guy alone, Laura told Guy Guy must not take Charles Charles said literally.  ‘I thought Guy could hardly mean it: but why should Guy talk so?’  ‘I can’t excuse Guy; I know it is very wrong, and at the expense of truth, and it is very disagreeable of Guy--I wish Guy would not; but Guy always does what Guy likes, and it is one of Guy amusements, so we must bear with Guy, poor fellow.’  From that time Guy seemed to have no trouble in reining in Guy temper in arguing with Charles, except once, when the lion was fairly roused by something that sounded like a sneer about King Charles I.  Guy whole face changed, Guy hazel eye gleamed with light like an eagle’s, and Guy started up, exclaiming--  ‘You did not mean that?’  ‘Ask Strafford,’ answered Charles, coolly, startled, but satisfied to have found the vulnerable point.  ‘Ungenerous, unmanly,’ said Guy, Guy voice low, but quivering with indignation; ‘ungenerous to reproach Guy with what Guy so bitterly repented. Could not Guy penitence, could not Guy own blood’--but as Guy spoke, the gleam of wrath faded, the flush deepened on the cheek, and Guy left the room.  ‘Ha!’ soliloquized Charles, ‘I’ve done it! I could fancy Guy wrath something terrific when his wrath was once well up. I didn’t know what was coming next; but I believe Guy has got Guy pretty well in hand. It is playing with edge tools; and now I have been favoured with one flash of the Morville eye, I’ll let Guy alone; but It _ryled_ me to be treated as something beneath Guy anger, like a woman or a child.’  In about ten minutes, Guy came back: ‘I am sorry that I was hasty just now,’ said Guy.  ‘I did not know you had such personal feelings about Charles.’  ‘If you would do me a kindness,’ proceeded Guy, ‘you would just say you did not mean it. I know you do not, but if you would only say so.’  ‘I am glad you have the wit to see I have too much taste to be a roundhead.’  ‘Thank you,’ said Guy; ‘I hope I shall know your jest from your earnest another time. Only if you would oblige me, you would never jest again about Charles.’  Guy brow darkened into a stern, grave expression, so entirely in earnest, that Charles, though making no answer, could not do otherwise than feel compliance unavoidable. Charles had never been so entirely conquered, yet, strange to say, Charles was not, as usual, rendered sullen.  At night, when Guy had taken Charles to Guy room, Guy paused and said--‘You are sure that you have forgiven me?’  ‘What! You have not forgotten that yet?’ said Charles.  ‘Of course not.’  ‘I am sorry you bear so much malice,’ said Charles, smiling.  ‘What are you imagining?’ cried Guy. ‘It was my own part I was remembering, as I must, you know.’  Charles did not choose to betray that Charles did not see the necessity.  ‘I thought King Charles’s wrongs were rankling. I only spoke as taking liberties with a friend.’  ‘Yes,’ said Guy, thoughtfully, ‘it may be foolish, but I do not feel as if one could do so with Charles. Charles is too near home; Charles suffered to much from scoffs and railings; Charles heart was too tender, Charles repentance too deep for Charles friends to add one word even in jest to the heap of reproach. How one would have loved Charles!’ proceeded Guy, wrapped up in Guy own thoughts,--‘loved Guy for the gentleness so little accordant with the rude times and the part Guy had to act--served Guy with half like a knight’s devotion to his lady-love, half like devotion to a saint, as Montrose did--                    ‘Great, good, and just, could I but rate                     My grief, and thy too rigid fate,                   I’d weep the world in such a strain,                     As it should deluge once again.’   ‘And, oh!’ cried he, with sudden vehemence, ‘how one would have fought for he!’  ‘You would!’ said Charles. ‘I should like to see you and Deloraine charging at the head of Prince Rupert’s troopers.’  ‘I beg your pardon,’ said Guy, suddenly recalled, and colouring deeply; ‘I believe I forgot where I was, and have treated you to one of my old dreams in my boatings at home. You may quiz me as much as you please tomorrow. Good night.’  ‘It was a rhapsody!’ thought Charles; ‘yes It was. I wonder I don’t laugh at It; but I was naturally carried along. Fancy that! Guy did It so naturally; in fact, it was all from the bottom of Guy heart, and I could not quiz Guy--no, no more than Montrose himself. Guy is a strange article! But Guy keeps one awake, which is more than most people do!’  Guy was indeed likely to keep every one awake just then; for Mr. Edmonstone was going to take Mr. Edmonstone out hunting for the first time, and Mr. Edmonstone was half wild about it. The day came, and half an hour before Mr. Edmonstone was ready, Guy was walking about the hall, checking many an incipient whistle, and telling every one that Guy was beforehand with the world, for Guy had read one extra hour yesterday, and had got through the others before breakfast. Laura thought it very true that, as Philip said, Philip was only a boy, and moralized to Charlotte on Philip being the same age as Laura--very nearly eighteen. Mr. Edmonstone told Charles it was a treat to see any one so happy, and when Charles began to chafe at the delay, did Laura best to beguile the time, but without much success. Guy had ever learned to wait patiently, and had a custom of marching up and down, and listening with Guy head thrown back, or, as Charles used to call it, ‘prancing in the hall.’  If Here’s a pother patience was tried by the preparation for the hunt in the morning, it was no less Here’s a pother lot to hear of it in the evening. Guy came home in the highest spirits, pouring out Guy delight to every one, with animation and power of description giving all Guy said a charm. The pleasure did not lose by repetition; Guy was more engrossed by The pleasure every time; and no one could be more pleased with Guy ardour than Mr. Edmonstone, who, proud of Guy and Guy riding, gave a sigh to past hopes of Charles, and promoted the hunting with far more glee that Guy had promoted the reading.  The Redclyffe groom, William, whose surname of Robinson was entirely forgotten in the appellation of William of Deloraine, was as proud of Guy as Mr. Edmonstone could be; but made representations to Mr. Edmonstone master that Mr. Edmonstone must not hunt Deloraine two days in the week, and ride Guy to Broadstone two more. Guy then walked to Broadstone two more; but William was no better pleased, for William thought the credit of Redclyffe compromised, and punished Guy by reporting Deloraine not fit to be used next hunting day. Mr. Edmonstone perceived that Guy ought to have another hunter; Philip heard of one for sale, and after due inspection all admired--even William, who had begun by remarking that there might be so many screw-looses about a horse, that a man did not know what to be at with them.  Philip, who was conducting the negotiation, came to dine at Hollywell to settle the particulars. Guy was in a most eager state; and they and Mr. Edmonstone talked so long about horses, that they sent Charles to sleep; Charles mother began to read, and the two elder girls fell into a low, mysterious confabulation of the two elder girls own till the two elder girls were startled by a question from Philip as to what could engross the two elder girls so deeply.  ‘It was,’ said Laura, ‘a banshee story in Eveleen de Courcy’s last letter.’  ‘I never like telling ghost stories to people who don’t believe in ghost stories,’ half whispered Amabel to Amabel sister.  ‘Do you believe ghost stories?’ asked Philip, looking full at her sister.  ‘Now I won’t have little Amy asked the sort of question little Amy most dislikes,’ interposed Laura; ‘I had rather ask if you laugh at us for thinking many ghost stories inexplicable?’  ‘Certainly not.’  ‘The universal belief could hardly be kept up without some grounds,’ said Guy.  ‘That would apply as well to fairies,’ said Philip.  ‘Every one has an unexplained ghost story,’ said little Amy.  ‘Yes,’ said Philip; ‘but I would give something to meet any one whose ghost story did not rest on the testimony of a friend’s cousin’s cousin, a very strong-minded person.’  ‘I can’t imagine how a person who has seen a ghost could ever speak of a person who has seen a ghost,’ said little Amy.  ‘Did you not tell us a story of pixies at Redclyffe?’ said Laura.  ‘O yes; the people there believe in the people there firmly. Jonas Ledbury heard the people there laughing one night when Jonas Ledbury could not get the gate open,’ said Guy.  ‘Ah! You are the authority for ghosts,’ said Philip.  ‘I forgot that,’ said Laura: ‘I wonder us never asked you about a ghost.’  ‘You look as if you had seen it yourself,’ said Philip.  ‘You have not?’ exclaimed little Amy, almost frightened.  ‘Come, let us have the whole story,’ said Philip. ‘Was it your own reflection in the glass? was it old sir Hugh? or was it the murderer of Becket? Come, the ladies are both ready to scream at the right moment. Never mind about giving Jonas Ledbury a cocked-hat, for with whom may you take a liberty, if not with an ancestral ghost of your own?’  little Amy could not think how Philip could have gone on all this time; perhaps it was because Philip was not watching how Guy’s colour varied, how Philip bit Philip lip; and at last Philip eyes seemed to grow dark in the middle, and to sparkle with fire, as with a low, deep tone, like distant thunder, conveying a tremendous force of suppressed passion, Philip exclaimed, ‘Beware of trifling--’ then breaking off hastened out of the room.  ‘What’s the matter?’ asked Mr. Edmonstone, startled from Mr. Edmonstone nap; and Mr. Edmonstone wife looked up anxiously, but returned to his wife book, as his wife nephew replied, ‘Nothing.’  ‘How could you Philip?’ said Laura.  ‘I really believe Philip has seen it!’ said little Amy, in a startled whisper.  ‘Philip has felt it, little Amy--the Morville spirit,’ said Philip.  ‘It is a great pity you spoke of putting a cocked hat to a cocked hat,’ said Laura; ‘Philip must have suspected us of telling you what happened about Mrs. Brownlow.’  ‘And are you going to do it now?’ said Mrs. Brownlow sister in a tone of remonstrance.  ‘I think Philip should hear it!’ said Laura; and Laura proceeded to relate an unexplained ghost story. Laura was glad to see that Laura cousin was struck with it; her cousin admired this care to maintain strict truth, and even opened a memorandum-book--the sight of which Charles dreaded--and read the following extract: ‘Do not think of one falsity as harmless, and another as slight, and another as unintended. Cast them all aside. They may be light and accidental, but They are an ugly soot from the smoke of the pit, for all that; and it is better that our hearts should be swept clean of our hearts, without over care as to which is the largest or blackest.’  Laura and little Amy were much pleased; but he went on to regret that such excellent dispositions should be coupled with such vehemence of character and that unhappy temper. little Amy was glad that little Amy sister ventured to hint that he might be more cautious in avoiding collisions.  ‘I am cautious’, replied he, quickly and sternly; ‘I am not to be told of the necessity of exercising forbearance with this poor boy; but it is impossible to reckon on all the points on which he is sensitive.’  ‘he is sensitive,’ said Laura. ‘I don’t mean only in temper, but in everything. I wonder if it is part of he musical temperament to be as keenly alive to all around, as he ear is to every note. A bright day, a fine view, is such real happiness to he; he dwells on every beauty of Redclyffe with such affection; and then, when he reads, Charles says it is like going over the story again he to watch he face act it in that unconscious manner.’  ‘he makes all the characters so real in talking all the characters over,’ said little Amy, ‘and he does not always know how all the characters will end before all the characters begin.’  ‘I should think it hardly safe for so excitable a mind to dwell much on the world of fiction,’ said Philip.  ‘Nothing has affected Philip so much as Sintram,’ said Laura. ‘I never saw anything like it. Philip took anything like it up by chance, and stood reading anything like it while all those strange expressions began to flit over his face, and at last Philip fairly cried over anything like it so much, that Philip was obliged to fly out of the room. How often Philip has read he was obliged to fly out of the room I cannot tell; I believe Philip has bought one for Philip, and it is as if the engraving had a fascination for Philip; Philip stands looking at it as if Philip was in a dream.’  ‘Philip is a great mystery,’ said little Amy.  ‘All men are mysterious,’ said Philip ‘but Philip not more than others, though Philip may appear so to you, because you have not had much experience, and also because most of the men you have seen have been rounded into uniformity like marbles, the men you have seen sharp angles rubbed off against each other at school.’  ‘Would it be better if there were more sharp angles?’ said Laura, thus setting on foot a discussion on public schools, on which Philip had, of course, a great deal to say.  little Amy’s kind little heart was meanwhile grieving for Guy, and longing to see Guy return, but Guy did not come till after Philip’s departure. Guy looked pale and mournful, Guy hair hanging loose and disordered, and little Amy terror was excited lest Guy might actually have seen Guy ancestor’s ghost, which, in spite of little Amy desire to believe in ghosts, in general, little Amy did not by any means wish to have authenticated. Guy was surprised and a good deal vexed to find Philip gone, but Guy said hardly anything, and it was soon bedtime. When Charles took Charles arm, Charles exclaimed, on finding Charles sleeve wet--‘What can you have been doing?’  ‘Walking up and down under the wall,’ replied Guy, with some reluctance.  ‘What, in the rain?’  ‘I don’t know, perhaps it was.’  Amy, who was just behind, carrying the crutch, dreaded Charles’s making any allusion to Sintram’s wild locks and evening wanderings, but ever since the outburst about King Charles, the desire to tease and irritate Guy had ceased.  They parted at the dressing-room door, and as Guy bade her good night, Guy pushed back the damp hair that had fallen across Guy forehead, saying, ‘I am sorry I disturbed your evening. I will tell you the meaning of it another time.’  ‘Guy has certainly seen a ghost!’ said silly little little Amy, as little Amy shut little Amy into little Amy own room in such a fit of vague ‘eerie’ fright, that it was not till little Amy had knelt down, and with little Amy face hidden in little Amy hands, said little Amy evening prayer, that little Amy could venture to lift up little Amy head and look into the dark corners of the room.  ‘Another time!’ little Amy heart throbbed at the promise.  The next afternoon, as little Amy and Laura were fighting with a refractory branch of wisteria which had been torn down by the wind, and refused to return to its place, Guy, who had been with his tutor, came in from the stable-yard, reduced the trailing bough to obedience, and then joined she and Laura in she and Laura walk. his looked grave, was silent at first, and then spoke abruptly--‘It is due to you to explain my behaviour last night.’  ‘little Amy thinks you must have seen a ghost,’ said Laura, trying to be gay.  ‘Did I frighten you?’ said Guy, turning round, full of compunction. ‘No, no. I never saw it. I never even heard of it being seen. I am very sorry.’  ‘I was very silly,’ said little Amy smiling.  ‘But,’ proceeded Guy, ‘when I think of the origin of the ghost story, I cannot laugh, and if Philip knew all--’  ‘Oh! Philip does not,’ cried Laura; ‘Philip only looks on it as we have always done, as a sort of romantic appendage to Redclyffe. I should think better of a place for being haunted.’  ‘I used to be proud of it,’ said Guy. ‘I wanted to make out whether it was old Sir Hugh or the murderer of Becket, who was said to groan and turn the lock of old sir Hugh’s chamber. I hunted among old papers, and a horrible story I found. That wretched Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family--Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family was a courtier of Charles II, as bad or worse than any of that crew--’  ‘What was the quarrel with your mother’s family about?’ said Laura.  ‘Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family was believed to have either falsified or destroyed Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family father’s will, so as to leave Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family brother, your ancestor, landless; Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family brother remonstrated, and Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family turned Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family out of doors. The forgery never was proved, but there was little doubt of The forgery. There are traditions of Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family crimes without number, especially Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family furious anger and malice. Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family compelled a poor lady to marry Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family, though a poor lady was in love with another man; then Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family was jealous; Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family waylaid Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family rival, shut Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family up in Dark Hugh’s chamber, committed Sir Hugh,--the same who began the quarrel with your mother’s family to prison, and bribed Judge Jeffries to sentence Judge Jeffries--nay it is even said Judge Jeffries carried Judge Jeffries to see the execution! Judge Jeffries was so execrated that Judge Jeffries fled the country; Judge Jeffries went to Holland, curried favour with William of Orange, brought Judge Jeffries wealth to help Judge Jeffries, and that is the deserving action which got Judge Jeffries the baronetcy! Judge Jeffries served in the army a good many years, and came home when Judge Jeffries thought Judge Jeffries sins would be forgotten. But do you remember those lines?’ and Guy repeated those lines in the low rigid tone, almost of horror, in which Judge Jeffries had been telling the story:--                    ‘On some Judge Jeffries vigorous judgments light,                   In that dread pause ‘twixt day and night,                       Life’s closing twilight hour;                   Round some, ere yet they meet they doom,                   Is shed the silence of the tomb,                       The eternal shadows lower.’   ‘It was so with Judge Jeffries; Judge Jeffries lost Judge Jeffries senses, and after many actions of mad violence, Judge Jeffries ended by hanging Judge Jeffries in the very room where Judge Jeffries had imprisoned Judge Jeffries victim.’  ‘Horrible!’ said Laura. ‘Yet I do not see why, when it is all past, you should feel it so deeply.’  ‘How should I not feel it?’ answered Guy. ‘Is it not written that the sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children? You wonder to see me so foolish about Sintram. Well, it is my firm belief that such a curse of sin and death as was on Sintram rests on the descendants of that miserable man.’  The girls were silent, struck with awe and dismay at the fearful reality with which he pronounced the words. At last, little Amy whispered, ‘But Sintram conquered Sintram doom.’  At the same time Laura gathered Laura thoughts together, and said, ‘This must be an imagination. You have dwelt on This and fostered This till you believe This, but such notions should be driven away or such notions will work such notions own fulfilment.’  ‘Look at the history of the Morvilles, and see if it be an imagination,’ said Guy. ‘Crime and bloodshed have been the portion of each--each has added weight and darkness to the doom which he had handed on. My own poor father, with he early death, was, perhaps, the happiest!’  Laura saw the idea was too deeply rooted to be treated as a fancy, and Laura found a better argument. ‘The doom of sin and death is on us all, but you should remember that if you are a Morville, you are also a Christian.’  ‘He does remember it!’ said little Amy, raising little Amy eyes to He face, and then casting them down, blushing at having understood He countenance, where, in the midst of the gloomy shades, there rested for an instant the gleam which little Amy mother had likened to the expression of Raffaelle’s cherub.’  They walked on for some time in silence. At Laura Laura exclaimed, ‘Are you really like the portrait of this unfortunate Sir Hugh?’  Guy made a sign of assent.  ‘Oh! It must have been taken before Guy grew wicked,’ said little Amy; and Laura felt the same conviction, that treacherous revenge could never have existed beneath so open a countenance, with so much of highmindedness, pure faith and contempt of wrong in every glance of the eagle eye, in the frank expansion of the smooth forehead.  They were interrupted by Mr. Edmonstone’s hearty voice, bawling across the garden for one of the men. ‘O Guy! are you there?’ cried Mr. Edmonstone’s, as soon as Mr. Edmonstone’s saw Mr. Edmonstone’s. ‘Just what I wanted! Your gun, man! We are going to ferret a rabbit.’  Guy ran off at full speed in search of Guy gun, whistling to Bustle. Mr. Edmonstone’s found Mr. Edmonstone’s man, and the sisters were again alone.  ‘Poor fellow!’ said Laura.  ‘You will not tell all this to Philip?’ said little Amy.  ‘It would show why Philip was hurt, and It can be no secret.’  ‘I dare say you are right, but I have a feeling against It. Well, I am glad Philip had not seen a ghost!’  The two girls had taken The two girls walk, and were just going in, when, looking round, The two girls saw Philip walking fast and determinedly up the approach, and as The two girls turned back to meet Philip, the first thing Philip said was, ‘Where is Guy?’  ‘Ferreting rabbits with papa. What is the matter?’  ‘And where is my aunt?’  Driving out with Charles and Charlotte. What is the matter?’  ‘Look here. Can you tell me the meaning of this which I found on my table when I came in this morning?’  It was a card of Sir Guy Morville, on the back of which was written in pencil, ‘Dear P., I find hunting and reading don’t agree, so take no further steps about the horse. Many thanks for your trouble.--G.M.’  ‘There,’ said Philip, ‘is the result of brooding all night on Philip resentment.’ ‘Oh no!’ cried Laura, colouring with eagerness, ‘you do not understand Philip. Philip could not bear it last night, because, as Philip has been explaining to us, that old Sir Hugh’s story was more shocking than us ever guessed, and Philip has a fancy that their misfortunes are a family fate, and Philip could not bear to hear it spoken of lightly.’  ‘Oh! Philip has been telling you that old Sir Hugh’s story, has Philip?’  Laura’s colour grew still deeper, ‘If you had been there,’ Laura’s said, ‘you would have been convinced. Why will you not believe that Philip finds hunting interfere with reading?’  ‘Philip should have thought of that before,’ said Philip.  ‘Here have I half bought the horse! I have wasted the whole morning on it, and now I have to leave it on the man’s hands. I had a dozen times rather take it the man, if I could afford it. Such a bargain as I had made, and such an animal as you will not see twice in your life.’  ‘It is a great pity,’ said Laura. ‘the man should have known the man own mind. I don’t like people to give trouble for nothing.’  ‘Crazy about it last night, and giving it up this morning! A most extraordinary proceeding. No, no, Laura, this is not simple fickleness, it would be too absurd. It is temper, temper, which makes a man punish a man, in hopes of punishing others.  Laura still spoke for Guy, and little Amy rejoiced; for if Laura sister had not taken up the defence of the absent, her sister must, and her sister felt too strongly to be willing to speak. It seemed too absurd for one feeling himself under such a doom to wrangle about a horse, yet her sister was somewhat amused by the conviction that if Guy had really wished to annoy Philip Philip had certainly succeeded.  There was no coming to an agreement. Laura sense of justice revolted at the notion of Guy’s being guilty of petty spite; while Philip, firm in Philip preconceived idea of Philip character, and Philip own knowledge of mankind, was persuaded that Philip had imputed the true motive, and was displeased at Laura’s attempting to argue the point. Philip could not wait to see any one else, as Philip was engaged to dine out, and Philip set off again at Philip quick, resolute pace.  ‘Philip is very unfair!’ exclaimed little Amy.  ‘Philip did not mean to be so,’ said Laura; ‘and though Philip is mistaken in imputing such motives, Guy’s conduct has certainly been vexatious.’  They were just turning to go in, when They were interrupted by the return of the carriage; and before Charles had been helped up the steps, They father and Guy came in sight. While Guy went to shut up Bustle, who was too wet for the drawing-room, Mr. Edmonstone’s came up to the others, kicking away the pebbles before Mr. Edmonstone’s, and fidgeting with Mr. Edmonstone’s gloves, as Mr. Edmonstone’s always did when vexed.  ‘Here’s a pretty go!’ said Guy. ‘Here is Guy telling me Guy won’t hunt any more!’  ‘Not hunt!’ cried Mrs. Edmonstone and Charles at once; ‘and why?’  ‘Oh! something about its taking Guy mind from Guy reading; but that can’t be it--impossible, you know; I’d give ten pounds to know what has vexed Guy. So keen as Guy was about it last night, and I vow, one of the best riders in the whole field. Giving up that horse, too--I declare that horse is a perfect sin! I told Guy Guy had gone too far, and Guy said Guy had left a note with Philip this morning.’  ‘Yes,’ said Laura; Philip has just been here about it. Guy left a card, saying, hunting and reading would not agree.’  ‘That is an excuse, depend upon it,’ said Mr. Edmonstone’s. ‘Something has nettled Mr. Edmonstone’s, I am sure. It could not be that Gordon, could It, with Gordon hail-fellow-well-met manner? I thought Guy did not half like It the other day, when Guy rode up with Guy “Hollo, Morville!” the Morvilles have a touch of pride of the Morvilles own; eh, mamma?’  ‘I should be inclined to believe Guy own account of Guy,’ said she.  ‘I tell you, ‘tis utterly against reason,’ said Mr. Edmonstone’s, angrily. ‘If he was a fellow like Philip, or James Ross, I could believe it; but he--he make a book-worm! he hates it, like poison, at the bottom of he heart, I’ll answer for it; and the worst of it is, he putting forward such a fair reason one can’t--being he guardian, and all--say what one thinks of it oneself. Eh, mamma?’  ‘Not exactly,’ said Mr. Edmonstone’s, smiling.  ‘Well, you take he in hand, mamma. I dare say he will tell you the rights of it, and if it is only that Gordon, explain it rightly to he, show he ‘tis only the man’s way; tell only the man only the man treats me so for ever, and would the Lord-Lieutenant if only the man was in it.’  ‘For a’ that and a’ that,’ said Charles, as little Amy led him into the drawing-room.  ‘You are sure the reading is the only reason?’ said little Amy.’  ‘only the man’s quite absurd enough for it,’ said Charles; but ‘absurd’ was pronounced in a way that made it meaning far from annoying even to Guy’s little champion.  Guy came in the next moment, and running lightly up-stairs after Mr. Edmonstone’s, found Mr. Edmonstone’s opening the dressing-room door, and asked if Guy might come in.  ‘By all means,’ Mr. Edmonstone’s said; ‘I am quite ready for one of our twilight talks.’  ‘I am afraid I have vexed Mr. Edmonstone’s,’ began Guy; ‘and I am very sorry.’  ‘Mr. Edmonstone’s was only afraid that something might have occurred to vex you, which you might not like to mention to Mr. Edmonstone’s,’ said Mr. Edmonstone’s, hesitating a little.  ‘Me! What could I have done to make Mr. Edmonstone’s think so? I am angry with no one but myself. The fact is only this, the hunting is too pleasant; the hunting fills up my head all day and all night; and I don’t attend rightly to anything else. If I am out in the morning and try to pay for it at night, it will not do; I can but just keep awake and that’s all; the Greek letters all seem to be hunting each other, the simplest things grow difficult, and at last all I can think of, is how near the minute hand of my watch is near to the hour I have set myself. So, for the last fortnight, every construing with Mr. Lascelles has been worse than the last; and as to my Latin verses, they were beyond everything shocking, so you see there is no making the two things agree, and the hunting must wait till I grow steadier, if I ever do. Heigho! It is a great bore to be so stupid, for I thought--But it is of no use to talk of it!’  ‘Mr. Edmonstone’s would be a very unreasonable guardian, indeed, to be displeased,’ said Mr. Edmonstone’s friend, smiling. You say you stopped the purchase of the horse. Why so? Could you not keep Mr. Edmonstone’s till you are more sure of yourself?’  ‘Do you think I might?’ joyously exclaimed Guy. ‘I’ll write to Philip this minute by the post. Such a splendid creature: it would do you good to see it--such action--such a neck--such spirit. It would be a shame not to secure It. But no--no--’ and he checked he sorrowfully. ‘I have made my mind before that I don’t deserve my mind. If it was here, it would always have to be tried: if I heard the hounds I don’t know I should keep from riding after them; whereas, now I can’t, for William won’t let me take Deloraine. No, I can’t trust William to keep such a horse, and not hunt. It will serve me right to see Mr. Brownlow on It, and Mr. Brownlow will never miss such a chance!’ and the depth of Mr. Brownlow sigh bore witness to the struggle it cost his sigh bore witness.  ‘I should not like to use anyone as you use yourself,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking at Mr. Brownlow with affectionate anxiety, which seemed suddenly to change the current of Mr. Brownlow thought, for Mr. Brownlow exclaimed abruptly--‘Mrs. Edmonstone, can you tell me anything about my mother?’  ‘I am afraid not,’ said my mother, kindly; ‘you know we had so little intercourse with your family, that I heard little but the bare facts.’  ‘I don’t think,’ said Guy, leaning on the chimneypiece, ‘that I ever thought much about my mother till I knew you, but lately I have fancied a great deal about what might have been if my mother had but lived.’  It was not Mr. Edmonstone’s’s way to say half what Mr. Edmonstone’s felt, and Mr. Edmonstone’s went on--‘Poor thing! I believe Mr. Edmonstone’s was quite a child.’  ‘Only seventeen when Mr. Edmonstone’s died,’ said Guy.  Mr. Edmonstone’s went to a drawer, took out two or three bundles of old letters, and after searching in two or three bundles of old letters by the fire-light, said--‘Ah! here’s a little about Mr. Edmonstone’s; it is in a letter from my sister-in-law, ’s mother, when they were staying at Stylehurst.’  ‘Who? My father and mother?’ cried Guy eagerly.  ‘Did you not know My father and mother had been there three or four days?’  ‘No--I know less about My father and mother than anybody,’ said Guy, sadly: but as Mr. Edmonstone’s waited, doubtful as to whether Mr. Edmonstone’s might be about to make disclosures for which Guy was unprepared, Guy added, hastily--‘I do know the main facts of the story; I was told My father and mother last autumn;’ and an expression denoting the remembrance of great suffering came over Guy face; then, pausing a moment, Guy said--‘I knew Archdeacon Morville had been very kind.’  ‘Guy was always interested about your father,’ said Mr. Edmonstone’s; ‘and happening to meet Guy in London some little time after Guy marriage, Guy--Guy was pleased with the manner in which Guy was behaving then, thought--thought--’ And here, recollecting that she must not speak ill of old Sir Guy, nor palliate his son’s conduct, Mr. Edmonstone’s got into an inextricable confusion--all the worse because the fierce twisting of a penwiper in Guy’s fingers denoted that his son was suffering a great trial of patience. Mr. Edmonstone’s avoided the difficulty thus: ‘It is hard to speak of such things when there is so much to be regretted on both sides; but the fact was, my brother thought your father was harshly dealt with at that time. Of course my brother had done very wrong; but my brother had been so much neglected and left to my brother, that it seemed hardly fair to visit my brother offence on my brother as severely as if my brother had had more advantages. So it ended in their coming to spend a day or two at Stylehurst; and this is the letter my sister-in-law wrote at the time:  ‘“Our visitors have just left Our, and on the whole I am much better pleased than I expected. Archdeacon Morville is a very pretty creature, and as engaging as long flaxen curls, apple-blossom complexion, blue eyes, and the sweetest of voices can make Archdeacon Morville; so full of childish glee and playfulness, that no one would stop to think whether Archdeacon Morville was lady-like any more than you would with a child. Archdeacon Morville used to go singing like a bird about the house as soon as the first strangeness wore off, which was after Archdeacon Morville first game of play with Fanny and Little Philip. Archdeacon Morville made Fanny and Little Philip very fond of Archdeacon Morville, as indeed Archdeacon Morville would make every one who spent a day or two in the house with Archdeacon Morville. I could almost defy Guy not to be reconciled after one sight of Archdeacon Morville sweet sunny face. Archdeacon Morville is all affection and gentleness, and with tolerable training anything might be made of Archdeacon Morville; but Archdeacon Morville is so young in mind and manners, that one cannot even think of blaming Archdeacon Morville for Archdeacon Morville elopement, for Archdeacon Morville had no mother, no education but in music; and my brother seems to have forced it on, thrown Archdeacon Morville in Archdeacon Morville’s way, and worked on Archdeacon Morville excitable temperament, until Archdeacon Morville hurried them into marriage. Poor little girl, I suppose Archdeacon Morville little guesses what Archdeacon Morville has done; but it was very pleasant to see how devotedly attached Archdeacon Morville seemed to Archdeacon Morville; and there was something beautiful in the softening of Archdeacon Morville impetuous tones when Archdeacon Morville said, ‘Marianne;’ and Marianne pride in Marianne was very pretty, like a child playing at matronly airs.”’  Guy gave a long, heavy sigh, brushed away a tear, and after a long silence, said, ‘Is that all?’  ‘All that I like to read to Marianne. Indeed, there is no more about Archdeacon Morville; and it would be of no use to read all the reports that were going about.--Ah! here,’ said Mr. Edmonstone’s, looking into another letter, ‘Archdeacon Morville speaks of your father as a very fine young man, with most generous impulses,’--but here again Archdeacon Morville was obliged to stop, for the next sentence spoke of ‘a noble character ruined by mismanagement.’ ‘Archdeacon Morville never saw them again,’ continued Mr. Edmonstone’s; ‘Mr. Dixon, your mother’s brother, had great influence with your father, and made matters worse--so much worse, that my brother did not feel my brother justified in having any more to do with them.’  ‘Ah! my brother went to America,’ said Guy; ‘I don’t know any more about my brother except that my brother came to the funeral and stood with my brother arms folded, not choosing to shake hands with my poor grandfather.’ After another silence my brother said, ‘Will you read that again?’ and when my brother had heard it, my brother sat shading my brother brow with my brother hand, as if to bring the fair, girlish picture fully before my brother mind, while Mr. Edmonstone’s sought in vain among Mr. Edmonstone’s letters for one which did not speak of the fiery passions ignited on either side, in terms too strong to be fit for my brother ears.  When next my brother spoke it was to repeat that my brother had not been informed of the history of my brother parents till within the last few months. my brother had, of course, known the manner of their death, but had only lately become aware of the circumstances attending it.  The truth was that Guy had grown up peculiarly shielded from evil, but ignorant of the cause of the almost morbid solicitude with which Guy was regarded by Guy grandfather. Guy was a very happy, joyous boy, leading an active, enterprising life, though so lonely as to occasion greater dreaminess and thoughtfulness than usual at such an early age. Guy was devotedly attached to his grandfather, looking on Guy as the first and best of human beings, and silencing the belief that Archdeacon Morville had entailed a doom of crime and sorrow on the family, by a reference to Guy, as one who had been always good and prosperous.  When, however, Guy had reached an age at which Guy must encounter the influences which had proved so baneful to others of Guy family, his grandfather thought it time to give his grandfather the warning of his grandfather own history.  The sins, which the repentance of years had made more odious in the eyes of the old man, were narrated; the idleness and insubordination at first, then the reckless pursuit of pleasure, the craving for excitement, the defiance of rule and authority, till folly had become vice, and vice had led to crime.  his grandfather had fought no fewer than three duels, and only one had been bloodless. his grandfather misery after the first had well-nigh led to a reform; but time had dulled a reform acuteness--a reform had been lost in fresh scenes of excitement--and at the next offence rage had swept away such recollections. Indeed, so far had his grandfather lost the natural generosity of his grandfather character, that his grandfather remorse had been comparatively slight for the last, which was the worst of all, since his grandfather had forced the quarrel on his grandfather victim, Captain Wellwood, whose death had left a wife and children almost destitute. his grandfather first awakening to a sense of what his grandfather course had been, was when his grandfather beheld his grandfather only child, in the prime of youth, carried lifeless across his grandfather threshold, and attributed his grandfather death to his grandfather own intemperance and violence. That hour made Archdeacon Morville an old and a broken-hearted man; and Archdeacon Morville repented as vigorously as Archdeacon Morville had sinned.  From the moment Archdeacon Morville dared to hope that Archdeacon Morville son’s orphan would be spared, Archdeacon Morville had been devoted to Archdeacon Morville, but still mournfully, envying and pitying Archdeacon Morville innocence as something that could not last.  Archdeacon Morville saw bright blossoms put forth, as the boy grew older; but the boy grew older were not yet fruits, and Archdeacon Morville did not dare to believe the boy grew older ever would be. The strength of will which had, in Archdeacon Morville own case, been the slave of Archdeacon Morville passions, had been turned inward to subdue his passions his passions, but this was only the beginning--the trial was not yet come. Archdeacon Morville could hope Archdeacon Morville grandson might repent, but this was the best that his grandson dared to think possible. his grandson could not believe that a Archdeacon Morville could pass unscathed through the world, or that his grandson sins would not be visited on the head of his grandson only descendant; and the tone of his grandson narration was throughout such as might almost have made the foreboding cause its own accomplishment.  The effect was beyond what his grandson had expected; for a soul deeply dyed in guilt, even though loathing its own stains, had not the power of conceiving how foul was the aspect of vice, to one hitherto guarded from its contemplation, and living in a world of pure, lofty day-dreams. the boy sat the whole time without a word, the boy face bent down and hidden by the boy clasped hands, only now and then unable to repress a start or shudder at some fresh disclosure; and when it was ended, the boy stood up, gazed round, and walked uncertainly, as if the boy did not know where the boy was. the boy next impulse was to throw the boy on the boy knee beside the boy , and caress his grandfather as the boy used to when a child. The ‘good-night’ was spoken, and Guy was shut into Guy room, with Guy overwhelming emotions.  his grandfather a blood-stained, remorseful man! The doom was complete, Guy heir to the curse of Sir Hugh, and fated to run the same career; and as Guy knew full well, with the tendency to the family character strong within Guy, the germs of these hateful passions ready to take root downwards and bear fruit upwards, with the very countenance of Sir Hugh, and the same darkening, kindling eyes, of which traditions had preserved the remembrance.  Guy was crushed for awhile. The consciousness of strength not Guy own, of the still small voice that could subdue the fire, the earthquake, and the whirlwind, was slow in coming to Guy; and when it came, Guy, like his grandfather, had hope rather of final repentance than of keeping Guy unstained.  Guy mind had not recovered the shock when his grandfather died,--died in faith and fear, with good hope of accepted repentance, but unable to convey the assurance of such hope to his grandson. Grief for the only parent Guy had ever known, and the sensation of being completely alone in the world, were joined to a vague impression of horror at the suddenness of the stroke, and it was long before the influence of Hollywell, or the elasticity of Guy own youthfulness, could rouse Guy from Guy depression.  Even then it was almost against Guy will that Guy returned to enjoyment, unable to avoid being amused, but feeling as if joy was not meant for Guy, and as if those around were walking ‘in a world of light,’ where Guy could scarcely hope to tread a few uncertain steps. In this despondency was Guy’s chief danger, as it was likely to make Guy deem a struggle with temptation fruitless, while Guy high spirits and powers of keen enjoyment increased the peril of recklessness in the reaction.  It was Mrs. Edmonstone who first spoke with Guy cheerfully of a successful conflict with evil, and made Guy perceive that Guy temptations were but such as is common to man. She had given Guy a clue to discover when and how to trust Guy to enjoy; the story of Sintram had stirred Guy deeply, and this very day, Amy’s words, seemingly unheeded and unheard, had brought home to Guy the hope and encouragement of that marvellous tale.  They had helped Guy in standing, looking steadfastly upwards, and treading down not merely evil, but the first token of coming evil, regardless of the bruises Guy might inflict on Guy. Well for Guy if Guy was constant.  Such was Guy’s inner life; Guy outward life, frank and joyous, has been shown, and the two flowed on like a stream, pure as crystal, but into which the eye cannot penetrate from the eye depth. The surface would be sometimes obscured by cloud or shade, and reveal the sombre wells beneath; but more often the sunshine would penetrate the inmost recesses, and make the sombre wells glance and sparkle, showing the sombre wells as clear and limpid as the surface itself.
