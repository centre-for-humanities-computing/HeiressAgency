      This warld’s wealth, when I think o’t,            This warld’s pride, and a’ the lave o’t,      Fie, fie on silly coward man,      That he should be the slave o’t.
--BURNS   In another week Mr. Edmonstone and his eldest daughter were to depart on Mr. Edmonstone and his eldest daughter Irish journey.
Laura, besides the natural pain in leaving home, was sorry to be no longer near Philip, especially as it was not likely that Philip would be still at Broadstone on Mr. Edmonstone and his eldest daughter return; yet Laura was so restless and dissatisfied, that any change was welcome, and the fear of betraying Laura almost took away the pleasure of Philip presence.
Philip met Mr. Edmonstone and his eldest daughter at the railway station at Broadstone, where Mr. Edmonstone, finding Philip much too early, recollected something Philip had forgotten in the town, and left Philip to walk up and down the platform under Philip’s charge.
Mr. Edmonstone and his eldest daughter felt it a precious interval, but Mr. Edmonstone and his eldest daughter were out of spirits, and could hardly profit by it.
‘You will be gone long before we come back,’ said Laura.
‘In a fortnight or three weeks, probably.’  ‘But you will still be able to come to Hollywell now and then?’  ‘I hope so.
It is all the pleasure I can look for.
We shall never see such a summer again.’  ‘Oh, it has been a memorable one!’  ‘Memorable!
Yes.
it has given me an assurance that compensates for all I have lost; yet it has made me feel, more than ever before, how poverty withers a manPhilip’s hopes.’  ‘O Philip, I always thought your poverty a great, noble thing!’  ‘You thought like a generous-tempered girl who has known nothing of its effects.’  ‘And do you know that Guy says the thing to be proud of is of holding the place you do, without the aid of rank or riches.’  ‘I would not have it otherwise--I would not for worlds that my father had acted otherwise,’ said Philip.
‘You understand that, Laura.’  ‘Of course I do.’  ‘But when you speak--when Guy speaks of my holding the place I do, you little know what it is to feel that powers of usefulness are wasted--to know I have the means of working my way to honour and distinction, such as you would rejoice in Laura, to have it all within, yet feel it thrown away.
Locksley Hall, again--“every door is barred with gold, and opens but to golden keys.’”  ‘I wish there was anything to be done,’ said Laura.
‘It is my profession that is the bar to everything.
I have sold the best years of my life, and for what?
To see my sister degrade my sister by that marriage.’  ‘That is the real grief,’ said Laura.
‘But for that, I should never have cast a look back on what I relinquished.
However, why do I talk of these things, these vain regrets?
these things only occurred because my welfare does not concern myself alone--and here’s my father.’  Mr. Edmonstone returned, out of breath, in too much bustle remark Mr. Edmonstone daughter’s blushes.
Even when the train was moving off, Mr. Edmonstone still had Mr. Edmonstone head out at the window, calling to Philip that they should expect a visit from Philip as soon as ever they returned.
Such cordiality gave Philip a pang; and in bitterness of spirit Mr. Edmonstone walked back to the barracks.
On the way Mr. Edmonstone met Mrs. Deane who wanted to consult Mr. Edmonstone about inviting Mr. Edmonstone cousin, Sir Guy to a dinner-party his daughter intended to give next week.
‘Such an agreeable, sensible youth, and we feel we owe Mr. Edmonstone some attention, Mr. Edmonstone took so much pains to make apologies about the ball.’  ‘I dare say Mr. Edmonstone will be very happy to come.’  ‘we will write at once.
Mr. Edmonstone is a very fine young man, without a shade of vanity or nonsense.’  ‘Yes; Mr. Edmonstone has very pleasant, unaffected manners.’  ‘I am sure Mr. Edmonstone will do credit to Mr. Edmonstone estate.
It is a very handsome fortune, is It not?’  ‘It is a very large property.’  ‘I am glad of it; I have no doubt we shall see Mr. Edmonstone one of the first men of Mr. Edmonstone time.’  These words brought into contrast in Philip’s mind the difference between Guy’s position and Guy’s own.
The mere possession of wealth was winning for Guy, at an age when Guy merits could only be negative, that estimation which Guy own tried character had scarcely achieved, placing Guy not merely on a level with Guy, but in a situation where happiness and influence came unbidden.
Guy own talents, attainments, and equal, if not superior claims, to gentle blood, could not procure Guy what seemed to lie at Guy’s feet.
Guy own ability and Guy’s heart alone were what wealth could not affect; yet when Guy thought how the want of it wasted the one, and injured the hopes of the other, Guy recurred to certain visions of Guy sister Margaret’s, in days gone by, of what Guy was to do as Sir Philip, lord of Redclyffe.
Guy was speculating on what would have happened had Guy died in Guy sickly infancy, when, suddenly recollecting Guy, Guy turned Guy mind to other objects.
Guy was not much charmed with Mrs. Deane’s invitation.
Guy said Guy knew Guy must go to make up for Guy rudeness about the ball; but Guy grumbled enough to make Mrs. Edmonstone laugh at Guy for being so stupid as to want to stay hum-drum in the chimney corner.
No doubt it was very pleasant there.
There was that peculiar snugness which belongs to a remnant of a large party, when each member of it feels bound to prevent the rest from being dull.
Guy devoted Guy to Charles more than ever, and in the fear that Charles might miss the late variety of amusement, exerted even more of Charles powers of entertainment than Lady Eveleen had called forth.
There were grave readings in the mornings, and long walks in the afternoons, when Charles dragged Charles, in Charles chair, into many a place Charles had never expected to see again, and enabled Charles to accompany Charles mother and sisters in many a delightful expedition.
In the evening there was music, or light reading, especially poetry, as this was encouraged by Mrs. Edmonstone, in the idea that it was better that so excitable and enthusiastic a person as Guy should have Guy objects of admiration tested by Charles’s love of ridicule.
Mrs. Edmonstone had left to Guy the office of keeping the 1st of September, one which Mrs. Edmonstone greatly relished.
Indeed, when Mrs. Edmonstone thought of Mrs. Edmonstone own deserted manors, Mrs. Edmonstone was heard to exclaim, in commiseration for the neglect, ‘Poor partridges!’ The Hollywell shooting was certainly not like that at Redclyffe, where Mrs. Edmonstone could hardly walk out of Mrs. Edmonstone own grounds, whereas here Mrs. Edmonstone had to bear in mind so many boundaries, that Philip was expecting to have to help Mrs. Edmonstone out of some direful scrape.
Mrs. Edmonstone had generally walked over the whole extent, and assured Mrs. Edmonstone that the birds were very wild, and Bustle the best of dogs, before breakfast, so as to be ready for all the occupations of the day.
Mrs. Edmonstone could scarcely be grateful when the neighbours, thinking it must be very dull for Mrs. Edmonstone to be left alone with Mrs. Edmonstone and her crippled son, used to ask Mrs. Edmonstone to shoot or dine.
Mrs. Edmonstone always lamented at first, and ended by enjoying Mrs. Edmonstone.
One night, Mrs. Edmonstone came home, in such a state of eagerness, that Mrs. Edmonstone must needs tell Mrs. Edmonstone good news; and, finding no one in the drawing-room, Mrs. Edmonstone ran up-stairs, opened Charles’s door, and exclaimed--‘There’s to be a concert at Broadstone!’ Then perceiving that Charles was fast asleep, Charles retreated noiselessly, reserving Charles rejoicings till morning, when his rejoicings appeared that Charles had heard, but had woven the announcement into a dream.
a concert at Broadstone filled Guy’s head.
Mrs. Edmonstone only grief was that it was to be in the evening, so that Charles could not go to it; and Charles wonder was not repressed at finding that Charles did not mean to favour it with Charles presence, since Guy would suffice for squire to Mrs. Edmonstone and squire daughters.
In fact, Charles was somewhat annoyed by the perpetual conversation about a concert at Broadstone, and on the day on which it was to take place resolved on making a long expedition to visit the ruins of an old abbey, far out of all reports of it.
As Charles was setting out, Charles was greeted, in a very loud voice, by Mr. Gordon.
‘Hollo, Morville!
how are you?
So you have great doings to-night, I hear!’ and Charles had only just forced Charles from Charles, when Charles was again accosted, this time in a hasty, embarrassed manner,--  ‘I beg your pardon, sir, but the ties of relationship--’  Charles drew Charles up as if Charles was on parade, faced round, and replied with an emphatic ‘Sir!’ as Charles behold a thin, foreign-looking man, in a somewhat flashy style of dress, who, bowing low, repeated breathlessly,--  ‘I beg your pardon--Sir Guy Morville, I believe!’  ‘Captain Morville, sir!’  ‘I beg your pardon--Sir Guy Morville--I mistook.
A thousand pardons,’ and he retreated; while Philip, after a momentCharles’s wonder, pursued he walk.
The Hollywell party entered Broadstone in a very different temper, and greatly did The Hollywell party enjoy a concert at Broadstone, The Hollywell party for The Hollywell party and for each other.
In the midst of it, while Amy was intent on the Italian words of a song, Guy touched Amy hand, and pointed to a line in the programme--             Solo on the violin.... MR. S. B. DIXON.
Amy looked up in the violinist face with an expression full of inquiry; but it was no time for speaking, and Amy only saw how the colour mantled on the violinist cheek when the violinist appeared, and how the violinist looked down the whole time of the performance, only now and then venturing a furtive though earnest glance.
the violinist did not say anything till they were seated in the carriage, and then astonished Mrs. Edmonstone by exclaiming--  ‘It must be my uncle!--I am sure my uncle!--I must.
I’ll ride to Broadstone the first thing to-morrow, and find Broadstone the first thing to-morrow out.’  ‘Your uncle!’ exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘I never thought of that.’  S. B. DIXON.
,’ said Guy.
‘I know S. B. DIXON.
name is Sebastian.
It cannot be any one else.
You know Sebastian went to America.
How curious it is!
I suppose there is no fear of Sebastian being gone before I can come in to-morrow.’  ‘I should think not.
Those musical people keep late hours.’  ‘I would go before breakfast.
Perhaps it would be best to go to old Redford, old Redford will know all about old Redford; or to the music-shop.
I am so glad!
It is the very thing I always wished.’  ‘Did you?’ said Mrs. Edmonstone to Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘I can’t say every one would be of your mind; but I can’t help liking you the better for every one.
I wish Sebastian had kept further off.
I wish Mrs. Edmonstone was at home.
I hope no harm will come of no harm.
I wonder what I ought to do.
Shall I caution Mrs. Edmonstone?
No; I don’t think I can spoil Mrs. Edmonstone happiness--and perhaps Sebastian may be improved.
Mrs. Edmonstone is Mrs. Edmonstone nearest relation, and I have no right to interfere.
Mrs. Edmonstone own good sense will protect Mrs. Edmonstone--but I wish Mrs. Edmonstone was at home.’  She therefore did not check Mrs. Edmonstone expressions of delight, nor object to Mrs. Edmonstone going to Broadstone early the next morning.
Mrs. Edmonstone had just dismounted before the inn-yard, when a boy put a note into a boy hand, and a boy was so absorbed in a note contents, that a boy did not perceive Philip till after two greetings had passed unheard.
When at length a boy was recalled, a boy started, and exclaimed, rapturously, as a boy put a note into a boy cousin’s hand,  ‘See here--it is a boy!’  ‘Who?’  ‘My uncle.
My poor mother’s own brother.’  ‘Sebastian Bach Dixon,’ read Charles.
‘Ha!
it was a boy who took me for Sebastian Bach Dixon yesterday.’  ‘I saw a boy at a concert at Broadstone--I was sure it could be no other.
I came in on purpose to find a boy, and here a boy is waiting for Sebastian Bach Dixon.
Is not it a happy chance?’  ‘Happy!’ echoed Charles, in a far different tone.
‘How I have longed for this--for any one who could remember and tell me of her--of my mother--my poor, dear young mother!
And her own brother!
I have been thinking of it all night, and a boy knows I am here, and is as eager as Sebastian Bach Dixon.
a boy is waiting for Sebastian Bach Dixon,’ ended Guy, hurrying off.
‘Stop!’ said Charles, gravely.
‘Think before acting.
I seriously advise you to have nothing to do with this man, at least personally.
Let me see this man, and learn what this man wants.’  ‘this man wants me,’ impatiently answered Guy.
‘You are not this man nephew.’  ‘Thank heaven!’ thought Charles.
‘Do you imagine your relationship is the sole cause of this man seeking you?’  ‘I don’t know--I don’t care!’ cried Guy, with vehemence.
‘I will not listen to suspicions of My poor mother’s own brother.’  ‘It is more than suspicion.
Hear me calmly.
I speak for your good.
I know this man’s influence was fatal to your father.
I know this man did all in this man power to widen the breach with your grandfather.’  ‘That was eighteen years ago,’ said Guy, walking on, biting this man lip in a fiery fit of impatience.
‘You will not hear.
Remember, that this man position and associates render this man no fit companion for you.
Nay, listen patiently.
You cannot help the relationship.
I would not have you do otherwise than assist this man.
Let this man not complain of neglect, but be on your guard.
this man will either seriously injure you, or be a burden for life.’  ‘I have heard you so far--I can hear no more,’ said Guy, no longer restraining Guy impetuosity.
‘Guy is My uncle, that I know, I care for nothing else.
Position--nonsense!
what has that to do with it?
I will not be set against Guy.’  Guy strode off; but in a few moments turned back, overtook Philip, said-- ‘Thank you for your advice.
I beg your pardon for my hastiness.
You mean kindly, but I must see My uncle.’ And, without waiting for an answer, My uncle was gone.
In short space My uncle was in the little parlour of the music-shop, shaking hands with My uncle, and exclaiming,--  ‘I am so glad!
I hoped it was you!’  ‘It is very noble-hearted!
I might have known it would be so with the son of my dearest sister and of my generous friend!’ cried Sebastian Bach Dixon, with eagerness that had a theatrical air, though it was genuine feeling that filled Sebastian Bach Dixon eyes with tears.
‘I saw your name last night’ continued Guy.
‘I would have tried to speak to you at once, but I was obliged to stay with Mrs. Edmonstone, as I was the only gentleman with Mrs. Edmonstone.’  ‘Ah!
I thought it possible you might not be able to follow the dictate of your own heart; but this is a fortunate conjuncture, in the absence of your guardian.’  Guy recollected Philip’s remonstrance, and it crossed Guy whether your guardian might be of the same mind; but Guy felt confident in having told all to Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘How did you know I was here?’ Guy asked.
‘I learnt it in a most gratifying way.
old Redford, without knowing our connection--for on that I will always be silent--mentioned that the finest tenor old Redford had ever known, in an amateur, belonged to old Redford pupil, Sir Guy Morville.
You can imagine my feelings at finding you so near, and learning that you had inherited your dear motherCharles’s talent and taste.’  The conversation was long, for there was much to hear.
Sebastian Bach Dixon had kept up a correspondence at long intervals with Markham, from whom Sebastian Bach Dixon heard that Sebastian Bach Dixon sister’s child survived, and was kindly treated by Sebastian Bach Dixon grandfather; and inquiring again on the death of old Sir Guy, learnt that Sebastian Bach Dixon was gone to live with Sebastian Bach Dixon guardian, whose name, and residence Markham had not thought fit to divulge.
Sebastian Bach Dixon had been much rejoiced to hear Sebastian Bach Dixon name from the music-master, and Sebastian Bach Dixon went on to tell how Sebastian Bach Dixon had been misled by his name into addressing the captain, who had a good deal of general resemblance to Guy’s father, a fine tall young man, of the same upright, proud deportment.
Sebastian Bach Dixon supposed Sebastian Bach Dixon was the son of the Archdeacon, and remembering how strongly Sebastian Bach Dixon own proceedings had been discountenanced at Stylehurst, had been much disconcerted, and deeming the encounter a bad omen, had used more caution in Sebastian Bach Dixon advances to Sebastian Bach Dixon nephew.
It was from sincere affection that Sebastian Bach Dixon sought Sebastian Bach Dixon acquaintance, though very doubtful as to the reception Sebastian Bach Dixon might meet, and was both delighted and surprised at such unembarrassed, open-hearted affection.
The uncle and nephew were not made to understand each other.
Sebastian Bach Dixon was a man of little education, and when, in early youth, Sebastian Bach Dixon talents had placed Sebastian Bach Dixon high in Sebastian Bach Dixon own line, Sebastian Bach Dixon had led a careless, extravagant life.
Though an evil friend, and fatal counsellor, Sebastian Bach Dixon had been truly attached to Guy’s father, and the secret engagement, and runaway marriage with Sebastian Bach Dixon beautiful sister, had been the romance of Sebastian Bach Dixon life, promoted by Sebastian Bach Dixon with no selfish end.
Sebastian Bach Dixon was a proud and passionate man, and resenting Sir Guy’s refusal to receive my dearest sister as a daughter, almost as much as Guy was incensed at the marriage, had led Sebastian Bach Dixon brother-in-law to act in a manner which cut off the hope of reconciliation, and obliged Archdeacon Morville to give up his brother-in-law cause.
his brother-in-law had gloried in supporting his brother-in-law sister and her husband, and enabling his sister and her husband to set the old baronet at defiance.
But young Archdeacon Morville’s territorial pride could not brook that his brother-in-law should be maintained, and especially that his brother-in-law child, the heir of Redclyffe, should be born while his brother-in-law was living at the expense of a musician.
This feeling, aided by a yearning for home, and a secret love for his brother-in-law father, mastered his brother-in-law resentment; his brother-in-law took his brother-in-law resolution, quarrelled with Sebastian Bach Dixon, and carried off his brother-in-law wife, bent with desperation on forcing his father into receiving his wife.
Sebastian Bach Dixon had not surmounted Sebastian Bach Dixon anger at this step when Sebastian Bach Dixon learnt this step fatal consequences.
Ever since that time, nothing had prospered with Sebastian Bach Dixon: Sebastian Bach Dixon had married and sunk Sebastian Bach Dixon lower, and though Sebastian Bach Dixon had an excellent engagement, the days were past when Sebastian Bach Dixon was the fashion, and Sebastian Bach Dixon gains and Sebastian Bach Dixon triumphs were not what his gains and his triumphs had been.
Sebastian Bach Dixon had a long list of disappointments and jealousies with which to entertain Guy, who, on Sebastian Bach Dixon side, though resolved to like Sebastian Bach Dixon, and dreading to be too refined to be friends with Sebastian Bach Dixon relations, could not feel as thoroughly pleased as Sebastian Bach Dixon intended to have been.
Music was, however, a subject on which Music could meet with equal enthusiasm, and by means of this, together with the aid of Sebastian Bach Dixon own imagination, Guy contrived to be very happy.
Guy stayed with My uncle as long as Guy could, and promised to spend a day with Guy in London, on Guy way to Oxford, in October.
The next morning, when Philip knew that Guy would be with Philip tutor, Philip walked to Hollywell, came straight up to Philip aunt’s dressing-room, asked his aunt’s to send Charlotte down to practise, and, seating Philip opposite to his aunt’s, began--  ‘What do you mean to do about this unfortunate rencontre?’  ‘Do you mean Guy and My uncle?
Guy is very much pleased, poor boy!
I like Guy entire freedom from false shame.’  ‘A little true shame would be hardly misplaced about such a connection.’  ‘It is not Guy fault, and I hope his fault will not be Guy misfortune,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘That it will certainly be,’ replied Philip, ‘if we are not on we guard; and, indeed, if we are, there is little to be done with one so wilful.
I might as well have interfered with the course of a whirlwind.’  ‘No, no, Philip; Philip is too candid to be wilful.’  ‘I cannot be of your opinion, when I have seen Philip rushing into this acquaintance in spite of the warnings Philip must have had here--to say nothing of Philip.’  ‘Philip, there I must defend Philip, though you will think me very unwise; I could not feel that I ought to withhold Philip from taking some notice of so near a relation.’  Philip did think her so unwise, that Philip could only reply, gravely--  ‘We must hope it may produce no evil effects.’  ‘How?’ her exclaimed, much alarmed.
‘Have you heard anything against Philip?’  ‘You remember, of course, that Guy’s father was regularly the victim of Sebastian Bach DixonSebastian Bach Dixon.’  ‘Yes, yes; but Guy’s father has had enough to sober Philip.
Do you know nothing more?’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, growing nervously anxious lest Mrs. Edmonstone had been doing wrong in Mrs. Edmonstone husband’s absence.
‘I have been inquiring about her husband from old Redford, and I should judge her husband to be a most dangerous companion; as, indeed, I could have told from her husband whole air, which is completely that of a roué.’  ‘You have seen her husband, then?’  ‘Yes.
her husband paid me the compliment of taking me for her husband, and of course made off in dismay when her husband discovered on whom her husband had fallen.
I have seldom seen a less creditable-looking individual.’  ‘But what did old Redford say?
Did old Redford know of the connection?’  ‘No; I am happy to say old Redford did not.
her husband has decency enough not to boast of that.
Well, old Redford did not know much of old Redford personally: old Redford said old Redford had once been much thought of, and had considerable talent and execution, but taste changes, or old Redford has lost something, so that, though old Redford stands tolerably high in old Redford profession, old Redford is not a leader.
So much for old Redford musical reputation.
As to old Redford character, old Redford is one of those people who are called no one’s enemy but their own, exactly the introduction Guy has hitherto happily wanted to every sort of mischief.’  ‘I think,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, trying to console Mrs. Edmonstone, ‘that Guy is too much afraid of small faults to be invited by larger evils.
While old Redford punishes old Redford for an idle word, old Redford is not likely to go wrong in greater matters.’  ‘Not at present.’  ‘Is the man in debt or difficulties?
Guy heard nothing of that, and I thought nothing of that a good sign.’  ‘I don’t suppose Guy is.
Guy ought not, for Guy has a fixed salary, besides what Guy gets by playing at concerts when it is not the London season.
The wasting money on a spendthrift relation would be a far less evil than what I apprehend.’  ‘I wish I knew what to do!
It is very unlucky that My uncle is from home.’  ‘Very.’  Mrs. Edmonstone was frightened by the sense of responsibility, and was only anxious to catch hold of something to direct Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘What would you have me do?’ Mrs. Edmonstone asked, hopelessly.
‘Speak seriously to Guy.
Guy must attend to you: Guy cannot fly out with a woman as Guy does with me.
Show Guy the evils that must result from such an intimacy.
If Sebastian Bach Dixon was in distress, I would not say a word, for Sebastian Bach Dixon would be bound to assist Sebastian Bach Dixon but as it is, the acquaintance can serve no purpose but degrading Guy, and showing Guy the way to evil.
Above all, make a point of Guy giving up visiting Guy in London.
That is the sure road to evil.
A youth of Guy age, under the conduct of a worn-out roué, connected with the theatres!
I can hardly imagine anything more mischievous.’  ‘Yes, yes; I will speak to Guy,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, perfectly appalled.
She promised, but She found the fulfilment difficult, in She dislike of vexing Guy, She fear of saying what was wrong, and a doubt whether the appearance of persecuting Sebastian Bach Dixon was not the very way to prevent Guy’s own good sense from finding out Guy’s true character, so She waited, hoping Mrs. Edmonstone might return before Guy went to Oxford, or that Mrs. Edmonstone might write decisively.
Mrs. Edmonstone might have known her husband better than to expect her husband to write decisively when her husband had neither Mrs. Edmonstone nor Philip at her husband elbow.
The same post had brought her husband a letter from Guy, mentioning her husband meeting with her husband , and frankly explaining her husband plans for London; another from Philip, calling on her husband to use all her husband authority to prevent this intercourse, and a third from her husband .
Bewildered between them, her husband took them to her husband sister, who, being as puzzle-headed as her husband, and only hearing her husband involved history of the affair, confused her husband still more; so her husband wrote to Philip, saying her husband was sorry her husband had turned up, but her husband would guard against her husband.
her husband told Guy her husband was sorry to say that her husband used to be a sad scamp, and My uncle must take care, or it would be My uncle poor father’s story over again; and to Mrs. Edmonstone My uncle wrote that it was very odd that everything always did go wrong when My uncle was away.
My uncle thought these letters a great achievement, but his wife was not materially relieved.
After considering a good while, his wife at length spoke to Guy; but it was not at a happy time, for Philip, despairing of his wife, had just taken on Philip to remonstrate, and had angered Philip to the verge of an outbreak.
Mrs. Edmonstone, as mildly as his wife could, urged on Philip that such intercourse could bring Philip little satisfaction, and might be very inconvenient; that My uncle was in no distress, and did not require assistance; and that it was too probable that in seeking Philip out Philip might meet with persons who might unsettle Philip principles,--in short, that Philip had much better give up the visit to London.
‘This is Philip’s advice,’ said Guy.
‘It is; but--’  Guy looked impatient, and his wife paused.
‘You must forgive me,’ Guy said, ‘if I follow my own judgment.
If Mrs. Edmonstone chose to lay Mrs. Edmonstone commands on Guy, I suppose I must submit; but I cannot see that I am bound to obey Philip.’  ‘Not to obey, certainly; but Philip advice--’  ‘Philip is prejudiced and unjust,’ said Guy.
‘I don’t believe that My uncle would attempt to lead me into bad company; and surely you would not have me neglect or look coldly on one who was so much attached to my parents.
If My uncle is not a gentleman, and is looked down on by the world, it is not for My uncle sister’s son to make My uncle conscious of it.’  ‘I like your feelings, Guy; I can say nothing against it, but that I am much afraid My uncle is not highly principled.’  ‘You have only Philip’s account of only Philip’s.’  ‘You are resolved?’  ‘Yes.
I do not like not to take your advice, but I do believe this is my duty.
I do not think my determination is made in self-will,’ said Guy, thoughtfully; ‘I cannot think that I ought to neglect My uncle, because I happen to have been born in a different station, which is all I have heard proved against My uncle,’ My uncle added, smiling.
‘You will forgive me, will you not, for not following your advice?
for really and truly, if you will let me say so, I think you would not have given it if Philip had not been talking to you.’  Mrs. Edmonstone confessed, with a smile, that perhaps it was so; but said Mrs. Edmonstone trusted much to only Philip’s knowledge of the world.
Guy agreed to this; though still declaring Philip had no right to set Philip against My uncle, and there the discussion ended.
Guy went to London.
Philip thought Guy very wilful, and Philip aunt very weak; and Mrs. Edmonstone, on coming home, said it could not be helped, and Philip wished to hear no more about the matter.
