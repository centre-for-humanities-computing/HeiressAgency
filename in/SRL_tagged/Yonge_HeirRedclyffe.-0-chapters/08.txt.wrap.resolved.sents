      Like Alexander, I will reign,      And I will reign alone,      My thoughts shall ever more disdain      A rival near my throne.
But I must rule and govern still,      And always give the law,      And have each subject at my will,      And all to stand in awe.
--MONTROSE.
One very hot afternoon, shortly after the ball, Captain Morville walked to Hollywell, accelerating Captain Morville pace under the influence of anxious reflections.
Captain Morville could not determine whether Charles had spoken in jest; but in spite of Guy’s extreme youth, Captain Morville feared there was ground for the suspicion excited by the hint, and was persuaded that such an attachment could produce nothing but unhappiness to Captain Morville cousin, considering how little confidence could be placed in Guy.
Captain Morville perceived that there was much to inspire affection--attractive qualities, amiable disposition, the talent for music, and now this recently discovered power of versifying, all were in Guy’s favour, besides the ancient name and long ancestry, which conferred a romantic interest, and caused even Philip to look up to Captain Morville with a feudal feeling as head of the family.
There was also the familiar intercourse to increase the danger; and Philip, as Philip reflected on these things, trembled for Laura, and felt Philip Laura only protector; for Philip uncle was nobody, Mrs. Edmonstone was infatuated, and Charles would not listen to reason.
To make everything worse, Philip had that morning heard that there was to be a grand inspection of the regiment, and a presentation of colours; Colonel Deane was very anxious; and it was plain that in the interval the officers would be allowed little leisure.
The whole affair was to end with a ball, which would lead to a repetition of what had already disturbed Colonel Deane.
Thus meditating, Philip, heated and dusty, walked into the smooth green enclosure of Hollywell.
Everything, save the dancing clouds of insect youth which whirled in Philip face, was drooping in the heat.
The house--every door and window opened--seemed gasping for breath; the cows sought refuge in the shade; the pony drooped its head drowsily; the leaves hung wearily; the flowers were faint and thirsty; and Bustle was stretched on the stone steps, mouth open, tongue out, only his tail now and then moving, till his put back his ears and crested his head to greet the arrival.
Philip heard the sounds that had caused the motion of the sympathizing tail--the rich tones of Guy’s voice.
Stepping over the dog, Philip entered, and heard more clearly--            ‘Two loving hearts may sever,            For sorrow fails Two loving hearts never.’  And then another voice--            ‘Who knows not love in sorrow’s night,            Philip knows not love in light.’  In the drawing-room, cool and comfortable in the green shade of the Venetian blinds of the bay window, stood Laura, leaning on the piano, close to Guy, who sat on the music-stool, looking thoroughly at home in Philip brown shooting-coat, and loosely-tied handkerchief.
Any one but Philip would have been out of temper, but Philip shook hands as cordially as usual, and would not even be the first to remark on the heat.
Laura told Philip Philip looked hot and tired, and invited Philip to come out to the others, and cool Philip on the lawn.
Laura went for Laura parasol, Philip ran for Laura camp stool, and Philip, going to the piano, read what the piano had been singing.
The lines were in Laura’s writing, corrected, here and there, in Guy’s hand.
BE STEADFAST.
Two loving hearts may sever,            Yet Love shall fail Two loving hearts never.
Love brightest beams in sorrow’s night,            Love is of life the light.
Two loving hearts may sever,            Yet hope shall fail Two loving hearts never.
Hope is a star in sorrow’s night,            Forget-me-not of light.
Two loving hearts may sever,            Yet Faith may fail Two loving hearts never.
Trust on through sorrow’s night,            Faith is of Love and hope the light.
Two loving hearts may sever,            For sorrow fails Two loving hearts never.
Who knows not love in sorrow’s night,            He knows not love in light.
Philip was by no means pleased.
However, it was in anything but a sentimental manner that Guy, looking over Philip, said, ‘For sever, read, be separated, but “a” wouldn’t rhyme.’  ‘I translated it into prose, and Guy made it verse,’ said Laura; ‘I hope you approve of our performance.’  ‘It is that thing of Helmine von Chezy, “Beharre”, is it not?’ said Philip, particularly civil, because Philip was so much annoyed.
‘You have rendered the spirit very well’, but you have sacrificed a good deal to your double rhymes.’  ‘Yes; those last lines are not troubled with any equality of feet,’ said Guy; ‘but the repetition is half the beauty.
the repetition put me in mind of those lines of Burns--             “Had our never loved so kindly,            Had our never loved so blindly,            Never met and never parted,            our had ne’er been broken hearted;”  but there is a trust in these that is more touching than that despair.’  ‘Yes; that despair is ready, to wish the love had never been,’ said Laura.
‘It does not see the star of trust.
Why did you use trust” only once, Guy?’  ‘I did not want to lose the three--faith, hope, love,--faith keeping the other two alive.’  ‘My doubt was whether it was right to have that analogy.’  ‘Surely,’ said Guy, eagerly, ‘that analogy must be the best part of earthly love.’  Here Charlotte came to see if Guy and Laura meant to sing all the afternoon; and Guy and Laura went out.
Guy and Laura found the others in the arbour, and Charlotte’s histories of Charlotte construction, gave Philip little satisfaction.
Guy and Laura next proceeded to talk over the ball.
‘Ah!’ said Philip, ‘balls are the fashion just now.
What do you say, Amy, [Philip was more inclined to patronize Amy than any one else] to the gaieties we are going to provide for Amy?’  ‘You!
Are you going to have your new colours?
Oh!
you are not going to give we a ball?’  ‘Well!
that is fun!’ cried Guy.
‘What glory Maurice de Courcy must be in!’  ‘Maurice de Courcy is gone to Allonby,’ said Philip, ‘to announce Allonby; saying, Maurice de Courcy must persuade Maurice de Courcy father to put off Guy and Laura going to Brighton.
Do you think Maurice de Courcy will succeed?’  ‘Hardly,’ said Laura; ‘poor Lady Kilcoran was so knocked up by Guy and Laura ball, that Lady Kilcoran is the more in want of sea air.
Oh, mamma, Eva must come and stay here.’  ‘That Eva must,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘that will make it easy.
Eva is the only one who will care about the ball.’  Philip was obliged to conceal Philip vexation, and to answer the many eager questions about the arrangements.
Philip stayed to dinner, and as the others went in-doors to dress, Philip lingered near Charlotte, assuming, with some difficulty, an air of indifference, and said--‘Well, Charlotte, did you tease Guy into showing you those verses?’  ‘Oh yes,’ said Charlotte, with what the French call “un air capable”.’  ‘Well, what were they?’  ‘That I mustn’t tell.
they were very pretty; but I’ve promised.’  ‘Promised what?’  ‘Never to say anything about they.
Guy made it a condition with me, and I assure you, I am to be trusted.’  ‘Right,’ said Philip; ‘I’ll ask no more.’  ‘It would be of no use,’ said Charlotte, shaking Charlotte head, as if Charlotte wished he would prove Charlotte further.
Philip was in hopes of being able to speak to Laura after dinner, but Philip uncle wanted Philip to come and look over the plans of an estate adjoining Redclyffe, which there was some idea of purchasing.
Such an employment would in general have been congenial; but on this occasion, it was only by a strong force that Philip could chain Philip attention, for Guy was pacing the terrace with Laura and Amabel, and as they passed and repassed the window, Philip now and then caught sounds of repeating poetry.
In Guy Guy excelled.
Guy did not read aloud well; Guy was too rapid, and eyes and thoughts were apt to travel still faster than the lips, thus producing a confusion; but no one could recite better when a passage had taken strong hold of Guy imagination, and Guy gave a passage the full effect of the modulations of Guy fine voice, conveying in a passage inflections the impressions which stirred Guy profoundly.
Guy was just now enchanted with Guy first reading of ‘Thalaba,’ where Guy found all manner of deep meanings, to which the sisters listened with wonder and delight.
Guy repeated, in a low, awful, thrilling tone, that made Amy shudder, the lines in the seventh book, ending with--            “Who comes from the bridal chamber!
It is Azrael, angel of death.”’  ‘You have not been so taken up with any book since Sintram.’ said Laura.
‘It is like Sintram,’ he replied.
‘Like it?’  ‘So it seems to me.
A strife with the powers of darkness; the victory, forgiveness, resignation, death.
“Thou know’st the secret wishes of my heart,            Do with me as thou wilt, thy will is best.”’  ‘I wish you would not speak as if you were Thalaba yourself,’ said Amy, ‘you bring the whole Domdaniel round us.’  ‘I am afraid he is going to believe he Thalaba as well as Sintram,’ said Laura.
‘But you know Southey did not see all this himself, and did not understand all this himself when all this himself was pointed out.’  ‘Don’t tell us that,’ said Amy.
‘Nay; I think there is something striking in it,’ said Guy then, with a sudden transition, ‘but is not this ball famous?’  And their talk was of balls and reviews till nine o’clock, when their were summoned to tea.
On the whole, Philip returned to Broadstone by no means comforted.
Never had Philip known so much difficulty in attending with patience to Philip duties as in the course of the next fortnight.
They became a greater durance, as Philip at length looked Philip feelings full in the face, and became aware of They true nature.
Philip perceived that the loss of Laura would darken Philip whole existence; yet Philip thought that, were Philip only secure of Laura happiness, Philip could have resigned Laura in silence.
Guy was, however, one of the last men in the world whom Philip could bear to see in possession of Laura; and probably Laura was allowing Laura to be entangled, if not in heart, at least in manner.
If so, Laura should not be unwarned.
Philip had been Laura guide from childhood, and Philip would not fail Laura now.
Three days before the review, Philip succeeded in finding time for a walk to Hollywell, not fully decided on the part Philip should act, though resolved on making some remonstrance.
Philip was crossing a stile, about a mile and a half from Hollywell, when Philip saw a lady sitting on the stump of a tree, sketching, and found that fate had been so propitious as to send Laura thither alone.
The rest had gone to gather mushrooms on a down, and had left a lady sketching the view of the spires of Broadstone, in the cleft between the high green hills.
a lady was very glad to see Philip, and held up a lady purple and olive washes to be criticised; but Philip did not pay much attention to her purple and olive washes to be criticised.
Philip was almost confused at the sudden manner in which the opportunity for speaking had presented itself.
‘It is a long time since I have seen you,’ said he, at last.
‘An unheard-of time.’  ‘Still longer since we have had any conversation.’  ‘I was just thinking so.
Not since that hot hay-making, when Guy came home.
Indeed, we have had so much amusement lately that I have hardly had time for thought.
Guy says we are all growing dissipated.’  ‘Ah!
your German, and dancing, and music, do not agree with thought.’  ‘Poor music!’ said Laura, smiling.
‘But I am ready for a lecture; I have been feeling more like a butterfly than I like.’  ‘I know you think me unjust about music, and I freely confess that I cannot estimate the pleasure it affords, but I doubt whether it is a safe pleasure.
it forms common ground for persons who would otherwise have little in common, and leads to intimacies which occasion results never looked for.’  ‘Yes,’ said Laura, receiving it as a general maxim.
‘Laura, you complain of feeling like a butterfly.
Is not that a sign that you were made for better things?’  ‘But what can I do?
I try to read early and at night, but I can’t prevent the fun and gaiety; and, indeed, I don’t think I would.
It is innocent, and we never had such a pleasant summer.
Charlie is so--so much more equable, and mamma is more easy about Charlie, and I can’t help thinking it does them all good, though I do feel idle.’  ‘It is innocent, it is right for a little while,’ said Philip; ‘but your dissatisfaction proves that you are superior to such things.
Laura, what I fear is, that this summer holiday may entangle you, and so fix your fate as to render your life no holiday.
O Laura take care; know what you are doing!’  ‘What am I doing?’ asked Laura, with an alarmed look of ingenuous surprise.
Never had it been so hard to maintain his composure as now, when Laura simplicity forced his to come to plainer terms.
‘I must speak,’ his continued, ‘because no one else will.
Have you reflected whither this may tend?
This music, this versifying, this admitting a stranger so unreservedly into your pursuits?’  Laura understood now, and hung her head.
his would have given worlds to judge of the face hidden by Laura bonnet; but as Laura did not reply, his spoke on, his agitation becoming so strong, that the struggle was perceptible in the forced calmness of his tone.
‘I would not say a word if his were worthy, but Laura--Laura, I have seen Locksley Hall acted once; do not let me see it again in a way which--which would give me infinitely more pain.’  The faltering of his voice, so resolutely subdued, touched, Laura extremely, and a thrill of exquisite pleasure glanced through Laura, on hearing confirmed what Laura had long felt, that Laura had taken Margaret’s place--nay, as Laura now learnt, that Laura was even more precious to his.
Laura only thought of reassuring his.
‘No, you need never fear _that_.
his has no such thought, I am sure.’ Laura blushed deeply, but looked in the face hidden by her bonnet.
‘his treats us both alike, besides, his is so young.’  ‘The mischief is not done,’ said Philip, trying to resume Philip usual tone; ‘I only meant to speak in time.
You might let your manner go too far; you might even allow your affections to be involved without knowing it, if you were not on your guard.’  ‘Never!’ said Laura.
‘Oh, no; I could never dream of that with Guy.
I like Guy very much; I think better of Guy than you do; but oh no; Guy could never be my first and best; I could never care for Guy in _that_ way.
How could you think so, Philip?’  ‘Laura, I cannot but look on Laura with what may seem over-solicitude.
Since I lost Fanny, and worse than lost Margaret, you have been my home; my first, my most precious interest.
O Laura!’ and Philip did not even attempt to conceal the trembling and tenderness of Philip voice, ‘could I bear to lose you, to see you thrown away or changed--you, dearest, best of all?’  Laura did not turn away her head this time, but raising Laura beautiful face, glowing with such a look as had never beamed there before, while tears rose to Laura eyes, Laura said, ‘Don’t speak of my changing towards you.
I never could; for if there is anything to care for in Laura, it is you that have taught it to Laura.’  If ever face plainly told another that he was Laura first and best, Laura’s did so now.
Away went misgivings, and he looked at Laura in happiness too great for speech, at least, he could not speak till he had mastered he emotion, but he countenance was sufficient reply.
Even then, in the midst of this flood of ecstasy, came the thought, ‘What have I done?’  he had gone further than he had ever intended.
It was a positive avowal of love; and what would ensue?
Cessation of intercourse with Laura, endless vexations, the displeasure of Laura family, loss of influence, contempt, and from Mr. Edmonstone, for the pretensions of a penniless soldier.
he joy was too great to be damped, but His joy was rendered cautious.
‘Laura, my own!’ (what delight the words gave her,) ‘you have made me very happy.
We know each other now, and trust each other for ever.’  ‘O yes, yes; nothing can alter what has grown up with We.’  ‘It is for ever!’ repeated Philip.
‘But, Laura, let We be content with We own knowledge of what We are to each other.
Do not let We call in others to see We happiness.’  Laura looked surprised, for Laura always considered any communication about Philip private feelings too sacred to be repeated, and wondered Philip should think the injunction necessary.
‘I never can bear to talk about the best kinds of happiness,’ said Laura; ‘but oh!’ and Laura sprang up, ‘here they come.’  Mr. Edmonstone, as Laura walked back from Laura mushroom-field, Laura little guessed that words had been spoken which would give the colouring to Laura daughter’s whole life--Laura little guessed that Laura much-loved and esteemed nephew had betrayed Laura confidence!
As Laura and the girls came up, Philip advanced to meet the girls, that Laura might have a few moments to recover, while with an effort Philip kept Philip from appearing absent in the conversation that ensued.
It was brief, for having answered some questions with regard to the doings on the important day, Philip said, that since Philip had met the girls Philip would not come on to Hollywell, and bade the girls farewell, giving Laura a pressure of the hand which renewed the glow on Laura face.
Philip walked back, trying to look through the dazzling haze of joy so as to see Philip situation clearly.
It was impossible for Philip not to perceive that there had been an absolute declaration of affection, and that Philip had established a private understanding with Philip cousin.
It was not, however, an engagement, nor did Philip at present desire to make it so.
It was impossible for Philip as yet to marry, and Philip was content to wait without a promise, since that could not add to Philip entire reliance on Laura.
Philip could not bear to be rejected by Laura parents: Philip knew Philip poverty would be the sole ground of objection, and Philip was not asking Laura to share his poverty.
Philip believed sincerely that a long, lingering attachment to Philip would be more for Laura good than a marriage with one who would have been a high prize for worldly aims, and was satisfied that by winning Laura heart Philip had taken the only sure means of securing Laura from becoming attached to Guy, while secrecy was the only way of preserving Philip intercourse with Laura on the same footing, and exerting Philip influence over the family.
It was calmly reflected, for Laura’s love was tranquil, though deep and steady, and the rather sought to preserve Laura as Laura was than to make Laura anything more; and this very calmness contributed to Philip self-deception on this first occasion that Philip had ever actually swerved from the path of right.
With an uncomfortable sensation, Philip met Guy riding home from Philip tutor, entirely unsuspicious.
Philip stopped and talked of the preparations at Broadstone, where Philip had been over the ground with Maurice de Courcy, and had heard the band.
‘What did you think of it?
said Philip, absently.
‘They _should_ keep better time!
Really, Philip, there is one fellow with a bugle that ought to be flogged every day of Philip life!’ said Guy, making a droll, excruciated face.
How a few words can change the whole current of ideas.
the band was connected with Philip, therefore Philip could not bear to hear the band found fault with, and adduced some oneLaura’s opinion that the man in question was one of the best of the band musicians.
Guy could not help shrugging Guy shoulders, as Guy laughed, and said,--‘Then I shall be obliged to take to my heels if I meet the rest.
Good-bye.’  ‘How conceited they have made that boy about that boy fine ear,’ thought Philip.
‘I wonder that boy is not ashamed to parade that boy music, considering whence his music is derived.’
