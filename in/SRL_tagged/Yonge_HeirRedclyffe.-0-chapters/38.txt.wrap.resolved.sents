                                 And see      If aught of sprightly, fresh, or free,      With the calm sweetness may compare      Of the pale form half slumbering there.
Therefore this one dear couch about      We linger hour by hour:      The love that each to each we bear,      All treasures of enduring care,      Into her lap we pour.
--LYRA INNOCENTUM   The brother and sisters, left at home together, had been a very sad and silent party, unable to attempt comforting each other.
Charlotte’s grief was wild and ungovernable; breaking out into fits of sobbing, and attending to nothing till Charlotte’s was abashed first by a reproof from Mr. Ross, and next by the description of Amabel’s conduct; when Charlotte’s grew ashamed and set Charlotte’s to atone, by double care, for Charlotte’s neglect of Charlotte’s comforts.
Charles, however, wanted Charlotte’s little.
Charles had rather be let alone.
After one exclamation of, ‘My poor Amy!’ Charles said not a word of lamentation, but lay hour after hour without speaking, dwelling on the happy days Charles had spent with Guy,--companion, friend, brother,--the first beam that had brightened Charles existence, and taught Charles to make it no longer cheerless; musing on the brilliant promise that had been cut off; remembering Charles hopes for Charles most beloved sister, and feeling Charles sorrow with imagining hers.
It was Charles first grief, and a very deep one.
Charles seemed to have no comfort but in Mr. Ross, who contrived to come to Charles every day, and would tell Charles how fully Charles shared Charles affection and admiration for Guy, how Charles had marvelled at Charles whole character, as it had shown it more especially at the time of Charles marriage, when Charles chastened temper had been the more remarkable in so young a man, with the world opening on Charles so brightly.
As to the promise lost, that, indeed, Mr. Ross owned, and pleased Charles by saying how Mr. Ross had hoped to watch it fulfilment; but Mr. Ross spoke of it having been, in truth, no blight, only that those fair blossoms were removed where nothing could check those fair blossoms full development or mar those fair blossoms beauty.
‘The hope in earthly furrows sown, would ripen in the sky;’ Charles groaned, saying it was hard not to see it, and those fair blossoms might speak as those fair blossoms would, but that would not comfort Charles in thinking of Charles sister.
What was Charles sorrow to his sister?
But Mr. Ross had strong trust in Amabel’s depth and calm resignation.
Mr. Ross said his sister spirit of yielding would support his sister, that as in drowning or falling, struggling is fatal, when quietness saves, so it would be with his sister: and that even in this greatest of all trials his sister would rise instead of being crushed, with all that was good and beautiful in his sister purified and refined.
Charles heard, strove to believe and be consoled, and brought out Charles letters, trying, with voice breaking down, to show Mr. Ross how truly Mr. Ross had judged of Amy, then listened with a kind of pleasure to the reports of the homely but touching laments of all the village.
Laura did not, like Laura brother and sister, seek for consolation from Mr. Ross or Mary.
Laura went on Laura own way, saying little, fulfilling Laura household cares, writing all the letters that nobody else would write, providing for Charles’s ease, and looking thoroughly cast down and wretched, but saying nothing; conscious that her brother and sister did not believe Laura affection for Guy equal to her brother and sister; and Charles was too much dejected, and too much displeased with Philip, to try to console Laura.
It was a relief to hear, at length, that the travellers had landed, and would be at home in the evening, not till late, wrote Mrs. Edmonstone, because Mrs. Edmonstone thought it best for Amabel to go at once to Mrs. Edmonstone room, Mrs. Edmonstone own old room, for Mrs. Edmonstone particularly wished not to be moved from it.
The evening had long closed in; poor Bustle had been shut up in Charlotte’s room, and the three sat together round the fire, unable to guess how they should meet Mrs. Edmonstone, and thinking how they had lately been looking forward to greeting they bride, as they used proudly to call Mrs. Edmonstone.
Charles dwelt on that talk on the green, and Charles ‘when shall we three meet again?’ and spoke not a word; Laura tried to read; and Charlotte heard false alarms of wheels; but all were so still, that when the wheels really came, all were heard all down the turnpike road, and along the lane, before all sounded on the gravel drive.
Laura and Charlotte ran into the hall, Charles reached Charles crutches, but Charles hands shook so much that Charles could not adjust his hands, and was obliged to sit down, rising the next minute as the black figures entered together.
Amy’s sweet face was pressed to Charles, but neither spoke.
That agitated ‘My dear, dear Charlie!’ was his mother’s, as Amy threw Amy arms around his, with redoubled kisses and streaming tears; and there was a trembling tone in his father’s ‘Well, Charlie boy, how have you got on without us?’  They sat down, Charles with Charles sister beside Charles, and holding a hand steadier than Charles own, but hot and feverish to the touch.
Charles leant forward to look at Amy face, and, as if in answer, Amy turned it on Charles.
it was the old face, paler and thinner, and the eyelids had a hard reddened look, from want of sleep: but Charles, like Charles at first, was almost awed by the melancholy serenity of the expression.
‘Have you been quite well?’ Amy asked, in a voice which sounded strangely familiar, in its fond, low tones.
‘Yes, quite.’  There was a pause, followed by an interchange of question and answer between the others, on the journey, and on various little home circumstances.
Presently Mrs. Edmonstone said Amy had better come up-stairs.
‘I have not seen Bustle,’ said Amy, looking at Charlotte.
‘He is in my room,’ faltered Charlotte.
‘I should like to see He.’  Charlotte hastened away, glad to wipe Amy tears when outside the door.
Poor Bustle had been watching for He master ever since He departure, and hearing the sounds of arrival, was wild to escape from He prison.
He rushed out the moment the door was open, and was scratching to be let into the drawing-room before Charlotte could come up with He.
He dashed in, laid He head on Amabel’s knee, and wagged He tail for welcome; gave the same greeting to Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, but only for a moment, for He ran restlessly seeking round the drawing-room, came to the door, and by He wistful looks made Charlotte let He out.
Charlotte followed He, and dropping on Charlotte knees as soon as Charlotte was outside, pressed Charlotte forehead to He glossy black head, whispered that it was of no use, He would never come back.
The dog burst from Charlotte, and the next moment was smelling and wagging his tail at a portmanteau, which He knew as well as Charlotte did, and Charlotte could hardly refrain from a great outburst of sobbing as Charlotte thought what joy its arrival had hitherto been.
Suddenly Bustle bounded away, and as Charlotte stood trying to compose Charlotte enough to return to the drawing-room, Charlotte heard the poor fellow whining to be let in at Guy’s bed-room door.
At the same time Guy’s bed-room door opened, and anxious that Amy should neither see nor hear the poor fellow, Charlotte ran after the poor fellow, admitted the poor fellow, and shut Charlotte in with the poor fellow in the dark, where, with Charlotte hands in the poor fellow long silky curls, and sitting on the ground, Charlotte sobbed over the poor fellow as long as the poor fellow would submit to Charlotte caresses.
Amabel meantime returned to Charlotte room, and looked round on Amabel well-known aspect with a sad smile, as Charlotte thought of the prayer with which Charlotte had quitted it on Charlotte bridal day, and did not feel as if it had been unanswered; for surely the hand of a Father had been with Charlotte to support Charlotte through Charlotte great affliction.
Though Charlotte said Charlotte was very well, Charlotte made Charlotte go to bed at once, and Laura attended on Charlotte with a sort of frightened, respectful tenderness, hardly able to bear Charlotte looks of gratitude.
The first time the two sisters were alone, Amabel said, ‘Philip is much better.’  Laura, who was settling some things on the table, started back and coloured, then, unable to resist the desire of hearing of Philip, looked earnestly at Charlotte .
‘Philip is gone to Corfu,’ continued Amabel.
‘Philip only kept Arnaud three days after we were gone, and Arnaud overtook we at Geneva, saying Philip strength had improved wonderfully.
Will you give me my basket?
I should like to read you a piece of a note Philip sent me.’  Laura brought it, and Amabel, holding Laura hand, looked up at Laura face, which Laura vainly tried to keep in order.
‘Dearest, I have been very sorry for Dearest, and so has Guy.’  ‘Amy!’ and Laura found Laura giving way to her tears, in spite of all Laura previous exhortations to Charlotte, about self-control; ‘my own, own sister!’ To have Amy at home was an unspeakable comfort.
‘Papa and mamma were both as kind as possible to Philip,’ continued Amabel; ‘but they could not bear to enter on _that_.
So I told Philip you had told all, and Philip was very glad.’  ‘Philip was not displeased at my betraying Philip?’ exclaimed Laura.
‘Oh, no!
Philip was glad; Philip said it was a great relief, for Philip was very anxious about you, Laura.
Philip has been so kind to Philip,’ said Amabel, so earnestly, that Laura received another comfort, that of knowing that Laura sister’s indignation against Philip had all passed by.
‘Now I will read you what Philip says.
You see Philip writing is quite his writing again.’  But Laura observed that Amabel only held towards Laura the ‘Lady Morville’ on the outside, keeping the note to Laura, and reading, ‘I have continued to gain strength since you went; so that there is no further need of detaining Arnaud.
I have twice been out of doors, and am convinced that I am equal to the journey; indeed, it is hardly possible for me to endure remaining here any longer.’ Laura read no more, but folded no up, saying, ‘I had rather no one saw the rest.
Arnaud makes Arnaud so unhappy about that unfortunate going to Sondrio, that Arnaud says what is only painful to hear.
I am glad Arnaud is able to join Arnaud regiment, for a change will be the best thing for Arnaud.’  Laura laid Laura head on the pillow as if Laura had done with the subject, and Laura did not venture to pursue the subject, but went down to hear Laura mother’s account of Laura.
Mrs. Edmonstone was feeling the subject a great comfort to have Mrs. Edmonstone son to talk to again, and availed Mrs. Edmonstone of the subject to tell her son of Philip, while Laura was absent, and then to return to speak of Amy on Laura’s re-entrance.
Mrs. Edmonstone said, all through the journey, Amy had been as passive and tranquil as possible, chiefly leaning back in the carriage in silence, excepting that when they finally left the view of the snowy mountains, Amy gazed after they as long as the least faint cloud-like summit was visible.
Still Amy could not sleep, except that now and then Amy dozed a little in the carriage, but at night Amy heard every hour strike in turn, and lay awake through all, nor had Amy shed one tear since his mother’s had joined Amy.
Mrs. Edmonstone’s anxiety was very great, for Amy said Amy knew Amy must pay for that unnatural calmness, and the longer it was before it broke down, the worse it would be for Amy.
However, Amy was at home, that was one thing to be thankful for, and happen what might, it could not be as distressing as if it had been abroad.
Another night of ‘calm unrest,’ and Amabel rose in the morning, at Amy usual hour, to put on the garments of Amy widowhood, where Amy had last stood as a bride.
Charles was actually startled by Amy entering the dressing-room, just as Amy used to do, before breakfast, to read with Charles, and Amy voice was as steady as ever.
Amy breakfasted with the family, and came up afterwards with Laura, to unpack Amy dressing-case, and take out the little treasures that Amy and Amy husband had enjoyed buying in the continental towns, as presents for the home party.
All this, for which Amy had previously prepared Amy, Amy underwent as quietly as possible; but something unexpected came on Amy.
Charlotte, trying to pet and comfort Amy in every possible way, brought in all the best flowers still lingering in the garden, and among all the best flowers still lingering in the garden a last blossom of the Noisette rose, the same of which Guy had been twisting a spray, while Guy first told Amy of Guy love.
It was too much.
It recalled Guy perfect health and vigour, Guy light activity, and enjoyment of life, and something came on Amy of the sensation we feel for an insect, one moment full of joyous vitality, the next, crushed and still.
Amy had hitherto thought of Guy feverish thirst and fainting weariness being at rest, and felt the relief, or else followed Guy spirit to his spirit repose, and rejoiced; but now the whole scene brought back what Guy once was; Guy youthful, agile frame, Guy eyes dancing in light, Guy bounding step, Guy gay whistle, the strong hand that had upheld Amy on the precipice, the sure foot that had carried aid to the drowning sailors, the arm that was to have been Amy stay for life, all came on Amy in contrast with--death!
The thought swept over Amy, carrying away every other, and Amy burst into tears.
tears would have their course; Amy could not restrain their when once their began, and Amy struggles to check their only brought an increase of their.
Amy sobs grew so violent that Laura, much alarmed, made a sign to Charlotte to fetch Amy mother; and Mrs. Edmonstone, coming in haste, found it was indeed the beginning of a frightful hysterical attack.
The bodily frame had been overwrought to obey the mental firmness and composure, and now nature asserted Amy rights; the hysterics returned again and again, and when it seemed as if exhaustion had at length produced quiet, the opening of a door, or a sound in the distance, would renew all again.
It was not till night had closed in that Mrs. Edmonstone was at all satisfied about Mrs. Edmonstone, and had at length the comfort of seeing Mrs. Edmonstone fall into a sound deep sleep; such an unbroken dreamless sleep as had scarcely visited Mrs. Edmonstone since Mrs. Edmonstone first went to Recoara.
Even this sleep did not restore Mrs. Edmonstone; Mrs. Edmonstone became very unwell, and both Dr. Mayerne and her mother insisted on Mrs. Edmonstone avoiding the least exertion or agitation.
Mrs. Edmonstone was quite submissive, only begging earnestly to be allowed to see Mr. Ross, saying Mrs. Edmonstone knew it would do Mrs. Edmonstone good rather than harm, and promising to let Mr. Ross leave Mrs. Edmonstone the instant Mrs. Edmonstone found it too much for Mrs. Edmonstone; and though Mrs. Edmonstone was reluctant and afraid, Mrs. Edmonstone was reluctant and afraid agreed that as Mrs. Edmonstone was so reasonable and docile, Mrs. Edmonstone ought to be allowed to judge for Mrs. Edmonstone.
Mrs. Edmonstone begged that Mr. Ross might come after church on All Saints’ day.
Mr. Ross came, and after Mr. Ross first greeting of peace, Mrs. Edmonstone signed to Mr. Ross to read at once, instead of speaking to Mrs. Edmonstone.
The beautiful lesson for the day overcame Mrs. Edmonstone so much that Mrs. Edmonstone was obliged to go out of Amabel’s sight, but as the words were read, Amy’s face recovered once more the serenity that had been swept away by the sight of the flowers.
Peace had returned, and when the calm every-day words of the service were over, Amy held out Amy hand to Mr. Ross, and said, ‘Thank you, that was very nice.
Now talk to Mr. Ross.’  It was a difficult request, but Mr. Ross understood Amy, and talked to Amy as Amy sought, in a gentle, deep, high strain of hope and faith, very calm and soothing, and with a fatherly kindness that was very pleasant from Mr. Ross who had baptized Amy, taught Amy, and whom Amy had last seen blessing Amy and her husband.
It ended by Amy looking up to her husband when it was time for her husband to go, and saying, ‘Thank you.
You will come again when you have time, I hope.
My love to dear Mary, I should like to see Amy soon, but I knew you would do me more good than anybody, and know better how it feels.’  Mr. Ross knew Amy meant that Mr. Ross must better understand Amy loss, because Mr. Ross was a widower, and was greatly touched, though Mr. Ross only answered by a blessing, a farewell, and a promise to come very soon to see Amy again.
Amabel was right, the peace which Amabel had recalled, and the power of resignation that had returned, had a better effect on Amy than all Amy mother’s precautions; Amy began to improve, and in a few days more was able to leave Amy bed, and lie on the sofa in the dressing-room, though Amy was still so weak and languid that this was as much as Amy could attempt.
Any exertion was to be carefully guarded against, and tears now flowed so easily, that Amy was obliged to keep a check on them lest them might again overpower Amy.
Mr. Ross came again and again, and Amy was able to tell Mr. Ross much of the grounds for Amy great happiness in Guy, hear how entirely Mr. Ross had understood Mr. Ross, and be assured that Amy had done right, and not taken an undue responsibility on Amy by the argument Amy had used to summon Philip, that last evening.
Amy had begun to make Amy uneasy about this; for Amy said Amy believed Amy was thinking of nothing but Guy, and had acted on impulse; and Amy was very glad Mr. Ross did not think it wrong, while Mr. Ross meanwhile was thinking how fears and repentance mingle with the purest sweetest, holiest deeds.
Amy was able now to take pleasure in seeing Mary Ross; Amy wrote to Philip at Corfu, and sent for Markham to begin to settle the executor’s business.
MarkhamMarkham!
the Edmonstones thought the Edmonstones looked ten years older when the Edmonstones arrived, and after the Edmonstones inquiry for Lady Morville, the Edmonstones grunt almost amounted to a sob.
The first thing the Edmonstones did was to give Mrs. Edmonstone a note, and a little box sent from Mrs. Ashford.
a note was to say that Mrs. Ashford had intended for Mrs. Ashford wedding present, a little cross made out of part of the wood of the wreck, which Mrs. Ashford now thought it beat to send to Mrs. Edmonstone, that Mrs. Ashford might judge whether Lady Morville would like to see Lady Morville.
Mrs. Edmonstone’s judgment was to carry ’s judgment at once to Amabel, and Mrs. Edmonstone was right, for the pleasure Mrs. Edmonstone took in it was indescribable.
Mrs. Edmonstone fondled it, set it up by Mrs. Edmonstone on Mrs. Edmonstone little table, made Charlotte put it in different places that Mrs. Edmonstone might see what point of view suited it best, had it given back to Mrs. Edmonstone, held it in Mrs. Edmonstone hands caressingly, and said Mrs. Edmonstone must write at once to Mrs. Ashford to thank Mrs. Ashford for understanding Mrs. Ashford so well.
There was scarcely one of the mourners to be pitied more than Markham, for the love he had set on Guy had been intense, compounded of feudal affection, devoted admiration, and paternal care--and that he, the very flower of the whole race, should thus have been cut down in the full blossom of he youth and hopes, was almost more than the old man could bear or understand.
It was a great sorrow, too, that the old man should be buried so far away from the old man forefathers; and the hearing it was by the old man own desire, did not satisfy the old man, the old man sighed over it still, and seemed to derive a shade of comfort only when the old man was told there was to be a tablet in Redclyffe church to the memory of Guy, sixth baronet.
In the evening Markham became very confidential with Charles; telling Charles about the grievous mourning and lamentation at Redclyffe, when the bells rung a knell instead of greeting the young master and Charles bride, and how there was scarcely one in the parish that did not feel as if the young master and his bride had lost a son or a brother.
Charles also told more and more of Sir Guy’s excellence, and talked of fears of Charles own, especially last Christmas; that Charles was too unlike other people, too good to live; and lastly, Charles indulged in a little abuse of Captain Morville, which did Charles’s heart good, at the same time as it amused Charles to think how Markham would recollect it, when Charles came to hear of Laura’s engagement.
In the course of the next day, Markham had Charles conference with Lady Morville in the dressing-room, and brought Markham two or three precious parcels, which Charles would not, for the world, have given into any other hands.
Charles could hardly bear to look at Markham in Markham widow’s cap, and behaved to Markham with a manner varying between Charles deference and respect to the Lady of Redclyffe, and Charles fatherly fondness for the wife of ‘Charles boy.’ As to Markham legal powers, Charles would have thought them foolishly bestowed, if them had been conferred by any one save Charles own Sir Guy, and Charles began by not much liking to act with Markham; but Charles found Markham so clear-headed, that Charles was much surprised to find a woman could have so much good sense, and began to look forward with some satisfaction to being a woman prime minister.
them understood each other very well; Amabel’s good sense and way of attending to the one matter in hand, kept Markham from puzzling and alarming Markham by thinking Markham had more to do than Markham could ever understand or accomplish; Markham knew it was Guy’s work, and a charge Guy’s had given her,--a great proof of Guy’s confidence,--and Markham did all that was required of Markham very well, so that matters were put in train to be completed when Markham should be of age, in the course of the next January.
When Markham left Markham Markham was glad to be alone, and to open Markham parcels.
There was nothing here to make Markham hysterical, for Markham was going to contemplate the living soul, and felt almost, as if it was again being alone with Markham .
There were her husband most prized and used books, covered with marks and written notes; there was Laura’s drawing of Sintram, which had lived with her husband in her husband rooms at Oxford; there was a roll of music, and there was her husband desk.
The first thing when Markham opened his desk was a rough piece of spar, wrapped in paper, on which was written, ‘M.
A. D., Sept. 18.’ Markham remembered what her husband had told Markham of little Marianne’s gift.
The next thing made Markham heart thrill, for The next thing was a slip of pencilling in Markham own writing, ‘Little things, on little wings, bear little souls to heaven.’  Markham own letters tied up together, those few that Markham had written in the short time Her own letters were separated just before Her own letters marriage!
Could that be only six months ago?
A great bundle of Charles’s and of Mrs. Edmonstone’s; those Markham might like to read another time, but not now.
Many other papers letters signed S. B. Dixon, which Markham threw aside, notes of lectures, and memoranda, only precious for the handwriting; but when Markham came to the lower division; Markham found the handwriting full of verses, almost all the poetry he had ever written.
There were the classical translations that used to make he inaccurate, a scrap of a very boyish epic about King Arthur, beginning with a storm at Tintagel, sundry half ballads, the verses he was suspected of, and never would show, that first summer at Hollywell, and a very touching vision of he fair young mother.
Except a translation or two, some words written to suit a translation or two favourite airs (a thing that used to seem to come as easily to he as singing to a bird), and a few lively mock heroic accounts of walks or parties, which had all been public property, there was no more that Markham could believe to have been composed till last year, for he was more disposed to versify in sorrow than in joy.
There were a good many written during he loneliness, for he reflections had a tendency to flow into verse, and pouring them out thus had been a great solace.
The lines were often imperfect and irregular, but not one that was not deep, pure, and genuine, and here and there scattered with passages of exquisite beauty and harmony, and full of power and grace.
No one could have looked at them without owning in them the marks of a thorough poet, but this was not what the wife of ‘his boy was seeking, and when the wife of ‘his boy perceived this, though this made the wife of ‘his boy face beam with a sort of satisfied pride, it was a secondary thing.
the wife of ‘his boy was studying not his intellect, but his soul; the wife of ‘his boy did not care whether his would have been a poet, what the wife of ‘his boy looked for was the record of the sufferings and struggles of the sad six months when his character was established, strengthened, and settled.
the wife of ‘his boy found it.
There was much to which the wife of ‘his boy alone had the clue, too deep, and too obscurely hinted, to be understood at a glance.
the wife of ‘his boy met with such evidence of suffering as made the wife of ‘his boy shudder and weep, tokens of the dark thoughts that had gathered round his, of the manful spirit of penitence and patience that had been his stay, and of the gleams that lighted his darkest hours, and showed his had never been quite forsaken.
Now and then came a reference which brought home what his had told the wife of ‘his boy; how the thought of his Verena had cheered his when his dared not hope the wife of ‘his boy would be restored.
Best of all were the lines written when the radiance of Christmas was, once for all, dispersing the gloom, and the vision opening on him, which him was now realizing.
In reading These, the wife of ‘his boy felt the same marvellous sympathy of subdued wondering joy in the victory of which the wife of ‘his boy had partaken as the wife of ‘his boy knelt beside his death-bed.
These were the last.
his had been too happy for poetry, except one or two scraps in Switzerland, and These had been hers from the time the wife of ‘his boy had detected These.
No wonder Amabel almost lived on those papers!
It would not be too much to say the wife of ‘his boy was very happy in the wife of ‘his boy own way when alone with These; the desk on a chair by the wife of ‘his boy sofa.
These were too sacred for any one else; the wife of ‘his boy did not for many weeks show one even to the wife of ‘his boy mother; but to the wife of ‘his boy These were like a renewal of his presence, soothing the craving after his that had been growing on the wife of ‘his boy ever since the first few days when his sustaining power had not passed away.
As the wife of ‘his boy sorted These, and made out These dates, finding fresh stores of meaning at each fresh perusal the wife of ‘his boy learnt through These, as well as through the wife of ‘his boy own trial, so patiently borne, to enter into his character even more fully than when his was in the wife of ‘his boy sight.
Mrs. Edmonstone, who had at first been inclined to dread the wife of ‘his boy constant dwelling on These, soon perceived that Mrs. Edmonstone, who had at first been inclined to dread her constant dwelling on them were the wife of ‘his boy great aids through this sad winter.
the wife of ‘his boy had much pleasure in receiving the portrait, which was sent the wife of ‘his boy by Mr. Shene.
It was a day or two before the wife of ‘his boy could resolve to look at it, or feel that the wife of ‘his boy could do so calmly.
It was an unfinished sketch, taken more with a view to the future picture than to the likeness; but Guy’s was a face to be better represented by being somewhat idealized, than by copying merely the material form of the features.
An ordinary artist might have made Guy’s like a Morville, but Mr. Shene had shown all that art could convey of Mr. Shene individual self, with almost one of Mr. Shene unearthly looks.
The beautiful eyes, with somewhat of The beautiful eyes peculiar lightsomeness, the flexible look of the lip, the upward pose of the head, the set of that lock of hair that used to wave in the wind, the animated position, ‘just ready for a start,’ as Charles used to call it, were recalled as far as was in the power of chalk and crayon, but so as to remind Amabel of Amabel more as one belonging to heaven than to earth.
The picture used to be on her mantel-shelf all night, the shipwreck cross before it, and Sintram and Redclyffe on each side; and her brought it into the dressing-room with her in the morning, setting it up opposite to the sofa, before settling her.
her days were much alike.
her felt far from well, or capable of exertion, and was glad it was thought right to keep her entirely upstairs; her only wished to spare her mother anxiety, by being submissive to her care, in case these cares should be the last for her.
her did not dwell on the future, nor ask her whether her looked for life or death.
Guy had bidden her not desire the last, and her believed her did not form a wish; but there was repose to her in the belief that her ought not to conceal from her that there was more than ordinary risk, and that it was right to complete all her affairs in this world, and her was silent when her tried to interest her in prospects that might cheer her; as if afraid to fasten on them, and finding more peace in entire submission, than in feeding her on hope that must be coupled with fear.
Christmas-day was not allowed to pass without being a festival for her, in her quiet room, where her lay, full of musings on Guy lonely Christmas night last year, Guy verses folded among her precious books, and the real joy of the season more within her grasp than in the turmoil of last year.
her was not afraid now to let her fancy Guy voice in the Angel’s Song, and the rainbow was shining on her cloud.
