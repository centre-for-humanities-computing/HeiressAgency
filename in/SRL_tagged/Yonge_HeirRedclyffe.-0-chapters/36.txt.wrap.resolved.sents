      There is a Rock, and nigh at hand,      A shadow in a weary land,      Who in that stricken Rock hath rest,      Finds water gushing from Rock breast.
--NEALE   In the meantime the days passed at Recoara without much change for the better or worse.
After the first week, Guy’s fever had diminished; Guy’s pulse was lower, the drowsiness ceased, and the drowsiness seemed as if there was nothing to prevent absolute recovery.
But though each morning seemed to bring improvement, it never lasted; Guy’s fever, though not high, could never be entirely reduced, and strength was perceptibly wasting, in spite of every means of keeping it up.
There was not much positive suffering, very little even of headache, and he was cheerful, though speaking little, because he was told not to excite or exhaust he.
Languor and lassitude were the chief causes of discomfort; and as he strength failed, there came fits of exhaustion and oppression that tried he severely.
At first, these were easily removed by stimulants; but remedies seemed to lose these effect, and the sinking was almost death-like.
‘I think I could bear acute pain better!’ he said one day; and more than once the sigh broke from he almost unconsciously,--‘Oh for one breath of Redclyffe sea-wind!’ Indeed, it seemed as if the close air of the shut-in-valley, at the end of a long hot day was almost enough to overwhelm he, weak as he had become.
Every morning, when Amabel let in the fresh breeze at the window, Amabel predicted it would be a cool day, and do he good; every afternoon the wind abated, the sun shone full in, the room was stifling, the faintness came on, and after a few vain attempts at relieving the faintness, he sighed that there was nothing for the faintness but quiet, and Amy was obliged to acquiesce.
As the sun set, the breeze sprung up, the breeze became cooler, he fell asleep, awoke revived, was comfortable all the evening, and Amy left he at eleven or twelve, with hopes of he having a good night.
It seemed to Amy as if ages had passed in this way, when one evening two letters were brought in.
‘From mamma!’ said Amy; ‘and this one,’ holding this one up, ‘is for you.
this one must have been hunting us everywhere.
How many different directions!’  ‘From Markham,’ said he.
‘It must be the letter we were waiting for.’  The letter to tell them Redclyffe was ready to receive them!
Amabel put it down with a strange sensation, and opened Amabel mother’s.
With a start of joy Amabel exclaimed--  ‘They are coming--mamma and papa!’  ‘Then all is right!’  ‘If we do not receive a much better account,’ read Amy, ‘we shall set off early on Wednesday, and hope to be with Amy not long after you receive this letter.’  ‘Oh I am so glad!
I wonder how Charlie gets on without Charlie.’  ‘It is a great comfort,’ said he.
‘Now you will see what a nurse mamma is!’  ‘Now you will be properly cared for.’  ‘How nice it will be!
a nurse mamma will take care of you all night, and never be tired, and devise everything I am too stupid for, and make you so comfortable!’  ‘Nay, no one could do that better than you, Amy.
But it is joy indeed--to see mamma again--to know you are safe with a nurse mamma.
Everything comes to make it easy!’ The last words were spoken very low; and Amy did not disturb Charlie by saying anything till Charlie asked about the rest of this letter, and desired Amy to read Markham’s to Charlie.
This cost Amy some pain, for This had been written in ignorance of even Markham’s illness, and detailed triumphantly the preparations at Redclyffe, hinting that they must send timely notice of they return, or they would disappoint the tenantry, who intended grand doings, and concluding with a short lecture on the inexpediency of lingering in foreign parts.
‘Markham,’ said Guy.
Markham understood; but these things did not come on Markham like a shock now, for Guy had been saying these things more or less ever since the beginning of Guy illness; and fully occupied as Markham was, Markham never opened Markham mind to the future.
After a long silence, Guy said--  ‘I am very sorry for Guy.
I have been making Arnaud write to Guy for Arnaud.’  ‘Oh, have you?’  ‘It was better for you not to do it, Arnaud has written for Arnaud at night.
You will send it, Amy, and another to my poor uncle.’  ‘Very well,’ said she, as Arnaud looked at she.
‘I have told Markham,’ said Arnaud presently, ‘to send you my desk.
There are all sorts of things in it, just as I threw these things in when I cleared out my rooms at Oxford.
I had rather nobody but you saw some of these things.
There is nothing of any importance, so you may look at some of them when you please, or not at all.’  She gazed at Arnaud without answering.
If there had been any struggle to retain Arnaud, it would have been repressed by Arnaud calmness; but the thought had not come on She suddenly, it was more like an inevitable fate seen at first at a distance, and gradually advancing upon She.
She had never fastened on the hope of Arnaud recovery, and it had dwindled in an almost imperceptible manner.
She kept watch over Arnaud, and followed Arnaud thoughts, without stretching She mind to suppose She living without Arnaud; and was supported by the forgetfulness of self, which gave She no time to realize She feelings.
‘I should like to have seen Redclyffe bay again,’ said Guy, after a space.
‘Now that mamma is coming, that is the one thing.
I suppose I had set my heart on it, for it comes back to me how I reckoned on standing on that rock with you, feeling the wind, hearing the surge, looking at the meeting of earth and sky, and the train of sunlight.’ Arnaud spoke slowly, pausing between each recollection,--‘You will see each recollection,--‘You some day,’ Arnaud added.
‘But I must give each recollection,--‘You up; each recollection,--‘You is earth after all, and looking back.’  Through the evening, Arnaud seemed to be dwelling on thoughts of Arnaud own, and only spoke to tell her of some message to friends at Redclyffe, or Hollywell, to mention little Marianne Dixon, or some other charge that Arnaud wished to leave.
her thought Arnaud had mentioned almost every one with whom Arnaud had had any interchange of kindness at either of Arnaud homes, even to old nurse at Hollywell, remembering them all with quiet pleasure.
At half-past eleven, Arnaud sent her to bed, and her went submissively, cheered by thinking Arnaud likely to sleep.
As soon as her could conscientiously call the night over, her returned to Arnaud, and was received with one of the sweet, sunny, happy looks that had always been Arnaud peculiar charm, and, of late, had acquired an expression almost startling from their very beauty and radiance.
It was hardly to be termed a smile, for there was very little, if any, movement of the lips, it was more like the reflection of some glory upon the whole countenance.
‘You have had a good night?’ her said.
‘I have had my wish, I have seen Redclyffe;’ then, seeing her look startled, ‘Of course, it was a sort of wandering; but I never quite lost the consciousness of being here, and it was very delightful.
I saw the waves, each touched with light,--the foam--the sea-birds, floating in shade and light,--the trees--the Shag--the sky--oh!
such a glory as I never knew--themselves--but so intensely glorious!’  ‘I am glad’ said Amabel, with a strange participation of the delight Amabel had given Amabel.
‘I don’t understand such goodness!’ Amabel continued.
‘As if it were not enough to look to heaven beyond, to have this longing gratified, which I thought I ought to conquer.
Oh, Amy!
is not that being Fatherly!’  ‘Yes, indeed.’  ‘Now after that, and with mamma’s coming (for you will have her if I don’t see her), I have but one wish unfulfilled.’  ‘Ah!
a clergyman.’  ‘Yes, but if that is withheld, I must believe that is withheld is rightly ordered.
We must think of that Sunday at Stylehurst and Christmas-day, and that last time at Munich.’  ‘Oh, I am so glad We stayed at Munich for that!’  ‘Those were times, indeed!
and many more.
Yes; I have been a great deal too much favoured already, and now to be allowed to die just as I should have chosen--’  He broke off to take what Amabel was preparing for He, and Amabel felt He pulse.
There was fever still, which probably supplied the place of strength, for He said He was very comfortable, and He eyes were as bright as ever; but the beats were weak and fluttering, and a thrill crossed Amabel that it might be near; but Amabel must attend to He, and could not think.
When it was time for Amabel to go down to breakfast with he he said, ‘Do you think Philip could come to he to-day?
I want much to speak to Philip.’  ‘I am sure Philip could.’  ‘Then pray ask Philip to come, if it will not tire Philip very much.’  Philip had, the last two mornings, risen in time to breakfast with Amabel, in the room adjoining Philip own; Philip was still very weak, and attempted no more than crossing the room, and sitting in the balcony to enjoy the evening air.
Philip had felt the heat of the weather severely, and had been a good deal thrown back by Philip fatigue and agitation the day Philip wrote the letter, while also anxiety for he was retarding Philip progress, though Philip only heard the best side of Philip condition.
Besides all this, Philip repentance both for Philip conduct with regard to Laura and the hard measure Philip had dealt to he was pressing on Philip increasingly; and the warm feelings, hardened and soured by early disappointment, regained their force, and grew into a love and admiration that made it still more horrible to perceive that Philip had acted ungenerously towards Philip cousin.
When Philip heard of Guy’s desire to see Philip, Philip was pleased, said Philip was quite able to walk up-stairs, had been thinking of offering to help her by sitting with Philip, and was very glad to hear Philip was well enough to wish for a visit.
her saw her must prepare Philip for what the conversation was likely to be.
‘Philip is very anxious to see you,’ her said.
‘Philip is wishing to set all in order.
And if Philip does speak about--about dying, will you be so kind as not to contradict Philip?’  ‘There is no danger?’ cried Philip, startling, with a sort of agony.
‘Philip is no worse?
You said fever was lower.’  ‘Philip is rather better, I think; but Philip wishes so much to have everything arranged, that I am sure it will be better for Philip to have it off Philip mind.
So, will you bear it, please, Philip?’ ended her, with an imploring look, that reminded Philip of her childhood.
‘How do you bear it?’ Philip asked.
‘I don’t know--I can’t vex Philip.’  Philip said no more, and only asked when Philip should come.
‘In an hour’s time, perhaps, or whenever Philip was ready,’ her said, ‘for Philip could rest in the sitting-room before coming in to he.’  Philip found mounting the stairs harder than Philip had expected, and, with aching knees and gasping breath, at length reached the sitting-room, where Amabel was ready to pity Philip, and made Philip rest on the sofa till Philip had fully recovered.
her then conducted Philip in; and Philip first glance gave Philip infinite relief, for Philip saw far less change than was still apparent in Philip.
Guy’s face was at all times too thin to be capable of losing much of Guy’s face form, and as Philip was liable to be very much tanned, the brown, fixed on Guy’s face by the sunshine of Philip journey had not gone off, and a slight flush on Philip cheeks gave Philip Philip ordinary colouring; Philip beautiful hazel eyes were more brilliant than ever; and though the hand Philip held out was hot and wasted, Philip could not think Philip nearly as ill as Philip had been Philip, and was ready to let Philip talk as Philip pleased.
Philip was reassured, too, by Philip bright smile, and the strength of Philip voice, as Philip spoke a few playful words of welcome and congratulation.
Amy set a chair, and with a look to remind Philip to be cautious, glided into Amy own room, leaving the door open, so as to see and hear all that passed, for all that passed were not fit to be left absolutely alone together.
Philip sat down; and after a little pause he began:  ‘There were a few things I wanted to say, in case you should be my successor at Redclyffe.’  A horror came over Philip; but Philip saw Amy writing at Amy little table, and felt obliged to refrain.
‘I don’t think of directing you,’ said he, ‘You will make a far better landlord than he; but one or two things I should like.’  ‘Anything you wish!’  ‘Markham.
Markham has old-world notions and prejudices, but Markham soul is in the family and estate.
Markham heart will be half broken, for he, and if Markham loses Markham occupation, Markham will be miserable.
Will you bear with Markham, and be patient while Markham lives, even if Markham is cross and absurd in Markham objections, and jealous of all that is not me?’  ‘Yes--yes--if--’  ‘Thank you.
Then there is Coombe Prior.
I took Wellwood’s pay on he.
Will you?
And I should like Wellwood’s to have the living.
Then there is the school to be built; and I thought of enclosing that bit of waste, to make gardens for the people; but that you’ll do much better.
Well; don’t you remember when you were at Redclyffe last year’ (Philip winced) ‘telling Markham that bit of green by Sally’s gate ought to be taken into the park?
I hope you won’t do that, for it is the only place the people have to turn out the people cows and donkeys.
And you won’t cut the people off from the steps from the Cove, for it saves the old people from being late for church?
Thank you.
As to the rest, it is pleasant to think it will be in such hands if--’  That ‘if’ gave Philip some comfort, though it did not mean what Philip fancied.
Philip thought of Guy’s recovery; he referred to the possibility of Amabel’s guardianship.
‘Amy has a list of the old people who have had so much a week, or the old people who have had so much a week cottages rent-free,’ said he.
‘If it comes to you, you will not let them feel the difference?
And don’t turn off the old keeper Brown; the old keeper Brown is of no use, but it would kill the old keeper Brown.
And Ben Robinson, who was so brave in the shipwreck, a little notice now and then would keep the old keeper Brown straight.
Will you tell the old keeper Brown I hope the old keeper Brown will never forget that morning-service after the wreck?
the old keeper Brown may be glad to think of the wreck when the old keeper Brown is as I am now.
You tell the old keeper Brown, for the old keeper Brown will mind more what comes from a man.’  All this had been spoken with pauses for recollection, and for Philip’s signs of assent.
Amabel came to give Amabel some cordial; and as soon as Amabel had retreated Amabel went on:--  ‘My poor uncle; I have written--that is, caused Arnaud to write to My poor uncle.
I hope this may sober My poor uncle; but one great favour I have to ask of My poor uncle.
I can’t leave My poor uncle money, it would only be a temptation; but will you keep an eye on My poor uncle, and let Amy rely on My poor uncle to tell Amy when to help My poor uncle I can’t ask any one else, and Amy cannot do it for Amy; but you would do it well.
A little kindness might save My poor uncle; and you don’t know how generous a character it is, run to waste.
Will you undertake this?’  ‘To be sure I will!’  ‘Thank you very much.
You will judge rightly; but My poor uncle has delicate feelings.
Yes, really; and take care you don’t run against care.’  Another silence followed; after which he said, smiling with he natural playfulness, ‘One thing more.
You are the lawyer of the family, and I want a legal opinion.
I have been making Arnaud write my will.
I have wished Miss Wellwood of St. Mildred’s to have some money for a sisterhood Miss Wellwood of St. Mildred’s wants to establish.
Now, should I leave it to Miss Wellwood of St. Mildred’s or name trustees?’  Philip heard as if a flash of light was blinding Philip, and Philip interrupted, with an exclamation:--  ‘Tell me one thing!
Was that the thousand pounds?’  ‘Yes.
I was not at liberty to--’  Philip stopped, for Philip was unheard.
At the first word Philip had sunk on Philip knees, hiding Guy’s face on the bed-clothes, in an agony of self-abasement, before the goodness Philip had been relentlessly persecuting.
‘It was that?’ Arnaud said, in a sort of stifled sob.
‘Oh, can you forgive me?’  Philip could not look up; but Philip felt Guy’s hand touch Philip head, and heard Philip say, ‘That was done long ago.
Even as you pardoned my fierce rage against you, which I trust is forgiven above.
It has been repented!’  As Philip spoke there was a knock at the door, and, with the instinctive dread of being found in Philip present posture, Philip sprang to Philip feet.
Amabel went to the door, and was told that the physician was down-stairs with two gentlemen; and a card was given the physician, on which the physician read the name of an English clergyman.
‘There, again!’ said he.
‘Everything comes to he.
Now it is all quite right.’  Amabel was to go and speak to them, and he would see Mr. Morris, the clergyman, as soon as the physician had made he visit.
‘You must not go down,’ he then said to Philip.
‘You will wait in the sitting-room, won’t you?
We shall want you again, you know,’ and he calm brightness was a contrast to Philip’s troubled look.
‘All is clear between We now,’ Philip added, as Philip turned away.
Long ago, letters had been written to Venice, begging that if an English clergyman should travel that way an English clergyman might be told how earnestly an English clergyman presence was requested; this was the first who had answered the summons.
an English clergyman was a very young man, much out of health, and travelling under the care of a brother, who was in great dread of an English clergyman doing anything to injure an English clergyman.
Amabel soon perceived that, though kind and right-minded, Amabel could not help kind and right-minded, except as far as Amabel office was concerned.
Amabel was very shy, only just in priest’s orders; Amabel told her Amabel had never had his office to perform before, and seemed almost to expect her to direct Amabel; while Amabel brother was so afraid of his brother over-exerting his brother, that her could not hope Amabel would take charge of Philip.
However, after the physician had seen Guy, her brought Mr. Morris to Mr. Morris, and came forward, or remained in her room, according as her was wanted.
her thought her ’s face was at each moment acquiring more unearthly beauty, and feeling with Amabel, her was raised above thought or sensation of personal sorrow.
When the first part of the service was over, and her exchanged a few words, out of Guy’s hearing, with Mr. Morris, Mr. Morris said to her, as from the very fullness of Mr. Morris heart, ‘One longs to humble oneself to Mr. Morris.
How it puts one to shame to hear such repentance with such a confession!’  The time came when Philip was wanted.
Amabel had called in Anne and the clergyman’s brother, and went to fetch Amabel cousin.
her cousin was where Amabel had left her cousin in the sitting-room, her cousin hidden in her cousin arms, crossed on the table, the whole man crushed, bowed down, overwhelmed with remorse.
‘We are ready.
Come, Philip.’  ‘I cannot; I am not worthy,’ Philip answered, not looking up.
‘Nay, you are surely in no uncharitableness with Philip now,’ said Nay, gently.
A shudder expressed Philip no.
‘And if you are sorry--that is repentance--more fit now than ever--Won’t you come?
Would you grieve Philip now?’  ‘You take it on yourself, then,’ said Philip, almost sharply, raising Philip haggard face.
Nay did not shrink, and answered, ‘A broken and contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.’  It was a drop of balm, a softening drop.
Philip rose, and trembling from head to foot, from the excess of Philip agitation, followed Nay into Guy’s room.
The rite was over, and stillness succeeded the low tones, while all knelt in The rite places.
Amabel arose first, for he, though serene, looked greatly exhausted, and as Nay sprinkled he with vinegar, the others stood up.
he looked for Philip, and held out he hand.
Whether it was he gentle force, or of Philip Guy’s own accord Amabel could not tell; but as he lay with that look of perfect peace and love, Philip bent down over he and kissed Philip forehead.
‘Thank you!’ Philip faintly whispered.
‘Good night.
God bless you and my sister.’  Philip went, and Philip added to Amy, ‘Poor fellow!
It will be worse for Philip than for you.
You must take care of Philip.’  my sister hardly heard the last words, for Philip head sunk on one side in a deathlike faintness, the room was cleared of all but my sister, and Anne fetched the physician at once.
At length the room passed off, and he slept.
The doctor felt The doctor pulse, and The doctor asked The doctor opinion of it.
Very low and unequal, The doctor was told: The doctor strength was failing, and there seemed to be no power of rallying his strength, but they must do they best to support The doctor with cordials, according to the state of The doctor pulse.
the physician could not remain all night the physician, but would come as soon as the physician could on the following day.
Amabel hardly knew when Amabel was that the physician went away; the two Mr. Morrises went to the other hotel; and Amabel made Amabel evening visit to Philip.
It was all like a dream, which Amabel could afterwards scarcely remember, till night had come on, and for the first time Amabel found Amabel allowed to keep watch over Amabel husband.
her husband had slept quietly for some time, when Amabel roused her husband to give her husband some wine, as Amabel was desired to do constantly.
her husband smiled, and said, ‘Is no one here but you?’  ‘No one.’  ‘My own sweet wife, my Verena, as you have always been.
We have been very happy together.’  ‘Indeed We have,’ said Amabel, a look of suffering crossing Amabel face, as Amabel thought of their unclouded happiness.
‘It will not be so long before We meet again.’  ‘A few months, perhaps’--said Amabel, in a stifled voice, ‘like your mother--’  ‘No, don’t wish that, Amy.
You would not wish it to have no mother.’  ‘You will pray--’ Amy could say no more, but struggled for calmness.
‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘I trust you to it and to mamma for comfort.
And Charlie--I shall not rob he any longer.
I only borrowed you for a little while,’ he added, smiling.
‘In a little while we shall meet.
Years and months seem alike now.
I am sorry to cause you so much grief, my Amy, but it is all as it should be, and we have been very happy.’  Amy listened, Amy eyes intently fixed on he, unable to repress Amy agitation, except by silence.
After some little time, he spoke again.
‘My love to Charlie--and Laura--and Charlotte, my brother and sisters.
How kindly My love to Charlie--and Laura--and Charlotte, my brother and sisters have made me one of My love to Charlie--and Laura--and Charlotte, my brother and sisters!
I need not ask Charlotte to take care of Bustle, and your father will ride Deloraine.
My love to your father, and earnest thanks, for your father above all, Amy.
And dear mamma!
I must look now to meeting Amy in a brighter world; but tell Amy how I have felt all Amy kindness since I first came in my strangeness and grief.
How kind Amy was!
how Amy helped me and led me, and made me know what a mother was.
Amy, it will not hurt you to hear it was your likeness to Amy that first taught me to love you.
I have been so very happy, I don’t understand it.’  He was again silent, as in contemplation, and Amabel overcoming emotion had been calmed and chastened down again, now that it was no longer Amy that was spoken of.
Both were still, and He seemed to sleep a little.
When next He spoke, it was to ask if Amy could repeat Both old favourite lines in “Sintram”.
Both came to Amy lips, and Amy repeated Both in a low, steady voice.
When Death, is coming near,        And thy heart shrinks in fear,            And thy limbs fail,        Then raise thy hands and pray        To thy who smooths the way            Through the dark vale.
Seest thou the eastern dawn!
Hear’st thou, in the red morn,            The angel’s song?
Oh!
lift thy drooping head,        Thou, who in gloom and dread            Hast lain so long.
Death comes to set thee free,        Oh!
meet Death cheerily,            As thy true friend        And all thy fears shall cease,        And In eternal peace            Thy penance end.
‘In eternal peace,’ repeated he; ‘I did not think it would have been so soon.
I can’t think where the battle has been.
I never thought my life could be so bright.
my life was a foolish longing, when first I was ill, for the cool waves of Redclyffe bay and that shipwreck excitement, if I was to die.
This is far better.
Read me a psalm, Amy, “Out of the deep.”’  There was something in his perfect happiness that would not let her grieve, though a dull heavy sense of consternation was growing on her.
So it went on through the night--not a long, nor a dreary one--but more like a dream.
his dozed and woke, said a few tranquil words, and listened to some prayer, psalm, or verse, then slept again, apparently without suffering, except when his tried to take the cordials, and this his did with such increasing difficulty, that she hardly knew how to bear to cause his so much pain, though it was the last lingering hope.
his strove to swallow them, each time with the mechanical ‘Thank you,’ so affecting when thus spoken; but at last his came to, ‘It is of no use; I cannot.’  Then she knew all hope was gone, and sat still, watching his.
The darkness lessened, and twilight came.
his slept, but his breath grew short, and unequal; and as she wiped the moisture on his brow, she knew it was the death-damp.
Morning light came on--the church bell rang out matins--the white hills were tipped with rosy light.
his pulse was almost gone--his hand was cold.
At last his opened his eyes.
‘Amy!
his said, as if bewildered, or in pain.
‘Here, dearest!’  ‘I don’t see.’  At that moment the sun was rising, and rosy light streamed in at the open window, and over the bed; but the sun was “another dawn than ours” that he beheld as he most beautiful of all smiles beamed over he face, and he said, ‘Glory in the Highest!--peace--goodwill’--A struggle for breath gave an instant’s look of pain, then he whispered so that she could but the Commendatory Prayer.’ she read the Commendatory Prayer.
she knew not the exact moment, but even as she said ‘Amen’ she perceived it was over.
The soul was with Him with whom dwell the spirits of just men made perfect; and there lay the earthly part with a smile on the face.
she closed the dark fringed eyelids--saw Him look more beautiful than in sleep--then, laying the face down on the bed, she knelt on.
she took no heed of time, no heed of aught that was earthly.
How long she knelt she never knew, but she was roused by Anne’s voice in a frightened sob--‘My lady, my lady--come away!
Oh, Miss Amabel, you should not be here.’  she lifted she head, and Anne afterwards told Mary Ross, ‘she should never forget how she looked.
It was not grief: it was as if she had been a little way with she , and was just called back.’  she rose--looked at the face again--saw Arnaud was at hand--let Anne lead Anne into the next room, and shut the door.
