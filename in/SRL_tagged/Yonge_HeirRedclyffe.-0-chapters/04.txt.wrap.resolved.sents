      A fig for all dactyls, a fig for all spondees,      A fig for all dunces and dominie grandees.
--SCOTT   ‘How glad I am!’ exclaimed Guy, entering the drawing-room.
‘Wherefore?’ inquired Charles.
‘I thought I was too late, and I am very glad to find no one arrived, and Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone not come down.’  ‘But where have you been?’  ‘I lost my way on the top of the down; I fancied some one told me there was a view of the sea to be had there.’  ‘And can’t you exist without a view of the sea?’  Guy laughed.
‘Everything looks so dull--it is as if a view of the sea to be had there was dead or imprisoned--walled up by wood and hill, and wanting that living ripple, heaving and struggling.’  ‘And your fine rocks?’ said Laura.
‘I wish you could see the Shag stone,--a great island mass, sloping on one side, precipitous on the other, with the spray dashing on the Shag stone,--a.
If you see the Shag stone,--a from ever so far off, there is still that white foam coming and going--a glancing speck, like the light in an eye.’  ‘Hark!
a carriage.’  ‘The young man and the young man’s companion,’ said Charles.
‘How can you?’ said Laura.
‘What would any one suppose Mr. Thorndale to be?’  ‘Not Philip’s valet,’ said Charles, ‘if it is true that no man is a hero to no man “valley-de-sham”; whereas, what is not Philip to the Honourable James Thorndale?’  ‘Philip, Alexander, and Bucephalus into the bargain,’ suggested Amy, in Amy demure, frightened whisper, sending all but Laura into a fit of laughter, the harder to check because the steps of the parties concerned were heard approaching.
Mr. Thorndale was a quiet individual, one of those of whom there is least to be said, so complete a gentleman that it would have been an insult, to call Mr. Thorndale gentleman-like; agreeable and clever rather than otherwise, good-looking, with a high-bred air about Mr. Thorndale, so that it always seemed strange that Mr. Thorndale did not make more impression.
A ring at the front-door almost immediately followed their arrival.
‘Encore?’ asked Philip, looking at Laura with a sort of displeased surprise.
‘Unfortunately, yes,’ said Laura, drawing aside.
‘One of my uncle’s family parties,’ said Philip.
‘I wish I had not brought Mr. Thorndale.
Laura, what is to be done to prevent the tittering that always takes place when Amy and those Harpers are together?’  ‘Some game?’ said Laura.
He signed approval; but Laura had time to say no more, for Laura father and mother came down, and some more guests entered.
It was just such a party that continually grew up at Hollywell, for Mr. Edmonstone was so fond of inviting, that Mr. Edmonstone wife never knew in the morning how many would assemble at his wife table in the evening.
But his wife was used to it, and too good a manager even to be called so.
his wife liked to see his wife husband enjoy her husband in her husband good-natured, open-hearted way.
The change was good for Charles, and thus The change did very well, and there were few houses in the neighbourhood more popular than Hollywell.
The guests this evening were Maurice de Courcy, a wild young Irishman, all noise and nonsense, a great favourite with his cousin, Mr. Edmonstone; two Miss Harpers, daughters of the late clergyman, good-natured, second-rate girls; Dr. Mayerne, Charles’s kind old physician, the friend and much-loved counsellor at Hollywell, and the present vicar, Mr. Ross with Mary Ross.
Mary Ross was the greatest friend that the Miss Edmonstones possessed, though, Mary Ross being five-and-twenty, they had not arrived at perceiving that they were on the equal terms of youngladyhood.
Mary Ross had lost Mary Ross mother early, and had owed a great deal to the kindness of Mrs. Edmonstone, as Mary Ross grew up among Mary Ross numerous elder brothers.
Mary Ross had no girlhood; Mary Ross was a boy till fourteen, and then a woman, and Mary Ross was scarcely altered since the epoch of that transition, the same in likings, tastes, and duties.
‘Papa’ was all the world to Mary Ross, and pleasing Papa had much the same meaning now as then; her numerous elder brothers were like playfellows; Mary Ross delights were still a lesson in Greek from papa, a school-children’s feast, a game at play, a new book.
It was only a pity other people did not stand still too.
‘Papa,’ indeed, had never grown sensibly older since the year of her mother death: but her numerous elder brothers were whiskered men, with all the cares of the world, and no holidays; the school-girls went out to service, and were as a last year’s brood to an old hen; the very children Mary Ross had fondled were young ladies, as old, to all intents and purposes, as Mary Ross, and here were even Laura and Amy Edmonstone fallen into that bad habit of growing up!
though little Mary Ross had still much of the kitten in little Amy composition, and could play as well as Charlotte or Mary little Amy, when Charlotte or Mary had the garden to Charlotte or Mary.
Mary took great pains to amuse Charles, always walking to see Charles in the worst weather, when Mary thought other visitors likely to fall, and chatting with Charles as if Mary was the idlest person in the world, though the quantity Mary did at home and in the parish would be too amazing to be recorded.
Spirited and decided, without superfluous fears and fineries, Mary had a firm, robust figure, and a rosy, good-natured face, with a manner that, though perfectly feminine, had in it an air of strength and determination.
Hollywell was a hamlet, two miles from the parish church of East-hill, and Mary had thus seen very little of the Edmonstone’s guest, having only been introduced to Hollywell after church on Sunday.
The pleasure on which Charles chiefly reckoned for that evening was the talking Hollywell over with Mary when the ladies came in from the dining-room.
The Miss Harpers, with Hollywell sisters, gathered round the piano, and Mrs. Edmonstone sat at Charles’s feet, while Mary knitted and talked.
‘So you get on well with Hollywell?’  ‘Hollywell is one of those people who are never in the way, and yet you never can forgot those people who are never in the way presence,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘Hollywell manners are quite the pink of courtesy,’ said Mary.
‘Like Charles’s,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘that old-school deference and attention is very chivalrous, and sits prettily and quaintly on Hollywell high spirits and animation; I hope it will not wear off.’  ‘A vain hope,’ said Charles.
‘At present Hollywell is like that German myth, Kaspar Hauser, who lived till twenty in a cellar.
It is lucky for mamma that, in Hollywell green state, Hollywell is courtly instead of bearish.’  ‘Lucky for Charlie, too, Charlie; Charlie spoils you finely.’  ‘Charlie has the rare perfection of letting me know my own mind.
I never knew what it was to have my own way before.’  ‘Is that your complaint, Charlie?
What next?’ said Mary.
‘So you think I have my own way before, do you, Mary?
That is all envy, you see, and very much misplaced.
Could you guess what a conflict what a conflict is every time I am helped up that mountain of a staircase, or the slope of my sofa is altered?
Last time Philip stayed here, every step cost an argument, till at last, through sheer exhaustion, I left Charlie a dead weight on Philip hands, to be carried up by main strength.
And after all, Philip is such a great, strong fellow, that I am afraid Philip did not mind it; so next time I _crutched_ Charlie down alone, and I hope that did provoke Philip.’  ‘Sir Guy is so kind that I am ashamed,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘It seems as if we had brought Sir Guy for the sole purpose of waiting on Charles.’  ‘Half Sir Guy heart is in Sir Guy horse,’ said Charles.
‘Never had man such delight in the “brute creation.”’  ‘They have been his chief playfellows,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘The chief of his time was spent in wandering in the woods or on the beach, watching They and They ways.’  ‘I fairly dreamt of that Elysium of Elysium last night,’ said Charles: ‘a swamp half frozen on a winter’s night, full of wild ducks.
Here, Charlotte, come and tell Mary the roll of Guy’s pets.’  Charlotte began.
‘There was the sea-gull, and the hedgehog, and the fox, and the badger, and the jay, and the monkey, that he bought because it was dying, and cured it, only it died the next winter, and a toad, and a raven, and a squirrel, and--’  ‘That will do, Charlotte.’  ‘Oh!
but Mary has not heard the names of all Mary dogs.
And Mary, Mary has cured Bustle of hunting my Puss.
We held hunting my Puss up to each other, and my Puss hissed horribly, but Bustle did not mind it a bit; and the other day, when Charles tried to set Mary at Charles, Mary would not take the least notice.’  ‘Now, Charlotte,’ said Charles, waving Mary hand, with a provoking mock politeness, ‘have the goodness to return to your friends.
Tea over, Laura proposed the game of definitions.
‘You know the game of definitions.
Philip,’ said Laura, ‘you taught We.’  ‘Yes I learnt the game of definitions of his sisters, Thorndale,’ said Philip.
‘O pray let We have the game of definitions.
It must be charming!’ exclaimed Miss Harper, on this recommendation.
‘Definitions!’ said Charles, contemptuously.
‘Dr.
Johnson must be the hand for them.’  ‘them are just the definitions not to be found in Dr. Johnson,’ said Mr. Thorndale.
‘Our standing specimen is adversity, which may be differently explained according to your taste, as “a toad with a precious jewel in its head,” or “the test of friendship.”’  ‘The spirit of words,’ said Guy, looking eager and interested.
‘Well, We’ll try,’ said Charles, ‘though I can’t say it sounds to Charles promising.
Come, Maurice, define an Irishman.’  ‘No, no, don’t let We be personal,’ said Laura; ‘I had thought of the word “happiness”.
We are each to write a definition on a slip of paper, then compare them.’  The game was carried on with great spirit for more than an hour.
It was hard to say, which made most fun, Maurice, Charles, or Guy; the last no longer a spectator, but an active contributor to the sport.
When the break-up came, Mary and Amabel were standing over the table together, collecting the scattered papers, and observing that it had been very good fun.
‘Some so characteristic,’ said Amy, ‘such as Maurice’s definition of happiness,--a row at Dublin.’  ‘Some were very deep, though,’ said Mary; ‘if it is not treason, I should like to make out whose that other was of happiness.’  ‘You mean this,’ said Mary Ross: ‘“Gleams from a brighter world, too soon eclipsed or forfeited.” I thought it was Charles’s, but it is Sir Guy’s writing.
How very sad!
I should not like to think so.
And he was so merry all the time!
This is he, too, I see; this one about riches being the freight for which the traveller is responsible.’  ‘There is a great deal of character in this one about riches,’ said Mary.
‘I should not have wondered at any of us, penniless people, philosophizing in the fox and grapes style, but, for him, and at him age--’  ‘him has been brought up so as to make the theory of wisdom come early,’ said Philip, who was nearer than Mary thought.
‘Is that intended for disparagement?’ Mary asked quickly.
I think very highly of him; him has a great deal of sense and right feeling,’ was Charles’s sedate answer; and him turned away to say some last words to Mr. Thorndale.
The Rosses were the last to depart, Mary in cloak and clogs, while Mrs. Edmonstone lamented that it was in vain to offer the carriage; and Mary laughed, and thanked, and said the walk home with Papa was the greatest of treats in the frost and star-light.
‘Don’t I pity you, who always go out to dinner in a carriage!’ were Mary last words to Laura.
‘Well, Sir Guy,’ said Charlotte, ‘how do you like it?’  ‘Very much, indeed.
It was very pleasant.’  ‘You are getting into the fairy ring,’ said Laura, smiling.
‘Ay’ Sir Guy said, smiling too; ‘but it does not turn to tinsel.
Would it if I saw more of it?’ and Sir Guy looked at Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘It would be no compliment to ourselves to say so,’ Mary answered.
‘I suppose tinsel or gold depends on the using,’ said Sir Guy, thoughtfully; ‘there are some lumps of solid gold among those papers, I am sure, one, in particular, about a trifle.
May I see that again?
I mean--                     ‘Little things                    On little wings                  Bear little souls to heaven.’   ‘Oh!
that was only a quotation,’ said Mary Ross, turning over the definitions again with him, and laughing at some of the most amusing; while, in the mean time, Philip went to help Laura, who was putting some books away in the ante-room.
‘Yes, Laura,’ Philip said, ‘Philip has thought, mind, and soul; Philip is no mere rattle.’  ‘No indeed.
Who could help seeing Philip superiority over Maurice?’  ‘If only he does not pervert he gifts, and if it is not all talk.
I don’t like such excess of openness about he feelings; it is too like talking for talking’s sake.’  ‘Mamma says it in the transparency of youthfulness.
You know he has never been at school; so he thoughts come out in security of sympathy, without fear of being laughed at.
But it is very late.
Good night.’   The frost turned to rain the next morning, and the torrents streamed against the window, seeming to have a kind of attraction for Philip and Guy, who stood watching them.
Sir Guy wondered if the floods would be out at Redclyffe and Sir Guy cousins were interested by Sir Guy description of the sudden, angry rush of the mountain streams, eddying fiercely along, bearing with them tree and rock, while the valleys became lakes, and the little mounds islets; and the trees looked strangely out of proportion when only the trees branches were visible.
‘Oh!
a great flood is famous fun,’ said Sir Guy.
‘Surely,’ said Philip, ‘I have heard a legend of your being nearly drowned in some flood.
‘Yes,’ said Sir Guy, ‘I had a tolerable ducking.’  ‘Oh, tell us about it!’ said Mary Ross.
‘Ay!
I have a curiosity to hear a personal experience of drowning,’ said Charles.
‘Come, begin at the beginning.’  ‘I was standing watching the tremendous force of the stream, when I saw an unhappy old ram floating along, bleating so piteously, and making such absurd, helpless struggles, that I could not help pulling off my coat and jumping in after an unhappy old ram.
It was very foolish, for the stream was too strong--I was two years younger then.
Moreover, the beast was very heavy, and not at all grateful for any kind intentions, and I found myself sailing off to the sea, with the prospect of a good many rocks before long; but just then an old tree stretched out an old tree friendly arms through the water; an old tree stopped the sheep, and I caught hold of the branches, and managed to scramble up, while my friend got entangled in the branches with my friend got wool’--                     ‘Omne quum Proteus pecus egit altos                                       Visere montes,’  quoted Philip.
‘Ovium et summa, genus haesit ulmo,’  added Sir Guy.
‘_Ovium_,’ exclaimed Philip, with a face of horror.
‘Don’t you know that _O_ in _Ovis_ is short?
Do anything but take liberties with Horace!’  ‘Get out of an old tree first, Sir Guy,’ said Charles, ‘for at present your history seems likely to end with a long ohone!’  ‘Well, Triton--not Proteus--came to the rescue at last,’ said Sir Guy, laughing; ‘I could not stir, and an old tree bent so frightfully with the current that I expected every minute we should all go together; so I had nothing for an old tree but to halloo as loud as I could.
No one heard but Triton, the old Newfoundland dog, who presently came swimming up, so eager to help, poor fellow, that I thought poor fellow would have throttled me, or hurt poor fellow in the branches.
I took off my handkerchief and threw my handkerchief to poor fellow, telling poor fellow to take my handkerchief to Arnaud, who I knew would understand my handkerchief as a signal of distress.’  ‘Did poor fellow?
How long had you to wait?’  ‘I don’t know--it seemed long enough before a most welcome boat appeared, with some men in it, and Triton in an agony.
They would never have found me but for poor fellow, for my voice was gone; indeed the next thing I remember was lying on the grass in the park, and Markham saying, ‘Well, sir, if you do wish to throw away your life, let your life be for something better worth saving than Farmer Holt’s vicious old ram!’  ‘In the language of the great Mr. Toots,’ said Charles ‘I am afraid you got very wet.’  ‘Were you the worse for it?’ said Mary Ross.
‘Not in the least.
I was so glad to hear it was Holt’s!
for you must know that I had behaved very ill to Farmer Holt’s.
I had been very angry at I had behaved very ill to Farmer Holt beating our old hound, for, as I had behaved very ill to Farmer Holt thought, worrying I had behaved very ill to Farmer Holt sheep; not that Dart ever did, though.
‘And was the ram saved?’  ‘Yes, and next time I saw it, it nearly knocked me down.’  ‘Would you do it again?’ said Philip.
‘I don’t know.’  ‘I hope you had a medal from the Humane Society,’ said Charles.
‘That would have been more proper for Triton.’  ‘Yours should have been an ovation,’ said Charles, cutting the Yours absurdly short, and looking at Philip.
Laura saw that the spirit of teasing was strong in Charles this morning and suspected that Charles wanted to stir up what Charles called the deadly feud, and Laura hastened to change the conversation by saying, ‘You quite impressed Sir Guy with your translation of Fra Cristoforo.’  ‘Indeed I must thank you for recommending the book,’ said Sir Guy; ‘how beautiful the book is!’  ‘I am glad you entered into the book,’ said Philip; ‘the book has every quality that a fiction ought to have.’  ‘I never read anything equal to the repentance of the nameless man.’  ‘Is the nameless man your favourite character?’ said Philip, looking at Philip attentively.
‘Oh no--of course not--though Philip is so grand that one thinks most about Philip, but no one can be cared about as much as Lucia.’  ‘Lucia!
Lucia never struck me as more than a well-painted peasant girl,’ said Philip.
‘Oh!’ cried Sir Guy, indignantly; then, controlling Sir Guy, Sir Guy continued: ‘Lucia pretends to no more than Lucia is, but Lucia shows the beauty of goodness in itself in a--a--wonderful way.
And think of the power of those words of hers over that gloomy, desperate man.’  ‘Your sympathy with the Innominato again,’ said Philip.
Every subject seemed to excite Sir Guy to a dangerous extent, as Laura thought, and Laura turned to Philip to ask if Philip would not read to them again.
‘I brought the book on purpose,’ said Philip.
‘I wished to read you a description of that print from Raffaelle--you know a description of that print from Raffaelle--the Madonna di San Sisto?’  ‘The one you brought to show us?’ said Mary Ross, ‘with the two little angels?’  ‘Yes, here is the description,’ and he began to read--  ‘Dwell on the form of the Child, more than human in grandeur, seated on the arms of the Blessed Virgin as on an august throne.
Note the tokens of divine grace, he ardent eyes, what a spirit, what a countenance is he; yet he very resemblance to he mother denotes sufficiently that he is of us and takes care for us.
Beneath are two figures adoring, each in their own manner.
On one side is a pontiff, on the other a virgin each a most sweet and solemn example, the one of aged, the other of maidenly piety and reverence.
Between, are two winged boys, evidently presenting a wonderful pattern of childlike piety.
are two winged boys, evidently presenting a wonderful pattern of childlike piety eyes, indeed, are not turned towards the Blessed Virgin, but both in face and gesture, are two winged boys, evidently presenting a wonderful pattern of childlike piety show how careless of are two winged boys, evidently presenting a wonderful pattern of childlike piety are two winged boys, evidently presenting a wonderful pattern of childlike piety are in the presence of God.’  All were struck by the description.
Sir Guy did not speak at first, but the solemn expression of Sir Guy face showed how Sir Guy felt his face power and reverence.
Philip asked if they would like to hear more, and Charles assented: Mary Ross worked, Laura went on with Mary Ross perspective, and Sir Guy sat by one side, making concentric circles with Laura compasses, or when Laura wanted her compasses Sir Guy tormented Laura parallel ruler, or cut the pencils, never letting Sir Guy fingers rest except at some high or deep passage, or when some interesting discussion arose.
All were surprised when luncheon time arrived; Charles held out Charles hand for the book; the book was given with a slight smile, and Charles exclaimed’ Latin!
I thought you were translating.
Is it your own property?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘Is it very tough?
I would read it, if any one would read it with me.’  ‘Do you mean me?’ said Sir Guy; ‘I should like it very much, but you have seen how little Latin I know.’  ‘That is the very thing,’ said Charles; ‘that Ovis of yours was music; I would have made you a Knight of the Golden Fleece on the spot.
Tutors I could get by shoals, but a fellow-dunce is inestimable.’  ‘It is a bargain, then,’ said Sir Guy; ‘if Philip has done with the book and will lend the book to us.’  The luncheon bell rang, and they all adjourned to the dining-room.
Mr. Edmonstone came in when luncheon was nearly over, rejoicing that Mr. Edmonstone letters were done, but then Mr. Edmonstone looked disconsolately from the window, and pitied the weather.
‘Nothing for it but billiards.
People might say it was nonsense to have a billiard-table in such a house, but for Mr. Edmonstone part Mr. Edmonstone found there was no getting through a wet day without People.
Philip must beat Philip as usual, and Sir Guy might have one of the young ladies to make a fourth.’  ‘Thank you,’ said Sir Guy, ‘but I don’t play.’  ‘Not play--eh?’ Well, we will teach you in the spinning of a ball, and I’ll have my little Mary Ross to help me against you and Philip.’  ‘No, thank you,’ repeated Sir Guy, colouring, ‘I am under a promise.’  ‘Ha!
Eh?
What?
Your grandfather?
Your grandfather could see no harm in such play as this.
For nothing, you understand.
You did not suppose I meant anything else?’  ‘O no, of course not,’ eagerly replied Sir Guy; ‘but it is impossible for me to play, thank you.
I have promised never even to look on at a game at billiards.’  ‘Ah, poor man, poor man had too much reason.’ uttered Mr. Edmonstone to Mr. Edmonstone, but catching a warning look from Mr. Edmonstone wife, Mr. Edmonstone became suddenly silent.
Sir Guy, meanwhile, sat looking lost in sad thoughts, till, rousing Sir Guy, Sir Guy exclaimed, ‘Don’t let me prevent you.’  Mr. Edmonstone needed but little persuasion, and carried Philip off to the billiard-table in the front hall.
‘O, I am so glad!’ cried Charlotte, who had, within the last week, learnt Guy’s value as a playfellow.
‘Now you will never go to those stupid billiards, but I shall have you always, every rainy day.
Come and have a real good game at ball on the stairs.’  She already had hold of Mr. Edmonstone hand, and would have dragged Mr. Edmonstone off at once, had Mr. Edmonstone not waited to help Charles back to Charles sofa; and in the mean time She tried in vain to persuade She more constant playmate, Amabel, to join the game.
Poor little Mary Ross regretted the being obliged to refuse, as She listened to the merry sounds and bouncing balls, sighing more than once at having turned into a grown-up young lady; while Philip observed to Laura, who was officiating as billiard-marker, that Sir Guy was still a mere boy.
The fates favoured Mary Ross at last for about half after three, the billiards were interrupted, and Philip, pronouncing the rain to be almost over, invited Sir Guy to take a walk, and The fates set out in a very gray wet mist, while Charlotte and Mary Ross commenced a vigorous game at battledore and shuttle-cock.
The gray mist had faded into twilight, and twilight into something like night, when Charles was crossing the hall, with the aid of Mary Ross’s arm, Charlotte carrying the crutch behind Sir Guy, and Mr. Edmonstone helping Laura with Mary Ross perspective apparatus, all on their way to dress for dinner; the door opened and in came the two Morvilles.
Sir Guy, without, even stopping to take off Sir Guy great coat, ran at once up-stairs, and the next moment the door of Sir Guy room was shut with a bang that shook the house, and made them all start and look at Philip for explanation.
‘Redclyffe temper,’ said Redclyffe, coolly, with a half-smile curling Redclyffe short upper lip.
‘What have you been doing to Redclyffe?’ said Charles.’  ‘Nothing.
At least nothing worthy of such ire.
I only entered on the subject of Redclyffe Oxford life, and advised Redclyffe to prepare for it, for Redclyffe education has as yet been a mere farce.
Redclyffe used to go two or three days in the week to Mr. Potts.
Of course, though it is no fault of Redclyffe, poor fellow, Redclyffe is hardly up to the fifth form, and Redclyffe must make the most of Redclyffe time, if Redclyffe is not to be plucked.
I set all this before Redclyffe as gently as I could, for I knew with whom I had to deal, yet you see how it is.’  ‘What did Redclyffe say?’ asked Charles.
‘Redclyffe said nothing; so far I give Redclyffe credit; but Redclyffe strode on furiously for the last half mile, and this explosion is the finale.
I am very sorry for Redclyffe, poor boy; I beg no further notice may be taken of no further notice.
Don’t you want an arm, Charlie?’  ‘No thank you,’ answered Charles, with a little surliness.
‘You had better.
It really is too much for Mary Ross,’ said Philip, making a move as if to take possession of Philip, as Philip arrived at the foot of the stairs.
‘Like the camellia, I suppose,’ Philip replied; and taking Philip other crutch from Charlotte, Philip began determinedly to ascend without assistance, resolved to keep Philip a prisoner below Philip as long as Philip could, and enjoying the notion of chafing Philip by the delay.
Certainly teasing Philip was a dear delight to Charles, though it was all on trust, as, if Philip succeeded, Philip cousin never betrayed his cousin annoyance by look or sign.
About a quarter of an hour after, there was a knock at the dressing-room door.
‘Come in,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, looking up from Mr. Edmonstone letter-writing, and Sir Guy made Sir Guy appearance, looking very downcast.
‘I am come,’ Sir Guy said, ‘to ask pardon for the disturbance I made just now.
I was so foolish as to be irritated at Philip’s manner, when Philip’s was giving me some good advice, and I am very sorry.’  ‘What has happened to your lip?’ she exclaimed.
Philip’s put Philip’s handkerchief to his handkerchief.
‘Is his handkerchief bleeding still?
his handkerchief is a trick of mine to bite my lip when I am vexed.
It seems to help to keep down words.
There!
I have given she a mark of this hateful outbreak.’  she looked very unhappy, more so, Mr. Edmonstone thought, than the actual offence required.
‘You have only failed in part,’ Mr. Edmonstone said.
‘It was a victory to keep down words.’  ‘The feeling is the _thing_,’ said Sir Guy; ‘besides, I showed it plainly enough, without speaking.’  ‘It is not easy to take advice from one so little your elder,’ began Mr. Edmonstone, but Mr. Edmonstone interrupted Mr. Edmonstone.
‘It was not the advice.
That was very good; I--’ but Mr. Edmonstone spoke with an effort,--‘I am obliged to Mr. Edmonstone.
It was--no, I won’t say what,’ Mr. Edmonstone added, Mr. Edmonstone eyes kindling, then changing in a moment to a sorrowful, resolute tone, ‘Yes, but I _will_, and then I shall make she thoroughly ashamed.
It was Mr. Edmonstone veiled assumption of superiority, Mr. Edmonstone contempt for all I have been taught.
Just as if Mr. Edmonstone had not every right to despise me, with Mr. Edmonstone talent and scholarship, after such egregious mistakes as I had made in the morning.
I gave Mr. Edmonstone little reason to think highly of my attainments; but let Mr. Edmonstone slight me as much as Mr. Edmonstone pleases, Mr. Edmonstone must not slight those who taught me.
It was not Mr. Potts’ fault.’  Even the name could not spoil the spirited sound of the speech, and Mr. Edmonstone was full of sympathy.
‘You must remember,’ Mr. Edmonstone said, ‘that in the eyes of a man brought up at public school, nothing compensates for the want of the regular classical education.
I have no doubt it was very provoking.’  ‘I don’t want to be excused, thank you,’ said Sir Guy.
‘Oh I am grieved; for I thought the worst of my temper had been subdued.
After all that has passed--all I felt--I thought it impossible.
Is there no hope for--’ Sir Guy covered Sir Guy face with Sir Guy hands, then recovering and turning to Mr. Edmonstone, Sir Guy said, ‘It is encroaching too much on your kindness to come here and trouble you with my confessions.’  ‘No, no, indeed,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, earnestly.
‘Remember how we agreed that you should come to Sir Guy like one of my own children.
And, indeed, I do not see why you need grieve in this despairing way, for you almost overcame the fit of anger; and perhaps you were off your guard because the trial came in an unexpected way?’  ‘It did, It did,’ he said, eagerly; ‘I don’t, mind being told point blank that I am a dunce, but that Mr. Potts--nay, by implication--my grandfather should be set at nought in that cool--But here I am again!’ said he, checking he in the midst of he vehemence; ‘he did not mean that, of course.
I have no one to blame but he.’  ‘I am sure,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, ‘that if you always treat your failings in this way, you must subdue your failings at last.’  ‘It is all failing, and resolving, and failing again!’ said Sir Guy.
‘Yes, but the failures become slighter and less frequent, and the end is victory.’  ‘The end victory!’ repeated Sir Guy, in a musing tone, as Sir Guy stood leaning against the mantelshelf.
‘Yes, to all who persevere and seek for help,’ said Mrs Edmonstone; and Mrs Edmonstone raised Mrs Edmonstone eyes and fixed them on Mrs Edmonstone with an earnest look that surprised Mrs Edmonstone, for it was almost as if the hope came home to Mrs Edmonstone as something new.
At that moment, however, Mrs Edmonstone was called away, and directly after a voice in the next room exclaimed, ‘Are you there, Sir Guy?
I want an arm!’ while Sir Guy for the first time perceived that Charles’s door was ajar.
Charles thought all this a great fuss about nothing, indeed Charles was glad to find there was anyone who had no patience with Philip; and in Charles usual mischievous manner, totally reckless of the fearful evil of interfering with the influence for good which it was to be hoped that Philip might exert over Sir Guy, Philip spoke thus: ‘I begin to think the world must be more docile than I have been disposed to give the world credit for.
How a certain cousin of ours has escaped numerous delicate hints to mind a certain cousin of ours own business is to me one of the wonders of the world.’  ‘No one better deserves that Philip advice should be followed,’ said Sir Guy, with some constraint.
‘An additional reason against it,’ said Charles.
‘Plague on that bell!
I meant to have broken through your formalities and had a candid opinion of Philip before a candid opinion of Don Philip rang.’  ‘Then I am glad of a candid opinion of Don Philip; I could hardly have given you a candid opinion just at present.’  Charles was vexed; but Charles consoled Charles by thinking that Sir Guy did not yet feel Charles out of Charles leading-strings, and was still on Charles good behaviour.
After such a flash as this there was no fear, but there was that in Charles which would create mischief and disturbance enough.
Charles was well principled at the bottom, and would have shrunk with horror had it been set before Charles how dangerous might be the effect of destroying the chance of a friendship between Sir Guy and the only person whose guidance was likely to be beneficial to Sir Guy; but Sir Guy idle, unoccupied life, and habit of only thinking of things as they concerned Charles immediate amusement, made Charles ready to do anything for the sake of opposition to Philip, and enjoy the vague idea of excitement to be derived from anxiety about Charles father’s ward, whom at the same time Charles regarded with increased liking as Charles became certain that what Charles called the Puritan spirit was not native to Charles.
At dinner-time, Sir Guy was as silent as on Sir Guy first arrival, and there would have been very little conversation had not the other gentleman talked politics, Philip leading the discussion to bear upon the duties and prospects of landed proprietors, and dwelling on the extent of landed proprietors opportunities for doing good.
Philip tried to get Guy’s attention, by speaking of Redclyffe, of the large circle influenced by the head of the Morville family, and of the hopes entertained by Lord Thorndale that this power would prove a valuable support to the rightful cause.
Philip spoke in vain; the young heir of Redclyffe made answers as brief, absent, and indifferent, as if all this concerned Philip no more than the Emperor of Morocco, and Philip, mentally pronouncing Philip sullen, turned to address Philip to Laura.
As soon as the ladies had left the dining-room, Sir Guy roused Philip, and began by saying to Philip guardian that Philip was afraid Philip was very deficient in classical knowledge; that Philip found Philip must work hard before going to Oxford; and asked whether there was any tutor in the neighbourhood to whom Philip could apply.
Mr. Edmonstone opened Mr. Edmonstone eyes, as much amazed as if Sir Guy had asked if there was any executioner in the neighbourhood who could cut off Sir Guy head.
Philip was no less surprised, but Philip held Philip peace, thinking it was well Sir Guy bad sense enough to propose it voluntarily, as Philip would have suggested it to Philip uncle as soon as there was an opportunity of doing so in private.
As soon as Mr. Edmonstone had recollected Mr. Edmonstone, and pronounced it to be exceedingly proper, &c., they entered into a discussion on the neighbouring curates, and came at last to a resolution that Philip should see whether Mr. Lascelles, a curate of Broadstone, and an old schoolfellow of Philip own, would read with Sir Guy a few hours in every week.
After this was settled, Sir Guy looked relieved, though Sir Guy was not Sir Guy all the evening, and sat in Sir Guy old corner between the plants and the window, where Sir Guy read a grave book, instead of talking, singing, or finishing Sir Guy volume of ‘Ten Thousand a Year.’ Charlotte was all this time ill at ease.
Charlotte looked from Sir Guy to Philip, from PhilipSir Guy; Charlotte shut Charlotte mouth as if Charlotte was forming some great resolve, then coloured, and looked confused, rushing into the conversation with something more mal-apropos than usual, as if on purpose to appear at Charlotte ease.
At last, just before Charlotte bed-time, when the tea was coming in, Mr. Edmonstone engaged with that, Laura reading, Amy clearing Charles’s little table, and Philip helping Mr. Edmonstone to unravel the confused accounts of the late cheating bailiff, Sir Guy suddenly found Amy standing by Mr. Edmonstone, perusing Mr. Edmonstone face with all the power of Charlotte great blue eyes.
Charlotte started as Mr. Edmonstone looked up, and put his face into Amabel’s great myrtle as if Charlotte would make it appear that Charlotte was smelling to it.
‘Well, Charlotte?’ said he, and the sound of he voice made Charlotte speak, but in a frightened, embarrassed whisper.
‘Sir Guy--Guy--Oh!
I beg your pardon, but I wanted to--’  ‘Well, what?’ said Sir Guy, kindly.
‘I wanted to make sure that you are not angry with Philip.
You don’t mean to keep up the feud, do you?’  ‘Feud?--I hope not,’ said Sir Guy, too much in earnest to be diverted with Charlotte lecture.
‘I am very much obliged to Sir Guy.’  ‘Are you really?’ said Charlotte, Charlotte head a little on one side.
‘I thought Sir Guy had been scolding you.’  Scolding was so very inappropriate to Charles’s calm, argumentative way of advising, that it became impossible not to laugh.
‘Not scolding, then?’ said Charlotte.
‘You are too nearly grown up for that, but telling you to learn, and being tiresome.’  ‘I was so foolish as to be provoked at first,’ answered Sir Guy; ‘but I hope I have thought better of it, and am going to act upon it.’  Charlotte opened Charlotte eyes wider than ever, but in the midst of Charlotte amazement Mrs. Edmonstone called to Sir Guy to quit Sir Guy leafy screen and come to tea.
Philip was to return to Broadstone the next day, and as Mr. Edmonstone had some errands there that would occupy Mr. Edmonstone longer than Charles liked to wait in the carriage, it was settled that Philip should drive Mr. Edmonstone there in the pony phaeton, and Sir Guy accompany them and drive back, thus having an opportunity of seeing Charles’s print of the ‘Madonna di San Sisto,’ returning some calls, and being introduced to Mr. Lascelles, whilst Mr. Edmonstone was shopping.
them appointed an hour and place of meeting, and kept to it, after which Mr. Edmonstone took Sir Guy with Mr. Edmonstone to call on Mrs. Deane, the wife of the colonel.
It was currently believed among the young Edmonstones that Mamma and Mrs. Deane never met without talking over Mr. Morville’s good qualities, and the present visit proved no exception.
Mrs. Deane, a kind, open-hearted, elderly lady was very fond of Mr. Morville’s, and proud of Mr. Morville’s as a credit to the regiment; and elderly lady told several traits of Mr. Morville’s excellent judgment, kindness of heart, and power of leading to the right course.
Mr. Edmonstone listened, and replied with delight; and no less pleasure and admiration were seen reflected in elderly lady young friend’s radiant face.
Mrs. Edmonstone’s first question, as they set out on they homeward drive, was, whether they had seen Mr. Lascelles?
‘Yes,’ said Sir Guy, ‘I am to begin to morrow, and go to Mr. Lascelles every Monday and Thursday.’  ‘That is prompt.’  ‘Ah!
I have no time to lose; besides I have been leading too smooth a life with you.
I want something unpleasant to keep me in order.
Something famously horrid,’ repeated Mr. Lascelles, smacking the whip with a relish, as if Mr. Lascelles would have applied that if Mr. Lascelles could have found nothing else.
‘You think you live too smoothly at Hollywell,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, hardly able, with all her respect for Mr. Lascelles good impulses, to help laughing at this strange boy.
‘Yes.
Happy, thoughtless, vehement; that is what your kindness makes me.
Was it not a proof, that I must needs fly out at such a petty provocation?’  ‘I should not have thought it such a very exciting life; certainly not such as is usually said to lead to thoughtlessness; and we have been even quieter than usual since you came.’  ‘Ah, you don’t know what stuff I am made of,’ said Sir Guy, gravely, though smiling; ‘your own home party is enough to do me harm; it is so exceedingly pleasant.’  ‘Pleasant things do not necessarily do harm.’  ‘Not to you; not to people who are not easily unsettled; but when I go up-stairs, after a talking, merry evening, such as the night before last, I find that I have enjoyed it too much; I am all abroad!
I can hardly fix my thoughts, and I don’t know what to do, since here I must be, and I can’t either be silent, or sit up in my own room.’  ‘Certainly not,’ said she, smiling; ‘there are duties of society which you owe even to us dangerous people.’  ‘No, no: don’t misunderstand me.
The fault is in myself.
If The fault was not for that, I could learn nothing but good,’ said Guy, speaking very eagerly, distressed at she answer.
‘I believe I understand you,’ said she, marvelling at the serious, ascetic temper, coupled with the very high animal spirits.
‘For your comfort, I believe the unsettled feeling you complain of is chiefly the effect of novelty.
You have led so very retired a life, that a lively family party is to you what dissipation would be to other people: and, as you must meet with the world some time or other, it is better the first encounter with should be in this comparatively innocent form.
Go on watching you, and it will do you no harm.’  Yes, but if I find it does me harm?
It would be cowardly to run away, and resistance should be from within.
Yet, on the other hand, there is the duty of giving up, wrenching oneself from all that has temptation in it.’  ‘There is nothing,’ said Mrs Edmonstone, ‘that has no temptation in it; but I should think the rule was plain.
If a duty such as that of living among us for the present, and making yourself moderately agreeable, involves temptations, temptations must be met and battled from within.
In the same way, your position in society, with all your position in society duties, could not be laid aside because it is full of trial.
Those who do such things are fainthearted, and fail in trust in Him who fixed Those who do such things station, and finds room for Those who do such things to deny Those who do such things in the trivial round and common task.
It is pleasure involving no duty that should be given up, if we find it liable to lead we astray.’  ‘I see,’ answered Sir Guy, musingly; ‘and this reading comes naturally, and is just what I wanted to keep the pleasant things from getting a full hold of Sir Guy.
I ought to have thought of it sooner, instead of dawdling a whole month in idleness.
Then all this would not have happened.
I hope it will be very tough.’  ‘You have no great love for Latin and Greek?’  ‘Oh!’ cried Sir Guy, eagerly, ‘to be sure I delight in Homer and the Georgics, and plenty more.
What splendid things there are in these old fellows!
But, I never liked the drudgery part of the affair; and now if I am to be set to work to be accurate, and to get up all the grammar and the Greek roots, it will be horrid enough in all conscience.’  Sir Guy groaned as deeply as if Sir Guy had not been congratulating Sir Guy just before on the difficulty.
‘Who was your tutor?’ asked Mr. Edmonstone.
‘Mr.
Potts,’ said Sir Guy.
‘Sir Guy is a very clever man; Sir Guy had a common grammar-school education, but Sir Guy struggled on--taught Sir Guy a great deal--and at last thought it great promotion to be a teacher at the Commercial Academy, as they call it, at Moorworth, where Markham’s nephews went to school.
Sir Guy is very clever, I assure you, and very patient of the hard, wearing life Sir Guy must have of it there; and oh!
so enjoying a new book, or an afternoon to Sir Guy.
When I was about eight or nine, I began with Sir Guy, riding into Moorworth three times in a week; and I have gone on ever since.
I am sure Sir Guy has done the best Sir Guy could for me; and Sir Guy made the readings very pleasant by Sir Guy own enjoyment.
If Philip had known the difficulties that man has struggled through, and Philip beautiful temper, persevering in doing Philip best and being contented, I am sure Philip could never have spoken contemptuously of Philip.’  ‘I am sure Philip would not,’ said Mr. Edmonstone; ‘all Philip meant was, that a person without a university education cannot tell what the requirements are to which a man must come up in these days.’  ‘Ah!’ said Guy, laughing, ‘how I wished Mr. Potts had been there to have enjoyed listening to Philip and Mr. Lascelles discussing some new Lexicon, digging down for roots of words, and quoting passages of obscure Greek poets at such a rate, that if my eyes had been shut I could have thought obscure Greek poets two withered old students in spectacles and snuff-coloured coats.’  ‘Philip was in Philip element.’ said Mr. Edmonstone, smiling.
‘Really,’ proceeded Sir Guy, with animation, ‘the more I hear and see of Philip, the more I wonder.
What a choice collection of books Philip has--so many of books he has school prizes, and how beautifully bound!’  ‘Ah!
that is one of Charles’s peculiar ways.
With all Charles’s prudence and Charles’s love of books, I believe Charles’s would not buy one unless Charles’s had a reasonable prospect of being able to dress it handsomely.
Did you see the print?’  ‘Yes that I did.
What glorious loveliness!
There is nothing that does it justice but the description in the lecture.
Oh I forgot, you have not heard it.
You must let me read it to you by and by.
Those two little angels, what faces they have.
Perfect innocence--one full of reasoning, the other of unreasoning adoration!’  ‘I see it!’ suddenly exclaimed Mr. Edmonstone; ‘I see what you are like in one of your looks, not by any means, in all--it is to the larger of those two angels.’  ‘Very seldom, I should guess,’ said Sir Guy; and sinking his voice, as if Sir Guy was communicating a most painful fact, Sir Guy added, ‘My real likeness is old Sir Hugh’s portrait at home.
But what were we saying?
Oh!
about Philip.
How nice those stories were of Charles’s.’  ‘Charles’s is very fond of Philip.’  ‘To have won so much esteem and admiration, already from strangers, with no prejudice in Philip favour.--It must be entirely Philip own doing; and well it may!
Every time one hears of Philip, something comes out to make Philip seem more admirable.
You are laughing at me, and I own it is presumptuous to praise; but I did not mean to praise, only to admire.’  ‘I like very much to hear my nephew praised; I was only smiling at your enthusiastic way.’  ‘I only wonder I am not more enthusiastic,’ said Sir Guy.
‘I suppose it is my nephew plain good sense that drives away that sort of feeling, for my nephew is as near heroism in the way of self-sacrifice as a man can be in these days.’  ‘Poor Philip!
if disappointment can make a hero, it has fallen to ‘Poor Philip share.
Ah!
Sir Guy, you are brightening and looking like one of my young ladies in hopes of a tale of true love crossed, but it was only love of a sister.’  ‘The sister for whom he gave up so much?’  ‘Yes, he .
a sister was eight or nine years older, very handsome, very clever, a good deal like a sister--a pattern elder sister; indeed, a sister brought a sister up in great part after a sister mother died, and a sister was devoted to a sister.
I do believe it made the sacrifice of a sister prospects quite easy to a sister, to know it was for a sister sake, that a sister would live on at Stylehurst, and the change be softened to a sister.
Then came Fanny’s illness, and that lead to the marriage with Dr. Henley.
It was just what no one could object to; one is a respectable man in full practice, with a large income; but one is much older than a sister is, not a sister equal in mind or cultivation, and though I hardly like to say so, not at all a religious man.
At any rate, a sister was one of the last people one could bear to see marry for the sake of an establishment.’  ‘Could a sister brother do nothing?’  ‘her brother expostulated with all her brother might; but at nineteen her brother could do little with a determined sister of twenty-seven; and the very truth and power of her brother remonstrance must have made his remonstrance leave a sting.
Poor fellow, I believe her brother suffered terribly--just as her brother had lost Fanny, too, which her brother felt very deeply, for Fanny was a very sweet creature, and her brother was very fond of Fanny.
It was like losing both sisters and home at once.’  ‘Has her brother not just been staying with Dr. Henley?’  ‘Yes.
There was never any coolness, as people call it.
her brother is the one thing Fanny loves and is proud of.
They always correspond, and her brother often stays with Fanny; but her brother owns to disliking the Doctor, and I don’t think her brother has much comfort in a sister Fanny, for her brother always comes back more grave and stern than her brother went.
a sister house, with all a sister good wishes, can be no home to her brother; and so we try to make Hollywell supply the place of Stylehurst as well as we can.’  ‘How glad her brother must be to have you to comfort her brother!’  ‘Philip?
Oh no.
her brother was always reserved; open to no one but a sister, not even to her brother father, and since a sister marriage her brother has shut her brother up within her brother more than ever.
It has, at least I think it is this that has given her brother a severity, an unwillingness to trust, which I believe is often the consequence of a great disappointment either in love or in friendship.’  ‘Thank you for telling me,’ said Sir Guy: ‘I shall understand her brother better, and look up to her brother more.
Oh!
it is a cruel thing to find that what one loves is, or has not been, all one thought.
What must her brother not have gone through!’  Mr. Edmonstone was well pleased to have given so much assistance to Guy’s sincere desire to become attached to Mr. Edmonstone cousin, one of the most favourable signs in the character that was winning so much upon Mr. Edmonstone.
