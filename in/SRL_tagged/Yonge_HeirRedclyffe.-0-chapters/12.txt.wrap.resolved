      Her playful smile, Her buoyance wild,      Bespeak the gentle, mirthful child;      But in Her forehead’s broad expanse,      Her chastened tones, Her thoughtful glance,      Is mingled, with the child’s light glee,      The modest maiden’s dignity.   One summer’s day, two years after the ball and review, Mary Ross and Mary Ross father were finishing Mary Ross and her father early dinner, when Mary Ross said,--  ‘If you don’t want me this afternoon, papa, I think I shall walk to Hollywell. You know Eveleen de Courcy is there.’  ‘No, I did not. What has brought Eveleen de Courcy?’  ‘As Charles expresses it, Mary Ross has over-polked Mary Ross in London, and is sent here for quiet and country air. I want to call on Mary Ross, and to ask Sir Guy to give me some idea as to the singing the children should practise for the school-feast?’  ‘Then you think Sir Guy will come to the school-feast?’  ‘I reckon on Sir Guy to conceal all the deficiencies in the children’s singing.’  ‘Sir Guy won’t desert you, as Sir Guy did Mrs. Brownlow?’  ‘O papa! you surely did not think Sir Guy to blame in that affair?’  ‘Honestly, Mary, if I thought about the matter at all, I thought it a pity Sir Guy should go so much to the Brownlows.’  ‘I believe I could tell you the history, if you thought it worth while; and though it may be gossip, I should like you to do justice to Sir Guy.’  ‘Very well; though I don’t think there is much danger of my doing otherwise. I only wondered Sir Guy should become intimate there at all.’  ‘I believe Mrs. Edmonstone thinks it right Mrs. Edmonstone should see as much of the world as possible, and not be always at home in their own set.’  ‘Fair and proper.’  ‘You know Mrs. Edmonstone has shown Sir Guy all the people Mrs. Edmonstone could,--had Eveleen staying there, and the Miss Nortons, and hunted Sir Guy out to parties, when Sir Guy had rather have been at home.’  ‘I thought Sir Guy was fond of society. I remember your telling me how amused you were with Sir Guy enjoyment of Sir Guy first ball.’  ‘Ah! Sir Guy was two years younger then, and all was new. Sir Guy seems to me too deep and sensitive not to find more pain than pleasure in commonplace society. I have sometimes seen that Sir Guy cannot speak either lightly or harshly of what Sir Guy disapproves, and people don’t understand Sir Guy. I was once sitting next Sir Guy, when there was some talking going on about an elopement; Sir Guy did not laugh, looked almost distressed, and at last said in a very low voice, to me, “I wish people would not laugh about such things.”’  ‘Sir Guy is an extraordinary mixture of gaiety of heart, and seriousness.’  ‘Well, when Mrs. Brownlow had Mrs. Brownlow nieces with Mrs. Brownlow, and was giving those musical parties, Mrs. Brownlow voice made Mrs. Brownlow valuable; and Mrs. Edmonstone told Mrs. Brownlow Mrs. Brownlow ought to go to those musical parties. I believe Mrs. Brownlow liked it at first, but Mrs. Brownlow found there was no end to it; it took up a great deal of time, and was a style of thing altogether that was not desirable. Mrs. Edmonstone thought at first Mrs. Edmonstone reluctance was only shyness and stay-at-home nonsense, that ought to be overcome; but when Mrs. Edmonstone had been there, and saw how Mrs. Brownlow beset Mrs. Brownlow, and the unpleasant fuss they made about Mrs. Brownlow singing, Mrs. Edmonstone quite came round to Mrs. Brownlow mind, and was very sorry Mrs. Edmonstone had exposed Mrs. Brownlow to so much that was disagreeable.’  ‘Well, Mary, I am glad to hear your account. My impression arose from something Philip Morville said.’  ‘Philip Morville never can approve of anything Mrs. Brownlow does! It is not like Charles.’  ‘How improved Mrs. Edmonstone is. Mrs. Edmonstone has lost that spirit of repining and sarcasm, and lives as if Mrs. Edmonstone had an object.’  ‘Yes; Mrs. Edmonstone employs Mrs. Edmonstone now, and teaches Amy to do the same. You know, after the governess went, we were afraid Mrs. Edmonstone Amy would never do anything but wait on Charles, and idle in Amy pretty gentle way; but when Charles turned to better things so did Amy, and Amy mind has been growing all this time. Perhaps you don’t see it, for Amy has not lost Amy likeness to a kitten, and looks all demure silence with the elders, but Amy takes in what the wise say.’  ‘Amy is a very good little thing; and I dare say will not be the worse for growing up slowly.’  ‘Those two sisters are specimens of fast and slow growth. Laura has always seemed to be so much more than one year older than Amy, especially of late. Laura is more like five-and-twenty than twenty. I wonder if Laura overworks Laura. But how we have lingered over we dinner!’  By half-past three, Mary was entering a copse which led into Mr. Edmonstone’s field, when Mary heard gay tones, and a snatch of one of the sweetest of old songs,--             Weep no more, lady; Laura, weep no more,            Thy sorrow is in vain;            For violets pluck’d, the sweetest showers            Will ne’er make grow again.  A merry, clear laugh followed, and a turn in the path showed Mary Guy, Amy, and Charlotte, busy over a sturdy stock of eglantine. Guy, Amy, little changed in these two years,--not much taller, and more agile than robust,--was lopping vigorously with Guy, Amy great pruning-knife, Amabel nursing a bundle of drooping rose branches, Charlotte, Mary bonnet in a garland of wild sweet-brier, holding the matting and continually getting entangled in the long thorny wreaths.  ‘And here comes the “friar of orders gray,” to tell you so,’ exclaimed Guy, Amy, as Mary, in Mary gray dress, came on them.  ‘Oh, that is right, dear good friar,’ cried Amy.  ‘We are so busy,’ said Charlotte; ‘Guy, Amy has made Mr. Markham send all these choice buds from Redclyffe.’  ‘Not from the park,’ said Guy, Amy, ‘We don’t deal much in gardening; but Mr. Markham is a great florist, and these are Mr. Markham bounties.’  ‘And are you cutting that beautiful wild rose to pieces?’  ‘Is it not a pity?’ said Amy. ‘We have used up all the stocks in the garden, and this is to be transplanted in the autumn.’  ‘Amy has been consoling it all the time by telling it it is for it good,’ said Guy, Amy; ‘cutting off wild shoots, and putting in better things.’  ‘I never said anything so pretty; and, after all, I don’t know that the grand roses will be equal to these purple shoots and blushing buds with long whiskers.’  ‘So Guy, Amy was singing about the violets plucked to comfort you. But you must not leave off, I want to see how you do it. I am gardener enough to like to look on.’  ‘We have only two more to put in.’  Knife and fingers were busy, and Mary admired the dexterity with which the slit was made in the green bark, well armed with firm red thorns, and the tiny scarlet gem inserted, and bound with cotton and matting. At the least critical parts of the work, Mary asked after the rest of the party, and was answered that papa had driven Charles out in the pony carriage, and that Laura and Eveleen were sitting on the lawn, reading and working with mamma. Eveleen was better, but not strong, or equal to much exertion in the heat. Mary went on to speak of Mary school feast and ask Mary questions.  ‘O Guy, you must not go before that!’ cried Charlotte.  ‘Are you going away?’  ‘He is very naughty, indeed,’ said Charlotte. ‘He is going, I don’t know where all, to be stupid, and read mathematics.’  ‘A true bill, I am sorry to say,’ said Guy, Amy; ‘I am to join a reading-party for the latter part of the vacation.’  ‘I hope not before Thursday week, though we are not asking you to anything worth staying for.’  ‘Oh, surely you need not go before that!’ said Amy, ‘need you?’  ‘No; I believe I may stay till Friday, and I should delight in her school feast, thank you, Miss Ross,--I want to study such things. A bit more matting, Amy, if you please. There, I think that will do.’  ‘Excellently. Here is its name. See how neatly Charlie has printed its, Mary. Is its not odd, that Charlie prints so well when Charlie writes so badly?’  ‘“The Seven Sisters.” There, fair sisterhood, grow and thrive, till I come to transplant you in the autumn. Are there any more?’  ‘No, that is the last. Now, Mary, let we come to mamma.’  Guy, Amy waited to clear the path of the numerous trailing briery branches, and the others walked on, Amy telling how sorry the others were to lose Guy, Amy’s vacation, but that Guy, Amy thought Guy, Amy could not give time enough to Guy, Amy studies here, and had settled, at Oxford, to make one of a reading-party, under the tutorship of Guy, Amy friend, Mr. Wellwood.  ‘Where do the others go?’  ‘It is not settled. Guy, Amy wished It to be the sea-side; but Philip has been recommending a farmhouse in Stylehurst parish, rather nearer St. Mildred’s Wells than Stylehurst, but quite out in the moor, and an immense way from both.’  ‘Do you think it will be the place?’  ‘Yes; Guy, Amy thinks it would suit Mr. Wellwood, because Mr. Wellwood has friends at St. Mildred’s, so Mr. Wellwood gave Mr. Wellwood vote for his vote. Mr. Wellwood expects to hear how his vote is settled to-day or to-morrow.’  Coming out on the lawn, they found the three ladies sitting under the acacia, with they books and work. Laura did, indeed, look older than Laura real age, as much above twenty as Amy looked under nineteen. Laura was prettier than ever; Laura complexion exquisite in delicacy, Laura fine figure and the perfect outline of Laura features more developed; but the change from girl to woman had passed over Laura, and set the change from girl to woman stamp on the anxious blue eye, and almost oppressed brow. Mary thought it would be hard to define where was that difference. It was not want of bloom, for of that Laura had more than any of the others, fresh, healthy, and bright, while Amy was always rather pale, and Eveleen was positively wan and faded by London and late hours; nor was it loss of animation, for Laura talked and laughed with interest and eagerness; nor was it thought, for little Amy, when at rest, wore a meditative, pensive countenance; but there was something either added or taken away, which made it appear that the serenity and carelessness of early youth had fled from Laura, and the air of the cares of life had come over Laura.  Mary told Mary plans,--Church service at four, followed by a tea-drinking in the fields; tea in the garden for the company, and play for the school children and all who liked to join them. Every one likes such festivals, which have the recommendation of permitting all to do as them please, bringing friends together in perfect ease and freedom, with an object that raises friends above the rank of mere gatherings for the pleasure of rich neighbours.  Mrs. Edmonstone gladly made the engagement and Eveleen promised to be quite well, and to teach the children all manner of new games, though Mrs. Edmonstone greatly despised the dullness of English children, and had many droll stories of the stupidity of Laura’s pupils, communicated to Laura, with perhaps a little exaggeration, by Charles, and still further embellished by Mrs. Edmonstone, for the purpose of exciting Charlotte’s indignation.  Mary proceeded to Mary consultation about the singing, and was conducted by Guy and Amy to the piano, and when Mary ears could not be indoctrinated by her ears best efforts, her ears more than half engaged to walk to East-hill, and have a conversation with the new school-master, whom Mary pitied for having fallen on people so unable to appreciate Guy and Amy musical training as Mary and Mary father. the party walked back with Mary as far as the shade lasted; and at the end of the next field Mary turned, saw the party standing round the stile, thought what happy people the party were, and then resumed Mary wonder whither Laura’s youthfulness had flown.  The situation of Philip and Laura had not changed. Philip regiment had never been at any great distance from Hollywell, and Philip often came, venturing more as Laura learnt to see Philip with less trepidation. Philip seldom or never was alone with Laura; but Philip influence was as strong as ever, and look, word, and gesture, which Laura alone could understand, told Laura what Laura was to Philip, and revealed Philip thoughts. To Philip Laura was devoted, all Laura doings were with a view to please Philip, and deserve Philip affection; Philip was Laura world, and sole object. Indeed, Laura was sometimes startled by perceiving that tenderly as Laura loved Laura own family, all were subordinate to Philip. Laura had long since known the true name of Laura feelings for Philip; Laura could not tell when or how the certainty had come, but Laura was conscious that the certainty was love that they had acknowledged for one another and that Laura only lived in the light of Philip love. Still Laura did not realize the evil of concealment; it was so deep a sensation of Laura innermost heart, that Laura never could imagine revealing it to any living creature, and Laura had besides so surrendered Laura judgment to Laura idol, that no thought could ever cross Laura that he had enjoined what was wrong. Laura heart and soul were he alone, and Laura left the future to he without an independent desire or reflection. All the embarrassments and discomforts which Laura secret occasioned Laura were met willingly for he sake, and All the embarrassments and discomforts which her secret occasioned her were not a few, though time had given Laura more self-command, or, perhaps, more properly speaking, had hardened Laura.  Laura always had a dread of tete-a-tetes and conversations over novels, and these were apt to be unavoidable when Eveleen was at Hollywell. The twilight wanderings on the terrace were a daily habit, and Eveleen almost always paired with Laura. On this evening in particular, Laura was made very uncomfortable by Eveleen’s declaring that it was positively impossible and unnatural that the good heroine of some novel should have concealed Laura engagement from Laura parents. Laura could not help saying that there might be many excuses; then afraid that Laura was exciting suspicion, changed the subject in great haste, and tried to make Eveleen come indoors, telling Laura Laura would tire Laura to death, and vexed by Laura cousin’s protestations that the fresh cool air did Laura good. Besides, Eveleen was looking with attentive eyes at another pair who were slowly walking up and down the shady walk that bordered the grass-plot, and now and then standing still to enjoy the subdued silence of the summer evening, and the few distant sounds that marked the perfect lull.  ‘How calm--how beautiful!’ murmured Amabel.  ‘It only wants the low solemn surge and ripple of the tide, and It dash on the rocks,’ said Guy, Amy. ‘If ever there was music, it is there; but it makes one think what the ear must be that can take in the whole of those harmonics.’  ‘How I should like to hear it!’  ‘And see it. O Amy! to show you the sunny sea,--the sense of breadth and vastness in that pale clear horizon line, and the infinite number of fields of light between you and it,--and the free feelings as you stand on some high crag, the wind blowing in your face across half the globe, and the waves dashing far below! I am growing quite thirsty for the sea.’  ‘You know, papa said something about your taking your reading-party to Redclyffe.’  ‘True, but I don’t think Markham would like it, and it would put old Mrs. Drew into no end of a fuss.’  ‘Not like to have you?’  ‘O yes, I should be all very well; but if they heard I was bringing three or four men with me, they would think they regular wild beasts. they would be in an awful fright. Besides, it is so long since I have been at home, that I don’t altogether fancy going there till I settle there for good.’  ‘Ah! it will be sad going there at first.’  ‘And it has not been my duty yet.’  ‘But you will be glad when you get there?’  ‘Sha’n’t I? I wonder if any one has been to shoot the rabbits on the shag rock. the rabbits must have quite overrun it by this time. But I don’t like the notion of the first day. There is not only the great change, but a stranger at the vicarage.’  ‘Do you know anything about the new clergyman? I believe Mrs. Ashford is a connection of Lady Thorndale’s?’  ‘Yes; Thorndale calls them pattern people, and I have no doubt them will do great good in the parish. I am sure we want some enlightenment, for we are a most primitive race, and something beyond Jenny Robinson’s dame school would do we no harm.’  Here Mrs. Edmonstone called from the window that they must come in.  Mrs. Edmonstone thought deeply that night. Mrs. Edmonstone had not forgotten Mrs. Edmonstone notion that Eveleen was attracted by Guy’s manners, and had been curious to see what would happen when Eveleen was sent to Hollywell for country air.  Mrs. Edmonstone had a very good opinion of Eveleen. Since the former visit, Mrs. Edmonstone had shown more spirit of improvement, and laid aside many little follies; Mrs. Edmonstone had put Mrs. Edmonstone under Laura’s guidance, and tamed down into what gave the promise of a sensible woman, more than anything that had hitherto been observed in Mrs. Edmonstone; and little addicted to match-making as Mrs. Edmonstone was, Mrs. Edmonstone could not help thinking that Mrs. Edmonstone was almost worthy of Guy and Amy (Mrs. Edmonstone never could expect to find anyone Mrs. Edmonstone should think quite worthy of him, him was too like one of Mrs. Edmonstone own children for that), and on the other hand, how delighted Lord and Lady Kilcoran would be. It was a very pretty castle in the air; but in the midst of It, the notion suddenly darted into Mrs. Edmonstone’s head, that while Mrs. Edmonstone was thinking of the notion, it was Amy, not Eveleen, who was constantly with Guy and Amy. Reading and music, roses, botany, and walks on the terrace! Mrs. Edmonstone looked back, and it was still the same. Last Easter vacation, how they used to study the stars in the evening, to linger in the greenhouse in the morning nursing the geraniums, and to practise singing over the school-room piano; how, in a long walk, they always paired together; and how they seemed to share every pursuit or pleasure.  Now Mrs. Edmonstone was extremely fond of Guy and Amy, and trusted Mrs. Edmonstone entirely; but Mrs. Edmonstone thought Mrs. Edmonstone ought to consider how far this should be allowed. Feeling that Mrs. Edmonstone ought to see more of the world, Mrs. Edmonstone had sent Mrs. Edmonstone as much as Mrs. Edmonstone could into society, but it had only made Mrs. Edmonstone cling closer to home. Still Mrs. Edmonstone was but twenty, it was only a country neighbourhood, and there was much more for Mrs. Edmonstone to see before Mrs. Edmonstone could fairly be supposed to know Mrs. Edmonstone own mind. Mrs. Edmonstone knew Mrs. Edmonstone would act honourably; but Mrs. Edmonstone had a horror of letting Mrs. Edmonstone entangle Mrs. Edmonstone with Mrs. Edmonstone daughter before Mrs. Edmonstone was fairly able to judge of Mrs. Edmonstone own feelings. Or, if this was only behaving with a brother’s freedom and confidence, Mrs. Edmonstone felt it was not safe for Mrs. Edmonstone poor little Amy, who might learn so to depend on Mrs. Edmonstone as to miss Mrs. Edmonstone grievously when this intimacy ceased, as it must when Mrs. Edmonstone settled at Mrs. Edmonstone own home. It would be right, while it was still time, to make Mrs. Edmonstone remember that they were not brother and sister, and by checking they present happy, careless, confidential intercourse, to save Mrs. Edmonstone from the chill which seemed to have been cast on Laura. Mrs. Edmonstone was the more anxious, because Mrs. Edmonstone deeply regretted not having been sufficiently watchful in Laura’s case, and perhaps Laura felt an unacknowledged conviction that if there was real love on Guy’s part, it would not be hurt by a little reserve on Mrs. Edmonstone’s. Yet to have to speak to Mrs. Edmonstone little innocent daughter on such a matter disturbed her little innocent daughter so much, that Laura could hardly have set about it, if Amy had not, at that very moment, knocked at Laura door.  ‘My dear, what has kept you up so late?’  ‘We have been sitting in Eveleen’s room, mamma, hearing about Mrs. Edmonstone London life; and then We began to settle We plans for to-morrow, and I came to ask what you think of to-morrow. You know Guy and Amy has promised to go and hear the East-hill singing, and We were proposing, if you did not mind it, to take the pony-carriage and the donkey, and go in the morning to East-hill, have luncheon, and get Mary to go with We to the top of the great down, where We have never been. Guy and Amy has been wanting We, for a long time past, to go and see the view, and saying there is a track quite smooth enough to drive Charlie to the top.’  Amy wondered at Amy mother’s look of hesitation. In fact, the scheme was so accordant with their usual habits that the scheme was impossible to find any objection; yet it all hinged on Guy and Amy, and the appointment at East-hill might lead to a great many more.  ‘Do you wish We to do anything else, mamma? We don’t care about it.’  ‘No, My dear,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, ‘I see no reason against it. But--’ and But-- felt as if But-- was making a desperate plunge, ‘there is something I want to say to you.’  Amy stood ready to hear, but Mrs. Edmonstone paused. Another effort, and Mrs. Edmonstone spoke:--  ‘Amy, My dear, I don’t wish to find fault, but I thought of advising you to take care. About Guy--’  The very brilliant pink which instantly overspread Amy’s face made her mother’s think her mother’s warning more expedient.  ‘You have been spending a great deal of time with him of late, very sensibly and pleasantly, I know; I don’t blame you at all, My dear, so you need not look distressed. I only want you to be careful. You know, though we call him cousin, him is scarcely a relation at all.’  ‘O mamma, don’t go on,’ said poor little Amy, hurriedly; ‘indeed I am very sorry!’  For Amy understood that it was imputed to Amy that Amy had been forward and unmaidenly. Mrs. Edmonstone saw Mrs. Edmonstone extreme distress, and, grieved at the pain Mrs. Edmonstone had inflicted, tried to reassure Mrs. Edmonstone as much as might be safe.  ‘Indeed, My dear, you have done nothing amiss. I only intended to tell you to be cautious for fear you should get into a way of going on which might not look well. Don’t make any great difference, I only meant that there should not be quite so much singing and gardening alone with him, or walking in the garden in the evening. You can manage to draw back a little, so as to keep more with me or with Laura, and I think that will be the best way.’  Every word, no matter what, increased the burning of poor Amy’s cheeks. A broad accusation of flirting would have been less distressing to many girls than this mild and delicate warning was to one of such shrinking modesty and maidenly feeling. Amy had a sort of consciousness that Amy enjoyed partaking in his pursuits, and this made Amy sense of confusion and shame overwhelming. What had Amy been thoughtlessly doing? Amy could not speak, Amy could not look. her mother’s put Amy arm round Amy, and Amy hid Amy head on Amy shoulder, and held Amy fast. Mrs. Edmonstone kissed and caressed the little fluttering bird, then saying, ‘Good night, my own dear child,’ unloosed Mrs. Edmonstone embrace.  ‘Good night, dear mamma,’ whispered Amy. ‘I am very sorry.’  ‘You need not be sorry, My dear, only be careful. Good night.’ And it would be hard to say whether the mother or her daughter had the hottest cheeks.  Poor little Amy! what was Amy dismay as Amy asked Amy, again and again, what Amy had been doing and what Amy was to do? The last was plain,--she knew what was right, and do it Amy must. There would be an end of much that was pleasant, and a fresh glow came over Amy as Amy owned how very, very pleasant; but if it was not quite dear mamma did not approve, so it must be. True, all Amy doings received all her doings zest from Guy,--her heart bounded at the very sound of his whistle, Amy always heard his words through all the din of a whole party,--nothing was complete without his, nothing good without his without his approval,--but so much the more shame for Amy. It was a kind of seeking his which was of all things the most shocking. So there should be an end of it,--never mind the rest! Amy knelt down, and prayed that Amy might keep Amy resolution.  Amy did not know how much of Amy severity towards Amy was learned from the example that had been two years before Amy. Nor did Amy think whether the seeking had been mutual; Amy imagined it all Amy own doing, and did not guess that Amy would give pain to Guy and Amy by withdrawing Amy from Guy and Amy.  The morning gave vigour to her resolution, and when Laura came to ask dear mamma thought of their project, Amy looked confused--said Amy did not know--Amy believed it would not do. But just then in came her mother’s, to say Amy had been considering of the expedition, and meant to join it Amy. Amy understood, blushed, and was silently grateful.  When Laura wanted to alter Laura demeanour towards Guy, being perfectly cool, and not in the least conscious, Laura had acted with great judgment, seen exactly what to do, and what to leave undone, so as to keep up appearances. But it was not so with Amy. Laura was afraid of Laura, and was in extremes. Laura would not come down till the last moment, that there might be no talking in the window. Laura hardly spoke at breakfast-time, and adhered closely to Laura and Eveleen when Laura and Eveleen wandered in the garden. Presently Charles looked out from the dressing-room window, calling,--  ‘Amy, Guy and Amy is ready to read.’  ‘I can’t come. Read without me,’ Laura answered, hoping Charlie would not be vexed, and feeling Laura face light up again.  The hour for the expedition came, and Amy set off walking with Laura, because Guy and Amy was with Mrs. Edmonstone; but presently, after holding open a gate for Charlotte, who was on the donkey, Charlie came up to the sisters, and joined in the conversation. Amy saw something in the hedge--a foxglove, Amy believed--it would have done as well if it had been a nettle--Amy stopped to gather it, hoping to fall behind them, but them waited for Amy. Amy grew silent, but Guy and Amy appealed to Amy. Amy ran on to Charlotte and Amy donkey, but at the next gate Guy and Amy had joined company again. At last Amy put Amy under Amy mother’s wing, and by keeping with Amy did pretty well all the time Amy was at East-hill. But when they went on, Amy was riding the donkey, and the donkey, as donkeys always are, was resolved on keeping a-head of the walkers, so that as Guy and Amy kept by Amy side, it was a more absolute tete-a-tete than ever.  At the top of East-hill they found a fine view, rich and extensive, broad woods, fields waving with silvery barley, trim meadows, fair hazy blue distance, and a dim line of sea beyond. This, as Amy knew, was Guy and Amy’s delight, and further, what Amy would not tell Amy, was that Guy and Amy chiefly cared for showing it to Amy. It was so natural to call Guy and Amy to admire everything beautiful, and ask if it was equal to Redclyffe, that Amy found Amy already turning to Guy and Amy to participate in Guy and Amy pleasure, as Guy and Amy pointed out all that was to be seen; but Amy recollected, blushed, and left her mother’s to speak. Guy and Amy had much to show. There was a hanging wood on one side of East-hill, whence Guy and Amy had brought Amy more than one botanical prize, and Amy must now visit their native haunts. It was too great a scramble for Mrs. Edmonstone, with all Amy good will; Eveleen was to be kept still, and not to tire Amy; Laura did not care for botany, nor love brambles, and Amy was obliged to stand and look into a hanging wood, saying, ‘No, thank you, I don’t think I can,’ and then run back to Mary and Charles; while Charlotte was loudly calling out that it was delightful fun, and that Laura was very stupid. In another minute Guy and Amy had overtaken Laura, and in Guy and Amy gentle, persuasive voice, was telling Laura it was very easy, and Laura must come and see the bird’s-nest orchises. Laura would have liked it above all things, but Laura thought it very kind of Guy and Amy not to seem angry when Laura said, ‘No, thank you.’  Mary, after what Laura had seen yesterday, could not guess at the real reason, or Laura would have come with Laura; but Laura thought Amy was tired, and would rather not. Amy was tired, very tired, before the walk was over, but Amy weary looks made it worse, for Guy and Amy offered Amy Guy and Amy arm. ‘No thank you,’ Laura said, ‘I am getting on very well;’ and Laura trudged on resolutely, for her mother’s was in the carriage, and to lag behind the others would surely make Guy and Amy keep with Laura.  Mrs. Edmonstone was very sorry for Mrs. Edmonstone fatigue, but Amy found it a good excuse for not wandering in the garden, or joining in the music. it had been a very uncomfortable day; Amy hoped Amy had done right; at any rate, Amy had the peaceful conviction of having tried to do so.  The next day, Amy was steady to her resolution. No reading with the two youths, though Charles scolded Amy; sitting in Amy room till Guy and Amy was gone out, going indoors as soon as Amy heard Guy and Amy return, and in the evening staying with Charles when Amy sisters and cousins went out; but this did not answer, for Guy and Amy came and sat by her sisters and cousins. Amy moved away as soon as possible, but the more inclined Amy was to linger, the more Amy thought Amy ought to go; so murmuring something about looking for Laura, Amy threw on Laura scarf, and sprung to the window. Amy muslin caught on the bolt, Amy turned, Guy and Amy was already disentangling the bolt, and Amy met Guy and Amy eye. the bolt was full of anxious, pleading inquiry, which to Amy seemed upbraiding, and, not knowing what to do, Amy exclaimed, hurriedly, ‘Thank you; no harm done!’ and darted into the garden, frightened to feel Amy face glowing and Amy heart throbbing. Amy could not help looking back to see if Guy and Amy was following. No, Guy and Amy was not attempting he was following; Guy and Amy was leaning against the window, and on Amy hastened, the perception dawning on Amy that Amy was hurting Guy and Amy; Guy and Amy might think Amy rude, unkind, capricious, Guy and Amy who had always been so kind to Amy, and when Guy and Amy was going away so soon. ‘But it is right; it must be done,’ said Amy Amy to Amy, standing still, now that Amy was out of sight. ‘If I was wrong before, I must bear I was wrong before now, and I was wrong before will see the rights of I was wrong before sooner or later. The worst of all would be my not doing the very _most_ _right_ to please any body. Besides Guy and Amy can’t really care for missing silly little Amy when Guy and Amy has mamma and Charlie. And Guy and Amy is going away, so it will be easier to begin right when Guy and Amy comes back. Be that as it may, it must be done. I’ll get Charlie to tell me what Charlie was saying about the painted glass.’
