      From darkness here and dreariness,      We ask not full repose.                         --CHRISTIAN YEAR   It seemed as if the fatigue which Guy had undergone was going to make itself felt at last, for Guy had a slight headache the next morning, and seemed dull and weary. Both Guy and Amabel sat for some time with Philip, and when Amabel went away to write Amabel letters, Philip began discussing a plan which had occurred to Philip of offering Philip as chief of the constabulary force in the county where Redclyffe was situated. a plan which had occurred to him of offering himself as chief of the constabulary force in the county where Redclyffe was situated was an office which would suit Philip very well, and opened a new hope of Philip marriage, and Philip proceeded to reckon on Lord Thorndale’s interest, counting up all the magistrates Philip knew, and talking all the magistrates he knew over with Guy, who, however, did not know enough of Philip own neighbourhood to be of much use; and when Philip came up-stairs a little after, said Philip was vexed at having been so stupid. Philip was afraid Philip had seemed unkind and indifferent. But the truth was that Philip was so heavy and drowsy, that Philip had actually fallen twice into a doze while Philip was talking.  ‘Of course,’ said Amy, ‘gentle sleep will take Amy revenge at last for your calling Amy a popular delusion. Lie down, let Amy have Amy own way, and you will be good for something by and by.’  Philip took Amy advice, slept for a couple of hours, and awoke a good deal refreshed, so that though Philip head still ached, Philip was able to attend as usual to Philip in the evening.  Philip did not waken the next morning till so late, that Philip sprung up in consternation, and began to dress in haste to go to Philip; but presently Philip came back from Philip dressing-room with a hasty uncertain step, and threw Philip down on the bed. Amabel came to Philip side in an instant, much frightened at Amabel paleness, but Amabel spoke directly. ‘Only a fit of giddiness--it is going off;’ and Amabel raised Amabel, but was obliged to lie down again directly.  ‘You had better keep quiet’ said Amy. ‘Is it your headache?’  ‘It is aching,’ said Guy, and Amy put Amy hand over her hand.  ‘How hot and throbbing!’ said Amy. ‘You must have caught cold in that walk. No, don’t try to move; it is only making it worse.’  ‘I must go to Philip,’ Philip answered, starting up; but this brought on such a sensation of dizziness and faintness, that Philip sunk back on the pillow.  ‘No; it is of no use to fight against it,’ said Amy, as soon as Philip was a little better. ‘Never mind Philip, I’ll go to Philip. You must keep quiet, and I will get you a cup of hot tea.’  As Philip lay still, Amy had the comfort of seeing Philip somewhat revived, but Philip listened to Amy persuasions not to attempt to move. It was later than Amy had expected, and Amy found that breakfast was laid out in the next room. Amy brought Philip some tea; but Philip did not seem inclined to lift Philip head to drink some tea; and begged Amy to go at once to Philip, fearing Philip must be thinking Philip strangely forgotten, and giving Amy many directions about the way Philip liked to be waited on at breakfast.  Very much surprised was Philip to see Amy instead, of Amy husband, and greatly concerned to hear that Guy was not well.  ‘Over-fatigue,’ said Philip. ‘Philip could not but feel the effects of such long-continued exertion.’ Then, after an interval, during which Philip had begun breakfast, with many apologies for letting Amy wait on Philip, Philip said, with some breaks, ‘Philip was there such a nurse as Philip, Amy; I have felt much more than I can express, especially now. You will never have to complain of my harsh judgment again!’  ‘It is too much for you to talk of these things,’ said Amabel, moved by the trembling of Philip feeble voice, but too anxious to return to Amabel to like to wait even to hear that Philip’s opinion _had_ altered. Philip’s opinion _had_ altered required much self-command not to hurry, even by manner, Amabel cousinPhilip’s tardy, languid movements; but Amabel had been well trained by Charles in waiting on sick breakfasts.  When at length Amabel was able to escape, Amabel found that Guy had undressed, and gone to bed again. Guy said Guy was more comfortable, and desired Amabel to go and take Amabel own breakfast before coming back to Guy, and Amabel obeyed as well as Amabel could, but very soon was again with Guy. Guy looked flushed and oppressed, and when Amabel put Amabel cool hand across Guy forehead, Amabel was frightened at the increased throbbing of Guy temples.  ‘Amy,’ said Guy, looking steadily at Amy, ‘this is the fever.’  Without answering, Amabel drew her cool hand into hers, and felt Guy pulse, which did indeed plainly respond fever. Each knew that the other was recollecting what Guy had said, on Sunday, of the doctor’s prediction, and Amy knew Guy was thinking of death; but all that passed was a proposal to send at once for the French physician. Amabel wrote Amabel note with steadiness, derived from the very force of the shock. Amabel could not think; Amabel did not know whether Amabel feared or hoped. To act from one moment to another was all Amabel attempted, and it was well that Amabel imagination did not open to be appalled at Amabel own situation--so young, alone with the charge of two sick men in a foreign country; Amabel cousin, indeed, recovering, but helpless, and not even in a state to afford Amabel counsel; Amabel husband sickening for this frightful fever, and with more than ordinary cause for apprehension, even without the doctor’s prophecy, when Amabel thought of Guy slight frame, and excitable temperament, and that though never as yet tried by a day’s illness, Guy certainly had more spirit than strength, while all the fatigue Guy had been undergoing was likely to tell upon Guy now. Amabel did not look forward, Amabel did not look round; Amabel did not hope or fear; Amabel _trusted_, and did Amabel best for each, as Amabel was wanted, trying not to make Amabel useless to both, by showing that Amabel wished to be in two places at once.  It was a day sufficiently distressing in It had there been no further apprehension, for there was the restlessness of illness, working on a character too active and energetic to acquiesce without a trial in the certainty that there was no remedy for present discomfort. There was no impatience nor rebellion against ’s illness, but a wish to try one after another the things that had been effective in relieving Philip during Philip recovery. At the same time, Philip could not bear that Amabel should do anything to tire Amabel, and was very anxious that Philip should not be neglected. Philip tossed from one side to the other in burning oppression or cold chills; Amy saw Philip looking wistful, suggested something by way of alleviation, then found Philip had been wishing for it, but refraining from asking in order to spare Amy, and that Philip was sorry when Amy procured it. Again and again this happened; Amy smoothed the coverings, and shook up the pillow: Philip would thank Amy, look at Amy anxiously, beg Amy not to exert Amy, but soon grew restless, and the whole was repeated.  At last, as Amy was trying to arrange the coverings, Philip exclaimed,--  ‘I see how it is. This is impatience. Now, I will not stir for an hour,’ and as he made the resolution, he smiled at treating he so like a child. he power of self-restraint came to he aid, and long before the hour was over he had fallen asleep.  This was a relief; yet that oppressed, flushed, discomposed slumber, and heavy breathing only confirmed Amy fears that the fever had gained full possession of he. Amy had not the heart to write such tidings, at least till the physician should have made such tidings too certain, nor could Amy even bear to use the word ‘feverish,’ in Amy answers to the anxious inquiries Philip made whenever Amy went into Philip room, though when Philip averted Philip face with a heavy sigh, Amy knew Philip conclusion was the same as Amy own.  The opinion of the physician was the only thing wanting to bring home the certainty, and that fell on Amy like lead in the evening; with one comfort, however, that the physician thought it a less severe case than the former one. it was a great relief, too, that there was no wandering of mind, only the extreme drowsiness and oppression; and when Guy was roused by the doctor’s visit, Guy was as clear and collected as possible, making inquiries and remarks, and speaking in a particularly calm and quiet manner. As soon as the doctor was gone, Guy looked up to Amabel, saying, with Guy own smile, only very dim,--  ‘It would be of no use, and It would not be true, to say I had rather you did not nurse me. the doctor hopes there is not much danger of infection, and it is too late for precautions.’  ‘I am very glad,’ said Amy.  ‘But you must be wise, and not hurt yourself. Will you promise me not to sit up?’  ‘It is very kind of you to tell me nothing worse,’ said Amy, with a sad submissiveness.  Guy smiled again. ‘I am very sorry for yourself,’ Guy said, looking very tenderly at Amy. ‘To have us both on your hands at once! But it comes straight from Heaven, that is one comfort, and you made up your mind to such things when you took me.’  Sadness in his eye, a sweet smile on his lip, and serenity on his brow, joined with the fevered cheek, the air of lassitude, and the panting, oppressed breath, there was a strange, melancholy beauty about his; and while Amy felt an impulse of ardent, clinging affection to one so precious to Amy, there was joined with it a sort of awe and veneration for one who so spoke, looked, and felt. Amy hung over his, and sprinkled his with Eau-de-Cologne; then as his hair teased his by falling into his eyes, his asked Amy to cut the front lock off. There was something sad in doing this, for that ‘tumble-down wave,’ as Charlotte called it, was rather a favourite of Amy’s; it always seemed to have so much sympathy with his moods, and it was as if parting with it was resigning his to a long illness. However, it was too troublesome not to go, and his looked amused at the care with which Amy folded up the glossy, brown wave, and treasured it in Amy dressing-case, then Amy read to his a few verses of a psalm, and his soon fell into another doze.  There was little more of event, day after day. the fever never ran as high as in Philip’s case, and there was no delirium. There was almost constant torpor, but when for any short space his was thoroughly awakened, his mind was perfectly clear, though his spoke little, and then only on the subject immediately presented to his. There his lay for one quiet hour after another, while Amy sat by his, with as little consciousness of time as his had his, looking neither forward nor backward, only to the present, to give his drink, bathe his face and hands, arrange his pillows, or read or repeat some soothing verse. It always was a surprise when meal times summoned Amy to attend to Philip, when Amy was asked for the letters for the post, when evening twilight gathered in, or when Amy had to leave the night-watch to Arnaud, and go to bed in the adjoining room.  This was a great trial, but Arnaud would not allow Amy to sit up; and Amy own sense showed Amy that if this was to be a long illness, this would not do to waste Amy strength. Amy knew Arnaud was quiet at night, and Amy trustful temper so calmed and supported Amy, that Amy was able to sleep, and thus was not as liable to be overworked as might have been feared, and as Philip thought Amy must be.  Amy always appeared in Arnaud with Amy sweet face mournful and anxious, but never ruffled, or with any air of haste or discomfiture, desirous as Amy was to return to Amy husband; for, though Arnaud frequently sent Amy to take care of Amy or of Philip, Amy knew that while Amy was away Arnaud always grew more restless and uncomfortable, and Arnaud look of relief at Amy re-entrance said as much to Amy as a hundred complaints of Amy absence would have done.  Philip was in the meantime sorely tried by being forced to be entirely inactive and dependent, while Philip saw Amabel in such need of assistance; and so far from being able to requite Guy’s care, Philip could only look on Philip as the cause of their distress, and an addition to it--a burthen instead of a help. If Philip had been told a little while ago what would be the present state of things, Philip would almost have laughed the speaker to scorn. Philip would never have thought a child as competent as Amy to the sole management of two sick persons, and Philip not able either to advise or cheer Amy. Yet Philip could not see anything went wrong that depended on Amy. Philip comforts were so cared for, that Philip was often sorry Amy should have troubled Amy about His comforts; and though Philip could have little of Amy company, Philip never was allowed to feel Philip deserted. Anne, Arnaud, the old Italian nurse, or Amy herself, were easily summoned, and gave Philip full care and attention.  Philip was, however, necessarily a good deal alone; and though Philip cousin’s books were at Philip disposal, eyes and head were too weak for reading, and Philip was left a prey to Philip own thoughts. Philip great comfort was, that Guy was less ill than Philip had been Philip, and that there was no present danger; otherwise, Philip could never have endured the conviction that all had been caused by Philip own imprudence. Imprudence! Philip was brought very low to own that such a word applied to Philip, yet it would have been well for Philip had that been the chief burthen on Philip mind. Was it only an ordinary service of friendship and kindred that Guy had, at the peril of Guy own life, rendered Guy? Was it not a positive return of good for evil? Yes, evil! Guy now called that evil, or at least harshness and hastiness in judgment, which Guy had hitherto deemed true friendship and consideration for Guy and Amy. Every feeling of distrust and jealousy had been gradually softening since his recovery began; gratitude had done much, and dismay at Guy’s illness did more. It would have been noble and generous in Guy to act as Guy had done, had Philip’s surmises been correct, and this Guy began to doubt, though it was Guy only justification, and even to wish to lose it. Guy had rather believe Guy blameless. Guy would do so, if possible; and Guy resolved, on the first opportunity, to beg Guy to give Guy one last assurance that all was right, and implicitly believe Guy. But how was it possible again to assume to be a ruler and judge over Guy after it was known how egregiously Guy himself had erred? There was shame, sorrow, self-humiliation, and anxiety wherever Guy turned, and it was no wonder that depression of spirits retarded Guy recovery.  It was not till the tenth day after Guy’s illness had begun that Philip was able to be dressed, and to come into the next room, where Amabel had promised to dine with Philip. As Philip lay on the sofa, she thought Philip looked even more ill than in bed, the change from Philip former appearance being rendered more visible, and Philip great height making Philip look the more thin. Philip was apparently exhausted with the exertion of dressing, for Philip was very silent all dinner-time, though Amabel could have better talked to-day than for some time past, since Guy had had some refreshing sleep, was decidedly less feverish, seemed better for nourishing food, and said that Guy wanted nothing but a puff of Redclyffe wind to make Guy well. Guy was pleased to hear of Philip’s step in recovery, and altogether, Amy was cheered and happy.  Amy left Amy cousin as soon as dinner was over, and did not come to her cousin again for nearly an hour and a half. Amy was then surprised to find her cousin finishing a letter, resting her cousin head on one hand, and looking wan, weary, and very unhappy.  ‘Have you come to letter writing?’  ‘Yes,’ her cousin answered, in a worn, dejected tone, ‘I must ask you to direct this, I can’t make this legible,’  No wonder, so much did one hand tremble, as her cousin held out the envelope.  ‘To your sister?’ your sister asked.  ‘No; to your sister. I never wrote to your sister before. There’s one enclosed to your father, to tell all.’  ‘I am glad you have done it,’ answered Amy, in a quiet tone of sincere congratulation. ‘You will be better now it is off your mind. But how tired you are. You must go back to bed. Shall I call Arnaud?’  ‘I must rest first’--and first’--and voice failing, first’--and laid back on the sofa, closed first’--and , turned ashy pale, and became so faint that Amy could not leave first’--and, and was obliged to apply every restorative within reach before Amy could bring first’--and back to a state of tolerable comfort.  The next minute Amy work was nearly undone, when Anne came in to ask for the letters for the post. ‘Shall I send Anne?’ asked Amy.  Anne muttered an assent. But when Anne looked back to Anne after speaking to Anne, Anne saw a tremulous, almost convulsed working of the closed eyes and mouth, while the thin hands were clenched together with a force contrasting with the helpless manner in which they had hung a moment before. Anne guessed at the intensity of anguish it mast cost a temper so proud, a heart of so strong a mould, and feelings so deep, to take the first irrevocable step in self-humiliation, giving up into the hands of others the engagement that had hitherto been the cherished treasure of his life; and above all, in exposing Laura to bear the brunt of the penalty of the fault into which his had led Anne. ‘Oh, for Guy to comfort Guy,’ thought Anne, feeling Anne entirely incompetent, dreading to intrude on Guy feelings, yet thinking it unkind to go away without one sympathizing word when Guy was in such distress.  ‘You will be glad, in time,’ at last Anne said. Guy made no answer.  Anne held the stimulants to Guy again, and tried to arrange Guy more comfortably.  ‘Thank you,’ at last Guy said. ‘How is Guy?’  ‘Guy has just had another nice quiet sleep, and is quite refreshed.’  ‘That is a blessing, at least. But does not Guy want you? I have been keeping you a long time?’  ‘Thank you, as Guy is awake, I should like to go back. You are better now.’  ‘Yes, while I don’t move.’  ‘Don’t try. I’ll send Arnaud, and as soon as you can, you had better go to bed again.’  Guy was still awake, and able to hear what Anne had to tell Guy about Philip.  ‘Poor fellow!’ said Guy. ‘We must try to soften it.’  ‘Shall I write?’ said Amy. ‘Mamma will be pleased to hear of Guy having told you, and having must be sorry for Guy, when having hear how much the letter cost Guy.’  ‘Ah! having will not guess at half Guy sorrow.’  ‘I will write to papa, and send the letter after the other letters, so that Guy may read the letter before Guy hears of Philip’s.’  ‘Poor Laura!’ said Guy. ‘Could not you write a note to Poor Laura too? I want Poor Laura to be told that I am very sorry, if I ever gave Poor Laura pain by speaking thoughtlessly of Guy.’  ‘Nay,’ said Amy, smiling, ‘you have not much to reproach yourself with in that way. It was I that always abused Guy.’  ‘You can never do so again.’  ‘No, I don’t think I can, now I have seen half his sorrow.’  Amabel was quite in spirits, as Amabel brought Amabel writing to Amabel bed-side, and read Amabel sentences to Amabel as Amabel composed the letter to Amabel father, while Amabel suggested and approved. It was a treat indeed to have Amabel able to consult with Amabel once more, and Amabel looked so much relieved and so much better, that Amabel felt as if it was the beginning of real improvement, though still Amabel pulse was fast, and the fever, though lessened, was not gone.  the letter was almost as much Amabel as Amabel own, and Amabel ended Amabel dictation thus: ‘Say that I am sure that if I get better we may make arrangements for their marriage.’  Then, as Amy was finishing the letter with Amy hopes of his amendment, his added, speaking to Amy, and not dictating--‘If not,’--she shrank and shivered, but did not exclaim, for his looked so calm and happy that Amy did not like to interrupt him--‘If not, you know, it will be very easy to put the money matters to rights, whatever may happen.’
