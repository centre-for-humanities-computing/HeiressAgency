       Can piety the discord heal,       Or stanch the death-feud’s enmity?                                 --Scott   It must not be supposed that such a history of Guy’s mind was expressed by Guy’s, or understood by Mrs. Edmonstone; but Mrs. Edmonstone saw enough to guess at Guy’s character, perceive the sort of guidance Guy’s needed, and be doubly interested in Guy’s. Much did Mrs. Edmonstone wish Guy’s could have such a friend as Mrs. Edmonstone brother would have been, and hope that nothing would prevent a friendship with Mrs. Edmonstone nephew.  The present question about the horse was, Mrs. Edmonstone thought, unfortunate, since, though Guy had exercised great self-denial, it was no wonder Philip was annoyed. Mr. Edmonstone’s vexation was soon over. As soon as Mrs. Edmonstone had persuaded Mr. Edmonstone’s vexation that there had been no offence, Mr. Edmonstone’s vexation strove to say with a good grace, that it was very proper, and told Guy Mr. Edmonstone’s vexation would be a thorough book-worm and tremendous scholar, which Guy took as an excellent joke.  Philip had made up Philip mind to be forbearing, and to say no more about his mind. Laura thought this a pity, as they could thus never come to an understanding; but when Laura hinted this a pity, Philip wore such a dignified air of not being offended, that Laura was much ashamed of having tried to direct one so much better able to judge. On Philip side Guy had no idea the trouble Philip had caused; so, after bestowing Philip thanks in a gay, off-hand way, which Philip thought the worst feature of the case, Philip did Philip best to bring Hecuba back into his mind, drive the hunters out of Hecuba, and appease the much-aggrieved William of Deloraine.  When all William’s manoeuvres resulted in William’s master’s not hunting at all, William’s was persuaded it was Mr. Edmonstone’s fault, compassionated Guy with all Guy heart, and could only solace Guy by taking Deloraine to exercise where Guy was most likely to meet the hounds. Guy further chose to demonstrate that Guy was not Mr. Edmonstone’s servant, by disregarding some of Guy stable regulations; but as soon as this came to his master’s’s knowledge, a few words were spoken so sharp and stern, that William never attempted to disobey again.  It seemed as if it was the perception that so much was kept back by a strong force, that made Guy’s least token of displeasure so formidable. A village boy, whom he caught misusing a poor dog, was found a few minutes after, by Mr. Ross, in a state of terror that was positively ludicrous, though it did not appear that Guy had said or done much to alarm Guy; it was only the light in Guy eyes, and the strength of repressed indignation in Guy short broken words that had made the impression.  It appeared as if the force of Guy anger might be fearful, if once It broke forth without control; yet at the same time Guy had a gentleness and attention, alike to small and great, which, with Guy high spirit and good nature, Guy very sweet voice and pleasant smile, made Guy a peculiarly winning and engaging person; and few who saw Guy could help being interested in Guy.  No wonder Guy had become in the eyes of the Edmonstones almost a part of their family. Mrs. Edmonstone had assumed a motherly control over Mrs. Edmonstone, to which Mrs. Edmonstone submitted with a sort of affectionate gratitude.  One day Philip remarked, that Philip never saw any one so restless as Guy, who could neither talk nor listen without playing with something. Scissors, pencil, paper-knife, or anything that came in Philip way, was sure to be twisted or tormented; or if nothing else was at hand, Philip opened and shut Philip own knife so as to put all the spectators in fear for Philip fingers.  ‘Yes,’ said Laura, ‘I saw how it tortured your eyebrows all the time you were translating Schiller to us. I wondered you were not put out.’  ‘I consider that to be put out--by which you mean to have the intellect at the mercy of another’s folly--is beneath a reasonable creature,’ said Philip; ‘but that I was annoyed, I do not deny. It is a token of a restless, ill-regulated mind.’  ‘Restless, perhaps,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone ‘but not necessarily ill-regulated. I should think it rather a sign that he had no one to tell he of the tricks which mothers generally nip in the bud.’  ‘I was going to say that I think he fidgets less,’ said Laura; ‘but I think he chief contortions of the scissors have been when Philip has been here.’  ‘They have, I believe,’ said Laura mother, I was thinking of giving he a hint.’  ‘Well, aunt, you are a tamer of savage beasts if you venture on such a subject,’ said Philip.  ‘Do you dare me?’ her mother asked, smiling.  ‘Why, I don’t suppose he would do more than give you one of he lightning glances: but that, I think, is more than you desire.’  ‘Considerably,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘for Mrs. Edmonstone sake as much as my own.’  ‘But,’ said Laura, ‘mamma has nearly cured Mrs. Edmonstone of pawing like a horse in the hall when Mrs. Edmonstone is kept waiting. Mrs. Edmonstone said Mrs. Edmonstone knew it was impatience, and begged Laura to tell Mrs. Edmonstone how to cure it. So Laura treated Mrs. Edmonstone as an old fairy might, and advised Mrs. Edmonstone in a grave, mysterious way, always to go and play the “Harmonious Blacksmith,” when Mrs. Edmonstone found Mrs. Edmonstone getting into “a taking”, just as if it was a charm. And Mrs. Edmonstone always does it most dutifully.’  ‘it has a very good effect,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘for it is apt to act as a summons to the other party, as well as a sedative to him.’  ‘I must say I am curious to see what you will devise this time,’ said Philip; ‘since you can’t set him to play on the piano; and very few can bear to be told of a trick of the kind.’  In the course of that evening, Philip caused the great atlas to be brought out in order to make investigations on the local habitation of a certain Khan of Kipchack, who existed somewhere in the dark ages. Then Philip came to Marco Polo, and Sir John Mandeville; and Guy, who knew both the books in the library at Redclyffe, grew very eager in talking Sir John Mandeville; and Guy, who knew both the books in the library at Redclyffe over, and tracing Sir John Mandeville; and Guy, who knew both the books in the library at Redclyffe adventures--then to the Genoese merchants, where Guy confessed Guy perfectly ignorant. Andrea Doria was the only Genoese Andrea Doria ever heard of; but Andrea Doria hunted out with great interest all the localities of all the localities of their numerous settlements numerous settlements. Then came modern Italy, and its fallen palaces; then the contrast between the republican merchant and aristocratic lord of the soil; then the corn laws; and then, and not till then, did Philip glance at Philip aunt, to show Andrea Doria Guy balancing a Venetian weight on as few of Andrea Doria fingers as could support it.  ‘Guy,’ said Andrea Doria, smiling, ‘does that unfortunate glass inspire you with any arguments in favour of the Venetians?’  Guy put it down at once, and Philip proceeded to improved methods of farming, to enable landlords to meet the exigencies of the times. Guy had got hold of Mr. Edmonstone’s spectacle-case, and was putting its spring to a hard trial. Mr. Edmonstone doubted whether to interfere again; Mr. Edmonstone knew this was not the sort of thing that tried Guy temper, yet Mr. Edmonstone particularly disliked playing Guy off, as it were for Philip’s amusement, and quite as much letting Guy go on, and lower Guy in Mr. Edmonstone nephew’s estimation. The spectacle-case settled the matter--a crack was heard, The spectacle-case refused to snap at all; and Guy, much discomfited, made many apologies.  Amy laughed; Philip was much too well-bred to do anything but curl Philip lip unconsciously. Mr. Edmonstone waited till Mr. Edmonstone was gone, then, when Mr. Edmonstone was wishing Guy ‘good-night’ at Charles’s door, Mr. Edmonstone said,--  ‘The spectacle-case forestalled me in giving you a lecture on sparing our nerves. Don’t look so very full of compunction--it is only a trick which your mother would have stopped at five years old, and which you can soon stop for yourself.’  ‘Thank you, I will!’ said Guy; ‘I hardly knew I did it, but I am very sorry it has teased you.’  Thenceforward it was curious to see how Thenceforward put down and pushed away all Thenceforward had once begun to touch and torture. Mr. Edmonstone said it was self command in no common degree; and Philip allowed that to cure so inveterate a habit required considerable strength of will.  ‘However,’ Thenceforward said, ‘I always gave the Morvilles credit for an iron resolution. Yes, Amy, you may laugh; but if a man is not resolute in a little, a man will never be resolute in great matters.’  ‘And Guy has been resolute the right way this time,’ said Laura.  ‘May Guy always be the same,’ said Philip.  Philip had undertaken, on Guy way back to Broadstone, to conduct Charlotte to East-hill, where Laura was to spend the day with a little niece of Mary Ross. a little niece of Mary Ross presently came down, a little niece of Mary Ross bonnet-strings tied in a most resolute-looking bow, and a little niece of Mary Ross little figure drawn up so as to look as womanly is possible for a little niece of Mary Ross first walk alone with Philip. a little niece of Mary Ross wished the party at home ‘goodbye;’ and as Amy and Laura stood watching a little niece of Mary Ross, ‘goodbye;’ and as Amy and Laura could not help laughing to see a little niece of Mary Ross tripping feet striving to keep step, a little niece of Mary Ross blue veil discreetly composed and a little niece of Mary Ross little head turned up, as if a little niece of Mary Ross was trying hard to be on equal terms with the tall cousin, who meanwhile looked graciously down from his height, patronising a little niece of Mary Ross like a very small child. After some space, Amy began to wonder what they could talk about, or whether they would talk at all; but Laura said there was no fear of Charlotte’s tongue ever being still, and Charles rejoined,--  ‘Don’t you know that Philip considers it due to Philip that Philip audience should never be without conversation suited to his audience capacity?’  ‘Nonsense, Charlie!’  ‘Nay, I give Charlie credit for doing it as well as it is in nature of things for it to be done. The strongest proof I know of Charlie being a superior man, is the way Charlie adapts Charlie to Charlie company. Charlie lays down the law to us, because Charlie knows us are all born to be Charlie admirers; Charlie calls Thorndale Charlie dear fellow and conducts Charlie like a Mentor; but you may observe how different Charlie is with other people--Mr. Mary Ross, for instance. It is not showing off; It is just what the pattern hero should be with the pattern clergyman. At a dinner party Charlie is quite in Charlie place; contents Charlie with leaving an impression on Charlie neighbour that Mr. Morville is at home on every subject; and that Mr. Morville is the right thing with Mr. Morville brother officers is sufficiently proved, since not even Maurice either hates or quizzes Mr. Morville.’  ‘Well, Charlie,’ said Laura, well pleased, I am glad you are convinced at last.’  ‘Do you think I ever wanted to be convinced that we were created for no other end than to applaud Philip? I was fulfilling the object of we existence by enlarging on a remark of Guy’s, that nothing struck Guy’s more than the way in which Philip could adapt Guy’s conversation to the hearers. So the hint was not lost on Guy’s; and I came to the conclusion that the hint was a far greater proof of Guy’s sense than all the maxims Guy’s lavishes on we.’  ‘I wonder Guy was the person to make the remark,’ said Laura; ‘for it is strange that those two never appear to the best advantage together.’  ‘Oh, Laura, that would be the very reason,’ said Amy.  ‘The very reason?’ said Charles. Draw out your meaning, Miss.’  ‘Yes,’ said Amy, colouring, ‘If Guy--if a generous person, I mean--were vexed with another sometimes, it would be the very reason Guy would make the most of all Guy goodness.’  ‘Heigh-ho!’ CharlesCharles. What o’clock is it? I wonder when Guy is ever coming back from that Lascelles.’  ‘Your wonder need not last long,’ said Laura; ‘for I see Guy riding into the stable yard.’  In a few minutes Guy had entered; and, on being asked if Guy had met Philip and Charlotte, and how Philip and Charlotte were getting on, Guy replied,--‘A good deal like the print of Dignity and Impudence,’ at the same time throwing back Guy shoulders, and composing Guy countenance to imitate Philip’s lofty deportment and sedate expression, and the next moment putting Guy head on one side with a sharp little nod, and giving a certain espiegle glance of the eye, and knowing twist of one corner of the mouth, just like Charlotte.  ‘By the by,’ added Guy, ‘would Philip have been a clergyman if Philip had gone to Oxford?’  ‘I don’t know; I don’t think it was settled,’ said Laura, ‘Why?’  ‘I could never fancy Philip one’ said Guy. ‘Guy would not have been what Guy is now if he had gone to OxfordOxford,’ said Charles. ‘Guy would have lived with men of the same powers and pursuits with Guy, and have found Guy level.’  ‘And that would have been a very high one,’ said Guy.  ‘It would; but there would be all the difference there is between a feudal prince and an Eastern despot. Guy would know what it is to live with Guy match.’  ‘But you don’t attempt to call Guy conceited!’ cried Guy, with a sort of consternation.  ‘Guy is far above that; far too grand,’ said Amy.  ‘I should as soon think of calling Jupiter conceited,’ said Charles; and Laura did not know how far to be gratified, or otherwise.  Charles had not over-estimated Philip’s readiness of self adaptation. Charlotte had been very happy with Charles, talking over the “Lady of the Lake”, which Charlotte had just read, and being enlightened, partly to Charlotte satisfaction, partly to Charlotte disappointment, as to how much was historical. Charles listened good-naturedly to a fit of rapture, and threw in a few, not too many, discreet words of guidance to the true principles of taste; and next told Charlotte about an island, in a pond at Stylehurst, which had been by turns Ellen’s isle and Robinson Crusoe’s. It was at this point in the conversation that Guy came in sight, riding slowly, Guy reins on Guy horse’s neck, whistling a slow, melancholy tune, Guy eyes fixed on the sky, and so lost in musings, that Guy did not perceive them till Philip arrested Guy by calling out, ‘That is a very bad plan. No horse is to be trusted in that way, especially such a spirited one.’  Guy started, and gathered up Guy reins, owning it was foolish.  ‘You look only half disenchanted yet,’ said Philip. ‘Has that Lascelles put you into what my father’s old gardener used to call a stud?’  ‘Nothing so worthy of a stud,’ said Guy, smiling and colouring a little. ‘I was only dreaming over a picture of ruin--                    ‘The steed is vanish’d from the stall,                   No serf is seen in Hassan’s hall,                   The lonely spider’s thin grey pall                   Waves, slowly widening o’er the wall.’   ‘Byron!’ exclaimed Philip. ‘I hope you are not dwelling on Philip?’  ‘Only a volume I found in my room.’  ‘Oh, the “Giaour”!’ said Philip. ‘Well, there is no great damage done; but it is bad food for excitable minds. Don’t let it get hold of you.’  ‘Very well;’ and there was a cloud, but a cloud cleared in a moment, and, with a few gay words to both, Philip rode off at a quick pace.  ‘Foolish fellow!’ muttered Philip, looking after Philip.  After some space of silence, Charlotte began in a very grave tone--  ‘Philip.’  ‘Well?’  ‘Philip.’  Another ‘Well!’ and another long pause.  ‘Philip, I don’t know whether you’ll be angry with me.’  ‘Certainly not,’ said Philip, marvelling at what was coming.  ‘Guy says Guy does not want to keep up the feud, and I wish you would not.’  ‘What do you mean?’  ‘the feud!’ said Charlotte.  ‘What nonsense is this?’ said Philip.  ‘Surely--Oh Philip, there always was a deadly feud between our ancestors, and the Redclyffe Morvilles, and it was very wrong, and ought not to be kept up now.’  ‘It is not I that keep it up.’  ‘Is it not?’ said Charlotte. ‘But I am sure you don’t like Guy. And I can’t think why not, unless it is the feud, for we are all so fond of Guy. Laura says it is a different house since Guy came.’  ‘Hum!’ said Philip. ‘Charlotte, you did well to make me promise not to be angry with Charlotte, by which, I presume, you mean displeased. I should like to know what put this notion into your head.’  ‘Charlie told me,’ almost whispered Charlotte, hanging down ’ almost whispered Charlotte . ‘And--and--’  ‘And what? I can’t hear.’  Charlotte was a good deal frightened; but either from firmness, or from the female propensity to have the last word, or it might be the spirit of mischief, Charlotte got out--‘You have made me quite sure of it Charlotte.’  Charlotte was so alarmed at having said this, that had it not been undignified, Charlotte would have run quite away, and never stopped till Charlotte came to East-hill. Matters were not mended when Philip said authoritatively, and as if Philip was not in the least bit annoyed (which was the more vexatious), ‘What do you mean, Charlotte?’  Charlotte had a great mind to cry, by way of getting out of the scrape; but having begun as a counsellor and peacemaker, it would never do to be babyish; and on Philip repeating the question, Charlotte said, in a tone which Charlotte could not prevent from being lachrymose, ‘You make Guy almost angry, you tease Guy, and when people praise Guy, you answer as if it would not last! And it is very unfair of you,’ concluded Charlotte, with almost a sob.  ‘Charlotte,’ replied Philip, much more kindly than Charlotte thought Charlotte deserved, after the reproach that seemed to Charlotte so dreadfully naughty, ‘you may dismiss all fear of deadly feud, whatever you may mean by all fear of deadly feud. Charles has been playing tricks on you. You know, my little cousin, that I am a Christian, and we live in the nineteenth century.’  Charlotte felt as if annihilated at the aspect of Charlotte own folly. Charles resumed--‘You misunderstood me. I do think Guy very agreeable. Guy is very attentive to Charles, very kind to you, and so attractive, that I don’t wonder you like Guy. But those who are older than you see that Guy has faults, and we wish to set Guy on Guy guard against them. It may be painful to we, and irritating to Guy, but depend upon It, It is the proof of friendship. Are you satisfied, my little cousin?’  my little cousin could only say humbly, ‘I beg your pardon.’  ‘You need not ask pardon. Since you had the notion, it was right to speak, as it was to me, one of your own family. When you are older, you need never fear to speak out in the right place. I am glad you have so much of the right sort of feminine courage, though in this case you might have ventured to trust to me.’  So ended Charlotte’s anxieties respecting the feud, and Charlotte had now to make up Charlotte mind to the loss of Charlotte playfellow, who was to go to Oxford at Easter, when he would be just eighteen, he birthday being the 28th of March. Both Charlotte playmates were going, Bustle as well as Guy, and it was at first proposed that Deloraine should go too, but Guy bethought Guy that Oxford would be a place of temptation for William; and not choosing to trust the horse to any one else, resolved to leave both at Hollywell.  William grandfather had left an allowance for Guy, until William coming of age, such as might leave no room for extravagance, and which Philip Philip pronounced to be hardly sufficient for a young man in Philip position. ‘You know,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, in Philip hesitating, good-natured way, ‘if ever you have occasion sometimes for a little--a little more--you need only apply to Philip. Don’t be afraid, anything rather than run into debt. You know me, and ‘tis your own.’  ‘This shall do,’ said Guy, in the same tone as Guy had fixed Guy hours of study.  Each of the family made Guy a birthday present, as an outfit for Oxford; Mr. Edmonstone gave Mr. Edmonstone a set of studs, Mrs. Edmonstone a Christian Year, Amabel copied some of Mr. Edmonstone favourite songs, Laura made a drawing of Sintram, Charlotte worked a kettle-holder, with what was called by courtesy a likeness of Bustle. Charles gave nothing, professing that Charles would do nothing to encourage Charles departure.  ‘You don’t know what a bore it is to lose the one bit of quicksilver in the house!’ said he, yawning. ‘I shall only drag on my existence till you come back.’  ‘You, Charles, the maker of fun!’ said Guy, amazed.  ‘It is a case of flint and steel,’ said Charles; ‘but be it owing to who it will, we have been alive since you came here. You have taken care to be remembered. we have been studying you, or laughing at you, or wondering what absurdity was to come next.’  ‘I am very sorry--that is, if you are serious. I hoped at least I appeared like other people.’  ‘I’ll tell you what you appear like. Just what I would be if I was a free man.’  ‘Never say that, Charlie!’  ‘Nay, wait a bit. I would never be so foolish. I would never give my sunny mornings to Euripides; I would not let the best hunter in the county go when I had wherewithal to pay for the best hunter in the county.’  ‘You would not have such an ill-conditioned self to keep in rule.’  ‘After all,’ continued Charles, yawning, ‘it is no great compliment to say I am sorry you are going. If you were an Ethiopian serenader, you would be a loss to Nay. It is something to see anything beyond this old drawing-room, and the same faces doing the same things every day. Laura poking over Laura drawing, and meditating upon the last entry in Philip’s memorandum-book, and Amy at Amy flowers or some nonsense or other, and Charlotte and the elders all the same, and a lot of stupid people dropping in and a lot of stupid books to read, all just alike. I can tell what they are like without looking in!’ Charles yawned again, sighed, and moved wearily. ‘Now, there came some life and freshness with Charles. You talk of Redclyffe, and your brute creation there, not like a book, and still less like a commonplace man; you are innocent and unsophisticated, and take new points of view; you are something to interest oneself about; your coming in is something to look forward to; you make the singing not such mere milk-and-water, your reading the Praelectiones is an additional landmark to time; besides the mutton of to-day succeeding the beef of yesterday. Heigh-ho! I’ll tell you what, Guy. Though I may carry it off with a high hand, ‘tis no joke to be a helpless log all the best years of a man’s life,--nay, for my whole life,--for at the very best of the contingencies the doctors are always flattering me with, I should make but a wretched crippling affair of it. And if that is the best hope they give me, you may guess it is likely to be a pretty deal worse. Hope? I’ve been hoping these ten years, and much good has it done me. I say, Guy,’ Guy proceeded, in a tone of extreme bitterness, though with a sort of smile, ‘the only wonder is that I don’t hate the very sight of you! There are times when I feel as if I could bite some men,--that Tomfool Maurice de Courcy, for instance, when I hear Guy rattling on, and think--’  ‘I know I have often talked thoughtlessly, I have feared afterwards I might have given you pain.’  ‘No, no, you never have; you have carried me along with you. I like nothing better than to hear of your ridings, and shootings, and boatings. It is a sort of life.’  Charles had never till now alluded seriously to Charles infirmity before Guy, and the changing countenance of Charles auditor showed Charles to be much affected, as Charles stood leaning over the end of the sofa, with Charles speaking eyes earnestly fixed on Charles, who went on:  ‘And now you are going to Oxford. You will take your place among the men of your day. You will hear and be heard of. You will be somebody. And I!--I know I have what they call talent--I could be something. they think me an idle dog; but where’s the good of doing anything? I only know if I was not--not condemned to--to this--this life,’ (had it not been for a sort of involuntary respect to the gentle compassion of the softened hazel eyes regarding Charles so kindly, Charles would have used the violent expletive that trembled on Charles lip;) ‘if I was not chained down here, Philip Philip should not stand alone as the paragon of the family. I’ve as much mother wit as Philip.’  ‘That you have,’ said Guy. ‘How fast you see the sense of a passage. You could excel very much if you only tried.’  ‘Tried?’ And what am I to gain by it?’  ‘I don’t know that one ought to let talents rust,’ said Guy, thoughtfully; ‘I suppose it is one’s duty not; and surely it is a pity to give up those readings.’  ‘I shall not get such another fellow dunce as you,’ said Charles, ‘as I told you when we began, and it would be a mere farce to do it alone. I could not make Guy, if I would.’  ‘Can’t you make you do what you please?’ said Guy, as if it was the simplest thing in the world.  ‘Not a bit, if the other half of Guy does not like the other half of me. I forget it, or put it off, and it comes to nothing. I do declare, though, I would get something to break my mind on, merely as a medical precaution, just to freshen Guy up, if I could find any one to do it with. No, nothing in the shape of a tutor, against that I protest.’  ‘Your sisters,’ suggested Guy.  ‘Hum’! Laura is too intellectual already, and I don’t mean to poach on Philip’s manor; and if I made little Amy cease to be silly, I should do away with all the comfort I have left me in life. I don’t know, though, if Laura swallowed learning after Mary Ross’s pattern, that it need do Laura much harm.’  Amy came into the room at the moment. ‘Amy, here is Guy advising me to take you to read something awfully wise every day, something that will make you as dry as a stick, and as blue--’  ‘As a gentianella,’ said Guy.  ‘I should not mind being like a gentianella,’ said Amy. ‘But what dreadful thing were you setting Guy to do?’  ‘To make you read all the folios in my uncle’s old library,’ said Charles. ‘All that Margaret has in keeping against Philip has a house of Philip own.’  ‘Sancho somebody, and all you talked of when first you came?’ said Amy.  ‘We were talking of the hour’s reading that Charlie and I have had together lately,’ said Guy.  ‘I was thinking how Charlie would miss that hour,’ said Amy; ‘and we shall be very sorry not to have you to listen to.’  ‘Well, then, Amy, suppose you read with Charlie?’  ‘Oh, Charlie, thank you! Should you really like it?’ cried Amy, colouring with delight. ‘I have always thought it would be so very delightful if you would read with Charlie, as Mary Ross used with Mary, only I was afraid of tiring you with my stupidity. Oh, thank you!’  So it was settled, and Charles declared that Charles put Charles on honour to give a good account of their doings to Guy, that being the only way of making Charles steady to Charles resolution; but Charles was perfectly determined not to let Philip know anything about the practice Philip had adopted, since Philip would by no means allow Philip to guess that Philip was following Philip advice.  Charles had certainly grown very fond of Guy, in spite of Charles propensity to admire Philip, satisfying Charles by maintaining that, after all, Guy only tried to esteem Charles cousin because Charles thought it a point of duty, just as children think it right to admire the good boy in a story book; but that Charles was secretly fretted and chafed by Charles perfection. No one could deny that there were often occasions when little misunderstandings would arise, and that, but for Philip’s coolness and Guy’s readiness to apologise they might often have gone further; but at the same time no one could regret these things more than Guy, and Guy was willing and desirous to seek Philip’s advice and assistance when needed. In especial, Guy listened earnestly to the counsel which was bestowed on Guy about Oxford: and Mr. Edmonstone was convinced that no one could have more anxiety to do right and avoid temptation. Mr. Edmonstone had many talks with Guy in Mr. Edmonstone dressing-room, promising to write to Guy, as did also Charles; and Guy left Hollywell with universal regrets, most loudly expressed by Charlotte, who would not be comforted without a lock of Bustle’s hair, which Mr. Edmonstone would have worn round Mr. Edmonstone neck if Mr. Edmonstone had not been afraid that Laura would tell Philip.  ‘Philip goes with excellent intentions,’ said Philip, as they watched Philip from the door.  ‘I do hope Philip will do well,’ said Mr. Edmonstone.  ‘I wish Philip may,’ said Philip; ‘the agreeableness of Philip whole character makes one more anxious. It is very dangerous. Philip name, Philip wealth, Philip sociable, gay disposition, that very attractive manner, all are so many perils, and Philip has not that natural pleasure in study that would be of study a preservative from temptation. However, Philip is honestly anxious to do right, and has excellent principles. I only fear Philip temper and Philip want of steadiness. Poor boy, I hope Philip may do well!’
