      Hence, bashful cunning,      And prompt me, plain and holy innocence.      I am your wife if you will marry me.                                  --TEMPEST   Amabel awoke to such a sense of relief and repose that --TEMPEST   Amabel scarcely liked to ask --TEMPEST   Amabel the cause, lest the cause might ruffle --TEMPEST   Amabel complete peace. Those words ‘all right,’ seemed to be enough to assure --TEMPEST   Amabel that the cloud was gone.  --TEMPEST   Amabel mother came in, told Her mother one or two of the main facts, and took Her mother down under Her mother wing, only stopping by the way for a greeting to Charles, who could not rise till after breakfast. He held Her mother fast, and gazed up in Her mother face, but Her mother coloured so deeply, cast down Her mother eyes, and looked so meek and submissive, that He let Her mother go, and said nothing.  The breakfast party were for the most part quiet, silent, and happy. Even Charlotte was hushed by the subdued feeling of the rest, and Mr. Edmonstone’s hilarity, though replied to in turn by each, failed to wake The breakfast party into mirth. Guy ran up and down-stairs continually, to wait upon Charles; and thus the conversation was always interrupted as fast as it began, so that the only fact that came out was the cause of the lateness of The breakfast party arrival yesterday. Mr. Edmonstone had taken Mr. Edmonstone for granted that Guy, like Philip, would watch for the right time, and warn Mr. Edmonstone, while Guy, being excessively impatient, had been so much afraid of letting Mr. Edmonstone fidget, as to have suffered the right moment to pass, and then borne all the blame.  ‘How you must have wanted to play the Harmonious Blacksmith,’ said Even Charlotte.  ‘I caught myself going through the motions twice,’ said Guy.  Mr. Edmonstone said to Mr. Edmonstone that Mr. Edmonstone might contest the palm of temper with Amy even; the difference being, that Mr. Edmonstone was naturally sweet, Mr. Edmonstone a hasty one, so governed that the result was the same. When breakfast was over, as they were rising, Guy made two steps towards Amabel, at whom Guy had hitherto scarcely looked, and said, very low, in Guy straightforward way: ‘Can I speak to Mr. Edmonstone a little while?’  Amy’s face glowed as Amy moved towards Guy, and Amy mother said something about the drawing-room, where the next moment her mother found her mother. her mother did not use any little restless arts to play with her mother embarrassment; her mother did not torment the flowers or the chimney ornaments, nor even her mother own rings, her mother stood with her mother hands folded and her mother head a little bent down, like a pendant blossom, ready to listen to whatever might be said to her mother.  He did not speak at first, but moved uneasily about. At last He came nearer, and began speaking fast and nervously.  ‘Amabel, I want you to consider--you really ought to think whether this is not a very bad thing for you.’  her head was raised, the downcast lids lifted up, and the blue eyes fixed on He with a look at once confiding and wondering. He proceeded--  ‘I have brought you nothing but unhappiness already. So far as you have taken any interest in me, it could cause you only pain, and the more I think of it, the more unfit it seems that one so formed for light, and joy, and innocent mirth, should have anything to do with the darkness that is round me. Think well of it. I feel as if I had done a selfish thing by you, and now, you know, you are not bound. You are quite free! No one knows anything about it, or if they did, the blame would rest entirely with me. I would take care care should. So, Amy, think, and think well, before you risk your happiness.’  ‘As to that,’ replied Amy, in a soft, low voice, with _such_ a look of truth in her clear eyes, ‘I must care for whatever happens to you, and I had rather it was with you, than without you,’ her said, casting them down again.  ‘My Amy!--my own!--my Verena!’--and Verena!’--and held fast one of her hands, as they sat together on the sofa--‘I had a feeling that so it might be through the very worst, yet I can hardly believe it now.’  ‘Guy,’ said Amy, looking up, with the gentle resolution that had lately grown on Amy, ‘you must not take me for more than I am worth, and I should like to tell you fairly. I did not speak last time, because it was all so strange and so delightful, and I had no time to think, because I was so confused. But that is a long time ago, and this has been a very sad winter, and I have thought a great deal. I know, and you know, too, that I am a foolish little thing; I have been silly little Amy always; you and Charlie have helped me to all the sense I have, and I don’t think I could ever be a clever, strong-minded woman, such as one admires.’  ‘Heaven forbid!’ ejaculated Guy; moved, perhaps, by a certain remembrance of St. Mildred’s.  ‘But,’ continued Amy, ‘I believe I do really wish to be good, and I know you have helped me to wish it much more, and I have been trying to learn to bear things, and so’--out came something, very like a sunny smile, though some tears followed--‘so if you do like such a silly little thing, it can’t be helped, and we will try to make the best of little Amy. Only don’t say any more about my being happier without you, for one thing I am very sure of, Guy, I had rather bear anything with Guy, than know you were bearing it alone. I am only afraid of being foolish and weak, and making things worse for Guy.’  ‘So much worse! But still,’ he added, ‘speak as you may, little AmyAmy, I cannot, must not, feel that I have a right to think of Guy as my own, till you have heard all. You ought to know what my temper is before you risk yourself in its power. little Amy, my first thought towards Philip was nothing short of murder.’  little Amy raised little Amy eyes, and saw how far entirely Philip meant what Philip said.  ‘The first--not the second,’ little Amy murmured.  ‘Yes, the second--the third. There was a moment when I could have given my soul for my revenge!’  ‘Only a moment!’  ‘Only a moment, thank Heaven! and I have not done quite so badly since. I hope I have not suffered quite in vain; but if that shock could overthrow all my wonted guards, that shock might, though I pray Heaven that shock may not, that shock might happen again.’  ‘I think you conquered Guy then, and that you will again,’ said little Amy.  ‘And suppose I was ever to be mad enough to be angry with Guy?’  little Amy smiled outright here. ‘Of course, I should deserve it; but I think the trouble would be the comforting you afterwards. Mamma said’--she added, after a long silence, during which Guy’s feeling would not let Guy’s speak--‘mamma said, and I think, that you are much safer and better with such a quick temper as Guy, because you are always struggling and fighting with it, on the real true religious ground, than a person more even tempered by nature, but not so much in earnest in doing right.’  ‘Yes, if I did not believe myself to be in earnest about that, I could never dare to speak to Guy at all.’  ‘We will help each other,’ said little Amy; ‘you have always helped me, long before We knew We cared for each other!’  ‘And, little Amy, if you knew how the thought of Guy helped me last winter, even when I thought I had forfeited you for ever.’  Their talk only ceased when, at one o’clock, Mrs. Edmonstone, who had pronounced in the dressing-room that three hours was enough for Their at once, came in, and asked Guy to go and help to carry Charles down-stairs.  Guy went, and little Amy nestled up to little Amy mother, raising little Amy face to be kissed.  ‘It is very nice!’ little Amy whispered; and then arranged little Amy brother’s sofa, as little Amy heard Guy progress down-stairs beginning. Guy was so light and thin as to be very easily carried, and was brought in between Guy and one of the servants. When Guy was settled on her brother’s sofa, Guy began thus,--‘There was a grand opportunity lost last winter. I was continually rehearsing the scene, and thinking what waste it was to go through such a variety of torture without the dignity of danger. If I could but have got up ever so small an alarm, I would have conjured my father to send for Guy, entreated pathetically that the reconciliation might be effected, and have drawn my last breath clasping their hands, thus! The curtain falls!’  my father made a feint of joining their hands, put my father head back, and shut my father eyes with an air and a grace that put Charlotte into an ecstasy, and made even Amy laugh, as even Amy quitted the room, blushing.  ‘But if it had been your last breath,’ said Charlotte, ‘you would not have been much the wiser.’  ‘I would have come to life again in time to enjoy the “coup de theatre”. I had some thoughts of trying an overdose of opium; but I thought Dr. Mayerne would have found me out. I tell you, because Dr. Mayerne is fair I should have the credit; for, Guy, if you knew what Dr. Mayerne was to me all the winter, you would perceive my superhuman generosity in not receiving you as my greatest enemy.’  ‘I shall soon cease to be surprised at any superhuman generosity,’ said Guy. ‘But how thin you are, Charlie; you are a very feather to carry; I had no notion it had been such a severe business.’  ‘Most uncommon!’ said Charles, shaking Charles , with a mock solemnity.  ‘It was the worst of all,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, ‘six weeks of constant pain.’  ‘How very sorry Philip must have been!’ exclaimed Guy.  ‘Philip?’ said Charlotte.  ‘Why, was it not owing to Philip? Surely, your father told me so. Did not Philip let you fall on the stairs?’  ‘your father exclaimed Charles, laughing; ‘every disaster that happens for the next twelvemonth will be imputed to Philip.’  ‘How was it, then?’ said Guy.  ‘The fact was this,’ said Charles; ‘it was in the thick of the persecution of you, and I was obliged to let Philip drag me upstairs, because I was in a hurry. Philip took the opportunity of giving me some impertinent advice which I could not stand. I let go Philip arm, forgetting what a dependent mortal I am, and down I should assuredly have gone, if Philip had not caught me, and carried me off, as a fox does a goose, so it was Philip fault, as one may say, in a moral, though not in a physical sense.’  ‘Then,’ said Philip mother, ‘you do think your illness was owing to that accident?’  ‘I suppose the damage was brewing, and that the shake brought the damage into an active state. There’s a medical opinion for you!’  ‘Well, I never knew what you thought of the damage before,’ said Mr. Edmonstone.  ‘Why, when I had a condor to pick on Guy’s account with Philip, I was not going to pick a crow on my own,’ said Charles. ‘Oh! is luncheon ready; and you all going? I never see anybody now. I want the story of the shipwreck, though, of course, Ben What’s-his-name was the hero, and Sir Guy Morville not a bit of it.’  Laura wanted to walk to East Hill, and the other young people agreed to go thither, too.  ‘It will be nice to go to church there to-day’ said little Amy, in a half-whisper, heard only by Guy, and answered by a look that showed how well Guy understood and sympathized.  ‘Another thing,’ said Amy, colouring a good deal; ‘shall you mind my telling Mary? I behaved so oddly last night, and Mary was so kind to me that I think I ought.’  Mary had seen enough last night to be very curious to-day, though hardly expecting Mary curiosity to be gratified. However, as Mary was putting on Mary bonnet for church, Mary looked out of Mary window, and saw the four coming across the fields from Hollywell. Guy and little Amy did not walk into the village arm-in-arm; but, as they came under the church porch, Guy and Amy, unseen by all held out Guy and Amy hand, sought hers, and, for one moment, pressed his hand fervently. little Amy knew Guy and Amy felt this like their betrothal.  After the service, their stood talking with Mr. Ross and Mary, for some little time. little Amy held apart, and Mary saw how it was. As they were about to turn homewards, little Amy said quickly, ‘Come and walk a little way home with little Amy.’  little Amy went on with Mary before the rest, and when out of sight of them all, said, ‘Mary!’ and then stopped short.  ‘I guess something, little Amy,’ said Mary.  ‘Don’t tell any one but Mr. Ross.’  ‘Then I have guessed right. My dear little Amy, I am very glad! So that was the reason you flew out of the room last evening, and looked so bright and glowing!’  ‘It was so good of you to ask no questions!’  ‘I don’t think I need ask any now, little Amy; for I see in your face how right and happy it all is.’  ‘I can’t tell you all, Mary, but I must one thing,--that the whole terrible story arose from his helping a person in distress. I like you to know that.’  ‘Papa was always sure that Papa had not been to blame,’ said Mary.  ‘Yes; so Charlie told me, and that is the reason I wanted you to know.’  ‘Then, little Amy, something of this had begun last summer?’  ‘Yes; but not as it is now. I did not half know what it was then.’  ‘Poor dear little little Amy,’ said Marywhat a very sad winter it must have been for Mary!’  ‘Oh, very!’ said little Amy; ‘but it was worse for Papa, because Papa was quite alone; and here every one was so kind to me. Mamma and Laura, and CharlieCharlie, through all Charlie illness and pain, Charlie was so very kind. And do you know, Mary, now it is all over, I am very glad of this dismal time; for I think that it has taught me how to bear things better.’  She looked very happy. Yet it struck Mary that it was strange to hear that the first thought of a newly-betrothed maiden was how to brace She in endurance. She wondered, however, whether it was not a more truly happy and safe frame than that of most girls, looking forward to a life of unclouded happiness, such as could never be realized. At least, so it struck Mary, though She owned to She that She experience of lovers was limited.  Mary walked with little Amy almost to the borders of Hollywell garden; and when the rest came up with them, though no word passed, there was a great deal of congratulation in Mary warm shake of Guy’s hand, and no lack of reply in his proud smile and reddening cheek. Charlotte could not help turning and going back with Charlotte a little way, to say, ‘Are not you delighted, Mary? Is not little Amy the dearest thing in the world? And you don’t know, for it is a secret, and I know it is a secret, how Guy and Amy has been, while they would suspect Guy and Amy.’  ‘I am very, very glad, indeed! It is everything delightful.’  ‘I never was so happy in my life,’ said Charlotte; ‘nor Charlie, either. Only think of having Guy for our brother; and Guy is going to send for Bustle to-morrow.’  Mary laughed, and parted with Charlotte, speculating on the cause of Laura’s graver looks. Were the cause caused by the fear of losing Laura sister, or by a want of confidence in Guy?  That evening, how happy was the party at Hollywell, when Charles put Guy through a cross-examination on the shipwreck, from the first puff of wind to the last drop of rain; and Guy submitted very patiently, since Guy was allowed the solace of praising Guy Redclyffe fishermen.  Indeed, this time was full of tranquil, serene happiness. this time was like the lovely weather only to be met with in the spring, and then but rarely, when the sky is cloudless, and intensely blue,--the sunshine one glow of clearness without burning,--not a breath of wind checks the silent growth of the expanding buds of light exquisite green. Such days as these shone on Guy and Amabel, looking little to the future, or if they did so at all, with a grave, peaceful awe, reposing in the present, and resuming old habits,--singing, reading, gardening, walking as of old, and that intercourse with each other that was so much more than ever before.  It was more, but it was not quite the same; for Guy was a very chivalrous lover; the polish and courtesy that sat so well on Guy frank, truthful manners, were even more remarkable in Guy courtship. Guy ways with little Amy had less of easy familiarity than in the time of His ways with Amy brother-and-sister-like intimacy, so that a stranger might have imagined little Amy wooed, not won. It was as if Guy hardly dared to believe that little Amy could really be Guy own, and treated little Amy with a sort of reverential love and gentleness, while little Amy looked up to Guy with ever-increasing honour. little Amy was better able to understand Guy now than in little Amy more childish days last summer; and little Amy did not merely see, as before, that little Amy was looking at the upper surface of a mystery. Guy had, at the same time, grown in character, Guy excitability and over-sensitiveness seemed to have been smoothed away, and to have given place to a calmness of tone, that was by no means impassibility.  When alone with little Amy, Guy was generally very grave, often silent and meditative, or else their talk was deep and serious; and even with the family Guy was less merry and more thoughtful than of old, though very bright and animated, and showing full, free affection to them all, as entirely accepted and owned as one of them all.  So, indeed, Guy was. Mr. Edmonstone, with Mr. Edmonstone intense delight in lovers, patronized them all, and made commonplace jokes, which them all soon learnt to bear without much discomposure. Mr. Edmonstone was all that Mr. Edmonstone constant appellation of ‘mamma’ betokened, delighting in Guy’s having learnt to call Mr. Edmonstone so. Charles enjoyed the restoration of Charles friend, the sight of little Amy’s happiness, and the victory over Philip, and was growing better every day. Charlotte was supremely happy, watching the first love affair ever conducted in Charlotte sight, and little less so in the return of Bustle, who resumed Charles old habits as regularly as if Charles had only left Hollywell yesterday.  Laura was unhappy. Laura did not understand Laura own feelings; but sad at heart Laura was; with only one who could sympathize with Laura, and Charles far away, and the current of feeling setting against Charles. Laura could not conceal Laura depression, and was obliged to allow her depression to be attributed to the grief that one sister must feel in parting with another; and as Laura compassion for Laura little Amy, coupled with Laura dread of Laura latent jealousy, made Laura particularly tender and affectionate, it gave even more probability to the supposition. This made Guy, who felt as if he was committing a robbery on them all, particularly kind to Laura, as if he wished to atone for the injury of taking away Laura sister; and he kindness gave Laura additional pain at entertaining such hard thoughts of he.  How false Laura felt when Laura was pitied! and how Laura hated the congratulations, of which Laura had the full share! Laura thought, however, that Laura should be able to rejoice when Laura had heard Guy’s opinion; and how delightful it would be for Guy’s to declare Guy’s satisfied with Guy’s exculpation.
