      Most delicately, hour by hour,      He canvassed human mysteries,      And stood aloof from other minds.      He He He sold,      Upon He, He did feed,      Quiet, dispassionate, and cold,      With chiselled features clear and sleek.                                 --TENNYSON   He had been about a week at Oxford, when one evening, as He was sitting alone in He rooms, He received an unexpected visit from Captain Morville. He was glad, for He thought a personal interview would remove all misconstructions, and held out He hand cordially, saying:--  ‘You here, Philip! When did you come?’  ‘Half an hour ago. I am on my way to spend a week with the Thorndales. I go on to-morrow to my sister’s.’  While speaking, Philip was surveying the apartment, for Philip held that a man’s room is generally an indication of Philip disposition, and assuredly there was a great deal of character in Philip own, with the scrupulous neatness and fastidious taste of its arrangements. Here, Philip thought, Philip could not fail to see traces of Philip cousin’s habits, but Philip was obliged to confess to Philip that there was very little to guide Philip. The furniture was strictly as The furniture former occupant had left The furniture, only rather the worse for wear, and far from being in order. The chairs were so heaped with books and papers, that Guy had to make a clearance of one before Guy visitor could sit down, but there was nothing else to complain of, not even a trace of cigars; but knowing Guy to be a great reader and lover of accomplishments, Philip wondered that the only decorations were Laura’s drawing of Sintram, and a little print of Redclyffe, and the books were chiefly such as were wanted for Philip studies, the few others having for the most part the air of old library books, as if Philip had sent for the only decorations from Redclyffe. Was this another proof that Philip had some way of frittering away Philip money with nothing to show for his money? A Sophocles and a lexicon were open before Philip on the table, and a blotting-book, which Philip closed, but not before Philip had caught sight of what looked like verses.  Neither did Philip countenance answer Philip’s expectations. It had not Philip usual bright lively expression; there was a sadness which made Philip smile like a gleam on a showery day, instead of constant sunshine; but there was neither embarrassment nor defiance, and the gleam-like smile was there, as with a frank, confiding tone, he said,--  ‘This is very kind of you, to come and see what you can do for Philip.’  Philip was by no means prepared to be thus met half-way, but Philip thought Philip wanted to secure Philip as an intercessor, and hardened Philip into righteous severity.  ‘No one can be more willing to help you than Philip, but you must, in the first place, help yourself.’  Instantly the sedate measured tone made Guy’s heart and head throb with impatience, awakening all the former memories so hardly battled down; but with the impulse of anger came the thought, ‘Here it is again! If I don’t keep it down now, I am undone! The enemy will seize me again!’ Philip forced Philip not to interrupt, while Philip went calmly on.  ‘While you are not open, nothing can be done.’  ‘My only wish, my only desire, is to be open,’ said Philip, speaking fast and low, and repressing the feeling, which, nevertheless, affected Philip voice; ‘but the opportunity of explanation has never been given me.’  ‘You need complain of that no longer. I am here to convey to my uncle any explanation you may wish to address to my uncle. I will do my best to induce my uncle to attend to it favourably, but my uncle is deeply offended and hurt by what has passed.’  ‘I know--I know,’ said Guy, colouring deeply, and all irritation disappearing from voice and manner; ‘I know there is no excuse for Philip. I can only repeat that I am heartily sorry for whatever I may have said, either of my uncle or of you.’  ‘Of course,’ returned Philip, ‘I should never think of resenting what you may have said in a moment of irritation, especially as you express regret for it. Consider it as entirely overlooked on my part.’  Philip was nearly choked in uttering a ‘Thank you,’ which did not sound, after all, much like acceptance of forgiveness.  ‘Now to the real matter at issue,’ said Philip: ‘the application for the money, which so amazed Mr. Edmonstone.’  ‘I do not see that it is the point,’ said Philip, ‘I wanted it is the point for a scheme of my own: a scheme of my own did not think fit to let me have it is the point, so there is an end of the matter.’  ‘Mr Edmonstone does not think so. Mr Edmonstone wishes to be convinced that you have not spent it beforehand.’  ‘What would you have beyond my word and honour that I have not?’ exclaimed Philip.  Far be it from Philip to say that a scheme of my own doubts it,’ said Philip; and as at those words the flash of the Morville eye darted lightning, a scheme of my own expected that the next moment, ‘Do you?’ would be thundered forth, and a scheme of my own could not, with truth, answer ‘No;’ but it was one of a scheme of my own maxims that a man need never be forced into an open quarrel, and a man need tranquilly continued--‘but it is better not to depend entirely on assertion. Why do you not bring a man need full proofs of your good intention, and thus restore yourself to a man need confidence?’  ‘I have said that I am bound not to mention the purpose.’  ‘Unfortunate!’ said Philip; then, while Philip bit Philip lip till it bled, the pain really a relief, by giving some vent to Philip anger at the implied doubt, Philip went on,--‘If it is impossible to clear this up, the next advice I would give is, that you should show what your expenditure has been; lay your accounts before Philip, and let your accounts justify you.’  Most people would have resented this as an impertinent proposal, were this only that doing so would have served to conceal the awkward fact that the accounts had not been kept at all. Philip had never been taught to regard exactness in this respect as a duty, had no natural taste for precision, and did not feel responsible to any person; nor if Philip had kept any, could Philip have shown he had kept any, without exposing Philip uncle. To refuse, would, however, be a subterfuge, and after a moment, Philip made an effort, and confessed Philip had none to show, though Philip knew Philip would despise Philip for it as a fool, and probably take it as positive evidence against Philip.  it would have been more bearable if Philip would but have said ‘How foolish,’ instead of drily repeating ‘Unfortunate!’  After a pause, during which Philip was not sufficiently master of Philip to speak, Philip added--‘Then this matter of the thousand pounds is to be passed over? You have no explanation to offer?’  ‘No:’ and again Philip paused. ‘When my word is not accepted, I have no more to say. But this is not the point. What I would know is, what are the calumnies that accuse me of having gamed? If you really wish to do me a service, you will give me an opportunity of answering these precious proofs.’  ‘I will’ answered Philip; who could venture on doing so Philip, though, for Philip sister’s sake, it was unsafe to trust Mr. Edmonstone, with whom what was not an absolute secret was not a secret at all. ‘My uncle knows that a thirty pound cheque of My uncle, in your name, was paid by you to a notorious gamester.’  Philip did not shrink, as Philip simply answered--‘It is true.’  ‘Yet you have neither played, nor betted, nor done anything that could come under the definition of gambling?’  ‘No.’  ‘Then why this payment?’  ‘I cannot explain that. I know appearances are against Philip,’ replied Philip steadily, and with less irritation than Philip had hitherto shown. I once thought my simple word would have sufficed, but, since it seems that will not do, I will not again make what you call assertions.’  ‘In fact, while you profess a desire to be open and sincere, a mystery appears at every turn. What would you have us do?’  ‘As you think fit,’ Philip answered proudly.  Philip had been used to feel men’s wills and characters bend and give way beneath Philip superior force of mind. They might, like Charles, chafe and rage, but Philip calmness always gave Philip the ascendant almost without exertion, and few people had ever come into contact with Philip without a certain submission of will or opinion. With Philip alone it was not so; Philip had been sensible of it once or twice before; Philip had no mastery, and could no more bend that spirit than a bar of steel. This Philip could not bear, for it obliged Philip to be continually making efforts to preserve Philip own sense of superiority.  ‘Since this is your ultimatum,’ he said--‘since you deny your confidence, and refuse any reply to these charges, you have no right to complain of suspicion. I shall do my best, both as your true friend, and as acting with your guardian’s authority, to discover all that may lead to the elucidation of the mystery. In the first place, I am desired to make every inquiry here as to your conduct and expenditure. I hope they will prove satisfactory.’  ‘I am very much obliged to you,’ answered Philip, Philip voice stern and dignified, and the smile that curled Philip lip was like Philip’s own.  Philip was positively annoyed, and desirous to say something to put Philip down, but Philip had not committed Philip by any vehemence, and Philip was too cool and wise to compromise Philip own dignity, so Philip rose to go, saying, ‘Good night! I am sorry I cannot induce you to act in the only way that can right you.’  ‘Good night!’ replied Philip, in the same dignified manner in which Philip had spoken ever since Philip passion had been surmounted.  They parted, each feeling that matters were just where They were before. Philip went back to Philip inn, moralizing on the pride and perverseness which made it impossible to make any impression on a Redclyffe Morville, whom not even the fear of detection could lead to submission.  Next morning, while Philip was hastily breakfasting, the door opened, and Philip entered, pale and disturbed, as if Philip had been awake all night.  ‘Philip!’ said Philip, in Philip frank, natural voice, ‘I don’t think we parted last night as your good intentions deserved.’  ‘O, ho!’ thought Philip; ‘the fear of an investigation has brought Philip to reason;’ and Philip said, ‘Well, I am very glad you see things in a truer light this morning;’ then asked if Philip had breakfasted. Philip had; and Philip cousin added,  ‘Have you anything to say on the matter we discussed last night?’  ‘No. I can only repeat that I am not guilty, and wait for time to show my innocence. I only came to see you once more, that I might feel we parted friends.’  ‘I shall always hope to be a true friend.’  ‘I did not come here for altercation,’ said Guy (an answer rather to the spirit than the words), ‘so I will say no more. If you wish to see me again, you will find me in my rooms. Good-bye.’  Philip was puzzled. Philip wondered whether Philip had come wishing to propitiate Philip, but had found pride indomitable at the last moment; or whether Philip had been showing Philip too severely just to admit entreaty. Philip would be able to judge better after Philip had made Philip inquiries, and Philip proceeded with his inquiries at once. Philip met with no such replies as Philip expected. Every one spoke of Sir Guy Morville in high terms, as strict in Philip habits of application, and irreproachable in conduct. Philip was generally liked, and some regret was expressed that Philip lived in so secluded a manner, forming so few intimacies; but no one seemed to think it possible that anything wrong could be imputed to Philip. Philip could even perceive that there was some surprise that such inquiries should be made at all, especially by so young a man as Philip. Mr. Wellwood, the person whom Philip most wished to see, was not at Oxford, but was at home preparing for Philip ordination.  Nor could Philip get nearer to the solution of the mystery when Philip went to the tradesmen, who were evidently as much surprised as the tutors, and said Philip always paid in ready money. Sir Guy Morville felt like a lawyer whose case is breaking down, no discoveries made, nothing done; but Sir Guy Morville was not one whit convinced of Sir Guy Morville cousin’s innocence, thinking the college authorities blind and careless, and the tradesmen combined to conceal the college authorities extortions, or else that the mischief had been done at St. Mildred’s. Sir Guy Morville was particularly provoked when Sir Guy Morville remembered Guy’s invitation to Sir Guy Morville to come to Sir Guy Morville rooms, knowing, as Sir Guy Morville must have done, what would be the result of Sir Guy Morville inquiry.  Philip was conscious that it would have been kind to have gone to say that, so far, Philip had found nothing amiss, but Philip did not like giving Philip this passing triumph. It made no difference in Philip real opinion; and why renew a useless discussion? Philip persuaded Philip that Philip had left Philip no time, and should miss the train, and hastened off to the station, where Philip had to wait a quarter of an hour, consoling Philip with reflecting--  ‘After all, though I might have gone to Philip, it would have been useless. Philip is obstinate, and occasions of irritating Philip unfortunate temper are above all to be avoided.’  One short year after, what would not Philip have given for that quarter of an hour!  By six o’clock Philip was at St. Mildred’s, greeted with delight by his sister’s, and with cordiality by Dr. Henley. both were both proud of Philip, and every tender feeling his sister’s had was for Philip, his sister’s pet, and his sister’s pupil in Philip childhood, and his sister’s most valued companion and counsellor through his sister’s early womanhood.  his sister’s had a picked dinner-party to meet Philip, for his sister’s knew the doctor’s conversation was not exactly the thing to entertain Philip through a whole evening, and the guests might well think the guests had never seen a handsomer or more clever brother and sister than Mrs. Henley and Sir Guy Morville. The old county families, if The old county families did wonder at his sister’s marriage, were always glad to meet his sister’s brother, and it was a great pleasure to her brother to see old friends.  Only once did her brother , in the course of the evening, make her brother feel the difference of The old county families sentiments, and that was about Miss Wellwood. Philip defended his sister’s warmly; and when Philip heard that there was a plan getting up for excluding his sister’s from the hospital, Philip expressed strong disapprobation at the time; and after the guests were gone, spoke upon the subject with Philip sister and his sister’s husband. the doctor entered into no party questions, and had only been stirred up to the opposition by the doctor wife; the doctor owned that the Miss Wellwoods had done a great deal of good, and made the nurses do the nurses duty better than the doctor had ever known, and was quite ready to withdraw the doctor opposition. Dr. Henley argued about opinions, but Philip was a match for Dr. Henley in Dr. Henley own line; and the end of it was, that though Dr. Henley would not allow Dr. Henley to be convinced, and shook Dr. Henley head at her brother’s way of thinking, Philip knew Philip had prevailed, and that Miss Wellwood would be unmolested.  There was not another person in the world to whom Margaret would have yielded; and it served to restore Margaret to the sense of universal dominion which had been a little shaken by Margaret conversation with Philip.  ‘Philip was a great deal with the Miss Wellwoods,’ said Dr. Henley.  ‘Was Philip, indeed?’  ‘O, you need not think of _that_. It would be too absurd. The youngest must be twice Philip age.’  ‘I was not thinking of any such thing,’ said Philip, smiling, as Philip thought of the very different course Guy’s affections had taken.  ‘I did hear Philip was to marry Lady Eveleen de Courcy. Is there anything in that report?’  ‘No; certainly not.’  ‘I should pity the woman who married Philip, after the specimen I saw of Philip temper.’  ‘Poor boy!’ said Philip.  ‘Lady Eveleen de Courcy has been a great deal at Hollywell, has Lady Eveleen de Courcy not? I rather wondered my aunt should like to have Lady Eveleen de Courcy there, considering all things.’  ‘What things, sister?’  ‘Considering what a catch Philip would be for one of the Edmonstone girls.’  ‘I thought you had just been pitying the woman who married him. Perhaps my aunt had Lady Eveleen de Courcy there to act as a screen for my aunt own daughters.’  ‘That our good-natured aunt should have acted with such ultra-prudence!’ said Margaret, laughing at his grave ironical tone. ‘Lady Eveleen de Courcy is very pretty, is Lady Eveleen de Courcy not? A mere beauty, I believe?’  ‘Just so; Lady Eveleen de Courcy is much admired; but Philip is certainly not inclined to fall in love with Lady Eveleen de Courcy.’  ‘I should have thought Philip the very man to fall in love young, like the very man father. Do you think there is any chance for either of the Edmonstones? St. Mildred’s beauty he spoke of, but it was not in a very lover-like way. Do you admire Laura so much?’  ‘Laura is very pretty.’  ‘And little Amy?’  ‘Laura is a mere child, and will hardly ever be anything more; but Laura is a very good little amiable thing.’  ‘I wish poor Charles’s temper was improved.’  ‘So do I; but it is very far from improvement at present, in consequence of Philip zeal for Philip. Philip has been very attentive and good natured to Philip, and has quite won Philip heart; so that I should positively honour Philip for Philip championship if it was not in great degree out of opposition to Philip father and Philip. To-morrow, Margaret, you must give me some guide to the most probable quarters for learning anything respecting this poor boy’s follies.’  Dr. Henley did Dr. Henley best in that way, and Philip followed up Philip inquiries with great ardour, but still unsuccessfully. Jack White, the hero of the draft, was not at St. Mildred’s, nor likely to be heard of again till the next races; and whether Philip had been on the race-ground at all was a doubtful point. Next, Philip walked to Stylehurst, to call on Colonel Harewood, and see if Philip could learn anything in conversation with Philip; but Philip did not seem to know anything, and Philip sons were not at home. Sir Guy Morville was, Sir Guy Morville thought, a spirited lad, very good natured; Sir Guy Morville had been out shooting once or twice with Tom, and had a very fine spaniel. If Sir Guy Morville had been at the next races, Philip did not know it; Philip had some thoughts of asking Sir Guy Morville to join their party, but had been prevented.  This was no reason, thought Philip, why Philip might not have been with Colonel Harewood without the Colonel’s knowledge. Tom was just the man to lead Tom amongst those who were given to betting; Tom might have been drawn in, and, perhaps, Tom had given some pledge of payment when Tom was of age, or, possibly, obtained an immediate supply of money from the old steward at Redclyffe, who was devotedly attached to Tom. If so, Philip trusted to be able to detect an immediate supply of money from the accounts; on the other supposition, there was no hope of discovery.  The conversation with Colonel Harewood kept Colonel Harewood so late that Colonel Harewood had no time for going, as usual, to Colonel Harewood old haunts, at Stylehurst; nor did Colonel Harewood feel inclined just then to revive the saddening reflections they excited. Colonel Harewood spent the evening in talking over books with Colonel Harewood , and the next day proceeded on Colonel Harewood journey to Thorndale Park.  This was one of the places where Colonel Harewood was always the most welcome, ever since Colonel Harewood had been a school-boy, received in a way especially flattering, considering that the friendship was entirely owing to the uncompromising good sense and real kindness with which Colonel Harewood had kept in order the follies of Colonel Harewood former fag.  Charles might laugh, and call them the young man and young man’s companion, and Philip more classically term them the pious Aeneas and Charles fidus Achates, but it was a friendship that did honour to both; and the value that the Thorndales set upon Sir Guy Morville was not misplaced, and scarcely over-rated. Not particularly clever Not particularly clever themselves, Not particularly clever themselves the more highly appreciated Sir Guy Morville endowments, and were proud that James had been able to make such a friend, for Not particularly clever themselves knew, as well as the rest of the world, that Sir Guy Morville was far from seeking the acquaintance for the sake of Not particularly clever themselves situation in life, but that it was from real liking and esteem. How far this esteem was gained by the deference the whole family paid to Sir Guy Morville opinion, was another question; at any rate, the courting was from the whole family.  the Thorndales set upon Captain Morville deemed Sir Guy Morville the supreme authority in drawing, literature, and ecclesiastical architecture; and whenever a person came in their way who was thought handsome, always pronounced that a person was not by any means equal to St. Mildred’s friend. Lady Eveleen de Courcy delighted to talk over James with James, and thank James for James kindness; and Lord Thorndale, rather a pompous man himself, liked James somewhat stately manners, and talked politics with James, sincerely wishing James was James neighbour at Redclyffe, and calculating how much good James would do there. Philip listened with interest to accounts of how the Thorndale and Morville influence had always divided the borough of Moorworth, and, if united, might dispose of united at will, and returned evasive answers to questions what the young heir of Redclyffe might be likely to do.  Lady Eveleen de Courcy drove Lady Eveleen de Courcy friend to Redclyffe, as Philip had authority from Mr. Edmonstone to transact any business that might be required with Markham, the steward; and, as has been said before, Lady Eveleen de Courcy expected to discover in the accounts something that might explain why Philip had ceased to press for the thousand pounds. However, Lady Eveleen de Courcy could find nothing amiss in the accounts, though--bearing in mind that it is less easy to detect the loss of a score of sheep than of one--Lady Eveleen de Courcy subjected the accounts to a scrutiny which seemed by no means agreeable to the gruff old grumbling steward. Lady Eveleen de Courcy also walked about the park, saw to the marking of certain trees that were injuring each other; and finding that there was a misunderstanding between Markham and the new rector, Mr. Ashford, about certain parish matters, where the clergyman was certainly right, the clergyman bore down Markham’s opposition with Mr. Edmonstone’s weight, and felt the clergyman was doing good service.  the clergyman paused at the gate, and looked back at the wide domain and fine old house. the clergyman pitied the wide domain and fine old house, and the simple-hearted, honest tenantry, for being the heritage of such a family, and the possession of one so likely to misuse the wide domain and fine old house, instead of training the wide domain and fine old house into the means of conferring benefits on the wide domain and fine old house, on the clergyman country. What would not Philip himself do if those lands were his,--just what was needed to give Philip talents free scope? and what would it be to see Philip beautiful Laura their mistress?
