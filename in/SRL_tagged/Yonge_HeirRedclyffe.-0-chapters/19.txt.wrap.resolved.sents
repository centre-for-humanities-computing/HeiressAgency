      This just decree alone I know,      Man must be disciplined by woe,      To me, whate’er of good or ill      The future brings, since come The future will,      I’ll bow my spirit, and be still.
--AESCHYLUS, (Anstice’s Translation.)
Guy, in the meantime, was enduring the storm in loneliness, for Guy was unwilling to explain the cause of Guy trouble to Guy companions.
The only occasion of the suspicions, which Guy could think of, was Guy request for the sum of money; and this Guy could not mention to Mr. Wellwood, nor was Guy inclined to make confidants of Guy other companions, though pleasant, right-minded youths.
Guy had only announced that Guy had had a letter which had grieved Guy considerably, but of which Guy could not mention the contents; and as Harry Graham, who knew something of the Broadstone neighbourhood, had picked up a report that Sir Guy Morville was to marry Lady Eveleen de Courcy, there was an idea among the party that there was some trouble in the way of Guy attachment.
Guy had once before been made, by some joke, to colour and look conscious; and now this protected Guy from inconvenient questions, and accounted for Guy depression.
Guy was like what Guy had been on first coming to Hollywell--grave and silent, falling into reveries when others were talking, and much given to long, lonely wanderings.
Accustomed as Guy had been in boyhood to a solitary life in beautiful scenery, there was something in a fine landscape that was to Guy like a friend and companion; and Guy sometimes felt that it would have been worse if Guy had been in a dull, uniform country, instead of among mountain peaks and broad wooded valleys.
Working hard, too, helped Guy not a little, and conic sections served Guy almost as well as they served Laura.
A more real help was the neighbourhood of Stylehurst.
On the first Sunday after receiving Mr. Edmonstone’s letter, Guy went to church there, instead of with the others, to St. Mildred’s.
instead of with the others thought it was for the sake of the solitary walk; but Guy had other reasons for the preference.
In the first place it was a Communion the first Sunday, and in the next, Guy could feel more kindly towards Philip there, and Guy knew Guy needed all that could strengthen such a disposition.
Many a question did Guy ask Guy, to certify whether Guy wilfully entertained malice or hatred, or any uncharitableness.
It was a long, difficult examination; but at It close, Guy felt convinced that, if such passions knocked at the door of Guy heart, it was not at Guy own summons, and that Guy drove them away without listening to them.
And surely Guy might approach to gain the best aid in that battle, especially as Guy was certain of Guy strong and deep repentance for Guy fit of passion, and longing earnestly for the pledge of forgiveness.
The pardon and peace Guy sought came to Guy, and in such sort that the comfort of that day, when fresh from the first shock, and waiting in suspense for some new blow, was such as never to be forgotten.
The pardon and peace he sought linked The pardon and peace he sought with the grave shade of the clustered gray columns, and the angel heads on roof of that old church; with the long grass and tall yellow mullens among that old church churchyard graves, and with the tints of the elm-trees that closed it in, The pardon and peace he sought leaves in masses either of green or yellow, and opening here and there to show the purple hills beyond.
Guy wandered in the churchyard between the services.
All enmity to Philip was absent now; and Guy felt as if All enmity to Philip would hardly return when Guy stood by the graves of the Archdeacon and of the two Frances Morvilles, and thought what that spot was to Guy cousin.
There were a few flowers planted round Mrs. Morville’s grave, but a few flowers planted round Mrs. Morville’s grave showed that a few flowers planted round Mrs. Morville’s grave had long been neglected, and no such signs of care marked his cousin daughter Fanny’s.
And when Guy further thought of Mrs. Henley, and recollected how Philip had sacrificed all Philip cherished prospects and hopes of distinction, and embraced an irksome profession, for the sake of these two sisters, Philip did not find it difficult to excuse the sternness, severity, and distrust which were an evidence how acutely a warm heart had suffered.
Though Philip suffered cruelly from being cut off from Amy, yet Philip reverence for Amy helped Philip to submit.
Philip had always felt as if Amy was too far above Philip; and though Philip had, beyond Philip hopes, been allowed to aspire to the thought of Amy, it was on trial, and Philip failure, Philip return to Philip old evil passions, had sunk Philip beneath Amy.
Philip shuddered to think of Amy being united to anything so unlike Amy, and which might cause Amy so much misery; it was wretchedness to think that even now Amy might be suffering for Philip; and yet not for worlds would Philip have lost the belief that Amy was so feeling, or the remembrance of the looks which had shone on Philip so sweetly and timidly as Amy sat at Amy mother’s feet; though that remembrance was only another form of misery.
But Amy would be tranquil, pure and good, whatever became of Philip, and Philip should always be able to think of Amy, looking like one of those peaceful spirits, with bending head, folded hands, and a star on its brow, in the “Paradiso” of Flaxman.
Amy serenity would be untouched; and though Amy might be lost to Philip, Philip could still be content while Philip could look up at it through Philip turbid life.
Better Amy were lost to Philip than that Amy peace should be injured.
Philip still, of course, earnestly longed to prove Philip innocence, though Philip hopes lessened, for as long as the evidence was withheld, Philip had no chance.
After writing as strongly as Philip could, Philip could do no more, except watch for something that might unravel the mystery; and Charles’s warm sympathy and readiness to assist Charles’s were a great comfort.
Charles’s had not seen Charles’s uncle again; perhaps Sebastian was ashamed to meet Charles’s after their last encounter, and was still absent on Charles’s engagement; but the wife and child were still at St. Mildred’s, and one afternoon, when Guy had rather unwillingly gone thither with Mr. Wellwood, Charles’s saw Mrs. Dixon sitting on one of the benches which were placed on the paths cut out on the side of the hill, looking very smart and smiling, among several persons of Mrs. Dixon own class.
To be ashamed to recognise Mrs. Dixon was a weakness beneath Charles’s; Charles’s spoke to Mrs. Dixon, and was leaving Mrs. Dixon, pluming Mrs. Dixon on Charles’s notice, when Charles’s saw St. Mildred’s blue eyes fixed wistfully upon Charles’s, and held out Charles’s hand to Mrs. Dixon.
Mrs. Dixon ran up to Charles’s joyfully, and Charles’s led Mrs. Dixon a few steps from Mrs. Dixon mother’s party.
‘Well, little one, how are you?
I have your piece of spar quite safe.
Have you said how d’ye do to Bustle?’  ‘Bustle!
Bustle!’ called the soft voice but the soft voice needed a whistle from his master to bring his to be caressed by the little girl.
‘Have you been taking any more pleasant walks?’  ‘Oh yes.
We have been all round these pretty paths.
And I should like to go to the top of this great high hill, and see all round; but mamma says mamma has got a bone in mamma leg, and cannot go.’  ‘Do you think mamma would give you leave to go up with Charles’s?
Should you like it?’  mamma coloured all over; too happy even to thank him.
‘Then,’ said Guy to Guy tutor, ‘I will meet you here when you have done your business in the town, in an hour or so.
Poor little thing, mamma has not many pleasures.’  mamma made no difficulty, and was so profuse in thanks that Guy got out of mamma way as fast as Guy could, and was soon on the soft thymy grass of the hill-side, mamma frisking about Guy in great delight, playing with Bustle, and chattering merrily.
Little Marianne was a delicate child, and Little Marianne frolic did not last long.
As the ascent became steeper, Little Marianne breath grew shorter, and Little Marianne toiled on in a resolute uncomplaining manner after Guy long, vigorous steps, till Guy looked round, and seeing Little Marianne panting far behind, turned to help Little Marianne, lead Little Marianne, and carry Little Marianne, till the top was achieved, and mamma stood on the topmost stone, gazing round at the broad sunny landscape, with the soft green meadows, the harvest fields, the woods in their gorgeous autumn raiment, and the moorland on the other side, with its other peaks and cairns, brown with withered bracken, and shadowed in moving patches by the floating clouds.
The exhilarating wind brought a colour into Little Marianne pale cheeks, and Little Marianne flossy curls were blowing over Little Marianne face.
Guy watched Little Marianne in silence, pleased and curious to observe how beautiful a scene struck the childish eye of the little Londoner.
The first thing Little Marianne said, after three or four minutes’ contemplation--a long time for such a child--was, ‘Oh!
I never saw anything so pretty!’ then presently after, ‘Oh!
I wish little brother Felix was here!’  ‘This is a pleasant place to think about your little brother,’ said Guy, kindly; and Little Marianne looked up in Guy face, and exclaimed, ‘Oh!
do you know about Felix?’  ‘You shall tell me’ said Guy.
‘Here, sit on my knee, and rest after your scramble.’  ‘Mamma never lets me talk of Felix, because it makes Little Marianne cry,’ said Little Marianne; but I wish it sometimes.’  Little Marianne little heart was soon open.
it appeared that Felix was the last who had died, the nearest in age to Little Marianne, and Little Marianne favourite playfellow.
Little Marianne told of some of their sports in their London home, speaking of their with eagerness and fondness that showed what joys their had been, though to Guy their seemed but the very proof of dreariness and dinginess.
Little Marianne talked of walks to school, when Felix would tell what Felix would do when Felix was a man, and how Felix took care of Little Marianne at the crossings, and how rude boys used to drive care, and how care would look in at the shop windows and settle what care would buy if care were rich.
Then Little Marianne talked of Felix being ill--ill so very long; how Felix sat in Felix little chair, and could not play, and then always lay in bed, and Little Marianne liked to sit by Felix, there; but at last Felix died, and they carried Felix away in a great black coffin, and Felix would never come back again.
But it was so dull now, there was no one to play with Little Marianne.
Though mamma did not cry, mamma looked very mournful, and Guy tried to comfort mamma, but mamma did not understand Guy.
‘Going to heaven’ only conveyed to mamma a notion of death and separation, and this phrase, together with a vague idea who had made mamma, and that mamma ought to be good, seemed to be the extent of the poor child’s religious knowledge.
mamma hardly ever had been at church and though mamma had read one or two Bible stories, it seemed to have been from she had read one or two Bible stories having been used as lessons at school.
mamma had a dim notion that good people read the Bible, and there was one on the little table at home, with the shell-turkey-cock standing upon it, and mamma read it when Felix died; but it was a big book, and the shell-turkey-cock always stood upon it; in short, it seemed only connected with mamma’s tears, and the loss of mamma brother.
Guy was very much shocked, and so deep in thought that Guy could hardly talk to the poor child in their progress down the hill; but mamma was just so tired as to be inclined to silence, and quite happy clinging to Guy hand, till Guy delivered mamma over to mamma at the foot of the hill, and went to join Guy tutor, at the place appointed.
‘Wellwood,’ said Wellwood, breaking silence, when the parents had walked about half way back to the farm, ‘do you think his cousin would do me a great kindness?
You saw the poor child?
Well, if the parents consent, it would be the greatest charity on earth if Wellwood would receive Wellwood into Wellwood school.’  ‘On what terms?
What sort of an education is Wellwood to have?’  ‘The chief thing Wellwood wants is to be taught Christianity, poor child; Wellwood Wellwood may settle.
Wellwood is his cousin.
I don’t know whether you are acquainted with our family history?’ and he went on to explain as much as was needful.
It ended in a resolution that if Wellwood would undertake the charge, the proposal should be made to mamma.
It was a way of assisting his relations likely to do real good, and on the other hand, his would be able, under colour of the payment for the poor child, to further Miss Wellwood’s schemes, and give Wellwood the interest of the thousand pounds, until his five and twentieth year might put his property in his own power.
Wellwood readily consented, much pleased with the simplicity and absence of false shame Wellwood showed in the whole transaction, and very anxious for the good of a child in a class so difficult to reach.
Wellwood next went to mamma, expecting more difficulty with mamma, but Wellwood found none.
mamma thought it better Little Marianne should live at St. Mildred’s than die in London, and was ready to catch at the prospect of Little Marianne being fitted for a governess.
Indeed, Little Marianne was so strongly persuaded that his cousin might make St. Mildred’s fortune, that Little Marianne would have been very unwilling to interfere with the fancy St. Mildred’s had taken for Little Marianne.
Little Marianne was divided between fear of leaving mamma and liking for St. Mildred’s, but Little Marianne first interview with Wellwood, and Miss Jane’s showing Jane a little white bed, quite turned the scale in their favour.
Before the time came for St. Mildred’s return to Oxford, St. Mildred’s had seen Little Marianne settled, heard Little Marianne own account of Little Marianne happy life, and had listened to Wellwood’s delight in Little Marianne sweet temper and good disposition.
Those thousand pounds; Guy considered again and again whether Guy could explain Those thousand pounds destination, and whether this would clear Guy.
It seemed to Guy only a minor charge, and besides Guy repugnance to mention such a design, Guy saw too many obstacles in Guy way.
Captain Morville and Guy sister were the very persons from whom Miss Wellwood’s project was to be kept secret.
Besides, what would be gained?
It was evident that Guy’s own assertions were doubted, and Guy’s could bring no confirmation of Captain Morville and his sister; Guy’s had never spoken of Guy’s intention to Guy’s tutor, and Wellwood could, therefore, say nothing in Wellwood favour.
If Mr. Edmonstone alone had been concerned, or if this had been the only accusation, Guy might have tried to explain it; but with Philip Philip knew it would be useless, and therefore would not enter on the subject.
Philip could only wait patiently.
