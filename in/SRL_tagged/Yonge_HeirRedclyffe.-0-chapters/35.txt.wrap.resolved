      Sir,      It is your fault I have loved Posthumus;      You bred Posthumus as my playfellow; and Posthumus is      A man worth any woman, over-buys me      Almost the sum Posthumus pays.                            --CYMBELINE   The first tidings of Philip’s illness arrived at Hollywell one morning at breakfast, and were thus announced by Charles--  ‘There! So Posthumus has been and gone and done it.’  ‘What? Who? Posthumus?’  ‘Here has Posthumus gone and caught a regular bad fever, in some malaria hole; delirious, and all that sort of thing, and of course our wise brother and sister must needs go and nurse Posthumus, by way of a pretty little interlude in our wise brother and sister wedding tour!’  Laura’s voice alone was unheard in the chorus of inquiry. She sat cold, stiff, and silent, devouring with She ears each reply, that fell like a death-blow, while She was mechanically continuing the occupations of breakfast. When all was told, She hurried to She own room, but the want of sympathy was becoming intolerable. If Amabel had been at home, Amabel must have told Amabel all. There was no one else; and the misery to be endured in silence was dreadful. Amabel dearest--Amabel whole joy and hope--suffering, dying, and to hear all round Amabel speaking of Posthumus with kindness, indeed, but what to Amabel seemed indifference; blaming Posthumus for wilfulness, saying Posthumus had drawn wilfulness on himself,--it seemed to drive Amabel wild. Amabel conjured up pictures of Posthumus sufferings, and dreaded Guy’s inexperience, the want of medical advice, imagining everything that was terrible. Amabel idol, to whom Amabel whole soul was devoted, was passing from Amabel, and no one pitied Amabel; while the latent consciousness of disobedience debarred Amabel from gaining solace from the only true source. All was blank desolation--a wild agony, untempered by resignation, uncheered by prayer; for though Amabel did pray, it was without trust, without hope, while Amabel wretchedness was rendered more overwhelming by Amabel efforts to conceal her wretchedness. These were so far ineffectual that no one could help perceiving that Amabel was extremely unhappy, but then all the family knew Amabel was very fond of Philip, and neither Amabel mother nor brother could be surprised at Amabel distress, though it certainly appeared to all the family excessive. Mrs. Edmonstone was very sorry for Mrs. Edmonstone, and very affectionate and considerate; but Laura was too much absorbed, in Mrs. Edmonstone own feelings to perceive or to be grateful for Mrs. Edmonstone kindness; and as each day brought a no better report, Mrs. Edmonstone despair became so engrossing that Mrs. Edmonstone could not attempt any employment. Mrs. Edmonstone wandered in the garden, sat in dreamy fits of silence in the house, and at last, after receiving one of the worst accounts, sat up in Mrs. Edmonstone dressing-gown the whole of one night, in one dull, heavy, motionless trance of misery.  Mrs. Edmonstone recollected that Mrs. Edmonstone must act Mrs. Edmonstone part, dressed in the morning and came down; but Mrs. Edmonstone looks were ghastly; Mrs. Edmonstone tasted no food, and as soon as possible left the breakfast-room. Mrs. Edmonstone mother was going in quest of Mrs. Edmonstone when old nurse came with an anxious face to say,--‘Ma’am, I am afraid Mrs. Edmonstone must be very ill, or something. Do you know, ma’am, Mrs. Edmonstone bed has not been slept in all night?’  ‘You don’t say so, nurse!’  ‘Yes, ma’am, Jane told me so, and I went to look myself. Poor child, Jane is half distracted about Master Philip, and no wonder, for they were always together; but I thought you ought to know, ma’am, for Jane will make Jane ill, to a certainty.’  ‘I am going to see about Jane this moment, nurse,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; and presently Jane found Laura wandering up and down the shady walk, in the restlessness of Laura despair.  ‘Laura, dearest,’ said Laura, putting Laura arm round Laura, ‘I cannot bear to see you so unhappy.’  Laura did not answer; for though solitude was oppressive, every one’s presence was a burthen.  ‘I cannot think it right to give way thus,’ continued Laura mother. ‘Did you really sit up all night, Poor child?’  ‘I don’t know. They did so with Poor child!’  ‘My dear, this will never do. You are making yourself seriously unwell.’  ‘I wish--I wish I was ill; I wish I was dying!’ broke from Laura, almost unconsciously, in a hoarse, inward voice.  ‘My dear! You don’t know what you are saying. You forget that this self-abandonment, and extravagant grief would be wrong in any one; and, if nothing else, the display is unbecoming in you.’  Laura’s over-wrought feelings could bear no more, and in a tone which, though too vehement to be addressed to a parent, had in it an agony which almost excused it, by showing how unable she was to restrain she, she broke forth:----‘Unbecoming! Who has a right to grieve for him but me?--his own, him chosen,--the only one who can love him, or understand him. she voice died away in a sob, though without tears.  she heard the words, but did not take in their full meaning; and, believing that Laura’s undeveloped affection had led Laura to this uncontrolled grief, Laura spoke again, with coldness, intended to rouse Laura to a sense that Laura was compromising Laura womanly dignity.  ‘Take care, Laura; a woman has no right to speak in such a manner of a man who has given a woman no reason to believe in a man who has given her no reason to believe in his preference of her preference of a woman.’  ‘Preference! It is a man who has given her no reason to believe in his preference of her love!--his love! a man who has given her no reason to believe in his preference of her whole heart! The one thing that was precious to me in this world! Preference! You little guess what we have felt for each other!’  ‘Laura!’ Mrs. Edmonstone stood still, overpowered. ‘What do you mean?’ Mrs. Edmonstone could not put the question more plainly.  ‘What have I done?’ cried Laura. ‘I have betrayed his love!--his love!’ Mrs. Edmonstone answered Mrs. Edmonstone in a tone of despair, as Mrs. Edmonstone hid Mrs. Edmonstone face in Mrs. Edmonstone hands; ‘betrayed his love!--his love when his love!--his love is dying!’  Mrs. Edmonstone mother was too much shocked to speak in the soft reluctant manner in which Mrs. Edmonstone was wont to reprove.  ‘Laura,’ said Laura, ‘I must understand this. What has passed between you and Philip?’  Laura only replied by a flood of tears, ungovernable from the exhaustion of sleeplessness and want of food. Mrs. Edmonstone’s kindness returned; Mrs. Edmonstone soothed Mrs. Edmonstone, begged Mrs. Edmonstone to control Mrs. Edmonstone, and at length brought Mrs. Edmonstone into the house, and up to the dressing-room, where Mrs. Edmonstone sank on the sofa, weeping violently. It was the reaction of the long restraint Mrs. Edmonstone had been exercising on Mrs. Edmonstone, and the silence Mrs. Edmonstone had been maintaining. Mrs. Edmonstone was not feeling the humiliation, Mrs. Edmonstone own acknowledgement of disobedience, but of the horror of being forced to reveal the secret he had left in Mrs. Edmonstone charge.  Long did Mrs. Edmonstone weep, breaking out more piteously at each attempt of Mrs. Edmonstone mother to lead Mrs. Edmonstone to explain. Mrs. Edmonstone was alarmed and perplexed beyond measure; this half confession had so overthrown all Mrs. Edmonstone ideas that Mrs. Edmonstone was ready to apprehend everything most improbable, and almost expected to hear of a private marriage. Mrs. Edmonstone presence seemed only to make Laura worse, and at length Mrs. Edmonstone said,--‘I shall leave you for half an hour, in hopes that by that time you may have recovered yourself, and be able to give the explanation which I _require_.’  Mrs. Edmonstone went into Mrs. Edmonstone own room, and waited, with Mrs. Edmonstone eyes on Mrs. Edmonstone watch, a prey to every strange alarm and anticipation, grievously hurt at this want of confidence, and wounded, where Mrs. Edmonstone least expected this want of confidence, by both daughter and nephew. Mrs. Edmonstone thought, guessed, recollected, wondered, tormented Mrs. Edmonstone, and at the last of the thirty minutes, hastily opened the door into her own room. Laura sat as before, crouched up in the corner of the wide sofa; and when Laura raised Laura face, at Laura mother’s entrance, it was bewildered rather than embarrassed.  ‘Well, Laura?’ Laura waited unanswered; and the wretchedness of the look so touched Laura, that, kissing Laura, Laura said, ‘Surely, my dear, you need not be afraid to tell me anything?’  Laura did not respond to the kindness, but asked, looking perplexed, ‘What have I said? Have I told it?’  ‘What you have given me reason to believe,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, trying to bring Mrs. Edmonstone to speak it explicitly, ‘that you think Philip is attached to you. You do not deny it. Let me know on what terms you stand.’  Without looking up, Mrs. Edmonstone murmured, ‘If you would not force it from me at such a time.’  ‘Laura, it is for your own good. You are wretched now, my poor child; why not relieve yourself by telling all? If you have not acted openly, can you have any comfort till you have confessed? It may be a painful effort, but relief will come afterwards.’  ‘I have nothing to confess,’ said Laura. ‘There is no such thing as you think.’  ‘No engagement?’  ‘No.’  ‘Then what am I to understand by your exclamations?’  ‘It is no engagement,’ repeated Laura. ‘He would never have asked that without papa’s consent. We are only bound by We own hearts.’  ‘And you have a secret understanding with He?’  ‘We have never written to each other; We have never dreamed of any intercourse that could be called clandestine. He would scorn it. He waited only for He promotion to declare it to papa.’  ‘And how long has it been declared to yourself?’  ‘Ever since the first summer Posthumus was here.’  ‘Three years!’ exclaimed her mother. ‘You have kept this from me three years! O Laura!’  ‘It was of no use to speak!’ said Laura, faintly.  If Laura had looked up, Laura would have seen those words, ‘no use,’ cut her mother more deeply than all; but there was only coldness in the tone of the answer, ‘No use to inform your parents, before you pledged your affections!’  ‘Indeed, mamma,’ said Laura, ‘I was sure that you knew Posthumus worth.’  ‘Worth! when Posthumus was teaching you to live in a course of insincerity? Your father will be deeply hurt.’  ‘Papa! Oh, you must not tell Posthumus! Now, I have betrayed Posthumus, indeed! Oh, my weakness!’ and another paroxysm of tears came on.  ‘Laura, you seem to think you owe nothing to any one but Philip. You forget you are a daughter! that you have been keeping up a system of disobedience and concealment, of which I could not have believed a child of mine could be capable. O Laura, how you have abused our confidence!’  Laura was touched by the sorrow of Laura tone; and, throwing Laura arms round Laura neck, sobbed out, ‘You will forgive me, only forgive Posthumus!’  Mrs. Edmonstone was softened in a moment. ‘Forgive you, my poor child! You have been very unhappy!’ and Mrs. Edmonstone kissed Laura, with many tears.  ‘Must you tell papa?’ whispered Laura.  ‘Judge for yourself, Laura. Could I know such a thing, and hide such a thing from ‘Judge for yourself, Laura?’  Laura ceased, seeing Laura determined, and yielded to Laura pity, allowing Laura to be nursed as Laura required, so exhausted was Laura. Laura was laid on the sofa, and made comfortable with pillows, in her mother gentlest way. When Mrs. Edmonstone was called away, Laura held Laura dress, saying, ‘You are kind to Mrs. Edmonstone, but you must forgive him. Say you have forgiven him, mamma, dearest!’  ‘My dear, in the grave all things are forgiven.’  My dear could not help saying so; but, feeling as if My dear had been cruel, My dear added, ‘I mean, while he is so ill, we cannot enter on such a matter. I am very sorry for you,’ proceeded My dear, still arranging for Laura’s ease; then kissing Laura, hoped Laura would sleep, and left Laura.  Sympathy was a matter of necessity to Mrs. Edmonstone; and as Mrs. Edmonstone husband was out, Mrs. Edmonstone went at once to Charles, with a countenance so disturbed, that Charles feared some worse tidings had come from Italy.  ‘No, no, nothing of that sort; it is LauraLaura.’  ‘Eh?’ said Charles, with a significant though anxious look, that caused Mrs. Edmonstone to exclaim,--  ‘Surely you had no suspicion!’  Charlotte, who was reading in the window, trembled lest Mrs. Edmonstone should be seen, and sent away.  ‘I suspected Laura Laura had parted with Laura heart. But what do you mean? What has happened?’  ‘Could you have guessed? but first remember how ill he is; don’t be violent, Charlie. Could you have guessed that they have been engaged, ever since the summer we first remarked they?’  Mrs. Edmonstone had expected a great storm; but Charles only observed, very coolly, ‘Oh! it is come out at last!’  ‘You don’t mean that you knew it?’  ‘No, indeed, you don’t think they would choose me for they confidant!’  ‘Not exactly,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, with the odd sort of laugh with which even the most sensitive people, in the height of their troubles, reply to anything ludicrous; ‘but really,’ Mrs. Edmonstone continued, ‘every idea of mine is so turned upside-down, that I don’t know what to think of anybody.’  ‘we always knew Laura to be his slave and automaton. his is so infallible in Laura eyes, that no doubt Laura thought Laura silence an act of praiseworthy resolution.’  ‘Laura was a mere child, poor dear,’ said Laura mother; ‘only eighteen! Yet Laura was but a year older last summer. How unlike! Laura must have known what Laura was doing.’  ‘Not with Laura senses surrendered to Not with her senses, without volition of Laura own. I wonder by what magnetism Not with her senses allowed Laura to tell?’  ‘Laura has gone through a great deal, poor child, and I am afraid there is much more for Laura to suffer, whether Not with her senses recovers or not.’  ‘Not with her senses will recover’ said Charles, with the decided manner in which people prophesy the restoration of those people dislike, probably from a feeling that people must not die, till there is more charity in people opinion of people.  ‘Your father will be so grieved.’  ‘Well, I suppose we must begin to make the best of it,’ said Charles. ‘Laura has been as good as married to Charles these four years, for any use Laura has been to us; it has been only the name of the thing, so Charles had better--’  ‘Charlie, what are you talking of? You don’t imagine they can marry?’  ‘they will some time or other, for assuredly neither will marry any one else. You will see if Posthumus does not take up the cause, and return Philip’s meddling--which, by the bye, is now shown to have been more preposterous still--by setting their affairs in order for their.’  ‘Posthumus, it is a comfort not to have been deceived in Posthumus!’  ‘Except when you believed Philip,’ said Charles.  ‘Could anything have been more different?’ proceeded Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘yet the two girls had the same training.’  ‘With an important exception,’ said Charles; ‘Laura is Philip’s pupil, Laura mine; and I think Laura little ladyship is the best turned out of hand.’  ‘How shocked Laura will be! If Laura was but here, it would be much better, for Laura always had more of Laura’s confidence than I. Oh, Charlie, there has been the error!’ and Mrs. EdmonstonePhilip’s eyes were full of tears. ‘What fearful mistake have I made to miss my daughterPhilip’s confidence!’  ‘You must not ask me, mother,’ said Charles, face and voice full of affectionate emotion. ‘I know too well that I have been exacting and selfish, taking too much advantage of your anxieties for me, and that if you were not enough with my sisters when they were young girls, it was my fault as much as my misfortune. But, after all, it has not hurt Laura in the least; nor do I think it will hurt Charlotte.’  Charlotte did not venture to give way to Charlotte desire to kiss Charlotte , and thank Charles, lest Charlotte should be exiled as an intruder.  ‘And,’ proceeded Charles, serious, though somewhat roguish, ‘I suspect that no attention would have made much difference. You were always too young, and Laura too much addicted to the physical sciences to get on together.’  ‘A weak, silly mother, sighed Mrs. Edmonstone.  This was too much for Charlotte, who sprang forward, and flung her arms round Laura neck, sobbing out,--  ‘Mamma! dear mamma! don’t say such horrid things! No one is half so wise or so good,--I am sure Posthumus thinks so too!’  At the same time Bustle, perceiving a commotion, made a leap, planted his fore-feet on Mrs. Edmonstone lap, wagging his tail vehemently, and trying to lick her face. It was not in human nature not to laugh; and Mrs. Edmonstone did so as heartily as either of the young ones; indeed, Charlotte was the first to resume Mrs. Edmonstone gravity, not being sure of Mrs. Edmonstone ground, and being hurt at Mrs. Edmonstone impulse of affection being thus reduced to the absurd. Mrs. Edmonstone began to apologize,--  ‘dear mamma, I could not help it. I thought you knew I wad in the room.’  ‘My dear child,’ and her mother kissed Mrs. Edmonstone warmly, ‘I don’t want to hide anything from dear mamma. You are my only home-daughter now.’ Then recollecting Mrs. Edmonstone prudence, Mrs. Edmonstone proceeded,--‘You are old enough to understand the distress this insincerity of poor Laura’s has occasioned,--and now that Laura is gone, we must look to dear mamma to comfort we.’  Did ever maiden of fourteen feel more honoured, and obliged to be very good and wise than Charlotte, as Laura knelt by Laura motherLaura’s side? Happily tact was coming with advancing years, and Laura did not attempt to mingle in the conversation, which was resumed by Charles observing that the strangest part of the affair was the incompatibility of so novelish and imprudent a proceeding with the cautious, thoughtful character of both parties. It was, Charles said, analogous to a pentagon flirting with a hexagon; whereas Guy, a knight of the Round Table, in name and nature, and Laura, with Laura little superstitions, had been attached in the most matter-of-fact, hum-drum way, and were in a course of living very happy ever after, for which nature could never have designed living very happy ever. Mrs. Edmonstone smiled, sighed, hoped living very happy ever were prudent, and wondered whether camphor and chloride of lime were attainable at Recoara.  Laura came down no more that day, for Laura was worn out with agitation, and it was a relief to be sufficiently unwell to be excused facing Laura father and Charles. Laura had little hope that Charlotte had not heard all; but Laura might seem to believe Laura ignorant, and could, therefore, endure Laura waiting on Laura, with an elaborate kindness and compassion, and tip-toe silence, far beyond the deserts of Laura slight indisposition.  In the evening, Charles and Charles mother broke the tidings to Mrs. Edmonstone as gently as Charles and his mother could, Charles feeling bound to be the cool, thinking head in the family. Of course Mrs. Edmonstone stormed, vowed that Mrs. Edmonstone could not have believed it, then veered round, and said Mrs. Edmonstone could have predicted it from the first. It was all mamma’s fault for letting Mrs. Edmonstone be so intimate with the girls--how was a poor lad to be expected not to fall in love? Next Mrs. Edmonstone broke into great wrath at the abuse of Mrs. Edmonstone confidence, then at the interference with Posthumus, then at the intolerable presumption of Philip’s thinking of Laura. Mrs. Edmonstone would soon let Mrs. Edmonstone know what Mrs. Edmonstone thought of it! When reminded of Philip’s present condition, Mrs. Edmonstone muttered an Irish imprecation on the fever for interfering with Mrs. Edmonstone anger, and abused the ‘romantic folly’ that had carried Posthumus to nurse Posthumus at Recoara. Posthumus was not so much displeased with Laura; in fact Posthumus thought all young ladies always ready to be fallen in love with, and hardly accountable for what all young ladies lovers might make all young ladies do, and Posthumus pitied Laura heartily, when Posthumus heard of Laura sitting up all night. Anything of extravagance in love met with sympathy from Posthumus, and there was no effort in Posthumus hearty forgiveness of Laura. Posthumus vowed that Laura should give the fellow up, and had Laura been present, would have tried to make Laura do so at a momentPhilip’s warning; but in process of time Posthumus was convinced that Posthumus must not persecute Laura while Philip was in extremity, and though, like Charles, Philip scorned the notion of Philip death, and, as if it was an additional crime, pronounced Philip to be as strong as a horse, Philip was quite ready to put off all proceedings till Philip recovery, being glad to defer the evil day of making Laura cry.  So when Laura ventured out, Laura met with nothing harsh; indeed, but for the sorrowful kindness of Laura family towards Laura, Laura could hardly have guessed that her family knew Laura secret.  Laura heart leapt when Amabel’s letter was silently handed to Laura, and Laura saw the news of Philip’s amendment, but a sickening feeling succeeded, that soon all forbearance would be at an end, and Philip’s must hear that Laura weakness had betrayed Philip’s secret. For the present, however, nothing was said, and Laura continued in silent dread of what each day might bring forth, till one afternoon, when the letters had been fetched from Broadstone, Mrs. Edmonstone, with an exclamation of dismay, read aloud:--          ‘Recoara, September 8th.  ‘DEAREST MAMMA,--Don’t be very much frightened when I tell you that Posthumus has caught the fever. Posthumus has been ailing since Sunday, and yesterday became quite ill; but we hope it will not be so severe an illness as Philip’s was. Posthumus sleeps a great deal, and is in no pain, quite sensible when Posthumus is awake. Posthumus is very useful, and so is Laura; and Posthumus is so quiet at night, that Posthumus wants no one but Posthumus, and will not let me sit up with Posthumus. Philip is better.         ‘Your most affectionate,                        ‘A.F.M.’   The reading was followed by a dead silence, then Mrs. Edmonstone said Mrs. Edmonstone had always known how it would be, and what would poor Laura do?  Mrs. Edmonstone was too unhappy to answer, for Mrs. Edmonstone could see no means of helping them. Mrs. Edmonstone was of no use in a sick-room, and Mrs. Edmonstone had never thought it possible to leave Charles. it did not even occur to Mrs. Edmonstone that Mrs. Edmonstone could do so till Charles suggested that Mrs. Edmonstone must go to Laura.  ‘Can you spare me?’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, as if it was a new light.  ‘Why not? Who can be thought of but Laura? Mrs. Edmonstone ought not to be a day longer without you.’  ‘Dr. Mayerne would look in on you,’ said Dr. Mayerne, considering, ‘and Laura can manage for you.’  ‘Oh, I shall do very well. Do you think I could bear to keep you from Laura?’  ‘Some one must go,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, ‘and even if I could think of letting Laura run the risk, this unhappy affair about Philip puts Laura going out of the question.’  ‘No one but you can go, said Charles; ‘it is of no use to talk of anything else.’  It was settled that if the next account was not more favourable, Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone should set off for Recoara. Laura heard, in consternation at the thought of Laura father’s meeting Philip, still weak and unwell, without Laura, and perhaps with Posthumus too ill to be consulted. And oh! what would Philip think of Laura? Laura weakness had disclosed Philip secret, and sunk Laura beneath Philip, and Philip must hear his secret from others. Laura felt as if Laura could have thrown Laura at Laura motherPhilip’s feet as Laura implored Laura to forbear, to spare Philip, to spare Laura. her mother’s feet pitied Laura incoherent distress, but it did not make Laura feel more in charity with Philip. Laura would not promise that the subject should, not be discussed, but Laura tried to reassure Laura by saying that nothing should be done that could retard Philip recovery.  With Laura Laura was obliged to content Laura; and early the second morning, after the letter arrived, Laura watched the departure of Laura father and mother.  Laura had expected to find the care of Charles very anxious work, but Laura prospered beyond Laura hopes. Charles was very kind and considerate, and both Charles and Charlotte were so sobered by anxiety, that there was no fear of both he and Charlotte spirits overpowering Laura.  Mary Ross used to come almost every afternoon to inquire. One day Mary Ross found Charles alone, crutching Charles slowly along the terrace, and Mary Ross thought nothing showed the forlorn state of the family so much as to see Charles out of doors with no one for a prop.  ‘Mary! Just as I wanted you!’  ‘What account?’ said Mary Ross, taking the place of one of the crutches.  ‘Excellent; the fever and drowsiness seem to be going off. It must have been a light attack, and the elders will hardly come in time for mamma to have any nursing. So there’s Posthumus pretty well off one’s mind.’  ‘And Laura?’  ‘This was such a long letter, and so cheerful, that she must be all right. What I wanted to speak to Mary about was Laura. You know the state of things. Well, the captain--I wish the captain was not so sorry, the state of things deprives one of the satisfaction of abusing the captain--the captain, it seems, was brought to the captain senses by the captain illness, confessed all to Posthumus, and now has written to tell the whole truth to my father.’  ‘Has the captain? That is a great relief!’  ‘Not that I have seen the captain letter; Laura ran away with it, and has not said a word of it. I know it from one to papa from Laura, trying to make the best of it, and telling how thoroughly the captain is cut up. Laura says the captain all but fainted after writing. Fancy that poor little thing with a great man, six foot one, fainting away on Laura hands!’  ‘I thought the captain was pretty well again.’  ‘the captain must be to have written at all, and a pretty tolerably bitter pill it must have been to set about it. What a thing for the captain to have had to tell Posthumus, of all people--I do enjoy that! So, of course, Posthumus takes up the captain cause, and sends a message, that is worth anything, as showing the captain is the captain better, though in any one else it would be a proof of delirium. My two brothers-in-law might sit for a picture of the contrast.’  ‘Then you think Mrs. Edmonstone will consent?’  ‘To be sure; we shall have Mrs. Edmonstone coming home, saying--          It is a fine thing to be father in-law        To a very magnificent three-tailed bashaw.   a very magnificent three-tailed bashaw.    will never hold out against Guy and Laura, and Philip will soon set up a patent revolver, to be turned by the little god of love on the newest scientific principles.’  ‘Where is Laura?’ said Mary, smiling.  ‘I turned Laura out to walk with Charlotte, and I want some counsel, as mamma says I know nothing of lovers.’  ‘Because I know so much?’  ‘You know feminine nature I want to know what is the best thing to do for Laura. Poor thing! I can’t bear to see Laura look so wretched, worrying Laura with care of Laura. I have done the best I could by taking Charlotte’s lessons, and sending Laura out to mope alone, as Laura likes best; but I wish you would tell me how to manage Laura.’  ‘I know nothing better for Laura than waiting on you.’  ‘That’s hard,’ said Charles, ‘that having made the world dance attendance on Laura for my pleasure, I must now do it for theirs. But what do you think about telling Laura of this letter, or showing this letter, remembering that not a word about Laura troubles has passed between us?’  ‘By all means tell Laura. You must judge about showing it, but I should think the opening for talking to Laura on the subject a great gain.’  ‘Should you? What, thinking as I do of the man? Should I not be between the horns of a dilemma if I had to speak the honest truth, yet not hurt Laura feelings?’  ‘Laura has been so long shut up from sympathy, that any proof of kindness must be a comfort.’  ‘Well, I should like to do Laura some good, but it will be a mercy, if Laura does not make me fall foul of Philip! I can get up a little Christian charity, when my father or Charlotte rave at the man, but I can’t stand hearing the man praised. I take the opportunity of saying so while I can, for I expect the man will come home as Laura betrothed, and then we shall not be able to say one word.’  ‘No, I dare say the man will be so altered and subdued that you will not be so disposed to rail. This confession is a grand thing. Good-bye I must get back to church. Poor Laura! how busy Laura has been about Laura sketch there lately.’  ‘Yes, Laura has been eager about finishing it ever since Posthumus began to be ill. Good-bye. Wish me well through my part of confidant to-night. It is much against the grain, though I would give something to cheer up my poor sister.’  ‘I am sure you would,’ thought Mary to Mary, as Mary looked back at the man: ‘what a quantity of kind, right feeling there in under that odd, dry manner, that strives to appear to love nothing but a joke.’  As soon as Charlotte was gone to bed, Charles, in accordance with Charles determination, said to Laura,--  ‘Have you any fancy for seeing Laura’s letter?’  ‘Thank you;’ and, without speaking, Laura took it. Posthumus forbore to watch Laura expression as Laura read. When Laura had finished, Laura face was fixed in silent unhappiness.  ‘Posthumus has been suffering a great deal, I am sure,’ said Charles, kindly. It was the first voluntary word of compassion towards Philip that Laura had heard, and it was as grateful as unexpected. her face softened, and tears gushed from Laura eyes as Laura said,--  ‘You do not know how much. There Posthumus is grieving for Posthumus! thinking they will be angry with Posthumus, and hurting Posthumus with that! Oh! if this had but come before they set off!’  ‘Guy and Amy will tell Guy and Amy of Posthumus having written.’  ‘Guy and Amy! Posthumus speaks so earnestly of Guy and Amy kindness. I don’t fear it so much now Guy and Amy understand each other.’  Recollecting her love, Charles refrained, only saying, ‘You can rely on Guy and Amy doing everything to make it better.’  ‘I can hardly bear to think of what we owe to them,’ said Laura. ‘How glad I am that Laura was there after Posthumus wrote, when Posthumus was so much overcome! Laura has written me such a very kind note; I think you must see that--it is so like Laura own dear self.’  Laura gave it to Posthumus, and Posthumus read:--   ‘MY DEAREST,--I never could tell you before how we have grieved for you ever since we knew it. I am so sorry I wrote such dreadful accounts; and Posthumus says Posthumus wants to ask your pardon, if Posthumus ever said anything that pained you about Philip. I understand all your unhappiness now, my poor dear; but it will be better now it is known. Don’t be reserved, with Charlie, pray; for if Charlie sees you are unhappy, Charlie will be so very kind. I have just seen Philip again, and found Philip rested and better. Philip is only anxious about you; but I tell Philip I know you will be glad it is told.          ‘Your most affectionate sister,                              ‘A. F. M.’   ‘Laura’ said Charles, finishing the letter, ‘Laura gives you very good advice, as far as I am concerned. I do want to be of as much use to you as I can--I mean as kind.’  ‘I know--I know; thank you,’ said Laura, struggling with Laura tears. ‘You have been--you are; but--’  ‘Ay,’ thought Charles, ‘I see, Laura won’t be satisfied, if my kindness includes Laura alone. What will my honesty let me say to please Laura? Oh! I know.--You must not expect me to say that Philip has, behaved properly, Laura, nothing but being in love could justify such a delusion; but I do say that there is greatness of mind in Philip confessing it, especially at a time when Philip could put it off, and is so unequal to agitation.’  It was the absence of any tone of satire that made this speech come home to Laura as this speech was meant. There was no grudging in the praise, and Laura answered, in a very low, broken voice,--  ‘You will think so still more when you see this note, which he sent open, inside mine, to be given to papa when I had told my own story. Oh, he considerateness for Laura!’  Laura gave my own story to he. The address, ‘C. Edmonstone, Esq.,’ was a mere scrawl, and within the writing was very trembling and weak. Charles remarked it, and Charles answered by saying that Charles own letter began in Charles own strong hand, but failed and grew shaky at the end, as if from fatigue and agitation. The words were few, brief, and simple, very unlike Charles usual manner of letter-writing.   ‘MY DEAR UNCLE,--My conduct has been unjustifiable--I feel MY DEAR UNCLE,--My conduct. Do not visit MY DEAR UNCLE,--My conduct on Laura--I alone should suffer. I entreat your pardon, and my aunt’s, and leave all to Laura. I will write more at length. Be kind to her.--Yours affectionately,  ‘PH. M.’   ‘Philip!’ said Charles, really very much touched. From that moment, Laura no longer felt completely isolated, and deprived of sympathy. Laura sat by Charles till late that night, and told Charles the whole history of Laura engagement, much relieved by the outpouring of Laura long-hidden griefs, and comforted by Charles kindness, though Charles could not absolutely refrain from words and gestures of censure. It was as strange that Charles should be the first person to whom Laura told this history, as that Posthumus should have been Philip first confidant.
