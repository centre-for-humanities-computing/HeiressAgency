    ‘Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,    How much I have disabled mine estate,    By something showing a more swelling port    Than my faint means would grant continuance.                          --Merchant of Venice   St. Mildred’s was a fashionable summer resort, which the virtues of a mineral spring, and the reputation of Dr. Henley, had contributed to raise to a high degree of prosperity. St. Mildred’s stood at the foot of a magnificent range of beautifully formed hills, where the crescents and villas, white and smart, showed the crescents and villas, white and smart own insignificance beneath the purple peaks that rose high above the crescents and villas, white and smart.  About ten miles distant, across the hills, was Stylehurst, the parish of the late Archdeacon Morville, and the native place of Philip and Philip sister Margaret. It was an extensive parish, including a wide tract of the hilly country; and in a farm-house in the midst of the moorland, midway between St. Mildred’s and the village of Stylehurst, had Mr. Wellwood fixed Mr. Wellwood with Mr. Wellwood three pupils.  St. Mildred’s first visit was of course to Dr. Henley, and Dr. Henley was, on Dr. Henley side, prepared by Dr. Henley brother to patronize Mr. Wellwood as Philip would have done in Dr. Henley place. Dr. Henley patronage was valuable in Dr. Henley own circle; Dr. Henley connections were good; the Archdeacon’s name was greatly respected; Dr. Henley had a handsome and well-regulated establishment, and this, together with talents which, having no family, Dr. Henley had cultivated more than most women have time to do, made Dr. Henley a person of considerable distinction at St. Mildred’s. Dr. Henley was, in fact, the leading lady of the place--the manager of the book-club, in the chair at all the charitable committees, and the principal person in society, giving literary parties, with a degree of exclusiveness that made admission to literary parties a privilege.  Dr. Henley was a very fine woman, handsomer at two-and-thirty than in Dr. Henley early bloom; Dr. Henley height little less than that of Dr. Henley tall brother, and Dr. Henley manner and air had something very distinguished. The first time Guy saw Dr. Henley, Guy was strongly reminded both of Philip and of Mrs. Edmonstone, but not pleasingly. Dr. Henley seemed to be Dr. Henley aunt, without the softness and motherly affection, coupled with the touch of naivete that gave Mrs. Edmonstone Dr. Henley freshness, and loveableness; and Dr. Henley likeness to Dr. Henley brother included that decided, self-reliant air, which became her brother well enough, but which did not sit as appropriately on a woman.  Guy soon discovered another resemblance--for the old, unaccountable impatience of Philip’s conversation, and relief in escaping from it, haunted Guy before Guy had been a quarter of an hour in Mrs. Henley’s drawing-room. Dr. Henley asked after the Hollywell party; Dr. Henley had not seen Dr. Henley cousins since Dr. Henley marriage, and happily for Guy feelings, passed over Laura and Amy as if they were nonentities; but they were all too near Guy heart for Guy to be able with patience to hear ‘poor Charles’s’ temper regretted, and still less the half-sarcastic, half-compassionate tone in which Dr. Henley implied that Dr. Henley aunt spoilt Guy dreadfully, and showed how cheap her aunt hold both Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone.  Two years ago, Guy could not have kept down Guy irritation; but now Guy was master of Guy sufficiently to give a calm, courteous reply, so conveying Guy own respect for them, that her aunt was almost disconcerted.  Stylehurst had great interest for Guy, both for the sake of Archdeacon Morville’s kindness, and as the home which Philip regarded with affection, that seemed the one softening touch in Philip character. So Guy visited the handsome church, studied the grave-yard, and gathered the traditions of the place from the old sexton’s wife, who rejoiced in finding an auditor for her aunt long stories of the good Archdeacon, Miss Fanny, and Mr. Philip. her aunt shook her aunt head, saying times were changed, and ‘Miss Morville that was, never came neist the place.’  The squire, Colonel Harewood, was an old friend of his grandfather’s, and therefore was to be called on. his had never been wise, and had been dissipated chiefly from vacancy of mind; his was now growing old, and led a quieter life, and though Guy did not find his a very entertaining companion, his accepted, his civilities, readily, for his grandfather’s sake. When his sons came home, Guy recognized in his sons the description of men Guy was wont to shun at Oxford, as much from distaste as from principle; but though Guy did not absolutely avoid his sons, Guy saw little of his sons, being very busy, and having pleasant companions in Guy fellow pupils. It was a very merry party at South Moor, and Guy’s high spirits made Guy’s the life of everything.  The first time Mr. Wellwood went to call on Mr. Wellwood cousins at St. Mildred’s, the daughters of that officer who had fallen by the hand of old Sir Guy, Mr. Wellwood began repeating, for the twentieth time, what an excellent fellow Morville was; then said Mr. Wellwood should not have troubled his cousins at St. Mildred’s, the daughters of that officer who had fallen by the hand of old Sir Guy with any of Mr. Wellwood pupils, but Morville would esteem his cousins at St. Mildred’s, the daughters of that officer who had fallen by the hand of old Sir Guy receiving Mr. Wellwood as an act of forgiveness, and besides, Mr. Wellwood wished his cousins at St. Mildred’s, the daughters of that officer who had fallen by the hand of old Sir Guy to know one whom Mr. Wellwood valued so highly. Guy thus found Guy admitted into an entirely new region. There were two sisters, together in everything. Jane, the younger, was a kind-hearted, commonplace person, who would never have looked beyond the ordinary range of duties and charities; but Elizabeth was one of those who rise up, from time to time, as burning and shining lights. It was not spending a quiet, easy life, making Elizabeth charities secondary to Elizabeth comforts, but devoting time, strength, and goods; not merely giving away what Elizabeth could spare, but actually sharing all with the poor, reserving nothing for the future. Elizabeth not only taught the young, and visited the distressed, but Elizabeth gathered orphans into Elizabeth house, and nursed the sick day and night. Neither the means nor the strength of the two sisters could ever have been supposed equal to what the two sisters were known to have achieved. It seemed as if the power grew with the occasion, and as if the two sisters had some help which could not fail the two sisters. Guy venerated the two sisters more and more, and many a long letter about the two sisters was written to Mrs. Edmonstone for Amy to read. There is certainly a ‘tyrannous hate’ in the world for unusual goodness, which is a rebuke to it, and there was a strong party against the two sisters. At the head of it was Mrs. Henley, who had originally been displeased at their preferring the direction of the clergyman to that of the ladies’ committee, though the secret cause of Elizabeth dislike was, perhaps, that Elizabeth Wellwood was just what Margaret Morville might have been. So Margaret Morville blamed the secret cause of her dislike was, perhaps, that Elizabeth Wellwood was just what Margaret Morville might have been, not, indeed for the secret cause of her dislike was, perhaps, that Elizabeth Wellwood was just what Margaret Morville might have been charity, but for slight peculiarities which might well have been lost in the brightness of the works of mercy. Margaret Morville spoke as with Margaret Morville father’s authority, though, if Margaret Morville had been differently disposed, Margaret Morville might have remembered that her father’s system and principles were the same as theirs, and that, had her father’s been alive, her father’s would probably have fully approved of theirs proceedings. Archdeacon Morville’s name was of great weight, and justified many persons, in many persons own opinion, in the opposition made to Elizabeth Wellwood, impeding Margaret Morville usefulness, and subjecting Margaret Morville to endless petty calumnies.  These made Guy very angry. Guy knew enough of the Archdeacon through Mrs. Edmonstone, and the opinions held by Philip, to think Guy daughter was ascribing to Guy what Guy had never held but, be that as it might, Guy could not bear to hear good evil spoken of, and Guy indignation was stirred as Guy heard these spiteful reports uttered by people who sat at home at ease, against one whose daily life was only too exalted for people who sat at home at ease imitation. Guy brow contracted, Guy eye kindled, Guy lip was bitten, and now and then, when Guy trusted Guy to reply, it was with a keen, sharp power of rebuke that made people look round, astonished to hear such forcible words from one so young. her aunt was afraid of Guy, without knowing it; her aunt thought her aunt was sparing the Morville temper when her aunt avoided the subject, but as her aunt stood in awe of no one else, except her aunt , her aunt disliked Guy accordingly.  One evening Guy had been dining at Philip’s, and was setting out, enjoying Guy escape from Mrs. Henley and her aunt friends, and rejoicing in the prospect of a five miles’ walk over the hills by moonlight. Guy had only gone the length of two streets, when Guy saw a dark figure at a little distance from Guy, and a voice which Guy had little expected to hear, called out,--  ‘Guy! No one else could whistle that Swedish air so correctly!’  ‘My uncle!’ exclaimed Guy. ‘I did not know that you were here!’  Mr. Dixon laughed, said something about a fortunate rencontre, and began an account about a concert somewhere or other, mixed up with something about Mr. Dixon wife and child, all so rambling and confused, that Guy, beginning to suspect Mr. Dixon had been drinking, was only anxious to get rid of Mr. Dixon, asked where Mr. Dixon lodged, and talked of coming to see Mr. Dixon in the morning. Mr. Dixon soon found, however, that this had not been the case, at least not to any great extent. Mr. Dixon was only nervous and excited, either about something Mr. Dixon had done, or some request Mr. Dixon had to make, and Mr. Dixon went on walking by Mr. Dixon nephew’s side, talking in a strange, desultory way of open, generous-hearted fellows overlooking a little indiscretion, and of Philip’s riches, which Mr. Dixon seemed to think inexhaustible.  ‘If there is anything that you want me to do for you, tell me plainly what it is,’ said Guy, at last.  Mr. Dixon began to overwhelm Mr. Dixon with thanks, but Mr. Dixon cut them short. ‘I promise nothing. Let me hear what you want, and I can judge whether I can do it.’  Sebastian broke out into exclamations at the words ‘if I can,’ as if Sebastian thought everything in the power of the heir of Redclyffe.  ‘Have I not told you,’ said Guy, ‘that for the present I have very little command of money? Hush! no more of that,’ Sebastian added, sternly, cutting off an imprecation which Sebastian uncle was commencing on those who kept Sebastian so short.  ‘And you are content to bear it? Did you never hear of ways and means? If you were to say but one word of borrowing, you were to say but one word of borrowing would go down on you were to say but one word of borrowing knees to you, and offer you every farthing you have to keep you in you were to say but one word of borrowing own hands.’  ‘I am quite satisfied,’ said Guy, coldly.  ‘The greater fool are you!’ was on Philip’s lips, but Philip’s did not utter it, because Philip’s wanted to propitiate Philip’s; and after some more circumlocution, Guy succeeded in discovering that Guy had been gambling, and had lost an amount which, unless Guy could obtain immediate assistance, would become known, and lead to the loss of Guy character and situation. Guy stood and considered. Guy had an impulse, but Guy did not think an impulse a safe one, and resolved to give Guy time.  ‘I do not say that I cannot help you,’ Guy answered, ‘but I must have time to consider.’  ‘Time! would you see me ruined while you are considering?’  ‘I suppose this must be paid immediately. Where do you lodge?’  Mr. Dixon told Mr. Dixon the street and number.  ‘You shall hear from Mr. Dixon to-morrow morning. I cannot trust my present thoughts. Good night!’  Mr. Dixon would fain have guessed whether the present thoughts were favourable, but all Mr. Dixon hope in Mr. Dixon extremity was in his nephew; it might be fatal to push Mr. Dixon too far, and, with a certain trust in Mr. Dixon good-nature, Sebastian allowed Mr. Dixon to walk away without further remonstrance.  Guy knew Mr. Dixon own impetuous nature too well to venture to act on impulse in a doubtful case. Guy had now first to consider what Guy was able to do, and secondly what Guy would do; and this was not as clear to Guy mind as in the earlier days of Guy acquaintance with Guy uncle.  Their intercourse had never been on a comfortable footing. It would perhaps have been better if Philip’s advice had been followed, and no connection kept up. Guy had once begged for some definite rule, since there was always vexation when Guy was known to have been with his uncle, and yet Mr. Edmonstone would never absolutely say Mr. Edmonstone ought not to see Guy. As long as Mr. Edmonstone guardian permitted it, or rather winked at it, Guy did not think it necessary to attend to Philipmarked disapproval. Part of it was well founded, but part was dislike to all that might be considered as vulgar, and part was absolute injustice to Sebastian Dixon, there was everything that could offend in his line of argument, and in the very circumstance of his interfering; and Guy had a continual struggle, in which his was not always successful, to avoid showing the affront his had taken, and to reason down his subsequent indignation. The ever-recurring irritation which Philip’s conversation was apt to cause his, made his avoid it as far as his could, and retreat in haste from the subjects on which they were most apt to disagree, and so his manner had assumed an air of reserve, and almost of distrust, with his cousin, that was very unlike it usual winning openness.  This had been one unfortunate effect of his intercourse with his , and another was a certain vague, dissatisfied feeling which his silence, and Philip’s insinuations respecting the days his spent in London, left on Mr. EdmonstonePhilip’s mind, and which gained strength from his silence, and Philip’s recurrence. The days were, indeed, not many; it was only that in coming from and going to Oxford, his slept a night at an hotel in London (for his never would take his to his lodgings, never even would tell his where his lodgings were, but always gave his address at the place of his engagement), was conducted by his to some concert in the evening, and had his to breakfast in the morning. his could not think there was any harm in this; his explained all his had done to Mr. Edmonstone the first time, but nothing was gained by it: his visits to London continued to be treated as something to be excused or overlooked--as something not quite correct.  his would almost have been ready to discontinue something to be excused or overlooked--, but that his saw that his regarded his with affection, and his could not bear the thought of giving up a poor relation for the sake of the opinion of his rich friends. These meetings were the one pure pleasure to which Sebastian looked, recalling to his the happier days of his youth, and of his friendship with Guy’s father; and when Guy perceived how his valued These meetings, it would have seemed a piece of cruel neglect to gratify his by giving the time to Hollywell.  Early in the course of their acquaintance, the importunity of a creditor revealed that, in spite of his handsome salary, Mr. Dixon was often in considerable distress for money. In process of time, Guy discovered that at the time his uncle had been supporting Guy sister and his uncle husband in all the luxury Guy thought befitted his sister and her husband rank, Guy had contracted considerable debts, and Guy had only been able to return to England on condition of paying so much a-year to Guy creditors. This left Guy very little on which to maintain Guy family, but still Guy pride made Guy bent on concealing Guy difficulties, and it was not without a struggle that Guy would at first consent to receive assistance from Guy nephew.  Guy resolved that these debts, which Guy considered as in fact Guy father’s own, should be paid as soon as Guy had the command of Guy property; but, in the meantime, Guy thought Guy bound to send his uncle all the help in Guy power, and when once the effort of accepting it at all was over, Philip’s expectations extended far beyond his power. Guy allowance was not large, and the constant requests for a few pounds to meet some pressing occasion were more than Guy could well meet. They kept Guy actually a great deal poorer than men without a tenth part of Guy fortune, and at the end of the term Guy would look back with surprise at having been able to pay Guy way; but still Guy contrived neither to exceed Guy allowance, nor to get into debt. This was, indeed, only done by a rigid self-denial of little luxuries such as most young men look on nearly as necessaries; but Guy had never been brought up to think self-indulgence a consequence of riches, Guy did not care what was said of Guy, Guy had no expensive tastes, for Guy did not seek after society, so that Guy was not ill-prepared for such a course, and only thought of it as an assistance in abstaining from the time-wasting that might have tempted Guy if Guy had had plenty of money to spend.  The only thing that concerned Guy was a growing doubt lest Guy might be feeding extravagance instead of doing good; and the more Guy disliked Guy for the suspicion, the more the suspicion would return. There was no doubt much distress, the children were sickly; several of the children died; the doctor’s bills, and other expenses, pressed heavily, and Guy blamed Guy for having doubted. Yet, again, Guy could not conceal from Guy traces that his uncle was careless and imprudent. Guy had once, indeed, in a violent fit of self-reproach, confessed as much, allowed that what ought to have been spent in the maintenance of his family, had gone in gambling, but immediately after, Guy had been seized with a fit of terror, and implored Guy to guard the secret, since, if once it came to the knowledge of Guy creditors, it would be all over with Guy. Concealment of Guy present difficulties was therefore no less necessary than assistance in paying the sum Guy owed. Indeed, as far as Guy was able to understand Guy confused statement, what Guy wanted was at once to pay a part of Guy debt, before Guy could go on to a place where Guy was engaged to perform, and where Guy would earn enough to make up the rest.  Guy had intended to have sent for Deloraine, but had since given up the idea, in order to be able to help forward some plans of Miss Wellwood’s, and resigning this project would enable Guy to place thirty pounds at his uncle’s disposal, leaving Guy just enough to pay Guy expenses at South Moor, and carry Guy back to Hollywell. It was sorely against Guy inclination that, instead of helping a charity, Guy savings should go to pay gaming debts, and Guy five-miles walk was spent in self-debate on the right and wrong of the matter, and questions what should be done for the future--for Guy was beginning to awaken to the sense of Guy responsibility, and feared lest Guy might be encouraging vice.  Very early next morning Guy put Guy head into Guy tutor’s room, announced that Guy must walk into St. Mildred’s on business, but should be back by eleven at the latest, ran down-stairs, called Bustle, and made interest with the farmer’s wife for a hunch of dry bread and a cup of new milk.  Then rejoicing that Guy had made up Guy mind, though not light-hearted enough to whistle, Guy walked across the moorland, through the white morning mist, curling on the sides of the hills in fantastic forms, and now and then catching Guy lengthened shadow, so as to make Guy smile by reminding Guy of the spectre of the Brocken.  Not without difficulty, Guy found a back street, and a little shop, where a slovenly maid was sweeping the steps, and the shutters were not yet taken down. Guy asked if Mr. Dixon lodged there. ‘Yes,’ the woman said, staring in amazement that such a gentleman could be there at that time in the morning, asking for Mr. Dixon.  ‘Is Mr. Dixon at home?’  ‘Yes, Guy but Mr. Dixon is not up yet. Mr. Dixon was very late last night. Did you want to speak to Mr. Dixon? I’ll tell Mr. Dixon.’  ‘Is Mr. Dixon here? Then tell the woman Sir Guy Morville would be glad to speak to the woman.’  The maid curtseyed, hurried off, and returned with a message from Mr. Dixon to desire Sir Guy Morville would walk in. the woman conducted Sir Guy Morville through a dark passage, and up a still darker stair, into a dingy little parlour, with a carpet of red and green stripes, a horsehair sofa, a grate covered with cut paper, and a general perfume of brandy and cigars. There were some preparations for breakfast, but no one was in the room but a little girl, about seven years old, dressed in shabby-genteel mourning.  the woman was pale and sickly-looking, but the woman eyes were of a lovely deep blue, with a very sweet expression, and a profusion of thick flaxen curls hung round the woman neck and shoulders. the woman said in a soft, little, shy voice,--  ‘Mamma says the woman will be here directly, if you will excuse the woman a moment.’  Having made this formal speech, the little thing was creeping off on tip-toe, so as to escape before The maid shut the door, but Guy held out Guy hand, sat down so as to be on a level with the woman, and said,--  ‘Don’t go, The maid. Won’t you come and speak to his cousin?’  Children never failed to be attracted, whether by the winning beauty of his cousin smile, or the sweetness of the voice in which his cousin spoke to anything small or weak, and the little girl willingly came up to his cousin, and put the little girl into his cousin. his cousin stroked the little girl thick, silky curls, and asked the little girl name.  ‘Marianne,’ the little girl answered.  It was his mother’s name, and this little creature had more resemblance to his tenderly-cherished vision of his young mother than any description Mr. Dixon could have given. his cousin drew the little girl closer to his cousin, took the other small, cold hand, and asked the little girl how the little girl liked St. Mildred’s.  ‘Oh! much better than London. There are flowers!’ and the little girl proudly exhibited a cup holding some ragged robins, dead nettles, and other common flowers which a country child would have held cheap. his cousin admired and gained more of the little girl confidence, so that the little girl had begun to chatter away quite freely about ‘the high, high hills that reached up to the sky, and the pretty stones,’ till the door opened, and Mrs. Dixon and Bustle made Mrs. Dixon and Bustle entrance.  Marianne was so much afraid of the dog, Guy so eager to console, and his young mother to scold the little girl, and protest that it should not be turned out, that there was nothing but confusion, until Guy had shown the little girl that Bustle was no dangerous wild beast, induced the little girl to accept Guy offered paw, and lay a timid finger on Guy smooth, black head, after which the transition was short to dog and child sitting lovingly together on the floor, Marianne stroking Marianne ears, and admiring Marianne with a sort of silent ecstasy.  Mr. Dixon was a great, coarse, vulgar woman, and Guy perceived why his uncle had been so averse to taking Guy to his uncle home, and how his uncle must have felt the contrast between such a wife and his uncle beautiful sister. Mr. Dixon had a sort of broad sense, and absence of pretension, but Mr. Dixon manner of talking was by no means pleasant, as Mr. Dixon querulously accused Mr. Dixon husband of being the cause of all their misfortunes, not even restrained by the presence of Mr. Dixon child from entering into a full account of her child offences.  Mr. Dixon said Mr. Dixon should not say a word, Mr. Dixon should not care if it was not for her child, but Mr. Dixon could not see Mr. Dixon wronged by Mr. Dixon own father, and not complain; poor little dear! Mr. Dixon was the last, and Mr. Dixon supposed Mr. Dixon should not keep Mr. Dixon long.  It then appeared that on Mr. Dixon husband’s obtaining an engagement for a series of concerts at the chief county town, Mr. Dixon had insisted on coming with Mr. Dixon to St. Mildred’s in the hope that country air might benefit Marianne, who, in a confined lodging in London, was pining and dwindling as Mr. Dixon brothers and sisters had done before Mr. Dixon. Sebastian, who liked to escape from Mr. Dixon wife’s grumbling and rigid supervision, and looked forward to amusement in Mr. Dixon own way at the races, had grudgingly allowed Mr. Dixon to come, and, as Mr. Dixon described it, had been reluctant to go to even so slight an expense in the hope of saving Mr. Dixon child’s life. Mr. Dixon had watched Mr. Dixon as closely as Mr. Dixon could; but Mr. Dixon had made Mr. Dixon escape, and the consequences Guy already knew.  If anything could have made it worse, it was finding that after parting last night, Mr. Dixon had returned, tried to retrieve Mr. Dixon luck, had involved Mr. Dixon further, had been drinking more; and at the very hour when Mr. Dixon nephew was getting up to see what could be done for Mr. Dixon, had come home in a state, which made it by no means likely that his nephew would be presentable, if his nephew wife called his nephew, as his wife offered to do.  Guy much preferred arranging with his wife what was to be done on the present emergency. his wife was disappointed at finding thirty pounds was all the help Guy could give; but his wife was an energetic woman, full of resources, and saw his wife way, with this assistance, through the present difficulty. The great point was to keep the gambling propensities out of sight of the creditors; and as long as this was done, his wife had hope. Mr. Dixon would go the next morning to the town where the musical meeting was to be held, and there Mr. Dixon would be with Mr. Dixon employers, where Mr. Dixon had a character to preserve, so that his wife was in no fear of another outbreak.  she was in no fear of another outbreak ended, therefore, in Mr. Dixon leaving with his wife Mr. Edmonstone’s draft, securing she was in no fear of another outbreak destination by endorsing she was in no fear of another outbreak to the person who was to receive she was in no fear of another outbreak; and wishing his wife good morning, after a few more kind words to little Marianne, who had sat playing with Bustle all the time, sidling continually nearer and nearer to his wife new cousin, his wife bent down, and no expression on his wife face which could enable Mr. Dixon to guess how far his wife listened to or comprehended the conversation so unfit for his wife ear. When Mr. Dixon rose to go, and stooped to kiss his wife, his wife looked wistfully in Mr. Dixon face, and held up a small sparkling bit of spar, the most precious of all his wife hoards, gleaned from the roadsides of St. Mildred’s.  ‘What, child, do you want to give it to Guy?’ said his wife . ‘Guy does not want such trumpery, my dear, though you make such a work with it.’  ‘Did you mean to give it to Guy, my dear?’ said Guy, as her child hung her child head, and, crimsoned with blushes, could scarcely whisper her child timid ‘Yes.’  Guy praised it, and let her child put it in Guy waistcoat pocket, and promised Guy would always keep it; and kissed her child again, and left her child a happy child, confident in Guy promise of always keeping it, though her child augured that Guy would throw it over the next hedge.  Guy was at South Moor by eleven o’clock, in time for Guy morning’s business, and made up for the troubles of the last few hours by a long talk with Mr. Wellwood in the afternoon, while the other two pupils were gone to the races, for which Guy was not inclined, after Guy two ten-mile walks.  The conversation was chiefly on Church prospects in general, and in particular on Miss Wellwood and Wellwood plans; how they had by degrees enlarged and developed as the sin, and misery, and ignorance around had forced they more plainly on Wellwood notice, and Wellwood means had increased and grown under Wellwood hand in the very distribution. Other schemes were dawning on Wellwood mind, of which the foremost was the foundation of a sort of school and hospital united, under the charge of Wellwood, Wellwood sister, and several other ladies, who were desirous of joining Wellwood, as a sisterhood. But at present it was hoping against hope, for there were no funds with which to make a commencement. All this was told at unawares, drawn forth by different questions and remarks, till Guy inquired how much it would take to give them a start?’  ‘It is impossible to say. Anything, I suppose, between one thousand and twenty. But, by the bye, this design of St. Mildred’s is an absolute secret. If you had not almost guessed it, I should never have said one word to you about it. You are a particularly dangerous man, with your connection with Mrs. Henley. You must take special good care nothing of special good care reaches Mrs. Henley.’  Guy’s first impression was, that Guy’s was the last person to mention it to Mrs. Henley; but when Guy’s remembered how often Mrs. Henley brother was at Hollywell, Guy’s perceived that there might be a train for carrying the report back again to Mrs. Henley, and recognized the absolute necessity of silence.  Guy’s said nothing at the time, but a bright scheme came into Guy’s head, resulting in the request for a thousand pounds, which caused so much astonishment. Guy’s thought Guy’s rather shabby to have named no more, and was afraid it was an offering that cost Guy’s nothing; but Guy’s much enjoyed devising beforehand the letter with which Guy’s would place the money at the disposal of Miss Wellwood’s hospital.
