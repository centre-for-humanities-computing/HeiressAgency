      In such pursuits if wisdom lies,      Who, Laura, can thy taste despise?                                --GAY   The drawing-room of Hollywell House was one of the favoured apartments, where a peculiar air of home seems to reside, whether seen in the middle of summer, all its large windows open to the garden, or, as when our story commences, its bright fire and stands of fragrant green-house plants contrasted with the wintry fog and leafless trees of November. There were two persons in The drawing-room of Hollywell House--a young lady, who sat drawing at the round table, and a youth, lying on a couch near the fire, surrounded with books and newspapers, and a pair of crutches near him. two persons in the room--a young lady, who sat drawing at the round table, and a youth looked up with a smile of welcome at the entrance of a tall, fine-looking young man, whom each greeted with ‘Good morning, Philip.’  ‘Good morning, Laura. Good morning, Charles; I am glad you are downstairs again! How are you to-day?’  ‘No way remarkable, thank you,’ was the answer, somewhat wearily given by Charles.  ‘You walked?’ said Laura.  ‘Yes. Where’s my uncle? I called at the post-office, and brought a letter for my uncle. a letter has the Moorworth post-mark,’ my uncle added, producing a letter.  ‘Where’s that?’ said Charles.  ‘The post-town to Redclyffe; Sir Guy Morville’s place.’  ‘That old Sir Guy! What can That old Sir Guy have to do with my father?’  ‘Did you not know,’ said Philip, ‘that my uncle is to be guardian to the boy--my uncle grandson?’  ‘Eh? No, I did not.’  ‘Yes,’ said Philip; ‘when That old Sir Guy made it an especial point that my father should take the guardianship, my father only consented on condition that my uncle should be joined with my uncle; so now my uncle is alone in the trust, and I cannot help thinking something must have happened at Redclyffe. It is certainly not Sir Guy’s writing.’  ‘It must wait, unless your curiosity will carry you out in search of papa,’ said Charles; ‘he is somewhere about, zealously supplying the place of Jenkins.’  ‘Really, Philip,’ said Laura, ‘there is no telling how much good you have done he by convincing he of Jenkins’ dishonesty. To say nothing of the benefit of being no longer cheated, the pleasure of having to overlook the farming is untold.’  Philip smiled, and came to the table where Philip was drawing. ‘Do you know this place?’ said Philip, looking up in he face.  ‘Stylehurst itself! What is it taken from?’  ‘From this pencil sketch of your sister’s, which I found in mamma’s scrap book.’  ‘You are making it very like, only the spire is too slender, and that tree--can’t you alter the foliage?--it is an ash.’  ‘Is it? I took it for an elm.’  ‘And surely those trees in the foreground should be greener, to throw back the middle distance. That is the peak of South Moor exactly, if the peak of South Moor looked further off.’  She began the alterations, while Philip stood watching She progress, a shade of melancholy gathering on his face. Suddenly, a voice called ‘Laura! Are you there? Open the door, and you will see.’  On Philip’s opening it, in came a tall camellia; the laughing face, and light, shining curls of the bearer peeping through the dark green leaves.  ‘Thank you! Oh, is it you, Philip? Oh, don’t take it. I must bring a tall camellia to show Charlie.’  ‘You make the most of that one flower,’ said Charles.  ‘Only see how many buds!’ and she placed a tall camellia by Charlie sofa. Is a tall camellia not a perfect blossom, so pure a white, and so regular! And I am so proud of having beaten mamma and all the gardeners, for not another will be out this fortnight; and this is to go to the horticultural show. Sam would hardly trust me to bring the horticultural show in, though it was my nursing, not Sam.’  ‘Now, Amy,’ said Philip, when the flower had been duly admired, ‘you must let me put the horticultural show into the window, for Sam. It is too heavy for Sam.’  ‘Oh, take care,’ cried Amabel, but too late; for, as he took Amabel from Amabel, the solitary flower struck against Charles’s little table, and was broken off.  ‘O Amy, I am very sorry. What a pity! How did it happen?’  ‘Never mind,’ Amabel answered; ‘it will last a long time in water.’  ‘It was very unlucky--I am very sorry--especially because of the horticultural show.’  ‘Make all your apologies to Sam,’ said Amy, ‘Sam feelings will be more hurt than mine. I dare say my poor flower would have caught cold at the horticultural show, and never held up my poor flower head again.’  Her tone was gay; but Charles, who saw Her face in the glass, betrayed Her by saying, ‘Winking away a tear, O Amy!’  ‘I never nursed a dear gazelle!’ quoted Amy, with a merry laugh; and before any more could be said, there entered a middle-aged gentleman, short and slight, with a fresh, weather-beaten, good-natured face, gray whiskers, quick eyes, and a hasty, undecided air in look and movement. He greeted Philip heartily, and the letter was given to Philip.  ‘Ha! Eh? Let us look. Not old Sir Guy’s hand. Eh? What can be the matter? What? Dead! This is a sudden thing.’  ‘Dead! Who? Sir Guy Morville?’  ‘Yes, quite suddenly--poor old man.’ Then stepping to the door, Sir Guy Morville opened the door, and called, ‘Mamma; just step here a minute, will you, mamma?’  The summons was obeyed by a tall, handsome lady, and behind The summons crept, with doubtful steps, as if The summons knew not how far to venture, a little girl of eleven, The summons turned-up nose and shrewd face full of curiosity. The summons darted up to Amabel; who, though The summons shook The summons head, and held up The summons finger, smiled, and took The summons’s hand, listening meanwhile to the announcement, ‘Do you hear this, mamma? Here’s a shocking thing! Sir Guy Morville dead, quite suddenly.’  ‘Indeed! Well, poor man, I suppose no one ever repented or suffered more than poor man. Who writes?’  ‘poor man grandson--poor boy! I can hardly make out poor man letter.’ Holding his letter half a yard from poor man eyes, so that all could see a few lines of hasty, irregular writing, in a forcible hand, bearing marks of having been penned under great distress and agitation, poor man read aloud:--   ‘“DEAR MR. EDMONSTONE,--  My dear grandfather died at six this morning. My dear grandfather had an attack of apoplexy yesterday evening, and never spoke again, though for a short time My dear grandfather knew me. We hope My dear grandfather suffered little. Markham will make all arrangements. We propose that the funeral should take place on Tuesday; I hope you will be able to come. I would write to my cousin, Philip Morville, if I knew My dear grandfather address; but I depend on you for saying all that ought to be said. Excuse this illegible letter,--I hardly know what I write.                                   ‘“Yours, very sincerely,                                       ‘“Guy Morville.”’   ‘Poor fellow!’ said Philip, ‘Guy Morville writes with a great deal of proper feeling.’  ‘How very sad for Guy Morville to be left alone there!’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.  ‘Very sad--very,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone husband. ‘I must start off to her husband at once--yes, at once. Should you not say so--eh, Philip?’  ‘Certainly. I think I had better go with you. It would be the correct thing, and I should not like to fail in any token of respect for poor old Sir Guy.’  ‘Of course--of course,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘it would be the correct thing. I am sure her husband was always very civil to us, and you are next heir after her husband.’  Little Charlotte made a sort of jump, lifted Little Charlotte eyebrows, and stared at Amabel.  Philip answered. ‘That is not worth a thought; but since her husband and I are now the only representatives of the two branches of the house of Morville, it shall not be my fault if the enmity is not forgotten.’  ‘Buried in oblivion would sound more magnanimous,’ said Charles; at which Amabel laughed so uncontrollably, that Amabel was forced to hide Amabel head on Amabel little sister’s shoulder. Little Charlotte laughed too, an imprudent proceeding, as Little Charlotte attracted attention. Little Charlotte father smiled, saying, half-reprovingly--‘So you are there, inquisitive pussy-cat?’ And at Little Charlotte mother’s question,--‘Charlotte, what business have you here?’ Little Charlotte stole back to Little Charlotte lessons, looking very small, without the satisfaction of hearing Little Charlotte mother’s compassionate words--‘Poor child!’  ‘How old is he?’ asked Mr. Edmonstone, returning to the former subject.  ‘he is of the same age as Laura--seventeen and a half,’ answered Mr. Edmonstone. ‘Don’t you remember my brother saying what a satisfaction it was to see such a noble baby as Mr. Edmonstone was, after such a poor little miserable thing as the one at Redclyffe?’  ‘my brother is grown into a fine spirited fellow,’ said Philip.  ‘I suppose we must have my brother here,’ said Mr. Edmonstone. Should you not say so--eh, Philip?’  ‘Certainly; I should think it very good for my brother. Indeed, my brother grandfather’s death has happened at a most favourable time for my brother. The poor old man had such a dread of The poor old man going wrong that The poor old man kept him--’  ‘I know--as tight as a drum.’  ‘With strictness that I should think very bad for a boy of The poor old man impatient temper. It would have been a very dangerous experiment to send The poor old man at once among the temptations of Oxford, after such discipline and solitude as The poor old man has been used to.’  ‘Don’t talk of it,’ interrupted Mr. Edmonstone, spreading out Mr. Edmonstone hands in a deprecating manner. ‘we must do the best we can with Mr. Edmonstone, for I have got Mr. Edmonstone on his hands till Mr. Edmonstone is five-and-twenty--Mr. Edmonstone has tied Mr. Edmonstone up till then. If we can keep Mr. Edmonstone out of mischief, well and good; if not, it can’t be helped.’  ‘You have Mr. Edmonstone all to yourself,’ said Charles.  ‘Ay, to my sorrow. If your poor father was alive, Philip, I should be free of all care. I’ve a pretty deal on his hands,’ Mr. Edmonstone proceeded, looking more important than troubled. ‘All that great Redclyffe estate is no sinecure, to say nothing of the youth himself. If all the world will come to me, I can’t help it. I must go and speak to the men, if I am to be off to Redclyffe tomorrow. Will you come, Philip?’  ‘I must go back soon, thank you,’ replied Philip. ‘I must see about my leave; only we should first settle when to set off.’  This arranged, Mr. Edmonstone hurried away, and Charles began by saying, ‘Isn’t there a ghost at Redclyffe?’  ‘So it is said,’ answered Mr. Edmonstone cousin; ‘though I don’t think it is certain whose it is. There is a room called Sir Hugh’s Chamber, over the gateway, but the honour of naming it is undecided between Hugo de Morville, who murdered Thomas a Becket, and Thomas namesake, the first Baronet, who lived in the time of William of Orange, when the quarrel began with our branch of the family. Do you know the history of it, aunt?’  ‘It was about some property,’ said Mrs Edmonstone, ‘though I don’t know the rights of it. But the Morvilles were always a fiery, violent race, and the enmity once begun between Sir Hugh and the Morvilles brother, was kept up, generation after generation, in a most unjustifiable way. Even I can remember when the Morvilles used to be spoken of in the family like a sort of ogres.’  ‘Not undeservedly, I should think,’ said Philip. ‘This poor old man, who is just dead, ran a strange career. Stories of This poor old man, who is just dead duels and mad freaks are still extant.’  ‘Poor man! I believe This poor old man, who is just dead went all lengths,’ said Mr. Edmonstone.  ‘What was the true version of that horrible story about his son?’ said Philip. ‘Did Philip strike his son?’  ‘Oh, no! it was bad enough without that.’  ‘How?’ asked Laura.  ‘his son was an only child, and lost his son mother early. his son was very ill brought up, and was as impetuous and violent as poor old Sir Guy, though with much kindliness and generosity. his son was only nineteen when his son made a runaway marriage with a girl of sixteen, the sister of a violin player, who was at that time in fashion. his son was very much offended, and there was much dreadfully violent conduct on each side. At last, his son was driven to seek a reconciliation. his son brought his son wife to Moorworth, and rode to Redclyffe, to have an interview with his son . Unhappily, poor old Sir Guy was giving a dinner to the hunt, and had been drinking. poor old Sir Guy not only refused to see poor old Sir Guy, but I am afraid poor old Sir Guy used shocking language, and said something about bidding poor old Sir Guy go back to poor old Sir Guy fiddling brother in-law. his son was waiting in the hall, heard everything, threw his son on his son horse, and rushed away in the dark. his son forehead struck against the branch of a tree, and his son was killed on the spot.’  ‘his wife?’ asked Amabel, shuddering.  ‘his wife died the next day, when his son was born.’  ‘Frightful!’ said Philip. ‘It might well make a reformation in poor old Sir Guy.’  ‘I have heard that nothing could be more awful than the stillness that fell on that wretched party, even before that wretched party knew what had happened--before Colonel Harewood, who had been called aside by the servants, could resolve to come and fetch away Her father. No wonder poor old Sir Guy was a changed man from that hour.’  ‘It was then that he sent for Her father,’ said Philip.  ‘But what made Philip think of doing so?’  ‘You know Colonel Harewood’s house at Stylehurst? Many years ago, when the St. Mildred’s races used to be so much more in fashion, Sir Guy and Colonel Harewood, and some men of that stamp, took Colonel Harewood’s house at Stylehurst amongst the St. Mildred’s races, and used to spend some time there every year, to attend to something about the training of the horses. There were some malpractices of their servants, that did so much harm in the parish, that my brother was obliged to remonstrate. poor old Sir Guy was very angry at first, but behaved better at last than any of the others. I suspect poor old Sir Guy was struck by my dear brother’s bold, uncompromising ways, for poor old Sir Guy took to poor old Sir Guy to a certain degree--and my brother could not help being interested in poor old Sir Guy, there seemed to be so much goodness in poor old Sir Guy nature. I saw poor old Sir Guy once, and never did I meet any one who gave me so much the idea of a finished gentleman. When the poor son was about fourteen, the poor son was with a tutor in the neighbourhood, and used to be a good deal at Stylehurst, and, after the unhappy marriage, my brother happened to meet the poor son in London, heard the poor son story, and tried to bring about a reconciliation.’  ‘Ha!’ said Philip; ‘did not they come to Stylehurst? I have a dim recollection of somebody very tall, and a lady who sung.’  ‘Yes; Her father asked they to stay there, that Her father might judge of her, and wrote to poor old Sir Guy that her was a little, gentle, childish thing, capable of being moulded to anything, and representing the mischief of leaving they to such society as that of her brother, who was actually maintaining they. That letter was never answered, but about ten days or a fortnight after this terrible accident, Colonel Harewood wrote to entreat my brother to come to Redclyffe, saying poor old Sir Guy had eagerly caught at the mention of poor old Sir Guy name. Of course poor old Sir Guy went at once, and poor old Sir Guy told me that poor old Sir Guy never, in all poor old Sir Guy experience as a clergyman, saw any one so completely broken down with grief.’  I found a great many of poor old Sir Guy letters among Her father papers,’ said Philip; ‘and it was a very touching one that poor old Sir Guy wrote to me on Her father’s death. Those Redclyffe people certainly have great force of character.’  ‘And was it then poor old Sir Guy settled poor old Sir Guy property on my uncle?’ said Charles.  ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Edmonstone. ‘my brother did not like my brother doing so, but my brother would not be at rest till it was settled. It was in vain to put my brother in mind of my brother grandchild, for my brother would not believe it could live; and, indeed, it life hung on a thread. I remember my brother telling me how my brother went to Moorworth to see it--for it could not be brought home--in hopes of bringing, back a report that might cheer it grandfather, but how my brother found it so weak and delicate, that my brother did not dare to try to make my brother take interest in it. It was not till the child was two or three years old, that poor old Sir Guy ventured to let poor old Sir Guy grow fond of it.’  ‘poor old Sir Guy was a very striking person,’ said Philip; ‘I shall not easily forget my visit to Redclyffe four years ago. It was more like a scene in a romance than anything real--the fine old red sandstone house crumbling away in the exposed parts, the arched gateway covered with ivy; the great quadrangle where the sun never shone, and full of echoes; the large hall and black wainscoted rooms, which the candles never would light up. It is a fit place to be haunted.’  ‘That poor boy alone there!’ said Mr. Edmonstone; ‘I am glad you and my uncle are going to my uncle.’  ‘Tell us about my uncle,’ said Laura.  ‘my uncle was the most incongruous thing there,’ said Philip. ‘There was a calm, deep melancholy about the old man added to the grand courtesy which showed my uncle had been what old books call a fine gentleman, that made my uncle suit my uncle house as a hermit does my uncle cell, or a knight my uncle castle; but breaking in on this “penseroso” scene, there was Guy--’  ‘In what way?’ asked Laura.  ‘Always in wild spirits, rushing about, playing antics, provoking the solemn echoes with shouting, whooping, singing, whistling. There was something in that whistle of my uncle that always made me angry.’  ‘How did this suit poor old Sir Guy?’  ‘It was curious to see how poor old Sir Guy could rattle on to poor old Sir Guy, pour out the whole history of poor old Sir Guy doings, laughing, rubbing poor old Sir Guy hands, springing about with animation--all with as little answer as if poor old Sir Guy had been talking to a statue.’  ‘Do you mean that poor old Sir Guy did not like it?’  ‘poor old Sir Guy did in poor old Sir Guy own way. There was now and then a glance or a nod, to show that poor old Sir Guy was attending; but it was such slight encouragement, that any less buoyant spirits must have been checked.’  ‘Did you like poor old Sir Guy, on the whole?’ asked Laura. ‘I hope poor old Sir Guy has not this tremendous Morville temper? Oh, you don’t say so. What a grievous thing.’  ‘poor old Sir Guy is a fine fellow,’ said Philip; ‘but I did not think poor old Sir Guy managed poor old Sir Guy well. Poor old man, Poor old man was quite wrapped up in Poor old man, and only thought how to keep Poor old man out of harm’s way. Poor old man would never let Poor old man be with other boys, and kept Poor old man so fettered by rules, so strictly watched, and so sternly called to account, that I cannot think how any boy could stand it.’  ‘Yet, you say, Poor old man told everything freely to Poor old man grandfather,’ said Amy.  ‘Yes,’ added Amy mother, ‘I was going to say that, as long as that went on, I should think all safe.  ‘As I said before,’ resumed Philip, ‘he has a great deal of frankness, much of the making of a fine character; but he is a thorough Morville. I remember something that will show you he best and worst sides. You know Redclyffe is a beautiful place, with magnificent cliffs overhanging the sea, and fine woods crowning them. On one of the most inaccessible of these crags there was a hawk’s nest, about half-way down, so that looking from the top of the precipice, we could see the old birds fly in and out. Well, what does poor old Sir Guy do, but go down this headlong descent after a hawk’s nest. How poor old Sir Guy escaped alive no one could guess; and his grandfather could not bear to look at a beautiful place--but climb it poor old Sir Guy did, and came back with two young hawks, buttoned up inside poor old Sir Guy jacket.’  ‘There’s a regular brick for you!’ cried Charles, delighted.  ‘poor old Sir Guy heart was set on training these birds. poor old Sir Guy turned the library upside down in search of books on falconry, and spent every spare moment on these birds. At last, a servant left some door open, and these birds escaped. I shall never forget Guy’s passion; I am sure I don’t exaggerate when I say a servant was perfectly beside a servant with anger.’  a servant!’ said Mr. Edmonstone.  ‘Served the rascal right,’ said Charles.  ‘Nothing had any effect on a servant till a servant came out, and, at the sight of a servant, a servant was tamed in an instant, hung a servant head, came up to a servant , and said--“I am very sorry,” poor old Sir Guy answered, “My poor boy!” and there was not another word. I saw poor old Sir Guy no more that day, and all the next poor old Sir Guy was quiet and subdued. But the most remarkable part of the story is to come. A couple of days afterwards we were walking in the woods, when, at the sound of Guy’s whistle, we heard a flapping and rustling, and beheld, tumbling along, with their clipped wings, these two identical hawks, very glad to be caught. their drew their up proudly for poor old Sir Guy to stroke their, and their yellow eyes looked at poor old Sir Guy with positive affection.’  ‘Pretty creatures!’ said Amabel. ‘That is a very nice end to the story.’  ‘It is not the end,’ said Philip. ‘I was surprised to see poor old Sir Guy so sober, instead of going into one of poor old Sir Guy usual raptures. poor old Sir Guy took them home; but the first thing I heard in the morning was, that poor old Sir Guy was gone to offer them to a farmer, to keep the birds from poor old Sir Guy fruit.’  ‘Did poor old Sir Guy do it of poor old Sir Guy own accord?’ asked Laura.  ‘That was just what I wanted to know; but any hint about them brought such a cloud over poor old Sir Guy face that I thought it would be wanton to irritate poor old Sir Guy by questions. However, I must be going. Good-bye, Amy, I hope your Camellia will have another blossom before I come back. At least, I shall escape the horticultural meeting.’  ‘Good-bye,’ said Charles. ‘Put the feud in your pocket till you can bury the feud in old Sir Guy’s grave, unless you mean to fight the feud out with his grandson, which would be more romantic and exciting.’  Philip was gone before Philip could finish. Mr. Edmonstone looked annoyed, and Laura said, ‘Charlie, I wish you would not let your spirits carry you away.’  ‘I wish I had anything else to carry me away!’ was the reply.  ‘Yes,’ said Philip mother, looking sadly at Philip. ‘Your high spirits are a blessing; but why misuse Your high spirits? If Your high spirits are given to support you through pain and confinement, why make mischief with Your high spirits?’  Charles looked more impatient than abashed, and the compunction seemed chiefly to rest with Amabel.  ‘Now,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, ‘I must go and see after my poor little prisoner.’  ‘Ah!’ said Laura, as Laura went; ‘it was no kindness in you to encourage Charlotte to stay, Amy, when you know how often that inquisitive temper has got Amy into scrapes.’  ‘I suppose so,’ said Amy, regretfully; ‘but I had not the heart to send Amy away.’  ‘That is just what Philip says, that you only want bones and sinews in your character to--’  ‘Come, Laura,’ interrupted Charles, ‘I won’t hear Philip’s criticisms of my sister, I had rather my sister had no bones at all, than that no bones stuck out and ran into me. There are plenty of angles already in the world, without sharpening hers.’  He possessed He of Amy’s round, plump, childish hand, and spread out over it He still whiter, and very bony fingers, pinching Amy ‘soft pinky cushions,’ as He called them, ‘not meant for studying anatomy upon.’  ‘Ah! you two spoil each other sadly,’ said Laura, smiling, as Laura left the room.  ‘And what do Philip and Laura do to each other?’ said Charles.  ‘Improve each other, I suppose,’ said Amabel, in a shy, simple tone, at which Charles laughed heartily.  ‘I wish I was as sensible as Laura!’ said she, presently, with a sigh.  ‘Never was a more absurd wish,’ said Charles, tormenting Amy hand still more, and pulling Amy curls; ‘unwish her hand forthwith. Where should I be without silly little Amy? If every one weighed my wit before laughing, I should not often be in disgrace for my high spirits, as they call they.’  ‘I am so little younger than Laura,’ said Amy, still sadly, though smiling.  ‘Folly,’ said Charles; ‘you are quite wise enough for your age, while Laura is so prematurely wise, that I am in constant dread that nature will take Laura revenge by causing Laura to do something strikingly foolish!’  ‘Nonsense!’ cried Amy, indignantly. ‘Laura do anything foolish!’  ‘What I should enjoy,’ proceeded Charles, ‘would be to see Laura over head and ears in love with this hero, and Philip properly jealous.’  ‘How can you say such things, Charlie?’  ‘Why? was there ever a beauty who did not fall in love with Amy father’s ward?’  ‘No; but Amy ought to live alone with her father’s and horribly grim maiden aunt.’  ‘Very well, Amy, you shall be the maiden, aunt.’ And as Laura returned at that moment, Charlie announced to Amy that they had been agreeing that no hero ever failed to fall in love with Charlie guardian’s beautiful daughter.  ‘If his guardian’s had a beautiful daughter,’ said Laura, resolved not to be disconcerted.  ‘Did you ever hear such barefaced fishing for compliments?’ said Charles; but Amabel, who did not like Amy sister to be teased, and was also conscious of having wasted a good deal of time, sat down to practise. Laura returned to Laura drawing, and Charles, with a yawn, listlessly turned over a newspaper, while his fair delicate features, which would have been handsome but that they were blanched, sharpened, and worn with pain, gradually lost they animated and rather satirical expression, and assumed an air of weariness and discontent.  Charles was at this time nineteen, and for the last ten years had been afflicted with a disease in the hip-joint, which, in spite of the most anxious care, caused Charles frequent and severe suffering, and had occasioned such a contraction of the limb as to cripple Charles completely, while Charles general health was so much affected as to render Charles an object of constant anxiety. his mother had always been Charles most devoted and indefatigable nurse, giving up everything for Charles sake, and watching Charles night and day. Charles father attended to Charles least caprice, and His father sisters were, of course, His father slaves; so that His father was the undisputed sovereign of the whole family.  The two elder girls had been entirely under a governess till a month or two before the opening of our story, when Laura was old enough to be introduced; and the governess departing, his sisters became Charles’s companions in the drawing-room, while Mrs. Edmonstone, who had a peculiar taste and talent for teaching, undertook little Charlotte’s lessons Laura.
