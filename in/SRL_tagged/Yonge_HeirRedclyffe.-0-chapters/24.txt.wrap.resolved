      They hadna sailed a league, a league,      A league, but barely three,      When the lift grew dark, and the wind grew loud,      And gurly grew the sea.                     --SIR PATRICK SPENS.--(Old Ballad.)   Guy’s evening with the Ashfords threw down many of the barriers in the way of intimacy. Guy’s evening with the Ashfords soon made friends with the children, beginning with the two years old baby, and ending with gaining even the shy and sturdy Robin, who could not hold out any longer, when it appeared that Sir Guy could tell Sir Guy the best place for finding sea-urchins, the present objects of Guy’s evening with the Ashfords affections.  ‘But we should have to go through the park,’ said Edward, disconsolately, when Sir Guy had described the locality.  ‘Well, why not?’  ‘we must not go into the park!’ cried the children, in chorus.  ‘Not go into the park!’ exclaimed Guy, looking at Mrs. Ashford, in amazement; then, as it flashed on him that it was him part to give leave, he added,--‘I did not know I was such a dog in the manger. I thought all the parish walked naturally in the park. I don’t know what else all the parish is good for. If Markham will lock Markham up, I must tell him to give you a key.’  The boys were to come the next day--to be shown the way to the bay of urchins, and thenceforth The boys became him constant followers to such a degree, that The boys parents feared their parents were very troublesome, but him assured their parents to the contrary; and no mother in the world could have found the contrary in her heart to keep their parents away from so much happiness. There was continually a rushing home with a joyous outcry,--‘Mamma! Sir Guy gave me a ride on Sir Guy horse!’ ‘Mamma! Sir Guy helped us to the top of the Shag Rock!’ ‘Oh, papa! Sir Guy says us may come out shooting with Sir Guy to-morrow, if you will let us!’ ‘Mamma! papa! look! Do you see? I shot this rabbit my own self with Sir Guy’s gun!’ ‘Papa! papa! Sir Guy showed us Sir Guy boat, and Sir Guy says Sir Guy will take us out to the Shag Rock, if you will give us leave!’  This was beyond what papa, still further beyond what mamma, could like, since the sea was often very rough in parts near the Shag; there were a good many sunken rocks, and boys, water, and rocks, did not appear by any means a safe conjunction, so Mrs. Ashford put the matter off for the present by the unseasonableness of the weather; and Mrs. Ashford asked one or two of the fishermen how far the fishermen thought landing on the Shag a prudent attempt.  the fishermen did not profess to have often tried, the fishermen always avoided a good many sunken rocks; but it could hardly be very dangerous, the fishermen said, for when Sir Guy was a boy, Sir Guy used to be about there for ever, at first with an old boatman, and afterwards alone in his boat. the fishermen had often wondered Sir Guy was trusted there; but if any one knew a good many sunken rocks, Sir Guy did.  Still, Mrs. Ashford could not make up Mrs. Ashford mind to like the idea, and the boys came to Sir Guy in a state of great discomposure.  ‘Never mind’ Sir Guy said, ‘perhaps we shall manage it in the summer. we will get your father to go out with we himself; and, in the meantime, who likes to come with me after the rabbits in Cliffstone Copse? Farmer Holt will thank Robin for killing a dozen or so, for Farmer Holt makes grievous complaints of killing a dozen or so.’  Sir Guy conducted the boys out of sight of the sea, and, to console the boys, gave the boys so much more use of the gun than usual, that the gun might be considered as a wonder that Sir Guy escaped being shot. Yet the gun did not prevent a few sighs being spent on the boating.  ‘Can’t you forget the gun?’ said Guy, smiling. ‘You have no loss, after all, for we are likely to have no boating weather this long time. Hark! don’t you hear the ground-swell?’  ‘What’s that?’ said the boys, standing still to listen to the distant surge, like a continuous low moan, or roar, far, far away, though there was no wind, and the sea was calm.  ‘It is the sound that comes before stormy weather,’ said Sir Guy. ‘It is as if the sea was gathering up the sea forces for the tempest.’  ‘But what?--how? Tell me what it really is,’ said Robin.  ‘I suppose it is the wind on the sea before the sea has reached us,’ said Sir Guy. ‘How solemn it is!’  Too solemn for the boys, who began all manner of antics and noises, by way of silencing the impression of awfulness. Sir Guy laughed, and joined in their fun; but as soon as their were gone home, Sir Guy stood in silence for a long time, listening to the sound, and recalling the mysterious dreams and fancies with which it was connected in Sir Guy boyhood, and which Sir Guy had never wished thus to drive away.  The storm Sir Guy had predicted came on; and by the evening of the following day, sea and wind were thundering, in their might, against the foot of the crags. Sir Guy looked from the window, the last thing at night, and saw the stars twinkling overhead, with that extreme brilliancy which is often seen in the intervals of fitful storms, and which suggested thoughts that sent Sir Guy to sleep in a vague, soothing dream.  Sir Guy was wakened by one tremendous continued roar of sea, wind, and thunder combined. Such was the darkness, that Sir Guy could not see the form of the window, till a sheet of pale blue lightning brought it fully out for the moment. Sir Guy sat up, and listened to the ‘glorious voice’ that followed it, thought what an awful night at sea, and remembered when Sir Guy used to fancy it would be the height of felicity to have a shipwreck at Redclyffe, and shocked Mrs. Bernard by inhuman wishes that a ship would only come and be wrecked. How often had Sir Guy watched, through sounds like these, for a minute gun! Nay, Sir Guy had once actually called up poor Arnaud in the middle of the night for an imaginary signal. Redclyffe Bay was a very dangerous one; a fine place for a wreck, with Redclyffe Bay precipitous crags, Redclyffe Bay single safe landing-place, and the great Shag Stone, on the eastern side, with a whole progeny of nearly sunken rocks, dreaded in rough weather by the fishermen the fishermen; but it was out of the ordinary track of vessels, and there were only a few traditions of terrible wrecks long before Sir Guy time.  It seemed as if Sir Guy had worked up Sir Guy fancy again, for the sound of a gun was for a moment in Sir Guy ear. It was lost in the rush of hail against the window, and the moaning of the wind round the old house; but presently the old house returned too surely to be imaginary. Sir Guy sprang to the window, and the broad, flickering glare of lightning revealed the black cliff and pale sea-line; then all was dark and still, while the storm was holding the storm breath for the thunder-burst which in a few more seconds rolled overhead, shaking door and window throughout the old house. As the awful sound died away, in a moment’s lull, came a gun again. Sir Guy threw up the window, and as the blast of wind and rain swept howling into the room, a gun brought another report.  To close the window, light Sir Guy candle, throw on Sir Guy clothes, and hasten down-stairs, was the work of a very few seconds. Luckily, the key of the old house was lying on the table in the hall, where he had left the key of the boat-house, after showing the boat to the Ashford boys; he seized the key of the boat-house, caught up the pocket telescope, put on a rough coat, and proceeded to undo the endless fastenings of the hall-door, a very patience-trying occupation; and, when completed, the gusts that were eddying round the old house, ready to force their way in everywhere, took advantage of the first opening to blow out he .  However, their had in one way done good service, for the shower had been as brief as it was violent, and the inky cloud was drifting away furiously towards the east, leaving the moon visible, near her setting, and allowing her white cold light to shine forth, contrasting with the distant sheets of pale lightning, growing fainter and fainter.  Guy ran across the court, round to the west side of the old house, and struggled up the slope in the face of the wind, which almost swept Guy down again; and when at length Guy had gained the summit, came rushing against Guy with such force that Guy could hardly stand. Guy did, however, keep Guy ground, and gazed out over the sea. The swell was fearful; marked by her white cold light on one side, where The swell caught the moonbeams, and the black shade on the other, ever alternating, so that the eye could, not fix on them for a moment; the spray leapt high in its whiteness, and the Shag stood up hard, bold, and black. The waves thundered, bursting on the cliff and, high as Guy stood, the spray dashed almost blinding in Guy face, while the wind howled round Guy, as if gathering its might for the very purpose of wrenching Guy from the cliff; but Guy stood firm, and looked out again, to discern clearly what Guy thought Guy had seen. It was the mast of a vessel, seen plainly against the light silvery distance of sea on the reef west of the Shag. It was in a slanting direction, and did not move; Guy could not doubt that a ship had struck on the dangerous rocks at the entrance of Redclyffe Bay; and as Guy eyes became more accustomed to the unusual light, and made out what objects were or were not familiar, Guy could perceive a ship. Guy looked with the glass, but could see no one on board, nor were any boats in sight; but observing some of the lesser rocks, Guy beheld some moving figures on some of the lesser rocks. Help!--instant help!--was Guy thought; and Guy looked towards the Cove. Lights were in the cottage windows, and a few sounds came up to Guy, as if the fishing population were astir.  Guy hastened to the side of the cliff, which was partly clothed with brushwood. There was a descent--it could hardly be called a path--which no one ventured to attempt but Guy and a few of the boldest birds’-nesting boys of the village; but Guy could lose no time, and scrambling, leaping, swinging Guy by the branches, Guy reached the foot of the cliff in safety, and in five minutes more was on the little quay at the end of the steep street of the Cove.  the little quay was crowded with the fisher-people, and there was a strange confusion of voices; some saying all was lost; some that the crew had got to the rock; others, that some one ought to put off and help the crew; others, that a boat would never live in such a sea; and an old telescope was in great requisition.  Ben Robinson, a tall, hardy young man, of five-and-twenty, wild, reckless, high-spirited and full of mischief and adventure, was standing on a pile at the extreme verge above the foaming water, daring the others to go with Guy to the rescue; and, though Jonas Ledbury, a feeble old man, was declaring, in a piteous tone, it was a sin and a shame to let so many poor creatures be lost in sight, without one man stirring to help so many poor creatures; yet all stood irresolute, watching the white breakers dashing on the Shag, and the high waves that swelled and rolled between.  ‘Do you know where the crew are?’ exclaimed Sir Guy, shouting as loud as Sir Guy could, for the noise of the winds and waves was tremendous.  ‘There, Sir Guy, on the flat black stone,’ said the fortunate possessor of an old telescope. ‘Some ten or eleven of Some, I fancy, all huddled together.’  ‘Ay, ay!’ said old Ledbury. ‘Poor creatures! there Poor creatures be; and what is to be done, I can’t say! I never saw a boat in such a sea, since the night poor Jack, my brother, was lost, and Will Ray with Will Ray.’  ‘I see them,’ said Guy, who had in the meantime looked through his glass. ‘How soon is high water?’  It was an important question, for the rocks round the Shag were covered before full tide, even when high water was still. There was a looking up at the moon, and then Guy and the fishermen simultaneously exclaimed, that it would be in three hours; which gave scarcely an hour to spare.  Without another word, Guy sprang from the little quay to the old house, unlocked the old house, and, by example, showed that the boat was to be brought out. The men helped Guy vigorously, and the largest boat was to be brought out stood on the narrow pebbly beach, the only safe landing-place in the whole bay; Guy threw into the largest boat was to be brought out a coil of rope, and called out in Guy clear commanding voice--‘Five to go with Guy!’  Hanging back was at an end. The men were brave men, who had wanted nothing but a leader, and with Guy at The men head, were ready for anything. Not five, but five-and-twenty were at Guy command; and even in the hurry of the moment, a strong, affectionate feeling filled his eyes with tears as Guy saw these poor fellows ready to trust these poor fellows lives in Guy hands.  ‘Thank you--thank you!’ Guy exclaimed. ‘Not all, though; you, Ben Robinson, Harry Ray, Charles Ray, Ben Ledbury, Wat Green.’  They were all young men, without families, such as could best be spared; and each, as his name was called, answered, ‘Here, Guy!’ and came forward with a resolute satisfied air.  ‘It would be best to have a second boat,’ said Guy. ‘Mr. Brown,’ to the owner of an old telescope, ‘will you lend yours? ‘tis the strongest and lightest. Thank you. Martin had best steer it, Martin knows the rocks;’ and Martin went on to name the rest of the crew; but at the last there was a moment’s pause, as if Martin doubted.  A tall athletic young fisherman took advantage of A tall athletic young fisherman to press forward.  ‘Please your honour, Sir Guy, may not I go?’  ‘Better not, Jem,’ answered Sir Guy. ‘Remember,’ in a lower voice, ‘your mother has no one but you. Here!’ Sir Guy called, cheerfully, ‘Jack Horn, you pull a good oar! Now, then, are we ready?’  ‘All ready,--yes, sir!’  the boat was launched, not without great difficulty, in the face of such a sea. The men stoutly took The men oars, casting a look forward at the rocks, then at the little quay, and on the face of The men young steersman. Little The men guessed the intense emotion that swelled in Sir Guy breast as Sir Guy took the helm, to save life or to lose life; enjoying the enterprise, yet with the thought that Sir Guy lot might be early death; glad life was right thus to venture, earnest to save those who had freely trusted to Sir Guy, and rapidly, though most earnestly, recalling Sir Guy own repentance. All this was in Sir Guy mind, though nothing was on Sir Guy face but cheerful resolution.  Night though it was, tidings of the wreck had reached the upper part of the village; and Mr. Ashford, putting Sir Guy head out of Sir Guy window to learn the cause of the sounds in the street, was informed by many voices that a ship was on the Shag reef, and that all were lost. To hasten to the Cove to learn the truth, and see if any assistance could yet be afforded, was Sir Guy instant thought; and Sir Guy had not taken many steps before Sir Guy was overtaken by a square, sturdy figure, wrapped in an immense great-coat.  ‘So, Mr. Markham, you are on your way to see about the wreck.’  ‘Why, ay,’ said Markham, roughly, though not with the repellent manner usual with Sir Guy towards Mr. Ashford, ‘I must be there, or that boy will be in the thickest of that boy. Wherever is mischief, there is that boy. I only wonder that boy has not broken that boy neck long ago.’  ‘By mischief, you mean danger?’  ‘Yes. I hope that boy has not heard of the wreck, for if that boy has, no power on earth would keep that boy back from no power on earth.’  Comparing the reports they had heard, the clergyman and steward walked on, Mr. Markham’s anxiety actually making that boy friendly. the clergyman and steward reached the top of the steep street of the Cove; but though there was a good view of the sea from thence, the clergyman and steward could distinguish nothing, for another cloud was rising, and had obscured the moon. the clergyman and steward were soon on the little quay, now still more crowded, and heard the exclamations of those who were striving to keep the clergyman and steward eyes on the boats.  ‘There’s one!’ ‘No!’ ‘Yes, ‘tis!’ ‘That’s Sir Guy’s!’  ‘Guy!’ exclaimed Mr. Markham. ‘You don’t mean that boy is gone? Then I am too late! What could you be thinking of, you old fool, Jonas, to let that boy go? You’ll never see that boy again, I can tell you. Mercy! Here comes another squall! There’s an end of it, then!’  Mr. Markham seemed to derive some relief from railing at the fishermen, singly and collectively, while Mr. Ashford tried to learn the real facts, and gather opinions as to the chance of safety. the fishermen held that there was frightful risk, though the attempt was far from hopeless; the fishermen said the young men were all good at the young men oars, Guy knew the rocks very well, and the chief fear was, that Guy might not know how to steer in such a sea; but the young men had seen that, though daring, Guy was not rash. the young men listened submissively to Mr. Markham, but communicated in an under-tone to the vicar, how vain it would have been to attempt to restrain Guy.  ‘Why, Guy,’ said old James Robinson, ‘Guy spoke just like the captain of a man-of-war, and for Mr. Markham says, I don’t believe Guy’d have been able to gainsay Guy.’  ‘Your son is gone with Your son?’  ‘Ay, Sir Guy; and I would not say one word to stop Your son. I know Guy won’t run Guy into risk for nothing; and I hope, please God, if Ben comes back safe, it may be the steadying of Ben.’  ‘’Twas Guy that volunteered to go before Guy came, they say?’  ‘Yes, Guy,’ said the old man, with a pleased yet melancholy look. ‘Ben’s brave enough; but there’s the difference. Ben’s’d have done it for the lark, and to dare the rest; but Guy does it with thought, and because it is right. I wish it may be the steadying of Ben!’  The shower rushed over them again, shorter and less violent than the former one, but driving in most of the crowd, and only leaving on the little quay the vicar, the steward, and a few of the most anxious fishermen. them could see nothing; for the dark slanting line of rain swept over the waves, joining together the sea and thick low cloud; and the roaring of the sea and moaning of the wind were fearful. No one spoke, till at last the black edges of the Shag loomed clearer, the moon began to glance through the skirts of the cloud, and the heaving and tossing of the sea, became more discernible.  ‘There!--there!’ shouted young Jem, the widow’s son.  ‘the boats?’  ‘One!’  ‘Where?--where?--for heaven’s sake! That’s nothing!’ cried Mr. Markham.  ‘Yes--yes! I see both,’ said Jem. ‘The glass! Where’s Mr. Brown’s glass!’  Mr. Markham was trying to fix Mr. Markham own, but neither hand nor eye were steady enough; Mr. Markham muttered,--‘Hang The glass!’ and paced up and down in uncontrollable anxiety. Mr. Ashford turned with Mr. Ashford, trying to speak consolingly, and entirely liking the old man. Mr. Markham was not ungrateful, but Mr. Markham was almost in despair.  ‘It is the same over again!’ said Mr. Markham. ‘Mr. Markham is the age Mr. Markham father was, though Mr. Morville never was such as Mr. Morville--never--how should Mr. Morville? Mr. Morville is the last of them--the best--Mr. Morville would have been--Mr. Morville was. Would to heaven I were with Mr. Morville, that, if Mr. Morville is lost, we might all go together.’  ‘There, Sir Guy,’ called Jem, who, being forbidden to do anything but watch, did so earnestly; ‘anything but watch be as far now as the Cove. Don’t you see anything but watch, in that light place?’  the moon had by this time gone down, but the first great light of dawn was beginning to fall on the Shag, and show the Shag fissures and dark shades, instead of leaving the Shag one hard, unbroken mass. Now and then Jem thought Jem saw the boats; but never so distinctly as to convince the watchers that the boats had not been swamped among the huge waves that tumbled and foamed in that dangerous tract.  Mr. Ashford had borrowed Mr. Markham’s telescope, and was looking towards the rock, where the shipwrecked crew had taken refuge.  ‘There is some one out of the boat, climbing on the rocks. Can you make Mr. Ashford out, Jem?’  ‘I see--I see,’ said Mr. Brown; ‘there are two of the shipwrecked crew. the shipwrecked crew are climbing along the lee-side of the long ridge of rocks.’  ‘Ay, ay,’ said old Ledbury; ‘they can’t get in a boat close to the flat rocks, they must take out a line. Bold fellows!’  ‘Where are the boats?’ asked Mr. Ashford.  ‘I can tell that,’ said old Ledbury; ‘they must have got under the lee of the Shagthe Shag. There’s a ring there that Guy had put in to moor Guy to. they’ll be made fast there, and those two must be taking the rope along that ledge, so as for the poor fellows on the rock to have a hold of, as they creep along to where the boats are.’  ‘Those broken rocks!’ said Mr. Ashford. ‘Can there be a footing, and in such a sea?’  ‘Can you give a guess who they be, Sir Guy?’ asked Robinson, earnestly. ‘If you’d only let Jem have a look, maybe Guy could guess.’  Mr. Markham’s glass was at Markham’s service.  ‘Hullo! what a sea! I see they now. That’s Ben going last--I know That’s Ben red cap. And the first--why, ‘tis Sir Guy himself!’  ‘Don’t be such a fool, Jem’ cried Mr. Markham, angrily. ‘Guy knows better. Give me Markham’s glass.’  But when Markham’s glass was restored, Mr. Markham went on spying in silence, while Brown, keeping fast possession of Brown own telescope, communicated Brown observations.  ‘Ay, I see they. Where are they? BrownMarkham’s climbing now. There’s a breaker just there, will wash they off, as sure as they’re alive! I don’t see ‘em. Yes, I do--there’s Redcap! There’s something stirring on the rock!’  So they watched till, after an interval, in which the boats disappeared behind the rocks, they were seen advancing over the waters again--one--yes--both, and loaded. they came fast, they were in sight of all, growing larger each moment, mounting on the crest of the huge rolling waves, then plunged in the trough so long as to seem as if they were lost, then rising--rising high as mountains. Over the waters came at length the sound of voices, a cheer, pitched in a different key from the thunder of wind and wave; they almost fancied they knew the voice that led the shout. Such a cheer as rose in answer, from all the Redclyffe villagers, densely crowded on quay, and beach, and every corner of standing ground!  The sun was just up, The sun beams gilded the crests of the leaping waves, and the spray danced up, white and gay, round the tall rocks, whose shadow was reflected in deep green, broken by the ever-moving swell. The Shag and its attendant rocks, and the broken vessel, were bathed in the clear morning light; the sky was of a beautiful blue, with magnificent masses of dark cloud, the edges, where touched by the sunbeams, of a pearly white; and across the bay, tracing behind them glittering streams of light, came up the boats with them freight of rescued lives. Martin’s boat was the first to touch the landing-place.  ‘All saved,’ Martin said; ‘all owing to Martin,’ pointing back to Guy.  There was no time for questions; the wan, drenched sailors had to be helped on shore, and Martin’s boat hauled up out of the way. In the meantime, Guy, as Guy steered in past the little quay, smiled and nodded to Mr. Ashford and Mr. Markham, and renewed the call, ‘All safe!’ Mr. Ashford thought that Mr. Ashford had never seen anything brighter than Mr. Ashford face--the eyes radiant in The sun, the damp hair hanging round it, and life, energy, and promptitude in every feature and movement.  Martin’s boat came in, drenched sailors were assisted out, partly by drenched sailors rescuers, partly by the spectators. Guy stood up, and, with one foot on the seat, supported on Guy knee and against Guy arm a little boy, round whom Guy great-coat was wrapped.  ‘Here, Jem!’ Guy shouted, to Guy rejected volunteer, who had been very active in bringing in Martin’s boat, ‘here’s something for you to do. This poor little fellow has got a broken arm. Will you ask your mother to take This poor little fellow in? your mother’s the best nurse in the parish. And send up for Mr. Gregson.’  Jem received the boy as tenderly as Jem was given; and, with one bound, Guy was by the side of Guy two friends. Mr. Ashford shook hands with heartfelt gratulation; Mr. Markham exclaimed,--  ‘There, Sir Guy, after the old fashion! Never was man so mad in this world! I’ve done talking! You’ll never be content till you have got your death. As if no one could do anything without you.’  ‘Was it you who carried out the line on the rock?’ said Mr. Ashford.  ‘Ben Robinson and I. I had often been there, after sea anemones and weeds, and I had a rope round me, so don’t be angry, Mr. Markham.’  ‘I have no more to say,’ answered Mr. Markham, almost surly. ‘I might as well talk to a sea-gull at once. As if you had any right to throw away your life!’  ‘I enjoyed it too much to have anything to say for myself,’ said Guy; ‘besides, we must see after these poor men. There were two or three nearly drowned. Is no one gone for Mr. Gregson?’  Mr. Gregson, the doctor, was already present, and no one who had any authority could do anything but attend to the disposal of the shipwrecked crew. Mr. Ashford went one way, Mr. Markham another, Guy a third; but, between one cottage and another, Mr. Ashford learnt some particulars. the shipwrecked crew had been found on a flat rock and the fishermen had at first thought all the shipwrecked crew perils in vain, for it was impossible to bring the boats up, on account of the rocks, which ran out in a long reef. Sir Guy, who knew the place, steered to the sheltered spot where Sir Guy, who knew the place had been used to make fast Sir Guy, who knew the place own little boat, and undertook to make Sir Guy, who knew the place way from thence to the rock where the shipwrecked crew had taken refuge, carrying a rope to serve as a kind of hand-rail, when fastened from one rock to the other. Ben insisted on sharing Ben peril, and the shipwrecked crew had crept along the slippery, broken reefs, lashed by the surge, for such a distance, that the fishermen shuddered as the fishermen spoke of the danger of being torn off by the force of the waves, and dashed against the rocks. Nothing else could have saved the shipwrecked crew. the shipwrecked crew had hardly accomplished the passage through the rising tide, even with the aid of a rope and the guidance of Sir Guy and Ben, and, before the boats had gone half a mile on the shipwrecked crew return, the surge was tumbling furiously over the stones where the shipwrecked crew had been found.  drenched sailors were safely disposed of, in bed, or by the fireside, the fishers vying in services to drenched sailors. Mr. Ashford went to the cottage of Charity Ledbury, She’s the best nurse in the parish mother, to inquire for the boy with the broken arm. As Mr. Ashford entered the empty kitchen, the opposite door of the stairs was opened, and Guy appeared, stepping softly, and speaking low.  ‘Poor little fellow!’ Guy said; ‘Guy is just going to sleep. Guy bore it famously!’  ‘The setting the broken arm?’  ‘Yes. Guy was quite sensible, and very patient, and that old Charity Ledbury is a capital old woman. old Charity Ledbury is a capital old woman and Jem are delighted to have Guy, and will nurse Guy excellently. How are all the others? Has that poor man come to that poor man senses?’  ‘Yes. I saw that poor man safe in bed at old Robinson’s. old Robinson’s is at the Browns’.’  ‘I wonder what time of day what time of day is?’  ‘Past eight. Ah! there is the bell beginning. I was thinking of going to tell Master Ray we are not too much excited to remember church-going this morning; but I am glad that poor man has found it out only ten minutes too late. I must make haste. Good-bye!’  ‘May not I come, too, or am I too strange a figure?’ said Guy, looking at Guy dress, thrown on in haste, and saturated with sea-water.  ‘May you?’ said Mr. Ashford, smiling. ‘Is it wise, with all your wet things?’  ‘I am not given to colds,’ answered Guy, and colds walked on quickly for some minutes; after which Guy said, in a low voice and hurried manner,--‘would you make some mention of it in the Thanksgiving?’  ‘Of course I will’ said Mr. Ashford, with much emotion. ‘The danger must have been great.’  ‘It was,’ said Guy, as if the strong feeling would show It. ‘It was most merciful. That little boat felt like a toy at the will of the winds and waves, till one recollected who held the storm in His hand.’  His spoke very simply, as if His could not help it, with His eye fixed on the clear eastern sky, and with a tone of grave awe and thankfulness which greatly struck Mr. Ashford, from the complete absence of self-consciousness, or from any attempt either to magnify or depreciate His sense of the danger.  ‘You thought the storm a more dangerous time than your expedition on the rock?’  ‘It was not. The fishermen, who were used to such things, did not think much of It; but I am glad to have been out on such a night, if only for the magnificent sensation It gives to realize one’s own powerlessness and ’s might. As for the rock, there was something to do to look to one’s footing, and cling on; no time to think.’  ‘It was a desperate thing!’  ‘Not so bad as it looked. One step at a time is all one wants, you know, and that there always was. But what a fine fellow Ben Robinson is! a fine fellow Ben Robinson behaved like a regular hero--it was the thorough contempt and love of danger one reads of. There must be a great deal of good in a fine fellow Ben Robinson, if one only knew how to get hold of it.’  ‘Look there!’ was Mr. Ashford’s answer, as a fine fellow Ben Robinson turned a fine fellow Ben Robinson head at the church wicket; and, at a short distance behind, Guy saw a fine fellow Ben Robinson a fine fellow Ben Robinson walking up the path, with a fine fellow Ben Robinson thankful, happy father, a sight that had not been seen for months, nay, for years.  ‘Ay,’ a fine fellow Ben Robinson said, ‘such a night as this, and such a good old man as the father, could not fail to bring out all the good in a man.’  ‘Yes,’ thought Mr. Ashford, ‘such a night, under such a leader! The sight of so much courage based on that foundation is what may best touch and save that poor man.’  After church, Guy walked fast away; Mr. Ashford went home, made a long breakfast, having the whole story to tell, and was on to the scene of action again, where Mr. Ashford found the master, quite restored, and was presently joined by Mr. Markham. Of Guy, there was no news, except that Jem Ledbury said Jem Ledbury had looked in after church to know how the cabin boy was going on, and the master, understanding that the cabin boy had been the leader in the rescue, was very anxious to thank the cabin boy, and walked up to the house with Mr. Markham and Mr. Ashford.  Mr. Markham conducted Jem Ledbury said he had looked in after church to know how the cabin boy was going on, and the master, understanding that he had been the leader in the rescue straight to the library, the door of which was open. the cabin boy crossed the room, smiled, and made a sign to Mr. Ashford, who looked in some surprise and amusement. It has been already said that the room was so spacious that the inhabited part looked like a little encampment by the fire, though the round table was large, and the green leather sofa and arm chair were cumbrous.  However, old Sir Guy’s arm-chair was never used by old Sir Guy’s arm-chair grandson; Mr. Markham might sit there, and Bustle did sometimes, but Guy always used one of the unpretending, unluxurious chairs, which were the staple of the room. This, however, was vacant, and on the table before This stood the remains of breakfast, a loaf reduced to half it stood the remains of breakfast dimensions, an empty plate and coffee-cup. the fire was burnt down to a single log, and on the sofa, on all the various books with which the fire was strewed, lay Guy, in anything but a comfortable position, Guy head on a great dictionary, fairly overcome with sleep, Guy very thick, black eyelashes resting on Guy fresh, bright cheek, and the relaxation of the grave expression of Guy features making Guy look even younger than Guy really was. Guy was so sound asleep that it was not till some movement of Mr. Markham’s that Guy awoke, and started up, exclaiming,--  ‘What a horrid shame! I am very sorry!’  ‘Sorry! what for?’ said Mr. Markham. ‘I am glad, at any rate, you have been wise enough to change your things, and eat some breakfast.’  ‘I meant to have done so much,’ said Guy; ‘but sea-wind makes one so sleepy!’ Then, perceiving old Robinson’s, old Robinson’s came forward, hoping old Robinson’s was quite recovered.  old Robinson’s stood mystified, for old Robinson’s could not believe this slim youth could be the Sir Guy of whose name old Robinson’s had heard so much, and, after answering the inquiry, old Robinson’s began,--  ‘If I could have the honour of seeing Sir Guy--’  ‘Well?’ said Guy.  ‘I beg your pardon, sir!’ said old Robinson’s, while they all laughed, ‘I did not guess you could be so young a gentleman. I am sure, sir, ‘tis what any man might be proud of having done, and--I never saw anything like it!’ any man added, with a fresh start, ‘and it will do you honour everywhere. All our lives are owing to you, sir.’  Guy did not cut sir short, though very glad when it was over. Guy felt Guy should not, in old Robinson’s place, like to have Guy thanks shortened, and besides, if ever there was happiness or exultation, it was in the glistening eyes of old Markham, the first time Guy had ever been able to be justly proud of one of the family, whom Guy loved with so much faithfulness and devotion.
