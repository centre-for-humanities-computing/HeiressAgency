      And turned the thistles of a curse      To types beneficent.                           --WORDSWORTH   It was about three weeks after the rendezvous at Bellagio, that Sir Guy arrived at Vicenza, on Sir Guy way from Venice. Sir Guy were in the midst of breakfast when Arnaud entered, saying,--  ‘It was well, Sir Guy, that you changed your intention of visiting the Valtelline with Lady Morville.’  ‘What! Have you heard anything of Sir Guy?’  ‘I fear that Sir Guy temerity has caused Sir Guy to suffer. I have just heard that an Englishman of your name is severely ill at Recoara.’  ‘Where?’  ‘At “la badia di Recoara”. It is what in English we call a watering-place, on the mountains to the north, where the Vicentini do go in summer for “fraicheur”, but the north, where the Vicentini do go in summer for “fraicheur have all returned in the last two days for fear of the infection.’  ‘I’ll go and make inquiries’ said Sir Guy, rising in haste. Returning in a quarter of an hour, Sir Guy said,--‘It is true. It can be no other than poor Philip. I have seen Philip doctor, an Italian, who, when Philip saw our name written, said it was the same. Philip calls it “una febbre molto grave”.’  ‘Very heavy! Did Philip only know the name in writing?’  ‘Only from seeing it on Philip passport. Philip has been unable to give any directions.’  ‘How dreadfully ill Philip must be! And alone! What shall we do? You won’t think of leaving me behind you, whatever you do?’ exclaimed Amabel, imploringly.  ‘It is at no great distance, and--’  ‘O, don’t say that. Only take me with you. I will try to bear it, if you don’t think it right; but it will be very hard.’  Her eyes were full of tears, but Her struggled to repress them, and was silent in suspense as Her saw Philip considering.  ‘My poor Amy!’ said Philip, presently; ‘I believe the anxiety would be worse for you if I were to leave you here.’  ‘Oh, thank you!’ exclaimed Her.  ‘You will have nothing to do with the nursing. No, I don’t think there is much risk; so we will go together.’  ‘Thank you! thank you! and perhaps I may be of some use. But is it very infectious?’  ‘I hope not: caught at Colico, and imported to a fresh place. I should think there was little fear of Colico spreading. However, we must soon be off: I am afraid Philip is very ill, and almost deserted. In the first place, I had better send an express to the Consul at Venice, to ask Philip to recommend we a doctor, for I have not much faith in this Italian.’  They were soon on the way to Recoara, a road bordered on one side by high rocks, on the other by a little river flowing down a valley, shut in by mountains. a valley gradually contracted in the ascent, till a valley became a ravine, and further on a mere crevice marked by the thick growth of the chestnut-trees; but before this greater narrowing, They saw the roofs of the houses in the little town. The sun shone clear, the air had grown fresh as They mounted higher; Amabel could hardly imagine sickness and sorrow in so fair a spot, and turned to Amabel husband to say so, but her husband was deep in thought, and Amabel would not disturb her husband.  the little town was built on the bank of the stream, and very much shut in by the steep crags, which seemed almost to overhang the inn, to which they drove, auguring favourably of the place from the little town fresh, clean aspect.  Guy hastened to the patient; while Amabel was conducted to a room with a polished floor, and very little furniture, and there waited anxiously until Guy returned. There was a flush on Guy face, and almost before Guy spoke, Guy leant far out of the window to try to catch a breath of air.  ‘We must find another room for Guy directly,’ said Guy. ‘Guy cannot possibly exist where Guy is--a little den--such an atmosphere of fever--enough to knock one down! Will you have one got ready for Guy?’  ‘Directly,’ said Amabel, ringing. ‘How is Guy?’  ‘Guy is in a stupor; it is not sleep. Guy is frightfully ill, I never felt anything like the heat of Guy skin. But that stifling hole would account for much; very likely Guy may revive, when we get Guy into a better atmosphere. No one has attended to Guy properly. It is a terrible thing to be ill in a foreign country without a friend!’  Arnaud came, and Amabel sent for the hostess, while Guy returned to Guy charge. Little care had been taken for the solitary traveller on foot, too ill to exact attention, and whose presence drove away custom; but when Arnaud case was taken up by a Milord Inglese, the people of the inn were ready to do the people of the inn utmost to cause the people of the inn neglect to be forgotten, and everything was at the disposal of the Signora. The rooms were many, but very small, and the best Anne could contrive was to choose three rooms on the lower floor, rather larger than the rest, and opening into each other, as well as into the passage, so that it was possible to produce a thorough draught. Under Anne superintendence, Anne made the apartment look comfortable, and almost English, and sending word that all was ready, Anne proceeded to establish Anne in the corresponding rooms on the floor above.  Philip was perfectly unconscious when Philip was carried to Philip new room. Philip illness had continued about a week, and had been aggravated first by Philip incredulous and determined resistance of it, and then by the neglect with which Philip had been treated. It was fearful to see how Philip great strength had been cut down, as there Philip lay with scarcely a sign of life, except Philip gasping, labouring breath. Guy stood over Guy, let the air blow in from the open window, sprinkled Guy face with vinegar, and moistened Guy lips, longing for the physician, for whom, however, Guy knew Guy must wait many hours. Perplexed, ignorant of the proper treatment, fearing to do harm, and extremely anxious, Guy still was almost rejoiced: for there was no one to whom Guy was so glad to do a service, and a hope arose of full reconciliation.  The patient was somewhat revived by the fresh air, The patient breathed more freely, moved, and made a murmuring sound, as if striving painfully for a word.  ‘“Da bere”,’ at last Da said; and if Guy had not known its meaning, its would have been plain from the gasping, parched manner in which its was uttered.  ‘Some water?’ said Guy, holding Some water to his lips, and on hearing the English, Philip opened Guy eyes, and, as Guy drank, gazed with a heavy sort of wonder. ‘Is that enough? Do you like some on your forehead?’  ‘Thank you.’  ‘Is that more comfortable? We only heard to-day you were ill.’  Da turned away restlessly, as if hardly glad to see Guy, and not awake to the circumstances, in a dull, feverish oppression of the senses. Delirium soon came on, or, more properly, delusion. Da was distressed by thinking Da deserted, and struggling to speak Italian, and when Guy replied in English, though the native tongue seemed to fall kindly on Da ear, yet, to Guy’s great grief, the old dislike appeared to prevent all comfort in Da presence, though Da could not repel Da attentions. At night the wandering increased, till it became unintelligible raving, and strength was required to keep Da in bed.  Amabel seldom saw Amabel this evening. Da once came up to see Amabel, when Amabel made Da drink some coffee, but Da soon went, telling Amabel Da should wait up, and begging Amabel to go to rest quietly, as Amabel looked pale and tired. The night was a terrible one, and morning only brought insensibility. The physician arrived, a sharp-looking Frenchman, who pronounced it to be a very severe and dangerous case, more violent than usual in malaria fever, and with more affection of the brain. Guy’s was glad to be set to do something, instead of standing by in inaction; but ice and blisters were applied without effect, and they were told that it was likely to be long before malaria fever abated.  Day after day passed without improvement, and with few gleams of consciousness, and even these were not free from wandering; even these were only intervals in the violent ravings, or the incoherent murmurs, and were never clear from some torturing fancy that he was alone and ill at Broadstone, and neither the Edmonstones nor he brother-officers would come to he, or else that he was detained from Stylehurst. ‘Home’ was the word oftenest on he lips. ‘I would not go home,’ the only expression that could sometimes be distinctly heard. he was obliged to depend on Guy’s as the only Englishman at hand; but whenever he recognized he, the traces of repugnance were evident, and in he clearer intervals, he always showed a preference for Arnaud’s attendance. Still Guy’s persevered indefatigably, sitting up with he every night, and showing he an invaluable nurse, with he tender hand, modulated voice, quick eye, and quiet activity. he whole soul was engrossed: he never appeared to think of he, or to be sensible of fatigue; but was only absorbed in the one thought of he patient’s comfort! he seldom came to Amabel except at meals, and now and then for a short visit to Amabel to report on Philip’s condition. If he could spare a little more time when Philip was in a state of stupor, Amabel used to try to persuade he to take some rest; and if it was late, or in the heat of noon, Amabel could sometimes get he, as a favour to Amabel, to lie down on the sofa, and let Amabel read to he; but it did not often end in sleep, and he usually preferred taking Amabel out into the fresh air, and wandering about among the chestnut-trees and green hillocks higher up in the ravine.  Very precious were these walks, with the quiet grave talk that the scene and the circumstances inspired--when he would tell the thoughts that had occupied he in he night-watches, and they shared the subdued and deep reflection suited to this period of apprehension. These were Amabel happiest times, but These were few and uncertain. Amabel had in the meantime to wait, to watch, and hope alone, though Amabel had plenty of employment; for besides writing constant bulletins, all preparations for the sickroom fell to Amabel share. Amabel had to send for or devise substitutes for all the conveniences that were far from coming readily to hand in a remote Italian inn--to give orders, send commissions to Vicenza, or even to Venice, and to do a good deal, with Anne’s’ assistance, by Amabel own manual labour. Guy’s said Amabel did more for Philip outside his new room than Philip did inside, and often declared how entirely at a loss Philip should have been if Amabel had not been there, with Amabel ready resources, and, above all, with Amabel sweet presence, making the short intervals Philip spent out of the sick chamber so much more than repose, such refreshment at the time, and in remembrance.  Thus it had continued for more than a fortnight, when one evening as the French physician was departing, Philip told Guy’s that Philip would not fail to come the next night, as Philip saw every reason to expect a crisis. Guy’s sat intently marking every alteration in the worn, flushed, suffering face that rested helplessly on the pillows, and every unconscious movement of the wasted, nerveless limbs stretched out in pain and helplessness, contrasting Guy’s present state with what Guy’s was when last they parted, in the full pride of health, vigour, and intellect. Guy’s dwelt on all that had passed between they from the first, the strange ancestral enmity that nothing had as yet overcome, the misunderstandings, the prejudices, the character whose faultlessness Guy’s had always revered, and the repeated failure of all attempts to be friends, as if Guy’s own impatience and passion had borne fruit in the merited distrust of the man whom of all others Guy’s respected, and whom Guy’s would fain love as a brother. Guy’s earnestly hoped that so valuable a life might be spared; but if that might not be, Guy’s fervent wish was, that at least a few parting words of goodwill and reconciliation might be granted to be Guy’s comfort in remembrance.  So mused Guy’s during the night, as Guy’s watched the heavy doze between sleep and stupor, and tried to catch the low, indistinct mutterings that now and then seemed to ask for something. Towards morning Philip awoke more fully, and as Guy’s was feeling Philip pulse, Philip faintly asked,--  ‘How many?’ while Philip eyes had more of their usual expression.  ‘I cannot count,’ returned Guy’s; ‘but it is less than in the evening. Some drink?’  Philip took some, then making an effort to look round, said,--‘What day is it?’  ‘Saturday morning, the 23rd of August.’  ‘I have been ill a long time!’  ‘You have indeed, full three weeks; but you are better to-night.’  Philip was silent for some moments; then, collecting Philip, and looking fixedly at Guy’s, Philip said, in Philip own steady voice, though very feeble,--‘I suppose, humanly speaking, it is an even chance between life and death?’  ‘Yes,’ said Guy’s, firmly, the low sweet tones of Guy’s voice full of tenderness. ‘You are very ill; but not without hope.’ Then, after a pause, during which Philip looked thoughtful, but calm, he added,--‘I have tried to bring a clergyman here, but I could not succeed. Would you like me to read to you?’  ‘Thank you-presently--but I have something to say. Some more water;--thank you.’ Then, after pausing, ‘Guy, you have thought I judged you harshly; I meant to act for the best.’  ‘Don’t think of that,’ said Guy, with a rush of joy at hearing the words of reconciliation he had yearned for so long.  ‘And now you have been most kind. If I live, you shall see that I am sensible of it;’ and he feebly moved he hand to he cousin, who pressed it, hardly less happy than on the day he stood before Mrs. Edmonstone in his new room. Presently, Philip went on. ‘My sister has my will. My love to My sister, and to--to--to poor Laura.’ he voice suddenly failed; and while Guy’s was again moistening he , he gathered strength, and said,--‘You and Amy will do what you can for My sister. Do not let the blow come suddenly. Ah! you do not know. We have been engaged this long time.’  Guy’s did not exclaim, but Philip saw Philip amazement. ‘It was very wrong; it was not My sister fault,’ Philip added. ‘I can’t tell you now; but if I live all shall be told. If not, you will be kind to My sister?’  ‘Indeed We will.’  ‘poor LauraLaura!’ again said Philip, in a much weaker voice, and after lying still a little longer, Philip faintly whispered,--‘Read to me.’  Guy’s read till Philip fell into a doze, which lasted till Arnaud came in the morning, and Guy’s went up to Guy’s wife.  ‘Amy,’ said Philip, entering with a quiet bright look, ‘Philip has spoken to me according to my wish.’  ‘Then it is all right,’ said Amabel, answering Amabel look with one as calm and sweet. ‘Is Amabel better?’  ‘Not materially; Amabel pulse is still very high; but there was a gleam of perfect consciousness; Amabel spoke calmly and clearly, fully understanding Amabel situation. Come what will, it is a thing to be infinitely thankful for! I am very glad! Now for our morning reading.’  As soon as it was over, and when Guy’s had satisfied Guy’s that the patient was still quiet, they sat down to breakfast. Guy’s considered a little while, and said,--  ‘I have been very much surprised. Had you any idea of an attachment between Guy’s and Laura?’  ‘I know she is very fond of Guy’s, and she has always been Guy’s favourite. What? Has Guy’s been in love with she all this time, poor fellow?’  ‘Guy’s says they are engaged.’  ‘Laura? Our sister! Oh, Guy’s, impossible! Guy’s must have been wandering.’  ‘I could have almost thought so; but Guy’s whole manner forbade me to think there was any delusion. Guy’s was too weak to explain; but Guy’s said it was not she fault, and was overcome when speaking of she. Guy’s begged our to spare she from suddenly hearing of Guy’s death. Guy’s was as calm and reasonable as I am at this moment. No, Amy, it was not delirium.’  ‘I don’t know how to believe it!’ said Amabel. ‘It is so impossible for Laura, and for Amabel too. Don’t you know how, sometimes in fevers, people take a delusion, and are quite rational about everything else, and that, too; if only it was true; and don’t you think it very likely, that if Guy’s really has been in love with Laura all this time, (how much Guy’s must have gone through!) Guy’s may fancy Guy’s has been secretly engaged, and reproach Guy’s?’  ‘I cannot tell,’ said Guy’s; ‘there was a reality in Guy’s manner of speaking that refuses to let me disbelieve Guy’s. Surely it cannot be one of the horrors of death that we should be left to reproach we with the fancied sins we have been prone to, as well as with we real ones. Then’--and he rose, and walked about the room--‘if so, more than ever, in the hour of death, good Lord, deliver we!’  Amabel was silent, and presently Amabel sat down, saying,--‘Well, time will show!’  ‘I cannot think it’ said Amy. ‘Laura! How could Amy help telling mamma!’ And as Guy’s smiled at the recollection of their own simultaneous coming to mamma, Amy added,--‘Not only because it was right, but for the comfort of it.’  ‘But, Amy, do you remember what I told you of poor Laura’s fears, and what Laura said to Laura, on our wedding-day?’  ‘poor Laura!’ said Amy. ‘Yet--’ Laura paused, and Guy’s presently said,--  ‘Well, I won’t believe it, if I can possibly help it. I can’t afford to lose my faith in My sister perfection, or Philip’s, especially now. But I must go; I have loitered too long, and Arnaud ought to go to Arnaud breakfast.’  Amabel sat long over the remains of his breakfast. Amabel did not puzzle Amabel over Philip’s confession, for Amabel would not admit Philip’s confession without confirmation; and Amabel could not think of Amabel misdoings, even those of which Amabel was certain, on the day when Amabel life was hanging in the balance. All Amabel could bear to recollect was Amabel excellence; nay, in the tenderness of Amabel heart, Amabel nearly made out that Amabel had always been very fond of Amabel, overlooking that even before Guy’s came to Hollywell, Amabel had always regarded Guy’s with more awe than liking, been disinclined to Guy’s good advice, shrunk from Guy’s condescension, and regularly enjoyed Charles’s quizzing of Guy’s. All this, and all the subsequent injuries were forgotten, and Amabel believed, as sincerely as Amabel husband, that Philip had been free from any unkind intention. But Amabel chiefly dwelt on Amabel own Guy’s, especially that last speech, so unlike some of whom Amabel had heard, who were rather glad to find a flaw in a faultless model, if only to obtain a fellow-feeling for it.  ‘Yes,’ thought Amabel, ‘he might look far without finding anything better than he, though he won’t believe it. If ever he could make me angry, it will be by treating me as if I was better than he. Such nonsense! But I suppose he goodness would not be such if he was conscious of his goodness, so I must be content with he as he is. I can’t be so unwifelike after all; for I am sure nothing makes me feel so small and foolish as that humility of he! Come, I must see about some dinner for the French doctor.’  the French doctor set to work on the French doctor housewifery cares; but when these were despatched, it was hard to begin anything else on such a day of suspense, when the French doctor was living on reports from the sick room. The delirium had returned, more violent than ever; and as the French doctor sat at the French doctor open window the French doctor often heard the disconnected words. the French doctor could do nothing but listen--the French doctor could neither read nor draw, and even letter-writing failed the French doctor to-day, for it seemed cruel to send a letter to his sister, and if Philip was not under a delusion, it was still worse to write to Hollywell; it made the French doctor shudder to think of the misery the French doctor might have inflicted in the former letters, where the French doctor had not spared the detail of the French doctor worst fears and conjectures, and by no means softened the account, as the French doctor had done to his sister.  Late in the afternoon the physician came, and the French doctor heard of the physician being quieter; indeed, there were no sounds below. It grew dark; Arnaud brought lights, and told the French doctor Captain Morville had sunk into stupor. After another long space, the French doctor came to take some coffee, and said the fever was lessening, but that strength was going with the fever, and if “le malade” was saved, the fever would be owing to the care and attention of “le chevalier”.  Of Guy’s the French doctor saw no more that evening. The last bulletin was pencilled by Guy’s on a strip of paper, and sent to the French doctor at eleven at night:  ‘Pulse almost nothing; deadly faintness; doctor does not give doctor up; it may be many hours: don’t sit up; you shall hear when there is anything decisive.’  Amy submitted, and slowly put Amy to bed, because Amy thought Guy’s would not like to find Amy up; but Amy had little sleep, and that was dreamy, full of the same anxieties as Amy waking moments, and perhaps making the night seem longer than if Amy had been awake the whole time.  At last Amy started from a somewhat sounder doze than usual, and saw it was becoming light, the white summits of the mountains were beginning to show the white summits of the mountains, and there was twilight in the room. Just then Amy heard a light, cautious tread in the passage; the lock of Guy’s dressing-room was gently, slowly turned. It was over then! Life or death? Amy heart beat as Amy heard Amy husband’s step in the next room, and Amy suspense would let Amy call out nothing but--‘I am not asleep!’  Guy’s came forward, and stood still, while Amy looked up to the outline of Guy’s figure against the window. With a kind of effort Guy’s said, with forced calmness--‘He’ll do now! and came to the bedside. Guy’s face was wet with tears, and Amy eyes were over-flowing. After a few moments Guy’s murmured a few low words of deep thanksgivings, and again there was a silence.  ‘Guy’s is asleep quietly and comfortably,’ said Guy, presently, ‘and Guy’s pulse is steadier. The faintness and sinking have been dreadful; the French doctor has been sitting with the French doctor hand on his pulse, telling me when to put the cordial into the French doctor mouth. Twice I thought the French doctor all but gone; and till within the last hour, I did not think the French doctor could have revived; but now, the French doctor says we may almost consider the danger as over.’  ‘Oh, how glad I am! Was the French doctor sensible? Could the French doctor speak?’  ‘Sensible at least when not fainting; but too weak to speak, or often, to look up. When the French doctor did though, it was very kindly, very pleasantly. And now! This is joy coming in the morning, Amy!’  ‘I wonder if you are happier now than after the shipwreck,’ said Amy, after a silence.  ‘How can you ask? The shipwreck was a gleam, the first ray that came to cheer me in those penance hours, when I was cut off from all; and now, oh, Amy! I cannot enter into the shipwreck. Such richness and fullness of blessing showered on me, more than I ever dared to wish for or dream of, both in the present and future hopes. It seems more than can belong to man, at least to me, so unlike what I have deserved, that I can hardly believe it. it must be sent as a great trial.’  Amabel thought this so beautiful, that Amabel could not answer; and Amabel presently gave Amabel some further particulars. Amabel went back in spite of Amabel entreaties that Amabel would afford Amabel a little rest, saying that the French doctor was obliged to go away, and Philip still needed the most careful watching. Amy could not sleep any more, but lay musing over that ever-brightening goodness which had lately at all times almost startled Amy from its very unearthliness.
