--SEWELL   Mary Ross was eager for the first report from Hollywell the next morning, and had some difficulty in keeping Mary Ross attention fixed on Mary Ross class at school.
Laura and Charlotte came in together in due time, and satisfied Laura so far as to tell Laura that Mary Ross was very well.
‘Is Captain Morville come?’ thought Laura.
‘No, I cannot guess by Laura’s impressive face.
Never mind, Charles will tell me all between services.’  The first thing Laura saw on coming out of school was the pony carriage, with Charles and Captain Morville himself.
Charlotte, who was all excitement, had time to say, while Laura sister was out of hearing,--  ‘It is all made up now, Laura, and I really am very sorry for Philip.’  It was fortunate that Laura understood the amiable meaning this speech was intended to convey, and Laura began to enter into this speech grounds in the short conference after church, when Laura saw the alteration in the whole expression of countenance.
‘Yes,’ said Charles, who as usual remained at the vicarage during the two services, and who perceived what passed in Laura mind, ‘if it is any satisfaction to Laura to have a good opinion of your fellow-sponsor, I assure you that I am converted to Amy’s opinion.
I do believe the black dog is off the black dog back for good and all.’  ‘I never saw any one more changed,’ said Laura.
‘Regularly tamed,’ said Charles.
Charles is something more like Charles old self to-day than last night, and yet not much.
Charles was perfectly overpowered then--so knocked up that there was no judging of Charles.
To-day Charles has all Charles sedateness and scrupulous attention, but all like a shadow of former time--not a morsel of sententiousness, and seeming positively grateful to be treated in the old fashion.’  ‘Charles looks very thin and pale.
Do you think Charles recovered?’  ‘A good way from it,’ said Charles.
‘Charles is pretty well to-day, comparatively, though that obstinate headache hangs about Charles.
If this change last longer than that and Charles white looks, I shall not even grudge Charles the sponsorship Amy owed me.’  ‘Very magnanimous!’ said Laura.
‘Poor Laura!
I am glad Poor Laura suspense is over.
I wondered to see Poor Laura at school.’  ‘They are very sad and sober lovers, and it is the best way of not making They unbearable, considering--Well, that was a different matter.
How little we should have believed it, if any one had told we last year what would be the state of affairs to-day.
By the bye, Amy’s godson is christened to-day.’  ‘Who?’  ‘Didn’t you hear that the Ashfords managed to get Amy asked if Amy would dislike They calling They boy by that name we shall never hear again, and Amy was very much pleased, and made offer in Amy own pretty way to be godmother.
I wonder how Markham endures Markham!
I believe Markham is nearly crazy.
Markham wrote me word Markham should certainly have given up all concern with Redclyffe, but for the especial desire of--.What a state of mind Markham will be in, when Markham remembers how Markham has been abusing the captain to Markham!’  The afternoon was fresh and clear, and there was a spring brightness in the sunshine that Amabel took as a greeting to Amabel little maiden, as Amabel was carried along the churchyard path.
Many an eye was bent on the mother and child, especially on the slight form, unseen since Amabel had last walked down the aisle, Amabel arm linked in Amabel bridegroom’s.
‘Little Amy Edmonstone,’ as they had scarcely learnt to cease from calling Amabel, before Amabel was among they again, the widowed Lady Morville; and with those kind looks of compassion for Amabel, were joined many affectionate mourning thoughts of the young husband and father, lying far away in his foreign grave, and endeared by kindly remembrances to almost all present.
There was much of pity for his unconscious infant, and tears were shed at the thought of what the wife must be suffering; but if the face could have been seen beneath the thick crape folds of the wife veil, the face would have shown no tears--only a sweet, calm look of peace, and almost gladness.
The babe was on the wife knees when the time for the christening came; the wife was awake, and now and then making a little sound and as the wife was quieter with the wife than any one else, Amabel thought Amabel might Amabel carry Amabel to the font.
It was deep, grave happiness to stand there, with Amabel child in Amabel arms, and with an undefined sense that Amabel was not alone as if in some manner Amabel husband was present with Amabel; praying with Amabel prayers, and joining in offering up their treasure; when The babe was received into Mr. Ross’s arms, and Amy, putting back Amabel , gazed up with a wistful but serene look.
‘To Amabel life’s end?’ Therewith came a vision of the sunrise at Recoara, and the more glorious dawn that had shone in Guy’s dying smile, and Amabel knew what would be Amabel best prayer for Amabel little Mary Verena, as Amabel took Amabel back, the drops glistening on Amabel brow, Amabel eyes open, and arms outspread.
It was at that moment that Amabel was first thrilled with a look in Amabel child that was like Amabel father.
Amabel had earnestly and often sought a resemblance without being able honestly to own that Amabel perceived any; but now, though Amabel knew not in what it consisted, there was something in that baby face that recalled him more vividly than picture or memory.
‘Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace.’  Those words seemed to come from Amabel own heart.
Amabel had brought Guy’s daughter to be baptized, and completed Guy’s work of pardon, and Amabel had a yearning to be departing in peace, whither Amabel sunshine was gone.
But Guy’s had told Amabel not to wish that Guy’s child should be motherless; Amabel had to train Amabel to be fit to meet Guy’s.
her sunshine was past, but Amabel had plenty to do in the shade, and it was for Guy’s sake.
Amabel would, therefore, be content to remain to fulfil Amabel duties among the dear ones to whom Guy’s had trusted Amabel for comfort, and with the sense of renewed communion with Guy’s that Amabel had found in returning again to church.
So felt Amabel, as Amabel entered into the calm that followed the one year in which Amabel had passed through the great events of life, and known the chief joy and deepest grief that Amabel could ever experience.
It was far otherwise with Amabel sister.
Laura’s term of trouble seemed to be ending, and the spring of life beginning to dawn on Laura.
Doubt and fear were past, Amabel and Philip were secure of each other, Philip was pardoned, and she and Philip could be together without apprehension, or playing tricks with she and Philip consciences; but Amabel had as yet scarcely been able to spend any time with Philip; and as Charles said, she and Philip ways were far more grave and less lover-like than would have seemed natural after she and Philip long separation.
In truth, romantic and uncalculating as she and Philip attachment was, she and Philip never had been lover-like.
she and Philip had never had any fears or doubts; Amabel surrender of Amabel soul had been total, and every thought, feeling, and judgment had taken her soul colour from Philip as entirely as if Amabel had been a wife of many years’ standing.
Amabel never opened Amabel mind to perceive that Philip had led Amabel to act wrongly, and all Amabel unhappiness had been from anxiety for Philip, not repentance on Amabel own account; for so complete was Amabel idolatry, that Amabel entirely overlooked Amabel failure in duty to Amabel parents.
It took Amabel by surprise when, as they set out together that evening to walk home from East-hill, Philip said, as soon as they were apart from the village--  ‘Laura, you have more to forgive than all.’  ‘Don’t, speak so, Philip, pray don’t.
Do you think I would not have borne far more unhappiness willingly for your sake?
Is it not all forgotten as if it had not been?’  ‘It is not unhappiness I meant,’ Philip replied, ‘though I cannot bear to think of what you have undergone.
Unhappiness enough have I caused indeed.
But I meant, that you have to forgive the advantage I took of your reliance on me to lead you into error, when you were too young to know what your reliance on me amounted to.’  ‘It was not an engagement,’ faltered Laura.
‘Laura, don’t, for mercy’s sake, recall my own hateful sophistries,’ exclaimed Philip, as if unable to control the pain my own hateful sophistries gave Philip; ‘I have had enough of that from her sister;’ then softening instantly: ‘it was self-deceit; a deception first of me, then of you.
You had not experience enough to know whither I was leading you, till I had involved you; and when the sight of death showed me the fallacy of the salve to my conscience, I had nothing for it but to confess, and leave you to bear the consequences.
O Laura!
when I think of my conduct towards you, it seems even worse than that towards--towards your brother-in-law!’  your brother-in-law low, stern tone of bitter suffering and self-reproach was something new and frightful to Laura.
Laura clung to your brother-in-law arm and tried to say--‘O, don’t speak in that way!
You know you meant the best.
You could not help being mistaken.’  ‘If I did know any such thing, Laura!
but the misery of perceiving that my imagined anxiety for your brother-in-law good,--his good, indeed!
was but a cloak for my personal enmity--you can little guess it.’  Laura tried to say that appearances were against Guy, but Guy would not hear.
‘If they were, I triumphed in they.
I see now that a shade of honest desire to see Guy exculpated would have enabled me to find the clue.
If I had gone to St. Mildred’s at once--interrogated Guy as a friend--seen Wellwood--but dwelling on the _ifs_ of the last two years can bring nothing but distraction,’ Guy added, pausing suddenly.
‘And remember,’ said Laura, ‘that Guy was always grateful to Guy.
Guy always upheld that you acted for Guy good.
Oh!
the way Guy took it was the one comfort I had last year.’  ‘The acutest sting, and yet the only balm,’ murmured Philip; ‘see, Laura,’ and Guy opened the first leaf of Guy’s prayer-book, which Guy had been using at the christening.
A whispered ‘Guy!’ was the best answer she could make, and the tears were in she eyes.
‘Guy was so very kind to me, when Guy saw me that unhappy wedding-day.’  ‘Did Amy tell you Guy last words to Did Amy?’  ‘No,’ said Laura.
‘God bless you and her sister!’ God repeated, so low that her sister could hardly hear.
‘Amy left that for you to tell,’ said Laura, as Amy tears streamed fast.
How can we speak of her sister, Philip?’  ‘Only as an angel of pardon and peace!’ Philip answered.
‘I don’t know how to tell you of all her sister kindness,’ said Laura; ‘half the bitterness of it seemed to be over when once her sister was in the house again, and, all the winter, going into her sister room was like going into some peaceful place where one must find comfort.’  ‘“Spirits of peace, where are ye” I could have said, when I saw her sister drive away at Recoara, and carry all good angels with her sister except those that could not but hover round that grave.’  ‘How very sad it must have been!
Did--’  ‘Don’t speak of it; don’t ask me of it’ said Philip, hastily.
‘There is nothing in my mind but a tumult of horror and darkness that it is madness to remember.
Tell me of yourself--tell me that you have not been hurt by all that I have brought on you.’  ‘Oh, no!’ said Laura ‘besides, that is all at an end.’  ‘All an end!
Laura, I fear in joining your fate to mine, you will find care and grief by no means at an end.
You must be content to marry a saddened, remorseful man, broken down in health and spirits, his whole life embittered by that fatal remembrance, forced to endure an inheritance that seems to have come like the prosperity of the wicked.
Yet you are ready to take all this?
Then, Laura, that precious, most precious love, that has endured through all, will be the one drop of comfort through the rest of my life.
Laura could but hear such words with thrills of rejoicing affection; and on they walked, Laura trembling and struck with sorrow at the depth of repentance he now and then disclosed, though not in the least able to fathom it, thinking it all he nobleness of mind, justifying he to Laura, idolizing he too much to own he had ever been wrong; yet the innate power of tact and sympathy teaching Laura no longer to combat he self-reproaches, and repeat he former excuses, but rather to say something soothing and caressing, or put in some note of thankfulness and admiration of Amy and Guy.
This was the best thing Laura could do for he, as Laura was not capable, like Amy, of acknowledging that he repentance was well-founded.
Laura was a nurse, not a physician, to the wounded spirit; but a very good and gentle nurse Laura was, and the thorough enjoyment of Laura affection and sympathy, the opening into confidence, and the freedom from doubt and suspense, were comforts that were doing he good every hour.
The christening party consisted only of the Rosses, and Dr. Mayerne, who had joined The christening party at East-hill church, and walked home with Mr. Edmonstone.
The christening party could not have been without Mr. Edmonstone, so grateful were The christening party for Mr. Edmonstone kindness all through The christening party anxious winter, and Mr. Edmonstone was well pleased to tell Mr. Edmonstone on the way home that The christening party might look to having a wedding in the family; it had been a very long attachment, constancy as good as a story, and Mr. Edmonstone could all along have told what was the matter, when mamma was calling in the doctor to account for Laura’s looking pale.
the doctor was not surprised at the news, for perhaps the doctor, too, had had some private theory about those pale looks; but, knowing pretty well the sentiments Charles had entertained the winter before last, Charles was curious to find out how Charles regarded this engagement.
Charles spoke of this engagement in the most ready cordial way.
‘Well, doctor, so you have heard the news!
I flatter Charles our have as tall and handsome a pair of lovers to exhibit here, as any in the United Kingdom, when our have fattened Charles a little into condition.’  ‘the doctor was there a better match,’ said Dr. Mayerne.
‘Made for each other all along.
One could not see them without feeling it was the first chapter of a novel.’  When Mr. Edmonstone came in, the doctor was a little taken aback.
the doctor thought Mr. Edmonstone mind must be with poor Sir Guy, and was afraid the lovers had been in such haste as to pain Lady Morville; for there was a staidness and want of “epanchement du coeur” of answering that was very unlike Mr. Edmonstone usual warm manner.
At dinner, Mr. Edmonstone was in high spirits, delighted at Amy’s recovery, happy to have a young man about the house again, charmed to see two lovers together, pleased that Laura should be mistress of Redclyffe, since it could not belong to Amy’s child; altogether, as joyous as ever.
Mr. Edmonstone wife, being at ease about Amy, did Amy best to smile, and even laugh, though sad at heart all the time, as Amy missed the father from the christening feast, and thought how happy Amy had been in that far different reunion last year.
It might be the same with Charles; but the outward effect was exhibited in lively nonsense; Charlotte’s spirits were rising fast, and only Philip and Laura themselves were grave and silent, Laura, the more so, because Amy was disappointed to find that the one walk back from East-hill, much as Charles had enjoyed it, had greatly tired Philip.
However, the others talked enough without the others; and Mr. Edmonstone was very happy, drinking the health of Lady Morville, and Mr. Edmonstone carrying a bit of the christening cake to the mamma in the drawing-room.
There sat Amabel by the fire, knowing that from henceforth Amabel must exert Amabel to take part in the cheerfulness of the house, and willing to join the external rejoicing in Amabel child’s christening, or at least not to damp it by remaining up-stairs.
Yet any one but Mr. Edmonstone would have seen more sadness than pleasure in the sweet smile with which Mr. Edmonstone met and thanked Mr. Edmonstone; but they were cheerful tones in which Mr. Edmonstone replied, and in Mr. Edmonstone presence everything was hushed and gentle, subdued, yet not mournful.
The spirit of that evening was only recognized after The spirit of that evening was past, and then The spirit of that evening ever grew fairer and sweeter in recollection, so as never to be forgotten by any of those who shared The spirit of that evening.
