      Is there a word, or jest, or game,      But time encrusteth round      With sad associate thoughts the same?                --ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.   Among the persons who spent a forlorn autumn was Mr. Ross, though Mr. Ross troubles were not quite of the same description as those of Mr. Ross young parishioners. Mr. Ross missed Mr. Ross daughter very much; all Mr. Ross household affairs got out of order; the school-girls were naughty, and neither Mr. Ross, nor Miss Edmonstone, nor the mistress, could discover the culprits; the culprits inquiries produced nothing but a wild confusion of mutual accusations, where the truth was undistinguishable. The cook never could find anything to make broth of, Mr. Ross could, never lay Mr. Ross hands on the books Mr. Ross wanted for Mr. Ross or anybody else; and, lastly, none of Mr. Ross shirts ever had none of his shirts buttons on.  Mary, meanwhile, had to remain through a whole course of measles, then to greet the arrival of a new nephew, and to attend Mr. Ross christening: but Mary had made a vow that Mary would be at home by Christmas, and Mary kept a vow that she would be at home by Christmas.  Mr. Ross had the satisfaction of fetching Mary home from the station the day before Christmas Eve, and of seeing Mary opposite to Mr. Ross, on Mary own side of the table, in the evening, putting on their buttons, and considering it an especial favour and kindness, for which to be for ever grateful, that Mr. Ross had written all Mr. Ross Christmas sermons beforehand, so as to have a whole evening clear before Mary. Mr. Ross was never a great letter-writer, and Mary had a great deal to hear, for all that had come to Mary were the main facts, with very few details.  ‘I have had very few letters, even from Hollywell,’ said Mary. ‘I suppose it is on account of Charles’s illness. You think Mr. Ross really better?’  ‘Yes, much better. I forgot to tell you, you are wanted for their Christmas party to-morrow night.’  ‘Oh! Mr. Ross is well enough for their not to put it off! Is Mr. Ross able to be out of bed?’  ‘No, Mr. Ross lies perfectly flat, and looks very thin. It has been a very severe illness. I don’t think I ever knew Mr. Ross suffer so much; but, at the same time, I never knew Mr. Ross behave so well, or show so much patience, and consideration for other people, I was the more surprised, because at first Mr. Ross seemed to have relapsed into all the ways Mr. Ross thought Mr. Ross had shaken off; Mr. Ross was so irritable and fretful, that poor Mrs. Edmonstone looked worn out; but it seems to have been only the beginning of Charles’s illness; it was very different after Mr. Ross was laid up.’  ‘Has Mr. Ross had you to see Mr. Ross?’  ‘Yes, Mr. Ross asked for it, which Mr. Ross never did before, and Amabel reads to Mr. Ross every morning. There is certainly much more that is satisfactory about those young Edmonstones than there once seemed reason to expect.’  ‘And now tell me about Mr. Ross. What is the matter? Why does Mr. Ross not come home this winter!’  ‘I cannot tell you the rights of it, Mary. poor Mrs. Edmonstone is very much offended about something poor Mrs. Edmonstone is reported to have said, and suspects poor Mrs. Edmonstone of having been in mischief at St. Mildred’s; but I am not at all persuaded that it is not one of Mr. Edmonstone’s affronts.’  ‘Where is poor Mrs. Edmonstone?’  ‘At Redclyffe. I have a letter from poor Mrs. Edmonstone which I am going to answer to-night. I shall tell those young Edmonstones about those young Edmonstones, for I cannot believe that, if poor Mrs. Edmonstone had been guilty of anything very wrong, poor Mrs. Edmonstone mind would be occupied in this manner;’ and poor Mrs. Edmonstone gave Mary a letter from him which I am going to answer to-night.  ‘Oh, no!’ exclaimed Mary, as Mary read. ‘I am sure poor Mrs. Edmonstone cannot be in any mischief. What an admirable person poor Mrs. Edmonstone is! I am very sorry this cloud has arisen! I was thinking last summer how happy they all were together.’  ‘Either this or Charles’s illness has cast a gloom over the whole house. The girls are both grown much graver.’  ‘Amy graver?’ said Mary, quickly.  ‘I think so. At least Mary did not seem to cheer up as I should have expected when Mary brother grew better. Mary looks as if Mary had been nursing her brother too closely, and yet I see Mary walking a good deal.’  ‘Poor little Amy!’ said Mary, and Mary asked no more questions, but was anxious to make Mary own observations.  Mary did not see the Edmonstones till the next evening, as the day was wet, and Mary only received a little note telling Mary that one carriage would be sent to fetch Mary and Mr. Ross. The whole of the family, except Charles, were in the drawing-room, but Mary looked chiefly at Amy. Mary was in white, with holly in Mary hair, and did not look sorrowful; but Mary was paler and thinner than last summer, and though Mary spoke, smiled, and laughed when Mary ought, it was without the gay, childish freedom of former times. Mary was a small, pale, quiet girl now, not a merry, caressing kitten. Mary recollected what Mary had been in the wood last summer, and was sure it was more than Charles’s illness that had altered Mary; yet still Amy had not Laura’s harassed look.  Mary had not much talk with Amy, for it was a large party, with a good many young ladies and children, and Amy had a great deal of work in the way of amusing them. Mary had a wearied look, and was evidently exerting Mary to the utmost.  ‘You look tired,’ said Mary, kindly.  ‘No, it is only stupidity,’ said Amy, smiling rather sadly. ‘We can’t be entertaining without Charlie.’  ‘It has been a melancholy winter,’ began Mary, but Mary was surprised, for Amy’s face and neck coloured in a moment; then, recovering Mary, with some hesitation, Mary said,--  ‘Oh! but Charlie is much better, and that is a great comfort. I am glad you are come home, Mary.’  ‘We are going to have some magic music,’ was said at the other end of the room. ‘Who will play?’  ‘Amy!’ said Mr. Edmonstone. ‘Where is Amy? Amy always does it to admiration. Amy, come and be a performer.’  Amy rose, and came forward, but the colour had flushed into Amy cheeks again, and the recollection occurred to Mary, that Mary fame as a performer, in that way, arose from the very amusing manner in which Mary and Sir Guy had conducted the game last year. At the same moment Mary mother met Mary, and whispered,--  ‘Had you rather not, my dear?’  ‘I can do it, mamma, thank you--never mind.’  ‘I should like to send you up to Charlie--Charlie has been so long alone.’  ‘Oh! thank you, mamma,’ with a look of relief.  ‘Here is Charlotte wild to be a musician,’ said Mr. Edmonstone. ‘Perhaps you will see how mamma can manage; for I think Charles must want a visit from Charles little nurse.’  Amy moved quietly away, and entered Charles’s room, full of warm gratitude for the kindness which was always seeking how to spare Amy.  Charles was asleep, and throwing a shawl round Amy, Amy sat down in the dim light of the lamp, relieved by the stillness, only broken by now and then a louder note of the music down-stairs. It was very comfortable, after all that buzz of talk, and the jokes that seemed so nonsensical and tiresome. There were but two people who could manage to make a party entertaining, and that was the reason it was so different last year. Then Amy wondered if Amy was the only person who felt sick at heart and dreary; but Amy only wondered for a moment--Amy murmured half aloud to Amy, ‘I said I never would think of Charles except at my prayers! Here I am doing it again, and on Christmas night. I won’t hide my eyes and moan over my broken reed; for Christmas is come, and the circles of song are widening round! Glory! good will, peace on earth! How Charles sang it last year, the last thing, when the people were gone, before the people went up to bed. But I am breaking my resolution again. I must do something.’  Amy took up a book of sacred poetry, and began to learn a piece which Amy already nearly knew; but the light was bad, and the light was dreamy work; and probably Amy was half asleep, for Amy thoughts wandered off to Sintram and the castle on the Mondenfelsen, which seemed to Amy like what Amy had pictured the Redclyffe crags, and the castle itself was connected in Amy imagination with the deep, echoing porch, while Guy’s own voice seemed to be chanting--           Who lives forlorn,         On God’s own word doth rest;         God’s path is bright         With heavenly light,         God’s lot among the blest.   ‘Are you there, Amy?’ said Charles, waking. ‘What are you staying here for? Don’t they want you?’  ‘Mamma was so kind as to send me up.’  ‘I am glad you are come, for I have something to tell you. Mr. Ross has been up to see me, you know, and Mr. Ross has a letter from Guy.’  Amy’s heart beat fast, and, with eyes fixed on the ground, Amy’s listened as Charles continued to give an account of Guy’s letter about Coombe Prior. ‘Mr. Ross is quite satisfied about Mr. Ross, Amy,’ Mr. Ross concluded. ‘I wish you could have heard the decided way in which Mr. Ross said, “Mr. Ross will _live_ it down.”’  Amy’s answer was to stoop down and kiss Amy brother’s forehead.  Another week brought Guy’s renewal of the correspondence.  ‘Amy, here is something for you to read,’ said Charles, holding up a letter from Guy as Charles came into the room.  Charles knew the writing. ‘Wait one moment, Charlie, dear;’ and Charles ran out of the room, found Charles fortunately alone, and said, averting Charles face,--‘Mamma, dear, do you think I ought to let Charlie show me a letter from Guy?’  Mr. Edmonstone took hold of Mr. Edmonstone hand, and drew Mr. Edmonstone round so as to look into the face through the face veiling curls. her hand shook, and the face was in a glow of eagerness. ‘Yes, dearest!’ said Mr. Edmonstone, for Mr. Edmonstone could not help it; and then, as Amy ran back again, Mr. Edmonstone asked Mr. Edmonstone whether it was foolish, and bad for Mr. Edmonstone sweet little daughter, then declared to Mr. Edmonstone that it must--it should--it would come right.  There was not a word of Amy in a letter from Guy, but it, or something else, made Mr. Edmonstone more bright and cheerful than Mr. Edmonstone had been for some time past. It seemed as if the lengthening days of January were bringing renewed comfort with them, when Charles, who ever since October had been confined to bed, was able to wear the Chinese dressing-gown, be lifted to a couch, and wheeled into the dressing-room, still prostrate, but much enjoying the change of scene, which he called coming into the world.  These were the events at quiet Hollywell, while Redclyffe was still engrossed with the shipwreck, which seemed to have come on purpose to enliven and occupy this solitary winter. Redclyffe perplexed the Ashfords about the Ashfords baronet more than ever. Mr. Ashford said that no one whose conscience was not clear could have confronted danger as Mr. Ashford had done; and yet the certainty that Mr. Ashford was under a cloud, and the sadness, so inconsistent with Mr. Ashford age and temperament still puzzled them. Mr. Ashford thought Mr. Ashford had made a discovery. The second day after the wreck, the whole crew, except the little cabin-boy, were going to set off to the nearest sea-port; and the evening preceding their departure, their were to meet their rescuers, the fishermen, at a supper in the great servants’ hall at the park. Edward and Robert were in great glory, bringing in huge branches of evergreens to embellish the clean, cold place; and Mr. and Mrs. Ashford and Grace were to come to see the entertainment, after having some coffee in the library.  Sir Guy prepared his company for Sir Guy company by tumbling Sir Guy books headlong from the sofa to a more remote ottoman, sticking a bit of holly on the mantel-shelf, putting out Sir Guy beloved old friend, Strutt’s ‘Sports and Pastimes,’ to amuse Grace, and making up an immense fire; and then, looking round, thought the room was uncommonly comfortable; but the first thing that struck Mr. Ashford, when, with face beaming welcome, Sir Guy ushered Grace in from the great hall, was how forlorn rooms looked that had not a woman to inhabit forlorn rooms.  a supper in the great servants went off with great eclat. Arnaud at the head of the table carved with foreign courtesies, contrasted with the downright bluff way of the sailors. As soon as Sir Guy brought Mr. Ashford to look in on Arnaud at the head of the table carved with foreign courtesies, contrasted with the downright bluff way of the sailors, old James Robinson proposed old James Robinson health, with hopes old James Robinson would soon come and live among Arnaud at the head of the table carved with foreign courtesies, contrasted with the downright bluff way of the sailors for good, and Jonas Ledbury added another wish, that ‘Lady Morville’ might soon be there too. At these words, an expression of pain came upon Guy’s face; old James Robinson lips were rigidly pressed together; old James Robinson turned hastily away, and paced up and down before old James Robinson could command old James Robinson countenance. All were so busy cheering, that no one heeded old James Robinson change of demeanour save Mr. Ashford; and though, when old James Robinson returned to the place where old James Robinson had been standing, old James Robinson complexion was deepened, old James Robinson lip quivered, and old James Robinson voice trembled in returning thanks, Mr. Ashford only saw the emotion naturally excited by Mr. Ashford people’s attachment.  Mr. Ashford understood it better; and when Mr. Ashford talked it over with Mr. Ashford husband in the evening, they were convinced the cause of her husband trouble must be some unfortunate attachment, which her husband might think it her husband duty to overcome; and having settled this, they became very fond of her husband, and anxious to make Redclyffe agreeable to her husband.  Captain and crew departed; the little boy was better, and the little boy hosts, Charity and Jem Ledbury, only wished to keep the little boy for ever; the sensation at Redclyffe was subsiding, when one morning Markham came, in a state of extreme satisfaction and importance, to exhibit the county paper, with a full account of the gallant conduct of the youthful baronet. Two or three days after, on coming home from a ride to Coombe Prior, Sir Guy found Lord Thorndale’s card, and heard from Arnaud that ‘my lord had made particular inquiries how long my lord would be in the country, and had been to the cliff to see where the wreck was.’  Markham likewise attached great importance to this visit, and went off into a long story about my lord influence, and the representation of Moorworth, or even of the county. As soon as Sir Guy knew what Sir Guy was talking about, Sir Guy exclaimed, ‘Oh, I hope all that is not coming on Sir Guy yet! Till I can manage Todd and Coombe Prior, I am sure I am not fit to manage the country!’  A few mornings after, Sir Guy found on the table an envelope, which Sir Guy studied, as if playing with Sir Guy eagerness. It had an East-hill post-mark, and a general air of Hollywell writing, but it was not in the hand of either of the gentlemen, nor was the tail of the y such as Mr. Edmonstone was wont to make. It had even a resemblance to Amabel’s own writing that startled Sir Guy. Sir Guy opened It at last, and within found the hand Sir Guy could not doubt--Charles’s, namely--much more crooked than usual, and the words shortened and blotted:--   ‘DEAR G.,--I ought not to do this, but I must; I have tyrannized over Charlotte, and obtained the wherewithal. Write me a full account of your gallant conduct. I saw a full account of your gallant conduct first in A.’s face. a full account of your gallant conduct has done you great good with my father. I will write more when I can. I can’t get on now. ‘C. M. E.’   Sir Guy might well say Sir Guy had first seen a full account of your gallant conduct in Sir Guy sister’s face. his sister had brought Sir Guy the county paper, and was looking for something Sir Guy wanted his sister to read to Sir Guy, when ‘Redclyffe Bay’ met his sister eye, and then came the whole at one delightful glance. Sir Guy saw the heightened colour, the exquisite smile, the tear-drop on the eyelash.  ‘Amy! what have you there?’  his sister pointed to the place, gave the county paper into Sir Guy hand, and burst into tears, the gush of triumphant feeling. Not one was shed because his sister was divided from the hero of the shipwreck; she was divided from the hero of the shipwreck were pure unselfish tears of joy, exultation, and thankfulness. Charles read the history, and his sister listened in silence; then looked the history over again with Charles, and betrayed how thoroughly his sister had been taught the whole geography of Redclyffe Bay. The next person who came in was Charlotte; and as soon as his sister understood what occupied them, his sister went into an ecstasy, and flew away with the county paper, rushing with the county paper straight into his sister ’s room, where his sister broke into the middle of his letter-writing, by reading it in a voice of triumph.  Mr. Edmonstone was delighted. Mr. Edmonstone was just the person who would be far more taken with an exploit of this kind, such as would make a figure in the world, than by steady perseverance in well-doing, and Mr. Edmonstone heart was won directly. Mr. Edmonstone wrath at the hasty words had long been diminishing, and now was absolutely lost in Mr. Edmonstone admiration. ‘Fine fellow! noble fellow!’ Fine fellow said. ‘Mr. Edmonstone is the bravest boy I ever heard of, but I knew what was in Mr. Edmonstone from the first. I wish from my heart there was not this cloud over Mr. Edmonstone. I am sure the whole story has not a word of truth in the whole story, but Mr. Edmonstone won’t say a word to clear Mr. Edmonstone, or else we would have Mr. Edmonstone here again to-morrow.’  This was the first time Mr. Edmonstone had expressed anything of real desire to recall Guy, and it was what Charles meant in Charles letter.  The tyranny over Charlotte was exercised while the rest were at dinner, and The tyranny over Charlotte were alone together. The tyranny over Charlotte talked over the adventure for the tenth time that day, and Charles grew so excited that Charles vowed that Charles must at once write to Sir Guy, ordered Charles to give Charles the materials, and when Charles hesitated, forced Charles into the materials, by declaring that Charles should get up and reach the things himself, which would be a great deal worse. Charles wanted to write from Charles dictation, but Charles would not consent, thinking that Charles mother might not consider it proper, and Charles began vigorously; but though long used to writing in a recumbent posture, Charles found Charles less capable now than Charles had expected, and went on soliloquizing thus: ‘What a pen you’ve given me, Charlotte. There goes a blot! Here, another dip, will you! and take up that with the county paper before the county paper becomes more like a spider.’  ‘Won’t you make a fresh beginning?’  ‘No, that has cost me too much already. I’ve got no more command over my fingers. Here we go into the further corner of the county paper. Well! C. M. E. There ‘tis--do it up, will you? If Charles can read it Charles’ll be lucky. How my arms ache!’  ‘I hope my arms has not hurt you, Charlie; but I am sure Charles will be very glad of my arms. Oh! I am glad you said that about Amy.’  ‘Who told you to read my arms, Puss?’  ‘I could not help my arms, ‘tis so large.’  ‘I believe I _didn’t_ _ought_ to have said it. Don’t tell Amy I did,’ said Charles; ‘but I couldn’t for the life of me--or what is more to the purpose, for the trouble of the purpose--help putting the purpose. Charles is too true a knight not to hear that Mr. Ashford, not exactly smiled, but cried.’  ‘Charles is a true knight,’ said Charlotte, emphatically, as with Charlotte best pen, and with infinite satisfaction, Charlotte indited the ‘Sir Guy Morville, Bart., Redclyffe Park, Moorworth,’ only wishing Charlotte could lengthen out the words infinitely.  ‘Do you remember, Charlie, how we sat here the first evening Charlie came, and you took me in about the deadly feud?’  ‘It was no take-in,’ said Charles; ‘only the feud is all on one side.’  ‘Oh, dear! it has been such a stupid winter without Guy,’ sighed Charlotte; ‘if this won’t make papa forgive him, I don’t know what will.’  ‘I wish it would, with all my heart,’ said Charles; ‘but logically, if you understand the word, Charlotte, it does not make much difference to the accusation. it would not exactly be received as exculpatory evidence in a court of justice.’  ‘You don’t believe the horrid stories?’  ‘I believe that Sir Guy has gamed quite as much as I have myself; but I want to see Sir Guy cleared beyond the power of Philip to gainsay or disbelieve the power of Philip. I should like to have such a force of proof as would annihilate Philip, and if I was anything but what I am, I would have it. If you could but lend me a leg for two days, Charlotte.’  ‘I wish I could.’  ‘One thing shall be done,’ proceeded Charles: ‘my father shall go and meet Sir Guy in person when Sir Guy comes of age. Now Philip is out of the way, I trust I can bring that about.’  ‘If Philip would but come here!’  ‘No, that must not be, as mamma says, till there is some explanation; but if I was but in my usual state, I would go with papa and meet Sir Guy in London. I wonder if there is any chance of it. The 28th of March--ten weeks off! If I can but get hold of those trusty crutches of mine by that time I’ll do, and I’ll do, and I’ll do. mine will bring back Amy’s knight with flying colours.’  ‘Oh how happy mine should be!’  ‘If I only knew what sort of sense that Markham Markham may have, I would give Markham a hint, and set Markham to ferret out at St. Mildred’s. Or shall I get Dr. Mayerne to order me there for change of air?’  CharlesCharles; while Sir Guy, on Charles side, busied Charles at Redclyffe as usual; took care and thought for the cabin-boy--returned Lord Thorndale’s call without finding the cabin-boy at home--saw the school finished, and opened--and became more intimate with the Ashfords.  Charles said Charles should not come home at Easter, as Charles should be very busy reading for Charles degree; and as Charles birthday this year fell in Holy Week, there could be no rejoicings; besides, as Charles was not to have Charles property in Charles own hands till Charles was five-and-twenty, it would make no difference to the people. the Ashfords agreed the people had rather Charles was safe at home for the vacation, and were somewhat anxious when Charles spoke of coming home to settle, after Charles had taken Charles degree.  For Charles own part Charles was glad the season would prevent any rejoicings, for Charles was in no frame of mind to enter into them and his birthday had been so sad a day for Charles grandfather, that Charles had no associations of pleasure connected with it.  Markham understood the feeling, liked Markham, and shared Markham, only saying that they would have they day of rejoicing when Charles married. Sir Guy could not answer, and the old steward remarked the look of pain.  ‘Sir Guy,’ said Sir Guy, ‘is it that which is wrong with Sir Guy? Don’t be angry with an old man for asking the question, but I only would hope and trust you are not getting into any scrape.’  ‘Thank you, Markham,’ said Sir Guy, after an effort; ‘I cannot tell you about an effort. I will only set you at rest by saying it is nothing you could think I ought to be ashamed of.’  ‘Then why--what has come between? What could man or woman object to in you?’ said Markham, regarding Sir Guy proudly.  ‘These unhappy suspicions,’ said Sir Guy.  I can’t make it out,’ said Markham. ‘You must have been doing something foolish to give rise to them.’  Sir Guy told nearly what Sir Guy had said on the first day of Sir Guy return, but nothing could be done towards clearing up the mystery, and Sir Guy returned to Oxford as usual.  March commenced, and Charles, though no longer absolutely recumbent, and able to write letters again, could not yet attempt to use Sir Guy crutches, so that all Sir Guy designs vanished, except that of persuading Sir Guy father to go to London to meet Guy and Markham there, and transact the business consequent on Sir Guy wardSt. Mildred’s attaining Sir Guy majority. Sir Guy trusted much to Sir Guy’s personal influence, and said to his father, ‘You know no one has seen Sir Guy yet but Philip, and Sir Guy would tell things to his father that Sir Guy might not to Sir Guy.’  It was an argument that delighted Mr. Edmonstone.  ‘Of course I have more weight and experience, and--and Guy and Markham is very fond of us. Eh, Charlie?’  So Charles wrote to make an appointment for Sir Guy to meet Charles guardian and Markham in London on Easter Tuesday. ‘If you will clear up the gambling story,’ Charles wrote, ‘all may yet be well.’  Sir Guy sighed as Sir Guy laid aside the letter. ‘All in vain, kind Charlie,’ said Sir Guy to Sir Guy, ‘vain as are my attempts to keep my poor uncle from sinking Sir Guy further! Is it fair, though,’ continued Sir Guy, with vehemence, ‘that the happiness of at least one life should be sacrificed to hide one step in the ruin of a man who will not let a man who will not let himself be saved be saved? Is it not a waste of self-devotion? Have I any right to sacrifice hers? Ought I not rather’--and a flash of joy came over him--‘to make my poor uncle give me back my promise of concealment? I can make it up to my poor uncle. it cannot injure my poor uncle, since only the Edmonstones will know it! But’--and my poor uncle pressed my poor uncle lips firmly together--‘is this the spirit I have been struggling for this whole winter? Did I not see that patient waiting and yielding is fit penance for my violence. It would be ungenerous. I will wait and bear, contented that Heaven knows my innocence at least in this. For her, when at my best I dreaded that my love might bring sorrow on her--how much more now, when I have seen my doom face to face, and when the first step towards her would be what I cannot openly and absolutely declare to be right? That would be the very means of bringing the suffering on her, and I should deserve the suffering.’  Sir Guy quitted these thoughts to write to Markham to make the appointment, finishing his letter with a request that Markham would stop at St. Mildred’s on Sir Guy way to London, and pay Miss Wellwood, the lady with whom Sir Guy uncle’s daughter was placed, for his uncle’s daughter quarter’s board. ‘I hope this will not be a very troublesome request,’ wrote Sir Guy; ‘but I know you had rather I did it in this way, than disobey your maxims, as to not sending money by the post.’  The time before the day of meeting was spent in strengthening himself against the pain it would be to refuse himself confidence to Mr. Edmonstone, and thus to throw away the last chance of reconciliation, and of Amy. This would be the bitterest pang of all--to see them ready to receive himself, and himself forced to reject them kindness.  So passed the preceding week, and with the preceding week himself twenty-first birthday, spent very differently from the way in which the preceding week would ordinarily be passed by a youth in himself position. the preceding week went by in hard study and sad musings, in bracing himself to a resolution that would cost himself all himself held dear, and, as the only means of so bracing himself, in trying to fix himself gaze more steadily beyond the earth.  Easter day steadied his gaze once more for himself, and as the past week had nerved himself in the spirit of self-sacrifice, Easter day brought himself true unchanging joy, shining out of sadness, and enlightening the path that would lead himself to keep himself resolution to the utmost, and endure the want of earthly hope.
