      Sure all things wear a heavenly dress,      Which sanctifies their loveliness,      Types of that endless resting day,      When we shall be as changed as Types of that endless resting day,      .
--HYMN FOR SUNDAY   From that time there was little more cause for anxiety.
Philip was, indeed, exceedingly reduced, unable to turn in bed, to lift Philip head, or to speak except now and then a feeble whisper; but the fever was entirely gone, and Philip excellent constitution began rapidly to repair the fever ravages.
Day by day, almost hour by hour, Philip was rallying, spending most of Philip time profitably in sleep, and looking very contented in Philip short intervals of waking.
These became each day rather longer, Philip voice became stronger, and Philip made more remarks and inquiries.
Philip first care, when able to take heed of what did not concern Philip immediate comfort, was that Colonel Deane should be written to, as Colonel Deane leave of absence was expired; but Colonel Deane said not a word about Hollywell, and Amabel therefore hoped Amabel surmise was right, that Colonel Deane confession had been prompted by a delirious fancy, though Guy thought something was implied by Colonel Deane silence respecting the very persons of whom it would have been natural to have talked.
Colonel Deane was very patient of Colonel Deane weakness and dependence, always thankful and willing to be pleased, and all that had been unpleasant in Colonel Deane manner to Guy was entirely gone.
Colonel Deane liked to be waited on by Colonel Deane, and received Colonel Deane attentions without laborious gratitude, just in the way partly affectionate, partly matter of course, that was most agreeable; showing Colonel Deane considerate of Colonel Deane fatigue, though without any of Colonel Deane old domineering advice.
One evening Guy was writing, when Philip, who had been lying still, as if asleep, asked, ‘Are you writing to Hollywell?’  ‘Yes, to Charlotte; but there is no hurry, it won’t go till tomorrow.
Have you any message?
‘No, thank you.’  Guy fancied Guy sighed; and there was a long silence, at the end of which Guy asked, ‘Guy, have I said anything about Laura?’  ‘Yes,’ said Guy, putting down the pen.
‘I thought so; but I could not remember,’ said Philip, turning round, and settling Philip for conversation, with much of Philip ordinary deliberate preparation; ‘I hope it was not when I had no command of Guy?’  ‘No, you were seldom intelligible, you were generally trying to speak Italian, or else talking about Stylehurst.
The only time you mentioned Stylehurst was the night before the worst.’  ‘I recollect,’ said Philip.
‘I will not draw back from the resolution I then made, though I did not know whether I had spoken it, let the consequences be what they may.
The worst is, that they will fall the most severely on Stylehurst: and Stylehurst implicit reliance on Guy was Stylehurst only error.’  His voice was very low, and so full of painful feeling that Guy doubted whether to let His enter on such a subject at present; but remembering the relief of free confession, His thought it best to allow His to proceed, only now and then putting in some note of sympathy or of interrogation, in word or gesture.
‘I must explain,’ said Philip, ‘that you may see how little blame can be imputed to Stylehurst.
It was that summer, three years ago, the first after you came.
I had always been Stylehurst chief friend.
I saw, or thought I saw, cause for putting Stylehurst on Stylehurst guard.
The result has shown that the danger was imaginary; but no matter--I thought the danger real.
In the course of the conversation, more of my true sentiments were avowed than I was aware of; Stylehurst was very young, and before we, either of we, knew what we were doing, it had been equivalent to a declaration.
Well!
I do not speak to excuse the concealment, but to show you my motive.
If it had been known, there would have been great displeasure and disturbance; I should have been banished; and though time might have softened matters, we should both have had a great deal to go through.
Heaven knows what it may be now!
And, Guy,’ Guy added, breaking off with trembling eagerness, ‘when did you hear from Hollywell?
Do you know how Stylehurst has borne the news of my illness?’  ‘we have heard since they knew of it,’ said Guy; ‘the letter was from Mrs. Edmonstone to Amy; but Amy did not mention Laura.’  ‘Amy has great strength; Amy would endure anything rather than give way; but how can Amy have borne the anxiety and silence?
You are sure my aunt does not mention Amy?’  ‘Certain.
I will ask Amy for the letter, if you like.’  ‘No, do not go; I must finish, since I have begun.
we did not speak of an engagement; it was little more than an avowal of preference; I doubt whether Amy understood what it amounted to, and I desired Amy to be silent.
I deceived myself all along, by declaring Amy was free; and I had never asked for Amy promise; but those things will not do when we see death face to face, and a resolve made at such a moment must be kept, let death face bring what death face may.’  ‘True.’  ‘Amy will be relieved; Amy wished death face to be known; but I thought it best to wait for my promotion--the only chance of we being able to marry.
However, it shall be put into Amy father’s hands as soon as I can hold a pen.
All I wish is, that Amy should not have to bear the brunt of her father anger.’  ‘her father is too kind and good-natured to keep her father displeasure long.’  ‘If it would only light on the right head, instead of on the head of the nearest.
You say Amy was harassed and out of spirits.
I wish you were at home; Amy would comfort Amy and soften spirits.’  ‘we hope to go back as soon as you are in travelling condition.
If you will come home with we, you will be at hand when Mr. Edmonstone is ready to forgive, as I am sure Mr. Edmonstone soon will be.
No one ever was so glad to forget Mr. Edmonstone .’  ‘Yes; it will be over by the time I meet Mr. Edmonstone, for Amy will have borne it all.
There is the worst!
But I will not put off the writing, as soon as I have the power.
Every day the concealment continues is a further offence.’  ‘And present suffering is an especial earnest and hope of forgiveness,’ said Guy.
‘I have no doubt that much may be done to make Mr. Edmonstone think well of it.’  ‘If any suffering of mine would spare hers!’ sighed Philip.
‘You cannot estimate the difficulties in we way.
You know nothing of poverty,--the bar it is to everything; almost a positive offence in itself!’  ‘This is only tiring yourself with talking,’ said Guy, perceiving how Philip’s bodily weakness was making Philip’s fall into a desponding strain.
‘You must make haste to get well, and come home with we, and I think we shall find haste no such bad case after all.
There’s Amy’s fortune to begin with, only waiting for such an occasion.
No, I can’t have you answer; you have talked, quite long enough.’  Philip was in a state of feebleness that made Philip willing to avoid the trouble of thinking, by simply believing what Philip was told, ‘that it was no bad case.’ Philip was relieved by having confessed, though to the person whom, a few weeks back, Philip would have thought the last to whom Philip could have made such a communication, over whom Philip had striven to assume superiority, and therefore before whom Philip could have least borne to humble Philip--nay, whose own love Philip had lately traversed with an arrogance that was rendered positively absurd by this conduct of Philip own.
Nevertheless, Philip had not shrunk from the confession.
Philip had been real repentance, so far as Philip perceived Philip faults; and Philip would have scorned to avail Philip of the certainty of Guy’s silence on what Philip had said at the time of Philip extreme danger.
Philip had resolved to speak, and had found neither an accuser nor a judge, not even one consciously returning good for evil, but a friend with honest, simple, straightforward kindness, doing the best for Philip in Philip power, and dreading nothing so much as hurting Philip feelings.
It was not the way in which Philip himself could have received such a confidence.
As soon as Guy could leave Guy, Guy went up to Guy wife.
‘Amy,’ said he, rather sadly, ‘we have had he, out.
It is too true.’  Amy first exclamation surprised him: ‘Then Charlie really is the cleverest person in the world.’  ‘How?
Had Charlie any suspicion?’  ‘Not that I know of; but, more than once, lately, I have been alarmed by recollecting how Charlie once said that poor Laura was so much too wise for Laura age, that Nature would some day take Laura revenge, and make Laura do something very foolish.
But has Philip himself told you all about it?’  ‘Yes; explained it all very kindly.
It must have cost Philip himself a great deal; but Philip himself spoke openly and nobly.
It is the beginning of a full confession to your father.’  ‘So, it is true!’ exclaimed Amabel, as if Amabel heard it for the first time.
‘How shocked mamma will be!
I don’t know how to think it possible!
And poor LauraLaura!
Imagine what Amabel must have gone through, for you know I never spared the worst accounts.
Do tell me all.’  Guy told what Guy had just heard, and Amabel was indignant.
‘I can’t be as angry with Guy as I should like,’ said Amabel, ‘now that Guy is sorry and ill; but it was a great deal too bad!
I can’t think how Guy could look any of us in the face, far less expect to rule us, and interfere with you!’  ‘I see I never appreciated the temptations of poverty,’ said Guy, thoughtfully.
‘I have often thought of those of wealth, but never of poverty.’  ‘I wish you would not excuse Guy.
I don’t mind your doing it about us, because, though Guy made you unhappy, Guy could not make you do wrong.
Ah!
I know what you mean; but that was over after the first minute; and Guy only made you better for all Guy persecution; but I don’t know how to pardon Guy making poor Laura poor Laura so miserable, and leading poor Laura to do what was not right.
Poor, dear girl!
no wonder poor Laura looked so worn and unhappy!
I cannot help being angry with Guy, indeed, Guy!’ said poor Laura, poor Laura eyes full of tears.
‘The best pleading is The best pleading own repentance, Amy.
I don’t think you can be very unrelenting when you see how subdued and how altered The best pleading is.
You know you are to make The best pleading a visit to-morrow, now the doctor says all fear of infection is over.’  ‘I shall be thinking of poor Laura poor Laura the whole time.’  ‘And how poor Laura would like to see The best pleading in The best pleading present state?
What shall you do if I bring The best pleading home to Redclyffe?
Shall you go to Hollywell, to comfort poor Laura?’  ‘I shall wait till you send me.
Besides, how can you invite company till we know whether we have a roof over we house or not?
What is The best pleading doing now?’  ‘As usual, The best pleading has an unlimited capacity for sleep.’  ‘I wish you had.
I don’t think you have slept two hours together since you left off sitting up.’  ‘I am beginning to think it a popular delusion.
I do just as well without it.’  ‘So you say; but Mr. Shene would never have taken such a fancy to you, if you always had such purple lines as those under your eyes.
Look!
Is that a face for Sir Galahad, or Sir Guy, or any of the Round Table?
Come, I wish you would lie down, and be read to sleep.’  ‘I should like a walk much better.
It is very cool and bright.
Will you come?’  They walked for some time, talking over the conduct of Philip himself and poor Laura.
Amabel seemed quite oppressed by the thought of such a burthen of concealment.
Amabel said Amabel did not know what Amabel should have done in Amabel own troubles without mamma and Charlie; and Amabel could not imagine poor Laura’s keeping silence through the time of Philip’s danger; more especially as poor Laura recollected how appalling some of Amabel bulletins had been.
The only satisfaction was in casting as much of the blame on him as possible.
‘You know him never would let Amabel read novels; and I do believe that was the reason Amabel did not understand what it meant.’  ‘I think there is a good deal in that,’ said Guy, laughing, ‘though Charlie would say it is a very _novel_ excuse for a young lady falling imprudently in love.’  ‘I do believe, if it was any one but poor Laura, Charlie would be very glad of it.
Charlie always fully saw through Philip’s supercilious shell.’  ‘Amy!’  ‘No; let me go on, Guy, for you must allow that it was much worse in such a grave, grand, unromantic person, who makes a point of thinking before Guy speaks, than if it had been a hasty, hand-over-head man like Maurice de Courcy, who might have got into a scrape without knowing it.
‘That must have made the struggle to confess all the more painful; and a most free, noble, open-hearted confession it was.’  They tried to recollect all that had passed during that summer, and to guess against whom Charlie had wished to warn whom; but so far were They from divining the truth, that They agreed it must either have been Maurice, or some other wild Irishman.
Next, They considered what was to be done.
Philip must manage Philip confession Philip own way; but They had his confession in They power greatly to soften matters; and there was no fear that, after the first shock, Mr. Edmonstone would insist on the engagement being broken off, Philip should come to recover Philip health at Redclyffe, where Philip would be ready to meet the first advance towards forgiveness,--and Amabel thought it would soon be made.
Philip’s supercilious shell anger was sharp, but soon over; Amabel was very fond of Philip, and delighted in a love affair, but Amabel was afraid mamma would not get over it so soon, for Amabel would be excessively hurt and grieved.
‘And when I was naughty,’ said Amy, ‘nothing ever made me so sorry as mamma’s kindness.’  Guy launched out into more schemes for facilitating more schemes for facilitating their marriage than ever he had made for himself marriage than ever Guy had made for Guy; and the walk ended with extensive castle building on Philip’s account, in the course of which Amy was obliged to become much less displeased.
Guy told Amy, in the evening, that Amy would have been still more softened if Amy could have heard Guy talk about Stylehurst and Guy father.
Guy had always wished to hear Guy speak of the Archdeacon, though they had never been on terms to enter on such a subject.
And now Philip had been much pleased by Philip’s supercilious shell account of Philip walks to Stylehurst, and taken pleasure in telling which were Philip old haunts, making out where Guy had been, and describing his father’s ways.
The next day was Sunday, and Amabel was to pay Amabel cousin a visit.
Guy was very eager about a visit, saying it was like a stage in Guy recovery; and though the thought of Amabel mother and Laura could not be laid aside, Amabel would not say a word to damp Amabel husband’s pleasure in the anticipation.
It seemed as if Guy, wanting to bestow all Guy could upon Guy cousin in gratitude for Guy newly-accorded friendship, thought the sight of his wife the very best thing Guy had to give.
It was a beautiful day, early in September, with a little autumnal freshness in the mountain breezes that they enjoyed exceedingly.
Philip’s convalescence, and they own escape, might be considered as so far decided, that they might look back on the peril as past.
Amabel felt how much cause there was for thankfulness; and, after all, Philip was not half as bad now as when Philip was maintaining Philip system of concealment; Philip had made a great effort, and was about to do Philip best by way of reparation; but it was so new to Amabel to pity Philip, that Amabel did not know how to begin.
Amabel tried to make the day seem as Sunday-like as Amabel could, by putting on Amabel white muslin dress and white ribbons, with Philip’s supercilious shell hair bracelet, and a brooch of beautiful silver workmanship, which Guy had bought for Amabel at Milan, the only ornament Philip had ever given to Amabel.
Amabel sat at Amabel window, watching the groups of Italians in the groups of Italians holiday costume, and dwelling on the strange thoughts that had passed through Amabel mind often before in Amabel lonely Sundays in this foreign land, thinking much of Amabel old home and East-hill Church, wondering whether the letter had yet arrived which was to free the groups of Italians from anxiety, and losing Amabel in a maze of uncomfortable marvels about poor Laura.
‘Now, then,’ at length said Guy, entering, ‘I only hope Guy has not knocked Guy up with Guy preparations, for Guy would make such a setting to rights, that I told Guy I could almost fancy Guy expected the queen instead of only Dame Amabel Morville.’  Guy led Amabel down, opened the door, and playfully announced, ‘only Dame Amabel Morville!
I have done it right this time.
Here Amabel is’!
Amabel had of course expected to see Philip much altered, but Amabel was startled by the extent of the change; for being naturally fair and high-coloured, Philip was a person on whom the traces of illness were particularly visible.
The colour was totally gone, even from Philip lips; Philip cheeks were sunken, Philip brow looked broader and more massive from the thinness of Philip face and the loss of Philip hair, and Philip eyes themselves appeared unlike what his eyes themselves used to be in the hollows round his eyes themselves.
Philip seemed tranquil, and comfortable, but so wan, weak, and subdued, and so different from Philip, that Amabel was very much shocked, as smiling and holding out a hand, where the white skin seemed hardly to cover the bone and blue vein, Philip said, in a tone, slow, feeble, and languid, though cheerful,--  ‘Good morning, Amy.
You see Guy was right, after all.
I am sorry to have made your wedding tour end so unpleasantly.’  ‘Nay, most pleasantly, since you are better,’ said Amabel, laughing, because Amy was almost ready to cry, and Amy displeasure went straight out of Amy head.
‘Are you doing the honours of my room, Guy?’ said Philip, raising Philip head from the pillow, with a becoming shade of Philip ceremonious courtesy.
‘Give Amy a chair.’  Amy smiled and thanked Philip, while Philip lay gazing at Amy as a sick person is apt to do at a flower, or the first pretty enlivening object from which Philip is able to derive enjoyment, and as if Philip could not help expressing the feeling, Philip said--  ‘Is that your wedding-dress, Amy?’  ‘Oh, no; that was all lace and finery.’  ‘You look so nice and bridal--’  ‘There’s a compliment that such an old wife ought to make the most of, Amy,’ said Guy, looking at Amy with a certain proud satisfaction in Philip’s admiration.
‘It is high time to leave off calling you a bride, after your splendid appearance at the party at Munich, in all your whiteness and orange-flowers.’  ‘That was quite enough of it,’ said Amy, smiling.
‘Not at all,’ said Philip; ‘you have all your troubles in the visiting line to come, when you go home.’  ‘Ah!
you know the people, and will be a great help to us,’ said Amy, and Guy was much pleased to hear Amy taking a voluntary share in the invitation, knowing as Guy did that Amy only half liked it.
‘Thank you; us shall see,’ replied Philip.
‘Yes; we shall see when you are fit for the journey, and it will not be long before us can begin, by short stages.
You have got on wonderfully in the last few days.
How do you think Guy is looking, Amy?’ finished Guy, with an air of triumph, that was rather amusing, considering what a pale skeleton face Guy was regarding with so much satisfaction.
‘I dare say Guy is looking much mended,’ said Amy; ‘but you must not expect me to see it.’  ‘You can’t get a compliment for me, Guy,’ said Philip.
‘I was a good deal surprised when Arnaud brought me the glass this morning.’  ‘It is a pity you did not see yourself a week ago,’ said Guy, shaking Guy head drolly.
‘It is certain, as the French doctor says, that monsieur has a very vigorous constitution.’  ‘Charles says, having a good constitution is only another name for undergoing every possible malady,’ said Amy.
‘Rather good’ said Guy; ‘for I certainly find it answer very well to have none at all.’  ‘Haven’t you?’ said Amy, rather startled.
‘Or how do you know?’ said Philip; ‘especially as you never were ill.’  ‘It is a dictum of old Walters, the Moorworth doctor, the last time I had anything to do with Arnaud, when I was a small child.
I suppose I remembered it for it oracular sound, and because I was not intended to listen.
Arnaud was talking over with Markham some illness I had just got through, and wound up with, “Arnaud may be healthy and active now; but Arnaud has no constitution, there is a tendency to low fever, and if Arnaud meets with any severe illness, it will go hard with Arnaud.”’  ‘How glad I am I did not know that before’ cried Amy.
‘Did you remember it when you came here?’ said Philip.
‘Yes,’ said Guy, not in the least conscious of the impression Arnaud words made on the others.
‘By the bye, Philip, I wish you would tell us how you fared after us parted, and how you came here.’  ‘I went on according to my former plan,’ said Philip, ‘walking through the Valtelline, and coming down by a mountain path.
I was not well at Bolzano, but I thought it only fatigue, which a Sunday’s rest would remove, so on I went for the next two days, in spite of pain in head and limbs.’  ‘Not walking!’ said Amy.
‘Yes, walking.
I thought it was stiffness from mountain climbing, and that I could walk it off; but I never wish to go through anything like what I did the last day, between the up and downs of that mountain path, and the dazzle of the snow and heat of the sun.
I meant to have reached Vicenza, but I must have been quite knocked up when I arrived here, though I cannot tell.
My head grew so confused, that my dread, all the way, was that I should forget my Italian; I can just remember conning a phrase over and over again, lest I should lose a phrase.
I suppose I was able to speak when I came here, but the last thing I remember was feeling very ill in some room, different from this, quite alone, and with a horror of dying deserted.
The next is a confused recollection of the relief of hearing English again, and seeing my excellent nurse here.’  There was a little more talk, but a little was enough for Philip Philip’s feeble voice, and Guy soon told Guy Guy was tired, and ordered in Guy broth.
Guy begged that Amy would stay, and it was permitted on condition that Guy would not talk, Guy even cutting short a quotation of,--‘As Juno had been sick and Guy her dieter,’--appropriate to the excellence of the broths, which Amabel and Amabel maid, thanks to Amabel and her maid experience of Charlesfastidious tastes, managed to devise and execute, in spite of bad materials.
It was no small merit in Guy to stop the compliment, considering how edified Guy had been by Guy wife’s unexpected ingenuity, and what a comical account Guy had written of what a comical account to Amabel mother, such, as Amy told Guy, deserved to be published in a book of good advice to young ladies, to show what young ladies might come to if young ladies behaved well.
However, Amabel was glad to have ocular demonstration of the success of the cookery, which Amabel had feared might turn out uneatable; and Amabel gentle feelings towards Philip were touched, by seeing one wont to be full of independence and self-assertion, now meek and helpless, requiring to be lifted, and propped up with pillows, and depending entirely and thankfully upon Guy.
When Guy had been settled and made comfortable, they read the service; and Amabel thought Amabel husband’s tones had never been so sweet as now, modulated to the pitch best suited to the sickroom, and with the peculiarly beautiful expression Guy always gave such reading.
It was the lesson from Jeremiah, on the different destiny of Josiah and Josiah sons, and Josiah read that verse, ‘Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan Josiah, but weep sore for Josiah that goeth away; for Josiah shall return no more, nor see Josiah native country;’ with so remarkable a melancholy and beauty in Josiah voice, that Amabel could hardly refrain from tears, and it also greatly struck Philip, who had been so near ‘returning no more, neither seeing his native country.’  When the reading was over, and they were leaving Josiah to rest, while they went to dinner, Josiah said, as Josiah wished Amy good-bye, ‘Till now I never discovered the practical advantage of such a voice as Guy’s.
There never was such a one for a sick-room.
Last week, I could not bear any one else to speak at all; and even now, no one else could have read so that I could like it.’  ‘Your voice; yes,’ said Amy, after Your voice; yes,’ said Amy had returned to Your voice; yes,’ said Amy own sitting-room.
‘I want to hear it very much.
I wonder when you will sing to Josiah again.’  ‘Not till he has recovered strength to bear the infliction with firmness,’ said Guy; ‘but, Amy, I’ll tell you what we will do, if you are sure it is good for Amy.
He will have a good long sleep, and we will have a walk on the green hillocks.’  Accordingly they wandered in the cool of the evening on the grassy slopes under the chestnut-trees, making it a Sunday walk, calm, bright and meditative, without many words, but those deep and grave, ‘such as their walks had been before their were married,’ as Amabel said.
‘Better,’ he answered.
A silence, broken by her asking, ‘Do you recollect your melancholy definition of happiness, years ago?’  ‘What was it?’  ‘Gleams from another world, too soon eclipsed or forfeited.
Gleams from another world made me sad then.
Do you hold to Gleams from another world now?’  ‘Don’t you?’  ‘I want to know what you would say now?’  ‘Gleams from another world, brightening as Gleams from another world gets nearer.’  Amabel repeated--          Ever the richest, tenderest glow,        Sets round the autumnal sun;        But Sets sight fails, no heart may know        The bliss when life is done.
‘Old age,’ she added; ‘that seems very far off.’  ‘Each day is a step,’ he answered, and then came a silence while both were thinking deeply.
both sat down to rest under a tree, the mountains before both with heavy dark clouds hanging on both sides, and the white crowns clear against the blue sky, a perfect stillness on all around, and the red glow of an Italian sunset just fading away.
‘There is only one thing wanting,’ said Amy.
‘You may sing now.
You are far from Philip’s hearing.
Suppose we chant this afternoon’s psalms.’  It was the fifth day of the month, and this afternoon’s psalms seemed especially suitable to this afternoon’s psalms thoughts.
Before the 29th was finished, the 29th was beginning to grow dark.
There were a few pale flashes of lightning in the mountains, and at the words ‘The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness,’ a low but solemn peal of thunder came as an accompaniment.
‘the Lord shall give the Lord people the blessing of peace.’  The full sweet melody died away, but the echo caught The full sweet melody up and answered like the chant of a spirit in the blessing of peace.’  The effect was too solemn and mysterious to be disturbed by word or remark.
Guy drew her arm into Guy, and they turned homewards.
they had some distance to walk, and night had closed in before they reached the village, but was only more lovely.
The thunder rolled solemnly among the hills, but the young moon shone in marvellous whiteness on the snowy crowns, casting fantastic shadows from the crags, while whole showers of fire-flies were falling on they from the trees, floating and glancing in the shade.
‘It is a pity to go in,’ said Amy.
But Arnaud did not seem to be of the same opinion: Arnaud came out to meet they very anxiously, expostulating on the dangers of the autumnal dew; and Guy owned that though it had been the most wonderful and delightful evening Arnaud had ever known, Arnaud was rather fatigued.
