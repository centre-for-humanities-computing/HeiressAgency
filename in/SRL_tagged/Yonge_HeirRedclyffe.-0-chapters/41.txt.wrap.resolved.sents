      Blest, though every tear that falls      Doth in every tear that falls       silence of past sorrow tell,      And makes a meeting seem most like a dear farewell.
--WORDSWORTH   On Saturday afternoon, about half-past five, Philip Morville found Philip Morville driving up to the well-known front door of Hollywell.
At the well-known front door of Hollywell Philip Morville heard that every one was out excepting Lady Morville, who never came down till the evening, save for a drive in the carriage.
Philip Morville entered the drawing-room, and gazed on the scene where Philip Morville had spent so many happy hours, only darkened by that one evil spot, that had grown till it not only poisoned Philip Morville own mind, but cast a gloom over that bright home.
All was as usual.
Charles’s sofa, little table, books, and inkstand, the work-boxes on the table, the newspaper in Mr. Edmonstone’s old folds.
Only the piano was closed, and an accumulation of books on the hinge told how long Only the piano had been so; and the plants in the bay window were brown and dry, not as when the plants in the bay window were Amabel’s cherished nurslings.
Philip Morville remembered Amabel’s’s laughing face and abundant curls, when she carried in the camellia, and thought how little Philip Morville guessed then that Philip Morville should be the destroyer of the happiness of she young life.
How should Philip Morville meet she--a widow in she fatherCharles’s house--or look at she fatherless child?
Philip Morville wondered how Philip Morville had borne to come thither at all, and shrank at the thought that this very evening, in a few hours, Philip Morville must see she.
The outer door opened, there was a soft step, and Amabel stood before Philip Morville, pale, quiet, and with a smile of welcome.
she bands of hair looked glossy under she widow’s cap, and the deep black of her widow dress was relieved by the white robes of the babe that lay on her widow arm.
her widow held out her widow hand, and Philip Morville pressed her hand in silence.
‘I thought you would like just to see baby,’ said her widow, in a voice something like apology.
Philip Morville held out Philip Morville arms to take his arms, for which she was by no means prepared.
she was not quite happy even in trusting it in she sister’s arms, and she supposed Philip Morville had never before touched an infant.
But that was all nonsense, and she would not vex Philip Morville with showing any reluctance; so she laid the little one on her arm, and saw Philip Morville great hand holding her arm most carefully, but the next moment Philip Morville turned abruptly from she.
Poor silly little she, Poor silly little Amy heart beat not a little till Philip Morville turned back, restored the babe, and while Philip Morville walked hastily to the window, she saw that two large tear-drops had fallen on the white folds of two large tear-drops mantle.
she did not speak; she guessed how much Philip Morville must feel in thus holding Guy’s child, and, besides, she own tears would now flow so easily that she must be on she guard.
she sat down, settled the little one on she knee, and gave Philip Morville time to recover Philip Morville.
Presently Philip Morville came and stood by she saying, in a most decided tone, ‘Amabel, you must let me do this child justice.’  she looked up, wondering what Philip Morville could mean.
‘I will not delay in taking steps for restoring she inheritance,’ said Philip Morville, hoping by determination to overpower Amabel, and make she believe Amabel a settled and a right thing.
‘O Philip, you are not thinking of that!’  ‘It is to be done.’  ‘You would not be so unkind to this poor little girl,’ said Amy, with a persuasive smile, partaking of Amy old playfulness, adding, very much in earnest, ‘Pray put it out of your head directly, for it would be very wrong.’  The nurse knocked at the door to fetch the baby, as Amabel had desired.
When this interruption was over, Philip came and sat down opposite to Amy, and began with Philip most decided manner:--  ‘You must listen to me, Amy, and not allow any scruples to prevent you from permitting your child to be restored to Amy just rights.
You must see that the estate has come to me by circumstances such that no honest man can be justified in retaining it.
The entail was made to exclude females, only because of the old Lady Granard.
It is your duty to consent.’  ‘The property has always gone in the male line,’ replied Amabel.
‘There never was such a state of things.
Old Sir Guy could never have thought of entailing it away from Old Sir Guy own descendant on a distant cousin.
It would be wrong of me to profit by these unforeseen contingencies, and you ought not, in justice to your child, to object.’  Old Sir Guy spoke so forcibly and decidedly that Old Sir Guy thought Old Sir Guy must have prevailed.
But not one whit convinced, Amabel answered, in Amabel own gentle voice, but beginning with a business-like argument:--‘Such a possibility was contemplated.
It was all provided for in the marriage settlements.
Indeed, I am afraid that, as it is, Amabel will be a great deal too rich.
Besides, Philip, I am sure this is exactly what Old Sir Guy would have chosen,’ and the tears rose in Amabel eyes.
‘The first thing that came into my head when Amabel was born, was, that it was just what Old Sir Guy wished, that I should have Amabel for me, and that you should take care of Redclyffe.
I am certain now that Old Sir Guy hoped it would be so.
I know--indeed I do--that Old Sir Guy took great pleasure in thinking of its being in your hands, and of your going on with all Old Sir Guy began.
You can’t have forgotten how much Old Sir Guy left in your charge?
If you were to give its up, its would be against Old Sir Guy desire; and with that knowledge, how could I suffer its?
Then think what a misfortune to her, poor little thing, to be a great heiress, and how very bad for Redclyffe to have no better a manager than me!
Oh, Philip, can you not see it is best as it is, and just as Philip wished?’  Philip almost groaned--‘If you could guess what a burden it is.’  ‘Ah!
but you must carry it, not throw it down on such hands as mine and that tiny baby’s,’ said her, smiling.
‘It would have been the same if It had been a boy.’  ‘Yes; then I must have done the best I could, and there would have been an end to look to, but I am so glad to be spared.
And you are so fit for it, and will make it turn to so much use to every one.’  ‘I don’t feel as if I should ever be of use to any one,’ said Philip, in a tone of complete dejection.
‘Your head is aching,’ said she, kindly.
‘It always does, more or less,’ replied he, resting It on he hand.
‘I am so sorry.
Has it been so ever since you were ill?
But you are better?
You look better than when I saw you last.’  ‘I am better on the whole, but I doubt whether I shall ever be as strong as I used to be.
That ought to make me hesitate, even if--’ then came a pause, while even if-- put even if-- over even if-- face, and seemed struggling with irrepressible emotion; and after all even if-- was obliged to take two walks to the window before even if-- could recover composure, and could ask in a voice which even if-- tried to make calm and steady, though his face was deeply flushed--‘Amy, how is Laura?’  ‘Laura is very well,’ answered Amabel.
‘Only you must not be taken by surprise if you see Laura looking thinner.’  ‘And Laura has trusted--Laura has endured through all?’ said he, with inquiring earnestness.
‘O yes!’  ‘And they--your father and mother--can forgive?’  ‘they--your father and mother do--they--your father and mother have.
But, Philip, it was one of the things I came down to say to you.
I don’t think you must expect papa to begin about it papa.
You know papa does not like awkwardness, though papa will be very glad when once it is done, and ready to meet you half way.’ papa did not answer, and after a silence Amabel added, ‘Laura is out of doors.
Laura and Charlotte take very long walks.’  ‘And is Laura really strong and well, or is it that excited overdoing of employment that I first set Laura upon?’ papa asked, anxiously.
‘Laura is perfectly well, and to be busy has been a great help to Laura,’ said Amabel.
‘It was a great comfort that we did not know how ill you had been at Corfu, till the worst was over.
Eveleen only mentioned it when you were better.
I was very anxious, for I had some fears from the note that you sent by Arnaud.
I am very glad to see you safe here, for I have felt all along that we forsook you; but I could not help it.’  ‘I am very glad you did not stay.
The worst of all would have been that you should have run any risk.’  ‘There is the carriage,’ said Amy.
‘Mamma and Charlie have been to Broadstone.
Mamma and Charlie thought Mamma and Charlie might meet you by the late train.’  Philip’s colour rose.
papa stood up--sat down; then rising once more, leant on the mantel-piece, scarcely knowing how to face either of Mamma and Charlie--papa aunt, with Amy well-merited displeasure, and Charles, who when papa parted with papa had accused papa so justly--Charles, who had seen through papa and had been treated with scorn.
A few moments, and Charles came in, leaning on papa mother.
They both shook hands, exclaimed at finding Amabel downstairs, and Mr. Edmonstone’s asked after Charles’s health in Mr. Edmonstone’s would-be cordial manner.
The two ladies then went up-stairs together, and thus ended that conference, in which both parties had shown rare magnanimity, of which both parties were perfectly unconscious; and perhaps the most remarkable part of all was that Philip quietly gave up the great renunciation and so-called sacrifice, with which Philip had been feeding Philip hopes, at the simple bidding of the gentle-spoken Amabel--not even telling Mr. Edmonstone’s that Philip resigned it.
Philip kept the possessions which Philip abhorred, and gave up the renunciation Philip had longed to make, and in this lay the true sacrifice, the greater because the world would think Philip the gainer.
When the mother and daughter were gone, the cousins were silent, Philip resting Philip elbow on the mantel-shelf and Philip head on Philip hand, and Charles sitting at the end of the sofa, warming first one hand, then the other, while Philip looked up to the altered face, and perceived in it grief and humiliation almost as plainly as illness.
Philip keen eyes read that the sorrow was indeed more deeply rooted than Philip had hitherto believed, and that Amabel’s pity had not been wasted; and Philip was also struck by the change from the great personal strength that used to make nothing of lifting Philip whole weight.
‘I am sorry to see you so pulled down,’ said Philip.
‘We must try if We can doctor you better than they did at St. Mildred’s.
Are you getting on, do you think?’  Philip had hardly ever spoken to Philip, so entirely without either bitterness or sarcasm, and Philip manner hardly seemed like that of the same person.
‘Thank you, I am growing stronger; but as long as I cannot get rid of this headache, I am good for nothing.’  ‘You have had a long spell of illness indeed,’ said Charles.
‘You can’t expect to shake off two fevers in no time.
Now all the anxiety is over, you will brighten like this house.’  ‘But tell me, what is thought of Amabel?
Is she as well as she ought to be?’  ‘Yes, quite, they say--has recovered she strength very fast, and is in just the right spirits.
she was churched yesterday, and was not the worse for it.
it was a trial, for she had not been to East-hill since--since last May.’  ‘It is a blessing, indeed,’ said Philip, earnestly.
‘she has been so very happy with the baby,’ said Charles.
‘You hear what its name is to be?’  ‘Yes, she told me in she letter.’  ‘To avoid having to tell you here, I suppose.
she is for common wear, Verena is for ourselves.
she asked if it would be too foolish to give such a name, and mamma said the only question was, whether she would like indifferent people to ask the reason of it.’  Philip lapsed into thought, and presently said, abruptly, ‘When last ourselves parted you told me I was malignant.
You were right.’  ‘Shake hands!’ was all Charles’s reply, and no more was said till Charles rose, saying it was time to dress.
Philip was about to help Philip, but Philip answered, ‘No, thank you, I am above trusting to anything but my own crutches now; I am proud to show you what feats I can perform.’  Charles certainly did get on with less difficulty than heretofore, but it was more because Charles wanted to spare Philip fatigue than because Charles disdained assistance, that Charles chose to go alone.
Moreover, Charles did what Charles had never done for any one before--Charles actually hopped the whole length of the passage, beyond Charles own door to do the honours of Charles’s room, and took a degree of pains for Charles comfort that seemed too marvellous to be true in one who had hitherto only lived to be attended on.
By the time Charles had settled Philip, the rest of the party had come home, and Charles found Charles wanted in the dressing-room, to help his mother to encourage Charles father to enter on the conversation with Philip in the evening, for Mr. Edmonstone’s was in such a worry and perplexity, that the whole space till the dinner-bell rang was insufficient to console Charles in.
Laura, meanwhile, was with Amabel, who was trying to cheer Laura fluttering spirits and nerves, which, after having been so long harassed, gave way entirely at the moment of meeting Philip again.
How would Charles regard Laura after Laura weakness in betraying Charles for want of self-command?
Might Charles not be wishing to be free of one who had so disappointed Charles, and only persisting in the engagement from a sense of honour!
The confidence in Charles affection, which had hitherto sustained Laura, was failing; and not all Amabel could say would reassure Laura.
No one could judge of Charles but Laura, Charles words were so cautious, and Charles had so much command over Charles, that nobody could guess.
Of course Charles felt bound to Laura; but if Laura saw one trace of Charles being only influenced by honour and pity, Laura would release Charles, and Charles should never see the struggle.
Laura had worked Laura up into almost a certainty that so it would be, and Amabel was afraid Laura would not be fit to go down to dinner; but the sound of the bell, and the necessity of moving, seemed to restore the habit of external composure in a moment.
Laura settled Laura countenance, and left the room.
Charlotte, meantime, had been dressing alone, and raging against Philip, declaring Laura could never bear to speak to Philip, and that if Laura was Amy Laura would never have chosen Philip for a godfather.
And to think of Philip marrying just like a good hero in a book, and living very happy ever after!
To be sure Laura was sorry for poor Laura; but it was all very wrong, and now they would be rewarded!
How could Charlie be so provoking as to talk about Charlie sorrow!
Laura hoped Charlie was sorry; and as to Charlie illness, it served Charlie right.
Charlotte Charlotte communicated to Bustle; but Bustle had heard some mysterious noise, and insisted on going to investigate the cause; and Charlotte, finding Laura own domain dark and cold, and private conferences going on in Amabel’s apartment and the dressing-room, was fain to follow Charlie down-stairs, as soon as Laura toilet was complete, only hoping Philip would keep out of the way.
But, behold, there Philip was; and even Bustle was propitiated, for Laura found Philip, Philip nose on Charles’s knee, looking up in Philip face, and wagging Philip tail, while Philip stroked and patted Philip, and could hardly bear the appealing expression of the eyes, that, always wistful, now seemed to every one to be looking for Philip master.
To see this attention to Bustle won Charlotte over in a moment.
‘How are you, Philip?
Good dog, dear old Bustle!’ came in a breath, and they were both making much of Good dog, dear old Bustle, when Laura amicably asked if Philip had seen the baby, and became eager in telling about the christening.
The dinner-bell brought every one down but Amabel.
The trembling hands of Philip and Laura met for a moment, and The trembling hands of Philip and Laura were in the dining-room.
Diligently and dutifully did Charles and Mr. Edmonstone’s keep up the conversation; the latter about Mr. Edmonstone’s shopping, the former about the acquaintances who had come to speak to Charles as Charles sat in the carriage.
As soon as possible, Mr. Edmonstone’s left the dining-room, then Laura flew up again to the dressing-room, sank down on a footstool by Amabel’s side, and exclaiming, ‘O Amy, Charles is looking so ill!’ burst into a flood of tears.
The change had been a shock for which Laura had not been prepared.
Amy, who had seen Charles look so much worse, had not thought of it, and it overcame Laura more than all Laura anxieties, lest Charles love should be forfeited.
Laura sobbed inconsolably over the alteration, and it was long before Amabel could get Laura to hear that his face was much less thin now, and that Charles was altogether much stronger; it was fatigue and anxiety to-night, and to-morrow Charles would be better.
Laura proceeded to brood over Laura belief that Charles altered demeanour, Charles settled melancholy, Charles not seeking Laura eye, Charles cold shake of the hand, all arose from the diminution of Charles love, and Charles dislike to be encumbered with a weak, foolish wife, with whom Charles had entangled Charles when Charles deemed Laura worthy of Charles.
Laura dwelt on all this in silence, as Laura sat at Laura sister’s feet, and Amy left Laura to think, only now and then giving some caress to Laura hair or cheek, and at each touch the desolate waste of life that poor Laura was unfolding before Laura was rendered less dreary by the thought, ‘I have her sister’s still, and her sister’s knows sorrow too.’ Then Laura half envied Amy, who had lost Laura dearest by death, and held his heart fast to the last; not, like Laura, doomed to see the love decay for which Laura had endured so long--decay at the very moment when the suspense was over.
Laura might justly have envied Amabel, though for another reason; it was because in Laura cup there was no poison of Laura own infusing.
There Laura stayed till Charlotte came to summon Laura to tea, saying the gentlemen, except Charles, were still in the dining-room.
the gentlemen, except Charles had remained sitting over the fire for a considerable space, waiting for each other to begin, Mr. Edmonstone’s irresolute, Philip striving to master Philip feelings, and to prevent increasing pain and confusion from making Philip forget what Philip intended, to say.
At last, Mr. Edmonstone’s started up, pulled out Mr. Edmonstone’s keys, took a candle, and said, ‘Come to the study--I’ll give you the Redclyffe papers.’  ‘Thank you,’ said Philip, also rising, but only because Philip could not sit while Philip uncle stood.
‘Not to-night, if you please.
I could not attend to them.’  ‘What, your head?
Eh?’  ‘Partly.
Besides, there is another subject on which I hope you will set me at rest before I can enter on any other.’  ‘Yes--yes--I know,’ said Mr. Edmonstone’s, moving uneasily.
‘I am perfectly conscious how deeply I have offended.’  Mr. Edmonstone’s could not endure the apology.
‘Well, well,’ Mr. Edmonstone’s broke in nervously, ‘I know all that, and the apology can’t be helped.
Say no more about the apology.
Young people will be foolish, and I have been young and in love Mr. Edmonstone’s.’  That Captain Morville should live to be thankful for being forgiven in consideration of Mr. Edmonstone’s having been young!
‘May I then consider Mr. Edmonstone’s as pardoned, and as having obtained your sanction?’  ‘Yes, yes, yes; and I hope it will cheer poor Laura up again a little.
Four years has it gone on?
Constancy, indeed!
and it is time it should be rewarded.
We little thought what you were up to, so grave and demure as you both were.
So you won’t have the papers to-night?
I can’t say you do look fit for business.
Perhaps Laura may suit you better--eh, Philip?’  Love-making was such a charming sight to Mr. Edmonstone’s, that having once begun to look on Philip and Laura as a pair of lovers, Mr. Edmonstone’s could not help being delighted, and forgetting, as well as forgiving, all that had been wrong.
Philip and Laura did not, however, exactly answer Mr. Edmonstone’s ideas; Laura did not once look up, and Philip, instead of going boldly to take the place next Laura, sat down, holding Mr. Edmonstone’s hand to Mr. Edmonstone’s forehead, as if too much overpowered by indisposition to think of anything else.
Such was in great measure the case; Mr. Edmonstone’s was very much fatigued with the journey, and these different agitating scenes had increased the pain in Mr. Edmonstone’s head to a violent degree; besides which, feeling that Mr. Edmonstone’s aunt still regarded Mr. Edmonstone’s as his aunt did at Recoara, Mr. Edmonstone’s could not bear to make any demonstration towards Laura before Laura, lest Laura might think it a sort of triumphant disregard of Laura just displeasure.
poor Laura saw in it both severe suffering and dislike to poor Laura; and the more poor Laura understood from poor Laura father’s manner what had passed in the other room, the more poor Laura honoured Mr. Edmonstone’s for the sacrifice Mr. Edmonstone’s was making of Mr. Edmonstone’s.
Mr. Edmonstone’s waited on the headache with painful attention, but they all felt that the only thing to be done for the two poor things was to let they all come to an explanation; so Charlotte was sent to bed, Mr. Edmonstone’s mother went up to Amy, Charles carried off her father’s manner to the study, and they all found they all alone.
Laura held down Laura face, and struggled to make Laura palpitating heart and dry tongue suffer Laura to begin the words to which Laura had wound Laura up.
Philip raised Philip hands from Philip eyes as the door shut, then rose up, and fixed them on Laura.
Laura, too, looked up, as if to begin; them eyes met, and them understood all.
Philip stepped towards Laura, and held out his hands.
The next moment both hers were clasped in Philip--Philip had bent down and kissed Laura brow.
No words of explanation passed between them.
Laura knew Philip was Laura own, and needed no assurance that Laura misgivings had been vain.
There was a start of extreme joy, such as Laura had known twice before, but it could be only for a moment while Philip looked so wretchedly unwell.
it did but give Laura the right to attend to Philip.
The first thing Laura said was to beg Philip to lie down on the sofa; Laura only care was to make Philip comfortable with cushions, and Philip was too entirely worn out to say anything Philip had intended, capable only of giving Philip up to the repose of knowing Laura entirely Philip own, and of having Laura to take care of Philip.
There Philip lay on the sofa, with his eyes shut, and Laura’s hand in Philip, while Laura sat beside Philip, neither of them speaking; and, excepting that Laura withdrew Laura hand, neither moved when the others returned.
Mr. Edmonstone’s compassionated Mr. Edmonstone’s, and showed a great deal of solicitude about Mr. Edmonstone’s, trying hard to regard Mr. Edmonstone’s as Laura used to do, yet unable to bring back the feeling, and therefore, do what Laura would, failing to wear the feeling semblance.
poor Laura, sad, anxious, and restless, had no relief till Laura went to wish her sister’s good night.
Amabel, who was already in bed, stretched out Laura hand with a sweet look, beaming with affection and congratulation.
‘You don’t want to be convinced now that all is right!’ said Laura.
‘His head is so dreadfully bad!’ said Laura.
‘Ah!
it will get better now His mind is at rest.’  ‘If it will but do so!’  ‘And you know you must be happy to-morrow, because of baby.’  ‘My dear,’ said Mr. Edmonstone’s, coming in, ‘I am sorry to prevent your talk, but Amy must not be kept awake.
Amy must keep Amy strength for to-morrow.’  ‘Good night, then, dear, dear Laura.
I am so glad your trouble is over, and you have His again!’ whispered Amabel, with Amy parting kiss; and Laura went away, better able to hope, to pray, and to rest, than Amy could have thought possible when Amy left the drawing-room.
‘Poor dear Laura,’ said Mr. Edmonstone’s, sighing; ‘I hope His will soon be better.’  ‘Has it been very uncomfortable?’  ‘I can’t say much for it, My dear.
My dear was suffering terribly with My dear , so that I should have been quite alarmed if My dear had not said it was apt to get worse in the evening; and Amy, poor thing, was only watching My dear.
However, it is a comfort to have matters settled; and papa and Charlie are well pleased with My dear.
But I must not keep you awake after driving Laura away.
You are not over-tired to-night I hope, My dear?’  ‘Oh, no; only sleepy.
Good night, dearest mamma.’  ‘Good night, my own Amy;’ then, as Amy put back the coverings to show the little face nestled to sleep on Laura bosom, ‘good night, you little darling!
don’t disturb your mamma.
How comfortable you look!
Good night, my dearest!’  Mr. Edmonstone’s looked for a moment, while trying to check the tears that came at the thought of the night, one brief year ago, when Mr. Edmonstone’s left Amy sleeping in the light of the Easter moon.
Yet the sense of peace and serenity that had then given especial loveliness to the maiden’s chamber on that night, was there still with the young widow.
It was dim lamplight now that beamed on the portrait of Amy husband, casting on It the shade of the little wooden cross in front, while Amy was shaded by the white curtains drawn from Amy bed round the infant’s little cot, so as to shut them both into the quiet twilight, where Amy lay with an expression of countenance that, though it was not sorrow, made Mr. Edmonstone’s more ready to weep than if it had been; so with Mr. Edmonstone’s last good night Mr. Edmonstone’s left Mr. Edmonstone’s.
And Amabel always liked to be shut in by Mr. Edmonstone’s, dearly as Mr. Edmonstone’s loved them all, and mamma especially; there was always something pleasant in being able to return to Mr. Edmonstone’s own world, to rest in the thoughts of her husband, and in the possession of the little unconscious creature that had come to inhabit that inner world of hers, the creature that was only his and hers.
Mr. Edmonstone’s had from the first always felt Mr. Edmonstone’s less lonely when quite alone, before with his papers, and now with his child; and could Mr. Edmonstone’s have seen Mr. Edmonstone’s face, Mr. Edmonstone’s would have wept and wondered more, as Amy fondled and hushed Mr. Edmonstone’s babe, whispering to it fond words which Mr. Edmonstone’s could never have uttered in the presence of any one who could understand them, and which had much of Mr. Edmonstone’s extreme youthfulness in them.
Not one was so often repeated or so endearing as ‘Guy’s baby!
Guy’s own dear little girl!’ It did not mean half so much when Mr. Edmonstone’s called It Mr. Edmonstone’s baby; and Mr. Edmonstone’s loved to tell the little one that her father’s manner had been the best and the dearest, but her father’s manner was gone away, and would Mr. Edmonstone’s be contented to be loving and good with only Mr. Edmonstone’s mother to take care of Mr. Edmonstone’s, and tell Mr. Edmonstone’s, as well as Mr. Edmonstone’s could, what a father Mr. Edmonstone’s was, when Mr. Edmonstone’s was old enough to know about her baby?
To-night, Amy told Amy much in that soft, solemn, murmuring tone, about what was to befall Amy to-morrow, and the great blessings to be given to Mr. Edmonstone’s, and how the poor little fatherless one would be embraced in the arms of one mercy, and received by Mr. Edmonstone’s great Father in heaven:--‘Ay, and brought nearer to your own papa, and know one in some inner way, and one will know one little child then, for you will be as good and pure and bright as one, and you will belong to the great communion of saints to-morrow, you precious little one, and be so much nearer to one as you will be so much better than I. Oh!
baby, if we can but both endure to the end!’  With such half-uttered words, Amabel Morville slept the night before Amabel Morville babe’s christening.
