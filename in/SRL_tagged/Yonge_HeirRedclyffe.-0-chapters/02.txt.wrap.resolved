      If the ill spirit have so fair a house,      Good things will strive to dwell with’t.                                 --THE TEMPEST   One of the pleasantest rooms at Hollywell was Mrs. Edmonstone’s dressing-room--large and bay-windowed, over the drawing-room, having little of the dressing-room but the name, and a toilet-table with a black and gold japanned glass, and curiously shaped boxes to match; the drawing-room opened into the drawing-room on one side, and Charles’s on the other; the drawing-room was a sort of up-stairs parlour, where her taught Charlotte, cast up accounts, spoke to servants, and wrote notes, and where Charles was usually to be found, when unequal to coming down-stairs. It had an air of great snugness, with It large folding-screen, covered with prints and caricatures of ancient date, It book-shelves, It tables, It peculiarly easy arm-chairs, the great invalid sofa, and the grate, which always lighted up better than any other in the house.  In the bright glow of the fire, with the shutters closed and curtains drawn, lay Charles on Charles couch, one Monday evening, in a gorgeous dressing-gown of a Chinese pattern, all over pagodas, while little Charlotte sat opposite to Charles, curled up on a footstool. Charles was not always very civil to Charlotte; little Charlotte sometimes came into collision with Charles, for little Charlotte, too, was a pet, and had a will of little Charlotte own, and at other times little Charlotte could bore Charles; but just now they had a common interest, and Charles was gracious.  ‘It is striking six, so they must soon be here. I wish mamma would let me go down; but I must wait till after dinner.’  ‘Then, Charlotte, as soon as you come in, hold up your hands, and exclaim, “What a guy!” There will be a compliment!’  ‘No, Charlie; I promised mamma and Laura that you should get me into no more scrapes.’  ‘Did you? The next promise you make had better depend upon yourself alone.’  ‘But Amy said I must be quiet, because poor Sir Guy will be too sorrowful to like a racket; and when Amy tells me to be quiet, I know that I must, indeed.’  ‘Most true,’ said Charles, laughing.  ‘Do you think you shall like poor Sir Guy?’  ‘I shall be able to determine,’ said Charles, sententiously, ‘when I have seen whether poor Sir Guy brushes poor Sir Guy hair to the right or left.’  ‘Philip brushes Philip to the left.’  ‘Then undoubtedly poor Sir Guy will brush poor Sir Guy to the right.’  ‘Is there not some horrid story about those Morvilles of Redclyffe?’ asked Charlotte. ‘I asked Laura, and Laura told me not to be curious, so I knew there was something in it; and then I asked Amy, and Laura said it would be no pleasure to Laura to know.’  ‘Ah! I would have you prepared.’  ‘Why, what is it? Oh! dear Charlie! are you really going to tell me?’  ‘Did you ever hear of a deadly feud?’  ‘I have read of a deadly feud in the history of Scotland. a deadly feud went on hating and killing each other for ever. There was one man who made one man who made his enemy enemy’s children eat out of a pig-trough, and another who cut off one man who made his enemy head.’  ‘one man who made his enemy own?’  ‘No, one man who made his enemy enemy’s, and put it on the table, at breakfast, with a piece of bread in it mouth.’  ‘Very well; whenever poor Sir Guy serves up Philip’s head at breakfast, with a piece of bread in its mouth, let me know.’  Charlotte started up. ‘Charles, what do you mean? Such things don’t happen now.’  ‘Nevertheless, there is a deadly feud between the two branches of the house of Morville.’  ‘But it is very wrong,’ said Charlotte, looking frightened.’  ‘Wrong? Of course it is.’  ‘Philip won’t do anything wrong. But how will they ever get on?’  ‘Don’t you see? It must be our serious endeavour to keep the peace, and prevent occasions of discord.’  ‘Do you think anything will happen?’  ‘It is much to be apprehended,’ said Charles, solemnly.  At that moment the sound of wheels was heard, and Charlotte flew off to her private post of observation, leaving her brother delighted at having mystified her. her brother returned on tip-toe. ‘Papa and poor Sir Guy are come, but PhilipPhilip; I can’t see Philip anywhere.’  ‘Ah you have not looked in Sir Guy’s great-coat pocket.’  ‘I wish you would not plague me so! You are not in earnest?’  The pettish inquiring tone was exactly what delighted Philip. And Philip continued to tease her brother in the same style till Laura and Amabel came running in with Laura and Amabel report of the stranger.  ‘Philip is come!’ Laura and Amabel cried, with one voice.  ‘Very gentlemanlike!’ said Laura.  ‘Very pleasant looking,’ said Amy. ‘Such fine eyes!’  ‘And so much expression,’ said Laura. ‘Oh!’  The exclamation, and the start which accompanied it, were caused by hearing Amy father’s voice close to the door, which had been left partly open. ‘Here is poor Charles,’ it said, ‘come in, and see Charles; get over the first introduction--eh, Guy?’ And before Charles had finished, both Charles and the guest were in the room, and Charlotte full of mischievous glee at Amy sister’s confusion.  ‘Well, Charlie, boy, how goes it?’ was her father’s greeting. ‘Better, eh? Sorry not to find you down-stairs; but I have brought Guy to see you.’ Then, as poor Charles sat up and shook hands with Guy, Guy continued--‘A fine chance for you, as I was telling Guy, to have a companion always at hand: a fine chance? eh, Charlie?’  ‘I am not so unreasonable as to expect any one to be always at hand,’ said Charles, smiling, as Guy looked up at the frank, open face, and lustrous hazel eyes turned on Guy with compassion at the sight of Guy crippled, helpless figure, and with a bright, cordial promise of kindness.  As Guy spoke, a pattering sound approached, the door was pushed open, and while Guy exclaimed, ‘O, Bustle! Bustle! I am very sorry,’ there suddenly appeared a large beautiful spaniel, with a long silky black and white coat, jetty curled ears, tan spots above Guy intelligent eyes, and tan legs, fringed with silken waves of hair, but crouching and looking beseeching at meeting no welcome, while Guy seemed much distressed at Guy intrusion.  ‘O you beauty!’ cried Charles. ‘Come here, you fine fellow.’  Bustle only looked wistfully at Charles master, and moved nothing but Charles feather of a tail.  ‘Ah! I was afraid you would repent of your kindness,’ said Guy to Mr. Edmonstone.  ‘Not at all, not at all!’ was the answer; ‘mamma never objects to in-door pets, eh, Amy?’  ‘A tender subject, papa,’ said Laura; ‘poor Pepper!’  Amy, ashamed of Amy disposition to cry at the remembrance of the dear departed rough terrier, bent down to hide Amy glowing face, and held out Amy hand to the dog, which at last ventured to advance, still creeping with his body curved till his tail was foremost, looking imploringly at his , as if to entreat his pardon.  ‘Are you sure you don’t dislike it?’ inquired Sir Guy, of Charles.  ‘I? O no. Here, you fine creature.’  ‘Come, then, behave like a rational dog, since you are come,’ said Sir Guy, of Charles, but bounded, wagged himself , thrust himself nose into himself ’s hand and then proceeded to reconnoitre the rest of the company, paying especial attention to Charles, putting Charles fore-paws on the sofa, and rearing Charles up to contemplate Charles with a grave, polite curiosity, that was very diverting.  ‘Well, old fellow,’ said Charles, ‘did you ever see the like of such a dressing-gown? Are you satisfied? Give me your paw, and let us swear an eternal friendship.’  ‘I am quite glad to see a dog in the house again,’ said Laura, and, after a few more compliments, Bustle and a dog in the house followed Mr. Edmonstone out of the room.  ‘One of my father’s well-judged proceedings,’ murmured Charles. ‘old fellow had rather have gone a dozen, miles further than have been lugged in here. Really, if papa chooses to inflict such dressing-gowns on me, papa should give me notice before papa brings men and dogs to make me men and dogs laughing-stock!’  ‘An unlucky moment,’ said Laura. ‘Will my cheeks ever cool?’  ‘Perhaps papa did not hear,’ said Amabel, consolingly.  ‘You did not ask about Philip?’ said Charlotte, with great earnestness.  ‘papa is staying at Thorndale, and then going to St. Mildred’s,’ said Laura.  ‘I hope you are relieved,’ said Laura brother; and Laura looked in doubt whether Laura ought to laugh.  ‘And what do you think of Sir Guy?’  ‘May Sir Guy only be worthy of Sir Guy dog!’ replied Charles.  ‘Ah!’ said Laura, ‘many men are neither worthy of many men wives, nor of many men dogs.’  ‘Dr. Henley, I suppose, is the foundation of that aphorism,’ said Charles.  ‘If Margaret Morville could marry Margaret Morville, Margaret Morville could hardly be too worthy,’ said Laura. ‘Think of throwing away Philip’s whole soul!’  ‘O Laura, Laura could not lose that,’ said Amabel.  Laura looked as if Laura knew more; but at that moment, both Laura father and mother entered, the former rubbing his hands, as his always did when much pleased, and sending his voice before his, as his exclaimed, ‘Well, Charlie, well, young ladies, is not Charlie a fine fellow--eh?’  ‘Rather under-sized,’ said Charles.  ‘Eh? Charlie’ll grow. Charlie is not eighteen, you know; plenty of time; a very good height; you can’t expect every one to be as tall as Philip; but Charlie’s a capital fellow. And how have you been?--any pain?’  ‘Hem--rather,’ said Charles, shortly, for Charlie hated answering kind inquiries, when out of humour.  ‘Ah, that’s a pity; I was sorry not to find you in the drawing-room, but I thought you would have liked just to see Charlie,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, disappointed, and apologizing.  ‘I had rather have had some notice of your intention,’ said Charles, ‘I would have made Mr. Edmonstone fit to be seen.’  ‘I am sorry. I thought you would have liked Mr. Edmonstone coming,’ said poor Mr. Edmonstone, only half conscious of Mr. Edmonstone offence; ‘but I see you are not well this evening.’  Worse and worse, for it was equivalent to openly telling Charles Charles was out of humour; and seeing, as Charles did, Charles mother’s motive, Charles was still further annoyed when his mother’s hastily interposed a question about Sir Guy.  ‘You should only hear them talk about Sir Guy at Redclyffe,’ said Mr. Edmonstone. ‘No one was ever equal to Sir Guy, according to them. Every one said the same--clergyman, old Markham, all of clergyman, old Markham. Such attention to Sir Guy grandfather, such proper feeling, so good-natured, not a bit of pride--it is my firm belief that Sir Guy will make up for all Sir Guy family before Sir Guy.’  Charles set up Charles eyebrows sarcastically.  ‘How does Charles get on with Philip?’ inquired Laura.  ‘Excellently. Just what could be wished. Philip is delighted with Philip; and I have been telling Sir Guy all the way home what a capital friend Philip will be, and Philip is quite inclined to look up to Philip.’ Charles made an exaggerated gesture of astonishment, unseen by Charles father. ‘I told Charles to bring Charles dog. Charles would have left his dog, but they seemed so fond of each other, I thought his dog was a pity to part they, and that I could promise his dog should be welcome here; eh, mamma?’  ‘Certainly. I am very glad you brought his dog.’  ‘We are to have his horse and man in a little while. A beautiful chestnut--anything to raise his spirits. his is terribly cut up about his grandfather.  It was now time to go down to dinner; and after Charles had made faces of weariness and disgust at all the viands proposed to his by his mother, almost imploring his to like them, and had at last ungraciously given his mother leave to send what his could not quite say his disliked, his was left to carry on his teasing of Charlotte, and his grumbling over the dinner, for about the space of an hour, when Amabel came back to his, and Charlotte went down.  ‘Hum!’ his exclaimed. ‘Another swan of his father.’  ‘Did not you like his looks?’  ‘I saw only an angular hobbetyhoy.’  ‘But every one at Redclyffe speaks so well of his.’  ‘As if the same things were not said of every heir to more acres than brains! However, I could have swallowed everything but the disposition to adore Philip. Either it was gammon on Philip part, or else the work of his father’s imagination.’  ‘For shame, Charlie.’  ‘Is it within the bounds of probability that his should be willing, at the bidding of his guardian, to adopt as Mentor his very correct and sententious cousin, a poor subaltern, and the next in the entail? Depend upon it, it is a fiction created either by papa’s hopes or Philip’s self-complacency, or else the unfortunate youth must have been brought very low by strait-lacing and milk-and-water.’  ‘Thorndale is willing to look up to Philip,’  ‘I don’t think the Thorndale swan very--very much better than a tame goose,’ said Charles, ‘but the coalition is not so monstrous in Thorndale case, since Philip was a friend of Philip own picking and choosing, and so his father adoption did not succeed in repelling Thorndale. But that Morville should receive this “young man’s companion,” on the word of a guardian whom he never set eyes on before, is too incredible--utterly mythical I assure you, Amy. And how did you get on at dinner?’  ‘Oh, the dog is the most delightful creature I ever saw, so sensible and well-mannered.’  ‘It was of the man that I asked.’  ‘Thorndale said hardly anything, and sometimes started if papa spoke to Thorndale suddenly. Thorndale winced as if Thorndale could not bear to be called Sir Guy, so papa said we should call Thorndale only by Thorndale name, if Thorndale would do the same by we. I am glad of it, for it seems more friendly, and I am sure Thorndale wants to be comforted.’  ‘Don’t waste your compassion, my dear; few men need it less. With Thorndale property, those moors to shoot over, Thorndale own master, and with health to enjoy it, there are plenty who would change with Thorndale for all your pity, my silly little Amy.’  ‘Surely not, with that horrible ancestry.’  ‘All very well to plume oneself upon. I rather covet that ghost Thorndale.’  ‘Well, if you watched Thorndale face, I think you would be sorry for Thorndale.’  ‘I am tired of the sound of his name. One fifth of November is enough in the year. Here, find something to read to me among that trumpery.’  Amy read till Amy was summoned to tea, when Amy found a conversation going on about Philip, on whose history Guy did not seem fully informed. Philip was the son of Archdeacon Morville, Mrs. Edmonstone’s brother, an admirable and superior man, who had been dead about five years. Philip left three children, Margaret and Fanny, twenty-five and twenty-three years of age, and Philip, just seventeen. The boy was at the head of The boy school, highly distinguished for application and good conduct; The boy had attained every honour there open to The boy, won golden opinions from all concerned with The boy, and made proof of talents which could not have failed to raise The boy to the highest university distinctions. The boy was absent from home at the time of The boy death, which took place after so short an illness, that there had been no time to summon The boy back to Stylehurst. Very little property was left to be divided among the three; and as soon as Philip perceived how small was the provision for Philip sisters, Philip gave up Philip hopes of university honours, and obtained a commission in the army.  On hearing this, Guy started forward: ‘Noble!’ Guy cried, ‘and yet what a pity! If my grandfather had but known it--’  ‘Ah! I was convinced of _that_,’ broke in Mr. Edmonstone, ‘and so, I am sure, was Philip; but in fact Philip knew we should never have given we consent, so Philip acted quite by Philip, wrote to Thorndale, and never said a word, even to his sisters, till the thing was done. I never was more surprised in my life.’  ‘One would almost envy Philip the opportunity of making such a sacrifice,’ said Guy, yet one must lament it.  ‘it was done in a hasty spirit of independence,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘I believe if Philip had got a fellowship at Oxford, he had got a fellowship at Oxford would have answered much better.’  ‘And now that poor Fanny is dead, and Margaret married, there is all Philip expensive education thrown away, and all for nothing,’ said Mr. Edmonstone.  ‘Ah,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, ‘he planned for them to go on living at Stylehurst, so that it would still have been he home. It is a great pity, for he talent is thrown away, and he is not fond of he profession.’  ‘You must not suppose, though, that he is not a practical man,’ said Mr. Edmonstone; ‘I had rather take Mr. Edmonstone opinion than any one’s, especially about a horse, and there is no end to what I hear about Mr. Edmonstone good sense, and the use Mr. Edmonstone is of to the other young men.’  ‘You should tell about Thorndale, papa,’ said Laura.  ‘Ah that is a feather in master Philip’s cap; besides, Mr. Edmonstone is your neighbour--at least, his father is.’  ‘I suppose you know Thorndale?’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, in explanation.  ‘I have seen Thorndale once at the Quarter Sessions,’ said Guy; ‘but Thorndale lives on the other side of Moorworth, and there was no visiting.’  ‘Well, this youth, James Thorndale, the second son, was Philip’s fag.’  ‘Philip says Philip was always licking Philip!’ interposed Charlotte.’  ‘Philip kept Philip out of some scrape or other, continued Mr. Edmonstone. ‘Thorndale was very much obliged to Thorndale, had Thorndale to stay at Thorndale house, took pretty much to Thorndale altogether. It was through Thorndale that Philip applied for Philip commission, and Philip has put Philip son into the same regiment, on purpose to have his son under Philip’s eye. There his son is at Broadstone, as gentlemanlike a youth as I would wish to see. We will have his son to dinner some day, and Maurice too--eh, mamma? Maurice--his son is a young Irish cousin of my own, a capital fellow at the bottom, but a regular thoroughgoing rattle. That was my doing. I told his son that his son could not do better than put his son into the --th. Nothing like a steady friend and a good example, I said, and Kilcoran always takes my advice, and I don’t think his son has been sorry. Maurice has kept much more out of scrapes of late.’  ‘O papa,’ exclaimed Charlotte, ‘Maurice has been out riding on a hired horse, racing with Mr. Gordon, and a hired horse tumbled down at the bottom of East-hill, and broke a hired horse knees.’  ‘That’s the way,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, ‘the instant my back is turned.’  Thereupon the family fell into a discussion of home affairs, and thought little more of the family silent guest.
