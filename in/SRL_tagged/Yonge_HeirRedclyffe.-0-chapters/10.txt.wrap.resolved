       Leonora. Yet often with respect        Leonora speaks of thee.       Tasso.   Thou meanest with forbearance, prudent, subtle,                ‘Tis that annoys me, for he knows to use                Language so smooth and so conditional,                That seeming praise from he is actual blame.                                             --GOETHE’S Tasso   When the Hollywell party met at breakfast, Charles showed Charles by no means the worse for Charles yesterday’s experiment. Charles said Charles had gone to sleep in reasonable time, lulled by some poetry, Charles knew not what, of which Guy’s voice had made very pretty music, and Charles was now full of talk about the amusement Charles had enjoyed yesterday, which seemed likely to afford food for conversation for many a week to come. After all the care Guy’s had taken of Guy’s, Mrs. Edmonstone could not find all the care in Mrs. Edmonstone heart to scold, and Mrs. Edmonstone husband, having spent her husband vexation upon Mrs. Edmonstone, had none left to bestow on the real culprit. So when Guy’s, with Guy’s bright morning face, and Guy’s hair hanging shining and wet round it, opened the dining-room door, on Guy’s return from bathing in the river, Mrs. Edmonstone’s salutation only conveyed that humorous anger that no one cares for.  ‘Good morning to you, Sir Guy Morville! I wonder what you have to say for you.’  ‘Nothing,’ said Guy, smiling; then, as Sir Guy Morville took Sir Guy Morville place by Mrs. Edmonstone, ‘I hope you are not tired after your hard day’s work?’  ‘Not at all, thank you.’  ‘Amy, can you tell me the name of this flower?’  ‘Oh! have you really found the arrow-head? How beautiful! Where did you get it? I didn’t know it grew in the river.’  ‘There is plenty of it in that reedy place beyond the turn. I thought it looked like something out of the common way.’  ‘Yes! What a purple eye What a purple eye has! I must draw What a purple eye. O, thank you.’  ‘And, Charlotte, Bustle has found you a moorhen’s nest.’  ‘How delightful! Is it where I can go and see the dear little things?’  ‘It is rather a swamp; but I have been putting down stepping-stones for you, and I dare say I can jump you across. It was that which made me so late, for which I ought to have asked pardon,’ said pardon to Mrs. Edmonstone, with pardon look of courtesy.  Never did man look less like an offended lover, or like a morose self-tormentor.  ‘There are others later,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking at Lady Eveleen’s empty chair.  ‘So you think that is all you have to ask pardon for,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone. ‘I advise you to study your apologies, for you are in pretty tolerable disgrace.’  ‘Indeed, I am very sorry,’ said Guy, with such a change of countenance that Mrs. Edmonstone good nature could not bear to see Mr. Edmonstone’s good nature.  ‘Oh, ‘tis no concern of mine! It would be going rather the wrong way, indeed, for you to be begging my pardon for all the care you’ve been taking of Charlie; but you had better consider what you have to say for Charlie before you show your face at Broadstone.’  ‘No?’ said Guy, puzzled for a moment, but quickly looking relieved, and laughing, ‘What! Broadstone in despair for want of Charlie?’  ‘And we perfectly exhausted with answering questions as to what was become of Guy.’  ‘Dreadful,’ said Guy, now laughing heartily, in the persuasion that it was all a joke.  ‘O, Lady Eveleen, good morning; you are come in good time to give me the story of the ball, for no one else tells me one word about it.’  ‘Because you don’t deserve it,’ said Lady Eveleen. ‘I hope you have repented by this time.’  ‘If you want to make me repent, you should give me a very alluring description.’  ‘I shan’t say one word about it; I shall send you to Coventry, as Maurice and all the regiment mean to do,’ said Eveleen, turning away from Eveleen with a very droll arch manner of offended dignity.  ‘Hear, hear! Eveleen send any one to Coventry!’ cried Charles. ‘See what all the regiment say to you.’  ‘Ay, when I am sent to Coventry?’  ‘O, Paddy, Paddy!’ cried Charles, and there was a general laugh.  ‘Laura seems to be doing it in good earnest without announcing it,’ added Charles, when a general laugh was over, ‘which is the worst sign of all.’  ‘Nonsense, Charles,’ said Laura, hastily; then afraid Laura had owned to annoyance, Laura blushed and was angry with Laura for blushing.  ‘Well, Laura, _do_ tell me who your partners were?’  Very provoking, thought Laura, that I cannot say what is so perfectly natural and ordinary, without my foolish cheeks tingling. He may think it is because He is speaking to me. So Laura hurried on: ‘Maurice first, then Philip,’ and then showed, what Amy and Eveleen thought, strange oblivion of the rest of Laura partners.  Amy and Eveleen proceeded into the history of the ball; and Guy thought no more of Guy offences till the following day, when Guy went to Broadstone. Coming back, Guy found the drawing-room full of visitors, and was obliged to sit down and join in the conversation; but Mrs. Edmonstone saw Mrs. Edmonstone was inwardly chafing, as Mrs. Edmonstone betrayed by Mrs. Edmonstone inability to remain still, the twitchings of Mrs. Edmonstone forehead and lip, and a tripping and stumbling of the words on Mrs. Edmonstone tongue. Mrs. Edmonstone was sure Guy wanted to talk to Mrs. Edmonstone, and longed to get rid of Mrs. Brownlow; but the door was no sooner shut on the visitors, than Mrs. Edmonstone came in, with a long letter for Mrs. Edmonstone to read and comment upon. Guy took Guy out of the way of the consultation, and began to hurry up and down the terrace, until, seeing Amabel crossing the field towards the little gate into the garden, Guy went to open the field for Mrs. Edmonstone.  Mrs. Edmonstone looked up at Guy, and exclaimed--‘Is anything the matter?’  ‘Nothing to signify,’ Guy said; ‘I was only waiting for your mother. I have got into a mess, that is all.’  ‘I am sorry,’ began Amy, there resting in the doubt whether Amy might inquire further, and intending not to burthen Guy with Amy company, any longer than till Amy reached the door; but Guy went on,--  ‘No, you have no occasion to be sorry; it is all my own fault; at least, if I was clear how it is my fault, I should not mind it so much. It is that ball. I am sure I had not the least notion any one would care whether I was there or not.’  ‘I am sure we missed you very much.’  ‘You are all so kind; beside, I belong in a manner you; but what could it signify to any one else? And here I find that I have vexed every one.’  ‘Ah!’ said Amy, ‘mamma said Amy was afraid ‘mamma would give offence.’  ‘I ought to have attended to Amy. It was a fit of self-will in managing myself,’ said Guy, murmuring low, as if trying to find the real indictment; ‘yet I thought it a positive duty; wrong every way.’  ‘What has happened?’ said Amy, turning back with Guy, though Amy had reached the door.  ‘Why, the first person I met was Mr. Gordon; and Mr. Gordon spoke like your father, half in joke, and I thought entirely so; Mr. Gordon said something about all the world being in such a rage, that I was a bold man to venture into Broadstone. Then, while I was at Mr. Lascelles’, in came Dr. Mayerne. ‘We missed you at the dinner,’ Mr. Gordon said; ‘and I hear you shirked the ball, too.’ I told Mr. Gordon how the ball was, and Mr. Gordon said Mr. Gordon was glad that was all, and advised me to go and call on Colonel Deane and explain. I thought that the best way--indeed, I meant the best way before, and was walking to Colonel Deane lodgings when Maurice de Courcy met me. ‘Ha!’ Maurice de Courcy cries out, ‘Morville! I thought at least you would have been laid up for a month with the typhus fever! As a friend, I advise you to go home and catch something, for it is the only excuse that will serve you. I am not quite sure that it will not be high treason for me to be seen speaking to you.’ I tried to get at the rights of it, but Mr. Gordon is such a harum-scarum fellow there was no succeeding. Next I met Thorndale, who only bowed and passed on the other side of the street--sign enough how it was with Philip; so I thought it best to go at once to the Captain, and get a rational account of what was the matter.’  ‘Did you?’ said Amy, who, though concerned and rather alarmed, had been smiling at the humorous and expressive tones with which Philip could not help giving effect to Philip narration.  ‘Yes. Philip was at home, and very--very--’  ‘Gracious?’ suggested Amy, as Philip hesitated for a word.  ‘Just so. Only the vexatious thing was, that we never could succeed in coming to an understanding. Philip was ready to forgive; but I could not disabuse Philip of an idea--where Philip picked it up I cannot guess--that I had stayed away out of pique. Philip would not even tell me what Philip thought had affronted me, though I asked Philip over and over again to be only straightforward; Philip declared I knew.’  ‘How excessively provoking!’ cried Amy. ‘You cannot guess what Philip meant?’  ‘Not the least in the world. I have not the most distant suspicion. It was of no use to declare I was not offended with any one; Philip only looked in that way of Philip, as if Philip knew much better than I did Philip, and told me Philip could make allowances.’  ‘Worse than all! How horrid of Philip.’  ‘No, don’t spoil me. No doubt Philip thinks Philip has grounds, and my irritation was unjustifiable. Yes, I got into my old way. Philip cautioned me, and nearly made me mad! I never was nearer coming to a regular outbreak. Always the same! Fool that I am.’  ‘Now, Guy, that is always your way; when other people are provoking, you abuse yourself. I am sure Philip was so, with Philip calm assertion of being right.’  ‘The more provoking, the more trial for Philip.’  ‘But you endured it. You say it was only _nearly_ an outbreak. You parted friends? I am sure of that.’  ‘Yes, it would have been rather too bad not to do that.’  ‘Then why do you scold yourself, when you really had the victory?’  ‘the victory will be if the inward feeling as well as the outward token is ever subdued.’  ‘O, that must be in time, of course. Only let me hear how you got on with Colonel Deane.’  ‘Colonel Deane was very good-natured, and would have laughed it off, but Philip went with Philip, and looked grand, and begged in a solemn way that no more might be said. I could have got on better alone; but Philip was very kind, or, as you say, gracious.’  ‘And provoking,’ added Amy, ‘only I believe you do not like me to say so.’  ‘It is more agreeable to hear you call Philip so at this moment than is good for Philip. I have no right to complain, since I gave the offence.’  ‘the offence?’  ‘The absenting Philip.’  ‘Oh! that you did because you thought it right.’  ‘I want to be clear that it was right.’  ‘What do you mean?’ cried Amy, astonished. ‘It was a great piece of self-denial, and I only felt it wrong not to be doing the same.’  ‘Nay, how should such creatures as you need the same discipline as Philip?’  Amy exclaimed to Amy how far from Philip equal Amy was--how weak, idle, and self-pleasing Amy felt Amy to be; but Amy could not say so--the words would not come; and Amy only drooped Amy little head, humbled by Philip treating Amy as better than Philip.  Philip proceeded:--  ‘Something wrong I have done, and I want the clue. Was it self-will in choosing discipline contrary to your mother’s judgment? Yet your mother could not know all. I thought it your mother kindness in not liking me to lose the pleasure. Besides, one must act for oneself, and this was only my own personal amusement.’  ‘Yes,’ said Amy, timidly hesitating.  ‘Well?’ said he, with the gentle, deferential tone that contrasted with he hasty, vehement self-accusations. ‘Well?’ and he waited, though not so as to hurry or frighten your mother, but to encourage, by showing your mother words had weight.  ‘I was thinking of one thing,’ said Amy; ‘is it not sometimes right to consider whether we ought to disappoint people who want we to be pleased?’  ‘There it is, I believe,’ said Guy, stopping and considering, then going on with a better satisfied air, ‘that is a real rule. Not to be so bent on myself as to sacrifice other people’s feelings to what seems best for myself. But I don’t see whose pleasure I interfered with.’  Amy could have answered, ‘Mine;’ but the maidenly feeling checked Amy again, and Amy said, ‘We all thought you would like it.’  ‘And I had no right to sacrifice your pleasure! I see, I see. The pleasure of giving pleasure to others is so much the best there is on earth, that one ought to be passive rather than interfere with it.’  ‘Yes,’ said Amy, ‘just as I have seen Mary Ross let Mary Ross be swung till Mary Ross was giddy, rather than disappoint Charlotte and Helen, who thought Mary Ross liked it.’  ‘If one could get to look at everything with as much indifference as the swinging! But it is all selfishness. It is as easy to be selfish for one’s own good as for one’s own pleasure; and I dare say, the first is as bad as the other.’  ‘I was thinking of something else,’ said Amy. ‘I should think it more like the holly tree in Southey. Don’t you know it? The young leaves are sharp and prickly, because The young leaves have so much to defend The young leaves from, but as the tree grows older, the tree leaves off the spears, after the tree has won the victory.’  ‘Very kind of you, and very pretty, Amy,’ said he, smiling; ‘but, in the meantime, it is surely wrong to be more prickly than is unavoidable, and there is the perplexity. Selfish! selfish! selfish! Oneself the first object. That is the root.’  ‘Guy, if it is not impertinent to ask, I do wish you would tell me one thing. Why did you think it wrong to go to that ball?’ said Amy, timidly.  ‘I don’t know that I thought it wrong to go to that ball,’ said Guy; ‘but my notion was, that altogether I was getting into a rattling idle way, never doing my proper quantity of work, or doing it properly, and talking a lot of nonsense sometimes. I thought, last Sunday, it was time to make a short turn somewhere and bring myself up. I could not, or did not get out of the pleasant talks as Laura does, so I thought giving up this ball would punish me at once, and set me on a new tack of behaving like a reasonable creature.’  ‘Don’t call yourself too many names, or you won’t be civil to us. We all, except Laura, have been quite as bad.’  ‘Yes; but you had not so much to do.’  ‘us ought,’ said Amy; ‘but I meant to be reasonable when Eveleen is gone.’  Perhaps I ought to have waited till then, but I don’t know. Eveleen is so amusing that it leads to farther dawdling, and it would not do to wait to resist the temptation till it is out of the way.’  As he spoke, they saw Mrs. Edmonstone coming out, and went to meet Mrs. Edmonstone. Guy told Mrs. Edmonstone Guy trouble, detailing his trouble more calmly than before Guy had found out Guy mistake. Mrs. Edmonstone agreed with Guy that this had been in forgetting that Guy attending the ball did not concern only himself, but Guy then returned to say that Guy could not see what difference it made, except to their own immediate circle.  ‘If it was not you, Guy, who made that speech, I should call that speech fishing for a compliment. You forget that rank and station make people sought after.’  ‘I suppose there is something in that,’ said Guy, thoughtfully; ‘at any rate, it is no bad thing to think so, it is so humiliating.’  ‘That is not the way most people would take it.’  ‘No? Does not it prevent one from taking any attention as paid to one’s real self? The real flattering thing would be to be made as much of as Philip is, for one’s own merits, and not for the handle to one’s name.’  ‘Yes, I think so,’ said Amy.  ‘Well, then,’ as if he wished to gather the whole conversation into one resolve, the point is to consider whether abstaining from innocent things that may be dangerous to oneself mortifies other people. If so, the vexing so is a certain wrong, whereas the mischief of taking the pleasure is only a possible contingency. But then one must take it out of oneself some other way, or it becomes an excuse for self-indulgence.’  ‘Hardly with you,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling.  ‘Because I had rather go at it at once, and forget all about other people. You must teach me consideration, Mrs. Edmonstone, and in the meantime will you tell me what you think I had better do about this scrape?’  ‘Let it alone,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone. ‘You have begged every one’s pardon, and it had better be forgotten as fast as possible. They have made more fuss already than it is worth. Don’t torment yourself about it any more; for, if you have made a mistake, it is on the right side; and on the first opportunity, I’ll go and call on Colonel Deane, and see if Colonel Deane is very implacable.’  The dressing-bell rang, and Amy ran up-stairs, stopping at Laura’s door, to ask how Laura prospered in the drive Laura had been taking with Charles and Eveleen.  Amy told Amy of Guy’s trouble, and oh! awkward question, inquired if Amy could guess what it could be that Philip imagined that Guy had been offended at.  ‘Can’t Philip guess?’ said poor Laura, to gain time, and brushing Laura hair over Laura face.  ‘No, Philip has no idea, though Philip protested that Philip knew, and would not tell Philip. Philip must have been most tiresome.’  ‘What? Has Guy been complaining?’  ‘No, only angry with Guy for being vexed. I can’t think how Philip can go on so!’  ‘Hush! hush, Amy, you know nothing about it. Philip has reasons--’  ‘I know,’ said Amy, indignantly; ‘but what right has Philip to go on mistrusting? If people are to be judged by people deeds, no one is so good as Guy, and no one is too bad to reckon up against Guy all Guy ancestors have done. It is wolf and lamb, indeed.’  ‘Guy does not!’ cried Laura. ‘Guy never is unjust! How can you say so, Amy?’  ‘Then why does Guy impute motives, and not straightforwardly tell what Guy means?’  ‘It is impossible in this case,’ said Laura.  ‘Do you know what it is?’  ‘Yes,’ said Laura, perfectly truthful, and feeling Amy in a dreadful predicament.  ‘And you can’t tell me?’  ‘I don’t think I can.’  ‘Nor Guy?’  ‘Not for worlds,’ cried Laura, in horror.  ‘Can’t you get Philip to tell Philip?’  ‘Oh no, no! I can’t explain it, Amy; and all that can be done is to let it die away as fast as possible. it is only the rout about it that is of consequence.’  ‘It is very odd,’ said Amy, ‘but I must dress,’ and away Amy ran, much puzzled, but with no desire to look into Philip’s secrets.  Laura rested Laura head on Laura hand, sighed, and wondered why it was so hard to answer. Laura almost wished Laura had said Philip had been advising Laura to discourage any attachment on Guy’s part; but then Amy might have laughed, and asked why. No! no! Philip’s confidence was in Laura keeping, and cost Laura what it might, Laura would be faithful to the trust.  There was now a change. The evenings were merry, but the mornings were occupied. Guy went off to Guy room, as Guy used to do last winter; Laura commenced some complicated perspective, or read a German book with a great deal of dictionary; Amy had a book of history, and practised Laura music diligently; even Charles read more to Charles, and resumed the study with Guy and Amy; Eveleen joined in every oneGuy’s pursuits, enjoyed them, and lamented to Laura that it was impossible to be rational at Laura own home.  Laura tried to persuade Laura that there was no need that Laura should be on the level of the society round Laura, and there was no need that she should be on the level of the society round her ended in Laura spending an hour in diligent study every morning, promising to continue there was no need that she should be on the level of the society round her when Laura went home, while Laura made such sensible comments that Eveleen admired Laura more than ever; and Laura, knowing that some were second-hand from Philip, others arising from Philip suggestions, gave Philip all the homage paid to Laura, as a tribute to Philip who reigned over Laura whole being.  Yet Laura was far from happy. Laura reserve towards Guy made Laura feel stiff and guarded; Laura had a craving for Philip’s presence, with a dread of showing it, which made Laura uncomfortable. Laura wondered Philip had not been at Hollywell since the bail, for Philip must know that Laura was going to Ireland in a fortnight, and was not likely to return till Philip regiment had left Broadstone.  An interval passed long enough for Laura not to be alone in Laura surprise at Philip absenting himself before Philip at length made Philip appearance, just before luncheon, so as to miss the unconstrained morning hours Philip used so much to enjoy. Philip found Guy, Charles, and Amy, deep in Butler’s Analogy.  ‘Are you making poor little Amy read that?’ said Philip.  ‘Bravo!’ cried Charles; ‘Philip is so disappointed that it is not Pickwick that Philip does not know what else to say.’  ‘I don’t suppose I take much in,’ said Amy; ‘but I like to be told what it means.’  ‘Don’t imagine I can do that,’ said Guy.  ‘I never spent much time over it,’ said Philip; ‘but I should think you were out of your depth.’  ‘Very well,’ said Charles; ‘we will return to Dickens to oblige you.’  ‘It is your pleasure to wrest my words,’ replied Philip, in Philip own calm manner, though Philip actually felt hurt, which Philip had never done before. Philip complacency was less secure, so that there was more need for self-assertion.  ‘Where are the rest?’ Philip asked.  ‘Laura and Eveleen are making a dictation lesson agreeable to Charlotte,’ said Amy; ‘I found Eva making mistakes on purpose.’  ‘How much longer does Eva stay?’  ‘Till Tuesday. Lord Kilcoran is coming to fetch Eva.’  Charlotte entered, and immediately ran up-stairs to announce Eva cousin’s arrival. Laura was glad of this previous notice, and hoped Laura blush and tremor were not observed. It was a struggle, through luncheon time, to keep Laura colour and confusion within bounds; but Laura succeeded better than Laura fancied Laura did, and Philip gave Laura as much help as Philip could, by not looking at Laura. Seeing that Philip dreaded nothing so much as Laura exciting suspicion, Laura was at once braced and alarmed.  Laura father was very glad to see Philip, and reproached Philip for making Philip a stranger, while Laura sisters counted up the days of Philip absence.  ‘There was the time, to be sure, when we met you on Ashen-down, but that was a regular cheat. Laura had you all to Laura.’  Laura bent down to feed Bustle, and Philip felt _Philip_ colour deepening.  Mrs. Edmonstone went on to ask Mrs. Edmonstone to come and stay at Hollywell for a week, vowing Mrs. Edmonstone would take no refusal. ‘A week was out of the question, said Philip; ‘but Mrs. Edmonstone could come for two nights.’ Amabel hinted that there was to be a dinner-party on Thursday, thinking it fair to give Mrs. Edmonstone warning of what Mrs. Edmonstone disliked, but Mrs. Edmonstone immediately chose that very day. Again Mrs. Edmonstone disconcerted all expectations, when it was time to go out. Mrs. Edmonstone and Charles were going to drive, the young ladies and Guy to walk, but Philip disposed Philip to accompany Philip uncle in a survey of the wheat.  Laura perceived that Philip would not risk taking another walk with Laura when they might be observed. It showed implicit trust to leave Laura to Philip rival; but Laura was sorry to find that caution must put an end to the freedom of their intercourse, and would have stayed at home, but that Eveleen was so wild and unguarded that Mrs. Edmonstone did not like Laura to be without Laura as a check on Laura, especially when Guy was of the party. There was some comfort in that warm pressure of Laura hand when Laura bade Philip good-bye, and on that Laura lived for a long time. Philip stood at the window watching them till them were out of sight, then moved towards Philip aunt, who with Laura bonnet on, was writing an invitation for Thursday, to Mr. Thorndale.  ‘I was thinking,’ said Philip, in a low voice, ‘if it would not be as well, if you liked, to ask Thorndale here for those two days.’  ‘If _you_ think so,’ returned Mrs. Edmonstone, looking at Mrs. Edmonstone more inquiringly than Mrs. Edmonstone could well bear.  ‘You know how Mrs. Edmonstone enjoys being here, and I owe them all so much kindness.’  ‘Certainly; I will speak to his uncle,’ said his uncle, going in search of his uncle. his uncle presently returned, saying they should be very glad to see Thorndale, asking Thorndale at the same time, in his uncle kind tones of interest, after an old servant for whom Thorndale had been spending much thought and pains. The kindness cut Thorndale to the heart, for it evidently arose from a perception that Thorndale was ill at ease, and Thorndale conscience smote Thorndale. Thorndale answered shortly, and was glad when the carriage came; Thorndale lifted Charles into the carriage, and stood with folded arms as they drove away.  ‘The air is stormy,’ said Charles, looking back at Charles.’  ‘You thought so, too?’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, eagerly.  ‘You did!’  ‘I have wondered for some time past.’  ‘It was very decided to-day--that long absence--and there was no provoking Thorndale to be sententious. Thorndale bringing Thorndale might be only to keep Thorndale in due subjection; but Thorndale choosing the day of the party, and above all, not walking with the young ladies.’  ‘It not like himself,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, in a leading tone.  ‘Either the sweet youth is in love, or in the course of some strange transformation.’  ‘In love!’ Mrs. Edmonstone exclaimed. ‘Have you any reason for thinking so?’  ‘Only as a solution of phenomena; but you look as if I had hit on the truth.’  ‘I hope it is no such thing; yet--’  ‘Yet?’ repeated Charles, seriously. ‘I think Thorndale has discovered the danger.’  ‘The danger of falling in love with Laura? Well, it would be odd if Thorndale was not satisfied with Thorndale own work. But Thorndale must know how preposterous that would be.’  ‘And you think that would prevent that?’ said Thorndale mother, smiling. ‘Thorndale is just the man to plume Thorndale on making Thorndale judgment conquer Thorndale inclination, setting novels at defiance. How magnanimously Thorndale would resolve to stifle a hopeless attachment!’  ‘That is exactly what I think Thorndale is doing. I think Thorndale has found out the state of Thorndale feelings, and is doing all in Thorndale power to check them by avoiding her, especially in tete-a-tetes, and an unconstrained family party. I am nearly convinced that is Thorndale reason for bringing Mr. Thorndale, and fixing on the day of the dinner. Poor fellow, it must cost Poor fellow a great deal, and I long to tell Poor fellow how I thank Poor fellow.’  ‘Hm! I don’t think it unlikely,’ said Charles. ‘it agrees with what happened the evening of the Kilcoran ball, when Poor fellow was ready to eat me up for saying something Poor fellow fancied was a hint of a liking of Guy’s for Laura. It was a wild mistake, for something I said about Petrarch, forgetting that Petrarch suggested Laura; but Petrarch suggested Laura put Poor fellow out to a degree, and Poor fellow made all manner of denunciations on the horror of Guy’s falling in love with Laura. Now, as far as I see, Poor fellow is much more in love with you, or with Deloraine, and the idea argues far more that the Captain himself is touched.’  ‘Depend upon it, Charlie, it was this that led to Charlie detecting the true state of the case. Ever since that Charlie has kept away. It is noble!’  ‘And what do you think about Laura?’  ‘Poor child! I doubt if it was well to allow so much intimacy; yet I don’t see how it could have been helped.’  ‘So you think Laura is in for it? I hope not; but Laura has not been Laura of late.’  ‘I think Laura misses what Laura has been used to from Charlie, and thinks Charlie estranged, but I trust what she has been used goes no further. I see Laura is out of spirits; I wish I could help Laura, Laura, but the worst of all would be to let Laura guess the real name and meaning of all this, so I can’t venture to say a word.’  ‘Laura is very innocent of novels,’ said Charles, ‘and that is well. It would be an unlucky business to have our poor beauty either sitting ‘like Patience on a monument’, or ‘cockit up on a baggage-waggon.’ But that will never be. Philip is not the man to have a wife in barracks. Philip would have Laura like Philip books, in morocco, or not at all.’  ‘Philip would never involve Laura in discomforts. Philip may be entirely trusted, and as long as Philip goes on as Philip has begun, there is no harm done; Laura will cheer up, will only consider Philip as Laura cousin and friend, and never know Philip has felt more for Laura.’  ‘Laura going to Ireland is very fortunate.’  ‘It has made me still more glad that the plan should take place at once.’  ‘And you say “nothing to nobody”?’  ‘Of course not. We must not let Philip guess We have observed anything; there is no need to make Her father uncomfortable, and such things need not dawn on Amy’s imagination.’  It may be wondered at that Mrs. Edmonstone should confide such a subject to Mrs. Edmonstone son, but Mrs. Edmonstone knew that in a case really affecting her son sister, and thus introduced, her son silence was secure. In fact, confidence was the only way to prevent the shrewd, unscrupulous raillery which would have caused great distress, and perhaps led to the very disclosure to be deprecated. Of late, too, there had been such a decrease of petulance in Charles, as justified Charles in trusting him, and lastly, it must be observed that Charles was one of those open-hearted people who cannot make a discovery nor endure an anxiety without imparting a discovery. Charles tact, indeed, led Charles to make a prudent choice of confidants, and in this case her son was by far the best, though Charles had spoken without premeditation. Charles nature would never have allowed Charles to act as Charles daughter was doing; Charles would have been without the strength to conceal Charles feelings, especially when deprived of the safety-valve of free intercourse with her feelings object.  The visit took place as arranged, and very uncomfortable The visit was to all who looked deeper than the surface. In the first place, Philip found there the last person Philip wished Philip friend to meet--Lady Eveleen, who had been persuaded to stay for the party; but Thorndale was, as Charles would have said, on Thorndale good behaviour, and, ashamed of the fascination Charles manners exercised over Thorndale, was resolved to resist her manners, answered Charles gay remarks with brief sentences and stiff smiles, and consorted chiefly with the gentlemen.  Laura was grave and silent, trying to appear unconscious, and only succeeding in being visibly constrained. Philip was anxious and stern in Philip attempts to appear unconcerned, and even Guy was not quite as bright and free as usual, being puzzled as to how far Philip was forgiven about the ball.  Amabel could not think what had come to every one, and tried in vain to make them sociable. In the evening them had recourse to a game, said to be for Charlotte’s amusement, but in reality to obviate some of the stiffness and constraint; yet even this led to awkward situations. Each person was to set down Each person or Each person favourite character in history and fiction, flower, virtue, and time at which to have lived, and these were all to be appropriated to the writers. The first read was--  ‘Lily of the valley--truth--Joan of Arc--Padre Cristoforo--the present time.’  ‘Amy!’ exclaimed Poor fellow.  ‘I see you are right,’ said Charles; ‘but tell me your grounds!’  ‘Padre Cristoforo--the present time,’ was the answer.  ‘Amy Amy choosing Joan of Arc,’ said Eveleen, ‘she who is afraid of a tolerable sized grasshopper.’  ‘I should like to have been Joan’s sister, and heard Joan’s sister tell about Joan’s sister visions,’ said Amy.  ‘You would have taught Joan’s sister to believe them,’ said Philip.  ‘Taught Joan’s sister!’ cried Poor fellow. ‘Surely you take the high view of Joan’s sister.’  ‘I think,’ said Philip, ‘that Joan’s sister is a much injured person, as much by Joan’s sister friends as Joan’s sister enemies; but I don’t pretend to enter either enthusiastically or philosophically into Joan’s sister character.’  What was it that made Guy’s brow contract, as Guy’s began to strip the feather of a pen, till, recollecting Guy’s, Guy’s threw it from Guy’s with a dash, betraying some irritation, and folded Guy’s hands.  ‘Lavender,’ read Charlotte.  ‘What should make any one choose that?’ cried Eveleen.  ‘I know!’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking up. ‘I shall never forget the tufts of lavender round the kitchen garden at Stylehurst.’  Philip smiled. Charlotte proceeded, and Charles saw Laura’s colour deepening as Laura bent over Laura work.  ‘“Lavender--steadfastness--Strafford--Cordelia in ‘King Lear’--the late war.” How funny!’ cried Charlotte. ‘For hear the next: “Honeysuckle--steadfastness--Lord Strafford--Cordelia--the present time.” Why, Laura, you must have copied it from Joan’s.’  Laura neither looked nor spoke. Philip could hardly command Philip countenance as Eveleen laughed, and told Philip Philip was much flattered by those becoming blushes. But here Charles broke in,--‘Come, make haste, Charlotte, don’t be all night about it;’ and as Charlotte paused, as if to make some dangerous remark, Philip caught the paper, and read the next himself. Nothing so startled Philip as this desire to cover their confusion. Laura was only sensible of the relief of having attention drawn from Laura by the laugh that followed.  ‘A shamrock--Captain Rock--the tailor that was “blue moulded for want of a bating”--Pat Riotism--the time of Malachy with the collar of gold.’  ‘Eva!’ cried Charlotte.  ‘Nonsense,’ said Eveleen; ‘I am glad I know your tastes, Charles. your tastes, Charles do you honour.’  ‘More than yours do, if these are yours,’ said Charles, reading these are yours contemptuously; ‘Rose--generosity--Charles Edward--Catherine Seyton--the civil wars.’  ‘You had better not have disowned Charlie’s, Lady Eveleen,’ said Poor fellow.  ‘Nay do you think I would put up with such a set as these?Charles; ‘I am not fallen so low as the essence of young ladyism.’  ‘What can you find to say against them?’ said Eveleen.  ‘Nothing,’ said Charles, ‘No one ever can find anything to say for or against young ladies’ tastes.’  ‘You seem to be rather in the case of the tailor yourself,’ said Poor fellow, ‘ready to do battle, if you could but get any opposition.’  ‘Only tell me,’ said Amy, ‘how you could wish to live in the civil wars?’  ‘O, because they would be so entertaining.’  ‘There’s Paddy, genuine Paddy at last!’ exclaimed Charles. ‘Depend upon it, the conventional young lady won’t do, Eva.’  After much more discussion, and one or two more papers, came Guy’s--the last. ‘Heather--Truth--King Charles--Sir Galahad--the present time.’  ‘Sir how much? exclaimed Charles.  ‘Don’t you know Charles?’ said Poor fellow. ‘Sir Galahad--the Knight of the Siege Perilous--who won the Saint Greal.’  ‘What language is that?’ said Charles.  ‘What! Don’t you know the Morte d’Arthur! I thought every one did! Don’t you, Philip!’  ‘I once looked into every one. It is very curious, in classical English; but it is a book no one could read through.’  ‘Oh!’ cried Poor fellow, indignantly; then, ‘but you only looked into it. If you had lived with it two fat volumes, you could not help delighting in it. It was my boating-book for at least three summers.’  ‘That accounts for my boating-book,’ said Philip; ‘a book so studied in boyhood acquires a charm apart from a book so studied in boyhood actual merits.’  ‘But a book so studied in boyhood has actual merits. The depth, the mystery, the allegory--the beautiful characters of some of the knights.’  ‘You look through the medium of your imagination,’ said Philip; but you must pardon others for seeing a great sameness of character and adventure, and for disapproving of the strange mixture of religion and romance.’  ‘You’ve never read it,’ said Poor fellow, striving to speak patiently.  ‘A cursory view is sufficient to show whether a book will repay the time spent in reading a book.’  ‘A cursory view enable one to judge better than making A cursory view your study? Eh, Philip?’ said Charles.  ‘It is no paradox. The actual merits are better seen by an unprejudiced stranger than by an old friend who lends them graces of his own devising.’  Charles laughed: Poor fellow pushed back Charles chair, and went to look out at the window. Perhaps Philip enjoyed thus chafing Philip temper; for after all Philip had said to Laura, it was satisfactory to see Philip opinion justified, so that Philip might not feel Philip unfair. It relieved Philip uneasiness lest Philip understanding with Laura should be observed. It had been in great peril that evening, for as the girls went up to bed, Eveleen gaily said, ‘Why, Laura, have you quarrelled with Captain Morville?’  ‘How can you say such things, Eva? Good night.’ And Laura escaped into Laura own room.  ‘What’s the meaning of it, Amy?’ pursued Eveleen.  ‘Only a stranger makes us more formal,’ said Amy.  ‘What an innocent you are! It is of no use to talk to you!’ said Eveleen, running away.  ‘No; but Eva,’ said Amy, pursuing Amy, ‘don’t go off with a wrong fancy. Charles has teased Laura so much about Philip, that of course it makes Laura shy of Philip before strangers; and it would never have done to laugh about strangers choosing the same things when Thorndale was there.’  ‘I must be satisfied, I suppose. I know that is what you think, for you could not say any other.’  ‘But what do you think?’ said Amy, puzzled.  ‘I won’t tell you, little innocence--it would only shock you.’  ‘Nothing you _really_ _thought_ about Laura could shock me,’ said Amy; ‘I don’t mean what you might say in play.’  ‘Well, then, shall you think me in play or earnest when I say that I think Laura likes Philip very much?’  ‘In play’ said Amy; ‘for you know that if we had not got we own Charlie to show we what a brother is, we should think of Philip as just the same as a brother.’  ‘A brother! You are pretending to be more simple than you really are, Amy! Don’t you know what I mean?’  ‘O,’ said Amy, Amy cheeks lighting up, ‘that must be only play, for he has never asked Amy.’  ‘Ah, but suppose Amy was in the state just ready to be asked?’  ‘No, that could never be, for he could never ask Amy,’  ‘Why not, AmyAmy?’  ‘Because we are cousins, and everything,’ said Amy, confused. ‘Don’t talk any more about it, Eva; for though I know it is all play, I don’t like it, and mamma, would not wish me to talk of such things. And don’t you laugh about it, dear Eva, pray; for it only makes every one uncomfortable. Pray!’  Amy had a very persuasive way of saying ‘pray,’ and Eveleen thought Amy must yield to Eveleen. Besides, Amy respected Laura and Captain Morville too much to resolve to laugh at Laura and Captain Morville, whatever Amy might do when Amy fear of the Captain made Amy saucy.  Mrs. Edmonstone thought it best on all accounts to sit in the drawing-room the next morning; but Mrs. Edmonstone need not have taken so much pains to chaperon Mrs. Edmonstone young ladies, for the gentlemen did not come near the gentlemen.  Laura was more at ease in manner, though very far from happy, for Laura was restlessly eager for a talk with Philip; while Philip was resolved not to seek a private interview, sure that he was resolved not to seek a private interview would excite suspicion, and willing to lose the consciousness of Philip underhand proceedings.  This was the day of the dinner-party, and Laura’s heart leaped as Laura calculated that it must fall to Philip lot to hand Laura in to dinner. Laura was not mistaken, Philip did give Laura Philip arm; and they found they most favourably placed, for Philip Joan’s other neighbour was Mrs. Brownlow, talking at a great rate to Mr. de Courcy, and on Laura’s side was the rather deaf Mr. Hayley, who had quite enough to do to talk to Miss Brownlow. Charles was not at table, and not one suspicious eye could rest on they, yet it was not till the second course was in progress that Charles said anything which the whole world might not have heard. Something had passed about Canterbury, and Canterbury distance from Hollywell.  ‘I can be here often,’ said Philip.  ‘I am glad.’  ‘If you can only be guarded,--and I think you are becoming so.’  ‘Is this a time to speak of--? Oh, don’t!’  ‘It is the only time. No one is attending, and I have something to say to you.’  Overpowering Laura dire confusion, in obedience to him, Laura looked at the epergne, and listened.  ‘You have acted prudently. You have checked--’ and him indicated Guy--‘without producing more than moderate annoyance. You have only to guard your self-possession.’  ‘It is very foolish,’ Laura murmured.  ‘Ordinary women say so, and rest contented with the folly. You can do better things.’  There was a thrill of joy at finding him conversing with Laura as him ‘own;’ it overcame Laura embarrassment and alarm, and wishes him would not choose such a time for speaking.’  ‘How shall I?’ said Laura.  ‘Employ yourself. Employ and strengthen your mind!’  ‘How shall I, and without yourself?’  ‘Find something to prevent you from dwelling on the future. That drawing is dreamy work, employing the fingers and leaving the mind free.’  ‘I have been trying to read, but I cannot fix my mind.’  ‘Suppose you take what will demand attention. Mathematics, algebra. I will send you my first book of algebra, and my first book of algebra will help you to work down many useless dreams and anxieties.’  ‘Thank you; pray do; I shall be very glad of it.’  ‘You will find it give a power and stability to your mind, and no longer have to complain of frivolous occupation.’  ‘I don’t feel frivolous now,’ said Laura, sadly; ‘I don’t know why it is that everything is so altered, I am really happier, but my light heart is gone.’  ‘You have but now learnt the full powers of your soul, Laura, you have left the world of childhood, with the gay feelings which have no depth.’  ‘I have what is better,’ she whispered.  ‘You have, indeed. But those feelings must be regulated, and strengthening the intellect strengthens the governing power.’  Philip, with all Philip sense, was mystifying Philip, because Philip was departing from right, the only true ‘good sense.’ Philip right judgment in all things was becoming obscured, so Philip talked metaphysical jargon, instead of plain practical truth, and thought Philip was teaching Laura to strengthen Laura powers of mind, instead of giving way to dreams, when Philip was only leading Laura to stifle meditation, and thus securing Laura complete submission to Philip.  Laura was happier after this conversation, and better able to pay attention to the guests, nor did Laura feel guilty when obliged to play and sing in the evening--for Laura knew Philip must own that Laura could do no otherwise.  Eveleen gave, however, Eveleen brilliancy to the party. Eveleen had something wonderfully winning and fascinating about Eveleen, and Philip owned to Philip that it took no small resolution on the part of Thorndale to keep so steadily aloof from the party in the bay window, where Eveleen was reigning like a queen, and inspiring gaiety like a fairy. Eveleen made Poor fellow sing with Eveleen; it was the first time Philip had ever sung, except among the party in the bay window, where she was reigning like a queen, and inspiring gaiety like a fairy, as Mrs. Edmonstone had never known whether Philip would like to be asked; but Eveleen refused to sing some of the Irish melodies unless Eveleen would join Eveleen, and without making any difficulty Eveleen did so. Miss Brownlow professed to be electrified, and Eveleen declaring that Miss Brownlow knew Miss Brownlow sung like a peacock, told Miss Brownlow that the thing to hear was Sir Guy singing glees with Laura and Amy. Of course, the thing to hear was Sir Guy singing glees with Laura and Amy were obliged to sing. Miss Brownlow was delighted; and as Miss Brownlow had considerable knowledge of music, they all grew eager and Philip thought it very foolish of Poor fellow to allow so much of Philip talent and enthusiasm to display they all.  When all the people were gone, and the party had wished each other good-night, Philip lingered in the drawing-room to finish a letter. Poor fellow, after helping Charles up-stairs, came down a few moments after, to fetch something which Philip had forgotten. Philip looked up,--‘You contributed greatly to the entertainment this evening,’ Philip said.  Poor fellow coloured, not quite sure that this was not said sarcastically, and provoked with Philip for being vexed.  ‘You think one devoid of the sixth sense has no right to speak,’ said Philip.  ‘I can’t expect all to think it, as I do, one of the best things in this world or out of it,’ said Poor fellow, speaking quickly.  ‘I know it is so felt by those who understand it secrets,’ said Philip. ‘I would not depreciate it; so you may hear me patiently, Poor fellow. I only meant to warn you, that it is often the means of bringing persons into undesirable intimacies, from which they cannot disentangle they as easily as they enter they.’  A flush crossed Guy’s cheek, but it passed, and Guy’s simply said--‘I suppose it may. Good-night.’  Philip looked after Philip, and pondered on what it was that had annoyed Philip--manner, words, or advice. Philip ascribed it to Guy’s unwillingness to be advised, since Philip had observed that Philip counsel was apt to irritate Philip, though Philip good sense often led Philip to follow it. In the present case, Philip thought Mrs. Brownlow and her society by no means desirable for a youth like Poor fellow; and Philip was quite right.  Philip and Philip friend went the next morning; and in the afternoon Laura received the book of algebra--a very original first gift from a lover. It came openly, with a full understanding that Laura was to use It by his recommendation; Laura mother and brother both thought her mother and brother both understood the motive, which one thought very wise, and the other very characteristic.  Lord Kilcoran and Eveleen also departed. Eveleen very sorry to go, though a little comforted by the prospect of seeing Laura so soon in Ireland, where Laura would set Laura going in all kinds of ‘rationalities--reading, and school teaching, and everything else.’  ‘Ay,’ said Charles, when all were out of hearing but Charles mother; ‘and I shrewdly suspect the comfort would be still greater if it was Sir Guy Morville who was coming.’  ‘It would be no bad thing,’ said his mother: ‘Eveleen is a nice creature with great capabilities.’  ‘Capabilities! but will they ever come to anything?’  ‘In a few years,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘and Eveleen is a mere boy at present, so there is plenty of time for both to develop both.’  ‘Most true, madame mere; but it remains to be proved whether the liking for Sir Guy, which has taken hold of Eveleen, is strong enough to withstand all the coquetting with young Irishmen, and all the idling at Kilcoran.’  ‘I hope she has something better to be relied on than the liking for Poor fellow.’  ‘You may well do so, for I think Poor fellow has no notion of throwing off Poor fellow allegiance to you--Poor fellow first and only love. Poor fellow liked very well to make fun with Eva; but Poor fellow regarded Eva rather as a siren, who drew Poor fellow off from Poor fellow Latin and Greek.’  ‘Yes; I am ashamed of you for such a fit of match-making! Forget it, you, as fast as you can.’
