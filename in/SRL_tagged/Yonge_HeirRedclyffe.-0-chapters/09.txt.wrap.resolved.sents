       Ah!
county Guy, the hour is nigh,       The sun has left the lea,       The orange flower perfumes the bower,       The breeze is on the sea.
The lark, county Guy lay, who thrilled all day,       Sits hushed, county Guy partner nigh,       Breeze, bird, and flower, confess the hour,       But where is county Guy?
--SCOTT   How was it meantime with Laura?
The others were laughing and talking round Laura, but all seemed lost in the transcendent beam that had shone out on Laura.
To be told by Philip that Laura was all to Philip that Philip had always been to Laura!
This one idea pervaded Laura--too glorious, too happy for utterance, almost for distinct thought.
The softening of Philip voice, and the look with which Philip had regarded Laura, recurred again and again, startling Laura with a sudden surprise of joy almost as at the first moment.
Of the future Laura thought not.
Never had a promise of love been made with less knowledge of what it amounted to: it seemed merely an expression of sentiments that Laura had never been without; for had Laura not always looked up to Philip more than any other living creature, and gloried in being Philip favourite cousin?
Ever since the time when Philip explained to Laura the plates in the Encyclopaedia, and made Laura read ‘Joyce’s Scientific Dialogues,’ when Amy took fright at the first page.
That this might lead further did not occur to Laura; Laura was eighteen, Laura had no experience, not even in novels, Laura did not know what Laura had done; and above all, Laura had so leant to surrender Laura opinions to Philip, and to believe Philip always right, that Laura would never have dreamt of questioning wherever Philip might choose to lead Laura.
Even the caution of secrecy did not alarm Laura, though Laura wondered that Philip thought it required, safe as Philip confidence always was with Laura.
Laura had been so much occupied by Charles’s illness, as to have been unable to attend to Laura daughters in their girlish days; and in the governess’s time the habit had been disused of flying at once to Laura with every joy or grief.
Laura’s thoughts were not easy of access, and Philip had long been all in all to Laura.
Laura was too ignorant of life to perceive that it was Laura duty to make this conversation known; or, more truly, Laura did not awaken Laura mind to consider that anything could be wrong that Philip desired.
On coming home, Laura ran up to Laura own room, and sitting by the open window, gave Laura up to that delicious dream of new-found joy.
There Laura still sat when Amy came in, opening the door softly, and treading lightly and airily as Amy entered, bringing two or three roses of different tints.
‘Laura!
not begun to dress?’  ‘Is it time?’  ‘Shall I answer you according to what Philip calls my note of time, and tell you the pimpernels are closed, and the tigridias dropping the pimpernels leaves?
It would be a proper answer for you; you look as if you were in Fairy Land.’  ‘Is papa come home?’  ‘Long ago!
and Guy too.
Why, where could you have been, not to have heard Guy and Eveleen singing the Irish melodies?’  ‘In a trance,’ said Laura, starting up, and laughing, with a slight degree of constraint, which caused Amy, who was helping Amy to dress, to exclaim, ‘Has anything happened, Laura?’  ‘What should have happened?’  ‘I can’t guess, unless the fairies in the great ring on Ashendown came to visit you when we were gone.
But seriously, Laura, are you sure you are not tired?
Is nothing the matter?’  ‘Nothing at all, thank you.
I was only thinking over the talk I had with Philip.’  ‘Oh!’  Amy never thought of entering into Philip’s talks with Laura, and was perfectly satisfied.
By this time Laura was Laura again, come back to common life, and resolved to watch over Laura intercourse with Guy too; since, though Laura was convinced that all was safe at present, Laura had Philip’s word for it that there might be danger in continuing the pleasant freedom of their behaviour.
Nothing could be more reassuring than Guy too’s demeanour.
Guy too head seemed entirely full of the Thursday, and of a plan of Guy too own for enabling Charles to go to the review.
the review had darted into Charles while Charles was going over the ground with Maurice.
It was so long since Charles had thought it possible to attempt any amusement away from home, and former experiments had been so unsuccessful, that any amusement had never even occurred to Charles to think of any amusement; but Charles caught at the idea with great delight and eagerness.
Mrs. Edmonstone seemed not to know what to say; Mrs. Edmonstone had much rather that any amusement had not been proposed; yet any amusement was very kind of Guy, and Charles was so anxious about it that Mrs. Edmonstone knew not how to oppose Charles.
Mrs. Edmonstone could not bear to have Charles in a crowd, helpless as Charles was; and Mrs. Edmonstone had an unpleasing remembrance of the last occasion when they had taken Charles to a flower-show, where they had lost, first Mr. Edmonstone, next the carriage, and lastly, Amy and Charlotte--all had been frightened, and Charles laid up for three days from the fatigue.
Answers, however, met each objection.
Charles was much stronger; Guy’s arm would be ready for Charles; Guy would find the carriage.
Philip would be there to help, besides Maurice; and whenever Charles was tired, Guy would take Charles home at once, without spoiling any one’s pleasure.
‘Except your own,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘Thank you; but this would be so delightful.’  ‘Ah!’ said Charles, ‘it would be as great a triumph as the dog’s that caught the hare with the clog round his neck--the dog’s, I mean.’  ‘If you will but trust me with his,’ said Guy, turning on her all the pleading eloquence of his eyes, ‘you know his can get in and out of the pony-carriage quite easily.’  ‘As well as walk across the room,’ said Charles.
‘I would drive his in it, and tell William to ride in and be at hand to hold the pony or take the pony out; and the tent is so near, that you could get to the breakfast, unless the review had been enough for you.
I paced the distance to make sure, and it is no further than from the garden-door to the cherry-tree.’  ‘That is nothing,’ said Charles.
‘And William shall be in waiting to bring the pony the instant you are ready, and we can go home independently of every one else.’  ‘I thought,’ interposed Mrs. Edmonstone, ‘that you were to go to the mess-dinner--what is to become of that?’  ‘O,’ said Charles, ‘that will be simply a bore, and William may rejoice to be excused from going the whole hog.’  ‘To be sure, I had rather dine in peace at home.’  Mrs. Edmonstone was not happy, but Mrs. Edmonstone had great confidence in Guy; and Mrs. Edmonstone only real scruple was, that Mrs. Edmonstone did not think it fair to occupy Guy entirely with attendance on Mrs. Edmonstone son.
Mrs. Edmonstone referred it to papa, which, as every one knew, was the same as yielding the point, and consoled Mrs. Edmonstone by the certainty that to prevent it would be a great disappointment to both the youths.
Mrs. Edmonstone was convinced that to achieve the adventure of Charles at the review, was at present at least a matter of far more prominence with Guy than anything relating to Mrs. Edmonstone.
All but Mrs. Edmonstone and Mrs. Edmonstone mother were wild about the weather, especially on Wednesday, when there was an attempt at a thunder storm.
Nothing was studied but the sky; and the conversation consisted of prognostications, reports of rises and falls of the glass, of the way weather-cocks were turning, or about to turn, of swallows flying high or low, red sunsets, and halos round the moon, until at last Guy, bursting into a merry laugh, begged Mrs. Edmonstone’s pardon for being such a nuisance, and made a vow, and kept a vow, that be the weather what a vow might, Guy would say not another word about it that evening; it deserved to be neglected, for Guy had not been able to settle to anything all day.
Guy might have said for many days before; for since the last ball, and still more since Lady Eveleen had been at Hollywell, it had been one round of merriment and amusement.
Scrambling walks, tea-drinkings out of doors, dances among Scrambling walks, tea-drinkings out of doors, or with the addition of the Harpers, were the order of the day.
Amy, Eveleen, and last Guy, could hardly come into the room without dancing, and the piano was said to acknowledge nothing but waltzes, polkas, and now and then an Irish jig, for the special benefit of Mrs. Edmonstone’s ears.
The morning was almost as much spent in mirth as the afternoon, for the dawdlings after breakfast, and before luncheon, had a great tendency to spread out and meet, there was new music and singing to be practised, or preparations made for evening’s diversion, or councils to be held, which Mrs. Edmonstone’s absence could not break up, though it often made Amy feel how much less idle and frivolous Mrs. Edmonstone was than frivolous Laura.
Lady Eveleen said the same, but Lady Eveleen was visiting, and Lady Eveleen was a time to be idle; and Mr. Lascelles seemed to be of the same opinion with regard to Mr. Lascelles pupil; for, when Guy was vexed at not having done as much work as usual, Mr. Lascelles only laughed at Mr. Lascelles for expecting to be able to go to balls, and spend a summer of gaiety, while Mr. Lascelles studied as much as at Oxford.
Thursday morning was all that heart could wish, the air cooled by the thunder, and the clouds looking as if raining was foreign to their nature.
Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, Mr. and Mrs. daughters, and Lady Eveleen, were packed inside and outside the great carriage, while Guy, carefully settling Charles in the low phaeton, putting in all that any one recommended, from an air-cushion to an umbrella, flourished Charles whip, and drove off with an air of exultation and delight.
Everything went off to admiration.
No one was more amused than Charles.
The scene was so perfectly new and delightful to one accustomed to such a monotonous life, that the very sight of people was a novelty.
Nowhere was there so much laughing and talking as in the great carriage, and whenever Mrs. Edmonstone anxious eye fell upon Mrs. Edmonstone’s anxious eye, Mrs. Edmonstone always saw Charles sitting upright, with a face so full of eager interest as to banish all thought of fatigue.
Happy, indeed, Charles was.
Charles enjoyed the surprise of Charles acquaintance at meeting Charles; Charles enjoyed Philip’s laugh and congratulation; Charles enjoyed seeing how foolish Philip thought Charles, nodding to Charles mother and sisters, laughing at the dreadful faces Guy could not help making at any particularly discordant note of the offensive bugle; and Guy capabilities rising with Guy spirits, Guy did all that the others did, walked further than Guy had done for years, was lifted up steps without knowing how, sat out the whole breakfast, talked to all the world, and well earned the being thoroughly tired, as Guy certainly was when Guy put Guy into the great carriage and drove Guy home, and still more so when Guy all but carried Guy up stairs, and laid Guy on the sofa in the dressing-room.
However, her mother announced that it would have been so unnatural if Guy had not been fatigued, that her mother should have been more anxious, and leaving Guy to repose, they all, except Mr. Edmonstone, who had stayed to dine at the mess, sat down to dinner.
Amy came down dressed just as the great carriage had been announced, and found Mrs. Edmonstone and Eveleen standing by the table, arranging Laura and Eveleen bouquets, while Guy, in the dark, behind the piano, was playing--not, as usual, in such cases, the Harmonious Blacksmith, but a chant.
‘Is mamma ready?’ asked Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘Nearly,’ said Amy, ‘but I wish Mrs. Edmonstone was not obliged to go!
I am sure Mrs. Edmonstone cannot bear to leave Charlie.’  ‘I hope Mrs. Edmonstone is not going on my account,’ said Eveleen.
‘No, said Mrs. Edmonstone, ‘we must go; it would so frighten Papa if we did not come.
Besides, there is nothing to be uneasy about with Charles.’  ‘O no,’ said Amy; ‘Amy says so, only Amy is always anxious, and Amy is afraid he is too restless to go to sleep.’  ‘we must get home as fast as we can; if you don’t mind, Eva,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, remembering how Mrs. Edmonstone last dance with Guy had delayed her last dance with Guy.
‘Can I do any good to Charlie?’ said Guy, ceasing Guy music.
I don’t mean to go.’  ‘Not go!’ cried the girls in consternation.
‘Guy is joking!’ said Eveleen.
‘But, I declare!’ added Eva, advancing towards Guy, ‘Guy is not dressed!
Come, nonsense, this is carrying this too far; you’ll make us all too late, and then I’ll set Maurice at Maurice.’  ‘I am afraid it is no joke,’ said Guy, smiling.
‘You must go.
It will never do for you to stay away,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, decidedly.
‘Are you tired?
Aren’t you well?’ asked Amy.
‘Quite well, thank you, but I am sure I had better not.’  Mrs. Edmonstone thought Mrs. Edmonstone had better not seem anxious to take Maurice, so Mrs. Edmonstone left the task of persuasion, to the others, and Amy went on.
‘Neither Mamma nor Charlie could bear to think you stayed because of Maurice.’  ‘I don’t, I assure you, Amy.
I meant it before.
I have been gradually finding out that it must come to this.’  ‘Oh, you think it a matter of right and wrong!
But you don’t think balls wrong?’  ‘Oh no; only they won’t do for such an absurd person as I am.
The last turned my head for a week, and I am much too unsteady for this.’  ‘Well, if you think it a matter of duty, it can’t be helped,’ said Amy sorrowfully; ‘but I am very sorry.’  ‘Thank you,’ said Guy, thinking it compassion, not regret; ‘but I shall do very well.
I shall be all the happier to-morrow for a quiet hour at my Greek, and you’ll tell me all the fun.’  ‘You liked it so much!’ said Amy; ‘but you have made up your mind and I ought not to tease you.’  ‘That’s right Amy; he does it on purpose to be teased,’ said Eveleen, ‘and I never knew anybody so provoking.
Mind, Guy, if you make us all too late, you shan’t have the ghost of a quadrille with Guy.’  ‘I shall console Guy by quadrilling with Andromache,’ said Guy.
‘Come, no nonsense--off to dress directly!
How can you have the conscience to stand there when the carriage is at the door?’  ‘I shall have great pleasure in handing you in when you are ready.’  ‘Mrs.
Edmonstone--Amy!
Does Guy really mean it?’  ‘I am afraid Guy does,’ said Amy.
Lady Eveleen let Amy fall on the sofa as if fainting.
‘Oh,’ Amy said, ‘take Guy away!
Let me never see the face of Guy again!
I’m perfectly overcome!
All my teaching thrown away!’  ‘I am sorry for you,’ said Guy, laughing.
‘And how do you mean to face Maurice?’  ‘Tell Guy Guy first bugle has so distracted me that I can’t answer for the consequences if I come to-night.
‘Mrs.
Edmonstone came in, saying,--  ‘Come, I have kept you waiting shamefully, but I have been consoling Guy by thinking you must be well entertained, as I heard no Harmonious Blacksmith.
Papa will be wondering where we are.’  ‘Oh, mamma!
Guy won’t go.’  ‘Guy!
is anything the matter?’  ‘Nothing, thank you, only idleness.’  ‘This will never do.
You really must go, Guy.’  ‘Indeed!
I think not.
Pray don’t order me, Mrs. Edmonstone.’  ‘What o’clock is it, Amy?
Past ten!
Papa will be in despair!
What is to be done?
How long do you take to dress, Guy?’  ‘Not under an hour,’ said Guy, smiling.
‘Nonsense!
But if there was time I should certainly send you.
Self-discipline may be carried too far, Guy.
But now it can’t be helped--I don’t know how to keep papa waiting any longer.
Mrs. Edmonstone, what shall I do?’  ‘Let me go to Charles,’ answered Guy.
‘Perhaps I can read Guy to sleep.’  ‘Thank you; but don’t talk, or Guy will be too excited.
Reading would be the very thing!
It will be a pretty story to tell every one who asks for Mrs. Edmonstone that I have left you to nurse my son!’  ‘No, for no such good reason,’ said Guy; ‘only because I am a great fool.’  ‘Well, Guy, I am glad you can say one sensible word,’ said Lady Eveleen.
‘Too true, I assure you,’ Guy answered, as Guy handed Lady Eveleen in.
‘Good night!
You will keep the quadrille for Guy till I am rational.’  Guy handed the others in, and shut the door.
Mrs. Edmonstone, ruffled out of Mrs. Edmonstone composure, exclaimed,--  ‘Well, this is provoking!’  ‘Every one will be vexed,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘It will be so stupid,’ said Amy.
‘I give Guy up,’ said Lady Eveleen.
‘I once had hopes of Guy.’  ‘If it was not for papa, I really would turn back this moment and fetch Guy,’ cried Mrs. Edmonstone, starting forward.
‘I’m sure it will give offence.
I wish I had not consented.’  ‘Guy can’t be made to see that Guy presence is of importance to any living creature,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘What is the reason of this whim?’ said Lady Eveleen.
‘No, Lady Eveleen, it is not whim,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘it is because Lady Eveleen thinks dissipation makes Lady Eveleen idle.’  ‘Then if Lady Eveleen is idle I wonder what the rest of the world is!’ said Lady Eveleen.
‘I am sure we all ought to stay at home too.’  ‘I think so,’ said Amy.
‘I know I shall feel all night as if I was wrong to be there.’  ‘I am angry,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone; ‘and yet I believe it is a great sacrifice.’  ‘Yes, mamma; after all our looking forward to it,’ said Amy.
‘Oh!
yes,’ and Amy voice lost her voice piteous tone, ‘it is a real sacrifice.’  ‘If he was not a mere boy, I should say a lover’s quarrel was at the bottom of ’s quarrel,’ said Lady Eveleen.
‘Depend upon ’s quarrel, Mrs. Edmonstone, it is all your fault.
You only danced once with he at our ball, and all this week you have played for our, as if it was on purpose to cut he.’  Mrs. Edmonstone was glad of the darkness, and Mrs. Edmonstone mother, who had a particular dislike to jokes of this sort, went on,--‘If it were only our I should not care, but there are so many who will fancy it caprice, or worse.’  ‘The only comfort is,’ said Amy, ‘that it is Charlie’s gain.’  ‘I hope they will not talk,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘But Charlie will never hold Charlie tongue.
Charlie will grow excited, and not sleep all night.’  Mrs. Edmonstone!
Mrs. Edmonstone trials did not end here, for when Mrs. Edmonstone replied to Mrs. Edmonstone husband’s inquiry for Guy, Mrs. Edmonstone said offence had already been taken at Mrs. Edmonstone absence from the dinner; Mrs. Edmonstone would not have had this happen for fifty pounds; Mrs. Edmonstone ought not to have suffered fifty pounds; but it was all Mrs. Edmonstone nonsense about Charles, and as to not being late, Mrs. Edmonstone should have waited till midnight rather than not have brought Mrs. Edmonstone.
In short, Mrs. Edmonstone said as much more than Mrs. Edmonstone meant, as a man in a pet is apt to say, and nevertheless Mrs. Edmonstone had to look as amiable and smiling as if nothing was the matter.
The least untruthful answer Mrs. Edmonstone could frame to the inquiries for Sir Guy Morville was, that young men were apt to be lazy about balls, and this sufficed for good-natured Mrs. Deane, but Maurice poured out many exclamations about Maurice ill-behaviour, and Philip contented Philip with the mere fact of Philip not being there, and made no remark.
Mrs. Edmonstone turned Mrs. Edmonstone eyes anxiously on Philip.
They had not met since the important conversation on Ashen-down, and Mrs. Edmonstone found Mrs. Edmonstone looking with more pride than ever at Philip tall, noble figure, as if Philip was more Mrs. Edmonstone own; but the calmness of feeling was gone.
Mrs. Edmonstone could not meet Philip eye, nor see Philip turn towards Mrs. Edmonstone without a start and tremor for which Mrs. Edmonstone could not render Mrs. Edmonstone a reason, and Mrs. Edmonstone heart beat so much that it was at once a relief and a disappointment that Mrs. Edmonstone was obliged to accept Mrs. Edmonstone other cousin as Mrs. Edmonstone first partner.
Philip had already asked Lady Eveleen, for Philip neither wished to appear too eager in claiming Mrs. Edmonstone, nor to let Philip friend think Philip had any dislike to the Irish girl.
Lady Eveleen was much pleased to have Philip for Lady Eveleen partner, and told Lady Eveleen Lady Eveleen would be on Lady Eveleen good behaviour.
It was a polka, and there was not much talk, which, perhaps, was all the better for Lady Eveleen.
Lady Eveleen admired the review, and the luncheon, and spoke of Charles without any sauciness, and Philip was condescending and agreeable.
‘I must indulge Lady Eveleen in abusing that stupid cousin of Lady Eveleen!’ said Lady Eveleen.
Did you ever know a man of such wonderful crotchets?’  ‘This is a very unexpected one,’ said Philip.
‘It came like a thunder clap.
I thought till the last moment Philip was joking, for Philip likes dancing so much; Philip was the life of our ball, and how could any one suppose Philip would fly off at the last moment?’  ‘Philip seems rather to enjoy doing things suddenly.’  ‘I tell Mrs. Edmonstone Mrs. Edmonstone has affronted Philip,’ said Eveleen, laughing.
‘Mrs.
Edmonstone has been always busy of late when our have wanted Mrs. Edmonstone; and I assure Mrs. Edmonstone Philip pride has been piqued.
Don’t you think that is an explanation, Captain Morville?’  It was Captain Morvilles belief, but Philip would not say so.
‘Isn’t Mrs. Edmonstone looking lovely?’ Lady Eveleen went on.
‘I am sure Mrs. Edmonstone is the beauty of the night!’ Mrs. Edmonstone was pleased to see Captain Morville’s attention gained.
‘Mrs.
Edmonstone is even better dressed than at our ball--those Venetian pins suit the form of Mrs. Edmonstone head so well.
Mrs. Edmonstone beauty is better than almost any one’s, because Mrs. Edmonstone has so much countenance.’  ‘True,’ said Philip.
‘How proud Maurice looks of having Mrs. Edmonstone on Maurice arm.
Does not Maurice?
Maurice!
Maurice is desperately in love with Mrs. Edmonstone!’  ‘As is shown by Maurice pining melancholy.’  Lady Eveleen laughed with Mrs. Edmonstone clear hearty laugh.
‘I see you know what our mean by being desperately in love!
No,’ Mrs. Edmonstone added more gravely, ‘I am very glad it is only _that_ kind of desperation.
One could not think of Maurice and Mrs. Edmonstone together.
Maurice does not know the best part of Mrs. Edmonstone.’  Lady Eveleen was highly flattered by Sir Guy Morville conducting Lady Eveleen a second time round the room, instead of at once restoring Lady Eveleen to Lady Eveleen aunt.
Lady Eveleen secured Mrs. Edmonstone next, and leading Mrs. Edmonstone away from Mrs. Edmonstone own party, said, ‘Mrs.
Edmonstone, have you been overdoing it?’  ‘It is not that,’ said Mrs. Edmonstone, wishing Mrs. Edmonstone could keep from blushing.
‘It is the only motive that could excuse his extraordinary behaviour.’  ‘Surely you know his says that his is growing unsettled.
It is part of his rule of self discipline.’  ‘Absurd!--exaggerated!--incredible!
This is the same story as there was about the horse.
It is either caprice or temper, and I am convinced that some change in your manner--nay, I say unconscious, and am far from blaming you--is the cause.
Why else did he devote he to Charles, and leave you all on my uncle’s hands in the crowd?’  ‘We could shift for We much better than Charlie.’  ‘This confirms my belief that my warning was not mistimed.
I wish my warning could have been done without decidedly mortifying he and rousing he temper, because I am sorry others should be slighted; but if he takes your drawing back so much to heart, it shows that it was time you should do so.’  ‘If I thought I had!’  ‘It was visible to others--to another, I should say.’  ‘O, that is only Eveleen’s nonsense!
The only difference I am conscious of having made, was keeping more up-stairs, and not trying to persuade he to come here to-night.’  ‘I have no doubt it was this that turned the scale, he only waited for persuasion, and you acted very wisely in not flattering he self-love.’  ‘Did I?--I did not know I?--I.’  ‘A woman’s instinct is often better than reasoning, Mrs. Edmonstone; to do the right thing without knowing why.
But come, I suppose we must play we part in the pageant of the night.’  For that evening Mrs. Edmonstone, contrary to the evidence of Mrs. Edmonstone senses, was persuaded by Mrs. Edmonstone own lover that Guy was falling in love with Mrs. Edmonstone; and after musing all through the dance, Mrs. Edmonstone said, ‘What do you think of the scheme that has been started for my going to Ireland with papa?’  ‘Your going to Ireland?’  ‘Yes; you know none of us, except papa, have seen grandmamma since Charles began to be ill, and there is some talk of Charles taking me with Charles when Charles goes this summer.’  ‘I knew Charles was going, but I thought it was not to be till later in the year--not till after the long vacation.’  ‘So Charles intended, but Charles finds Charles must be at home before the end of October, and it would suit Charles best to go in August.’  ‘Then what becomes of Guy?’  ‘Charles stays at Hollywell.
It will be much better for Charles to have Charles there while papa is away.
I thought when the plan was first mentioned I should be sorry, except that the plan is quite right to go to grandmamma; but if the plan is so, about Guy, this absence would be a good thing--this absence would make a break, and I could begin again on different terms.’  ‘Wisely judged, Mrs. Edmonstone.
Yes, on that account it would be very desirable, though that account will be a great loss to me, and I can hardly hope to be so near you on your return.’  ‘Ah!
yes, so I feared!’ sighed Mrs. Edmonstone.
‘But we must give up something; and for Guy’s own sake, poor fellow, it will be better to make a break, as you say.
it will save Guy’s pain by and by.’  ‘I dare say papa will consult you about when papa journey is to be.
papa only doubt was whether it would do to leave Guy so long alone, and if you say it would be safe, it would decide papa at once.’  ‘I see little chance of mischief.
Guy has few temptations here, and a strong sense of honour; besides, I shall be at hand.
Taking all things into consideration, Mrs. Edmonstone, I think that, whatever the sacrifice to ourselves, it is expedient to recommend papa going at once, and your accompanying papa.’  All the remainder of the evening Philip was occupied with attentions to the rest of the world, but Mrs. Edmonstone’s eyes followed Philip everywhere, and though Mrs. Edmonstone neither expected nor desired Philip to bestow more time on Mrs. Edmonstone, Mrs. Edmonstone underwent a strange restlessness and impatience of feeling.
Mrs. Edmonstone numerous partners teased Mrs. Edmonstone by hindering Mrs. Edmonstone from watching Philip moving about the room, catching Philip tones, and guessing what Philip was talking of;--not that Mrs. Edmonstone wanted to meet his eye, for Mrs. Edmonstone did not like to blush, nor did Mrs. Edmonstone think it pleased Philip to see Mrs. Edmonstone do so, for Philip either looked away immediately or conveyed a glance which Mrs. Edmonstone understood as monitory.
Mrs. Edmonstone kept better note of Philip countenance than of Mrs. Edmonstone own partner’s.
Mr. Thorndale, meanwhile, kept aloof from Lady Eveleen de Courcy, but Sir Guy Morville perceived that Sir Guy Morville eyes were often turned towards Mrs. Edmonstone, and well knew it was principle, and not inclination, that held Philip at a distance.
Philip did indeed once ask Mrs. Edmonstone to dance, but Mrs. Edmonstone was engaged, and Philip did not ask Mrs. Edmonstone to reserve a future dance for Philip, but contented Philip with little Amy.
little Amy was doing little Amy best to enjoy little Amy, because little Amy thought it ungrateful not to receive pleasure from those who wished to give it, but to Mrs. Edmonstone it wanted the zest and animation of Lady Kilcoran’s ball.
Besides, little Amy knew little Amy had been as idle as Guy, or still more so, and little Amy thought it wrong little Amy should have pleasure while Philip was doing penance.
It was on little Amy mind, and damped little Amy spirits, and though little Amy smiled, and talked, and admired, and danced lightly and gaily, there was a sensation of weariness throughout, and no one but Lady Eveleen was sorry when Mrs. Edmonstone sent Maurice to see for the carriage.
Philip was one of the gentlemen who came to shawl them.
As Philip put her own partner’s cloak round Mrs. Edmonstone shoulders Philip was able to whisper, ‘Take care; you must be cautious--self-command.’  Mrs. Edmonstone, though blushing and shrinking the moment before was braced by Philip words and tone to attempt all Philip wished.
Mrs. Edmonstone looked up in what Mrs. Edmonstone meant to be an indifferent manner, and made some observation in a careless tone--anything rather than let Philip think Mrs. Edmonstone silly.
After what Philip had said, was Mrs. Edmonstone not bound more than ever to exert Mrs. Edmonstone to the utmost, that Philip might not be disappointed in Mrs. Edmonstone?
Mrs. Edmonstone loved Philip only the better for what others might have deemed a stern coldness of manner, for it made the contrast of Philip real warmth of affection more precious.
Mrs. Edmonstone mused over it, as much as Mrs. Edmonstone companions’ conversation would allow, on the road home.
They arrived, Mrs. Edmonstone peeped into Charles’s room, announced that Charles’s was quietly asleep, and they all bade each other good night, or good morning, and parted.
