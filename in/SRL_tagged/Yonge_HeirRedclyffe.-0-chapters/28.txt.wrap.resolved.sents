      I forgave thee all the blame,      I could not forgive the praise.
--TENNYSON   ‘If ever there was a meddlesome coxcomb on this earth!’ Such was the exclamation that greeted the ears of Guy as Guy supported Charles into the breakfast-room; and, at the same time, Mr. Edmonstone tossed a letter into Guy’s plate, saying,--  ‘There’s something for you to read.’  Guy began; Guy lips were tightly pressed together; Guy brows made one black line across Guy forehead, and Guy eye sparkled even through Guy bent-down eyelashes; but this lasted only a few moments; his forehead smoothed, again, and there was a kind of deliberate restraint and force upon himself, which had so much power, that no one spoke till Guy had finished, folded it up with a sort of extra care, and returned it, only saying,  ‘You should not show one such letters, Mr. Edmonstone.’  ‘Does not it beat everything?’ cried Mr. Edmonstone.
‘If that is not impertinence, I should like to know what is!
But Guy has played my Lord Paramount rather too long, as I can tell Guy!
I ask Guy consent, forsooth!
Probation, indeed!
You might marry his consent to-morrow, and welcome.
There, give it to mamma.
See if his consent does not say the same.
Mere spite and malice all along.’  Poor Laura!
would no one refute such cruel injustice?
Yes, Guy spoke, eagerly,--  ‘No no; that it never was.
Guy was quite right under Guy belief.’  ‘Don’t tell me!
Not a word in Guy favour will I hear!’ stormed on Mr. Edmonstone.
‘Mere envy and ill-will.’  ‘I always told Mr. Edmonstone so,’ said Charles.
‘Pure malignity!’  ‘Nonsense, Charlie!’ said Guy, sharply; ‘there is no such thing about Guy.’  ‘Come, Guy; I can’t stand this,’ said Mr. Edmonstone.
‘I won’t have Mr. Edmonstone defended; I never thought to be so deceived; but you all worshipped the boy as if every word that came out of Mr. Edmonstone mouth was Gospel truth, and you’ve set Mr. Edmonstone up till Mr. Edmonstone would not condescend to take an advice of Mr. Edmonstone own father, who little thought what an upstart sprig Mr. Edmonstone was rearing; but I tell Mr. Edmonstone Mr. Edmonstone has come to the wrong shop for domineering--eh, mamma?’  ‘Well!’ cried Mrs. Edmonstone, who had read till near the end with tolerable equanimity; this really is too bad!’  ‘Mamma and all!’ thought poor Laura, while poor Laura mother continued,--‘It is wilful prejudice, to say the least,--I never could have believed him capable of the least,--I!’  Charles next had the letter, and was commenting on the letter in a style of mingled sarcasm and fury; while poor Laura longed to see the letter justify the letter, as poor Laura was sure the letter would.
‘Read it, all of you--every bit,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, ‘that you may see this paragon of Mr. Edmonstone!’  ‘I had rather not,’ said Amy, shrinking as it came towards Amy.
‘I should like you to do so, if you don’t dislike it very much,’ said Guy.
Amy read in silence; and then came the turn of Laura, who marvelled at the general injustice as Amy read.
‘CORK, April 8th.
‘MY DEAR UNCLE,--I am much obliged to you for the communication of your intention with regard to Amabel; but, indeed, I must say I am a good deal surprised that you should have so hastily resolved on so important a step, and have been satisfied with so incomplete an explanation of circumstances which appeared to you, as well as to myself, to show that Guy was yet quite unsettled, and Guy conduct such as to create considerable apprehension that Guy was habitually extremely imprudent, to say the least of it, in the management of Guy own affairs.
How much more unfit, therefore, to have the happiness of another intrusted to Guy?
I believe--indeed, I understood you to have declared to myself that you were resolved never to allow the engagement to be renewed, unless Guy should, with the deference which is only due to you as Guy guardian, consent to clear up the mystery with which Guy has thought fit to invest all Guy pecuniary transactions, and this, it appears, Guy refuses, as Guy persists in denying all explanation of Guy demand for that large sum of money.
As to the cheque, which certainly was applied to discreditable uses, though I will not suffer myself to suppose that Guy was in collusion with Guy uncle, yet it is not at all improbable that Dixon, not being a very scrupulous person, may, on hearing of the difficulties in which Guy nephew has been placed, come forward to relieve Guy from Guy embarrassment, in the hope of further profit, by thus establishing a claim on his nephew gratitude.
In fact, this proof of secretly renewed intercourse with Dixon rather tends to increase the presumption that there is something wrong.
I am not writing this in the expectation that the connection should be entirely broken off, for that, indeed, would be out of the question as things stand at present, but for my little cousin’s sake, as well as his own, I entreat of you to pause.
They are both extremely young--so young, that if there was no other ground, many persons would think it advisable to wait a few years; and why not wait until the time fixed by his grandfather for his coming into possession of his property?
If the character of his attachment to Amabel is firm and true, the probation may be of infinite service to his, as keeping before his, during the most critical period of his life, a powerful motive for restraining the natural impetuosity of his disposition; while, on the other hand, if this should prove to have been a mere passing fancy for the first young lady into whose society his has been thrown on terms of easy familiar intercourse, you will then have the satisfaction of reflecting that your care and caution have preserved your daughter from a life of misery.
My opinion has never altered respecting his, that his is brave and generous, with good feelings and impulses, manners peculiarly attractive, and altogether a character calculated to inspire affection, but impetuous and unsteady, easily led into temptation, yet obstinate in reserve, and his temper of unchecked violence.
I wish his happiness of every kind; and, as you well know, would, do my utmost for his welfare; but my affection for your whole family, and my own conscientious conviction, make me feel it my duty to offer this remonstrance, which I hope will be regarded as by no means the result of any ill-will, but simply of a sincere desire for the good of all parties, such as can only be evinced by plain speaking.
‘Yours affectionately,                                 ‘P.
MORVILLE.’   All the time Laura was reading, Guy was defending Philip against the exaggerated abuse that Mr. Edmonstone and Charles were pouring out, till at last, Mrs. Edmonstone, getting out of patience, said,--  ‘Guy, if we did not know you so well, we should almost accuse you of affectation.’  ‘Then I shall go away,’ said Guy, laughing as Guy rose.
‘Can you come out with me?’ said Guy, in a lower tone, leaning over the back of Amy’s chair.
‘No; wait a bit,’ interposed Mr. Edmonstone; ‘don’t take Amy out, or you won’t be to be found, anywhere, and I want to speak to you before I write my letter, and go to the Union Meeting.
I want to tell Philip, on the spot, that the day is fixed, and we snap we fingers at Philip and Philip probation.
Wait till twenty-five!
I dare say!’  At ‘I want to speak to you,’ the ladies had made the first move towards departure, but the ladies were not out of hearing at the conclusion.
Guy looked after Amy, but Amy would not look round, and Charles lay twisting Bustle’s curls round Charles fingers, and smiling to Charles at the manner in which my letter was working by contraries.
The overthrow of Philip’s influence was a great triumph for Charles, apart from the way in which it affected Charles friend and Charles sister.
Mr. Edmonstone was disappointed that Guy would not set about fixing the day, in time for Guy to announce it in a letter to be written in the course of an hour.
Guy said Guy had not begun on the subject with Amy, and it would never do to hurry Amy.
Indeed, it was a new light to Guy that Mr. Edmonstone would like it to take place so soon.
‘Pray, when did you think it was to be?’ said Mr. Edmonstone.
‘Upon my word, I never in all my days saw a lover like you, Guy!’  ‘I was too happy to think about the future; besides, I did not know whether you had sufficient confidence in me.’  ‘Confidence, nonsense!
I tell you if I had a dozen daughters, I would trust a dozen to you.’  Guy smiled, and was infected by Philip’s burst of laughing, but Mr. Edmonstone went on unheeding--‘I have the most absolute confidence in you!
I am going to write to Philip this minute, to tell Philip Philip has played three-tailed Bashaw rather too long.
I shall tell Philip it is to be very soon, at any rate; and that if Philip wishes to see how I value Philip pragmatical advice, Philip may come and dance at the wedding.
I declare, your mamma and that colonel of Philip have perfectly spoilt Philip with your mamma and that colonel of his flattery!
I knew what would come of it; you all would make a prodigy of Philip, till Philip is so puffed up, that Philip entirely forgets who Philip is!’  ‘Not I’ said Charles; ‘that can’t be laid to my door.’  ‘But I’ll write Philip such a letter this instant as shall make Philip remember what Philip is, and show Philip who Philip has to deal with.
Eh, Charlie?’  ‘Don’t you think,’ said Guy, preparing to go, ‘that it might be better to wait a day or two, till we see we way clearer, and are a little cooler?’  ‘I tell you, Guy, there is no one that puts me out of patience now, but Guy.
You are as bad as Philip.
Cool?
I am coolness itself, all but what’s proper spirit for a man to show when a man family is affronted, and a man dictated to, by a meddling young jackanapes.
I’ll serve a man out properly!’  A message called a man away.
Guy stood looking perplexed and sorrowful.
‘Never mind,’ said Charles, ‘I’ll take care my letter is moderate.
Besides, my letter is Philip, and Philip knows that letter-writing is not Philip forte.’  ‘I am afraid things will be said in irritation, which you will both regret.
There are justice and reason in the letter.’  ‘There shall be more in the answer, as you will see.’  ‘No, I will not see.
It is Mr. Edmonstone’s concern, not mine.
I am the last person who should have anything to do with it.’  ‘Just what the individual in question would not have said.’  ‘Would you do one thing to oblige me, Charlie?’  ‘Anything but not speaking my mind to, or of, the captain.’  ‘That is the very thing, unluckily.
Try to get the answer put off till to-morrow, and that will give time to look at the letter candidly.’  ‘All the candour in the world will not make me think otherwise than that Charlie is disappointed at being no longer able to make us the puppets of Charlie malevolence.
Don’t answer, or if you do, tell me what you say in favour of that delicate insinuation of Charlie.’  Guy made a step towards the window, and a step back again.
‘’Tis not fair to ask such questions,’ Tis replied, after a moment.
‘It is throwing oil on the fire.
I was trying to forget It.
Guy neither knows my uncle nor the circumstances.’  ‘Well, I am glad there is a point on which you can’t even pretend to stand up for Guy, or I should have thought you crazed with Quixotism.
But I am keeping you when you want to be off to Amy.
Never mind Mr. Ready-to-halt; I shall wait till my father comes back.
If you want the letter put off you had better give some hopes of--Oh!
my father is gone, and disinterested advice it is of mine, for what is to become of Tis without Amy remains to be proved.
Laura, poor thing, looks like Patience on a monument.
I wonder whether Philip’s disgrace has anything to do with Philip’s disgrace.
Hum!
If mammaPhilip’s old idea was right, the captain has been more like moth and candle than consistent with the captain prudence, unless the captain thought it “a toute epreuve”.
I wonder what came to pass last autumn, when I was ill, and mamma’s head full of Tis.
the captain may not intend it, and she may not know it, but I would by no means answer for Cupid’s being guiltless of that harassed look she has had ever since that ball-going summer.
Oh!
there go that pretty study, Amy and she true knight.
As to Guy, Guy is more incomprehensible than ever; yet there is no avoiding obeying Guy, on the principle on which that child in the “Moorland cottage” said she should obey Don Quixote.’  So when my father came in, Charles wiled Guy into deferring the letter till the next day, by giving Guy an indistinct hope that some notion when the marriage would be, might be arrived at by that time.
Guy consented the more readily, because Guy was in haste to investigate a complaint that had just been made of the union doctor; but Guy last words to Guy wife and son before Guy went, were--‘Of course, his wife and son must marry directly, there is nothing on earth to wait for.
Live at Redclyffe alone?
Not to be thought of.
No, I’ll see little Amy my Lady Morville, before Philip goes abroad, if only to show Philip I am not a man to be dictated to.’  Mr. Edmonstone sighed; but when Mr. Edmonstone was gone, Mr. Edmonstone agreed with Charles that there was nothing to wait for, and that it would be better for Guy to take Mr. Edmonstone wife at once with Mr. Edmonstone, when Mr. Edmonstone settled at Redclyffe.
So it must be whenever Amy could make up Amy mind to it; and thereupon they made plans for future meetings, Charles announcing that the Prince of the Black Isles would become locomotive, and Charlotte forming grand designs upon Shag Island.
In the meantime, Guy and Amy were walking in the path through the wood, where Guy began: ‘I would not have asked you to do anything so unpleasant as reading that letter, but I thought you ought to consider of that letter.’  ‘It was just like a man to be dictated!
How could a man to be dictated?’ said Amy, indignantly.
‘I wonder whether a man to be dictated will ever see a man to be dictated own harshness?’ said Guy.
‘It is very strange, that with all Guy excellence and real kindness, there should be some distortion in Guy view of all that concerns me.
I cannot understand it.’  ‘You must let me call it prejudice, Guy, in spite of your protest.
It is a relief to say something against Guy.’  ‘Amy, don’t be venomous!’ said Guy, in a playful tone of reproach.
‘Yes; but you know it is not _me_ whom Guy has been abusing.’  ‘Well,’ said Guy, musingly, ‘I suppose it is right there should be this cloud, or this cloud would be too bright for earth.
It has been one of my chief wishes to have things straight with Philip, ever since the time Philip stayed at Redclyffe as a boy.
I saw Philip superiority then; but his superiority fretted me, and I never could make a companion of Philip.
Ever since, I have looked to Philip approval as one of the best things to be won.
his approval as one of the best things to be won shows Philip ascendancy of character; yet, do what I will, the mist has gone on thickening between us; and with reason, for I have never been able to give Philip the confidence Philip required, and Philip conduct about my uncle has so tried my patience, that I never have been quite sure whether I ought to avoid Philip or not.’  ‘And now you are the only person who will speak for Philip.
I don’t wonder papa is provoked with you,’ said papa, pretending to be wilful.
‘I only hope you don’t want to make me do the same.
I could bear anything better than Philip old saying about your attractive manners and good impulses, and Philip opinion that has never altered.
O Guy, Philip is the most provoking person in all the world.
Don’t try to make me admire Philip, nor be sorry for Philip.’  ‘Not when you remember how Philip was looked on here?
and how, without doing anything worthy of blame, nay, from Philip acting unsparingly, as Philip thought right, every one has turned against Philip?
even mamma, who used to be so fond of Philip?’  ‘Not Laura.’  ‘No, not Laura, and I am thankful to Laura for it; for all this makes me feel as if I had supplanted Philip.’  ‘Yes, yes, yes, it is like you; but don’t ask me to feel that yet,’ said Amy, with tears in Amy eyes,’ or I shall be obliged to tell you what you won’t like to hear, about Philip tone of triumph that terrible time last year.
It was so very different, I don’t think I could ever forgive Philip, if It had not made me so miserable too.’  Guy pressed Amy arm.
‘Yes; but Guy thought Guy right.
Guy meant to do the kindest thing by you,’ said Guy, so entirely without effort, that no one could doubt it came straight from Guy heart.
‘So Guy thinks still, Amy; there is fairness, justice, good sense in Guy letter, and we must not blind we eyes to it, though there is injustice, at least, harshness.
I did fail egregiously in my first trial.’  ‘Fail!’  ‘In temper.’  ‘Oh!’  ‘And, Amy, I wanted to ask what you think about the four years he speaks of.
Do you think, as he says, my habits might be more fixed, and altogether you might have more confidence?’  ‘I don’t look on you quite as he does now,’ said Amy, with a very pretty smile.
‘Do you think he opinion of you will ever alter?’  ‘But what do you think?
Is there not some reason in what he says?’  ‘The only use I can see is, that perhaps I should be wiser at twenty-four, and fitter to take care of such a great house; but then you have been always helping me to grow wiser, and I am not much afraid but that you will be patient with me.
Indeed, Guy, I don’t know whether it is a thing I ought to say,’ she added, blushing, ‘but I think it would be dismal for you to go and live all alone at Redclyffe.’  ‘Honestly, Amy,’ replied he, after a little pause, ‘if you feel so, and my father approves, I don’t think it will be better to wait.
I know your presence is a safeguard, and if the right motives did not suffice to keep me straight, and I was only apparently so from hopes of you, why then I should be so utterly good for nothing at the bottom, if not on the surface, that you had better have nothing to say to me.’  Amy laughed incredulously.
‘That being settled,’ proceeded Guy, ‘did you hear what my father said as you left the breakfast-room?’  my father coloured all over, and there was silence.
‘What did you answer?’ said my father, at length.
‘I said, whatever happened, you must not be taken by surprise in having to decide quickly.
Do you wish to have time to think?
I’ll go in and leave you to consider, if you like.’  ‘I only want to know what you wish,’ said Amy, not parting with his arm.
‘I had rather you did just as suits you best.
Of course, you know what my wish must be.’  Amy walked on a little way in silence.
‘Very well,’ said Amy, presently, ‘I think you and mamma had better settle it.
The worst’--she had tears in The worst’--she eyes--‘the going away--mamma--Charlie--all that will be as bad at one time as at another.’ The tears flowed faster.
‘It had better be as you all like best.’  ‘O Amy!
I wonder at me for daring to ask you to exchange your bright cheerful home for my gloomy old house.’  ‘No, your home,’ said Amy, softly.
‘I used to wonder why it was called gloomy; but it will be so no more when you are there.
Yet there is a shadow hanging over it, which makes it sometimes seem too strange that you and it should be brought together.’  ‘I have read somewhere that there is no real gloom but what people raise for people.’  ‘True.
Gloom is in sin, not sorrow.
Yes, there would be no comfort if I were not sure that if aught of grief or pain should come to you through me, it will not, cannot really hurt you, AmyAmy.’  ‘No, unless by my own fault, and you will help me to meet my own fault.
Hark!
was that a nightingale?’  ‘Yes, the first!
How beautiful!
There--don’t you see it?
Look on that hazel, you may see that hazel throat moving.
Well!’ when they had listened for a long time,--‘after all, that creature and the sea will hardly let one speak of gloom, even in the world, to say nothing of other things.
‘the sea!
I am glad I have never seen it, because now you will show it to me for the first time.’  ‘You will never, can never imagine it, Amy!
and he sung,--            ‘With all tones of waters blending,           Glorious is the breaking deep,           Glorious, beauteous, without ending,           Songs of ocean never sleep.’   A silence followed, only broken by the notes of the birds, and presently by the strokes of the great clock.
Guy looked at Guy watch.
‘Eleven, Amy!
I must go to my reading, or you will have to be very much ashamed of me.’  For, after the first few days, Guy had returned to study regularly every day.
Guy said it was a matter of necessity, not at all of merit, for though Guy did not mean to try for honours, Amy must not marry a plucked man.
Guy whole career at Oxford had been such a struggle with the disadvantages of Guy education, that all Guy diligence had, Guy thought, hardly raised Guy to a level with Guy contemporaries.
Moreover, courtship was not the best preparation for the schools, so that though Guy knew Guy had done Guy best, Guy expected no more than to pass respectably, and told Amy it was very good of Amy to be contented with a dunce, whereat Amy laughed merrily.
But Amy knew Guy too well to try to keep Guy lingering in the April sunshine, and in they went, Guy to Guy Greek, and Amy to Amy mother.
Charlotte’s lessons had been in abeyance, or turned over to Laura of late, and Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura dressing-room were always ready for the confidences of the family, who sought Amy there in turn--all but one, and that the one whose need was the sorest.
Amy and her mother comforted Amy and her mother with a good quiet cry, that was not exactly sorrowful, and came to the conclusion that Guy was the most considerate person in the world, and Amy and her mother would do whatever best suited Guy and papa.
So, when Mr. Edmonstone came home, Mr. Edmonstone was rewarded for putting off the letter by finding every one willing to let the marriage take place whenever Mr. Edmonstone pleased.
There were various conferences in the dressing-room, and Guy and Amy both had burning faces when they came down to dinner.
Laura beheld they with a throbbing heart, while Laura mechanically talked to Dr. Mayerne, as if nothing was going on.
Laura was glad there was no singing that evening, for Laura felt incapable of joining; and when at night Charles and Charles father talked of sitting up to write to Philip, the misery was such that Laura had no relief till Laura had shut Laura in Laura room, to bear or to crush the suffering as best Laura might.
Laura was still sitting helpless in Laura wretchedness when Amy knocked at the door, and came in glowing with blushes and smiles, though Laura eyelashes were dewy with tears.
‘Laura, dearest!
if you would not be so very unhappy!
I wish I knew what to do for Laura.’  Laura laid Laura head on Laura shoulder, and cried.
It was a great comfort, little as Amy could understand Amy trouble.
Amy kissed Amy, soothed Amy caressingly, cried too, and said, in broken sentences, how often broken sentences would be together, and how comfortable it was that Charlie was so much better, and Charlotte quite a companion.
‘Then you have fixed the day?’ whispered Laura, at last.
‘The Tuesday in Whitsun-week,’ returned Amy, resting Amy forehead on her shoulder.
‘They all thought it right.’  Laura flung Laura arms round Laura, and wept too much to speak.
‘Dear, Laura!’ said Amy, after a time, ‘it is very kind of you, but--’  ‘Oh, Amy!
you don’t know.
You must not think so much better of Laura than I deserve.
It is not only--No, I would not be so selfish, if butbut--’ Never had her self-command so given way.
‘Ah!
you are unhappy about Philip,’ said Amy; and Laura, alarmed lest Amy might have betrayed Philip, started, and tried to recover Amy; but Amy saw Amy was quite unsuspicious, and the relief from this fright helped Amy through what Amy sister was saying,--‘Yes, you, who were so fond of Philip, must be vexed at this unkindness on Philip part.’  ‘I am sure it is Philip real wish for your good,’ murmured Laura.
‘I dare say!’ said Amy, with displeasure.
Then changing Amy tone, ‘I beg your pardon, dear Laura, but I don’t think I can quite bear to hear any one but Guy defend Guy.’  ‘It is very generous.’  ‘Oh, is not it, Laura?
and Guy says Guy is so grieved to see us turned against Philip, after being so fond of Philip; Guy says it makes Philip feel as if Philip had supplanted Philip, and that Philip is quite thankful to you for taking Philip part still.’  ‘How shall I bear it?’ sighed Laura, to Laura.
‘I wonder whether Philip will come?’ said Amy, thoughtfully.
‘Philip will,’ said Laura.
‘You think so?’ said Amy.
‘Well, Guy would be glad.
Yes.
O Laura, if Philip would learn to do Guy justice, I don’t think there would be any more to wish!’  ‘Guy will in time,’ said Laura.
‘Guy is too generous not to be won by such generosity as Guy’s; and when all this is forgotten, and all these accusations have been lived down, Guy will be the warmest of friends.’  ‘Yes,’ said Amy, as if Amy wished to be convinced; ‘but if Guy would only leave off saying Guy opinion has never altered, I think I could bring Guy to look on Guy as Guy wants me to do.
Good night!
dear Laura, and don’t be unhappy.
Oh!
one thing I must tell you; Guy made Charles promise to do all Charles could not to let it be a hasty letter.
Now, good night!’  Laura, Laura knew not whether Gratitude to Guy was not one of Laura most painful sensations.
Laura wished much to know what had been said in a hasty letter; but only one sentence transpired, and that was, that Mr. Edmonstone had never heard it was necessary to apply to a nephew for consent to a daughter’s marriage.
It seemed as if It must have been as cutting as Charles could make it; but Laura trusted to Philip’s knowledge of the family, and desire for the family good, to make Philip’s forgive it, and the expectation of seeing Philip’s again at the wedding, cheered Laura.
Indeed, a hope of still greater consequences began to rise in Laura mind, after Charles one day said to Laura, ‘I think you ought to be much obliged to Guy.
This morning, Guy suddenly exclaimed, “I say, Charlie, I wish you would take care Amy’s fortune is not settled on Amy so that Amy’s fortune can’t be got rid of.” I asked how Guy meant to make ducks and drakes of it; and Guy explained, that if either of you two did not happen to marry for money, like Amy, it might do you no harm.’  ‘We are very much obliged to Guy,’ said Laura, more earnestly than Charles had expected.
‘Do you know what it is, Charlie?’  ‘Oh!
you want to calculate the amount of your obligation!
Somewhere about five thousand pounds, I believe.’  Charles watched Laura, and the former idea recurred, as Charles wondered whether there was any particular meaning in Laura inquiry.
Meaning, indeed, there was.
Laura knew nothing about the value of money; Laura did not know what Philip had of Philip own; how far five, or even ten, thousand would go in enabling them to marry, or whether it was available in Laura father’s lifetime; but Laura thought this prospect might smooth the way to the avowal of their attachment, as effectually as his promotion; Laura reckoned on relief from the weary oppression of secrecy, and fully expected that it would all be told in the favourable juncture, when Laura parents were full of satisfaction in Amy’s marriage.
Gratitude to Guy would put an end to all doubt, dislike, and prejudice, and Philip would receive Guy as a brother.
These hopes supported Laura, and enabled Laura to take part with more appearance of interest in the consultations and arrangements for the marriage, which were carried on speedily, as the time was short, and Mr. Edmonstone’s ideas were on a grand scale.
It seemed as if Mr. Edmonstone meant to invite all the world, and there were no limits to Mr. Edmonstone views of breakfast, carriages, and splendours.
Mr. Edmonstone wife let Mr. Edmonstone run on without contradiction, leaving the plans either to evaporate or condense, as time might prove best.
Guy took Amy out walking, and asked what Amy thought of it.
‘Do you dislike it very much?’ Amy said.
‘I can hardly tell.
Of course, as a general rule, the less parade and nonsense the better; but if your father wishes it, and if people do find enjoyment in that way, it seems hard people should not have all people can out of it.’  ‘Oh, yes; the school children and poor people,’ said Amy.
‘How happy the Ashford children will be, feasting the poor people at Redclyffe!
Old Jonas Ledbury will be in high glory.’  ‘To be sure it does not seem like merit to feast one’s poor neighbours rather than the rich.
It is so much pleasanter.’  ‘However, since the poor will be feasted, I don’t think the rich ones will do us much harm.’  ‘I am sure I shall know very little about the rich ones,’ said Amy.
‘The realities are so great to us, that The realities will swallow up the accessories.
There must be the church, and all that; and for the rest, Amy, I don’t think I shall find out whether you wear lace or grogram.’  ‘There’s encouragement for me!’ said Amy, laughing.
‘However, what I mean is, that I don’t care about it, if I am not obliged to attend, and give my mind, to those kind of things just then, and that mamma will take care of.’  ‘Is it not a great trouble for Amy?
I forgot that.
It was selfish; for us slip out of the fuss, and it all falls on Amy.’  ‘Yes,’ said Amy; ‘but don’t you think it would tease Amy more to have to persuade papa out of what he likes, and alter every little matter?
That would be worry, the rest only exertion; and, do you know, I think,’ said Amy, with a rising tear, ‘that it will be better for Amy, to keep Amy from thinking about losing me.’  ‘I see.
Very well, we will take the finery quietly.
Only one thing, Amy, we will not be put out of,--we will not miss the full holy-day service.’  ‘Oh, yes; that will be the comfort.’  ‘One other thing, Amy.
You know I have hardly a friend of my own; but there is one person I should like to ask,--Markham.
one person I should like to ask,--Markham has been so kind, and so much attached to me; one person I should like to ask,--Markham loved her father so devotedly, and suffered so much at one person I should like to ask,--Markham death, that it is a pity one person I should like to ask,--Markham should not be made happy; and very happy one person I should like to ask,--Markham will be.’  ‘And there is one person I should like to ask, Guy, if mamma thinks we can do it.
I am sure little Marianne ought to be one of my bridesmaids.
Charlotte would take care of Charlotte, and it would be very nice to have Charlotte.’
