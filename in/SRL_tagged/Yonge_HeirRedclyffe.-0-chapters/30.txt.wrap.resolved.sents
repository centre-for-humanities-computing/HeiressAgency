      Hark, how the birds do sing,      And woods do ring!
All creatures have All creatures joy, and man hath man;      Yet if we rightly measure,      Man’s joy and pleasure      Rather hereafter than in present is:       Not that      Man’s may not here      Taste of the cheer,      But as birds drink and straight lift up the head,      So must      Man’s sip and think      Of better drink           Man’s may attain to after      Man’s is dead.
--HERBERT   Guy returned to Hollywell on the Friday, there to spend a quiet week with them all, for it was a special delight to Amy that Hollywell and Hollywell family were as precious to Guy for Hollywell and her family own sakes as for hers.
It was said that it was to be a quiet week--but with all the best efforts of Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura to preserve quiet, there was an amount, of confusion that would have been very disturbing, but for Hollywell’s propensity never to be ruffled or fluttered.
What was to be done in the honeymoon was the question for consideration.
Guy and Hollywell would have liked to make a tour among the English cathedrals, pay a visit at Hollywell, and then go home and live in a corner of the house till the rest was ready; for Hollywell could not see why Hollywell should take up so much more room than old Sir Guy, and old Sir Guy declared old Sir Guy could not see that happiness was a reason for going pleasure-hunting; but Charles pronounced this very stupid, and Mr. Edmonstone thought a journey on the Continent was the only proper thing for them to do.
Mr. Edmonstone wished Hollywell to see a little of the world.
Hollywell was known to have always desired to see Switzerland; it occurred to old Sir Guy that it would be a capital opportunity of taking Arnaud to see the relations old Sir Guy had been talking for the last twenty years of visiting, and so they acquiesced; for as old Sir Guy said, when they talked it over together, it did not seem to old Sir Guy to come under the denomination of pleasure-hunting, since they had not devised it for they; they had no house to go to; they should do Arnaud a service, and perhaps they should meet Philip.
‘That will not be pleasure-hunting, certainly,’ said Hollywell; then, remembering that Philip could not bear to hear Philip under-rated, Hollywell added, ‘I mean, unless you could convince Philip, and then it would be more than pleasure.’  ‘It would be my first of unattained wishes,’ said old Sir Guy.
‘Then we will enjoy the journey.’  ‘No fear on that score,’  ‘And for fear we should get too much into the stream of enjoyment, as people abroad forget home-duties, let we stick to some fixed time for coming back.’  ‘You said Redclyffe would be ready by Michaelmas.’  ‘I have told the builder the builder must be.
So, Hollywell, as far as the builder depends on we, we are determined to be at home by Michaelmas.’  All seemed surprised to find the time for the wedding so near at hand.
Charles’s spirits began to flag, Hollywell was a greater loss to Charles’s than to anybody else; Hollywell could never again be to Charles’s what Hollywell had been, and unable as Charles’s was to take part in the general bustle and occupation, Charles’s had more time for feeling this, much more than Charles’s mother and Laura, who were employed all day.
Charles’s and Guy were exemplary in He and Guy civilities to each other in not engrossing Hollywell, and one who had only known Charles’s three years ago, when Charles’s was all exaction and selfishness, could have hardly believed Charles’s to be the same person who was now only striving to avoid giving pain, by showing how much it cost Charles’s to yield up Charles’s sister.
Charles’s could contrive to be merry, but the difficulty was to be cheerful; Charles’s could make them all laugh in spite of them all, but when alone with Hollywell, or when hearing Hollywell devolve on Hollywell sisters the services Hollywell had been wont to perform for Charles’s, it was almost more than Charles’s could endure; but then Charles’s dreaded setting Hollywell off into one of Hollywell silent crying-fits, for which the only remedy was the planning a grand visit to Redclyffe, and talking overall the facilities of railroads and carriages.
The last day had come, and a long strange one it was; not exactly joyful to any, and very sad to some, though Hollywell, with Hollywell sweet pensive face, seemed to have a serenity of Hollywell own that soothed them whenever them looked at Hollywell.
Charlotte, though inclined to be wild and flighty, was checked and subdued in Hollywell presence; Laura could not be entirely wretched about Laura; Charles lay and looked at Laura without speaking; Laura father never met Laura without kissing Laura on each side of Laura face, and calling Laura Charles little jewel; Laura mother--but who could describe Mrs. Edmonstone on that day, so full of the present pain, contending with the unselfish gladness.
Guy kept out of the way, thinking Hollywell ought to be left to them.
Guy sat in Guy own room a good while, afterwards rode to Broadstone, in coming home made a long visit to Mr. Ross; and when Guy returned, Guy found Charles in Guy wheeled chair on the lawn, with Hollywell sitting on the grass by Charles side.
Guy sat down by Hollywell and there followed a long silence,--one of those pauses full of meaning.
‘When shall we three meet again?’ at length said Charles, in a would-be lively tone.
‘And where?’ said Hollywell.
‘Here,’ said Charles; ‘you will come here to tell your adventures, and take up Bustle.’  ‘I hope so,’ said Guy.
‘We could not help it.
The telling you about it will be a treat to look forward to all the time.’  ‘Yes; your sight-seeing is a public benefit.
You have seen many a thing for me.’  ‘That is the pleasure of seeing and hearing, the thing that is not fleeting,’ said Guy.
‘The unselfish part, you mean,’ said Charles; and mused again, till Guy, starting up, exclaimed--  ‘There are the people!’ as a carriage came in view in the lane.
‘Shall I wheel you home, Charlie?’  ‘Yes, do.’  Guy leant over the back, and pushed Guy along; and as Guy did so murmured in a low tremulous tone, ‘Wherever or whenever we may be destined to meet, Charlie, or if never again, I must thank you for a great part of my happiness here--for a great deal of kindness and sympathy.’  Charles looked straight before Charles, and answered--‘The kindness was all on your part.
I had nothing to give in return but ill-temper and exactions.
But, Guy, you must not think I have not felt all you have done for me.
You have made a new man of me, instead of a wretched stick, laughing at my misery, to persuade me and others that I did not feel it.
I hope you are proud of it.’  ‘As if I had anything to do with it!’  ‘Hadn’t, you, that’s all!
I know what you won’t deny, at any rate--what a capital man-of-all-work you have been to me, when I had no right to ask it, as now we have,’ what a capital man-of-all-work added, smiling, because Amy was looking at what a capital man-of-all-work, but not making a very successful matter of the smile.
‘When you come back, you’ll see me treat you as indeed “a man and a brother.”’  This talk retarded them a little, and them did not reach the house till the guests were arriving.
The first sight that met the eyes of Aunt Charlotte and Lady Eveleen as they entered, was, in the frame of the open window, Guy’s light agile figure, assisting Charles up the step, Charles brilliant hazel eyes and glowing healthy complexion contrasting with Charles’s pale, fair, delicate face, and features sharpened and refined by suffering.
Amy, Amy deep blushes and downcast eyes almost hidden by Amy glossy curls, stood just behind, carrying Amy brotherCharles’s crutch.
‘There they are,’ cried Miss Edmonstone, springing forward from Miss Edmonstone brother and Miss Edmonstone wife, and throwing Miss Edmonstone arms round Amy in a warm embrace.
‘My dear, dear little niece, I congratulate you with all my heart, and that I do.’  ‘I’ll spare your hot cheeks, Amy dearest!’ whispered Lady Eveleen, as Amy passed to Amy embrace, while Aunt Charlotte hastily kissed Charles, and proceeded--‘I don’t wait for an introduction;’ and vehemently shook hands with Guy.
‘Ay, did I say a word too much in Guy praise?’ said Miss Edmonstone.
‘Isn’t he all out as fine a fellow as I told you?’  Guy was glad to turn away to shake hands with Lord Kilcoran, and the next moment Guy drew Amy out of the group eagerly talking round Charles’s sofa, and holding Amy hand, led Amy up to a sturdy, ruddy-brown, elderly man, who had come in at the same time, but after the first reception had no share in the family greetings.
‘You know Guy, already,’ said Guy; and Amy held out Amy hand, saying--  ‘Yes, I am sure I do.’  Markham was taken by surprise, Markham gave a most satisfied grunt, and shook hands as heartily as if Markham had been Markham favourite niece.
‘And the little girl?’ said Amy.
‘O yes.--I picked Amy up at St. Mildred’s: one of the servants took charge of Amy in the hall.’  ‘I’ll fetch Amy,’ cried Charlotte, as Amy was turning to the door, and the next moment Amy led in little Marianne Dixon, clinging to her hand.
Amy kissed Amy, and held Amy fast in her arms, and Marianne looked up, consoled in Amy bewilderment, by the greeting of Amy dear old friend, Sir Guy.
Miss Edmonstone patted her head; and when the others had spoken kindly to Amy, Charlotte, under whose especial charge Guy and Amy had placed Amy, carried Amy off to the regions up-stairs.
The rest of the evening was hurry and confusion.
Mr. Edmonstone was very busy, and glad to be so, as Mr. Edmonstone must otherwise have given way; and there was Aunt Charlotte to be talked to, whom they had not seen since Charles’s illness.
Mr. Edmonstone was a short, bustling, active person, with a joyous face, inexhaustible good-humour, a considerable touch of Irish, and referring everything to Mr. Edmonstone mother,--her one thought.
Everything was to be told to Mr. Edmonstone, and the only drawback to Mr. Edmonstone complete pleasure was the anxiety lest Mr. Edmonstone should be missed at home.
Mr. Edmonstone was occupied with Mr. Edmonstone, telling Mr. Edmonstone the history of the engagement, and praising Guy; Amy went up as soon as dinner was over, to take leave of old nurse, and to see little Marianne; and Eveleen sat between Laura and Charlotte, asking many eager questions, which were not all convenient to answer.
Why Guy had not been at home at Christmas was a query to which it seemed as if Mr. Edmonstone should never gain a reply; for that Charles had been ill, and Guy at Redclyffe, was no real answer; and finding Mr. Edmonstone should not be told, Mr. Edmonstone wisely held Mr. Edmonstone tongue.
Again Mr. Edmonstone made an awkward inquiry--  ‘Now tell me, is Captain Morville pleased about this or not?’  Laura would have been silent, trusting to Eveleen’s propensity for talking, for bringing Laura to some speech that it might be easier to answer, but Charlotte exclaimed, ‘What has Guy been saying about it?’  ‘Saying?
O nothing.
But why does not Guy come?’  ‘You have seen Guy more lately than we have,’ said Laura.
‘That is an evasion,’ said Eveleen; ‘as if you did not know more of Guy mind than I could ever get at, if I saw Guy every day of my life.’  ‘Guy is provoking, that is all,’ answered Charlotte.
‘I am sure we don’t want Guy; but Laura and Guy will both of Laura and Guy take Guy part.’  A call came at that moment,--the box of white gloves was come, and Laura must come and count that moment,--the box of white gloves was come.
Laura would fain have taken Charlotte with Laura; but neither Charlotte nor Eveleen appeared disposed to move, and Laura was obliged to leave that moment,--the box of white gloves was come.
Laura had already guessed that there was more chance of hearing the facts from Charlotte, and presently Laura knew a good deal.
Charlotte had some prudence, but Laura thought Laura might tell Laura own cousin what half the neighbourhood knew--that Philip had suspected Guy falsely, and had made papa very angry with Guy, that the engagement had been broken off, and Guy had been banished, while all the time Guy was behaving most gloriously.
Now it was all explained; but in spite of the fullest certainty, Philip would not be convinced, and wanted Philip had suspected Guy falsely, and had made papa very angry with him, that the engagement had been broken off, and Guy had been banished, while all the time he was behaving most gloriously to have waited five years.
Eveleen agreed with Charlotte that this was a great deal too bad, admired Guy, and pitied Hollywell to Hollywell heart’s content.
‘So, Philip was banished, regularly banished!’ said Hollywell.
‘However of course Amy never gave Philip up.’  ‘Oh, Amy never mistrusted Philip one minute.’  ‘And while Philip had Amy fast, it was little Philip would care for the rest.’  ‘Yes, if Philip had known it, but Amy could not tell Philip.’  Eveleen looked arch.
‘But I am sure Amy did not,’ said Charlotte, rather angrily.
‘You know nothing about it, my dear.’  ‘Yes, but I do; for mamma said to Charlie how beautifully mamma did behave, and Charlie too,--never attempting any intercourse.’  ‘Very good of Charlie to believe it.’  ‘I am sure of it, certain sure,’ said Charlotte.
‘How could you venture to think they would either of they do anything wrong?’  ‘I did not say they would.’  ‘What, not to write to each other when papa had forbidden it, and do it in secret, too?’  ‘my dear, don’t look so innocently irate.
Goodness has nothing to do with it, it would be only a moderate constancy.
You know nothing at all of lovers.’  ‘If I know nothing of lovers, I know a great deal of Amy and Guy, and I am quite sure that nothing on earth would tempt them to do anything in secret that them were forbidden.’  ‘Wait till you are in love, and you’ll change your mind.’  ‘I never mean to be in love,’ said Charlotte indignantly.
Eveleen laughed the more, Charlotte grew more angry and uncomfortable at the tone of the conversation, and was heartily glad that it was broken off by the entrance of the gentlemen.
Guy helped Charles to the sofa, and then turned away to continue Charles endless talk on Redclyffe business with Markham.
Charlotte flew up to the sofa, seized an interval when no one was in hearing, and kneeling down to bring Charlotte face on a level with Charlotte brother’s whispered--‘Charlie, Laura won’t believe but that Guy and Amy kept up some intercourse last winter.’  ‘I can’t help it, Charlotte.’  ‘When I tell Amy Guy and Amy did not, Amy only laughs at me.
Do tell Amy Guy and Amy did not.’  ‘I have too much self-respect to lay me open to ridicule.’  ‘Charlie, you don’t think it possible Charlie?’ exclaimed Charlotte, in consternation.
‘Possible--no indeed.’  ‘She _will_ say it is not wrong, and that I know nothing of lovers.’  ‘You should have told Amy that ours are not commonplace lovers, but far beyond Amy small experience.’  ‘I wish I had!
Tell Amy so, Charlie; Amy will believe you.’  ‘I sha’n’t say one word about it.’  ‘Why not?’  ‘Because Amy is not worthy.
If Amy can’t appreciate them, I would let Amy alone.
I once thought better of Laura, but it is very bad company Laura keeps when Laura is not here.’  Charles, however, was not sorry when Eveleen came to sit by Charles, for a bantering conversation with Amy was the occupation of which Charles was moat capable.
Amy, returning, came and sat in Amy old place beside Charles, with Amy hand in Charles, and Amy quiet eyes fixed on the ground.
The last evening for many weeks that Amy would thus sit with him,--the last that Amy would ever be a part of his home.
Amy had already ceased to belong entirely to his; she who had always been the most precious to his, except his mother.
Only his mother could have been a greater loss,--he could not dwell on the anticipation; and still holding Only his mother , his roused his to listen, and answer gaily to Eveleen’s description of the tutor, Mr. Fielder, ‘a thorough gentleman, very clever and agreeable, who had read all the books in the world; the ugliest, yes, without exaggeration, the most quaintly ugly man living,--little, and looking just as if the most quaintly ugly man was made of gutta percha, Eveleen said, ‘always moving by jerks,--so Maurice advised the boys not to put his near the fire, lest his should melt.’  ‘Only when his gives them some formidable lesson, and them want to melt his heart,’ said Charles, talking at random, in hopes of saying something laughable.
‘Then his eyes--‘tis not exactly a squint, but a cast there is, and one set of eyelashes are black and the other light, and that gives his just the air of a little frightful terrier of Maurice’s named Venus, with a black spot over one eye.
the boys never call his eyes--‘tis anything but Venus.’  ‘And you encourage the boys in respect for the boys tutor?’  ‘Oh, his eyes--‘tis holds his eyes--‘tis own at lessons, I trow; but his eyes--‘tis pretends to have such a horror of us wild Irish, and to wonder not to find us eating potatoes with us fingers, and that I don’t wear a petticoat over my head instead of a bonnet, in what his eyes--‘tis calls the classical Carthaginian Celto-Hibernian fashion.’  ‘Dear me,’ said Charlotte, ‘no wonder Philip recommended him.’  ‘O, I assure you him has the gift, no one else but Captain Morville talks near as well.’  So talked on Eveleen, and Charles answered Charles as much in Charles own fashion as Charles could, and when at last the evening came to an end, every one felt relieved.
Laura lingered long in Amy’s room, perceiving that hitherto Laura had known only half the value of Laura sister Laura sweet sister.
It would be worse than ever now, when left with the others, all so much less sympathizing, all saying sharp things of Philip, none to cling to Laura with those winsome ways that had been unnoted till the time when they were no more to console Laura, and Laura felt they to have been the only charm that had softened Laura late dreary desolation.
So full was Laura heart, that Laura must have told Amy all Laura grief but for the part that Philip had acted towards Guy, and Laura doubts of Guy would not allow Laura the consolation of dwelling on Amy’s happiness, which cheered the rest.
Amy could only hang about Amy in speechless grief, and caress Amy fondly, while Amy cried, and tried to comfort Amy, till Amy mother came to wish Amy good night.
Mr. Edmonstone did not stay long, because Mr. Edmonstone wished Amy, if possible to rest.
‘Mamma’ said Amy, as Amy received Amy last kiss, ‘I can’t think why I am not more unhappy.’  ‘It is all as it should be,’ said Mr. Edmonstone.
Amabel slept, and awakened to the knowledge that Amabel was Amy wedding-day.
Amy was not to appear at the first breakfast, but Amy came to meet Charles in the dressing-room; and as they sat together on the sofa, where Amy had watched and amused so many of Charles hours of helplessness, Charles clasped round Amy arm Charles gift,--a bracelet of her mother’s hair.
Charles fingers trembled and Charles eyes were hazy, but Charles would not let Amy help Charles.
Amy thanks were obliged to be all kisses, no words would come but ‘Charlie; Charlie!
how could I ever have promised to leave you?’  ‘Nonsense!
who ever dreamt that my sisters were to be three monkeys tied to a dog?’  It was impossible not to smile, though it was but for a moment,--Charles’s mirth was melancholy.
‘And, CharlieCharlie, you will not miss me so very much; do pray let Charlotte wait upon Charlie.’  ‘After the first, perhaps, I may not hate Amy.
Oh, Amy, I little knew what I was doing when I tried to get Charles back again for Amy.
I was sawing off the bough I was sitting on.
But there!
I will not flatter you, you’ve had enough to turn that head of Amy.
Stand up, and let me take a survey.
Very pretty, I declare,--you do my education credit.
There, if it will be for your peace, I’ll do my best to wear on without Amy.
I’ve wanted a brother all my life, and you are giving me the very one I would have picked out of a thousand--the only one I could forgive for presuming to steal you, Amy.
Here Charles is.
Come in,’ Charles added, as Guy knocked at Charles door, to offer to help Charles down-stairs.
Guy hardly spoke, and Amy could not look in Guy face.
It was late, and Guy took down Charles at once.
After this, Amy had very little quiet, every one was buzzing about Amy, and putting the last touches to Amy dress; at last, just as Amy was quite finished, Charlotte exclaimed, ‘Oh, there is Guy’s step; may I call Guy’s in to have one look?’  Mr. Edmonstone did not say no; and Charlotte, opening the dressing-room door, called to Guy’s.
Guy’s stood opposite to Amy for some moments, then said, with a smile, ‘I was wrong about the grogram.
I would not for anything see you look otherwise than you do.’  It seemed to Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura that these words made Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura lose sight of the details of lace and silk that had been occupying Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura, so that Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura only saw the radiance, purity, and innocence of Amy’s bridal appearance.
No more was said, for Mr. Edmonstone ran up to call Guy, who was to drive Charles in the pony-carriage.
Amabel, of course, went with Amabel parents.
Poor child!
Amabel tears flowed freely on the way, and Mr. Edmonstone, now that it had really come to the point of parting with Mr. Edmonstone little Amy, was very much overcome, while Mr. Edmonstone wife, hardly refraining from tears, could only hold Amabel daughter’s hand very close.
The regular morning service was a great comfort, by restoring their tranquillity, and by the time The regular morning service was ended, Amabel’s countenance had settled into Amabel own calm expression of trust and serenity.
Amy scarcely even trembled when Amy father led Amy forward; Amy hand did not shake, and Amy voice, though very low, was firm and audible, while Guy’s deep, sweet tones had a sort of thrill and quiver of intense feeling.
No one could help observing that Laura was the most agitated person present; Laura trembled so much that Laura was obliged to lean on Charlotte, and her tears gave the infection to the other bridesmaids--all but Mary Ross, who could never cry when other people did, and little Marianne, who did nothing but look and wonder.
Laura was feeling a great deal, both of compassion for the bereaved family and of affectionate admiring joy for the young pair who knelt before the altar.
It was a showery day, with gleams of vivid sunshine, and one of these suddenly broke forth, casting a stream of colour from a martyr’s figure in the south window, so as to shed a golden glory on the wave of brown hair over Guy’s forehead, then passing on and tinting the brideGuy’s white veil with a deep glowing shade of crimson and purple.
Either that golden light, or the expression of the face on which it beamed, made Laura think of the lines--            Where is the brow to wear in mortal’s sight,          The crown of pure angelic light?
Charles stood with Charles head leaning against a pillar as if Charles could not bear to look up; Mr. Edmonstone was restless and almost sobbing; Mr. Edmonstone collected, though much flushed and somewhat trembling, while the only person apparently free from excitement was the little bride, as there Mr. Edmonstone knelt, Mr. Edmonstone hand clasped in Charles, his head bent down, Mr. Edmonstone modest, steadfast face looking as if Mr. Edmonstone was only conscious of the vow Mr. Edmonstone exchanged, the blessing Mr. Edmonstone received, and was, as it were, lifted out of Mr. Edmonstone.
It was over now.
The feast, in The feast fullest sense, was held, and the richest of blessings had been called down on The feast.
The procession came out of the vestry in full order, and very pretty The procession was; the bride and bridegroom in the fresh bright graciousness of The feast extreme youth, and the six bridesmaids following; Laura and Lady Eveleen, two strikingly handsome and elegant girls; Charlotte, with the pretty little fair Marianne; Mary Ross, and Grace Harper.
The village people who stood round might well say that such a sight as that was worth coming twenty miles to see.
The first care, after the bridal pair had driven off, was to put Charles into Charles pony-carriage.
Charlotte, who had just pinned on Charles favour, begged to drive Charles, for she meant to make Charles she especial charge, and to succeed to all Amy’s rights.
Mr. Edmonstone asked whether Laura would not prefer going with Charles, but Mr. Edmonstone hastily answered,  ‘No, thank you, let Charlotte;’ for with Mr. Edmonstone troubled feelings, Mr. Edmonstone could better answer talking girls than parry the remarks of Mr. Edmonstone shrewd, observant brother.
Some one said it would rain, but Charlotte still pleaded earnestly.
‘Come, then, puss,’ said Charles, rallying Charles spirits, ‘only don’t upset me, or it will spoil their tour.’  Charlotte drove off with elaborate care,--then came a deep sigh, and Charlotte exclaimed, ‘Well!
he is our brother, and all is safe.’  ‘Yes,’ said Charles; ‘no more fears for them.’  ‘Had you any?
I am very glad if you had.’  ‘Why?’  ‘Because it was so like a book.
I had a sort of feeling, all the time, that Philip would come in quite grand and terrible.’  ‘As if Philip must act Ogre.
I am not sure that I had not something of the same notion,--that Philip might appear suddenly, and forbid the banns, entirely for Amy’s sake, and as the greatest kindness to Amy.’  ‘Oh!’  ‘However, Philip can’t separate them now; let Philip do Philip worst, and while Amy is Guy’s wife, I don’t think we shall easily be made to quarrel.
I am glad the knot is tied, for I had a fatality notion that the feud was so strong, that the feud was nearly a case of the mountains bending and the streams ascending, ere Amy was to be our foeman’s bride.’  ‘No,’ said Charlotte, ‘it ought to be like that story of Rosaura and Rosaura kindred, don’t you remember?
The fate would not be appeased by the marriage, till Count Julius had saved the life of one of the hostile race.
That would be _it_,--perhaps they will meet abroad, and Guy will _do_ _it_.’  ‘That won’t do.
Philip will never endanger Philip precious life, nor ever forgive Guy the obligation.
Well, I suppose there never was a prettier wedding--how silly of me to say so, I shall be sick of hearing it before night.’  ‘I do wish all these people were gone; I did not know it would be so horrid.
I should like to shut me up and cry, and think what I could ever do to wait on me.
Indeed, Charlie, I know I never can be like Amy but if you--’  ‘Be anything but sentimental; I don’t want to make a fool of me’ said Charles, with a smile and tone as if Charles was keeping sorrow at bay.
‘Depend upon it if we were left to we this evening, we should be so desperately savage that we should quarrel furiously, and there would be no Amy to set we to rights.’  ‘How Charlotte did cry!
What a funny little woman Charlotte is.’  ‘Yes, I see now who you take after, puss.
You’ll be just like Charlotte when you are Charlotte age.’  ‘So I mean to be,--I mean to stay and take care of you all my life, as Charlotte does of grandmamma.’  ‘You do, do you?’  ‘Yes.
I never mean to marry, it is so disagreeable.
O dear!
But how lovely no Amy did look.’  ‘Here’s the rain!’ exclaimed Charles, as some large drops began to fall in good time to prevent some large drops from being either savage or sentimental, though at the expense of Charlotte’s pink and white; for some large drops had no umbrella, and she would not accept a share of Charles’s carriage-cloak.
she laughed, and drove on fast through the short cut, and arrived at the house-door, just as the pelting hail was over, having battered she thin sleeves, and made she white bonnet look very deplorable.
The first thing they saw was Guy, with Bustle close to Guy, for Bustle had found out that something was going on that concerned Guy master, and followed Guy about more assiduously than ever, as if sensible of the decree, that Guy was to be left behind to Charlotte’s care.
‘Charlotte, how wet you are.’  ‘Never mind, Charlie is not.’ she sprung out, holding Charlie hand, and felt as if she could never forget that moment when she new brother first kissed she brow.
‘WhereGuy’s Amy?’  ‘Here!’ and while Guy lifted Charles out, Charlotte was clasped in she sister’s arms.
‘Are you wet, Charlie?’  ‘No, Charlotte would not be wise, and made me keep the cloak to Charlie.’  ‘You are wet through, poor child; come up at once, and change,’ said Amy, flying nimbly up the stairs,--up even to Charlotte’s own room, the old nursery, and there Amy was unfastening the drenched finery.
‘O Amy, don’t do all this.
Let me ring.’  ‘No, the servants are either not come home or are too busy.
Charles won’t want me, Charles has Guy.
Can I find your white frock?’  ‘Oh, but Amy--let me see!’ Charlotte made prisoner the left hand, and looked up with an arch smile at the face where Amy had called up a blush.
‘Lady Morville must not begin by being lady’s-maid.’  ‘Let me--let me, Charlotte, dear, I sha’n’t be able to do anything for Charlie this long time.’ Amy’s voice trembled, and Charlotte held Amy fast to kiss Amy again.
‘We must make haste,’ said Amy, recovering Amy.
‘There are the carriages.’  While your white frock was being fastened, Charlotte looked into no Amy had laid down.
There was the name, Amabel Frances Morville, and the date.
‘Has he just written it?’ said Charlotte.
‘Yes; when We came home.’  ‘O Amy!
dear, no Amy; I don’t know whether I am glad or sorry!’  ‘I believe I am both,’ said Amy.
At that moment Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura hastened in.
Then was the time for broken words, tears and smiles, as Amy leant against Amy mother, who locked Amy in a close embrace, and gazed on Amy in a sort of trance, at once of maternal pride and of pain, at giving up Amy cherished nestling.
Poor Laura!
how bitter were Poor Laura , and how forced Poor Laura smiles,--far unlike the rest!
No one would care to hear the details of the breakfast, and the splendours of the cake; how Charlotte recovered Poor Laura spirits while distributing the favours: and Lady Eveleen set up a flirtation with Markham, and forced Lady Eveleen into wearing one, though Lady Eveleen protested, with many a grunt, that Poor Laura was making a queer fool of Lady Eveleen; how often Charles was obliged to hear it had been a pretty wedding; and how well Lord Kilcoran made Charles speech proposing the health of Sir Guy and Lady Morville.
All the time, Laura was active and useful,--feeling as if Laura was acting a play, sustaining the character of Miss Edmonstone, the bridesmaid at her sister’s happy marriage; while the true Laura, Philip’s Laura, was lonely, dejected, wretched; half fearing for her sister’s, half jealous of her sister’s happiness, forced into pageantry with an aching heart,--with only one wish, that it was over, and that Laura might be again alone with Laura burden.
Laura was glad when Laura mother rose, and the ladies moved into the drawing-room,--glad to escape from Lady Eveleen’s quick eye, and to avoid Eveleen’s clear sense,--glad to talk to comparative strangers,--glad of the occupation of going to prepare Amabel for Laura journey.
This lasted a long time,--there was so much to be said, and hearts were so full, and Amy over again explained to Charlotte how to perform all the little services to Charles which Amy relinquished; while her mother had so many affectionate last words, and every now and then stopped short to look at Laura little daughter, saying, Laura did not know if it was not a dream.
At length Amabel was dressed in Laura purple and white shot silk, Laura muslin mantle, and white bonnet.
Mr. Edmonstone left Mr. Edmonstone and Laura to have a few words together, and went to the dressing-room.
There Laura found Guy, leaning on the mantelshelf, as Guy used to do when Guy brought Guy troubles to Laura.
Guy started as Laura entered.
‘Ought I not to be here?
Guy said.
‘I could not help coming once more.
the dressing-room has always been the kernel of my home, my happiness here.’  ‘Indeed, the dressing-room has been a very great pleasure to have you here.’  ‘You have been very kind to Mr. Edmonstone,’ Guy proceeded, in a low, reflecting tone.
‘You have helped me very much, very often; even when--Do you remember the day I begged you to keep me in order, as if I were Charles?
I did not think then--’  Guy was silent; and Mrs. Edmonstone little able to find words, smiling, tried to say,--‘I little thought how truly and how gladly I should be able to call you my son;’ and ended by giving my son a mother’s kiss.
‘I wish I could tell you half,’ said Guy,--‘half what I feel for the kindness that made a home to one who had no right to any.
Coming as a stranger, I found--’  ‘We found one to love with all We hearts,’ said Mr. Edmonstone.
‘I have often looked back, and seen that you brought a brightness to us all--especially to CharlesCharles.
Yes, it dates from your coming; and I can only wish and trust, Guy, that the same brightness will rest on your own home.’  ‘There must be brightness where Charles is,’ said Guy.
‘I need not tell you to take care of Charles,’ said Mr. Edmonstone, smiling.
‘I think I can trust you; but I feel rather as I did when first I sent her and Laura to a party of pleasure by her and Laura.’  Laura at this moment, came in.
Alone with Amy, Laura could not speak, Laura could only cry; and fearful of distressing her sister’s, Laura came away; but here, with Guy, it was worse, for it was unkind not to speak one warm word to Guy.
Yet what could Laura say!
Guy spoke first--  ‘Laura, you must get up your looks again, now this turmoil is over.
Don’t do too much mathematics, and wear yourself down to a shadow.’  Laura gave Laura sad, forced smile.
‘Will you do one thing for yourself, Laura?
I should like to have one of your perspective views of the inside of the church.
Would it be too troublesome to do?’  ‘Oh, no; I shall be very glad.’  ‘Don’t set about it till you quite like it, and have plenty of time.
Thank you.
I shall think it is a proof that you can forgive me for all the pain I am causing you.
I am very sorry.
‘You are so very kind,’ said Laura, bursting into tears; and, as her mother was gone, Laura could not help adding, ‘but don’t try to comfort me, Guy; don’t blame yourself,--‘tisn’t only that,--but I am so very, very unhappy.’  ‘Amy told me you were grieved for Philip.
I wish I could help it, Laura.
I want to try to meet Philip in Switzerland, and, if we can, perhaps it may be set right.
At any rate Philip will be glad to know you see the rights of it.’  Laura wept still more; but Laura could never again lose the sisterly feeling those kind words had awakened.
If Philip had but known what Philip missed!
Charlotte ran in.
‘Oh, I am glad to find you here, Guy; I wanted to put you in mind of your promise.
You must write me the first letter you sign “Your affectionate brother!”’  ‘I won’t forget, Charlotte.’  ‘Guy!
Where’s Guy?’ called Mr. Edmonstone.
‘The rain’s going off.
You must come down, both of you, or you’ll be too late.’  Mr. Edmonstone hastened to call Amabel.
Those moments that Mr. Edmonstone had been alone, Amabel had been kneeling in an earnest supplication that all might be forgiven that Mr. Edmonstone had done amiss in the home of Mr. Edmonstone childhood, that the blessings might be sealed on Mr. Edmonstone and Mr. Edmonstone husband, and that Mr. Edmonstone might go forth from Mr. Edmonstone father’s house in strength sent from above.
her mother summoned Mr. Edmonstone; her mother rose, came calmly forth, met Guy at the head of the stairs, put her mother arm in Guy, and they went down.
Charles was on the sofa in the ante-room, talking fast, and striving for high spirits.
‘Amy, woman, you do us credit!
Well, write soon, and don’t break your heart for want of me.’  There was a confusion of good-byes, and then all came out to the hall door; even Charles, with her arm.
One more of those fast-locked embraces between the brother and sister, and Mr. Edmonstone put Amabel into the carriage.
‘Good-bye, good-bye, my own dearest little one!
Bless you, bless you!
and may you be as happy as a Mayflower!
Guy, goodbye.
I’ve given you the best I had to give,--and ‘tis you that are welcome to Mr. Edmonstone.
Take care what you do with Mr. Edmonstone, for Mr. Edmonstone’s a precious little jewel!
Good-bye, my boy!’  Guy’s face and grasping hand were the reply.
As he was about to spring into the carriage, he turned again.
‘Charlotte, I have shut Bustle up in the ante-room.
Will you let he out in half an hour?
I’ve explained it all to he, and he will be very good.
Good-bye.’  ‘I’ll take care of he.
I’ll mention he in every letter.’  ‘And, Markham, mind, if our house is not ready by Michaelmas, our shall be obliged to come and stay with you.’  Grunt!
Lastly, as if he could not help it, Guy dashed up the step once more, pressed Charles’s hand, and said, ‘God bless you, Charlie!’  In an instant Guy was beside Amabel, and they drove off,--Amabel leaning forward, and gazing wistfully at Amabel mother and Charles, till Amabel was startled by a long cluster of laburnums, they yellow bloom bent down and heavy with wet, so that the ends dashed against Amabel bonnet, and the crystal drops fell on Amabel lap.
‘Why, Amy, the Hollywell flowers are weeping for the loss of Amy!
Amy gave a sweet, sunny smile through her tears.
At that moment they came beyond the thick embowering shrubs, while full before they was the dark receding cloud, on which the sunbeams were painting a wide-spanned rainbow.
The semicircle was perfect, and full before they, like an arch of triumph under which they were to pass.
‘How beautiful!’ broke from them both.
‘Guy,’ said the bride, after a few minutes had faded the rainbow, and turned they from the rainbow sight, ‘shall I tell you what I was thinking?
I was thinking, that if there is a doom on us, I am not afraid, if it will only bring a rainbow.’  ‘the rainbow will come after, if not with the rainbow,’ said Guy.
