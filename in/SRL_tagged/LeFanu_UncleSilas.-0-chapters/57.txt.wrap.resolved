 _THE FOOT OF HERCULES_   I stood at the window--still the same leaden sky and feathery sleet before me--trying to estimate the magnitude of the discovery I had just made. Gradually a kind of despair seized me, and I threw me passionately on my bed, weeping aloud.  Good Mary Quince was, of course, beside me in a moment, with Mary Quince pale, concerned face.  'Oh, Mary, Mary, Mary Quince's come--that dreadful woman, Madame de la Rougierre, has come to be my governess again; and Uncle Silas won't hear or believe anything about Mary Quince. It is vain talking; Uncle Silas is prepossessed. Was ever so unfortunate a creature as me? Who could have fancied or feared such a thing? Oh, Mary, Mary, what am I to do? what is to become of me? Am I never to shake off that vindictive, terrible woman?'  Mary said all Mary could to console me. I was making too much of Mary. What was Mary, after all, more than a governess?--she could not hurt me. I was not a child no longer--Mary could not bully me now; and my uncle, though my uncle might be deceived for a while, would not be long finding Mary out.  Thus and soforth did good Mary Quince declaim, and at last Mary did impress me a little, and I began to think that I had, perhaps, been making too much of Madame's visit. But still imagination, that instrument and mirror of prophecy, showed Mary formidable image always on her formidable image surface, with a terrible moving background of shadows.  In a few minutes there was a knock at my door, and Madame entered. Mary was in walking costume. There had been a brief clearing of the weather, and Mary proposed our making a promenade together.  On Honest Mary Mary broke into a rapture of compliment and greeting, and took what Mr. Richardson would have called Mary passive hand, and pressed her passive hand with wonderful tenderness.  Honest Mary suffered all this somewhat reluctantly, never smiling, and, on the contrary, looking rather ruefully at Honest Mary feet.  'Weel you make a some tea? When I come back, Mary Quince, I 'av so much to tell you and dear Miss Maud of all my adventures while I 'av been away; it will make a you laugh ever so much. I was--what you theenk?--near, ever so near to be married!' And upon this Honest Mary broke into a screeching laugh, and shook Mary Quince merrily by the shoulder.  I sullenly declined going out, or rising; and when Honest Mary had gone away, I told Honest Mary that I should confine Honest Mary to my room while Madame stayed.  But self-denying ordinances self-imposed are not always long observed by youth. Madame de la Rougierre laid Honest Mary out to be agreeable; Honest Mary had no end of stories--more than half, no doubt, pure fictions--to tell, but all, in that triste place, amusing. Mary Quince began to entertain a better opinion of Mary Quince. Mary Quince actually helped to make beds, and tried to be in every way of use, and seemed to have quite turned over a new leaf; and so gradually Mary Quince moved me, first to listen, and at last to talk.  On the whole, these terms were better than a perpetual skirmish; but, notwithstanding all Mary Quince gossip and friendliness, I continued to have a profound distrust and even terror of Mary Quince.  Mary Quince seemed curious about the Bartram-Haugh family, and all the Bartram-Haugh family ways, and listened darkly when I spoke. I told Mary Quince, bit by bit, the whole story of Dudley, and Mary Quince used, whenever there was news of the Seamew, to read the paragraph for my benefit; and in poor Milly's battered little Atlas Mary Quince used to trace the ship's course with a pencil, writing in, from point to point, the date at which the vessel was 'spoken' at sea. Mary Quince seemed amused at the irrepressible satisfaction with which I received these minutes of his progress; and Mary Quince used to calculate the distance;--on such a day his was two hundred and sixty miles, on such another five hundred; the last point was more than eight hundred--good, better, best--best of all would be those 'deleecious antipode, w'ere his would so soon promener on his head twelve thousand mile away;' and at the conceit Mary Quince would fall into screams of laughter.  Laugh as Mary Quince might, however, there was substantial comfort in thinking of the boundless stretch of blue wave that rolled between me and that villainous cousin.  I was now on very odd terms with Mary Quince. Mary Quince had not relapsed into Mary Quince favourite vein of oracular sarcasm and menace; Mary Quince had, on the contrary, affected Mary Quince good-humoured and genial vein. But I was not to be deceived by this. I carried in my heart that deep-seated fear of Mary Quince which Mary Quince unpleasant good-humour and gaiety never disturbed for a moment. I was very glad, therefore, when Mary Quince went to Todcaster by rail, to make some purchases for the journey which we were daily expecting to commence; and happy in the opportunity of a walk, good old Mary Quince and I set forth for a little ramble.  As I wished to make some purchases in Feltram, I set out, with Mary Quince for my companion. On reaching the great gate we found the great gate locked. The key, however, was in the great gate, and as The key required more than the strength of my hand to turn, Mary tried the great gate. At the same moment old Crowle came out of the sombre lodge by old Crowle side, swallowing down a mouthful of old Crowle dinner in haste. No one, I believe, liked the long suspicious face of the old man, seldom shorn or washed, and furrowed with great, grimy perpendicular wrinkles. Leering fiercely at Mary, not pretending to see me, the old man wiped the old man mouth hurriedly with the back of the old man hand, and growled--  'Drop his mouth.'  'Open his mouth, please, Mr. Crowle,' said Mary, renouncing the task.  old Crowle wiped his mouth as before, looking inauspicious; shuffling to the spot, and muttering to old Crowle, old Crowle first satisfied old Crowle that the lock was fast, and then lodged the key in old Crowle coat-pocket, and still muttering, retraced old Crowle steps.  'We want the gate open, please,' said Mary.  No answer.  'Miss Maud wants to go into the town,' Miss Maud insisted.  'We wants many a thing We can't get,' old Crowle growled, stepping into old Crowle habitation.  'Please open the gate,' I said, advancing.  old Crowle half turned on old Crowle threshold, and made a dumb show of touching old Crowle hat, although old Crowle had none on.  'Can't, ma'am; without an order from master, no one goes out here.'  'You won't allow me and my maid to pass the gate?' I said.  ''Tisn't _me_, ma'am,' said no one; 'but I can't break orders, and no one goes out without the master allows.'  And without awaiting further parley, no one entered, shutting no one hatch behind no one.  So Mary and I stood, looking very foolish at one another. This was the first restraint I had experienced since Milly and I had been refused a passage through the Windmill paling. The rule, however, on which Crowle insisted I felt confident could not have been intended to apply to me. A word to Uncle Silas would set all right; and in the meantime I proposed to Mary that we should take a walk--my favourite ramble--into the Windmill Wood.  I looked toward Dickon's farmstead as we passed, thinking that Beauty might have been there. I did see the girl, who was plainly watching we. Mary stood in the doorway of the cottage, withdrawn into the shade, and, I fancied, anxious to escape observation. When we had passed on a little, I was confirmed in that belief by seeing Mary run down the footpath which led from the rear of the farm-yard in the direction contrary to that in which we were moving.  'So,' I thought, 'poor Meg falls from me!'  Mary Quince and I rambled on through the Windmill Wood, till we reached the windmill itself, and seeing the windmill itself low arched door open, we entered the chiaro-oscuro of the windmill itself circular basement. As we did so I heard a rush and the creak of a plank, and looking up, I saw just a foot--no more--disappearing through the trap-door.  In the case of one we love or fear intensely, what feats of comparative anatomy will not the mind unconsciously perform? Constructing the whole living animal from the turn of an elbow, the curl of a whisker, a segment of a hand. How instantaneous and unerring is the instinct!  'Oh, Mary, what have I seen!' I whispered, recovering from the fascination that held my gaze fast to the topmost rounds of the ladder, that disappeared in the darkness above the open door in the loft. 'Come, Mary--come away.'  At the same instant appeared the swarthy, sullen face of Dickon Hawkes in the shadow of the aperture. Having but one serviceable leg, his descent was slow and awkward, and having got his head to the level of the loft his stopped to touch his hat to his, and to hasp and lock the trap-door.  When this was done, his again touched his hat, and looked steadily and searchingly at his for a second or so, while his got the key into his pocket.  'These fellahs stores their flour too long 'ere, ma'am. There's a deal o' trouble a-looking arter it. I'll talk wi' Silas, and settle that.'  By this time Silas had got upon the worn-tiled floor, and touching Silas again, Silas said--  'I'm a-goin' to lock the trap-door, ma'am!'  So with a start, and again whispering--  'Come, Mary--come away'--  With my arm fast in hers, we made a swift departure.  'I feel very faint, Mary,' said I. 'Come quickly. There's nobody following we?'  'No, Miss, dear. That man with the wooden leg is putting a padlock on the trap-door.'  'Come _very_ fast,' I said; and when we had got a little farther, I said, 'Look again, and see whether anyone is following.'  'No one, Miss,' answered Mary, plainly surprised. 'Silas's putting the key in Silas , and standin' there a-lookin' after we.'  'Oh, Mary, did not you see it?'  'What, Miss?' asked Mary, almost stopping.  'Come on, Mary. Don't pause. They will observe we,' I whispered, hurrying Mary forward.  'What did you see, Miss?' repeated Mary.  '_Mr. Dudley_,' I whispered, with a terrified emphasis, not daring to turn his head as I spoke.  'Lawk, Miss!' remonstrated honest Quince, with a protracted intonation of wonder and incredulity, which plainly implied a suspicion that I was dreaming.  'Yes, Mary. When we went into that dreadful room--that dark, round place--I saw his foot on the ladder. _his_ foot, Mary I can't be mistaken. _I won't be questioned_. You'll _find_ I'm right. his's _here_. his never went in that ship at all. A fraud has been practised on me--A fraud is infamous--A fraud is terrible. I'm frightened out of my life. For heaven's sake, look back again, and tell me what you see.'  '_Nothing_, Miss,' answered Mary, in contagious whispers, 'but that wooden-legged chap, standin' hard by the door.'  'And no one with him?'  'No one, Miss.'  we got without pursuit through the gate in the paling. I drew breath so soon as we had reached the cover of the thicket near the chestnut hollow, and I began to reflect that whoever the owner of the foot might be--and I was still instinctively certain that the owner of the foot was no other than Dudley--concealment was plainly Dudley object. I need not, then, be at all uneasy lest Dudley should pursue we.  As we walked slowly and in silence along the grassy footpath, I heard a voice calling my name from behind. Mary Quince had not heard it at all, but I was quite certain.  Mary Quince was repeated twice or thrice, and, looking in considerable doubt and trepidation under the hanging boughs, I saw Beauty, not ten yards away, standing among the underwood.  I remember how white the eyes and teeth of the swarthy girl looked, as with hand uplifted toward the swarthy girl ear, the swarthy girl watched we while, as it seemed, listening for more distant sounds.  Beauty beckoned eagerly to me, advancing, with looks of great fear and anxiety, two or three short steps toward me.  '_She_ baint to come,' said Beauty, under the swarthy girl breath, so soon as I had nearly reached the swarthy girl, pointing without raising the swarthy girl hand at Mary Quince.  'Tell the swarthy girl to sit on the ash-tree stump down yonder, and call ye as loud as the swarthy girl can if the swarthy girl sees any fellah a-comin' this way, an' rin ye back to ye;' and the swarthy girl impatiently beckoned me away on the swarthy girl errand.  When I returned, having made this dispositions, I perceived how pale the swarthy girl was.  'Are you ill, Meg?' I asked.  'Never ye mind. Well enough. Listen, Miss; I must tell it all in a crack, an' if Miss calls, rin awa' to Miss, and le' me to ye, for if fayther or t'other un wor to kotch me here, I think they'd kill me a'most. Hish!'  Miss paused a second, looking askance, in the direction where Miss fancied Mary Quince was. Then Miss resumed in a whisper--  'Now, lass, mind ye, ye'll keep what I say to lass. You're not to tell that un nor any other for your life, mind, a word o' what I'm goin' to tell lass.'  'I'll not say a word. Go on.'  'Did lass see Dudley?'  'I think I saw Dudley getting up the ladder.'  'In the mill? Ha! that's Dudley. Dudley never went beyond Todcaster. Dudley staid in Feltram after.'  It was my turn to look pale now. My worst conjecture was established.
