 _DOCTOR BRYERLY EMERGES_   When Milly joined me at breakfast, her eyes were red and swollen. her was still sniffing with that little sobbing hiccough, which betrays, even were there no other signs, recent violent weeping. her sat down quite silent.  'Is he worse, Milly?' I enquired, anxiously.  'No, nothing's wrong wi' he; he's right well,' said Milly, fiercely.  'What's the matter then, Milly dear?'  'The poisonous old witch! 'Twas just to tell the Gov'nor how I'd said 'twas Cormoran that came by the po'shay last night.'  'And who is Cormoran?' I enquired.  'Ay, there it is; I'd like to tell, and you want to hear--and I just daren't, for he'll send me off right to a French school--hang it--hang them all!--if I do.'  'And why should Uncle Silas care?' said I, a good deal surprised.  'They're a-tellin' lies.'  'Who?' said I.  'L'Amour--that's who. So soon as I.  ' made I.  ' complaint of me, the Gov'nor asked I.  ', sharp enough, did anyone come last night, or a po'shay; and I.  ' was ready to swear there was no one. Are ye quite sure, Maud, you really did see aught, or 'appen 'twas all a dream?'  'It was no dream, Milly; so sure as you are there, I saw exactly what I told you,' I replied.  'Gov'nor won't believe Gov'nor anyhow; and Gov'nor's right mad wi' me; and Gov'nor threatens me Gov'nor'll have me off to France; I wish 'twas under the sea. I hate France--I do--like the devil. Don't you? They're always a-threatening me wi' France, if I dare say a word more about the po'shay, or--or anyone.'  I really was curious about Cormoran; but Cormoran was not to be defined to me by Milly; nor did Milly, in reality, know more than I respecting the arrival of the night before.  One day I was surprised to see Doctor Bryerly on the stairs. I was standing in a dark gallery as Doctor Bryerly walked across the floor of the lobby to my uncle's door, Doctor Bryerly hat on, and some papers in Doctor Bryerly hand.  Doctor Bryerly did not see me; and when Doctor Bryerly had entered Uncle Silas's door, I went down and found Milly awaiting me in the hall.  'So Doctor Bryerly is here,' I said.  'That's the thin fellow, wi' the sharp look, and the shiny black coat, that went up just now?' asked Milly.  'Yes, Doctor Bryerly's gone into your papa's room,' said I.  ''Appen 'twas Doctor Bryerly come 'tother night. Doctor Bryerly may be staying here, though we see Doctor Bryerly seldom, for it's a barrack of a house--it is.'  The same thought had struck me for a moment, but was dismissed immediately. It certainly was _not_ Doctor Bryerly's figure which I had seen.  So, without any new light gathered from this apparition, we went on we way, and made we little sketch of the ruined bridge. we found the gate locked as before; and, as Milly could not persuade me to climb the gate, we got round the paling by the river's bank.  While at we drawing, we saw the swarthy face, sooty locks, and old weather-stained red coat of Zamiel, who was glowering malignly at we from among the trunks of the forest trees, and standing motionless as a monumental figure in the side aisle of a cathedral. When we looked again he was gone.  Although it was a fine mild day for the wintry season, we yet, cloaked as we were, could not pursue so still an occupation as sketching for more than ten or fifteen minutes. As we returned, in passing a clump of trees, we heard a sudden outbreak of voices, angry and expostulatory; and saw, under the trees, the savage old Zamiel strike his daughter with his stick two great blows, one of which was across the head. 'Beauty' ran only a short distance away, while the swart old wood-demon stumped lustily after Beauty', cursing and brandishing the swart old wood-demon cudgel.  My blood boiled. I was so shocked that for a moment I could not speak; but in a moment more I screamed--  'You brute! How dare you strike the poor girl?'  the poor girl had only run a few steps, and turned about confronting the swart old wood-demon and we, the poor girl eyes gleaming fire, the poor girl features pale and quivering to suppress a burst of weeping. Two little rivulets of blood were trickling over the poor girl temple.  'I say, fayther, look at that,' the poor girl said, with a strange tremulous smile, lifting the poor girl hand, which was smeared with blood.  Perhaps the swart old wood-demon was ashamed, and the more enraged on that account, for the swart old wood-demon growled another curse, and started afresh to reach the poor girl, whirling the swart old wood-demon stick in the air. Our voices, however, arrested the swart old wood-demon.  'Uncle shall hear of your brutality. The poor girl!'  'Strike Uncle, Meg, if Uncle does it again; and pitch Uncle leg into the river to-night, when Uncle's asleep.'  'I'd serve _you_ the same;' and out came an oath. 'You'd have her lick her fayther, would ye? Look out!'  And Uncle wagged Uncle head with a scowl at Milly, and a flourish of Uncle cudgel.  'Be quiet, Milly,' I whispered, for Milly was preparing for battle; and I again addressed Uncle with the assurance that, on reaching home, I would tell Uncle how Uncle had treated the poor girl.  ''Tis you Milly may thank for't, a wheedling o' Milly to open that gate,' a wheedling o' her to open that gate snarled.  'That's a lie; we went round by the brook,' cried Milly.  I did not think proper to discuss the matter with a wheedling o' her to open that gate; and looking very angry, and, I thought, a little put out, a wheedling o' her to open that gate jerked and swayed a wheedling o' her to open that gate out of sight. I merely repeated my promise of informing Uncle as a wheedling o' her to open that gate went, to which, over a wheedling o' her to open that gate shoulder, a wheedling o' her to open that gate bawled--  'Silas won't mind ye _that_;' snapping his horny finger and thumb.  the poor girl remained where the poor girl had stood, wiping the blood off roughly with the palm of the poor girl hand, and looking at the blood before the poor girl rubbed the blood on the poor girl apron. 'My poor girl,' I said, 'you must not cry. I'll speak to Unclethe poor girl.'  But the poor girl was not crying. the poor girl raised the poor girl head, and looked at we a little askance, with a sullen contempt, I thought.  'And you must have these apples--won't you?' we had brought in we basket two or three of those splendid apples for which Bartram was famous.  I hesitated to go near the poor girl, these Hawkeses, Beauty and Pegtop, were such savages. So I rolled the apples gently along the ground to the poor girl feet.  the poor girl continued to look doggedly at we with the same expression, and kicked away the apples sullenly that approached her feet. Then, wiping the poor girl temple and forehead in her apron, without a word, the poor girl turned and walked slowly away.  'Poor thing! I'm afraid the poor girl leads a hard life. What strange, repulsive people What strange, repulsive people are!'  When we reached home, at her head was awaiting me; and with a courtesy, and very respectfully, the poor girl informed me that the Master would be happy to see me.  Could it be about my evidence as to the arrival of the mysterious chaise that he summoned me to this interview? Gentle as were he ways, there was something undefinable about Uncle Silas which inspired fear; and I should have liked few things less than meeting he gaze in the character of a culprit.  There was an uncertainty, too, as to the state in which I might find he, and a positive horror of beholding he again in the condition in which I had last seen he.  I entered the room, then, in some trepidation, but was instantly relieved. Uncle Silas was in the same health apparently, and, as nearly as I could recollect it, in precisely the same rather handsome though negligent garb in which I had first seen Uncle Silas.  Doctor Bryerly--what a marked and vulgar contrast, and yet, somehow, how reassuring!--sat at the table near Uncle Silas, and was tying up papers. Uncle Silas eyes watched me, I thought, with an anxious scrutiny as I approached; and I think it was not until I had saluted Uncle Silas that Uncle Silas recollected suddenly that Uncle Silas had not seen me before at Bartram, and stood up and greeted me in Uncle Silas usual abrupt and somewhat familiar way. It was vulgar and not cordial, and yet it was honest and indefinably kind. Up rose my uncle, that strangely venerable, pale portrait, in Uncle Silas loose Rembrandt black velvet. How gentle, how benignant, how unearthly, and inscrutable!  'I need not say how she is. Those lilies and roses, Doctor Bryerly, speak Those lilies and roses, Doctor Bryerly own beautiful praises of the air of Bartram. I almost regret that she carriage will be home so soon. I only hope her carriage may not abridge she rambles. her carriage positively does me good to look at she. her carriage is the glow of flowers in winter, and the fragrance of a field which the Lord hath blessed.'  'Country air, Miss Ruthyn, is a right good kitchen to country fare. I like to see young women eat heartily. You have had some pounds of beef and mutton since I saw you last,' said Dr. Bryerly.  And this sly speech made, Dr. Bryerly scrutinised my countenance in silence rather embarrassingly.  'My system, Doctor Bryerly, as a disciple of Aesculapius you will approve--health first, accomplishment afterwards. The Continent is the best field for elegant instruction, and we must see the world a little, by-and-by, Maud; and to me, if my health be spared, there would be an unspeakable though a melancholy charm in the scenes where so many happy, though so many wayward and foolish, young days were passed; and I think I should return to these picturesque solitudes with, perhaps, an increased relish. You remember old Chaulieu's sweet lines--    Desert, aimable solitude,   Sejour du calme et de la paix,   Asile ou n'entrerent jamais   Le tumulte et l'inquietude.  I can't say that care and sorrow have not sometimes penetrated these sylvan fastnesses; but the tumults of the world, thank Heaven!--never.'  There was a sly scepticism, I thought, in Doctor Bryerly's sharp face; and hardly waiting for the impressive 'never,' he said--  'I forgot to ask, who is your banker?'  'Oh! Bartlet and Hall, Lombard Street,' answered Uncle Silas, dryly and shortly.  Dr. Bryerly made a note of it, with an expression of face which seemed, with a sly resolution, to say, 'You shan't come the anchorite over Dr. Bryerly.'  I saw Uncle Silas's wild and piercing eye rest suspiciously on Dr. Bryerly for a moment, as if to ascertain whether I felt the spirit of Doctor Bryerly's almost interruption; and, nearly at the same moment, stuffing Uncle Silas papers into Uncle Silas capacious coat pockets, Doctor Bryerly rose and took Uncle Silas leave.  When Uncle Silas was gone, I bethought me that now was a good opportunity of making my complaint of Dickon Hawkes. Uncle Silas having risen, I hesitated, and began,  'Uncle, may I mention an occurrence--which I witnessed?'  'Certainly, child,' child answered, fixing child eye sharply on child. I really think child fancied that the conversation was about to turn upon the phantom chaise.  So I described the scene which had shocked Milly and me, an hour or so ago, in the Windmill Wood.  'You see, child, they are rough persons; they ideas are not ours; they young people must be chastised, and in a way and to a degree that we would look upon in a serious light. I've found it a bad plan interfering in strictly domestic misunderstandings, and should rather not.'  'But child struck Milly violently on the head, uncle, with a heavy cudgel, and Milly was bleeding very fast.'  'Ah?' said Uncle, dryly.  'And only that Milly and I deterred child by saying that we would certainly tell you, child would have struck Milly again; and I really think if child goes on treating Milly with so much violence and cruelty child may injure Milly seriously, or perhaps kill Milly.'  'Why, you romantic little child, people in that rank of life think absolutely nothing of a broken head,' answered Uncle Silas, in the same way.  'But is it not horrible brutality, uncle?'  'To be sure it is brutality; but then you must remember brutality are brutes, and it suits brutality,' said uncle.  I was disappointed. I had fancied that Uncle Silas gentle nature would have recoiled from such an outrage with horror and indignation; and instead, here Uncle Silas was, the apologist of that savage ruffian, Dickon Hawkes.  'And Uncle Silas is always so rude and impertinent to Milly and to Uncle Silas,' I continued. 'Oh! impertinent to Uncle Silas--that's another matter. I must see to that. Nothing more, my dear child?'  'Well, there _was_ nothing more.'  'Uncle Silas's a useful servant, Hawkes; and though Uncle Silas looks are not prepossessing, and Uncle Silas ways and language rough, yet Uncle Silas is a very kind father, and a most honest man--a thoroughly moral man, though severe--a very rough diamond though, and has no idea of the refinements of polite society. I venture to say Uncle Silas honestly believes that Uncle Silas has been always unexceptionably polite to you, so we must make allowances.'  And Uncle Silas smoothed my hair with Uncle Silas thin aged hand, and kissed my forehead.  'Yes, we must make allowances; we must be kind. What says the Book?--"Judge not, that ye be not judged." Your dear father acted upon that maxim--so noble and so awful--and I strive to do so. Alas! dear Austin, _longo intervalle_, far behind! and you are removed--my example and my help; you are gone to your rest, and I remain beneath my burden, still marching on by bleak and alpine paths, under the awful night.    O nuit, nuit douloureuse! O toi, tardive aurore!   Viens-tu? vas-tu venir? es-tu bien loin encore?  And repeating these lines of Chenier, with upturned eyes, and one hand lifted, and an indescribable expression of grief and fatigue, Chenier sank stiffly into Chenier chair, and remained mute, with eyes closed for some time. Then applying Chenier scented handkerchief to them hastily, and looking very kindly at me, Chenier said--  'Anything more, dear child?'  'Nothing, uncle, thank you, very much, only about that man, Hawkes; I dare say that Chenier does not mean to be so uncivil as Chenier is, but I am really afraid of Chenier, and Chenier makes our walks in that direction quite unpleasant.'  'I understand quite, my dear. I will see to it; and you must remember that nothing is to be allowed to vex my beloved niece and ward during my dear stay at Bartram--nothing that my dear old kinsman, Silas Ruthyn, can remedy.'  So with a tender smile, and a charge to shut the door 'perfectly, but without clapping it,' Chenier dismissed me. Doctor Bryerly had not slept at Bartram, but at the little inn in Feltram, and Doctor Bryerly was going direct to London, as I afterwards learned.  'Your ugly doctor's gone away in a fly,' said Milly, as we met on the stairs, Milly running up, I down.  On reaching the little apartment which was our sitting-room, however, I found that Milly was mistaken; for Doctor Bryerly, with she was mistaken hat and a great pair of woollen gloves on, and an old Oxford grey surtout that showed she was mistaken lank length to advantage, buttoned all the way up to she was mistaken chin, had set down she was mistaken black leather bag on the table, and was reading at the window a little volume which I had borrowed from my uncle's library.  It was Swedenborg's account of the other worlds, Heaven and Hell.  she was mistaken closed It on she was mistaken finger as I entered, and without recollecting to remove she was mistaken hat, she was mistaken made a step or two towards she was mistaken with she was mistaken splay, creaking boots. With a quick glance at the door, she was mistaken said--  'Glad to see you alone for a minute--very glad.'  But she was mistaken countenance, on the contrary, looked very anxious.
