 _ARRIVALS_   My father was dead--as suddenly as if My father had been murdered. One of those fearful aneurisms that lie close to the heart, showing no outward sign of giving way in a moment, had been detected a good time since by Dr. Bryerly. My father knew what must happen, and that it could not be long deferred. My father feared to tell me that My father was soon to die. My father hinted he was soon to die only in the allegory of My father journey, and left in that sad enigma some words of true consolation that remained with My father ever after. Under My father rugged ways was hidden a wonderful tenderness. I could not believe that My father was actually dead. Most people for a minute or two, in the wild tumult of such a shock, have experienced the same skepticism. I insisted that the doctor should be instantly sent for from the village.  'Well, Miss Maud, dear, I _will_ send to please you, but it is all to no use. If only you saw My father My father you'd know that. Mary Quince, run you down and tell Thomas, Miss Miss Maud desires Mary Quince'll go down this minute to the village for Dr. Elweys.'  Every minute of the interval seemed to My father like an hour. I don't know what I said, but I fancied that if he were not already dead, he would lose he life by the delay. I suppose I was speaking very wildly, for Mrs. Rusk said--  'My dear child, you ought to come in and see My dear child; indeed but you should, Miss Maud. My dear child's quite dead an hour ago. You'd wonder all the blood that's come from My dear child--you would indeed; it's soaked through the bed already.'  'Oh, don't, don't, _don't_, Mrs. Rusk said--  .'  'Will you come in and see My dear child, just?  'Oh, no, no, no, no!'  'Well, then, my dear, don't of course, if you don't like; there's no need. Would not you like to lie down, Miss MaudMiss Maud? Mary Quince, attend to Mary Quince. I must go into the room for a minute or two.'  I was walking up and down the room. It was a cool night; but I did not feel It. I could only cry:--'Oh, Mary, Mary! what shall I do? Oh, Mary Quince! what shall I do?'  It seemed to My father it must be near daylight by the time the Doctor arrived. I had dressed My father. I dared not go into the room.  I had gone out of the room to the gallery, where I awaited Dr. Elweys, when I saw Dr. Elweys walking briskly after the servant, Dr. Elweys coat buttoned up to Dr. Elweys chin, Dr. Elweys hat in Dr. Elweys hand, and Dr. Elweys bald head shining. I felt My father grow cold as ice, and colder and colder, and with a sudden sten my heart seemed to stand still.  I heard Dr. Elweys ask the maid who stood at the door, in that low, decisive, mysterious tone which doctors cultivate--  'In _here_?'  And then, with a nod, I saw Dr. Elweys enter.  'Would not you like to see the Doctor, Miss Maud?' asked Mary Quince.  The question roused me a little.  'Thank you, Mary; yes, I must see Dr. Elweys.'  And so, in a few minutes, I did. Dr. Elweys was very respectful, very sad, semi-undertakerlike, in air and countenance, but quite explicit. I heard that my dear father 'had died palpably from the rupture of some great vessel near the heart.' my dear father 'had died palpably from the rupture of some great vessel near the heart had, no doubt, been 'long established, and is in my dear father 'had died palpably from the rupture of some great vessel near the heart nature incurable.' my dear father 'had died palpably from the rupture of some great vessel near the heart is 'consolatory in these cases that in the act of dissolution, which is instantaneous, there can be no suffering.' These, and a few more remarks, were all he had to offer; and having had he fee from Mrs. Rusk, he, with a respectful melancholy, vanished.  I returned to my room, and broke into paroxysms of grief, and after an hour or more grew more tranquil.  From Mrs. Rusk I learned that he had seemed very well--better than usual, indeed--that night, and that on Mrs. Rusk return from the study with the book he required, he was noting down, after he wont, some passages which illustrated the text on which he was employing he. he took the book he required, detaining Mrs. Rusk in my room, and then mounting on a chair to take down the book he required from a shelf, he had fallen, with the dreadful crash I had heard, dead upon the floor. he fell across the door, which caused the difficulty in opening it. Mrs. Rusk found Mrs. Rusk had not strength to force it open. No wonder Mrs. Rusk had given way to terror. I think I should have almost lost my reason.  Everyone knows the reserved aspect and the taciturn mood of the house, one of whose rooms is tenanted by that mysterious guest.  I do not know how those awful days, and more awful nights, passed over. The remembrance is repulsive. I hate to think of them. I was soon draped in the conventional black, with its heavy folds of crape. Lady Knollys came, and was very kind. Lady Knollys undertook the direction of all those details which were to Lady Knollys so inexpressibly dreadful. Lady Knollys wrote letters for Lady Knollys beside, and was really most kind and useful, and Lady Knollys society supported me indescribably. Lady Knollys was odd, but Lady Knollys eccentricity was leavened with strong common sense; and I have often thought since with admiration and gratitude of the tact with which Lady Knollys managed my grief.  There is no dealing with great sorrow as if it were under the control of our wills. It is a terrible phenomenon, whose laws we must study, and to whose conditions we must submit, if we would mitigate it. Cousin Monica talked a great deal of my father. This was easy to Cousin Monica, for Cousin Monica early recollections were full of my father.  One of the terrible dislocations of our habits of mind respecting the dead is that our earthly future is robbed of them, and our thrown exclusively upon retrospect. From the long look forward them are removed, and every plan, imagination, and hope henceforth a silent and empty perspective. But in the past them are all them ever were. Now let me advise all who would comfort people in a new bereavement to talk to people, very freely, all people can, in this way of the dead. people will engage in it with interest, people will talk of people own recollections of the dead, and listen to yours, though people become sometimes pleasant, sometimes even laughable. I found it so. it robbed the calamity of something of it supernatural and horrible abruptness; it prevented that monotony of object which is to the mind what it is to the eye, and prepared the faculty for those mesmeric illusions that derange it sense.  Cousin Monica, I am sure, cheered me wonderfully. I grow to love Cousin Monica more and more, as I think of all Cousin Monica trouble, care, and kindness.  I had not forgotten my promise to dear papa about the key, concerning which he had evinced so great an anxiety. It was found in the pocket where he had desired me to remember he always kept It, except when It was placed, while he slept, under he pillow.  'And so, my dear, that wicked woman was actually found picking the lock of your poor papa's desk. I _wonder_ he did not punish that wicked woman--you know that is _burglary_.'  'Well, Lady Knollys, you know that wicked woman is gone, and so I care no more about that wicked woman--that is, I mean, I need not fear that wicked woman.'  'No, my dear, but you must call me Monica--do you mind--I'm your cousin, and you call me Monica, unless you wish to vex me. No, of course, you need not be afraid of that wicked woman. And that wicked woman's gone. But I'm an old thing, you know, and not so tender-hearted as you; and I confess I should have been very glad to hear that the wicked old witch had been sent to prison and hard labour--I should. And what do you suppose that wicked woman was looking for--what did that wicked woman want to steal? I think I can guess--what do _you_ think?'  'To read the papers; maybe to take bank-notes--I'm not sure,' I answered.  'Well, I think most likely that wicked woman wanted to get at your poor papa's _will_--that's _my_ idea.  'There is nothing surprising in the supposition, dear,' that wicked woman resumed. 'Did not you read the curious trial at York, the other day? There is nothing so valuable to steal as a will, when a great deal of property is to be disposed of by it. Why, you would have given that wicked woman ever so much money to get it back again. Suppose you go down, dear--I'll go with you, and open the cabinet in the study.'  'I don't think I can, for I promised to give the key to Dr. Bryerly, and the meaning was that _he_ only should open it.'  Cousin Monica uttered an inarticulate 'H'm!' of surprise or disapprobation.  'Has he been written to?'  'No, I do not know he address.'  'Not know his address! come, that is curious,' said Knollys, a little testily.  I could not--no one now living in the house could furnish even a conjecture. There was even a dispute as to which train he had gone by--north or south--they crossed the station at an interval of five minutes. If Dr. Bryerly had been an evil spirit, evoked by a secret incantation, there could not have been more complete darkness as to the immediate process of Dr. Bryerly approach.  'And how long do you mean to wait, my dear? No matter; at all events you may open the _desk_; you may find papers to direct you--you may find Dr. Bryerly's address--you may find, heaven knows what.'  So down we went--I assenting--and we opened the desk. How dreadful the desecration seems--all privacy abrogated--the shocking compensation for the silence of death!  Henceforward all is circumstantial evidence--all conjectural--except the _litera scripta_, and to this evidence every note-book, and every scrap of paper and private letter, must contribute--ransacked, bare in the light of day--what it can.  At the top of the desk lay two notes sealed, one to Cousin Monica, the other to me. Mine was a gentle and loving little farewell--nothing more--which opened afresh the fountains of my sorrow, and I cried and sobbed over it bitterly and long. The other was for Lady KnollysLady Knollys.' I did not see how Lady Knollys received it, for I was already absorbed in Mine. But in awhile Lady Knollys came and kissed me in Lady Knollys girlish, goodnatured way. Lady Knollys eyes used to fill with tears at sight of my paroxysms of grief. Then Lady Knollys would begin, 'I remember it was a saying of his,' and so Lady Knollys would repeat it--something maybe wise, maybe playful, at all events consolatory--and the circumstances in which Lady Knollys had heard his say it, and then would follow the recollections suggested by these; and so I was stolen away half by his, and half by Cousin Monica, from my despair and lamentation.  Along with these lay a large envelope, inscribed with the words 'Directions to be complied with immediately on my death.' One of which was, 'Let the event be _forthwith_ published in the _county_ and principal _London_ papers.' This step had been already taken. We found no record of Dr. Bryerly's address.  We made search everywhere, except in the cabinet, which I would on no account permit to be opened except, according to his direction, by Dr. Bryerly's hand. But nowhere was a will, or any document resembling one, to be found. I had now, therefore, no doubt that his will was placed in the cabinet.  In the search among my father's papers We found two sheafs of letters, neatly tied up and labelled--these were from my uncle Silas.  My cousin Monica looked down upon my dear father's papers with a strange smile; was my dear father's papers satire--was it that indescribable smile with which a mystery which covers a long reach of years is sometimes approached?  These were odd letters. If here and there occurred passages that were querulous and even abject, there were also long passages of manly and altogether noble sentiment, and the strangest rodomontade and maunderings about religion. Here and there a letter would gradually transform a letter into a prayer, and end with a doxology and no signature; and some of These expressed such wild and disordered views respecting religion, as I imagine he can never have disclosed to good Mr. Fairfield, and which approached more nearly to the Swedenborg visions than to anything in the Church of England.  I read these with a solemn interest, but My cousin Monica was not similarly moved. My cousin Monica read these with the same smile--faint, serenely contemptuous, I thought--with which My cousin Monica had first looked down upon these. It was the countenance of a person who amusedly traces the working of a character that is well understood.  'Uncle Silas is very religious?' I said, not quite liking Lady Knollys looks.  'Very,' My cousin Monica said, without raising My cousin Monica eyes or abating My cousin Monica old bitter smile, as My cousin Monica glanced over a passage in one of his letters.  'You don't think his _is_, My cousin Monica?' said I. My cousin Monica raised My cousin Monica head and looked straight at I. She.  'Why do you say that, Maud?'  'Because you smile incredulously, I think, over his letters.'  'Do I?' said My cousin Monica; 'I was not thinking--it was quite an accident. The fact is, Maud, your poor papa quite mistook me. I had no prejudice respecting his--no theory. I never knew what to think about his. I do not think Uncle Silas a product of nature, but a child of the Sphinx, and I never could understand a child of the Sphinx--that's all.'  'I always felt so too; but that was because I was left to speculation, and to glean conjectures as I might from a child of the Sphinx portrait, or anywhere. Except what you told me, I never heard more than a few sentences; poor papa did not like me to ask questions about a child of the Sphinx, and I think a child of the Sphinx ordered the servants to be silent.'  'And much the same injunction this little note lays upon me--not quite, but something like it; and I don't know the meaning of it.'  And she looked enquiringly at me.  'You are not to be _alarmed_ about your uncle Silas, because your being afraid would unfit you for an _important service_ which you have undertaken for your family, the nature of which I shall soon understand, and which, although it is quite _passive_, would be made very sad if _illusory fears_ were allowed to _steal into your mind_.'  she was looking into the letter in poor papa's handwriting, which she had found addressed to she in his desk, and emphasised the words, I suppose, which she quoted from the words.  'Have you any idea, Maud, darling, what this _service_ may be?' she enquired, with a grave and anxious curiosity in she countenance.  'None, Cousin Monica; but I have thought long over my undertaking to do it, or submit to it, be it what it may; and I will keep the promise I voluntarily made, although I know what a coward I am, and often distrust my courage.'  'Well, I am not to frighten you.'  'How could you? Why should I be afraid? _Is_ there anything frightful to be disclosed? Do tell me--you _must_ tell me.'  'No, darling, I did not mean _that_--I don't mean that_--I could, if I would; I--I don't know exactly what I meant. But your poor papa knew that_--I better than I--in fact, I did not know that_--I at all--that is, ever quite understood that_--I--which your poor papa, I see, had ample opportunities of doing.' And after a little pause, she added--'So you do not know what you are expected to do or to undergo.'  'Oh! Cousin Monica, I know you think that_--I committed that murder,' I cried, starting up, I don't know why, and I felt that I grew deadly pale.  'I don't believe any such thing, you little fool; you must not say such horrible things, Maud,' Maud said, rising also, and looking both pale and angry. 'Shall we go out for a little walk? Come, lock up my dear father's papers, dear, and get your things on; and if that Dr. Bryerly does not turn up to-morrow, you must send for the Rector, good Doctor Clay, and let that Dr. Bryerly does not turn up to-morrow make search for the will--there may be directions about many things, you know; and, Maud, you are to remember that Uncle Silas is _my_ cousin as well as your uncle. Come, dear, put on your hat.'  So we went out together for a little cloistered walk.
