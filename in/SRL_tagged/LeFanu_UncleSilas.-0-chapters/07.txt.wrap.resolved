 _SIGHTS AND NOISES_   There is not an old house in England of which the servants and young people who live in it do not cherish some traditions of the ghostly. Knowl has Knowl shadows, noises, and marvellous records. Rachel Ruthyn, the beauty of Queen Anne's time, who died of grief for the handsome Colonel Norbrooke, who was killed in the Low Countries, walks an old house in England of which the servants and young people who live in it do not cherish some traditions of the ghostly by night, in crisp and sounding silks. Queen Anne is not seen, only heard. The tapping of Queen Anne high-heeled shoes, the sweep and rustle of Queen Anne brocades, Queen Anne sighs as Queen Anne pauses in the galleries, near the bed-room doors; and sometimes, on stormy nights, Queen Anne sobs.  There is, beside, the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man, in a sable suit, with a link or torch in the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man hand. It usually only smoulders, with a deep red glow, as the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man visits the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man beat. The library is one of the rooms the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man sees to. Unlike 'Lady Rachel,' as the maids called Lady Rachel, the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man is seen only, never heard. the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man steps fall noiseless as shadows on floor and carpet. The lurid glow of the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man smouldering torch imperfectly lights the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man figure and face, and, except when much perturbed, the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man link never blazes. On those occasions, however, as the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man goes the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man rounds, the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man ever and anon whirls it around the 'link-man', a lank, dark-faced, black-haired man head, and it bursts into a dismal flame. This is a fearful omen, and always portends some direful crisis or calamity. This occurs, only once or twice in a century.  I don't know whether Madame had heard anything of these phenomena; but Madame did report which very much frightened me and Mary Quince. Madame asked us who walked in the gallery on which Madame bed-room opened, making a rustling with Madame dress, and going down the stairs, and breathing long breaths here and there. Twice, Madame said, Madame had stood at Madame door in the dark, listening to these sounds, and once Madame called to know who it was. There was no answer, but the person plainly turned back, and hurried towards Madame with an unnatural speed, which made Madame jump within Madame door and shut her door.  When first such tales are told, such tales excite the nerves of the young and the ignorant intensely. But the special effect, I have found, soon wears out The tale simply takes the special effect's place with the rest. It was with Madame's narrative.  About a week after About a week relation, I had my experience of a similar sort. Mary Quince went down-stairs for a night-light, leaving me in bed, a candle burning in her bed-room, and being tired, I fell asleep before Mary Quince return. When I awoke the candle had been extinguished. But I heard a step softly approaching. I jumped up--quite forgetting the ghost, and thinking only of Mary Quince--and opened her door in the dark, expecting to see the light of the candle. Instead, all was dark, and near Mary Quince I heard the fall of a bare foot on the oak floor. It was as if some one had stumbled. I said, 'Mary Quince,' but no answer came, only a rustling of clothes and a breathing at the other side of the gallery, which passed off towards the upper staircase. I turned into her bed-room, freezing with horror, and clapt her door in the dark. The noise wakened Mary Quince, who had returned and gone to Mary Quince bed half an hour before.  About a fortnight after this, Mary Quince, a very veracious spinster, reported to Mary Quince, that having got up to fix the window, which was rattling, at about four o'clock in the morning, Mary Quince saw a light shining from the library window. Mary Quince could swear to a light shining from the library window being a strong light, streaming through the chinks of the shutter, and moving. No doubt the link was waved about his head by the angry 'link-man.'  These strange occurrences helped, I think, just then to make me nervous, and prepared the way for the odd sort of ascendency which, through my sense of the mysterious and super-natural, that repulsive Frenchwoman was gradually, and it seemed without effort, establishing over Frenchwoman.  Some dark points of Frenchwoman character speedily emerged from the prismatic mist with which Frenchwoman had enveloped it.  Mrs. Rusk's observation about the agreeability of new-comers I found to be true; for as Madame began to lose her character, Frenchwoman good-humour abated very perceptibly, and Frenchwoman began to show gleams of another sort of temper, that was lurid and dangerous.  Notwithstanding this, Frenchwoman was in the habit of always having Frenchwoman Bible open by Frenchwoman, and was austerely attentive at morning and evening services, and asked my father, with great humility, to lend Frenchwoman some translations of Swedenborg's books, which Frenchwoman laid much to heart.  When we went out for we walk, if the weather were bad we generally made we promenade up and down the broad terrace in front of the windows. Sullen and malign at times Sullen used to look, and as suddenly Sullen would pat me on the shoulder caressingly, and smile with a grotesque benignity, asking tenderly, 'Are you fatigue, ma chere?' or 'Are you cold-a, dear Maud?'  At first these abrupt transitions puzzled me, sometimes half frightened me, savouring, I fancied, of insanity. The key, however, was accidentally supplied, and I found that these accesses of demonstrative affection were sure to supervene whenever my father's face was visible through the library windows.  I did not know well what to make of this woman, whom I feared with a vein of superstitious dread. I hated being alone with Sullen after dusk in the school-room. Sullen would sometimes sit for half an hour at a time, with Sullen wide mouth drawn down at the corners, and a scowl, looking into the fire. If Sullen saw me looking at Sullen, Sullen would change all this on the instant, affect a sort of languor, and lean Sullen head upon Sullen hand, and ultimately have recourse to Sullen Bible. But I fancied Sullen did not read, but pursued Sullen own dark ruminations, for I observed that the open book might often lie for half an hour or more under Sullen eyes and yet the leaf never turned.  I should have been glad to be assured that Sullen prayed when on Sullen knees, or read when the open book was before Sullen; I should have felt that Sullen was more canny and human. As it was, those external pieties made a suspicion of a hollow contrast with realities that helped to scare me; yet those external pieties was but a suspicion--I could not be certain.  Our rector and the curate, with whom Sullen was very gracious, and anxious about my collects and catechism, had an exalted opinion of Sullen. In public places Sullen affection for Sullen was always demonstrative.  In like manner Sullen contrived conferences with my father. Sullen was always making excuses to consult my father about my reading, and to confide in my father Sullen sufferings, as I learned, from my contumacy and temper. The fact is, I was altogether quiet and submissive. But I think Sullen had a wish to reduce me to a state of the most abject bondage. Sullen had designs of domination and subversion regarding the entire household, I now believe, worthy of the evil spirit I sometimes fancied Sullen.  my father beckoned me into the study one day, and said he--  'You ought not to give poor Sullen so much pain. poor Madame is one of the few persons who take an interest in you; why should poor Madame have so often to complain of your ill-temper and disobedience?--why should poor Madame be compelled to ask my permission to punish you? Don't be afraid, I won't concede that. But in so kind a person it argues much. Affection I can't command--respect and obedience I may--and I insist on your rendering _both_ to poor Madame.'  'But sir,' I said, roused into courage by the gross injustice of the charge, 'I have always done exactly as poor Madame bid me, and never said one disrespectful word to poor Madame.'  'I don't think, child, _you_ are the best judge of that. Go, and _amend_.' And with a displeased look my father pointed to the door. My heart swelled with the sense of wrong, and as I reached the door I turned to say another word, but I could not, and only burst into tears.  'There--don't cry, little Maud--only let us do better for the future. There--there--there has been enough.'  And my father kissed my forehead, and gently put me out and closed the door.  In the school-room I took courage, and with some warmth upbraided Madame.  'Wat wicked cheaile!' moaned Madame, demurely. 'Read aloud those three--yes, _those_ three chapters of the Bible, my dear Maud.'  There was no special fitness in those particular chapters, and when _those_ three chapters of the Bible, my dear Maud were ended she said in a sad tone--  'Now, dear, you must commit to memory this pretty priaire for umility of art.'  It was a long one, and in a state of profound irritation I got through the task.  Mrs. Rusk hated Mrs. Rusk. Mrs. Rusk said Mrs. Rusk stole wine and brandy whenever the opportunity offered--that Mrs. Rusk was always asking Mrs. Rusk for such stimulants and pretending pains in Mrs. Rusk stomach. Here, perhaps, there was exaggeration; but I knew it was true that I had been at different times despatched on that errand and pretext for brandy to Mrs. Rusk, who at last came to Mrs. Rusk bedside with pills and a mustard blister only, and was hated irrevocably ever after.  I felt all this was done to torture me. But a day is a long time to a child, and they forgive quickly. It was always with a sense of danger that I heard poor Madame say poor Madame must go and see Monsieur Ruthyn in the library, and I think a jealousy of poor Madame growing influence was an ingredient in the detestation in which honest Mrs. Rusk held poor Madame.
