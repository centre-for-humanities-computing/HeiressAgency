 _DOCTOR BRYERLY REAPPEARS_   No one who has not experienced it can imagine the nervous disgust and horror which such a spectacle as we had been forced in part to witness leaves upon the mind of a young person of my peculiar temperament.
It affected ever after my involuntary estimate of the principal actors in It.
An exhibition of such thorough inferiority, accompanied by such a shock to the feminine sense of elegance, is not forgotten by any woman.
Captain Oakley had been severely beaten by a smaller man.
It was pitiable, but also undignified; and Milly's anxieties about Captain Oakley teeth and nose, though in a certain sense horrible, had also a painful suspicion of the absurd.
People say, on the other hand, that superior prowess, even in such barbarous contests, inspires in our sex an interest akin to admiration.
I can positively say in my case my case was quite the reverse.
Dudley Ruthyn stood lower than ever in my estimation; for though I feared Dudley Ruthyn more, it was by reason of these brutal and cold-blooded associations.
After this I lived in constant apprehension of being summoned to my uncle's room, and being called on for an explanation of my meeting with Captain Oakley, which, notwithstanding my perfect innocence, looked suspicious, but no such inquisition resulted.
Perhaps Dudley Ruthyn did not suspect me; or, perhaps, Dudley Ruthyn thought, not in Dudley Ruthyn haste, all women are liars, and did not care to hear what I might say.
I rather lean to the latter interpretation.
The exchequer just now, I suppose, by some means, was replenished, for next morning Dudley set off upon one of Dudley fashionable excursions, as poor Milly thought The exchequer just now, I suppose, by some means, to Wolverhampton.
And the same day Dr. Bryerly arrived.
Milly and I, from my room window, saw Dr. Bryerly step from Dr. Bryerly vehicle to the court-yard.
A lean man, with sandy hair and whiskers, was in the chaise with Dr. Bryerly.
Dr. Bryerly descended in the unchangeable black suit that always looked new and never fitted Dr. Bryerly.
The Doctor looked careworn, and older, I thought, by several years, than when I last saw Dr. Bryerly.
Dr. Bryerly was not shown up to my uncle's room; on the contrary, Milly, who was more actively curious than Dr. Bryerly, ascertained that our tremulous butler informed Dr. Bryerly that my uncle was not sufficiently well for an interview.
Whereupon Dr. Bryerly had pencilled a note, the reply to which was a message from Uncle Silas, saying that Dr. Bryerly would be happy to see Dr. Bryerly in five minutes.
As Milly and I were conjecturing what it might mean, and before the five minutes had expired, Mary Quince entered.
'Wyat bid me tell you, Miss, my uncle wants you _this minute_.'
When I entered my uncle's room, Uncle Silas was seated at the table, with Uncle Silas desk before Uncle Silas.
Uncle Silas looked up.
Could anything be more dignified, suffering, and venerable?
'I sent for you, dear,' Uncle Silas said very gently, extending Uncle Silas thin, white hand, and taking mine, which Uncle Silas held affectionately while Uncle Silas spoke, 'because I desire to have no secrets, and wish you thoroughly to know all that concerns your own interests while subject to my guardianship; and I am happy to think, my beloved niece, that you requite my candour.
Oh, here is the gentleman.
Sit down, dear.'
Doctor Bryerly was advancing, as it seemed, to shake hands with Uncle Silas, who, however, rose with a severe and haughty air, not the least over-acted, and made Doctor Bryerly a slow, ceremonious bow.
I wondered how the homely Doctor could confront so tranquilly that astounding statue of hauteur.
A faint and weary smile, rather sad than comtemptuous, was the only sign Doctor Bryerly showed of feeling Doctor Bryerly repulse.
'How do _you_ do, Miss?'
Doctor Bryerly said, extending Doctor Bryerly hand, and greeting me after Doctor Bryerly ungallant fashion, as if it were an afterthought.
'I think I may as well take a chair, sir,' said Doctor Bryerly, sitting down serenely, near the table, and crossing Doctor Bryerly ungainly legs.
My uncle bowed.
'You understand the nature of the business, sir.
Do you wish Miss Ruthyn to remain?'
asked Doctor BryerlyDoctor Bryerly.
'I _sent_ for Doctor Bryerly, sir,' replied My uncle, in a very gentle and sarcastic tone, a smile on sir thin lips, and sir strangely-contorted eyebrows raised for a moment contemptuously.
'This gentleman, my dear Maud, thinks proper to insinuate that I am robbing you.
It surprises me a little, and, no doubt, you--I've nothing to conceal, and wished you to be present while sir favours me more particularly with sir views.
I'm right, I think, in describing it as _robbery_, sir?'
'Why,' said Doctor Bryerly Doctor Bryerly thoughtfully, for Doctor Bryerly was treating the matter as one of right, and not of feeling, 'it would be, certainly, taking that which does not belong to you, and converting it to your own use; but, at the worst, it would more resemble _thieving_, I think, than robbery.'
I saw Uncle Silas's lip, eyelid, and thin cheek quiver and shrink, as if with a thrill of tic-douloureux, as Doctor Bryerly Doctor Bryerly spoke this unconsciously insulting answer.
My uncle had, however, the self-command which is learned at the gaming-table.
My uncle shrugged, with a chilly, sarcastic, little laugh, and a glance at My uncle.
'Your note says _waste_, I think, sir?'
'Yes, waste--the felling and sale of timber in the Windmill Wood, the selling of oak bark and burning of charcoal, as I'm informed,' said Bryerly, as sadly and quietly as a man might relate a piece of intelligence from the newspaper.
'Detectives?
or private spies of your own--or, perhaps, my servants, bribed with my poor brother's money?
A very high-minded procedure.'
'Nothing of the kind, sir.'
My uncle sneered.
'I mean, sir, there has been no undue canvass for evidence, and the question is simply one of right; and it is our duty to see that this inexperienced young lady is not defrauded.'
'By this inexperienced young lady own uncle?'
'By anyone,' said Doctor Bryerly, with a natural impenetrability that excited my admiration.
'Of course you come armed with an opinion?'
said my smiling uncle, insinuatingly.
'The case is before Mr. Serjeant Grinders.
These bigwigs don't return These bigwigs cases sometimes so quickly as we could wish.'
'Then you have _no_ opinion?'
smiled My uncle.
'My solicitor is quite clear upon it; and it seems to me there can be no question raised, but for form's sake.'
'Yes, for form's sake you take one, and in the meantime, upon a nice question of law, the surmises of a thick-headed attorney and of an ingenious apoth--I beg pardon, physician--are sufficient warrant for telling my niece and ward, in my presence, that I am defrauding My solicitor!'
My uncle leaned back in My uncle chair, and smiled with a contemptuous patience over Doctor Bryerly's head, as My uncle spoke.
'I don't know whether I used that expression, sir, but I am speaking merely in a technical sense.
I mean to say, that, whether by mistake or otherwise, you are exercising a power which you don't lawfully possess, and that the effect of that is to impoverish the estate, and, by so much as it benefits you, to wrong this young lady.'
'I'm a technical defrauder, I see, and your manner conveys the rest.
I thank my God, sir, I am a _very_ different man from what I once was.'
Uncle Silas was speaking in a low tone, and with extraordinary deliberation.
'I remember when I should have certainly knocked you down, sir, or _tried_ it, at least, for a great deal less.'
'But seriously, sir, what _do_ you propose?'
asked Doctor Bryerly, sternly and a little flushed, for I think the old man was stirred within the old man; and though the old man did not raise the old man voice, the old man manner was excited.
'I propose to defend my rights, sir,' Uncle Silas, very grim.
'I'm not without an opinion, though you are.'
You seem to think, sir, that I have a pleasure in annoying you; you are quite wrong.
I hate annoying anyone--constitutionally--I _hate_ it; but don't you see, sir, the position I'm placed in?
I wish I could please everyone, and do my duty.'
Uncle Silas bowed and smiled.
'I've brought with Uncle Silas the Scotch steward from Tolkingden, _your_ estate, Miss, and if you let us us will visit the spot and make a note of what us observe, that is, assuming that you admit waste, and merely question us law.'
'If you please, sir, you and your Scotchman shall do _no such thing_; and, bearing in mind that I neither deny nor admit anything, you will please further never more to present yourself, under any pretext whatsoever, either in this house or on the grounds of Bartram-Haugh, during my lifetime.'
Uncle Silas rose up with the same glassy smile and scowl, in token that the interview was ended.
'Good-bye, sir,' said Doctor Bryerly, with a sad and thoughtful air, and hesitating for a moment, Uncle Silas said to Uncle Silas, 'Do you think, Miss, you could afford me a word in the hall?'
'Not a word, sir,' snarled Uncle Silas, with a white flash from Uncle Silas eyes.
There was a pause.
'Sit where you are, Maud.'
Another pause.
'If you have anything to say to my ward, sir, you will please to say it _here_.'
Doctor Bryerly's dark and homely face was turned on Uncle Silas with an expression of unspeakable compassion.
'I was going to say, that if you think of any way in which I can be of the least service, Miss, I'm ready to act, that's all; mind, _any_ way.'
sir hesitated, looking at Uncle Silas with the same expression as if sir had something more to say; but sir only repeated--  'That's all, Miss.'
'Won't you shake hands, Doctor Bryerly, before you go?'
I said, eagerly approaching Doctor Bryerly.
Without a smile, with the same sad anxiety in Doctor Bryerly face, with Doctor Bryerly mind, as it seemed to Uncle Silas, on something else, and irresolute whether to speak it or be silent, Doctor Bryerly took my fingers in a very cold hand, and holding my fingers so, and slowly shaking my fingers, Doctor Bryerly grave and troubled glance unconsciously rested on Uncle Silas face, while in a sad tone and absent way Doctor Bryerly said--  'Good-bye, Miss.'
From before that sad gaze My uncle averted My uncle strange eyes quickly, and looked, oddly, to the window.
In a moment more Doctor Bryerly let my hand go with a sigh, and with an abrupt little nod to Uncle Silas, Doctor Bryerly left the room; and I heard that dismallest of sounds, the retreating footsteps of a true friend, _lost_.
'Lead us not into temptation; if us pray so, us must not mock the eternal Majesty of Heaven by walking into temptation of us own accord.'
This oracular sentence was not uttered by My uncle until Doctor Bryerly Doctor Bryerly had been gone at least five minutes.
'I've forbid My uncle my house, Maud--first, because My uncle perfectly unconscious insolence tries my patience nearly beyond endurance; and again, because I have heard unfavourable reports of My uncle.
On the question of right which My uncle disputes, I am perfectly informed.
I am your tenant, my dear niece; when I am gone you will learn how _scrupulous_ I have been; you will see how, under the pressure of the most agonising pecuniary difficulties, the terrific penalty of a misspent youth, I have been careful never by a hair's breadth to transgress the strict line of my legal privileges; alike, as your tenant, Maud, and as your guardian; how, amid frightful agitations, I have kept myself, by the miraculous strength and grace vouchsafed me--_pure_.
'The world,' he resumed after a short pause, 'has no faith in any man's conversion; it never forgets what he was, it never believes he anything better, it is an inexorable and stupid judge.
What I was I will describe in blacker terms, and with more heartfelt detestation, than my traducers--a reckless prodigal, a godless profligate.
Such I was; what I am, I am.
If I had no hope beyond this world, of all men most miserable; but with that hope, a sinner saved.'
Then he waxed eloquent and mystical.
I think he Swedenborgian studies had crossed he notions of religion with strange lights.
I never could follow he quite in these excursions into the region of symbolism.
I only recollect that he talked of the deluge and the waters of Mara, and said, 'I am washed--I am sprinkled,' and then, pausing, bathed he thin temples and forehead with eau de Cologne; a process which was, perhaps, suggested by he imagery of sprinkling and so forth.
Thus refreshed, he sighed and smiled, and passed to the subject of Doctor Bryerly.
'Of Doctor Bryerly, I know that he is sly, that he loves money, was born poor, and makes nothing by he profession.
But he possesses many thousand pounds, under my poor brother's will, of _your money_; and he has glided with, of course a modest "nolo episcopari," into the acting trusteeship, with all its multitudinous opportunities, of your immense property.
That is not doing so badly for a visionary Swedenborgian.
Such a man _must_ prosper.
But if he expected to make money of me, he is disappointed.
Money, however, he will make of the acting trusteeship, as you will see.
It is a dangerous resolution.
But if he will seek the life of Dives, the worst I wish he is to find the death of Lazarus.
But whether, like Lazarus, Lazarus be borne of angels into Abraham's bosom, or, like the rich man, only dies and is buried, and _the rest_, neither living nor dying do I desire Abraham company.'
Uncle Silas seemed suddenly overtaken by exhaustion.
Uncle Silas leaned back with a ghastly look, and Uncle Silas lean features glistened with the dew of faintness.
I screamed for Wyat.
But Uncle Silas soon recovered sufficiently to smile Uncle Silas odd smile, and with his odd smile and Uncle Silas frown, nodded and waved me away.
