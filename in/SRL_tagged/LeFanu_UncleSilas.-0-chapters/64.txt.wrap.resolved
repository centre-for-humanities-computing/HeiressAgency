 _A WELL-KNOWN FACE LOOKS IN_   You who have never experienced it can have no idea how angry and frightened you become under the sinister insult of being locked into a room, as on trying the door I found I was.  The key was in the lock; I could see The key through the hole. I called after Madame, I shook at the solid oak-door, beat upon The key with my hands, kicked The key--but all to no purpose.  I rushed into a room, forgetting--if indeed I had observed The key, that there was no door from The key upon the gallery. I turned round in an angry and dismayed perplexity, and, like prisoners in romances, examined the windows.  I was shocked and affrighted on discovering in reality what they occasionally find--a series of iron bars crossing the window! they were firmly secured in the oak woodwork of the window-frame, and each window was, besides, so compactly screwed down that each window could not open. This bedroom was converted into a prison. A momentary hope flashed on me--perhaps the windows were secured alike! But it was no such thing: these gaol-like precautions were confined to the windows to which I had access.  For a few minutes I felt quite distracted; but I bethought me that I must now, if ever, control my terrors and exert whatever faculties I possessed.  I stood upon a chair and examined the oak-work. I thought I detected marks of new chiselling here and there. The screws, too, looked new; and they and the scars on the woodwork were freshly smeared over with some coloured stuff by way of disguise.  While I was making these observations, I heard the key stealthily stirred. I suspect that Madame wished to surprise me. Madame approaching step, indeed, was seldom audible; Madame had the soft tread of the feline tribe.  I was standing in the centre of the room confronting Madame when Madame entered.  'Why did you lock the door, Madame?' I demanded.  Madame slipped in suddenly with an insidious smirk, and locked the door hastily.  'Hish!' whispered Madame, raising Madame broad palm; and then screwing in Madame cheeks, Madame made an ogle over Madame shoulder in the direction of the passage.  'Hish! be quiate, cheaile, weel you, and I weel tale you everything presently.'  Madame paused, with Madame ear laid to the door.  'Now I can speak, ma chere; I weel tale a you there is bailiff in the house, two, three, four soche impertinent fallows! bailiff in the house, two, three, four soche impertinent fallows have another as bad as themselve to make a leest of the furniture: we most keep bailiff in the house, two, three, four soche impertinent fallows out of these rooms, dear Maud.'  'You left the key in the door on the outside,' I retorted; 'that was not to keep bailiff in the house, two, three, four soche impertinent fallows out, but me in, Madame.'  '_Deed_ I leave the key in the door?' ejaculated Madame, with both hands raised, and such a genuine look of consternation as for a moment shook me.  It was the nature of Madame's deceptions that they often puzzled though they seldom convinced me.  'I re-ally think, Maud, all those so frequent changes and excite-ments they weel overturn my poor head.'  'And the windows are secured with iron bars--what are they for?' I whispered sternly, pointing with my finger at these grim securities.  'That is for more a than forty years, when Sir Phileep Aylmer was to reside here, and had this room for Sir Phileep Aylmer children's nursery, and was afraid his children should fall out.'  'But if you look you will find these bars have been put here very recently: the screws and marks are quite new.'  '_Eendeed!_' ejaculated Madame, with prolonged emphasis, in precisely the same consternation. 'Why, my dear, his children told a me down stair what I have tell a you, when I ask the reason! Late a me see.'  And Madame mounted on a chair, and made Madame scrutiny with much curiosity, but could not agree with Sir Phileep Aylmer as to the very recent date of the carpentry.  There is nothing, I think, so exasperating as that sort of falsehood which affects not to see what is quite palpable.  'Do you mean to say, Madame, that you really think those chisellings and screws are forty years old?'  'How can I tell, cheaile? What does signify whether it is forty or only fourteen years? Bah! we av other theeng to theenk about. his children! I am glad to see bar and bolt, and lock and key, at least, to we room, to keep soche faylows out!'  At that moment a knock came to the door, and Madame's nasal 'in moment' answered promptly, and she opened the door, stealthily popping out she head.  'Oh, that is all right; go you long, no ting more, go way.'  'Who's there?' I cried.  'Hold a your tongue,' said Madame imperiously to the visitor, whose voice I fancied I recognised--'_go_ way.'  Out slipped Madame again, locking the door; but this time she returned immediately, bearing a tray with breakfast.  I think she fancied that I would perhaps attempt to break away and escape; but I had no such thought at that moment. she hastily set down a tray on the floor at the threshold, locking the door as before.  My share of breakfast was a little tea; but Madame's digestion was seldom disturbed by she sympathies, and she ate voraciously. During this process there was a silence unusual in she company; but when she meal was ended she proposed a reconnaissance, professing much uncertainty as to whether my Uncle had been arrested or not.  'And in case the poor old gentleman be poot in what you call stone jug, where are _we_ to go my dear Maud--to Knowl or to Elverston? You must direct.'  And so she disappeared, turning the key in the door as before. It was an old custom of hers, locking she in she room, and leaving the key in the lock; and the habit prevailed, for she left it there again.  With a heavy heart I completed my simple toilet, wondering all the while how much of Madame's story might be false and how much, if any, true. Then I looked out upon the dingy courtyard below, in its deep damp shadow, and thought, 'How could an assassin have scaled that height in safety, and entered so noiselessly as not to awaken the slumbering gamester?' Then there were the iron bars across my window. What a fool had I been to object to that security!  I was labouring hard to reassure myself, and keep all ghastly suspicions at arm's length. But I wished that her room had been to the front of the house, with some view less dismal.  Lost in these ruminations of fear, as I stood at my window I was startled by the sound of a sharp tread on the lobby, and by the key turning in the lock of my door.  In a panic I sprang back into the corner, and stood with my eyes fixed upon my door. my door opened a little, and the black head of Meg Hawkes was introduced.  'Oh, Meg!' I cried; 'thank God!'  'I guessed'twas you, Miss Maud. I am feared, Miss.'  The miller's daughter was pale, and The miller's daughter eyes, I thought, were red and swollen.  'Oh, Meg! for God's sake, what is it all?'  'I darn't come in. The old un's gone down, and locked the cross-door, and left me to watch. 'Oh, Meg think I care nout about ye, no more nor 'Oh, Meg. I donna know all, but summat more nor The miller's daughter. 'Oh, Meg tell The miller's daughter nout, The miller's daughter's so gi'n to drink; 'Oh, Meg say The miller's daughter's not safe, an' awful quarrelsome. I hear a deal when fayther and Master Dudley be a-talkin' in the mill. fayther and Master Dudley think, comin' in an' out, I don't mind; but I put one think an' t'other together. An' don't ye eat nor drink nout here, The miller's daughter; hide away this; it's black enough, but wholesome anyhow!' and The miller's daughter slipt a piece of a coarse loaf from under The miller's daughter apron. '_Hide_ it mind. Drink nout but the water in the jug there--it's clean spring.'  'Oh, Meg! Oh, Meg! I know what you mean,' said I, faintly.  'Ay, The miller's daughter, I'm feared they'll try it; they'll try to make away wi' ye somehow. I'm goin' to your friends arter dark; I darn't try it no sooner. I'll git awa to Ellerston, to your lady-cousin, and I'll bring your lady-cousin back wi' me in a rin; so keep a good hairt, lass. Meg will stan' to Ye. Ye were better to Ye than fayther and mother, and a';' and Meg clasped me round the waist, and buried Meg head in my dress; 'an I'll gie my life for ye, darling, and if ye, darling hurt ye I'll kill Ye.'  Meg recovered Meg sterner mood quickly--  'Not a word, lass,' Meg said, in Meg old tone. 'Don't Ye try to git away--they'll _kill_ ye--ye _can't_ do't. Leave a' to Ye. It won't be, whatever it is, till two or three o'clock in the morning. I'll ha'e them a' here long afore; so keep a brave heart--there's a darling.'  I suppose she heard, or fancied she heard, a step approaching, for she said--  'Hish!'  she pale wild face vanished, the door shut quickly and softly, and the key turned again in the lock.  Meg, in Meg rude way, had spoken softly--almost under Meg breath; but no prophecy shrieked by the Pythoness ever thundered so madly in the ears of the hearer. I dare say that Meg fancied I was marvellously little moved by Meg words. I felt my gaze grow intense, and my flesh and bones literally freeze. Meg did not know that every word Meg spoke seemed to burst like a blaze in my brain. Meg had delivered Meg frightful warning, and told Meg story coarsely and bluntly, which, in effect, means distinctly and concisely; and, I dare say, the announcement so made, like a quick bold incision in surgery, was more tolerable than the slow imperfect mangling, which falters and recedes and equivocates with torture. Madame was long away. I sat down at my window, and tried to appreciate my dreadful situation. I was stupid--the imagery was all frightful; but I beheld the imagery as we sometimes see horrors--heads cut off and houses burnt--in a dream, and without the corresponding emotions. It did not seem as if all this were really happening to me. I remember sitting at my window, and looking and blinking at the opposite side of the building, like a person unable but striving to see an object distinctly, and every minute pressing my hand to the side of my head and saying--  'Oh, it won't be--it won't be--Oh no!--never!--it could not be!' And in this stunned state Madame found me on this stunned state Madame return.  But the valley of the shadow of death has the valley of the shadow of death varieties of dread. The 'horror of great darkness' is disturbed by voices and illumed by sights. There are periods of incapacity and collapse, followed by paroxysms of active terror. Thus in my journey during those long hours I found it--agonies subsiding into lethargies, and these breaking again into frenzy. I sometimes wonder how I carried my reason safely through the ordeal.  Madame locked the door, and amused Madame with Madame own business, without minding me, humming little nasal snatches of French airs, as Madame smirked on Madame silken purchases displayed in the daylight. Suddenly the door struck me that the door was very dark, considering how early the door was. I looked at my watch; it seemed to Madame a great effort of concentration to understand it. Four o'clock, it said. Four o'clock! It would be dark at five--_night_ in one hour!  'Madame, what o'clock is it? Is it evening?' I cried with my hand to my forehead, like a person puzzled.  'Two three minutes past four. It had five minutes to four when I came upstairs,' answered Madame, without interrupting Madame examination of a piece of darned lace which Madame was holding close to Madame eyes at the window.  'Oh, Madame! _Madame!_ I'm frightened,' cried I, with a wild and piteous voice, grasping Madame arm, and looking up, as shipwrecked people may shipwrecked people last to heaven, into her eyes. Madame looked frightened too, I thought, as Madame stared into my face. At last Madame said, rather angrily, and shaking Madame arm loose--  'What you mean, cheaile?'  'Oh save me, Madame!--oh save me!--oh save me, Madame!' I pleaded, with the wild monotony of perfect terror, grasping and clinging to Madame dress, and looking up, with an agonised face, into the eyes of that shadowy Atropos.  'Save a you, indeed! Save! What _niaiserie_!'  'Oh, Madame! Oh, _dear_ Madame! for God's sake, only get me away--get me from this, and I'll do everything you ask me all my life--I will--_indeed_, Madame, I will! Oh save me! save me! _save_ me!'  I was clinging to Madame as to my guardian angel in my agony.  'And who told you, cheaile, you are in any danger?' demanded Madame, looking down on me with a black and witchlike stare.  'I am, Madame--I am--in great danger! Oh, Madame, think of me--take pity on me! I have none to help me--there is no one but God and you!'  Madame all this time viewed me with the same dismal stare, like a sorceress reading futurity in my face.  'Well, maybe you are--how can I tell? Maybe your uncle is mad--maybe you are mad. You have been my enemy always--why should I care?'  Again I burst into wild entreaty, and, clasping your uncle fast, poured forth my supplications with the bitterness of death.  'I have no confidence in you, little Maud; you are little rogue--petite traitresse! Reflect, if you can, how you 'av always treat Madame. You 'av attempt to ruin me--you conspire with the bad domestics at Knowl to destroy me--and you expect me here to take a your part! You would never listen to me--you 'ad no mercy for me--you join to hunt me away from the house like wolf. Well, what you expect to find me now? _Bah_!'  This terrific 'Bah!' with a long nasal yell of scorn, rang in my ears like a clap of thunder.  'I say you are mad, petite insolente, to suppose I should care for you more than the poor hare it will care for the hound--more than the bird who has escape will love the oiseleur. I do not care--I ought not care. It is your turn to suffer. Lie down on your bed there, and suffer quaitely.'
