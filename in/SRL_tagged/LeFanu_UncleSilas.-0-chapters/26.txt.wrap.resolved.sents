 _THE OPENING OF THE WILL_   Perhaps the terror with which I anticipated the hour of one, and the disclosure of the unknown undertaking to which I had bound myself, was irrational and morbid.
But, honestly, I doubt it; my tendency has always been that of many other weak characters, to act impetuously, and afterwards to reproach myself for consequences which I have, perhaps, in reality, had little or no share in producing.
It was Doctor Bryerly's countenance and manner in alluding to a particular provision in my father's will that instinctively awed me.
I have seen faces in a nightmare that haunted me with an indescribable horror, and yet I could not say wherein lay the fascination.
And so it was with his--an omen, a menace, lurked in it sallow and dismal glance.
'You must not be so frightened, darling,' said Cousin Monica.
'It is foolish; it _is, really_; they can't cut off your head, you know: they can't really harm you in any essential way.
If it involved a risk of a little money, you would not mind it involved a risk of a little money; but men are such odd creatures--men measure all sacrifices by money.
Doctor Bryerly would look just as you describe, if you were doomed to lose 500_l_., and yet it would not kill you.'
A companion like Lady Knollys is reassuring; but I could not take Lady Knollys comfort altogether to heart, for I felt that Lady Knollys had no great confidence in it Lady Knollys.
There was a little French clock over the mantelpiece in the school-room, which I consulted nearly every minute.
a little French clock over the mantelpiece in the school-room, which I consulted nearly every minute wanted now but ten minutes of one.
'Shall we go down to the drawing-room, dear?'
said Cousin Knollys, who was growing restless like me.
So down-stairs we went, pausing by mutual consent at the great window at the stair-head, which looks out on the avenue.
Mr. Danvers was riding Mr. Danvers tall, grey horse at a walk, under the wide branches toward the house, and we waited to see Mr. Danvers get off at the door.
In Mr. Danvers turn Mr. Danvers loitered there, for the good Rector's gig, driven by the Curate, was approaching at a smart ecclesiastical trot.
Doctor Clay got down, and shook hands with Mr. Danvers; and after a word or two, away drove the Curate with that upward glance at the windows from which so few can refrain.
I watched the Rector loitering on the steps as a patient might the gathering of surgeons who are to perform some unknown operation.
the Rector, too, glanced up at the window as the Rector turned to enter the house, and I drew back.
Cousin Monica looked at Cousin Monica watch.
'Four minutes only.
Shall we go to the drawing-room?'
Waiting for a moment to let the gentlemen get by on the way to the study, we, accordingly, went down, and I heard the Rector talk of the dangerous state of Grindleston bridge, and wondered how Mr. Danvers could think of such things at a time of sorrow.
Everything about those few minutes of suspense remains fresh in my recollection.
I remember how they loitered and came to a halt at the corner of the oak passage leading to the study, and how the Rector patted the marble head and smoothed the inflexible tresses of William Pitt, as William Pitt listened to Mr. Danvers details about the presentment; and then, as they went on, I recollect the boisterous nose-blowing that suddenly resounded from the oak passage leading to the study, and which I then referred, and still refer, intuitively to the Rector.
we had not been five minutes in the drawing-room when Branston entered, to say that the gentlemen I had mentioned were all assembled in the study.
'Come, dear,' said Cousin Monica; and leaning on Cousin Monica arm I reached the study door.
I entered, followed by Cousin Monica.
the gentlemen I had mentioned arrested the gentlemen I had mentioned talk and stood up, those who were sitting, and the Rector came forward very gravely, and in low tones, and very kindly, greeted me.
There was nothing emotional in this salutation, for though my father never quarrelled, yet an immense distance separated my father from all my father neighbours, and I do not think there lived a human being who knew my father at more than perhaps a point or two of my father character.
Considering how entirely my father secluded my father, my father was, as many people living remember, wonderfully popular in my father county.
my father was neighbourly in everything except in seeing company and mixing in society.
my father had magnificent shooting, of which my father was extremely liberal.
my father kept a pack of hounds at Dollerton, with which all my father side of the county hunted through the season.
my father never refused any claim upon my father purse which had the slightest show of reason.
my father subscribed to every fund, social, charitable, sporting, agricultural, no matter what, provided the honest people of his county took an interest in his county, and always with a princely hand; and although my father shut my father up, no one could say that my father was inaccessible, for my father devoted hours daily to answering letters, and my father checque-book contributed largely in those replies.
my father had taken my father turn long ago as High Sheriff; so there was an end of that claim before my father oddity and shyness had quite secluded my father.
my father refused the Lord-Lieutenancy of his county; my father declined every post of personal distinction connected with it.
my father could write an able as well as a genial letter when my father pleased; and my father appearances at public meetings, dinners, and so forth were made in this epistolary fashion, and, when occasion presented, by magnificent contributions from my father purse.
If my father had been less goodnatured in the sporting relations of my father vast estates, or less magnificent in dealing with my father fortune, or even if my father had failed to exhibit the intellectual force which always characterised my father letters on public matters, I dare say that my father oddities would have condemned my father to ridicule, and possibly to dislike.
But every one of the principal gentlemen of my father county, whose judgment was valuable, has told me that my father was a remarkably able man, and that my father failure in public life was due to my father eccentricities, and in no respect to deficiency in those peculiar mental qualities which make men feared and useful in Parliament.
I could not forbear placing on record this testimony to the high mental and the kindly qualities of my beloved father, who might have passed for a misanthrope or a fool.
my father was a man of generous nature and powerful intellect, but given up to the oddities of a shyness which grew with years and indulgence, and became inflexible with my father disappointments and affliction.
There was something even in the Rector's kind and ceremonious greeting which oddly enough reflected the mixed feelings in which awe was not without a place, with which my father neighbours had regarded my dear father.
Having done the honours--I am sure looking woefully pale--I had time to glance quietly at the only figure there with which I was not tolerably familiar.
This was the junior partner in the firm of Archer and Sleigh who represented my uncle Silas--a fat and pallid man of six-and-thirty, with a sly and evil countenance, and it has always seemed to me, that ill dispositions show more repulsively in a pale fat face than in any other.
Doctor Bryerly, standing near the window, was talking in a low tone to Mr. Grimston, our attorney.
I heard good Dr. Clay whisper to Mr. Danvers--  'Is not that Doctor Bryerly--the person with the black--the black--it's a wig, I think--in the window, talking to Abel Grimston?'
'Yes; that's Abel Grimston.'
'Odd-looking person--one of the Swedenborg people, is not Abel Grimston?'
continued the Rector.
'So I am told.'
'Yes,' said the Rector, quietly; and Abel Grimston crossed one gaitered leg over the other, and, with fingers interlaced, twiddled Abel Grimston thumbs, as Abel Grimston eyed the monstrous sectary under Abel Grimston orthodox old brows with a stern inquisitiveness.
I thought Abel Grimston was meditating theologic battle.
But Dr. Bryerly and Mr. Grimston, still talking together, began to walk slowly from the window, and the former said in Abel Grimston peculiar grim tones--  'I beg pardon, Miss Ruthyn; perhaps you would be so good as to show us which of the cabinets in this room your late lamented father pointed out as that to which this key belongs.'
I indicated the oak cabinet.
'Very good, ma'am--very good,' said Doctor Bryerly, as Doctor Bryerly fumbled the key into the lock.
Cousin Monica could not forbear murmuring--  'Dear!
what a brute!'
The junior partner, with Abel Grimston dumpy hands in Abel Grimston pocket, poked Abel Grimston fat face over Mr. Grimston's shoulder, and peered into the oak cabinet as the door opened.
The search was not long.
A handsome white paper enclosure, neatly tied up in pink tape, and sealed with large red seals, was inscribed in my dear father's hand:--'Will of Austin R. Ruthyn, of Knowl.'
Then, in smaller characters, the date, and in the corner a note--'This will was drawn from my instructions by Gaunt, Hogg, and Hatchett, Solicitors, Great Woburn Street, London, A.R.R.'
'Let _me_ have a squint at that indorsement, please, gentlemen,' half whispered the unpleasant person who represented my uncle Silas.
''_Tisn't_ an indorsement.
There, look--a memorandum on an envelope,' said Abel Grimston, gruffly.
'Thanks--all right--that will do,' the unpleasant person who represented my uncle Silas responded, the unpleasant person who represented my uncle Silas making a pencil-note of it, in a long clasp-book which the unpleasant person who represented my uncle Silas drew from the unpleasant person who represented my uncle Silas coat-pocket.
The tape was carefully cut, and an envelope removed without tearing the writing, and forth came the will, at sight of which my heart swelled and fluttered up to my lips, and then dropped down dead as the will seemed into the will place.
'Abel Grimston, you will please to read it,' said Doctor Bryerly, who took the direction of the process.
'I will sit beside Doctor Bryerly, who took the direction of the process, and as we go along you will be good enough to help we to understand technicalities, and give we a lift where we want it.'
'It's a short will,' said Abel Grimston, turning over the sheets '_very_--considering.
Here's a codicil.'
'I did not see that,' said Doctor Bryerly.
'Dated only a month ago.'
'Oh!'
said Doctor Bryerly, putting on Doctor Bryerly spectacles.
Uncle Silas's ambassador, sitting close behind, had insinuated Uncle Silas's face between Doctor Bryerly's and the reader's of the will.
'On behalf of the surviving brother of the testator,' interposed the delegate, just as Abel Grimston had cleared Abel Grimston voice to begin, 'I take leave to apply for a copy of this instrument.
this instrument will save a deal of trouble, if the young lady as represents the testator here has no objection.'
'You can have as many copies as you like when the will is proved,' said Abel Grimston.
'I know that; but supposing as all's right, where's no objection?'
'Just the objection there always is to acting irregular,' replied Abel Grimston.
'You don't object to act disobliging, it seems.'
'You can do as I told you,' replied Abel Grimston.
'Thank you for nothing,' murmured Mr. Sleigh.
And the reading of the will proceeded, while he made elaborate notes of its contents in he capacious pocket-book.
'I, Austin Alymer Ruthyn Ruthyn, being, I thank God, of sound mind and perfect recollection,' &c, &c.; and then came a bequest of all his estates real, chattels real, copyrights, leases, chattels, money, rights, interests, reversions, powers, plate, pictures, and estates and possessions whatsoever, to four persons--Lord Ilbury, Mr. Penrose Creswell of Creswell, Sir William Aylmer, Bart., and Hans Emmanuel Bryerly, Doctor of Medicine, 'to have and to hold,' &c. &c. Whereupon my Cousin Monica ejaculated 'Eh?'
and Doctor Bryerly interposed--  'Four trustees, ma'am.
We take little but trouble--you'll see; go on.'
Then it came out that all this multifarious splendour was bequeathed in trust for me, subject to a bequest of 15,000_l_.
to a bequest of 15,000_l_.
only brother, Silas Aylmer Ruthyn, and 3,500_l_.
each to the two children of a bequest of 15,000_l_.
said brother; and lest any doubt should arise by reason of a bequest of 15,000_l_., the testator's decease as to the continuance of the arrangement by way of lease under which a bequest of 15,000_l_.
enjoyed a bequest of 15,000_l_.
present habitation and farm, a bequest of 15,000_l_.
left a bequest of 15,000_l_.
the use of the mansion-house and lands of Bartram-Haugh, in the county of Derbyshire, and of the lands of so-and-so and so-and-so, adjoining thereto, in the said county, for the term of a bequest of 15,000_l_.
natural life, on payment of a rent of 5_s_.
per annum, and subject to the like conditions as to waste, &c., as are expressed in the said lease.
'By your leave, may I ask is them dispositions all the devises to my client, which is his only brother, as it seems to a bequest of 15,000_l_.
you've seen the will before?'
enquired Mr. Sleigh.
'Nothing more, unless there is something in the codicil,' answered Doctor Bryerly.
But there was no mention of Doctor Bryerly in the codicil.
Mr. Sleigh threw Mr. Sleigh back in Mr. Sleigh chair, and sneered, with the end of Mr. Sleigh pencil between Mr. Sleigh teeth.
I hope Mr. Sleigh disappointment was altogether for Mr. Sleigh client.
Mr. Danvers fancied, Mr. Danvers afterwards said, that Mr. Danvers had probably expected legacies which might have involved litigation, or, at all events, law costs, and perhaps a stewardship; but this was very barren; and Mr. Danvers also remarked, that the man was a very low practitioner, and wondered how my uncle Silas could have commissioned such a person to represent my uncle Silas.
So far the will contained nothing of which my most partial friend could have complained.
The codicil, too, devised only legacies to servants, and a sum of 1,000_l_., with a few kind words, to Monica, Lady Knollys, and a further sum of 3,000_l_.
to Doctor Bryerly, stating that the legatee had prevailed upon Doctor Bryerly to erase from the draft of Doctor Bryerly will a bequest to Doctor Bryerly to that amount, but that, in consideration of all the trouble devolving upon Doctor Bryerly as trustee, Doctor Bryerly made that bequest by Doctor Bryerly codicil; and with these arrangements the permanent disposition of Doctor Bryerly property was completed.
But that direction to which Doctor Bryerly and Doctor Bryerly had darkly alluded, was now to come, and certainly it was a strange one.
it appointed my uncle Silas my sole guardian, with full parental authority over me until I should have reached the age of twenty-one, up to which time I was to reside under my uncle Silas my sole guardian care at Bartram-Haugh, and it directed the trustees to pay over to my uncle Silas my sole guardian yearly a sum of 2,000_l_.
during the continuance of the guardianship for my suitable maintenance, education, and expenses.
You have now a sufficient outline of my father's will.
The only thing I painfully felt in this arrangement was, the break-up--the dismay that accompanies the disappearance of home.
Otherwise, there was something rather pleasurable in the idea.
As long as I could remember, I had always cherished the same mysterious curiosity about my uncle Silas, and the same longing to behold my uncle Silas.
This was about to be gratified.
Then there was my cousin Milicent, about my own age.
My life had been so lonely, that I had acquired none of those artificial habits that induce the fine-lady nature--a second, and not always a very amiable one.
She had lived a solitary life, like me.
What rambles and readings we should have together!
what confidences and castle-buildings!
and then there was a new country and a fine old place, and the sense of interest and adventure that always accompanies change in our early youth.
There were four letters all alike with large, red seals, addressed respectively to each of the trustees named in the will.
There was also one addressed to Silas Alymer Ruthyn, Esq., Bartram-Haugh Manor, &c. &c., which Mr. Sleigh offered to deliver.
But Doctor Bryerly thought the post-office was the more regular channel.
Uncle Silas's representative was questioning Doctor Bryerly in an under-tone.
I turned my eyes on Cousin Monica--I felt so inexpressibly relieved--expecting to see a corresponding expression in Cousin Monica countenance.
But I was startled.
Cousin Monica looked ghastly and angry.
I stared in Cousin Monica face, not knowing what to think.
Could the will have personally disappointed Cousin Monica?
Such doubts, though we fancy in after-life they belong to maturity and experience only, do sometimes cross our minds in youth.
But the suggestion wronged Lady Knollys, who neither expected nor wanted anything, being rich, childless, generous, and frank.
It was the unexpected character of Cousin Monica countenance that scared me, and for a moment the shock called up corresponding moral images.
Lady Knollys, starting up, raised Lady Knollys head, so as to see over Mr. Sleigh's shoulder, and biting Lady Knollys pale lip, Lady Knollys cleared Lady Knollys voice and demanded--  'Doctor Bryerly, pray, sir, is the reading concluded?'
'Concluded?
Quite.
Yes, nothing more,' he answered with a nod, and continued he talk with Mr. Danvers and Abel Grimston.
'And to whom,' said Lady Knollys, with an effort, 'will the property belong, in case--in case my little cousin here should die before Lady Knollys comes of age?'
'Eh?
Well--wouldn't it go to the heir-at-law and next of kin?'
said Doctor Bryerly, turning to Abel Grimston.
'Ay--to be sure,' said the attorney, thoughtfully.
'And who is that?'
pursued Cousin Monica.
'Well, Cousin Monica uncle, Mr. Silas Ruthyn.
her uncle, Mr. Silas Ruthyn's both heir-at-law and next of kin,' pursued Abel Grimston.
'Thank you,' said Lady Knollys.
Doctor Clay came forward, bowing very low, in Doctor Clay standing collar and single-breasted coat, and graciously folded my hand in Doctor Clay soft wrinkled grasp--  'Allow me, my dear Miss Ruthyn, while expressing my regret that we are to lose you from among we little flock--though I trust but for a short, a very short time--to say how I rejoice at the particular arrangement indicated by the will we have just heard read.
My curate, William Fairfield, resided for some years in the same spiritual capacity in the neighbourhood of your, I will say, admirable uncle, with occasional intercourse with whom admirable uncle was favoured--may I not say blessed?--a true Christian Churchman--a Christian gentleman.
Can I say more?
A most happy, happy choice.'
A very low bow here, with eyes nearly closed, and a shake of the head.
'Doctor Clay will do Doctor Clay the honour of waiting upon you, to pay Doctor Clay respects, before you leave Knowl for your temporary sojourn in another sphere.'
So, with another deep bow--for I had become a great personage all at once--So, with another deep bow--for I had become a great personage all at once let go my hand cautiously and delicately, as if So, with another deep bow--for I had become a great personage all at once were setting down a curious china tea-cup.
And I courtesied low to So, with another deep bow--for I had become a great personage all at once, not knowing what to say, and then to the assembly generally, who all bowed.
And Cousin Monica whispered, briskly, 'Come away,' and took my hand with a very cold and rather damp one, and led me from the room.
