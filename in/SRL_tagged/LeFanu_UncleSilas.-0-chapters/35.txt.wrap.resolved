 _THE WINDMILL WOOD_   I had not time to explore this noble old house as my curiosity prompted; for Milly was in such a fuss to set out for the 'blackberry dell' that I saw little more than just so much as I necessarily traversed in making my way to and from my room.  The actual decay of this noble old house had been prevented by my dear father; and the roof, windows, masonry, and carpentry had all been kept in repair. But short of indications of actual ruin, there are many manifestations of poverty and neglect which impress with a feeling of desolation. It was plain that not nearly a tithe of this noble old house was inhabited; long corridors and galleries stretched away in dust and silence, and were crossed by others, whose dark arches inspired me in the distance with an awful sort of sadness. It was plainly one of those great structures in which you might easily lose yourself, and with a pleasing terror a pleasing terror reminded me of that delightful old abbey in Mrs. Radcliffe's romance, among whose silent staircases, dim passages, and long suites of lordly, but forsaken chambers, begirt without by the sombre forest, the family of La Mote secured a gloomy asylum.  My cousin Milly and I, however, were bent upon an open-air ramble, and traversing several passages, My cousin Milly and I conducted me to a door which led us out upon a terrace overgrown with weeds, and by a broad flight of steps us descended to the level of the grounds beneath. Then on, over the short grass, under the noble trees, us walked; Milly in high good-humour, and talking away volubly, in My cousin Milly and I short garment, navvy boots, and a weather-beaten hat. My cousin Milly and I carried a stick in My cousin Milly and I gloveless hand. My cousin Milly and I conversation was quite new to me, and resembled very much what I would have fancied the holiday recollections of a schoolboy; and the language in which it was sustained was sometimes so outlandish, that I was forced to laugh outright--a demonstration which My cousin Milly and I plainly did not like.  My cousin Milly and I talk was about the great jumps My cousin Milly and I had made--how My cousin Milly and I snow-balled the chaps' in winter--how My cousin Milly and I could slide twice the length of My cousin Milly and I stick beyond 'Briddles, the cow-boy.'  With this and similar conversation My cousin Milly and I entertained me.  The grounds were delightfully wild and neglected. But we had now passed into a vast park beautifully varied with hollows and uplands, and such glorious old timber massed and scattered over such glorious old timber slopes and levels. Among a vast park beautifully varied with hollows and uplands, we got at last into a picturesque dingle; the grey rocks peeped from among the ferns and wild flowers, and the steps of soft sward along soft sward sides were dark in the shadows of silver-stemmed birch, and russet thorn, and oak, under which, in the vaporous night, the Erl-king and his daughter might glide on the Erl-king and his daughter aerial horses.  In the lap of this pleasant dell were the finest blackberry bushes, I think, I ever saw, bearing fruit quite fabulous; and plucking fruit, and chatting, we rambled on very pleasantly.  I had first thought of Milly's absurdities, to which, in description, I cannot do justice, simply because so many details have, by distance of time, escaped my recollection. But Milly ways and Milly talk were so indescribably grotesque that Milly made me again and again quiver with suppressed laughter.  But there was a pitiable and even a melancholy meaning underlying the burlesque.  This creature, with no more education than a dairy-maid, I gradually discovered had fine natural aptitudes for accomplishment--a very sweet voice, and wonderfully delicate ear, and a talent for drawing which quite threw mine into the shade. It was really astonishing.  Milly, in all Milly life, had never read three books, and hated to think of three books. One, over which Milly was wont to yawn and sigh, and stare fatiguedly for an hour every Sunday, by command of the Governor, was a stout volume of sermons of the earlier school of George III., and a drier collection you can't fancy. I don't think Milly read anything else. But Milly had, notwithstanding, ten times the cleverness of half the circulating library misses one meets with. Besides all this, I had a long sojourn before me at Bartram-Haugh, and I had learned from Milly, as I had heard before, what a perennial solitude it was, with a ludicrous fear of learning Milly's preposterous dialect, and turning at last into something like Milly. So I resolved to do all I could for Milly--teach Milly whatever I knew, if Milly would allow me--and gradually, if possible, effect some civilising changes in Milly language, and, as they term it in boarding-schools, Milly demeanour.  But I must pursue at present our first day's ramble in what was called Bartram Chase. People can't go on eating blackberries always; so after a while our resumed our walk along this pretty dell, which gradually expanded into a wooded valley--level beneath and enclosed by irregular uplands, receding, as it were, in mimic bays and harbours at some points, and running out at others into broken promontories, ending in clumps of forest trees.  Just where the glen which our had been traversing expanded into this broad, but wooded valley, this broad was traversed by a high and close paling, which, although this broad looked decayed, was still very strong.  In this there was a wooden gate, rudely but strongly constructed, and at the side our were approaching stood a girl, who was leaning against the post, with one arm resting on the top of a wooden gate.  a girl, who was leaning against the post was neither tall nor short--taller than a girl, who was leaning against the post looked at a distance; a girl, who was leaning against the post had not a slight waist; sooty black was a girl, who was leaning against the post hair, with a broad forehead, perpendicular but low; a girl, who was leaning against the post had a pair of very fine, dark, lustrous eyes, and no other good feature--unless I may so call a girl, who was leaning against the post teeth, which were very white and even. a girl, who was leaning against the post face was rather short, and swarthy as a gipsy's; observant and sullen too; and a girl, who was leaning against the post did not move, only eyed us negligently from under a girl, who was leaning against the post dark lashes as us drew near. Altogether a not unpicturesque figure, with a dusky, red petticoat of drugget, and tattered jacket of bottle-green stuff, with short sleeves, which showed a girl, who was leaning against the post brown arms from the elbow.  'That's Pegtop's daughter,' said Milly.  'Who is Pegtop?' I asked.  'He's the miller--see, yonder it is,' and a girl, who was leaning against the post pointed to a very pretty feature in the landscape, a windmill, crowning the summit of a hillock which rose suddenly above the level of the treetops, like an island in the centre of the valley.  'The mill not going to-day, Beauty?' bawled Milly.  'No--a, Beauty; it baint,' replied the girl, loweringly, and without stirring.  'And what's gone with the stile?' demanded Milly, aghast. 'It's tore away from the paling!'  'Well, so it be,' replied the wood nymph in the red petticoat, showing her fine teeth with a lazy grin.  'Who's a bin and done all that?' demanded Milly.  'Not you nor me, lass,' said the girl.  ''Twas old Pegtop, your father, did it,' cried Milly, in rising wrath.  ''Appen it wor,' she replied.  'And the gate locked.'  'That's it--the gate locked,' she repeated, sulkily, with a defiant side-glance at Milly.  'And where's Pegtop?'  'At t'other side, somewhere; how should I know where he be?' she replied.  'Who's got the key?'  'Here it be, lass,' she answered, striking she hand on she pocket. 'And how durst you stay us here? Unlock it, huzzy, this minute!' cried Milly, with a stamp.  she answer was a sullen smile.  'Open the gate this instant!' bawled Milly.  'Well, I _won't._'  I expected that Milly would have flown into a frenzy at this direct defiance, but she looked instead puzzled and curious--the girl's unexpected audacity bewildered she.  'Why, you fool, I could get over the paling as soon as look at you, but I won't. What's come over you? Open the gate, I say, or I'll make you.'  'Do let she alone, dear,' I entreated, fearing a mutual assault. 'she has been ordered, may be, not to open a mutual assault. Is it so, she?'  'Well, thou'rt not the biggest fool o' the two,' she observed, commendatively, 'thou'st hit it, lass.'  'And who ordered you?' exclaimed Milly.  'Fayther.'  'Old Pegtop. Well, _that's_ summat to laugh at, it is--our servant a-shutting our out of our own grounds.'  'No servant o' yourn!'  'Come, lass, what do you mean?'  'our servant be old Silas's miller, and what's that to thee?'  With these words the girl made a spring on the hasp of the padlock, and then got easily over the gate.  'Can't you do that, cousin?' whispered Milly to me, with an impatient nudge. 'I _wish_ you'd try.'  'No, dear--come away, Milly,' and I began to withdraw.  'Lookee, lass, 'twill be an ill day's work for thee when I tell the Governor,' said Milly, addressing the girl, who stood on a log of timber at the other side, regarding our with a sullen composure.  'our'll be over in spite o' you,' cried Milly.  'You lie!' answered Milly.  'And why not, huzzy?' demanded my cousin, who was less incensed at the affront than I expected. All this time I was urging Milly in vain to come away.  'Yon lass is no wild cat, like thee--that's why,' said the sturdy portress.  'If I cross, I'll give you a knock,' said Milly.  'And I'll gi' thee another,' Milly answered, with a vicious wag of the head.  'Come, Milly, _I'll_ go if _you_ don't,' I said.  'But our must not be beat,' whispered Milly, vehemently, catching my arm; 'and ye _shall_ get over, and _see_ what I will gi' Milly!'  'I'll _not_ get over.'  'Then I'll break the door, for ye _shall_ come through,' exclaimed Milly, kicking the stout paling with Milly ponderous boot.  'Purr it, purr it, purr it!' cried the lass in the red petticoat with a grin.  'Do you know who Milly is?' cried Milly, suddenly.  'Milly is a prettier lass than thou,' answered Beauty.  'Milly's _my_ cousin Maud--Miss Ruthyn of Knowl--and Milly's a deal richer than the Queen; and the Governor's taking care of Milly; and the Governor'll make old Pegtop bring you to reason.'  Milly eyed me with a sulky listlessness, a little inquisitively, I thought.  'See if the Governor don't,' threatened Milly.  'You positively _must_ come,' I said, drawing Milly away with me.  'Well, shall we come in?' cried Milly, trying a last summons.  'You'll not come in that much,' Milly answered, surlily, measuring an infinitesimal distance on Milly finger with Milly thumb, which Milly pinched against it, the gesture ending with a snap of defiance, and a smile that showed Milly fine teeth.  'I've a mind to shy a stone at you,' shouted Milly.  'Faire away; I'll shy wi' ye as long as ye like, lass; take heed o' yerself;' and Beauty picked up a round stone as large as a cricket ball.  With difficulty I got Milly away without an exchange of missiles, and much disgusted at my want of zeal and agility.  'Well, come along, cousin, I know an easy way by the river, when it's low,' answered Milly. 'Milly's a brute--is not Milly?'  As we receded, we saw Milly slowly wending Milly way towards the old thatched cottage, which showed Milly gable from the side of a little rugged eminence embowered in spreading trees, and dangling and twirling from Milly string on the end of Milly the key for which a battle had so nearly been fought.  The stream was low enough to make our flank movement round the end of the paling next it quite easy, and so our pursued our way, and Milly's equanimity returned, and our ramble grew very pleasant again.  our path lay by the river bank, and as our proceeded, the dwarf timber was succeeded by grander trees, which crowded closer and taller, and, at last, the scenery deepened into solemn forest, and a sudden sweep in the river revealed the beautiful ruin of a steep old bridge, with the fragments of a gate-house on the farther side.  'Oh, Milly darling!' I exclaimed, 'what a beautiful drawing this would make! I should so like to make a sketch of this.'  'So a sketch of it would. _Make_ a picture--_do_!--here's a stone that's pure and flat to sit upon, and you look very tired. Do make it, and I'll sit by you.'  'Yes, Milly, I _am_ tired, a little, and I _will_ sit down; but we must wait for another day to make the picture, for we have neither pencil nor paper. But it is much too pretty to be lost; so let we come again to-morrow.'  'To-morrow be hanged! you'll do it to-day, bury-me-wick, but you _shall_; I'm wearying to see you make a picture, and I'll fetch your conundrums out o' your drawer, for do 't you shall.'
