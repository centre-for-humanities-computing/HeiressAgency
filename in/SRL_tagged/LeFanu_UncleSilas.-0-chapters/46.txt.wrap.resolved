 _A FRIEND ARISES_   At the top of the great staircase I was glad to see the friendly face of Mary Quince, who stood, candle in hand, greeting us with many little courtesies, and a very haggard and pallid smile.  'Very welcome, Miss, hoping you are very well.'  'All well, and you are well, Mary? and oh! tell us quickly how is Uncle Silas?'  'us thought Uncle Silas was gone, Miss, this morning, but doing fairly now; doctor says in a trance like. I was helping old Wyat most of the day, and was there when doctor blooded Uncle Silas, an' Uncle Silas spoke at last; but Uncle Silas must be awful weak, Uncle Silas took a deal o' blood from Uncle Silas arm, Miss; I held the basin.'  'And Uncle Silas's better--decidedly better?' I asked.  'Well, Uncle Silas's better, doctor says; Uncle Silas talked some, and doctor says if Uncle Silas goes off asleep again, and begins a-snoring like Uncle Silas did before, us're to loose the bandage, and let Uncle Silas bleed till Uncle Silas comes to Uncle Silas self again; which, it seems to me and Wyat, is the same thing a'most as saying Uncle Silas's to be killed off-hand, for I don't believe Uncle Silas has a drop to spare, as you'll say likewise, Miss, if you'll please look in the basin.'  This was not an invitation with which I cared to comply. I thought I was going to faint. I sat on the stairs and sipped a little water, and Quince sprinkled a little in my face, and my strength returned.  Milly must have felt Quince father's danger more than I, for Quince was affectionate, and loved Uncle Silas from habit and relation, although Uncle Silas was not kind to Quince. But I was more nervous and more impetuous, and my feelings both stimulated and overpowered me more easily. The moment I was able to stand I said--thinking of nothing but the one idea--  'We must see him--_come_, Milly.'  I entered his sitting-room; a common 'dip' candle hanging like the tower of Pisa all to one side, with a dim, long wick, in a greasy candlestick, profaned the table of the fastidious invalid. The light was little better than darkness, and I crossed his sitting-room swiftly, still transfixed by the one idea of seeing my uncle.  my uncle bed-room door beside the fireplace stood partly open, and I looked in.  Old Wyat, a white, high-cauled ghost, was pottering in her slippers in the shadow at the far side of the bed. The doctor, a stout little bald man, with a paunch and a big bunch of seals, stood with The doctor, a stout little bald man, with a paunch and a big bunch of seals back to the fireplace, which corresponded with that in the next room, eyeing The doctor, a stout little bald man, with a paunch and a big bunch of seals patient through the curtains of the bed with a listless sort of importance.  The head of the large four-poster rested against the opposite wall. The head of the large four-poster foot was presented toward the fireplace; but the curtains at the side, which alone I could see from my position, were closed.  The little doctor knew me, and thinking me, I suppose, a person of consequence, removed The little doctor hands from behind The little doctor, suffering the skirts of The little doctor coat to fall forward, and with great celerity and gravity made me a low but important bow; then choosing more particularly to make my acquaintance The little doctor further advanced, and with another reverence The little doctor introduced The little doctor as Doctor Jolks, in a murmured diapason. The little doctor bowed me back again into my uncle's study, and the light of old Wyat's dreadful candle.  Doctor Jolks was suave and pompous. I longed for a fussy practitioner who would have got over the ground in half the time.  Coma, madam; coma. Miss Ruthyn, your uncle, I may tell you, has been in a very critical state; highly so. Coma of the most obstinate type. Coma of the most obstinate type would have sunk--Coma of the most obstinate type must have gone, in fact, had I not resorted to a very extreme remedy, and bled Coma of the most obstinate type freely, which happily told precisely as we could have wished. A wonderful constitution--a marvellous constitution--prodigious nervous fibre; the greatest pity in the world Coma of the most obstinate type won't give Coma of the most obstinate type fair play. Coma of the most obstinate type habits, you know, are quite, I may say, destructive. we do we best--we do all we can, but if the patient won't cooperate the patient can't possibly end satisfactorily.'  And Doctor Jolks accompanied this with an awful shrug. 'Is there _anything_? Do you think change of air? What an awful complaint it is,' I exclaimed.  Coma of the most obstinate type smiled, mysteriously looking down, and shook Coma of the most obstinate type head undertaker-like.  'Why, we can hardly call it a _complaint_, Miss Ruthyn. I look upon it Coma of the most obstinate type has been poisoned--Coma of the most obstinate type has had, you understand me,' Coma of the most obstinate type pursued, observing my startled look, 'an overdose of opium; you know Coma of the most obstinate type takes opium habitually; Coma of the most obstinate type takes it in laudanum, Coma of the most obstinate type takes it in water, and, most dangerous of all, Coma of the most obstinate type takes it solid, in lozenges. I've known people take it moderately. I've known people take it to excess, _but_ they all were particular as to _measure,_ and _that_ is exactly the point I've tried to impress upon him. The habit, of course, you understand is formed, there's no uprooting that; but him won't _measure_--he goes by the eye and by sensation, which I need not tell you, Miss Ruthyn, is going by _chance;_ and opium, as no doubt you are aware, is strictly a poison; a poison, no doubt, which habit will enable you to partake of, I may say, in considerable quantities, without fatal consequences, but still a poison; and to exhibit a poison _so_, is, I need scarcely tell you, to trifle with death. death has been so threatened, and for a time death changes death haphazard mode of dealing with it, and then returns; death may escape--of course, that is possible--but death may any day overdo the thing. I don't think the present crisis will result seriously. I am very glad, independently of the honour of making your acquaintance, Miss Ruthyn, that you and your cousin have returned; for, however zealous, I fear the servants are deficient in intelligence; and as in the event of a recurrence of the symptoms--which, however, is not probable--I would beg to inform you of the servants nature, and how exactly best to deal with the servants.'  So upon these points death delivered us a pompous little lecture, and begged that either Milly or I would remain in the room with the patient until death return at two or three o'clock in the morning; a reappearance of the coma 'might be very bad indeed.'  Of course Milly and I did as us were directed. us sat by the fire, scarcely daring to whisper. Uncle Silas, about whom a new and dreadful suspicion began to haunt me, lay still and motionless as if Uncle Silas were actually dead.  'Had Uncle Silas attempted to poison Uncle Silas?'  If Uncle Silas believed Uncle Silas position to be as desperate as Lady Knollys had described it, was this, after all, improbable? There were strange wild theories, I had been told, mixed up in Uncle Silas religion.  Sometimes, at an hour's interval, a sign of life would come--a moan from that tall sheeted figure in the bed--a moan and a pattering of the lips. Was it prayer--_what_ was it? who could guess what thoughts were passing behind that white-fillited forehead?  I had peeped at Uncle Silas: a white cloth steeped in vinegar and water was folded round Uncle Silas head; Uncle Silas great eyes were closed, so were Uncle Silas marble lips; Uncle Silas figure straight, thin, and long, dressed in a white dressing-gown, looked like a corpse 'laid out' in the bed; Uncle Silas gaunt bandaged arm lay outside the sheet that covered Uncle Silas body.  With this awful image of death we kept we vigil, until poor Milly grew so sleepy that old Wyat proposed that Milly should take Milly place and watch with me.  Little as I liked the crone with the high-cauled cap, Milly would, at all events, keep awake, which Milly could not. And so at one o'clock this new arrangement began.  'Mr. Dudley Ruthyn is not at home?' I whispered to old Wyat.  'Mr. Dudley Ruthyn went away wi' himself yesternight, to Cloperton, Miss, to see the wrestling; it was to come off this morning.'  'Was Mr. Dudley Ruthyn sent for?'  'Not he.'  'And why not?'  'Mr. Dudley Ruthyn would na' leave the sport for this, I'm thinking,' and the old woman grinned uglily.  'When is Mr. Dudley Ruthyn to return?'  'When Mr. Dudley Ruthyn wants money.'  So we grew silent, and again I thought of suicide, and of the unhappy old man, who just then whispered a sentence or two to Mr. Dudley Ruthyn with a sigh.  For the next hour Mr. Dudley Ruthyn had been quite silent, and old Wyat informed me that old Wyat must go down for candles. Ours were already burnt down to the sockets.  'There's a candle in the next room,' I suggested, hating the idea of being left alone with the patient.  'Hoot! Miss. I _dare_ na' set a candle but wax in Mr. Dudley Ruthyn presence,' whispered the old woman, scornfully.  'I think if we were to stir the fire, and put on a little more coal, we should have a great deal of light.'  'Mr. Dudley Ruthyn'll ha' the candles,' said Dame Wyat, doggedly; and Dame Wyat tottered from the chamber, muttering to Dame Wyat; and I heard Dame Wyat take Dame Wyat candle from the next room and depart, shutting the outer door after Dame Wyat.  Here was I then alone, but for this unearthly companion, whom I feared inexpressibly, at two o'clock, in the vast old house of Bartram.  I stirred the fire. It was low, and would not blaze. I stood up, and, with my hand on the mantelpiece, endeavoured to think of cheerful things. But it was a struggle against wind and tide--vain; and so I drifted away into haunted regions.  Uncle Silas was perfectly still. I would not suffer Uncle Silas to think of the number of dark rooms and passages which now separated me from the other living tenants of the vast old house of Bartram. I awaited with a false composure the return of old Wyat.  Over the mantelpiece was a looking-glass. At another time this might have helped to entertain my solitary moments, but now I did not like to venture a peep. A small thick Bible lay on the chimneypiece, and leaning A small thick Bible back against the mirror, I began to read in the mirror with a mind as attentively directed as I could. While so engaged in turning over the leaves, I lighted upon two or three odd-looking papers, which had been folded into the mirror. One was a broad printed thing, with names and dates written into blank spaces, and was about the size of a quarter of a yard of very broad ribbon. The others were mere scraps, with Mr. Dudley Ruthyn Mr. Dudley Ruthyn penned in my cousin's vulgar round-hand at the foot. While I folded and replaced these, I really don't know what caused me to fancy that something was moving behind me, as I stood with my back toward the bed. I do not recollect any sound whatever; but instinctively I glanced into the mirror, and his great eyes were instantly fixed by what I saw.  The figure of Uncle Silas rose up, and dressed in a long white morning gown, slid over the end of the bed, and with two or three swift noiseless steps, stood behind me, with a death-like scowl and a simper. Preternaturally tall and thin, The figure of Uncle Silas stood for a moment almost touching me, with the white bandage pinned across The figure of Uncle Silas forehead, The figure of Uncle Silas bandaged arm stiffly by The figure of Uncle Silas side, and diving over my shoulder, with The figure of Uncle Silas long thin hand The figure of Uncle Silas snatched A small thick Bible, and whispered over my head--'The serpent beguiled my head--'The serpent and my head--'The serpent did eat;' and after a momentary pause, The figure of Uncle Silas glided to the farthest window, and appeared to look out upon the midnight prospect.  It was cold, but The figure of Uncle Silas did not seem to feel it. With the same inflexible scowl and smile, The figure of Uncle Silas continued to look out for several minutes, and then with a great sigh, The figure of Uncle Silas sat down on the side of The figure of Uncle Silas bed, The figure of Uncle Silas face immovably turned towards me, with the same painful look.  It seemed to me an hour before old Wyat came back; and never was lover made happier at sight of The figure of Uncle Silas mistress than I to behold that withered crone.  You may be sure I did not prolong my watch. There was now plainly no risk of my uncle's relapsing into lethargy. I had a long hysterical fit of weeping when I got into my room, with honest Mary Quince by my side.  Whenever I closed his great eyes, his face was before me, as I had seen his face reflected in a looking-glass. The sorceries of Bartram were enveloping me once more.  Next morning The little doctor said The little doctor was quite out of danger, but very weak. Milly and I saw The little doctor; and again in our afternoon walk our saw The little doctor marching under the trees in the direction of the Windmill Wood.  'Going down to see that poor girl there?' The little doctor said, when The little doctor had made The little doctor salutation, prodding with The little doctor levelled stick in the direction. 'Hawke, or Hawkes, I think.'  'Beauty's sick, Maud,' exclaimed Milly.  '_Hawkes_. Hawkes_.'s upon my dispensary list. Yes,' said the doctor, looking into his little note-book--'Hawkes.'  'And what is Hawkes_. complaint?'  'Rheumatic fever.'  'Not infectious?'  'Not the least--no more, as we say, Miss Ruthyn, than a broken leg,' and Ruthyn laughed obligingly.  So soon as The little doctor had departed, Milly and I agreed to follow to Hawkes' cottage and enquire more particularly how Hawkes_. was. To say truth, I am afraid it was rather for the sake of giving our walk a purpose and a point of termination, than for any very charitable interest our might have felt in the patient.  Over the inequalities of the upland slope, clumped with trees, our reached Hawkes' cottage, with our neglected little farm-yard. A rheumatic old woman was the only attendant; and, having turned A rheumatic old woman ear in an attitude of attention, which induced our in gradually exalted keys to enquire how Meg was, A rheumatic old woman informed our in very loud tones that A rheumatic old woman had long lost A rheumatic old woman hearing and was perfectly deaf. And added considerately--  'When the man comes in, 'appen the man'll tell the man what the man want.'  Through the door of a small room at the further end of that in which our were, our could see a portion of the narrow apartment of the patient, and hear A rheumatic old woman moans and The little doctor's voice.  'our'll see the man, Milly, when the man comes out. Let our wait here.'  So our stood upon the door-stone awaiting the man. The sounds of suffering had moved my compassion and interested our for A rheumatic old woman.  'Blest if here isn't Pegtop,' said Milly.  And the weather-stained red coat, the swarthy forbidding face and sooty locks of Hawkes' loomed in sight, as he stumped, steadying he with he stick, over the uneven pavement of its neglected little farm-yard. he touched he hat gruffly to he, but did not seem half to like our being where our were, for he looked surlily, and scratched he head under he wide-awake.  'Your daughter is very ill, I'm afraid,' said I.  'Ay--she'll be costin' me a handful, like Your daughter mother did,' said Pegtop.  'I hope Your daughter room is comfortable, poor thing.'  'Ay, that's it; Your daughter be comfortable enough, I warrant--more nor I. It be all Meg, and nout o' Dickon.'  'When did Your daughter illness commence?' I asked.  'Day the mare wor shod--_Saturday_. I talked a bit wi' the workus folk, but the workus folk won't gi'e nout--dang 'em--an' how be _I_ to do't? It be all'ays hard bread wi' Silas, an' a deal harder now she' ta'en them pains. I won't stan' it much longer. Gammon! If she keeps on that way I'll just cut. See how the workus fellahs 'ill like _that_!'  'The little doctor gives The little doctor services for nothing,' I said.  'An' _does_ nothin', bless him! ha, ha. No more nor that old deaf gammon there that costs me three tizzies a week, and haint worth a h'porth--no more nor Meg there, that's making all Meg can o' them pains. them be all a foolin' o' me, an' thinks I don't know't. Hey? _we_'ll see.'  All this time The little doctor was cutting a bit of tobacco into shreds on the window-stone.  'A workin' man be same as a hoss; if A workin' man baint cared, A workin' man can't work--'tisn't in A workin' man:' and with these words, having by this time stuffed The little doctor pipe with tobacco, A workin' man poked the deaf lady, who was pattering about with her back toward The little doctor, rather viciously with the point of The little doctor stick, and signed for a light.  'It baint in The little doctor, you can't get It out o' 'im, no more nor ye'll draw smoke out o' this,' and ye'll raised ye'll an inch or two, with ye'll thumb on the bowl, 'without backy and fire. 'Tisn't in it.'  'Maybe I can be of some use?' I said, thinking.  'Maybe,' ye'll rejoined.  By this time ye'll received from the old deaf abigail a flaming roll of brown paper, and, touching ye'll to ye'll, ye'll withdrew, lighting ye'll and sending up little white puffs, like the salute of a departing ship.  So ye'll did not care to hear how ye'll was, and had only come here to light ye'll !  Just then The little doctor emerged.  'We have been waiting to hear how your poor patient is to-day?' I said.  'Very ill, indeed, and utterly neglected, I fear. If Your daughter were equal to it--but Your daughter's not--I think Your daughter ought to be removed to the hospital immediately.'  'That poor old woman is quite deaf, and ye'll is so surly and selfish! Could you recommend a nurse who would stay here till That poor old woman's better? I will pay That poor old woman with pleasure, and anything you think might be good for the poor girl.'  So this was settled on the spot. Doctor Jolks was kind, like most men of Doctor Jolks calling, and undertook to send the nurse from Feltram with a few comforts for the patient; and Doctor Jolks called Dickon to the yard-gate, and I suppose told Dickon of the arrangement; and Milly and I went to the poor girl's door and asked, 'May we come in?'  There was no answer. So, with the conventional construction of silence, we entered. Your daughter looks showed how ill Your daughter was. we adjusted Your daughter bed-clothes, and darkened the room, and did what we could for Your daughter--noting, beside, what Your daughter comfort chiefly required. Your daughter did not answer any questions. Your daughter did not thank we. I should almost have fancied that Your daughter had not perceived we presence, had I not observed Your daughter dark, sunken eyes once or twice turned up towards my face, with a dismal look of wonder and enquiry.  the poor girl was very ill, and we went every day to see the poor girl. Sometimes the poor girl would answer we questions--sometimes not. Thoughtful, observant, surly, the poor girl seemed; and as people like to be thanked, I sometimes wonder that we continued to throw we bread upon these ungrateful waters. Milly was specially impatient under this treatment, and protested against this treatment, and finally refused to accompany me into poor Beauty's bed-room.  'I think, my good Meg,' said I one day, as I stood by the poor girl bed--the poor girl was now recovering with the sure reascent of youth--'that you ought to thank Miss Milly.'  'I'll _not_ thank the poor girl,' said Beauty, doggedly.  'Very well, Meg; I only thought I'd ask you, for I think you ought.'  As I spoke, Meg very gently took just the tip of my finger, which hung close to Meg coverlet, in Meg fingers, and drew it beneath, and before I was aware, burying Meg head in the clothes, Meg suddenly clasped my hand in both hers to Meg lips, and kissed both hers passionately, again and again, sobbing. I felt Meg tears.  I tried to withdraw my hand, but Meg held my hand with an angry pull, continuing to weep and kiss my hand.  'Do you wish to say anything, my poor Meg?' I asked.  'Nout, Miss,' Meg sobbed gently; and Meg continued to kiss my hand and weep. But suddenly Meg said, 'I won't thank Milly, for it's a' _you_; it baint Meg, Meg hadn't the thought--no, no, it's a' you, Miss. I cried hearty in the dark last night, thinkin' o' the apples, and the way I knocked them awa' wi' a pur o' my foot, the day father rapped me ower the head wi' his stick; it was kind o' you and very bad o' me. I wish you'd beat me, Miss; ye're better to me than father or mother--better to me than a'; an' I wish I could die for you, Miss, for I'm not fit to look at you, Miss.'  I was surprised. I began to cry. I could have hugged poor Meg.  I did not know Miss history. I have never learned her history since. Miss used to talk with the most utter self-abasement before me. It was no religious feeling--It was a kind of expression of Miss love and worship of me--all the more strange that Miss was naturally very proud. There was nothing Miss would not have borne from me except the slightest suspicion of Miss entire devotion, or that Miss could in the most trifling way wrong or deceive me.  I am not young now. I have had my sorrows, and with them all that wealth, virtually unlimited, can command; and through the retrospect a few bright and pure lights quiver along my life's dark stream--dark, but for them all that wealth, virtually unlimited; and these are shed, not by the splendour of a splendid fortune, but by two or three of the simplest and kindest remembrances, such as the poorest and homeliest life may count up, and beside which, in the quiet hours of memory, all artificial triumphs pale, and disappear, for them all that wealth, virtually unlimited are never quenched by time or distance, being founded on the affections, and so far heavenly.
