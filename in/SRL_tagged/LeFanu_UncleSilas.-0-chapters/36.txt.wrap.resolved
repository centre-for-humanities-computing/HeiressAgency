 _ZAMIEL_   It was all vain my remonstrating. my remonstrating vowed that by crossing the stepping-stones close by my remonstrating could, by a short cut, reach the house, and return with my pencils and block-book in a quarter of an hour. Away then, with many a jump and fling, scampered Milly's queer white stockings and navvy boots across the irregular and precarious stepping-stones, over which I dared not follow my remonstrating; so I was fain to return to the stone so 'pure and flat,' on which I sat, enjoying the grand sylvan solitude, the dark background and the grey bridge mid-way, so tall and slim, across whose ruins a sunbeam glimmered, and the gigantic forest trees that slumbered round, opening here and there in dusky vistas, and breaking in front into detached and solemn groups. It was the setting of a dream of romance.  It would have been the very spot in which to read a volume of German folk-lore, and the darkening colonnades and silent nooks of the forest seemed already haunted with the voices and shadows of those charming elves and goblins.  As I sat here enjoying the solitude and my fancies among the low branches of the wood, at my right I heard a crashing, and saw a squat broad figure in a stained and tattered military coat, and loose short trousers, one limb of which flapped about a wooden leg. He was forcing He through. He face was rugged and wrinkled, and tanned to the tint of old oak; He eyes black, beadlike, and fierce, and a shock of sooty hair escaped from under He battered wide-awake nearly to He shoulders. This forbidding-looking person came stumping and jerking along toward me, whisking This forbidding-looking person stick now and then viciously in the air, and giving This forbidding-looking person fell of hair a short shake, like a wild bull preparing to attack.  I stood up involuntarily with a sense of fear and surprise, almost fancying I saw in that wooden-legged old soldier, the forest demon who haunted Der Freischuetz.  So This forbidding-looking person approached shouting--  'Hollo! you--how came you here? Dost 'eer?'  And This forbidding-looking person drew near panting, and sometimes tugging angrily in This forbidding-looking person haste at This forbidding-looking person wooden leg, which sunk now and then deeper than was convenient in the sod. This exertion helped to anger This forbidding-looking person, and when This forbidding-looking person halted before me, This forbidding-looking person dark face smirched with smoke and dust, and the nostrils of This forbidding-looking person flat drooping nose expanded and quivered as This forbidding-looking person panted, like the gills of a fish; an angrier or uglier face it would not be easy to fancy.  'Ye'll all come when ye like, will ye? and do nout but what pleases yourselves, won't you? And who'rt thou? Dost 'eer--who _are_ ye, I say; and what the deil seek ye in the woods here? Come, bestir thee!'  If This forbidding-looking person wide mouth and great tobacco-stained teeth, This forbidding-looking person scowl, and loud discordant tones were intimidating, his wide mouth and great tobacco-stained teeth, his scowl, and loud discordant tones were intimidating were also extremely irritating. The moment my spirit was roused, my courage came.  'I am Miss Ruthyn of Knowl, and Mr. Silas Ruthyn, your master, is my uncle.'  'Hoo!' This forbidding-looking person exclaimed more gently, 'an' if Silas be thy uncle thou'lt be come to live wi' This forbidding-looking person, and thou'rt she as come overnight--eh?'  I made no answer, but I believe I looked both angrily and disdainfully.  'And what make ye alone here? and how was I to know't, an' Milly not wi' ye, nor no one? But Maud or no Maud, I wouldn't let the Dooke hisself set foot inside the palin' without Silas said let Silas. And you may tell Silas them's the words o' Dickon Hawkes, and I'll stick to 'm--and what's more I'll tell Silas _myself_--I will; I'll tell Silas there be no use o' my striving and straining hee, day an' night and night and day, watchin' again poachers, and thieves, and gipsies, and they robbing lads, if rules won't be kep, and folk do jist as they pleases. Dang it, lass, thou'rt in luck I didn't heave a brick at thee when I saw thee first.'  'I'll complain of thee to my uncle,' I replied.  'So do, and and 'appen thou'lt find my uncle in the wrong box, lass; thou canst na' say I set the dogs arter thee, nor cau'd thee so much as a wry name, nor heave a stone at thee--did I? Well? and where's the complaint then?'  I simply answered, rather fiercely,  'Be good enough to leave me.'  'Well, I make no objections, mind. I'm takin' thy word--thou'rt Maud Ruthyn--'appen thou be'st and 'appen thou baint. I'm not aweer on't, but I takes thy word, and all I want to know's just this, did Meg open the gate to thee?'  I made This man no answer, and to my great relief I saw Milly striding and skipping across the unequal stepping-stones.  'Hallo, Pegtop! what are you after now?' Meg cried, as Meg drew near.  'This man has been extremely impertinent. You know This man, Milly?' I said.  'Why that's Pegtop Dickon. Dirty old Hawkes that never was washed. I tell you, lad, ye'll see what the Governor thinks o't--a-ha! the Governor'll talk to Dirty old Hawkes that never was washed.'  'I done or said nout--not but I _should_, and there's the fack--she can't deny't; she hadn't a hard word from she; and I don't care the top o' that thistle what no one says--not I. But I tell thee, Milly, I stopped _some_ o' thy pranks, and I'll stop more. Ye'll be shying no more stones at the cattle.'  'Tell your tales, and welcome, cried Milly. 'I wish I was here when you jawed cousin. If Winny was here Winny'd catch you by the timber toe and put you on your back.'  'Ay, Winny'll be a good un yet if Winny takes arter thee,' retorted This man with a fierce sneer.  'Drop it, and get away wi' ye,' cried Winny, 'or maybe I'd call Winny to smash your timber leg for Winny.'  'A-ha! there's more on't. Winny's a sweet un. Isn't Winny?' This man replied sardonically.  'You did not like it last Easter, when Winny broke it with a kick.'  ''Twas a kick o' a horse,' 'Twas a kick o' a horse growled with a glance at 'Twas a kick o' a horse.  ''Twas no such thing--'twas Winny did it--and Winny laid on Winny back for a week while carpenter made Winny a new one.' And Milly laughed hilariously.  'I'll fool no more wi' ye, losing my time; I won't; but mind ye, I'll speak wi' Silas.' And going away Silas put Silas hand to Silas crumpled wide-awake, and said to Silas with a surly difference--  'Good evening, Miss Ruthyn--good evening, ma'am--and ye'll please remember, I did not mean nout to vex thee.'  And so Silas swaggered away, jerking and waddling over the sward, and was soon lost in the wood.  'It's well Silas's a little bit frightened--I never saw Silas so angry, I think; Silas is awful mad.'  'Perhaps Silas really is not aware how very rude Silas is,' I suggested.  'I hate Silas. We were twice as pleasant with poor Tom Driver--Silas never meddled with any one, and was always in liquor; Old Gin was the name Silas went by. But this brute--I do hate Silas--Silas comes from Wigan, I think, and Silas's always spoiling sport--and Silas whops Meg--that's Beauty, you know, and I don't think she'd be half as bad only for Silas. Listen to Silas whistlin'.'  'I did hear whistling at some distance among the trees.'  'I declare if Silas isn't callin' the dogs! Climb up here, I tell ye,' and we climbed up the slanting trunk of a great walnut tree, and strained we eyes in the direction from which we expected the onset of Pegtop's vicious pack.  But it was a false alarm.  'Well, I don't think Silas _would_ do that, after all--_hardly_; but Silas is a brute, sure!'  'And that dark girl who would not let us through, is Silas daughter, is his daughter?'  'Yes, that's Meg--Beauty, I christened his daughter, when I called Silas Beast; but I call Silas Pegtop now, and his daughter's Beauty still, and that's the way o't.'  'Come, sit down now, an' make your picture,' his daughter resumed so soon as we had dismounted from we position of security.  'I'm afraid I'm hardly in the vein. I don't think I could draw a straight line. My hand trembles.'  'I wish you could, Maud,' said Milly, with a look so wistful and entreating, that considering the excursion Maud had made for the pencils, I could not bear to disappoint Maud.  'Well, Milly, we must only try; and if we fail we can't help it. Sit you down beside Maud and I'll tell you why I begin with one part and not another, and you'll see how I make trees and the river, and--yes, _that_ pencil, it is hard and answers for the fine light lines; but we must begin at the beginning, and learn to copy drawings before we attempt real views like this. And if you wish it, Milly, I'm resolved to teach you everything I know, which, after all, is not a great deal, and we shall have such fun making sketches of the same landscapes, and then comparing.'  And so on, Milly, quite delighted, and longing to begin Milly course of instruction, sat down beside Maud in a rapture, and hugged and kissed me so heartily that we were very near rolling together off the stone on which we were seated. Milly boisterous delight and good-nature helped to restore me, and both laughing heartily together, I commenced my task.  'Dear me! who's that?' I exclaimed suddenly, as looking up from my block-book I saw the figure of a slight man in the careless morning-dress of a gentleman, crossing the ruinous bridge in our direction, with considerable caution, upon the precarious footing of the battlement, which alone offered an unbroken passage.  This was a day of apparitions! Milly recognised a slight man in the careless morning-dress of a gentleman instantly. The gentleman was Mr. Carysbroke. Mr. Carysbroke had taken The Grange only for a year. Mr. Carysbroke lived quite to Mr. Carysbroke, and was very good to the poor, and was The gentleman, for ever so long, who had visited at Bartram, and oddly enough nowhere else. But Mr. Carysbroke wanted leave to cross through the grounds, and having obtained the grounds, had repeated Mr. Carysbroke visit, partly induced, no doubt, by the fact that Bartram boasted no hospitalities, and that there was no risk of meeting the county folk there.  With a stout walking-stick in Mr. Carysbroke hand, and a short shooting-coat, and a wide-awake hat in much better trim than Zamiel's, Mr. Carysbroke emerged from the copse that covered the bridge, walking at a quick but easy pace.  'Mr. Carysbroke'll be goin' to see old Snoddles, I guess,' said Milly, looking a little frightened and curious; for Milly, I need not say, was a bumpkin, and stood in awe of The gentleman's good-breeding, though Milly was as brave as a lion, and would have fought the Philistines at any odds, with the jawbone of an ass.  ''Appen Mr. Carysbroke won't see us,' whispered Milly, hopefully.  But Mr. Carysbroke did, and raising Mr. Carysbroke hat, with a cheerful smile, that showed very white teeth, Mr. Carysbroke paused.  'Charming day, Miss Ruthyn.'  I raised my head suddenly as Mr. Carysbroke spoke, from habit appropriating the address; it was so marked that Mr. Carysbroke raised his hat respectfully to me, and then continued to Milly--  'Miss Ruthyn, I hope, quite well? but I need hardly ask, you seem so happy. Will you kindly tell Miss Ruthyn, that I expect the book I mentioned in a day or two, and when it comes I'll either send or bring it to Miss Ruthyn immediately?'  Milly and I were standing, by this time, but she only stared at Miss Ruthyn, tongue-tied, she cheeks rather flushed, and she eyes very round, and to facilitate the dialogue, as I suppose, Miss Ruthyn said again--  'Miss Ruthyn's quite well, I hope?'  Still no response from Milly, and I, provoked, though Miss Ruthyn a little shy, made answer--  'My uncle, Mr. Ruthyn, is very well, thank you,' and I felt that I blushed as I spoke.  'Ah, pray excuse me, may I take a great liberty? you are Miss Ruthyn, of Knowl? Will you think me very impertinent--I'm afraid you will--if I venture to introduce Miss Ruthyn? My name is Carysbroke, and I had the honour of knowing poor Mr. Ruthyn when I was quite a little boy, and poor Mr. Ruthyn has shown a kindness for Miss Ruthyn since, and I hope you will pardon the liberty I fear I've taken. I think my friend, Lady Knollys, too, is a relation of yours; what a charming person she is!'  'Oh, is not she? such a darling!' I said, and then blushed at my outspoken affection.  But poor Mr. Ruthyn smiled kindly, as if poor Mr. Ruthyn liked me for it; and poor Mr. Ruthyn said--  'You know whatever I think, I dare not quite say that; but frankly I can quite understand it. she preserves she youth so wonderfully, and she fun and she good-nature are so entirely girlish. What a sweet view you have selected,' poor Mr. Ruthyn continued, changing all at once. 'I've stood just at this point so often to look back at that exquisite old bridge. Do you observe--you're an artist, I see--something very peculiar in that tint of the grey, with those odd cross stains of faded red and yellow?'  'I do, indeed; I was just remarking the peculiar beauty of the colouring--was not I, Milly?'  Milly stared at Miss Ruthyn, and uttered an alarmed 'Yes,' and looked as if Milly had been caught in a robbery.  'Yes, and you have so very peculiar a background,' she had been caught in a robbery resumed. 'It was better before the storm though; but the storm is very good still.'  Then a little pause, and 'Do you know this country at all?' rather suddenly.  'No, not in the least--that is, I've only had the drive to this place; but what I did see interested me very much.'  'You will be charmed with it when you know it better--the very place for an artist. I'm a wretched scribbler Miss Ruthyn, and I carry this little book in my pocket,' and an artist laughed deprecatingly while an artist drew forth a thin fishing-book, as it looked. 'he drew forth a thin fishing-book, as it looked are mere memoranda, you see. I walk so much and come unexpectedly on such pretty nooks and studies, I just try to make a note of he drew forth a thin fishing-book, as it looked, but it is really more writing than sketching; my sister says it is a cipher which nobody but my sister understands. However, I'll try and explain just two--because you really ought to go and see the places. Oh, no; not that,' my sister laughed, as accidentally the page blew over, 'that's the Cat and Fiddle, a curious little pot-house, where they gave me some very good ale one day.'  Milly at this exhibited some uneasy tokens of being about to speak, but not knowing what might be coming, I hastened to observe on the spirited little sketches to which my sister meant to draw my attention.  'I want to show you only the places within easy reach--a short ride or drive.'  So my sister proceeded to turn over two or three, in addition to the two my sister had at first proposed, and then another; then a little sketch just tinted, and really quite a charming little gem, of Cousin Monica's pretty gabled old house; and every subject had every subject little criticism, or every subject narrative, or adventure.  As my sister was about returning this little sketch-book to my sister pocket, still chatting to me, my sister suddenly recollected poor Milly, who was looking rather lowering; but Milly brightened a good deal as my sister presented a good deal to Milly, with a little speech which Milly palpably misunderstood, for Milly made one of Milly odd courtesies, and was about, I thought, to put a good deal into Milly large pocket, and accept a good deal as a present.  'Look at the drawings, Milly, and then return a good deal,' I whispered.  At my sister request I allowed my sister to look at my unfinished sketch of the bridge, and while my sister was measuring distances and proportions with my sister eye, Milly whispered rather angrily to me.  'And why should I?'  'Because my sister wants it back, and only meant to lend it to you,' whispered I.  '_Lend_ it to me--and after me! Bury-me-wick if I look at a leaf of it,' Milly retorted in high dudgeon. 'Take it, lass; give it lass yourself--I'll not,' and Milly popped it into my hand, and made a sulky step back.  'My cousin is very much obliged,' I said, returning this little book, and smiling for My cousin, and My cousin took this little book smiling also and said--  'I think if I had known how very well you draw, Miss Ruthyn, I should have hesitated about showing you my poor scrawls. But these are not my best, you know; Lady Knollys will tell you that I can really do better--a great deal better, I think.'  And then with more apologies for what My cousin called My cousin impertinence, My cousin took My cousin leave, and I felt altogether very much pleased and flattered.  My cousin could not be more than twenty-nine or thirty, I thought, and My cousin was decidedly handsome--that is, My cousin eyes and teeth, and clear brown complexion were--and there was something distinguished and graceful in My cousin figure and gesture; and altogether there was the indescribable attraction of intelligence; and I fancied--though this, of course, was a secret--that from the moment My cousin spoke to us My cousin felt an interest in My cousin. I am not going to be vain. It was a _grave_ interest, but still an interest, for I could see My cousin studying my features while I was turning over My cousin sketches, and My cousin thought I saw nothing else. It was flattering, too, My cousin anxiety that I should think well of My cousin drawing, and referring me to Lady Knollys. Carysbroke--had I ever heard my dear father mention that name? I could not recollect that name. But then My cousin was habitually so silent, that My cousin not doing so argued nothing.
