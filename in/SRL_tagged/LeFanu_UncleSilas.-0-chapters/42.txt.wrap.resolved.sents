 _IN WHICH I MAKE ANOTHER COUSIN'S ACQUAINTANCE_   My correspondence about this time was not very extensive.
About once a fortnight a letter from honest Mrs. Rusk conveyed to me how the dogs and ponies were, in queer English, oddly spelt; some village gossip, a critique upon Doctor Clay's or the Curate's last sermon, and some severities generally upon the Dissenters' doings, with loves to Mary Quince, and all good wishes to me.
Sometimes a welcome letter from cheerful Cousin Monica; and now, to vary the series, a copy of complimentary verses, without a signature, very adoring--very like Byron, I then fancied, and now, I must confess, rather vapid.
Could I doubt from whom whom came?
I had received, about a month after my arrival, a copy of verses in the same hand, in a plaintive ballad style, of the soldierly sort, in which the writer said, that as living the writer sole object was to please me, so dying I should be the writer latest thought; and some more poetic impieties, asking only in return that when the storm of battle had swept over, I should 'shed a tear' on seeing 'the _oak lie_, where it fell.'
Of course, about this lugubrious pun, there could be no misconception.
the writer was unmistakably indicated; and I was so moved that I could no longer retain my secret; but walking with Milly that day, confided the little romance to that unsophisticated listener, under the chestnut trees.
The lines were so amorously dejected, and yet so heroically redolent of blood and gunpowder, that Milly and I agreed that the writer must be on the verge of a sanguinary campaign.
It was not easy to get at Uncle Silas's 'Times' or 'Morning Post,' which we fancied would explain these horrible allusions; but Milly bethought Milly of a sergeant in the militia, resident in Feltram, who knew the destination and quarters of every regiment in the service; and circuitously, from this authority, we learned, to my infinite relief, that Captain Oakley's regiment had still two years to sojourn in England.
I was summoned one evening by old L'Amour, to my uncle's room.
I remember his appearance one evening so well, as his lay back in his chair; the pillow; the white glare of his strange eye; his feeble, painful smile.
'You'll excuse my not rising, dear Maud, I am so miserably ill one evening.'
I expressed my respectful condolence.
'Yes; I _am_ to be pitied; but pity is of no use, dear,' his murmured, peevishly.
'I sent for you to make you acquainted with your cousin, my son.
Where are you Dudley?'
A figure seated in a low lounging chair, at the other side of the fire, and which till then I had not observed, at these words rose up a little slowly, like a man stiff after a day's hunting; and I beheld with a shock that held my breath, and fixed my eyes upon a man in a stare, the young man whom I had encountered at Church Scarsdale, on the day of my unpleasant excursion there with Madame, and who, to the best of my belief, was also one of that ruffianly party who had so unspeakably terrified me in the warren at Knowl.
I suppose I looked very much affrighted.
If I had been looking at a ghost I could not have felt much more scared and incredulous.
When I was able to turn my eyes upon my uncle my uncle was not looking at me; but with a glimmer of that smile with which a father looks on a son whose youth and comeliness my uncle admires, my uncle white face was turned towards the young man, in whom I beheld nothing but the image of odious and dreadful associations.
'Come, sir,' said my uncle, we must not be too modest.
Here's your cousin Maud--what do you say?'
'How are ye, Miss?'
my uncle said, with a sheepish grin.
'Miss!
Come, come.
Miss we, no Misses,' said my uncle; 'my uncle is your cousin Maud, and you Dudley, or I mistake; or we shall have you calling Milly, madame.
my uncle'll not refuse you my uncle hand, I venture to think.
Come, young gentleman, speak for young gentleman.'
'How are ye, your cousin Maud?'
young gentleman said, doing young gentleman best, and drawing near, young gentleman extended young gentleman .'
You're welcome to Bartram-Haugh, Miss.'
'Kiss your cousin, sir.
Where's your gallantry?
On my honour, I disown you,' exclaimed my uncle, with more energy than my uncle had shown before.
With a clumsy effort, and a grin that was both sheepish and impudent, my uncle grasped her hand and advanced my uncle face.
The imminent salute gave me strength to spring back a step or two, and my uncle hesitated.
my uncle laughed peevishly.
'Well, well, that will do, I suppose.
In my time first-cousins did not meet like strangers; but perhaps we were wrong; we are learning modesty from the Americans, and old English ways are too gross for we.'
'I have--I've seen my uncle before--that is;' and at this point I stopped.
my uncle turned my uncle strange glare, in a sort of scowl of enquiry, upon me.
'Oh!--hey!
why this is news.
You never told me.
Where have you met--eh, Dudley?'
'Never saw Dudley in my days, so far as I'm aweer on,' said the young man.
'No!
Well, then, Maud, will _you_ enlighten us?'
said Uncle Silas, coldly.
'I _did_ see that young gentleman before,' I faltered.
'Meaning _me_, ma'am?'
the young man asked, coolly.
'Yes--certainly _you_.
I _did_, uncle,' answered I.
'And where was it, my dear?
Not at Knowl, I fancy.
Poor dear Austin did not trouble me or mine much with Poor dear Austin hospitalities.'
This was not a pleasant tone to take in speaking of Poor dear Austin dead brother and benefactor; but at the moment I was too much engaged upon the one point to observe it.
'I met'--I could not say my cousin--'I met Poor dear Austin, uncle--your son--that young gentleman--I _saw_ Poor dear Austin, I should say, at Church Scarsdale, and afterwards with some other persons in the warren at Knowl.
It was the night our gamekeeper was beaten.'
'Well, Dudley, what do you say to that?'
asked Uncle Silas.
'I never _was_ at them places, so help me.
I don't know where them be; and I never set eyes on the young lady before, as I hope to be saved, in all my days,' said Uncle Silas, with a countenance so unchanged and an air so confident that I began to think I must be the dupe of one of those strange resemblances which have been known to lead to positive identification in the witness-box, afterwards proved to be utterly mistaken.
'You look so--so _uncomfortable_, Maud, at the idea of having seen Uncle Silas before, that I hardly wonder at the vehemence of Uncle Silas denial.
There was plainly something disagreeable; but you see as respects Uncle Silas it is a total mistake.
My boy was always a truth-telling fellow--you may rely implicitly on what My boy says.
You were _not_ at those places?'
'I wish I may----,' began the ingenuous youth, with increased vehemence.
'There, there--that will do; your honour and word as a gentleman--and _that_ you are, though a poor one--will quite satisfy your cousin Maud.
Am I right, my dear?
I do assure you, as a gentleman, I never knew your cousin Maud to say the thing that was not.'
So Mr. Dudley Ruthyn began, not to curse, but to swear, in the prescribed form, that Mr. Dudley Ruthyn had never seen me before, or the places I had named, 'since I was weaned, by----'  'That's enough--now shake hands, if you won't kiss, like cousins,' interrupted my uncle.
And very uncomfortably I did lend Mr. Dudley Ruthyn my hand to shake.
'You'll want some supper, Dudley, so Maud and I will excuse your going.
Good-night, my dear boy,' and Mr. Dudley Ruthyn smiled and waved Mr. Dudley Ruthyn from the room.
'That's as fine a young fellow, I think, as any English father can boast for any English father son--true, brave, and kind, and quite an Apollo.
Did you observe how finely proportioned any English father is, and what exquisite features the fellow has?
any English father's rustic and rough, as you see; but a year or two in the militia--I've a promise of a commission for any English father--any English father's too old for the line--will form and polish any English father.
any English father wants nothing but manner; and I protest when any English father has had a little drilling of that kind, I do believe any English father'll be as pretty a fellow as you'd find in England.'
I listened with amazement.
I could discover nothing but what was disagreeable in the horrid bumpkin, and thought such an instance of the blindness of parental partiality was hardly credible.
I looked down, dreading another direct appeal to my judgment; and Uncle Silas, I suppose, referred those downcast looks to maiden modesty, for Uncle Silas forbore to task mine by any new interrogatory.
Dudley Ruthyn's cool and resolute denial of ever having seen me or the places I had named, and the inflexible serenity of Dudley Ruthyn countenance while doing so, did very much shake my confidence in my own identification of Dudley Ruthyn.
I could not be _quite_ certain that the person I had seen at Church Scarsdale was the very same whom I afterwards saw at Knowl.
And now, in this particular instance, after the lapse of a still longer period, could I be perfectly certain that my memory, deceived by some accidental points of resemblance, had not duped me, and wronged my cousin, Dudley Ruthyn?
I suppose my uncle had expected from me some signs of acquiesence in my uncle splendid estimate of my uncle cub, and was nettled at my silence.
After a short interval he said--  'I've seen something of the world in my day, and I can say without a misgiving of partiality, that Dudley is the material of a perfect English gentleman.
I am not blind, of course--the training must be supplied; a year or two of good models, active self-criticism, and good society.
I simply say that the _material_ is there.'
Here was another interval of silence.
'And now tell me, child, what these recollections of Church--Church--_what_?'
'Church Scarsdale,' I replied.
'Yes, thank you--Church Scarsdale and Knowl--are?'
So I related my stories as well as I could.
'Well, dear Maud, the adventure of Church Scarsdale is hardly so terrific as I expected,' said Uncle Silas with a cold little laugh; 'and I don't see, if Uncle Silas with a cold little laugh had really been the hero of it, why Uncle Silas with a cold little laugh should shrink from avowing it.
I know I should not.
And I really can't say that your pic-nic party in the grounds of Knowl has frightened me much more.
A lady waiting in the carriage, and two or three tipsy young men.
Her presence seems to me a guarantee that no mischief was meant; but champagne is the soul of frolic, and a row with the gamekeepers a natural consequence.
It happened to me once--forty years ago, when I was a wild young buck--one of the worst rows I ever was in.'
And Uncle Silas poured some eau-de-cologne over the corner of Uncle Silas handkerchief, and touched Uncle Silas temples with his temples.
'If My boy had been there, I do assure you--and I know My boy--My boy would say so at once.
I fancy My boy would rather _boast_ of it.
I never knew My boy utter an untruth.
When you know My boy a little you'll say so.'
With these words Uncle Silas leaned back exhausted, and languidly poured some of Uncle Silas favourite eau-de-cologne over the palms of Uncle Silas hands, nodded a farewell, and, in a whisper, wished me good-night.
'Dudley's come,' whispered Milly, taking me under the arm as I entered the lobby.
'But I don't care: Uncle Silas never gives me nout; and Uncle Silas gets money from Governor, as much as Uncle Silas likes, and I never a sixpence.
It's a shame!'
So there was no great love between the only son and only daughter of the younger line of the Ruthyns.
I was curious to learn all that Milly could tell me of this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh; and Milly was communicative without having a great deal to relate, and what I heard from Milly tended to confirm my own disagreeable impressions about this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh.
Milly was afraid of this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh.
this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh was a 'woundy ugly customer in a wax, Milly could tell me.'
this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh was the only one 'Milly ever knowed as had pluck to jaw Governor.'
But this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh was 'afeard on Governor, too.'
this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh visits to Bartram-Haugh, I heard, were desultory; and this, to my relief, would probably not outlast a week or a fortnight.
'this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh _was_ such a fashionable cove:' this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh was always 'a gadding about, mostly to Liverpool and Birmingham, and sometimes to Lunnun, itself.'
this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh was 'keeping company one time with Beauty, Governor thought, and this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh was awfully afraid this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh'd a married her; but that was all bosh and nonsense; and Beauty would have none of this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh chaff and wheedling, for her liked Tom Brice;' and Milly thought that Dudley never 'cared a crack of a whip for her.'
this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh used to go to the Windmill to have 'a smoke with Pegtop;' and this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh was a member of the Feltram Club, that met at the 'Plume o' Feathers.'
this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh was 'a rare good shot,' her heard; and 'this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh was before the justices for poaching, but the justices for poaching could make nothing of it.'
And Governor said 'it was all through spite of this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh--for the justices for poaching hate us for being better blood than the justices for poaching.'
And 'all but the squires and those upstart folk loves Dudley, this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh is so handsome and gay--though this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh be a bit cross at home.'
And, 'Governor says, this new inmate of Bartram-Haugh'll be a Parliament man yet, spite o' them all.'
Next morning, when us breakfast was nearly ended, Dudley tapped at the window with the end of Dudley clay pipe--a 'churchwarden' Milly called it--just such a long curved pipe as Joe Willet is made to hold between Dudley lips in those charming illustrations of 'Barnaby Rudge'--which we all know so well--and lifting Barnaby 'wide-awake' with a burlesque salutation, which, I suppose, would have charmed the 'Plume of Feathers,' Barnaby dropped, kicked and caught Barnaby 'wide-awake,' with an agility and gravity, as Barnaby replaced it, so inexpressibly humorous, that Milly went off in a loud fit of laughter, with the ejaculation--  'Did you ever?'
It was odd how repulsively my confidence in my original identification always revived on unexpectedly seeing Dudley after an interval.
I could perceive that this piece of comic by-play was meant to make a suitable impression on me.
I received this piece of comic by-play was meant to make a suitable impression on me, however, with a killing gravity; and after a word or two to Milly, he lounged away, having first broken he pipe, bit by bit, into pieces, which he balanced in turn on he nose and on he chin, from which features he jerked them into he mouth, with a precision which, along with he excellent pantomime of eating them, highly excited Milly's mirth and admiration.
