 _WE VISIT A ROOM IN THE SECOND STOREY_   Mr. Carysbroke amused my fancy sufficiently to prevent my observing Milly's silence, till we had begun we return homeward.  'The Grange must be a pretty house, if that little sketch be true; is that little sketch far from this?'  ''Twill be two mile.'  'Are you vexed, Milly?' I asked, for both Milly tone and looks were angry.  'Yes, I am vexed; and why not lass?'  'What has happened?'  'Well, now, that is rich! Why, look at that fellow, Mr. Carysbroke: that fellow took no more notice to me than a dog, and kep' talking to you all the time of that fellow pictures, and that fellow walks, and that fellow people. Why, a pig's better manners than that.'  'But, Milly dear, you forget, that fellow tried to talk to you, and you would not answer that fellow,' I expostulated.  'And is not that just what I say--I can't talk like other folk--ladies, I mean. Every one laughs at me; an' I'm dressed like a show, I am. It's a shame! I saw Polly Shives--what a lady what a lady is, my eyes!--laughing at me in church last Sunday. I was minded to give what a lady a bit of my mind. An' I know I'm queer. It's a shame, It is. Why should _I_ be so rum? it is a shame! I don't want to be so, nor it isn't my fault.'  And poor Milly broke into a flood of tears, and stamped on the ground, and buried Milly face in Milly short frock, which Milly whisked up to Milly eyes; and an odder figure of grief I never beheld.  'And I could not make head or tail of what he was saying,' cried poor Milly through Milly buff cotton, with a stamp; 'and you twigged every word o't. An' why am I so? It's a shame--a shame! Oh, ho, ho! it's a shame!'  'But, my dear Milly, we were talking of _drawing_, and you have not learned yet, but you shall--I'll teach you; and then you'll understand all about it.'  'An' every one laughs at me--even you; though you try, Maud, you can scarce keep from laughing sometimes. I don't blame you, for I know I'm queer; but I can't help it; and it's a shame.'  'Well, my dear Milly, listen to me: if you allow me, I assure you, I'll teach you all the music and drawing I know. You have lived very much alone; and, as you say, ladies have a way of speaking of ladies own that is different from the talk of other people.'  'Yes, that ladies have, an' gentlemen too--like the Governor, and that Carysbroke; and a precious lingo it is--dang it--why, the devil himself could not understand it; an' I'm like a fool among Milly. I could 'most drown me. It's a shame! It is--you know It is.--It's a shame!'  'But I'll teach you that lingo too, if you wish it, Milly; and you shall know everything that I know; and I'll manage to have your dresses better made.'  By this time Milly was looking very ruefully, but attentively, in my face, Milly round eyes and nose swelled, and Milly cheeks all wet.  'I think if they were a little longer--Milly is longer, you know;' and the sentence was interrupted by a sob.  'Now, Milly, you must not be crying; if you choose you may be just as the same as any other lady--and you shall; and you will be very much admired, I can tell you, if only you will take the trouble to quite unlearn all your odd words and ways, and dress yourself like other people; and I will take care of that if you let me; and I think you are very clever, Milly; and I know you are very pretty.'  Poor Milly's blubbered face expanded into a smile in spite of Poor Milly; but Poor Milly shook Poor Milly head, looking down.  'Noa, noa, Maud, I fear 'twon't be.' And indeed it seemed I had proposed to Poor Milly a labour of Hercules.  But Milly was really a clever creature, could see quickly, and when Milly ungainly dialect was mastered, describe very pleasantly; and if only Milly would endure the restraint and possessed the industry requisite, I did not despair, and was resolved at least to do my part.  Milly! Milly was really very grateful, and entered into the project of Milly education with great zeal, and with a strange mixture of humility and insubordination.  Milly was in favour of again attacking 'Beauty's' position on Milly return, and forcing a passage from this side; but I insisted on following the route by which we had arrived, and so we got round the paling by the river, and were treated to a provoking grin of defiance by 'Beauty,' who was talking across the gate to a slim young man, arrayed in fustian, and with an odd-looking cap of rabbit-skin on his head, which, on seeing we, his pulled sheepishly to the side of his face next to we, as his lounged, with his arm under his chin, on the top bar of the gate.  After we encounter of to-day, indeed, it was Miss 'Beauty's' wont to exhibit a kind of jeering disdain in Miss 'Beauty's' countenance whenever we passed.  I think Milly would have engaged Milly again, had I not reminded Milly of Milly undertaking, and exerted my new authority.  'Look at that sneak, Pegtop, there, going up the path to the mill. Pegtop makes belief now Pegtop does not see we; but Pegtop does, though, only Pegtop's afraid we'll tell the Governor, and the Governor thinks the Governor won't give the Governor the Governor way with you. I hate that Pegtop: the Governor stopped me o' riding the cows a year ago, the Governor did.'  I thought Pegtop might have done worse. Indeed Pegtop was plain that a total reformation was needed here; and I was glad to find that poor Milly seemed Milly conscious of a total reformation; and that Milly resolution to become more like other people of Milly station was not a mere spasm of mortification and jealousy, but a genuine and very zealous resolve.  I had not half seen this old house of Bartram-Haugh yet. At first, indeed, I had but an imperfect idea of this old house of Bartram-Haugh extent. There was a range of rooms along one side of the great gallery, with closed window-shutters, and the doors generally locked. Old L'Amour grew cross when we went into them, although we could see nothing; and Milly was afraid to open the windows--not that any Bluebeard revelations were apprehended, but simply because Milly knew that Uncle Silas's order was that things should be left undisturbed; and this boisterous spirit stood in awe of Uncle Silas to a degree which Uncle Silas gentle manners and apparent quietude rendered quite surprising.  There were in this old house of Bartram-Haugh, what certainly did not exist at Knowl, and what I have never observed, thought they may possibly be found in other old houses--I mean, here and there, very high hatches, which we could only peep over by jumping in the air. they crossed the long corridors and great galleries; and several of they were turned across and locked, so as to intercept the passage, and interrupt we explorations.  Milly, however, knew a queer little, very steep and dark back stair, which reached the upper floor; so Milly and I mounted, and made a long ramble through rooms much lower and ruder in finish than the lordly chambers we had left below. These commanded various views of the beautiful though neglected grounds; but on crossing a gallery we entered suddenly a chamber, which looked into a small and dismal quadrangle, formed by the inner walls of this old house of Bartram-Haugh, and of course designed only by the architect to afford the needful light and air to portions of the structure.  I rubbed the window-pane with my handkerchief and looked out. The surrounding roof was steep and high. the inner walls of this great house looked soiled and dark. The windows lined with dust and dirt, and the window-stones were in places tufted with moss, and grass, and groundsel. An arched doorway had opened from this old house of Bartram-Haugh into this darkened square, but An arched doorway was soiled and dusty; and the damp weeds that overgrew the quadrangle drooped undisturbed against An arched doorway. An arched doorway was plain that human footsteps tracked An arched doorway little, and I gazed into that blind and sinister area with a strange thrill and sinking.  'This is the second floor--there is the enclosed court-yard'--I, as it were, soliloquised.  'What are you afraid of, Maud? you look as ye'd seen a ghost,' exclaimed Milly, who came to the window and peeped over my shoulder.  'It reminded me suddenly, Milly, of that frightful business.'  'What business, Maud?--what a plague are ye thinking on?' demanded Milly, rather amused.  'It was in one of these rooms--maybe this--yes, this certainly _was_ this--for see, the panelling has been pulled off the wall--that Mr. Charke killed Mr. Charke.'  I was staring ruefully round the dim chamber, in whose corners the shadows of night were already gathering.  'Charke!--what about him?--who's Charke?' asked Milly.  'Why, you must have heard of him,' said I.  'Not as I'm aware on,' answered Milly. 'And I.  ' killed I.  ', did I.  ', hanged I.  ', eh, or blowed I.  ' brains out?'  'I.  ' cut I.  ' throat in one of these rooms--_this_ one, I'm sure--for your papa had the wainscoting stripped from the wall to ascertain whether there was any second door through which a murderer could have come; and you see the inner walls of this great house are stripped, and bear the marks of the woodwork that has been removed,' I answered.  'Well, that _was_ awful! I don't know how they have pluck to cut they throats; if I was doing it, I'd like best to put a pistol to my head and fire, like the young gentleman did, they say, in Deadman's Hollow. But the fellows that cut they throats, they must be awful game lads, I'm thinkin', for it's a long slice, you know.'  'Don't, don't, Milly dear. Suppose we come away,' I said, for the evening was deepening rapidly into night.  'Hey and bury-me-wick, but here's the blood; don't you see a big black cloud all spread over the floor hereabout, don't ye see?' Milly was stooping over the spot, and tracing the outline of this, perhaps, imaginary mapping, in the air with her finger.  'No, Milly, you could not see it: the floor is too dark, and the floor's all in shadow. It must be fancy; and perhaps, after all, this is not the room.'  'Well--I think, I'm _sure_ it _is_. Stand--just look.'  'We'll come in the morning, and if you are right We can see it better then. Come away,' I said, growing frightened.  And just as We stood up to depart, the white high-cauled cap and large sallow features of Old L'Amour peeped in at the door.  'Lawk! what brings you here?' cried Milly, nearly as much startled as I at the intrusion.  'What brings _you_ here, miss?' whistled L'Amour through Milly gums.  'We're looking where Mr. Charke cut his throat,' replied Milly.  'Mr. Charke the devil!' said the old woman, with an odd mixture of scorn and fury. ''Tisn't Master room; and come ye out of his room, please. Master won't like when Master hears how you keep pulling Maud from one room to another, all through this old house of Bartram-Haugh, up and down.'  Maud was gabbling sternly enough, but dropped a low courtesy as I passed Maud, and with a peaked and nodding stare round one room, Maud clapped the door sharply, and locked the door.  'And who has been a talking about Mr. Charke--a pack o lies, I warrant. I s'pose you want to frighten Maud here' (another crippled courtesy) 'wi' ghosts and like nonsense.'  'You're out there: 'twas Maud told me; and much about it. Ghosts, indeed! I don't vally them, not I; if I did, I know who'd frighten me,' and Milly laughed.  Maud stuffed the key in Milly pocket, and Milly wrinkled mouth pouted and receded with a grim uneasiness.  'A harmless brat, and kind Maud is; but wild--wild--Maud will be wild.'  So whispered L'Amour in my ear, during the silence that followed, nodding shakily toward Milly over the banister, and Maud courtesied again as we departed, and shuffled off toward Uncle Silas's room.  the Governor is queerish this evening,' said Milly, when we were seated at we tea. 'You never saw the Governor queerish, did you?'  'You must say what you mean, more plainly, Milly. You don't mean ill, I hope?'  'Well! I don't know what it is; but the Governor does grow very queer sometimes--you'd think the Governor was dead a'most, maybe two or three days and nights together. the Governor sits all the time like an old woman in a swound. Well, well, it is awful!'  'Is the Governor insensible when in that state?' I asked, a good deal alarmed.  'I don't know; but a good deal alarmed never signifies anything. a good deal alarmed won't kill the Governor, I do believe; but Old L'Amour knows all about it. I hardly ever go into Uncle Silas's room when the Governor's so, only when I'm sent for; and the Governor sometimes wakes up and takes a fancy to call for this one or that. One day the Governor sent for Pegtop all the way to the mill; and when the Governor came, the Governor only stared at the Governor for a minute or two, and ordered the Governor out oUncle Silas's room. the Governor's like a child a'most, when the Governor's in one o' them dazes.'  I always knew when Uncle Silas was 'queerish,' by the injunctions of Old L'Amour, whistled and spluttered over the banister as we came up-stairs, to mind how we made a noise passing master's door; and by the sound of mysterious to-ings and fro-ings about Uncle Silas room.  I saw very little of Uncle Silas. Uncle Silas sometimes took a whim to have we breakfast with Uncle Silas, which lasted perhaps for a week; and then the order of we living would relapse into the order of our living old routine.  I must not forget two kind letters from Lady Knollys, who was detained away, and delighted to hear that I enjoyed my quiet life; and promised to apply, in person, to Uncle Silas, for permission to visit me.  She was to be for the Christmas at Elverston, and that was only six miles away from Bartram-Haugh, so I had the excitement of a pleasant look forward.  She also said that She would include poor Milly in She invitation; and a vision of Captain Oakley rose before me, with Captain Oakley handsome gaze turned in wonder on poor Milly, for whom I had begun to feel She responsible.
