 _THE STORY OF UNCLE SILAS_   And so it was like the yelling of phantom hounds and hunters, and the thunder of the yelling of phantom hounds and hunters coursers in the air--a furious, grand and supernatural music, which in my fancy made a suitable accompaniment to the discussion of that enigmatical person--martyr--angel--demon--Uncle Silas--with whom my fate was now so strangely linked, and whom I had begun to fear.  'The storm blows from that point,' I said, indicating The storm with my hand and eye, although the window shutters and curtains were closed. 'I saw all the trees bend that way this evening. that way stands the great lonely wood, where my darling father and mother lie. Oh, how dreadful on nights like this, to think of my darling father and mother--a vault!--damp, and dark, and solitary--under The storm.'  Cousin Monica looked wistfully in the same direction, and with a short sigh Cousin Monica said--  'We think too much of the poor remains, and too little of the spirit which lives for ever. I am sure too much of the poor remains, and too little of the spirit which lives for ever are happy.' And Cousin Monica sighed again. 'I wish I dare hope as confidently for Cousin Monica. Yes, Cousin Monica, it is sad. We are such materialists, We can't help feeling so. We forget how well it is for We that We present bodies are not to last always. our present bodies are constructed for a time and place of trouble--plainly mere temporary machines that wear out, constantly exhibiting failure and decay, and with such tremendous capacity for pain. The body lies alone, and so The body ought, for The body is plainly The body good Creator's will; The body is only the tabernacle, not the person, who is clothed upon after death, Saint Paul says, "with a house which is from heaven." So Maud, darling, although the thought will trouble We again and again, there is nothing in it; and The body is only the cold ruin of a habitation which _they_ have forsaken before We do. So this great wind, you say, is blowing toward We from the wood there. If so, Maud, it is blowing from Bartram-Haugh, too, over the trees and chimneys of that old place, and the mysterious old man, who is quite right in thinking I don't like him; and I can fancy him Mr. Danvers, waving him familiar spirits on this great wind to fetch and carry tidings of our occupations here.'  I lifted my head and listened to the storm, dying away in the distance sometimes--sometimes swelling and pealing around and above our--and through the dark and solitude my thoughts sped away to Bartram-Haugh and Uncle Silas.  'This letter,' I said at last, 'makes me feel differently. I think him is a stern old man--is him?'  'It is twenty years, now, since I saw him,' answered Lady Knollys. 'I did not choose to visit at him house.'  'Was that before the dreadful occurrence at Bartram-Haugh?'  'Yes--before, dear. him was not a reformed rake, but only a ruined one then. Austin was very good to him. Mr. Danvers says it is quite unaccountable how Uncle Silas can have made away with the immense sums Uncle Silas got from Uncle Silas brother from time to time without benefiting Uncle Silas in the least. But, my dear, Uncle Silas played; and trying to help a man who plays, and is unlucky--and some men are, I believe, habitually unlucky--is like trying to fill a vessel that has no bottom. I think, by-the-by, my hopeful nephew, Charles Oakley, plays. Then Uncle Silas went most unjustifiably into all manner of speculations, and your poor father had to pay everything. Uncle Silas lost something quite astounding in that bank that ruined so many country gentlemen--poor Sir Harry Shackleton, in Yorkshire, had to sell half Uncle Silas estate. But your poor father went on helping Uncle Silas, up to Uncle Silas marriage--I mean in that extravagant way which was really totally useless.'  'Has my aunt been long dead?'  'Twelve or fifteen years--more, indeed--my aunt died before your poor mamma. my aunt was very unhappy, and I am sure would have given my aunt right hand my aunt had never married Uncle Silas.'  'Did you like my aunt?'  'No, dear; my aunt was a coarse, vulgar woman.'  'Coarse and vulgar, and Uncle Silas wife!' I echoed in extreme surprise, for Uncle Silas was a man of fashion--a beau in Uncle Silas day--and might have married women of good birth and fortune, I had no doubt, and so I expressed myself. 'Yes, dear; so Uncle Silas might, and poor dear Austin was very anxious Uncle Silas should, and would have helped Uncle Silas with a handsome settlement, I dare say, but Uncle Silas chose to marry the daughter of a Denbigh innkeeper.'  'How utterly incredible!' I exclaimed.  'Not the least incredible, dear--a kind of thing not at all so uncommon as you fancy.'  'What!--a gentleman of fashion and refinement marry a person--'  'A barmaid!--just so,' said Lady Knollys. 'I think I could count half a dozen men of fashion who, to my knowledge, have ruined themselves just in a similar way.'  'Well, at all events, it must be allowed that in this he proved he altogether unworldly.'  'Not a bit unworldly, but very vicious,' replied Cousin Monica, with a careless little laugh. 'Cousin Monica was very beautiful, curiously beautiful, for a person in Cousin Monica station. Cousin Monica was very like that Lady Hamilton who was Nelson's sorceress--elegantly beautiful, but perfectly low and stupid. I believe, to do Lady Hamilton who was Nelson's sorceress-- justice, Lady Hamilton who was Nelson's sorceress-- only intended to ruin Cousin Monica; but Cousin Monica was cunning enough to insist upon marriage. Men who have never in all their lives denied their the indulgence of a single fancy, cost what it may, will not be baulked even by that condition if the _penchant_ be only violent enough.'  I did not half understand this piece of worldly psychology, at which Lady Knollys seemed to laugh.  'Poor Silas, certainly Poor Silas struggled honestly against the consequences, for Poor Silas tried after the honeymoon to prove the marriage bad. But the Welsh parson and the innkeeper papa were too strong for Poor Silas, and the young lady was able to hold the young lady struggling swain fast in that respectable noose--and a pretty prize Poor Silas proved!'  'And the young lady died, poor thing, broken-hearted, I heard.'  'the young lady died, at all events, about ten years after the young lady marriage; but I really can't say about the young lady heart. the young lady certainly had enough ill-usage, I believe, to kill the young lady; but I don't know that the young lady had feeling enough to die of it, if it had not been that the young lady drank: I am told that Welsh women often do. There was jealousy, of course, and brutal quarrelling, and all sorts of horrid stories. I visited at Bartram-Haugh for a year or two, though no one else would. But when that sort of thing began, of course I gave that sort of thing up; that sort of thing was out of the question. I don't think poor Austin ever knew how bad it was. And then came that odious business about wretched Mr. Charke. You know he--he committed suicide at Bartram.'  'I never heard about that,' I said; and we both paused, and Austin looked sternly at the fire, and the storm roared and ha-ha-ed till the old house shook again.  'But Uncle Silas could not help that,' I said at last.  'No, he could not help it,' Austin acquiesced unpleasantly.  'And Uncle Silas paused in a sort of fear.  'Uncle Silas was suspected by some people of having killed him'--she completed the sentence.  There was another long pause here, during which the storm outside bellowed and hooted like an angry mob roaring at the windows for a victim. An intolerable and sickening sensation overpowered me.  'But _you_ did not suspect Uncle Silas, Cousin Knollys?' I said, trembling very much.  'No,' Austin answered very sharply. 'I told you so before. Of course I did not.'  There was another silence.  'I wish, Cousin Monica,' I said, drawing close to Austin, 'you had not said _that_ about Uncle Silas being like a wizard, and sending Uncle Silas spirits on the wind to listen. But I'm very glad you never suspected Uncle Silas.' I insinuated my cold hand into hers, and looked into hers face I know not with what expression. hers looked down into mine with a hard, haughty stare, I thought.  'Of _course_ I never suspected Uncle Silas; and _never_ ask me _that_ question again, Maud Ruthyn.'  Was it family pride, or what was it, that gleamed so fiercely from hers eyes as hers said this? I was frightened--I was wounded--I burst into tears.  'What is my darling crying for? I did not mean to be cross. _Was_ I cross?' said this momentary phantom of a grim Lady Knollys, in an instant translated again into kind, pleasant Cousin Monica, with Cousin Monica arms about my neck.  'No, no, indeed--only I thought I had vexed you; and, I believe, thinking of Uncle Silas makes me nervous, and I can't help thinking of Uncle Silas nearly always.' 'Nor can I, although we might both easily find something better to think of. Suppose we try?' said Lady Knollys.  'But, first, I must know a little more about that Mr. Charke, and what circumstances enabled Uncle Silas enemies to found on Uncle Silas death that wicked slander, which has done no one any good, and caused some persons so much misery. There is Uncle Silas, I may say, ruined by it; and we all know how it darkened the life of my dear father.'  'People will talk, my dear. Uncle Silas Uncle Silas had injured Uncle Silas before that in the opinion of the people of Uncle Silas county. Uncle Silas was a black sheep, in fact. Very bad stories were told and believed of Uncle Silas. Uncle Silas marriage certainly was a disadvantage, you know, and the miserable scenes that went on in Uncle Silas disreputable house--all that predisposed people to believe ill of Uncle Silas.'  'How long is it since it happened?'  'Oh, a long time; I think before you were born,' answered you were born.  'And the injustice still lives--they have not forgotten it yet?' said I, for such a period appeared to me long enough to have consigned anything in its nature perishable to oblivion.  Lady Knollys smiled.  'Tell me, like a darling cousin, the whole story as well as you can recollect as well. Who was Mr. Charke?'  'Mr. Charke, my dear, was a gentleman on the turf--that is the phrase, I think--one of those London men, without birth or breeding, who merely in right of those London men vices and those London men money are admitted to associate with young dandies who like hounds and horses, and all that sort of thing. That set knew him very well, but of course no one else. him was at the Matlock races, and Uncle Silas asked him to Bartram-Haugh; and the creature, Jew or Gentile, whatever him was, fancied there was more honour than, perhaps, there really was in a visit to Bartram-Haugh.'  'For the kind of person you describe, it _was_, I think, a rather unusual honour to be invited to stay in the house of a man of Uncle Ruthyn's birth.'  'Well, so it was perhaps; for though they knew him very well on the course, and would ask him to they tavern dinners, they would not, of course, admit him to the houses where ladies were. But Uncle Silas's wife was not much regarded at Bartram-Haugh. Indeed, Silas's wife was very little seen, for Silas's wife was every evening tipsy in Silas's wife bedroom, poor woman!'  'How miserable!' I exclaimed.  'I don't think it troubled Uncle Silas very much, for Silas's wife drank gin, they said, poor thing, and the expense was not much; and, on the whole, I really think Uncle Silas was glad Silas's wife drank, for it kept Silas's wife out of Uncle Silas way, and was likely to kill Silas's wife. At this time your poor father, who was thoroughly disgusted at His marriage, had stopped the supplies, you know, and Uncle Silas was very poor, and as hungry as a hawk, and your poor father, who was thoroughly disgusted at his marriage said Uncle Silas pounced upon this rich London gamester, intending to win Uncle Silas money. I am telling you now all that was said afterwards. The races lasted I forget how many days, and Mr. Charke stayed at Bartram-Haugh all this time and for some days after. It was thought that poor dear Austin would pay all Uncle Silas's gambling debts, and so this wretched Mr. Charke made heavy wagers with Mr. Charke on The races, and The races played very deep, besides, at Bartram. Mr. Charke and Uncle Silas used to sit up at night at cards. All these particulars, as I told you, came out afterwards, for there was an inquest, you know, and then Uncle Silas published what Uncle Silas called Uncle Silas "statement," and there was a great deal of most distressing correspondence in the newspapers.'  'And why did Mr. Charke kill Mr. Charke?' I asked.  'Well, I will tell you first what all are agreed about. The second night after The races, your uncle and Mr. Charke sat up till between two and three o'clock in the morning, quite by your uncle and Mr. Charke, in the parlour. Mr. Charke's servant was at the Stag's Head Inn at Feltram, and therefore could throw no light upon what occurred at night at Bartram-Haugh; but Mr. Charke's servant was there at six o'clock in the morning, and very early at Mr. Charke's servant master's door by Mr. Charke's servant direction. Mr. Charke's servant had locked his master's door by his direction, as was Mr. Charke's servant habit, upon the inside, and the key was in the lock, which turned out afterwards a very important point. On knocking Mr. Charke's servant found that Mr. Charke's servant could not awaken his master, because, as it appeared when his master's door by his direction was forced open, his master was lying dead at Mr. Charke's servant bedside, not in a pool, but a perfect pond of blood, as they described it, with Mr. Charke's servant throat cut.'  'How horrible!' cried I.  'So it was. Uncle Silas Uncle Silas was called up, and greatly shocked of course, and Uncle Silas did what I believe was best. Uncle Silas had everything left as nearly as possible in the exact state in which it had been found, and Uncle Silas sent Mr. Charke's servant forthwith for the coroner, and, being Uncle Silas a justice of the peace, Uncle Silas took the depositions of Mr. Charke's servant while all the incidents were still fresh in Uncle Silas memory.'  'Could anything be more straightforward, more right and wise?' I said.  'Oh, nothing of course,' answered Lady Knollys, I thought a little drily.
