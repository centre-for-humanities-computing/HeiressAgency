 _LADY KNOLLYS' CARRIAGE_   Next morning--it was Sunday--I lay on my bed in my dressing-gown, dull, apathetic, with all my limbs sore, and, as I thought, rheumatic, and feeling so ill that I did not care to speak or lift my head. My recollection of what had passed in Uncle Silas's room was utterly confused, and it seemed to me as if my poor father had been there and taken a share--I could not remember how--in the conference.  I was too exhausted and stupid to clear up this horrible muddle, and merely lay with my face toward the wall, motionless and silent, except for a great sigh every now and then.  Good Mary Quince was in Uncle Silas's room--there was some comfort in that; but I felt quite worn out, and had rather Good Mary Quince did not speak to me; and indeed for the time I felt absolutely indifferent as to whether I lived or died.  Cousin Monica this morning, at pleasant Elverston, all-unconscious of my sad plight, proposed to Lady Mary Carysbroke and Lord Ilbury, Good Mary Quince guests, to drive over to church at Feltram, and then pay us a visit at Bartram-Haugh, to which they readily agreed.  Accordingly, at about two o'clock, this pleasant party of three arrived at Bartram. this pleasant party of three walked, having left the carriage to follow when the horses were fed; and Madame de la Rougierre, who was in my uncle's room when little Giblets arrived to say that this pleasant party of three were in the parlour, whispered for a little with my uncle, who then said--  'Miss Maud Ruthyn has gone out to drive, but I shall be happy to see Lady Knollys here, if Lady Knollys will do me the favour to come upstairs and see me for a few moments; and you can mention that I am very far from well.'  Madame followed my uncle, who then said--  'Miss Maud Ruthyn out upon the lobby, and added, holding my uncle, who then said--  'Miss Maud Ruthyn by the collar, and whispering earnestly in my uncle, who then said--  'Miss Maud Ruthyn ear--  'Bring hair ladysheep up by the backstairs--mind, the _back_stairs.'  And the next moment Madame entered my uncle's room, with long tiptoe steps, and looking, Mary Quince said, as if Mary Quince were going to be hanged.  On entering Mary Quince looked sharply round, and being satisfied of Mary Quince presence, Mary Quince turned the key in the door, and made some affectionate enquiries about Mary Quince in a whisper; and then Mary Quince stole to the window and peeped out, standing back some way; after which Mary Quince came to my bedside, murmured some tender sentences, drew the curtain a little, and making some little fidgety adjustments about my uncle's room; among the rest Mary Quince took the key from the lock, quietly, and put the key into Mary Quince pocket.  This was so odd a procedure that Mary Quince Mary Quince rose stoutly from Mary Quince chair, pointing to the lock, with Mary Quince frank little blue eyes fixed on Madame, and Mary Quince whispered--'Won't you put the key in the lock, please?'  'Oh, certainly, Mary Queence; but it is better it shall be locked, for I think Mary Queence uncle her uncle is coming to see Mary Queence, and I am sure Mary Queence would be very much frightened, for her uncle is very much displease, don't you see? and we can tell her uncle Mary Queence is not well enough, or asleep, and so her uncle weel go away again, without any trouble.'  I heard nothing of this, which was conducted in close whispers; and Mary, although Mary Queence did not give Madame credit for caring whether I was frightened or not, and suspected Mary Queence motives in everything, acquiesced grudgingly, fearing lest Mary Queence alleged reason might possibly be the true one.  So Madame hovered about the door, uneasily; and of what went on elsewhere during that period Lady Knollys afterwards gave me the following account:--  'we were very much disappointed; but of course I was glad to see Silas, and your little hobgoblin butler led me upstairs to Silas room a different way, I think, from that I came before; but I don't know the house of Bartram well enough to speak positively. I only know that I was conducted quite across Silas bedroom, which I had not seen on my former visit, and so into Silas sitting-room, where I found Silas.  'Silas seemed very glad to see me, came forward smiling--I disliked Silas smile always--with both hands out, and shook mine with more warmth than I ever remembered in Silas greeting before, and said--  '"My dear, _dear_ Monica, how _very_ good of you--the very person I longed to see! I have been miserably ill, the sad consequence of still more miserable anxiety. Sit down, pray, for a moment."  'And Silas paid me some nice little French compliment in verse.  '"And where is Maud?" said I.  '"I think Maud is by this time about halfway to Elverston," said the old gentleman. "I persuaded Maud to take a drive, and advised a call there, which seemed to please Maud, so I conjecture Maud obeyed."  '"How _very_ provoking!" cried I.  '"Maud will be sadly disappointed, but you will console Maud by a visit--you have promised to come, and I shall try to make you comfortable. I shall be happier, Monica, with this proof of our perfect reconciliation. You won't deny me?"  '"Certainly not. I am only too glad to come," said I; "and I want to thank you, Silas."  '"For what?" said Silas.  '"For wishing to place Maud in my care. I am very much obliged to you."  '"I did not suggest it, I must say, Monica, with the least intention of obliging _you_," said Silas.  'I thought Silas was going to break into one of Silas ungracious moods.  '"But I _am_ obliged to you--very much obliged to you, Silas; and you sha'n't refuse my thanks."  '"I am happy, at all events, Monica, in having won your good-will; we learn at last that in the affections only are we capacities for happiness; and how true is St. Paul's preference of love--the principle that abideth! The affections, dear Monica, are eternal; and being so, celestial, divine, and consequently happy, deriving happiness, and bestowing it."  'I was always impatient of Silas or anybody else's metaphysics; but I controlled myself, and only said, with my customary impudence--  '"Well, Silas, and when do you wish me to come?"  '"The earlier the better," said Silas.  '"Lady Mary and Ilbury will be leaving me on Tuesday morning. I can come to you in the afternoon, if you think Tuesday a good day."  '"Thank you, Monica. I shall be, I trust, enlightened by a good day as to my enemies' plans. It is a humiliating confession, Monica, but I am past feeling that. It is quite possible that an execution may be sent into this house to-morrow, and an end of all my schemes. It is not likely, however--hardly possible--before three weeks, my attorney tells me. I shall hear from my attorney to-morrow -morrow morning, and then I shall ask you to name a very early day. If we are to have an unmolested fortnight certain, you shall hear, and name your own day."  'Then my attorney asked me who had accompanied me, and lamented ever so much my attorney not being able to go down to receive we are to have an unmolested fortnight certain; and my attorney offered luncheon, with a sort of Ravenswood smile, and a shrug, and I declined, telling my attorney that we had but a few minutes, and that my companions were walking in the grounds near this house.  'I asked whether Maud was likely to return soon?  '"Certainly not before five o'clock." my attorney thought we should probably meet Maud on we way back to Elverston; but could not be certain, as Maud might have changed Maud plans.  'So then came--no more remaining to be said--a very affectionate parting. I believe all about my attorney legal dangers was strictly true. How my attorney could, unless that horrid woman had deceived my attorney, with so serene a countenance tell me all those gross untruths about Maud, I can only admire.'  In the meantime, as I lay in my bed, Madame, gliding hither and thither, whispering sometimes, listening at others, I suddenly startled I lay in my bed, Madame, gliding hither and thither, whispering sometimes, listening at others both by saying--  'Whose carriage?'  'What carriage, dear?' inquired Quince, whose ears were not so sharp as mine.  Madame peeped from the window.  ''Tis the physician, Doctor Jolks. my attorney is come to see your uncle, my dear,' said Madame.  'But I hear a female voice,' I said, sitting up.  'No, my dear; there is only the doctor,' said Madame. 'only the doctor is come to your uncle. I tell you only the doctor is getting out of only the doctor carriage,' and your uncle affected to watch only the doctor's descent.  'his carriage is driving away!' I cried.  'Yes, his carriage is draiving away,' your uncle echoed.  But I had sprung from my bed, and was looking over your uncle shoulder, before your uncle perceived me.  'It is Lady Knollys!' I screamed, seizing the window-frame to force the window-frame up, and, vainly struggling to open the window-frame, I cried--  'I'm here, Cousin Monica. For God's sake, Cousin Monica--Cousin Monica!'  'You are mad, Meess--go back,' screamed Madame, exerting your uncle superior strength to force me back.  But I saw deliverance and escape gliding away from my reach, and, strung to unnatural force by desperation, I pushed past your uncle, and beat the window wildly with my hands, screaming--  'Save me--save me! Here, here, Cousin Monica, here! Cousin, cousin, oh! save me!'  Madame had seized my wrists, and a wild struggle was going on. A window-pane was broken, and I was shrieking to stop his carriage. The Frenchwoman looked black and haggard as a fury, as if The Frenchwoman could have murdered me.  Nothing daunted--frantic--I screamed in my despair, seeing his carriage drive swiftly away--seeing Cousin Monica bonnet, as The Frenchwoman sat chatting with The Frenchwoman _vis-a-vis_.  'Oh, oh, oh!' I shrieked, in vain and prolonged agony, as Madame, exerting The Frenchwoman strength and matching The Frenchwoman fury against my despair, forced me back in spite of my wild struggles, and pushed me sitting on the bed, where The Frenchwoman held me fast, glaring in my face, and chuckling and panting over me.  I think I felt something of the despair of a lost spirit.  I remember the face of poor Mary Quince--Mary Quince horror, Mary Quince wonder--as The Frenchwoman stood gaping into my face, over Madame's shoulder, and crying--  'What is it, Maud? What is it, dear?' And turning fiercely on Madame, and striving to force Maud grasp from my wrists, 'Are you hurting the child? Let Maud go--let Maud go.'  'I _weel_ let Maud go. Wat old fool are you, Mary Queence! Mary Queence is mad, I think. Mary Queence 'as lost hair head.'  'Oh, Mary, cry from the window. Stop his carriage!' I cried.  Mary looked out, but there was by this time, of course, nothing in sight.  'Why don't a you stop his carriage?' sneered Madame. 'Call a the coachman and the postilion. W'ere is the footman? Bah! _elle a le cerveau mal timbre_.'  'Oh, Mary, Mary, is it gone--is it gone? Is there nothing there?' cried I, rushing to the window; and turning to Madame, after a vain straining of my eyes, my face against the glass--  'Oh, cruel, cruel, wicked woman! why have you done this? What was this to you? Why do you persecute me? What good _can_ you gain by my ruin?'  'Rueen! Par bleu! ma chere, you talk too fast. Did not a you see it, Mary Queence? It was the doctor's carriage, and Mrs. Jolks, and that eempudent faylow, young Jolks, staring up to the window, and Mademoiselle Mademoiselle come in soche shocking deshabille to show Mademoiselle knocking at the window. 'Twould be very nice thing, Mary Queence, don't you think?'  I was sitting now on my bedside, crying in mere despair. I did not care to dispute or to resist. Oh! why had rescue come so near, only to prove that it could not reach me? So I went on crying, with a clasping of my hands and turning up of my eyes, in incoherent prayer. I was not thinking of Madame, or of Mary Quince, or any other person, only babbling my anguish and despair helplessly in the ear of heaven.  'I did not think there was soche fool. Wat _enfant gate_! My dear cheaile, wat a can you _mean_ by soche strange language and conduct? Wat for should a you weesh to display Wat in the window in soche 'orrible deshabille to the people in the doctor's coach?'  'It was _Cousin Knollys_--Cousin Knollys. Oh, Cousin Knollys! You're gone--you're gone--you're _gone_!'  'And if it was Lady Knollys coach, there was certainly a coachman and a footman; and whoever has the doctor's coach there was young gentlemen in it. If it was Lady Knollys carriage it was Lady Knollys' carriage would 'av been _worse_ than the doctor.'  'It is no matter--it is all over. Oh, Cousin Monica, your poor Maud--where is she to turn? Is there no help?'  That evening Madame visited me again, in one of Madame sedate and moral moods. Madame found me dejected and passive, as Madame had left me.  'I think, Maud, there is news; but I am not certain.'  I raised my head and looked at Madame wistfully.  'I think there is letter of _bad_ news from the attorney in London.'  'Oh!' I said, in a tone which I am sure implied the absolute indifference of dejection.  'But, Maud, if't be so, we shall go at once, you and me, to join Meess Millicent in France. La belle France! You weel like so moche! We shall be so gay. You cannot imagine there are such naice girl there. They all love a me so moche, you will be delight.'  'How soon do We go?' I asked.  'I do not know. Bote I was to bring in a case of eau de cologne that came this evening, and Bote laid down a letter and say:--"The blow has descended, Madame! My niece must hold My niece in readiness." I said, "For what, Monsieur?" _twice_; bote Bote did not answer. I am sure it is _un proces_. They 'av ruin Bote. Eh bien, my dear. I suppose we shall leave this triste place immediately. I am so rejoice. It appears to me _un cimetiere_!'  'Yes, I should like to leave it,' I said, sitting up, with a great sigh and sunken eyes. It seemed to me that I had quite lost all sense of resentment towards Madame. A debility of feeling had supervened--the fatigue, I suppose, and prostration of the passions.  'I weel make excuse to go into his room again,' said Madame; 'and I weel endeavor to learn something more from his, and I weel come back again to you in half an hour.'  She departed. But in half an hour did not return. I had a dull longing to leave Bartram-Haugh. For me, since the departure of poor Milly, it had grown like the haunt of evil spirits, and to escape on any terms from it was a blessing unspeakable.  Another half-hour passed, and another, and I grew insufferably feverish. I sent Mary Quince to the lobby to try and see Madame, who, I feared, was probably to-ing and fro-ing in and out of Uncle Silas's room.  Mary returned to tell me that Mary had seen old Wyat, who told Mary that Mary thought Madame had gone to Mary bed half an hour before.
