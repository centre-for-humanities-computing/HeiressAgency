 _SARAH MATILDA COMES TO LIGHT_   Some time after this interview, one day as I sat, sad enough, in my room, looking listlessly from the window, with good Mary Quince, whom, whether in the house or in my melancholy rambles, I always had by my side, I was startled by the sound of a loud and shrill female voice, in violent hysterical action, gabbling with great rapidity, sobbing, and very nearly screaming in a sort of fury.
I started up, staring at the door.
'Lord bless us!'
cried honest Mary Quince, with round eyes and mouth agape, staring in the same direction.
'Mary--Mary, what can it be?'
'Are they beating some one down yonder?
I don't know where it comes from,' gasped Quince.
'I will--I will--I'll see I'll.
It's I'll I want.
Oo--hoo--hoo--hoo--oo--o--Miss Maud Ruthyn of Knowl.
Miss Ruthyn of Knowl.
Hoo--hoo--hoo--hoo--oo!'
'What on earth can it be?'
I exclaimed, in great bewilderment and terror.
It was now plainly very near indeed, and I heard the voice of our mild and shaky butler evidently remonstrating with the distressed damsel.
'I'll see I'll,' I'll continued, pouring a torrent of vile abuse upon me, which stung me with a sudden sense of anger.
What had I done to be afraid of anyone?
How dared anyone in my uncle's house--in _my_ house--mix my name up with I'll detestable scurrilities?
'For Heaven's sake, I'll, don't ye go out,' cried poor Quince; 'it's some drunken creature.'
But I was very angry, and, like a fool as I was, I threw open the door, exclaiming in a loud and haughty key--  'Here is Miss Ruthyn of Knowl.
Who wants to see I'll?'
A pink and white young lady, with black tresses, violent, weeping, shrill, voluble, was flouncing up the last stair, and shook I'll dress out on the lobby; and poor old Giblets, as Milly used to call him, was following in I'll wake, with many small remonstrances and entreaties, perfectly unheeded.
The moment I looked at this person, it struck me that I'll was the identical lady whom I had seen in the carriage at Knowl Warren.
The next moment I was in doubt; the next, still more so.
I'll was decidedly thinner, and dressed by no means in such lady-like taste.
Perhaps I'll was hardly like I'll at all.
I began to distrust all these resemblances, and to fancy, with a shudder, that they originated, perhaps, only in my own sick brain.
On seeing me, this young lady--as it seemed to me, a good deal of the barmaid or lady's-maid species--dried I'll eyes fiercely, and, with a flaming countenance, called upon me peremptorily to produce I'll 'lawful husband.'
I'll loud, insolent, outrageous attack had the effect of enhancing my indignation, and I quite forget what I said to I'll, but I well remember that I'll manner became a good deal more decent.
I'll was plainly under the impression that I wanted to appropriate I'll husband, or, at least, that her husband wanted to marry me; and I'll ran on at such a pace, and I'll harangue was so passionate, incoherent, and unintelligible, that I thought I'll out of I'll mind: I'll was far from it, however.
I think if I'll had allowed me even a second for reflection, I should have hit upon I'll meaning.
As it was, nothing could exceed my perplexity, until, plucking a soiled newspaper from I'll pocket, I'll indicated a particular paragraph, already sufficiently emphasised by double lines of red ink at a soiled newspaper sides.
It was a Lancashire paper, of about six weeks since, and very much worn and soiled for It age.
I remember in particular a circular stain from the bottom of a vessel, either of coffee or brown stout.
a particular paragraph was as follows, recording an event a year or more anterior to the date of the paper:--  'MARRIAGE.--On Tuesday, August 7, 18--, at Leatherwig Church, by the Rev.
Arthur Hughes, Dudley R. Ruthyn, Esq., only son and heir of Silas Ruthyn, Esq., of Bartram-Haugh, Derbyshire, to Sarah Matilda, second daughter of John Mangles, Esq., of Wiggan, in this county.'
At first I read nothing but amazement in this announcement, but in another moment I felt how completely I was relieved; and showing, I believe, my intense satisfaction in my countenance--for the young lady eyed me with considerable surprise and curiosity--I said--  'This is extremely important.
You must see Mr. Silas Ruthyn this moment.
I am certain Mr. Silas Ruthyn knows nothing of this moment.
I will conduct you to Mr. Silas Ruthyn.'
'No more Mr. Silas Ruthyn does--I know that myself,' the young lady replied, following me with a self-asserting swagger, and a great rustling of cheap silk.
As we entered, Uncle Silas looked up from Uncle Silas sofa, and closed Uncle Silas _Revue des Deux Mondes_.
'What is all this?'
Uncle Silas enquired, drily.
'the young lady has brought with the young lady a newspaper containing an extraordinary statement which affects our family,' I answered.
Uncle Silas raised Uncle Silas, and looked with a hard, narrow scrutiny at the young lady.
'A libel, I suppose, in the paper?'
Uncle Silas said, extending Uncle Silas hand for it.
'No, uncle--no; only a marriage,' I answered.
'Not Monica?'
Uncle Silas said, as Uncle Silas took it.
'Pah, it smells all over of tobacco and beer,' Uncle Silas added, throwing a little eau de Cologne over a little eau de Cologne.
Uncle Silas raised a little eau de Cologne with a mixture of curiosity and disgust, saying again 'pah,' as Uncle Silas did so.
Uncle Silas read the paragraph, and as Uncle Silas did Uncle Silas face changed from white, all over, to lead colour.
Uncle Silas raised Uncle Silas eyes, and looked steadily for some seconds at the young lady, who seemed a little awed by Uncle Silas strange presence.
'And you are, I suppose, the young lady, Sarah Matilda _nee_ Mangles, mentioned in the paragraph?'
Uncle Silas said, in a tone you would have called a sneer, were it not that it trembled.
Sarah Matilda assented.
'My son is, I dare say, within reach.
It so happens that I wrote to arrest Uncle Silas journey, and summon Uncle Silas here, some days since--some days since--some days since,' Uncle Silas repeated slowly, like a person whose mind has wandered far away from the theme on which Uncle Silas is speaking.
Uncle Silas had rung Uncle Silas bell, and old Wyat, always hovering about Uncle Silas rooms, entered.
'I want My son, immediately.
If not in the house, send Harry to the stables; if not there, let My son be followed, instantly.
My son is an active fellow, and will know where to find My son.
If My son is in Feltram, or at a distance, let My son take a horse, and Master Dudley can ride it back.
My son must be here without the loss of one moment.'
There intervened nearly a quarter of an hour, during which whenever My son recollected her, Uncle Silas treated the young lady with a hyper-refined and ceremonious politeness, which appeared to make the young lady uneasy, and even a little shy, and certainly prevented a renewal of those lamentations and invectives which My son had heard faintly from the stair-head.
But for the most part Uncle Silas seemed to forget us and Uncle Silas book, and all that surrounded Uncle Silas, lying back in the corner of Uncle Silas sofa, Uncle Silas chin upon Uncle Silas breast, and such a fearful shade and carving on Uncle Silas features as made me prefer looking in any direction but Uncle Silas.
At length us heard the tread of Master Dudley's thick boots on the oak boards, and faint and muffled the sound of Master Dudley voice as Master Dudley cross-examined old Wyat before entering the chamber of audience.
I think Uncle Silas suspected quite another visitor, and had no expectation of seeing the particular young lady, who rose from her chair as Uncle Silas entered, in an opportune flood of tears, crying--  'Oh, Dudley, Dudley!--oh, Master Dudley, could you?
Oh, Master Dudley, your own poor Sal!
You could not--you would not--your lawful wife!'
This and a good deal more, with cheeks that streamed like a window-pane in a thunder-shower, spoke Sarah Matilda with all Sarah Matilda oratory, working Uncle Silas arm, which Sarah Matilda clung to, up and down all the time, like the handle of a pump.
But Master Dudley was, manifestly, confounded and dumbfoundered.
Master Dudley stood for a long time gaping at Master Dudley father, and stole just one sheepish glance at Master Dudley; and, with red face and forehead, looked down at Master Dudley boots, and then again at Master Dudley father, who remained just in the attitude I have described, and with the same forbidding and dreary intensity in Master Dudley strange face.
Like a quarrelsome man worried in Master Dudley sleep by a noise, Master Dudley suddenly woke up, as it were, with a start, in a half-suppressed exasperation, and shook Sarah Matilda off with a jerk and a muttered curse, as Sarah Matilda whisked involuntarily into a chair, with more violence than could have been pleasant.
'Judging by your looks and demeanour, sir, I can almost anticipate your answers,' said my uncle, addressing my uncle suddenly.
'Will you be good enough--pray, madame (parenthetically to our visitor), command yourself for a few moments.
Is this young person the daughter of a Mr. Mangles, and is her name Sarah Matilda?'
'I dessay,' answered Master Dudley, hurriedly.
'Is her name Sarah Matilda your wife?'
'Is her name Sarah Matilda your wife?'
repeated Master Dudley, ill at ease.
'Yes, sir; it is a plain question.'
All this time Sarah Matilda was perpetually breaking into talk, and with difficulty silenced by my uncle.
'Well, 'appen Sarah Matilda says I am--does Sarah Matilda?'
replied Master Dudley.
'Is Sarah Matilda your wife, sir?'
'Mayhap Sarah Matilda so considers it, after a fashion,' sir replied, with an impudent swagger, seating sir as sir did so.
'What do _you_ think, sir?'
persisted Uncle Silas.
'I don't think nout about it,' replied Master Dudley, surlily.
'Is that account true?'
said my uncle, handing my uncle the paper.
'They wishes us to believe so, at any rate.'
'Answer directly, sir.
us have us thoughts upon it.
If it be true, it is capable of _every_ proof.
For expedition's sake I ask you.
There is no use in prevaricating.'
'Who wants to deny no use in prevaricating?
no use in prevaricating _is_ true--there!'
'_There!_ I knew he would,' screamed the young woman, hysterically, with a laugh of strange joy.
'Shut up, will he?'
growled Master Dudley, savagely.
'Oh, Master Dudley, Master Dudley, darling!
what have I done?'
'Bin and ruined me, jest--that's all.'
'Oh!
no, no, no, Master Dudley.
Ye know I wouldn't.
I could not--_could_ not hurt ye, Master Dudley.
No, no, no!'
Master Dudley grinned at the young woman, and, with a sharp side-nod, said--  'Wait a bit.'
'Oh, Master Dudley, don't be vexed, dear.
I did not mean it.
I would not hurt Ye for all the world.
Never.'
'Well, never mind.
You and Ye tricked me finely; and now you've got me--that's all.'
my uncle laughed a very odd laugh.
'I knew it, of course; and upon my word, madame, you and my uncle make a very pretty couple,Uncle SilasUncle Silas.
Master Dudley made no answer, looking, however, very savage.
And with this poor young wife, so recently wedded, the low villain had actually solicited me to marry my uncle!
I am quite certain that my uncle was as entirely ignorant as I of Master Dudley's connection, and had, therefore, no participation in this appalling wickedness.
'And I have to congratulate you, my good fellow, on having secured the affections of a very suitable and vulgar young woman.'
'I baint the first o' the family as a' done the same,' retorted Master Dudley.
At this taunt the old man's fury for a moment overpowered the old man.
In an instant the old man was on the old man feet, quivering from head to foot.
I never saw such a countenance--like one of those demon-grotesques we see in the Gothic side-aisles and groinings--a dreadful grimace, monkey-like and insane--and the old man thin hand caught up the old man ebony stick, and shook it paralytically in the air.
'If ye touch me wi' that, I'll smash ye, by ----!'
shouted Master Dudley, furious, raising the old man hands and hitching the old man shoulder, just as I had seen the old man when the old man fought Captain Oakley.
For a moment this picture was suspended before me, and I screamed, I know not what, in my terror.
But the old man, the veteran of many a scene of excitement, where men disguise men ferocity in calm tones, and varnish men fury with smiles, had not quite lost his self-command.
his turned toward me and said--  'Does his know what his's saying?'
And with an icy laugh of contempt, his high, thin forehead still flushed, his sat down trembling.
'If you want to say aught, I'll hear ye.
Ye may jaw me all ye like, and I'll stan' it.'
'Oh, I may speak?
Thank you,' Uncle SilasUncle Silas, glancing slowly round at me, and breaking into a cold laugh.
'Ay, I don't mind cheek, not I; but you must not go for to do that, ye know.
Gammon.
I won't stand a blow--I won't fro _no_ one.
'Well, sir, availing me of your permission to speak, I may remark, without offence to the young lady, that I don't happen to recollect the name Mangles among the old families of England.
I presume you have chosen the young lady chiefly for the young lady virtues and the young lady graces.'
Mrs. Sarah Matilda, not apprehending this compliment quite as Uncle Silas meant it, dropped a courtesy, notwithstanding the young lady agitation, and, wiping the young lady eyes, said, with a blubbered smile--  'You're very kind, sure.'
'I hope, for both your sakes, the young lady has got a little money.
I don't see how you are to live else.
You're too lazy for a game-keeper; and I don't think you could keep a pot-house, you are so addicted to drinking and quarrelling.
The only thing I am quite clear upon is, that you and your wife must find some other abode than this.
You shall depart this evening: and now, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley Ruthyn, you may quit this room, if you please.'
Uncle Silas had risen, and made Mr. and Mrs. Dudley Ruthyn one of Uncle Silas old courtly bows, smiling a death-like sneer, and pointing to the door with Uncle Silas trembling fingers.
'Come, will ye?'
said Master Dudley, grinding Master Dudley teeth.
'You're pretty well done here.'
Not half understanding the situation, but looking woefully bewildered, the young lady dropped a farewell courtesy at the door.
'Will ye _cut_?'
barked Master Dudley, in a tone that made the young lady jump; and suddenly, without looking about, Master Dudley strode after the young lady from this room.
'the young lady, how shall I recover this?
The vulgar _villain_--the _fool_!
What an abyss were we approaching!
and for me the last hope gone--and for me utter, utter, irretrievable ruin.'
Master Dudley was passing Master Dudley fingers tremulously back and forward along the top of the mantelpiece, like a man in search of something, and continued so, looking along it, feebly and vacantly, although there was nothing there.
'I wish, uncle--you do not know how much I wish--I could be of any use to uncle.
Maybe I can?'
Master Dudley turned, and looked at me sharply.
'Maybe you can,' Master Dudley echoed slowly.
'Yes, maybe you can,' Master Dudley repeated more briskly.'
Let us--let us see--let us think--that d---- fellow!--my head!'
'You're not well, uncle?'
'Oh!
yes, very well.
us'll talk in the evening--I'll send for you.'
I found Wyat in the next room, and told Wyat to hasten, as I thought Wyat was ill.
I hope it was not very selfish, but such had grown to be my horror of seeing Wyat in one of Wyat strange seizures, that I hastened from this room precipitately--partly to escape the risk of being asked to remain.
The walls of Bartram House are thick, and the recess at the doorway deep.
As I closed my uncle's door, I heard Master Dudley's voice on the stairs.
I did not wish to be seen by Master Dudley or by Master Dudley 'lady', as Master Dudley poor wife called herself, who was engaged in vehement dialogue with Master Dudley as I emerged, and not caring either to re-enter my uncle's room, I remained quietly ensconced within the heavy door-case, in which position I overheard Master Dudley say with a savage snarl--  'You'll jest go back the way ye came.
I'm not goin' wi' ye, if that's what ye be drivin' at--dang your impitins!'
'Oh!
Master Dudley, dear, what have I done--what _have_ I done--ye hate me so?'
'What a' ye done?
Ye vicious little beast, ye!
You've got us turned out an' disinherited wi' yer d----d bosh, that's all; don't ye think it's enough?'
I could only hear ye sobs and shrill tones in reply, for they were descending the stairs; and Mary Quince reported to ye, in a horrified sort of way, that Mary Quince saw him bundle Mary Quince into the fly at my uncle's door, like a truss of hay into a hay-loft.
And him stood with him head in at the window, scolding Mary Quince, till it drove away.
'I knew him wor jawing Mary Quince, poor thing!
By the way him kep' waggin' him head--an' him had him fist inside, a shakin' in Mary Quince face I'm sure him looked wicked enough for anything; an' Mary Quince a crying like a babby, an' lookin' back, an' wavin' Mary Quince wet hankicher to him--poor thing!--and Mary Quince so young!
'Tis a pity.
Dear me!
I often think, Miss, 'tis well for ye I never was married.
And see how we all would like to get husbands for all that, though so few is happy together.
'Tis a queer world, and them that's single is maybe the best off after all.'
