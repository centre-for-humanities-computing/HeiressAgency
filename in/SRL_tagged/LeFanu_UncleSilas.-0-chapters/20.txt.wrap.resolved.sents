 _A MIDNIGHT VISITOR_   The frightful warnings of Lady Knollys haunted me too.
Was there no escape from the dreadful companion whom fate had assigned me?
I made up my mind again and again to speak to my father and urge my father removal.
In other things my father indulged me; here, however, my father met me drily and sternly, and it was plain that my father fancied I was under my cousin Monica's influence, and also that my father had secret reasons for persisting in an opposite course.
Just then I had a gay, odd letter from Lady Knollys, from some country house in Shropshire.
Not a word about Captain Oakley.
My eye skimmed My eye pages in search of that charmed name.
With a peevish feeling I tossed the sheet upon the table.
Inwardly I thought how ill-natured and unwomanly the sheet was.
After a time, however, I read the sheet, and found a gay, odd letter from Lady Knollys, from some country house in Shropshire very good-natured.
She had received a note from papa.
He had 'had the impudence to forgive _She_ for _He_ impertinence.'
But for my sake She meant, notwithstanding this aggravation, really to pardon He; and whenever She had a disengaged week, to accept He invitation to Knowl, from whence She was resolved to whisk me off to London, where, though I was too young to be presented at Court and come out, I might yet--besides having the best masters and a good excuse for getting rid of Medusa--see a great deal that would amuse and surprise me.
'Great news, I suppose, from Lady Knollys?'
said Madame, who always knew who in the house received letters by the post, and by an intuition from whom they came.
'Two letters--you and your papa.
She is quite well, I hope?'
'Quite well, thank you, Madame.'
Some fishing questions, dropped from time to time, fared no better.
And as usual, when She was foiled even in a trifle, She became sullen and malignant.
That night, when my father and I were alone, my father and I suddenly closed the book my father and I had been reading, and said--  'I heard from Monica Knollys to-day.
I always liked poor Monnie; and though poor Monnie's no witch, and very wrong-headed at times, yet now and then She does say a thing that's worth weighing.
Did She ever talk to you of a time, Maud, when you are to be your own mistress?'
'No,' I answered, a little puzzled, and looking straight in my father and I rugged, kindly face.
'Well, I thought She might--She's a rattle, you know--always _was_ a rattle, and that sort of people say whatever comes uppermost.
But that's a subject for me, and more than once, Maud, it has puzzled me.'
Maud sighed.
'Come with Maud to the study, little Maud.'
So, Maud carrying a candle, we crossed the lobby, and marched together through the passage, which at night always seemed a little awesome, darkly wainscoted, uncheered by the cross-light from the hall, which was lost at the turn, leading we away from the frequented parts of the house to that misshapen and lonely room about which the traditions of the nursery and the servants' hall had had so many fearful stories to recount.
I think my father had intended making some disclosure to Maud on reaching this room.
If so, my father changed my father mind, or at least postponed my father intention.
my father had paused before the cabinet, respecting the key of which my father had given me so strict a charge, and I think my father was going to explain my father more fully than my father had done.
But my father went on, instead, to the table where my father desk, always jealously locked, was placed, and having lighted the candles which stood by his desk, my father glanced at Maud, and said--  'You must wait a little, Maud; I shall have something to say to Maud.
Take this candle and amuse Maud with a book meanwhile.'
I was accustomed to obey in silence.
I chose a volume of engravings, and ensconced Maud in a favourite nook in which I had often passed a half-hour similarly.
This was a deep recess by the fireplace, fenced on the other side by a great old escritoir.
Into This I drew a stool, and, with candle and book, I placed Maud snugly in the narrow chamber.
Every now and then I raised my eyes and saw my father either writing or ruminating, as it seemed to Maud, very anxiously at my father .
Time wore on--a longer time than my father had intended, and still my father continued absorbed at my father .
Gradually I grew sleepy, and as I nodded, the book and room faded away, and pleasant little dreams began to gather round Maud, and so I went off into a deep slumber.
It must have lasted long, for when I wakened this candle had burnt out; my father, having quite forgotten me, was gone, and room was dark and deserted.
I felt cold and a little stiff, and for some seconds did not know where I was.
I had been wakened, I suppose, by a sound which I now distinctly heard, to my great terror, approaching.
There was a rustling; there was a breathing.
I heard a creaking upon the plank that always creaked when walked upon in the passage.
I held my breath and listened, and coiled Maud up in the innermost recess of the narrow chamber.
Sudden and sharp, a light shone in from the nearly-closed study door.
It shone angularly on the ceiling like a letter L reversed.
There was a pause.
Then some one knocked softly at the nearly-closed study door, which after another pause was slowly pushed open.
I expected, I think, to see the dreaded figure of the linkman.
I was scarcely less frightened to see that of Madame de la Rougierre.
Madame de la Rougierre was dressed in a sort of grey silk, which Madame de la Rougierre called Madame de la Rougierre Chinese silk--precisely as Madame de la Rougierre had been in the daytime.
In fact, I do not think Madame de la Rougierre had undressed.
Madame de la Rougierre had no shoes on.
Otherwise Madame de la Rougierre toilet was deficient in nothing.
Madame de la Rougierre wide mouth was grimly closed, and Madame de la Rougierre stood scowling into room with a searching and pallid scrutiny, the candle held high above Madame de la Rougierre head at the full stretch of Madame de la Rougierre arm.
Placed as I was in a deep recess, and in a seat hardly raised above the level of the floor, I escaped Madame de la Rougierre, although it seemed to me for some seconds, as I gazed on this spectre, that our eyes actually met.
I sat without breathing or winking, staring upon the formidable image which with upstretched arm, and the sharp lights and hard shadows thrown upon Madame de la Rougierre corrugated features, looked like a sorceress watching for the effect of a spell.
Madame de la Rougierre was plainly listening intensely.
Unconsciously Madame de la Rougierre had drawn Madame de la Rougierre lower lip altogether between Madame de la Rougierre teeth, and I well remember what a deathlike and idiotic look the contortion gave Madame de la Rougierre.
My terror lest Madame de la Rougierre should discover me amounted to positive agony.
Madame de la Rougierre rolled Madame de la Rougierre eyes stealthily from corner to corner of the room, and listened with Madame de la Rougierre neck awry at the door.
Then to my father's desk Madame de la Rougierre went.
To my great relief, Madame de la Rougierre back was towards me.
Madame de la Rougierre stooped over her back, with the candle close by; I saw Madame de la Rougierre try a key--her back could be nothing else--and I heard Madame de la Rougierre blow through the wards to clear the wards.
Then, again, Madame de la Rougierre listened at the door, candle in hand, and then with long tiptoe steps came back, and papa's desk in another moment was open, and Madame de la Rougierre cautiously turning over the papers it contained.
Twice or thrice Madame de la Rougierre paused, glided to the door, and listened again intently with Madame de la Rougierre head near the ground, and then returned and continued Madame de la Rougierre search, peeping into papers one after another, tolerably methodically, and reading some quite through.
While this felonious business was going on, I was freezing with fear lest Madame de la Rougierre should accidentally look round and Madame de la Rougierre eyes light on me; for I could not say what Madame de la Rougierre might not do rather than have Madame de la Rougierre crime discovered.
Sometimes Madame de la Rougierre would read a paper twice over; sometimes a whisper no louder than the ticking of a watch, sometimes a brief chuckle under Madame de la Rougierre breath, bespoke the interest with which here and there a letter or a memorandum was read.
For about half an hour, I think, this went on; but at the time it seemed to me all but interminable.
On a sudden Madame de la Rougierre raised Madame de la Rougierre head and listened for a moment, replaced the papers deftly, closed the desk without noise, except for the tiny click of the lock, extinguished the candle, and rustled stealthily out of the room, leaving in the darkness the malign and hag-like face on which the candle had just shone still floating filmy in the dark.
Why did I remain silent and motionless while such an outrage was being committed?
If, instead of being a very nervous girl, preoccupied with an undefinable terror of that wicked woman, I had possessed courage and presence of mind, I dare say I might have given an alarm, and escaped from the room without the slightest risk.
But so it was; I could no more stir than the bird who, cowering under no ivy, sees the white owl sailing back and forward under no predatory cruise.
Not only during Madame de la Rougierre presence, but for more than an hour after, I remained cowering in my hiding-place, and afraid to stir, lest Madame de la Rougierre might either be lurking in the neighborhood, or return and surprise me.
You will not be astonished, that after a night so passed I was ill and feverish in the morning.
To my horror, Madame de la Rougierre came to visit me at my bedside.
Not a trace of guilty consciousness of what had passed during the night was legible in Madame de la Rougierre face.
Madame de la Rougierre had no sign of late watching, and Madame de la Rougierre toilet was exemplary.
As Madame de la Rougierre sat smiling by me, full of anxious and affectionate enquiry, and smoothed the coverlet with Madame de la Rougierre great felonious hand, I could quite comprehend the dreadful feeling with which the deceived husband in the 'Arabian Nights' met the deceived husband in the 'Arabian Nights' ghoul wife, after the deceived husband in the 'Arabian Nights' nocturnal discovery.
Ill as I was, I got up and found my father in that room which adjoined my father bedchamber.
my father perceived, I am sure, by my looks, that something unusual had happened.
I shut the door, and came close beside my father chair.
'Oh, papa, I have such a thing to tell you!'
I forgot to call my father 'Sir.'
'A secret; and you won't say who told you?
Will you come down to the study?'
my father looked hard at me, got up, and kissing my forehead, said--'Don't be frightened, Maud; I venture to say it is a mare's nest; at all events, my child, we will take care that no danger reaches you; come, my child.'
And by the hand my father led me to the study.
When the door was shut, and we had reached the far end of that room which adjoined his bedchamber next the window, I said, but in a low tone, and holding my father arm fast--  'Oh, Sir, you don't know what a dreadful person we have living with we--Madame de la Rougierre, I mean.
Don't let Madame de la Rougierre, I mean in if Madame de la Rougierre, I mean comes; Madame de la Rougierre, I mean would guess what I am telling you, and one way or another I am sure Madame de la Rougierre, I mean would kill me.'
'Tut, tut, child.
You _must_ know that's nonsense,' 'Tut, tut, child said, looking pale and stern.
'Oh no, papa.
I am horribly frightened, and Lady Knollys thinks so too.'
'Ha!
I dare say; one fool makes many.
We all know what Monica thinks.'
'But I _saw_ it, papa.
Monica stole your key last night, and opened your desk, and read all your papers.'
'Stole my key!'
said my father, staring at me perplexed, but at the same instant producing it.
'Stole it!
Why here it is!'
'Monica unlocked your desk; Monica read all your papers for ever so long.
Open all your papers now, and see whether they have not been stirred.'
He looked at me this time in silence, with a puzzled air; but He did unlock your desk, and lifted all your papers curiously and suspiciously.
As He did so He uttered a few of those inarticulate interjections which are made with closed lips, and not always intelligible; but He made no remark.
Then He placed me on a chair beside He, and sitting down He, told me to recollect me, and tell He distinctly all I had seen.
This accordingly I did, He listening with deep attention.
'Did Monica remove any paper?'
asked my father, at the same time making a little search, I suppose, for that which my father fancied might have been stolen.
'No; I did not see Monica take anything.'
'Well, you are a good girl, Maud.
Act discreetly.
Say nothing to anyone--not even to your cousin Monica.'
Directions which, coming from another person would have had no great weight, were spoken by my father with an earnest look and a weight of emphasis that made them irresistibly impressive, and I went away with the seal of silence upon my lips.
'Sit down, Maud, _there_.
You have not been very happy with Madame de la Rougierre.
It is time you were relieved.
This occurrence decides it.'
Madame de la Rougierre rang the bell.
'Tell Madame de la Rougierre that I request the honour of seeing Madame de la Rougierre for a few minutes here.'
my father's communications to Madame de la Rougierre were always equally ceremonious.
In a few minutes there was a knock at the door, and the same figure, smiling, courtesying, that had scared me on the threshold last night, like the spirit of evil, presented itself.
my father rose, and Madame de la Rougierre having at my father request taken a chair opposite, looking, as usual in my father presence, all amiability, my father proceeded at once to the point.
'Madame de la Rougierre, I have to request you that you will give me the key now in your possession, which unlocks this desk of mine.'
With which termination my father tapped my father gold pencil-case suddenly on his gold pencil-case.
Madame, who had expected something very different, became instantly so pale, with a dull purplish hue upon her forehead, that, especially when her had twice essayed with her white lips, in vain, to answer, I expected to see her fall in a fit.
her was not looking in his face; her eyes were fixed lower, and her mouth and cheek sucked in, with a strange distortion at one side.
her stood up suddenly, and staring straight in his face, her succeeded in saying, after twice clearing her throat--  'I cannot comprehend, Monsieur Ruthyn, unless you intend to insult me.'
'It won't do, Madame de la Rougierre; I must have that false key.
I give you the opportunity of surrendering It quietly here and now.'
'But who dares to say I possess such thing?'
demanded Madame, who, having rallied from her momentary paralysis, was now fierce and voluble as I had often seen her before.
'You know, Madame de la Rougierre, that you can rely on what I say, and I tell you that you were seen last night visiting this room, and with a key in your possession, opening this desk of mine, and reading my letters and papers contained in this desk of mine.
Unless you forthwith give me a key in your possession, opening this desk, and reading my letters and papers contained in it, and any other false keys in your possession--in which case I shall rest content with dismissing you summarily--I will take a different course.
You know I am a magistrate;--and I shall have you, your boxes, and places up-stairs, searched forthwith, and I will prosecute you criminally.
The thing is clear; you aggravate by denying; you must give me a key in your possession, opening this desk, and reading my letters and papers contained in it, if you please, instantly, otherwise I ring this bell, and you shall see that I mean what I say.'
There was a little pause.
He rose and extended He hand towards the bell-rope.
Madame de la Rougierre glided round the table, extended his hand to arrest He.
'I will do everything, Monsieur Ruthyn--whatever you wish.'
And with these words Madame de la Rougierre broke down altogether.
Madame de la Rougierre sobbed, Madame de la Rougierre wept, Madame de la Rougierre gabbled piteously, all manner of incomprehensible roulades of lamentation and entreaty; coyly, penitently, in a most interesting agitation, Madame de la Rougierre produced the very key from Madame de la Rougierre breast, with a string tied to it.
my father was little moved by this piteous tempest.
my father coolly took the key and tried the key in the desk, which the key locked and unlocked quite freely, though the wards were complicated.
my father shook her head and looked Madame de la Rougierre in the face.
'Pray, who made the key?
It is a new one, and made expressly to pick this lock.'
But Madame de la Rougierre was not going to tell any more than Madame de la Rougierre had expressly bargained for; so Madame de la Rougierre only fell once more into Madame de la Rougierre old paroxysm of sorrow, self-reproach, extenuation, and entreaty.
'Well,' said my father,' I promised that on surrendering the key you should go.
It is enough.
I keep my word.
You shall have an hour and a half to prepare in.
You must then be ready to depart.
I will send your money to you by Mrs. Rusk; and if you look for another situation, you had better not refer to me.
Now be so good as to leave me.'
Madame de la Rougierre seemed to be in a strange perplexity.
Madame de la Rougierre bridled up, dried Madame de la Rougierre eyes fiercely, and dropped a great courtesy, and then sailed away towards the door.
Before reaching the door Madame de la Rougierre stopped on the way, turning half round, with a peaked, pallid glance at my father, and Madame de la Rougierre bit Madame de la Rougierre lip viciously as Madame de la Rougierre eyed my father.
At the door the same repulsive pantomime was repeated, as Madame de la Rougierre stood for a moment with Madame de la Rougierre hand upon the handle.
But Madame de la Rougierre changed Madame de la Rougierre bearing again with a sniff, and with a look of scorn, almost heightened to a sneer, Madame de la Rougierre made another very low courtesy and a disdainful toss of her head, and so disappeared, shutting the door rather sharply behind Madame de la Rougierre.
