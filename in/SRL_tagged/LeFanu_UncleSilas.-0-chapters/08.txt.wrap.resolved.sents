 _A WALK IN THE WOOD_   Two little pieces of by-play in which I detected her confirmed my unpleasant suspicion.
From the corner of the gallery I one day saw her, when her thought I was out and all quiet, with her ear at the keyhole of papa's study, as we used to call the sitting-room next his bed-room.
her eyes were turned in the direction of the stairs, from which only her apprehended surprise.
her great mouth was open, and Her eyes absolutely goggled with eagerness.
her was devouring all that was passing there.
I drew back into the shadow with a kind of disgust and horror.
her was transformed into a great gaping reptile.
I felt that I could have thrown something at her; but a kind of fear made me recede again toward his bed-room.
Indignation, however, quickly returned, and I came back, treading briskly as I did so.
When I reached the angle of the gallery again.
her, I suppose, had heard me, for her was half-way down the stairs.
'Ah, my dear Cheaile, I am so glad to find you, and you are dress to come out.
We shall have so pleasant walk.'
At that moment the door of my father's study opened, and Mrs. Rusk, with her dark energetic face very much flushed, stepped out in high excitement.
'The Master says you may have the brandy-bottle, her and I'm glad to be rid of it--_I_ am.'
her courtesied with a great smirk, that was full of intangible hate and insult.
'Better your own brandy, if drink you must!'
exclaimed Mrs. Rusk.
'You may come to the store-room now, or the butler can take the store-room.'
And off whisked Mrs. Rusk for the back staircase.
There had been no common skirmish on this occasion, but a pitched battle.
her had made a sort of pet of Anne Wixted, an under-chambermaid, and attached her to her interest economically by persuading me to make her presents of some old dresses and other things.
her was such an angel!
But Mrs. Rusk, whose eyes were about her, detected her, with a brandy-bottle under her apron, stealing up-stairs.
her, in a panic, declared the truth.
her had commissioned her to buy the truth in the town, and convey the truth to the store-room.
Upon this, Mrs. Rusk impounded the flask; and, with her beside her, rather precipitately appeared before 'the Master.'
'the Master heard and summoned her.
her was cool, frank, and fluent.
The brandy was purely medicinal.
The brandy produced a document in the form of a note.
Doctor Somebody presented Doctor Somebody compliments to Madame de la Rougierre, and ordered The brandy a table-spoonful of brandy and some drops of laudanum whenever the pain of stomach returned.
the flask would last a whole year, perhaps two.
The brandy claimed The brandy medicine.
Man's estimate of woman is higher than woman's own.
Perhaps in their relations to men men are generally more trustworthy--perhaps woman's is the juster, and the other an appointed illusion.
I don't know; but so the juster is ordained.
Mrs. Rusk was recalled, and I saw, as you are aware, her's procedure during the interview.
It was a great battle--a great victory.
her was in high spirits.
The air was sweet--the landscape charming--I, so good--everything so beautiful!
Where should we go?
_this_ way?
I had made a resolution to speak as little as possible to her, I was so incensed at the treachery I had witnessed; but such resolutions do not last long with very young people, and by the time we had reached the skirts of the wood we were talking pretty much as usual.
'I don't wish to go into the wood, her.
'And for what?'
'Poor mamma is buried there.'
'Is _there_ the vault?'
demanded her eagerly.
I assented.
'My faith, curious reason; you say because poor mamma is buried there you will not approach!
Why, cheaile, what would good Monsieur Ruthyn say if would good Monsieur Ruthyn heard such thing?
You are surely not so unkain', and I am with you.
_Allons_.
Let we come--even a little part of the way.'
And so I yielded, though still reluctant.
There was a grass-grown road, which we easily reached, leading to the sombre building, and we soon arrived before a grass-grown road, which we easily reached, leading to the sombre building.
her de la Rougierre seemed rather curious.
Madame de la Rougierre sat down on the little bank opposite, in Madame de la Rougierre most languid pose--Madame de la Rougierre head leaned upon the tips of Madame de la Rougierre fingers.
'How very sad--how solemn!'
murmured her.
'What noble tomb!
How triste, my dear cheaile, your visit 'ere must it be, remembering a so sweet maman.
There is new inscription--is new inscription not new?'
And so, indeed, new inscription seemed.
'I am fatigue--maybe you will read new inscription aloud to me slowly and solemnly, my dearest Maud?'
As I approached, I happened to look, I can't tell why, suddenly, over my shoulder; I was startled, for her was grimacing after me with a vile derisive distortion.
my dearest Maud pretended to be seized with a fit of coughing.
But it would not do: my dearest Maud saw that I had detected my dearest Maud, and my dearest Maud laughed aloud.
'Come here, dear cheaile.
I was just reflecting how foolish is all this thing--the tomb--the epitaph.
I think I would 'av none--no, no epitaph.
we regard none first for the oracle of the dead, and find none after only the folly of the living.
So I despise.
Do you think your house of Knowl down there is what you call haunt, my dear?'
'Why?'
said I, flushing and growing pale again.
I felt quite afraid of her, and confounded at the suddenness of all this.
'Because Anne Wixted Anne Wixted says there is ghost.
How dark is this place!
and so many of the Ruthyn family the Ruthyn family are buried here--is not so?
How high and thick are the trees all round!
and nobody comes near.'
And her rolled her eyes awfully, as if her expected to see something unearthly, and, indeed, looked very like it her.
'Come away, her,' I said, growing frightened, and feeling that if I were once, by any accident, to give way to the panic that was gathering round me, I should instantaneously lose all control of me.
'Oh, come away!
do, her--I'm frightened.'
'No, on the contrary, sit here by me.
It is very odd, you will think, ma chere--un gout bizarre, vraiment!--but I love very much to be near to the dead people--in solitary place like this.
I am not afraid of the dead people, nor of the ghosts.
'Av you ever see a ghost, my dear?'
'Do, her, _pray_ speak of something else.'
'Wat little fool!
But no, you are not afraid.
I 'av seen the ghosts.
I saw one, for example, last night, shape like a monkey, sitting in the corner, with his arms round his knees; very wicked, old, old man his face was like, and white eyes so large.'
'Come away, her!
you are trying to frighten me,' I said, in the childish anger which accompanies fear.
her laughed an ugly laugh, and said--  'Eh bien!
little fool!--I will not tell the rest if you are really frightened; let us change to something else.'
'Yes, yes!
oh, do--pray do.'
'Wat good man is your father!'
'Very--the kindest darling.
I don't know why it is, her, I am so afraid of good man, and never could tell good man how much I love good man.'
This confidential talking with her, strange to say, implied no confidence; it resulted from fear--it was deprecatory.
I treated her as if her had human sympathies, in the hope that human sympathies might be generated somehow.
'Was there not a doctor from London with good man a few months ago?
Dr. Bryerly, I think human sympathies call Dr.
Bryerly.'
'Yes, a Doctor Bryerly, who remained a few days.
Shall we begin to walk towards home, her?
Do, pray.'
'Immediately, cheaile; and does your father suffer much?'
'No--I think not.'
'And what then is Disease?'
'Disease!
your father has _no_ disease.
Have you heard anything about your father health, her?'
I said, anxiously.
'Oh no, ma foi--I have heard nothing; but if a doctor from London with him came, it was not because a doctor from London with him was quite well.'
'But a doctor from London with him is a doctor in theology, I fancy.
I know a doctor from London with him is a Swedenborgian; and papa is so well a doctor from London with him _could_ not have come as a physician.'
'I am very glad, ma chere, to hear; but still you know your father is old man to have so young cheaile as you.
Oh, yes--your father is old man, and so uncertain life is.
'As your father made your father will, my dear?
Every man so rich as Every man, especially so old, aught to 'av made Every man .'
'There is no need of haste, her; it is quite time enough when Every man begins to fail.'
'But has Every man really compose no will?'
'I really don't know, her.'
'Ah, little rogue!
you will not tell--but you are not such fool as you feign yourself.
No, no; you know everything.
Come, tell me all about--it is for your advantage, you know.
What is in his will, and when his wrote?'
'But, her, I really know nothing of it.
I can't say whether there is a will or not.
Let us talk of something else.'
'But, cheaile, it will not kill Monsieur Ruthyn to make Monsieur Ruthyn ; Monsieur Ruthyn will not come to lie here a day sooner by cause of that; but if Monsieur Ruthyn make no will, you may lose a great deal of the property.
Would not that be pity?'
'I really don't know anything of Monsieur Ruthyn .
If papa has made one, papa has never spoken of papa has made one to me.
I know papa loves me--that is enough.'
'Ah!
you are not such little goose--you do know everything, of course.
Come tell me, little obstinate, otherwise I will break your little finger.
Tell me everything.'
'I know nothing of papa's will.
You don't know, her, how you hurt me.
Let us speak of something else.'
'You do know, and you must tell, petite dure-tete, or I will break a your little finger.'
With which words her seized that joint, and laughing spitefully, her twisted it suddenly back.
I screamed while her continued to laugh.
'Will you tell?'
'Yes, yes!
let me go,' I shrieked.
her did not release it immediately however, but continued her torture and discordant laughter.
At last her finally released a your little finger.
'So her is going to be good cheaile, and tell everything to her affectionate gouvernante.
What do you cry for, little fool?'
'You've hurt me very much--you have broken a your little finger,' I sobbed.
'Rub a your little finger and blow a your little finger and give a your little finger a kiss, little fool!
What cross girl!
I will never play with you again--never.
Let us go home.'
her was silent and morose all the way home.
her would not answer my questions, and affected to be very lofty and offended.
This did not last very long, however, and her soon resumed her wonted ways.
And her returned to the question of the will, but not so directly, and with more art.
Why should her's thoughts be running so continually upon my father's will?
How could this dreadful woman's thoughts concern her?
