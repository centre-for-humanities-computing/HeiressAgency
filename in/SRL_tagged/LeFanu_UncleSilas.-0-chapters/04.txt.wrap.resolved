 _UNCLE SILAS_   When we reached the drawing-room, I resumed my chair, and my father my father slow and regular walk to and fro, in the great room. Perhaps it was the uproar of the wind that disturbed the ordinary tenor of my father thoughts; but, whatever was the cause, certainly my father was unusually talkative that night.  After an interval of nearly half an hour, my father drew near again, and sat down in a high-backed arm-chair, beside the fire, and nearly opposite to my father, and looked at my father steadfastly for some time, as was my father wont, before speaking; and said he--  'This won't do--you must have a governess.'  In cases of this kind I merely set down my book or work, as it might be, and adjusted my father to listen without speaking.  'Your French is pretty well, and your Italian; but you have no German. Your music may be pretty good--I'm no judge--but your drawing might be better--yes--yes. I believe there are accomplished ladies--finishing governesses, they call they--who undertake more than any one teacher would have professed in my time, and do very well. your Italian can prepare you, and next winter, then, you shall visit France and Italy, where you may be accomplished as highly as you please.'  'Thank you, sir.'  'You shall. It is nearly six months since Miss Ellerton left you--too long without a teacher.'  Then followed an interval.  'Dr. Bryerly will ask you about that key, and what that key opens; you show all that to _Dr. Bryerly_, and no one else.'  'But,' I said, for I had a great terror of disobeying Dr. Bryerly in ever so minute a matter, 'you will then be absent, sir--how am I to find the key?'  Dr. Bryerly smiled on my father suddenly--a bright but wintry smile--it seldom came, and was very transitory, and kindly though mysterious.  'True, child; I'm glad you are so wise; _that_, you will find, I have provided for, and you shall know exactly where to look. You have remarked how solitarily I live. You fancy, perhaps, I have not got a friend, and you are nearly right--_nearly_, but not altogether. I have a very sure friend--_one_--a friend whom I once misunderstood, but now appreciate.'  I wondered silently whether it could be Uncle Silas.  'it could be Uncle Silas'll make me a call, some day soon; I'm not quite sure when. I won't tell you it could be Uncle Silas name--you'll hear that soon enough, and I don't want his name talked of; and I must make a little journey with it could be Uncle Silas. You'll not be afraid of being left alone for a time?'  'And have you promised, sir--?' I answered, with another question, my curiosity and anxiety overcoming my awe. it could be Uncle Silas took my questioning very good-humouredly.  'Well--_promise_?--no, child; but I'm under condition; it could be Uncle Silas's not to be denied. I must make the excursion with it could be Uncle Silas the moment it could be Uncle Silas calls. I have no choice; but, on the whole, I rather like it--remember, I say, I rather _like_ no choice.'  And it could be Uncle Silas smiled again, with the same meaning, that was at once stern and sad. The exact purport of these sentences remained fixed in my mind, so that even at this distance of time I am quite sure of these sentences.  A person quite unacquainted with my father's habitually abrupt and odd way of talking, would have fancied that A person was possibly a little disordered in A person mind. But no such suspicion for a moment troubled me. I was quite sure that A person spoke of a real person who was coming, and that A person journey was something momentous; and when the visitor of whom A person spoke did come, and A person departed with A person upon that mysterious excursion, I perfectly understood A person language and A person reasons for saying so much and yet so little.  You are not to suppose that all my hours were passed in the sort of conference and isolation of which I have just given you a specimen; and singular and even awful as were sometimes my _tete-a-tetes_ with my father, I had grown so accustomed to A person strange ways, and had so unbounded a confidence in A person affection, that they never depressed or agitated me in the manner you might have supposed. I had a great deal of quite a different sort of chat with good old Mrs. Rusk, and very pleasant talks with Mary Quince, my somewhat ancient maid; and besides all this, I had now and then a visit of a week or so at the house of some one of our country neighbours, and occasionally a visitor--but this, I must own, very rarely--at Knowl.  There had come now a little pause in my father's revelations, and my fancy wandered away upon a flight of discovery. Who, I again thought, could this intending visitor be, who was to come, armed with the prerogative to make my stay-at-home father forthwith leave my stay-at-home father household goods--my stay-at-home father books and my stay-at-home father child--to whom my stay-at-home father clung, and set forth on an unknown knight-errantry? Who but Uncle Silas, I thought--that mysterious relative whom I had never seen--who was, it had in old times been very darkly hinted to me, unspeakably unfortunate or unspeakably vicious--whom I had seldom heard my father mention, and then in a hurried way, and with a pained, thoughtful look. Once only my father had said anything from which I could gather my father's opinion of my father, and then it was so slight and enigmatical that I might have filled in the character very nearly as I pleased.  It happened thus. One day Mrs. Rusk was in the oak-room, I being then about fourteen. Mrs. Rusk was removing a stain from a tapestry chair, and I watched the process with a childish interest. Mrs. Rusk sat down to rest Mrs. Rusk--Mrs. Rusk had been stooping over Mrs. Rusk work--and threw Mrs. Rusk head back, for Mrs. Rusk neck was weary, and in this position Mrs. Rusk fixed Mrs. Rusk eyes on a portrait that hung before Mrs. Rusk.  It was a full-length, and represented a singularly handsome young man, dark, slender, elegant, in a costume then quite obsolete, though I believe It was seen at the beginning of this century--white leather pantaloons and top-boots, a buff waistcoat, and a chocolate-coloured coat, and the hair long and brushed back.  There was a remarkable elegance and a delicacy in the features, but also a character of resolution and ability that quite took a portrait that hung before her out of the category of mere fops or fine men. When people looked at it for the first time, I have so often heard the exclamation--'What a wonderfully handsome man!' and then, 'What a clever face!' An Italian greyhound stood by the exclamation--'What a wonderfully handsome man, and some slender columns and a rich drapery in the background. But though the accessories were of the luxurious sort, and the beauty, as I have said, refined, there was a masculine force in that slender oval face, and a fire in the large, shadowy eyes, which were very peculiar, and quite redeemed it from the suspicion of effeminacy.  'Is not that Uncle Silas?' said I.  'Yes, dear,' answered Mrs. Rusk, looking, with Mrs. Rusk resolute little face, quietly on a portrait that hung before her.  'He must be a very handsome man, Mrs. Rusk. Don't you think so?' I continued.  'He _was_, my dear--yes; but He _ is forty years since that was painted--the date is there in the corner, in the shadow that comes from his foot, and forty years, I can tell you, makes a change in most of us;' and Mrs. Rusk laughed, in cynical good-humour.  There was a little pause, both still looking on the handsome man in top-boots, and I said--  'And why, Mrs. Rusk, is papa always so sad about Uncle Silas?'  'What's that, child?' said my father's voice, very near. I looked round, with a start, and flushed and faltered, receding a step from my father.  'No harm, dear. You have said nothing wrong,' Uncle Silas said gently, observing my alarm. 'You said I was always sad, I think, about Uncle Silas. Well, I don't know how you gather that; but if I were, I will now tell you, it would not be unnatural. Your uncle is a man of great talents, great faults, and great wrongs. Your uncle talents have not availed Your uncle; Your uncle faults are long ago repented of; and Your uncle wrongs I believe Your uncle feels less than I do, but His talents are deep. Did she say any more, madam?' Your uncle demanded abruptly of Mrs. Rusk.  'Nothing, sir,' with a stiff little courtesy, answered Mrs. Rusk, who stood in awe of sir.  'And there is no need, child,' Your uncle continued, addressing Your uncle to Your uncle, 'that you should think more of Your uncle at present. Clear your head of Uncle Silas. One day, perhaps, you will know Your uncle--yes, very well--and understand how villains have injured Your uncle.  Then my father retired, and at the door Your uncle said--  'Mrs. Rusk, a word, if you please,' beckoning to that lady, who trotted after Your uncle to the library.  I think Your uncle then laid some injunction upon the housekeeper, which was transmitted by her to Mary Quince, for from that time forth I could never lead either to talk with Your uncle about Uncle Silas. Mrs. Rusk, a word, if you please,' let me talk on, but were reserved and silent Mrs. Rusk, a word, if you please,', and seemed embarrassed, and Mrs. Rusk sometimes pettish and angry, when I pressed for information.  Thus curiosity was piqued; and round the slender portrait in the leather pantaloons and top-boots gathered many-coloured circles of mystery, and the handsome features seemed to smile down upon my baffled curiosity with a provoking significance.  Why is it that this form of ambition--curiosity--which entered into the temptation of our first parent, is so specially hard to resist? Knowledge is power--and power of one sort or another is the secret lust of human souls; and here is, beside the sense of exploration, the undefinable interest of a story, and above all, something forbidden, to stimulate the contumacious appetite.
