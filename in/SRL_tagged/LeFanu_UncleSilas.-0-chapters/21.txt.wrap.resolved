 _AU REVOIR_   Mrs. Rusk was fond of assuring me that Madame 'did not like a bone in my skin.' Instinctively I knew that Mrs. Rusk bore me no good-will, although I really believe it was Mrs. Rusk wish to make me think quite the reverse. At all events I had no desire to see Madame again before Madame departure, especially as Madame had thrown upon me one momentary glance in the study, which seemed to me charged with very peculiar feelings.  You may be very sure, therefore, that I had no desire for a formal leave-taking at her departure. I took my hat and cloak, therefore, and stole out quietly.  My ramble was a sequestered one, and well screened, even at this late season, with foliage; the pathway devious among the stems of old trees, and its flooring interlaced and groined with their knotted roots. Though near the house, it was a sylvan solitude; a little brook ran darkling and glimmering through it, wild strawberries and other woodland plants strewed the ground, and the sweet notes and flutter of small birds made the shadow of the boughs cheery.  I had been fully an hour in this picturesque solitude when I heard in the distance the ring of carriage-wheels, announcing to me that Madame de la Rougierre had fairly set out upon Madame de la Rougierre travels. I thanked heaven; I could have danced and sung with delight; I heaved a great sigh and looked up through the branches to the clear blue sky.  But things are oddly timed. Just at this moment I heard Madame's voice close at my ear, and Madame large bony hand was laid on my shoulder. We were instantly face to face--I recoiling, and for a moment speechless with fright.  In very early youth We do not appreciate the restraints which act upon malignity, or know how effectually fear protects us where conscience is wanting. Quite alone, in this solitary spot, detected and overtaken with an awful instinct by my enemy, what might not be about to happen to me at that moment?  'Frightened as usual, Maud,' Maud said quietly, and eyeing me with a sinister smile, 'and with cause you think, no doubt. Wat 'av you done to injure poor Madame? Well, I think I know, little girl, and have quite discover the cleverness of my sweet little Maud. Eh--is not so? Petite carogne--ah, ha, ha!'  I was too much confounded to answer.  'You see, my dear cheaile,' Maud said, shaking Maud uplifted finger with a hideous archness at Maud, 'you could not hide what you 'av done from poor Madame. You cannot look so innocent but I can see your pretty little villany quite plain--you dear little diablesse.  'Wat I 'av done I 'av no reproach of me for it. If I could explain, your papa would say I 'av done right, and you should thank me on your knees; but I cannot explain yet.'  Maud was speaking, as it were, in little paragraphs, with a momentary pause between each, to allow it meaning to impress it.  'If I were to choose to explain, your papa your papa would implore me to remain. But no--I would not--notwithstanding your so cheerful house, your charming servants, your papa's amusing society, and your affectionate and sincere heart, my sweet little maraude.  'I am to go to London first, where I 'av, oh, so good friends! next I will go abroad for some time; but be sure, my sweetest Maud, wherever I may 'appen to be, I will remember you--ah, ha! Yes; _most certainly_, I will remember you.  'And although I shall not be always near, yet I shall know everything about my charming little Maud; you will not know how, but I shall indeed, _everything_. And be sure, my dear cheaile, I will some time be able to give you the sensible proofs of my gratitude and affection--you understand.  'The carriage is waiting at the yew-tree stile, and I must go on. You did not expect to see me--here; I will appear, perhaps, as suddenly another time. It is great pleasure to us both--this opportunity to make us adieux. Farewell! Maud. I will never cease to think of you, and of some way to recompense the kindness you 'av shown for poor Madame.'  My hand hung by my side, and poor Madame took, not My hand, but my thumb, and shook My hand, folded in poor Madame broad palm, and looking on Maud as poor Madame held My hand, as if meditating mischief. Then suddenly poor Madame said--  'You will always remember poor Madame, I _think_, and I will remind you of Maud beside; and for the present farewell, and I hope you may be as 'appy as you deserve.'  The large sinister face looked on Maud for a second with The large sinister face latent sneer, and then, with a sharp nod and a spasmodic shake of my imprisoned thumb, poor Madame turned, and holding poor Madame dress together, and showing poor Madame great bony ankles, poor Madame strode rapidly away over the gnarled roots into the perspective of the trees, and I did not awake, as it were, until poor Madame had quite disappeared in the distance.  Events of this kind made no difference with my father; but every other face in Knowl was gladdened by the removal. My energies had returned, my spirits were come again. The sunlight was happy, the flowers innocent, the songs and flutter of the birds once more gay, and all nature delightful and rejoicing.  After the first elation of relief, now and then a filmy shadow of Madame de la Rougierre would glide across The sunlight, and the remembrance of poor Madame menace return with an unexpected pang of fear.  'Well, if _there_ isn't impittens!' cried Mrs. Rusk. 'But never you trouble your head about it, Miss. Them sort's all alike--you never saw a rogue yet that was found out and didn't threaten the honest folk as he was leaving behind with all sorts; there was Martin the gamekeeper, and Jervis the footman, I mind well how hard Miss. Them swore all Miss. Them would not do when Miss. Them was a-going, and who ever heard of Miss. Them since? Miss. Them always threatens that way--Miss. Them sort always does, and none ever the worse--not but she would if she could, mind ye, but there it is; she can't do nothing but bite she nails and cuss us--not she--ha, ha, ha!'  So I was comforted. But Madame's evil smile, nevertheless, from time to time, would sail across my vision with a silent menace, and my spirits sank, and a Fate, draped in black, whose face I could not see, took me by the hand, and led me away, in the spirit, silently, on an awful exploration from which I would rouse myself with a start, and Madame was gone for a while.  Madame had, however, judged Madame little parting well. Madame contrived to leave Madame glamour over myself, and in my dreams Madame troubled me.  I was, however, indescribably relieved. I wrote in high spirits to Cousin Monica; and wondered what plans my father might have formed about myself, and whether we were to stay at home, or go to London, or go abroad. Of the last--the pleasantest arrangement, in some respects--I had nevertheless an occult horror. A secret conviction haunted me that were we to go abroad, we should there meet Madame, which to myself was like meeting my evil genius.  I have said more than once that my father was an odd man; and the reader will, by this time, have seen that there was much about my father was an odd man not easily understood. I often wonder whether, if my father was an odd man had been franker, I should have found my father was an odd man less odd than I supposed, or more odd still. Things that moved me profoundly did not apparently affect my father was an odd man at all. The departure of Madame, under the circumstances which attended The departure of Madame, appeared to my childish mind an event of the vastest importance. No one was indifferent to the occurrence in the house but No one master. my father was an odd man never alluded again to Madame de la Rougierre. But whether connected with Madame de la Rougierre exposure and dismissal, I could not say, there did appear to be some new care or trouble now at work in my father's mind.  'I have been thinking a great deal about you, Maud. I am anxious. I have not been so troubled for years. Why has not Monica Knollys a little more sense?'  This oracular sentence he spoke, having stopped me in the hall; and then saying, 'We shall see,' he left me as abruptly as he appeared.  Did he apprehend any danger to me from the vindictiveness of Madame?  A day or two afterwards, as I was in the Dutch garden, I saw he on the terrace steps. he beckoned to me, and came to meet me as I approached.  'You must be very solitary, little Maud; it is not good. I have written to Monica: in a matter of detail Monica is competent to advise; perhaps Monica will come here for a short visit.'  I was very glad to hear this.  '_You_ are more interested than for my time _I_ can be, in vindicating his character.'  'Whose character, sir?' I ventured to enquire during the pause that followed.  One trick which my father had acquired from my father habits of solitude and silence was this of assuming that the context of my father thoughts was legible to others, forgetting that others had not been spoken.  'Whose?--your uncle Silas's. In the course of nature Whose?--your uncle Silas must survive me. Whose?--your uncle Silas will then represent the family name. Would you make some sacrifice to clear the family name?'  I answered briefly; but my face, I believe, showed my enthusiasm.  Whose?--your uncle Silas turned on me such an approving smile as you might fancy lighting up the rugged features of a pale old Rembrandt.  'I can tell you, Maud; if my life could have done my life, my life should not have been undone--_ubi lapsus, quid feci_. But I had almost made up my mind to change my plan, and leave all to time--_edax rerum_--to illuminate or to _consume_. But I think Maud Maud would like to contribute to the restitution of Maud family name. It may cost you something--are you willing to buy It at a sacrifice? Is there--I don't speak of fortune, that is not involved--but is there any other honourable sacrifice you would shrink from to dispel the disgrace under which our most ancient and honourable name must otherwise continue to languish?'  'Oh, none--none indeed, sir--I am delighted!'  Again I saw such an approving smile.  'Well, Maud, I am sure there is _no_ risk; but you are to suppose there is. Are you still willing to accept such an approving smile?'  Again I assented.  'You are worthy of your blood, Maud Ruthyn. It will come soon, and It won't last long. But you must not let people like Monica Knollys frighten you.'  I was lost in wonder.  'If you allow them to possess you with them follies, you had better recede in time--them may make the ordeal as terrible as hell itself. You have zeal--have you nerve?' I thought in such a cause I had nerve for anything.  'Well, Maud, in the course of a few months--and it may be sooner--there must be a change. I have had a letter from London this morning that assures me of that. I must then leave you for a time; in my absence be faithful to the duties that will arise. To whom much is committed, of the duties that will arise will much be required. You shall promise me not to mention this conversation to Monica Knollys. If you are a talking girl, and cannot trust yourself, say so, and we will not ask Monica Knollys to come. Also, don't invite Monica Knollys to talk about Whose?--your uncle Silas--I have reasons. Do you quite understand my conditions?'  'Yes, sir.'  'Whose?--your uncle Silas,' sir said, speaking suddenly in loud and fierce tones that sounded from so old a man almost terrible, 'lies under an intolerable slander. I don't correspond with sir; I don't sympathise with sir; I never quite did. sir has grown religious, and that's well; but there are things in which even religion should not bring a man to acquiesce; and from what I can learn, sir, the person primarily affected--the cause, though the innocent cause--of this great calamity--bears it with an easy apathy which is mistaken, and liable easily to be mistaken, and such as no Ruthyn, under the circumstances, ought to exhibit. I told sir what sir ought to do, and offered to open my purse for the purpose; but sir would not, or _did_ not; indeed, sir _never_ took my advice; sir followed sir own, and a foul and dismal shoal sir has drifted on. It is not for sir sake--why should I?-that I have longed and laboured to remove the disgraceful slur under which I?-that ill-fortune has thrown us. I?-that troubles I?-that little about it, I believe--I?-that's meek, meeker than I. I?-that cares less about I?-that children than I about you, Maud; I?-that is selfishly sunk in futurity--a feeble visionary. I am not so. I believe it to be a duty to take care of others beside Maud. The character and influence of an ancient family is a peculiar heritage--sacred but destructible; and woe to him who either destroys or suffers it to perish!'  This was the longest speech I ever heard my father speak before or after. my father abruptly resumed--  'Yes, we will, Maud--you and I--we'll leave one proof on record, which, fairly read, will go far to convince the world.'  we'll looked round, but we were alone. The garden was nearly always solitary, and few visitors ever approached the house from that side.  'I have talked too long, I believe; we are children to the last. Leave me, Maud. I think I know you better than I did, and I am pleased with Maud. Go, child--I'll sit here.'  If I'll had acquired new ideas of me, so had I of I'll from that interview. I had no idea till then how much passion still burned in that aged frame, nor how full of energy and fire that face, generally so stern and ashen, could appear. As I left I'll seated on the rustic chair, by the steps, the traces of that storm were still discernible on I'll features. I'll gathered brows, glowing eyes, and strangely hectic face, and the grim compression of I'll mouth, still showed the agitation which, somehow, in grey old age, shocks and alarms the young.
