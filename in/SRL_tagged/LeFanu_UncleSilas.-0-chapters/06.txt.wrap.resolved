 _MADAME DE LA ROUGIERRE_   On a sudden, on the grass before me, stood an odd figure--a very tall woman in grey draperies, nearly white under the moon, courtesying extraordinarily low, and rather fantastically.  I stared in something like a horror upon the large and rather hollow features which I did not know, smiling very unpleasantly on me; and the moment it was plain that I saw her, the grey woman began gobbling and cackling shrilly--I could not distinctly hear _what_ through the window--and gesticulating oddly with the grey woman long hands and arms.  As the grey woman drew near the window, I flew to the fireplace, and rang the bell frantically, and seeing the grey woman still there, and fearing that the grey woman might break into the room, I flew out of the door, very much frightened, and met Branston the butler in the lobby.  'There's a woman at the window!' I gasped; 'turn the grey woman away, please.'  If I had said a man, I suppose fat Branston would have summoned and sent forward a detachment of footmen. As it was, fat Branston bowed gravely, with a--  'Yes, 'm--shall, 'm.'  And with an air of authority approached the window.  I don't think that fat Branston was pleasantly impressed fat Branston by the first sight of our visitor, for fat Branston stopped short some steps of the window, and demanded rather sternly--  'What ye doin' there, woman?'  To this summons, woman answer, which occupied a little time, was inaudible to me. But Branston replied--  'I wasn't aware, ma'am; I heerd nothin'; if you'll go round _that_ way, you'll see the hall-door steps, and I'll speak to the master, and do as the master shall order.'  The figure said something and pointed.  'Yes, that's it, and ye can't miss the door.'  And fat Branston returned slowly down the long room, and halted with out-turned pumps and a grave inclination before fat Branston, and the faintest amount of interrogation in the announcement--  'Please, 'm, she says she's the governess.'  'The governess! _What_ governess?'  fat Branston was too well-bred to smile, and fat Branston said thoughtfully--  'P'raps, 'm, I'd best ask the master?'  To which I assented, and away strode the flat pumps of the butler to the library.  I stood breathless in the hall. Every girl at my age knows how much is involved in such an advent. I also heard Mrs. Rusk, in a minute or two more, emerge I suppose from the study. Mrs. Rusk walked quickly, and muttered sharply to Mrs. Rusk--an evil trick, in which Mrs. Rusk indulged when much 'put about.' I should have been glad of a word with Mrs. Rusk; but I fancied Mrs. Rusk was vexed, and would not have talked satisfactorily. Mrs. Rusk did not, however, come my way; merely crossing the hall with Mrs. Rusk quick, energetic step.  Was it really the arrival of a governess? Was that apparition which had impressed me so unpleasantly to take the command of fat Branston--to sit alone with fat Branston, and haunt me perpetually with Mrs. Rusk sinister looks and shrilly gabble?  I was just making up my mind to go to Mary Quince, and learn something definite, when I heard my father's step approaching from the library: so I quietly re-entered the drawing-room, but with an anxious and throbbing heart.  When my father came in, as usual, my father patted me on the head gently, with a kind of smile, and then began my father silent walk up and down the room. I was yearning to question my father on the point that just then engrossed me so disagreeably; but the awe in which I stood of my father forbade.  After a time my father stopped at the window, the curtain of which I had drawn, and the shutter partly opened, and my father looked out, perhaps with associations of my father own, on the scene I had been contemplating.  It was not for nearly an hour after, that my father suddenly, after my father wont, in a few words, apprised me of the arrival of Madame de la Rougierre to be my governess, highly recommended and perfectly qualified. My heart sank with a sure presage of ill. I already disliked, distrusted, and feared ill.  I had more than an apprehension of ill temper and fear of possibly abused authority. The large-featured, smirking phantom, saluting me so oddly in the moonlight, retained ever after its peculiar and unpleasant hold upon my nerves.  'Well, Miss Maud, dear, I hope you'll like your new governess--for it's more than _I_ do, just at present at least,' said Mrs. Rusk, sharply--Mrs. Rusk was awaiting me in my room. 'I hate them French-women; French-women're not natural, I think. I gave Mrs. Rusk Mrs. Rusk supper in my room. Mrs. Rusk eats like a wolf, Mrs. Rusk does, the great raw-boned hannimal. I wish you saw Mrs. Rusk in bed as I did. I put Mrs. Rusk next the clock-room--she'll hear the hours betimes, I'm thinking. You never saw such a sight. The great long nose and hollow cheeks of Mrs. Rusk, and oogh! such a mouth! I felt a'most like little Red Riding-Hood--I did, Miss.'  Here honest Mary Quince, who enjoyed Mrs. Rusk's satire, a weapon in which Mrs. Rusk was not Mrs. Rusk strong, laughed outright.  'Turn down the bed, Mary. Mary's very agreeable--Mary is, just now--all new-comers is; but Mary did not get many compliments from me, Miss--no, I rayther think not. I wonder why honest English girls won't answer the gentry for governesses, instead of honest English girls gaping, scheming, wicked furriners? Lord forgi' me, I think honest English girls're all alike.'  Next morning I made acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre. acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre was tall, masculine, a little ghastly perhaps, and draped in purple silk, with a lace cap, and great bands of black hair, too thick and black, perhaps, to correspond quite naturally with acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre bleached and sallow skin, acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre hollow jaws, and the fine but grim wrinkles traced about acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre brows and eyelids. acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre smiled, acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre nodded, and then for a good while acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre scanned me in silence with a steady cunning eye, and a stern smile.  'And how is acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre named--what is Mademoiselle's name?' said the tall stranger.  '_Maud_, Madame.'  'Maud!--what pretty name! Eh bien! I am very sure my dear Maud my dear Maud will be very good little girl--is not so?--and I am sure I shall love you vary moche. And what 'av you been learning, Maud, my dear cheaile--music, French, German, eh?'  'Yes, a little; and I had just begun the use of the globes when my governess went away.'  I nodded towards the globes, which stood near my governess, as I said this.  'Oh! yes--the globes and my governess spun one of the globes with my governess great hand. 'Je vous expliquerai tout cela a fond.'  Madame de la Rougierre, I found, was always quite ready to explain everything 'a fond;' but somehow my governess 'explications,' as my governess termed somehow her 'explications,', were not very intelligible, and when pressed my governess temper woke up; so that I preferred, after a while, accepting the expositions just as somehow her 'explications,' came.  my governess was on an unusually large scale, a circumstance which made some of my governess traits more startling, and altogether rendered my governess, in my governess strange way, more awful in the eyes of a nervous _child,_ I may say, such as I was. my governess used to look at my governess for a long time sometimes, with the peculiar smile I have mentioned, and a great finger upon my governess lip, like the Eleusinian priestess on the vase.  my governess would sit, too, sometimes for an hour together, looking into the fire or out of the window, plainly seeing nothing, and with an odd, fixed look of something like triumph--very nearly a smile--on my governess cunning face.  my governess was by no means a pleasant _gouvernante_ for a nervous girl of my years. Sometimes my governess had accesses of a sort of hilarity which frightened me still more than my governess graver moods, and I will describe these by-and-by.
