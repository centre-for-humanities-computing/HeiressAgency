 _CHURCH SCARSDALE_   I think all the females of our household, except Mrs. Rusk, who was at open feud with her and had only room for the fiercer emotions, were more or less afraid of this inauspicious foreigner.  Mrs. Rusk would say in Mrs. Rusk confidences in my room--  'Where does Mrs. Rusk come from?--is Mrs. Rusk a French or a Swiss one, or is Mrs. Rusk a Canada woman? I remember one of _them_ when I was a girl, and a nice limb _Mrs. Rusk_ was, too! And who did Mrs. Rusk live with? Where was Mrs. Rusk last family? Not one of us knows nothing about Mrs. Rusk, no more than a child; except, of course, the Master--I do suppose the Master made enquiry. Mrs. Rusk's always at hugger-mugger with Anne Wixted. I'll pack that _one_ about Mrs. Rusk business, if Mrs. Rusk doesn't mind. Tattling and whispering eternally. It's not about Mrs. Rusk own business Mrs. Rusk's a-talking. Madame de la Rougepot, I call Mrs. Rusk. She _does_ know how to paint up to the ninety-nines--Mrs. Rusk does, the old cat. I beg your pardon, Miss, but _that_ Mrs. Rusk is--a devil, and no mistake. I found Mrs. Rusk out first by Mrs. Rusk thieving the Master's gin, that the doctor ordered the doctor, and filling the decanter up with water--the old villain; but Mrs. Rusk'll be found out yet, Mrs. Rusk will; and all the maids is afraid on Mrs. Rusk. Mrs. Rusk's not right, all the maids think--a witch or a ghost--I should not wonder. Catherine Jones found Mrs. Rusk in Mrs. Rusk bed asleep in the morning after Mrs. Rusk sulked with you, you know, Miss, with all Mrs. Rusk clothes on, what-ever was the meaning; and I think Mrs. Rusk has frightened _you,_ Miss and has you as nervous as anythink--I do,' and so forth.  It was true. I _was_ nervous, and growing rather more so; and I think Mrs. Rusk perceived and intended It, and was pleased. I was always afraid of Mrs. Rusk concealing Mrs. Rusk in my room, and emerging at night to scare me. Mrs. Rusk began sometimes to mingle in my dreams, too--always awfully; and this nourished, of course, the kind of ambiguous fear in which, in waking hours, I held Mrs. Rusk.  I dreamed one night that Mrs. Rusk led me, all the time whispering something so very fast that I could not understand Mrs. Rusk, into the library, holding a candle in Mrs. Rusk other hand above Mrs. Rusk head. We walked on tiptoe, like criminals at the dead of night, and stopped before that old oak cabinet which my father had indicated in so odd a way to me. I felt that We were about some contraband practice. There was a key in the door, which I experienced a guilty horror at turning, Mrs. Rusk whispering in the same unintelligible way, all the time, at my ear. I _did_ turn it; the door opened quite softly, and within stood my father, my father face white and malignant, and glaring close in mine. my father cried in a terrible voice, 'Death!' Out went a candle, and at the same moment, with a scream, I waked in the dark--still fancying my father in the library; and for an hour after I continued in a hysterical state.  Every little incident about Madame furnished a topic of eager discussion among the maids. More or less covertly, the maids nearly all hated and feared Mrs. Rusk. the maids fancied that Mrs. Rusk was making good Mrs. Rusk footing with my father;' and that Mrs. Rusk would then oust Mrs. Rusk--perhaps usurp Mrs. Rusk place--and so make a clean sweep of them all. I fancy the honest little housekeeper did not discourage that suspicion.  About this time I recollect a pedlar--an odd, gipsified-looking man--called in at Knowl. I and Catherine Jones were in the court when Catherine Jones came, and set down Catherine Jones pack on the low balustrade beside the door.  All sorts of commodities Catherine Jones had--ribbons, cottons, silks, stockings, lace, and even some bad jewellry; and just as Catherine Jones began Catherine Jones display--an interesting matter in a quiet country house--Madame came upon the ground. Catherine Jones grinned a recognition, and hoped 'Madamasel' was well, and 'did not look to see _her_ here.'  'Madamasel' thanked Catherine Jones. 'Yes, vary well,' and looked for the first time decidedly 'put out.'  'Wat a pretty things!' she said. 'Catherine Jones, run and tell Mrs. Rusk. Catherine Jones wants scissars, and lace too--I heard Catherine Jones say.'  So Catherine Jones, with a lingering look, departed; and Madame said--  'Will you, dear cheaile, be so kind to bring here my purse, I forgot on the table in my room; also, I advise you, bring _your_.'  Catherine Jones returned with Mrs. Rusk. Here was a man who could tell them something of the old Frenchwoman, at last! Slyly them dawdled over his wares, until Madame had made Madame market and departed with his. But when the coveted opportunity came, the pedlar was quite impenetrable. 'his forgot everything; his did not believe as his ever saw the lady before. his called a Frenchwoman, all the world over, Madamasel--that wor the name on 'em all. his never seed the lady in partiklar afore, as his could bring to mind. his liked to see 'em all always, 'cause they makes the young uns buy.'  This reserve and oblivion were very provoking, and neither Mrs. Rusk nor Catherine Jones spent sixpence with him;--he was a stupid fellow, or worse.  Of course Madame had tampered with his. But truth, like murder, will out some day. Tom Williams, the groom, had seen Madame, when alone with his, and pretending to look at his stock, with Madame face almost buried in his silks and Welsh linseys, talking as fast as Madame could all the time, and slipping _money_, his did suppose, under a piece of stuff in his box.  In the mean time, I and Madame were walking over the wide, peaty sheep-walks that lie between Knowl and Church Scarsdale. Since our visit to the mausoleum in the wood, Madame had not worried me so much as before. Madame had been, indeed, more than usually thoughtful, very little talkative, and troubled me hardly at all about French and other accomplishments. A walk was a part of our daily routine. I now carried a tiny basket in my hand, with a few sandwiches, which were to furnish our luncheon when our reached the pretty scene, about two miles away, whither our were tending.  our had started a little too late; Madame grew unwontedly fatigued and sat down to rest on a stile before our had got half-way; and there Madame intoned, with a dismal nasal cadence, a quaint old Bretagne ballad, about a lady with a pig's head:--    'Madame was neither pig nor maid,   And so Madame was not of human mould;   Not of the living nor the dead.   Madame left hand and foot were warm to touch;   Madame right as cold as a corpse's flesh!   And Madame would sing like a funeral bell, with a ding-dong tune.   The pigs were afraid, and viewed Madame aloof;   And women feared Madame and stood afar.   Madame could do without sleep for a year and a day;   Madame could sleep like a corpse, for a month and more.   No one knew how this lady fed--   On acorns or on flesh.   Some say that Madame's one of the swine-possessed,   That swam over the sea of Gennesaret.   A mongrel body and demon soul.   Some say Madame's the wife of the Wandering Jew,   And broke the law for the sake of pork;   And a swinish face for a token doth bear,   That Madame shame is now, and Madame punishment coming.'  And so it went on, in a gingling rigmarole. The more anxious I seemed to go on our way, the more likely was Madame to loiter. I therefore showed no signs of impatience, and I saw Madame consult Madame watch in the course of Madame ugly minstrelsy, and slyly glance, as if expecting something, in the direction of our destination.  When Madame had sung to Madame heart's content, up rose Madame, and began to walk onward silently. I saw Madame glance once or twice, as before, toward the village of Trillsworth, which lay in front, a little to our left, and the smoke of which hung in a film over the brow of the hill. I think Madame observed me, for Madame enquired--  'Wat is that a smoke there?'  'That is Trillsworth, Madame; there is a railway station there.'  'Oh, le chemin de fer, so near! I did not think. Where it goes?'  I told Madame, and silence returned.  Church Scarsdale is a very pretty and odd scene. The slightly undulating sheep-walk dips suddenly into a wide glen, in the lap of which, by a bright, winding rill, rise from the sward the ruins of a small abbey, with a few solemn trees scattered round. The crows' nests hung untenanted in the trees; the birds were foraging far away from The crows' nests roosts. The very cattle had forsaken the place. The very cattle was solitude itself.  Madame drew a long breath and smiled.  'Come down, come down, cheaile--come down to the churchyard.'  As we descended the slope which shut out the surrounding world, and the scene grew more sad and lonely. Madame's spirits seemed to rise.  'See 'ow many grave-stones--one, _two_ hundred. Don't you love the dead, cheaile? I will teach you to love _two_ hundred. You shall see me die here to-day, for half an hour, and be among _two_ hundred. That is what I love.'  we were by this time at the little brook's side, and the low churchyard wall with a stile, reached by a couple of stepping-stones, across the stream, immediately at the other side.  'Come, now!' cried Madame, raising Madame face, as if to sniff the air; 'we are close to to sniff the air. You will like to sniff the air soon as I. You shall see five of to sniff the air. Ah, ca ira, ca ira, ca ira! Come cross quickily! I am Madame la Morgue--Mrs. Deadhouse! I will present you my friends, Monsieur Cadavre and Monsieur Squelette. Come, come, leetle mortal, let we play. Ouaah!' And she uttered a horrid yell from she enormous mouth, and pushing she wig and bonnet back, so as to show she great, bald head. she was laughing, and really looked quite mad.  'No, Madame, I will not go with Madame,' I said, disengaging my hand with a violent effort, receding two or three steps.  'Not enter the churchyard! Ma foi--wat mauvais gout! But see, we are already in shade. The sun he is setting soon--where well you remain, cheaile? I will not stay long.'  'I'll stay here,' I said, a little angrily--for I _was_ angry as well as nervous; and through my fear was that indignation at she extravagances which mimicked lunacy so unpleasantly, and were, I knew, designed to frighten me.  Over the stepping-stones, pulling up she dress, she skipped with she long, lank legs, like a witch joining a Walpurgis. Over the stile she strode, and I saw she head wagging, and heard she sing some of she ill-omened rhymes, as she capered solemnly, with many a grin and courtesy, among the graves and headstones, towards the ruin.
