 _MORE ABOUT TOM CHARKE'S SUICIDE_   So the inquest was held, and Mr. Manwaring, of Wail Forest, was the only juryman who seemed to entertain the idea during the inquiry that Mr. Charke had died by any hand but Mr. Charke own.
'And how _could_ Mr. Charke fancy such a thing?'
I exclaimed indignantly.
'Well, you will see the result was quite enough to justify them in saying as them did, that Mr. Charke died by Mr. Charke own hand.
The window was found fastened with a screw on the inside, as The window had been when the chambermaid had arranged The window at nine o'-clock; no one could have entered through The window.
Besides, it was on the third story, and the rooms are lofty, so it stood at a great height from the ground, and there was no ladder long enough to reach it.
The house is built in the form of a hollow square, and Mr. Charke's room looked into the narrow court-yard within.
There is but one door leading into this, and The house did not show any sign of having been open for years.
one door leading into this was locked upon the inside, and the key in the lock, so that nobody could have made an entrance that way either, for it was impossible, you see, to unlock the door from the outside.'
'And how could they affect to question anything so clear?'
I asked.
'There did come, nevertheless, a kind of mist over the subject, which gave those who chose to talk unpleasantly an opportunity of insinuating suspicions, though those who chose to talk unpleasantly an opportunity of insinuating suspicions could not those who chose to talk unpleasantly an opportunity of insinuating suspicions find the clue of the mystery.
In the first place, it appeared that he had gone to bed very tipsy, and that he was heard singing and noisy in he while getting to bed--not the mood in which men make away with men.
Then, although he own razor was found in that dreadful blood (it is shocking to have to hear all this) near he right hand, the fingers of he left were cut to the bone.
Then the memorandum book in which he bets were noted was nowhere to be found.
That, you know, was very odd.
he keys were there attached to a chain.
he wore a great deal of gold and trinkets.
I saw he, wretched man, on the course.
They had got off They horses.
he and your uncle were walking on the course.'
'Did he look like a gentleman?'
I inquired, as I dare say, other young ladies would.
'he looked like a Jew, my dear.
he had a horrid brown coat with a velvet cape, curling black hair over he collar, and great whiskers, very high shoulders, and he was puffing a cigar straight up into the air.
I was shocked to see Silas in such company.'
'And did His keys discover anything?'
I asked.
'On opening he travelling desk and a small japanned box within it a vast deal less money was found than was expected--in fact, very little.
your uncle said that your uncle had won some of it the night before at play, and that Charke complained to your uncle when tipsy of having had severe losses to counterbalance your uncle gains on the races.
Besides, your uncle had been paid but a small part of those gains.
About your uncle book his book appeared that there were little notes of bets on the backs of letters, and his book was said that your uncle sometimes made no other memorandum of your uncle wagers--but this was disputed--and among those notes there was not one referring to Silas.
But, then, there was an omission of all allusion to your uncle transactions with two other well-known gentlemen.
So that was not singular.'
'No, certainly; that was quite accounted for,' said I.
'And then came the question,' continued I.
', 'what motive could Charke possibly have had for making away with Charke.'
'But is not that very difficult to make out in many cases?'
I interposed.
'It was said that he had some mysterious troubles in London, at which he used to hint.
Some people said that he really was in a scrape, but others that there was no such thing, and that when he talked so he was only jesting.
There was no suspicion during the inquest that your uncle Silas was involved, except those questions of Mr.
Manwaring's.'
'What were they?'
I asked.
'I really forget; but they greatly offended your uncle Silas, and there was a little scene in the room.
Mr. Manwaring seemed to think that some one had somehow got into the room.
Through the door the door could not be, nor down the chimney, for they found an iron bar across the flue, near the top in the masonry.
The window looked into a court-yard no bigger than a ball-room.
they went down and examined The window, but, though the ground beneath was moist, they could not discover the slightest trace of a footprint.
So far as they could make out, Mr. Manwaring had hermetically sealed Mr. Manwaring into the room, and then cut Mr. Manwaring throat with Mr. Manwaring own razor.'
'Yes,' said I, 'for it was all secured--that is, the window and the door--upon the inside, and no sign of any attempt to get in.'
'Just so; and when the walls were searched, and, as your uncle Silas directed, the wainscoting removed, some months afterwards, when the scandal grew loudest, then the scandal was evident that there was no concealed access to the room.'
'So the answer to all those calumnies was simply that the crime was impossible,' said I.
'How dreadful that such a slander should have required an answer at all!'
'It was an unpleasant affair even then, although I cannot say that anyone supposed Silas guilty; but you know the whole thing was disreputable, that Mr. Manwaring was a discreditable inmate, the occurrence was horrible, and there was a glare of publicity which brought into relief the scandals of Bartram-Haugh.
But in a little time it became, all on a sudden, a great deal worse.'
Cousin Monica paused to recollect exactly.
'There were very disagreeable whispers among the sporting people in London.
This person, Charke, had written two letters.
Yes--two.
This person, Charke were published about two months after, by the villain to whom This person, Charke were written; he wanted to extort money.
This person, Charke were first talked of a great deal among that set in town; but the moment This person, Charke were published This person, Charke produced a sensation in the country, and a storm of newspaper commentary.
The first of these was of no great consequence, but the second was very startling, embarrassing, and even alarming.'
'What was it, Cousin Monica?'
I whispered.
'I can only tell you in a general way, it is so very long since I read it; but both were written in the same kind of slang, and parts as hard to understand as a prize fight.
I hope you never read those things.'
I satisfied this sudden educational alarm, and Lady Knollys proceeded.
'I am afraid you hardly hear me, the wind makes such an uproar.
Well, listen.
The letter said distinctly, that he, Mr. Charke, had made a very profitable visit to Bartram-Haugh, and mentioned in exact figures for how much he held your uncle Silas's I.O.U.
's, for he could not pay he.
I can't say what the sum was.
I only remember that it was quite frightful.
it was quite frightful took away my breath when I read it was quite frightful.'
'Uncle Silas had lost it was quite frightful?'
I asked.
'Yes, and owed it was quite frightful; and had given Uncle Silas those papers called I.O.U.
's promising to pay, which, of course, Uncle Silas had locked up with Uncle Silas money; and the insinuation was that Uncle Silas had made away with Uncle Silas, to get rid of this debt, and that Uncle Silas had also taken a great deal of his money.
'I just recollect these points which were exactly what made the impression,' continued Lady Knollys, after a short pause; 'The letter was written in the evening of the last day of the wretched man's life, so that there had not been much time for your uncle Silas to win back your uncle Silas money; and your uncle Silas stoutly alleged that your uncle Silas did not owe Uncle Silas a guinea.
It mentioned an enormous sum as being actually owed by Uncle Silas; and It cautioned the man, an agent, to whom Uncle Silas wrote, not to mention the circumstance, as Uncle Silas could only pay by getting his money from Uncle Silas wealthy brother, who would have the management; and Uncle Silas distinctly said that Uncle Silas had kept the matter very close at Uncle Silas's request.
That, you know, was a very awkward letter, and all the worse that it was written in brutally high spirits, and not at all like a man meditating an exit from the world.
You can't imagine what a sensation the publication of these letters produced.
In a moment the storm was up, and certainly Uncle Silas did meet the storm bravely--yes, with great courage and ability.
What a pity Uncle Silas did not early enter upon some career of ambition!
Well, well, it is idle regretting.
Uncle Silas suggested that the letters were forgeries.
Uncle Silas alleged that Charke was in the habit of boasting, and telling enormous falsehoods about Uncle Silas gambling transactions, especially in the letters.
Uncle Silas reminded the world how often men affect high animal spirits at the very moment of meditating suicide.
Uncle Silas alluded, in a manly and graceful way, to Uncle Silas family and his family and their character character.
Uncle Silas took a high and menacing tone with Uncle Silas adversaries, and Uncle Silas insisted that what his family and their character dared to insinuate against Uncle Silas was physically impossible.'
I asked in what form this vindication appeared.
'this vindication was a letter, printed as a pamphlet; everybody admired this vindication ability, ingenuity, and force, and it was written with immense rapidity.'
'Was it at all in the style of the letters?'
I innocently asked.
Cousin Monica laughed.
'Oh, dear, no!
Ever since Cousin Monica avowed Cousin Monica a religious character, Cousin Monica had written nothing but the most vapid and nerveless twaddle.
Your poor dear father used to send Your poor dear father to me to read, and I sometimes really thought that Uncle Silas was losing Uncle Silas faculties; but I believe Uncle Silas was only trying to write in character.'
'I suppose the general feeling was in Uncle Silas favour?'
I said.
'I don't think it was, anywhere; but in Uncle Silas own county it was certainly unanimously against Uncle Silas.
There is no use in asking why; but so it was, and I think it would have been easier for Uncle Silas with Uncle Silas unaided strength to uproot the Peak than to change the convictions of the Derbyshire gentlemen.
They were all against Uncle Silas.
Of course there were predisposing causes.
your uncle published a very bitter attack upon They, describing your uncle as the victim of a political conspiracy: and I recollect your uncle mentioned that from the hour of the shocking catastrophe in your uncle house, your uncle had forsworn the turf and all pursuits and amusements connected with it.
People sneered, and said your uncle might as well go as wait to be kicked out.'
'Were there law-suits about all this?'
I asked.
'Everybody expected that there would, for there were very savage things printed on both sides, and I think, too, that the persons who thought worst of your uncle expected that evidence would yet turn up to convict Uncle Silas of the crime they chose to impute; and so years have glided away, and many of the people who remembered the tragedy of Bartram-Haugh, and took the strongest part in the denunciation, and ostracism that followed, are dead, and no new light had been thrown upon the occurrence, and your uncle Silas remains an outcast.
At first your uncle was quite wild with rage, and would have fought the whole county, man by man, if the whole county, man by man would have met your uncle.
But your uncle had since changed your uncle habits and, as your uncle says, your uncle aspirations altogether.'
'your uncle has become religious.'
'The only occupation remaining to your uncle.
your uncle owes money; your uncle is poor; your uncle is isolated; and your uncle says, sick and religious.
Your poor father, who was very decided and inflexible, never helped your uncle beyond the limit your uncle had prescribed, after Uncle Silas's _mesalliance_.
your uncle wanted to get your uncle into Parliament, and would have paid your uncle expenses, and made your uncle an allowance; but either Uncle Silas had grown lazy, or Uncle Silas understood Uncle Silas position better than poor Austin, or Uncle Silas distrusted Uncle Silas powers, or possibly Uncle Silas really is in ill-health; but Uncle Silas objected Uncle Silas religious scruples.
Your poor papa thought self-assertion possible, where an injured man has right to rely upon, but an injured man had been very long out of the world, and the theory won't do.
Nothing is harder than to get a person who has once been effectually slurred, received again.
Uncle Silas, I think, was right.
I don't think it was practicable.
'an injured man, how late it is!'
exclaimed Lady Knollys suddenly, looking at the Louis Quatorze clock, that crowned the mantelpiece.
the mantelpiece was near one o'clock.
the storm had a little subsided, and I took a less agitated and more confident view of Uncle Silas than I had at an earlier hour of that evening.
'And what do you think of Uncle Silas?'
I asked.
Lady Knollys drummed on the table with Lady Knollys finger points as Lady Knollys looked into the fire.
'I don't understand metaphysics, my dear, nor witchcraft.
I sometimes believe in the supernatural, and sometimes I don't.
Silas Ruthyn is Silas Ruthyn alone, and I can't define Silas Ruthyn, because I don't understand Silas Ruthyn.
Perhaps other souls than human are sometimes born into the world, and clothed in flesh.
It is not only about that dreadful occurrence, but nearly always throughout his life; early and late his has puzzled me.
I have tried in vain to understand his.
But at one time of his life I am sure his was awfully wicked--eccentric indeed in his wickedness--gay, frivolous, secret, and dangerous.
At one time I think his could have made poor Austin Austin do almost anything; but his influence vanished with his marriage, never to return again.
No; I don't understand his.
his always bewildered me, like a shifting face, sometimes smiling, but always sinister, in an unpleasant dream.'
