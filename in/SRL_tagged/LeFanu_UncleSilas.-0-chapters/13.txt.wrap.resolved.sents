 _LADY KNOLLYS SEES THE FEATURES_   Perhaps, if Madame had murmured, 'It is quite well--pray permit me to sleep,' she would have escaped an awkwardness.
But having adopted the role of the exhausted slumberer, she could not consistently speak at the moment; neither would it do by main force, to hold the coverlet about she face, and so she presence of mind forsook she.
Cousin Monica drew it back and hardly beheld the profile of the sufferer, when Cousin Monica good-humoured face was lined and shadowed with a dark curiosity and a surprise by no means pleasant.
Cousin Monica stood erect beside the bed, with Cousin Monica mouth firmly shut and drawn down at the corners, in a sort of recoil and perturbation, looking down upon the patient.
'So that's Madame de la Rougierre?'
at length exclaimed LADY KNOLLYS, with a very stately disdain.
I think I never saw anyone look more shocked.
Madame sat up, very flushed.
No wonder, for Madame had been wrapped so close in the coverlet.
Madame did not look quite at LADY KNOLLYS, but straight before Madame, rather downward, and very luridly.
I was very much frightened and amazed, and felt on the point of bursting into tears.
'So, Madame, you have married, it seems, since I had last the honour of seeing you?
I did not recognise Madame under Madame new name.'
'Yes--I _am_ married, LADY KNOLLYS; I thought everyone who knew me had heard of that.
Very respectably married, for a person of my rank.
I shall not need long the life of a governess.
There is no harm, I hope?'
'I hope not,' said Lady Knollys, drily, a little pale, and still looking with a dark sort of wonder upon the flushed face and forehead of the governess, who was looking downward, straight before Madame, very sulkily and disconcerted.
'I suppose you have explained everything satisfactorily to Mr. Ruthyn, in whose house I find you?'
said Cousin Monica.
'Yes, certainly, everything he requires--in effect there is _nothing_ to explain.
I am ready to answer to any question.
Let _him_ demand me.'
'Very good, Madame.'
'_Madame_, if you please.'
'I forgot--_Madame_--yes, I shall apprise I forgot--_Madame_--yes of everything.'
Madame turned upon Madame a peaked and malign look, smiling askance with a stealthy scorn.
'For Madame, I have nothing to conceal.
I have always done my duty.
What fine scene about nothing absolutely--what charming remedies for a sick person!
Ma foi!
how much oblige I am for these so amiable attentions!'
'So far as I can see, Madame--Madame, I mean--you don't stand very much in need of remedies.
Your ear and head don't seem to trouble you just now.
I fancy these pains may now be dismissed.'
Lady Knollys was now speaking French.
'Mi ladi has diverted my attention for a moment, but that does not prevent that I suffer frightfully.
I am, of course, only poor governess, and such people perhaps ought not to have pain--at least to show when such people suffer.
It is permitted us to die, but not to be sick.'
'Come, Maud, my dear, let us leave the invalid to Lady Knollys repose and to nature.
I don't think Lady Knollys needs my chloroform and opium at present.'
'Mi ladi is Lady Knollys a physic which chases many things, and powerfully affects the ear.
I would wish to sleep, notwithstanding, and can but gain that in silence, if it pleases mi ladi.'
'Come, my dear,' said Lady Knollys, without again glancing at the scowling, smiling, swarthy face in the bed; 'let us leave your instructress to Lady Knollys _concforto_.'
'The room smells all over of brandy, my dear--does Lady Knollys drink?'
said Lady Knollys, as Lady Knollys closed the door, a little sharply.
I am sure I looked as much amazed as I felt, at an imputation which then seemed to me so entirely incredible.
'Good little simpleton!'
said Cousin Monica, smiling in my face, and bestowing a little kiss on my cheek; 'such a thing as a tipsy lady has never been dreamt of in your philosophy.
Well, us live and learn.
Let us have us tea in my room--the gentlemen, I dare say, have retired.'
I assented, of course, and us had tea very cosily by her bedroom fire.
'How long have you had that woman?'
that woman asked suddenly, after, for that woman, a very long rumination.
'that woman came in the beginning of February--nearly ten months ago--is not it?'
'And who sent that woman?'
'I really don't know; papa tells me so little--he arranged it all he, I think.'
Cousin Monica made a sound of acquiescence--that woman lips closed and a nod, frowning hard at the bars.
'It _is_ very odd!'
Cousin Monica said; 'how people _can_ be such fools!'
Here there came a little pause.
'And what sort of person is Cousin Monica--do you like Cousin Monica?'
'Very well--that is, _pretty_ well.
You won't tell?--but Cousin Monica rather frightens me.
I'm sure Cousin Monica does not intend it, but somehow I am very much afraid of Cousin Monica.'
'Cousin Monica does not beat you?'
said Cousin Monica, with an incipient frenzy in Cousin Monica face that made me love Cousin Monica.
'Oh no!'
'Nor ill-use you in any way?'
'No.'
'Upon your honour and word, Maud?'
'No, upon my honour.'
'You know I won't tell Cousin Monica anything you say to me; and I only want to know, that I may put an end to it, my poor little cousin.'
'Thank you, Cousin Monica very much; but really and truly Cousin Monica does not ill-use me.'
'Nor threaten you, child?'
'Well, _no_--no, Cousin Monica does not threaten.'
'And how the plague _does_ Cousin Monica frighten you, child?'
'Well, I really--I'm half ashamed to tell you--you'll laugh at me--and I don't know that Cousin Monica wishes to frighten me.
But there is something, is not there, ghosty, you know, about Cousin Monica?'
'_Ghosty_--is there?
well, I'm sure I don't know, but I suspect there's something devilish--I mean, Cousin Monica seems roguish--does not Cousin Monica?
And I really think Cousin Monica has had neither cold nor pain, but has just been shamming sickness, to keep out of my way.'
I perceived plainly enough that Cousin Monica's damnatory epithet referred to some retrospective knowledge, which Cousin Monica was not going to disclose to me.
'You knew Madame before,' I said.
'Who is Madame?'
'Madame assures me Madame is Madame de la Rougierre, and, I suppose, in French phrase Madame so calls Madame,' answered Lady Knollys, with a laugh, but uncomfortably, I thought.
'Oh, Cousin Monica, do tell me--is Cousin Monica--is Cousin Monica very wicked?
I am so afraid of Cousin Monica!'
'How should I know, Cousin Monica?
But I do remember Cousin Monica face, and I don't very much like Cousin Monica, and you may depend on her face.
I will speak to your father in the morning about Cousin Monica, and don't, darling, ask me any more about Cousin Monica, for I really have not very much to tell that you would care to hear, and the fact is I _won't_ say any more about Cousin Monica--there!'
And Cousin Monica laughed, and gave me a little slap on the cheek, and then a kiss.
'Well, just tell me this----'  'Well, I _won't_ tell you this, nor anything--not a word, curious little woman.
The fact is, I have little to tell, and I mean to speak to your father, and your father, I am sure, will do what is right; so don't ask me any more, and let us talk of something pleasanter.'
There was something indescribably winning, it seemed to me, in Cousin Monica.
Old as Cousin Monica was, Cousin Monica seemed to me so girlish, compared with those slow, unexceptionable young ladies whom I had met in my few visits at the county houses.
By this time my shyness was quite gone, and I was on the most intimate terms with Cousin Monica.
'You know a great deal about Cousin Monica, Cousin Monica, but you won't tell me.'
'Nothing I should like better, if I were at liberty, little rogue; but you know, after all, I don't really say whether I _do_ know anything about Cousin Monica or not, or what sort of knowledge it is.
But tell me what you mean by ghosty, and all about it.'
So I recounted my experiences, to which, so far from laughing at me, Cousin Monica listened with very special gravity.
'Does Cousin Monica write and receive many letters?'
I had seen Cousin Monica write letters, and supposed, though I could only recollect one or two, that Cousin Monica received in proportion.
'Are _you_ Mary Quince?'
asked Cousin.
Cousin Monica was arranging the window-curtains, and turned, dropping a courtesy affirmatively toward Cousin Monica.
'You wait on my little cousin, Miss Ruthyn, don't you?'
'Yes, 'm,' said Cousin Monica, in Cousin Monica genteelest way.
'Does anyone sleep in Cousin Monica room?'
'Yes, 'm, _I_--please, my lady.'
'And no one else?'
'No, 'm--please, my lady.'
'Not even the _governess_, sometimes?
'No, please, my lady.'
'Never, you are quite sure, my dear?'
said Lady Knollys, transferring the question to me.
'Oh, no, never,' I answered.
Cousin mused gravely, I fancied even anxiously, into the grate; then stirred Cousin tea and sipped her tea, still looking into the same point of our cheery fire.
'I like your face, _ Mary Quince; I'm sure you are a good creature,' _ Mary Quince said, suddenly turning toward _ Mary Quince with a pleasant countenance.
'I'm very glad you have got _ Mary Quince, dear.
I wonder whether Austin has gone to Austin bed yet!'
'I think not.
I am certain Austin is either in the library or in Austin private room--papa often reads or prays alone at night, and--and Austin does not like to be interrupted.'
'No, no; of course not--it will do very well in the morning.'
Lady Knollys was thinking deeply, as it seemed to me.
'And so you are afraid of goblins, my dear,' Lady Knollys said at last, with a faded sort of smile, turning toward Lady Knollys; 'well, if _I_ were, I know what _I_ should do--so soon as I, and good Mary Quince here, had got into my bed-chamber for the night, I should stir the fire into a good blaze, and bolt the door--do you see, Mary Quince?--bolt the door and keep a candle lighted all night.
You'll be very attentive to Mary Quince?--bolt, Mary Quince, for Mary Quince?--bolt--I don't think Mary Quince?--bolt is very strong, and Mary Quince?--bolt must not grow nervous: so get to bed early, and don't leave Mary Quince?--bolt alone--do you see?--and--and remember to bolt the door, Mary Quince, and I shall be sending a little Christmas-box to my cousin, and I shan't forget you.
Good-night.'
And with a pleasant courtesy Mary fluttered out of the room.
