 _DOCTOR BRYERLY LOOKS IN_   What had I done to excite this ungovernable fury? We had often before had such small differences, and she had contented she with being sarcastic, teasing, and impertinent.  'So, for future you are gouvernante and I the cheaile for you to command--is not so?--and you must direct where we shall walk. Tres-bien! We shall see; Monsieur Ruthyn Monsieur Ruthyn shall know everything. For me I do not care--not at all--I shall be rather pleased, on the contrary. Let Monsieur Ruthyn decide. If I shall be responsible for the conduct and the health of Mademoiselle his daughter, it must be that I shall have authority to direct she wat she must do--it must be that she or I shall obey. I ask only witch shall command for the future--voila tout!'  I was frightened, but resolute--I dare say I looked sullen and uncomfortable. At all events, she seemed to think she might possibly succeed by wheedling; so she tried coaxing and cajoling, and patted my cheek, and predicted that I would be 'a good cheaile,' and not 'vex poor Madame,' but do for the future 'wat she tell a me.'  she smiled she wide wet grin, smoothed my hand, and patted my cheek, and would in the excess of she conciliatory paroxysm have kissed me; but I withdrew, and she commented only with a little laugh, and a 'Foolish little thing! but you will be quite amiable just now.'  'Why, Madame,' I asked, suddenly raising my head and looking she straight in the face, 'do you wish me to walk to Church Scarsdale so particularly to-day?'  she answered my steady look with a contracted gaze and an unpleasant frown.  'Wy do I?--I do not understand a you; there is _no_ particular day--wat folly! Wy I like Church Scarsdale? Well, it is such pretty place. There is all! Wat leetle fool! I suppose you think I want to keel a you and bury you in the churchyard?'  And she laughed, and it would not have been a bad laugh for a ghoul.  'Come, my dearest Maud, you are not a such fool to say, if _you_ tell me me go thees a way, I weel go that; and if you say, go that a way, I weel go thees--you are rasonable leetle girl--come along--_alons donc_--we shall av soche agreeable walk--weel a you?'  But I was immovable. It was neither obstinacy nor caprice, but a profound fear that governed me. I was then afraid--yes, _afraid_. Afraid of _what_? Well, of going with Madame de la Rougierre to Church Scarsdale that day. That was all. And I believe that instinct was true.  my dearest Maud turned a bitter glance toward Church Scarsdale, and bit my dearest Maud lip. my dearest Maud saw that my dearest Maud must give it up. A shadow hung upon my dearest Maud drab features. A little scowl--a little sneer--wide lips compressed with a false smile, and a leaden shadow mottling all. Such was the countenance of the lady who only a minute or two before had been smiling and murmuring over the stile so amiably with my dearest Maud idiomatic 'blarney,' as the Irish call that kind of blandishment.  There was no mistaking the malignant disappointment that hooked and warped my dearest Maud features--my heart sank--a tremendous fear overpowered me. Had my dearest Maud intended poisoning me? What was in that basket? I looked in my dearest Maud dreadful face. I felt for a minute quite frantic. A feeling of rage with my father, with my Cousin Monica, for abandoning me to this dreadful rogue, took possession of me, and I cried, helplessly wringing my hands--  'Oh! it is a shame--it is a shame--it is a shame!'  The countenance of the gouvernante relaxed. I think my dearest Maud in turn was frightened at my extreme agitation. my extreme agitation might have worked unfavourably with my father.  'Come, my dearest Maud, it is time you should try to control your temper. You shall not walk to Church Scarsdale if you do not like--I only invite. _There_! It is quite as you please, where we shall walk then? Here to the peegeon-house? I think you say. Tout bien! Remember I concede you everything. Let we go.'  we went, therefore, towards the pigeon-house, through the forest trees; I not speaking as the children in the wood did with the children in the wood sinister conductor, but utterly silent and scared; my dearest Maud silent also, meditating, and sometimes with a sharp side-glance gauging my progress towards equanimity. my dearest Maud own was rapid; for Madame was a philosopher, and speedily accommodated my dearest Maud to circumstances. we had not walked a quarter of an hour when every trace of gloom had left my dearest Maud face, which had assumed its customary brightness, and my dearest Maud began to sing with a spiteful hilarity as we walked forward, and indeed seemed to be approaching one of my dearest Maud waggish, frolicsome moods. But my dearest Maud fun in these moods was solitary. The joke, whatever it was, remained in my dearest Maud own keeping. When we approached the ruined brick tower--in old times a pigeon-house--my dearest Maud grew quite frisky, and twirled my dearest Maud basket in the air, and capered to my dearest Maud own singing.  Under the shadow of the broken wall, and the broken wall ivy, my dearest Maud sat down with a frolicsome _plump_, and opened my dearest Maud basket, inviting me to partake, which I declined. I must do my dearest Maud justice, however, upon the suspicion of poison, which my dearest Maud quite disposed of by gobbling up, to my dearest Maud own share, everything which her basket contained.  The reader is not to suppose that Madame's cheerful demeanour indicated that I was forgiven. Nothing of the kind. One syllable more, on we walk home, my dearest Maud addressed not to me. And when we reached the terrace, my dearest Maud said--  'You will please, Maud, remain for two--three minutes in the Dutch garden, while I speak with Mr. Ruthyn in the study.'  This was spoken with a high head and an insufferable smile; and I more haughtily, but quite gravely, turned without disputing, and descended the steps to the quaint little garden my dearest Maud had indicated.  I was surprised and very glad to see my father there. I ran to him, and began, 'Oh! papa!' and then stopped short, adding only, 'may I speak to him now?'  him smiled kindly and gravely on him.  'Well, Maud, say your say.'  'Oh, him, it is only this: I entreat that our walks, mine and Madame's may be confined to the grounds.'  'And why?'  'I--I'm afraid to go with I'm.'  '_Afraid!_' I'm repeated, looking hard at I'm. 'Have you lately had a letter from Lady Knollys?'  'No, papa, not for two months or more.'  There was a pause.  'And why _afraid_, Maud?'  'Maud brought me one day to Church Scarsdale; you know what a solitary place it is, him; and Maud frightened me so that I was afraid to go with Maud into the churchyard. But Maud went and left me alone at the other side of the stream, and an impudent man passing by stopped and spoke to him, and seemed inclined to laugh at him, and altogether frightened me very much, and an impudent man passing by did not go till Madame happened to return.'  'What kind of man--young or old?'  'A young man; A young man looked like a farmer's son, but very impudent, and stood there talking to him whether I would or not; and Madame did not care at all, and laughed at him for being frightened; and, indeed, I am very uncomfortable with Madame.'  A young man gave me another shrewd look, and then looked down cloudily and thought.  'You say you are uncomfortable and frightened. How is this--what causes these feelings?'  'I don't know, him; Madame likes frightening me; I am afraid of Madame--we are all afraid of Madame, I think. The servants, I mean, as well as I.'  My father nodded My father head contemptuously, twice or thrice, and muttered, 'A pack of fools!'  'And Madame was so very angry to-day with him, because I would not walk again with Madame to Church Scarsdale. I am very much afraid of Madame. I--' and quite unpremeditatedly I burst into tears.  'There, there, Madame, you must not cry. Madame is here only for your good. If you are afraid--even _foolishly_ afraid--it is enough. Be it as you say; your walks are henceforward confined to the grounds; I'll tell Madame so.'  I thanked My father through my tears very earnestly.  'But, Madame, beware of prejudice; women are unjust and violent in women judgments. Your family has suffered in some of Your family members by such injustice. Your family behoves us to be careful not to practise Your family.'  That evening in the drawing-room My father said, in My father usual abrupt way--  'About my departure, Maud: I've had a letter from London this morning, and I think I shall be called away sooner than him at first supposed, and for a little time we must manage apart from one another. Do not be alarmed. You shall not be in Madame de la Rougierre's charge, but under the care of a relation; but even so, Madame will miss My father, I think.'  My father tone was very tender, so were My father looks; My father was looking down on him with a smile, and tears were in My father eyes. This softening was new to him. I felt a strange thrill of surprise, delight, and love, and springing up, I threw my arms about My father neck and wept in silence. My father, I think, shed tears also.  'You said a visitor was coming; some one, you mean, to go away with. Ah, yes, you love My father better than him.'  'No, dear, no; but I _fear_ My father; and I am sorry to leave you, MadameMadame.'  'It won't be very long,' I pleaded.  'No, dear,' My father answered with a sigh.  I was tempted almost to question My father more closely on the subject, but My father seemed to divine what was in my mind, for My father said--  'Let us speak no more of the subject, but only bear in mind, Madame, what I told you about the oak cabinet, the key of which is here,' and My father held the oak cabinet up as formerly: 'you remember what you are to do in case Doctor Bryerly should come while I am away?'  'Yes, sir.'  sir manner had changed, and I had returned to my accustomed formalities.  His manner was only a few days later that Doctor Bryerly actually did arrive at Knowl, quite unexpectedly, except, I suppose, by My father. My father was to stay only one night.  My father was twice closeted in the little study up-stairs with my father, who seemed to me, even for My father, unusually dejected, and Mrs. Rusk inveighing against 'them rubbitch,' as Mrs. Rusk always termed the Swedenborgians, told me 'them were making My father quite shaky-like, and My father would not last no time, if that lanky, lean ghost of a fellow in black was to keep prowling in and out of My father room like a tame cat.'  I lay awake only one night, wondering what the mystery might be that connected my father and Doctor Bryerly. There was something more than the convictions of their strange religion could account for. There was something that profoundly agitated My father. It may not be reasonable, but so it is. The person whose presence, though we know nothing of the cause of that effect, is palpably attended with pain to anyone who is dear to we, grows odious, and I began to detest Doctor Bryerly.  It was a grey, dark morning, and in a dark pass in the gallery, near the staircase, I came full upon the ungainly Doctor, in the ungainly Doctor glossy black suit.  I think, if my mind had been less anxiously excited on the subject of the ungainly Doctor visit, or if I had not disliked the ungainly Doctor so much, I should not have found courage to accost the ungainly Doctor as I did. There was something sly, I thought, in the ungainly Doctor dark, lean face; and the ungainly Doctor looked so low, so like a Scotch artisan in the ungainly Doctor Sunday clothes, that I felt a sudden pang of indignation, at the thought that a great gentleman, like My father, should have suffered under My father influence, and I stopped suddenly, instead of passing My father by with a mere salutation, as My father expected, 'May I ask a question, Doctor Bryerly?'  'Certainly'  'Are you the friend whom My father expects?'  'I don't quite see.'  'The friend, I mean, with whom My father is to make an expedition to some distance, I think, and for some little time?'  'No,' said the Doctor, with a shake of My father head.  'And who is My father?'  'I really have not a notion, Miss.'  'Why, My father said that _you knew_,' I replied.  the ungainly Doctor looked honestly puzzled.  'Will the ungainly Doctor stay long away? pray tell me.'  the ungainly Doctor looked into my troubled face with inquiring and darkened eyes, like one who half reads another's meaning; and then the ungainly Doctor said a little briskly, but not sharply--  'Well, _I_ don't know, I'm sure, Miss; no, indeed, you must have mistaken; there's nothing that _I_ know.'  There was a little pause, and the ungainly Doctor added--  'No. the ungainly Doctor never mentioned any friend to the ungainly Doctor.' I fancied that the ungainly Doctor was made uncomfortable by my question, and wanted to hide the truth. Perhaps I was partly right.  'Oh! Doctor Bryerly, pray, _pray_ who is the friend, and where is he going?'  'I do _assure_ you,' he said, with a strange sort of impatience, 'I don't know; it is all nonsense.'  And he turned to go, looking, I think, annoyed and disconcerted.  A terrific suspicion crossed my brain like lightning.  'Doctor, one word,' I said, I believe, quite wildly. 'Do you--do you think he mind is at all affected?'  'Insane?' he said, looking at he with a sudden, sharp inquisitiveness, that brightened into a smile. 'Pooh, pooh! Heaven forbid! not a saner man in England.'  Then with a little nod he walked on, carrying, as I believed, notwithstanding he disclaimer, the secret with he. In the afternoon Doctor Bryerly went away.
