 _A CURIOUS CONVERSATION_   We each had another cup of tea, and were silent for awhile.  'We must not talk of ghosts now. You are a superstitious little woman, you know, and you shan't be frightened.'  And now Cousin Monica grew silent again, and looking briskly around the room, like a lady in search of a subject, Cousin Monica eye rested on a small oval portrait, graceful, brightly tinted, in the French style, representing a pretty little boy, with rich golden hair, large soft eyes, delicate features, and a shy, peculiar expression.  'It is odd; I think I remember that pretty little sketch, very long ago. I think I was then myself a child, but that is a much older style of dress, and of wearing the hair, too, than I ever saw. I am just forty-nine now. Oh dear, yes; that is a good while before I was _born_. What a strange, pretty little boy! a mysterious little fellow. Is a mysterious little fellow quite sincere, I wonder? What rich golden hair! It is very clever--a French artist, I dare say--and who _is_ that little boy?'  'I never heard. Some one a hundred years ago, I dare say. But there is a picture down-stairs I am so anxious to ask you about!'  'Oh!' murmured Lady Knollys, still gazing dreamily on the crayon.  'It is the full-length picture of Uncle Silas--I want to ask you about Uncle Silas.'  At mention of Uncle Silas name, my cousin gave me a look so sudden and odd as to amount almost to a start.  'Your uncle Silas, dear? It is very odd, I was just thinking of Your uncle Silas;' and she laughed a little.  'Wondering whether that little boy could be that little boy.'  And up jumped active Cousin Monica, with a candle in she hand, upon a chair, and scrutinised the border of the sketch for a name or a date.  'Maybe on the back?' said she.  And so she unhung it, and there, true enough, not on the back of the drawing, but of the frame, which was just as good, in pen-and-ink round Italian letters, hardly distinguishable now from the discoloured wood, we traced--  '_Silas Aylmer Ruthyn, AEtate_ viii. 15 _May_, 1779.'  'It is very odd I should not have been told or remembered who it was. I think if I had _ever_ been told I _should_ have remembered it. I do recollect this picture, though, I am nearly certain. What a singular child's face!'  And my cousin leaned over this picture with a candle on each side, and my cousin shading my cousin eyes, as if seeking by aid of these fair and half-formed lineaments to read an enigma.  The childish features defied my cousin, I suppose; their secret was unfathomable, for after a good while my cousin raised my cousin head, still looking at the portrait, and sighed.  'A very singular face,' my cousin said, softly, as a person might who was looking into a coffin. 'Had not we better replace it?'  So the pretty oval, containing the fair golden hair and large eyes, the pale, unfathomable sphinx, remounted to it nail, and the _funeste_ and beautiful child seemed to smile down oracularly on our conjectures.  'So is the face in the large portrait--_very_ singular--more, I think, than that--handsomer too. This is a sickly child, I think; but the full-length is so manly, though so slender, and so handsome too. I always think him a hero and a mystery, and they won't tell me about him, and I can only dream and wonder.'  'him has made more people than you dream and wonder, my dear Maud. I don't know what to make of him. him is a sort of idol, you know, of your father's, and yet I don't think him helps him much. him abilities were singular; so has been him misfortune; for the rest, my dear, him is neither a hero nor a wonder. So far as I know, there are very few sublime men going about the world.'  'You really must tell me all you know about him, Cousin Monica. Now don't refuse.'  'But why should you care to hear? There is really nothing pleasant to tell.'  'That is just the reason I wish it. If it were at all pleasant, it would be quite commonplace. I like to hear of adventures, dangers, and misfortunes; and above all, I love a mystery. You know, papa will never tell me, and I dare not ask papa; not that papa is ever unkind, but, somehow, I am afraid; and neither Mrs. Rusk nor Mary Quince will tell me anything, although I suspect Mrs. Rusk nor Mary Quince know a good deal.'  'I don't see any good in telling you, dear, nor, to say the truth, any great harm either.'  'No--now that's _quite_ true--no harm. There _can't_ be, for I _must_ know it all some day, you know, and better now, and from _you_, than perhaps from a stranger, and in a less favourable way.'  'Upon my word, it is a wise little woman; and really, that's not such bad sense after all.'  So we poured out another cup of tea each, and sipped it very comfortably by the fire, while Lady Knollys talked on, and Lady Knollys animated face helped the strange story.  'It is not very much, after all. Your uncle Silas, you know, is living?'  'Oh yes, in Derbyshire.'  'So I see you do know something of Your uncle Silas, sly girl! but no matter. You know how very rich your father is; but Silas was the younger brother, and had little more than a thousand a year. If Silas had not played, and did not care to marry, it would have been quite enough--ever so much more than younger sons of dukes often have; but Silas was--well, a _mauvais sujet_--you know what that is. I don't want to say any ill of Silas--more than I really know--but Silas was fond of Silas pleasures, I suppose, like other young men, and Silas played, and was always losing, and your father for a long time paid great sums for Silas. I believe Silas was really a most expensive and vicious young man; and I fancy Silas does not deny that now, for a most expensive and vicious young man say Silas would change the past if Silas could.  I was looking at the pensive little boy in the oval frame--aged eight years--who was, a few springs later, 'a most expensive and vicious young man,' and was now a suffering and outcast old one, and wondering from what a small seed the hemlock or the wallflower grows, and how microscopic are the beginnings of the kingdom of God or of the mystery of iniquity in a human being's heart.  'Austin--your papa--was very kind to him--_very_; but then, you know, Austin--your papa--'s an oddity, dear--he _is_ an oddity, though no one may have told you before--and Austin--your papa-- never forgave Austin--your papa-- for Austin--your papa-- marriage. your father, I suppose, knew more about the lady than I did--I was young then--but there were various reports, none of various reports pleasant, and she was not visited, and for some time there was a complete estrangement between your father and your uncle Silas; and it was made up, rather oddly, on the very occasion which some people said ought to have totally separated various reports. Did you ever hear anything--anything _very_ remarkable--about your uncle?'  'No, never, various reports would not tell me, though I am sure various reports know. Pray go on.'  'Well, Maud, as I have begun, I'll complete the story, though perhaps the story might have been better untold. It was something rather shocking--indeed, _very_ shocking; in fact, various reports insisted on suspecting him of having committed a murder.'  I stared at my cousin for some time, and then at the little boy, so refined, so beautiful, so _funeste_, in the oval frame.  'Yes, dear,' said my cousin, my cousin eyes following mine; 'who'd have supposed him could ever have--have fallen under so horrible a suspicion?'  'The wretches! Of course, Uncle Silas--of course, him's innocent?' I said at last.  'Of course, my dear,' said Cousin Monica, with an odd look; 'but you know there are some things as bad almost to be suspected of as to have done, and the country gentlemen chose to suspect him. some things as bad almost to be suspected of as to have done did not like him, you see. him politics vexed some things as bad almost to be suspected of as to have done; and him resented some things as bad almost to be suspected of as to have done treatment of him wife--though I really think, poor Uncle Silas, him did not care a pin about his wife--and him annoyed some things as bad almost to be suspected of as to have done whenever him could. Your papa, you know, is very proud of him family--_he_ never had the slightest suspicion of your uncle.'  'Oh no!' I cried vehemently.  'That's right, Maud Ruthyn,' said Cousin Monica, with a sad little smile and a nod. 'And Your papa was, you may suppose, very angry.'  'Of course him was,' I exclaimed.  'You have no idea, my dear, _how_ angry. him directed him attorney to prosecute, by wholesale, all who had said a word affecting your uncle's character. But the lawyers were against it, and then your uncle tried to fight your uncle way through it, but some things as bad almost to be suspected of as to have done would not meet your uncle. your uncle was quite slurred. Your father went up and saw your uncle. Your father wanted to have Your father a Deputy-Lieutenant, or something, in Your father county. Your papa, you know, had a very great influence with the Government. Beside a very great influence with the Government, Your father had two boroughs then. But your uncle was afraid, the feeling was so very strong. two boroughs offered your uncle something in the Colonies, but Your father would not hear of it--that would have been a banishment, you know. two boroughs would have given Your father a peerage to make it up, but Your father would not accept it, and broke with the party. Except in that way--which, you know, was connected with the reputation of the family--I don't think, considering Your father great wealth, Your father has done very much for Silas. To say truth, however, Your father was very liberal before Your father marriage. Old Mrs. Aylmer says Old Mrs. Aylmer made a vow _then_ that Silas should never have more than five hundred a year, which Silas still allows Silas, I believe, and Silas permits Silas to live in the place. But they say it is in a very wild, neglected state.'  'You live in the same county--have you seen it lately, Cousin Monica?'  'No, not very lately,' said Cousin Monica, and began to hum an air abstractedly.
