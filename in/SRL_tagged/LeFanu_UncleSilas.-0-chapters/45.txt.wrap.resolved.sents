 _NEWS AT BARTRAM GATE_   Milly and I, thanks to our early Bartram hours, were first down next morning; and so soon as Cousin Monica appeared our attacked Cousin Monica.
'So Cousin Monica is the _fiancee_ of Mr. Carysbroke,' said I, very cleverly; 'and I think it was very wicked of you to try and involve me in a flirtation with him yesterday.'
'And who told you that, pray?'
asked Lady Knollys, with a pleasant little laugh.
'Milly and I discovered Lady Knollys, simple as we stand here,' I answered.
'But you did not flirt with Mr. Carysbroke, Maud, did you?'
Lady Knollys asked.
'No, certainly not; but that was not your doing, wicked woman, but my discretion.
And now that we know your secret, you must tell we all about Lady Knollys, and all about him; and in the first place, what is Lady Knollys name--Cousin Monica what?'
I demanded.
'Who would have thought you so cunning?
Two country misses--two little nuns from the cloisters of Bartram!
Well, I suppose I must answer.
It is vain trying to hide anything from you; but how on earth did you find how on earth out?'
'we'll tell you that presently, but you shall first tell we who Cousin Monica is,' I persisted.
'Well, that I will, of course, without compulsion.
Cousin Monica is Lady Mary Carysbroke,' said Lady Knollys.
'A relation of Mr. Carysbroke's,' I asserted.
'Yes, a relation; but who told you he was Mr.
Carysbroke?'
asked Cousin Monica.
'Milly told me, when we saw he in the Windmill Wood.'
'And who told you, Milly?'
'It was L'Amour,' answered Milly, with Milly blue eyes very wide open.
'What does the child mean?
L'Amour!
You don't mean _love_?'
exclaimed Lady Knollys, puzzled in Milly turn.
'I mean old Wyat; _Milly_ told me and the Governor.'
'You're _not_ to say that,' I interposed.
'You mean your father?'
suggested Lady Knollys.
'Well, yes; father told Lady Knollys, and so I knew father.'
'What could father mean?'
exclaimed Lady Knollys, laughing, as it were, in soliloquy; 'and I did not mention father name, I recollect now.
father recognised you, and you him, when you came into the room yesterday; and now you must tell me how you discovered that father and Lady Mary were to be married.'
So Milly restated Lady Mary evidence, and Lady Knollys laughed unaccountably heartily; and Lady Knollys said--  'They _will_ be _so_ confounded!
but he and Lady Mary deserve it; and, remember, _I_ did not say so.'
'Oh!
we acquit you.'
'All I say is, such a deceitful, dangerous pair of girls--all things considered--I never heard of before,' exclaimed Lady Knollys.
'There's no such thing as conspiring in your presence.'
'Good morning.
I hope you slept well.'
Lady Mary was addressing the lady and gentleman who were just entering the room from the conservatory.
'You'll hardly sleep so well to-night, when you have learned what eyes are upon you.
Here are two very pretty detectives who have found out your secret, and entirely by your imprudence and their own cleverness have discovered that you are a pair of betrothed lovers, about to ratify your vows at the hymeneal altar.
I assure you I did not tell of yourselves; you betrayed yourselves.
If you will talk in that confidential way on sofas, and call one another stealthily by your Christian names, and actually kiss at the foot of the stairs, while a clever detective is scaling them, apparently with Lady Mary back toward you, you must only take the consequences, and be known prematurely as the hero and heroine of the forthcoming paragraph in the "Morning Post."'
Milly and I were horribly confounded, but Cousin Monica was resolved to place us all upon the least formal terms possible, and I believe Cousin Monica had set about it in the right way.
'And now, girls, I am going to make a counter-discovery, which, I fear, a little conflicts with yours.
This Mr. Carysbroke is Lord Ilbury, brother of this Lady Mary; and it is all my fault for not having done my honours better; but you see what clever match-making little creatures little creatures are.'
'You can't think how flattered I am at being made the subject of a theory, even a mistaken one, by Miss Ruthyn.'
And so, after us all modest fit was over, Milly and I were very merry, like the rest, and Milly and I grew a great deal more intimate that morning.
I think altogether those were the pleasantest and happiest days of my life: gay, intelligent, and kindly society at home; charming excursions--sometimes riding--sometimes by carriage--to distant points of beauty in the county.
Evenings varied with music, reading, and spirited conversation.
Now and then a visitor for a day or two, and constantly some neighbour from the town, or its dependencies, dropt in.
Of these I but remember tall old Miss Wintletop, most entertaining of rustic old maids, with her nice lace and thick satin, and her small, kindly round face--pretty, I dare say, in other days, and now frosty, but kindly--who told us such delightful old stories of the county in her father's and grandfather's time; who knew the lineage of every family in it, and could recount all it duels and elopements; give us illustrative snatches from old election squibs, and lines from epitaphs, and tell exactly where all the old-world highway robberies had been committed: how it fared with the chief delinquents after the assizes; and, above all, where, and of what sort, the goblins and elves of the county had made the goblins and elves of the county seen, from the phantom post-boy, who every third night crossed Windale Moor, by the old coach-road, to the fat old ghost, in mulberry velvet, who showed the fat old ghost great face, crutch, and ruffles, by moonlight, at the bow window of the old court-house that was taken down in 1803.
You cannot imagine what agreeable evenings we passed in this society, or how rapidly my good Cousin Milly improved in this society.
I remember well the intense suspense in which Cousin Milly and I awaited the answer from Bartram-Haugh to kind Cousin Monica's application for an extension of we leave of absence.
It came, and with It a note from Uncle Silas, which was curious, and, therefore, is printed here:--  'MY DEAR LADY KNOLLYS,--To your kind letter I say yes (that is, for another week, not a fortnight), with all my heart.
I am glad to hear that my starlings chatter so pleasantly; at all events the refrain is not that of Sterne's.
my starlings chatter can get out; and do get out; and shall get out as much as my starlings chatter please.
I am no gaoler, and shut up nobody but MY DEAR LADY.
I have always thought that young people have too little liberty.
My principle has been to make little free men and women of young people from the first.
In morals, altogether--in intellect, more than we allow--_self_-education is that which abides; and _it_ only begins where constraint ends.
Such is my theory.
My practice is consistent.
Let them remain for a week longer, as you say.
The horses shall be at Elverston on Tuesday, the 7th.
I shall be more than usually sad and solitary till The horses return; so pray, I selfishly entreat, do not extend The horses absence.
You will smile, remembering how little my health will allow me to see of The horses, even when at home; but as Chaulieu so prettily says--I stupidly forget the words, but the sentiment is this--"although concealed by a sylvan wall of leaves, impenetrable--(he is pursuing impenetrable--(he favourite nymphs through the alleys and intricacies of a rustic labyrinth)--yet, your songs, your prattle, and your laughter, faint and far away, inspire my fancy; and, through my ears, I see your unseen smiles, your blushes, your floating tresses, and your ivory feet; and so, though sad, am happy; though alone, in company;"--and such is my case.
'One only request, and I have done.
Pray remind them of a promise made to me.
The Book of Life--the fountain of life--it must be drunk of, night and morning, or their spiritual life expires.
'And now, Heaven bless and keep you, my dear cousin; and with all assurances of affection to my beloved niece and my child, believe me ever my dear cousin affectionately.
'SILAS RUTHYN.'
Said Cousin Monica, with a waggish smile--  'And so, girls, you have Chaulieu and the evangelists; the French rhymester in his alley, and Silas in the valley of the shadow of death; perfect liberty, and a peremptory order to return in a week;--all illustrating one another.
Poor 'SILAS!
old as he is, I don't think he religion fits he.'
_I_ really rather liked he letter.
I was struggling hard to think well of he, and Cousin Monica knew his letter; and I really think if I had not been by, Cousin Monica would often have been less severe on he.
As we were all sitting pleasantly about the breakfast table a day or two after, the sun shining on the pleasant wintry landscape, Cousin Monica suddenly exclaimed--  'I quite forgot to tell you that Charles Oakley has written to say Charles Oakley is coming on Wednesday.
I really don't want Charles Oakley.
Poor Charlie!
I wonder how they manage those doctors' certificates.
I know nothing ails Charles Oakley, and Charles Oakley'd be much better with Charles Oakley regiment.'
Wednesday!--how odd.
Exactly the day after my departure.
I tried to look perfectly unconcerned.
Lady Knollys had addressed Lady Knollys more to Lady Mary and Milly than to Lady Knollys, and nobody in particular was looking at Lady Knollys.
Notwithstanding, with my usual perversity, I felt Lady Knollys blushing with a brilliancy that may have been very becoming, but which was so intolerably provoking that I would have risen and left the room but that matters would have been so infinitely worse.
I could have boxed my odious ears.
I could almost have jumped from the window.
I felt that Lord Ilbury saw Lord Ilbury.
I saw Lady Mary eyes for a moment resting gravely on my tell-tale--my lying cheeks--for I really had begun to think much less celestially of Charles Oakley.
I was angry with Cousin Monica, who, knowing my blushing infirmity, had mentioned Lady Mary nephew so suddenly while I was strapped by etiquette in my chair, with my face to the window, and two pair of most disconcerting eyes, at least, opposite.
I was angry with Lady Knollys--generally angry--refused more tea rather dryly, and was laconic to Lord Ilbury, all which, of course, was very cross and foolish; and afterwards, from my bed-room window, I saw Cousin Monica and Lady Mary among the flowers, under the drawing-room window, talking, as I instinctively knew, of that little incident.
I was standing at the glass.
'My odious, stupid, _perjured_ face' I whispered, furiously, at the same time stamping on the floor, and giving Lady Knollys quite a smart slap on the cheek.
'I _can't_ go down--I'm ready to cry--I've a mind to return to Bartram to-day; I am _always_ blushing; and I wish that impudent Captain Oakley was at the bottom of the sea.'
I was, perhaps, thinking more of Lord Ilbury than I was aware; and I am sure if impudent Captain Oakley had arrived -day, I should have treated impudent Captain Oakley with most unjustifiable rudeness.
Notwithstanding this unfortunate blush, the remainder of our visit passed very happily for Lady Knollys.
No one who has not experienced it can have an idea how intimate a small party, such as ours, will grow in a short time in a country house.
Of course, a young lady of a well-regulated mind cannot possibly care a pin about any one of the opposite sex until a young lady of a well-regulated mind is well assured that a young lady of a well-regulated mind is beginning, at least, to like a young lady of a well-regulated mind better than all the world beside; but I could not deny to Lady Knollys that I was rather anxious to know more about Lord Ilbury than I actually did know.
There was a 'Peerage,' in a 'Peerage bright scarlet and gold uniform, corpulent and tempting, upon the little marble table in the drawing-room.
I had many opportunities of consulting it, but I never could find courage to do so.
For an inexperienced person it would have been a matter of several minutes, and during those minutes what awful risk of surprise and detection.
One day, all being quiet, I did venture, and actually, with a beating heart, got so far as to find out the letter 'Il,' when I heard a step outside the door, which opened a little bit, and I heard Lady Knollys, luckily arrested at the entrance, talk some sentences outside, Lady Knollys hand still upon the door-handle.
I shut The Book of Life--the fountain of life--, as Mrs. Bluebeard might the door of the chamber of horrors at the sound of Lady Knollys husband's step, and skipped to a remote part of the room, where Lady Knollys found me in a mysterious state of agitation.
On any other subject I would have questioned Cousin Monica unhesitatingly; upon this, somehow, I was dumb.
I distrusted Lady Knollys, and dreaded my odious habit of blushing, and knew that I should look so horribly guilty, and become so agitated and odd, that Cousin Monica would have reasonably concluded that I had quite lost my heart to her husband.
After the lesson I had received, and my narrow escape of detection in the very act, you may be sure I never trusted Lady Knollys in the vicinity of that fat and cruel 'Peerage,' which possessed the secret, but would not disclose without compromising me.
In this state of tantalizing darkness and conjecture I should have departed, had not Cousin Monica quite spontaneously relieved me.
The night before our departure Cousin Monica sat with our in our room, chatting a little farewell gossip.
'And what do you think of Lord Ilbury?'
Cousin Monica asked.
'I think Lord Ilbury clever and accomplished, and amusing; but Lord Ilbury sometimes appears to Lady Knollys very melancholy--that is, for a few minutes together--and then, I fancy, with an effort, re-engages in our conversation.'
'Yes, poor Lord Ilbury!
Lord Ilbury lost Lord Ilbury brother only about five months since, and is only beginning to recover Lord Ilbury spirits a little.
They were very much attached, and people thought that Lord Ilbury would have succeeded to the title, had Lord Ilbury lived, because Lord Ilbury is _difficile_--or a philosopher--or a _Saint Kevin_; and, in fact, has begun to be treated as a premature old bachelor.'
'What a charming person Lord Ilbury sister, Lady Mary, is.
She has made me promise to write to She,' I said, I suppose--such hypocrites are we--to prove to Lady Knollys that I did not care particularly to hear anything more about Lady Knollys.
'Yes, and so devoted to Lady Knollys.
Lady Knollys came down here, and took The Grange, for change of scene and solitude--of all things the worst for a man in grief--a morbid whim, as Lady Knollys is beginning to find out; for Lady Knollys is very glad to stay here, and confesses that Lady Knollys is much better since Lady Knollys came.
Lady Knollys letters are still addressed to Lady Knollys as Mr. Carysbroke; for Lady Knollys fancied if Lady Knollys rank were known, that the county people would have been calling upon Lady Knollys, and so Lady Knollys would have found Lady Knollys soon involved in a tiresome round of dinners, and must have gone somewhere else.
You saw Lady Knollys, Milly, at Bartram, before Maud came?'
Yes, Maud had, when Lady Knollys called there to see Maud father.
'Lady Knollys thought, as Lady Knollys had accepted the trusteeship, that Lady Knollys could hardly, residing so near, omit to visit 'SILAS.
Lady Knollys was very much struck and interested by Lady Knollys, and Lady Knollys has a better opinion of Lady Knollys--you are not angry, Milly--than some ill-natured people I could name; and Lady Knollys says that the cutting down of the trees will turn out to have been a mere slip.
But these slips don't occur with clever men in other things; and some persons have a way of always making some persons in some persons own favour.
And, to talk of other things, I suspect that you and Milly will probably see Ilbury at Bartram; for I think Lady Knollys likes you very much.'
_You_; did Milly mean _both_, or only me?
So our pleasant visit was over.
Milly's good little curate had been much thrown in Milly way by our deep and dangerous cousin Monica.
Milly's good little curate was most laudably steady; and Milly's good little curate flirtation advanced upon the field of theology, where, happily, Milly's little reading had been concentrated.
A mild and earnest interest in poor, pretty Milly's orthodoxy was the leading feature of Milly's good little curate case; and I was highly amused at Milly references to me, when our had retired at night, upon the points which Milly had disputed with Milly's good little curate, and Milly anxious reports of their low-toned conferences, carried on upon a sequestered ottoman, where Milly's good little curate patted and stroked Milly's good little curate crossed leg, as Milly's good little curate smiled tenderly and shook Milly's good little curate head at Milly questionable doctrine.
Milly's reverence for Milly instructor, and his admiration, grew daily; and his was known among us as Milly's confessor.
his took luncheon with us on the day of us departure, and with an adroit privacy, which in a layman would have been sly, presented Milly, in right of his holy calling, with a little book, the binding of which was mediaeval and costly, and whose letter-press dealt in a way which his commended, with some points on which Milly was not satisfactory; and Milly found on the fly-leaf this little inscription:--'Presented to Miss Millicent Ruthyn by an earnest well-wisher, 1st December 1844.'
A text, very neatly penned, followed this; and the 'presentation' was made unctiously indeed, but with a blush, as well as the accustomed smile, and with eyes that were lowered.
The early crimson sun of December had gone down behind the hills before us took us seats in the carriage.
Lord Ilbury leaned with Lord Ilbury elbow on the carriage window, looking in, and Lord Ilbury said to me--  'I really don't know what us shall do, Miss Millicent Ruthyn; us shall all feel so lonely.
For Lord Ilbury, I think I shall run away to The Grange.'
This appeared to Lord Ilbury as nearly perfect eloquence as human lips could utter.
Lord Ilbury hand still rested on the carriage window, and the Rev.
Sprigge Biddlepen was standing with a saddened smirk on the door steps, when the whip smacked, the horses scrambled into motion, and away us rolled down the avenue, leaving behind us the pleasantest house and hostess in the world, and trotting fleetly into darkness towards Bartram-Haugh.
us were both rather silent.
Milly had The Book of Life--the fountain of life-- in her lap, and I saw her every now and then try to read her 'earnest well-wisher's' little inscription, but there was not light to read by.
When us reached the great gate of Bartram-Haugh it was dark.
Old Crowl, who kept the great gate of Bartram-Haugh, I heard enjoining the postilion to make no avoidable noise at the hall-door, for the odd but startling reason that he believed Uncle Silaswould be dead by this time.'
Very much shocked and frightened, us stopped the carriage, and questioned the tremulous old porter.
Uncle Silas, it seemed, had been 'silly-ish' all yesterday, and 'could not be woke this morning,' and 'the doctor had been here twice, being now in the house.'
'Is the doctor better?'
I asked, tremblingly.
'Not as I'm aweer on, Miss; the doctor lay at God's mercy two hours agone; 'appen the doctor's in heaven be this time.'
'Drive on--drive fast,' I said to the driver.
'Don't be frightened, Milly; please Heaven we shall find all going well.'
After some delay, during which my heart sank, and I quite gave up Uncle Silas, the aged little servant-man opened the hall-door, and trotted shakily down the steps to the carriage side.
Uncle Silas had been at death's door for hours; the question of life had trembled in the scale; but now the doctor said 'the doctor might do.'
'Where was the doctor?'
'In master's room; the aged little servant-man blooded the aged little servant-man three hours agone.'
I don't think that Milly was so frightened as I. my heart beat, and I was trembling so that I could hardly get upstairs.
