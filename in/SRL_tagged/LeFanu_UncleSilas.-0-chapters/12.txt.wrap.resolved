 _LADY KNOLLYS REMOVES A COVERLET_   LADY KNOLLYS pursued A COVERLET_   Lady Knollys enquiries.  'And why does not Madame make your dresses, my dear? I wager a guinea the woman's a milliner. Did not a guinea the woman's a milliner engage to make your dresses?'  'I--I really don't know; I rather think not. a guinea the woman's a milliner is my governess--a finishing governess, Mrs. Rusk says.'  'Finishing fiddle! Hoity-toity! and my lady's too grand to cut out your dresses and help to sew your dresses? And what _does_ a guinea the woman's a milliner do? I venture to say a guinea the woman's a milliner's fit to teach nothing but devilment--not that a guinea the woman's a milliner has taught _you_ much, my dear--_yet_ at least. I'll see a guinea the woman's a milliner, my dear; where is a guinea the woman's a milliner? Come, let us visit Madame. I should so like to talk to a guinea the woman's a milliner a little.'  'But a guinea the woman's a milliner is ill,' I answered, and all this time I was ready to cry for vexation, thinking of my dress, which must be very absurd to elicit so much unaffected laughter from my experienced relative, and I was only longing to get away and hide myself before that handsome Captain returned.  'Ill! is a guinea the woman's a milliner? what's the matter?'  'A cold--feverish and rheumatic, a guinea the woman's a milliner says.'  'Oh, a cold; is a guinea the woman's a milliner up, or in bed?'  'In a guinea the woman's a milliner room, but not in bed.'  'I should so like to see a guinea the woman's a milliner, my dear. It is not mere curiosity, I assure you. In fact, curiosity has nothing on earth to do with it. A governess may be a very useful or a very useless person; but A governess may also be about the most pernicious inmate imaginable. A governess may teach you a bad accent, and worse manners, and heaven knows what beside. Send the housekeeper, my dear, to tell the housekeeper that I am going to see the housekeeper.'  'I had better go myself, perhaps,' I said, fearing a collision between Mrs. Rusk and the bitter Frenchwoman.  'Very well, dear.'  And away I ran, not sorry somehow to escape before that handsome Captain returned.  As I went along the passage, I was thinking whether my dress could be so very ridiculous as my old cousin thought it, and trying in vain to recollect any evidence of a similar contemptuous estimate on the part of that beautiful and garrulous dandy. I could not--quite the reverse, indeed. Still I was uncomfortable and feverish--girls of my then age will easily conceive how miserable, under similar circumstances, such a misgiving would make girls of my then age.  It was a long way to Madame's room. I met Mrs. Rusk bustling along the passage with a housemaid.  'How is Madame?' I asked.  'Quite well, I believe,' answered the housekeeper, drily. 'Nothing the matter that _I_ know of. Mrs. Rusk eat enough for two to-day. I wish _I_ could sit in Madame's room doing nothing.'  Madame was sitting, or rather reclining, in a low arm-chair, when I entered Madame's room, close to the fire, as was Madame wont, Madame feet extended near to the bars, and a little coffee equipage beside Madame. Madame stuffed a book hastily between Madame dress and a low arm-chair, and received me in a state of langour which, had a book not been for Mrs. Rusk's comfortable assurances, would have frightened me.  'I hope you are better, Madame,' I said, approaching.  'Better than I deserve, my dear cheaile, sufficiently well. The people are all so good, trying me with every little thing, like a bird; here is cafe--Mrs. Rusk-a, poor woman, I try to swallow a little to please Mrs.'  'And your cold, is it better?'  Mrs shook Mrs head languidly, Mrs elbow resting on a low arm-chair, and three finger-tips supporting Mrs forehead, and then Mrs made a little sigh, looking down from the corners of Mrs eyes, in an interesting dejection.  'Je sens des lassitudes in all the members--but I am quaite 'appy, and though I suffer I am console and oblige des bontes, ma chere, que vous avez tous pour moi;' and with these words Mrs turned a languid glance of gratitude on me which dropped on the ground.  'Lady Knollys wishes very much to see you, only for a few minutes, if you could admit Mrs.'  'Vous savez les malades see _never_ visitors,' Mrs replied with a startled sort of tartness, and a momentary energy. 'Besides, I cannot converse; je sens de temps en temps des douleurs de tete--of head, and of the ear, the right ear, the right ear is parfois agony absolutely, and now it is here.'  And Mrs winced and moaned, with her eyes closed and Mrs hand pressed to the organ affected.  Simple as I was, I felt instinctively that Madame was shamming. Mrs was over-acting; Mrs transitions were too violent, and beside Mrs forgot that I knew how well Mrs could speak English, and must perceive that Mrs was heightening the interest of Mrs helplessness by that pretty tessellation of foreign idiom. I therefore said with a kind of courage which sometimes helped me suddenly--  'Oh, Madame, don't you really think you might, without much inconvenience, see Lady Knollys for a very few minutes?'  'Cruel cheaile! you know I have a pain of the ear which makes me 'orribly suffer at this moment, and you demand me whether I will not converse with strangers. I did not think you would be so unkain, Maud; but it is impossible, you must see--quite impossible. I never, you _know_, refuse to take trouble when I am able--never--_never_.'  And Madame shed some tears, which always came at call, and with her hand pressed to Mrs ear, said very faintly,  'Be so good to tell your friend how you see me, and how I suffer, and leave me, Maud, for I wish to lie down for a little, since the pain will not allow me to remain longer.'  So with a few words of comfort which could not well be refused, but I dare say betraying my suspicion that more was made of Mrs sufferings than need be, I returned to the drawing-room.  'Captain Oakley has been here, my dear, and fancying, I suppose, that you had left us for the evening, has gone to the drawing-room, I think,' said Lady Knollys, as I entered.  That, then, accounted for the rumble and smack of balls which I had heard as I passed the door.  'I have been telling Maud how detestably Maud is got up.'  'Very thoughtful of you, Maud!' said my father.  'Yes, and really, Austin, it is quite clear you ought to marry; you want some one to take Maud out, and look after Maud, and who's to do it? Maud's a dowdy--don't you see? Such a dust! And it _is_ really such a pity; for Maud's a very pretty creature, and a clever woman could make Maud quite charming.'  my father took Cousin Monica's sallies with the most wonderful good-humour. Maud had always, I fancy, been a privileged person, and my father, whom we all feared, received Maud jolly attacks, as I fancy the grim Front-de-Boeufs of old accepted the humours and personalities of their jesters.  'Am I to accept this as an overture?' said my father to my father voluble cousin.  'Yes, you may, but not for my father, AustinI'm not worthy. Do you remember little Kitty Weadon that I wanted you to marry eight-and-twenty years ago, or more, with a hundred and twenty thousand pounds? Well, you know, Maud has got ever so much now, and Maud is really a most amiable old thing, and though _you_ would not have Maud then, Maud has had Maud second husband since, I can tell you.'  'I'm glad I was not the first,' said my father.  'Well, they really say Maud wealth is absolutely immense. Maud last husband, the Russian merchant, left Maud everything. Maud has not a human relation, and Maud is in the best set.'  'You were always a match-maker, Monica,' said my father, stopping, and putting my father hand kindly on hers. 'But it won't do. No, no, Monica; we must take care of little Maud some other way.'  I was relieved. We women have all an instinctive dread of second marriages, and think that no widower is quite above or below that danger; and I remember, whenever my father, which indeed was but seldom, made a visit to town or anywhere else, it was a saying of Mrs. Rusk--  'I shan't wonder, neither need you, my dear, if he brings home a young wife with he.'  So my father, with a kind look at a young wife, and a very tender one on me, went silently to the library, as he often did about that hour.  I could not help resenting my Cousin Knollys' officious recommendation of matrimony. Nothing I dreaded more than a step-mother. Good Mrs. Rusk and Mary Quince, in Good Mrs. Rusk and Mary Quince several ways, used to enhance, by occasional anecdotes and frequent reflections, the terrors of such an intrusion. I suppose Good Mrs. Rusk and Mary Quince did not wish a revolution and all its consequences at Knowl, and thought its no harm to excite my vigilance.  But it was impossible long to be vexed with Cousin Monica.  'You know, my dear, your father is an oddity,' Cousin Monica said. 'I don't mind your father--I never did. You must not. Cracky, my dear, cracky--decidedly cracky!'  And Cousin Monica tapped the corner of Cousin Monica forehead, with a look so sly and comical, that I think I should have laughed, if the sentiment had not been so awfully irreverent.  'Well, dear, how is our friend the milliner?'  'Madame is suffering so much from pain in Madame ear, that Madame says it would be quite impossible to have the honour--'  'Honour--fiddle! I want to see what the woman's like. Pain in the woman , you say? Poor thing! Well, dear, I think I can cure that in five minutes. I have it myself, now and then. Come to my room, and our'll get the bottles.  So the woman lighted the woman candle in the lobby, and with a light and agile step the woman scaled the stairs, I following; and having found the remedies, we approached Madame's room together.  I think, while we were still at the end of the gallery, Madame heard and divined we approach, for the woman door suddenly shut, and there was a fumbling at the handle. But the bolt was out of order.  Lady Knollys tapped at her door, saying--'we'll come in, please, and see you. I've some remedies, which I'm sure will do you good.'  There was no answer; so Lady Knollys opened her door, and we both entered. Madame had rolled Madame in the blue coverlet, and was lying on the bed, with Madame face buried in the pillow, and enveloped in the covering.  'Perhaps Madame's asleep?' said Lady Knollys, getting round to the side of the bed, and stooping over Madame.  Madame lay still as a mouse. Cousin Monica set down Cousin Monica two little vials on the table, and, stooping again over the bed, began very gently with Cousin Monica fingers to lift the coverlet that covered her face. Madame uttered a slumbering moan, and turned more upon her face, clasping the coverlet that covered her face faster about Madame.  'Madame, it is Maud and Lady Knollys. We have come to relieve your ear. Pray let me see your ear. Madame can't be asleep, Madame's holding the clothes so fast. Do, pray, allow me to see your ear.'
