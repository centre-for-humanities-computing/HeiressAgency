 _MONICA KNOLLYS_   Punctually Lady Knollys arrived. Lady Knollys was accompanied by Lady Knollys nephew, Captain Oakley.  They arrived a little before dinner; just in time to get to They rooms and dress. But Mary Quince enlivened my toilet with eloquent descriptions of the youthful Captain whom Mary Quince had met in the gallery, on the youthful Captain way to the youthful Captain room, with the servant, and told me how the youthful Captain stopped to let Mary Quince pass, and how 'the youthful Captain smiled so 'ansom.'  I was very young then, you know, and more childish even than my years; but this talk of Mary Quince interested me, I must confess, considerably. I was painting all sort of portraits of this heroic soldier, while affecting, I am afraid, a hypocritical indifference to Mary Quince narration, and I know I was very nervous and painstaking about my toilet that evening. When I went down to the drawing-room, Lady Knollys was there, talking volubly to my father as I entered--a woman not really old, but such as very young people fancy aged--energetic, bright, saucy, dressed handsomely in purple satin, with a good deal of lace, and a rich point--I know not how to call it--not a cap, a sort of head-dress--light and simple, but grand withal, over her greyish, silken hair.  Rather tall, by no means stout, on the whole a good firm figure, with something kindly in her look. her got up, quite like a young person, and coming quickly to meet me with a smile--  'My young cousin!' her cried, and kissed me on both cheeks. 'You know who I am? Your cousin Monica--Monica Knollys--and very glad, dear, to see you, though her has not set eyes on you since you were no longer than that paper-knife. Now come here to the lamp, for I must look at you. Who is her like? Let me see. Like your poor mother, I think, my dear; but you've the Aylmer nose--yes--not a bad nose either, and, come! very good eyes, upon my life--yes, certainly something of her poor mother--not a bit like you, Austin.'  Papa gave her a look as near a smile as I had seen there for a long time, shrewd, cynical, but kindly too, and said he--  'So much the better, Monica, eh?'  'It was not for me to say--but you know, Austin, you always were an ugly creature. How shocked and indignant her looks! You must not be vexed, you loyal little woman, with Monica for telling the truth. Papa was and will be ugly all Papa days. Come, Austin, dear, tell Austin--is not it so?'  'What! depose against Papa! That's not English law, Monica.'  'Well, maybe not; but if the child won't believe the child own eyes, how is the child to believe me? the child has long, pretty hands--you have--and very nice feet too. How old is the child?'  'How old, child?' said Papa to Papa, transferring the question.  the child recurred again to my eyes.  'That is the true grey--large, deep, soft--very peculiar. Yes, dear, very pretty--long lashes, and such bright tints! You'll be in the Book of Beauty, my dear, when you come out, and have all the poet people writing verses to the tip of your nose--and a very pretty little nose it is!'  I must mention here how striking was the change in Papa's spirit while talking and listening to Papa odd and voluble old Monica. Reflected from bygone associations, there had come a glimmer of something, not gaiety, indeed, but like an appreciation of gaiety. The gloom and inflexibility were gone, and there was an evident encouragement and enjoyment of the incessant sallies of his bustling visitor.  How morbid must have been the tendencies of his habitual solitude, I think, appeared from the evident thawing and brightening that accompanied even this transient gleam of human society. I was not a companion--more childish than most girls of my age, and trained in all his whimsical ways, never to interrupt a silence, or force his thoughts by unexpected question or remark out of their monotonous or painful channel.  I was as much surprised at the good-humour with which he submitted to he cousin's saucy talk; and, indeed, just then those black-panelled and pictured walls, and that quaint, misshapen room, seemed to have exchanged just then those black-panelled and pictured walls stern and awful character for something wonderfully pleasanter to me, notwithstanding the unpleasantness of the personal criticism to which the plain-spoken lady chose to subject me.  Just at that moment Captain Oakley joined us. Captain Oakley was my first actual vision of that awful and distant world of fashion, of whose splendours I had already read something in the three-volumed gospel of the circulating library.  Handsome, elegant, with features almost feminine, and soft, wavy, black hair, whiskers and moustache, Captain Oakley was altogether such a knight as I had never beheld, or even fancied, at Knowl--a hero of another species, and from the region of the demigods. I did not then perceive that coldness of the eye, and cruel curl of the voluptuous lip--only a suspicion, yet enough to indicate the profligate man, and savouring of death unto death.  But I was young, and had not yet the direful knowledge of good and evil that comes with years; and he was so very handsome, and talked in a way that was so new to me, and was so much more charming than the well-bred converse of the humdrum county families with whom I had occasionally sojourned for a week at a time.  It came out incidentally that he leave of absence was to expire the day after to-morrow. A Lilliputian pang of disappointment followed this announcement. Already I was sorry to lose A Lilliputian pang of disappointment. So soon we begin to make a property of what pleases we.  I was shy, but not awkward. I was flattered by the attention of this amusing, perhaps rather fascinating, young man of the world; and A Lilliputian pang of disappointment plainly addressed A Lilliputian pang of disappointment with diligence to amuse and please me. I dare say there was more effort than I fancied in bringing A Lilliputian pang of disappointment talk down to my humble level, and interesting me and making me laugh about people whom I had never heard of before, than I then suspected.  Cousin Knollys meanwhile was talking to papa. It was just the conversation that suited a man so silent as habit had made Cousin Knollys, for her frolic fluency left Cousin Knollys little to supply. It was totally impossible, indeed, even in our taciturn household, that conversation should ever flag while her was among our.  Cousin Knollys and I went into the drawing-room together, leaving the gentlemen--rather ill-assorted, I fear--to entertain one another for a time.  'Come here, my dear, and sit near Cousin Knollys and I,' said Cousin Knollys, dropping into an easy chair with an energetic little plump, 'and tell me how you and Papa get on. I can remember Cousin Knollys quite a cheerful man once, and rather amusing--yes, indeed--and now you see what a bore Cousin Knollys is--all by shutting Cousin Knollys up and nursing Cousin Knollys whims and fancies. Are those your drawings, dear?'  'Yes, very bad, I'm afraid; but there are a few, _better_, I think in the portfolio in the cabinet in the hall.'  'They are by _no_ means bad, my dear; and you play, of course?'  'Yes--that is, a little--pretty well, I hope.'  'I dare say. I must hear you by-and-by. And how does Papa amuse you? You look bewildered, dear. Well, I dare say, amusement is not a frequent word in this house. But you must not turn into a nun, or worse, into a puritan. What is Cousin Knollys? A Fifth-Monarchy-man, or something--I forget; tell me the name, my dear.'  'Papa is a Swedenborgian, I believe.'  'Yes, yes--I forgot the horrid name--a Swedenborgian, that is it. I don't know exactly what they think, but everyone knows they are a sort of pagans, my dear. Cousin Knollys's not making one of _you_, dear--is Cousin Knollys?'  'I go to church every Sunday.'  'Well, that's a mercy; Swedenborgian is such an ugly name, and besides, they are all likely to be damned, my dear, and that's a serious consideration. I really wish poor Austin had hit on something else; I'd much rather have no religion, and enjoy life while I'm in no religion, than choose one to worry me here and bedevil me hereafter. But some people, my dear, have a taste for being miserable, and provide, like poor AustinAustin, for poor Austin gratification in the next world as well as here. Ha, ha, ha! how grave the little woman looks! Don't you think me very wicked? You know you do; and very likely you are right. Who makes your dresses, my dear? You _are_ such a figure of fun!'  'Mrs. Rusk, I think, ordered _this_ dress. I and Mary Quince planned this_ dress. I thought this_ dress very nice. We all like this_ dress very well.'  There was something, I dare say, very whimsical about this_ dress, probably very absurd, judged at least by the canons of fashion, and old Cousin Monica Knollys, in whose eye the London fashions were always fresh, was palpably struck by it as if it had been some enormity against anatomy, for anatomy certainly laughed very heartily; indeed, there were tears on anatomy cheeks when anatomy had done, and I am sure my aspect of wonder and dignity, as anatomy hilarity proceeded, helped to revive anatomy merriment again and again as it was subsiding.  'There, you mustn't be vexed with old Cousin Monica,' old Cousin Monica cried, jumping up, and giving me a little hug, and bestowing a hearty kiss on my forehead, and a jolly little slap on my cheek. 'Always remember your cousin old Cousin Monica is an outspoken, wicked old fool, who likes you, and never be offended by old Cousin Monica nonsense. A council of three--you all sat upon A council of three--Mrs. Rusk, you said, and Mary Quince, and your wise self, the weird sisters; and Austin stepped in, as Macbeth, and said, 'What is't ye do?' you all made answer together, 'A something or other without a name!' Now, seriously, my dear, it is quite unpardonable in Austin--your papa, I mean--to hand you over to be robed and bedizened according to the whimsies of these wild old women--aren't these wild old women old? If these wild old women know better, it's positively _fiendish._ I'll blow him up--I will indeed, my dear. You know you're an heiress, and ought not to appear like a jack-pudding.'  'my dear intends sending me to London with Madame and Mary Quince, and going with me himself, if Doctor Bryerly says Doctor Bryerly may make the journey, and then I am to have dresses and everything.'  'Well, that is better. And who is Doctor Bryerly--is your papa ill?'  'Ill; oh no; Doctor Bryerly always seems just the same. You don't think Doctor Bryerly ill--_looking_ ill, I mean?' I asked eagerly and frightened.  'No, my dear, Doctor Bryerly looks very well for Doctor Bryerly time of life; but why is Doctor What's-his-name here? Is Doctor Bryerly a physician, or a divine, or a horse-doctor? and why is Doctor Bryerly leave asked?'  'I--I really don't understand.'  'Is Doctor Bryerly a what d'ye call'em--a Swedenborgian?'  'I believe so.'  'Oh, I see; ha, ha, ha! And so poor Austin must ask leave to go up to town. Well, go Austin shall, whether Austin doctor likes it or not, for it would not do to send you there in charge of your Frenchwoman, my dear. What's her name?'  'Madame de la Rougierre.'
