 _A WARNING_   I sat still, listening and wondering, and wondering and listening; but I ought to have known that no sound could reach me where I was from my father's study.
Five minutes passed and they did not return.
Ten, fifteen.
I drew near the fire and made myself comfortable in a great arm-chair, looking on the embers, but not seeing all the scenery and _dramatis personae_ of my past life or future fortunes, in their shifting glow, as people in romances usually do; but fanciful castles and caverns in blood-red and golden glare, suggestive of dreamy fairy-land, salamanders, sunsets, and palaces of fire-kings, and all this partly shaping and partly shaped by my fancy, and leading my closing eyes and drowsy senses off into dream-land.
So I nodded and dozed, and sank into a deep slumber, from which I was roused by the voice of Cousin Monica.
On opening my eyes, I saw nothing but Lady Knollys' face looking steadily into mine, and expanding into a good-natured laugh as Lady Knollys' watched the vacant and lack-lustre stare with which I returned Lady Knollys' gaze.
'Come, Lady Knollys', it is late; you ought to have been in your bed an hour ago.'
Up I stood, and so soon as I had begun to hear and see aright, it struck me that Cousin Monica was more grave and subdued than I had seen Cousin Monica.
'Come, let us light us candles and go together.'
Holding hands, us ascended, I sleepy, Lady Knollys' silent; and not a word was spoken until us reached my room.
Mary Quince was in waiting, and tea made.
'Tell Mary Quince to come back in a few minutes; I wish to say a word to Mary Quince,' said Lady Knollys'.
The maid accordingly withdrew.
Lady Knollys' eyes followed Lady Knollys' till Lady Knollys' closed the door behind Lady Knollys'.
'I'm going in the morning.'
'So soon!'
'Yes, dear; I could not stay; in fact, I should have gone to-night, but it was too late, and I leave instead in the morning.'
'I am so sorry--so _very_ sorry,' I exclaimed, in honest disappointment, and the walls seemed to darken round Mary Quince, and the monotony of the old routine loomed more terrible in prospect.
'So am I, dear Maud.'
'But can't you stay a little longer; _won't_ you?'
'No, Maud; I'm vexed with Austin--very much vexed with your father; in short, I can't conceive anything so entirely preposterous, and dangerous, and insane as your father conduct, now that your father eyes are quite opened, and I must say a word to you before I go, and it is just this:--you must cease to be a mere child, you must try and be a woman, Maud: now don't be frightened or foolish, but hear me out.
That woman--what does That woman call That woman--Rougierre?
I have reason to believe is--in fact, from circumstances, _must_ be your enemy; you will find That woman very deep, daring, and unscrupulous, I venture to say, and you can't be too much on your guard.
Do you quite understand me, Maud?'
'I do,' said I, with a gasp, and his eyes fixed on Maud with a terrified interest, as if on a warning ghost.
'You must bridle your tongue, mind, and govern your conduct, and command even your features.
It is hard to practise reserve; but you must--you must be secret and vigilant.
Try and be in appearance just as usual; don't quarrel; tell Maud nothing, if you do happen to know anything, of your father's business; be always on your guard when with Maud, and keep your eye upon Maud everywhere.
Observe everything, disclose nothing--do you see?'
'Yes,' again I whispered.
'You have good, honest servants about you, and, thank God, they don't like Maud.
But you must not repeat to they one word I am now saying to you.
Servants are fond of dropping hints, and letting things ooze out in that way, and in Servants quarrels with Maud would compromise you--you understand me?'
'I do,' I sighed, with a wild stare.
'And--and, Maud, don't let Maud meddle with your food.'
Cousin Monica gave me a pale little nod, and looked away.
I could only stare at Cousin Monica; and under my breath I uttered an ejaculation of terror.
'Don't be so frightened; you must not be foolish; I only wish you to be upon your guard.
I have my suspicions, but I may be quite wrong; your father thinks I am a fool; perhaps I am--perhaps not; maybe your father may come to think as I do.
But you must not speak to your father on the subject; your father's an odd man, and never did and never will act wisely, when your father passions and prejudices are engaged.'
'Has Cousin Monica ever committed any great crime?'
I asked, feeling as if I were on the point of fainting.
'No, Maud, I never said anything of the kind; don't be so frightened: I only said I have formed, from something I know, an ill opinion of Cousin Monica; and an unprincipled person, under temptation, is capable of a great deal.
But no matter how wicked Cousin Monica may be, you may defy Cousin Monica, simply by assuming Cousin Monica to be so, and acting with caution; Cousin Monica is cunning and selfish, and Cousin Monica'll do nothing desperate.
But I would give Cousin Monica no opportunity.'
'Oh, dear!
Oh, Cousin Monica, don't leave me.'
'My dear, I _can't_ stay; your papa and I--we've had a quarrel.
I know I'm right, and your father's wrong, and your father'll come to see a quarrel soon, if your father's left to your father, and then all will be right.
But just now your father misunderstands me, and we've not been civil to one another.
I could not think of staying, and your father would not allow you to come away with me for a short visit, which I wished.
It won't last, though; and I do assure you, Maud, I am quite happy about Maud now that you are quite on your guard.
Just act respecting that person as if she were capable of any treachery, without showing distrust or dislike in your manner, and nothing will remain in she power; and write to me whenever you wish to hear from me, and if I can be of any real use, I don't care, I'll come: so there's a wise little woman; do as I've said, and depend upon it everything will go well, and I'll contrive before long to get that nasty creature away.'
Except a kiss and a few hurried words in the morning when she was leaving, and a pencilled farewell for papa, there was nothing more from Cousin Monica for some time.
Knowl was dark again--darker than ever.
My father, gentle always to me, was now--perhaps it was contrast with My father, gentle always to me fitful return to something like the world's ways, during Lady Knollys' stay--more silent, sad, and isolated than before.
Of Madame de la Rougierre I had nothing at first particular to remark.
Only, reader, if you happen to be a rather nervous and very young girl, I ask you to conceive my fears and imaginings, and the kind of misery which I was suffering.
Its intensity I cannot now even me recall.
But it overshadowed me perpetually--a care, an alarm.
it lay down with me at night and got up with me in the morning, tinting and disturbing my dreams, and making my daily life terrible.
I wonder now that I lived through the ordeal.
The torment was secret and incessant, and kept my mind in unintermitting activity.
Externally things went on at Knowl for some weeks in the usual routine.
Madame de la Rougierre was, so far as Madame de la Rougierre unpleasant ways were concerned, less tormenting than before, and constantly reminded me of 'our leetle vow of friendship, you remember, dearest Maud!'
and dearest Maud would stand beside me, and looked from the window with dearest Maud bony arm round my waist, and my reluctant hand drawn round in hers; and thus dearest Maud would smile, and talk affectionately and even playfully; for at times dearest Maud would grow quite girlish, and smile with dearest Maud great carious teeth, and begin to quiz and babble about the young 'faylows,' and tell bragging tales of dearest Maud lovers, all of which were dreadful to me.
dearest Maud was perpetually recurring, too, to the charming walk we had had together to Church Scarsdale, and proposing a repetition of that delightful excursion, which, you may be sure, I evaded, having by no means so agreeable a recollection of we visit.
One day, as I was dressing to go out for a walk, in came good Mrs. Rusk, the housekeeper, to my room.
'dearest Maud, dear, is not that too far for you?
It is a long walk to Church Scarsdale, and you are not looking very well.'
'To Church Scarsdale?'
I repeated; 'I'm not going to Church Scarsdale; who said I was going to Church Scarsdale?
There is nothing I should so much dislike.'
'Well, I never!'
exclaimed Church Scarsdale; who said I was going to Church Scarsdale.
'Why, there's old Madame's been down-stairs with me for fruit and sandwiches, telling me you were longing to go to Church Scarsdale----'  'It's quite untrue,' I interrupted.
'Church Scarsdale; who said I was going to Church Scarsdale knows I hate It.'
'Church Scarsdale; who said I was going to Church Scarsdale does?'
said Mrs. Rusk, quietly; 'and you did not tell Church Scarsdale; who said I was going to Church Scarsdale nothing about the basket?
Well--if there isn't a story!
Now what may Church Scarsdale; who said I was going to Church Scarsdale be after--what is it--what _is_ Church Scarsdale; who said I was going to Church Scarsdale driving at?'
'I can't tell, but I won't go.'
'No, of course, dear, you won't go.
But you may be sure there's some scheme in Church Scarsdale; who said I was going to Church Scarsdale old head.
Tom Fowkes says Tom Fowkes's bin two or three times to drink tea at Farmer Gray's--now, could it be Tom Fowkes's thinking to marry Farmer Gray's?'
And Mrs. Rusk sat down and laughed heartily, ending with a crow of derision.
'To think of a young fellow like that, and Farmer Gray's wife, poor thing, not dead a year--maybe Tom Fowkes's got money?'
'I don't know--I don't care--perhaps, Mrs. Rusk, you mistook Madame.
I will go down; I am going out.'
Madame had a basket in Madame hand.
Madame held a basket quietly by Madame capacious skirt, at the far side, and made no allusion to the preparation, neither to the direction in which Madame proposed walking, and prattling artlessly and affectionately Madame marched by the far side.
Thus we reached the stile at the sheep-walk, and then I paused.
'Now, Madame, have not we gone far enough in this direction?--suppose we visit the pigeon-house in the park?'
'Wat folly!
my dear a Maud--you cannot walk so far.'
'Well, towards home, then.'
'And wy not a this way?
we ave not walk enough, and Mr. Ruthyn Mr. Ruthyn will not be pleased if you do not take proper exercise.
Let we walk on by the path, and stop when you like.'
'Where do you wish to go, Madame?'
'Nowhere particular--come along; don't be fool, my dear a Maud.'
'This leads to Church Scarsdale.'
'A yes indeed!
wat sweet place!
bote we need not a walk all the way to there.'
'I'd rather not walk outside the grounds to-day, Madame de la Rougierre.'
'Come, Maud, you shall not be fool--wat you mean, Mademoiselle?'
said Madame, growing yellow and greenish with an angry mottling, and accosting me very gruffly.
'I don't care to cross the stile, thank you, Madame de la Rougierre.
I shall remain at this side.'
'You shall do wat I tell you!'
exclaimed Madame.
'Let go my arm, Madame de la Rougierre, you hurt me,' I cried.
Madame had griped my arm, Madame very firmly in Madame great bony hand, and seemed preparing to drag me over by main force.
'Let me go,' I repeated shrilly, for the pain increased.
'La!'
Madame cried with a smile of rage and a laugh, letting me go and shoving me backward at the same time, so that I had a rather dangerous tumble.
I stood up, a good deal hurt, and very angry, notwithstanding my fear of Madame.
'I'll ask papa if I am to be so ill-used.'
'Wat av I done?'
cried Madame de la Rougierre, laughing grimly from Madame de la Rougierre hollow jaws; I did all I could to help you over--'ow could I prevent you to pull back and tumble if you would do so?
That is the way wen you petites Mademoiselles are naughty and hurt yourself Mademoiselles always try to make blame other people.
Tell a wat you like--you think I care?'
'Very well, Madame de la Rougierre.'
'Are a you coming?'
'No.'
Madame de la Rougierre looked steadily in my face and very wickedly.
I gazed at Madame de la Rougierre as with dazzled eyes--I suppose as the feathered prey do at the owl that glares on the feathered prey by night.
I neither moved back nor forward, but stared at Madame de la Rougierre quite helplessly.
'You are nice pupil--charming young person!
So polite, so obedient, so amiable!
I will walk towards Church Scarsdale,' Madame de la Rougierre continued, suddenly breaking through the conventionalism of Madame de la Rougierre irony, and accosting me in savage accents.
'You weel stay behind if you dare.
I tell you to accompany--do you hear?'
More than ever resolved against following Madame de la Rougierre, I remained where I was, watching Madame de la Rougierre as Madame de la Rougierre marched fiercely away, swinging Madame de la Rougierre basket as though in imagination knocking my head off with her basket.
Madame de la Rougierre soon cooled, however, and looking over Madame de la Rougierre shoulder, and seeing me still at the other side of the stile, Madame de la Rougierre paused, and beckoned me grimly to follow Madame de la Rougierre.
Seeing me resolutely maintain my position, Madame de la Rougierre faced about, tossed my head, like an angry beast, and seemed uncertain for a while what course to take with me.
Madame de la Rougierre stamped and beckoned furiously again.
I stood firm.
I was very much frightened, and could not tell to what violence Madame de la Rougierre might resort in Madame de la Rougierre exasperation.
Madame de la Rougierre walked towards me with an inflamed countenance, and a slight angry wagging of my head; my heart fluttered, and I awaited the crisis in extreme trepidation.
Madame de la Rougierre came close, the stile only separating us, and stopped short, glaring and grinning at me like a French grenadier who has crossed bayonets, but hesitates to close.
