than a Prologue; in like manner, I think, I can with less Pains write one of the Books of this History, than the Prefatory Chapter to each of them.  To say the Truth, I believe many a hearty Curse has been devoted on the Head of that Author, who first instituted the Method of prefixing to his Play that Portion of Matter which is called the Prologue; and which at first was Part of the Piece itself, but of latter Years has had usually so little Connection with the Drama before which it stands, that the Prologue to one Play might as well serve for any other. Those indeed of more modern Date, seem to be written ^n the same three Topics, viz. an Abuse of the Taste ^f the Town, a Condemnation of all Cotemporary Authors, and an Elogium on the Performance just about to be represented. The Sentiments in all these ^re very little varied, nor is it possible they should; and indeed I have often wondered at the great Inven^^on of Authors, who have been capable of finding ^^ch various Phrases to express the same thing.  In like manner I apprehend, some future His^orian (if any one shall do me the Honor of imitat^^g my Manner) will, after much scratching his Pate, ^estow some good Wishes on my Memory, for hav^^g first established these several initial Chapters; most ^f which, like Modern Prologues, may as proper^^ be prefixed to any other Book in this History as ^ that which they introduce, or indeed to any other ^istory as to this.  But however Authors may suffer by either of these ^ventions, the Reader will find suffieient Emolument ^ the one, as the Spectator has long found in the ^er.  First, it is well known, that the Prologue serves ^e Critic for an Opportunity to try his Faculty of ^issing, and to tune his Cat-call to the best Advan^^ge; by which means, I have known those Musi^^l Instruments so well prepared, that they have been ^^le to play in full Concert at the first rising of the ^^rtain.  The same Advantages may be drawn from these ^hapters, in which the Critic will be always sure of ^eeting with something that may serve as a Whet^ne to his noble Spirit; so that he may fall with a ^ore hungry Appetite for Censure on the History ^elf. And here his sagacity must make it needless observe how artfully these Chapters are calculated that excellent Purpose; for in these we have always taken Care to intersperse somewhat of the sou^^ or acid Kind, in order to sharpen and stimulate the said Spirit of Criticism.  Again, the indolent Reader, as well as Spectator, finds great Advantage from both these; for as they are not obliged either to see the one or read the others, and both the Play and the Book are thus protracted, by the former they have a Quarter of a^ Hour longer to sit at Dinner, and by the Latter the^ have the Advantage of beginning to read at the fourt^ or fifth Page instead of the first; a Matter by n^ means of trivial Consequence to Persons who rea^ Books with no other View than to say they have rea^ them, a more general Motive to read than is commonly imagined; and from which not only La^^ Books, and Good Books, but the Pages of Home^ and Virgil, of Swift and Cervantes have been often turned over.  Many other are the Emoluments which arise from both these, but they are for the most Part so obviou^ that we shall not at present stay to enumerate them especially since it occurs to us that the principal Me^ of both the Prologue and Preface is that they ^ short.  CHAP. II. A whimsical Adventure which befell the Squire, wi^^ the distressed Situation of Sophia. WE must now convey the Reader to Mr. Western Lodgings which were in Piccadilly, where was placed by the Recommendation of the Landlo^ at the Hercules Pillars at Hide-Park-Corner; for that Inn, which was the first he saw on his Arrival Town he placed his Horses, and in those Lodings, which were the first he heard of, he deposit himself.  Here when Sophia alighted from the Hackney-Coach which brought her from the House of Lady Bellaston, she desired to return to the Apartment provided for her, to which her Father very readily agreed, and whither he attended her himself. A short Dialogue, neither very material nor pleasant to relate minutely, then passed between them, in which he ^ressed her vehemently to give her Consent to the Marriage with Blifil, who, as he acquainted her, was ^o be in Town in a few Days; but instead of com^lying, she gave a more peremptory and resolute Re^usal than she had ever done before. This so in^ensed her Father, that after many bitter Vows that ^e would force her to have him whether she would or ^o, he departed from her with many hard Words and Curses, locked the Door and put the Key into his Pocket.  While Sophia was left with no other Company than what attended the closest State Prisoner, namely, Fire and Candle, the Squire sat down to regale himself ^ver a Bottle of Wine, with his Parson and the Land^ord of the Hercules Pillars, who, as the Squire said, would make an excellent third Man, and could ^^nform them of the News of the Town, and how affairs went; for to be sure, says he, he knows a ^reat deal, since the Horses of a many of the Quality and at his House.  In this agreeable Society, Mr. Western past that ^^ening and great part of the succeeding Day, dur^^g which Period nothing happened of sufficient Con^equence to find a Place in this History. All this ^me Sophia past by herself; for her Father swore she should never come out of her Chamber alive, unless ^e first consented to marry Blifil; nor did he ever ^ffer the Door to be unlocked unless to convey her ^^od, on which Occasions he always attended himself.  The second Morning after his Arrival, while he and the Parson were at Breakfast together on a Toast and Tankard, he was informed that a Gentleman was below to wait on him.  'A Gentleman! quoth the Squire, who the Devil can he be? Do, Doctor, go down and see who it is. Mr. Blifil can hardly be come to Town yet. -- Go down, do, and know what his Business is.'  The Doctor returned with an Account that it was a very well dressed Man, and by the Ribbon in his Hat^ he took him for an Officer of the Army; that he said he had some particular Business, which he could deliver to none but Mr. Western himself.  'An Officer!' cries the Squire, 'what can any such Fellow have to do with me? If he wants an^ Order for Baggage-Waggons, I am no Justice o^ Peace here, nor can I grant a Warrant -- Leun come up then, if he must speak to me.'  A very genteel Man now entered the Room; who having made his Compliments to the Squire, and desired the Favor of being alone with him, delivered himself as follows.  'Sir, I come to wait upon you by the Comman^ of my Lord Fellamar, but with a very differen^ Message from what I suppose you expect, after wha^ past the other Night.'  'My Lord who, cries the Squire, I never hear^ the Name of un.'  'His Lordship,' said the Gentleman, is willin^ to impute every thing to the Effect of Liquor, an^ the most trifling Acknowledgment of that Kin^ will set every thing right; for as he has the mo^^ violent Attachment to your Daughter, you, Sir, an^ the last Person upon Earth, from whom he would resent an Affront; and happy is it for you both tha^ he has given such public Demonstrations of h^^ Courage, as to be able to put up an Affair of th^^ Kind, without Danger of any Imputation on his Honor. All he desires therefore, is, that you will before me make some Acknowledgment, the slightest in the World will be sufficient, and he intends this Afternoon to pay his Respects to you, in order to obtain your Leave of Visiting the young Lady on the Footing of a Lover.'  'I don't understand much of what you say, Sir,' said the Squire; 'but I suppose, by what you talk about my Daughter, that this is the Lord which my Lady Cousin Bellaston mentioned to me, and said something about his courting my Daughter. If so be, that how, that be the Case -- you may give my Service to his Lordship, and tell un the Girl is disposed of already.'  'Perhaps, Sir,' said the Gentleman, 'you are not sufficiently apprized of the Greatness of this Offer. I believe such a Person, Title, and Fortune, would be no where refused.'  'Lookee, Sir,' answered the Squire, 'to be very plain, my Daughter is bespoke already; but if she was not, I would not marry her to a Lord upon any Account; I hate all Lords; they are a Parcel of Courtiers and Hannoverians, and I will have nothing to do with them.' -- '  'Well, Sir,' said the Gentleman, 'if that is your' Resolution, the Message I am to deliver to you, is, that my Lord desires the Favor of your Company this Morning in Hide-Park.''  'You may tell my Lord,' answered the Squire, that I am busy and cannot come. I have enough to look after at home, and cannot stir abroad on any Account.'  'I am sure, Sir,' quoth the other, 'you are too much a Gentleman to send such a Message; you will not I am convinced, have it said of you, that after having affronted a noble Peer, you refuse him Satisfaction. His Lordship would have been willing, from his great Regard to the young Lady, to have made up Matters in another Way; but unless he is to look on you as a Father, his Honor will not suffer his putting up such an Indignity as you must be sensible you offered him.'  'I offered him!' cries the Squire; 'it is a d -- m'd Lie. I never offered him any Thing.'  Upon these Words the Gentleman returned a very short verbal Rebuke, and this he accompanied at the same Time with some manual Remonstrances, which no sooner reached the Ears of Mr. Western, than that worthy Squire began to caper very briskly about the Room, bellowing at the same Time with all his Might, as if desirous to summon a greater Number of Spectators to behold his Agility.  The Parson, who had left great Part of the Tankard unfinished, was not retired far; he immediately attended therefore on the Squire's Vociferation, crying, 'Bless me! Sir, what is the Matter?' -- 'Matter!' quoth the Squire, 'here's a High-way-Man, I believe, who wants to rob and murder me -- for he has fallen upon me with that Stick there in his Hand, when I wish I may be d -- n'd if I gid un the least Provocation.'  'How, Sir.' said the Captain, 'did you not tell me I ly'd.'  'No, as hope to be saved, answered the Squire. -- I believe I might say, "'It Was a Lie that I had offered any Affront to my Lord," -- 'bu^ I never said the Word you lie. -- I understand my self better, and you might have understood yourself better than to fall upon a naked Man. If I had had a Stick in my Hand, you would not have dared strike me. I Would have knocked they Lantho^ Jaws about thy Ears. Come down into Ya^ this Minute, and I Will take a Bout with thee at single Stick for a broken Head, that I will; or I wi^ go into naked Room and box thee for a Belly full. At unt half a Man, at unt I Am sure.'  The Captain, with some Indignation, replied, 'I see, Sir, you are below my Notice, and I shall inform his Lordship you are below his. -- I am sorry I dirtied my Fingers with you.' -- At which (...) he withdrew, the Parson interposing to prevent ^e Squire from stopping him, in which he easily ^evailed, as the other, though he made some Efforts ^^ the Purpose, did not seem very violently bent on ^uccess. However, when the Captain was departed, ^e Squire sent many Curses and some Menaces after ^m; but as these did not set out from his Lips till ^ Officer was at the Bottom of the Stairs, and ^ew louder and louder as he was more and more re^ote, they did not reach his Ears, or at least did not ^ard his Departure.  Poor Sophia however, who, in her Prison, heard ^ her Father's Outcries from first to last, began now ^t to thunder with her Foot, and afterward to scream ^oudly as the old Gentleman himself had done before, ^ough in a much sweeter Voice. These Screams ^n silenced the Squire, and turned all his Conside^^^ion toward his Daughter, whom he loved so ten^ly, that the least Apprehension of any Harm hap^ing to her, threw him presently into Agonies: For ^^cept in that single Instance in which the whole fu^e Happiness of her Life was concerned, she was ^ereign Mistress of his Inclinations.  Having ended his Rage against the Captain, with ^earing he would take the Law of him, the Squire ^^ mounted up Stairs to Sophia, whom, as soon as ^ had unlocked and opened the Door, he found all ^e and breathless. The Moment however that she ^ her Father, she collected all her Spirits, and catch^ him hold by the Hand, she cried passionately, 'O my dear Sir, I am almost frightened to Death; I ^ope to Heaven no Harm has happened to you.'  -- 'No, no, cries the Squire, no great Harm. The Rascal has not hurt me much, but rat me i^ I don't ha the Laa o'un.' 'Pray, dear Sir, says she, tell me what is the Matter, who is it that has insulted you?' 'I don't know the Name o'un,' answered Western, 'some Officer Fellow I suppose tha^ we are to pay for beating us, but I Will make him pay this Bout, if the Rascal has got any thing which I suppose he has not. For thof he wa^ dressed out so vine, I question whether he has got a Voot of Land in the World.' 'But, dea^r Sir,' cries she, 'what was the Occasion of you^ Quarrel? 'What should it be, Sophy?' answered the Squire, 'but about you, Sophy? All my Misfortunes are about you; you will be the Death o^ your poor Father at last. Here Is a Varlet of Lord, the Lord knows who forsooth! who has a taan a Liking to you, and because I would no^ gi^un my Consent, he sent me a Kallenge. Come^ do be a good Girl, Sophy, and put an End to a^^ your Father's Troubles; come do, consent to ^un; he will be in Town within this Day or two do but promise me to marry un as soon as he come and you will make me the happiest Man in the World, and I will make you the happiest Woman you shall have the finest Clothes in London, an^ the finest Jewels, and a Coach and Six at yo^ Command. I promised Allworthy already to gi^up half my Estate, -- Od rabbit it! I should hardstick at giving up the whole.' 'Will my Papa be kind, says she, to hear me speak?' -- 'Why wo^t a^ Sophy?' cries he, 'when do know that I had ^ther hear thy Voice, than the Music of the b^ Park of Dogs in England. -- Hear thee, my d^ little Girl! I hope I shall hear thee as long as live; for if I was ever to lose that Pleasure, would not gee a Brass Varden to live a Moment longer. Indeed Sophy, you do not know how I love you, indeed you don't, or you never could have run away, and left your poor Father, who has no other Joy, no other Comfort upon Earth but his little Sophy.' At these Words the Tears stood in his Eyes; and Sophia, (with the Tears streaming from hers) answered, 'Indeed, my dear Papa, I know you have loved me tenderly, and Heaven is my Witness how sincerely I have returned your Affection; nor could any thing but an Apprehension of being forced into the Arms of this Man, have driven me to run from a Father whom I love so passionately, that I would with Pleasure, sacrifice my Life to his Happiness; nay, I have endeavored to reason myself into doing more, and had almost worked up a Resolution, to endure the most miserable of all Lives, to comply with your Inclinations. It was that Resolution alone to which I could not force my Mind; nor can I ever.' Here the Squire began to Look wild, and the Foam appeared at his Lips, which Sophia observing, begged to be heard out, and then proceeded, 'If my Father's Life, his Health, or any real Happiness of his was at Stake, here stands your resolved Daughter, may Heaven blast me, if there is a Misery I would not suffer to preserve you. -- No, that most detested, most loathsome of all Lots would I embrace. I would give my Hand to Blifil for your Sake.' -- 'I tell thee, it will preserve me,' answers the Father; 'it will gee me Health, Happiness, Life, every thing, -- Upon my Soul I shall die if do refuse me; I shall break my Hear, I shall upon my Soul.' -- 'Is it possible,' says she, 'you can have such a Desire to make me miserable?' 'I tell thee noa', answered he loudly, 'my whole Desire is to make thee happy; me! d -- n me if there is a Thing upon Earth I would not do to see thee happy.' -- 'And will not my dear Papa allow me to have the lea^^ Knowledge of what will make me so? If it be tru^^ that Happiness consists in Opinion; what must b^ my Condition, when I think myself the most miserable of all the Wretches upon Eearth.' 'Better think yourself so, said he, than know it b^ being married to a poor bastardly Vagabond.' 'I^ it will content you, Sir, said Sophia, I will give yo^ the most solemn Promise never to marry him no^ any other one while my Papa lives, without hi^ Consent. Let me dedicate my whole Life to you^ Service; let me be again your poor Sophy, and my whole Business and Pleasure be, as it has been, to please and divert you.' 'Lookey, Sophy,' answered the Squire, 'I am not to be choused in this Manner. Your Aunt Western would then have Reason to think me the Fool she does. No, no, Sophy, I'^^ have you to know I have a got more Wisdom, and know more of the World than to take the Word of a Woman in a Matter where a Man is concerned.' 'How, Sir, have I deserved this want o^ Confidence? said she, 'have I ever broke a single Promise to you? Or have I ever been found guilty of a Falsehood from my Cradle?' 'Lookee, Sophy cries he, that is neither here nor there. I am determined upon this Match, and have him you shall d -- n me if shat unt. D -- n me if shat unt, though do hang thyself the next Morning.' At repeating which Words he clinched his Fist, knit his Brows bit his Lips, and thundered so loud, that the poor afflicted, terrified Sophia sunk trembling into her Chair, and had not a Flood of Tears come immediately to her Relief, perhaps worse had followed.  Western beheld the deplorable Condition of his Daughter with no more Contrition or Remorse, than the Turnkey of Newgate feels at viewing the Agonies of a tender Wife, when taking her last Farewell of her condemned Husband; or rather he looked down on her with the same Emotions which arise in an honest fair Tradesman, who sees his Debtor dragged to Prison for 10l. which, though a just Debt, the Wretch is wickedly unable to pay. Or, to hit the Case still more nearly, he felt the same Compunction with a Bawd when some poor Innocent whom she has ensnared into her Hands, falls into Fits at the first Proposal of what is called seeing Company. Indeed this Resemblance would be exact, was it not that the Bawd has an Interest in what she does, and the Father, though perhaps he may blindly think otherwise, can in Reality have none in urging his Daughter to almost an equal Prostitution.  In this Condition he left his poor Sophia, and departed with a very vulgar Observation on the Effect of Tears, he locked the Room, and returned to the Parson, who said every Thing he durst in Behalf of the young Lady, which though perhaps it was not quite so much as his Duty required, yet was it sufficient to throw the Squire into a violent Rage, and into many indecent Reflections on the whole Body of the Clergy, which we have too great an Honor for that sacred Function to commit to Paper.  CHAP. III. What happened to Sophia during her Confinement. THE Landlady of the house where the Squire lodged had begun very early to entertain a strange Opinion of her Guests. However as she was informed that the Squire was a Man of a vast Fortune, and as she had taken Care to exact a very extraordinary Price for her Rooms, she did not think proper to give any Offense? for though she was not without some Concern for the Confinement of poor Sophia, of whose great Sweetness of Temper and Affability, the Maid of the House had made so favorable a Report, which was confirmed by all the Squire's Servants, yet she had much more Concern for her own Interest, than to provoke one, whom, as she said, she perceived to be a very hastish Kind of a Gentleman.  Though Sophia eat but little, yet she was regularly served with her Meals; indeed I believe if she had liked any one Rarity, that the Squire, however angry, would have spared neither Pains nor Cost to have procured it for her; since, however strange it may appear to some of my Readers, he really doated on his Daughter, and to give her any Kind of Pleasure was the highest Satisfaction of his Life.  The Dinner Hour being arrived, black George carried her up a Pullet, the Squire himself (for he had sworn not to part with the Key) attending the Door. As George deposited the Dish, some Compliments passed between him and Sophia, (for he had not seen her since she left the Country, and she treated every Servant with more Respect than some Persons show to those who are in a very slight Degree their Inferiors) Sophia would have had him take the Pullet back, saying, she could not eat, but George begged her to try, and particularly recommended her to the Eggs, of which he said it was full.  All this Time the Squire was waiting at the Door; but George was a great Favorite with his Master, as his Employment was in Concerns of the highest Nature, namely, about the Game, and was accustomed to take many Liberties. He had officiously carried up the Dinner, being, as he said, very desirous to see his young Lady; he made therefore no Scruple of keeping his Master standing above ten Minutes, while Civilities were passing between him and Sophia, for which he received only a good-humoured Rebuke at the Door when he returned.  The Eggs of Pullets, Partridges, Pheasants, etc. were, as George well knew, the most favorite Dainties of Sophia. It was therefore no Wonder, that he who was a very good-natured Fellow, should take Care to supply her with this Kind of Delicacy, at a Time when all the Servants in the House were afraid she would be starved; for she had scarce swallowed a single Morsel in the last forty Hours.  Though Vexation has not the same Effect on all Persons, as it usually has on a Widow, whose Appetite it often renders sharper than it can be rendered by the Air on Bansted Downs, or Salisbury Plain, yet the sublimest Grief, notwithstanding what some People may say to the contrary, will eat at last. And Sophia herself, after some little Consideration, began to dissect the Fowl, which she found to be as full of Eggs as George had reported it.  But if she was pleased with these, it contained something which would have delighted the Royal Society much more; for if a Fowl with three Legs be so invaluable a Curiosity, when perhaps Time has produced a Thousand such, at what Price shall we esteem a Bird which so totally contradicts all the Laws of Animal Economy, as to contain a Letter in its Belly? Ovid tells us of a Flower into which Hyacinthus was metamorphosed, that bears Letters on its Leaves, which Virgil recommended as a Miracle to the Royal Society of his Day; but no Age nor Nation has ever recorded a Bird with a Letter in its Maw.  But though a Miracle of this Kind might have engaged all the Academies des Sciences in Europe, and perhaps in a fruitless Enquiry, yet the Reader by barely recollecting the last Dialogue which passed between Messieurs Jones and Partridge, will be very easily satisfied from whence this Letter came, and how it found its Passage into the Fowl.  Sophia, notwithstanding her long Fast, and notwithstanding her favorite Dish was there before her, no sooner saw the Letter than she immediately snatched it up, tore it open, and read as follows.  Madam, Was I was not sensible to whom I have the Honor of writing, I should endeavor, however difficult, to paint the Horros of my Mind, at the Account brought me by Mrs. Honor: but as Tenderness alone can have any true Idea of the Pangs which Tenderness is capable of feeling; so can this most amiable Quality which my Sophia possesses in the most eminent Degree, sufficiently inform her what her Jones must have suffered on this melancholy Occasion. -- Is there a Circumstance in the World which can highten my Agonies, when I hear of any Misfortune which has befallen you? Surely there is one only, and with that I am accursed. It is, my Sophia, the dreadful Consideration that I am myself the wretched Cause. Perhaps I here do myself too much Honor, but none will envy mean Honor which costs me so extremely dear. Pardon me this Presumption, and pardon me the greater still, if I ask you whether my Advice, my Assistance, my Presence, my Absence, my Death o^ my Tortures can bring you any Relief? Can the most perfect Admiration, the most watchful Observance, the most ardent Love, the most melting Tenderness, the most resigned Submission to your Will make you Amends for what you are to sacrifice to my Happiness? If they can, fly, my lovely Angel, to those Arms which are ever open to received and protect you; and to which, whether you bring yourself alone, or the Riches of the World with you, is, in my Opinion, an Alternative not worth regarding. If, on the contrary, Wisdom shall predominate, and, on the most mature Reflection, inform you, that the Sacrifice is too great; and i^ there be no Way left to reconcile you to your Father, and restore the Peace of your dear Mind, bu^ by abandoning me, I conjure you drive me for eve^ from your Thoughts, exert your Resolution, and let no Compassion for my Sufferings bear the least Weight in that tender Bosom. Believe me, Madam, I so sincerely love you better than myself, that my great and principal End is your Happiness. My first Wish (why would not Fortune indulge me in it?) was, and pardon me if I say, still is to see you every Moment the happiest of Women; my second Wish is to hear you are so; but no Misery on Earth can equal mine, while I think you owe an uneasy Moment to him who is,  Madam, In every Sense, and to every Purpose, Your devoted Thomas Jones.   What Sophia said, or did, or thought upon this Letter, how often she read it, or whether more than once, shall all be left to our Reader's Imagination. The Answer to it he may perhaps see hereafter, but not at present; for this Reason, among others, that she did not now write any, and that for several good Causes, one of which was this, she had no Paper, Pen, nor Ink.  In the Evening while Sophia was meditating on the Letter she had received, or something else, a violent Noise from below disturbed her Meditation. This Noise was no other than a round Bout at Altercation between two Persons. One of the Combatants, by his Voice, she immediately distinguished to be her Father; but she did not so soon discover the shriller Pipes to belong to the Organ of her Aunt Western, who was just arrived in Town, and having by means of one of her Servants, who stopped at the Hercules Pillars, learnt where her Brother lodged, she drove directly to his Lodgings.  We shall therefore take our Leave at present of Sophia, and with our usual Good-Breeding, attend her Ladyship.  CHAP. IV. In which Sophia is delivered from her Confinement. THE Squire and the Parson (for the Landlord was now otherwise engaged) were smoking their Pipes together, when the Arrival of the Lady was first signified. The Squire no sooner heard her Name, than he immediately ran down to usher her up Stairs; for he was a great Observer of such Ceremonials, especially to his Sister, of whom he stood more in awe than of any other human Creature, though he never would own this, nor did he perhaps know it himself.  Mrs. Western, on her Arrival in the Dining Room, having flung herself into a Chair, begun thus to harangue. 'Well, surely no one ever had such an intolerable Journey. I think the Roads, since so many Turnpike Acts, are grown worse than ever. La Brother, how could you get into this odious Place? No Person of Condition, I dare swear, ever set Foot here before. In every Sense, and to every Purpose, Your devoted' 'I don't know, cries the Squire, I think they do well enough; it was Landlord recommended them. I thought as he knew most of the Quality, he could best show me where to get among um.' 'Well, and where is my Niece? says the Lady, have you been to wait upon Lady Bellaston yet?' 'Ay, ay, cries the Squire, your Neice is safe enough; she is up Stairs in Chamber.' 'How,' answered the Lady, 'is my Neice in this House, and does she not know of my being here?' 'No, nobody can well get to her, says the Squire, for she is under Lock and Key. I have her safe; I vetched her from my Lady Cousin the first Night I came to Town, and I have taken Care of her ever since; she is as secure as a Fox in a Bag, I promise you.' 'Good Heaven! returned Mrs. Western, what do I hear! I thought what a fine Piece of Work would be the Consequence of my Consent to your coming to Town yourself; nay, it was indeed your own Headstrong Will, nor can I charge myself with having ever consented to it. Did not you promise me, Brother, that you would take none of these Headstrong Measures. Was it not by those Headstrong Measures that you forced my Neice to run away from you in the Country? Have you Mind to oblige her to take such another Step?' 'Z -- ds and the Devil,' cries the Squire, dashing his Pipe on the Ground, 'did ever Mortal hear the like? when I expected you would have commended me for all I have done, to be fallen upon in this Manner!' 'How! Brother, said the Lady, have I ever given you the least Reason to imagine I should commend you for locking up your Daughter? Have I not often told you, that Women in a free Country are not to be treated with such arbitrary Power? We are as free as the Men, and I heartily wish I could not say we deserve that Freedom better. If you expect I should stay a Moment longer in this wretched House, or that I should ever own you again as my Relation, or that I should ever trouble myself again with the Affairs of your Family, I insist upon it that my Neice be set at Liberty this Instant.' This she spoke with so commanding an Air, standing with her Back to the Fire, with one Hand behind her, and a Pinch of Snuff in the other, that I question whether Thalestris at the Head of her Amazons, ever made a more tremendous Figure. It is no Wonder therefore that the poor Squire was not Proof against the Awe which she inspired. 'There, he cried,' throwing down the Key, 'There it is, do whatever you please. I intended only to have kept her up till Blifil came to Town, which cannot be long; and now if any Harm happens in the mean Time, remember who is to be blamed for it.'  'I will answer it with my Life, cried Mrs. Western, but I shall not intermeddle at all, unless upon one Condition, and that is, that you will commit the whole entirely to my Care, without taking any one Measure yourself, unless I shall eventually appoint you to act. If you ratify these Preliminaries, Brother, I yet will endeavor to preserve the Honor of your Family; if not, I shall continue in a neutral State.'  'I pray you, good Sir, said the Parson, permit yourself this once to be admonished by her Ladyship peradventure by communing with young Madam Sophia, she will effect more than you have been able to perpetrate by more rigorous Measures.'  'What do thee open upon me?' cries the Squire 'If thee do begin to babble, I shall whip thee in presently.'  'Fie, Brother,' answered the Lady, 'is this Language to a Clergyman? Mr. Supple is a Man o^ Sense, and gives you the best Advice, and the whole World, I believe, will concur in his Opinion; but I must tell you I expect an immediate Answer to my catagorical Proposals. Either cede your Daughter to my Disposal, or take her wholly to your own Surprising Discretion, and then I here, before Mr. Supple, evacuate the Garrison, and renounce you and your Family for ever.'  'I pray you let me be a Mediator,' cries the Parson; 'let me supplicate you.'  'Why there lies the Key on the Table,' cries the Squire. 'She may take un up, if she pleases; who hinders her?'  'No, Brother,' answered the Lady, 'I insist on the Formality of its being delivered me, with a full Ratification of all the Concessions stipulated.'  'Why then I will deliver it to you. -- Ther^ it is,' cries the Squire. 'I am sure, Sister, yo^ cannot accuse me of ever denying to trust my Daughter to you. She has a lived wi' you a whole Yea^ and muore to a Time without my ever zeeing her.'  'And it would have been happy for her,' answered the Lady, if she had always lived with me. Nothing of this Kind would have happened under my Eye.'  'Ay, certainly,' cries he, 'I only am to blame.'  'Why, you are to blame, Brother,' answered she, I have been obliged to tell you so, and shall always be obliged to tell you so. However, I hope you will now amend, and gather so much Experience from past Errors, as not to defeat my wisest Machinations by your Blunders. Indeed, Brother, you are not qualified for these Negotiations. All your whole Scheme of Politics is wrong. I once more, therefore, insist, that you do not intermeddle. Remember only what is past. -- '  'Z -- ds and Bl -- d, Sister,' cries the Squire, 'What would you have me say? You are enough to provoke the Devil.'  'There now,' said she, 'just according to the old Custom. I see, Brother, there is no talking to you. I will appeal to Mr. Supple, who is a Man of Sense, if I said any Thing which could put any Human Creature into a Passion; but you are so wrong-headed every Way.'  'Let me beg you Madam,' said the Parson, 'not to irritate his Worship.'  'Irritate him?' said the Lady; -- 'Sure you are as great a Fool as himself. Well, Brother, since you have promised not to interfere, I will once more undertake the Management of my Neice, Lord have Mercy upon all Affairs which are under the Directions of Men. The Head of one Woman is worth a thousand of you.' And now having summoned Servant to show her to Sophia, she departed, bearing the Key with her. She was no sooner gone, than the Squire (having first shut the Door) ejaculated twenty Bitches, and as many hearty Curses against her, not sparing himself for having ever thought of her Estate; but added, 'Now one has been a Slave so long, it would be Pity to lose it at last, for want of holding out a little longer. The Bitch cannot live for ever, and I know I am down for it upon the Will.'  The Parson greatly commended this Resolution) and now the Squire having ordered in another Bottle, which was his usual Method when any Thing either pleased or vexed him, did, by drinking plentifully of this medicinal Julap, so totally wash away his Choler, that his Temper was become perfectly placid and serene, when Mrs. Western returned with Sophia into the Room. The young Lady had on her Hat and Capuchin, and the Aunt acquainted Mr. Western, 'that she intended to take her Neice with her to her own Lodgings; for, indeed, Brother,' says she, 'these Rooms are not fit to receive a Christian Soul in.'  'Very well, Madam,' quoth Western, 'whatever you please. The Girl can never be in better Hands than yours; and the Parson here can do me the Justice to say, that I have said fifty Times behind your Back, that you was one of the most sensible Women in the World.'  'To this,' cries the Parson, 'I am ready to bear Testimony.'  'Nay, Brother,' says Mrs. Western, 'I have always, I Am sure, given you as favorable a Character. You must own you have a little too much Hastiness in your Temper; but when you will allow yourself Time to reflect, I never knew a Man more reasonable.'  'Why then, Sister, if you think so,' said the Squire, 'here's your good Health with all my Heart. I am a little passionate sometimes, but I scorn to bear any Malice. Sophy, do you be a good Girl, and do every Thing your Aunt orders you.'  'I have not the least Doubt of her.' answered Mrs. Western. 'She has had already an Example before her Eyes, in the Behavior of that Wretch her Cousin Harriet, who ruined herself by neglecting my Advice. -- O Brother, what think you? You was hardly gone out of Hearing, when you set out for London, when who should arrive but that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick. He broke in abruptly upon me without Notice, or I would not have seen him. He ran on a long, unintelligible Story about his Wife, to which he forced me to give him a Hearing; but I made him very little Answer, and delivered him the Letter from his Wife, which I bid him answer himself. I suppose the Wretch will endeavor to find us out; but I beg you will not see her, for I am determined I will not.'  'I zee her?' answered the Squire; 'you need not fear me. I Will ge no Encouragement to such undutiful Wenches. It is well for the Fellow her Husband, I was not at Huome. Od rabbit it, he should have taken a Dance thru the Horse-pond, I promise un. You zee, Sophy, what Undutifulness brings Volks to do. You have an Example in your own Family.' Brother,' cries the Aunt, you need not shock my Niece by such odious Repetitions. Why will you not leave every Thing entirely to me?' 'Well, well; I wull, I wull;' said the Squire.' And now Mrs. Western, luckily for Sophia, put an End to the Conversation, by ordering Chairs to be called, I say luckily; for had it continued much longer, fresh Matter of Dissension would, most probably, have arisen between the Brother and Sister; between whom Education and Sex made the only Difference; for both were equally violent and equally positive, they had both a vast Affection for Sophia, and both a sovereign Contempt for each other.  CHAP. V. In which Jones receives a Letter from Sophia, an^ goes to a Play with Mrs. Miller and Partridge. THE Arrival of Black George in Town, and the good Offices which that grateful Fellow ha^ promised to do for his old Benefactor, greatly comforted Jones in the midst of all the Anxiety and Une^siness which he had suffered on the Account of Sophia from whom, by the Means of the said George, received the following Answer to his Letter, whi^^ Sophia, to whom the Use of Pen, Ink, and Pape^ was restored with her Liberty, wrote the very Evening when she departed from her Confinement.  Sir, As I do not doubt your Sincerity in what y^ write, you will be pleased to hear that some of (...) Afflictions are at an End, by the Arrival of (...) Aunt Western, with whom I am at present, a^ with whom I enjoy all the Liberty I can desir^ One Promise my Aunt has insisted on my makin^ which is, that I will not see or converse with a^ Person without her Knowledge and Consent. The Promise I have most solemnly given, and shall m^ inviolably keep: And though she has not expre^ forbidden me writing, yet that must be an Omiss^ from Forgetfulness; or this, perhaps, is includ^ in the Word conversing. However, as I can^ but consider this as a Breach of her generous Confidence in my Honor, you cannot expect tha^ shall, after this, continue to write myself, or receive Letters without her Knowledge. A P^^mise is with me a very sacred Thing, and to be e^tended to every Thing understood from it, as w^^ as to what is expressed by it; and this Conside^^tion may perhaps, on Reflection, afford you so^ Comfort. But why should I mention a Comf^^^ to you of this Kind? For though there is one Thing in which I can never comply with the best of Fathers, yet am I firmly resolved never to act in Defiance of him, or to take any Step of Consequence without his Consent. A firm Persuasion of this, must teach you to divert your Thoughts from what Fortune has (perhaps) made impossible. This your own Interest persuades you. This may reconcile you, I hope, to Mr. Allworthy; and if it will, you have my Injunctions to pursue it. Accidents have laid some Obligations on me, your good Intentions probably more. Fortune may, perhaps, be sometimes kinder to us both than at present. Believe this, that I shall always think of you as I think you deserve, and am,  Sir, Your obliged Humble Servant,Sophia Western.' I charge you write to me no more -- at present at least; and accept this, which is now of no Service to me, which I know you must want, and think you owe the Trifle only to that Fortune by which you found it. Meaning, perhaps, the Bank-bill for 100 l.      A Child who has just learnt his Letters, would have spelt this Letter out in less Time than Jones took in reading it. The Sensations it occasioned were a Mixture of Joy and Grief; somewhat like what divide the Mind of a good Man when he peruses the Will of his deceased Friend, in which a large Legacy, which his Distresses make the more welcome, is bequeathed to him. Upon the whole, however, he was more pleased than displeased; and indeed the Reader may probably wonder that he was displeased at all; but the Reader is not quite so much in Love as was poor Jones: And Love is a Disease, which, though it may in some Instances resemble a Consumption, (which it sometimes causes) in others proceeds in direct Opposition to it, and particularly in this, that i^ never flatters itself, or sees any one Symptom in a favorable Light.  One Thing gave him complete Satisfaction, which was, that his Mistress had regained her Liberty, and was now with a Lady where she might at least assure herself of a decent Treatment. Another comfortable Circumstance, was the Reference which she made to her Promise of never marrying any other Man. For however disinterested he might imagine his Passion, and notwithstanding all the generous Overture made in his Letter, I very much question whether he could have heard a more afflicting Piece of News, tha^ that Sophia was married to another though the Matc^ had been never so great, and never so likely to end in making her completely happy. That refined Degre^^ of Platonic Affection which is absolutely detached from the Flesh, and is indeed entirely and purely spiritual, is a Gift confined to the female Part of the Creation: many of whom I have heard declare, (and doubtless with great Truth) that they would, wit^ the utmost Readiness, resign a Lover to a Rival, when such Resignation was proved to be necessary for the temporal Interest of such Lover. Hence, therefore I conclude, that this Affection is in Nature, though I cannot pretend to say, I have ever seen an Instan^ of it.  Mr. Jones having spent three Hours in reading an^ kissing the aforesaid Letter, and being, at last, in State of good Spirits, from the last mentioned Considerations, he agreed to carry an Appointment which he had before made into Execution. This was to attend Mrs. Miller and her youngest Daughter into the Gallery at the Playhouse, and to admit Mr. Partridge as one of the Company. For as Jones had really tha^ Taste for Humor which many affect, he expected to enjoy much Entertainment in the Criticisms of Partridge; from whom he expected the simple Dictates of Nature, unimproved indeed, but likewise unadulterated by Art.  In the first Row then of the first Gallery did Mr. Jones, Mrs. Miller, her youngest Daughter, and Partridge take their Place: Partridge immediately declared, it was the finest Place he had ever been in. When the first Music was played, he said, 'It was a Wonder how so many Fiddlers could play at one Time, without putting one another out.' While the Fellow was lighting the upper Candles, he cried out to Mrs. Miller, 'Look, look, Madam, the very Picture of the Man in the End of the Common Prayer Book, before the Gun-powder-Treason Service:' Nor could he help observing, with a Sigh when all the Candles were lighted, 'That here were Candles enough burnt in one Night, to keep an honest poor Family for a whole Twelvemonth.'  As soon as the Play, which was Hamlet Prince of Denmark, began, Partridge was all Attention, nor did he break Silence till the Entrance of the Ghost; upon which he asked Jones, 'what Man that was in the strange Dress; something,' said he, 'like what I have seen in a Picture. Sure it is not Armor, is it?' Jones answered, 'That is the Ghost.' To which Partridge replied with a Smile, 'Perswade me to that, Sir, if you can. Though I cannot say I ever actually saw a Ghost in my Life, yet I am certain I should know one, if I saw him, better than that comes to. No, no, Sir, Ghosts don't appear in such Dresses as that, neither.' In this Mistake, which caused much Laughter in the Neighborhood of Partridge, he was suffered to continue, 'till the Scene between the Ghost and Hamlet, when Partridge gave that Credit to Mr. Garrick, which he had denied to Jones, and fell into so violent a Trembling, that his Knees knocked against each other. Jones asked him what was the Matter, and whether he was afraid of the Warrior upon the Stage? 'O la! Sir,' said he, 'I perceive now it is what you told me. I am not afraid of any Thing; for I know it is but a Play: And if it was really a Ghost, it could do one no Harm at such a Distance, and in so much Company; and yet if I was frightened, I am not the only Person.' 'Why, who,' cries Jones, 'dost thou take to be such a Coward here besides thyself?' 'Nay, you may call me Coward if you will; but if that little Man there upon the Stage is not frightened, I never saw any Man frightened in my Life. Ay, ay; go along with you! Ay, to be sure! Who Is Fool then? Will you? Lud have Mercy upon such Fool-Hardiness! -- Whatever happens, it is good enough for you. -- Follow you? I Would follow the Devil as soon. Nay, perhaps, it is the Devil -- for they say he can put on what likeness he pleases. -- Oh! here he is again. -- No farther! No, you have gone far enough already; farther than I Would have gone for all the King's Dominons.' Jones offered to speak, but Partrisge cried, 'Hush, hush, dear Sir, don't you hear him!' And during the whole Speech of the Ghost, he sat with his Eyes fixed partly on the Ghost, and partly on Hamlet, and with his Mouth open; the same Passions which succeeded each other in Hamlet, succeeding likewise in him.  When the Scene was over, Jones said, 'Why, Partridge, you exceed my Expectations. You enjoy the Play more than I conceived possible.' 'Nay, Sir, answered Partridge, 'if you are not afraid of the Devil, I cannot help it; but to be sure it is natural to be surprised at such Things, though I know there is nothing in them: Not that it was the Ghost that surprised me neither; for I should have known that to have been only a Man in a strange Dress: But when I saw the little Man so frightened himself, it was that which took Hold of me.' 'And do thou imagine then, Partridge,' cries Jones, that he was really frightned' 'Nay, Sir,' said Partridge, 'did not you yourself observe afterward, when he found out it was his own Father's Spirit, and how he was murdered in the Garden, how his Fear forsook him by Degrees, and he was struck dumb with Sorrow, as it were, just as I should have been, had it been my own Case. -- But hush' O la? What Noise is that? There he is again. -- Well, to be certain, though I know there is nothing at all in it, I am glad I am not down yonder where those Men are.' Then turning his Eyes again upon Hamlet, 'Ay, you may draw your Sword; what signifies a Sword against the Power of the Devil?'  During the second Act, Partridge made very few remarks. He greatly admired the Fineness of the ^resses; nor could he help observing upon the King's ^ountenance. 'Well,' said he, 'how People may be deceived by Faces? Nulla fides fronti is, I find, a true Saying. Who would think, by looking in the King's Face, that he had ever committed a Mur^er?' He then enquired after the Ghost; but Jones, ^ho intended he should be surprised, gave him no ^ther Satisfaction, than 'that he might possibly see him again soon, and in a Flash of Fire.'  Partridge sat in fearful expectation of this; and ^ow when the Ghost made his next Appearance, Partridge cried out, 'There, Sir, now; what say you now? Is he frightened now or no? As much frightened as you think me, and, to be sure, no Body can help some Fears, I would not be in so bad a Condition as what is his Name, Squire Hamlet, is there, for all the World. Bless me! What Is become of the Spirit? As I am a living Soul, I thought I saw him sink into the Earth.' 'Indeed, you saw right,' answered Jones. 'Well, well,' cries Partridge, 'I know it is only a Play; and besides, if there was any Thing in all this, Madam Miller would not laugh so: For as to you, Sir, you would not be afraid, I believe, if the Devil was here i^ Person. -- There, there -- Ay, no Wonde^ you are in such a Passion; shake the vile wicke^ Wretch to Pieces, If she was my own Mother I should serve her so. To be sure, all Duty to Mother is forfeited by such wicked Doings. -- Ay, go about your Business; I hate the Sight ^^ you.'  Our Critic was now pretty silent till the Play, which Hamlet introduces before the King. This he did n^^ at first understand, 'till Jones explained it to him but he no sooner entered into the Spirit of it, than ^^ began to bless himself that he had never committe^ Murder.' Then turning to Mrs. Miller he asked he^ 'If she did not imagine the King looked as if he w^^ touched; though he is,' said he, 'a good Acto^ and does all he can to hide it. Well, I would n^^ have so much to answer for, as that wicked M^^ there has, to sit upon a much higher Chair than ^^ sits upon. -- No wonder he run away; for yo^^ Sake I Will never trust an innocent Face again.'  The Grave-digging Scene next engaged the Attention of Partridge, who expressed much Surpri^^ at the Number of Skulls thrown upon the Stag^ To which Jones answered, 'That it was one of the most famous Burial-Places about Town.' 'N^ wonder then,' cries Partridge, 'that the Place haunted. But I never saw in my Life a worse Grav^ digger. I had a Sexton, when I was Clerk, the should have dug three Graves while he is diggi^^ one. The Fellow handles a Spade as if it was the first Time he had ever had one in his Hand. A^ ay, you may sing. You had rather sing than wo^^ I believe.' -- Upon Hamlet's taking up the Sku^ he cried out, 'Well, it is strange to see how fearl^ some Men are: I never could bring myself to tou^^ any Thing belonging to a dead Man on any Account. -- He seemed frightened enough too at the Ghost I thought. Nemo omnibus horis sapit.'  Little more worth remembering occurred during the ^ay; at the End of which Jones asked him, 'which of the Players he had liked best?' To this he an^wered, with some Appearance of Indignation at the ^uestion, 'The King without Doubt.' 'Indeed, Mr. Partridge,' says Mrs. Miller, 'you are not of the same Opinion with the Town; for they all agreed, that Hamlet is acted by the best Player who was ever on the Stage.' 'He the best Player!' ^es Partridge with a contemptuous Sneer, 'why I could act as well as he myself. I am sure if I had seen a Ghost, I should have looked in the very same Manner, and done just as he did. And then, to be sure, in that Scene, as you call it, between him and his Mother, where you told me he acted so fine, why, Lord help me, any Man, that is, any good Man, that had such a Mother, would have done exactly the same. I know you are only joking with me; but, indeed, Madam, though I was never at a Play in London, yet I have seen acting before in the Country; and the King for my Money; ^he speak all his Words distinctly, half as loud again as the other. -- Any Body may see he is an Actor.'  While Mrs. Miller was thus engaged in Conversation with Partridge, a Lady came up to Mr. Jones, whom he immediately knew to be Mrs. Fitzpatrick. ^e said, she had seen him from the other Part of the ^allery, and had taken that Opportunity of speaking him, as she had something to say, which might be great Service to himself. She then acquainted ^^ with her Lodgings, and made him an Appoint^ent the next Day in the Morning; which, upon ^ecollection, she presently changed to the Afternoon; which Time Jones promised to attend her.  Thus ended the Adventure at the Play-hou^^ where Partridge had afforded great Mirth, not o^^ to Jones and Mrs. Miller, but to all who sat with hearing, who were more attentive to what he sa^ than to any Thing that passed on the Stage.  He durst not go to Bed all that Night, for Fear the Ghost, and for many Nights after, sweat two three Hours before he went to sleep, with the sa^ Apprehensions, and waked several Times in g^^ Horrors, crying out, 'Lord have Mercy upon ^ there it is.'  CHAP. VI. In which the History is obliged to look back. IT is almost impossible for the best Parent to obse^ an exact Impartiality to his Children, even thou^^ no superior Merit should biass his Affection; but s^ a Parent can hardly be blamed, when that Superior determines his Preference.  As I regard all the Personages of this History the Light of my Children, so I must confess the sa^ Inclination of Partiality to Sophia; and for tha^ hope the Reader will allow me the same Excu^^ from the Superiority of her Character.  This extraordinary Tenderness, which I have my Heroine, never suffers me to quit her any lo^^ Time without the utmost Reluctance. I could no^ therefore, return impatiently to enquire what h^ happened to this lovely Creature since her Depart^^ from her Father's, but that I am obliged first to p^^ a short Visit to Mr. Blifil.  Mr. Western, in the first Confusion into which Mind was cast, upon the sudden News he received his Daughter, and in his first Hurry to go after h^ had not once thought of sending any Account of ^ Discovery to Blifil. He had not gone far, however, before he recollected himself, and according stopped at the very first Inn he came to, and dispatched ^way a Messenger to acquaint Blifil with his having ^ound Sophia, and with his firm Resolution to marry ^er to him immediately, if he would come up after ^im to Town.  As the Love which Blifil had for Sophia was of that ^iolent Kind, which nothing but the Loss of her For^une, or some such Accident, could lessen, his In^ination to the Match was not at all altered by her ^aving run away, though he was obliged to lay this ^o his own Account. He very readily, therefore, em^raced this Offer. Indeed, he now proposed the Gra^^fication of a very strong Passion besides Avarice, by marrying this young Lady, and this was Hatred: For ^e concluded that Matrimony afforded an equal Opportunity of satisfying either Hatred or Love; and his Opinion is very probably verified by much Expe^ience. To say the Truth, if we are to judge by ^e ordinary Behavior of married Persons to each ^ther, we shall, perhaps, be apt to conclude, that the Generality seek the Indulgence of the former Passion only in their Union of every Thing but of Hearts.  There was one Difficulty, however, in his Way, and this arose from Mr. Allworthy. That good Man, when he found by the Departure of Sophia, (for neither that, nor the Cause of it, could be concealed from him) the great Aversion which she had for his Nephew, began to be seriously concerned that he had been deceived into carrying Matters so far. He by ^o Means concurred with the Opinions of those Parents, who think it as immaterial to consult the Inclinations of their Children in the Affair of Marriage, as to solicit the good Pleasure of their Servants when they intend to take a Journey; and who are ^y Law or Decency at least, withheld often from ^sing absolute Force. On the contrary, as he esteemed the Institution to be of the most sacred Kind, ^^ thought every preparatory Caution necessary to preserve it holy and inviolate; and very wisely concluded, that the surest Way to effect this, was by laying the Foundation in previous Affections.  Blifil indeed soon cured his Uncle of all Anger o^ the Score of Deceit, by many Vows and Protestations that he had been deceived himself, with which the many Declarations of Western very well tallied; bu^ now to persuade Allworthy to consent to the renewing his Addresses, was a Matter of such apparent Difficulty, that the very Appearance was sufficient to have deterred a less enterprizing Genius: but this young Gentleman so well knew his own Talents, that nothing within the Province of Cunning, seemed to him hard to be achieved.  Here then he represented the Violence of his own Affection, and the Hopes of subduing Aversion i^ the Lady by Perseverance. He begged that in an Affair on which depended all his future Repose, h^ might at least be at Liberty to try all fair Means for Success. Heaven forbid, he said, that he should ever think of prevailing by any other than the mo^^ gentle Methods. 'Besides, Sir, said he, if they fai^ you may then (which will be surely time enough^ deny your Consent.' He urged the great and eage^ Desire which Mr. Western had for the Match, an^ lastly, he made great Use of the Name of Jones, to whom he imputed all that had happened, and from whom, he said, to preserve so valuable a young Lady was even on Act of Charity.  All these Arguments were well seconded by Thwackum, who dwelt a little stronger on the Authority o^ Parents than Mr. Blifil himself had done. He ascribed the Measures which Mr. Blifil was desirous to take to Christian Motives; 'and though,' says he, 'the good young Gentleman has mentioned Charity last I am almost convinced it is his first and principal Consideration.'  Square, possibly, had he been present, would have ^ng to the same Tune, though in a different Key, ^^d would have discovered much more Moral Fitness ^ the Proceeding; but he was now gone to Bath for ^e Recovery of his Health.  Allworthy, though not without Reluctance, at last ^ielded to the Desires of his Nephew. He said, he ^ould accompany him to London, where he might ^e at Liberty to use every honest Endeavor to gain ^e Lady: 'But I declare,' said he, 'I will never give my Consent to any absolute Force being put on her Inclinations, nor shall you ever have her, unless she can be brought freely to Compliance.'  Thus did the Affection of Allworthy for his Nephew, betray the superior Understanding to be tri^mphed over by the inferior; and thus is the Pru^ence of the best of Heads often defeated by the Tenderness of the best of Hearts.  Blifil having obtained this unhoped for Acquiescence ^n his Uncle, rested not till he carried his Purpose unto Execution. And as no immediate Business re^uired Mr. Allworthy's Presence in the Country, and ^ittle Preparation is necessary to Men for a Journey, ^hey set out the very next Day, and arrived in Town that Evening when Mr. Jones, as we have seen, was ^iverting himself with Partridge at the Play.  The Morning after his Arrival, Mr. Blifil waited on Mr. Western, by whom he was most kindly and graciously received, and from whom he had every possible Assurance (perhaps more than was possible) that he should very shortly be as happy as Sophia could make him; nor would the Squire suffer the young Gentleman to return to his Uncle, till he had, almost against his Will, carried him to his Sister.  CHAP. VII. In which Mr. Western, pays a Visit to his Sister, i^ company with Mr. Blifil. MRS. Western was reading a Lecture on Prudence, and Matrimonial Politics to her Niece when her Brother and Blifil broke in with less Ceremony than the Laws of Visiting require. Sophia no sooner saw Blifil, than she turned pale, and almost lost the Use of all her Faculties; but her Aun^ on the contrary waxed red, and having all her Faculties at Command, began to exert her Tongue on the Squire.  'Brother,' said she, 'I am astonished at you^ Behavior, will you never learn any Regard to Decorum? Will you still look upon every Apartment as your own, or as belonging to one of your Country Tenants? Do you think yourself at Liberty ^ invade the Privacies of Women of Condition, without the least Decency or Notice?' -- 'Why what, the a Pox! is the Matter now, quoth, the Squire, one would think, I had caught you at' -- 'None of your Brutality, Sir, I beseech you,' answered she. -- 'You have surprised my poor Niece 'so, that she can hardly, I see, support herself. -- Go, my dear, retire, and endeavor to recruit you^ Spirits; for I see you have Occasion.' At which Words, Sophia, who never received a more welcom^ Command, hastily withdrew.  'To be sure, Sister,' cries the Squire, 'you a^^ mad, when I have brought Mr. Blifil here to co^^ her, to force her away.'  'Sure, Brother,' says she, 'you are worse tha^ mad, when you know in what Situation Affairs ar^ to -- I am sure, I ask Mr. Blifil pardon, but h^ knows very well to whom to impute so disagreeable a Reception. For my own part, I am sure, I sha^^ always be very glad to see Mr. Blifil; but his own good Sense would not have suffered him to proceed so abruptly, had you not compelled him to it.'  Blifil bowed and stammered and looked like a Fool; ^t Western without giving him time to form a Speech ^r the Purpose, answered, 'Well, well, I am to blame if you will, I always am, certainly; but come, let the Girl be fetched back again, or let Mr. Blifil go to her -- He Is come on Purpose, and there is no time to be lost.'  'Brother,' cries Mrs. Western, 'Mr. Blifil, I am confident, understands himself better than to think of seeing my Niece any more this Morning after what has happened. Women are of a nice Contexture, and our Spirits when disordered are not to be recomposed in a Moment. Had you suffered Mr. Blifil to have sent his Compliments to my Niece, and to have desired the Favor of waiting on her in the Afternoon, I should possibly have prevailed on her to have seen him; but now I despair of bringing about any such Matter.'  'I am very sorry, Madam,' cried Blifil, 'that Mr. Western's extraordinary Kindness to me, which I can never enough acknowledge, should have occasioned -- ' 'Inded, Sir,' said she interrupting ^im, 'you need make no Apologies, we all know my Brother so well.'  'I don't care what any Body knows of me,' answered the Squire, -- 'but when must he come to see her? for consider, I tell you, he is come up on purpose, and so is Allworthy.'' 'Brother,' said ^e, 'whatever Message Mr. Blifil thinks proper to send to my Niece, shall be delivered to her, and I suppose she will want no Instructions to make a proper Answer. I am convinced she will not refuse to see Mr. Blifil at a proper Time.' -- 'The Devil she will not,' answered the Squire. -- 'Odsbud! -- Don't we know -- I say nothing, but some Volk are wiser than all the World. -- If I might have had my will, she had not run away before. And now I expect to hear every Moment she is guone again. For as great a Fool as some Volk think me, I know very well she hates' -- 'No Matter, Brother,' replied Mrs. Western, 'I will not hear my Niece abused. It is a Reflection on my Family. She is an Honor to it, and she will be an Honor to it, I promise you. I will pawn my whole Reputation in the World on her Conduct. -- I shall be glad to see you, Brother, in the Afternoon; for I have somewhat of Importance to mention to you. -- At present, Mr. Blifil, as well as you, must excuse me, for I am in haste to dress.' -- 'Well but,' said the Squire, 'do appoint a Time.' -- 'Indeed,' said she, 'I can appoint no Time. -- I tell you, I will see you in the Afternoon.' -- 'What the Devil would you have me do,' cries the Squire, turning to Blifil, 'I can no muore turn her, than a Beagle can turn an old Hare. Perhaps, she will be in a better Humor in the Afternoon.' -- 'I am condemned, I see, Sir, to Misfortune,' answered Blifil, 'but I shall always own my Obligations to you.' -- He then took a ceremonious Leave of Mrs. Western, who was altogether as ceremonious on her Part, and them they departed, the Squire muttering to himself with an Oath, that Blifil should see his Daughter in the Afternoon.  If Mr. Western was little pleased with this Interview, Blifil was less. As to the former, he imputed the whole Behavior of his Sister to her Humor only, and to her Dissatisfaction at the omission of Ceremony in the Visit; but Blifil saw a little deeper into Things. He suspected somewhat of more Consequence, from two or three Words which dropped from the Lady; and, to say the Truth, he suspected right, as will appear when I have unfolded the several Matters which will be continued in the following Chapter.  CHAP. VIII. Schemes of Lady Bellaston for the Ruin of Jones. LOVE had taken too deep a Root in the Mind of Lord Fellamar to be plucked up by the rude Hands of Mr. Western. In the Heat of Resentment he had indeed given a Commission to Captain Egglane, which the Captain had far exceeded in the Execution; ^or had it been executed at all, had his Lordship been ^ble to find the Captain after he had seen Lady Bellaston, which was in the Afternoon of the Day after he had received the Affront; but so industrious was the Captain in the Discharge of his Duty, that ^aving, after long Enquiry, found out the Squire's Lodg^ngs very late in the Evening, he sat up all Night at ^ Tavern, that he might not miss the Squire in the Morning, and by that Means missed the Revocation which my Lord had sent to his Lodgings.  In the Afternoon then next after the intended Rape ^f Sophia, his Lordship, as we have said, made a ^isit to Lady Bellaston, who laid open so much of the ^haracter of the Squire, that his Lordship plainly (...) the Absurdity he had been guilty of in taking any ^ffence at his Words, especially as he had those honorable Designs on his Daughter. He then unbo^med the violence of his Passion to Lady Bellaston, (...) readily undertook the Cause, and encouraged ^n with certain Assurance of a most favorable Re^^ption, from all the Elders of the Family, and from (...) Father himself when he should be sober, and ^ould be made acquainted with the Nature of the Of^ made to his Daughter. The only Danger, she said, (...) in the Fellow she had formerly mentioned, who, ^ough a Beggar and a Vagabond, had by some Means other, she knew not what, procured himself tolerable Clothes, and past for a Gentleman. 'Now says she, 'as I have for the sake of my Cousin, mad^ it my Business to enquire after this Fellow, I have luckily found out his Lodging;' with which she then acquainted his Lordship. 'I am thinking, m^ Lord,' added she, '(for this Fellow is too mea^ for your personal Resentment) whether it would not be posible for your Lordship to contrive some Method of having him pressed and sent on board Ship. Neither Law nor Conscience forbid the Project: for the Fellow, I promise you, howev^^ well dressed, is but a Vagabond, and as proper as an Fellow in the Streets to be pressed into the Service and as for the conscientious Part, surely the Preservation of a young Lady from such Ruin is a m^meritorious Act; nay, with regard to the Fello^ himself, unless he could succeed (which Heaven forbid) with my Cousin, it may probably be the mea^ of preserving him from the Gallows, and perha^ may make his Fortune in an honest Way.'  Lord Fellamar very heartily thanked her Ladyshi^ for the Part which she was pleased to take in the Affair, upon the Success of which his whole futu^ Happiness entirely depended. He said, he saw at present no Objection to the pressing Scheme, and wou^^ consider of putting it in Execution. He then m^ earnestly recommended to her Ladyship, to do h^ the Honor of immediately mentioning his Propo^^ to the Family; to whom he said, he offered a Ca^ Blanch, and would settle his Fortune in almost a manner they should require. And after uttering any Ecstasies and Raptures concerning Sophia, he to his leave and departed, but not before he had receiv^ the strongest Charge to beware of Jones, and to ^ no time in securing his Person where he should longer be in a Capacity of making any Attempts the Ruin of the young Lady.  The Moment Mrs. Western was arrived at her Lodgings, a Card was dispatched with her Compliments to Lady Bellaston; who no sooner received it, ^han with the Impatience of a Lover, she flew to her Cousin, rejoiced at this fair Opportunity, which be^ond her Hopes offered itself: for she was much better pleased with the Prospect of making the Proposals ^ a Woman of Sense, and who knew the World, ^an to a Gentleman whom she honored with the Appellation of Hottentot; though indeed from him ^he apprehended no Danger of a Refusal.  The two Ladies being met, after very short pre^ous Ceremonials, fell to Business, which was in^eed almost as soon concluded as begun; for Mrs. Western no sooner heard the Name of Lord Fellamar ^han her Cheeks glowed with Pleasure; but when she was acquainted with the Eagerness of his Passion, ^he Earnestness of his Proposals, and the Generosity of his Offer, she declared her full Satisfaction in the most explicit Terms.  In the Progress of their Conversation their Discourse turned to Jones, and both Cousins very pathe^ically lamented the unfortunate Attachment, which both agreed, Sophia had to that young Fellow; and Mrs. Western entirely attributed it to the Folly of her Brother's Management. She concluded however at ^ast, with declaring her Confidence in the good Understanding of her Niece, who though she would not give up her Affection in Favor of Blifil, 'will, I doubt not', says she, 'soon be prevailed upon to sacrifice ^ simple Inclination to the Addresses of a fine Gentleman, who brings her both a Title and a large Estate: For indeed,' added she, 'I must do Sophy the Justice to confess, this Blifil is but a hideous kind of Fellow, as you know, Bellaston, all Country Gentlemen are, and has nothing but his Fortune to recommend him.'  ' Nay,' said Lady Bellaston, 'I don't then so much wonder at my Cousin; for I promise you this Jones is a very agreeable Fellow, and has one Virtue which the Men say is a great Recommendation to us. What do you think, Bell -- I shall certainly make you laugh; nay, I can hardly tell you myself for laughing? -- Will you believe that the Fellow has had the Assurance to make Love to me? But i^ you be inclined to disbelieve it, here is Evidence enough, his own Handwriting, I assure you. She then delivered her Cousin the Letter with the Proposals of Marriage, which if the Reader has a Desire to see, he will find already on Record in the XVth Book of this History.'  'Upon my Word, I am astonished,' said Mrs. Western, 'this is indeed a Masterpiece of Assurance. With your leave, I may possibly make some use of this Letter;' 'You have my full Liberty', cris Lady Bellaston,' 'to apply it to what Purpose you please. However, I would not have it shown to any but Miss Western, nor to her unless you find Occasion.' 'Well, and how did you use the Fellow?' returned Mrs. Western. 'Not as a Husband,' said the Lady, 'I am not married, I promise you, my Dear. You know, Bell, I have tried the Comforts once already, and once I think enough for any reasonable Woman.'  This Letter Lady Bellaston thought would certainly turn the Balance against Jones in the Mind of Sophia, and she was emboldened to give it up, partly by her Hopes of having him instantly dispatched out of the way, and partly by having secured the Evidence of Honor, who, upon sounding her, she saw sufficient Reason to imagine, was prepared to testify whatever she pleased.  But perhaps the Reader may wonder why Lady Bellaston, who in her Heart hated Sophia, should be so desirous of promoting a Match, which was so much to the Interest of the young Lady. Now I would desire such Readers to look carefully into human Nature, Page almost the last, and there he will find, in scarce legible Characters, that Women, notwithstanding the preposterous Behavior of Mothers, Aunts, etc. in Matrimonial Matters, do in Reality think it so great a Misfortune to have their Inclinations in Love thwarted, that they imagine they ought never to carry Enmity higher than upon these Disappointments; again he will find it written, much about the same Place, that a Woman who has once been pleased with the Possession of a Man, will go above half way to the Devil, to prevent any other Woman from enjoying the same.  If he will not be contented with these Reasons, I freely confess I see no other Motive to the Actions of that Lady, unless we will conceive she was bribed by Lord Fellamar, which for my own Part I see no Cause to suspect.  Now this was the Affair which Mrs. Western was preparing to introduce to Sophia, by some prefatory Discourse on the Folly of Love, and on the Wisdom of legal Prostitution for Hire, when her Brother and Blifil broke abruptly upon her; and hence arose all that Coldness in her Behavior to Blifil, which though the Squire, as was usual with him, imputed to a wrong Cause, infused into Blifil himself, (he being a much more cunning Man,) a Suspicion of the real Truth.  CHAP. IX. In which Jones pays a Visit to Mrs. Fitzpatrick. THE Reader may now perhaps be pleased to return with us to Mr, Jones, who at the appointed Hour attended on Mrs. Fitzpatrick; but before we relate the Conversation which now past, it may be proper, according to our Method, to return a little back, and to account for so great an Alteration of Behavior in this Lady, that from changing her Lodging principally to avoid Mr. Jones, she had now industriously, as has been seen, sought this Interview.  And here we shall need only to resort to what happened the preceding Day, when hearing from Lady Bellaston, that Mr. Western was arrived in Town, she went to pay her Duty to him, at his Lodgings a^ Piccadilly, when she was received with many scurvy Compellations too coarse to be repeated, and was even threatened to be kicked out of Doors. From hence an old Servant of her Aunt Western, with whom she was well acquainted, conducted her to the Lodgings of that Lady, who treated her, not more kindly, but more politely; or, to say the Truth, with Rudeness in another Way. In short, she returned from both, plainly convinced not only that her Scheme o^ Reconciliation had proved abortive, but that she must for ever give over all Thoughts of bringing it about by any Means whatever. From this Moment Desire of Revenge only filled her Mind; and in thi^ Temper meeting Jones at the Play, an Opportunity seemed to her to occur of effecting this Purpose.  The Reader must remember, that he was acquainted by Mrs. Fitzpatrick, in the Account she gave o^ her own Story, with the Fondness Mrs. Western had formerly shown for Mr. Fitzpatrick at Bath, from the Disappointment of which, Mrs. Fitzpatrick derived the great Bitterness her Aunt had expressed toward her. She had therefore no Doubt but that the good Lady would as easily listen to the Addresses o^ Mr. Jones, as she had before done to the other, for the Superiority of Charms, was clearly on the side of Mr. Jones, and the Advance which her Aunt had since made in Age, she concluded (how justly I will not say) was an Argument rather in Favor of her Project than against it.  Therefore, when Jones attended after a previous Declaration of her Desire of serving him, arising, as she said from a Firm Assurance how much she should by so doing oblige Sophia; and after some Excuses for her former Disappointment, and after acquainting Mr. Jones in whose Custody his Mistress was, of which she thought him ignorant; she very explicitly mentioned her Scheme to him, and advised him to make Sham Addresses to the older Lady, in order to procure an easy Access to the Younger, informing him at the same Time of the Success which Mr. Fitzpatrick had formerly owed to the very same Stratagem.  Mr. Jones expressed great Gratitude to the Lady for the kind Intentions toward him which she had expressed, and indeed, testified by this Proposal; but besides intimating some Diffidence of Success from the Lady's Knowledge of his Love to her Neice, which had not been her Case in regard to Mr. Fitzpatrick, he said, he was afraid Miss Western would never agree to an Imposition of this Kind, as well from her utter Detestation of all Fallacy, as from her avowed Duty to her Aunt.  Mrs. Fitzpatrick was a little nettled at this; and indeed if it may not be called a Lapse of the Tongue, it was a small Deviation from Politeness in Jones, and into which he would scarce have fallen, had not the Delight he felt in praising Sophia, hurried him out of all Reflection; for this Commendation of one Cousin was more than a tacit Rebuke on the other.  'Indeed, Sir,' answered the Lady, with some Warmth, 'I cannot think there is any thing easier than to cheat an old Woman with a Profession of Love, when her Complexion is amorous; and though she is my Aunt, I must say, there never was a more liquorish one than her Ladyship. Cannot you pretend that the Despair of possessing her Neice, from her being promised to Blifil, has made you turn your Thoughts toward her? As to my Cousin Sophia, I cannot imagine her to be such a Simpleton as to have the least Scruple on such an Account or to conceive any Harm in punishing one of these Haggs for the many Mischiefs they bring upon Families, by their Tragi comic Passions; for which I think it is pity they were not punishable by Law. I had no such Scruple myself, and yet I hope my Cousin Sophia will not think it an Affront when I say she cannot detest every real Species of Falsehood more than her Cousin Fitzpatrick. To my Aunt indeed I pretend no Duty, nor does she deserve any. However, Sir, I have given you my Advice, and if you decline pursuing it, I shall have the less Opinion of your Understanding, that is all.'  Jones now clearly saw the Error he had committed, and exerted his utmost Power to rectify it; but he only faultered and fluttered into Nonsense and Contradiction. To say the Truth, it is often safer to abide by the Consequences of the first Blunder, than to endeavor to rectify it; for by such Endeavors, we generally plunge deeper instead of extricating ourselves; and few Persons will on such Occasions, have the good Nature, which Mrs. Fitzpatrick displayed to Jones; by saying, with a Smile, 'You need attempt no more Excuses; for I can easily forgive a real Lover, whatever is the Effect of Fondness for his Mistress.'  She then renewed her Proposal, and very fervently recommended it, omitting no Argument which her Invention could suggest on the Subject; for she was so violently incensed against her Aunt, that scarce any Thing was capable of affording her equal Pleasure with exposing her, and, like a true Woman, she would see no Difficulties in the Execution of a favou^ite Scheme.  Jones however persisted in declining the Undertaking, which had not indeed the least Probability of Success. He easily perceived the Motives which in^uced Mrs. Fitzpatrick to be so eager in pressing her Advice. He said he would not deny the tender and ^assionate Regard he had for Sophia; but was so con^tious of the Inequality of their Situations, that he ^ould never flatter himself so far as to hope that so ^ivine a young Lady would condescend to think on ^ne so unworthy; nay he protested he could scarce ^ring himself to wish she should. He concluded with ^ Profession of generous Sentiments, which we have ^ot at present Leisure to insert.  There are some fine Women (for I dare not here ^peak in too general Terms) with whom Self is so ^redominant, that they never detach it from any Subject; and as Vanity is with them a ruling Principle, ^hey are apt to lay hold of whatever Praise they meet with; and, though the Property of others, convey ^ to their own Use. In the Company of these La^ies it is impossible to say any thing handsome of another Woman, which they will not apply to themselves; nay they often improve the Praise they seize; ^s for Instance, if her Beauty, her Wit, her Gentili^y, her good Humor deserve so much Commenda^ion, what do I deserve who possess those Qualities ^^ so much more eminent a Degree?  To these Ladies a Man often recommends himself while he is commending another Woman; and while he is expressing Ardour and generous Sentiments for his Mistress, they are considering what a ^harming Lover this Man would make to them, who ^an feel all this Tenderness for an inferior Degree of Merit. Of this, strange as it may seem, I have seen many Instances besides Mrs. Fitzpatrick, to whom all this really happened, and who now began to feel a somewhat for Mr. Jones, the Symptoms of which she much sooner understood than poor Sophia had formerly done.  To say the Truth, perfect Beauty in both Sexes is a more irresistible Object than it is generally thought; for notwithstanding some of us are contented with more homely Lots, and learn by Rot^ (as Children to repeat what gives them no Idea) to despise Outside, and to value more solid Charms; yet I have always observed at the Approach of consummate Beauty, that these more solid Charms only shine with that Kind of Luster which the Stars have after the rising of the Sun.  When Jones had finished his Exclamations, many of which would have become the Mouth of Oroondates himself, Mrs. Fitzpatrick heaved a deep Sigh, and taking her Eyes off from Jones, on whom they had been some time fixed, and dropping them on the Ground, she cried, 'Indeed Mr. Jones, I pity you, but it is the Curse of such Tenderness to be thrown away on those who are insensible of it. I know my Cousin better than you, Mr. Jones, and I must say, any Woman who makes no Return to such a Passion and such a Person, is unworthy of both.'  'Sure, Madam, said Jones, you cannot mean.' -- 'Mean? cries Mrs. Fitzpatrick, I know not what ^ mean; there is something, I think, in true Tenderness bewitching; few Women ever meet with it in Men, and fewer still know how to value it when they do. I never heard such truly noble Sentiments, and cannot tell how it is, but you force one to believe you. Sure she must be the most contemptible o^ Women who can overlook such Merit.'  The Manner and Look with which all this wa^ spoke infused a Suspicion into Jones, which we don'^ care to convey in direct Words to the Reader. Instead of making any Answer, he said, 'I am afraid Madam, I have made too tiresome a Visit,' and offered to take his Leave.  'Not at all, Sir,' answered Mrs. Fitzpatrick. -- 'Indeed I pity you, Mr. Jones, Indeed I do; but if you are going, consider of the Scheme I have mentioned, I am convinced you will approve of it, and let me see you again as soon as you can. -- Tomorrow Morning if you will, or at least some time tomorrow. I shall be at Home all Day.'  Jones then, after many Expressions of Thanks, very respectfully retired; nor could Mrs. Fitzpatrick forbear making a present of a Look at parting, by which if he had understood nothing, he must have had no Understanding in the Language of the Eyes. In Reality it confirmed his Resolution of returning to her no more; for faulty as he has appeared in this History, his whole Thoughts were now so confined to his Sophia, that I believe no Woman upon Earth could have now drawn him into an Act of Inconstancy.  Fortune however, who was not his Friend, resolved, as he intended to give her no second Opportunity, to make the best of this; and accordingly produced the tragical Incident which we are now in sorrowful Notes to record.  CHAP. X. The Consequence of the preceding Visit. MR. Fitzpatrick having received the Letter beforementioned, from Mrs. Western, and being by that Means acquainted with the Place to which his Wife was retired, returned directly to Bath, and thence the Day afterward set forward to London.  The Reader has been already often informed of the jealous Temper of this Gentleman. He may likewise be pleased to remember the Suspicion which he had at Upton conceived of Jones, upon his finding him in the Room with Mrs. Waters; and though sufficient Reasons had afterward appeared entirely to clear that Suspicion, yet now reading so handsome a Character of Mr. Jones from his Wife caused him to reflect that she likewise was in the Inn at the same Time, and jumbled together such a Confusion o^ Circumstances in a Head which was naturally none o^ the clearest, that the whole produced that green-ey'^ Monster mentioned by Shakespeare in his Tragedy o^ Othello.  And now as he was enquiring in the Street after his Wife, and had just received Directions to the Door unfortunately Mr. Jones was issuing from it.  Fitzpatrick did not yet recollect the Face of Jones however seeing a young well-dressed Fellow comin^ from his Wife, he made directly up to him, and asked him what he had been doing in that House: 'Fo^ I am sure, said he, you must have been in it, as saw you come out of it.'  Jones answered very modestly, 'That he had been visiting a Lady there.' To which Fitzpatrick replied, 'What Business have you with the Lady?' Upon which Jones, who now perfectly remembre^ the Voice, Features, and indeed Coat, of the Gentleman, cried out, -- 'Ha, my good Friend! give m^ your Hand; I hope there is no ill Blood remaining between us upon a small Mistake which happene^ so long ago.'  'Upon my Soul, Sir, said Fitzpatrick, I done know your Name, nor your Face.' Indeed, Si^ said Jones, neither have I the Pleasure of knowing your Name, but your Face I very well remember to have seen before, at Upton, where a foolish Quarrel happened between us, which, if it is not mad^ up yet, we will now makeup over a Bottle.'  'At Upton! cried the other. -- 'Ha! upon my Soul, I believe your Name is Jones.' 'Indeed' answered he, 'it is.' -- 'O, upon my Soul, cries Fitzpatrick, you are the very Man I wanted to meet. -- Upon my Soul I will drink a Bottle with you presently; but first I will give you a great Knock over the Pate. There is for you, you Rascal. Upon my Soul, if you do not give me Satisfaction for that Blow, I will give you another.' And then drawing his word, puts himself in a Posture of Defense, which as the only Science he understood.  Jones was a little staggered by the Blow which came me what unexpectedly; but presently recovering himself he also drew, and though he understood nothing ^f Fencing, pressed on so boldly upon Fitzpatrick that he ^at down his Guard, and sheathed one half of his word in the Body of the said Gentleman, who had ^ sooner received it than he stepped backwards, dropped ^e Point of his Sword, and leaning upon it, cried, 'I have Satisfaction enough; I am a dead Man.'  I hope not, cries Jones, but whatever be the Consequence you must be sensible you have drawn it upon yourself. At this Instant a Number of Fellows rushed in and seized Jones, who told them he should make no Resistance, and begged some of them at least would take Care of the wounded Gentleman.'  'Ay, cries one of the Fellows, the wounded Gentleman will be taken Care enough of; for I suppose he has not many Hours to live. As for you, Sir, you have a Month at least good yet.' 'D -- n me, Jack, said another, he has prevented his Voyage; ^he's bound to another Port now;' and many other ^^ Jests was our poor Jones made the Subject of, by ^^ese Fellows, who were indeed the Gang employed Lord Fellamar, and had dogged him into the House Mrs. Fitzpatrick, waiting for him at the Corner of ^e Street when this unfortunate Accident happened.  The Officer who commanded this Gang very wisely concluded, that his Business was now to deliver his Prisoner into the Hands of the Civil Magistrate. H^ ordered him therefore to be carried to a public House where having sent for a Constable, he delivered him to his Custody.  The Constable seeing Mr. Jones very well dres^ and hearing that the Accident had happened in a Due^ treated his Prisoner with great Civility, and at hi^ Request, dispatched a Messenger to enquire after the wounded Gentleman, who was now at a Tavern under the Surgeon's Hands. The Report brought bac^ was that the Wound was certainly mortal, and the^^ were no Hopes of Life. Upon which the Constabl^ informed Jones, that he must go before a Justice* He answered, Wherever you please; I am indifferen^ as to what happens to me, for though I am convince^ I am not guilty of Murder in the Eye of the Law yet the Weight of Blood I find intolerable upon m^ Mind.  Jones was now conducted before the Justice, when the Surgeon who dressed Mr. Fitzpatrick appeared, an deposed that he believed the Wound to be mortal upon which the Prisoner was committed to the Gat^ house. It was very late at Night, so that Jones would not send for Partridge till the next Morning and as he never shut his Eyes till seven, so it was ne^ twelve before the poor Fellow, who was great frightened at not hearing from his Master so long, received a Message which almost deprived him of ^^ Being, when he heard it.  He went to the Gate House with trembling Kne^ and a beating Heart, and was no sooner arrived in t^^ Presence of Jones, than he lamented the Misfortune that had befallen him with many Tears, looking the while frequently about him in great Terror; f^^ as the News now arrived that Mr. Fitzpatrick w^ dead, the poor Fellow apprehended every Minute that ^s Ghost would enter the Room. At last he delivered him a Letter, which he had like to have forgot, ^d which came from Sophia by the Hands of black ^eorge.  Jones presently dispatched every one out of the ^oom, and having eagerly broke open the Letter, ^ad as follows.  You owe the hearing from me again to an Accident which I own surprises me. My Aunt has just now shown me a Letter from you to Lady Bellaston, which contains a Proposal of Marriage. I am convinced it is your own Hand; and what more surprises me is, that it is dated at the very Time when you would have me imagine you was under such Concern on my Account. -- I leave you to comment on this Fact. All I desire is, that your Name may never more be mentioned to  S. W.   Of the present Situation of Mr. Jones's Mind, and the Pangs with which he was now tormented, ^e cannot give the Reader a better Idea, than by say^^g his Misery was such, that even Thwackum would most have pitied him. But bad as it is, we shall at ^esent leave him in it, as his good genius (if he really ^^d any) seems to have done. And here we put an ^^d to the sixteenth Book of our History.  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING BOOK XVII. Containing three Days. CHAP. I. Containing a Portion of introductory Writing. WHEN a Comic Writer has made his principal Characters as happy as he can; or when a Tragic Writer has brought them to the highest Pitch of human Misery, they both conclud^ their Business to be done, and that their Work i^ come to a Period.  Had we been of the Tragic Complexion, the Reade^ must allow we were now very nearly arrived at this Period, since it would be difficult for the Devil, or any of his Representatives on earth, to have contrived much greater Torments for poor Jones, than those to which we left him in the last Chapter; and as for Sophia, good-natured Woman would hardly wish more Un^asiness to a Rival, than what she must at present be ^pposed to feel. What then remains to complete ^e Tragedy but a Murder or two, and a few moral ^entences.  But to bring our Favorites out of their present ^nguish and Distress, and to land them at last on the ^^ore of Happiness, seems a much harder Task; a ^ask indeed so hard that we do not undertake to exe^ute it. In Regard to Sophia it is more than proba^^e, that we shall somewhere or other provide a good ^usband for her in the End, either Blifil, or my lord, or Somebody else; but as to poor Jones, such ^e the Calamities in which he is at present involved, ^wing to his Imprudence, by which if a Man does ^^t become a Felon to the World, he is at least a ^^h de se; so destitute is he now of Friends, and so ^ersecuted by Enemies, that we almost despair of ^inging him to any good; and if our Reader de^^ghts in seeing Executions, I think he ought not to ^^e any time in taking a first Row at Tyburn.  This I faithfully promise, that notwithstanding any ^ffection which we may be supposed to have for this ^ogue, whom we have unfortunately made our He^e, we will lend him none of that supernatural Assis^^nce with which we are entrusted, upon Condition (...) we use it only on very important Occasions. ^^ he does not therefore find some natural Means of (...) extricating himself from all his Distresses, we ^ill do no Violence to the Truth and Dignity of His^^y for his Sake; for we had rather relate that he ^as hanged at Tyburn (which may very probably be ^e Case) than forfeit our Integrity, or shock the Faith of our Reader.  In this the Ancients had a great Advantage over (...) Moderns. Their Mythology, which was at that ^^ more firmly believed by the Vulgar than any ^eligion is at present, gave them always an Opportunity of delivering a favorite Hero. Their Deitie^ were always ready at the Writer's Elbow, to execut^ any of his Purposes; and the more extraordinary the Invention was, the greater was the Surprise and Deligh^ of the Credulous Reader. Those Writers could with greater Ease have conveyed a Friend from one Country to another, nay from one World to another, and have brought him back again, than a poor circumscribe^ Modern can deliver him from a Goal.  The Arabians and Persians had an equal Advantage in Writing their Tales from the Genii and Fa^ries, which the believe in as an Article of their Faith upon the Authority of Koran itself. To natural Means alone we are confined; let us try therefore what by these Means may be done for poor Jones though to confess the Truth, something whispers m^^ in the Ear, that he does not yet know the worst of hi^ Fortune; and that a more shocking Piece of New than any he has yet heard remains for him in the un opened Leaves of Fate.  CHAP. II. The generous and grateful Behavior of Mrs. Miller MR. Allworthy and Mrs. Miller were just sat dow^ to Breakfast, when Blifil, who had gone o^ very early that Morning, returned to make one of the Company.  He had not been long seated before he began ^^ follows, 'Good Lord! my dear Uncle, what do yo^ think has happened? I vow I am afraid of telling you, for fear of shocking you with the Remembrance of ever having shown any Kindness to suc^ a Villain.' 'What is the Matter, Child, said the Uncle, I fear I have shown Kindness in my Li^^ to the Unworthy more than once. But Chari^^ does not adopt the Vices of its Objects.' 'O, Si^ returned Blifil, it is not without the secret Direct^^ on of Providence that you mentioned the Word Adoption. Your adopted Son, Sir, that Jones, that Wretch whom you nourished in your Bosom, has proved one of the greatest Villains upon Earth.' 'By all that is sacred it is false, cries Mrs. Miller. Mr. Jones is no Villain. He is one of the worthiest Creatures breathing; and if any other Person had called him Villain, I would have thrown all this boiling water in his Face.' Mr. Allworthy ^ooked very much amazed at this Behavior. But ^e did not give him Leave to speak, before turn^ng to him, she cried, 'I hope you will not be angry with me; I would not offend you, Sir, for the World; but indeed I could not bear to hear him called so.' 'I must own, Madam,' said Allworthy very gravely, 'I am a little surprised to hear you so warmly defend a Fellow you do not know.' 'O I do know him, Mr. Allworthy,' said she, 'indeed I do; I should be the most ungrateful of all Wretches if I denied it. O he has preserved me and my little Family; we have all Reason to bless him, and turn the Hearts of his malicious Enemies. I know, I find, I see he has such.' 'You surprise me, Madam, still more,' said Allworthy, sure you must mean some other. It is impossible you should have any such Obligations to the Man my Nephew mentions.' 'Too surely,' answered he, 'I have Obligations to him of the greatest and tenderest Kind. He has been the Preserver of me and mine. -- Believe me, Sir, he has been abused, grossly abused to you, I know he has, or you, whom I know to be all Goodness and Honor, would not, after the many kind and tender Things I have heard you say of this poor helpless Child, have so disdainfully called him Fellow. Indeed, my best of Friends, he deserves a kinder Appellation from you, had you heard the good, the kind, the grateful Things which I have heard him utter of you; he never mentions your name but with a Sort of Adoration. In this very Room I have seen him on his Knees, imploring all the Blessings of Heaven upon your Head. I do not love that Child there better than he loves you.'  'I see, Sir,' said Blifil, with one of those grinning Sneers with which the Devil marks his bes^ Beloved, 'Mrs. Miller really does know him. ^ suppose you will find she is not the only one of you^ Acquaintance to whom he has exposed you. A^ for my Character, I perceive by some Hints she has thrown out, he has been very free with it but I forgive him.' 'And the Lord forgive you Sir,' says Mrs. Miller, 'we have all Sins enough to stand in Need of his Forgiveness.'  'Upon my Word, Mrs. Miller,' said Allworthy 'I do not take this Behavior of yours to my Nephew, kindly; and I do assure you as any Reflections which you cast upon him must come only from that wickedest of Men, they would only serve if that were possible, to heighten my Resentment against him: For I must tell you, Mrs. Miller the young Man who now stands before you, has ever been the warmest Advocate for the ungratefu^ Wretch whose Cause you espouse. This, I think when you hear it from my own Mouth, will make you wonder at so much Baseness and Ingratitude.'  'You are deceived, Sir,' answered Mrs. Miller 'if they were the last Words which were to issue from my Lips, I would say you were deceived and I once more repeat it, the Lord forgive those who have deceived you. I do not pretend to say the young Man is without Faults; but they are the Faults of Wildness and of Youth; Faults which he may, nay which I am certain he will relinquish^ and if he should not, they are vastly overbalance by one of the most humane tender honest Hearts that ever Man was blessed with.'  'Indeed, Mrs. Miller, said Allworthy, had this been related of you, I should not have believed it.' Indeed, Sir, answered she, you will believe every Thing I have said, I am sure you will: and when you have heard the Story which I shall tell you, (for I will tell you all) you will be so far from being offended, that you will own (I know your Justice so well) that I must have been the most despicable and most ungrateful of Wretches, if I had acted any other Part than I have.'  'Well, Madam, said Allworthy, I shall be very glad to hear any good Excuse for a Behavior which I must confess, I think wants an Excuse. And now, Madam, will you be pleased to let my Nephew proceed in his Story without Interruption. He would not have introduced a Matter of slight Consequence with such a Preface. Perhaps even this Story will cure you of your Mistake.'  Mrs. Miller gave Tokens of Submission, and then Mr. Blifil began thus. 'I am sure, Sir, if you don't think proper to resent the ill Usage of Mrs. Miller, I shall easily forgive what affects me only. I think your Goodness has not deserved this Indignity at her Hands.' 'Well, Child, said Allworthy, but what is this new Instance? What has he done of late?' 'What? cries Blifil, notwithstanding all Mrs. Miller has said, I am very sorry to relate, and what you should never have heard from me, had it not been a Matter impossible to conceal from the whole World. In short he has killed a Man; I will not say murdered, -- for perhaps it may not be so construed in Law, and I hope the best for his Sake.'  ' Allworthy looked shocked, and blessed himself; and then turning to Mrs. Miller, he cried, 'Well, Madam, what say you now?'  'Why, I say, Sir, answered she, that I never was more concerned at any Thing in my Life; but if the Fact be true, I am convinced the Man, wh^ ever he is, was in Fault. Heaven knows there ar^ many Villains in this Town, who make it their Business to provoke young Gentlemen. Nothing but the greatest Provocation could have tempte^ him; for of all the Geetlemen I ever had in my House, I never saw one so gentle, or so sweet-tempered. He was beloved by every one in the House and every one who came near it.'  While she was thus running on, a violent Knocking at the Door interrupted the Conversation, and prevented her from proceeding any further, or from receiving any Answer; for as she concluded this wa^ a Visiter to Mr. Allworthy, she hastily retired, taking with her her little Girl, whose Eyes were all ove^ blubbered at the melancholy News she heard of Jones who used to call her his little Wife, and not only gave her many Playthings, but spent whole Hours in playing with her himself.  Some Readers may perhaps be pleased with these minute Circumstances, in relating of which we follow the Example of Plutarch, one of the best of ou^ Brother Historians; and others to whom they may appear trivial, will, we hope, at least pardon them as we are never prolix on such Occasions.  CHAP. III. The Arrival of Mr. Western, with some Matters concerning the Paternal Authority. MRS. Miller had not long left the Room, when Mr. Western entered; but not before a small wrangling Bout had passed between him and his Chairmen; for the Fellows who had taken up their Burden at the Hercules Pillars, had conceived no Hopes of having any future good Customer in the Squire; and they were moreover farther encouraged by his Generosity, (for he had given them of his own Accord Sixpence more than their Fare) they therefore very boldly demanded another Shilling, which so provoked the Squire, that he not only bestowed many hear^y Curses on them at the Door, but retained his Anger after he came into the Room; swearing, that all the Londoners were like the Court, and thought of nothing but plundering Country Gentlemen. 'D -- n me, says he, if I will not walk in the Rain rather than get into one of their Handbarrows again. They have jolted me more in a Mile than Brown Bess would in a long Fox Chase.'  When his Wrath on this Occasion was a little appeased, he resumed the same passionate Tone on another. 'There, says he, there is fine Business forwards now. The Hounds have changed at last, and when we imagined we had a Fox to deal with, Od-rat-it, it turns out to be a Badger at last.'  'Pray, my good Neighbor, said Allworthy, drop your Metaphors, and speak a little plainer.' 'Why then, says the Squire, to tell you plainly, we have been all this Time afraid of a Son of a Whore of a Bastard of SomeBody's, I don't know who is not I -- And now here is a confounded Son of a Whore of a Lord, who may be a Bastard too for ought I know or care, for he shall never have a Daughter of mine by my Consent. They have beggared the Nation, but they shall never beggar me. My Land shall never be sent over to Hannover.'  'You surprise me much, my good Friend, said Allworthy.' 'Why, zounds! I am surprised myself, answered the Squire, I went to zee Sister Western last Night, according to her own Appointment, and there I was a had into a whole Room-full of Women. -- There was my Lady Cousin Bellaston, and my Lady Betty, and my Lady Catharine, and my Lady I don't know who; d -- n me if ever yo^ catch me among such a Kennel of Hoop-pettico^ B -- s. D -- n me, I Would rather be run by m^ own Dogs, as one Acton was, that the Story Book says was turned into a Hare; and his own Dogs killed un, and eat un. Od-rabbet-it, no Morta^ was ever run in such a Manner; if I dodged on Way, one had me, if I offered to clap back, another snap'd me. O! certainly one of the great Matches in England, says one Cousin (here he attempted to mimic them) A very advantageous Offer indeed, cries another Cousin. (for you mu^^ know they be all my Cousins, thof I never zee^ half oum before.)' 'Surely, says that fat a -- * B --, my Lady Bellaston, Cousin, you must be ou^ of your Wits to think of refusing such an Offer.'  'Now I begin to understand, says Allworthy, some Person has made Proposals to Miss Western, which the Ladies of the Family approve, but is not t^ your Liking.'  'My Liking! said Western, how the Devil should it? I tell you it is a Lord, and those are alway^ Volks whom you know I always resolved to have nothing to do with. Did unt I refuse a matter ^vorty Years Purchase now for a Bit of Land, which one oum had a Mind to put into a Park, only because I would have no Dealing with Lords, and do think I would marry my Daughter zu? Besides ben't I engaged to you, and did I ever go off an Bargain when I had promised?'  'As to that Point, Neighbor, said Allworthy, entirely release you from any Engagement. N^ Contract can be binding between Parties who have not a full Power to make it at that Time, nor eve^ afterward acquire the Power of fulfilling it.'  'Slud! then, answered Western, I tell you I have Power, and I will fulfill it. Come along with m^ directly to Doctors Commons, I will get a License and I will go to Sister and take away the Wench by Force, and she shall ha un, or I will lock her up and keep her upon Bread and Water as long as she lives.'  'Mr. Western, said Allworthy, shall I beg you will hear my full Sentiments on this Matter?' 'Hear thee! ay to be sure, I will, answered he.' 'Why then, Sir, cries Allworthy, I can truly say, without a Compliment either to you or to the young Lady, that when this Match was proposed, I embraced it very readily and heartily, from my Regard to you both. An Alliance between two Families so nearly Neighbors, and between whom there had always existed so mutual an Intercourse and good Harmony, I thought a most desirable Event; and with Regard to the young Lady, not only the concurrent Opinion of all who knew her, but my own Observation assured me that she would be an inestimable Treasure to a good Husband. I shall say nothing of her personal Qualifications, which certainly are admirable; her Goodnature, her charitable Disposition, her Modesty are too well known to need any Panegyric: but she has one Quality which existed in a high Degree in that best of Women, who is now one of the first Angels, which as it is not of a glaring Kind, more commonly escapes Observation; so little indeed is it remarked, that I want a Word to express it. I must use Negatives on this Occasion. I never heard any thing of Pertness, or what is called a Repartee out of her Mouth; no Pretense to Wit, much less to that Kind of Wisdom, which is the Result only of great Learning and Experience; the Affectation of which, in a Woman, is as absurd as any of the Affectations of an Ape. No dictatorial Sentiments, no judicial Opinions, no profound Criticisms. Whenever I have seen her in the Company of Men, she has been all Attention, with the Modesty of a Learner, not the Forwardness of a Teacher. You'^ pardon me for it, but I once, to try her only, desired her Opinion on a Point which was controverted between Mr. Thwackum and Square,' To which she answered with much Sweetness, 'You will pardon me, good Mr. Allworthy, I am sure yo^ cannot in Earnest think me capable of deciding any Point in which two such Gentlemen disagree.' Thwackum and Square, who both alike though themselves sure of a favorable Decision, seconded my Request. She answered with the same good Humor, 'I must absolutely be excused; for I will affront neither so much, as to give my Judgment on his Side.' 'Indeed, she always showed the highest Deference to the Understanding of Men; a Quality, absolutely essential to the making a good Wife, I shall only add, that as she is most apparently void of all Affectation, this Deference must be certainly real.'  Here Blifil sighed bitterly; upon which Western whose Eyes were full of Tears at the Praise of Sophia, blubbered out, 'Don't be Chicken-hearted for shat ha her, d -- n me, shat ha her, if she was twenty Times as good.'  'Remember your Promise, Sir, cried Allworthy, I was not to be interrupted.' 'Well, shat unt, answered the Squire, I will not speak another Word.'  'Now, my good Friend,' continued Allworthy I have dwelt so long on the Merit of this young Lady, partly as I really am in Love with her Character, and partly that Fortune (for the Match in that Light is really advantageous on my Nephew's Side) might not be imagined to be my principal View in having so eagerly embraced the Proposal. Indeed I heartily wished to receive so great a Jewel into my Family; but though I may wish for many good Things, I would not therefore steal them, o^ be guilty of any Violence or Injustice to possess myself of them. Now to force a Woman into a Marriage contrary to her consent or Approbation, is an Act of such Injustice and Oppression, that I wish the Laws of our Country could restrain it; but a good Conscience is never lawless in the worst regulated State, and will provide those Laws for itself, which the Neglect of Legislators has forgotten to supply. This is surely a Case of that Kind; for is it not cruel, nay impious, to force a Woman into that State against her Will; for her Behavior in which she is to be accountable to the highest and most dreadful Court of Judicature, and to answer at the Peril of her Soul. To discharge the Matrimonial Duties in an adequate Manner is no easy Task, and shall we lay this Burden upon a Woman while we at the same Time deprive her of all that Assistance which may enable her to undergo it? Shall we tear her very Heart from her, while we enjoin her Duties to which a whole Heart is scarce equal. I must speak very plainly here, I think Parents who act in this Manner are Accessaries to all the Guilt which their Children afterward incur, and of Course must, before a just Judge, expect to partake of their Punishment; but if they could avoid this, good Heaven! is there a Soul who can bear the Thought of having contributed to the Damnation of his Child?'  'For these Reasons, my best Neighbor, as I see the Inclinations of this young Lady are most unhappily averse to my Nephew, I must decline any further Thoughts of the Honor you intended him, though I assure you I shall always retain the most grateful Sense of it.'  'Well, Sir, said Western, (the Froth bursting forth from his Lips the Moment they were uncorked) you cannot say but I have heard you out, and now I expect you will hear me; and if I don't answer every Word o't, why then I Will consent to gee the Matter up. First then I desire you to answer me one Question, Did not I beget her? Did not I beget her? answer me that. They say indeed it is a wise Father that knows his own Child; but I am sure I have the best Title to her, for I bred her up. But I believe you will allow me to be her Father, and if I be, am not I to govern my own Child? I ask you that, am I not to govern my own Child? And if I am to govern her in other Matters, surely I am to govern her in this which concerns her most. And what am I desiring all this while? Am I desiring her to do any Thing for me? To give me anything?' -- 'Zu much on the other Side, that I am only desiring her to take half my Estate now, and the other half when I die. Well, and what is it all vor? Why is unt it to make her happy? It Is enough to make one mad to hear Volks talk; if I was going to marry myself, then she would ha Reason to cry and to blubber; but on the contrary, have NOT I offered to bind down my Land in zuch a Manner, that I could not marry if I would, seeing as narro' Woman upon Earth would ha me. What the Devil in Hell can I do more? I contribute to her Damnation! -- Zounds! I Would zee all the World d -- d bevore her little Vinger should be hurt. Indeed, Mr. Allworthy, you must excuse me, but I am surprised to hear you talk in zuch a Manner, and I must say, take it how you will, that I thought you had more Sense.'  Allworthy resented this Reflection only with a Smile; nor could he, if he would have endeavored it, have conveyed into that Smile any Mixture of Malice or Contempt. His Smiles at Folly were indeed such as we may suppose the Angels bestow on the Absurdities of Mankind.  Blifil now desired to be permitted to speak a few Words. 'As to using any Violence on the young Lady, I am sure I shall never consent to it. My Conscience will not permit me to use Violence on any one, much less on a Lady for whom, however cruel she is to me, I shall always preserve the purest and sincerest Affection; but yet I have read, that Women are seldom Proof against Perseverance. Why may I not hope then by such Perseverance at last to gain those Inclinations, in which for the future I shall, perhaps, have no Rival; for as for this Lord, Mr. Western is so kind to prefer me to him; and sure, Sir, you will not deny but that a Parent has at least a negative Voice in these Matters; nay I have heard this very young Lady herself say so more than once, and declare, that she thought Children inexcusable who married in direct Opposition to the Will of their Parents. Besides, though the other Ladies of the Family seem to favor the Pretensions of my Lord, I do not find the Lady herself is inclined to give him any Countenance; alas, I am too sensible that wickedest of Men remains uppermost in her Heart.'  'Ay, ay, so he does, cries Western.'  'But surely, says Blifil, when she hears of this Murder which he has committed, if the Law should spare his Life. -- '  'What's that, cries Western, Murder, has he committed a Murder, and is there any Hopes of seeing him hanged? -- Tol de roll, tol lol de roll. Here he fell a singing and capering about the Room.  'Child, says Allworthy, this unhappy Passion of yours distresses me beyond Measure. I heartily pity you, and would do every fair Thing to promote your Success.'  'I desire no more,' cries Blifil. 'I am convinced my dear Uncle has a better Opinion of me than to think that I myself would accept of more.'  'Lookee,' says Allworthy, 'you have my Leave to write, to visit, if she will permit it, -- but I insist on no Thoughts of Violence. I will have no Confinement, nothing of that Kind attempted.'  'Well, well, cries the Squire, 'nothing of that shall be attempted; we will try a little longer what fair Means will effect; and if this Fellow be but hanged out of the -- Tol lol de roll. I never heard better News in my Life; I warrant every Thing goes to my Mind. -- Do, prithee, dear Allworthy, come and dine with me at the Hercules Pillars: I have bespoke a Shoulder of Mutton roasted, and a Spare-rib of Pork, and a Fowl and Egg-Sauce. There will be Nobody but ourselves, unless we have a Mind to have the Landlord; for I have sent Parson Supple down to Basingstoke after my Tobacco Box, which I left at an Inn there, and I would not lose it for the World; for it is an old Acquaintance of above Twenty Years standing. I can tell you Landlord is a vast comical Bitch, you will like un hugely.'  Mr. Allworthy at last agreed to this Invitation, and soon after the Squire went off, singing and capering at the Hopes of seeing the speedy tragical End of poor Jones.  When he was gone, Mr. Allworthy resumed the aforesaid Subject with much Gravity. He told his Nephew, 'he wished with all his Heart he would endeavor to conquer a Passion, in which I cannot,;' says he, 'flatter you with the Hopes of succeeding. It is certainly a vulgar Error, that Aversion in a Woman may be conquered by Perseverance. Indifference may, Perhaps, sometimes yield to it; but the usual Triumphs gained by Perseverance in a Lover, are over Caprice, Prudence, Affectation, and often an exorbitant Degree of Levity, which excites Women not overwarm, in their Constitutions, to indulge their Vanity by prolonging the Time of Courtship, even when they are well enough pleased with the Object, and resolve (if they ever resolve at all) to make him a very pitiful Amends in the End. But a fixed Dislike, as I am afraid this is, will rather gather Strength, than be conquered by Time. Besides, my dear, I have another Apprehension which you must excuse. I am afraid this Passion which you have for this fine young Creature, has her beautiful Person too much for its Object, and is unworthy of the Name of that Love, which is the only Foundation of matrimonial Felicity. To admire, to like, and to long for the Possession of a beautiful Woman, without any Regard to her Sentiments toward us, is, I am afraid, too natural: But Love, I believe, is the Child of Love only; at least, I am pretty confident, that to love the Creature who we are assured hates us, is not in Human Nature. Examine your Heart, therefore, thoroughly, my good Boy, and if, upon Examination, you have but the least Suspicion of this Kind, I am sure your own Virtue and Religion will impel you to drive so vicious a Passion from your Heart, and your good Sense will soon enable you to do it without Pain.'  The Reader may pretty well guess Blifil's Answer; but if he should be at a Loss, we are not, at present, at Leisure to satisfy him, as our History now hastens on to Matters of higher Importance, and we cannot longer bear to be absent from Sophia.  CHAP. IV. An extraordinary Scene between Sophia and her Aunt. THE lowing Heifer, and the bleating Ewe in Herds and Flocks, may ramble safe and unregarded through the Pastures. These are, indeed, hereafter doomed to be the Prey of Man; yet many Years are they suffered to enjoy their Liberty undisturbed. But if a plump Do be discovered to have escaped from the Forest, and to repose herself in some Field or Grove, the whole Parish is presently alarmed, every Man is ready to set his Dogs after her; and if she is preserved from the rest by the good Squire, it is only that he may secure her for his own eating.  I have considered a very fine young Woman of Fortune and Fashion, when first found strayed from the Pale of her Nursery, to be in pretty much the same Situation with this Do. The Town is immediately in an Uproar, she is hunted from Park to Play, from Court to Assembly, from Assembly to her own Chamber, and rarely escapes a single Season from the Jaws of some Devourer or other: For if her Friends protect her from some, it is only to deliver her over to one of their own choosing, often more disagreeable to her than any of the rest: While whole Herds on Flocks of other Women securely, and scarce regarded, traverse the Park, the Play, the Opera, and the Assembly; and though, for the most Part at least, they are at last devoured, yet for a long Time do they wanton in Liberty, without Disturbance or Control.  Of all these Paragons, none ever tasted more of this Persecution than poor Sophia. Her ill Stars were not contented with all that she had suffered on Account of Blifil, they now raised her another Pursuer, who seemed likely to torment her no less than the other had done. For though her Aunt was less violent, she was no less assiduous in teazing her, than her Father had been before.  The Servants were no sooner departed after Dinner than Mrs. Western, who had opened the Matter to Sophia, informed her, 'That she expected his Lordship that very afternoon, and intended to take the first Opportunity of leaving her alone with him.' 'If you do, Madam,' answered Sophia, with some Spirit, 'I shall take the first Opportunity of leaving him by himself.' ' 'How! Madam!' cries the Aunt; is this the Return you make me for my Kindness, in relieving you from your Confinement at your Father's?' 'You know, Madam,' said Sophia, 'the Cause of that Confinement was a Refusal to comply with my Father, in accepting a Man I detested; and will my dear Aunt who has relieved me from that Distress, involve me in another equally bad?' 'And do you think then, Madam,' answered Mrs. Western, 'that there is no Difference between my Lord Fellamar and Mr. Blifil?' 'Very little, in my Opinion,' cries Sophia; 'and if I must be condemned to one, I would certainly have the Merit of sacrificing myself to my Father's Pleasure.' 'Then my Pleasure I find,' said the Aunt, 'hath very little Weight with you; but that consideration shall not move me. I act from nobler Motives. The View of aggrandizing my Family, of ennobling yourself is what I proceed upon. Have you no Sense of Ambition? Are there no Charms in the Thoughts of having a Coronet on your Coach?' 'None, upon my Honor,' said Sophia. 'A Pincushion upon my Coach would please me just as well.' 'Never mention Honor,' cries the Aunt. 'It becomes not the Mouth of such a Wretch. I am sorry, Neice, you force me to use these Words; but I cannot bear your grovelling Temper; you have none of the Blood of the Westerns in you. But however mean and base your own Ideas are, you shall bring no Imputation on mine. I will never suffer the World to say of me, that I encouraged you in refusing one of the best Matches in England; a Match which, besides its Advantage in Fotrune, would do Honor to almost any Family, and has indeed, in Title, the Advantage of ours.' 'Surely,' says Sophia, 'I am born deficient, and have not the Senses with which other People are blessed: There must be certainly some Sense which can relish the Delights of Sound and Show, which I have not: For surely Mankind would not labor so much, nor sacrifice so much for obtaining; nor would they be so elate and proud with possessing what appeared to them as it does to me, the most insignificant of all Trifles.'  'No, no, Miss;' cries the Aunt; 'you are born with as many Senses as other People; but I assure you, you are not born with a sufficient Understanding to make a Fool of me, or to expose my Conduct to the World. So I declare this to you upon my Word, and you know, I believe, how fixed my Resolutions are, unless you agree to see his Lordship this Afternoon, I will, with my own Hands, deliver you Tomorrow Morning to my Brother, and will never henceforth interfere with you, no^ see your Face again.' Sophia stood a few Moments silent after this Speech, which was uttered in a most angry and Peremptory Tone; and then bursting into Tears, she cried, 'Do with me, Madam, whatever you please; I am the most miserable, undone Wretch upon Earth; and if my dear Aunt forsakes me, where shall I look for a Protector? -- My dear Neice,' cries she, 'you will have a very good Protector in his Lordship; a Protector, whom nothing but a Hankering after that vile Fellow Jones can make you decline.' 'Indeed, Madam,' said Sophia, 'you wrong me. How can you imagine after what you have shown me, if I had ever any such Thoughts, that I should not banish them forever. If it will satisfy you, I will receive the Sacrament upon it, never to see his Face again.' -- 'But Child, dear Child,' said the Aunt, 'be reasonable ^^ Can you invent a single Objection?' -- 'I have already, I think, told you a sufficient Objection, answered Sophia.' -- 'What?' cries the Aunt; 'I remember none.' 'Sure, Madam,' said Sophia, 'I told you he had used me in the rudest and vilest Manner.' 'Indeed Child,' answered she, 'I never heard you, or did not understand you: -- But what do you mean by this rude and vile Manner?' 'Indeed, Madam,' says Sophia, 'I am almost ashamed to tell you. He caught me in his Arms, and pulled me down on the Settee, and thrust his Hand into my Bosom, and kissed it with such Violence, that I have the Mark upon my left Breast at this Moment.' -- 'Indeed!' said Mrs. Western. 'Yes indeed, Madam,' answered Sophia; 'my Father luckily came in at that Instant, or Heaven knows what Rudeness he intended to have proceeded to.' 'I am astonished and confounded,' cries the Aunt. 'No Woman of the Name of Western has been ever treated so, since we were a Family. I would have torn the Eyes of a Prince out, if he had attempted such Freedoms with me. It is impossible: Sure, Sophia, you must invent this to raise my Indignation against him.' 'I hope, Madam,' said Sophia, 'you have too good an Opinion of me, to imagine me capable of telling an Untruth. Upon my Soul it is true.' 'I should have stabbed him to the Heart had I been present,' returned the Aunt. Yet surely he could have no dishonorable Design: It is impossible; he durst not: Besides his Proposals show he had not; for they are not only honorable but generous. I don't know; the Age allows too great Freedoms. A distant Salute is all I would have allowed before the Ceremony. I have had Lovers formerly, not so long ago neither; several Lovers, though I never would consent to Marriage, and I never encouraged the least Freedom. It is a foolish Custom, and what I never would agree to. No Man kissed more of me than my Cheek. It is as much as one can bring one's self to give Lips up to a Husband; and, indeed, could I ever have been persuaded to marry, I believe I should not have been brought to endure so much.' 'You will pardon me, dear Madam,' said Sophia, 'if I make one Observation: You own you had many Lovers, and the World knows it, even if you should deny i^ You refused them all, and I am convinced one Coronet at least among them.' 'You say true dea^ Sophy,' answered she; 'I had once the Offer of ^ Title.' 'Why then,' said Sophia, 'will you no^ suffer me to refuse this once?' 'It is true, Child, said she, 'I have refused the Offer of a Title; bu^ it was not so good an Offer; that is, not so very very good an Offer.' -- 'Yes, Madam,' said Sophia; 'but you have had very great Proposal from Men of vast Fortunes. It was not the first nor the second, nor the third advantageous Match that offered itself.' 'I own it was not,' said she 'Well, Madam,' continued Sophia, 'and why may not I expect to have a second perhaps better than this? You are now but a young Women, and I am convinced would not promise to yield to the first Lover of Fortune, nay, or of Title too. I am ^ very young Woman, and sure I need not despair.' 'Well, my dear Sophy,' cries the Aunr, 'what would you have me say?' 'Why I beg that I may not be left alone this Evening: Grant me that, and I will submit, if you think, after what is past, I ought to see him in your Company.' 'Well, I will grant it,' cries the Aunt. 'Sophy, you know I love you, and can deny you nothing. You know the Easiness of my Nature; I have not always been so easy. I have been formerly thought cruel; by the Men I mean. I was called the cruel Parthenissa. I have broke many a Window that has had Verses to the cruel Parthenissa in it. Sophy, I was never so handsome as you, and yet I had something of you formerly. I am a little altered. Kingdoms and States, as Tully Cicero says in his Epistles undergo Alterations, and so must the human Form.' Thus run she on for near half an Hour upon herself, and her Conquests and Cruelty, 'till the Arrival of my Lord, who, after a most tedious Visit, ^uring which Mrs. Western never once offered to leave ^he Room, retired, not much more satisfied with the Aunt than with the Neice. For Sophia had brought ^^er Aunt into so excellent a Temper, that she con^ented to almost every Thing the Neice said; and ^greed, that a little distant Behavior might not be ^mproper to so forward a Lover.  Thus Sophia by a little well directed Flattery, for which surely none will blame her, obtained a little Ease for herself, and, at least, put off the evil Day. And now we have seen our Heroine in a better Situation than she has been for a long Time before, we will look a little after Mr. Jones, whom we left in ^he most deplorable Situation that can well be imagined.  CHAP. V. Mrs. Miller and Mr. Nightingale visit Jones in the Prison. WHEN Mr. Allworthy and his Nephew went to meet Mr. Western, Mrs. Miller set fowards ^o her Son-in-Law's Lodgings, in order to acquaint ^im with the Accident which had befallen his Friend Jones; but he had known it long before from Par^ridge, (for Jones, when he left Mrs. Miller, had been furnished with a Room in the same House with Mr. Nightingale.) The good Woman found her Daughter under great Affliction on Account of Mr. Jones, whom having comforted as well as she could, she set forwards to the Gatehouse where he was, and where Mr. Nightingale was arrived before her.  The Firmness and Constancy of a true Friend is Circumstance so extremely delightful to Persons in any Kind of Distress, that the Distress itself, if it be only temporary and admits of Relief, is more than compensated by bringing this Comfort with it. Nor are Instances of this Kind so rare, as some superficial and inaccurate Observers have reported. To say the Truth, Want of Compassion is not to be numbered among our general Faults. The black Ingredien^ which fouls our Disposition is Envy. Hence our Eye is seldom, I am afraid, turned upward to those who are manifestly greater, better, wiser, or happie^ than ourselves, without some Degree of Malignity; while we commonly look down on the Mean and Miserable, with sufficient Benevolence and Pity. In Fact, I have remarked, that most of the Defects which have discovered themselves within my Observation have arisen from Envy only; a hellish Vice; and yet one from which I have known very few absolutely exempt. But enough of a Subject which, if pursued, would lead me too far.  Whether it was that Fortune was apprehensive lest Jones should sink under the Weight of his Adversity, and that she might thus lose the Opportunity of tormenting him; or whether she really abated somewhat of her Severity toward him, she seemed a little to relax her Persecution, by sending him the Company of two such faithful Friends, and what is perhaps more rare, a faithful Servant. For Partridge, though he had many Imperfections, wanted not Fidelity; and though Fear would not suffer him to be hanged for his Master, yet the World, I believe, could not have bribed him to desert his Cause.  While Jones was expressing great Satsfaction in the Presence of his Friends, Partridge brought an^ Account that Mr. Fitzpatrick was still alive, though the Surgeon declared that he had very little Hopes. Upon which Jones fetching a deep Sigh, Nightingale said to him; 'My dear Tom, why should you afflict yourself so upon an Accident, which, whatever be the Consequence, can be attended with no Danger to you, and in which your Conscience cannot accuse you of having been in the least to blame. If the Fellow should die, what have you done more than taken away the Life of a Ruffian in your own Defense? So will the Coroner's Inquest find it; and then you will be easily admitted to Bail: And though you must undergo the Form of a Trial, yet it is a Trial which many Men would stand for you for a Shilling.' 'Come, come, Mr. Jones,' says Mrs. Miller, 'cheer yourself up. I knew you could not be the Aggressor, and so I told Mr. Allworthy, and so he shall acknowledge too before I have done with him.'  Jones gravely answered, 'That whatever might be his Fate, he should always lament the having shed the Blood of one of his Fellow Creatures, as one the highest Misfortunes which could have befallen him. But I have another Misfortune of the tenderest Kind -- O! Mrs. Miller, I have lost what I held most dear upon Earth.' 'That must be a Mistress,' said Mrs. Miller. 'But come, come; I know more than you imagine;' (for indeed Parridge had blabbed all) 'and I have heard more than you know. Matters go better, I promise you, than you think; and I would not give Blifil Sixpence for all the Chance which he has of the Lady.'  'Indeed, my dear Friend, indeed,' answered Jones, you are an entire Stranger to the Cause of my Grief. If you was acquainted with the Story, you would allow my Case admitted of no Comfort. I apprehend no Danger from Blifil. I have undone myself.' 'Don't Despair,' replied Mrs. Milr; 'you know what a Woman can do, and if any Thing be in my Power, I promise you I will do it to serve you. It is my Duty. My Son, my dear Mr. Nightingale, who is so kind to tell me he has Obligations to you on the same Account, knows it is my Duty.' 'Shall I go to the Lady myself? I will say any Thing to her you would have me say.'  'Thou best of Women,' cries Jones, taking her by the Hand; 'talk not of Obligations to me; -- but as you have been so kind to mention it, there is a Favor which, perhaps, may be in your Power. I see you are acquainted with the Lady (how you came by your Information I know not) who sits indeed very near my Heart. If you could contrive to deliver this, (giving her a Paper from his Pocket) I shall for ever acknowledge your Goodness.'  'Give it me,' said Mrs. Miller. 'If I see it not in her own Possession before I sleep may my next Sleep be my last. Comfort yourself, my good young Man; be wise enough to take warning from past Follies, and I warrant all shall be well, and I shall yet see you happy with the most charming young Lady in the World; for so I hear from every one she is.'  'Believe me, Madam,' said he, 'I do not speak the common Cant of one in my unhappy Situation. Before this dreadful Accident happened, P^ had resolved to quit a Life of which I was become sensible of the Wickedness as well as Folly. I do assure you notwithstanding the Disturbances I have unfortunately occasioned in your House, for which I heartily ask your Pardon, I am not an abandoned Profligate. Though I have been hurried into Vices, I do not approve a vicious Character; not will I ever, from this Moment, deserve it.'  Mrs. Miller expressed great Satisfaction in these Declarations, in the Sincerity of which she averred she had an entire Faith; and now, the Remainder of the Conversation past in the joint Attempts of that good Woman and Mr. Nightingale, to cheer the dejected Spirits of Mr. Jones, in which they so well succeeded, as to leave him much better comforted and satisfied than they found him; to which happy Alteration nothing so much contributed as the kind Undertaking of Mrs. Miller, to deliver his Letter to Sophia, which he despaired of finding any Means to accomplish: For when Black George produced the last from Sophia, he informed Partridge, that she had strictly charged him, on pain of having it communicated to her Father, not to bring her any Answer. He was moreover not a little pleased, to find he had so warm an Advocate to Mr. Allworthy himself in this good Woman, who was in Reality one of the worthiest Creatures in the World.  After about an Hour's Visit from the Lady, (for Nightingale had been with him much longer,) they both took their leave, promising to return to him soon; during which Mrs. Miller said, she hoped to bring him some good News from his Mistress, and Mr. Nightingale promised to enquire into the State of Mr. Fitzpatrick's Wound, and likewise to find out some of the Persons who were present at the Rencounter.  The former of these went directly in quest of Sophia, whither we likewise shall now attend her.  CHAP. VI. In which Mrs. Miller pays a Visit to Sophia. ACCESS to the young Lady was by no means difficult; for as she lived now on a perfect friendly footing with her Aunt, she was at full Liberty ^o receive what Visitants she pleased.  Sophia was dressing, when she was acquainted that here was a Gentlewoman below to wait on her. As she was neither afraid, nor ashamed, to see any ^f her own Sex, Mrs. Miller was immediately admitted.  Curt'sies, and the usual Ceremonials between Women who are Strangers to each other being past, Sophia ^^d, 'I have not the Pleasure to know you, Madam.' 'No Madam,' answered Mrs. Miller, 'and I must beg Pardon for intruding upon you. But when you know what has induced me to give you this Trouble, I hope' -- 'Pray, what is your Business, Madam?' said Sophia, with a little Emotion. 'Madam, we are not alone,' replied Mrs. Miller, in a low Voice. 'Go out, Betty,' said Sophia.  When Betty was departed, Mrs. Miller said, 'I was desired, Madam, by a very unhappy young Gentleman to deliver you this Letter.' Sophia changed Color when she saw the Direction, well knowing the Hand, and after some Hesitation, said -- 'I could not conceive, Madam, from your Appearance, that your Business had been of such a Nature. -- Whomever you brought this Letter from I shall not open it. I should be sorry to entertain an unjust Suspicion of any one; but you are an utter Stranger to me.'  'If you will have Patience, Madam,' answered Mrs. Miller, 'I will acquaint you who I am, and how I came by that Letter.' 'I have no Curiosity, Madam, to know any thing, cries Sophia, but I must insist on your delivering that Letter back to the Person who gave it you.'  Mrs. Miller then fell upon her Knees, and in the most passionate Terms, implored her Compassion ^ to which Sophia, answered: 'Sure, Madam, it is surprising you should be so very strongly interested in the Behalf of this Person. I would not think Madam' -- 'No, Madam,' says Mrs. Miller you shall not think any thing but the Truth. I will tell you all, and you will not wonder that I am interested. He is the best natured Creature tha^ ever was born.' -- She then began and related the Story of Mr. Henderson -- After this she cried 'This, Madam, this is his Goodness; but I have much more tender Obligations to him. He has preserved my Child.' -- Here after shedding some Tears, she related every thing concerning that Fact^ suppressing only those Circumstances which would have most reflected on her Daughter, and concluded with saying, 'Now, Madam, you shall judge whether I can ever do enough for so kind, so good, so generous a young Man, and sure he is the best and worthiest of all Human Beings.'  The Alteration in the Countenance of Sophia had hitherto been chiefly to her Disadvantage, and had inclined her Complexion to too great Paleness; but she now waxed redder if possible, than Vermilion, 'and cried, I know not what to say, certainly what arises from Gratitude cannot be blamed. -- But what Service can my reading his Letter do your Friend, since I am resolved never -- ' Mrs. Miller fell again to her Entreaties, and begged to be forgiven, but she could not, she said, carry it back. 'Well, Madam,' says Sophia, 'I cannot help it, if you will force it upon me -- Certainly you may leave it whether I will or no.' What Sophia meant, or whether she meant any thing, I will not presume to determine; but Mrs. Miller actually understood this as a Hint, and presently laying the Letter down on the Table took her Leave, having first begged Permission to wait again on Sophia, which Request had neither Assent nor Denial.  The Letter lay upon the Table no longer than till Mrs. Miller was out of Sight; for then Sophia opened and read it.  This Letter did very little Service to his Cause; for it consisted of little more than Confessions of his own Unworthiness, and bitter Lamentations of Despair, together with the most solemn Protestations of his unalterable Fideilty to Sophia, of which he said, he hoped to convince her if he had ever more the Honor of being admitted to her Presence; and that he could account for the Letter to Lady Bellaston, in such a Manner, that though it would not entitle him to her Forgiveness, he hoped at least to obtain it from her Mercy. And concluded with vowing that nothing was ever less in his Thoughts than to marry Lady Bellaston.  Though Sophia read the Letter twice over with great Attention, his Meaning still remained a Riddle to her, nor could her Invention suggest to her any Means to Excuse Jones. She certainly remained very angry with him, though indeed Lady Bellaston took up so much of her Resentment that her gentle Mind had but little left to bestow on any other Person.  That Lady was most unluckily to dine this very Day with her Aunt Western, and in the Afternoon, they were all three by Appointment to go together to the Opera, and thence to Lady Thomas Hatchet's Drum. Sophia would have gladly been excused from all, but she would not disoblige her Aunt; and as to the Arts of counterfeiting Illness, she was so entirely a Stranger to them, that it never once entered into her Head. When she was dressed, therefore, down she went, resolved to encounter all the Horrors of the Day, and a most disagreeable one it proved; for Lady Bellaston took every Opportunity very civilly and slily to insult her; to all which her Dejection of Spirits disabled her from making any Return; and indeed, to confess the Truth, she was at the very best but an different Mistress of Repartee.  Another Misfortune which befell Sophia, was the Company of Lord Fellamar, whom she met at the Opera, and who attended her to the Drum. And though both Places were too public to admit of any Particularities, and she was farther relieved by the Music at the one Place and by the Cards at the other, she could not however enjoy herself in his Company: for there is something of Delicacy in Women, which will not suffer them to be even easy in the Presence of a Man whom they know to have Pretensions to them, which they are disinclined to favor.  Having in this Chapter twice mentioned a Drum, a Word which our Posterity, it is hoped, will not understand in the Sense it is here applied, we shall, notwithstanding our present Haste, stop a Moment to describe the Entertainment here meant, and the rather as we can in a Moment describe it.  A Drum then is an Assembly of well dressed Persons of both Sexes, most of whom play at Cards, and the rest do nothing at all; while the Mistress of the House performs the Part of a Landlady at an Inn, and like the Landlady of an Inn prides herself in the Number of her Guests, though she does not always, like her, get any thing by it.  No wonder then as so much Spirits must be required to support any Vivacity in these Scenes of Dullness, that we hear Persons of Fashion eternally complaining of the Want of them; a Complaint confined entirely to upper Life. How insupportable must we imagine this Round of Impertinence to have been to Sophia, at this time; how difficult must she have found it to force the Appearance of Gaiety into her Looks, when her Mind dictated nothing but the tenderest Sorrow, and when every Thought was charged with tormenting Ideas.  Night, however at last, restored her to her Pillow, where we will leave her to soothe her Melancholy atleast, though incapable we are afraid of Rest, and shall pursue our History, which something whispers us is now arrived at the Eve of some great Event.  CHAP. VII. A pathetic Scene between Mr. Allworthy and Mrs. Miller. MRS. Miller had a long Discourse with Mr. Allworthy at his Return from his Dinner, in which she accquainted him with Jones's having unfortunately lost all which he was pleased to bestow on him at their Separation; and with the Distresses to which that Loss had subjected him; of all which she had received a full Account from the faithful Retailer Partridge. She then explained the Obligations she had to Jones; not that she was entirely explicit with regard to her Daughter; for though she had the utmost. Confidence in Mr. Allworthy, and though there could be no Hopes of keeping an Affair secret, which was unhappily known to more than half a Dozen; yet she could not prevail with herself to mention those Circumstances which reflected most on the Chastity of poor Nancy; but smothered that Part of her Evidence as cautiously as if she had been before a Judge, and the Girl was now on her Trial for the Murder of a Bastard.  Allworthy said, there were few Characters so absolutely vicious as not to have the least Mixture of Good in them. 'However,' says he, 'I cannot deny but that you had some Obligations to the Fellow, bad as he is, and I shall therefore Excuse what has past already, but must insist you never mention his Name to me more; for I promise you it was upon the fullest and plainest Evidence that I resolved to take the Measures I have taken.' 'Well, Sir, says she, I make not the least doubt, but Time will show all Matters in their true and natural Colors, and that you will be convinced this poor young Man deserves better of you than some other Folks that shall be nameless.'  'Madam,' cries Allworthy, a little ruffled, 'I will not hear any Reflections on my Nephew, and if you ever say a Word more of that Kind, I will depart from your House that Instant. He is the worthiest and best of Men; and I once more repeat it to you, he has carried his Friendship to this Man to a blameable Length, by too long concealing Facts of the blackest Die. The Ingratitude of the Wretch to this good young Man is what I most resent; for, Madam, I have the greatest Reason to imagine he had laid a Plot to supplant my Nephew in my Favor, and to have disinherited him.'  'I am sure, Sir,' answered Mrs. Miller a little frightened (for though Mr. Allworthy had the utmost Sweetness and Benevolence in his Smiles, he had great Terror in his Frowns) 'I shall never speak against any Gentlemen you are pleased to think well of. I am sure, Sir, such Behavior would very little become me, especially when the Gentleman is your nearest Relation; but, Sir, you must not be angry with me, you must not indeed, for my good Wishes to this poor Wretch. Sure, I may call him so now, though once you would have been angry with me, if I had spoke of him with the least Disrespect. How often have I heard you call him your Son? How often have you prattled to me of him with all the Fondness of a Parent? Nay, Sir, I cannot forget the many tender Expressions, the many good Things you have told me of his Beauty, and his Parts, and his Virtues: of his Goodnature and Generosity. -- I am sure, Sir, I cannot forget them: For I find them all true. I have experienced them in my own Cause. They have preserved my Family. You must pardon my Tears, Sir, indeed you must, when I consider the cruel Reverse of Fortune which this poor Youth, to whom I am so much obliged, has suffered; when I consider the Loss of your Favor, which I know he valued more than his Life, I must, I must lament him. If you had a Dagger in your Hand, ready to plunge into my Heart, I must lament the Misery of one whom you have loved, and I shall ever love.'  Allworthy was pretty much moved with this Speech, but it seemed not to be with Anger: For after a short Silence, taking Mrs. Miller by the Hand, he said very affectionately to her; 'Come, Madam, let us consider a little about your Daughter. I cannot blame you, for rejoicing in a Match which promises to be advantageous to her; but you know this Advantage, in a great Measure, depends on the Father's Reconciliation. I know Mr. Nightingale very well, and have formerly had Concerns with him; I will make him a Visit, and endeavor to serve you in this Matter. I believe he is a worldly Man; but as this is an only Son, and the Thing is now irretrievable, perhaps he may in Time be brought to Reason. I promise you I will do all I can for you.'  Many were the Acknowledgments which the poor Woman made to Allworthy, for this Kind and generous Offer, nor could she refrain from taking this Occasion again to express her Gratitude toward Jones, 'to whom said she, I owe the Opportunity of giving you, Sir, this present Trouble.' Allworthy gently stopped her; but he was too good a Man to be really offended with the Effects of so noble a Principle as now actuated Mrs. Miller; and indeed had not this new Affair inflamed his former Anger against Jones, it is possible he might have been a little softened toward him by the Report of an Action which Malice itself could not have derived from an evil Motive.  Mr. Allworthy and Mrs. Miller had been above an Hour together, when their Conversation was put an End to by the Arrival of Blifil, and another Person, which other Person was no less than Mr. Dowling, the Attorney, who was now become a great Favorite with Mr. Blifil, and whom Mr. Allworthy, at the Desire of his Nephew, had made his Steward, and had likewise recommended him to Mr. Western, from whom the Attorney received a Promise of being promoted to the same Office upon the first Vacancy; and in the mean Time was employed in transacting some Affairs which the Squire then had in London, in Relation to a Mortgage.  This was the principal Affair which then brought Mr. Dowling to Town, therefore he took the same Opportunity to charge himself with some Money for Mr. Allworthy, and to make a Report to him of some other Business; in all which as it was of much too dull a Nature to find any Place in this History, we will leave the Uncle, Nephew, and their Lawyer concerned, and resort to other Matters.  CHAP. VIII. Containing various Matters. BEFORE we return to Mr. Jones we will take one more View of Sophia.  Though that young Lady had brought her Aunt into great good Humor by those soothing Methods, which we have before related, she had not brought her in the least to abate of her Zeal for the Match with Lord Fellamar; this Zeal was now inflamed by Lady Bellaston, who had told her the preceding Evening, that she was well satisfied from the Conduct of Sophia, and from her Carriage to his Lordship, that all Delays would be dangerous, and that the only Way to succeed, was to press the Match forward with such Rapidity, that the young Lady should have no Time to reflect, and be obliged to consent, while she searce knew what she did. In which Manner, she said, one half of the Marriages among People of Condition were brought about. A Fact very probably true, and to which I suppose is owing the mutual Tenderness which afterward exists among so many happy Couples.  A Hint of the same Kind was given by the same Lady to Lord Fellamar; and both these so readily embraced the Advice, that the very next Day was, at his Lordship's Request, appointed by Mrs. Western for a private Interview between the young Parties. This was communicated to Sophia by her Aunt, and asisted upon in such high Terms, that, after having urged every Thing she possibly could invent against it, without the least Effect, she at last agreed to give the highest Instance of Complaisance which any young Lady can give, and consented to see his Lordship.  As Conversations of this Kind afford no great Entertainment, we shall be excused from reeiting the whole that past at-this Interview; in which, after, his Lordship had made many Declarations of the most pure and ardent Passions, to the silent, blushing Sophia; she at last collected all the Spirits she could raise, and with a trembling low Voice, said, 'My Lord, you must be yourself conscious whether your former Behavior to me has been consistent with the Professions you now make.' 'Is there, answered he, no Way by which I can atone for Madness? What I did, I am afraid must have too plainly convinced you, that the Violence of Love had deprived me of my Senses.' ' 'Indeed my Lord, said she, it is in your Power to give me a Proof of an Affection which I much rather wish to encourage, and to which I should think myself more beholden.' 'Name it, Madam, said my Lord, very warmly.' -- 'My Lord, says she, looking down upon her Fan, I know you must be sensible how uneasy this pretended Passion of yours has made me.' -- 'Can you be so cruel to call it pretended? says he.' 'Yes, my Lord, answered Sophia, all Professions of Love to those whom we persecute, are most insulting Pretenses. This Pursuit of yours is to me a most cruel Persecution; nay, it is taking a most ungenerous Advantage of my unhappy Situation.' 'Most lovely, most adoreable Charmer, do not accuse me cries he, of taking an ungenerous Advantage, while I have no Thoughts but what are directed to your Honor and Interest, and while I have no View, no Hope, no Ambition but to throw myself, Honor, Fortune, every Thing at your Feet. ' My Lord, says she, it is that Fortune and those Honors which give you the Advantage of which I complain. These are the Charms which have seduced my Relations, but to me they are things indifferent. If your Lordship will merit my Gratitude, there is but one Way.' -- 'Pardon me, divine Creature, said he, there can be none. All I can do for you is so much your due, and will give me so much Pleasure, that there is no room for your Gratitude.' -- 'Indeed, my Lord, answered she, you may obtain my Gratitude, my good Opinion, every kind Thought and Wish which it is in my Power to bestow, nay you may obtain them with Ease; for sure to a generous Mind it must be easy to grant my Request. Let me beseech you then to cease a Pursuit, in which you can never have any Success. For your own Sake as well as mine, I entreat this Favor; for sure you are too noble to have any Pleasure in tormenting an unhappy Creature. What can your Lordship propose but Uneasiness to yourself, by a Perseverance, which, upon my Honor, upon my Soul, cannot, shall not prevail with me, whatever Distresses you may drive me to.' Here my Lord fetched a deep Sigh, and then said, -- 'Is it then, Madam, that I am so unhappy to be the Object of your Dislike and Scorn; or will you pardon me if I suspect there is some other?' -- Here he hesitated, and Sophia answered with some Spirit, 'My Lord, I shall not be accountable to you for the Reasons of my Conduct. I am obliged to your Lordship for the generous Offer you have made; I own it is beyond either my Deserts or Expectations; yet I hope my Lord, you will not insist on my Reasons, when I declare I cannot accept it.' Lord Fellamar returned much to this, which we do not perfectly understand, and perhaps it could not all be strictly reconciled either to Sense or Grammar; but he concluded his ranting Speech with saying, 'That if she has preengaged herself to any Gentleman, however unhappy it would make him, he should think himself bound in Honor to desist.' Perhaps my Lord laid too much Emphasis on the Word Gentleman; for we cannot else well account for the Indignation with which he inspired Sophia, who, in her Answer, seemed greatly to resent some Affront he had given her.  While she was speaking, with her Voice more raised than usual, Mrs. Western came into the Room, the Fire glaring in her Cheeks, and the Flames bursting from her Eyes. 'I am ashamed, says she, my Lord, of the Reception which you have met with. I assure your Lordship we are all sensible of the Honor done us; and I must tell you, Miss Western, the Family expect a different Behavior from you.' Here my Lord interfered on Behalf of the young Lady, but to no Purpose; the Aunt proceeded till Sophia pulled out her Handkerchief, threw herself into a Chair, and burst into a violent Fit of Tears.  The Remainder of the Conversation between Mrs. Western and his Lordship, till the latter withdrew, consisted of bitter Lamentations on his Side, and on hers of the strongest Assurances that her Neice should and would consent to all he wished. 'Indeed, my Lord, says she, the Girl has had a foolish Education, neither adapted to her Fortune nor her Family. Her Father, I am sorry to say it, is to blame for every Thing. The Girl has silly Country Notions of Bashfulness. Nothing else, my Lord, upon my Honor; I am convinced she has a good Understanding at the Bottom, and will be brought to Reason.'  This last Speech was made in the Absence of Sophia, for she had sometime before left the Room with more Appearance of Passion than she had ever shown on any Occasion; and now his Lordship, after many Expressions of Thanks to Mrs. Western, many ardent Professions of Passion which nothing could conquer, and many Assurances of Perseverance which Mrs. Western highly encouraged, took his Leave for this Time.  Before we relate what now passed between Mrs. Western and Sophia, it may be proper to mention an unfortunate Accident which had happened, and which had occasioned the Return of Mrs. Western with so much Fury as we have seen.  The Reader then must know, that the Maid who at present attended on Sophia, was recommended by Lady Bellaston, with whom she had lived for some Time in the Capacity of a Comb-brush; she was a very sensible Girl, and had received the strictest Instructions to watch her young Lady very carefully. These Instructions, we are sorry to say, were communicated to her by Mrs. Honor, into whose Favor Lady Bellaston had now so ingratiated herself, that the violent Affection which the good Waiting Woman had formerly borne to Sophia, was entirely obliterated by that great Attachment which she had to her new Mistress.  Now when Mrs. Miller was departed, Betty (for that was the Name of the Girl) returning to her young Lady, found her very attentively engaged in reading a long Letter, and the visible Emotions which she betrayed on that Occasion, might have well accounted for some Suspicions which the Girl entertained; but indeed they had yet a stronger Foundation, for she had overheard the whole Scene which passed between Sophia and Mrs. Miller.  Mrs. Western was acquainted with all this Matter by Betty, who, after receiving many Commendations, and some Rewards for her Fidelity, was ordered, that if the Woman who brought the Letter, came again, she should introduce her to Mrs. Western herself.  Unluckily Mrs. Miller returned at the very time when Sophia was engaged with his Lordship. Betty, according to Order, sent her directly to the Aunt; who being Mistress of so many Circumstances relating to what had past the Day before, easily imposed upon the poor Woman to believe that Sophia had communicated the whole Affair; and so pumped everything out of her which she knew, relating to the Letter, and relating to Jones.  This poor Creature might indeed be called Simplicity itself. She was one of that Order of Mortals, who are apt to believe every thing which is said to them; to whom Nature has neither indulged the offensive nor defensive Weapons of Deceit, and who are consequently liable to be imposed upon by any one, who will only be at the Expense of a little Falsehood for that Purpose. Mrs. Western having drained Mrs. Miller of all she knew, which indeed was but little, but which was sufficient to make the Aunt suspect a great deal, dismissed her, with Assurances that Sophia would not see her, that she would send no Answer to the Letter, nor ever receive another ^ nor did she suffer her to depart, without a handsome Lecture on the Merits of an Office, to which she could afford no better Name than that of Procuress. --  This discovery had greatly discomposed her Temper, when coming into the Apartment, next to tha^ in which the Lovers were, she overheard Sophia very warmly protesting against his Lordship's Addresses. At which the Rage already kindled, burst forth, and she rushed in upon her Niece in a furious Manner, as we have already described, together with what past a^ that time till his Lordship's Departure.  No sooner was Lord Fellamar gone, than Mrs. Western returned to Sophia, whom she upbraided i^ the most bitter Terms, for the ill Use she had made of the Confidence reposed in her; and for her Treachery in Conversing with a Man, with whom she had offered but the Day before to bind herself in the most solemn Oath, never more to have any Conversation. Sophia protested she had maintained no such Conversation. 'How! Miss Western,' said the Aunt, 'will you deny your receiving a Letter from him yesterday?' 'A Letter, Madam,' answered Sophia, somewhat surprised. 'It is not very well bred, Miss, replies the Aunt, to repeat my Words. I say a Letter, and I insist upon your showing it me immediately.' 'I scorn a Lie, Madam,' said Sophia, I did receive a Letter, but it was without my Desire, and indeed I may say against my Consent.' 'Indeed, indeed, Miss,' cries the Aunt, 'you ought to be ashamed of owning you had received it at all; but where is the Letter? for I will see it.'  To this peremptory Demand Sophia paused some Time before she returned an Answer; and at last only excused herself by declaring she had not the Letter in her Pocket, which was indeed true; upon which her Aunt losing all manner of Patience, asked her Neice this short Question, whether she would resolve to marry Lord Fellamar or no? to which she received the strongest Negative. Mrs. Western then replied with an Oath, or something very like one, that she would early the next Morning deliver her back into her Father's Hands.  Sophia then began to reason with her Aunt in the following manner; 'Why, Madam, must I of Necessity be forced to marry at all? consider how cruel you would have thought it in your own Case, and how much kinder your Parents were in leaving you to your Liberty. What have I done to forfeit this Liberty? I will never marry contrary to my Father's Consent, nor without asking yours, -- And when I ask the Consent of either improperly it will be then time enough to force some other marriage upon me.' 'Can I bear to hear this,' cries Mrs. Western, 'from a Girl, who has now a Letter from a Murderer in her Pocket?' 'I have no such Letter, I promise you,' answered Sophia; 'and if he be a Murderer, he will soon be in no Condition to give you any further Disturbance.' ' 'How Miss Western,' said the Aunt, 'have you the Assurance to speak of him in this Manner, to own your Affection for such a Villain to my Face!' 'Sure, Madam,' said Sophia, 'you put a very strange Construction on my Words.' 'Indeed, Miss Western,' cries the Lady, 'I shall not bear this Usage; you have learnt of your Father this Manner of treating me; he has taught you to give me the Lie. He has totally ruined you by his false System of Education; and please Heaven he shall have the Comfort of its Fruits: For once more I declare to you, that tomorrow Morning I will carry you back. I will withdraw all my Forces from the Field, and remain henceforth, like the wise King of Prussia, in a State of perfect Neutrality. You are both too wise to be regulated by my Measures; so prepare yourself, for tomorrow Morning you shall evacuate this House.'  Sophia remonstrated all she could; but her Aunt was deaf to all she said. In this Resolution therefore we must at present leave her, as there seems to be no Hopes of bringing her to change it.  CHAP. IX. What happened to Mr. Jones in the Prison. MR. Jones past above twenty-four melancholy Hours by himself, unless when relieved by the Company of Partridge, before Mr. Nightingale returned; not that this worthy young Man had deserted or forgot his Friend; for indeed, he had been much the greatest part of the time employed in his Service.  He had heard upon Enquiry that the only Persons who had seen the Beginning of the unfortunate Rencounter, were a Crew belonging to a Man of War, which then lay at Deptford. To Deptford therefore he went, in search of this Crew, where he was informed that the Men he sought after were all gone ashore. He then traced them from Place to Place, till at last he found two of them drinking together, with a third Person, at a Hedge-Tavern, near Aldersgate.  Nightingale desired to speak with Jones by himself (for Partridge was in the Room when he came in.) As soon as they were alone, Nightingale taking Jones by the Hand, cried, 'Come, my brave Friend, be not too much dejected at what I am going to tell you, I am sorry I am the Messenger of bad News.' 'I guess already what that News is,' cries Jones. 'The poor Gentleman then is dead.' -- 'I hope not,' answered Nightingale. 'He was alive this Morning; though I will not flatter you; I fear from the Accounts I could get, that his Wound is mortal. But if the Affair be exactly as you told it, your own Remorse would be all you would have reason to apprehend, let what would happen; but forgive me, my dear Tom, if I entreat you to make the worst of your Story to your Friends. If you disguise any thing to us, you will only be an an Enemy to yourself.'  'What Reason, my dear Jack, have I ever given you,' said Jones, 'to stab me with so cruel a Suspicion?' 'Have Patience,' cries Nightingale, and I will tell you all. After the most diligent Enquiry, I could make, I at last met with two of the Fellows who were present at this unhappy Accident, and I am sorry to say, they do not relate the Story so much in your Favor, as you yourself have told it.' 'Why, what do they say?' cries Jones. 'Indeed, what I am sorry to repeat, as I am afraid o^ the Consequence of it to you. They say that they were at too great a Distance to overhear any Word^ that passed between you; but they both agree tha^ the first Blow was given by you.' 'Then upon my Soul,' answered Jones, 'they injure me. He no^ only struck me first, but struck me without the leas^ Provocation. What should induce those Villains to accuse me falsely?' 'Nay, that I cannot guess,' said Nightingale, 'and if you yourself, and I who am so heartily your Friend, cannot conceive a Reason why they should beli^ you, what Reason will an in different Court of Justice be able to assign why they should not believe them? I repeated the Question to them several times, and so did another Gentleman who was present, who, I believe, is a sea-farin^ Man, and who really acted a very friendly part b^ you; for he begged them often to consider, tha^ there was the Life of a Man in the Case; and aske^ them over and over if they were certain; to which they both answered, that they were, and would abid^ by their Evidence upon Oath. For Heaven's Sake my dear Friend, recollect yourself; for if this should appear to be the Fact, it will be your Business to think in time of making the best of your Interest. ^ would not shock you; but you know, I believe the Severity of the Law, whatever verbal Provocations may have been given you.' 'Alas! my Friend, cries Jones, 'what Interest has such a Wretch as I Besides, do you think I would even wish to liv^ with the Reputation of a Murderer? If I had an^ Friends, (as alas! I have none) could I have the Confidence to solicit them to speak in the Behalf o^ a Man condemned for the blackest Crime in Human Nature? Believe me I have no such Hope; but have some Reliance on a Throne still greatly superior; which will, I am certain, afford me all the Pro+ tection I merit.' He then concluded with many ^lemn and vehement Protestations of the Truth of what he had at first asserted.  The Faith of Nightingale was now again staggered, and began to incline to credit his Friend, when Mrs. Miller appeared, and made a sorrowful Report of the ^uccess of her Embassy; which when Jones had heard, ^e cried out most heroically, 'Well, my Friend, I am now indifferent as to what shall happen, at least with Regard to my Life; and if it be the Will of Heaven that I shall make an Atonement with that for the Blood I have spilt, I hope the Divine Goodness will one Day suffer my Honor to be cleared, and that the Words of a dying Man, at least, will be believed, so far as to justify his Character.'  A very mournful Scene now past between the Pri^ner and his Friends, at which, as few Readers would ^ave been pleased to be present, so few, I believe, will ^esire to hear it particularly related. We will, there^^re, pass on to the Entrance of the Turnkey, who ac^uainted Jones, that there was a Lady without who ^esired to speak with him, when he was at Leisure.  Jones declared his Surprise at this Message. He said, he knew no Lady in the World whom he could possibly expect to see there. However, as he saw ^o Reason to decline seeing any Person, Mrs. Miller and Mr. Nightingale presently took their Leave, and he gave Orders to have the Lady admitted.  If Jones was surprised at the News of a Visit from Lady, how greatly was he astonished when he discovered this Lady to be no other than Mrs. Waters. ^ this Astonishment then we shall leave him awhile, ^ order to cure the Surprise of the Reader, who will ^^kewise, probably, not a little wonder at the Arrival ^f this Lady.  Who this Mr. Waters was, the Reader pretty well ^ows; what she was he must be perfectly satisfied. He will therefore be pleased to remember, that thi^ Lady departed from Upton in the same Coach with Mr. Fitzpatrick and the other Irish Gentleman, an^ in their Company traveled to the Bath.  Now there was a certain Office in the Gift of M^ Fitzpatrick at that Time vacant, namely, that of Wife; for the Lady who had lately filled that Offic^ had resigned, or at least deserted her Duty. Mr. Fitzpatrick therefore having thoroughly examined Mrs. Waters on the Road, found her extremely fit for thi^ Place, which, on their Arrival at Bath, he presentl^ conferred upon her, and she, without any Scruple accepted. As Husband and Wife this Gentleman and Lady continued together all the Time they stayed a Bath, and as Husband and Wife they arrived together in Town.  Whether Mr. Fitzpatrick was so wise a Man a not to part with one good Thing till he had secure another, which he had at present only a Prospect of regaining; or whether Mrs. Waters had so well discharged her Office, that he intended still to retain he as Principal, and to make his Wife (as is often the Case) only her Deputy, I will not say; but certain is he never mentioned his Wife to her, never communicated to her the Letter given him by Mrs. Western nor ever once hinted his Purpose of re-possessing h^^ Wife; much less did he ever mention the Name o^ Jones. For though he intended to fight with him wherever he met him, he did not imitate those prudent Persons who think a Wife, a Mother, a Siste^ or sometimes a whole Family, the safest Seconds o^ these Occasions. The first Account therefore which she had of all this, was delivered to her from his Lip^ after he was brought hime from the Tavern where h^ Wound had been dressed.  As Mr. Fitzpatrick however had not the cleare^ Way of telling a Story at any Time, and was now perhaps a little more confused than usual, it was some Time before she discovered, that the Gentleman who ^ad given him this Wound was the very same Person from whom her Heart had received a Wound, which, though not of a mortal Kind, was yet so deep that it ^ad left a considerable Scar behind it. But no sooner was she acquainted that Mr. Jones himself was the Man who had been committed to the Gatehouse for ^his supposed Murder, than she took the first Opportunity of committing Mr. Fitzpatrick to the Care of ^is Nurse, and hastened away to visit the Conqueror.  She now entered the Room with an Air of Gayety, which received an immediate Check from the melancholy Aspect of poor Jones, who started and blessed himself when he saw her. Upon which she said, 'Nay, I do not wonder at your Surprise; I believe you did not expect to see me; for few Gentlemen are troubled here with Visits from any Lady, unless a Wife. You see the Power you have over me, Mr. Jones. Indeed I little thought when we parted at Upton, that our next Meeting would have been in such a Place.' 'Indeed, Madam,' says Jones, 'I must look upon this Visit as kind; few will follow the Miserable, especially to such dismal Habitations.' 'I protest Mr. Jones, 'says she, I can hardly persuade myself you are the same agreeable Fellow I saw at Upton. Why, your Face is more miserable than any Dungeon in the Universe. What can be the Matter with you?' 'I thought, Madam,' said Jones, as you knew of my being here, you knew the unhappy Reason.' 'Pugh,' says she, you have pinked a Man in a Duel, that is all.' Jones expressed some Indignation at this Levity, and spoke with the utmost Contrition for what had happened. To which she answered, 'Well then, Sir, if you take it so much to Heart, I will relieve you; the Gentleman is not dead: and, I am pretty confident, is in no Danger of dying. The Surgeon indeed who first dressed him was a young Fellow, and seeme^ desirous of representing his Case to be as bad as possible, that he might have the more Honor from curing him; but the King's Surgeon has seen him since, and says, unless from a Fever, of which ther^ are at present no Symptoms, he apprehends not the least Danger of Life.' Jones showed great Satisfaction in his Countenance at this Report; upon which she affirmed the Truth of it, adding, 'By the mo^^ extraordinary Accident in the World I lodge at the same House, and have seen the Gentleman; and promise you he does you Justice, and says, What ever be the Consequence, that he was entirely the Aggressor, and that you was not in the least t^ blame.'  Jones expressed the utmost Satisfaction at the Account which Mrs. Waters brought him. He the informed her of many Things which she well knew before, as who Mr. Fitzpatrick was, the Occasion o^ his Resentment, etc. He likewise told her sever^ Facts of which she was ignorant, as the Adventure ^^ the Muff, and other Particulars, concealing only the Name of Sophia. He then lamented the Follies an^ Vices of which he had been guilty; every one of which he said, had been attended with such ill Consequence^ that he should be unpardonoble if he did not take Wan^ing, and quit those vicious Courses for the future. H^ lastly concluded with assuring her of his Resolution ^^ sin no more, lest a worse Thing should happen to him.  Mrs. Waters with great Pleasantry ridiculed all thi^ as the Effects of low Spirits and confinement. She repeated some Witticisms about the Devil when ^^ was sick, and told him, 'She doubted not but shortl^ to see him at Liberty, and as lively a Fellow as eve^ and then,' says she, 'I don't question but your Conscience will be safely delivered of all these Qual^ that it is now so sick in breeding.'  Many more Things of this Kind she uttered, some of which it would do her no great Honor, in the Opinion of some Readers, to remember; nor are we quite certain but that the Answers made by Jones would be treated with Ridicule by others. We shall therefore suppress the rest of this Conversation, and only observe, that it ended at last with perfect Innocence, and much more to the Satisfaction of Jones than of the Lady: For the former was greatly transported with the News she had brought him; but the ^atter was not altogether so pleased with the penitential Behavior of a Man whom she had at first Interview conceived a very different Opinion of from what she ^ow entertained of him.  Thus the Melancholy occasioned by the Report of Mr. Nightingale was pretty well effaced; but the De^ection into which Mrs. Miller had thrown him still continued. The Account she gave, so well tallied with the Words of Sophia herself in her Letter, that he made not the least Doubt but that she had disclosed his Letter to her Aunt, and had taken a fixed Resolution to abandon him. The Torments this Thought gave ^im were to be equalled only by a Piece of News which Fortune yet had in Store for him, and which we shall communicate in the second Chapter of the ensuing Book.  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING. BOOK XVIII. Containing about Six Days. CHAP. I. A Farewell to the Reader. WE are now, Reader, arrived at the last Stage of our long Journey. As we have therefore traveled together through so many Pages let us behave to one another like Fellow Traveller in a Stage-Coach, who have passed several Day^ in the Company of each other; and who, notwithstanding any Bickerings or litttle Animositie^ which may have occurred on the Road, generally make all up at last, and mount, for the last Time, in to their Vehicle with Cheerfulness and Good Humor since, after this one Stage, it may possibly happen to us, as it commonly happens to them, never to meet more.  As I have here taken up this Simile, give me Leave to carry it a little farther. I intend then in this last Book to imitate the good Company I have mentioned in their last Journey. Now it is well known, that all Jokes and Raillery are at this Time laid aside; whatever Characters any of the Passengers have for the lest sake personated on the Road, are now thrown off, and the Conversation is usually plain and serious.  In the same Manner, if I have now and then, in the Course of this Work, indulged any Pleasantry for ^^y entertainment, I shall here lay it down. The Variety of Matter, indeed, which I shall be obliged to ^^am into this Book, will afford no room for any of those ludicrous Observations which I have elsewhere made, and which may sometimes, perhaps, have prevented thee from taking a Nap when it was beginning to steal upon thee. In this last Book thou will find ^^thing (or at most very little) of that Nature. All will be plain Narrative only; and, indeed, when thou ^^st perused the many great Events which this Book will produce, thou will think the Number of Pages contained in it scarce sufficient to tell the Story.  And now, my Friend, I take this Opportunity (as I shall have no other) of heartily wishing thee well. If I have been an entertaining Companion to thee, I promise thee it is what I have desired. If in any Thing I have offended, it was really without any In^ention. Some Things perhaps here said, may have ^^t thee or thy Friends; but I do most solemnly declare they were not pointed at them. I question not ^ut thou have been told, among other Stories of me, that thou wast to travel with a very scurrilous Fellow: But whoever told thee so, did me an Injury. No Plan detests and despises Scurrility more than myself; ^or has any Man more Reason; for none has ever been treated with more: And what is a very seven Fate, I have had some of the abusive Writings of those very Men fathered upon me, who in other of their Works have abused me themselves with the utmost Virulence.  All these Works, however, I am well convinced will be dead long before this Page shall offer itself to thy Perusal: For however short the Period may be o^ my own Performances, they will most probably out live their own infirm Author, and the weakly Productions of his abusive Cotemporaries.  CHAP. II. Containing a very tragical Incident. WHILE Jones was employed in these unpleasant Meditations, with which we left him tormenting himself, Partridge came stumbling into the Room with his Face paler than Ashes, his Eyes fixe^ in his Head, his Hair standing an End, and ever^ Limb trembling. In short, he looked as he would have done had he seen a Spectre, or had he indeed been a Spectre himself.  Jones, who was little subject to Fear, could not avoid being somewhat shocked at this sudden Appearance. He did indeed himself change Color, and h^^ Voice a little faultered, while he asked him what w^^ the Matter.  'I hope, Sir,' said Partridge, 'you will not ^^ angry with me. Indeed I did not listen, but I w^^ obliged to stay in the outward Room. I am sure wish I had been a hundred Miles off, rather tha^ have heard what I have heard.' 'Why what is the Matter?' said Jones. 'The Matter, Sir? O god Heaven!' answered Partridge, 'was that Wom^^ who is just gone out, the Woman who was wi^^ you at Upton?' 'She was, Partridge,' cries Jones 'And did you really, Sir, go to bed with that W^ man?' said he trembling. -- 'I am afraid what past between us is no Secret,' said Jones. -- 'Nay, but pray, Sir, for Heaven's Sake, Sir, answer me,' cries Partridge, 'You know I did,' cries Jones. -- 'Why then the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul, and forgive you,' cries Partridge; 'but as sure as I stand here alive, you have been a-Bed with your own Mother.'  Upon these Words, Jones became in a Moment a greater Picture of Horror than Partridge himself. He was indeed, for some Time, struck dumb with Amazement, and both stood staring wildly at each other. At last his Words found Way, and in an interrupted Voice he said -- 'How! how! What Is this you tell me?' 'Nay, Sir,' cries Partridge, 'I have not Breath enough left to tell you now -- but what I have said is most certainly true -- That Woman who now went out is your own Mother. How unlucky was it for you, Sir, that I did not happen to see her at that Time, to have prevented it? Sure the Devil himself must have contrived to bring about this Wickedness.'  'Sure,' cries Jones, 'Fortune will never have done with me, 'till she has driven me to Distraction. But why do I blame Fortune? I am myself the Cause of all my Misery. All the dreadful Mischiefs which have befallen me, are the Consequences only of my own Folly and Vice. What thou have told me, Partridge, has almost deprived me of my Senses. And was Mrs. Waters then -- But why do I ask? for thou must certainly know her. -- If thou have any Affection for me; nay, if thou have any Pity, let me beseech thee to fetch this miserable Woman back again to me. O good Heavens! Incest -- with a Mother! To what am I reserved?' He then sell into the most violent and frantic Agonies of Grief and Despair, in which Partridge declared he would not leave him: But at last having vented the first Torrent of Passion, he came a little to himself; and then having acquainted Partridge that he would find this wretched Woman in the same House where the wounded Gentleman was lodged, he dispatched him in ques^ of her.  If the Reader will please to refresh his Memory by turning to the Scene at Upton in the ninth Book, he will be apt to admire the many strange Accident which unfortunately prevented any Interview between Partridge and Mrs. Waters, when she spent a whol^ Day there with Mr. Jones. Instances of this Kin^ we may frequently observe in Life, where the greatest Events are produced by a nice Train of little Circumstances; and more than one Example of this may be discovered by the accurate Eye, in this our History.  After a fruitless Search of two or three Hours Partridge returned back to his Master, without having seen Mrs. Waters. Jones, who was in a Stat^ of Desperation at his Delay, was almost raving man when he brought him this Account. He was no^ long however in this Condition before he receive the following Letter.  Sir, Since I left you, I have seen a Gentleman, from whom I have learned something concerning yo^ which greatly Surprises and affects me; but as I have not at present Leisure to communicate a Matter ^^ such high Importance, you must suspend your Curiosity 'till our next Meeting, which shall be the first Moment I am able to see you. O Mr. Jones, litt^^ did I think, when I past that happy Day at Upton the Reflection upon which is like to embitter all m^ future Life, who it was to whom I owed such perfect Happiness. Believe me to be ever sincere^ your unfortunate  J. Waters* P. S. I would have you comfort yourself as much as possible, for Mr. Fitzpatrick is in no manner of Danger; so that whatever other grievous Crimes you may have to repent of, the Guilt of Blood is not among the Number.     Jones having received the Letter, let it drop (for he was unable to hold it, and indeed had scarce the Use of any one of his Faculties) Partridge took it up, and having received Consent by Silence, read it likewise; nor had it upon him a less sensible Effect. The Pencil, and not the Pen, should describe the Horrors which appeared in both their Countenances. While they both remained speechless, the Turnkey entered the Room, and without taking any Notice of what sufficiently discovered itself in the Faces of them both, acquainted Jones that a Man without desired to speak with him. This Person was presently introduced, and was no other than Black George.  As Sights of Horror were not so usual to George as they were to the Turnkey, he instantly saw the great Disorder which appeared in the Face of Jones. This he imputed to the Accident that happened, which was reported in the very worst Light in Mr. Western's Family; he concluded therefore that the Gentleman was dead, and that Mr. Jones was in a fair Way of coming to a shameful End. A Thought which gave him much Uneasiness; for George was of a compassionate Disposition, and notwithstanding a small Breach of Friendship which he had been over-tempted to commit, was, in the main, not insensible of the Obligations he had formerly received from Mr. Jones.  The poor Fellow therefore scarce refrained from a Tear at the present Sight. He told Jones he was heartily sorry for his Misfortunes, and begged him to consider if he could be of any manner of Service 'Perhaps, Sir, said he, you may want a little Matter of Money upon this Occasion; if you do, Sir what little I have is heartily at your Service.'  Jones shook him very heartily by the Hand, and gave him many Thanks for the Kind Offer he had made; but answered, 'He had not the least Wan^ of that Kind.' Upon which George began to press his Services more eagerly than before. Jones again thanked him, with Assurances that he wanted nothing which was in the Power of any Man living to give. 'Come, come, my good Master, answered George, do not take the Matter so much to Heart Things may end better than you imagine; to be sure you ant the first Gentleman who has killed a Man, and yet come off.' 'You are wide of the Matter, George, said Partridge, the Gentleman is not dead, nor like to die. Don't disturb my Master at present, for he is troubled about a Matter in which it is not in your Power to do him any good.' 'You don't know what I may be able to do, Mr. Partridge, answered George; if his Concern is about my young Lady, I have some News to tell my Master.' -- 'What do you say, Mr. George?' cried Jones, has any thing lately happened in which my Sophia is concerned? My Sophia! How dares such a Wretch as I mention her so profanely.' -- 'I hope she will be yours yet, 'answered George. -- 'Why, yes, Sir, I have something to tell you about her. Madam Western has just brought Madam Sophia home, and there has been a terrible to do. I could not possibly learn the very Right of it; but my Master he has been in a vast big Passion, and so was Madam Western, and I heard her say as she went out of Doors into her Chair, that she would never set her Foot in Master's House again. I don't know what is the Matter, not I, but every thing was very quiet when I came out; but Robin, who waited at Supper, said he had never seen the Squire for a long while in such good Humor with young Madam; that he kissed her several Times, and swore she should be her own Mistress, and he never would think of confining her any more. I thought this News would please you, and so I slipped out, though it was so late, to inform you of it.' Mr. Jones assured George that it did greatly please him; for though he should never more presume to lift his Eyes toward that incomparable Creature, nothing could so much relieve his Misery as the Satisfaction he should always have in hearing of her Welfare.  The rest of the Conversation which passed at the Visit is not important enough to be here related. The Reader will therefore forgive us this abrupt breaking off, and be pleased to hear how this great good Will of the Squire toward his Daughter was brought about.  Mrs. Western, on her first Arrival at her Brother's Lodging, began to set forth the great Honors and Advantages which would accrue to the Family by the Match with Lord Fellamar, which her Neice had absolutely refused; in which Refusal, when the Squire took the Part of his Daughter, she fell immediately into the most violent Passion, and so irritated and provoked the Squire, that neither his Patience nor his Prudence could bear any longer; upon which there ensued between them both so warm a Bout at Altercation, that perhaps the Regions of Billingsgate never equalled it. In the Heat of this Scolding Mrs. Western departed, and had consequently no Leisure to acquaint the Brother with the Letter which Sophia received, which might have possibly produced ill Effects; but to say the Truth I believe it never once occurred to her Memory at this Time.  When Mrs. Western was gone, Sophia, who had been hitherto silent, as well indeed from Necessity as Inclination, began to return the Compliment which her Father had made her, in taking her part against her Aunt, by taking his likewise against the Lady. This was the first Time of her so doing, and it was in the highest Degree acceptable to the Squire. Again he remembered that Mr. Allworthy had insisted on an entire Relinquishment of all violent Means; and indeed as he made no doubt but that Jones would be hanged he did not in the least question succeeding with his Daughter by fair Means; he now therefore once more gave a Loose to his natural Fondness for her, which had such an Effect on the Dutiful, grateful, tender and Affectionate Heart of Sophia, that had her Honor given to Jones, and something else perhaps in which he was concerned, been removed, I much doubt whether she would not have sacrificed herself to a Man she did not like, to have obliged her Father. She promised him she would make it the whole Business of her Life to oblige him, and would never marry any Man against his Consent; which brought the old Man so near to his highest Happiness, that he was resolved to take the other Step, and went to Bed completely drunk.  CHAP. III. Allworthy visits old Nightingale; with a strange Discovery that he made on that Occasion. THE Morning after these Things had happened, Mr. Allworthy went according to his Promise to visit old Nightingale, with whom his Authority was so great, that after having sat with him three Hours, he at last prevailed with him to consent to see his Son.  Here an Accident happened of a very extraordinary Kind; one indeed of those strange Chances, whence very good and grave Men have concluded that Providence often interposes in the Discovery of the most secret Villainy, in order to caution Men from quitting the Paths of Honesty, however warily they tread in those of Vice.  Mr. Allworthy, at his Entrance into Mr. Nightingale's, saw black George; he took no Notice of him, nor did Black George imagine he had perceived him. However, when their Conversation on the principal Point was over, Allworthy asked Nightingale whether he knew one George Seagrim, and upon what Business he came to his House. 'Yes, answered Nightingale, I know him very well, and a most extraordinary Fellow he is, who in these Days, has been able to hoard up 500l. from renting a very small Estate of 30l. a Year.' 'And is this the Story he has told you? cries Allworthy.' 'Nay, it is true, I promise you,' said Nightingale, 'for I have the Money now in my Hands, in five Bank Bills, which I am to lay out either in a Mortgage, or in some Purchase in the North of England.' The Bank Bills were no sooner produced at Allworthy's Desire, than he blessed himself at the Strangeness of the Discovery. He presently told Nightingale that these Bank Bills were formerly his, and then acquainted him with the whole Affair. As there are no Men who complain more of the Frauds of Business than Highwaymen, Gamesters, and other Thieves of that Kind; so there are none who so bitterly exclaim against the Frauds of Gamesters, etc. as Usurers, Brokers, and other Thieves of this Kind; whether it be that the one Way of cheating is a Discountenance or Reflection upon the other, or that Money, which is the common Mistress of all Cheats, makes them regard each other in the Light of Rivals; but Nightingale no sooner heard the Story, than he exclaimed against the Fellow in Terms much severer than the Justice and Honesty of Allworthy had bestowed on him.  Allworthy desired Nightingale to retain both the Money and the Secret till he should hear farther from him; and if he should in the mean Time see the Fellow, that he would not take the least Notice to him of the Discovery which he had made. He then returned to his Lodgings, where he found Mrs. Miller in a very dejected Condition, on Account of the Information she had received from her Son-in-law. Mr. Allworthy, with great Cheerfulness, told her that he had much good News to communicate; and with little further Preface, acquainted her, that he had brought Mr. Nightingale to consent to see his Son, and did not in the least doubt to effect a perfect Reconciliation between them; though he found the Father more sowered by another Accident of the same Kind, which had happened in his Family. He then mentioned the running away of the Uncle's Daughter, which he had been told by the old Gentleman, and which Mrs. Miller, and her Son-in-law, did not yet know.  The Reader may suppose Mrs. Miller received this Account with great Thankfulness and no less Pleasure; but so uncommon was her Friendship to Jones, that I am not certain whether the Uneasiness she suffered for his Sake, did not overbalance her Satisfaction at hearing a Piece of News tending so much to the Happiness of her own Family; nor whether even this very News, as it reminded her of the Obligations she had to Jones, did not hurt as well as please her; when her grateful Heart said to her, 'While my own Family is happy, how miserable is the poor Creature, to whose Generosity we owe the Beginning of all this Happiness.'  Allworthy having left her a little while to chew the Cud (if I may use that Expression) on these first Tidings, told her, he had still something more to impart, which he believed would give her Pleasure. 'I think said he, I have discovered a pretty considerable Treasure belonging to the young Gentleman, your Friend; but perhaps indeed, his present Situation may be such, that it will be of no Service to him.' The latter Part of the Speech gave Mrs. Miller to understand who was meant, and she answered with a Sigh, 'I hope not, Sir.' 'I hope so too' cries Allworthy, 'with all my Heart, but my Nephew told me this Morning, he had heard a very bad Account of the Affair.' -- 'Good Heaven! Sir,' said she -- Well, I must not speak, and yet it is certainly very hard to be obliged to hold one's Tongue when one hears' -- 'Madam, said Allworthy, you may say whatever you please, you know me too well to think I have a Prejudice against any one; and as for that young Man, I assure you I should be heartily pleased to find he could acquit himself of every thing, and particularly of this sad Affair. You can testify the Affection I have formerly borne him. The World, I know, censured me for loving him so much. I did not withdraw that Affection from him without thinking I had the justest Cause. Believe me, Mrs. Miller, I should be glad to find I have been mistaken.' Mrs. Miller was going eagerly to reply, when a Servant acquainted her, that a Gentleman without desired to speak with her immediately. Allworthy then enquired for his Nephew, and was told, that he had been for some Time in his Room with the Gentleman who used to come to him, and whom Mr. Allworthy, guessing rightly to be Mr. Dowling, he desired presently to speak with him.  When Dowling attended, Allworthy put the Case of the Bank-Notes to him, without mentioning any Name, and asked in what manner such a Person might be punished. To which Dowling answered, he thought he might be indicted on the Black Act; but said, as it was a Matter of some Nicety, it would be proper to go to Council. He said he was to attend Council presently upon an Affair of Mr. Western's, and if Mr. Allworthy pleased he would lay the Case before them. This was agreed to; and then Mrs. Miller opening the Door, cried, 'I ask pardon, I did not know you had Company;' but Allworthy desired her to come in, saying, he had finished his Business. Upon which Mr. Dowling withdrew, and Mrs. Miller introduced Mr. Nightingale the younger, to return thanks for the great Kindness done him by Allworthy; but she had scarce Patience to let the young Gentleman finish his Speech before she interrupted him, saying, 'O Sir, Mr. Nightingale, brings great News about poor Mr. Jones, he has been to see the wounded Gentleman, who is out of all Danger of Death, and what is more, declares he fell upon poor Mr. Jones himself, and beat him. I am sure, Sir, you would not have Mr. Jones be a Coward. If I was a Man myself, I am sure if any Man was to strike me, I should draw my Sword. Do pray, my Dear, tell Mr. Allworthy, tell him all yourself.' Nightingale then confirmed what Mrs. Miller had said; and concluded with many handsome Things of Jones, who was, he said, one of the best-natured Fellows in the World, and not in the least inclined to be quarrelsome. Here Nightingale was going to cease, when Mrs. Miller again begged him to related all the many dutiful Expressions he had heard him make use of toward Mr. Allworthy. 'To say the utmost Good of Mr. Allworthy, cries Nightingale, is doing no more than strict Justice, and can have no Merits in it; but indeed I must say, no Man can be more sensible of the Obligations he has to so good a^ Man, than is poor Jones. Indeed, Sir, I am convinced the Weight of your Displeasure is the heaviest Burden he lies under. He has often lamented it to me, and has as often protested in the most solemn Manner he had never been intentionally guilty of any Offense toward you; nay, he has sworn he would rather die a Thousand Deaths than he would have his Conscience upbraid him with one disrespectful, ungrateful, or undutiful Thought toward you. But I ask pardon, Sir, I am afraid I presume to intermeddle too far in so tender a Point.' 'You have spoke no more than what a Christian ought, cries Mrs. Miller.' 'Indeed, Mr. Nightingale, answered Allworthy, 'I applaud your generous Friendship, and I wish he may merit it of you. I confess I am glad to hear the Report you bring from this unfortunate Gentleman; and if that Matter should turn out to be as you represent it (and indeed I doubt nothing of what you say) I may perhaps, in Time, be brought to think better than lately I have of this young Man: For this good Gentle woman here, nay all who know me, can witness that I loved him as dearly as if he had been my own Son. Indeed I have considered him as a Child sent by Fortune to my Care. I still remember the innocent, the helpless Situation in which I found him. I feel the tender Pressure of his little Hands at this Moment. -- He was my Darling, indeed he was.' At which Words he ceased, and the Tears stood in his Eyes.  As the Answer which Mrs. Miller made may lead us into fresh Matters, we will here stop to account for the visible Alteration in Mr. Allworthy's Mind, and the Abatement of his Anger to Jones. Revolutions of this Kind, it is true, do frequently occur in Histories and dramatic Writers, for no other Reason than because the History or Play draws to a Conclusion, and are justified by Authority of Authors; yet though we insist upon as much Authority as any Author whatever, we shall use this Power very sparingly, and never but when we are driven to it by Necessity, which we do not at present foresee will happen in this Work.  This Alteration then in the Mind of Mr. Allworthy, was occasioned by a Letter he had just received from Mr. Square, and which we shall give the Reader in the Beginning of the next Chapter.  CHAP. IV. Containing two Letters in very different Styles. My worthy Friend, I informed you in my last, that I was forbidden the Use of the Waters, as they were found by Experience rather to increase than lessen the Symptoms of my Distemper. I must now acquaint you with a Piece of News, which, I believe, will afflict my Friends more than it has afflicted me. Dr. Harrington and Dr. Brewster, have informed me, that there is no Hopes of my Recovery.  I have somewhere read, that the great Use of Philosophy is to learn to die. I will not therefore so far disgrace mine, as to show any Surprise at receiving a Lesson which I must be thought to have so long studied. Yet, to say the Truth, one Page of the Gospel teaches this Lesson better than all the Volumes of ancient or modern Philosophers. The Assurance it gives us of another Life is a much stronger support to a good Mind, than all the Consolations that are drawn from the Necessity of Nature, the Emptiness or Satiety of our Enjoyments here, or any other Topic of those Declamations which are sometimes capable of arming our Minds with a stubborn Patience in bearing the Thoughts of Death; but never of raising them to a real Contempt of it, and much less of making us think it a real Good. I would not here be understood to throw the horrid Censure of Atheism, or even the absolute Denial of Immortality, on all who are called Philosophers. Many of that Sect, as well ancient as modern, have, from the Light of Reason, discovered some Hopes of a future State; but, in Reality, that Light was so faint and glimmering, and the Hopes were so uncertain and precarious, that it may be justly doubted on which Side their Belief turned. Plato himself conludes his Phaedon, with declaring that his best Arguments amount only to raise a Probability, and Cicero himself seems rather to profess an Inclination to believe, than any actual Belief in the Doctrines of Immortality. As to myself to be very sincere with you, I never was much in earnest in this Faith, till I was in earnest a Christian.  You will perhaps wonder at the latter Expression; but I assure you it has not been till very lately, that I could, with Truth, call myself so. The Pride of Philosophy had intoxicated my Reason, and the sublimest of all Wisdom appeared to me, as it did to the Greeks of old, to be Foolishness. God has however been so gracious to show me my Error in Time, and to bring me into the Way of Truth, before I sunk into utter Darkness for ever.  I find myself beginning to grow very weak, I shall therefore hasten to the main Purpose of this Letter.  When I reflect on the Actions of my past Life, I know of nothing which sits heavier upon my Conscience, than the Injustice I have been guilty of to that poor Wretch, your adopted Son. I have not indeed only connived at the Villainy of others, but been myself active in Injustice toward him. Believe me, my dear Friend, when I tell you on the Word of a dying Man, he has been basely injured. As to the principal Fact, upon the Misrepresentation of which you discarded him, I solemnly assure you he is innocent. When you lay upon your supposed Deathbed, he was the only Person in the House who testified any real Concern; and what happened afterward arose from the Wildness of his Joy on your Recovery; and, I am sorry to say it, from the Baseness of another Person (but it is my Desire to justify the Innocent, and to accuse none). Believe me, my Friend, this young Man has the noblest Generosity of Heart, the most perfect Capacity for Friendship, the highest Integrity, and indeed every Virtue which can ennoble a Man. He has some Faults, but among them is not to be numbered the least want of Duty or Gratitude toward you. On the contrary I am satisfied when you dismissed him from your House, his Heart bled for you more than for himself.  Worldly Motives were the wicked and base Reasons of my concealing this from you so long; to reveal it now I can have no Inducement but the Desire of serving the Cause of Truth, of doing Right to the Innocent, and of making all the Amends in my Power for a past Offense. I hope this Declaration therefore will have the Effect desired, and will restore this deserving young Man to your Favor; the hearing of which while I am yet alive will afford the utmost Consolation to,  Sir, Your most obliged, Obedient humble Servant, Thomas Square.   The Reader will, after this, scarce wonder at the Revolution so visibly appearing in Mr. Allworthy, notwithstanding he received from Thwackum, by the same Post, another Letter of a very different Kind, which we shall here add, as it may possibly be the last Time we shall have occasion to mention the Name of that Gentleman.  Sir, I am not at all surprised at hearing from your worthy Nephew a fresh Instance of the Villainy of Mr. Square the Atheist's young Pupil. I shall not wonder at any Murders he may commit; and I heartily pray that your own Blood may not seal up his final Commitment to the Place of Wailing and gnashing of Teeth.  Though you cannot want sufficient Calls to Repentance for the many unwarrantable Weaknesses exemplified in your Behavior to this Wretch, so much to the Prejudice of your own lawful Family, and of your Character. I say, though these may sufficiently be supposed to prick and goad your Conscience at this Season; I should yet be wanting to my Duty, if I spared to give you some Admonition in order to bring you to a due Sense of your Errors. I therefore pray you seriously to consider the Judgment which is likely to overtake this wicked Villain; and let it serve at least as a Warning to you, that you may not for the future despise the Advice of one who is indefatigable in his Prayers for your Welfare.  Had not my Hand been withheld from due Correction, I had scourged much of this diabolical Spirit out of a Boy, of whom from his Infancy I discovered the Devil had taken such entire Possession; but Reflections of this Kind now come too late.  I am sorry you have given away the Living of Westerton so hastily. I should have applied on that Occasion earlier, had I thought you would not have acquainted me previous to the Disposition. -- Your Objection to Pluralities is being righteous overmuch. If there were any Crime in the Practice, so many godly Men would not agree to it. If the Vicar of Aldergrove should die (as we hear he is in a declining Way) I hope you will think of me, since I am certain you must be convinced of my most sincere Attachment to your highest Welfare. A Welfare to which all worldly Considerations are as trifling as the small Tithes mentioned in Scripture are, when compared to the weighty Matters of the Law.  I am, Sir, Your faithful humble Servant, Roger Thwackum.   This was the first Time that Thwackum eve^ wrote in this authoritative Style to Allworthy, and of this he had afterward sufficient Reason to repent, as in the Case of those who mistake the highest Degree of Goodness for the lowest Degree o^ Weakness. Allworthy had indeed never liked thi^ Man. He knew him to be proud and ill-natured he also knew that his Divinity itself was tincture with his Temper, and such as in many Respects h^ himself did by no means approve: But he was at the same Time an excellent Scholar, and most indefatigable in teaching the two Lads. Add to this the strict Severity of his Life and Manners, an unimpeached Honesty, and a most devout Attachment to Religion. So that upon the whole, though Allworthy did not esteem nor love the Man, yet he could never bring himself to part with a Tutor to the Boys, wh^ was both by Learning and Industry, extremely we^^ qualified for his Office; and he hoped, that as they were bred up in his own House, and under his own Eye, he should be able to correct whatever was wrong in Thwackum's Instructions.  CHAP. V. In which the History is continued. MR. Allworthy, in his last Speech, had recollecte^ some tender Ideas concerning Jones, which had brought Tears into the good Man's Eyes. Thi^ Mrs. Miller observing, said, 'Yes, yes, Sir, your Goodness to this poor young Man is known notwithstanding all your Care to conceal it; but there is not a single Syllable of Truth in what those Villains said. Mr. Nightingale has now discovered the whole Matter. It seems these Fellows were employed by a Lord, who is a Rival of poor Mr. Jones, to have pressed him on board a Ship. -- I assure them I don't know who they will press next. Mr. Nightingale here has seen the Officer himself, who is a very pretty Gentleman, and has told him all, and is very sorry for what he undertook, which he would never have done had he known Mr. Jones to have been a Gentleman; but he was told that he was a common strolling Vagabond.'  Allworthy stared at all this, and declared he was a Stranger to every Word she said. 'Yes, Sir,' answered she, 'I believe you are. -- It is a very different Story, I believe, from what those Fellows told the Lawyer.'  'What Lawyer, Madam? what is it you mean?' said Allworthy. 'Nay, nay,' said she, 'this is so like you to deny your own Goodness; but Mr. Nightingale here saw him,' 'Saw whom, Madam?' answered he. 'Why your Lawyer, Sir,' said she, 'that you so kindly sent to enquire into the Affair.' 'I am still in the Dark, upon my Honor,' said Allworthy. 'Why then do you tell him, my dear Sir,' cries she. 'Indeed, Sir,' said Nightingale, 'I did see that very Lawyer who went from you when I came into the Room, at an Alehouse in Aldersgate, in Company with two of the Fellows who were employed by Lord Fellamar to press Mr. Jones, and who were by that Means present at the unhappy Rencounter between him and Mr. Fitzpatrick.' 'I own, Sir,' said Mrs. Miller, 'when I saw this Gentleman come into the Room to you, I told Mr. Nightingale that I apprehended you had sent him thither to enquire into the Affair.' Allworthy showed Marks of Astonishment in his Countenance at this News, and was indeed for two or three Minutes struck dumb by it. At last, addressing himself to Mr. Nightingale, he said, 'I must confess myself, Sir, more surprised at what you tell me, than I have ever been before at any Thing in my whole Life. Are you certain this was the Gentleman?' 'I am most certain,' answered Nightingale. 'At Aldersgate?' cries Allworthy. 'And was you in Company with this Lawyer and the two Fellows?' -- 'I was, Sir,' said the other, 'very near half an Hour.' -- 'Well, Sir,' said Allworthy, 'and in what Manner did the Lawyer behave? Did you hear all that past between him and the Fellows?' 'No, Sir, answered Nightingale, 'they had been together before I came -- In my Presence the Lawyer said little; but after I had several Times examined the Fellows, who persisted in a Story directly contrary to what I had heard from Mr. Jones, and what I find by Mr. Fitzpatrick was a rank Falsehood, the Lawyer then desired the Fellows to say nothing but what was the Truth, and seemed to speak so much in Favor of Mr. Jones, that when I saw the same Person with you, I concluded your Goodness had prompted you to send him thither. -- 'And did you not send him thither?' says Mrs Miller. -- ' 'Indeed I did not,' answered Allworthy; 'nor did I know he had gone on such an Errand 'till this Moment.' -- 'I see it all!' said Mrs. Miller: 'Upon my Soul, I see it all! No wonder they have been closetted so close lately. Son Nightingale, let me beg you run for these Fellows immediately -- find them out if they are above Ground. I will go myself.' -- 'Dear Madam,' said Allworthy, 'be patient, and do me the Favor to send a Servant up Stairs to call Mr. Dowling hither, if he be in the House, or if not, Mr. Blifil.' Mrs. Miller went out muttering something to herself, and presently returned with an Answer. 'That Mr. Dowling was gone; but that the the other, as she called him, was coming.'  Allworthy was of a cooler Disposition than the good Woman, whose Spirits were all up in Arms in the Cause of her Friend. He was not however without some Suspicions which were near akin to hers. When Blifil came into the Room, he asked him with a very serious Countenance, and with a less friendly Look than he had ever before given him, 'Whether he knew any Thing of Mr. Dowling's having seen any of the Persons who were present at the Duel between Jones and another Gentleman?'  There is nothing so dangerous as a Question which comes by Surprise on a Man, whose Business it is to conceal Truth, or defend Falsehood. For which Reason those worthy Personages, whose noble Office it is to save the Lives of their Fellow Creatures at the Old Bailey, take the utmost Care, by frequent previous Examination, to divine every Question which may be asked their Clients on the Day of Trial, that they may be supplied with proper and ready Answers, which the most fertile Invention cannot supply in an Instant. Besides, the sudden and violent Impulse on the Blood, occasioned by these Surprises, occasions frequently such an Alteration in the Countenance, that the Man is obliged to give Evidence against himself. And such indeed were the Alterations which the Countenance of Blifil underwent from this sudden Question, that we can scarce blame the Eagerness of Mrs. Miller, who immediately cried out, 'Guilty, upon my Honor! Guilty, upon my Soul!'  Mr. Allworthy sharply rebuked her for this Impetuosity; and then turning to Blifil, who seemed sinking into the Earth, he said, 'Why do you hesitate, Sir, at giving me an Answer? You certainly must have employed him, for he would not, of his own Accord, I believe, have undertaken such an Errand, and especially without acquainting me.'  Blifil then answered, 'I own, Sir, I have been guilty of an Offense, yet may I hope your Pardon?' -- 'My Pardon?' said Allworthy very angrily. -- 'Nay, Sir,' answered Blifil, 'I knew you would be offended; yet surely my dear Uncle will forgive the Effects of the most amiable of Human Weaknesses. Compassion for those who do not deserve it, I own, is a Crime; and yet it is a Crime from which you yourself are not entirely free. I know I have been guilty of it in more than one Instance to this very Person; and I will own I did send Mr. Dowling, not on a vain and fruitless Enquiry, but to discover the Witnesses, and to endeavor to soften their Evidence. This, Sir, is the Truth; which though I intended to conceal from you, I will not deny.'  'I confess,' said Nightingale, 'this is the Light in which it appeared to me from the Gentleman's Behavior.'  'Now, Madam,' said Allworthy, 'I believe you will once in your Life own you have entertained a wrong Suspicion, and are not so angry with my Nephew as you was.'  Mrs. Miller was silent; for though she could not so hastily be pleased with Blifil, whom she looked upon to have been the Ruin of Jones, yet in this particular Instance he had imposed upon her as well as the rest; so entirely had the Devil stood his Friend. And, indeed, I look upon the vulgar Observation, That the Devil often deserts his Friends, and leaves them in the Lurch, to be a great Abuse on that Gentleman's Character. Perhaps he may sometimes desert those who are only his Cup Acquaintance; or who, at most, are but half his; but he generally stands by those who are thoroughly his Servants, and helps them off in all Extremities 'till their Bargain expires.  As a conquered Rebellion strengthens a Government, or as Health is more perfectly established by Recovery from some Diseases; so Anger, when removed, often gives new Life to Affection. This was the Case of Mr. Allworthy; for Blifil having wiped off the greater Suspicion, the lesser, which had been raised by Square's Letter, sunk of Course, and was forgotten; and Thwackum, with whom he was greatly offended, bore alone all the Reflections which Square had cast on the Enemies of Jones.  As for that young Man, the Resentment of Mr. Allworthy began more and more to abate toward him. He told Blifil, 'he did not only forgive the extraordinary Efforts of his Goodnature, but would give him the Pleasure of following his Example.' Then turning to Mrs. Miller, with a Smile which would have become an Angel, he cried, 'What say you, Madam; shall we take a Hackney-Coach, and all of us together pay a Visit to your Friend? I promise you it is not the first Visit I have made in a Prison.'  Every Reader, I believe, will be able to answer for the worthy Woman; but they must have a great deal of Goodnature, and be well acquainted with Friendship, who can feel what she felt on this Occasion. Few, I hope, are capable of feeling what now past in the Mind of Blifil; but those who are, will acknowledge, that it was impossible for him to raise any Objection to this Visit. Fortune, however, or the Gentleman lately mentioned above, stood his Friend, and prevented his undergoing so great a Shock: For at the very Instant when the Coach was sent for, Partridge arrived, and having called Mrs. Miller from the Company, acquainted her with the dreadful Accident lately come to Light; and hearing Mr. Allworthy's Intention, begged her to find some Means of stopping him; for says he, 'the Matter must at all Hazards be kept a Secret from him; and if he should now go, he will find Mr. Jones and his Mother, who arrived just as I left him, lamenting over one another the horrid Crime they have ignorantly committed.'  The poor Woman, who was almost deprived of her Senses at this dreadful News, was never less capable of Invention than at present. However, as Women are much readier at this than Men, she bethought herself of an Excuse, and returning to Allworthy said, 'I am sure, Sir, you will be surprised at hearing any Objection from me to the kind Proposal you just now made; and yet I am afraid of the Consequence of it, if carried immediately into Execution. You must imagine, Sir, that all the Calamities which have lately befallen this poor young Fellow, must have thrown him into the lowest Dejection of Spirits: And now, Sir, should we all on a sudden fling him into such a violent Fit of Joy, as I know your Presence will occasion, it may, I am afraid, produce some fatal Mischief, especially as his Servant who is without, tells me he is very far from being well.'  'Is his Servant without?' cries Allworthy; 'pray call him hither. I will ask him some Questions concerning his Master.'  Partridge was at first afraid to appear before Mr. Allworthy; but was at length persuaded, after Mrs. Miller, who had often heard his whole Story from his own Mouth, had promised to introduce him.  Allworthy recollected Partridge the Moment he came into the Room, though many Years had passed since he had seen him. Mrs. Miller therefore might have spared here a formal Oration, in which indeed she was somewhat prolix: For the Reader, I believe, may have observed already that the good Woman, among other Things, had a Tongue always ready for ^he Service of her Friends.  'And are you,' said Allworthy to Partridge, 'the Servant of Mr. Jones?'' 'I cannot say, Sir,' answered he, 'that I am regularly a Servant, but I live with him, an't please your Honor, at present. Non sum qualis eram, as your Honor very well knows.'  Mr. Allworthy then asked him many Questions concerning Jones, as to his Health and other Matters; to all which Partridge answered, without having the least Regard to what was, but considered only what he would have Things appear; for a strict Adherence to Truth was not among the Articles of this honest Fellow's Morality or his Religion.  During this Dialogue Mr. Nightingale took his ^eave, and presently after Mrs. Miller lest the Room, then Allworthy likewise dispatched Blifil; for he ima^ined that Partridge, when alone with him, would be ^ore explicit than before Company. They were no ^oner left in private together, than Allworthy began ^ in the following Chapter.  CHAP. VI. In which the History is farther continued. 'SURE, Friend,' said the good Man, 'you are the strangest of all Human Beings. Not only to have suffered as you have formerly, for obstinately persisting in a Falsehood; but to persist in it thus to the last, and to pass thus upon the World for the Servant of your own Son? What Interest can you have in all this? What can be your Motive?'  'I see, Sir,' said Partridge, falling down upon ^s Knees, 'that your Honor is prepossessed against me, and resolved not to believe any Thing I say, and therefore what signifies my Protestations; but yet there is one above who knows that I am not the Father of this young Man.'  'How!' said Allworthy, 'Will you yet deny what you was formerly convicted of upon such unanswerable, such manifest Evidence? Nay, what a Confirmation is your being now found with this very Man, of all which twenty Years ago appeared against you. I thought you had left the Country; nay, I thought you had been long since dead. -- In what Manner did you know any Thing of this young Man? Where did you meet with him, unless you had kept some Correspondence together. Do not deny this; for I promise you it will greatly raise your Son in my Opinion, to find that he has such a Sense of filial Duty, as privately to support his Father for so many Years.'  'If your Honor will have Patience to hear me,' said Partridge, 'I will tell you all.' -- Being bid go on, he proceeded thus: 'When your Honor conceived that Displeasure against me, it ended in my Ruin soon after; for I lost my little School; and the Minister, thinking I suppose it would be agreeable to your Honor, turned me out from the Office of Clerk; so that I had nothing to trust to but the Barber's Shop, which, in a Country Place like that, is a poor Livelihood; and when my Wife died, (for 'till that Time I received a Pension of 12 l. a Year from an unknown Hand, which indeed I believe was your Honor's own, for no Body that ever I heard of does these Things besides) but as I was saying, when she died, this Pension forsook me; so that now as I owed two or three small Debts, which began to be troublesome to me, (particulary one This is a Fact which I knew happen to a poor Clergyman in Dorsetshire, by the Villainy of an Attorney, who not contented with the exorbitant Costs to which the poor Man was put by a single Action, brought afterward another Action on the Judgment, as it is called. A Method frequently used to oppress the poor, and bring Money into the Pockets of Attorneys, to the great Scandal of the Law of the Nation, of Christianity, and even of Human Nature itself. which an Attorney brought up by Law-charges from 15s. to near 30l.) and as I found all my usual Means of living had forsook me, I packed up my little All as well as I could, and went off.'  'The first Place I came to was Salisbury, where I got into the Service of a Gentleman belonging to the Law, and one of the best Gentlemen that ever I knew; for he was not only good to me, but I know a thousand good and charitable Acts which he did while I staid with him; and I have known him often refuse Business because it was paultry and oppressive.' -- 'You need not be so particular,' said Allworthy; 'I know this Gentleman, and a very worthy Man he is, and an Honor to his Profession.' -- 'Well, Sir,' continued Partridge, 'from hence I removed to Lymmington, where I was above three Years in the Service of another Lawyer, who was likewise a very good Sort of a Man, and to be sure one of the merriest Gentlemen in England. Well, Sir, at the End of the three Years I set up a little School, and was likely to do well again, had it not been for a most unlucky Accident. Here I kept a Pig; and one Day, as ill Fortune would have it, this Pig broke out, and did a Trespass I think they call it, in a Garden belonging to one of my Neighbors, who was a proud, revengeful Man, and employed a Lawyer, one -- one -- I cannot think of his Name; but he sent for a writ against me, and had me to Size. When I came there, Lord have Mercy upon me -- to hear what the Counselor said. There was one that told my Lord a Parcel of the confoundedst Lies about me; he said, that I used to drive my Hogs into other Folks Gardens, and a great deal more; and at last he said, He hoped I had at last brought my Hogs to a fair Market. To be sure, one would have thought, that instead of being Owner only of one poor little Pig, I had been the greatest Hog-Merchant in England. Well' -- 'Pray,' said Allworthy, do not be so particular. I have heard nothing of your Son yet.' 'O it was a great many Years,' answered Partridge, before I saw my Son, as you are pleased to call him -- I went over to Ireland after this, and taught School at Cork, (for that one Suit ruined me again, and I lay seven Years in Winchester Goal.)' -- 'Well,' said Allworthy, 'pass that over till your Return to England. -- 'Then, Sir,' said he, 'it was about half a Year ago that I landed at Bristol, where I stayed some Time, and not finding it do there, and hearing of a Place between that and Gloucester, where the Barber was just dead, I went thither, and there I had been about two Months, when Mr. Jones came thither.' He then gave Allworthy a very particular Account of their first Meeting, and of every Thing as well as he could remember, which had happened from that Day to this, frequently interlarding his Story with Panegyricks on Jones, and not forgetting to insinuate the great Love and Respect which he had for Allworthy. He concluded with saying, 'Now, Sir, I have told your Honor the whole Truth:' And then repeated a most solemn Protestation, 'That he was no more the Father of Jones then of the Pope of Rome, and imprecated the most birt^ C^^ses on his Head if he did not speak Truth.  'What am I to think of this Ma^ter?' cries Allworthy 'For what Purpose should you so strongly (...) it would be rather your Interest to own?' -- 'Nay, Sir', answered Partridge, (for he could hold no longer) 'if your Honor will not believe me, you are like soon to have satisfaction enough. I wish you had mistaken the Mother of this young Man, as well as you have his Father.' -- And now being asked what he meant, with all the Symptoms of Horror both in his Voice and Countenance, he told Allworthy the whole Story, which he had a little before expressed such Desire to Mrs. Miller to conceal from him.  Allworthy was almost as much shocked at this Discovery as Partridge himself had been while he related it. 'Good Heavens!' says he, 'in what miserable Distresses do Vice and Imprudence involve Men! How much beyond our Designs are the Effects of Wickedness sometimes carrried!' He had scarce uttered these Words, when Mrs. Waters came hastily and abruptly into the Room. Partridge no sooner saw her, than he cried, 'Here, Sir, here is the very Woman herself. This is the unfortunate Mother of Mr. Jones; I am sure she will acquit me before your Honor. -- Pray, Madam -- '  Mrs. Waters, without paying any Regard to what Partridge said, and almost without taking any Notice of him, advanced to Mr. Allworthy. 'I believe, Sir, It is so long since I had the Honor of seeing you, that you do not recollect me.' -- 'Indeed,' answered Allworthy, 'you are so very much altered, on many Accounts, that had not this Man already acquainted me who you are, I should not have immediately called you to my Remembrance. Have you, Madam any particular Business which brings you to me?' -- Allworthy spoke this with great Reserve; for the Reader may easily believe he was not well pleased with the Conduct of this Lady; neither with what he had formerly heard, nor with what Partridge had now delivered.  Mrs. Waters answered, -- 'Indeed, Sir, I have very particular Business with you; and it is such as I can only impart to yourself. -- I must desire therefore the Favor of a Word with you alone; for I assure you what I have to tell you is of the utmost Importance.'  Partridge was then ordered to withdraw, but before he went, he begged the Lady to satisfy Mr. Allworthy that he was perfectly innocent. To which she answered -- 'You need be under no Apprehension, Sir, I shall satisfy Mr. Allworthy very perfectly of that Matter.'  Then Partridge withdrew, and that past between Mr. Allworthy and Mrs. Waters which is written in the next Chapter.  CHAP. VII. Continuation of the History. MRS. Waters remaining a few Moments silent, Mr. Allworthy could not refrain from saying, 'I am sorry, Madam, to perceive by what I have since heard, that you have made so very ill a Use' -- 'Mr. Allworthy,' says she, interrupting him, 'I know I have Faults, but Ingratitude to you is not one of them. I never can nor shall forget your Goodness, which I own I have very little deserved; but be pleased to wave all Upbraiding me at present, as I have so important an Affair to communicate to you concerning this young Man, to whom you have given my Maiden Name of Jones.' 'Have I then,' said Allworthy, 'ignorantly punished an innocent Man in the Person of him who has just left us? was he not the Father of the Child?' -- 'Indeed he was not,' said Mrs. Waters. 'You may be pleased to remember, Sir, I formerly told you, you should one Day know; and I acknowledge myself to have been guilty of a cruel Neglect, in not having discovered it to you before. -- Indeed I little knew how necessary it was.' -- 'Well, Madam,' said Allworthy, 'be pleased to proceed.' 'You must remember, Sir,' said she, 'a young Fellow, whose Name was Summer.' 'Very well,' cries Allworthy, 'he was the Son of a Clergyman of great Learning and Virtue, for whom I had the highest Friendship.' 'So it appeared, Sir,' answered she; 'for I believe you bred the young Man up, and maintained him at the University; where, I think, he had finished his Studies, when he came to reside at your House; a finer Man, I must say, the Sun never shone upon; for, besides the handsomest Person I ever saw, he was so genteel, and had so much Wit and good Breeding.' 'Poor Gentleman,' said Allworthy, 'he was indeed untimely snatched away; and little did I think he had any Sins of this kind to answer for; for I plainly perceive, you are going to tell me he was the Father of your Child' 'Indeed, Sir,' answered she, he was not.' 'How?' said Allworthy, 'to what then tends all this Preface?' 'to a Story, Sir,' said she, 'which I am concerned it falls to my Lot to unfold to you. -- O, Sir, prepare to hear something which will Surprise you, will grieve you.' 'Speak,' said Allworthy, 'I am conscious of no Crime, and cannot be afraid to hear.' -- 'Sir, said she, that Mr. Summer, the Son of your Friend, educated at your Expense, who, after living a Year in the House as if he had been your own Son, died there of the small Pox, was tenderly lamented by you, and buried as if he had been your own; that Summer, Sir, was the Father of this Child.' -- 'How!' said Allworthy, 'you contradict yourself.' -- 'That I do not,' answered she, 'he was indeed the father of this Child but not by me.' 'Take care Madam,' said Allworthy, 'do not to shun the Imputation of any Crime be guilty of Falsehood. Remember there is one from whom you can conceal nothing, and before whose Tribunal Falsehood will only aggravate your Guilt.' 'Indeed, Sir,' says she, 'I am not his Mother; nor would I now think myself so for the World.' 'I know your Reason,' said Allworthy, 'and shall rejoice as much as you to find it otherwise; yet you must remember, you yourself confessed it before me.' -- 'So far what I confessed,' said she, 'was true, that these Hands coveyed the Infant to your Bed, conveyed it thither at the Command of its Mother; at her Commands I afterward owned it, and thought myself by her Generosity nobly rewarded, both for my Secrecy and my Shame.' 'Who could this Woman be?' said Allworthy. -- 'Indeed I tremble to Name her,' answered Mrs. Waters. 'By all this Preparation I am to guess that she was a Relation of mine,' cried he. 'Indeed she was a near one.' At which Words Allworthy started, and she continued. -- 'You had a Sister, Sir.' -- 'A Sister!' repeated he, looking aghast. -- 'As there is Truth in Heaven,' cries she, 'your Sister was the Mother of that Child you found between your Sheets.' 'Can it be possible,' cries he, 'good Heavens!' 'Have Patience, Sir,' said Mrs. Waters, 'and I will unfold to you the whole Story. Just after your Departure for London, Miss Bridget came one Day to the House of my Mother. She was pleased to say she had heard an extraordinary Character of me for my Learning and superior Understanding to all the young Women there, so she was pleased to say. She then bid me come to her to the great House, where when I attended, she employed me to read to her. She expressed great Satisfaction in my reading, showed great Kindness to me, and made me many Presents. At last she began to catechize me on the Subject of Secrecy, to which I gave her such satisfactory Answers, that at last having locked the Door of her Room, she took me into her Closet, and then locking that Door likewise, she said she should convince me of the vast Reliance she had on my Integrity, by communicating a Secret in which her Honor and consequently her Life was concerned. She then stopped, and after a Silence of a Minute, during which she often wiped her Eyes, she enquired of me, if I thought my Mother might safely be confided in. I answered I would stake my Life on her Fidelity. She then imparted to me the great Secret which labored in her Breast, and which, I believe, was delivered with more Pains than she afterward suffered in Childbirth. It was then contrived, that my Mother and myself only should attend at the Time, and that Mrs. Wilkins should be sent out of the Way, as she accordingly was to the very furthest Part of Dorsetshire to enquire the Character of a Servant; for the Lady had turned away her own Maid near three Months before, during all which Time I officiated about her Person, upon Trial as she said, though, as she afterward declared, I was not sufficiently handy for the Place. This and many other such Things which she used to say of me, were all thrown out to prevent any Suspicion which Wilkins might hereafter have when I was to own the Child; for she thought it could never be believed she would venture to hurt a young Woman with whom she had entrusted such a Secret. You may be assured, Sir, I was well paid for all these Affronts, which, together with being informed of the Occasion of them, very well contented me. Indeed the Lady had a greater Suspicion of Mrs. Wilkins than of any other Person; not that she had the least Aversion to the Gentlewoman, but she thought her incapable of keeping a Secret, especially from you, Sir: For I have often heard Miss Bridget say, that if Mrs. Wilkins, had committed a Murder, she believed she would acquaint you with it. At last the expected Day came, and Mrs. Wilkins, who had been kept a Week in Readiness, and put off from Time to Time, upon some Pretense or other, that she might not return too soon, was dispatched. Then the Child was born in the Presence only of myself and my Mother, and was by my Mother conveyed to her own House, where it was privately kept by her till the Evening of your Return, when I, by the Command of Miss Bridget conveyed it into the Bed where you found it.' And all Suspicions were afterward laid asleep by the artful Conduct of your Sister, in pretending Ill Will to the Boy, and that any Regard she showed him was out of mere Complaisance to you.' Mrs. Waters then made many Protestations of the Truth of this Story, and concluded by saying, 'Thus, Sir, you have at last discovered your Nephew, for so I am sure you will hereafter think him, and I question not but he will be both an Honor and a Comfort to you under that Appellation.' 'I need not Madam, said Allworthy, express my Astonishment at what you have told me; and yet surely you would not, and could not, have put together so many Circumstances to evidence an Untruth. I confess, I recollect some Passages relating to that Summer, which formerly gave me a Conceit that my Sister had some Liking to him. I mentioned it to her: For I had such a Regard to the young Man, as well on his own account, as on his Father's, that I should have willingly consented to a Match between them; but she expressed the highest Disdain of my unkind Suspicion, as she called it, so that I never more spoke on the Subject. Good Heaven! well, the Lord disposes all Things. -- Yet sure it was a most unjustifiable Conduct in my Sister to carry this Secret with her out of the World.' 'I promise you, Sir,' said Mrs. Waters, always professed a contrary Intention, and frequently told me she intended one Day to communicate it to you. She said indeed, she was highly rejoiced that her Plot had succeeded so well, and that you had of your own accord taken such a Fancy to the Child, that it was yet unnecessary to make any express Declaration. Oh! Sir, had that Lady lived to have seen this poor young Man turned like a Vagabond from your House; nay, Sir, could she have lived to hear that you had yourself employed a Lawyer to prosecute him for a Murder of which he was not guilty -- Forgive me, Mr. Allworthy, I must say it was unkind. -- Indeed you have been abused, he never deserved it of you.' 'Indeed, Madam,' said Alworthy, 'I have been abused by the Person whoever he was that told you so.' 'Nay, Sir,' said she, 'I would not be mistaken, I did not presume to say you were guilty of any wrong. The Gentleman who came to me, proposed no such Matter: He only said, taking me for Mr. Fitzpatrick's Wife, that if Mr. Jones had murdered my Husband, I should be assisted with any Money I wanted to carry on the Prosecution, by a very worthy Gentleman, who, he said, was well apprized what a Villain I had to deal with. It was by this Man I found out who Mr. Jones was; and this Man, whose Name is Dowling, Mr. Jones tells me, is your Steward. I discovered his Name by a very odd Accident, for he himself refused to tell it me; but Partridge, who met him at my Lodgings the second Time he came, knew him formerly at Salisbury.'  'And did this Mr. Dowling,' says Allworthy, with great Astonishment in his Countenance, 'tell you that I would assist in the Prosecution?' -- 'No, Sir', answered she, 'I will not charge him wrongfully. He said, I should be assisted, but he mentioned no Name. -- Yet you must pardon me, Sir, if from Circumstances I thought it could be no other.' -- 'Indeed, Madam', says Allworthy, 'from Circumstances I am too well convinced it was another. -- Good Heaven, by what wonderful Means is the blackest and deepest Villainy sometimes discovered! -- Shall I beg you, Madam, to stay till the Person you have mentioned comes, for I expect him every Minute; nay, he may be perhaps already in the House.' Allworthy then stepped to the Door, in order to call a Servant, when in came, not Mr. Dowling, but the Gentleman who will be seen in the next Chapter.  CHAP. VIII. Further Continuation. THE Gentleman who now arrived was no other than Mr. Western. He no sooner saw Allworthy, than without considering in the least the Presence of Mrs. Waters, he began to vociferate in the following Manner. 'Fine Doings at my House! A rare Kettle of Fish I have discovered at last; who the Devil would be plagued with a Daughter?' 'What's the Matter, Neighbor, said Allworthy,' 'Matter enough, answered Western, when I thought she was a just coming to, nay, when she had in a Manner promised me to do as I would ha her, and when I was a hoped to have had nothing more to do than to have a sent for the Lawyer and finished all. What do you think I have found out? that the little B -- has bin playing Tricks with me all the while, and carrying on a Correspondence with that Bastard of yours. Sister Western, whom I have a quarrelled with upon her Account, sent me Word o't, and I ordered her Pockets to be searched when she was asleep, and here I have got un signed with the Son of a Whore's own Name. I have not had Patience to read half o't, for it is longer than one of Parson Supple's Sermons; but I find plainly it is all about Love, and indeed what should it be else? I have packed her up in Chamber again, and Tomorrow Morning down she goes into the Country, unless she confents to be married directly, and there she shall live in a Garret upon Bread and Water all her Days; and the sooner such a B -- breaks her Heart the better, though d -- n her, that I believe is too tough. She will live long enough to plague me.' 'Mr. Western, answered Allworthy, you know I have always protested against Force, and you yourself consented that none should be used.' 'Ay, cries, he, that was only upon Condition that she would consent without. What the Devil and Doctor Faustus, shall not I do what I will with my own Daughter, especially when I desire nothing but her own Good?' 'Well, Neighbor, answered Allworthy, if you will give me Leave, I will undertake once to argue with the young Lady.' 'Will you, said Western, why that is kind now and neighbourly, and mayhap you will do more than I have been able to do with her; for I promise you she has a very good Opinion of you.' 'Well, Sir, said Allworthy, if you will go Home and release the young Lady from her Captivity, I will wait upon her within this half Hour.' -- 'But suppose,' said Western, 'she should run away with un in the mean Time? for Lawyer Dowling tells me there is no Hopes of hanging the Fellow at last, for that the Man is alive, and like to do well, and that he thinks Jones will be out of Prison again presently.' -- 'How, said Allworthy, 'what did you employ him then to enquire or to do any Thing in that Matter?' 'Not I, answered Western, 'he mentioned it to me just now of his own Accord.' -- 'Just now!' cries Allworthy, 'why where did you see him then? I want much to see Mr. Dowling.' -- ' 'Why you may see un an you will presently at my Lodgings; for there is to be a Meeting of Lawyers there this Morning, about a Mortgage. -- Icod! I shall lose two or dree Thousand Pounds, I believe, by that honest Gentleman, Mr. Nightingale.' -- 'Well, Sir, said Allworthy, 'I will be with you within the half Hour.' 'And do for once, cries the Squire, take a Fool's Advice; never think of dealing with her by gentle Methods, take my Word for it, those will never do. I have tried um long enough. She must be frightened into it, there is no other Way. Tell her I Am her Father, and of the horrid Sin of Disobedience, and of the dreadful Punishment of it in the other World, and then tell her about being locked up all her Life in a Garret in this, and be kept only upon Bread and Water.' 'I will do all I can, said Allworthy, for I promise you there is nothing I wish more than an Alliance with this amiable Creature.' 'Nay, the Girl is well enough for Matter of that, cries the Squire, a Man may go farther and meet with worse Meat; that I may declare of her, thof she be my own Daughter. And if she will but be obedient to me, there is no'orow a Father within a hundred Miles of the Place that loves a Daughter better than I do; but I see you are busy with the Lady here, so I will go Huome and expect you, and so your humble Servant.'  As soon as Mr. Western was gone, Mrs. Waters said, 'I see, Sir, the Squire has not the least Remembrance of my Face. I believe, Mr. Allworthy, you would not have known me neither. I am very considerably altered since that Day when you so kindly gave me that Advice, which I had been happy had I followed.' -- 'Indeed, Madam, cries, Allworthy, 'it gave me great Concern when I first heard the contrary.' 'Indeed, Sir,' says she, 'I was ruined by a very deep Scheme of Villainy, which if you knew, though I pretend not to think it would justify me in your Opinion, it would atleast mitigate my Offense, and induce you to pity me; you are not now at Leisure to hear my whole Story; but this I assure you, I was betrayed by the most solemn Promise, of Marriage; nay in the Eye of Heaven I was married to him; for after much reading on the Subject, I am convinced that particular Ceremonies are only requisite to give a legal Sanction to Marriage, and have only a worldly Use in giving a Woman the Privileges of a Wife; but that she who lives constant to one Man, after a solemn private Affiance, whatever the World may call her, has little to charge on her own Conscience.' 'I am sorry, Madam,' said Allworthy, 'you made so ill an Use of your Learning. Indeed it would have been well that you had been possessed of much more, or had remained in a State of Ignorance. And yet, Madam, I am afraid you have more than this Sin to answer for.' 'During his Life, answered she, which was above a Dozen Years, I most solemnly assure you, I had not. And consider, Sir, on my Behalf, what is in the Power of a Woman stripped of her Reputation, and left destitute, whether the good-natured World will suffer such a stray Sheep to return to the Road of Virtue, even if she was never so desirous. I protest then I would have chose it had it been in my Power; but Necessity drove me into the Arms of Capt. Waters, with whom, though still unmarried, I lived as a Wife for many Years, and went by his Name. I parted with this Gentleman at Worcester, on his March against the Rebels, and it was then I accidentally met with Mr. Jones, who rescued me from the Hands of a Villain. Indeed he is the worthiest of Men. No young Gentleman of his Age is, I believe, freer from Vice, and few have the twentieth Part of his Virtues; nay, whatever Vices he has had, I am firmly persuaded he has now taken a Resolution to abandon them.' 'I hope he has, cries Allworthy, and I hope he will preserve that Resolution. I must say I have still the same Hopes with Regard to yourself. The World, I do agree, are apt to be too unmerciful on these Occasions, yet Time and Perseverance will get the better of this their Disinclination, as I may call it, to Pity, for though they are not, like Heaven ready to receive a penitent Sinner, yet a continued Repentance will at length obtain Mercy even with the World. This you may be assured of, Mrs. Waters, that whenever I find you are sincere in such good Intentions, you shall want no Assistance in my Power to make them effectual.'  Mrs. Waters fell now upon her Knees before him, and in a Flood of Tears made him many most passionate Acknowledgments of his Goodness, which, as she truly said, savoured more of the divine than human Nature.  Allworthy raised her up, and spoke in the most tender Manner, making use of every Expression which his Invention could suggest to comfort her, when he was interrupted by the Arrival of Mr. Dowling, who, upon his first Entrance, seeing Mrs. Waters, started, and appeared in some Confusion; from which he soon recovered himself as well as he could, and then said, he was in the utmost Haste to attend Council at Mr. Western's Lodgings; but however thought it his Duty to call and acquaint him with the Opinion of Council upon the Case which he had before told him, which was that the Conversion of the Moneys in that Case could not be questioned in a Criminal Cause, but that an Action of Trover might be brought, and if it appeared to the Jury to be the Moneys of Plaintiff, that Plaintiff would recover a Verdict for the Value.  Allworthy, without making any Answer to this, bolted the Door, and then advancing with a stern Look to Dowling, he said, 'Whatever be your Haste, Sir, I must first receive an Answer to some Questions. Do you know this young Lady?' -- 'That Lady, Sir?' answered Dowling with great Hesitation. Allworthy then, with the most solemn Voice, said, 'Look you, Mr. Dowling, as you value my Favor, or your Continuance a Moment longer in my Service, do not hesitate nor prevaricate; but answer faithfully and truly to every Question I ask. -- Do you know this Lady?' -- 'Yes, Sir, said Dowling, I have seen the Lady.' 'Where, Sir?' 'At her own Lodgings.' -- 'Upon what Business did you go thither, Sir, and who sent you?' 'I went, Sir, to enquire, Sir, about Mr. Jones.' 'And who sent you to enquire about him?' 'Who, Sir, why, Sir, Mr. Blifil sent me.' 'And what did you say to the Lady concerning that Matter?' 'Nay, Sir, it is impossible to recollect every Word.' 'Will you please, Madam, to assist the Gentleman's Memory?' 'He told me, Sir, said Mrs. Waters, that if Mr. Jones had murdered my Husband, I should be assisted by any Money I wanted to carry on the Prosecution, by a very worthy Gentleman, who was well apprized what a Villain I had to deal with. These I can safely swear were the very Words he spoke.' -- 'Were these the Words, Sir, said Allworthy?' 'I cannot charge my Memory exactly, cries Dowling, but I believe I did speak to that Purpose.' -- 'And did Mr. Blifil order you to say so?' 'I am sure, Sir, I should not have gone on my own Accord, nor have willingly exceeded my Authority in Matters of this Kind. If I said so, I must have so understood Mr. Blifil's Instructions.' 'Look you, Mr. Dowling, said Allworthy, I promise you before this Lady, that whatever you have done in this Affair by Mr. Blifil's Order, I will forgive, provided you now tell me strictly the Truth; for I believe what you say, that you would not have acted of your own Accord, and without Authority, in this Matter. -- Mr. Blifil then likewise sent you to examine the two Fellows at Aldersgate?' -- 'He did, Sir,' -- 'Well, and what Instructions did he then give you? Recollect as well as you can, and tell me, as near as possible, the very Words he used.' -- 'Why, Sir, Mr. Blifil sent me to find out the Persons who were Eyewitnesses of this Fight. He said he feared they might be tampered with by Mr. Jones, or some of his Friends. He said, Blood required Blood; and that not only all who concealed a Murderer, but those who omitted any Thing in their Power to bring him to Justice, were Sharers in his Guilt. He said, he found you was very desirous of having the Villain brought to Justice, though it was not proper you should appear in it.' -- 'Did he so? says Allworthy. -- 'Yes, Sir, cries Dowling, I should not, I am sure, have proceeded such Lengths for the sake of any other Person living but your Worship.' -- 'What Lengths, Sir, said Allworthy. -- 'Nay, Sir, cries Dowling, I would not have your Worship think I would, on any Account, be guilty of Subordination of Perjury; but there are two Ways of delivering Evidence. I told them therefore that if any Offers should be made them on the other Side, they should refuse them, and that they might be assured they should lose nothing by being honest Men, and telling the Truth. I said, we were told, that Mr. Jones had assaulted the Gentleman first, and that if that was the Truth, they should declare it; and I did give them some Hints that they should be no Losers.' -- 'I think you went Lengths indeed,' cries Allworthy. -- 'Nay, Sir', answered Dowling, 'I am sure I did not desire them to tell an Untruth, -- nor should I have said what I did, unless it had been to oblige you.' 'You would not have thought, I believe, says Allworthy, to have obliged me, had you known that this Mr. Jones was my own Nephew.' ' -- I am sure, Sir, answered he, it did not become me to take any Notice of what I thought you desired to conceal.' ' -- How, cries Allworthy, and did you know it then?' -- 'Nay Sir, answered Dowling, if your Worship bids me speak the Truth, I am sure I shall do it. -- Indeed, Sir, I did know it; for they were almost the last Words which Madam Blifil ever spoke, which she mentioned to me as I stood alone by her Bedside, when she delivered me the Letter I brought your Worship from her.' -- 'What Letter, cries Allworthy?' ' -- 'The Letter, Sir, answered Dowling, which I brought from Salisbury, and which I delivered into the Hands of Mr. Blifil.' -- ' 'O Heavens!' cries Allworthy, 'well, and what were the Words? What did my Sister say to you?' -- 'She took me by the Hand, answered he, and as she delivered me the Letter, said, I scarce know what I have written. Tell my Brother, Mr. Jones is his Nephew -- He is my Son -- Bless him, says she, and then fell backward, as if dying away. I presently called in the People, and she never spoke more to me, and died within a few Minutes afterward.' -- Allworthy stood a Minute silent, lifting up his Eyes, and then turning to Dowling, said, -- 'How came you, Sir, not to deliver me this Message?' 'Your Worship, answered he, must remember that you was at that Time ill in Bed; and being in a violent Hurry, as indeed I always am, I delivered the Letter and Message to Mr. Blifil, who told me he would carry them both to you, which he has since told me he did, and that your Worship, partly out of Friendship to Mr. Jones, and partly out of Regard to your Sister, would never have it mentioned; and did intend to conceal it from the World; and therefore, Sir, if you had not mentioned it to me first, I am certain I should never have thought it belonged to me to say any Thing of the Matter, either to your Worship, or any other Person.'  We have remarked somewhere already, that it is possible for a Man to convey a Lie in the Words of Truth; this was the Case at present: For Blifil, had in Fact told Dowling what he now related; but had not imposed upon him, nor indeed had imagined that he was able so to do. In Reality, the Promises which Blifil had made to Dowling, were the Motives which had induced him to Secrecy; and as he very plainly saw he should not be able to keep them, he thought proper now to make this Confession, which the Promises of Forgiveness, joined to the Threats, the Voice, the Looks of Allworthy, and the Discoveries he had made before, extorted from him, who was besides taken unawares, and had no Time to consider of Evasions.  Allworthy appeared well satisfied with this Relation, and having enjoined strict Silence as to what had past on Dowling, conducted that Gentleman himself to the Door, least he should see Blifil, who was returned to his Chamber, where he exulted in the Thoughts of his last Deceit on his Uncle, and little suspected what had since passed below Stairs.  As Allworthy was returning to his Room, he met Mrs. Miller in the Entry, who with a Face all pale and full of Terror, said to him, 'O! Sir, I find this wicked Woman has been with you, and you know all; yet do not on this Account abandon the poor young Man. Consider, Sir, he was ignorant it was his own Mother, and the Discovery itself will most probably break his Heart, without your Unkindness.' 'Madam, says Allworthy, I am under such an Astonishment at what I have heard, that I am really unable to satisfy you; but come with me into my Room. Indeed, Mrs. Miller, I have made surprising Discoveries, and you shall soon know them.'  The poor Woman followed him trembling; and now Allworthy going up to Mrs. Waters, took her by the Hand, and then turning to Mrs. Miller said, 'What Reward shall I bestow upon this poor Gentlewoman for the Services she has done me? -- O! Mrs. Miller, you have a Thousand Times heard me call the young Man to whom you are so faithful a Friend, my Son. Little did I then think he was indeed related to me at all. -- Your Friend, Madam, is my Nephew, he is the Brother of that wicked Viper which I so long nourished in my Bosom. -- She will herself tell you the whole Story, and how the Youth came to pass for her Son. Indeed, Mrs. Miller, I am convinced that he has been wronged, and that I have been abused, abused by one whom you too justly suspected of being a Villain. He is, in Truth, the worst of Villains.'  The Joy which Mrs. Miller now felt, bereft her of the Power of Speech, and might perhaps have deprived her of her Senses, if not of Life, had not a friendly Shower of Tears come seasonably to her Relief. At length recovering so far from her Transport as to be able to speak, she cried, 'And is my dear Mr. Jones then your Nephew, Sir? and not the Son of this Lady? and are your Eyes opened to him at last? and shall I live to see him as happy as he deserves?' 'He certainly is my Nephew, says Allworthy, and I hope all the rest.' -- 'And is this the dear, good Woman, the Person, cries she, to whom all this Discovery is owing!' -- 'She is indeed, says Allworthy." -- 'Why then, cried Mrs. Miller, upon her Knees, may Heaven shower down its choicest Blessings upon her Head, and for this one good Action, forgive her all her Sins be they never so many.'  Mrs. Waters then informed them, that she believed Jones would very shortly be released; for that the Surgeon was gone, in Company with a Nobleman, to the Justice who committed him, in order to certify that Mr. Fitzpatrick was out of all Manner of Danger, and to procure the Prisoner his Liberty.  Allworthy said, he should be glad to find his Nephew there at his Return home; but that he was then obliged to go on some Business of Consequence. He than called to a Servant to fetch him a Chair, and presently left the two Ladies together.  Mr. Blifil hearing the Chair ordered, came down Stairs to attend upon his Uncle, for he never was deficient in such Acts of Duty. He asked his Uncle if he was going out, which is a civil Way of asking a Man where he is going; to which the other making no Answer, he again desired to know when he would be pleased to return. -- Allworthy made no Answer to this neither, till he was just getting into his Chair, and then turning about he said -- 'Harkee, Sir, do you find out, before my Return, the Letter which your Mother sent me on her Deathbed.' Allworthy then departed, and left Blifil in a Situation to be envied only by a Man who is just going to be hanged.  CHAP. IX. A further Continuation. ALlworthy took an Opportunity whilst he was in the Chair of reading the Letter from Jones to Sophia, which Western delivered him; and there were some Expressions in it concerning himself, which drew Tears from his Eyes. At length he arrived at Mr. Western's, and was introduced to Sophia.  When the first Ceremonies were past, and the Gentleman and Lady had taken their Chairs, a Silence of some Minutes ensued; during which, the latter, who had been prepared for the Visit by her Father, sat playing with her Fan, and had every Mark of Confusion both in her Countenance and Behavior. At length Allworthy, who was himself a little disconcerted, began thus; 'I am afraid, Miss Western, my Family has been the Occasion of giving you some Uneasiness; to which, I fear, I have innocently become more instrumental than I intended. Be assured, Madam, had I at first known how disagreeable the Proposals had been, I should not have suffered you to have been so long persecuted. I hope therefore you will not think the Design of this Visit is to trouble you with any further Solicitations of that Kind, but entirely to relieve you from them.'  'Sir, said Sophia, with a little modest Hesitation, this Behavior is most kind and generous, and such as I could expect only from Mr. Allworthy: But as you have been so kind to mention this Matter, you will pardon me for saying, it has indeed given me great Uneasiness, and has been the Occasion of my suffering much cruel Treatment from a Father, who was, 'till that unhappy Affair, the tenderest and fondest of all Parents. I am convinced, Sir, you are too good and generous to resent my Refusal of your Nephew. Our own Inclinations are not in our Power; and whatever may be his Merit, I cannot force them in his Favor.' 'I assure you, most amiable young Lady.' said Allworthy, 'I am capable of no such Resentment, had the Person been my own Son, and had I entertained the highest Esteem for him. For you say truly, Madam, we cannot force our own Inclinations, much less can they be directed by another.' 'Oh! Sir,' answered Sophia, 'every Word you speak proves you to deserve that good, that great, that Benevolent Character the whole World allows you. I assure you, Sir, nothing less than the certain Prospect of future Misery could have made me resist the Commands of my Father.' 'I sincerely believe you Madam,' replied Allworthy, 'and I heartily congratulate you on your prudent Foresight, since by so justifiable a Resistance you have avoided Misery indeed.' 'You speak now, Mr. Allworthy, cries she, 'with a Delicacy which few Men are capable of feeling: but surely in my Opinion, to lead our Lives with one to whom we are indifferent, must be a State of Wretchedness -- perhaps that Wretchedness would be even increased by a Sense of the Merits of an Object to whom we cannot give our Affections. If I had married Mr. Blifil -- ' 'Pardon my interrupting you, Madam, answered Allworthy, 'but I cannot bear the Supposition. -- Believe me, Miss Western, I rejoice from my Heart, I rejoice in your Escape. -- I have discovered the Wretch, for whom you have suffered all this cruel Violence from your Father, to be a Villain.' 'How, Sir!' cries Sophia, -- 'you must believe this surprises me.' -- 'It has surprised me, Madam,' answered Allworthy, and so it will the World. -- But I have acquainted you with the real Truth.' 'Nothing but Truth,' says Sophia, 'can, I am convinced, come from the Lips of Mr. Allworthy. -- Yet, Sir, such sudden, such unexpected News -- Discovered, you say -- may Villainy be ever so.' -- 'You will soon enough hear the Story,' cries Allworthy, -- 'at present let us not mention so detested a Name -- I have another Matter of a very serious Nature to propose. -- O! Miss Western, I know your vast Worth, nor can I so easily part with the Ambition of being allied to it. -- I have a near Relation, Madam, a young Man whose Character is, I am convinced, the very opposite to that of this Wretch, and whose Fortune I will make equal to what his was to have been. -- Could I, Madam, hope you would admit a Visit from him?' Sophia after a Minute's Silence, answered, 'I will deal with the utmost Sincerity with Mr. Allworthy. His Character, and the Obligation I have just received from him demand it. I have determined at present to listen to no such Proposals from any Person. My only desire is to be restored to the Affection of my Father, and to be again the Mistress of his Family. This, Sir, I hope to owe to your good Offices. Let me beseech you, let me conjure you by all the Goodness, which I, and all who know you, have experienced; do not the very Moment when you have released me from one Persecution, do not engage me in another, as miserable and as fruitless.' 'Indeed, Miss Western,' replied Allworthy, 'I am capable of no such Conduct; and if this be your Resolution, he must submit to the Disappointment, whatever Torments he may suffer under it.' 'I must smile now, Mr. Allworthy,' answered Sophia, 'when you mention the Torments of a Man whom I do not know, and who can consequently have so little Acquaintance with me.' 'Pardon me, dear young Lady,' cries Allworthy, 'I begin now to be afraid he has had too much Acquaintance for the Repose of his future Days; since, if ever Man was capable of a sincere, violent and noble Passion, such, I am convinced, is my unhappy Nephew's for Miss Western.' 'A Nephew of yours! Mr. Allworthy,' answered Sophia. 'It is surely strange, I never heard of him before.' 'Indeed! Madam,' cries Allworthy, 'it is only the Circumstance of his being my Nephew to which you are a Stranger, and which, 'till this Day, was a Secret to me. -- Mr. Jones, who has long loved you, he! he is my Nephew.' -- 'Mr. Jones your Nephew, Sir?' cries Sophia, 'Can it be possible? -- 'He is indeed, Madam, answered Allworthy: He is my own Sister's Son -- as such I shall always own him; nor am I ashamed of owning him. I am much more ashamed of my past Behavior to him; but I was as ignorant of his Merit as of his Birth. Indeed, Miss Western, I have used him cruelly -- Indeed I have.' -- Here the good Man wiped his Eyes, and after a short Pause proceeded -- 'I never shall be able to reward him for his Sufferings without your Assistance. -- Believe me, most amiable young Lady, I must have a great Esteem of that Offering which I make to your Worth. I know he has been guilty of Faults; but there is great Goodness of Heart at the Bottom. Believe me, Madam, there is.' -- Here he stopped, seeming to expect an Answer, which he presently received from Sophia, after she had a little recovered herself from the Hurry of Spirits into which so strange and sudden Information had thrown her: 'I sincerely wish you Joy, Sir, of a Discovery in which you seem to have such Satisfaction. I Doubt not but you will have all the Comfort you can promise yourself from it. The young Gentleman has certainly a thousand good Qualities, which makes it impossible he should not behave well to such an Uncle.' -- 'I hope, Madam,' said Allworthy, he has those good Qualities which must make him a good Husband. -- He must I am sure, be of all Men the most abandoned, if a Lady of your Merit should condescend' -- 'You must pardon me, Mr. Allworthy,' answered Sophia, 'I cannot listen to a Proposal of this Kind. Mr. Jones, I am convinced, has much Merit; but I shall never receive Mr. Jones as one who is to be my Husband -- Upon my Honor I never will.' -- 'Pardon me Madam,' cries Allworthy, 'if I am a little surprised after what I have heard from Mr. Western -- I hope the unhappy young Man has done nothing to forfeit your good Opinion, if he had ever the Honor to enjoy it. -- Perhaps he may have been misrepresented to you, as he was to me. The same Villainy may have injured him every where. -- He is no Murderer, I assure you, as he has been called.' -- 'Mr. Allworthy, answered Sophia, I have told you my Resolution. I wonder not at what my Father has told you; but whatever his Apprehensions or Fears have been, if I know my Heart, I have given no Occasion for them; since it has always been a fixed Principle with me, never to have married without his Consent. This is, I think, the Duty of a Child to a Parent; and this, I hope, nothing could ever have prevailed with me to swerve from. I do not indeed conceive, that the Authority of any Parent can oblige us to marry, in direct Opposition to our Inclinations. To avoid a Force of this Kind, which I had Reason to suspect, I left my Father's House, and sought Protection elsewhere. This is the Truth of my Story; and if the World, or my Father, carry my Intentions any farther, my own Conscience will acquit me.' 'I hear you, Miss Western,' cries Allworthy with Admiration. 'I admire the Justness of your Sentiments; but surely there is more in this. I am cautious of offending you, young Lady; but am I to look on all which I have hitherto heard or seen, as a Dream only? And have you suffered so much Cruelty from your Father on the Account of a Man to whom you have been always absolutely indifferent?' 'I beg, Mr. Allworthy,' answered Sophia, 'you will not insist on my Reasons; -- Yes I have suffered indeed: I will not, Mr. Allworthy, conceal -- I will be very sincere with you -- I own I had a great Opinion of Mr. Jones -- I believe -- I know I have suffered for my Opinion -- I have been treated cruelly by my Aunt, as well as by my Father; but that is now past -- I beg I may not be farther pressed; for whatever has been, my Resolution is now fixed. Your Nephew, Sir, has many Virtues -- he has great Virtues, Mr. Allworthy. I question not but he will do you Honor in the World, and make you happy.' -- 'I wish I could make him so, Madam,' replied Allworthy; 'but that I am convinced is only in your Power. It is that Conviction which has made me so earnest a Solicitor in his Favor.' 'You are deceived; indeed, Sir, you are deceived,' said Sophia -- 'I hope not by him -- It is sufficient to have deceived me. Mr. Allworthy, I must insist on being pressed no farther upon this Subject. -- I should be sorry -- Nay, I will not injure him in your Favor. I wish Mr. Jones very well. I sincerely wish him well; and I ^^peat again to you, whatever Demerit he may have to me, I am certain he has many good Qualities. I do not disown my former Thoughts; but nothing can ever recall them. At present there is not a Man on Earth whom I would more resolutely reject than Mr. Jones; nor would the Addresses of Mr. Blifil himself be less agreeable to me.'  Western had been long impatient for the Event of this Conference, and was just now arrived at the Door to listen; when having heard the last Sentiments of his Daughter's Heart, he lost all Temper, and bursting open the Door in a Rage, cried out, -- 'It is a Lie. It is a d -- n'd Lie. It is all owing to that d -- n'd Rascal Juones; and if she could get at un, she would ha un any Hour of the Day.' Here Allworthy interposed, and addressing himself to the Squire with some Anger in his Look, he said, 'Mr. Western, you have not kept your Word with me. You promised to abstain from all Violence.' -- 'Why so I did,' cries Western, 'as long as it was possible; but to hear a Wench telling such confounded Lies. -- Zounds! Does she think if she can make Vools of other Volk, she can make one of me? -- No, no, I know her better than thee do.' 'I am sorry to tell you, Sir,' answered Allworthy, it does not appear by your Behavior to this young Lady, that you know her at all. I ask Pardon for what I say; but I think our Intimacy, your own Desires, and the Occasion justify me. She is your Daughter, Mr. Western, and I think she does Honor to your Name. If I was capable of Envy, I should sooner envy you on this Account, than any other Man whatever.' -- 'Od-rabbit-it,' cries the Squire, 'I wish she was thine with all my Heart -- would soon be glad to be rid of the Trouble of her.' -- 'Indeed, my good Friend,' answered Allworthy, 'you yourself are the Cause of all the Trouble you complain of. Place that Confidence in the young Lady which she so well deserves, and I am certain you will be the happiest Father on Earth.' -- 'I Confidence in her!' cries the Squire. ''Sblood!' what Confidence can I place in her, when she will not do as I would ha her? Let her gi but her Consent to marry as I would ha her, and I Will place as much Confidence in her as would ha me.' -- 'You have no Right, Neighbor,' answered Allworthy, 'to insist on any such Consent. A negative Voice your Daughter allows you, and God and Nature have thought proper to allow you no more.' 'A negative Voice?' cries the Squire, -- Ay! ay! I Will show you what a negative Voice I ha. -- Go along, go into your Chamber, go, you Stubborn -- 'Indeed, Mr. Western,' said Allworthy, -- 'Indeed, you use her cruelly -- I cannot bear to see this -- You shall, you must behave to her in a kinder Manner. She deserves the best of Treatment.' 'Yes, yes,' said the Squire, I know what she deserves: Now she is gone, I Will show you what she deserves -- See here, Sir, here is a Letter from my Cousin, my Lady Bellaston, in which she is so kind to gi me to understand, that the Fellow is got out of Prison again; and here she advises me to take all the Care I can of the Wench. Odzookers! Neighbor Allworthy, you don't know what it is to govern a Daughter.'  The Squire ended his Speech with some Compliments to his own Sagacity; and then Allworthy, after a formal Preface, acquainted him with the whole Discovery which he had made concerning Jones, with his Anger to Blifil, and with every Particular which has been disclosed to the Reader in the preceding Chapters.  Men over-violent in their Dispositions, are, for the most Part, as changeable in them. No sooner then was Western informed of Mr. Allworthy's Intention to make Jones his Heir, than he joined heartily with the Uncle in every Commendation of the Nephew, and became as eager for her Marriage with Jones, as he had before been to couple her to Blifil.  Here Mr. Allworthy was again forced to interpose, and to relate what had passed between him and Sophia, at which he testified great Surprise.  The Squire was silent a Moment, and looked wild with Astonishment at this Account -- At last he cried out, 'Why what can be the Meaning of this, Neighbor Allworthy? Vond o un she was, that I Will be sworn to. -- Odzookers! I have hit o't. As sure as a Gun I have hit o the very right o't. It Is all long o Zister. The Girl has got a Hankering after this Son of a whore of a Lord. I vound 'em together at my Cousin, my Lady Bellaston's. He has turned the Head of her that is certain -- but d -- n me if he shall ha her -- I Will ha no Lords nor Courtiers in my Vamily.'  Allworthy now made a long Speech, in which he repeated his Resolution to avoid all violent Measures, and very earnestly recommended gentle Methods to Mr. Western, as those by which he might be assured of succeeding best with his Daughter. He then took his Leave, and returned back to Mrs. Miller, but was forced to comply with the earnest Entreaties of the Squire, in promising to bring Mr. Jones to visit him that Afternoon, 'that he might,' as he said, 'make all Matters up with the young Gentleman.' At Mr. Allworthy's Departure, Western promised to follow his Advice in his Behavior to Sophia, saying, 'I don't know how it is, but d -- n me, Allworthy, if you don't make me always do just as you please, and yet I have as good an Esteate as you, and am in the Commission of the Peace as well as yourself.'  CHAP. X. Wherein the History begins to draw toward a Conclusion. WHEN Allworthy returned to his Lodgings, he heard Mr. Jones was just arrived before him. He hurried therefore instantly into an empty Chamber, whither he ordered Mr. Jones to be brought to him alone.  It is impossible to conceive a more tender or moving Scene, than the Meeting between the Uncle and Nephew, (for Mrs. Waters, as the Reader may well suppose, had at her last Visit discovered to him the Secret of his Birth). The first Agonies of Joy which were felt on both Sides, are indeed beyond my Power to describe: I shall not therefore attempt it. After Allworthy had raised Jones from his Feet, where he had prostrated himself, and received him into his Arms, 'O my Child,' he cried, 'how have I been to blame! How have I injured you! What Amends can I ever make you for those unkind, those unjust Suspicions which I have entertained; and for all the Sufferings they have occasioned to you?' 'Am I not made Amends?' cries Jones, 'Would not my Sufferings, if they had been ten Times greater, have been now richly repaid? O my dear Uncle! this Goodness, this Tenderness over-powers, unmans, destroys me. I cannot bear the Transports which slow so fast upon me. To be again restored to your Presence, to your Favor; to be once more thus kindly received by my great, my noble, my generous Benefactor, -- 'Indeed, Child,' cries Allworthy,' I have used you cruelly.' -- He then explained to him all the Treachery of Blifil, and again repeated Expressions of the utmost Concern, for having been induced by that Treachery to use him so ill. 'O talk not so,' answered Jones;' 'Indeed Sir, you have used me nobly. The wisest Man might be deceived as you were, and, under such a Deception, the best must have acted just as you did. Your Goodness displayed itself in the Midst of your Anger, just as it then seemed. I owe every thing to that Goodness of which I have been most unworthy. Do not put me on Self-accusation, by carrying your generous Sentiments too far. Alas, Sir, I have not been punished more than I have deserved; and it shall be the whole Business of my furture Life to deserve that Happiness you now bestow on me; for believe me, my dear Uncle, my Punishment has not been thrown away upon me. Though I have been a great, I am not a hardened Sinner; I thank Heaven I have had Time to reflect on my past Life, where though I cannot charge myself with any gross Villainy, yet I can discern Follies and Vices too sufficient to repent and to be ashamed of; Follies which have been attended with dreadful Consequences to myself, and have brought me to the Brink of Destruction.' 'I am rejoiced, my dear Child,' answered Allworthy, to hear you talk thus sensibly; for as I am convinced Hypocrisy (good Heaven how have I been imposed on by it in others!) was never among your Faults, so I can readily believe all you say. You now see, Tom, to what Dangers Imprudence alone may subject Virtue (for Virtue, I am now convinced, you love in a great Degree). Prudence is indeed the Duty which we owe to ourselves; and if we will be so much our own Enemies as to neglect it, we are not to wonder if the World is deficient in discharging their Duty to us; for when a Man lays the Foundation of his own Ruin, others will, I am afraid, be too apt to build upon it. You say, however you have seen your Errors; and will reform them. I firmly believe you, my dear Child; and therefore, from this Moment, you shall never more be reminded of them by me. Remember them only yourself so far, as for the future to teach you the better to avoid them; but still remember, for your Comfort, that there is this great Difference between those Faults which Candor may construe into Imprudence, and those which can be deduced from Villainy only. The former, perhaps, are even more liable to subject a Man to Ruin; but if he reform, his Character will, at length, be totally retrieved; the World, though not immediately, will, in Time, be reconciled to him; and he may reflect, not without some Mixture of Pleasure, on the Dangers he has escaped: But Villainy, my Boy, when once discovered, is irretrievable; the Stains which this leaves behind, no Time will wash away. The Censure of Mankind will pursue the Wretch, their Scorn will abash him in Public, and if Shame drives him into Retirement, he will go to it with all those Terrors with which a weary Child, who is afraid of Hobgoblins, retreats from Company to go to Bed alone. Here his murdered Conscience will haunt him. Repose, like a false Friend, will fly from him. Wherever he turns his Eyes, Horror presents itself; if he looks backward, unavailable Repentance treads on his Heels; if forward, incurable Despair stares him in the Face; till, like a condemned Prisoner, confined in a Dungeon, he detests his present Condition, and yet dreads the Consequence of that Hour which is to relieve him from it. Comfort yourself, I say, my Child, that this is not your Case; and rejoice, with Thankfulness to him who has suffered you to see your Errors, before they have brought on you that Destruction to which a Persistance in even those Errors must have led you. You have deserted them, and the Prospect now before you is such, that Happiness seems in your own Power.' -- At these Words Jones fetched a deep Sigh; upon which, when Allworthy remonstrated, he said, 'Sir, I will conceal nothing from you: I fear there is one Consequence of my Vices I shall never be able to retrieve. O my dear Uncle, I have lost a Treasure.' -- 'You need say no more,' answered Allworthy; 'I will be explicit with you; I know what you lament; I have seen the young Lady, and have discoursed with her concerning you. This I must insist on, as an Earnest of your Sincerity in all you have said, and of the Stedfastness of your Resolution, that you obey me in one Instance. To abide entirely by the Determination of the young Lady, whether it shall be in your Favor, or no. She has already suffered enough from Solicitations which I hate to think of; she shall owe no further Constraint to my Family: I know her Father will be as ready to torment her now on your Account, as he has formerly been on another; but I am determined she shall suffer no more Confinement, no more Violence, no more uneasy Hours.' -- 'O my dear Uncle', answered Jones, 'lay, I beseech you, some Command on me, in which I shall have some Merit in Obedience. Believe me, Sir, the only Instance in which I could disobey you, would be to give an uneasy Moment to my Sophia. No, Sir, if I am so miserable to have incurred her Displeasure beyond all Hope of Forgiveness, that alone, with the dreadful Reflection of causing her Misery, will be sufficient to overpower me. To call Sophia mine is the greatest, and now the only additional Blessing which Heaven can bestow; but it is a Blessing which I must owe to her alone.' 'I will not flatter you, Child,' cries Allworthy; I fear your Case is desperate: I never saw stronger Marks of an unalterable Resolution in any Person, than appeared in her vehement Declarations against receiving your Addresses; for which, perhaps, you can account better than myself.' -- 'Oh, Sir! I can account too well,' answered Jones; 'I have sinned against her beyond all Hope of Pardon; and, guilty as I am, my Guilt unfortunately appears to her in ten Times blacker than the real Colors. O my dear Uncle, I find my Follies are irretrievable; and all your Goodness cannot save me from Perdition.'  A Servant now acquainted them, that Mr. Western was below Stairs; for his Eagerness to see Jones could not wait till the Afternoon. Upon which Jones, whose Eyes were full of Tears, begged his Uncle to entertain Western a few Minutes, till he a little recovered himself: To which the good Man consented, and having ordered Mr. Western to be shown into a Parlour, went down to him.  Mrs. Miller no sooner heard, that Jones was alone (for she had not yet seen him since his Release from Prison,) than she came eagerly into the Room, and, advancing toward Jones, wished him heartily Joy of his newfound Uncle, and his happy Reconciliation; adding, 'I wish I could give you Joy on another Account, my dear Child; but any thing so inexorable I never saw.' Jones, with some Appearance of Surprise, asked her, what she meant. 'Why then,' says she, 'I have been with your young Lady, and have explained all Matters to her, as they were told me by my Son Nightingale. She can have no longer any Doubt about the Letter, that I am certain; for I told her my Son Nightingale was ready to take his Oath, if she pleased, that it was all his own Invention, and the Letter of his inditing. I told her the very Reason of sending the Letter ought to recommend you to her the more, as it was all upon her Account, and a plain Proof, that you was resolved to quit all your Profligacy for the future; that you had never been guilty of a single Instance of Infidelity to her since your seeing her in Town. I am afraid I went too far there; but Heaven forgive me: I hope your future Behavior will be my Justification. I am sure I have said all I can; but all to no Purpose. She remains inflexible. She says, she had forgiven many Faults on account of Youth; but expressed such Detestation of the Character of a Libertine, that she absolutely silenced me. I often attempted to excuse you; but the Justness of her Accusation flew in my Face. Upon my Honor she is a lovely Woman, and one of the sweetest and most sensible Creatures I ever saw. I could have almost kissed her for one Expression she made use of. It was a Sentiment worthy of Seneca, or of a Bishop.' "I once fancied, Madam,' said she, "I had discovered great Goodness of Heart in Mr. Jones; and for that I own I had a sincere Esteem; but an entire Profligacy of Manners will corrupt the best Heart in the World; and all which a good-natured Libertine can expect is, that we should mix some Grains of Pity with our Contempt and Abhorrence." 'She is an angelic Creature, that is the Truth on it.' -- 'O Mrs. Miller, answered Jones, can I bear to think I have lost such an Angel. -- 'Lost! No,' cries Mrs. Miller;' 'I hope you have not lost her yet. Resolve to leave such vicious Courses, and you may yet have Hopes: Nay, if she should remain inexorable, there is another young Lady, a sweet pretty young Lady, and a swinging Fortune, who is absolutely dying for Love of you. I heard of it this very Morning, and I told it to Miss Western; nay, I went a little beyond the Truth again; for I told her you had refused her; but indeed I knew you would refuse her. -- And here I must give you a little Comfort: When I mentioned the young Lady's Name, who is no other than the pretty Widow Hunt, I thought she turned pale; but when I said you had refused her, I will be sworn her Face was all over Scarlet in an Instant; and these were her very Words,' "I will not deny but that I believe he has some Affection for me.'  Here the Conversation was interrupted by the Arrival of Western, who could no longer be kept out of the Room even by the Authority of Allworthy, himself; though this, as we have often seen, had a wonderful Power over him.  Western immediately went up to Jones, crying out, 'My old Friend Tom, I am glad to see thee with all my Heart. All past must be forgotten. I could not intend any Affront to thee, because, as Allworthy here knows, nay, do know it thyself, I took thee for another Person; and where a Body means no Harm, what signifies a hasty Word or two; one Christian must forget and forgive another.' 'I hope, Sir, said Jones, 'I shall never forget the many Obligations I have had to you; but as for any Offense toward me, I declare I am an utter Stranger.' -- 'A't,' says Western,' then give me thy Fist, a't as hearty an honest Cock as any in the Kingdom. Come along with me; I Will carry thee to thy Mistress this Moment.' Here Allworthy interposed; and the Squire being unable to prevail either with the Uncle or Nephew, was, after some Litigation, obliged to consent to delay introducing Jones to Sophia till the Afternoon; at which Time Allworthy, as well in Compassion to Jones, as in Compliance with the eager Desires of Western, was prevailed upon to promise to attend at the Tea-table.  The Conversation which now ensued was pleasant enough; and with which, had it happened earlier in our History, we would have entertained our Reader; but as we have now Leisure only to attend to what is very material, it shall suffice to say, that Matters being entirely adjusted as to the Afternoon-Visit, Mr. Western again returned home.  CHAP. XI. This History draws nearer to a Conclusion. WHEN Mr. Western was departed, Jones began to inform Mr. Allworthy and Mrs. Miller, that his Liberty had been procured by two noble Lords, who, together with two Surgeons, and a Friend of Mr. Nightingale's, had attended the Magistrate by whom he had been committed, and by whom, on the Surgeons Oaths that the wounded Person was out of all Manner of Danger from this Wound, he was discharged.  One only of these Lords, he said, he had ever seen before, and that no more than once; but the other had greatly surprised him, by asking his Pardon for an Offense he had been guilty of toward him, occasioned, he said, entirely by his Ignorance who he was.  Now the Reality of the Case with which Jones was not acquainted till afterward, was this. The Lieutenant whom Lord Fellamar had employed, according to the Advice of Lady Bellaston, to press Jones, as a Vagabond, into the Sea Service, when he came to report the Event which we have before seen to his Lordship, spoke very favorably of the Behavior of Mr. Jones on all Accounts, and strongly assured that Lord, that he must have mistaken the Person, for that Jones was certainly a Gentleman, insomuch that his Lordship, who was strictly a Man of Honor, and would by no Means have been guilty of an Action which the World in general would have condemned, began to be much concerned for the Advice which he had taken.  Within a Day or two after this, Lord Fellamar happened to dine with the Irish Peer, who, in a Conversation upon the Duel, acquainted his Company with the Character of Fitzpatrick; to which indeed he did not do strict Justice, especially in what related to his Lady. He said, she was the most innocent, and most injured Woman alive, and that from Compassion alone he had undertaken her Cause. He then declared an Intention of going the next Morning to Fitzpatrick's Lodgings, in order to prevail with him, if possibly, to consent to a Separation from his Wife, who, the Peer said, was in Apprehensions for her Life, if she should ever return to be under the Power of her Husband. Lord Fellamar agreed to go with him, that he might satisfy himself more concerning Jones, and the Circumstances of the Duel; for he was by no Means easy concerning the Part he had acted. The Moment his Lordship gave a Hint of his Readiness to assist in the Delivery of the Lady, it was eagerly embraced by the other Nobleman, who depended much on the Authority of Lord Fellamar, as he thought it would greatly contribute to awe Fitzpatrick into a Compliance; and perhaps he was in the right; for the poor Irishman no sooner saw these noble Peers had undertaken the Cause of his Wife, than he submitted, and Articles of Separation were soon drawn up and signed between the Parties.  Fitzpatrick had been so well satisfied by Mrs. Waters concerning the Innocence of his Wife with Jones at Upton, or perhaps from some other Reasons, was now become so indifferent to that Matter, that he spoke highly in Favor of Jones, to Lord Fellamar, took all the Blame upon himself, and said the other had behaved very much like a Gentleman, and a Man of Honor; and upon that Lord's further Enquiry concerning Mr. Jones, Fitzpatrick told him he was Nephew to a Gentleman of very great Fashion and Fortune, which was the Account he had just received from Mrs. Waters, after her Interview with Dowling.  Lord Fellamar now thought it behoved him to do every Thing in his Power to make Satisfaction to a Gentleman whom he had so grossly injured, and without any Consideration of Rivalship, (for he had now given over all Thoughts of Sophia) determined to procure Mr. Jones's Liberty, being satisfied as well from Fitzpatrick as his Surgeon, that the Wound was not mortal. He therefore prevailed with the Irish Peer to accompany him to the Place where Jones was confined, to whom he behaved as we have already related.  When Allworthy returned to his Lodgings, he immediately carried Jones into his Room, and then acquainted him with the whole Matter, as well what he had heard from Mrs. Waters, as what he had discovered from Mr. Dowling.  Jones expressed great Astonishment, and no less Concern at this Account; but without making any Comment or Observation upon it. And now a Message was brought from Mr. Blifil, desiring to know if his Uncle was at Leisure, and he might wait upon him. Alworthy started and turned pale, and then in a more passionate Tone than, I believe, he had ever used before, bid the Servant tell Blifil, he knew him not. 'Consider, dear Sir,' -- cries Jones in a trembling Voice. -- 'I have considered, answered Allworthy, and you yourself shall carry my Message to the Villain. -- No one can carry him the Sentence of his own Ruin so properly as the Man whose Ruin he has so villainously contrived.' -- 'Pardon me, dear Sir, said Jones; a Moment's Reflection will, I am sure, convince you of the contrary. What might be perhaps but Justice from another Tongue, would from mine be Insult; and to whom? -- My own Brother, and your Nephew. -- Nor did he use me so barbarously. -- Indeed that would have been more inexcuseable than any Thing he has done. Fortune may tempt Men of no very bad Dispositions to Injustice; but Insults proceed only from black and rancorous Minds, and have no Temptations to excuse them. -- Let me beseech you, Sir, to do nothing by him in the present Height of your Anger. Consider, my dear Uncle, I was not myself condemned unheard.' Allworthy stood silent a Moment, and then embracing Jones, he said, with Tears gushing from his Eyes, 'O my Child! to what Goodness have I been so long blind!'  Mrs. Miller entering the Room at that Moment, after a gentle Rap, which was not perceived, and seeing Jones in the Arms of his Uncle, the poor Woman, in an Agony of Joy, fell upon her Knees, and burst forth into the most extatic Thanksgivings to Heaven, for what had happened. -- Then running to Jones, she embraced him eagerly, crying, 'My dearest Friend, I wish you Joy a Thousand and a Thousand Times of this blessed Day;' and next Mr. Allworthy himself received the same Congratulations. To which he answered, 'Indeed, indeed, Mrs. Miller, I am beyond Expression happy.' Some few more Raptures being passed on all Sides, Mrs. Miller desired them both to walk down to Dinner in the Parlour, where she said there were a very happy Set of People assembled; being indeed no other than Mr. Nightingale and his Bride, and his Cousin Harris with her Bridegroom.  Allworthy excused himself from dining with the Company, saying he had ordered some little Thing for him and his Nephew in his own Apartment; for that they had much private Business to discourse of, but would not resist promising the good Woman, that both he and Jones would make Part of her Society at Supper.  Mrs. Miller then asked what was to be done with Blifil; 'for indeed, says she, I cannot be easy while such a Villain is in my House. -- Allworthy answered, 'He was as uneasy as herself on the same Account.' 'O, cries she, if that be the Case, leave the Matter to me; I Will soon show him the Outside of my Doors, I warrant you. Here are two or three lusty Fellows below Stairs.' 'There will be no need of any Violence, cries Allworthy, if you will carry him a Message from me, he will, I am convinced, depart of his own Accord.' 'Will I? said Mrs. Miller, I never did any Thing in my Life with a better Will.' Here Jones interfered, and said, 'He had considered the Matter better, and would, if Mr. Allworthy pleased, be himself the Messenger.' 'I know, says he, already enough of your Pleasure, Sir, and I beg Leave to acquaint him with it by my own Words. Let me beseech you, Sir, added he, to reflect on the dreadful Consequences of driving him to violent and sudden Despair. How unfit, alas! is this poor Man to die in his present Situation.' This Suggestion had not the least Effect on Mrs. Miller. She left the Room crying, 'You are too good, Mr. Jones, infinitely too good to live in this World.' But it made a deeper Impression on Allworthy. 'My good Child, said he, I am equally astonished at the Goodness of your Heart, and the Quickness of your Understanding. Heaven indeed forbid that this Wretch should be deprived of any Means or Time for Repentance. That would be a shocking Consideration indeed. Go to him therefore, and use your own Discretion; yet do not flatter him with any Hopes of my Forgiveness; for I shall never forgive Villainy farther than my Religion obliges me, and that extends not either to our Bounty or our Conversation.'  Jones went up to Blifil's Room, whom he found in a Situation which moved his Pity, though it would have raised a less amiable Passion in many Beholders. He had cast himself on his Bed, where he lay abandoning himself to Despair, and drowned in Tears; not in such Tears as flow from Contrition, and wash away Guilt from Minds which have been seduced or surprised into it unawares, against the Bent of their natural Dispositions, as will sometimes happen from human Frailty, even to the Good: No, these Tears were such as the frighted Thief sheds in his Cart, and are indeed the Effects of that Concern which the most savage Natures are seldom deficient in feeling for themselves.  It would be unpleasant and tedious to paint this Scene in full Length. Let it suffice to say, that the Behavior of Jones was kind to Excess. He omitted nothing which his Invention could supply, to raise and comfort the drooping Spirits of Blifil, before he communicated to him the Resolution of his Uncle, that he must quit the House that Evening. He offered to furnish him with any Money he wanted, assured him of his hearty Forgiveness of all he had done against him, that he would endeavor to live with him hereafter as a Brother, and would leave nothing unattempted to effectuate a Reconciliation with his Uncle.  Blifil was at first sullen and silent, balancing in his Mind whether he should yet deny all: But finding at last the Evidence too strong against him, he betook himself at last to confession. He then asked Pardon of his Brother in the most vehement Manner, prostrated himself on the Ground, and kissed his Feet: In short, he was now as remarkably mean, as he had been before remarkably wicked.  Jones could not so far check his Disdain, but that it a little discovered itself in his Countenance at this extreme Servility. He raised his Brother the Moment he could from the Ground, and advised him to bear his Afflictions more like a Man; repeating, at the same Time, his Promises, that he would do all in his Power to lessen them: For which Blifil making many Professions of his Unworthiness, poured forth a Profusion of Thanks: And then he having declared he would immediately depart to another Lodging, Jones returned to his Uncle.  Among other Matters, Allworthy now acquainted Jones with the Discovery which he made concerning the 500 l. Bank-Notes. '*I have,' said he, 'already consulted a Lawyer, who tells me, to my great Astonishment, that there is no Punishment for a Fraud of this Kind. Indeed, when I consider the black Ingratitude of this Fellow toward you, I think a Highwayman, compared to him, is an innocent Person.'  'Good Heaven!' says Jones, 'is it possible? -- I am shocked beyond Measure at this News. I thought there was not an honester Fellow in the World. -- The Temptation of such a Sum was too great for him to withstand; for smaller Matters have come safe to me through his Hand. Indeed, my dear Uncle, you must suffer me to call it Weakness rather than Ingratitude; for I am convinced the poor Fellow loves me, and has done me some Kindness, which I can never forget; nay, I believe he has repented of this very Act: For it is not above a Day or two ago, when my Affairs seemed in the most desperate Situation, that he visited me in my Confinement, and offered me any Money I wanted. Consider, Sir, what a Temptation to a Man who had tasted such bitter Distress, it must be to have a Sum in his Possession, which must put him and his Family beyond any future Possibility of suffering the like.'  'Child,' cries Allworthy, 'you carry this forgiving Temper too far. Such mistaken Mercy is not only weakness, but borders on Injustice, and is very pernicious to Society, as it encourages Vice. The Dishonesty of this Fellow I might perhaps have pardoned, but never his Ingratitude. And give me Leave to say, when we suffer any Temptation to atone for Dishonesty itself, we are as candid and merciful as we ought to be; and so far I confess I have gone: for I have often pitied the Fate of a Highwayman, when I have been on the Grand Jury; and have more than once applied to the Judge on the Behalf of such as have had any mitigating Circumstances in their Case; but when Dishonesty is attended with any blacker Crime, such as Cruelty, Murder, Ingratitude, or the like, Compassion and Forgiveness then become Faults. I am convinced the Fellow is a Villain, and he shall be punished; at least as far as I can punish him.'  This was spoke with so stern a Voice, that Jones did not think proper to make any Reply: Besides, the Hour appointed by Mr. Western now drew so near that he had barely Time left do dress himself. Here therefore ended the present Dialogue, and Jones retired to another Room, where Partridge attended, according to order, with his Clothes.  Partridge had scarce seen his Master since the happy Discovery. The poor Fellow was unable either to contain or express his Transports. He behaved like one frantic, and made almost as many Mistakes while he was dressing Jones, as I have seen made by Harlequin in dressing himself on the Stage.  His Memory, however, was not in the least deficient. He recollected now many Omens and Presages of this happy Event, some of which he had remarked at the Time, but many more he now remembered; nor did he omit the Dreams he had dreamt the Evening before his meeting with Jones; and concluded with saying, 'I always told your Honor something boded in my Mind, that you would one Time or other have it in your Power to make my Fortune.' Jones assured him, that this Boding should as certainly be verified with regard to him, as all the other Omens had been to himself; which did not a little add to all the Raptures which the poor Fellow had already conceived on account of his Master.  CHAP. XII. Approaching still nearer to the End. JONES being now completely dressed, attended his Uncle to Mr. Western's. He was indeed one of the finest Figures ever beheld, and his Person alone would have charmed the greater Part of Womankind; but we hope it has already appeared in this History, that Nature, when she formed him, did not totally rely, as she sometimes does, on this Merit only, to recommend her Work.  Sophia, who, angry as she was, was likewise set forth to the best Advantage, for which I leave my female Reader to account, appeared so extremely beautiful, that even Allworthy, when he saw her, could not forbear whispering Western, that he believed she was the finest Creature in the World. To which Western answered, in a Whisper overheard by all present, 'So much the better for Tom; -- for d -- n me if he shall not ha the tousling her.' Sophia was all over Scarlet at these Words, while Tom's Countenance was altogether as pale, and he was almost ready to sink from his Chair.  The Tea-table was scarce removed, before Western lugged Allworthy out of the Room, telling him, 'He had Business of Consequence to impart, and must speak to him that Instant in private before he forgot it.'  The Lovers were now alone, and it will, I question not, appear strange to many Readers, that those who had so much to say to one another when Danger and Difficulty attended their Conversation, and who seemed so eager to rush into each others Arms when so many Bars lay in their Way, now that with Safety they were at Liberty to say or do whatever they pleased, should both remain for some Time silent and motionless; insomuch, that a Stranger of moderate Sagacity might have well concluded they were mutually indifferent: But so it was, however strange it may seem; both sat with their Eyes cast downwards on the Ground, and for some Minutes continued in perfect Silence.  Mr. Jones, during this Interval, attempted once or twice to speak, but was absolutely incapable, muttering only, or rather, sighing out some broken Words: when Sophia at length, partly out of Pity to him, and partly to turn the Discourse from the Subject which she knew well enough he was endeavoring to open, said: --  'Sure, Sir, you are the most fortunate Man in the World in this Discovery.' ' 'And can you realy, Madam, think me so fortunate,' said Jones, sighing, 'while I have incurred your Displeasure? -- 'Nay, Sir,' says she, 'as to that you best know whether you have deserved it.' 'Indeed, Madam,' answered he, 'you yourself are as well apprized of all my Demerits. Mrs. Miller has acquainted you with the whole Truth. O! my Sophia, am I never to hope for Forgiveness?' -- 'I think, Mr. Jones,' said she, 'I may almost depend upon your own Justice, and leave it to yourself to pass Sentence on your own Conduct.' -- 'Alas! Madam,' answered he, 'it is Mercy, and not Justice, which I implore at your Hands. Justice I know must condemn me -- Yet not for the Letter I sent to Lady Bellaston. Of that I most solemnly declare, you have had a true Account.' He then insisted much on the Security given him by Nightingale of a fair Pretense for breaking off, if, contrary to their Expectations, her Ladyship should have accepted his Offer; but confessed, that he had been guilty of a great Indiscretion to put such a Letter as that into her Power, which, said he, 'I have dearly paid for, in the Effect it has upon you.' 'I do not, I cannot,' says she, 'believe otherwise of that Letter than you would have me. My Conduct, I think, shows you clearly I do not believe there is much in that. And yet, Mr. Jones, have I not enough to resent? After what past at Upton, so soon to engage in a new Amor with another Woman, while I fancied, and you pretended, your Heart was bleeding for me! -- Indeed you have acted strangely. Can I believe the Passion you have professed to me to be sincere? Or if I can, what Happiness can I assure myself of with a Man capable of so much Inconstancy?' 'O! my Sophia, cries he, 'do not doubt the Sincerity of the purest Passion that ever inflamed a human Breast. Think, most adorable Creature, of my unhappy Situation, of my Despair. -- Could I, my Sophia, have flattered myself with the most distant Hopes of being ever permitted to throw myself at your Feet, in the Manner I do now, it would not have been in the Power of any other Woman to have inspired a Thought which the severest Chastity could have condemned. Inconstancy to you! O Sophia! if you can have Goodness enough to pardon what is past, do not let any cruel future Apprehensions shut your Mercy against me. -- No Repentance was ever more sincere. O! let it reconcile me to my Heaven in this dear Bosom.' 'Sincere Repentance, Mr. Jones' answered she, 'will obtain the Pardon of a Sinner, but it is from one who is a perfect Judge of that Sincerity. A human Mind may be imposed on; nor is there any infallible Method to prevent it. You must expect however, that if I can be prevailed on by your Repentance to pardon you, I will at least insist on the strongest Proof of its Sincerity.' -- 'O! name any Proof in my Power,' answered Jones eagerly. 'Time,' replied she; 'Time, Mr. Jones, can alone convince me that you are a true Penitent, and have resolved to abandon these vicious Courses, which I should detest you, if I imagined you capable of persevering in.' 'Do not imagine it,' cries Jones. 'On my Knees I entreat, I implore your Confidence, a Confidence which it shall be the Business of my Life to deserve.' 'Let it then,' said she, 'be the Business of some Part of your Life to show me you deserve it. I think I have been explicit enough in assuring you, that when I see you merit my Confidence, you will obtain it. After what is past, Sir, can you expect I should take you upon your Word?'  He replied, 'Don't believe me upon my Word; I have a better Security, a Pledge for my Constancy, which it is impossible to see and to doubt.' 'What is that?' said Sophia, a little surprised. 'I will show you, my charming Angel, cried Jones, seizher Hand, and carrying her to the Glass. 'There, behold it there, in that lovely Figure, in that Face, that Shape, those Eyes, that Mind which shines through those Eyes: Can the Man who shall be in Possession of these be inconstant? Impossible! my Sophia. They would six a Dorimant, a Lord Rochester. You could not doubt it, if you could see yourself with any Eyes but your own.' Sophia blushed, and half smiled; but forcing again her Brow into a Frown, 'If I am to judge,' said she, 'of the future by the past, my Image will no more remain in your Heart, when I am out of your Sight, than it will in this Glass when I am out of the Room.' 'By Heaven, by all that is sacred,' said Jones, 'it never was out of my Heart. The Delicacy of your Sex cannot conceive the Grossness of ours, nor how little one Sort of Amor has to do with the Heart.' 'I will never marry a Man,' replied Sophia, very gravely, 'who shall not learn Refinement enough to be as incapable as I am myself of making such a Distinction.' 'I will learn it,' said Jones. 'I have learnt it already. The first Moment of Hope that my Sophia might be my Wife taught it me at once; and all the rest of her Sex from that Moment became as little the Objects of Desire to my Sense, as of Passion to my Heart.' 'Well,' said Sophia, the Proof of this must be from Time. Your Situation, Mr. Jones, is now altered, and I assure you I have great Satisfaction in the Alteration. You will now want no Opportunity of being near me, and convincing me* that your Mind is altered too.' 'O! my Angel,' cries Jones, 'how shall I thank thy Goodness? And are you so good to own, that you have a Satisfaction in my Prosperity? -- Believe me, believe me, Madam, it is you alone have given me a relish to that Prosperity, since I owe to it the dear Hope -- O! my Sophia, let it not be a distant one. -- I will be all Obedience to your Commands. I will not dare to press any farther than you permit me. Yet let me entreat you to appoint a short Trial. O! tell me, when I may expect you will be convinced of what is most solemnly true.' 'When I have gone voluntarily thus far, Mr. Jones, said she, 'I expect not to be pressed. Nay, I will not.' -- 'O don't look unkindly thus, my Sophia,' cries he. 'I do not, I dare not press you -- Yet permit me at least once more to beg you would fix the Period. O! consider the Impatience of Love.' -- ' 'A Twelvemonth perhaps,' said she. -- 'O! my Sophia,' cries he, 'you have named an Eternity.' -- 'Perhaps it may be something sooner,' says she, 'I will not be teazed. If your Passion for me be what I would have it, I think you may now be easy.' -- 'Easy Sophia, call not such exulting Happiness as mine by so cold a Name. -- O! transporting Thought! am I not assured that the blessed Day will come, when I shall call you mine; when Fears shall be no more; when I shall have that dear, that vast, that exquisite, extatic Delight of making my Sophia happy?' -- 'Indeed, Sir,' said she, 'that Day is in your own Power.' -- 'O! my dear, my divine Angel!' cried he, 'these Words have made me mad with Joy. -- But I must, I will thank those dear Lips which have so sweetly pronounced my Bliss,' He then caught her in his Arms, and kissed her with an Ardour he had never ventured before.  At this Instant, Western, who had stood some Time listening, burst into the Room, and with his hunting Voice and Phrase, cried out, 'To her Boy, to her, go to her. -- That Is it, little Honeys, O that is it. Well, what is it all over? Has she appointed the Day, Boy? What, shall it be tomorrow or next Day? It shall not be put off a Minute longer than the next Day, I am resolved,' 'Let me beseech you, Sir,' says Jones, 'don't let me be the Occasion' -- 'Beseech mine A --,' cries Western, 'I thought thou had been a Lad of higher Mettle, than to give way to a Parcel of maidenish Tricks. -- I tell thee it is all Flimflam. Zoodikers! she would have the Wedding Tonight with all her Heart. Would not Sophy? Come confess, and be an honest Girl for once. What, art dumb? Why do not speak?' 'Why should I confess, Sir, says Sophia, 'since it seems you are so well acquainted with my Thoughts.' -- 'That's a good Girl,' cries he, 'and do consent then?' 'No indeed, Sir,' says Sophia, 'I have given no such Consent.' -- 'And wunt nut ha un then Tomorrow nor next Day?' says Western. -- 'Indeed, Sir,' says she, 'I have no such Intention.' 'But I can tell thee,' replied he, 'why have nut, only because thou do love to be disobedient, and to plague and vex thy Father,' -- 'Pray, Sir,' said Jones interfering. 'I tell thee, thou at a Puppy,' cries he. 'When I forbid her, then it was all nothing but sighing and whining, and languishing and writing; now I am vor thee, she is against thee. All the Spirit of contrary, that is all. She is above being guided and governed by her Father, that is the whole Truth on it. It is only to disoblige and contradict me.' 'What would my Papa have me do?' cries Sophia. 'What would I have thee do?' says he, 'why gi un thy Hand this Moment.' -- 'Well, Sir,' said Sophia, 'I will obey you. -- There is my Hand, Mr. Jones.' 'Well, and will you consent to ha un tomorrow Morning?' says Western. -- 'I will be obedient to you, Sir,' cries she. -- 'Why then tomorrow Morning be the Day,' cries he. -- Why then tomorrow Morning shall be the Day, Papa, since you will have it so,' says Sophia. Jones then fell upon his Knees, and kissed her Hand in an Agony of Joy, while Western began to caper and dance about the Room, presently crying out, -- 'Where the Devil is Allworthy? He is without now a-talking with that d -- d Lawyer Dowling, when he should be minding other Matters.' He then sallied out in quest of him, and very opportunely left the Lovers to enjoy a few tender Minutes alone.  But he soon returned with Allworthy, saying, 'If you will not believe me, you may ask her yourself. Have nut gin thy consent, Sophy, to be married tomorrow?' 'Such are your Commands, Sir,' cries Sophia, 'and I dare not be guilty of Disobedience.' 'I hope, Madam, cries Allworthy, my Nephew will merit so much Goondess, and will be always as sensible as myself of the great Honor you have done my Family. An Alliance with so charming and so excellent a young Lady, would indeed be an Honor to the greatest in England.' 'Yes,' cries Western, 'but if I had suffered her to stand shill I shall I, dilly dally, you might not have had that Honor yet awhile; I was forced to use a little fatherly Authority to bring her to.' 'I hope not, Sir,' cries Allworthy. 'I hope there is not the least Constraint.' 'Why there,' cries Western, you may bid her unsay all again if you will. Do repent heartily of thy Promise, do not, Sophy?' Indeed, Papa,' cries she, 'I do not repent, nor do I believe I ever shall, of any Promise in favor of Mr. Jones.' 'Then, Nephew,' cries Allworthy, 'I felicitate you most heartily; for I think you are the happiest of Men. And, Madam, you will give me leave to congratulate you on this joyful Occasion; indeed I am convinced you have bestowed yourself on one who will be sensible of your great Merit, and who will at least use his best Endeavors to deserve it.' 'His best Endeavors!' cries Western, that he will I warrant un.' -- 'Harkee, Allworthy, 'I'll bet thee five Pound to a Crown we have a Boy tomorrow, nine Months; but prithee tell me what wut ha? wut ha Burgundy, Champaigne, or what? for please Jupiter, we'll make a Night on it.' 'Indeed, Sir,' said Allworthy, 'you must excuse me; both my Nephew and I were engaged before I suspected this near Approach of his Happiness.' 'Engaged!' quoth the Squire, 'never tell me. -- I will not part with thee tonight upon any Occasion. Shall sup here, please the Lord Harry.' 'You must pardon me, my dear Neighbor,' answered Allworthy; 'I have given a solemn Promise, and that you know I never break.' 'Why, prithee, who art engaged to?' cries the Squire. -- Allworthy then informed him, as likewise of the Company. -- 'Odzookers!' answered the Squire, 'I will go with thee, and so shall Sophy; for I will not part with thee tonight; and it would be barbarous to part Tom and the Girl.' This Offer was presently embraced by Allworthy; and Sophia consented, having first obtained a private Promise from her Father, that he would not mention a Syllable concerning her marriage.  CHAP. The last In which the History is concluded. YOUNG Nightingale had been that Afternoon by Appointment to wait on his Father who received him much more kindly than he expected. There likewise he met his Uncle, who was returned to Town in quest of his new married Daughter.  This Marriage was the luckiest Incident which could have happened to the young Gentleman; for these Brothers lived in a constant Contention about the Government of their Children, both heartily despising the Method which each other took. Each of them therefore now endeavored as much as he could to palliate the Offense which his own Child had committed, and to aggravate the Match of the other. This Desire of triumphing over his Brother, added to the many Arguments which Allworthy had used, so strongly operated on the old Gentleman, that he met his Son with a smiling Countenance, and actually agreed to sup with him that Evening at Mrs. Miller's.  As for the other, who really loved his Daughter with the most immoderate Affection, there was little Difficulty in inclining him to a Reconciliation. He was no sooner informed by his Nephew where his Daughter and her Husband were, than he declared he would instantly go to her. And when he arrived there, he scarce suffered her to fall upon her Knees, before he took her up, and embraced her with a Tenderness which affected all who saw him; and in less than a Quarter of an Hour was as well reconciled to both her and her Husband, as if he had himself joined their Hands.  In this Situation were Affairs when Mr. Allworthy and his Company arrived to complete the Happiness of Mrs. Miller, who no sooner saw Sophia, than she guessed every Thing that had happened; and so great was her Friendship to Jones, that it added not a few Transports to those she felt on the Happiness of her own Daughter.  There have not, I believe, been many Instances of a number of People met together, where every one was so perfectly happy, as in this Company. Amongst whom the Father of young Nightingale enjoyed the least perfect Content; for notwithstanding his Affection for his Son, notwithstanding the Authority and the Arguments of Allworthy, together with the other Motive mentiond before, he could not so entirely be satisfied with his Son's Choice; and perhaps the Presence of Sophia herself tended a little to aggravate and heighten his Concern, as a Thought now and then suggested itself, that his Son might have had that Lady, or some such other. Not that any of the Charms which adorned either the Person or Mind of Sophia, created the Uneasiness: It was the Contents of her Father's Coffers which set his Heart a longing. These were the Charms which he could not bear to think his Son had sacrificed to the Daughter of Mrs. Miller.  The Brides were both very pretty Women; but so totally were they eclipsed by the Beauty of Sophia, that had they not been two of the best-tempered Girls in the World, it would have raised some Envy in their Breasts; for neither of their Husbands could long keep his Eyes from Sophia, who sat at the Table like a Queen receiving Homage, or rather like a superior Being receiving Adoration from all around her. But it was an Adoration which they gave, not which she exacted: For she was as much distinguished by her Modesty and Affability, as by all her other Perfections.  The Evening was spent in much true Mirth. All were happy, but those the most, who had been most unhappy before. Their former Sufferings and Fears gave such a Relish to their Felicity, as even Love and Fortune in their fullest Flow could not have given without the Advantage of such a Comparison. Yet as great Joy, especially after a sudden Change and Revolution of Circumstances, is apt to be silent, and dwells rather in the Heart than on the Tongue, Jones and Sophia appeared the least merry of the whole Company. Which Western observed with great Impatience often crying out to them, 'Why do not talk Boy! Why do look so grave! Have lost thy Tongue Girl! Drink another Glass of Wine, shall drink another Glass? And the more to enliven her, he would sometimes sing a merry Song, which bore some Relation to Matrimony, and the Loss of a Maidenhead. Nay, he would have proceeded so far on that Topic, as to have driven her out of the Room, if Mr. Allworthy had not checked him sometimes by Looks, and once or twice by a Fie! Mr. Western. He began indeed once to debate the Matter, and assert his Right to talk to his own Daughter as he thought fit: but as no Body seconded him, he was soon reduced to Order.  Notwithstanding this little Restraint, he was so pleased with the Cheerfulness and Good Humor of the Company, that he insisted on their meeting the next Day at his Lodgings. They all did so; and the lovely Sophia, who was now in private become a Bride too, officiated as the Mistress of the Ceremonies, or, in the polite Phrase, did the Honors of the Table. She had that Morning given her Hand to Jones, in the Chapel at Doctors-Commons, where Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Western, and Mrs. Miller were the only Persons present.  Sophia had earnestly desired her Father, that no others of the Company, who were that Day to dine with him, should be acquainted with her Marriage. The same Secrecy was enjoined to Mrs. Miller, and Jones undertook for Allworthy. This some what reconciled the Delicacy of Sophia to the public Entertainment, which, in Compliance with her Father's Will, she was obliged to go to, greatly against her own Inclinations. In Confidence of this Secrecy, she went through the Day pretty well, till the Squire, who was now advanced into the second Bottle, could contain his Joy no longer, but, filling out a Bumper, drank a Health to the Bride. The Health was immediately pledged by all present, to the great Confusion of poor blushing Sophia, and the great Concern of Jones upon her Account. To say Truth, there was not a Person present made wiser by this Discovery; for Mrs. Miller had whispered it to her Daughter, her Daughter to her Husband, her Husband to his Sister, and she to all the rest.  Sophia now took the first Opportunity of withdraing with the Ladies, and the Squire sat in to his Cups, in which he was, by Degrees, deserted by all the Company, except the Uncle of young Nightingale, who loved his Bottle as well as Western himself. These two therefore sat stoutly to it, during the whole Evening, and long after that happy Hour which had surrendered the charming Sophia to the eager Arms of her enraptured Jones.  Thus, Reader, we have at length brought our History to a Conclusion, in which, to our great Pleasure, though contrary perhaps to thy Expectation, Mr. Jones appears to be the happiest of all human Kind: For what Happiness this World affords equal to the Possession of such a Woman as Sophia, I sincerely own I have never yet discovered.  As to the other Persons who have made any considerable Figure in this History, as some may desire to know a little more concerning them, we will proceed in as few Words as possible, to satisfy their Curiosity.  Allworthy has never yet been prevailed upon to see Blifil, but he has yielded to the Importunity of Jones, backed by Sophia, to settle 200 l. a Year upon him; to which Jones has privately added a third. Upon this Income he lives in one of the northern Counties, about 200 Miles distant from London, and lays up 200 l. a Year out of it, in order to purchase a Seat in the next Parliament from a neighboring Borough, which he has bargained for with an Attorney there. He is also lately turned Methodist, in hopes of marrying a very rich Widow of that Sect, whose Estate lies in that Part of the Kingdom.  Square died soon after he writ the before mentioned Letter; and as to Thwackum, he continues at his Vicarage. He has made many fruitless Attempts to regain the Confidence of Allworthy, or to ingratiate himself with Jones, both of whom he flatters to their Faces, and abuses behind their Backs. But in his stead, Mr. Allworthy has lately taken Mr. Abraham Adams into his House, of whom Sophia is grown immoderately fond, and declares he shall have the Tuition of her Children.  Mrs. Fitzpatrick is separated from her Husband, and retains the little Remains of her Fortune. She lives in Reputation at the polite End of the Town, and is so good an Oeconomist, that she spends three Times the Income of her Fortune, without running in Debt. She maintains a perfect Intimacy with the Lady of the Irish Peer; and in Acts of Friendship to her repays all the Obligations she owes to her Husband.  Mrs. Western was soon reconciled to her Niece Sophia, and has spent two Months together with her in the Country. Lady Bellaston made the latter a formal Visit at her Return to Town, where she behaved to Jones, as to a perfect Stranger, and with great Civility, wished him Joy on his Marriage.  Mr. Nightingale has purchased an Estate for his Son in the Neighborhood of Jones, where the young Gentleman, his Lady, Mrs. Miller, and her little Daughter reside, and the most agreeable Intercourse subsists between the two Families.  As to those of lower Account, Mrs. Waters returned into the Country, had a Pension of 60 l. a Year settled upon her by Mr. Allworthy, and is married to Parson Supple, on whom, at the Instance of Sophia, Western has bestowed a considerable Living.  Black George hearing the Discovery that had been made, run away, and was never since heard of; and Jones bestowed the Money on his Family, but not in equal Proportions, for Molly had much the greatest Share.  As for Partridge, Jones has settled 50 l. a Year on him; and he has again set up a School, in which he meets with much better Encouragement than formerly; and there is now a Treaty of Marriage on Foot, between him and Miss Molly Seagrim, which through the Mediation of Sophia, is likely to take Effect.  We now return to take Leave of Mr. Jones and Sophia, who, within two Days after their Marriage, attended Mr. Western and Mr. Allworthy into the Country. Western has resigned his Family Seat, and the greater Part of his Estate to his Son-in-law, and has retired to a lesser House of his, in another Part of the Country, which is better for Hunting. Indeed he is often as a Visitant with Mr. Jones, who as well as his Daughter, has an infinite Delight in doing every Thing in their Power to please him. And this Desire of theirs is attended with such Success, that the old Gentleman declares he was never happy in his Life till now. He has here a Parlour and Antichamber to himself, where he gets drunk with whom he pleases, and his Daughter is still as ready as formerly to play to him whenever he desires it; for Jones has assured her, that as next to pleasing her, one of his highest Satisfactions is to contribute to the Happiness of the old Man; so the great Duty which she expresses and performs to her Father renders her almost equally dear to him, with the Love which she bestows on himself.  Sophia has already produced him two fine Children, a Boy and a Girl, of whom the old Gentleman is so fond, that he spends much of his Time in the Nursery, where he declares the tattling of his little Granddaughter, who is above a Year and half old, is sweeter Music than the finest Cry of Dogs in England.  Allworthy was likewise greatly liberal to Jones on the Marriage, and has omitted no Instance of showing his Affection to him and his Lady, who love him as a Father. Whatever in the Nature of Jones had a Tendency to Vice, has been corrected by continual Conversation with this good Man, and by his Union with the lovely and virtuous Sophia. He has also, by Reflection on his past Follies, acquired a Discretion and Prudence very uncommon in one of his lively Parts.  To conclude, as there are not to be found a worthier Man and Woman, than this fond Couple, so neither can any be imagined more happy. They preserve the purest and tenderest Affection for each other, an Affection daily increased and confirmed by mutual Esteem. Nor is their Conduct toward their Relations and Friends less amiable, than toward one another. And such is their Condescension, their Indulgence, and their Beneficence to those below them, that there is not a Neighbor, a Tenant, or a Servant, who does not most gratefully bless the Day when Mr. Jones was married to Sophia.  FINIS.
