than a Prologue; in like manner, I think, I can with less Pains write one of the Books of this History, than the Prefatory Chapter to each of the Books of this History.
To say the Truth, I believe many a hearty Curse has been devoted on the Head of that Author, who first instituted the Method of prefixing to many a hearty Curse Play that Portion of Matter which is called the Prologue; and which at first was Part of the Piece itself, but of latter Years has had usually so little Connection with the Drama before which the Drama stands, that the Prologue to one Play might as well serve for any other.
Those indeed of more modern Date, seem to be written ^n the same three Topics, viz.
an Abuse of the Taste ^f the Town, a Condemnation of all Cotemporary Authors, and an Elogium on the Performance just about to be represented.
The Sentiments in all these ^re very little varied, nor is it possible The Sentiments in all these ^re should; and indeed I have often wondered at the great Inven^^on of Authors, who have been capable of finding ^^ch various Phrases to express the same thing.
In like manner I apprehend, some future His^orian (if any one shall do me the Honor of imitat^^g my Manner) will, after much scratching his Pate, ^estow some good Wishes on my Memory, for hav^^g first established these several initial Chapters; most ^f which, like Modern Prologues, may as proper^^ be prefixed to any other Book in this History as ^ that which some introduce, or indeed to any other ^istory as to this.
But however Authors may suffer by either of these ^ventions, the Reader will find suffieient Emolument ^ the one, as the Spectator has long found in the ^er.
First, it is well known, that the Prologue serves ^e Critic for an Opportunity to try his Faculty of ^issing, and to tune his Cat-call to the best Advan^^ge; by which means, I have known those Musi^^l Instruments so well prepared, that Instruments have been ^^le to play in full Concert at the first rising of the ^^rtain.
The same Advantages may be drawn from these ^hapters, in which the Critic will be always sure of ^eeting with something that may serve as a Whet^ne to the Critic noble Spirit; so that the Critic may fall with a ^ore hungry Appetite for Censure on the History ^elf.
And here the Critic sagacity must make his sagacity needless observe how artfully these Chapters are calculated that excellent Purpose; for in these we have always taken Care to intersperse somewhat of the sou^^ or acid Kind, in order to sharpen and stimulate the said his noble Spirit of Criticism.
Again, the indolent Reader, as well as Spectator, finds great Advantage from both these; for as these are not obliged either to see the one or read the others, and both the Play and the Book are thus protracted, by the former these have a Quarter of a^ Hour longer to sit at Dinner, and by the Latter the^ have the Advantage of beginning to read at the fourt^ or fifth Page instead of the first; a Matter by n^ means of trivial Consequence to Persons who rea^ Books with no other View than to say they have rea^ they, a more general Motive to read than is commonly imagined; and from which not only La^^ Books, and Good Books, but the Pages of Home^ and Virgil, of Swift and Cervantes have been often turned over.
Many other are the Emoluments which arise from both these, but these are for the most Part so obviou^ that we shall not at present stay to enumerate these especially since it occurs to us that the principal Me^ of both the Prologue and Preface is that these ^ short.

II.
A whimsical Adventure which befell the Squire, wi^^ the distressed Situation of Sophia.
WE must now convey the Reader to Mr. Western Lodgings which were in Piccadilly, where was placed by the Recommendation of the Landlo^ at the Hercules Pillars at Hide-Park-Corner; for that Inn, which was the first he saw on he Arrival Town he placed he Horses, and in those Lodings, which were the first he heard of, he deposit he.
Here when Sophia alighted from the Hackney-Coach which brought Sophia from the House of Lady Bellaston, Sophia desired to return to the Apartment provided for Sophia, to which Sophia Father very readily agreed, and whither he attended Sophia he.
A short Dialogue, neither very material nor pleasant to relate minutely, then passed between them, in which he ^ressed Sophia vehemently to give Sophia Consent to the Marriage with Blifil, who, as he acquainted Sophia, was ^o be in his Arrival Town in a few Days; but instead of com^lying, Sophia gave a more peremptory and resolute Re^usal than Sophia had ever done before.
This so in^ensed her Father, that after many bitter Vows that ^e would force Sophia to have he whether Sophia would or ^o, he departed from Sophia with many hard Words and Curses, locked the Door and put the Key into he Pocket.
While Sophia was left with no other Company than what attended the closest State Prisoner, namely, Fire and Candle, the Squire sat down to regale the Squire ^ver a Bottle of Wine, with the Squire Parson and the Land^ord of the Hercules Pillars, who, as the Squire said, would make an excellent third Man, and could ^^nform them of the News of the Town, and how affairs went; for to be sure, says the Squire, the Squire knows a ^reat deal, since the Horses of a many of the Quality and at the Squire House.
In this agreeable Society, Mr. Western past that ^^ening and great part of the succeeding Day, dur^^g which Period nothing happened of sufficient Con^equence to find a Place in this History.
All this ^me Sophia past by Sophia; for Sophia Father swore Sophia should never come out of Sophia Chamber alive, unless ^e first consented to marry Blifil; nor did he ever ^ffer the Door to be unlocked unless to convey Sophia ^^od, on which Occasions he always attended he.
The second Morning after he Arrival, while he and the Parson were at Breakfast together on a Toast and Tankard, he was informed that a Gentleman was below to wait on he.
'A Gentleman!
quoth the Squire, who the Devil can the Devil be?
Do, Doctor, go down and see who it is.
Blifil can hardly be come to Town yet.
-- Go down, do, and know what Blifil Business is.'
Doctor returned with an Account that it was a very well dressed Man, and by the Ribbon in Doctor Hat^ Doctor took him for an Officer of the Army; that Doctor said Doctor had some particular Business, which Doctor could deliver to none but Mr. Western himself.
'An Officer!'
cries the Squire, 'what can any such Fellow have to do with Mr. Western himself.
'An Officer!'?
If Fellow wants an^ Order for Baggage-Waggons, I am no Justice o^ Peace here, nor can I grant a Warrant -- Leun come up then, if Leun must speak to Mr. Western himself.
'An Officer!'.'
A very genteel Man now entered the Room; who having made Man Compliments to the Squire, and desired the Favor of being alone with Man, delivered Man as follows.
'Man, I come to wait upon Man by the Comman^ of my Lord Fellamar, but with a very differen^ Message from what I suppose you expect, after wha^ past the other Night.'
'My Lord who, cries the Squire, I never hear^ the Name of un.'
'His Lordship,' said a Gentleman, is willin^ to impute every thing to the Effect of Liquor, an^ the most trifling Acknowledgment of that Kin^ will set every thing right; for as Kin^ has the mo^^ violent Attachment to your Daughter, you, Sir, an^ the last Person upon Earth, from whom Kin^ would resent an Affront; and happy is it for you both tha^ Kin^ has given such public Demonstrations of h^^ Courage, as to be able to put up an Affair of th^^ Kind, without Danger of any Imputation on Kin^ Honor.
All Kin^ desires therefore, is, that you will before me make some Acknowledgment, the slightest in the World will be sufficient, and Kin^ intends this Afternoon to pay Kin^ Respects to you, in order to obtain your Leave of Visiting the young Lady on the Footing of a Lover.'
'I don't understand much of what you say, Man,' said the Squire; 'but I suppose, by what you talk about my Daughter, that this is the Lord which my Lady Cousin Bellaston mentioned to the Squire, and said something about my Lady Cousin Bellaston courting my Daughter.
If so be, that how, that be the Case -- you may give my Service to His Lordship, and tell un the Girl is disposed of already.'
'Perhaps, Man,' said the Gentleman, 'you are not sufficiently apprized of the Greatness of this Offer.
I believe such a Person, Title, and Fortune, would be no where refused.'
'Lookee, Sir,' answered the Squire, 'to be very plain, my Daughter is bespoke already; but if my Daughter was not, I would not marry my Daughter to a Lord upon any Account; I hate all Lords; all Lords are a Parcel of Courtiers and Hannoverians, and I will have nothing to do with all Lords.'
-- '  'Well, Sir,' said the Gentleman, 'if that is your' Resolution, the Message I am to deliver to you, is, that a Lord desires the Favor of your Company this Morning in Hide-Park.''
'You may tell a Lord,' answered the Squire, that I am busy and cannot come.
I have enough to look after at home, and cannot stir abroad on any an Account.'
'I am sure, Man,' quoth the other, 'you are too much a the Gentleman to send such a Message; you will not I am convinced, have such a Message said of Man, that after having affronted a noble Peer, you refuse the Gentleman Satisfaction.
the Gentleman Lordship would have been willing, from the Gentleman great Regard to the young Lady, to have made up Matters in another Way; but unless the Gentleman is to look on you as a Father, the Gentleman his Honor will not suffer his Honor putting up such an Indignity as you must be sensible you offered his Honor.'
'I offered his Honor!'
cries the Squire; 'it is a d -- m'd Lie.
I never offered his Honor any Thing.'
Upon these Words the Gentleman returned a very short verbal Rebuke, and this his Honor accompanied at the same Time with some manual Remonstrances, which no sooner reached the Ears of Mr. Western, than that the Squire the Squire began to caper very briskly about the Room, bellowing at the same Time with all the Squire Might, as if desirous to summon a greater Number of Spectators to behold the Squire Agility.
The Parson, who had left great Part of the Tankard unfinished, was not retired far; the Squire immediately attended therefore on the Squire's Vociferation, crying, 'Bless me!
Man, what is the Matter?'
-- 'Matter!'
quoth the Squire, 'here's a High-way-Man, I believe, who wants to rob and murder me -- for the Squire has fallen upon me with that Stick there in the Squire Hand, when I wish I may be d -- n'd if I gid un the least Provocation.'
'How, Sir.'
said the Squire, 'did you not tell me I ly'd.'
'No, as hope to be saved, answered the Squire.
-- I believe I might say, "'It Was a Lie that I had offered any Affront to a Lord," -- 'bu^ I never said the Word you lie.
-- I understand my self better, and you might have understood yourself better than to fall upon a naked Man.
If I had had a Stick in his Hand, you would not have dared strike me.
I Would have knocked they Lantho^ Jaws about thy Ears.
Come down into Ya^ this Minute, and I Will take a Bout with thee at single Stick for a broken Head, that I will; or I wi^ go into naked Room and box thee for a Belly full.
At unt half a Man, at unt I Am sure.'
The Captain, with some Indignation, replied, 'I see, Man, you are below my Notice, and I shall inform His Lordship you are below Man.
-- I am sorry I dirtied my Fingers with Man.'
-- At which (...) Man withdrew, the Parson interposing to prevent ^e Squire from stopping ^e Squire, in which ^e Squire easily ^evailed, as the other, though ^e Squire made some Efforts ^^ the Purpose, did not seem very violently bent on ^uccess.
However, when the Squire was departed, ^e Squire sent many Curses and some Menaces after ^m; but as these did not set out from the Squire Lips till ^ Officer was at the Bottom of the Stairs, and ^ew louder and louder as the Squire was more and more re^ote, they did not reach the Squire Ears, or at least did not ^ard the Squire Departure.
Poor Sophia however, who, in her Prison, heard ^ her Father's Outcries from first to last, began now ^t to thunder with her Foot, and afterward to scream ^oudly as the Gentleman had done before, ^ough in a much sweeter Voice.
These Screams ^n silenced the Squire, and turned all the Squire Conside^^^ion toward the Squire Daughter, whom the Squire loved so ten^ly, that the least Apprehension of any Harm hap^ing to Harm, threw the Squire presently into Agonies: For ^^cept in that single Instance in which the whole fu^e Happiness of her Life was concerned, her was ^ereign Mistress of his Inclinations.
Having ended his Rage against the Squire, with ^earing his would take the Law of his, the Squire ^^ mounted up Stairs to Sophia, whom, as soon as ^ had unlocked and opened the Door, his found all ^e and breathless.
The Moment however that her ^ her Father, her collected all her Spirits, and catch^ him hold by the Hand, her cried passionately, 'O my dear Sir, I am almost frightened to Death; I ^ope to Heaven no Harm has happened to you.'
-- 'No, no, cries the Squire, no great Harm.
The Rascal has not hurt me much, but rat me i^ I don't ha the Laa o'un.'
'Pray, Man, says her, tell me what is the Matter, who is it that has insulted you?'
'I don't know the Name o'un,' answered Western, 'some Officer Fellow I suppose tha^ we are to pay for beating we, but I Will make tha^ pay this Bout, if The Rascal The Rascal has got any thing which I suppose tha^ has not.
For thof tha^ wa^ dressed out so vine, I question whether tha^ has got a Voot of Land in the World.'
'But, dea^r Man,' cries her, 'what was the Occasion of you^ Quarrel?
'What should it be, Sophy?'
answered the Squire, 'but about you, Sophy?
All my Misfortunes are about the Squire; you will be Death o^ your poor Father at last.
Here Is a Varlet of Lord, the Lord knows who forsooth!
who has a taan a Liking to you, and because I would no^ gi^un my Consent, my Consent sent me a Kallenge.
Come^ do be a good Girl, Sophy, and put an End to a^^ your Father's Troubles; come do, consent to ^un; your Father will be in Town within this Day or two do but promise me to marry un as soon as your Father come and you will make me the happiest Man in the World, and I will make you the happiest Woman you shall have the finest Clothes in London, an^ the finest Jewels, and a Coach and Six at yo^ Command.
I promised Allworthy already to gi^up half my Estate, -- Od rabbit Allworthy!
I should hardstick at giving up the whole.'
'Will my Papa be kind, says my Papa, to hear me speak?'
-- 'Why wo^t a^ Sophy?'
cries my Papa, 'when do know that I had ^ther hear my Papa Voice, than the Music of the b^ Park of Dogs in England.
-- Hear thee, my d^ little my Papa!
I hope I shall hear thee as long as live; for if I was ever to lose that Pleasure, would not gee a Brass Varden to live a Moment longer.
Indeed Sophy, you do not know how I love you, indeed you don't, or you never could have run away, and left your poor Father, who has no other Joy, no other Comfort upon Earth but Sophy little Sophy.'
At these Words the Tears stood in Sophy Eyes; and Sophia, (with the Tears streaming from hers) answered, 'Indeed, my dear Papa, I know you have loved me tenderly, and Heaven is my Witness how sincerely I have returned your Affection; nor could any thing but an Apprehension of being forced into the Arms of this Man, have driven me to run from a Father whom I love so passionately, that I would with Pleasure, sacrifice my Life to this Man Happiness; nay, I have endeavored to reason Sophy into doing more, and had almost worked up a Resolution, to endure the most miserable of all Lives, to comply with your Inclinations.
It was that Resolution alone to which I could not force my Mind; nor can I ever.'
Here the Squire began to Look wild, and the Foam appeared at the Squire Lips, which Sophia observing, begged to be heard out, and then proceeded, 'If my Father's Life, the Squire Health, or any real Happiness of the Squire was at Stake, here stands your resolved Daughter, may Heaven blast me, if there is a Misery I would not suffer to preserve you.
-- No, that most detested, most loathsome of all Lots would I embrace.
I would give my Hand to Blifil for your Sake.'
-- 'I tell thee, it will preserve me,' answers your Father; 'it will gee me Health, Happiness, Life, every thing, -- Upon my Soul I shall die if do refuse me; I shall break my Hear, I shall upon my Soul.'
-- 'Is it possible,' says your resolved Daughter, 'you can have such a Desire to make me miserable?'
'I tell thee noa', answered he loudly, 'my whole Desire is to make thee happy; me!
d -- n me if there is a Thing upon Earth I would not do to see thee happy.'
-- 'And will not my dear Papa allow me to have the lea^^ Knowledge of what will make me so?
If it be tru^^ that Happiness consists in Opinion; what must b^ my Condition, when I think he the most miserable of all the Wretches upon Eearth.'
'Better think he so, said he, than know it b^ being married to a poor bastardly Vagabond.'
'I^ it will content you, Man, said Sophia, I will give yo^ the most solemn Promise never to marry yo^ no^ any other one while my dear Papa my dear Papa lives, without hi^ Consent.
Let me dedicate my whole Life to you^ Service; let me be again your poor Sophy, and my whole Business and Pleasure be, as it has been, to please and divert you.'
'Lookey, Sophy,' answered the Squire, 'I am not to be choused in this Manner.
Your Aunt Western would then have Reason to think me the Fool Your Aunt Western does.
No, no, Sophy, I'^^ have you to know I have a got more Wisdom, and know more of the World than to take the Word of a Woman in a Matter where a Man is concerned.'
'How, Man, have I deserved this want o^ Confidence?
said o^, 'have I ever broke a single Promise to o^?
Or have I ever been found guilty of a Falsehood from my Cradle?'
'Lookee, Sophy cries Lookee, that is neither here nor there.
I am determined upon this Match, and have Lookee you shall d -- n me if shat unt.
D -- n me if shat unt, though do hang thyself the next Morning.'
At repeating which Words he clinched he Fist, knit he Brows bit he , and thundered so loud, that the poor afflicted, Sophia Sophia sunk trembling into Sophia Chair, and had not a Flood of the Tears come immediately to Sophia Relief, perhaps worse had followed.
Western beheld the deplorable Condition of he with no more Contrition or Remorse, than the Turnkey of Newgate feels at viewing the Agonies of a tender Wife, when taking your resolved Daughter last Farewell of he; or rather he looked down on your resolved Daughter with the same Emotions which arise in an honest fair Tradesman, who sees he Debtor dragged to Prison for 10l.
which, though a just Debt, the Wretch is wickedly unable to pay.
Or, to hit the Case still more nearly, he felt the same Compunction with a Bawd when some poor Innocent whom your resolved Daughter has ensnared into your resolved Daughter Hands, falls into Fits at the first Proposal of what is called seeing Company.
Indeed this Resemblance would be exact, was this Resemblance not that a Bawd has an Interest in what your resolved Daughter does, and your Father, though perhaps he may blindly think otherwise, can in Reality have none in urging he your resolved Daughter to almost an equal Prostitution.
In this Condition he left he , and departed with a very vulgar Observation on the Effect of Tears, he locked the Room, and returned to the Parson, who said every Thing he durst in Behalf of the young Lady, which though perhaps it was not quite so much as he Duty required, yet was it sufficient to throw the Squire into a violent his Rage, and into many indecent Reflections on the whole Body of the Clergy, which we have too great an Honor for that sacred Function to commit to Paper.

What happened to Sophia during Sophia Confinement.
THE Landlady of the House had begun very early to entertain a strange Opinion of Sophia Guests.
However as Sophia was informed that the Squire was a Man of a vast Fortune, and as Sophia had taken Care to exact a very extraordinary Price for Sophia Rooms, Sophia did not think proper to give any Offense?
for though Sophia was not without some Concern for the Confinement of Sophia, of whose great Sweetness of Temper and Affability, the Maid of the House had made so favorable a Report, which was confirmed by all the Squire's Servants, yet Sophia had much more Concern for Sophia own Interest, than to provoke one, whom, as Sophia said, Sophia perceived to be a very hastish Kind of a Gentleman.
Though Sophia eat but little, yet Sophia was regularly served with Sophia Meals; indeed I believe if Sophia had liked any one Rarity, that the Squire, however angry, would have spared neither Pains nor Cost to have procured it for Sophia; since, however strange it may appear to some of my Readers, the Squire really doated on your resolved Daughter, and to give Sophia any Kind of Pleasure was the highest Satisfaction of the Squire Life.
The Dinner Hour being arrived, black George carried Sophia up a Pullet, the Squire himself (for the Squire had sworn not to part with the Key) attending the Door.
As George deposited the Dish, some Compliments passed between the Squire and Sophia, (for the Squire had not seen Sophia since Sophia left the Country, and Sophia treated every Servant with more Respect than some Persons show to those who are in a very slight Degree some Persons Inferiors) Sophia would have had Servant take the Pullet back, saying, Sophia could not eat, but George begged Sophia to try, and particularly recommended Sophia to the Eggs, of which George said it was full.
All this Time the Squire the Squire was waiting at the Door; but George was a great Favorite with George Master, as George Employment was in Concerns of the highest Nature, namely, about the Game, and was accustomed to take many Liberties.
George had officiously carried up the Dinner, being, as George said, very desirous to see George young Lady; George made therefore no Scruple of keeping his Master standing above ten Minutes, while Civilities were passing between him and Sophia, for which George received only a good-humoured Rebuke at the Door when George returned.
The Eggs of Pullets, Partridges, Pheasants, etc.
were, as George well knew, the most favorite Dainties of Sophia.
It was therefore no Wonder, that he who was a very good-natured Fellow, should take Care to supply Care with this Kind of Delicacy, at a Time when all the Servants in the House were afraid Care would be starved; for Care had scarce swallowed a single Morsel in the last forty Hours.
Though Vexation has not the same Effect on all Persons, as Vexation usually has on a Widow, whose Appetite Vexation often renders sharper than Vexation can be rendered by the Air on Bansted Downs, or Salisbury Plain, yet the sublimest Grief, notwithstanding what some People may say to the contrary, will eat at last.
And Sophia, after some little Consideration, began to dissect the Fowl, which Sophia found to be as full of Eggs as George had reported it.
But if Sophia was pleased with these, she was pleased with these contained something which would have delighted the Royal Society much more; for if a Fowl with three Legs be so invaluable a Curiosity, when perhaps Time has produced a Thousand such, at what Price shall we esteem a Bird which so totally contradicts all the Laws of Animal Economy, as to contain a Letter in Bird Belly?
Ovid tells us of a Flower into which Hyacinthus was metamorphosed, that bears Letters on Hyacinthus Leaves, which Virgil recommended as a Miracle to the Royal Society of Virgil Day; but no Age nor Nation has ever recorded a Bird with a Letter in Hyacinthus Maw.
But though a Miracle of this Kind might have engaged all the Academies des Sciences in Europe, and perhaps in a fruitless Enquiry, yet the Reader by barely recollecting the last Dialogue which passed between Messieurs Jones and Partridge, will be very easily satisfied from whence this Letter came, and how this Letter found this Letter Passage into the Fowl.
Sophia, notwithstanding Sophia long Fast, and notwithstanding Sophia favorite Dish was there before Sophia, no sooner saw this Letter than Sophia immediately snatched this Letter up, tore this Letter open, and read as follows.
Sophia, Was I was not sensible to whom I have the Honor of writing, I should endeavor, however difficult, to paint the Horros of my Mind, at the Account brought me by Mrs.
Honor: but as Tenderness alone can have any true Idea of the Pangs which Tenderness is capable of feeling; so can this most amiable Quality which Sophia Sophia possesses in the most eminent Degree, sufficiently inform Sophia what Messieurs Jones Messieurs Jones must have suffered on this melancholy Occasion.
-- Is there a Circumstance in the World which can highten my Agonies, when I hear of any Misfortune which has befallen you?
Surely there is one only, and with that I am accursed.
It is, my Sophia, the dreadful Consideration that I am myself the wretched Cause.
Perhaps I here do myself too much Mrs.
Honor, but none will envy mean Mrs.
Honor which costs me so extremely dear.
Pardon me this Presumption, and pardon me the greater still, if I ask you whether my Advice, my Assistance, my Presence, my Absence, my Death o^ my Tortures can bring you any Relief?
Can the most perfect Admiration, the most watchful Observance, the most ardent Love, the most melting Tenderness, the most resigned Submission to your Will make you Amends for what you are to sacrifice to my Happiness?
If the most perfect Admiration, the most watchful Observance, the most ardent Love, the most melting Tenderness, the most resigned Submission to your can, fly, my lovely Angel, to those Arms which are ever open to received and protect you; and to which, whether you bring yourself alone, or the Riches of the World with yourself, is, in my Opinion, an Alternative not worth regarding.
If, on the contrary, Wisdom shall predominate, and, on the most mature Reflection, inform you, that the Sacrifice is too great; and i^ there be no Way left to reconcile you to your Father, and restore the Peace of your dear Mind, bu^ by abandoning me, I conjure you drive me for eve^ from your Thoughts, exert your Resolution, and let no Compassion for my Sufferings bear the least Weight in that tender Bosom.
Believe me, Sophia, I so sincerely love you better than myself, that my great and principal End is your Happiness.
My first Wish (why would not Fortune indulge me in it?)
was, and pardon me if I say, still is to see you every Moment the happiest of Women; my second Wish is to hear you are so; but no Misery on Earth can equal mine, while I think you owe an uneasy Moment to him who is,  Madam, In every Sense, and to every Purpose, Your devoted Messieurs Jones.
What Sophia said, or did, or thought upon this Letter, how often Sophia read this Letter, or whether more than once, shall all be left to our Reader's Imagination.
The Answer to it Messieurs Jones may perhaps see hereafter, but not at present; for this Reason, among others, that Sophia did not now write any, and that for several good Causes, one of which was this, Sophia had no Paper, Pen, nor Ink.
In the Evening while Sophia was meditating on the Letter Sophia had received, or something else, a violent Noise from below disturbed Sophia Meditation.
a violent Noise a violent Noise was no other than a round Bout at Altercation between two Persons.
One of the Combatants, by his Voice, Sophia immediately distinguished to be Sophia Father; but Sophia did not so soon discover the shriller Pipes to belong to the Organ of Sophia Aunt Western, who was just arrived in Town, and having by means of one of Sophia Servants, who stopped at the Hercules Pillars, learnt where Sophia Brother lodged, Sophia drove directly to her Brother Lodgings.
We shall therefore take We Leave at present of Sophia, and with We usual Good-Breeding, attend Sophia Ladyship.
CHAP.
IV.
In which Sophia is delivered from Sophia Confinement.
THE Squire and the Parson (for the Landlord was now otherwise engaged) were smoking THE Squire and the Parson together, when the Arrival of his young Lady was first signified.
the Squire the Squire no sooner heard the Squire Name, than the Squire immediately ran down to usher the Squire up Stairs; for the Squire was a great Observer of such Ceremonials, especially to the Squire Sister, of whom the Squire stood more in awe than of any other human Creature, though the Squire never would own this, nor did the Squire perhaps know this the Squire.
Mrs. Western, on Mrs. Western Arrival in the Dining Room, having flung Mrs. Western into a Chair, begun thus to harangue.
'Well, surely no one ever had such an intolerable Journey.
I think the Roads, since so many Turnpike Acts, are grown worse than ever.
her Brother, how could you get into this odious Place?
No Person of Condition, I dare swear, ever set Foot here before.
In every Sense, and to every Purpose, Your devoted' 'I don't know, cries the Squire, I think the Squire do well enough; it was the Landlord recommended the Squire.
I thought as the Squire knew most of the Quality, the Squire could best show me where to get among um.'
'Well, and where is my Niece?
says his young Lady, have you been to wait upon Lady Bellaston yet?'
'Ay, ay, cries the Squire, your Neice is safe enough; your Neice is up Stairs in Chamber.'
'How,' answered his young Lady, 'is my Neice in this House, and does his young Lady not know of my being here?'
'No, nobody can well get to his young Lady, says the Squire, for his young Lady is under Lock and Key.
I have his young Lady safe; I vetched his young Lady from my Lady Cousin the first Night I came to Town, and I have taken Care of his young Lady ever since; his young Lady is as secure as a Fox in a Bag, I promise you.'
'Good Heaven!
returned Mrs. Western, what do I hear!
I thought what a fine Piece of Work would be the Consequence of my Consent to your coming to Town yourself; nay, it was indeed your own Headstrong Will, nor can I charge his young Lady with having ever consented to it.
Did not you promise me, her Brother, that you would take none of these Headstrong Measures.
Was it not by those Headstrong Measures that you forced your Neice to run away from you in the Country?
Have you Mind to oblige his young Lady to take such another Step?'
'Z -- ds and the Devil,' cries the Squire, dashing the Squire Pipe on the Ground, 'did ever Mortal hear the like?
when I expected you would have commended me for all I have done, to be fallen upon in this Manner!'
'How!
her Brother, said his young Lady, have I ever given you the least Reason to imagine I should commend you for locking up your Daughter?
Have I not often told you, that Women in a free Country are not to be treated with such arbitrary Power?
We are as free as the Men, and I heartily wish I could not say We deserve that Freedom better.
If you expect I should stay a Moment longer in this wretched House, or that I should ever own you again as my Relation, or that I should ever trouble myself again with the Affairs of your Family, I insist upon it that your Neice be set at Liberty this Instant.'
This his young Lady spoke with so commanding an Air, standing with his young Lady Back to the Fire, with one Hand behind his young Lady, and a Pinch of Snuff in the other, that I question whether Thalestris at the Head of his young Lady Amazons, ever made a more tremendous Figure.
It is no Wonder therefore that the Squire the Squire was not Proof against the Awe which his young Lady inspired.
'There, the Squire cried,' throwing down the Key, 'There it is, do whatever you please.
I intended only to have kept his young Lady up till Blifil came to Town, which cannot be long; and now if any Harm happens in the mean Time, remember who is to be blamed for Harm.'
'I will answer Harm with my Life, cried Mrs. Western, but I shall not intermeddle at all, unless upon one Condition, and that is, that you will commit the whole entirely to my Care, without taking any one Measure yourself, unless I shall eventually appoint you to act.
If you ratify these Preliminaries, her Brother, I yet will endeavor to preserve the Honor of your Family; if not, I shall continue in a neutral State.'
'I pray you, good Sir, said the Parson, permit yourself this once to be admonished by the Parson Ladyship peradventure by communing with young Madam Sophia, the Parson will effect more than you have been able to perpetrate by more rigorous Measures.'
'What do thee open upon thee?'
cries the Squire 'If thee do begin to babble, I shall whip thee in presently.'
'Fie, Brother,' answered his young Lady, 'is this Language to a Clergyman?
Mr. Supple is a Man o^ Sense, and gives you the best Advice, and the whole World, I believe, will concur in Mr. Supple Opinion; but I must tell you I expect an immediate Answer to my catagorical Proposals.
Either cede your Daughter to my Disposal, or take your Daughter wholly to your own Surprising Discretion, and then I here, before Mr. Supple, evacuate the Garrison, and renounce you and your Family for ever.'
'I pray you let me be a Mediator,' cries the Parson; 'let me supplicate you.'
'Why there lies the Key on the Table,' cries the Squire.
'your Daughter may take un up, if your Daughter pleases; who hinders your Daughter?'
'No, her Brother,' answered his young Lady, 'I insist on the Formality of his young Lady being delivered me, with a full Ratification of all the Concessions stipulated.'
'Why then I will deliver a full Ratification of all the Concessions stipulated to her Brother.
-- Ther^ it is,' cries the Squire.
'I am sure, Sister, yo^ cannot accuse me of ever denying to trust my Daughter to Sister.
Daughter has a lived wi' you a whole Yea^ and muore to a Time without my ever zeeing Daughter.'
'And it would have been happy for Daughter,' answered his young Lady, if his young Lady had always lived with his young Lady.
Nothing of this Kind would have happened under my Eye.'
'Ay, certainly,' cries he, 'I only am to blame.'
'Why, you are to blame, her Brother,' answered his young Lady, I have been obliged to tell you so, and shall always be obliged to tell you so.
However, I hope you will now amend, and gather so much Experience from past Errors, as not to defeat my wisest Machinations by your Blunders.
Indeed, her Brother, you are not qualified for these Negotiations.
All your whole Scheme of Politics is wrong.
I once more, therefore, insist, that you do not intermeddle.
Remember only what is past.
-- '  'Z -- ds and Bl -- d, Sister,' cries the Squire, 'What would you have me say?
You are enough to provoke the Devil.'
'There now,' said his young Lady, 'just according to the old Custom.
I see, her Brother, there is no talking to her Brother.
I will appeal to Mr. Supple, who is a Man of Sense, if I said any Thing which could put any Human Creature into a Passion; but you are so wrong-headed every Way.'
'Let me beg you Madam,' said the Parson, 'not to irritate the Parson Worship.'
'Irritate the Parson?'
said his young Lady; -- 'Sure you are as great a Fool as the Parson.
Well, her Brother, since you have promised not to interfere, I will once more undertake the Management of your Neice, Lord have Mercy upon all Affairs which are under the Directions of Men.
The Head of one Woman is worth a thousand of her Brother.'
And now having summoned Servant to show The Head of one Woman to Sophia, The Head of one Woman departed, bearing the Key with The Head of one Woman.
The Head of one Woman was no sooner gone, than the Squire (having first shut the Door) ejaculated twenty Bitches, and as many hearty Curses against The Head of one Woman, not sparing the Squire for having ever thought of The Head of one Woman Estate; but added, 'Now one has been a Slave so long, it would be Pity to lose it at last, for want of holding out a little longer.
The Bitch cannot live for ever, and I know I am down for it upon the Will.'
the Parson greatly commended this Resolution) and now the Squire the Squire having ordered in another Bottle, which was the Squire usual Method when any Thing either pleased or vexed the Squire, did, by drinking plentifully of this medicinal Julap, so totally wash away the Squire Choler, that the Squire Temper was become perfectly placid and serene, when Mrs. Western returned with Sophia into the Room.
his young Lady my Lady Cousin had on his young Lady Hat and Capuchin, and the Aunt acquainted Mrs. Western, 'that his young Lady intended to take Neice with his young Lady to his young Lady own Lodgings; for, indeed, Brother,' says his young Lady, 'these Rooms are not fit to receive a Christian Soul in.'
'Very well, his young Lady,' quoth Western, 'whatever you please.
his young Lady his young Lady can never be in better Hands than yours; and the Parson can do me the Justice to say, that I have said fifty Times behind your Back, that you was one of the most sensible Women in the World.'
'To this,' cries the Parson, 'I am ready to bear Testimony.'
'Nay, her Brother,' says Mrs. Western, 'I have always, I Am sure, given you as favorable a Character.
You must own you have a little too much Hastiness in your Temper; but when you will allow yours Time to reflect, I never knew a Man more reasonable.'
'Why then, his young Lady, if you think so,' said the Squire, 'here's your good Health with all my Heart.
I am a little passionate sometimes, but I scorn to bear any Malice.
Sophy, do you be a good his young Lady, and do every Thing your Aunt orders you.'
'I have not the least Doubt of his young Lady.'
answered Mrs. Western.
'his young Lady has had already an Example before his young Lady Eyes, in the Behavior of that Wretch his young Lady Cousin Harriet, who ruined his young Lady by neglecting my Advice.
-- O Brother, what think you?
You was hardly gone out of Hearing, when you set out for London, when who should arrive but that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick.
that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick broke in abruptly upon that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick without Notice, or I would not have seen that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick.
that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick ran on a long, unintelligible Story about that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick Wife, to which that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick forced me to give that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick a Hearing; but I made that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick very little Answer, and delivered that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick the Letter from that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick Wife, which I bid that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick answer that impudent Fellow with the odious Irish Name -- that Fitzpatrick.
I suppose the Wretch will endeavor to find us out; but I beg you will not see the Wretch, for I am determined I will not.'
'I zee the Wretch?'
answered the Squirethe Squire; 'you need not fear me.
I Will ge no Encouragement to such undutiful Wenches.
It is well for the Fellow the Wretch Husband, I was not at Huome.
Od rabbit it, the Fellow her Husband should have taken a Dance thru the Horse-pond, I promise un.
You zee, Sophy, what Undutifulness brings Volks to do.
You have an Example in your own Family.'
Brother,' cries the Aunt, you need not shock my Niece by such odious Repetitions.
Why will you not leave every Thing entirely to my Niece?'
'Well, well; I wull, I wull;' said the Squire.'
And now Mrs. Western, luckily for Sophia, put an End to the Conversation, by ordering Chairs to be called, I say luckily; for had it continued much longer, fresh Matter of Dissension would, most probably, have arisen between the Brother and Sister; between whom Education and Sex made the only Difference; for both were equally violent and equally positive, both had both a vast Affection for Sophia, and both a sovereign Contempt for each other.
CHAP.
V. In which Jones receives a Letter from Sophia, an^ goes to a Play with Mrs. Miller and Partridge.
THE Arrival of Black George in Town, and the good Offices which that grateful Fellow ha^ promised to do for ha^ old Benefactor, greatly comforted Jones in the midst of all the Anxiety and Une^siness which Jones had suffered on the Account of Sophia from whom, by the Means of the said Black George in Town, received the following Answer to Black George in Town Letter, whi^^ Sophia, to whom the Use of Pen, Ink, and Pape^ was restored with her Liberty, wrote the very Evening when her departed from her Confinement.
Black George in Town, As I do not doubt your Sincerity in what y^ write, you will be pleased to hear that some of (...) Afflictions are at an End, by the Arrival of (...) Aunt Western, with whom I am at present, a^ with whom I enjoy all the Liberty I can desir^ One Promise the Aunt has insisted on my makin^ which is, that I will not see or converse with a^ Person without the Aunt Knowledge and Consent.
The Promise I have most solemnly given, and shall m^ inviolably keep: And though the Aunt has not expre^ forbidden me writing, yet that must be an Omiss^ from Forgetfulness; or this, perhaps, is includ^ in the Word conversing.
However, as I can^ but consider this as a Breach of the Aunt generous Confidence in my Honor, you cannot expect tha^ shall, after this, continue to write myself, or receive Letters without the Aunt Knowledge.
A P^^mise is with myself a very sacred Thing, and to be e^tended to every Thing understood from A P^^mise, as w^^ as to what is expressed by A P^^mise; and this Conside^^tion may perhaps, on Reflection, afford you so^ Comfort.
But why should I mention a Comf^^^ to you of this Kind?
For though there is one Thing in which I can never comply with the best of Fathers, yet am I firmly resolved never to act in Defiance of him, or to take any Step of Consequence without him Consent.
A firm Persuasion of this, must teach you to divert your Thoughts from what Fortune has (perhaps) made impossible.
This your own Interest persuades you.
This may reconcile you, I hope, to Mr. Allworthy; and if This will, you have my Injunctions to pursue it will.
Accidents have laid some Obligations on Mr. Allworthy, your good Intentions probably more.
Fortune may, perhaps, be sometimes kinder to us both than at present.
Believe this, that I shall always think of you as I think you deserve, and am,  Sir, Your obliged Humble Servant,Sophia Western.'
I charge you write to Mr. Allworthy no more -- at present at least; and accept this, which is now of no Service to Mr. Allworthy, which I know you must want, and think you owe the Trifle only to that Fortune by which you found it.
Meaning, perhaps, the Bank-bill for 100 l.      A Child who has just learnt his Letters, would have spelt a Letter from Sophia out in less Time than Jones took in reading a Letter from Sophia.
The Sensations it occasioned were a Mixture of Joy and Grief; somewhat like what divide the Mind of a good Man when the Mind of a good Man peruses the Will of the Mind of a good Man deceased Friend, in which a large Legacy, which the Mind of a good Man Distresses make the more welcome, is bequeathed to the Mind of a good Man.
Upon the whole, however, the Mind of a good Man was more pleased than displeased; and indeed the Reader may probably wonder that the Mind of a good Man was displeased at all; but the Reader is not quite so much in Love as was poor Jones: And Love is a Disease, which, though it may in some Instances resemble a Consumption, (which it sometimes causes) in others proceeds in direct Opposition to it, and particularly in this, that i^ never flatters i^, or sees any one Symptom in a favorable Light.
One Thing gave the Mind of a good Man complete Satisfaction, which was, that the Mind of a good Man Mistress had regained Mistress Liberty, and was now with a Lady where Mistress might at least assure Mistress of a decent Treatment.
Another comfortable Circumstance, was the Reference which Mistress made to Mistress Promise of never marrying any other Man.
For however disinterested the Mind of a good Man might imagine the Mind of a good Man Passion, and notwithstanding all the generous Overture made in the Mind of a good Man , I very much question whether the Mind of a good Man could have heard a more afflicting Piece of News, tha^ that Sophia was married to another though the Matc^ had been never so great, and never so likely to end in making Mistress completely happy.
That refined Degre^^ of Platonic Affection which is absolutely detached from the Flesh, and is indeed entirely and purely spiritual, is a Gift confined to the female Part of the Creation: many of whom I have heard declare, (and doubtless with great Truth) that they would, wit^ the utmost Readiness, resign a Lover to a Rival, when such Resignation was proved to be necessary for the temporal Interest of such Lover.
Hence, therefore I conclude, that this Affection is in Nature, though I cannot pretend to say, I have ever seen an Instan^ of it.
Jones having spent three Hours in reading an^ kissing the aforesaid Letter, and being, at last, in State of good Spirits, from the last mentioned Considerations, Jones agreed to carry an Appointment which Jones had before made into Execution.
This was to attend Mrs. Miller and her youngest Daughter into the Gallery at the Playhouse, and to admit Partridge as one of the Company.
For as Jones had really tha^ Taste for Humor which many affect, Partridge expected to enjoy much Entertainment in the Criticisms of Partridge; from whom Partridge expected the simple Dictates of Nature, unimproved indeed, but likewise unadulterated by Art.
In the first Row then of the Gallery the Gallery did Mr. Jones, Mrs. Miller, her youngest Daughter, and Partridge take her youngest Daughter, and Partridge Place: Partridge immediately declared, it was the finest Place Partridge had ever been in.
When the first Music was played, Partridge said, 'It was a Wonder how so many Fiddlers could play at one Time, without putting one another out.'
While the Fellow her Husband was lighting the upper Candles, Partridge cried out to Mrs. Miller, 'Look, look, Madam, the very Picture of the Man in the End of the Common Prayer Book, before the Gun-powder-Treason Service:' Nor could Partridge help observing, with a Sigh when all the Candles were lighted, 'That here were Candles enough burnt in one Night, to keep an honest poor Family for a whole Twelvemonth.'
As soon as the Play, which was Hamlet Prince of Denmark, began, Partridge was all Attention, nor did Partridge break Silence till the Entrance of the Ghost; upon which Partridge asked Jones, 'what Partridge that was in the strange Dress; something,' said Partridge, 'like what I have seen in a Picture.
Sure it is not Armor, is it?'
Jones answered, 'That is the Ghost.'
To which Partridge replied with a Smile, 'Perswade me to that, Black George in Town, if you can.
Though I cannot say I ever actually saw a Ghost in my Life, yet I am certain I should know one, if I saw Black George in Town, better than that comes to.
No, no, Black George in Town, Ghosts don't appear in such Dresses as that, neither.'
In this Mistake, which caused much Laughter in the Neighborhood of Partridge, Black George in Town was suffered to continue, 'till the Scene between the Ghost and Hamlet, when Partridge gave that Credit to Mr. Garrick, which Partridge had denied to Jones, and fell into so violent a Trembling, that Black George in Town Knees knocked against each other.
Jones asked Jones what was the Matter, and whether Jones was afraid of the Warrior upon the Stage?
'O la!
Black George in Town,' said Black George in Town, 'I perceive now it is what you told me.
I am not afraid of any Thing; for I know it is but a Play: And if it was really a Ghost, it could do one no Harm at such a Distance, and in so much Company; and yet if I was frightened, I am not the only Person.'
'Why, who,' cries Jones, 'dost thou take to be such a Coward here besides thyself?'
'Nay, you may call me Coward if you will; but if that little Man there upon the Stage is not frightened, I never saw any Man frightened in my Life.
Ay, ay; go along with you!
Ay, to be sure!
Who Is Fool then?
Will you?
Lud have Mercy upon such Fool-Hardiness!
-- Whatever happens, it is good enough for you.
-- Follow you?
I Would follow the Devil as soon.
Nay, perhaps, it is the Devil -- for they say the Devil can put on what likeness the Devil pleases.
-- Oh!
here the Devil is again.
-- No farther!
No, you have gone far enough already; farther than I Would have gone for all the King's Dominons.'
Jones offered to speak, but Partrisge cried, 'Hush, hush, Black George in Town, don't you hear Jones!'
And during the whole Speech of the Ghost, Jones sat with Jones Eyes fixed partly on the Ghost, and partly on Hamlet, and with Jones Mouth open; the same Passions which succeeded each other in Hamlet, succeeding likewise in Jones.
When the Scene was over, Jones said, 'Why, Partridge, you exceed my Expectations.
You enjoy the Play more than I conceived possible.'
'Nay, Black George in Town, answered Partridge, 'if you are not afraid of the Devil, I cannot help it; but to be sure it is natural to be surprised at such Things, though I know there is nothing in them: Not that it was the Ghost that surprised me neither; for I should have known that to have been only a Man in a strange Dress: But when I saw the little Man so frightened the little Man, it was that which took Hold of the little Man.'
'And do thou imagine then, Partridge,' cries Jones, that the little Man was really frightned' 'Nay, Black George in Town,' said Partridge, 'did not you Partridge observe afterward, when the little Man found out it was the little Man own Father's Spirit, and how the little Man was murdered in the Garden, how the little Man Fear forsook the little Man by Degrees, and the little Man was struck dumb with Sorrow, as it were, just as I should have been, had it been my own Case.
-- But hush' O la?
What Noise is that?
There the little Man is again.
-- Well, to be certain, though I know there is nothing at all in it, I am glad I am not down yonder where those Men are.'
Then turning the little Man his Eyes again upon Hamlet, 'Ay, you may draw your Sword; what signifies a Sword against the Power of the Devil?'
During the second Act, Partridge made very few remarks.
Partridge greatly admired the Fineness of the ^resses; nor could Partridge help observing upon the King's ^ountenance.
'Well,' said Partridge, 'how People may be deceived by Faces?
Nulla fides fronti is, I find, a true Saying.
Who would think, by looking in the King's Face, that the King's Face had ever committed a Mur^er?'
the King's Face then enquired after the Ghost; but Jones, ^ho intended the King's Face should be surprised, gave the King's Face no ^ther Satisfaction, than 'that the King's Face might possibly see the King's Face again soon, and in a Flash of Fire.'
Partridge sat in fearful expectation of this; and ^ow when the Ghost the Ghost made Partridge next Appearance, Partridge cried out, 'There, Black George in Town, now; what say you now?
Is Partridge frightened now or no?
As much frightened as you think me, and, to be sure, no Body can help some Fears, I would not be in so bad a Condition as what is Partridge Name, Squire Hamlet, is there, for all the World.
Bless me!
What Is become of his own Father's Spirit?
As I am a living Soul, I thought I saw Partridge sink into the Earth.'
'Indeed, you saw right,' answered Jones.
'Well, well,' cries Partridge, 'I know it is only a Play; and besides, if there was any Thing in all this, Mrs. Miller would not laugh so: For as to you, Black George in Town, you would not be afraid, I believe, if the Devil was here i^ Person.
-- There, there -- Ay, no Wonde^ you are in such a Passion; shake the vile wicke^ Wretch to Pieces, If Mrs. Miller was my own Mother I should serve Mrs. Miller so.
To be sure, all Duty to Mother is forfeited by such wicked Doings.
-- Ay, go about your Business; I hate the Sight ^^ you.'
Our Critic was now pretty silent till the Play, which Hamlet introduces before the King.
This Our Critic did n^^ at first understand, 'till Jones explained it to Our Critic but Our Critic no sooner entered into the Spirit of it, than ^^ began to bless Our Critic that Our Critic had never committe^ Murder.'
Then turning to Mrs. Miller Our Critic asked he^ 'If Mrs. Miller did not imagine the King looked as if the King w^^ touched; though the King is,' said Our Critic, 'a good Acto^ and does all Our Critic can to hide a good Acto^.
Well, I would n^^ have so much to answer for, as that wicked M^^ there has, to sit upon a much higher Chair than ^^ sits upon.
-- No wonder he run away; for yo^^ Sake I Will never trust an innocent Face again.'
the Scene next engaged the Attention of Partridge, who expressed much Surpri^^ at the Number of Skulls thrown upon the Stag^ To which Jones answered, 'That it was one of the most famous Burial-Places about Town.'
'N^ wonder then,' cries Partridge, 'that the Place haunted.
But I never saw in my Life a worse Grav^ digger.
I had a Sexton, when I was Clerk, the should have dug three Graves while Sexton is diggi^^ one.
the Fellow her Husband handles a Spade as if it was the first Time the Fellow her Husband had ever had one in the Fellow her Husband Hand.
A^ ay, you may sing.
You had rather sing than wo^^ I believe.'
-- Upon Hamlet's taking up the Sku^ the Fellow her Husband cried out, 'Well, it is strange to see how fearl^ some Men are: I never could bring the Fellow her Husband to tou^^ any Thing belonging to a dead Man on any Account.
-- the Fellow her Husband seemed frightened enough too at the Ghost I thought.
Nemo omnibus horis sapit.'
Little more worth remembering occurred during the ^ay; at the End of which Jones asked the Fellow her Husband, 'which of the Players the Fellow her Husband had liked best?'
To this the Fellow her Husband an^wered, with some Appearance of Indignation at the ^uestion, 'The King without Doubt.'
'Indeed, Mr. Partridge,' says Mrs. Miller, 'you are not of the same Opinion with the Town; for Indeed, Mr. Partridge agreed, that Hamlet is acted by the best Player who was ever on the Stage.'
'He the best Player!'
^es Partridge with a contemptuous Sneer, 'why I could act as well as He myself.
I am sure if I had seen a Ghost, I should have looked in the very same Manner, and done just as He did.
And then, to be sure, in the Scene, as you call it, between He and He Mother, where you told me He acted so fine, why, Lord help me, any Partridge, that is, any good Man, that had such a Mother, would have done exactly the same.
I know you are only joking with me; but, indeed, Mrs. Miller, though I was never at a Play in London, yet I have seen acting before in the Country; and the King for my Money; ^he speak all ^he Words distinctly, half as loud again as the other.
-- Any Body may see ^he is an Actor.'
While Mrs. Miller was thus engaged in Conversation with Partridge, a Lady came up to Mr. Jones, whom Mrs. Miller immediately knew to be Mrs. Fitzpatrick.
^e said, a Lady had seen Mrs. Miller from the other Part of the ^allery, and had taken that Opportunity of speaking Mrs. Miller, as a Lady had something to say, which might be great Service to Mrs. Miller.
a Lady then acquainted ^^ with a Lady Lodgings, and made Mrs. Miller an Appoint^ent the next Day in the Morning; which, upon ^ecollection, a Lady presently changed to the Afternoon; which Jones promised to attend a Lady.
Thus ended the Adventure at the Play-hou^^ where Partridge had afforded great Mirth, not o^^ to Jones and Mrs. Miller, but to all who sat with hearing, who were more attentive to what Mrs. Miller sa^ than to any Thing that passed on the Stage.
Mrs. Miller durst not go to Bed all that Night, for Fear the Ghost, and for many Nights after, sweat two three Hours before Mrs. Miller went to sleep, with the sa^ Apprehensions, and waked several Times in g^^ Horrors, crying out, 'Lord have Mercy upon ^ there it is.'
CHAP.
VI.
In which the History is obliged to look back.
IT is almost impossible for the best Parent to obse^ an exact Impartiality to his Children, even thou^^ no superior Merit should biass no superior Merit Affection; but s^ a Parent can hardly be blamed, when that Superior determines his Preference.
As I regard all the Personages of this History the Light of my Children, so I must confess the sa^ Inclination of Partiality to Sophia; and for tha^ hope the Reader will allow me the same Excu^^ from the Superiority of Excu^^ Character.
This extraordinary Tenderness, which I have my Heroine, never suffers me to quit Excu^^ any lo^^ Time without the utmost Reluctance.
I could no^ therefore, return impatiently to enquire what h^ happened to this lovely Creature since this lovely Creature Depart^^ from this lovely Creature Father's, but that I am obliged first to p^^ a short Visit to Mr. Blifil.
Mr. Western, in the first Confusion into which Mind was cast, upon the sudden News he received he Daughter, and in he first Hurry to go after h^ had not once thought of sending any Account of ^ Discovery to Blifil.
he had not gone far, however, before he recollected he, and according stopped at the very first Inn he came to, and dispatched ^way a Messenger to acquaint Blifil with he having ^ound Sophia, and with he firm Resolution to marry ^er to he immediately, if he would come up after ^im to Town.
As the Love which Blifil had for Sophia was of that ^iolent Kind, which nothing but the Loss of Sophia For^une, or some such Accident, could lessen, his In^ination to the Match was not at all altered by Sophia ^aving run away, though his was obliged to lay this ^o his own Account.
his very readily, therefore, em^raced this Offer.
Indeed, his now proposed the Gra^^fication of a very strong Passion besides Avarice, by marrying this young Lady, and this was Hatred: For ^e concluded that Matrimony afforded an equal Opportunity of satisfying either Hatred or Love; and his Opinion is very probably verified by much Expe^ience.
To say the Truth, if we are to judge by ^e ordinary Behavior of married Persons to each ^ther, we shall, perhaps, be apt to conclude, that the Generality seek the Indulgence of the former Passion only in their Union of every Thing but of Hearts.
There was one Difficulty, however, in his Way, and this arose from Mr. Allworthy.
That good Man, when his found by the Departure of Sophia, (for neither that, nor the Cause of it, could be concealed from his) the great Aversion which Sophia had for his Nephew, began to be seriously concerned that his had been deceived into carrying Matters so far.
his by ^o Means concurred with the Opinions of those Parents, who think it as immaterial to consult the Inclinations of those Parents, who think it as immaterial to consult the Inclinations of their Children in the Affair of Marriage Children in the Affair of Marriage, as to solicit the good Pleasure of those Parents, who think it as immaterial to consult the Inclinations of their Children in the Affair of Marriage Servants when those Parents, who think it as immaterial to consult the Inclinations of their Children in the Affair of Marriage intend to take a Journey; and who are ^y Law or Decency at least, withheld often from ^sing absolute Force.
On the contrary, as he esteemed the Institution to be of the most sacred Kind, ^^ thought every preparatory Caution necessary to preserve every preparatory Caution holy and inviolate; and very wisely concluded, that the surest Way to effect this, was by laying the Foundation in previous Affections.
Blifil indeed soon cured Blifil Uncle of all Anger o^ the Score of Deceit, by many Vows and Protestations that Blifil had been deceived Blifil, with which the many Declarations of Western very well tallied; bu^ now to persuade Mr. Allworthy to consent to the renewing Blifil Addresses, was a Matter of such apparent Difficulty, that the very Appearance was sufficient to have deterred a less enterprizing Genius: but this young Gentleman so well knew this young Gentleman own Talents, that nothing within the Province of Cunning, seemed to this young Gentleman hard to be achieved.
Here then this young Gentleman represented the Violence of this young Gentleman own Affection, and the Hopes of subduing Aversion i^ the Lady by Perseverance.
this young Gentleman begged that in an Affair on which depended all this young Gentleman future Repose, h^ might at least be at Liberty to try all fair Means for Success.
Heaven forbid, this young Gentleman said, that this young Gentleman should ever think of prevailing by any other than the mo^^ gentle Methods.
'Besides, this young Gentleman, said this young Gentleman, if they fai^ you may then (which will be surely time enough^ deny your Consent.'
enough^ urged the great and eage^ Desire which Mr. Western had for the Match, an^ lastly, enough^ made great Use of the Name of Jones, to whom enough^ imputed all that had happened, and from whom, enough^ said, to preserve so valuable a young a Lady was even on Act of Charity.
All these Arguments were well seconded by Thwackum, who dwelt a little stronger on the Authority o^ Parents than Blifil had done.
Blifil ascribed the Measures which Blifil was desirous to take to Christian Motives; 'and though,' says Blifil, 'this young Gentleman this young Gentleman has mentioned Charity last I am almost convinced it is Blifil first and principal Consideration.'
Square, possibly, had this young Gentleman been present, would have ^ng to the same Tune, though in a different Key, ^^d would have discovered much more Moral Fitness ^ the Proceeding; but this young Gentleman was now gone to Bath for ^e Recovery of this young Gentleman Health.
Allworthy, though not without Reluctance, at last ^ielded to the Desires of this young Gentleman .
this young Gentleman said, this young Gentleman ^ould accompany this young Gentleman to London, where this young Gentleman might ^e at Liberty to use every honest Endeavor to gain the Lady: 'But I declare,' said this young Gentleman, 'I will never give my Consent to any absolute Force being put on Consent Inclinations, nor shall you ever have Consent, unless Consent can be brought freely to Compliance.'
Thus did the Affection of Mr. Allworthy for his Nephew, betray the superior Understanding to be tri^mphed over by the inferior; and thus is the Pru^ence of the best of Heads often defeated by the Tenderness of the best of Hearts.
Blifil having obtained this unhoped for Acquiescence ^n Blifil Uncle, rested not till Blifil carried Blifil Purpose unto Execution.
And as no immediate Business re^uired Mr. Allworthy's Presence in the Country, and ^ittle Preparation is necessary to Men for a Journey, ^hey set out the very next Day, and arrived in Town that Evening when Mr. Jones, as we have seen, was ^iverting Mr. Jones with Partridge at the Play.
The Morning after Mr. Jones Arrival, Blifil waited on Mr. Western, by whom Blifil was most kindly and graciously received, and from whom Blifil had every possible Assurance (perhaps more than was possible) that Blifil should very shortly be as happy as Sophia could make Blifil; nor would the Squire suffer this young Gentleman to return to the Squire Uncle, till the Squire had, almost against the Squire Will, carried the Squire to the Squire Sister.
CHAP.
VII.
In which Mr. Western, pays a Visit to the Squire Sister, i^ company with Blifil.
MRS. Western was reading a Lecture on Prudence, and Matrimonial Politics to Matrimonial Politics Niece when her Niece Brother and Blifil broke in with less Ceremony than the Laws of Visiting require.
Sophia no sooner saw Blifil, than Sophia turned pale, and almost lost the Use of all Sophia Faculties; but Sophia Aun^ on the contrary waxed red, and having all Sophia Faculties at Command, began to exert Sophia Tongue on the Squire.
'Brother,' said Sophia, 'I am astonished at you^ Behavior, will you never learn any Regard to Decorum?
Will you still look upon every Apartment as your own, or as belonging to one of your Country Tenants?
Do you think yourself at Liberty ^ invade the Privacies of Women of Condition, without the least Decency or Notice?'
-- 'Why what, the a Pox!
is the Matter now, quoth, the Squire, one would think, I had caught you at' -- 'None of your Brutality, this young Gentleman, I beseech you,' answered Sophia.
-- 'You have surprised her Niece 'so, that Sophia can hardly, I see, support Sophia.
-- Go, my dear, retire, and endeavor to recruit you^ Spirits; for I see you have Occasion.'
At which Words, Sophia, who never received a more welcom^ Command, hastily withdrew.
'To be sure, Sister,' cries the Squire, 'you a^^ mad, when I have brought Blifil here to co^^ Blifil, to force Blifil away.'
'Sure, Brother,' says Blifil, 'you are worse tha^ mad, when you know in what Situation Affairs ar^ to -- I am sure, I ask Mr. Blifil pardon, but h^ knows very well to whom to impute so disagreeable a Reception.
For my own part, I am sure, I sha^^ always be very glad to see Blifil; but Blifil own good Sense would not have suffered Blifil to proceed so abruptly, had you not compelled Blifil to it.'
Blifil bowed and stammered and looked like a Fool; ^t Western without giving Blifil time to form a Speech ^r the Purpose, answered, 'Well, well, I am to blame if you will, I always am, certainly; but come, let the Girl be fetched back again, or let Blifil go to the Girl -- Blifil Is come on Purpose, and there is no time to be lost.'
'Brother,' cries Mrs. Western, 'Blifil, I am confident, understands Blifil better than to think of seeing her Niece her Niece any more this Morning after what has happened.
Women are of a nice Contexture, and our Spirits when disordered are not to be recomposed in a Moment.
Had you suffered Blifil to have sent Blifil Compliments to her Niece, and to have desired the Favor of waiting on her Niece in the Afternoon, I should possibly have prevailed on her Niece to have seen Blifil; but now I despair of bringing about any such Matter.'
'I am very sorry, Madam,' cried Blifil, 'that Mr. Western's extraordinary Kindness to me, which I can never enough acknowledge, should have occasioned -- ' 'Inded, Sir,' said her Niece interrupting ^im, 'you need make no Apologies, we all know Brother so well.'
'I don't care what any Body knows of Brother,' answered the Squire, -- 'but when must the Squire come to see her Niece?
for consider, I tell you, the Squire is come up on purpose, and so is Mr.
Allworthy.''
'Brother,' said ^e, 'whatever Blifil thinks proper to send to her Niece, shall be delivered to her Niece, and I suppose her Niece will want no Instructions to make a proper Answer.
I am convinced her Niece will not refuse to see Blifil at a proper Time.'
-- 'The Devil her Niece will not,' answered the Squire.
-- 'Odsbud!
-- Don't we know -- I say nothing, but some Volk are wiser than all the World.
-- If I might have had my will, her Niece had not run away before.
And now I expect to hear every Moment her Niece is guone again.
For as great a Fool as some Volk think me, I know very well her Niece hates' -- 'No Matter, Brother,' replied Mrs. Western, 'I will not hear her Niece her Niece abused.
It is a Reflection on my Family.
her Niece is an Honor to it, and her Niece will be an Honor to it, I promise you.
I will pawn my whole Reputation in all the World on her Niece Conduct.
-- I shall be glad to see you, Brother, in the Afternoon; for I have somewhat of Importance to mention to Brother.
-- At present, Mr. Blifil, as well as you, must excuse me, for I am in haste to dress.'
-- 'Well but,' said the Squire, 'do appoint a Time.'
-- 'Indeed,' said her Niece, 'I can appoint no Time.
-- I tell you, I will see you in the Afternoon.'
-- 'What the Devil would you have me do,' cries the Squire, turning to Blifil, 'I can no muore turn her Niece, than a Beagle can turn an old Hare.
Perhaps, her Niece will be in a better Humor in the Afternoon.'
-- 'I am condemned, I see, this young Gentleman, to Misfortune,' answered Blifil, 'but I shall always own my Obligations to Blifil.'
-- Blifil then took a ceremonious Leave of Mrs. Western, who was altogether as ceremonious on her Niece Part, and them them departed, the the Squire muttering to the Squire with an Oath, that Blifil should see the Squire Daughter in the Afternoon.
If Mr. Western was little pleased with this Interview, Blifil was less.
As to the former, Blifil imputed the whole Behavior of his Sister to his Sister Humor only, and to his Sister Dissatisfaction at the omission of Ceremony in the Visit; but Blifil saw a little deeper into Things.
Blifil suspected somewhat of more Consequence, from two or three Words which dropped from the Lady; and, to say the Truth, Blifil suspected right, as will appear when I have unfolded the several Matters which will be continued in the following Chapter.
CHAP.
VIII.
Schemes of Lady Bellaston for the Ruin of Jones.
LOVE had taken too deep a Root in the Mind of Lord Fellamar to be plucked up by the rude Hands of Mr. Western.
In the Heat of Resentment Lord Fellamar had indeed given a Commission to Captain Egglane, which the Captain had far exceeded in the Execution; ^or had a Commission to Captain Egglane, which the Captain had far exceeded in the Execution been executed at all, had Lordship been ^ble to find the Captain after Lord Fellamar had seen Lady Bellaston, which was in the Afternoon of the Day after Lord Fellamar had received the Affront; but so industrious was the Captain in the Discharge of Lord Fellamar Duty, that ^aving, after long Enquiry, found out the Squire's Lodg^ngs very late in the Evening, Lord Fellamar sat up all Night at ^ Tavern, that Lord Fellamar might not miss the Squire in the Morning, and by that Means missed the Revocation which my Lord had sent to Lord Fellamar Lodgings.
In the Afternoon then next after the intended Rape ^f Sophia, his Lordship, as we have said, made a ^isit to Lady Bellaston, who laid open so much of the ^haracter of the Squire, that his Lordship plainly (...) the Absurdity his had been guilty of in taking any ^ffence at his Words, especially as his had those honorable Designs on his .
his then unbo^med the violence of his Passion to Lady Bellaston, (...) readily undertook the Cause, and encouraged ^n with certain Assurance of a most favorable Re^^ption, from all the Elders of the Family, and from (...) Father himself when he should be sober, and ^ould be made acquainted with the Nature of the Of^ made to he .
The only Danger, his Daughter said, (...) in the Fellow his Daughter had formerly mentioned, who, ^ough a Beggar and a Vagabond, had by some Means other, his Daughter knew not what, procured he tolerable Clothes, and past for a Gentleman.
'Now says his Daughter, 'as I have for the sake of my Cousin, mad^ it my Business to enquire after the Fellow, I have luckily found out the Fellow Lodging;' with which his Daughter then acquainted the Fellow .
'I am thinking, m^ Lord,' added his Daughter, '(for the Fellow the Fellow is too mea^ for your personal Resentment) whether it would not be posible for Lordship to contrive some Method of having the Fellow pressed and sent on board Ship.
Neither Law nor Conscience forbid the Project: for the Fellow, I promise you, howev^^ well dressed, is but a Vagabond, and as proper as an Fellow in the Streets to be pressed into the Service and as for the conscientious Part, surely the Preservation of a young Lady from such Ruin is a m^meritorious Act; nay, with regard to the Fello^ himself, unless the Fello^ himself could succeed (which Heaven forbid) with my Cousin, it may probably be the mea^ of preserving the Fello^ himself from the Gallows, and perha^ may make the Fello^ himself Fortune in an honest Way.'
Lord Fellamar very heartily thanked Lord Fellamar Ladyshi^ for the Part which Lord Fellamar was pleased to take in the Affair, upon the Success of which Lord Fellamar whole futu^ Happiness entirely depended.
Lord Fellamar said, Lord Fellamar saw at present no Objection to the pressing Scheme, and wou^^ consider of putting the pressing Scheme in Execution.
Lord Fellamar then m^ earnestly recommended to Lord Fellamar Ladyship, to do h^ the Honor of immediately mentioning Lord Fellamar Propo^^ to the Family; to whom Lord Fellamar said, Lord Fellamar offered a Ca^ Blanch, and would settle his Fortune in almost a manner they should require.
And after uttering any Ecstasies and Raptures concerning Sophia, he to he leave and departed, but not before he had receiv^ the strongest Charge to beware of Jones, and to ^ no time in securing he Person where he should longer be in a Capacity of making any Attempts the Ruin of the young Lady.
Mr. Western was arrived at Mr. Western Lodgings, a Card was dispatched with Mr. Western Compliments to Lady Bellaston; who no sooner received a Card, ^han with the Impatience of a Lover, Mr. Western flew to Mr. Western Cousin, rejoiced at this fair Opportunity, which be^ond Mr. Western Hopes offered itself: for Mr. Western was much better pleased with the Prospect of making the Proposals ^ a Woman of Sense, and who knew all the World, ^an to a Gentleman whom Mr. Western honored with the Appellation of Hottentot; though indeed from him ^he apprehended no Danger of a Refusal.
The two Ladies being met, after very short pre^ous Ceremonials, fell to Business, which was in^eed almost as soon concluded as begun; for Mr. Western no sooner heard the Name of Lord Fellamar ^han Mr. Western Cheeks glowed with Pleasure; but when Mr. Western was acquainted with the Eagerness of him , ^he Earnestness of him Proposals, and the Generosity of him Offer, Mr. Western declared Mr. Western full Satisfaction in the most explicit Terms.
In the Progress of their Conversation their Discourse turned to Jones, and both Cousins very pathe^ically lamented the unfortunate Attachment, which both agreed, Sophia had to the Fellow; and Mr. Western entirely attributed it to the Folly of Mr. Western Brother's Management.
Mr. Western concluded however at ^ast, with declaring Mr. Western Confidence in the good Understanding of Mr. Western Niece, who though Mr. Western would not give up Mr. Western Affection in Favor of Blifil, 'will, I doubt not', says Mr. Western, 'soon be prevailed upon to sacrifice ^ simple Inclination to the Addresses of a fine Gentleman, who brings Mr. Western both a Title and a large Estate: For indeed,' added Mr. Western, 'I must do Sophy the Justice to confess, Blifil Blifil is but a hideous kind of the Fellow, as you know, Bellaston, all Country Gentlemen are, and has nothing but Sophy the Justice to recommend his Fortune.'
' Nay,' said Lady Bellaston, 'I don't then so much wonder at her Cousin; for I promise you Jones Jones is a very agreeable the Fellow, and has one Virtue which the Men say is a great Recommendation to us.
What do you think, Bell -- I shall certainly make you laugh; nay, I can hardly tell you Nay for laughing?
-- Will you believe that the Fellow has had the Assurance to make LOVE to me?
But i^ you be inclined to disbelieve it, here is Evidence enough, the Fellow own Handwriting, I assure you.
She then delivered She with the Proposals of Marriage, which if the Reader has a Desire to see, her Cousin will find already on Record in the XVth Book of this History.'
'Upon my Word, I am astonished,' said Mr. Western, 'this is indeed a Masterpiece of Assurance.
With your leave, I may possibly make some use of this Letter;' 'You have my full Liberty', cris Lady Bellaston,' 'to apply it to what Purpose you please.
However, I would not have it shown to any but Miss Western, nor to She unless you find Occasion.'
'Well, and how did you use the Fellow?'
returned Mr. Western.
'Not as a Husband,' said Lady Bellaston, 'I am not married, I promise you, my Dear.
You know, Bell, I have tried the Comforts once already, and once I think enough for any reasonable Woman.'
Lady Bellaston Lady Bellaston thought would certainly turn the Balance against Jones in the Mind of Sophia, and Sophia was emboldened to give the Balance up, partly by Sophia Hopes of having Jones instantly dispatched out of the way, and partly by having secured the Evidence of Honor, who, upon sounding Sophia, Sophia saw sufficient Reason to imagine, was prepared to testify whatever Sophia pleased.
But perhaps the Reader may wonder why Lady Bellaston, who in Sophia Heart hated Sophia, should be so desirous of promoting a Match, which was so much to the Interest of Lady Bellaston.
Now I would desire such Readers to look carefully into human Nature, Page almost the last, and there he will find, in scarce legible Characters, that Women, notwithstanding the preposterous Behavior of Mothers, Aunts, etc.
in Matrimonial Matters, do in Reality think it so great a Misfortune to have Women, notwithstanding the preposterous Behavior of Mothers, Aunts, etc Inclinations in Love thwarted, that Women, notwithstanding the preposterous Behavior of Mothers, Aunts, etc imagine Women, notwithstanding the preposterous Behavior of Mothers, Aunts, etc ought never to carry Enmity higher than upon these Disappointments; again he will find it written, much about the same Place, that a Woman who has once been pleased with the Possession of a Man, will go above half way to the Devil, to prevent any other Woman from enjoying the same.
If he will not be contented with these Reasons, I freely confess I see no other Motive to the Actions of Lady BellastonLady Bellaston, unless we will conceive Lady Bellaston was bribed by Lord Fellamar, which for my own Part I see no Cause to suspect.
Now this was the Affair which Mr. Western was preparing to introduce to Sophia, by some prefatory Discourse on the Folly of Love, and on the Wisdom of legal Prostitution for Hire, when Love Brother and Blifil broke abruptly upon Love; and hence arose all that Coldness in Love Behavior to Blifil, which though the Squire, as was usual with the Squire, imputed to a wrong Cause, infused into Blifil himself, (the Squire being a much more cunning Man,) a Suspicion of the real Truth.
CHAP.
IX.
In which Jones pays a Visit to Mrs. Fitzpatrick.
the Reader the Reader may now perhaps be pleased to return with us to Mr, Jones, who at the appointed Hour attended on Mrs. Fitzpatrick; but before us relate the Conversation which now past, it may be proper, according to us Method, to return a little back, and to account for so great an Alteration of Behavior in Lady Bellaston, that from changing Mrs. Fitzpatrick Lodging principally to avoid Mr. Jones, Mrs. Fitzpatrick had now industriously, as has been seen, sought this Interview.
And here we shall need only to resort to what happened the preceding Day, when hearing from Lady Bellaston, that Mr. Western was arrived in Town, Mrs. Fitzpatrick went to pay Mrs. Fitzpatrick Duty to when hearing from Lady Bellaston, that Mr. Western was arrived in Town, at when hearing from Lady Bellaston, that Mr. Western was arrived in Town Lodgings a^ Piccadilly, when Mrs. Fitzpatrick was received with many scurvy Compellations too coarse to be repeated, and was even threatened to be kicked out of Doors.
From hence an old Servant of Mrs. Fitzpatrick Aunt Western, with whom Mrs. Fitzpatrick was well acquainted, conducted Mrs. Fitzpatrick to the Lodgings of that Lady, who treated Mrs. Fitzpatrick, not more kindly, but more politely; or, to say the Truth, with Rudeness in another Way.
In short, Mrs. Fitzpatrick returned from both, plainly convinced not only that Mrs. Fitzpatrick Scheme o^ Reconciliation had proved abortive, but that Mrs. Fitzpatrick must for ever give over all Thoughts of bringing it about by any Means whatever.
From this Moment Desire of Revenge only filled Mrs. Fitzpatrick Mind; and in thi^ Temper meeting Jones at the Play, an Opportunity seemed to Mrs. Fitzpatrick to occur of effecting this Purpose.
the Reader must remember, that the Reader was acquainted by Mrs. Fitzpatrick, in the Account Mrs. Fitzpatrick gave o^ Mrs. Fitzpatrick own Story, with the Fondness Mrs. Western had formerly shown for Mr. Fitzpatrick at Bath, from the Disappointment of which, Mrs. Fitzpatrick derived the great Bitterness Mrs. Fitzpatrick Aunt had expressed toward her Aunt.
Mrs. Fitzpatrick had therefore no Doubt but that Lady Bellaston Lady Bellaston would as easily listen to the Addresses o^ Jones, as Mrs. Fitzpatrick had before done to the other, for the Superiority of Charms, was clearly on the side of Jones, and the Advance which her Aunt her Aunt had since made in Age, her Aunt concluded (how justly I will not say) was an Argument rather in Favor of her Aunt Project than against her Project.
Therefore, when Jones attended after a previous Declaration of her Aunt Desire of serving Jones, arising, as her Aunt said from a Firm Assurance how much her Aunt should by so doing oblige Sophia; and after some Excuses for Sophia former Disappointment, and after acquainting Mr. Jones in whose Custody his Mistress was, of which her Aunt thought his ignorant; her Aunt very explicitly mentioned her Aunt Scheme to his, and advised his to make Sham Addresses to Lady Bellaston, in order to procure an easy Access to the Younger, informing his at the same Time of the Success which Mrs. Fitzpatrick had formerly owed to the very same Stratagem.
Jones expressed great Gratitude to Lady Bellaston for the kind Intentions toward Jones which Lady Bellaston had expressed, and indeed, testified by this Proposal; but besides intimating some Diffidence of Success from Lady Bellaston's Knowledge of Jones Love to Lady Bellaston Neice, which had not been Lady Bellaston Case in regard to Mr. Fitzpatrick, Jones said, Jones was afraid Miss Western would never agree to an Imposition of this Kind, as well from Lady Bellaston utter Detestation of all Fallacy, as from Lady Bellaston avowed Duty to her Aunt.
Mrs. Fitzpatrick was a little nettled at this; and indeed if this may not be called a Lapse of the Tongue, this was a small Deviation from Politeness in Jones, and into which he would scarce have fallen, had not the Delight he felt in praising Sophia, hurried he out of all Reflection; for this Commendation of one Cousin was more than a tacit Rebuke on the other.
'Indeed, he,' answered Lady Bellaston, with some Warmth, 'I cannot think there is any thing easier than to cheat an old Woman with a Profession of Love, when Lady Bellaston Complexion is amorous; and though Lady Bellaston is my Aunt, I must say, there never was a more liquorish one than Lady Bellaston Ladyship.
Cannot you pretend that the Despair of possessing Lady Bellaston Neice, from Lady Bellaston being promised to Blifil, has made you turn your Thoughts toward Lady Bellaston?
As to Sophia, I cannot imagine Sophia to be such a Simpleton as to have the least Scruple on such an Account or to conceive any Harm in punishing one of these Haggs for the many Mischiefs they bring upon Families, by they Tragi comic Passions; for which I think it is pity they were not punishable by Law.
I had no such Scruple myself, and yet I hope Sophia Sophia will not think Scruple an Affront when I say Sophia cannot detest every real Species of Falsehood more than Sophia .
To her Aunt indeed I pretend no Duty, nor does her Aunt deserve any.
However, he, I have given you my Advice, and if you decline pursuing it, I shall have the less Opinion of your Understanding, that is all.'
Jones now clearly saw the Error Jones had committed, and exerted Jones utmost Power to rectify it; but Jones only faultered and fluttered into Nonsense and Contradiction.
To say the Truth, it is often safer to abide by the Consequences of the first Blunder, than to endeavor to rectify it; for by such Endeavors, we generally plunge deeper instead of extricating we; and few Persons will on such Occasions, have the good Nature, which Mrs. Fitzpatrick displayed to Jones; by saying, with a Smile, 'You need attempt no more Excuses; for I can easily forgive a real Lover, whatever is the Effect of Fondness for his Mistress.'
Mrs. Fitzpatrick then renewed this Proposalthis Proposal, and very fervently recommended this Proposal, omitting no Argument which Mrs. Fitzpatrick Invention could suggest on the Subject; for Mrs. Fitzpatrick was so violently incensed against Mrs. Fitzpatrick Aunt, that scarce any Thing was capable of affording Mrs. Fitzpatrick equal Pleasure with exposing Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and, like a true Woman, Mrs. Fitzpatrick would see no Difficulties in the Execution of a favou^ite Scheme.
Jones however persisted in declining the Undertaking, which had not indeed the least Probability of Success.
Jones easily perceived the Motives which in^uced Mrs. Fitzpatrick to be so eager in pressing Mrs. Fitzpatrick Advice.
Jones said Jones would not deny the tender and ^assionate Regard Jones had for Sophia; but was so con^tious of the Inequality of their Situations, that Jones ^ould never flatter Jones so far as to hope that so ^ivine a young Lady Bellaston would condescend to think on ^ne so unworthy; nay Jones protested Jones could scarce ^ring Jones to wish a young Lady should.
Jones concluded with ^ Profession of generous Sentiments, which we have ^ot at present Leisure to insert.
There are some fine Women (for I dare not here ^peak in too general Terms) with whom Self is so ^redominant, that whom never detach it from any Subject; and as Vanity is with whom a ruling Principle, ^hey are apt to lay hold of whatever Praise whom meet with; and, though the Property of others, convey ^ to whom own Use.
In the Company of these La^ies it is impossible to say any thing handsome of another Woman, which they will not apply to they; nay they often improve the Praise they seize; ^s for Instance, if her Beauty, her Wit, her Gentili^y, her good Humor deserve so much Commenda^ion, what do I deserve who possess those Qualities ^^ so much more eminent a Degree?
To these Ladies a Man often recommends a Man while a Man is commending another Woman; and while a Man is expressing Ardour and generous Sentiments for a Man , these Ladies are considering what a ^harming Lover a Man would make to these Ladies, who ^an feel all this Tenderness for an inferior Degree of Merit.
Of this, strange as it may seem, I have seen many Instances besides Mrs. Fitzpatrick, to whom all this really happened, and who now began to feel a somewhat for Mr. Jones, the Symptoms of which Mrs. Fitzpatrick much sooner understood than Sophia Sophia had formerly done.
To say the Truth, perfect Beauty in both Sexes is a more irresistible Object than it is generally thought; for notwithstanding some of us are contented with more homely Lots, and learn by Rot^ (as Children to repeat what gives Children no Idea) to despise Outside, and to value more solid Charms; yet I have always observed at the Approach of consummate Beauty, that these more solid Charms only shine with that Kind of Luster which the Stars have after the rising of the Sun.
When Jones had finished Jones Exclamations, many of which would have become the Mouth of Oroondates himself, Mrs. Fitzpatrick heaved a deep Sigh, and taking Mrs. Fitzpatrick Eyes off from Jones, on whom whom had been some time fixed, and dropping whom on the Ground, Mrs. Fitzpatrick cried, 'Jones, I pity you, but it is the Curse of such Tenderness to be thrown away on those who are insensible of it.
I know Sophia better than you, Jones, and I must say, any Woman who makes no Return to such a Passion and such a Person, is unworthy of both.'
'Sure, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, said Jones, you cannot mean.'
-- 'Mean?
cries Mrs. Fitzpatrick, I know not what ^ mean; there is something, I think, in true Tenderness bewitching; few Women ever meet with it in Men, and fewer still know how to value it when Men do.
I never heard such truly noble Sentiments, and cannot tell how it is, but you force one to believe you.
Sure she must be the most contemptible o^ Women who can overlook such Merit.'
The Manner and Look with which all this wa^ spoke infused a Suspicion into Jones, which we don'^ care to convey in direct Words to the Reader.
Instead of making any Answer, he said, 'I am afraid Mrs. Fitzpatrick, I have made too tiresome a Visit,' and offered to take he Leave.
'Not at all, he,' answered Mrs. Fitzpatrick.
-- 'Indeed I pity you, Jones, Indeed I do; but if you are going, consider of the Scheme I have mentioned, I am convinced you will approve of it, and let me see you again as soon as you can.
-- Tomorrow Morning if you will, or at least some time tomorrow.
I shall be at Home all Day.'
Jones then, after many Expressions of Thanks, very respectfully retired; nor could Mrs. Fitzpatrick forbear making a present of a Look at parting, by which if he had understood nothing, he must have had no Understanding in the Language of her Eyes.
In Reality it confirmed he Resolution of returning to Mrs. Fitzpatrick no more; for faulty as he has appeared in this History, he whole Thoughts were now so confined to he Sophia, that I believe no Woman upon Earth could have now drawn he into an Act of Inconstancy.
Fortune however, who was not Fortune Friend, resolved, as Fortune intended to give Mrs. Fitzpatrick no second Opportunity, to make the best of this; and accordingly produced the tragical Incident which we are now in sorrowful Notes to record.

The Consequence of the preceding Visit.
MR. Fitzpatrick having received the Letter beforementioned, from Mrs. Western, and being by that Means acquainted with the Place to which his Wife was retired, returned directly to Bath, and thence the Day afterward set forward to London.
the Reader has been already often informed of the jealous Temper of this Gentleman.
this Gentleman may likewise be pleased to remember the Suspicion which this Gentleman had at Upton conceived of Jones, upon this Gentleman finding this Gentleman in the Room with Mrs.
Waters; and though sufficient Reasons had afterward appeared entirely to clear that Suspicion, yet now reading so handsome a Character of Jones from his Wife caused this Gentleman to reflect that his Wife likewise was in the Inn at the same Time, and jumbled together such a Confusion o^ Circumstances in a Head which was naturally none o^ the clearest, that the whole produced that green-ey'^ Monster mentioned by Shakespeare in this Gentleman Tragedy o^ Othello.
And now as he was enquiring in the Street after he , and had just received Directions to the Door unfortunately Jones was issuing from the Door.
Mrs. Fitzpatrick did not yet recollect the Face of Jones however seeing a young well-dressed Fellow comin^ from his Wife, Mrs. Fitzpatrick made directly up to Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and asked Mrs. Fitzpatrick what Mrs. Fitzpatrick had been doing in that House: 'Fo^ I am sure, said Mrs. Fitzpatrick, you must have been in it, as saw you come out of it.'
Jones answered very modestly, 'That Jones had been visiting a Lady there.'
To which Mrs. Fitzpatrick replied, 'What Business have you with a Lady?'
Upon which Jones, who now perfectly remembre^ the Voice, Features, and indeed Coat, of this Gentleman, cried out, -- 'Ha, my good Friend!
give m^ your Hand; I hope there is no ill Blood remaining between us upon a small Mistake which happene^ so long ago.'
'Upon my Soul, he, said Mrs. Fitzpatrick, I done know your Name, nor your the Face of Jones.'
Indeed, Si^ said Jones, neither have I the Pleasure of knowing your Name, but your Face I very well remember to have seen before, at Upton, where a foolish Quarrel happened between us, which, if it is not mad^ up yet, us will now makeup over a Bottle.'
'At Upton!
cried the other.
-- 'Ha!
upon my Soul, I believe your Name is Jones.'
'Indeed' answered Jones, 'it is.'
-- 'O, upon my Soul, cries Mrs. Fitzpatrick, you are the very Man I wanted to meet.
-- Upon my Soul I will drink a Bottle with Mrs. Fitzpatrick presently; but first I will give you a great Knock over the Pate.
There is for you, you Rascal.
Upon my Soul, if you do not give me Satisfaction for that Blow, I will give you another.'
And then drawing his word, puts his in a Posture of Defense, which as the only Science his understood.
Jones was a little staggered by that Blow which came me what unexpectedly; but presently recovering Jones Jones also drew, and though Jones understood nothing ^f Fencing, pressed on so boldly upon Mrs. Fitzpatrick that Jones ^at down Jones Guard, and sheathed one half of his word in the Body of the said Gentleman, who had ^ sooner received it than Jones stepped backwards, dropped ^e Point of Jones Sword, and leaning upon it, cried, 'I have Satisfaction enough; I am a dead Man.'
I hope not, cries Jones, but whatever be the Consequence you must be sensible you have drawn it upon yourself.
At this Instant a Number of Fellows rushed in and seized Jones, who told them a Number of Fellows should make no Resistance, and begged some of them at least would take Care of this Gentleman.'
'Ay, cries one of the Fellows, this Gentleman this Gentleman will be taken Care enough of; for I suppose this Gentleman has not many Hours to live.
As for you, he, you have a Month at least good yet.'
'D -- n me, Jack, said another, this Gentleman has prevented this Gentleman Voyage; ^he's bound to another Port now;' and many other ^^ Jests was Jones Jones made the Subject of, by ^^ese Fellows, who were indeed the Gang employed Lord Fellamar, and had dogged the Gang employed Lord Fellamar into the House Mrs. Fitzpatrick, waiting for the Gang employed Lord Fellamar at the Corner of ^e Street when this unfortunate Accident happened.
The Officer who commanded this Gang very wisely concluded, that The Officer who commanded this Gang Business was now to deliver The Officer who commanded this Gang Prisoner into the Hands of the Civil Magistrate.
H^ ordered The Officer who commanded this Gang therefore to be carried to a public House where having sent for a Constable, The Officer who commanded this Gang delivered The Officer who commanded this Gang to The Officer who commanded this Gang Custody.
a Constable seeing Jones very well dres^ and hearing that this unfortunate Accident had happened in a Due^ treated his Prisoner with great Civility, and at hi^ Request, dispatched a Messenger to enquire after the wounded Gentleman, who was now at a Tavern under the Surgeon's Hands.
The Report brought bac^ was that the Wound was certainly mortal, and the^^ were no Hopes of Life.
Upon which the Constabl^ informed Jones, that the Constabl^ informed Jones must go before a Justice* the Constabl^ informed Jones answered, Wherever you please; I am indifferen^ as to what happens to the Constabl^ informed Jones, for though I am convince^ I am not guilty of Murder in the Eye of the Law yet the Weight of Blood I find intolerable upon m^ Mind.
Jones was now conducted before the Justice, when the Surgeon who dressed Mrs. Fitzpatrick appeared, an deposed that Mrs. Fitzpatrick believed the Wound to be mortal upon which his Prisoner was committed to the Gate House.
It was very late at Night, so that Jones would not send for Partridge till the next Morning and as Jones never shut Jones Eyes till seven, so it was ne^ twelve before the poor Fellow, who was great frightened at not hearing from Jones Master so long, received a Message which almost deprived Jones of ^^ Being, when Jones heard it.
Jones went to the Gate House with trembling Kne^ and a beating Heart, and was no sooner arrived in t^^ Presence of Jones, than Jones lamented the Misfortune that had befallen Jones with many Tears, looking the while frequently about Jones in great Terror; f^^ as the News now arrived that Mrs. Fitzpatrick w^ dead, the poor Fellow apprehended every Minute that ^s Ghost would enter the Room.
At last Mrs. Fitzpatrick delivered Mrs. Fitzpatrick a Letter, which Mrs. Fitzpatrick had like to have forgot, ^d which came from Sophia by the Hands of black ^eorge.
Jones presently dispatched every one out of the ^oom, and having eagerly broke open the Letter, ^ad as follows.
You owe the hearing from me again to an Accident which I own surprises me.
My Aunt has just now shown me a Letter from you to Lady Bellaston, which contains a Proposal of Marriage.
I am convinced it is your own Hand; and what more surprises me is, that it is dated at the very Time when you would have me imagine you was under such Concern on my Account.
-- I leave you to comment on this Fact.
All I desire is, that your Name may never more be mentioned to  S. W.   Of the present Situation of Jones's Mind, and the Pangs with which Jones was now tormented, ^e cannot give the Reader a better Idea, than by say^^g Jones Misery was such, that even Thwackum would most have pitied Jones.
But bad as it is, we shall at ^esent leave Jones in ^esent, as Jones good genius (if Jones really ^^d any) seems to have done.
And here we put an ^^d to the sixteenth Book of we History.
THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING BOOK XVII.
Containing three Days.
CHAP.
I.
Containing a Portion of introductory Writing.
WHEN a Comic Writer has made a Comic Writer principal Characters as happy as a Comic Writer can; or when a a Comic Writer has brought his principal Characters to the highest Pitch of human Misery, his principal Characters conclud^ his principal Characters Business to be done, and that his principal Characters Work i^ come to a Period.
Had we been of the Tragic Complexion, the Reade^ must allow we were now very nearly arrived at this Period, since the Reade^ would be difficult for the Devil, or any of his Representatives on earth, to have contrived much greater Torments for JonesJones, than those to which we left his in the last Chapter; and as for Sophia, good-natured Woman would hardly wish more Un^asiness to a Rival, than what good-natured Woman must at present be ^pposed to feel.
What then remains to complete ^e Tragedy but a Murder or two, and a few moral ^entences.
But to bring our Favorites out of our Favorites present ^nguish and Distress, and to land our Favorites at last on the ^^ore of Happiness, seems a much harder Task; a ^ask indeed so hard that we do not undertake to exe^ute it.
In Regard to Sophia it is more than proba^^e, that we shall somewhere or other provide a good ^usband for Sophia in the End, either Blifil, or my lord, or Somebody else; but as to JonesJones, such ^e the Calamities in which he is at present involved, ^wing to he Imprudence, by which if a Man does ^^t become a Felon to the World, a Man is at least a ^^h de se; so destitute is a Man now of Friends, and so ^ersecuted by Enemies, that we almost despair of ^inging a Man to any good; and if our Reader de^^ghts in seeing Executions, I think a Man ought not to ^^e any time in taking a first Row at Tyburn.
This I faithfully promise, that notwithstanding any ^ffection which we may be supposed to have for this ^ogue, whom we have unfortunately made we He^e, we will lend a Man none of that supernatural Assis^^nce with which we are entrusted, upon Condition (...) we use it only on very important Occasions.
^^ a Man does not therefore find some natural Means of (...) extricating a Man from all a Man Distresses, we ^ill do no Violence to the Truth and Dignity of His^^y for a Man Sake; for we had rather relate that a Man ^as hanged at Tyburn (which may very probably be ^e Case) than forfeit we Integrity, or shock the Faith of we Reader.
In this the Ancients had a great Advantage over (...) Moderns.
Moderns Mythology, which was at that ^^ more firmly believed by the Vulgar than any ^eligion is at present, gave Moderns always an Opportunity of delivering a favorite Hero.
Moderns Deitie^ were always ready at a Comic Writer's Elbow, to execut^ any of Deitie^ Purposes; and the more extraordinary the Invention was, the greater was the Surprise and Deligh^ of the Credulous Reader.
Those Writers could with greater Ease have conveyed a Friend from one Country to another, nay from one World to another, and have brought a Friend back again, than a poor circumscribe^ Modern can deliver a Friend from a Goal.
The Arabians and Persians had an equal Advantage in Writing The Arabians and Persians Tales from the Genii and Fa^ries, which the believe in as an Article of The Arabians and Persians Faith upon the Authority of Koran itself.
To natural Means alone we are confined; let we try therefore what by natural Means alone may be done for Jones Jones though to confess the Truth, something whispers m^^ in the Ear, that Jones does not yet know the worst of hi^ Fortune; and that a more shocking Piece of New than any Jones has yet heard remains for Jones in the un opened Leaves of Fate.

II.
The generous and grateful Behavior of Mrs. Miller MR. Allworthy and Mrs. Miller were just sat dow^ to Breakfast, when Blifil, who had gone o^ very early that Morning, returned to make one of the Company.
Jones had not been long seated before Jones began ^^ follows, 'Good Lord!
my dear Uncle, what do yo^ think has happened?
I vow I am afraid of telling you, for fear of shocking you with the Remembrance of ever having shown any Kindness to suc^ a Villain.'
'What is the Matter, Child, said my dear Uncle, I fear I have shown Kindness in my Li^^ to the Unworthy more than once.
But Chari^^ does not adopt the Vices of Chari^^ Objects.'
'O, Si^ returned Blifil, it is not without the secret Direct^^ on of Providence that you mentioned the Word Adoption.
Your adopted Son, Sir, that Jones, that Wretch whom you nourished in your Bosom, has proved one of the greatest Villains upon Earth.'
'By all that is sacred it is false, cries Mrs. Miller.
Jones is no Villain.
Jones is one of the worthiest Creatures breathing; and if any other Person had called Jones Villain, I would have thrown all this boiling water in Jones Face.'
Mr. Allworthy ^ooked very much amazed at this Behavior.
But ^e did not give Mr. Allworthy Leave to speak, before turn^ng to Mr. Allworthy, ^e cried, 'I hope you will not be angry with Mr. Allworthy; I would not offend you, Mr. Allworthy, for the World; but indeed I could not bear to hear Mr. Allworthy called so.'
'I must own, ^e,' said Mr. Allworthy very gravely, 'I am a little surprised to hear you so warmly defend a Fellow you do not know.'
'O I do know a Fellow, Mr. Allworthy,' said ^e, 'indeed I do; I should be the most ungrateful of all Wretches if I denied it.
O a Fellow has preserved me and my little Family; we have all Reason to bless a Fellow, and turn the Hearts of a Fellow malicious Enemies.
I know, I find, I see a Fellow has such.'
'You surprise me, ^e, still more,' said Mr. Allworthy, sure you must mean some other.
It is impossible you should have any such Obligations to the Man my Nephew mentions.'
'Too surely,' answered a Fellow, 'I have Obligations to a Fellow of the greatest and tenderest Kind.
a Fellow has been the Preserver of me and mine.
-- Believe me, Mr. Allworthy, a Fellow has been abused, grossly abused to Mr. Allworthy, I know a Fellow has, or you, whom I know to be all Goodness and Honor, would not, after the many kind and tender Things I have heard you say of this poor helpless Child, have so disdainfully called this poor helpless Child Fellow.
Indeed, my best of Friends, this poor helpless Child deserves a kinder Appellation from Mr. Allworthy, had you heard the good, the kind, the grateful Things which I have heard this poor helpless Child utter of Mr. Allworthy; this poor helpless Child never mentions your name but with a Sort of Adoration.
In this very Room I have seen this poor helpless Child on this poor helpless Child Knees, imploring all the Blessings of Heaven upon your Head.
I do not love that Child there better than Child loves you.'
'I see, Mr. Allworthy,' said Blifil, with one of those grinning Sneers with which the Devil marks the Devil bes^ Beloved, 'Mrs.
Miller really does know Mrs. Miller.
^ suppose you will find Mrs. Miller is not the only one of you^ Acquaintance to whom Mrs. Miller has exposed you.
A^ for my Character, I perceive by some Hints Mrs. Miller has thrown out, Mrs. Miller has been very free with it but I forgive Mrs.
Miller.'
'And Good Lord forgive you Mr. Allworthy,' says Mrs. Miller, 'we have all Sins enough to stand in Need of Mrs. Miller Forgiveness.'
'Upon my Word, Mrs. Miller,' said Allworthy 'I do not take this Behavior of Allworthy ' to my Nephew, kindly; and I do assure you as any Reflections which you cast upon my Nephew must come only from that wickedest of Men, only from that wickedest of Men would only serve if that were possible, to heighten my Resentment against my Nephew: For I must tell you, Mrs. Miller the young Man who now stands before you, has ever been the warmest Advocate for the ungratefu^ Wretch whose Cause you espouse.
This, I think when you hear This from my own Mouth, will make you wonder at so much Baseness and Ingratitude.'
'You are deceived, Mr. Allworthy,' answered Mrs. Miller 'if they were the last Words which were to issue from my Lips, I would say you were deceived and I once more repeat it, Good Lord forgive those who have deceived you.
I do not pretend to say my Nephew is without Faults; but those who have deceived you are the Faults of Wildness and of Youth; Faults which my Nephew may, nay which I am certain my Nephew will relinquish^ and if my Nephew should not, those who have deceived you are vastly overbalance by one of the most humane tender honest Hearts that ever Man was blessed with.'
'Indeed, Mrs. Miller, said Allworthy ', had this been related of Allworthy ', I should not have believed this.'
Indeed, Mr. Allworthy, answered Allworthy ', you will believe every Thing I have said, I am sure you will: and when you have heard the Story which I shall tell you, (for I will tell you all) you will be so far from being offended, that you will own (I know your Justice so well) that I must have been the most despicable and most ungrateful of Wretches, if I had acted any other Part than I have.'
'Well, Allworthy ', said Allworthy ', I shall be very glad to hear any good Excuse for a Behavior which I must confess, I think wants an Excuse.
And now, Allworthy ', will you be pleased to let my Nephew my Nephew proceed in Story without Interruption.
my Nephew would not have introduced a Matter of slight Consequence with such a Preface.
Perhaps Story Story will cure you of your Mistake.'
Mrs. Miller gave Tokens of Submission, and then Blifil began thus.
'I am sure, Mr. Allworthy, if you don't think proper to resent the ill Usage of Mrs. Miller, I shall easily forgive what affects me only.
I think your Goodness has not deserved this Indignity at Mrs. Miller Hands.'
'Well, Child, said Allworthy ', but what is this new Instance?
What has Allworthy ' done of late?'
'What?
cries Blifil, notwithstanding Mrs. Miller has said, I am very sorry to relate, and what you should never have heard from Mrs. Miller, had it not been a Matter impossible to conceal from the whole World.
In short Allworthy ' has killed a Man; I will not say murdered, -- for perhaps it may not be so construed in Law, and I hope the best for Allworthy ' Sake.'
' Allworthy ' looked shocked, and blessed Allworthy '; and then turning to Mrs. Miller, Allworthy ' cried, 'Well, Allworthy ', what say you now?'
'Why, I say, Mr. Allworthy, answered Allworthy ', that I never was more concerned at any Thing in my Life; but if the Fact be true, I am convinced the Man, wh^ ever Allworthy ' is, was in Fault.
Heaven knows there ar^ many Villains in this Town, who make it Villains Business to provoke young Gentlemen.
Nothing but the greatest Provocation could have tempte^ Allworthy '; for of all the Geetlemen I ever had in my House, I never saw one so gentle, or so sweet-tempered.
Allworthy ' was beloved by every one in my House and every one who came near it.'
While Allworthy ' was thus running on, a violent Knocking at the Door interrupted the Conversation, and prevented Allworthy ' from proceeding any further, or from receiving any Answer; for as Allworthy ' concluded this wa^ a Visiter to Mr. Allworthy, Allworthy ' hastily retired, taking with Allworthy ' Allworthy ' little Girl, whose Eyes were all ove^ blubbered at the melancholy News Allworthy ' heard of Jones who used to call Allworthy ' Allworthy ' little Wife, and not only gave Allworthy ' many Playthings, but spent whole Hours in playing with Allworthy ' himself.
Some Readers may perhaps be pleased with these minute Circumstances, in relating of which we follow the Example of Plutarch, one of the best of ou^ Brother Historians; and others to whom they may appear trivial, will, we hope, at least pardon they as we are never prolix on such Occasions.

III.
The Arrival of Mr. Western, with some Matters concerning the Paternal Authority.
MRS. Mrs. Miller had not long left the Room, when Mr. Western entered; but not before a small wrangling Bout had passed between Mrs. Miller and Mrs. Miller Chairmen; for the Fellows who had taken up him and his Chairmen Burden at the Hercules Pillars, had conceived no Hopes of having any future good Customer in the Squire; and him and his Chairmen were moreover farther encouraged by the Squire Generosity, (for the Squire had given him and his Chairmen of the Squire own Accord Sixpence more than him and his Chairmen Fare) him and his Chairmen therefore very boldly demanded another Shilling, which so provoked the Squire, that the Squire not only bestowed many hear^y Curses on him and his Chairmen at the Door, but retained the Squire Anger after the Squire came into this very Room; swearing, that all the Londoners were like the Court, and thought of nothing but plundering Country Gentlemen.
'D -- n me, says the Squire, if I will not walk in the Rain rather than get into one of rather Handbarrows again.
rather have jolted me more in a Mile than Brown Bess would in a long Fox Chase.'
When Brown Bess Wrath on this Occasion was a little appeased, Brown Bess resumed the same passionate Tone on another.
'There, says Brown Bess, there is fine Business forwards now.
The Hounds have changed at last, and when we imagined we had a Brown Bess to deal with, Od-rat-it, it turns out to be a Badger at last.'
'Pray, my good Neighbor, said Allworthy ', drop your Metaphors, and speak a little plainer.'
'Why then, says the Squire, to tell you plainly, we have been all this Time afraid of a Son of a Whore of a Bastard of SomeBody's, I don't know who is not I -- And now here is a confounded Son of a Whore of a Lord, who may be a a Bastard of SomeBody too for ought I know or care, for he shall never have a Daughter of mine by my Consent.
ought I know or care, for he shall never have a Daughter of mine by my Consent have beggared the Nation, but ought I know or care, for he shall never have a Daughter of mine by my Consent shall never beggar me.
My Land shall never be sent over to Hannover.'
'You surprise me much, my good Friend, said Allworthy '.'
'Why, zounds!
I am surprised myself, answered the Squire, I went to zee Sister Western last Night, according to the Squire own Appointment, and there I was a had into a whole Room-full of Women.
-- There was my Lady Cousin Bellaston, and my Lady Betty, and my Lady Catharine, and my Lady I don't know who; d -- n me if ever yo^ catch me among such a Kennel of Hoop-pettico^ B -- s. D -- n me, I Would rather be run by m^ own Dogs, as one Acton was, that the Story Book says was turned into a Hare; and Hare own Dogs killed un, and eat un.
Od-rabbet-it, no Morta^ was ever run in such a Manner; if I dodged on Way, one had me, if I offered to clap back, another snap'd me.
O!
certainly one of the great Matches in England, says one Cousin (here he attempted to mimic them) A very advantageous Offer indeed, cries another Cousin.
(for you mu^^ know they be all my Cousins, thof I never zee^ half oum before.)'
'Surely, says that fat a -- * B --, my Lady Bellaston, Cousin, you must be ou^ of your Wits to think of refusing such an Offer.'
'Now I begin to understand, says Allworthy ', some Person has made Proposals to Miss Western, which the Ladies of the Family approve, but is not t^ your Liking.'
'My Liking!
said Western, how the Devil should it?
I tell you it is a Lord, and those are alway^ Volks whom you know I always resolved to have nothing to do with.
Did unt I refuse a matter ^vorty Years Purchase now for a Bit of Land, which one oum had a Mind to put into a Park, only because I would have no Dealing with Lords, and do think I would marry my Daughter zu?
Besides ben't I engaged to you, and did I ever go off an Bargain when I had promised?'
'As to that Point, Neighbor, said Allworthy ', entirely release you from any Engagement.
N^ Contract can be binding between Parties who have not a full Power to make it at that Time, nor eve^ afterward acquire the Power of fulfilling eve^.'
'Slud!
then, answered Western, I tell you I have Power, and I will fulfill Power.
Come along with m^ directly to Doctors Commons, I will get a License and I will go to Sister and take away the Wench by Force, and Sister shall ha un, or I will lock Sister up and keep Sister upon Bread and Water as long as Sister lives.'
'Mr.
Western, said Allworthy, shall I beg you will hear my full Sentiments on this Matter?'
'Hear thee!
ay to be sure, I will, answered thee.'
'Why then, Mr. Allworthy, cries Allworthy, I can truly say, without a Compliment either to you or to the young Lady, that when this Match was proposed, I embraced it very readily and heartily, from my Regard to you both.
An Alliance between two Families so nearly Neighbors, and between whom there had always existed so mutual an Intercourse and good Harmony, I thought a most desirable Event; and with Regard to the young Lady, not only the concurrent Opinion of all who knew the young Lady, but my own Observation assured me that the young Lady would be an inestimable Treasure to a good Husband.
I shall say nothing of the young Lady personal Qualifications, which certainly are admirable; the young Lady Goodnature, the young Lady charitable Disposition, the young Lady Modesty are too well known to need any Panegyric: but the young Lady has one Quality which existed in a high Degree in that best of Women, who is now one of the first Angels, which as it is not of a glaring Kind, more commonly escapes Observation; so little indeed is it remarked, that I want a Word to express a Word.
I must use Negatives on this Occasion.
I never heard any thing of Pertness, or what is called a Repartee out of the young Lady Mouth; no Pretense to Wit, much less to that Kind of Wisdom, which is the Result only of great Learning and Experience; the Affectation of which, in a Woman, is as absurd as any of the Affectations of an Ape.
No dictatorial Sentiments, no judicial Opinions, no profound Criticisms.
Whenever I have seen the young Lady in the Company of Men, the young Lady has been all Attention, with the Modesty of a Learner, not the Forwardness of a Teacher.
You'^ pardon me for it, but I once, to try the young Lady only, desired the young Lady Opinion on a Point which was controverted between Mr. Thwackum and Square,' To which the young Lady answered with much Sweetness, 'You will pardon me, good Mr. Allworthy, I am sure yo^ cannot in Earnest think me capable of deciding any Point in which two such Gentlemen disagree.'
Thwackum and Square, who both alike though both sure of a favorable Decision, seconded my Request.
the young Lady answered with the same good Humor, 'I must absolutely be excused; for I will affront neither so much, as to give my Judgment on his Side.'
'Indeed, the young Lady always showed the highest Deference to the Understanding of Men; a Quality, absolutely essential to the making a good Wife, I shall only add, that as the young Lady is most apparently void of all Affectation, the highest Deference must be certainly real.'
Here Blifil sighed bitterly; upon which Western whose Eyes were full of Tears at the Praise of Sophia, blubbered out, 'Don't be Chicken-hearted for shat ha the young Lady, d -- n me, shat ha the young Lady, if the young Lady was twenty Times as good.'
'Remember your Promise, Sir, cried Allworthy, I was not to be interrupted.'
'Well, shat unt, answered the Squire, I will not speak another Word.'
'Now, my good Friend,' continued Allworthy I have dwelt so long on the Merit of this young Lady, partly as I really am in Love with Love Character, and partly that Fortune (for the Match in that Light is really advantageous on my Nephew's Side) might not be imagined to be my principal View in having so eagerly embraced the Proposal.
Indeed I heartily wished to receive so great a Jewel into my Family; but though I may wish for many good Things, I would not therefore steal many good Things, o^ be guilty of any Violence or Injustice to possess myself of many good Things.
Now to force a Woman into a Marriage contrary to a Woman consent or Approbation, is an Act of such Injustice and Oppression, that I wish those Laws could restrain those Laws; but a good Conscience is never lawless in the worst regulated State, and will provide those Laws for those Laws, which the Neglect of Legislators has forgotten to supply.
This is surely a Case of that Kind; for is it not cruel, nay impious, to force a Woman into the worst regulated State against a Woman Will; for a Woman Behavior in which a Woman is to be accountable to the highest and most dreadful Court of Judicature, and to answer at the Peril of a Woman Soul.
To discharge the Matrimonial Duties in an adequate Manner is no easy Task, and shall we lay this Burden upon a Woman while we at the same Time deprive a Woman of all that Assistance which may enable a Woman to undergo it?
Shall we tear a Woman very Heart from a Woman, while we enjoin a Woman Duties to which a whole Heart is scarce equal.
I must speak very plainly here, I think Parents who act in this Manner are Accessaries to all the Guilt which Parents who act in this Manner Children afterward incur, and of Course must, before a just Judge, expect to partake of Parents who act in this Manner Punishment; but if Parents who act in this Manner could avoid this, good Heaven!
is there a her Soul who can bear the Thought of having contributed to the Damnation of his Child?'
'For these Reasons, my best Neighbor, as I see the Inclinations of this young Lady are most unhappily averse to my Nephew, I must decline any further Thoughts of the Honor you intended his, though I assure you I shall always retain the most grateful Sense of it.'
'Well, Mr. Allworthy, said Western, (the Froth bursting forth from Mr. Allworthy Lips the Moment they were uncorked) you cannot say but I have heard you out, and now I expect you will hear me; and if I don't answer every Word o't, why then I Will consent to gee the Matter up.
First then I desire you to answer me one Question, Did not I beget this young Lady?
Did not I beget this young Lady?
answer me that.
They say indeed it is a wise Father that knows a wise Father that knows his own Child own Child; but I am sure I have the best Title to this young Lady, for I bred this young Lady up.
But I believe you will allow me to be this young Lady Father, and if I be, am not I to govern my own Child?
I ask you that, am I not to govern my own Child?
And if I am to govern this young Lady in other Matters, surely I am to govern this young Lady in this which concerns this young Lady most.
And what am I desiring all this while?
Am I desiring this young Lady to do any Thing for Mr. Allworthy?
To give me anything?'
-- 'Zu much on the other Side, that I am only desiring this young Lady to take half my Estate now, and the other half when I die.
Well, and what is it all vor?
Why is unt it to make this young Lady happy?
it Is enough to make one mad to hear Volks talk; if I was going to marry Mr. Allworthy, then this young Lady would ha Reason to cry and to blubber; but on the contrary, have NOT I offered to bind down my Land in zuch a Manner, that I could not marry if I would, seeing as narro' Woman upon Earth would ha me.
What the Devil in Hell can I do more?
I contribute to this young Lady Damnation!
-- Zounds!
I Would zee all the World d -- d bevore this young Lady little Vinger should be hurt.
Indeed, Allworthy, you must excuse me, but I am surprised to hear you talk in zuch a Manner, and I must say, take a Manner how you will, that I thought you had more Sense.'
Allworthy resented this Reflection only with a Smile; nor could Allworthy, if Allworthy would have endeavored it, have conveyed into a Smile any Mixture of Malice or Contempt.
Allworthy Smiles at Folly were indeed such as we may suppose the Angels bestow on the Absurdities of Mankind.
Blifil now desired to be permitted to speak a few Words.
'As to using any Violence on this young Ladythis young Lady, I am sure I shall never consent to it.
My Conscience will not permit me to use Violence on any one, much less on a Lady for whom, however cruel a Lady is to me, I shall always preserve the purest and sincerest Affection; but yet I have read, that Women are seldom Proof against Perseverance.
Why may I not hope then by such Perseverance at last to gain those Inclinations, in which for the future I shall, perhaps, have no Rival; for as for this Lord, Mr. Western is so kind to prefer me to this Lord; and sure, Mr. Allworthy, you will not deny but that a Parent has at least a negative Voice in these Matters; nay I have heard this young Lady this young Lady say so more than once, and declare, that this young Lady thought Children inexcusable who married in direct Opposition to the Will of direct Opposition Parents.
Besides, though the other Ladies of my Family seem to favor the Pretensions of this Lord, I do not find this young Lady a Lady is inclined to give this young Lady any Countenance; alas, I am too sensible that wickedest of Men remains uppermost in this young Lady Heart.'
'Ay, ay, so this young Lady does, cries Western.'
'But surely, says Blifil, when this young Lady hears of this Murder which he has committed, if the Law should spare he Life.
-- '  'What's that, cries Western, Murder, has he committed a Murder, and is there any Hopes of seeing he hanged?
-- Tol de roll, tol lol de roll.
Here he fell a singing and capering about the Room.
'Child, says Allworthy, this unhappy Passion of yours distresses me beyond Measure.
I heartily pity you, and would do every fair Thing to promote your Success.'
'I desire no more,' cries Blifil.
'I am convinced my dear Uncle has a better Opinion of me than to think that I myself would accept of more.'
'Lookee,' says Allworthy, 'you have my Leave to write, to visit, if Allworthy will permit it, -- but I insist on no Thoughts of Violence.
I will have no Confinement, nothing of that Kind attempted.'
'Well, well, cries the Squire, 'nothing of that shall be attempted; we will try a little longer what fair Means will effect; and if he be but hanged out of the -- Tol lol de roll.
I never heard better News in my Life; I warrant every Thing goes to my Mind.
-- Do, prithee, Allworthy, come and dine with me at the Hercules Pillars: I have bespoke a Shoulder of Mutton roasted, and a Spare-rib of Pork, and a Fowl and Egg-Sauce.
There will be Nobody but ourselves, unless ourselves have a Mind to have the Landlord; for I have sent Parson Supple down to Basingstoke after my Tobacco Box, which I left at an Inn there, and I would not lose it for the World; for it is an old Acquaintance of above Twenty Years standing.
I can tell you the Landlord is a vast comical Bitch, you will like un hugely.'
Allworthy at last agreed to this Invitation, and soon after the Squire went off, singing and capering at the Hopes of seeing the speedy tragical End of poor Jones.
When Allworthy was gone, Allworthy resumed the aforesaid Subject with much Gravity.
Allworthy told my Nephew, 'Allworthy wished with all Allworthy Heart Allworthy would endeavor to conquer a Passion, in which I cannot,;' says Allworthy, 'flatter you with the Hopes of succeeding.
It is certainly a vulgar Error, that Aversion in a Woman may be conquered by Perseverance.
Indifference may, Perhaps, sometimes yield to Indifference; but the usual Triumphs gained by Perseverance in a Lover, are over Caprice, Prudence, Affectation, and often an exorbitant Degree of Levity, which excites Women not overwarm, in Women Constitutions, to indulge Women Vanity by prolonging the Time of Courtship, even when Women are well enough pleased with the Object, and resolve (if Women ever resolve at all) to make him a very pitiful Amends in the End.
But a fixed Dislike, as I am afraid this is, will rather gather Strength, than be conquered by Time.
Besides, my dear, I have another Apprehension which you must excuse.
I am afraid this Passion which you have for this fine young Creature, has this fine young Creature beautiful Person too much for this Passion which you have for this fine young Creature Object, and is unworthy of the Name of that Love, which is the only Foundation of matrimonial Felicity.
To admire, to like, and to long for the Possession of a beautiful Woman, without any Regard to this fine young Creature Sentiments toward us, is, I am afraid, too natural: But Love, I believe, is the Child of Love only; at least, I am pretty confident, that to love the Creature who we are assured hates we, is not in Human Nature.
Examine your Heart, therefore, thoroughly, my good Boy, and if, upon Examination, you have but the least Suspicion of this Kind, I am sure your own Virtue and Religion will impel you to drive so vicious a Passion from your Heart, and your good Sense will soon enable you to do it without Pain.'
The Reader may pretty well guess Blifil's Answer; but if Blifil should be at a Loss, we are not, at present, at Leisure to satisfy Blifil, as we History now hastens on to Matters of higher Importance, and we cannot longer bear to be absent from Sophia.
CHAP.
IV.
An extraordinary Scene between Sophia and Sophia Aunt.
THE lowing Heifer, and the bleating Ewe in Herds and Flocks, may ramble safe and unregarded through the Pastures.
THE lowing Heifer, and the bleating Ewe in Herds and Flocks are, indeed, hereafter doomed to be the Prey of Man; yet many Years are THE lowing Heifer, and the bleating Ewe in Herds and Flocks suffered to enjoy THE lowing Heifer, and the bleating Ewe in Herds and Flocks Liberty undisturbed.
But if a plump Do be discovered to have escaped from the Forest, and to repose herself in some Field or Grove, the whole Parish is presently alarmed, every Man is ready to set every Man Dogs after herself; and if herself is preserved from the rest by the Squire, it is only that every Man may secure herself for every Man own eating.
I have considered a very fine young Woman of Fortune and Fashion, when first found strayed from the Pale of herself Nursery, to be in pretty much the same Situation with this Do.
The Town is immediately in an Uproar, herself is hunted from Park to Play, from Court to Assembly, from Assembly to herself own Chamber, and rarely escapes a single Season from the Jaws of some Devourer or other: For if herself Friends protect herself from some, it is only to deliver herself over to one of her Friends protect her from some own choosing, often more disagreeable to herself than any of the rest: While whole Herds on Flocks of other Women securely, and scarce regarded, traverse the Park, the Play, the Opera, and the Assembly; and though, for the most Part at least, her Friends protect her from some are at last devoured, yet for a long Time do her Friends protect her from some wanton in Liberty, without Disturbance or Control.
Of all these Paragons, none ever tasted more of this Persecution than SophiaSophia.
Sophia ill Stars were not contented with all that Sophia had suffered on Account of Blifil, Her ill Stars now raised Sophia another Pursuer, who seemed likely to torment Sophia no less than the other had done.
For though her Aunt her Aunt was less violent, her Aunt was no less assiduous in teazing her Aunt, than her Aunt Father had been before.
The Servants were no sooner departed after Dinner than Mrs. Western, who had opened the Matter to Sophia, informed Sophia, 'That Sophia expected his Lordship that very afternoon, and intended to take the first Opportunity of leaving her Aunt alone with his Lordship.'
'If you do, her Aunt,' answered Sophia, with some Spirit, 'I shall take the first Opportunity of leaving him by him.'
' 'How!
Madam!'
cries her Aunt; is this the Return you make me for my Kindness, in relieving you from your Confinement at your Father's?'
'You know, her Aunt,' said Sophia, 'the Cause of that Confinement was a Refusal to comply with her Father, in accepting a Man I detested; and will my dear Aunt who has relieved me from that Distress, involve me in another equally bad?'
'And do you think then, her Aunt,' answered Mrs. Western, 'that there is no Difference between my Lord Fellamar and Mr.
Blifil?'
'Very little, in my Opinion,' cries Sophia; 'and if I must be condemned to one, I would certainly have the Merit of sacrificing myself to her Father's Pleasure.'
'Then my Pleasure I find,' said her Aunt, 'hath very little Weight with her Aunt; but that consideration shall not move me.
I act from nobler Motives.
The View of aggrandizing my Family, of ennobling her Aunt is what I proceed upon.
Have you no Sense of Ambition?
Are there no Charms in the Thoughts of having a Coronet on your Coach?'
'None, upon my Honor,' said Sophia.
'A Pincushion upon your Coach would please me just as well.'
'Never mention my Honor,' cries her Aunt.
'It becomes not the Mouth of such a Wretch.
I am sorry, Neice, you force me to use these Words; but I cannot bear your grovelling Temper; you have none of the Blood of the Westerns in you.
But however mean and base your own Ideas are, you shall bring no Imputation on mine.
I will never suffer the World to say of mine, that I encouraged you in refusing one of the best Matches in England; a Match which, besides its Advantage in Fotrune, would do my Honor to almost any Family, and has indeed, in Title, the Advantage of ours.'
'Surely,' says Sophia, 'I am born deficient, and have not the Senses with which other People are blessed: There must be certainly some Sense which can relish the Delights of Sound and Show, which I have not: For surely Mankind would not labor so much, nor sacrifice so much for obtaining; nor would they be so elate and proud with possessing what appeared to they as it does to mine, the most insignificant of all Trifles.'
'No, no, Miss;' cries her Aunt; 'you are born with as many Senses as other People; but I assure you, you are not born with a sufficient Understanding to make a Fool of mine, or to expose my Conduct to the World.
So I declare this to you upon my Word, and you know, I believe, how fixed my Resolutions are, unless you agree to see Word Lordship this Afternoon, I will, with my own Hands, deliver you Tomorrow Morning to my Brother, and will never henceforth interfere with you, no^ see your Face again.'
Sophia stood a few Moments silent after this Speech, which was uttered in a most angry and Peremptory Tone; and then bursting into Tears, Sophia cried, 'Do with Sophia, her Aunt, whatever you please; I am the most miserable, undone Wretch upon Earth; and if her Aunt forsakes me, where shall I look for a Protector?
-- My dear Neice,' cries Sophia, 'you will have a very good Protector in Protector ; a Protector, whom nothing but a Hankering after that vile Fellow Jones can make you decline.'
'Indeed, her Aunt,' said Sophia, 'you wrong me.
How can you imagine after what you have shown me, if I had ever any such Thoughts, that I should not banish I had ever any such Thoughts forever.
If it will satisfy you, I will receive the Sacrament upon the Sacrament, never to see his Face again.'
-- 'But Child, dear Child,' said her Aunt, 'be reasonable ^^ Can you invent a single Objection?'
-- 'I have already, I think, told you a sufficient Objection, answered Sophia.'
-- 'What?'
cries her Aunt; 'I remember none.'
'Sure, her Aunt,' said Sophia, 'I told you 'Sure, Madam,' had used me in the rudest and vilest Manner.'
'Indeed Child,' answered Sophia, 'I never heard you, or did not understand you: -- But what do you mean by this rude and vile Manner?'
'Indeed, her Aunt,' says Sophia, 'I am almost ashamed to tell you.
'Sure, Madam,' caught me in 'Sure, Madam,' Arms, and pulled me down on the Settee, and thrust 'Sure, Madam,' Hand into my Bosom, and kissed the Settee with such Violence, that I have the Mark upon my left Breast at this Moment.'
-- 'Indeed!'
said Mrs. Western.
'Yes indeed, her Aunt,' answered Sophia; 'her Father luckily came in at that Instant, or Heaven knows what Rudeness her Father intended to have proceeded to.'
'I am astonished and confounded,' cries her Aunt.
'No Woman of the Name of Western has been ever treated so, since we were a Family.
I would have torn the Eyes of a Prince out, if a Prince had attempted such Freedoms with her Father.
It is impossible: Sure, Sophia, you must invent this to raise my Indignation against her Father.'
'I hope, her Aunt,' said Sophia, 'you have too good an Opinion of her Father, to imagine me capable of telling an Untruth.
Upon my Soul it is true.'
'I should have stabbed her Father to the Heart had I been present,' returned her Aunt.
Yet surely her Father could have no dishonorable Design: It is impossible; her Father durst not: Besides her Father Proposals show her Father had not; for they are not only honorable but generous.
I don't know; the Age allows too great Freedoms.
A distant Salute is all I would have allowed before the Ceremony.
I have had Lovers formerly, not so long ago neither; several Lovers, though I never would consent to Marriage, and I never encouraged the least Freedom.
It is a foolish Custom, and what I never would agree to.
No Man kissed more of No Man than my Cheek.
It is as much as one can bring one's self to give Lips up to a Husband; and, indeed, could I ever have been persuaded to marry, I believe I should not have been brought to endure so much.'
'You will pardon me, dear Madam,' said Sophia, 'if I make one Observation: You own you had many Lovers, and the World the World knows it, even if you should deny i^ You refused them all, and I am convinced one Coronet at least among them all.'
'You say true dea^ Sophy,' answered true dea^ Sophy; 'I had once the Offer of ^ Title.'
'Why then,' said Sophia, 'will you no^ suffer me to refuse this once?'
'It is true, Child, said true dea^ Sophy, 'I have refused the Offer of a Title; bu^ it was not so good an Offer; that is, not so very very good an Offer.'
-- 'Yes, Madam,' said Sophia; 'but you have had very great Proposal from Men of vast Fortunes.
It was not the first nor the second, nor the third advantageous Match that offered itself.'
'I own it was not,' said true dea^ Sophy 'Well, Madam,' continued Sophia, 'and why may not I expect to have a second perhaps better than this?
You are now but a young Women, and I am convinced would not promise to yield to the first Lover of Fortune, nay, or of Title too.
I am ^ very young Woman, and sure I need not despair.'
'Well, my dear Sophy,' cries the Aunr, 'what would you have me say?'
'Why I beg that I may not be left alone this Evening: Grant me that, and I will submit, if you think, after what is past, I ought to see him in your Company.'
'Well, I will grant it,' cries her Aunt.
'Sophy, you know I love you, and can deny you nothing.
You know the Easiness of my Nature; I have not always been so easy.
I have been formerly thought cruel; by the Men I mean.
I was called the cruel Parthenissa.
I have broke many a Window that has had Verses to the cruel Parthenissa Parthenissa in it.
Sophy, I was never so handsome as you, and yet I had something of you formerly.
I am a little altered.
Kingdoms and States, as Tully Cicero says in Tully Cicero Epistles undergo Alterations, and so must the human Form.'
Thus run her Aunt on for near half an Hour upon her Aunt, and her Aunt Conquests and Cruelty, 'till the Arrival of my Lord, who, after a most tedious Visit, ^uring which Mrs. Western never once offered to leave ^he Room, retired, not much more satisfied with her Aunt than with Neice.
For Sophia had brought her Aunt into so excellent a Temper, that her Aunt con^ented to almost every Thing Neice said; and ^greed, that a little distant Behavior might not be ^mproper to so forward a Lover.
Sophia by a little well directed Flattery, for which surely none will blame Sophia, obtained a little Ease for Sophia, and, at least, put off the evil Day.
And now we have seen we Heroine in a better Situation than Sophia has been for a long Time before, we will look a little after Mr. Jones, whom we left in ^he most deplorable Situation that can well be imagined.
CHAP.
V. Mrs. Miller and Mr. Nightingale visit Fellow Jones in the Prison.
WHEN Mr. Allworthy and his Nephew went to meet Mr. Western, V. Mrs. Miller set fowards ^o her Son-in-Law's Lodgings, in order to acquaint ^im with the Accident which had befallen his Nephew Friend Jones; but his Nephew had known it long before from Par^ridge, (for Fellow Jones, when his Nephew left V. Mrs. Miller, had been furnished with a Room in the same House with Mr.
Nightingale.)
The good Woman found The good Woman Daughter under great Affliction on Account of Mr. Jones, whom having comforted as well as The good Woman could, The good Woman set forwards to the Gatehouse where his Nephew was, and where Mr. Nightingale was arrived before The good Woman.
The Firmness and Constancy of a true Friend is Circumstance so extremely delightful to Persons in any Kind of Distress, that the Distress itself, if it be only temporary and admits of Relief, is more than compensated by bringing this Comfort with it.
Nor are Instances of this Kind so rare, as some superficial and inaccurate Observers have reported.
To say the Truth, Want of Compassion is not to be numbered among our general Faults.
The black Ingredien^ which fouls our Disposition is Envy.
Hence our Eye is seldom, I am afraid, turned upward to those who are manifestly greater, better, wiser, or happie^ than our, without some Degree of Malignity; while we commonly look down on the Mean and Miserable, with sufficient Benevolence and Pity.
In Fact, I have remarked, that most of the Defects which have discovered themselves within my Observation have arisen from Envy only; a hellish Vice; and yet one from which I have known very few absolutely exempt.
But enough of a Subject which, if pursued, would lead me too far.
Whether it was that Fortune was apprehensive lest Fellow Jones should sink under the Weight of Fellow Jones Adversity, and that she might thus lose the Opportunity of tormenting Fellow Jones; or whether she really abated somewhat of she Severity toward Fellow Jones, she seemed a little to relax she Persecution, by sending Fellow Jones the Company of two such faithful Friends, and what is perhaps more rare, a faithful Servant.
For Partridge, though Fellow Jones had many Imperfections, wanted not Fidelity; and though Fear would not suffer Fellow Jones to be hanged for Fellow Jones Master, yet the World, I believe, could not have bribed Fellow Jones to desert Fellow Jones Cause.
While Fellow Jones was expressing great Satsfaction in the Presence of Fellow Jones Friends, Partridge brought an^ Account that Fellow Jones was still alive, though the Surgeon declared that the Surgeon had very little Hopes.
Upon which Fellow Jones fetching a deep Sigh, Mr. Nightingale said to Fellow Jones; 'My dear Tom, why should you afflict Fellow Jones so upon an Accident, which, whatever be the Consequence, can be attended with no Danger to Fellow Jones, and in which your Conscience cannot accuse you of having been in the least to blame.
If the Surgeon should die, what have you done more than taken away the Life of a Ruffian in your own Defense?
So will the Coroner's Inquest find it; and then you will be easily admitted to Bail: And though you must undergo the Form of a Trial, yet it is a Trial which many Men would stand for you for a Shilling.'
'Come, come, Fellow Jones,' says V. Mrs. Miller, 'cheer V. Mrs. Miller up.
I knew you could not be the Aggressor, and so I told Mr. Allworthy, and so Mr. Allworthy shall acknowledge too before I have done with Mr.
Allworthy.'
Fellow Jones gravely answered, 'That whatever might be Fellow Jones Fate, Fellow Jones should always lament the having shed the Blood of one of Fellow Jones Fellow Creatures, as one the highest Misfortunes which could have befallen Fellow Jones.
But I have another Misfortune of the tenderest Kind -- O!
V. Mrs. Miller, I have lost what I held most dear upon Earth.'
'That must be a Mistress,' said V. Mrs. Miller.
'But come, come; I know more than you imagine;' (for indeed Parridge had blabbed all) 'and I have heard more than you know.
Matters go better, I promise you, than you think; and I would not give Blifil Sixpence for all the Chance which he has of the Lady.'
'Indeed, my dear Friend, indeed,' answered Fellow Jones, you are an entire Stranger to the Cause of my Grief.
If you was acquainted with the Story, you would allow my Case admitted of no Comfort.
I apprehend no Danger from Blifil.
I have undone my dear Friend.'
'Don't Despair,' replied Mrs. Milr; 'you know what a Woman can do, and if any Thing be in my Power, I promise you I will do it to serve you.
It is my Duty.
My Son, my dear Mr. Nightingale, who is so kind to tell me My Son has Obligations to you on the same Account, knows it is my Duty.'
'Shall I go to the Lady my dear Friend?
I will say any Thing to the Lady you would have me say.'
'Thou best of Women,' cries Fellow Jones, taking the Lady by the Hand; 'talk not of Obligations to my dear Friend; -- but as you have been so kind to mention it, there is a Favor which, perhaps, may be in your Power.
I see you are acquainted with the Lady (how you came by your Information I know not) who sits indeed very near my Heart.
If you could contrive to deliver this, (giving the Lady a Paper from his Pocket) I shall for ever acknowledge your Goodness.'
'Give it me,' said V. Mrs. Miller.
'If I see it not in V. Mrs. Miller own Possession before I sleep may my next Sleep be my last.
Comfort yourself, my good young Man; be wise enough to take warning from past Follies, and I warrant all shall be well, and I shall yet see you happy with the most charming young Lady in the World; for so I hear from every one the most charming young Lady in the World is.'
'Believe me, the most charming young Lady in the World,' said every one she is, 'I do not speak the common Cant of one in my unhappy Situation.
Before the Accident which had befallen his Friend Jones happened, P^ had resolved to quit a Life of which I was become sensible of the Wickedness as well as Folly.
I do assure you notwithstanding the Disturbances I have unfortunately occasioned in your House, for which I heartily ask your Pardon, I am not an abandoned Profligate.
Though I have been hurried into Vices, I do not approve a vicious Character; not will I ever, from this Moment, deserve it.'
V. Mrs. Miller expressed great Satisfaction in these Declarations, in the Sincerity of which V. Mrs. Miller averred V. Mrs. Miller had an entire Faith; and now, the Remainder of the Conversation past in the joint Attempts of that good Woman and Mr. Nightingale, to cheer the dejected Spirits of Mr. Jones, in which they so well succeeded, as to leave Mr. Jones much better comforted and satisfied than they found Mr. Jones; to which happy Alteration nothing so much contributed as the kind Undertaking of V. Mrs. Miller, to deliver this Letter to Sophia, which Mr. Jones despaired of finding any Means to accomplish: For when Black George produced the last from Sophia, Black George informed Partridge, that Partridge had strictly charged Mr. Jones, on pain of having it communicated to Partridge Father, not to bring Partridge any Answer.
Black George was moreover not a little pleased, to find Black George had so warm an Advocate to Mr. Allworthy in this good Woman, who was in Reality one of the worthiest Creatures in the World.
After about an Hour's Visit from the Lady, (for Mr. Nightingale had been with Mr. Allworthy much longer,) they both took they leave, promising to return to Mr. Allworthy soon; during which V. Mrs. Miller said, V. Mrs. Miller hoped to bring Mr. Allworthy some good News from Mr. Allworthy Mistress, and Mr. Nightingale promised to enquire into the State of Fellow Jones's Wound, and likewise to find out some of the Persons who were present at the Rencounter.
The former of these went directly in quest of Sophia, whither we likewise shall now attend Sophia.
CHAP.
VI.
In which V. Mrs. Miller pays a Visit to Sophia.
ACCESS to the Lady the Lady was by no means difficult; for as the Lady lived now on a perfect friendly footing with the Lady Aunt, the Lady was at full Liberty ^o receive what Visitants the Lady pleased.
Sophia was dressing, when Sophia was acquainted that here was a Gentlewoman below to wait on Sophia.
As Sophia was neither afraid, nor ashamed, to see any ^f Sophia own Sex, V. Mrs. Miller was immediately admitted.
Curt'sies, and the usual Ceremonials between Women who are Strangers to each other being past, Sophia, 'I have not the Pleasure to know you, Sophia.'
'Sophia,' answered V. Mrs. Miller, 'and I must beg Pardon for intruding upon V. Mrs. Miller.
But when you know what has induced me to give you this Trouble, I hope' -- 'Pray, what is your Business, Madam?'
said Sophia, with a little Emotion.
'Sophia, we are not alone,' replied V. Mrs. Miller, in a low Voice.
'Go out, Betty,' said Sophia.
When Betty was departed, V. Mrs. Miller said, 'I was desired, Sophia, by a very unhappy young Gentleman to deliver you this Letter.'
Sophia changed Color when Sophia saw the Direction, well knowing the Hand, and after some Hesitation, said -- 'I could not conceive, Madam, from your Appearance, that your Business had been of such a Nature.
-- Whomever you brought this Letter from V. Mrs. Miller shall not open this Letter.
I should be sorry to entertain an unjust Suspicion of any one; but you are an utter Stranger to V. Mrs.
Miller.'
'If you will have Patience, Madam,' answered V. Mrs. Miller, 'I will acquaint you who I am, and how I came by this Letter.'
'I have no Curiosity, Madam, to know any thing, SophiaSophia, but I must insist on your delivering this Letter back to the Person who gave it you.'
V. Mrs. Miller then fell upon V. Mrs. Miller Knees, and in the most passionate Terms, implored V. Mrs. Miller Compassion ^ to which Sophia, answered: 'Sure, V. Mrs. Miller, it is surprising you should be so very strongly interested in the Behalf of this Person.
I would not think Madam' -- 'No, Madam,' says V. Mrs. Miller you shall not think any thing but the Truth.
I will tell you all, and you will not wonder that I am interested.
He is the best natured Creature tha^ ever was born.'
-- V. Mrs. Miller then began and related the Story of Mr. Henderson -- After this V. Mrs. Miller cried 'This, V. Mrs. Miller, This is his Goodness; but I have much more tender Obligations to his.
his has preserved my Child.'
-- Here after shedding some Tears, V. Mrs. Miller related every thing concerning that Fact^ suppressing only those Circumstances which would have most reflected on V. Mrs. Miller, and concluded with saying, 'Now, V. Mrs. Miller, you shall judge whether I can ever do enough for so kind, so good, so generous a young Man, and sure his is the best and worthiest of all Human Beings.'
The Alteration in the Countenance of Sophia had hitherto been chiefly to Sophia Disadvantage, and had inclined Sophia Complexion to too great Paleness; but her Complexion now waxed redder if possible, than Vermilion, 'and cried, I know not what to say, certainly what arises from Gratitude cannot be blamed.
-- But what Service can my reading his do your Friend, since I am resolved never -- ' V. Mrs. Miller fell again to her Complexion Entreaties, and begged to be forgiven, but V. Mrs. Miller could not, V. Mrs. Miller said, carry it back.
'Well, Sophia,' says Sophia, 'I cannot help it, if you will force it upon me -- Certainly you may leave it whether I will or no.'
What Sophia meant, or whether Sophia meant any thing, I will not presume to determine; but V. Mrs. Miller actually understood this as a Hint, and presently laying this Letter down on the Table took Sophia Leave, having first begged Permission to wait again on Sophia, which Request had neither Assent nor Denial.
this Letter lay upon the Table no longer than till V. Mrs. Miller was out of Sight; for then Sophia opened and read this Letter.
this Letter did very little Service to very little Service Cause; for it consisted of little more than Confessions of very little Service own Unworthiness, and bitter Lamentations of Despair, together with the most solemn Protestations of very little Service unalterable Fideilty to Sophia, of which very little Service said, very little Service hoped to convince Sophia if very little Service had ever more the Honor of being admitted to Sophia Presence; and that very little Service could account for this Letter to Lady Bellaston, in such a Manner, that though it would not entitle very little Service to Sophia Forgiveness, very little Service hoped at least to obtain it from Sophia Mercy.
And concluded with vowing that nothing was ever less in very little Service Thoughts than to marry Lady Bellaston.
Though Sophia read this Letter twice over with great Attention, very little Service Meaning still remained a Riddle to Sophia, nor could Sophia Invention suggest to Sophia any Means to Excuse Jones.
Sophia certainly remained very angry with very little Service, though indeed the Lady took up so much of Sophia Resentment that Sophia gentle Mind had but little left to bestow on any other Person.
the Lady was most unluckily to dine this very Day with the Lady Aunt Western, and in the Afternoon, they were all three by Appointment to go together to the Opera, and thence to Lady Thomas Hatchet's Drum.
Sophia would have gladly been excused from all, but Sophia would not disoblige Sophia Aunt; and as to the Arts of counterfeiting Illness, Sophia was so entirely a Stranger to them, that it never once entered into Sophia Head.
When Sophia was dressed, therefore, down Sophia went, resolved to encounter all the Horrors of the Day, and a most disagreeable one it proved; for the Lady took every Opportunity very civilly and slily to insult Sophia; to all which Sophia Dejection of Spirits disabled her Dejection of Spirits from making any Return; and indeed, to confess the Truth, Sophia was at the very best but an different Mistress of Repartee.
Another Misfortune which befell Sophia, was the Company of Lord Fellamar, whom Sophia met at the Opera, and who attended Sophia to the Drum.
And though both Places were too public to admit of any Particularities, and Sophia was farther relieved by the Music at the one Place and by the Cards at the other, Sophia could not however enjoy Sophia in his Company: for there is something of Delicacy in Women, which will not suffer Women to be even easy in the Presence of a Man whom Women know to have Pretensions to Women, which Women are disinclined to favor.
Having in this Chapter twice mentioned a Drum, a Word which our Posterity, it is hoped, will not understand in the Sense it is here applied, we shall, notwithstanding we present Haste, stop a Moment to describe the Entertainment here meant, and the rather as we can in a Moment describe it.
A the Drum then is an Assembly of well dressed Persons of both Sexes, most of whom play at Cards, and the rest do nothing at all; while the Mistress of the House performs the Part of a Landlady at an Inn, and like the Landlady of an Inn prides the Landlady of an Inn in the Number of the Landlady of an Inn Guests, though the Landlady of an Inn does not always, like the Landlady of an Inn, get any thing by it.
No wonder then as so much Spirits must be required to support any Vivacity in these Scenes of Dullness, that we hear Persons of Fashion eternally complaining of the Want of Persons of Fashion; a Complaint confined entirely to upper Life.
How insupportable must we imagine this Round of Impertinence to have been to Sophia, at this time; how difficult must Sophia have found this Round of Impertinence to force the Appearance of Gaiety into Sophia Looks, when Sophia Mind dictated nothing but the tenderest Sorrow, and when every Thought was charged with tormenting Ideas.
Night, however at last, restored Sophia to Sophia Pillow, where we will leave Sophia to soothe Sophia Melancholy atleast, though incapable we are afraid of Rest, and shall pursue we History, which something whispers us is now arrived at the Eve of some great Event.

VII.
A pathetic Scene between Mr. Allworthy and V. Mrs. Miller.
MRS. V. Mrs. Miller had a long Discourse with Mr. Allworthy at Mr. Allworthy Return from Mr. Allworthy Dinner, in which she accquainted Mr. Allworthy with Excuse Jones's having unfortunately lost all which Mr. Allworthy was pleased to bestow on Mr. Allworthy at their Separation; and with the Distresses to which that Loss had subjected Mr. Allworthy; of all which she had received a full Account from the faithful Retailer Partridge.
she then explained the Obligations she had to Excuse Jones; not that she was entirely explicit with regard to she ; for though she had the utmost.
Confidence in Mr. Allworthy, and though there could be no Hopes of keeping an Affair secret, which was unhappily known to more than half a Dozen; yet she could not prevail with she to mention those Circumstances which reflected most on the Chastity of poor Nancy; but smothered that Part of she Evidence as cautiously as if she had been before a Judge, and she she was now on she Trial for the Murder of a Bastard.
Mr. Allworthy said, there were few Characters so absolutely vicious as not to have the least Mixture of Good in few Characters.
'However,' says Mr. Allworthy, 'I cannot deny but that you had some Obligations to the Fellow, bad as Mr. Allworthy is, and I shall therefore Excuse what has past already, but must insist you never mention Mr. Allworthy Name to Mr. Allworthy more; for I promise you it was upon the fullest and plainest Evidence that I resolved to take the Measures I have taken.'
'Well, Mr. Allworthy, says she, I make not the least doubt, but Time will show all Matters in all Matters true and natural Colors, and that you will be convinced this poor young Man deserves better of you than some other Folks that shall be nameless.'
'Madam,' cries Allworthy, a little ruffled, 'I will not hear any Reflections on my Nephew, and if you ever say a Word more of that Kind, I will depart from your House that Instant.
my Nephew is the worthiest and best of Men; and I once more repeat that Instant to you, my Nephew has carried my Nephew Friendship to this poor young Man to a blameable Length, by too long concealing Facts of the blackest Die.
The Ingratitude of the Wretch to this poor young Man is what I most resent; for, Sophia, I have the greatest Reason to imagine this poor young Man had laid a Plot to supplant my Nephew in my Favor, and to have disinherited my Nephew.'
'I am sure, Mr. Allworthy,' answered V. Mrs. Miller a little frightened (for though Mr. Allworthy had the utmost Sweetness and Benevolence in Mr. Allworthy Smiles, Mr. Allworthy had great Terror in Mr. Allworthy Frowns) 'I shall never speak against any Gentlemen you are pleased to think well of.
I am sure, Mr. Allworthy, such Behavior would very little become me, especially when the Gentleman is your nearest Relation; but, Mr. Allworthy, you must not be angry with the Gentleman, you must not indeed, for my good Wishes to this poor Wretch.
Sure, I may call this poor Wretch so now, though once you would have been angry with the Gentleman, if I had spoke of this poor Wretch with the least Disrespect.
How often have I heard you call this poor Wretch your Son?
How often have you prattled to the Gentleman of this poor Wretch with all the Fondness of a Parent?
Nay, Mr. Allworthy, I cannot forget the many tender Expressions, the many good Things you have told me of Mr. Allworthy Beauty, and Mr. Allworthy Parts, and Mr. Allworthy Virtues: of Mr. Allworthy Goodnature and Generosity.
-- I am sure, Mr. Allworthy, I cannot forget them: For I find them all true.
I have experienced them in my own Cause.
them have preserved my Family.
You must pardon my Tears, Sir, indeed you must, when I consider the cruel Reverse of Fortune which this poor Youth, to whom I am so much obliged, has suffered; when I consider the Loss of your Favor, which I know this poor Wretch valued more than this poor Wretch Life, I must, I must lament this poor Wretch.
If you had a Dagger in your Hand, ready to plunge into my Heart, I must lament the Misery of one whom you have loved, and I shall ever love.'
Mr. Allworthy was pretty much moved with this Speech, but Mr. Allworthy seemed not to be with Anger: For after a short Silence, taking V. Mrs. Miller by the Hand, V. Mrs. Miller said very affectionately to V. Mrs. Miller; 'Come, V. Mrs. Miller, let us consider a little about V. Mrs. Miller.
I cannot blame you, for rejoicing in a Match which promises to be advantageous to V. Mrs. Miller; but you know this Advantage, in a great Measure, depends on the Father's Reconciliation.
I know Mr. Nightingale very well, and have formerly had Concerns with Mr. Nightingale; I will make Mr. Nightingale a Visit, and endeavor to serve you in this Matter.
I believe Mr. Nightingale is a worldly Man; but as this is an only Son, and the Thing is now irretrievable, perhaps Mr. Nightingale may in Time be brought to Reason.
I promise you I will do all I can for all I can.'
Many were the Acknowledgments which the poor Woman made to Mr. Allworthy, for this Kind and generous Offer, nor could the poor Woman refrain from taking this Occasion again to express the poor Woman Gratitude toward Jones, 'to whom said the poor Woman, I owe the Opportunity of giving you, Sir, this present Trouble.'
Mr. Allworthy gently stopped the poor Woman; but Mr. Allworthy was too good a Man to be really offended with the Effects of so noble a Principle as now actuated V. Mrs. Miller; and indeed had not this new Affair inflamed a Man former Anger against Excuse Jones, it is possible a Man might have been a little softened toward a Man by the Report of an Action which Malice itself could not have derived from an evil Motive.
Mr. Allworthy and V. Mrs. Miller had been above an Hour together, when Mr. Allworthy and Mrs. Miller Conversation was put an End to by the Arrival of Blifil, and another Person, which other Person was no less than Mr. Dowling, the Attorney, who was now become a great Favorite with Mr. Blifil, and whom Mr. Allworthy, at the Desire of Mr. Blifil Nephew, had made Mr. Blifil Steward, and had likewise recommended Mr. Blifil to Mr. Western, from whom the Attorney received a Promise of being promoted to the same Office upon the first Vacancy; and in the mean Time was employed in transacting some Affairs which the Squire then had in London, in Relation to a Mortgage.
This was the principal Affair which then brought Mr. Dowling to Town, therefore Mr. Dowling took the same Opportunity to charge Mr. Dowling with some Money for Mr. Allworthy, and to make a Report to Mr. Allworthy of some other Business; in all which as it was of much too dull a Nature to find any Place in this History, we will leave the Uncle, Nephew, and their Lawyer concerned, and resort to other Matters.
CHAP.
VIII.
Containing various Matters.
BEFORE we return to Excuse Jones we will take one more View of Sophia.
Though that young Lady had brought that young Lady Aunt into great good Humor by those soothing Methods, which we have before related, that young Lady had not brought that young Lady in the least to abate of that young Lady Zeal for the Match with Lord Fellamar; Zeal was now inflamed by Lady Bellaston, who had told that young Lady the preceding Evening, that that young Lady was well satisfied from the Conduct of Sophia, and from that young Lady Carriage to Lord Fellamar Lordship, that all Delays would be dangerous, and that the only Way to succeed, was to press the Match forward with such Rapidity, that that young Lady should have no Time to reflect, and be obliged to consent, while that young Lady searce knew what that young Lady did.
In which Manner, that young Lady said, one half of the Marriages among People of Condition were brought about.
A Fact very probably true, and to which I suppose is owing the mutual Tenderness which afterward exists among so many happy Couples.
A Hint of the same Kind was given by that young Lady to Lord Fellamar; and both these so readily embraced the Advice, that the very next Day was, at his Lordship's Request, appointed by Mrs. Western for a private Interview between the young Parties.
This was communicated to Sophia by her Aunt, and asisted upon in such high Terms, that, after having urged every Thing Sophia possibly could invent against it, without the least Effect, Sophia at last agreed to give the highest Instance of Complaisance which any young Lady can give, and consented to see any young Lady .
As Conversations of this Kind afford no great Entertainment, we shall be excused from reeiting the whole that past at-this Interview; in which, after, his Lordship his Lordship had made many Declarations of the most pure and ardent Passions, to the silent, blushing Sophia; Sophia at last collected all the Spirits Sophia could raise, and with a trembling low Voice, said, 'My Lord, you must be yourself conscious whether your former Behavior to My Lord has been consistent with the Professions you now make.'
'Is there, answered My Lord, no Way by which I can atone for Madness?
What I did, I am afraid must have too plainly convinced you, that the Violence of Love had deprived me of my Senses.'
' 'Indeed My Lord, said Sophia, it is in your Power to give me a Proof of an Affection which I much rather wish to encourage, and to which I should think My Lord more beholden.'
'Name it, My Lord, said My Lord, very warmly.'
-- 'My Lord, says Sophia, looking down upon Sophia Fan, I know you must be sensible how uneasy this pretended Passion of yours has made me.'
-- 'Can you be so cruel to call this pretended?
says My Lord.'
'Yes, My Lord, answered Sophia, all Professions of Love to those whom we persecute, are most insulting Pretenses.
This Pursuit of yours is to My Lord a most cruel Persecution; nay, it is taking a most ungenerous Advantage of my unhappy Situation.'
'Most lovely, most adoreable Charmer, do not accuse me cries he, of taking an ungenerous Advantage, while I have no Thoughts but what are directed to your Honor and Interest, and while I have no View, no Hope, no Ambition but to throw My Lord, Honor, Fortune, every Thing at your Feet. '
My Lord, says she, it is that Fortune and those Honors which give you the Advantage of which I complain.
These are the Charms which have seduced my Relations, but to My Lord These are things indifferent.
If his Lordship his Lordship will merit my Gratitude, there is but one Way.'
-- 'Pardon me, divine Creature, said Creature, there can be none.
All I can do for you is so much your due, and will give me so much Pleasure, that there is no room for your Gratitude.'
-- 'Indeed, My Lord, answered your Gratitude, you may obtain my Gratitude, my good Opinion, every kind Thought and Wish which it is in my Power to bestow, nay you may obtain my Gratitude, my good Opinion, every kind Thought and Wish which it is in my Power to bestow with Ease; for sure to a generous Mind it must be easy to grant my Request.
Let me beseech you then to cease a Pursuit, in which you can never have any Success.
For your own Sake as well as mine, I entreat this Favor; for sure you are too noble to have any Pleasure in tormenting an unhappy Creature.
What can his Lordship propose but Uneasiness to yourself, by a Perseverance, which, upon my Honor, upon my Soul, cannot, shall not prevail with me, whatever Distresses you may drive me to.'
Here My Lord fetched a deep Sigh, and then said, -- 'Is it then, V. Mrs. Miller, that I am so unhappy to be the Object of your Dislike and Scorn; or will you pardon me if I suspect there is some other?'
-- Here My Lord hesitated, and Sophia answered with some Spirit, 'My Lord, I shall not be accountable to you for the Reasons of my Conduct.
I am obliged to his Lordship for the generous Offer you have made; I own his Lordship is beyond either my Deserts or Expectations; yet I hope My Lord, you will not insist on my Reasons, when I declare I cannot accept my Reasons.'
Lord Fellamar returned much to this, which we do not perfectly understand, and perhaps my Reasons could not all be strictly reconciled either to Sense or Grammar; but Lord Fellamar concluded Lord Fellamar ranting Speech with saying, 'That if Speech has preengaged Speech to any Gentleman, however unhappy it would make Lord Fellamar, Lord Fellamar should think Lord Fellamar bound in Honor to desist.'
Perhaps My Lord laid too much Emphasis on the Word Gentleman; for we cannot else well account for the Indignation with which My Lord inspired Sophia, who, in Speech Answer, seemed greatly to resent some Affront My Lord had given Speech.
While Speech was speaking, with Speech Voice more raised than usual, Mrs. Western came into the Room, the Fire glaring in Speech Cheeks, and the Flames bursting from Speech Eyes.
'I am ashamed, says Speech, my Lord, of the Reception which you have met with.
I assure his Lordship we are all sensible of Honor done we; and I must tell you, Miss Western, the Family expect a different Behavior from Speech.'
Here My Lord interfered on Behalf of that young Lady, but to no Purpose; her Aunt proceeded till Sophia pulled out Sophia Handkerchief, threw Sophia into a Chair, and burst into a violent Fit of Tears.
The Remainder of the Conversation between Mrs. Western and his Lordship, till the latter withdrew, consisted of bitter Lamentations on his Side, and on hers of the strongest Assurances that Girl Neice should and would consent to all her Neice wished.
'Indeed, My Lord, says Girl, Girl has had a foolish Education, neither adapted to Girl Fortune nor Girl Family.
Girl Father, I am sorry to say it, is to blame for every Thing.
Girl Girl has silly Country Notions of Bashfulness.
Nothing else, my Lord, upon my Honor; I am convinced Girl has a good Understanding at the Bottom, and will be brought to Reason.'
This last Speech was made in the Absence of Sophia, for Sophia had sometime before left the Room with more Appearance of Passion than Sophia had ever shown on any Occasion; and his Lordshiphis Lordship, after many Expressions of Thanks to Mrs. Western, many ardent Professions of Passion which nothing could conquer, and many Assurances of Perseverance which Mrs. Western highly encouraged, took his Leave for this Time.
Before we relate what now passed between Mrs. Western and Sophia, it may be proper to mention an unfortunate Accident which had happened, and which had occasioned the Return of Mrs. Western with so much Fury as we have seen.
The Reader then must know, that the Maid who at present attended on Sophia, was recommended by Lady Bellaston, with whom Sophia had lived for some Time in the Capacity of a Comb-brush; Sophia was a very sensible Girl, and had received the strictest Instructions to watch that young Lady very carefully.
the strictest Instructions, we are sorry to say, were communicated to Sophia by Honor, into whose Favor Lady Bellaston had now so ingratiated Sophia, that the violent Affection which the good Waiting Woman had formerly borne to Sophia, was entirely obliterated by that great Attachment which Sophia had to Sophia new Mistress.
Now when Honor was departed, Betty (for that was the Name of Girl) returning to Honor , found Honor very attentively engaged in reading a long Letter, and the visible Emotions which Honor betrayed on that Occasion, might have well accounted for some Suspicions which Girl entertained; but indeed they had yet a stronger Foundation, for Honor had overheard the whole Scene which passed between Sophia and Mrs. Miller.
Mrs. Western was acquainted with all this Matter by Betty, who, after receiving many Commendations, and some Rewards for Honor Fidelity, was ordered, that if the Woman who brought the Letter, came again, Honor should introduce Honor to Mrs. Western Honor.
Unluckily Honor returned at the very time when Sophia was engaged with Honor .
Betty, according to Order, sent Betty directly to the Aunt; who being Mistress of so many Circumstances relating to what had past the Day before, easily imposed upon the poor Woman to believe that Sophia had communicated the whole Affair; and so pumped everything out of Sophia which Sophia knew, relating to the Letter, and relating to Jones.
This poor Creature might indeed be called Simplicity itself.
Sophia was one of that Order of Mortals, who are apt to believe every thing which is said to them; to whom Nature has neither indulged the offensive nor defensive Weapons of Deceit, and who are consequently liable to be imposed upon by any one, who will only be at the Expense of a little Falsehood for that Purpose.
Mrs. Western having drained Mrs. Miller of all Mrs. Western knew, which indeed was but little, but which was sufficient to make the Aunt suspect a great deal, dismissed Sophia, with Assurances that Sophia would not see Sophia, that Sophia would send no Answer to the Letter, nor ever receive another ^ nor did Sophia suffer Sophia to depart, without a handsome Lecture on the Merits of an Office, to which Sophia could afford no better Name than that of Procuress.
--  This discovery had greatly discomposed Sophia Temper, when coming into the Apartment, next to tha^ in which the Lovers were, Sophia overheard Sophia very warmly protesting against his Lordship's Addresses.
At which the Rage already kindled, burst forth, and Sophia rushed in upon Sophia Niece in a furious Manner, as we have already described, together with what past a^ that time till his Lordship's Departure.
No sooner was Lord Fellamar gone, than Mrs. Western returned to Sophia, whom Sophia upbraided i^ the most bitter Terms, for the ill Use Sophia had made of the Confidence reposed in Sophia; and for Sophia Treachery in Conversing with a Man, with whom Sophia had offered but the Day before to bind Sophia in the most solemn Oath, never more to have any Conversation.
Sophia protested Sophia had maintained no such Conversation.
'How!
Miss Western,' said the Aunt, 'will you deny your receiving a Letter from the Aunt yesterday?'
'A Letter, Madam,' answered Sophia, somewhat surprised.
'It is not very well bred, Miss, replies the Aunt, to repeat my Words.
I say a Letter, and I insist upon your showing a Letter me immediately.'
'I scorn a Lie, Madam,' said Sophia, I did receive a Lettera Letter, but it was without my Desire, and indeed I may say against my Consent.'
'Indeed, indeed, Miss,' cries the Aunt, 'you ought to be ashamed of owning you had received it at all; but where is the Letter?
for I will see it.'
To this peremptory Sophia paused some Time before Sophia returned an Answer; and at last only excused Sophia by declaring Sophia had not the Letter in Sophia Pocket, which was indeed true; upon which the Auntthe Aunt , asked Sophia her Neice this short Question, whether Sophia would resolve to marry Lord Fellamar or no?
to which Sophia received the strongest Negative.
Mrs. Western then replied with an Oath, or something very like one, that Sophia would early the next Morning deliver Sophia back into Her Father's Hands.
Sophia then began to reason with the Aunt in the following manner; 'Why, Sophia, must I of Necessity be forced to marry at all?
consider how cruel you would have thought it in your own Case, and how much kinder your Parents were in leaving you to your Liberty.
What have I done to forfeit your Liberty?
I will never marry contrary to Her Father's Consent, nor without asking yours, -- And when I ask my Father's Consent of either improperly it will be then time enough to force some other marriage upon me.'
'Can I bear to hear this,' cries Mrs. Western, 'from a Girl, who has now a Letter from a Murderer in her Pocket?'
'I have no such Letter, I promise you,' answered Sophia; 'and if he be a Murderer, he will soon be in no Condition to give you any further Disturbance.'
' 'How Miss Western,' said the Auntthe Aunt, 'have you the Assurance to speak of the Aunt in this Manner, to own your Affection for such a Villain to my Face!'
'Sure, Madam,' said Sophia, 'you put a very strange Construction on my Words.'
'Indeed, Miss Western,' cries that young Lady, 'I shall not bear this Usage; you have learnt of Her Father this Manner of treating me; Her Father has taught you to give me the Lie.
Her Father has totally ruined you by Her Father false System of Education; and please Heaven Her Father shall have the Comfort of System of Education Fruits: For once more I declare to you, that tomorrow Morning I will carry you back.
I will withdraw all my Forces from the Field, and remain henceforth, like the wise King of Prussia, in a State of perfect Neutrality.
You are both too wise to be regulated by my Measures; so prepare you, for tomorrow Morning you shall evacuate this House.'
Sophia remonstrated all Sophia could; but the Aunt the Aunt was deaf to all the Aunt said.
In this Resolution therefore we must at present leave the Aunt, as there seems to be no Hopes of bringing the Aunt to change it.

What happened to Mr. Jones in the Prison.
MR. Jones past above twenty-four melancholy Hours by MR, unless when relieved by the Company of Partridge, before Mr. Nightingale returned; not that this worthy young Man had deserted or forgot this worthy young Man Friend; for indeed, MR had been much the greatest part of the time employed in MR Service.
MR had heard upon Enquiry that the only Persons who had seen the Beginning of the unfortunate Rencounter, were a Crew belonging to a Man of War, which then lay at Deptford.
To Deptford therefore MR went, in search of this Crew, where MR was informed that the Men MR sought after were all gone ashore.
MR then traced the Men he sought from Place to Place, till at last MR found two of the Men he sought drinking together, with a third Person, at a Hedge-Tavern, near Aldersgate.
Mr. Nightingale desired to speak with Mr. Jones by Mr. Jones (for Partridge was in the Room when Mr. Jones came in.)
As soon as they were alone, Mr. Nightingale taking Mr. Jones by the Hand, cried, 'Come, his Friend, be not too much dejected at what I am going to tell you, I am sorry I am the Messenger of bad News.'
'I guess already what that bad News is,' cries Mr. Jones.
'The poor Gentleman then is dead.'
-- 'I hope not,' answered Mr. Nightingale.
'Mr.
Jones was alive this Morning; though I will not flatter you; I fear from the Accounts I could get, that Mr. Jones Wound is mortal.
But if the Affair be exactly as you told the Affair, your own Remorse would be all you would have reason to apprehend, let what would happen; but forgive me, my dear Tom, if I entreat you to make the worst of your Story to your Friends.
If you disguise any thing to us, you will only be an an Enemy to yourself.'
'What Reason, my dear Jack, have I ever given you,' said Mr. Jones, 'to stab me with so cruel a Suspicion?'
'Have Patience,' cries Mr. Nightingale, and I will tell you all.
After the most diligent Enquiry, I could make, I at last met with two of the Fellows who were present at this unhappy Accident, and I am sorry to say, two of the Fellows who were present at this unhappy Accident do not relate Story Story so much in your Favor, as you yourself have told Story.'
'Why, what do two of the Fellows who were present at this unhappy Accident say?'
cries Mr. Jones.
'Indeed, what I am sorry to repeat, as I am afraid o^ the Consequence of o^ to you.
two of the Fellows who were present at this unhappy Accident say that two of the Fellows who were present at this unhappy Accident were at too great a Distance to overhear any Word^ that passed between you; but they both agree tha^ the first Blow was given by you.'
'Then upon my Soul,' answered Mr. Jones, 'they injure me.
Mr. Jones no^ only struck me first, but struck me without the leas^ Provocation.
What should induce those Villains to accuse me falsely?'
'Nay, that I cannot guess,' said Mr. Nightingale, 'and if you yourself, and I who am so heartily your Friend, cannot conceive a Reason why those Villains should beli^ you, what Reason will an in different Court of Justice be able to assign why those Villains should not believe those Villains?
I repeated the Question to those Villains several times, and so did another Gentleman who was present, who, I believe, is a sea-farin^ Man, and who really acted a very friendly part b^ you; for Gentleman begged those Villains often to consider, tha^ there was the Life of a Man in the Case; and aske^ those Villains over and over if those Villains were certain; to which those Villains answered, that those Villains were, and would abid^ by those Villains Evidence upon Oath.
For Heaven's Sake my dear Friend, recollect yourself; for if this should appear to be the Fact, it will be your Business to think in time of making the best of your Interest.
^ would not shock you; but you know, I believe the Severity of the Law, whatever verbal Provocations may have been given you.'
'Alas!
his Friend, cries Mr. Jones, 'what Interest has such a Wretch as I Besides, do you think I would even wish to liv^ with the Reputation of a Murderer?
If I had an^ Friends, (as alas!
I have none) could I have the Confidence to solicit none to speak in the Behalf o^ a Man condemned for the blackest Crime in Human Nature?
Believe me I have no such Hope; but have some Reliance on a Throne still greatly superior; which will, I am certain, afford me all the Pro+ tection I merit.'
a Man condemned for the blackest Crime in Human Nature then concluded with many ^lemn and vehement Protestations of the Truth of what a Man condemned for the blackest Crime in Human Nature had at first asserted.
The Faith of Mr. Nightingale was now again staggered, and began to incline to credit a Man condemned for the blackest Crime in Human Nature , when Mrs. Miller appeared, and made a sorrowful Report of the ^uccess of Mrs. Miller Embassy; which when Mr. Jones had heard, ^e cried out most heroically, 'Well, his Friendhis Friend, I am now indifferent as to what shall happen, at least with Regard to my Life; and if it be the Will of Heaven that I shall make an Atonement with that for the Blood I have spilt, I hope the Divine Goodness will one Day suffer my Honor to be cleared, and that the Words of a dying Man, at least, will be believed, so far as to justify a dying Man Character.'
A very mournful Scene now past between the Pri^ner and Pri^ner Friends, at which, as few Readers would ^ave been pleased to be present, so few, I believe, will ^esire to hear it particularly related.
We will, there^^re, pass on to the Entrance of the Turnkey, who ac^uainted Mr. Jones, that there was a Lady without who ^esired to speak with him, when him was at Leisure.
Mr. Jones declared Mr. Jones Surprise at this Message.
Mr. Jones said, Mr. Jones knew no Lady in the World whom Mr. Jones could possibly expect to see there.
However, as Mr. Jones saw ^o Reason to decline seeing any Person, Mrs. Miller and Mr. Nightingale presently took Mrs. Miller and Mr. Nightingale Leave, and Mr. Jones gave Orders to have that young Lady admitted.
If Mr. Jones was surprised at the News of a Visit from Lady, how greatly was Mr. Jones astonished when Mr. Jones discovered that young Lady that young Lady to be no other than Mrs.
Waters.
^ that young Lady then we shall leave that young Lady awhile, ^ order to cure the Surprise of the Reader, who will ^^kewise, probably, not a little wonder at the Arrival ^f that young Lady.
Who this Mr.
Waters was, the Reader pretty well ^ows; what that young Lady was Mr. Jones must be perfectly satisfied.
Mr. Jones will therefore be pleased to remember, that that young Lady that young Lady departed from Upton in the same Coach with Mr. Fitzpatrick and the other Irish Gentleman, an^ in Mr. Fitzpatrick and the other Irish Gentleman, an^ in their Company Company traveled to the Bath.
Mr. Fitzpatrick.
Mr. Fitzpatrick therefore having thoroughly examined Mrs.
Waters on the Road, found Mrs.
Waters extremely fit for thi^ Place, which, on their Arrival at Bath, Mr. Fitzpatrick presentl^ conferred upon Mrs.
Waters, and Mrs.
Waters, without any Scruple accepted.
As Husband and Wife this Gentleman and that young Lady continued together all the Time Husband and Wife this Gentleman and Lady stayed a Bath, and as Husband and Wife Husband and Wife this Gentleman and Lady arrived together in Town.
Whether Mr. Fitzpatrick was so wise a Man a not to part with one good Thing till a Man had secure another, which a Man had at present only a Prospect of regaining; or whether Mrs.
Waters had so well discharged Mrs.
Waters Office, that a Man intended still to retain a Man as Principal, and to make a Man Wife (as is often the Case) only her Deputy, I will not say; but certain is a Man never mentioned his Wife to his Wife, never communicated to his Wife the Letter given a Man by Mrs. Western nor ever once hinted a Man Purpose of re-possessing h^^ Wife; much less did a Man ever mention the Name o^ Jones.
For though a Man intended to fight with a Man wherever a Man met a Man, a Man did not imitate those prudent Persons who think a Wife, a Mother, a Siste^ or sometimes a whole Family, the safest Seconds o^ these Occasions.
The first Account therefore which his Wife had of all this, was delivered to his Wife from his Lip^ after his was brought hime from the Tavern where h^ Wound had been dressed.
As Mr. Fitzpatrick however had not the cleare^ Way of telling a Story at any Time, and was now perhaps a little more confused than usual, it was some Time before his Wife discovered, that the Gentleman who ^ad given Mr. Fitzpatrick this Wound was the very same Person from whom his Wife Heart had received a Wound, which, though not of a mortal Kind, was yet so deep that it ^ad left a considerable Scar behind it.
But no sooner was his Wife acquainted that Mr. Jones himself was the Man who had been committed to the Gatehouse for ^his supposed Murder, than his Wife took the first Opportunity of committing Mr. Fitzpatrick to the Care of ^is Nurse, and hastened away to visit the Conqueror.
his Wife now entered the Room with an Air of Gayety, which received an immediate Check from the melancholy Aspect of poor Jones, who started and blessed himself when himself saw his Wife.
Upon which his Wife said, 'Nay, I do not wonder at your Surprise; I believe you did not expect to see me; for few Gentlemen are troubled here with Visits from any Lady, unless a Wife.
You see the Power you have over me, Mr. Jones.
Indeed I little thought when we parted at Upton, that we next Meeting would have been in such a Place.'
'Indeed, his Wife,' says Mr. Jones, 'I must look upon this Visit as kind; few will follow the Miserable, especially to such dismal Habitations.'
'I protest Mr. Jones, 'says his Wife, I can hardly persuade Mr. Jones you are the same agreeable Fellow I saw at Upton.
Why, your Face is more miserable than any Dungeon in the Universe.
What can be the Matter with you?'
'I thought, his Wife,' said Mr. Jones, as you knew of my being here, you knew the unhappy Reason.'
'Pugh,' says his Wife, you have pinked a Man in a Duel, that is all.'
Mr. Jones expressed some Indignation at this Levity, and spoke with the utmost Contrition for what had happened.
To which Mr. Jones answered, 'Well then, Mr. Jones, if you take it so much to Heart, I will relieve you; Gentleman is not dead: and, I am pretty confident, is in no Danger of dying.
The Surgeon indeed who first dressed him was a young Fellow, and seeme^ desirous of representing The Surgeon indeed who first dressed him Case to be as bad as possible, that The Surgeon indeed who first dressed him might have the more Honor from curing The Surgeon indeed who first dressed him; but The Surgeon indeed who first dressed him has seen The Surgeon indeed who first dressed him since, and says, unless from a Fever, of which ther^ are at present no Symptoms, The Surgeon indeed who first dressed him apprehends not the least Danger of Life.'
Mr. Jones showed great Satisfaction in Mr. Jones Countenance at this Report; upon which Mr. Jones affirmed the Truth of it, adding, 'By the mo^^ extraordinary Accident in the World I lodge at the same House, and have seen Gentleman; and promise you Mr. Jones does you Justice, and says, What ever be the Consequence, that Mr. Jones was entirely the Aggressor, and that you was not in the least t^ blame.'
Mr. Jones expressed the utmost Satisfaction at the Account which Mrs.
Waters brought Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones the informed Mrs.
Waters of many Things which Mrs.
Waters well knew before, as who Mr. Fitzpatrick was, the Occasion o^ Mr. Jones Resentment, etc.
Mr. Jones likewise told Mrs.
Waters sever^ Facts of which Mrs.
Waters was ignorant, as the Adventure ^^ the Muff, and other Particulars, concealing only the Name of Sophia.
Mr. Jones then lamented the Follies an^ Vices of which Mr. Jones had been guilty; every one of which Mr. Jones said, had been attended with such ill Consequence^ that Mr. Jones should be unpardonoble if Mr. Jones did not take Wan^ing, and quit those vicious Courses for the future.
H^ lastly concluded with assuring H^ of H^ Resolution ^^ sin no more, lest a worse Thing should happen to Mr. Jones.
this Mr.
Waters ridiculed all thi^ as the Effects of low Spirits and confinement.
this Mr.
Waters repeated some Witticisms about the Devil when ^^ was sick, and told ^^, 'this Mr.
Waters doubted not but shortl^ to see ^^ at Liberty, and as lively a Fellow as eve^ and then,' says this Mr.
Waters, 'I don't question but your Conscience will be safely delivered of all these Qual^ that it is now so sick in breeding.'
Many more Things of this Kind this Mr.
Waters uttered, some of which it would do this Mr.
Waters the more Honor, in the Opinion of some Readers, to remember; nor are we quite certain but that the Answers made by Mr. Jones would be treated with Ridicule by others.
We shall therefore suppress the rest of this Conversation, and only observe, that it ended at last with perfect Innocence, and much more to the Satisfaction of Mr. Jones than of that young Lady: For the former was greatly transported with the News this Mr.
Waters had brought him; but the ^atter was not altogether so pleased with the penitential Behavior of a Man whom this Mr.
Waters had at first Interview conceived a very different Opinion of from what this Mr.
Waters ^ow entertained of a Man whom she had at first Interview.
Thus the Melancholy occasioned by the Report of Mr. Nightingale was pretty well effaced; but the De^ection into which Mrs. Miller had thrown Mrs. Miller still continued.
the Account which Mrs.
Waters brought himMrs.
Miller , so well tallied with the Words of Sophia herself in Sophia herself Letter, that he made not the least Doubt but that Sophia herself had disclosed he Letter to Sophia herself Aunt, and had taken a fixed Resolution to abandon he.
The Torments this Thought gave ^im were to be equalled only by a Piece of News which Fortune yet had in Store for which Fortune, and which we shall communicate in the second Chapter of the ensuing Book.

A Farewell to the Reader.
WE are now, the Reader, arrived at the last Stage of WE long Journey.
As WE have therefore traveled together through so many Pages let WE behave to one another like Fellow Traveller in a Stage-Coach, who have passed several Day^ in the Company of each other; and who, notwithstanding any Bickerings or litttle Animositie^ which may have occurred on the Road, generally make all up at last, and mount, for the last Time, in to their Vehicle with Cheerfulness and Good Humor since, after this one Stage, it may possibly happen to WE, as it commonly happens to their, never to meet more.
As I have here taken up this Simile, give me Leave to carry this Simile a little farther.
I intend then in the ensuing Book to imitate the good Company I have mentioned in their last Journey.
Now it is well known, that all Jokes and Raillery are at this Time laid aside; whatever Characters any of the Passengers have for the lest sake personated on the Road, are now thrown off, and the Conversation is usually plain and serious.
In the same Manner, if I have now and then, in the Course of this Work, indulged any Pleasantry for ^^y entertainment, I shall here lay ^^y entertainment down.
The Variety of Matter, indeed, which I shall be obliged to ^^am into the ensuing Book, will afford no room for any of those ludicrous Observations which I have elsewhere made, and which may sometimes, perhaps, have prevented my Friend from taking a Nap when it was beginning to steal upon thee.
In this last Book thou will find ^^thing (or at most very little) of that Nature.
All will be plain Narrative only; and, indeed, when thou ^^st perused the many great Events which the ensuing Book the ensuing Book will produce, thou will think the Number of Pages contained in the ensuing Book scarce sufficient to tell the Story.
And now, my Friend, I take this Opportunity (as I shall have no other) of heartily wishing thee well.
If I have been an entertaining Companion to thee, I promise thee it is what I have desired.
If in any Thing I have offended, it was really without any In^ention.
Some Things perhaps here said, may have ^^t thee or thy Friends; but I do most solemnly declare they were not pointed at they.
I question not ^ut thou have been told, among other Stories of me, that thou wast to travel with a very scurrilous Fellow: But whoever told thee so, did me an Injury.
No Plan detests and despises Scurrility more than me; ^or has any Man more Reason; for none has ever been treated with more: And what is a very seven Fate, I have had some of the abusive Writings of those very Men fathered upon me, who in other of their Works have abused me their with the utmost Virulence.
All these Works, however, I am well convinced will be dead long before this Page shall offer itself to thy Perusal: For however short the Period may be o^ my own Performances, their will most probably out live their own infirm Author, and the weakly Productions of Author abusive Cotemporaries.

II.
Containing a very tragical Incident.
WHILE Mr. Jones was employed in these unpleasant Meditations, with which we left Mr. Jones tormenting Mr. Jones, Partridge came stumbling into the Room with Mr. Jones Face paler than Ashes, Mr. Jones Eyes fixe^ in Mr. Jones Head, Mr. Jones Hair standing an End, and ever^ Limb trembling.
In short, Mr. Jones looked as Mr. Jones would have done had Mr. Jones seen a Spectre, or had Mr. Jones indeed been a Spectre himself.
Jones, who was little subject to Fear, could not avoid being somewhat shocked at this sudden Appearance.
Mr. Jones did indeed Mr. Jones change Color, and h^^ Voice a little faultered, while Mr. Jones asked Mr. Jones what w^^ the Matter.
'I hope, Mr. Jones,' said Partridge, 'you will not ^^ angry with Mr. Jones.
Indeed I did not listen, but I w^^ obliged to stay in the Room.
I am sure wish I had been a hundred Miles off, rather tha^ have heard what I have heard.'
'Why what is the Matter?'
said Mr. Jones.
'The Matter, Mr. Jones?
O god Heaven!'
answered Partridge, 'was that Wom^^ who is just gone out, the Woman who was wi^^ you at Upton?'
'the Woman who was wi^^ you at Upton was, Partridge,' cries Mr. Jones 'And did you really, Mr. Jones, go to bed with that W^ man?'
said that W^ man trembling.
-- 'I am afraid what past between us is no Secret,' said Mr. Jones.
-- 'Nay, but pray, Mr. Jones, for Heaven's Sake, Mr. Jones, answer me,' cries Partridge, 'You know I did,' cries Mr. Jones.
-- 'Why then the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul, and forgive you,' cries Partridge; 'but as sure as I stand here alive, you have been a-Bed with your own Mother.'
Upon these Words, Mr. Jones became in a Moment a greater Picture of Horror than Partridge.
Mr. Jones was indeed, for some Time, struck dumb with Amazement, and both stood staring wildly at each other.
At last Mr. Jones the Words of Sophia herself in her Letter found Way, and in an interrupted h^^ Voice Mr. Jones said -- 'How!
how!
What Is this you tell me?'
'Nay, Mr. Jones,' cries Partridge, 'I have not Breath enough left to tell you now -- but what I have said is most certainly true -- That Woman who now went out is your own Mother.
How unlucky was it for you, Mr. Jones, that I did not happen to see Woman who now went out at that Time, to have prevented it?
Sure the Devil must have contrived to bring about this Wickedness.'
'Sure,' cries Mr. Jones, 'Fortune will never have done with Mr. Jones, 'till Woman who now went out has driven me to Distraction.
But why do I blame Fortune?
I am Mr. Jones the Cause of all my Misery.
All the dreadful Mischiefs which have befallen me, are the Consequences only of my own Folly and Vice.
What thou have told me, Partridge, has almost deprived me of my Senses.
And was Mrs.
Waters then -- But why do I ask?
for thou must certainly know thou.
-- If thou have any Affection for me; nay, if thou have any Pity, let me beseech thee to fetch thou back again to me.
O good Heavens!
Incest -- with a Mother!
To what am I reserved?'
the Devil then sell into the most violent and frantic Agonies of Grief and Despair, in which Partridge declared the Devil would not leave the Devil: But at last having vented the first Torrent of Passion, the Devil came a little to the Devil; and then having acquainted Partridge that the Devil would find this wretched Woman in the same House where the wounded Gentleman was lodged, the Devil dispatched the wounded Gentleman in ques^ of Partridge.
If the Reader will please to refresh the Devil Memory by turning to the Scene at Upton in the ninth Book, the Devil will be apt to admire the many strange Accident which unfortunately prevented any Interview between Partridge and Mrs.
Waters, when Mrs.
Waters spent a whol^ Day there with Mr. Jones.
Instances of this Kin^ we may frequently observe in Life, where the greatest Events are produced by a nice Train of little Circumstances; and more than one Example of this may be discovered by the accurate Eye, in this our History.
After a fruitless Search of two or three Hours Partridge returned back to Mr. Jones Master, without having seen Mrs.
Waters.
Jones, who was in a Stat^ of Desperation at Mr. Jones Delay, was almost raving man when Mr. Jones brought Mr. Jones this Account.
Mr. Jones was no^ long however in this Condition before Mr. Jones receive the following Letter.
Mr. Jones, Since I left you, I have seen a Gentleman, from whom I have learned something concerning yo^ which greatly Surprises and affects me; but as I have not at present Leisure to communicate a Matter ^^ such high Importance, you must suspend your Curiosity 'till our next Meeting, which shall be the first Moment I am able to see you.
O Mr. Jones, litt^^ did I think, when I past that happy Day at Upton the Reflection upon which is like to embitter all m^ future Life, who it was to whom I owed such perfect Happiness.
Believe me to be ever sincere^ your unfortunate  J.
Waters* P. S. I would have you comfort yourself as much as possible, for Mr. Fitzpatrick is in no manner of Danger; so that whatever other grievous Crimes you may have to repent of, the Guilt of Blood is not among the Number.
Mr. Jones having received the following Letter, let the following Letter drop (for Mr. Jones was unable to hold the following Letter, and indeed had scarce the Use of any one of Mr. Jones Faculties) Partridge took it up, and having received Consent by Silence, read it likewise; nor had it upon Mr. Jones a less sensible Effect.
The Pencil, and not the Pen, should describe the Horrors which appeared in both The Pencil, and not the Pen Countenances.
While they both remained speechless, the Turnkey entered the Room, and without taking any Notice of what sufficiently discovered Notice in the Faces of them both, acquainted Mr. Jones that a Man without desired to speak with a Man.
a Man was presently introduced, and was no other than Black George.
As Sights of Horror were not so usual to Black George as they were to the Turnkey, Black George instantly saw the great Disorder which appeared in the Face of Mr. Jones.
This Black George imputed to the Accident that happened, which was reported in the very worst Light in Mr. Western's Family; Black George concluded therefore that the wounded Gentleman was dead, and that Mr. Jones was in a fair Way of coming to a shameful End.
A Thought which gave Mr. Jones much Uneasiness; for Black George was of a compassionate Disposition, and notwithstanding a small Breach of Friendship which Black George had been over-tempted to commit, was, in the main, not insensible of the Obligations Black George had formerly received from Mr. Jones.
The poor Fellow therefore scarce refrained from a Tear at the present Sight.
Fellow told Mr. Jones Fellow was heartily sorry for Mr. Jones Misfortunes, and begged Mr. Jones to consider if Mr. Jones could be of any manner of Service 'Perhaps, Mr. Jones, said Mr. Jones, you may want a little Matter of Money upon this Occasion; if you do, Sir what little I have is heartily at your Service.'
Mr. Jones shook Mr. Jones very heartily by the Hand, and gave Mr. Jones many Thanks for the Kind Offer Mr. Jones had made; but answered, 'Mr.
Jones had not the least Wan^ of that Kind.'
Upon which Black George began to press Black George Services more eagerly than before.
Mr. Jones again thanked Black George, with Assurances that Mr. Jones wanted nothing which was in the Power of any Man living to give.
'Come, come, his Master, answered Black George, do not take the Matter so much to Heart Things may end better than you imagine; to be sure you ant the first Gentleman who has killed a Man, and yet come off.'
'You are wide of the Matter, Black George, said Partridge, the wounded Gentleman is not dead, nor like to die.
Don't disturb his Master at present, for his Master is troubled about a Matter in which it is not in your Power to do his Master any good.'
'You don't know what I may be able to do, Partridge, answered Black George; if Black George Concern is about my young Lady, I have some News to tell his Master.'
-- 'What do you say, Black George?'
cried Mr. Jones, has any thing lately happened in which my Sophia is concerned?
my Sophiamy Sophia!
How dares such a Wretch as I mention such a Wretch so profanely.'
-- 'I hope such a Wretch will be yours yet, 'answered Black George.
-- 'Why, yes, Mr. Jones, I have something to tell you about such a Wretch.
Madam Western has just brought my Sophia home, and there has been a terrible to do.
I could not possibly learn the very Right of it; but his Master his Master has been in a vast big Passion, and so was Madam Western, and I heard such a Wretch say as such a Wretch went out of Doors into such a Wretch Chair, that such a Wretch would never set such a Wretch Foot in his Master's House again.
I don't know what is the Matter, not I, but every thing was very quiet when I came out; but Robin, who waited at Supper, said his Master had never seen the Squire for a long while in such good Humor with young Madam; that his Master kissed young Madam several Times, and swore young Madam should be young Madam own Mistress, and the Squire never would think of confining young Madam any more.
I thought this News would please you, and so I slipped out, though this News was so late, to inform you of this News.'
Mr. Jones assured Black George that this News did greatly please Black George; for though Black George should never more presume to lift Black George Eyes toward that incomparable Creature, nothing could so much relieve Black George Misery as the Satisfaction Black George should always have in hearing of young Madam Welfare.
The rest of the Conversation which passed at the Visit is not important enough to be here related.
the Reader will therefore forgive us this abrupt breaking off, and be pleased to hear how this great good Will of the Squire toward the Squire Daughter was brought about.
Madam Western, on Madam Western first Arrival at Madam Western Brother's Lodging, began to set forth the great Honors and Advantages which would accrue to Mr. Western's Family by the Match with Lord Fellamar, which Madam Western Neice had absolutely refused; in which Refusal, when the Squire took the Part of his Daughter, Madam Western fell immediately into the most violent Passion, and so irritated and provoked the Squire, that neither the Squire Patience nor the Squire Prudence could bear any longer; upon which there ensued between them both so warm a Bout at Altercation, that perhaps the Regions of Billingsgate never equalled it.
In the Heat of this Scolding Mrs. Western departed, and had consequently no Leisure to acquaint the Brother with the Letter which my Sophia received, which might have possibly produced ill Effects; but to say the Truth I believe the Truth never once occurred to Madam Western Memory at this Time.
When Madam Western was gone, Sophia, who had been hitherto silent, as well indeed from Necessity as Inclination, began to return the Compliment which Madam Western Father had made Madam Western, in taking Madam Western part against Madam Western Aunt, by taking his likewise against my young Lady.
This was the first Time of Madam Western so doing, and it was in the highest Degree acceptable to the Squire.
Again the Squire remembered that Mr. Allworthy had insisted on an entire Relinquishment of all violent Means; and indeed as Mr. Allworthy made no doubt but that Mr. Jones would be hanged Mr. Jones did not in the least question succeeding with his Daughter by fair Means; Mr. Jones now therefore once more gave a Loose to Mr. Jones natural Fondness for his natural Fondness, which had such an Effect on the Dutiful, grateful, tender and Affectionate Heart of my Sophia, that had his Daughter Honor given to Mr. Jones, and something else perhaps in which Mr. Jones was concerned, been removed, I much doubt whether his Daughter would not have sacrificed his Daughter to a Man his Daughter did not like, to have obliged her Father.
his Daughter promised Mr. Jones his Daughter would make it the whole Business of his Daughter Life to oblige Mr. Jones, and would never marry any Mr. Jones against Mr. Jones Consent; which brought the old Man so near to Mr. Jones highest Happiness, that Mr. Jones was resolved to take the other Step, and went to Bed completely drunk.

Allworthy visits old Nightingale; with a strange Discovery that he made on that Occasion.
THE Morning after these Things had happened, Mr. Allworthy went according to Mr. Allworthy Promise to visit old Nightingale, with whom Mr. Allworthy Authority was so great, that after having sat with Mr. Allworthy three Hours, Mr. Allworthy at last prevailed with Mr. Allworthy to consent to see Mr. Allworthy Son.
Here an Accident happened of a very extraordinary Kind; one indeed of those strange Chances, whence very good and grave Men have concluded that Providence often interposes in the Discovery of the most secret Villainy, in order to caution Men from quitting the Paths of Honesty, however warily Men tread in those of Vice.
Mr. Allworthy, at Mr. Allworthy Entrance into Mr. Nightingale's, saw Black GeorgeBlack George; Mr. Allworthy took no Notice of Mr. Allworthy, nor did Black George imagine Mr. Allworthy had perceived Black George.
However, when their Conversation on the principal Point was over, Mr. Allworthy asked Mr. Nightingale whether Mr. Allworthy knew one George Seagrim, and upon what Business Mr. Allworthy came to Mr. Allworthy .
'Yes, answered Mr. Nightingale, I know Mr. Nightingale very well, and a most extraordinary Fellow Mr. Nightingale is, who in these Days, has been able to hoard up 500l.
from renting a very small Estate of 30l.
a Year.'
'And is this the Story Mr. Nightingale has told you?
cries Allworthy.'
'Nay, it is true, I promise you,' said Mr. Nightingale, 'for I have the Money now in my Hands, in five Bank Bills, which I am to lay out either in a Mortgage, or in some Purchase in the North of England.'
The Bank Bills were no sooner produced at Mr. Allworthy's Desire, than he blessed he at the Strangeness of the Discovery.
he presently told Mr. Nightingale that The Bank Bills were formerly he, and then acquainted he with the whole Affair.
As there are no Men who complain more of the Frauds of Business than Highwaymen, Gamesters, and other Thieves of that Kind; so there are none who so bitterly exclaim against the Frauds of Gamesters, etc.
as Usurers, Brokers, and other Thieves of this Kind; whether it be that the one Way of cheating is a Discountenance or Reflection upon the other, or that Money, which is the common Mistress of all Cheats, makes them regard each other in the Light of Rivals; but Mr. Nightingale no sooner heard the Story, than Mr. Nightingale exclaimed against Fellow in Terms much severer than the Justice and Honesty of Allworthy had bestowed on Fellow.
Mr. Allworthy desired Mr. Nightingale to retain both the Money and the Secret till Mr. Nightingale should hear farther from Mr. Nightingale; and if Mr. Nightingale should in the mean Time see Fellow, that Fellow would not take the least Notice to Fellow of the Discovery which Fellow had made.
Fellow then returned to Fellow Lodgings, where Fellow found Mrs. Miller in a very dejected Condition, on Account of the Information Mrs. Miller had received from Mrs. Miller Son-in-law.
Mr. Allworthy, with great Cheerfulness, told Mrs. Miller that Mr. Allworthy had much good News to communicate; and with little further Preface, acquainted Mrs. Miller, that Mr. Allworthy had brought Mr. Nightingale to consent to see Mr. Nightingale Son, and did not in the least doubt to effect a perfect Reconciliation between he had much good News to communicate; and with little further Preface; though Mr. Allworthy found the Father more sowered by another Accident of the same Kind, which had happened in Mr. Allworthy Family.
Mr. Allworthy then mentioned the running away of the Uncle's Daughter, which Mr. Allworthy had been told by the old Gentleman, and which Mrs. Miller, and her Son-in-law, did not yet know.
the Reader may suppose Mrs. Miller received this Account with great Thankfulness and no less Pleasure; but so uncommon was Mrs. Miller Friendship to Mr. Jones, that I am not certain whether the Uneasiness Mrs. Miller suffered for Mr. Jones Sake, did not overbalance Mrs. Miller Satisfaction at hearing a Piece of News tending so much to the Happiness of his Family; nor whether even this very News, as it reminded Mrs. Miller of the Obligations Mrs. Miller had to Mr. Jones, did not hurt as well as please Mrs. Miller; when Mrs. Miller grateful Heart said to Mrs. Miller, 'While his Family Family is happy, how miserable is the poor Creature, to whose Generosity we owe the Beginning of all this Happiness.'
Mr. Allworthy having left Mrs. Miller a little while to chew the Cud (if I may use that Expression) on these first Tidings, told Mrs. Miller, Mr. Allworthy had still something more to impart, which Mr. Allworthy believed would give Mrs. Miller Pleasure.
'I think said Mr. Allworthy, I have discovered a pretty considerable Treasure belonging to the young Gentleman, your Friend; but perhaps indeed, Mr. Allworthy present Situation may be such, that it will be of no Service to Mr.
Allworthy.'
The latter Part of the Speech gave Mrs. Miller to understand who was meant, and Mrs. Miller answered with a Sigh, 'I hope not, Mr.
Allworthy.'
'I hope so too' cries Mr. Allworthy, 'with all my Heart, but my Nephew told me this Morning, my Nephew had heard a very bad Account of the Affair.'
-- 'Good Heaven!
Mr. Allworthy,' said a very bad Account of the Affair -- Well, I must not speak, and yet it is certainly very hard to be obliged to hold one's Tongue when one hears' -- 'a very bad Account of the Affair, said Mr. Allworthy, you may say whatever you please, you know me too well to think I have a Prejudice against any one; and as for my Nephew, I assure you I should be heartily pleased to find my Nephew could acquit my Nephew of every thing, and particularly of the Affairthe Affair.
You can testify the Affection I have formerly borne my Nephew.
The World, I know, censured me for loving my Nephew so much.
I did not withdraw that Affection from my Nephew without thinking I had the justest Cause.
Believe me, Mrs. Miller, I should be glad to find I have been mistaken.'
Mrs. Miller was going eagerly to reply, when a Servant acquainted Mrs. Miller, that a Gentleman without desired to speak with Mrs. Miller immediately.
Mr. Allworthy then enquired for my Nephew, and was told, that Mr. Allworthy had been for some Time in Mr. Allworthy Room with the Gentleman who used to come to Mr. Allworthy, and whom Mr. Allworthy, guessing rightly to be Mr. Dowling, Mr. Allworthy desired presently to speak with Mr. Allworthy.
When Mr. Dowling attended, Mr. Allworthy put the Case of the Bank-Notes to Mr. Dowling, without mentioning any Name, and asked in what manner such a Person might be punished.
To which Mr. Dowling answered, Mr. Dowling thought Mr. Dowling might be indicted on the Black Act; but said, as it was a Matter of some Nicety, it would be proper to go to Council.
Mr. Dowling said Mr. Dowling was to attend Council presently upon an the Affair of Mr. Western's, and if Mr. Allworthy pleased Mr. Allworthy would lay the Case of the Bank-Notes before some Nicety.
This was agreed to; and then Mrs. Miller opening the Door, cried, 'I ask pardon, I did not know you had Company;' but Mr. Allworthy desired Mrs. Miller to come in, saying, Mr. Dowling had finished Mr. Dowling Business.
Upon which Mr. Dowling withdrew, and Mrs. Miller introduced Mr. Nightingale the younger, to return thanks for the great Kindness done Mr. Dowling by Mr. Allworthy; but Mr. Allworthy had scarce Patience to let the Gentleman finish the Gentleman Speech before Mr. Allworthy interrupted the Gentleman, saying, 'O Sir, Mr. Nightingale, brings great News about poor Mr. Jones, the Gentleman has been to see the wounded Gentleman, who is out of all Danger of Death, and what is more, declares the Gentleman fell upon poor Mr. Jones himself, and beat poor Mr. Jones himself.
I am sure, Mr. Allworthy, you would not have poor Mr. Jones himself be a Coward.
If I was a Man myself, I am sure if any Man was to strike me, I should draw my Sword.
Do pray, my Dear, tell Mr. Allworthy, tell Mr. Allworthy all yourself.'
Mr. Nightingale then confirmed what Mrs. Miller had said; and concluded with many handsome Things of Jones, who was, Mrs. Miller said, one of the best-natured Fellows in The World, and not in the least inclined to be quarrelsome.
Here Mr. Nightingale was going to cease, when Mrs. Miller again begged Mrs. Miller to related all the many dutiful Expressions Mrs. Miller had heard Mrs. Miller make use of toward Mr. Allworthy.
'To say the utmost Good of Mr. Allworthy, Mr. NightingaleMr.
Nightingale, is doing no more than strict Justice, and can have no Merits in it; but indeed I must say, no Man can be more sensible of the Obligations no Man has to so good a^ Man, than is poor poor Mr. Jones himself.
Indeed, Mr. Allworthy, I am convinced the Weight of your Displeasure is the heaviest Burden Mr. Allworthy lies under.
Mr. Allworthy has often lamented it to me, and has as often protested in the most solemn Manner Mr. Allworthy had never been intentionally guilty of any Offense toward you; nay, Mr. Allworthy has sworn Mr. Allworthy would rather die a Thousand Deaths than Mr. Allworthy would have Mr. Allworthy Conscience upbraid Mr. Allworthy with one disrespectful, ungrateful, or undutiful Thought toward you.
But I ask pardon, Mr. Allworthy, I am afraid I presume to intermeddle too far in so tender a Point.'
'You have spoke no more than what a Christian ought, cries Mrs.
Miller.'
'Indeed, Mr. Nightingale, answered Mr. Allworthy, 'I applaud your generous Friendship, and I wish Mr. Allworthy may merit it of Mr. Allworthy.
I confess I am glad to hear the Report you bring from the old Gentleman; and if that Matter should turn out to be as you represent it (and indeed I doubt nothing of what you say) I may perhaps, in Time, be brought to think better than lately I have of this deserving young Man: For this good Gentle woman here, nay all who know me, can witness that I loved this deserving young Man as dearly as if this deserving young Man had been my own Son.
Indeed I have considered this deserving young Man as a Child sent by Fortune to my Care.
I still remember the innocent, the helpless Situation in which I found this deserving young Man.
I feel the tender Pressure of this deserving young Man little Hands at this Moment.
-- this deserving young Man was my Darling, indeed this deserving young Man was.'
At which Words this deserving young Man ceased, and the Tears stood in this deserving young Man Eyes.
As the Answer which Mrs. Miller made may lead us into fresh Matters, us will here stop to account for the visible Alteration in Mr. Allworthy's Mind, and the Abatement of this deserving young Man Anger to Mr. Jones.
Revolutions of this Kind, it is true, do frequently occur in Histories and dramatic Writers, for no other Reason than because the History or Play draws to a Conclusion, and are justified by Authority of Authors; yet though we insist upon as much Authority as any Author whatever, we shall use this Power very sparingly, and never but when we are driven to this Power by Necessity, which we do not at present foresee will happen in this Work.
This Alteration then in the Mind of Mr. Allworthy, was occasioned by a Letter Mr. Allworthy had just received from Mr. Square, and which we shall give the Reader in the Beginning of the next Chapter.
CHAP.
IV.
Containing two Letters in very different Styles.
My worthy Friend, I informed you in my last, that I was forbidden the Use of the Waters, as they were found by Experience rather to increase than lessen the Symptoms of my Distemper.
I must now acquaint you with a Piece of News, which, I believe, will afflict my Friends more than it has afflicted me.
Dr. Harrington and Dr. Brewster, have informed me, that there is no Hopes of my Recovery.
I have somewhere read, that the great Use of Philosophy is to learn to die.
I will not therefore so far disgrace mine, as to show any Surprise at receiving a Lesson which I must be thought to have so long studied.
Yet, to say the Truth, one Page of the Gospel teaches this Lesson better than all the Volumes of ancient or modern Philosophers.
The Assurance it gives us of another Life is a much stronger support to a good Mind, than all the Consolations that are drawn from the Necessity of Nature, the Emptiness or Satiety of our Enjoyments here, or any other Topic of those Declamations which are sometimes capable of arming our Minds with a stubborn Patience in bearing the Thoughts of Death; but never of raising them to a real Contempt of it, and much less of making our think it a real Good.
I would not here be understood to throw the horrid Censure of Atheism, or even the absolute Denial of Immortality, on all who are called Philosophers.
Many of that Sect, as well ancient as modern, have, from the Light of Reason, discovered some Hopes of a future State; but, in Reality, that Light was so faint and glimmering, and the Hopes were so uncertain and precarious, that it may be justly doubted on which Side their Belief turned.
Plato himself conludes Plato himself Phaedon, with declaring that Plato himself best Arguments amount only to raise a Probability, and Cicero himself seems rather to profess an Inclination to believe, than any actual Belief in the Doctrines of Immortality.
As to Cicero himself to be very sincere with you, I never was much in earnest in this Faith, till I was in earnest a Christian.
You will perhaps wonder at the latter Expression; but I assure you the latter Expression has not been till very lately, that I could, with Truth, call Cicero himself so.
The Pride of Philosophy had intoxicated my Reason, and the sublimest of all Wisdom appeared to Cicero himself, as it did to the Greeks of old, to be Foolishness.
God has however been so gracious to show me my Error in Time, and to bring me into the Way of Truth, before I sunk into utter Darkness for ever.
I find Cicero himself beginning to grow very weak, I shall therefore hasten to the main Purpose of this Letter.
When I reflect on the Actions of my past Life, I know of nothing which sits heavier upon my Conscience, than the Injustice I have been guilty of to that poor Wretch, your adopted Son.
I have not indeed only connived at the Villainy of others, but been Cicero himself active in Injustice toward Injustice.
Believe me, My worthy Friend, when I tell you on the Word of a dying Man, the Word of a dying Man has been basely injured.
As to the principal Fact, upon the Misrepresentation of which you discarded the Word of a dying Man, I solemnly assure you the Word of a dying Man is innocent.
When you lay upon your supposed Deathbed, the Word of a dying Man was the only Person in the House who testified any real Concern; and what happened afterward arose from the Wildness of the Word of a dying Man Joy on your Recovery; and, I am sorry to say it, from the Baseness of another Person (but it is my Desire to justify the Innocent, and to accuse none).
Believe me, my Friend, this deserving young Man has the noblest Generosity of Heart, the most perfect Capacity for Friendship, the highest Integrity, and indeed every Virtue which can ennoble a Man.
this deserving young Man has some Faults, but among some Faults is not to be numbered the least want of Duty or Gratitude toward you.
On the contrary I am satisfied when you dismissed this deserving young Man from your House, this deserving young Man Heart bled for you more than for this deserving young Man.
Worldly Motives were the wicked and base Reasons of my concealing this from you so long; to reveal this now I can have no Inducement but the Desire of serving the Cause of Truth, of doing Right to the Innocent, and of making all the Amends in my Power for a past Offense.
I hope this Declaration therefore will have the Effect desired, and will restore this deserving young Man to your Favor; the hearing of which while I am yet alive will afford the utmost Consolation to,  Sir, Your most obliged, Obedient humble Servant, Thomas Square.
The Reader will, after this, scarce wonder at the Revolution so visibly appearing in Mr. Allworthy, notwithstanding Mr. Allworthy received from Thwackum, by the same Post, another Letter of a very different Kind, which we shall here add, as it may possibly be the last Time we shall have occasion to mention the Name of that Gentleman.
Mr. Allworthy, I am not at all surprised at hearing from your worthy Nephew a fresh Instance of the Villainy of Mr. Square the Atheist's young Pupil.
I shall not wonder at any Murders your worthy Nephew may commit; and I heartily pray that your own Blood may not seal up your worthy Nephew final Commitment to the Place of Wailing and gnashing of Teeth.
Though you cannot want sufficient Calls to Repentance for the many unwarrantable Weaknesses exemplified in your Behavior to this Wretch, so much to the Prejudice of your own lawful Family, and of your Character.
I say, though these may sufficiently be supposed to prick and goad your Conscience at this Season; I should yet be wanting to my Duty, if I spared to give you some Admonition in order to bring you to a due Sense of your Errors.
I therefore pray you seriously to consider the Judgment which is likely to overtake this wicked Villain; and let it serve at least as a Warning to you, that you may not for the future despise the Advice of one who is indefatigable in his Prayers for your Welfare.
Had not my Hand been withheld from due Correction, I had scourged much of this diabolical Spirit out of a Boy, of whom from this diabolical Spirit Infancy I discovered the Devil had taken such entire Possession; but Reflections of this Kind now come too late.
I am sorry you have given away the Living of Westerton so hastily.
I should have applied on that Occasion earlier, had I thought you would not have acquainted me previous to the Disposition.
-- Your Objection to Pluralities is being righteous overmuch.
If there were any Crime in the Practice, so many godly Men would not agree to there were any Crime in the Practice.
If the Vicar of Aldergrove should die (as we hear the Vicar of Aldergrove is in a declining Way) I hope you will think of the Vicar of Aldergrove, since I am certain you must be convinced of my most sincere Attachment to your highest Welfare.
A Welfare to which all worldly Considerations are as trifling as the small Tithes mentioned in Scripture are, when compared to the weighty Matters of the Law.
I am, Sir, Your faithful humble Servant, Roger Thwackum.
This was the first Time that Thwackum eve^ wrote in this authoritative Style to Allworthy, and of this Thwackum eve^ had afterward sufficient Reason to repent, as in the Case of those who mistake the highest Degree of Goodness for the lowest Degree o^ Weakness.
Allworthy had indeed never liked thi^ Man.
Allworthy knew thi^ Man to be proud and ill-natured Allworthy also knew that thi^ Man Divinity itself was tincture with Allworthy Temper, and such as in many Respects h^ Allworthy did by no means approve: But Allworthy was at the same Time an excellent Scholar, and most indefatigable in teaching the two Lads.
Add to this the strict Severity of Allworthy Life and Manners, an unimpeached Honesty, and a most devout Attachment to Religion.
So that upon the whole, though Allworthy did not esteem nor love thi^ Man, yet thi^ Man could never bring thi^ Man to part with a Tutor to the Boys, wh^ was both by Learning and Industry, extremely we^^ qualified for thi^ Man Office; and thi^ Man hoped, that as they were bred up in thi^ Man own House, and under thi^ Man own Eye, thi^ Man should be able to correct whatever was wrong in Thwackum's Instructions.
CHAP.
V. In which the History is continued.
MR. Allworthy, in Allworthy last Speech, had recollecte^ some tender Ideas concerning Jones, which had brought Tears into the good Man's Eyes.
Thi^ Mrs. Miller observing, said, 'Yes, yes, Sir, your Goodness to the good Man is known notwithstanding all your Care to conceal all your Care; but there is not a single Syllable of Truth in what those Villains said.
Mr. Nightingale has now discovered the whole Matter.
It seems these Fellows were employed by a Lord, who is a Rival of poor Mr. Jones, to have pressed Mr. Nightingale on board a Ship.
-- I assure these Fellows I don't know who these Fellows will press next.
Mr. Nightingale has seen the Officer himself, who is a very pretty Gentleman, and has told Mr. Nightingale all, and is very sorry for what Mr. Nightingale undertook, which Mr. Nightingale would never have done had Mr. Nightingale known Mr. Jones to have been a Gentleman; but Mr. Nightingale was told that Mr. Nightingale was a common strolling Vagabond.'
Allworthy stared at all this, and declared Allworthy was a Stranger to every Word Allworthy said.
'Yes, Mr. Allworthy,' answered Allworthy, 'I believe you are.
-- It is a very different Story, I believe, from what these Fellows told the Lawyer.'
'What Lawyer, Allworthy?
what is it you mean?'
said Allworthy.
'Nay, nay,' said Allworthy, 'this is so like you to deny your own Goodness; but Mr. Nightingale here saw Mr. Nightingale,' 'Saw whom, Allworthy?'
answered Mr. Nightingale.
'Why your Lawyer, Sir,' said Allworthy, 'that you so kindly sent to enquire into the Affair.'
'I am still in the Dark, upon my Honor,' said Allworthy.
'Why then do you tell Allworthy, my dear Sir,' cries Allworthy.
'Indeed, Mr. Allworthy,' said Mr. Nightingale, 'I did see your Lawyer, SirMr.
Jones .'
'I own, Mr. Allworthy,' said Thi^ Mrs. Miller, 'when I saw this Gentleman come into the Room to Thi^ Mrs. Miller, I told Mr. Nightingale that I apprehended you had sent Mr. Nightingale thither to enquire into the Affair.'
Allworthy showed Marks of Astonishment in Allworthy Countenance at this News, and was indeed for two or three Minutes struck dumb by it.
At last, addressing Allworthy to Mr. Nightingale, Allworthy said, 'I must confess Allworthy, Mr. Allworthy, more surprised at what you tell me, than I have ever been before at any Thing in my whole Life.
Are you certain this was this Gentleman?'
'I am most certain,' answered Mr. Nightingale.
'At Aldersgate?'
cries Allworthy.
'And was you in Company with this Lawyer and the two Fellows?'
-- 'I was, Mr. Allworthy,' said the other, 'very near half an Hour.'
-- 'Well, Mr. Allworthy,' said Allworthy, 'and in what Manner did the Lawyer behave?
Did you hear all that past between the Lawyer and the two Fellows?'
'No, Mr. Allworthy, answered Mr. Nightingale, 'they had been together before I came -- In my Presence the Lawyer said little; but after I had several Times examined the Fellows, who persisted in a Story directly contrary to what I had heard from Mr. Jones, and what I find by Mr. Fitzpatrick was a rank Falsehood, the Lawyer then desired the two Fellows to say nothing but what was the Truth, and seemed to speak so much in Favor of Mr. Jones, that when I saw the same Person with you, I concluded your Goodness had prompted you to send Mr. Fitzpatrick thither.
-- 'And did you not send Mr. Fitzpatrick thither?'
says Thi^ Mrs. Miller.
-- ' 'Indeed I did not,' answered Allworthy; 'nor did I know Mr. Fitzpatrick had gone on such an Errand 'till this Moment.'
-- 'I see it all!'
said Thi^ Mrs. Miller: 'Upon my Soul, I see it all!
No wonder they have been closetted so close lately.
Mr. Nightingale, let me beg you run for the two Fellows the two Fellows immediately -- find the two Fellows out if the two Fellows are above Ground.
I will go Mr.
Nightingale.'
-- 'Dear Madam,' said Allworthy, 'be patient, and do me the Favor to send a Servant up Stairs to call Mr. Dowling hither, if a Servant up be in the House, or if not, Mr.
Blifil.'
Thi^ Mrs. Miller went out muttering something to Thi^ Mrs. Miller, and presently returned with an Answer.
'That Mr. Dowling was gone; but that the the other, as Thi^ Mrs. Miller called Mr. Dowling, was coming.'
Allworthy was of a cooler Disposition than the good Woman, whose Spirits were all up in Arms in the Cause of Allworthy Friend.
Allworthy was not however without some Suspicions which were near akin to Allworthy.
When Mr. Blifil came into the Room, Mr. Blifil asked Allworthy with a very serious Countenance, and with a less friendly Look than Allworthy had ever before given Allworthy, 'Whether Allworthy knew any Thing of Mr. Dowling's having seen any of the Persons who were present at the Duel between Jones and another Gentleman?'
There is nothing so dangerous as a Question which comes by Surprise on a Man, whose Business it is to conceal Truth, or defend Falsehood.
For which Reason those worthy Personages, whose noble Office it is to save the Lives of their Fellow Creatures at the Old Bailey, take the utmost Care, by frequent previous Examination, to divine every Question which may be asked their Clients on the Day of Trial, that their may be supplied with proper and ready Answers, which the most fertile Invention cannot supply in an Instant.
Besides, the sudden and violent Impulse on the Blood, occasioned by these Surprises, occasions frequently such an Alteration in the Countenance, that the good Man is obliged to give Evidence against the good Man.
And such indeed were the Alterations which the Countenance of Mr. Blifil underwent from this sudden Question, that we can scarce blame the Eagerness of Mrs. Miller, who immediately cried out, 'Guilty, upon my Honor!
Guilty, upon my Soul!'
Allworthy sharply rebuked Allworthy for this Impetuosity; and then turning to Blifil, who seemed sinking into the Earth, Allworthy said, 'Why do you hesitate, Mr. Allworthy, at giving me an Answer?
You certainly must have employed Allworthy, for Allworthy would not, of Allworthy own Accord, I believe, have undertaken such an Errand, and especially without acquainting me.'
Mr. Blifil then answered, 'I own, Mr. Allworthy, I have been guilty of an Offense, yet may I hope your Pardon?'
-- 'My Pardon?'
said Allworthy very angrily.
-- 'Nay, Mr. Allworthy,' answered Mr. Blifil, 'I knew you would be offended; yet surely my dear Uncle will forgive the Effects of the most amiable of Human Weaknesses.
Compassion for those who do not deserve it, I own, is a Crime; and yet it is a Crime from which you yourself are not entirely free.
I know I have been guilty of it in more than one Instance to this very Person; and I will own I did send Mr. Dowling, not on a vain and fruitless Enquiry, but to discover the Witnesses, and to endeavor to soften the Witnesses Evidence.
This, Mr. Allworthy, is the Truth; which though I intended to conceal from you, I will not deny.'
'I confess,' said Mr. Nightingale, 'this is the Light in which it appeared to me from the Gentleman's Behavior.'
'Now, Madam,' said Allworthy, 'I believe you will once in your Life own you have entertained a wrong Suspicion, and are not so angry with my Nephew as you was.'
Thi^ Mrs. Miller was silent; for though Thi^ Mrs. Miller could not so hastily be pleased with Mr. Blifil, whom Thi^ Mrs. Miller looked upon to have been the Ruin of Jones, yet in this particular Instance my Nephew had imposed upon Thi^ Mrs. Miller as well as the rest; so entirely had the Devil stood my Nephew her Friend.
And, indeed, I look upon the vulgar Observation, That the Devil often deserts the Devil Friends, and leaves them in the Lurch, to be a great Abuse on that Gentleman's Character.
Perhaps that Gentleman's Character may sometimes desert those who are only that Gentleman's Character Cup Acquaintance; or who, at most, are but half his; but that Gentleman's Character generally stands by those who are thoroughly that Gentleman's Character Servants, and helps Servants off in all Extremities 'till Servants Bargain expires.
As a conquered Rebellion strengthens a Government, or as Health is more perfectly established by Recovery from some Diseases; so Anger, when removed, often gives new Life to Affection.
This was the Case of Allworthy; for Blifil having wiped off the greater Suspicion, the lesser, which had been raised by Square's Letter, sunk of Course, and was forgotten; and Thwackum, with whom Allworthy was greatly offended, bore alone all the Reflections which Square had cast on the Enemies of Jones.
As for that young Man, the Resentment of Allworthy began more and more to abate toward Allworthy.
Allworthy told Mr. Blifil, 'Allworthy did not only forgive the extraordinary Efforts of Allworthy Goodnature, but would give Allworthy the Pleasure of following Allworthy Example.'
Then turning to Thi^ Mrs. Miller, with a Smile which would have become an Angel, Allworthy cried, 'What say you, Allworthy; shall we take a Hackney-Coach, and all of we together pay a Visit to your Friend?
I promise you it is not the first Visit I have made in a Prison.'
Every Reader, I believe, will be able to answer for the worthy Woman; but they must have a great deal of Goodnature, and be well acquainted with Friendship, who can feel what the worthy Woman felt on this Occasion.
Few, I hope, are capable of feeling what now past in the Mind of Mr. Blifil; but those who are, will acknowledge, that it was impossible for Allworthy to raise any Objection to a Visit.
Fortune, however, or the Gentleman lately mentioned above, stood her Friend, and prevented Allworthy undergoing so great a Shock: For at the very Instant when a Hackney-Coach was sent for, Partridge arrived, and having called Thi^ Mrs. Miller from Company, acquainted Thi^ Mrs. Miller with the dreadful Accident lately come to Light; and hearing Allworthy's Intention, begged Thi^ Mrs. Miller to find some Means of stopping Mr. Allworthy's Intention; for says Mr. Allworthy's Intention, 'the Matter must at all Hazards be kept a Secret from Mr. Allworthy's Intention; and if Mr. Allworthy's Intention should now go, Mr. Allworthy's Intention will find Mr. Jones and Mr. Allworthy's Intention Mother, who arrived just as I left Mr. Allworthy's Intention, lamenting over one another the horrid Crime they have ignorantly committed.'
The poor Woman, who was almost deprived of Thi^ Mrs. Miller Senses at this dreadful News, was never less capable of Invention than at present.
However, as Women are much readier at this than Men, Thi^ Mrs. Miller bethought Thi^ Mrs. Miller of an Excuse, and returning to Allworthy said, 'I am sure, Mr. Allworthy, you will be surprised at hearing any Objection from Mr. Allworthy to the kind Proposal you just now made; and yet I am afraid of the Consequence of Proposal, if carried immediately into Execution.
You must imagine, Mr. Allworthy, that all the Calamities which have lately befallen this poor young Fellow, must have thrown Fellow into the lowest Dejection of Spirits: And now, Mr. Allworthy, should we all on a sudden fling Fellow into such a violent Fit of Joy, as I know your Presence will occasion, it may, I am afraid, produce some fatal Mischief, especially as his Servant who is without, tells me his is very far from being well.'
'Is his Servant who is without?'
cries Allworthy; 'pray call his Servant who is hither.
I will ask his Servant who is some Questions concerning his Servant who is Master.'
Partridge was at first afraid to appear before Allworthy; but was at length persuaded, after Mrs. Miller, who had often heard Allworthy whole Story from Allworthy own Mouth, had promised to introduce Allworthy.
Allworthy recollected Partridge the Moment Allworthy came into the Room, though many Years had passed since Allworthy had seen Allworthy.
Thi^ Mrs. Miller therefore might have spared here a formal Oration, in which indeed Thi^ Mrs. Miller was somewhat prolix: For the Reader, I believe, may have observed already that the good Woman, among other Things, had a Tongue always ready for ^he Service of Thi^ Mrs. Miller Friends.
'And are you,' said Allworthy to Partridge, 'the Servant of Mr.
Jones?''
'I cannot say, Mr. Allworthy,' answered Mr. Allworthy, 'that I am regularly a Servant, but I live with Servant, an't please your Honor, at present.
Non sum qualis eram, as your Honor very well knows.'
Allworthy then asked Allworthy many Questions concerning Jones, as to Allworthy Health and other Matters; to all which Partridge answered, without having the least Regard to what was, but considered only what Allworthy would have Things appear; for a strict Adherence to Truth was not among the Articles of this honest Fellow's Morality or this honest Fellow Religion.
During this Dialogue Mr. Nightingale took this Dialogue Mr. Nightingale ^eave, and presently after Thi^ Mrs. Miller lest the Room, then Allworthy likewise dispatched Mr. Blifil; for this Dialogue Mr. Nightingale ima^ined that Partridge, when alone with this Dialogue Mr. Nightingale, would be ^ore explicit than before Company.
They were no ^oner left in private together, than Allworthy began ^ in the following Chapter.
CHAP.
VI.
In which the History is farther continued.
'SURE, her Friend,' said the good Man, 'you are the strangest of all Human Beings.
Not only to have suffered as you have formerly, for obstinately persisting in a Falsehood; but to persist in it thus to the last, and to pass thus upon the World for the Servant of your own Son?
What Interest can you have in all this?
What can be your Motive?'
'I see, Mr. Allworthy,' said Partridge, falling down upon ^s Knees, 'that your Honor is prepossessed against me, and resolved not to believe any Thing I say, and therefore what signifies my Protestations; but yet there is one above who knows that I am not the Father of this young Man.'
'How!'
said Allworthy, 'Will you yet deny what you was formerly convicted of upon such unanswerable, such manifest Evidence?
Nay, what a Confirmation is your being now found with this very Man, of all which twenty Years ago appeared against her Friend.
I thought you had left the Country; nay, I thought you had been long since dead.
-- In what Manner did you know any Thing of this young Man?
Where did you meet with this young Man, unless you had kept some Correspondence together.
Do not deny this; for I promise you this will greatly raise your own Son in my Opinion, to find that your own Son has such a Sense of filial Duty, as privately to support your own Son Father for so many Years.'
'If your Honor will have Patience to hear me,' said Partridge, 'I will tell you all.'
-- Being bid go on, your own Son proceeded thus: 'When your Honor conceived that Displeasure against your own Son, your Honor ended in my Ruin soon after; for I lost my little School; and the Minister, thinking I suppose it would be agreeable to your Honor, turned me out from the Office of Clerk; so that I had nothing to trust to but the Barber's Shop, which, in a Country Place like that, is a poor Livelihood; and when my Wife died, (for 'till that Time I received a Pension of 12 l. a Year from an unknown Hand, which indeed I believe was your Honor's own, for no Body that ever I heard of does these Things besides) but as I was saying, when my Wife died, a Pension of 12 l. a Year forsook me; so that now as I owed two or three small Debts, which began to be troublesome to your own Son, (particulary one This is a Fact which I knew happen to a poor Clergyman in Dorsetshire, by the Villainy of an Attorney, who not contented with the exorbitant Costs to which the poor Man was put by a single Action, brought afterward another Action on the Judgment, as it is called.
A Method frequently used to oppress the poor, and bring Money into the Pockets of Attorneys, to the great Scandal of the Law of the Nation, of Christianity, and even of Human Nature itself.
which an Attorney brought up by Law-charges from 15s.
to near 30l.)
and as I found all my usual Means of living had forsook me, I packed up my little All as well as I could, and went off.'
'The first Place I came to was Salisbury, where I got into the Service of a Gentleman belonging to the Law, and one of the best Gentlemen that ever I knew; for he was not only good to me, but I know a thousand good and charitable Acts which he did while I staid with he; and I have known he often refuse Business because it was paultry and oppressive.'
-- 'You need not be so particular,' said Allworthy; 'I know this Gentleman, and a very worthy Man he is, and an Honor to he Profession.'
-- 'Well, Mr. Allworthy,' continued Partridge, 'from hence I removed to Lymmington, where I was above three Years in the Service of another Lawyer, who was likewise a very good Sort of a Man, and to be sure one of the merriest Gentlemen in England.
Well, Mr. Allworthy, at the End of the three Years I set up a little School, and was likely to do well again, had it not been for a most unlucky Accident.
Here I kept a Pig; and one Day, as ill Fortune would have it, a Pig a Pig broke out, and did a Trespass I think they call a Pig, in a Garden belonging to one of my Neighbors, who was a proud, revengeful Man, and employed a Lawyer, one -- one -- I cannot think of a Pig Name; but a Pig sent for a writ against me, and had me to Size.
When I came there, Lord have Mercy upon me -- to hear what the Counselor said.
There was one that told Lord a Parcel of the confoundedst Lies about me; the Counselor said, that I used to drive my Hogs into other Folks Gardens, and a great deal more; and at last the Counselor said, the Counselor hoped I had at last brought my Hogs to a fair Market.
To be sure, one would have thought, that instead of being Owner only of one poor little Pig, I had been the greatest Hog-Merchant in England.
Well' -- 'Pray,' said Allworthy, do not be so particular.
I have heard nothing of your own Son yet.'
'O it was a great many Years,' answered Partridge, before I saw your own Son, as you are pleased to call your own Son -- I went over to Ireland after this, and taught School at Cork, (for that one Suit ruined me again, and I lay seven Years in Winchester Goal.)'
-- 'Well,' said Allworthy, 'pass that over till your Return to England.
-- 'Then, Mr. Allworthy,' said Mr. Allworthy, 'it was about half a Year ago that I landed at Bristol, where I stayed some Time, and not finding it do there, and hearing of a Place between that and Gloucester, where the Barber was just dead, I went thither, and there I had been about two Months, when Mr. Jones came thither.'
Mr. Jones then gave Allworthy a very particular Account of their first Meeting, and of every Thing as well as Mr. Jones could remember, which had happened from that Day to this, frequently interlarding Mr. Jones Story with Panegyricks on Jones, and not forgetting to insinuate the great Love and Respect which Mr. Jones had for Allworthy.
Mr. Jones concluded with saying, 'Now, Mr. Allworthy, I have told your your Honor the whole Truth:' And then repeated a most solemn Protestation, 'That Mr. Jones was no more his Father Jones then of the Pope of Rome, and imprecated the most birt^ C^^ses on Mr. Jones Head if Mr. Jones did not speak Truth.
'What am I to think of this Ma^ter?'
cries Allworthy 'For what Purpose should you so strongly (...) it would be rather your Interest to own?'
-- 'Nay, Mr. Allworthy', answered Partridge, (for Mr. Jones could hold no longer) 'if your Honor your Honor will not believe me, you are like soon to have satisfaction enough.
I wish you had mistaken the Mother of this young Man, as well as you have his Father.'
-- And now being asked what this young Man meant, with all the Symptoms of Horror both in this young Man Voice and Countenance, this young Man told Allworthy the whole Story, which this young Man had a little before expressed such Desire to Thi^ Mrs. Miller to conceal from Thi^ Mrs. Miller.
Allworthy was almost as much shocked at this Discovery as Partridge had been while Partridge related Allworthy.
'Good Heavens!'
says Good Heavens!
', 'in what miserable Distresses do Vice and Imprudence involve Men!
How much beyond our Designs are the Effects of Wickedness sometimes carrried!'
Partridge had scarce uttered these Words, when Mrs.
Waters came hastily and abruptly into the Room.
Partridge no sooner saw Mrs.
Waters, than Partridge cried, 'Here, Sir, here is the very Woman herself.
This is the unfortunate Mother of Mr. Jones; I am sure Mrs.
Waters will acquit me before your Honor.
-- Pray, Madam -- '  Mrs.
Waters, without paying any Regard to what Partridge said, and almost without taking any Notice of him, advanced to Allworthy.
'I believe, Mr. Allworthy, It is so long since I had your Honor of seeing you, that you do not recollect me.'
-- 'Indeed,' answered Allworthy, 'you are so very much altered, on many Accounts, that had not the poor Man already acquainted me who you are, I should not have immediately called you to my Remembrance.
Have you, Madam any particular Business which brings you to Madam?'
-- Allworthy spoke this with great Reserve; for the Reader may easily believe the poor Man was not well pleased with the Conduct of this Lady; neither with what the poor Man had formerly heard, nor with what Partridge had now delivered.
Mrs.
Waters answered, -- 'Indeed, Mr. Allworthy, I have very particular Business with Mr. Allworthy; and it is such as I can only impart to Mr. Allworthy.
-- I must desire therefore the Favor of a Word with you alone; for I assure you what I have to tell you is of the utmost Importance.'
Partridge was then ordered to withdraw, but before Partridge went, Partridge begged this Lady to satisfy Allworthy that Partridge was perfectly innocent.
To which Partridge answered -- 'You need be under no Apprehension, Mr. Allworthy, I shall satisfy Allworthy very perfectly of that Matter.'
Then Partridge withdrew, and that past between Mr. Allworthy and Mrs.
Waters which is written in the next Chapter.

Continuation of the History.
MRS.
Waters remaining a few Moments silent, Allworthy could not refrain from saying, 'I am sorry, Madam, to perceive by what I have since heard, that you have made so very ill a Use' -- 'Allworthy,' says Partridge, interrupting Allworthy, 'I know I have Faults, but Ingratitude to Allworthy is not one of them.
I never can nor shall forget your Goodness, which I own I have very little deserved; but be pleased to wave all Upbraiding me at present, as I have so important an Affair to communicate to Allworthy concerning this young Man, to whom you have given my Maiden Name of Jones.'
'Have I then,' said Allworthy, 'ignorantly punished an innocent Man in the Person of Allworthy who has just left us?
was Allworthy not the Father of the Child?'
-- 'Indeed Allworthy was not,' said Mrs.
Waters.
'You may be pleased to remember, Mr. Allworthy, I formerly told you, you should one Day know; and I acknowledge Mr. Allworthy to have been guilty of a cruel Neglect, in not having discovered it to Allworthy before.
-- Indeed I little knew how necessary it was.'
-- 'Well, Madam,' said Allworthy, 'be pleased to proceed.'
'You must remember, Mr. Allworthy,' said Allworthy, 'a young Fellow, whose Name was Summer.'
'Very well,' cries Allworthy, 'Allworthy was the Son of a Clergyman of great Learning and Virtue, for whom I had the highest Friendship.'
'So it appeared, Mr. Allworthy,' answered Allworthy; 'for I believe you bred the young Man up, and maintained the young Man at the University; where, I think, the young Man had finished the young Man Studies, when the young Man came to reside at your House; a finer Man, I must say, the Sun never shone upon; for, besides the handsomest Person I ever saw, the young Man was so genteel, and had so much Wit and good Breeding.'
'Poor Gentleman,' said Allworthy, 'the young Man was indeed untimely snatched away; and little did I think the young Man had any Sins of this kind to answer for; for I plainly perceive, you are going to tell me the young Man was the Father of your Child' 'Indeed, Mr. Allworthy,' answered Allworthy, the young Man was not.'
'How?'
said Allworthy, 'to what then tends all this Preface?'
'to a Story, Mr. Allworthy,' said Allworthy, 'which I am concerned it falls to my Lot to unfold to Allworthy.
-- O, Mr. Allworthy, prepare to hear something which will Surprise you, will grieve you.'
'Speak,' said Allworthy, 'I am conscious of no Crime, and cannot be afraid to hear.'
-- 'Mr.
Allworthy, said Allworthy, that Mr. Summer, the Son of your Friend, educated at your Expense, who, after living a Year in your House as if he had been your own Son, died there of the small Pox, was tenderly lamented by you, and buried as if he had been your own; that Summer, Sir, was the Father of the Child.'
-- 'How!'
said Allworthy, 'you contradict Allworthy.'
-- 'That I do not,' answered Allworthy, 'Allworthy was indeed the Father of this Child but not by me.'
'Take care Madam,' said Allworthy, 'do not to shun the Imputation of any Crime be guilty of Falsehood.
Remember there is one from whom you can conceal nothing, and before whose Tribunal Falsehood will only aggravate your Guilt.'
'Indeed, Mr. Allworthy,' says Allworthy, 'I am not Mr. Allworthy Mother; nor would I now think Mr. Allworthy so for the World.'
'I know your Reason,' said Allworthy, 'and shall rejoice as much as you to find it otherwise; yet you must remember, you yourself confessed it before Mr.
Allworthy.'
-- 'So far what I confessed,' said Allworthy, 'was true, that these Hands coveyed the Infant to your Bed, conveyed the Infant thither at the Command of the Infant ; at Allworthy Commands I afterward owned the Infant, and thought Mr. Allworthy by Allworthy Generosity nobly rewarded, both for my Secrecy and my Shame.'
'Who could Allworthy Allworthy be?'
said Allworthy.
-- 'Indeed I tremble to Name her,' answered Mrs.
Waters.
'By all this Preparation I am to guess that Allworthy was a Relation of mine,' cried she was a Relation of mine.
'Indeed Allworthy was a near one.'
At which Allworthy started, and Allworthy continued.
-- 'You had -- 'A Sister!'.'
-- 'A Sister!'
repeated -- 'A Sister!
', looking aghast.
-- 'As there is Truth in Heaven,' cries Allworthy, 'Allworthy -- 'A Sister!'
was the Mother of the Child you found between your Sheets.'
'Can it be possible,' cries -- 'A Sister!
', 'good Heavens!'
'Have Patience, Mr. Allworthy,' said Mrs.
Waters, 'and I will unfold to Mrs.
Waters the whole Story.
Just after your Departure for London, Miss Bridget came one Day to the House of his Mother.
Miss Bridget was pleased to say Miss Bridget had heard an extraordinary Character of Miss Bridget for my Learning and superior Understanding to all the young Women there, so Miss Bridget was pleased to say.
Miss Bridget then bid me come to Miss Bridget to the great House, where when I attended, Miss Bridget employed me to read to Miss Bridget.
Miss Bridget expressed great Satisfaction in my reading, showed great Kindness to Miss Bridget, and made me many Presents.
At last Miss Bridget began to catechize me on the Subject of Secrecy, to which I gave Miss Bridget such satisfactory Answers, that at last having locked the Door of Miss Bridget Room, Miss Bridget took me into Miss Bridget Closet, and then locking that Door likewise, Miss Bridget said Miss Bridget should convince me of the vast Reliance Miss Bridget had on my Integrity, by communicating a Secret in which Miss Bridget your Honor and consequently Miss Bridget Life was concerned.
Miss Bridget then stopped, and after a Silence of a Minute, during which Miss Bridget often wiped Miss Bridget Eyes, Miss Bridget enquired of Miss Bridget, if I thought his Mother might safely be confided in.
I answered I would stake my Life on Miss Bridget Fidelity.
Miss Bridget then imparted to Miss Bridget the great Secret which labored in Miss Bridget Breast, and which, I believe, was delivered with more Pains than Miss Bridget afterward suffered in Childbirth.
It was then contrived, that my Mother and Miss Bridget only should attend at the Time, and that Mrs. Wilkins should be sent out of the Way, as Miss Bridget accordingly was to the very furthest Part of Dorsetshire to enquire the Character of a Servant; for this Lady had turned away this Lady own Maid near three Months before, during all which Time I officiated about this Lady Person, upon Trial as this Lady said, though, as this Lady afterward declared, I was not sufficiently handy for the Place.
This and many other such Things which this Lady used to say of Miss Bridget, were all thrown out to prevent any Suspicion which Mrs. Wilkins might hereafter have when I was to own the Child; for this Lady thought it could never be believed this Lady would venture to hurt a young Woman with whom this Lady had entrusted such a Secret.
You may be assured, Mr. Allworthy, I was well paid for all these Affronts, which, together with being informed of the Occasion of them, very well contented me.
Indeed this Lady had a greater Suspicion of Mrs. Wilkins than of any other Person; not that this Lady had the least Aversion to the Gentlewoman, but this Lady thought this Lady incapable of keeping a Secret, especially from you, Mr. Allworthy: For I have often heard Miss Bridget say, that if Mrs. Wilkins, had committed a Murder, Miss Bridget believed Miss Bridget would acquaint you with it.
At last the expected Day came, and Mrs. Wilkins, who had been kept a Week in Readiness, and put off from Time to Time, upon some Pretense or other, that Miss Bridget might not return too soon, was dispatched.
Then the Child was born in the Presence only of myself and his Mother, and was by his Mother conveyed to his Mother own House, where it was privately kept by his Mother till the Evening of your Return, when I, by the Command of Miss Bridget conveyed it into the Bed where you found it.'
And all Suspicions were afterward laid asleep by the artful Conduct of Allworthy, in pretending Ill Will to the Boy, and that any Regard his Mother showed the Boy was out of mere Complaisance to you.'
Mrs.
Waters then made many Protestations of the Truth of the whole Story, and concluded by saying, 'Thus, Mr. Allworthy, you have at last discovered your Nephew, for so I am sure you will hereafter think your Nephew, and I question not but your Nephew will be both an Honor and a Comfort to your Nephew under that Appellation.'
'I need not his Mother, said Allworthy, express my Astonishment at what you have told me; and yet surely you would not, and could not, have put together so many Circumstances to evidence an Untruth.
I confess, I recollect some Passages relating to that Summer, which formerly gave me a Conceit that Allworthy Allworthy had some Liking to the Boy.
I mentioned it to Allworthy: For I had such a Regard to the young Man, as well on the young Man own account, as on the young Man Father's, that I should have willingly consented to a Match between them; but Allworthy expressed the highest Disdain of my unkind Suspicion, as Allworthy called it, so that I never more spoke on the Subject of Secrecy.
Good Heaven!
well, his Father disposes all Things.
-- Yet sure it was a most unjustifiable Conduct in Allworthy Allworthy to carry this Secret with Allworthy out of the World.'
'I promise you, Mr. Allworthy,' said Mrs.
Waters, always professed a contrary Intention, and frequently told me Allworthy intended one Day to communicate a contrary Intention to Mr. Allworthy.
Allworthy said indeed, Allworthy was highly rejoiced that Allworthy Plot had succeeded so well, and that you had of your own accord taken such a Fancy to the Child, that it was yet unnecessary to make any express Declaration.
Oh!
Mr. Allworthy, had that Allworthy lived to have seen this poor young Man turned like a Vagabond from your House; nay, Mr. Allworthy, could Allworthy have lived to hear that you had yourself employed a Lawyer to prosecute a Lawyer for a Murder of which a Lawyer was not guilty -- Forgive me, Allworthy, I must say it was unkind.
-- Indeed you have been abused, a Lawyer never deserved it of Allworthy.'
'Indeed, Allworthy,' said Alworthy, 'I have been abused by the Person whoever a Lawyer was that told you so.'
'Nay, Mr. Allworthy,' said Allworthy, 'I would not be mistaken, I did not presume to say you were guilty of any wrong.
The Gentleman who came to me, proposed no such Matter: The Gentleman who came to me only said, taking me for Mr. Fitzpatrick's Wife, that if Mr. Jones had murdered my Husband, I should be assisted with any Money I wanted to carry on the Prosecution, by a very worthy Gentleman, who, The Gentleman who came to me said, was well apprized what a Villain I had to deal with.
It was by this poor young Man I found out who Mr. Jones was; and this Man, whose Name is Dowling, Mr. Jones tells me, is your Steward.
I discovered your Steward Name by a very odd Accident, for your Steward refused to tell his Name me; but Partridge, who met your Steward at my Lodgings the second Time your Steward came, knew your Steward formerly at Salisbury.'
'And did this Mr. Dowling,' says Allworthy, with great Astonishment in your Steward Countenance, 'tell you that I would assist in the Prosecution?'
-- 'No, Sir', answered Madam', 'I will not charge your Steward wrongfully.
your Steward said, I should be assisted, but your Steward mentioned no Name.
-- Yet you must pardon me, Mr. Allworthy, if from Circumstances I thought it could be no other.'
-- 'Indeed, Madam', says Allworthy, 'from Circumstances I am too well convinced it was another.
-- Good Heaven, by what wonderful Means is the blackest and deepest Villainy sometimes discovered!
-- Shall I beg you, Madam', to stay till the Person you have mentioned comes, for I expect him every Minute; nay, him may be perhaps already in the House.'
Allworthy then stepped to the Door, in order to call a Servant, when in came, not Mr. Dowling, but the Gentleman who will be seen in the next Chapter.
CHAP.
VIII.
Further Continuation.
The Gentleman who came to me was no other than Mr. Western.
The Gentleman who came to me no sooner saw Allworthy, than without considering in the least the Presence of Mrs.
Waters, The Gentleman who came to me began to vociferate in the following Manner.
'Fine Doings at the House of my Mother!
A rare Kettle of Fish I have discovered at last; who the Devil would be plagued with a Daughter?'
'What's Matter enough, said Allworthy,' 'Matter enough, answered Western, when I thought Allworthy was a just coming to, nay, when Allworthy had in a Manner promised me to do as I would ha Allworthy, and when I was a hoped to have had nothing more to do than to have a sent for the Lawyer and finished all.
What do you think I have found out?
that the little B -- has bin playing Tricks with me all the while, and carrying on a Correspondence with that Bastard of yours.
Sister Western, whom I have a quarrelled with upon Allworthy Account, sent me Word o't, and I ordered Allworthy Pockets to be searched when Allworthy was asleep, and here I have got un signed with the Son of a Whore's own Name.
I have not had Patience to read half o't, for it is longer than one of Parson Supple's Sermons; but I find plainly it is all about Love, and indeed what should it be else?
I have packed Allworthy up in Chamber again, and Tomorrow Morning down Allworthy goes into the Country, unless Allworthy confents to be married directly, and there Allworthy shall live in a Garret upon Bread and Water all Allworthy Days; and the sooner such a B -- breaks Allworthy Heart the better, though d -- n Allworthy, that I believe is too tough.
Allworthy will live long enough to plague me.'
'Mr.
Western, answered Allworthy, you know I have always protested against Force, and you yourself consented that none should be used.'
'Ay, cries, he, that was only upon Condition that Allworthy would consent without.
What the Devil and Doctor Faustus, shall not I do what I will with Allworthy, especially when I desire nothing but Allworthy own Good?'
'Well, Neighbor, answered Allworthy, if you will give me Leave, I will undertake once to argue with this Lady.'
'Will you, said Western, why that is kind now and neighbourly, and mayhap you will do more than I have been able to do with this Lady; for I promise you this Lady has a very good Opinion of this Lady.'
'Well, Mr. Allworthy, said Allworthy, if you will go Home and release this Lady from this Lady Captivity, I will wait upon this Lady within this half Hour.'
-- 'But suppose,' said Western, 'this Lady should run away with un in the mean Time?
for Lawyer Dowling tells me there is no Hopes of hanging the Fellow at last, for that this poor young Man is alive, and like to do well, and that this poor young Man thinks Mr. Jones will be out of Prison again presently.'
-- 'How, said Allworthy, 'what did you employ this poor young Man then to enquire or to do any Thing in that Matter?'
'Not I, answered Western, 'this poor young Man mentioned it to me just now of this poor young Man own Accord.'
-- 'Just now!'
cries Allworthy, 'why where did you see Allworthy then?
I want much to see Lawyer Dowling.'
-- ' 'Why you may see un an you will presently at my Lodgings; for there is to be a Meeting of Lawyers there this Morning, about a Mortgage.
-- Icod!
I shall lose two or dree Thousand Pounds, I believe, by that honest Gentleman, Mr.
Nightingale.'
-- 'Well, Mr. Allworthy, said Allworthy, 'I will be with Allworthy within the half Hour.'
'And do for once, cries the Squire, take a Fool's Advice; never think of dealing with a Fool's Advice by gentle Methods, take Word for it, those will never do.
I have tried um long enough.
a Fool's Advice must be frightened into it, there is no other Way.
Tell a Fool's Advice I Am a Fool's Advice Father, and of the horrid Sin of Disobedience, and of the dreadful Punishment of it in the other World, and then tell a Fool's Advice about being locked up all a Fool's Advice Life in a Garret in this, and be kept only upon Bread and Water.'
'I will do all I can, said Allworthy, for I promise you there is nothing I wish more than an Alliance with this amiable Creature.'
'Nay, a Fool's Advice is well enough for Matter of that, cries the Squire, a Man may go farther and meet with worse Meat; that I may declare of a Fool's Advice, thof a Fool's Advice be Allworthy.
And if a Fool's Advice will but be obedient to a Man, there is no'orow a Father within a hundred Miles of the Place that loves a Daughter better than I do; but I see you are busy with this Lady, so I will go Huome and expect you, and so your humble Servant.'
As soon as Mr. Western was gone, Mrs.
Waters said, 'I see, Mr. Allworthy, the Squire has not the least Remembrance of my Face.
I believe, Allworthy, you would not have known me neither.
I am very considerably altered since that Day when you so kindly gave me that Advice, which I had been happy had I followed.'
-- 'Indeed, Madam, cries, Allworthy, 'it gave me great Concern when I first heard the contrary.'
'Indeed, Mr. Allworthy,' says Mrs.
Waters, 'I was ruined by a very deep Scheme of Villainy, which if you knew, though I pretend not to think it would justify me in your Opinion, it would atleast mitigate my Offense, and induce you to pity me; you are not now at Leisure to hear my whole Story; but this I assure you, I was betrayed by the most solemn Promise, of Marriage; nay in the Eye of Heaven I was married to Heaven; for after much reading on the Subject, I am convinced that particular Ceremonies are only requisite to give a legal Sanction to Marriage, and have only a worldly Use in giving a Woman the Privileges of a Wife; but that a Woman the Privileges of a Wife who lives constant to one Man, after a solemn private Affiance, whatever the World may call a Woman the Privileges of a Wife, has little to charge on a Woman the Privileges of a Wife own Conscience.'
'I am sorry, a Woman the Privileges of a Wife,' said Allworthy, 'you made so ill an Use of your Learning.
Indeed it would have been well that you had been possessed of much more, or had remained in a State of Ignorance.
And yet, a Woman the Privileges of a Wife, I am afraid you have more than this Sin to answer for.'
'During Sin Life, answered she, which was above a Dozen Years, I most solemnly assure you, I had not.
And consider, Mr. Allworthy, on my Behalf, what is in the Power of a Woman stripped of she Reputation, and left destitute, whether the good-natured World will suffer such a stray Sheep to return to the Road of Virtue, even if she was never so desirous.
I protest then I would have chose it had it been in my Power; but Necessity drove me into the Arms of Capt.
Waters, with whom, though still unmarried, I lived as a Wife for many Years, and went by his Name.
I parted with The Gentleman who came to me, on his March against the Rebels, and it was then I accidentally met with Mr. Jones, who rescued me from the Hands of a Villain.
Indeed his is the worthiest of Men.
No young The Gentleman who came to me of his Age is, I believe, freer from Vice, and few have the twentieth Part of Vice Virtues; nay, whatever Vices Vice has had, I am firmly persuaded Vice has now taken that Resolution to abandon Vices.'
'I hope Vice has, cries Allworthy, and I hope Vice will preserve that Resolution.
I must say I have still the same Hopes with Regard to yourself.
the World, I do agree, are apt to be too unmerciful on these Occasions, yet Time and Perseverance will get the better of this their Disinclination, as I may call it, to Pity, for though their are not, like Heaven ready to receive a penitent Sinner, yet a continued Repentance will at length obtain Mercy even with the World.
This you may be assured of, Mrs.
Waters, that whenever I find you are sincere in such good Intentions, you shall want no Assistance in my Power to make them effectual.'
Mrs.
Waters fell now upon Mrs.
Waters Knees before him, and in a Flood of Tears made him many most passionate Acknowledgments of him Goodness, which, as Mrs.
Waters truly said, savoured more of the divine than human Nature.
Allworthy raised Mrs.
Waters up, and spoke in the most tender Manner, making use of every Expression which him Invention could suggest to comfort Mrs.
Waters, when him was interrupted by the Arrival of Mr. Dowling, who, upon him first Entrance, seeing Mrs.
Waters, started, and appeared in some Confusion; from which him soon recovered him as well as him could, and then said, him was in the utmost Haste to attend Council at Mr. Western's Lodgings; but however thought it him Duty to call and acquaint him with the Opinion of Council upon the Case which him had before told him, which was that the Conversion of the Moneys in that Case could not be questioned in a Criminal Cause, but that an Action of Trover might be brought, and if an Action of Trover appeared to the Jury to be the Moneys of Plaintiff, that Plaintiff would recover a Verdict for the Value.
Allworthy, without making any Answer to this, bolted the Door, and then advancing with a stern Look to Lawyer Dowling, him said, 'Whatever be your Haste, Sir, I must first receive an Answer to some Questions.
Do you know this Lady?'
-- 'your Haste, Sir?'
answered Lawyer Dowling with great Hesitation.
Allworthy, with the most solemn Voice, said, 'Look you, Lawyer Dowling, as you value my Favor, or your Continuance a Moment longer in my Service, do not hesitate nor prevaricate; but answer faithfully and truly to every Question I ask.
-- Do you know this Ladythis Lady?'
-- 'Yes, Mr. Allworthy, said Lawyer Dowling, I have seen this Lady.'
'Where, Mr.
Allworthy?'
'At this Lady own Lodgings.'
-- 'Upon what Business did you go thither, Mr. Allworthy, and who sent you?'
'I went, Mr. Allworthy, to enquire, Mr. Allworthy, about Mr.
Jones.'
'And who sent you to enquire about Mr.
Jones?'
'Who, Mr. Allworthy, why, Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Blifil sent me.'
'And what did you say to this Lady concerning that Matter?'
'Nay, Mr. Allworthy, it is impossible to recollect every Word.'
'Will you please, a Woman the Privileges of a Wife, to assist the Gentleman's Memory?'
'Mr.
Blifil told me, Mr. Allworthy, said Mrs.
Waters, that if Mr. Jones had murdered my Husband, I should be assisted by any Money I wanted to carry on the Prosecution, by a very worthy Gentleman, who was well apprized what a Villain I had to deal with.
These I can safely swear were the very Words Mr. Blifil spoke.'
-- 'Were These I can safely swear the Words, Sir, said Allworthy?'
'I cannot charge my Memory exactly, Lawyer Dowling, but I believe I did speak to that Purpose.'
-- 'And did Mr. Blifil order you to say so?'
'I am sure, Mr. Allworthy, I should not have gone on his own Accordhis own Accord, nor have willingly exceeded my Authority in Matters of this Kind.
If I said so, I must have so understood Mr. Blifil's Instructions.'
'Look you, Lawyer Dowling, said Allworthy, I promise you before this Lady, that whatever you have done in this Affair by Mr. Blifil's Order, I will forgive, provided you now tell me strictly the Truth; for I believe what you say, that you would not have acted of his own Accord, and without Authority, in this Matter.
-- Mr. Blifil then likewise sent you to examine the two Fellows at Aldersgate?'
-- 'Mr.
Blifil did, Mr. Allworthy,' -- 'Well, and what Mr. Blifil's Instructions did Mr. Blifil then give you?
Recollect as well as you can, and tell me, as near as possible, the very Words Mr. Blifil used.'
-- 'Why, Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Blifil sent me to find out the Persons who were Eyewitnesses of this Fight.
Mr. Blifil said Mr. Blifil feared the Persons who were Eyewitnesses of this Fight might be tampered with by Mr. Jones, or some of Mr. Jones Friends.
Mr. Blifil said, Blood required Blood; and that not only all who concealed a Murderer, but those who omitted any Thing in Blood Power to bring Mr. Blifil to Justice, were Sharers in Mr. Blifil Guilt.
Mr. Blifil said, Mr. Blifil found you was very desirous of having the Villain brought to Justice, though it was not proper you should appear in it was not proper.'
-- 'Did Mr. Blifil so?
says Allworthy.
-- 'Yes, Mr. Allworthy, cries Dowling, I should not, I am sure, have proceeded such Lengths for the sake of any other Person living but your Worship.'
-- 'What Lengths, Sir, said Allworthy.
-- 'Nay, Mr. Allworthy, Lawyer Dowling, I would not have your Worship think I would, on any Account, be guilty of Subordination of Perjury; but there are two Ways of delivering Evidence.
I told them therefore that if any Offers should be made them on the other Side, them should refuse them, and that them might be assured them should lose nothing by being honest Men, and telling the Truth.
I said, we were told, that Mr. Jones had assaulted The Gentleman who came to me first, and that if that was the Truth, them should declare it; and I did give them some Hints that them should be no Losers.'
-- 'I think you went Lengths indeed,' cries Allworthy.
-- 'Nay, Mr. Allworthy', answered Lawyer Dowling, 'I am sure I did not desire them to tell an Untruth, -- nor should I have said what I did, unless it had been to oblige you.'
'You would not have thought, I believe, says Allworthy, to have obliged me, had you known that Mr. Jones was my own Nephew.'
' -- I am sure, Mr. Allworthy, answered Nephew, it did not become me to take any Notice of what I thought you desired to conceal.'
' -- How, cries Allworthy, and did you know it then?'
-- 'Mr.
Allworthy, answered Lawyer Dowling, if your Worship bids me speak the Truth, I am sure I shall do the Truth.
-- Indeed, Mr. Allworthy, I did know the Truth; for they were almost the last Words which Mr. Blifil ever spoke, which Mr. Blifil mentioned to Mr. Allworthy as I stood alone by Mr. Blifil Bedside, when Mr. Blifil delivered me the Letter I brought your Worship from Mr.
Blifil.'
-- 'What the Letter, cries Allworthy?'
' -- 'The Letter, Sir, answered Dowling, which I brought from Salisbury, and which I delivered into the Hands of Mr.
Blifil.'
-- ' 'O Heavens!'
cries Allworthy, 'well, and what were the Words?
What did my Sister say to Dowling, which I brought from Salisbury, and which I delivered into the Hands of Mr.
Blifil?'
-- 'my Sister took me by the Hand, answered he, and as my Sister delivered me the Letter, said, I scarce know what I have written.
Tell my Brother, Mr. Jones is Mr. Jones Nephew -- his Nephew is my Son -- Bless my Son, says my Sister, and then fell backward, as if dying away.
I presently called in the People, and my Sister never spoke more to Mr. Allworthy, and died within a few Minutes afterward.'
-- Allworthy stood a Minute silent, lifting up Allworthy Eyes, and then turning to Lawyer Dowling, said, -- 'How came you, Mr. Allworthy, not to deliver me this Message?'
'your Worship, answered Allworthy, must remember that you was at that Time ill in Bed; and being in a violent Hurry, as indeed I always am, I delivered the Letter and Message to Mr. Blifil, who told me Allworthy would carry them both to you, which Allworthy has since told me Allworthy did, and that your Worship, partly out of Friendship to Mr. Jones, and partly out of Regard to your Sister, would never have it mentioned; and did intend to conceal it from the World; and therefore, Mr. Allworthy, if you had not mentioned it to Mr. Allworthy first, I am certain I should never have thought it belonged to Mr. Allworthy to say any Thing of the Matter, either to your Worship, or any other Person.'
We have remarked somewhere already, that it is possible for a Man to convey a Lie in the Words of Truth; this was the Case at present: For Mr. Blifil, had in Fact told Dowling what Allworthy now related; but had not imposed upon Allworthy, nor indeed had imagined that Allworthy was able so to do.
In Reality, the Promises which Mr. Blifil had made to Lawyer Dowling, were the Motives which had induced Allworthy to Secrecy; and as Allworthy very plainly saw Allworthy should not be able to keep them, Allworthy thought proper now to make this Confession, which the Promises of Forgiveness, joined to the Threats, the Voice, the Looks of Allworthy, and the Discoveries Allworthy had made before, extorted from Allworthy, who was besides taken unawares, and had no Time to consider of Evasions.
Allworthy appeared well satisfied with this Relation, and having enjoined strict Silence as to what had past on Lawyer Dowling, conducted that Gentleman himself to the Door, least Allworthy should see Blifil, who was returned to Allworthy Chamber, where Allworthy exulted in the Thoughts of Allworthy last Deceit on Allworthy Uncle, and little suspected what had since passed below Stairs.
As Allworthy was returning to Allworthy Room, Allworthy met Mrs. Miller in the Entry, who with a Face all pale and full of Terror, said to Allworthy, 'O!
Mr. Allworthy, I find this wicked Woman has been with Allworthy, and you know all; yet do not on this Account abandon Allworthy.
Consider, Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Allworthy was ignorant it was Mr. Allworthy own Mother, and the Discovery itself will most probably break Mr. Allworthy Heart, without your Unkindness.'
'Madam, says Allworthy, I am under such an Astonishment at what I have heard, that I am really unable to satisfy you; but come with Mr. Allworthy into my Room.
Indeed, Mrs. Miller, I have made surprising Discoveries, and you shall soon know surprising Discoveries.'
this wicked Woman followed Mr. Allworthy trembling; and now Allworthy going up to Mrs.
Waters, took this wicked Woman by the Hand, and then turning to Mrs. Miller said, 'What Reward shall I bestow upon this poor Gentlewoman for the Services this wicked Woman has done me?
-- O!
Mrs. Miller, you have a Thousand Times heard me call the young Man to whom you are so faithful a Friend, my Son.
Little did I then think Mr. Allworthy was indeed related to Mr. Allworthy at all.
-- Your Friend, Madam, is my Nephew, Mr. Allworthy is the Brother of that wicked Viper which I so long nourished in my Bosom.
-- this wicked Woman will this wicked Woman tell you the whole Story, and how the Youth came to pass for this wicked Woman Son.
Indeed, Mrs. Miller, I am convinced that Mrs. Miller has been wronged, and that I have been abused, abused by one whom you too justly suspected of being a Villain.
Mrs. Miller is, in Truth, the worst of Villains.'
The Joy which Mrs. Miller now felt, bereft Mrs. Miller of the Power of Speech, and might perhaps have deprived Mrs. Miller of Mrs. Miller Senses, if not of Life, had not a friendly Shower of Tears come seasonably to Mrs. Miller Relief.
At length recovering so far from Mrs. Miller Transport as to be able to speak, Mrs. Miller cried, 'And is my dear Mr. Jones then his Nephew there?
and not the Son of this Lady?
and are your his Eyes opened to your Eyes at last?
and shall I live to see your Eyes as happy as your Eyes deserves?'
'your Eyes certainly is my Nephew, says Allworthy, and I hope all the rest.'
-- 'And is this the dear, good Woman, the Person, cries Mrs. Miller, to whom all this Discovery is owing!'
-- 'Mrs.
Miller is indeed, says Allworthy."
-- 'Why then, cried Mrs. Miller, upon Mrs. Miller Knees, may Heaven shower down its choicest Blessings upon Mrs. Miller Head, and for this one good Action, forgive Mrs. Miller all Mrs. Miller Sins be they never so many.'
Mrs.
Waters then informed they, that Mrs.
Waters believed Mr. Jones would very shortly be released; for that the Surgeon was gone, in Company with a Nobleman, to the Justice who committed the Surgeon, in order to certify that Mr. Fitzpatrick was out of all Manner of Danger, and to procure the Prisoner Mr. Fitzpatrick Liberty.
Allworthy said, Allworthy should be glad to find Allworthy Nephew there at Allworthy Return home; but that Allworthy was then obliged to go on some Business of Consequence.
Allworthy than called to a Servant to fetch Servant a Chair, and presently left the two Ladies together.
Mr. Blifil ordered, came down Stairs to attend upon his Uncle, for Mr. Blifil never was deficient in such Acts of Duty.
Mr. Blifil asked his Uncle his Uncle if Mr. Blifil was going out, which is a civil Way of asking a Man where Mr. Blifil is going; to which the other making no Answer, Mr. Blifil again desired to know when Mr. Blifil would be pleased to return.
-- Allworthy made no Answer to this neither, till Mr. Blifil was just getting into Mr. Blifil Chair, and then turning about Mr. Blifil said -- 'Harkee, Mr. Allworthy, do you find out, before my Return, the Letter which his own Mother sent me on his own Mother Deathbed.'
Allworthy then departed, and left Mr. Blifil in a Situation to be envied only by a Man who is just going to be hanged.
CHAP.
IX.
A further Continuation.
Allworthy took an Opportunity whilst Allworthy was in the Chair of reading the Letter from Mr. Jones to Sophia, which Western delivered Allworthy; and there were some Expressions in it concerning Allworthy, which drew Tears from his Eyes.
At length Allworthy arrived at Mr. Western's, and was introduced to Sophia.
When the first Ceremonies were past, and the Gentleman and this Lady had taken the Gentleman and Lady Chairs, a Silence of some Minutes ensued; during which, the latter, who had been prepared for the Visit by this Lady Father, sat playing with this Lady Fan, and had every Mark of Confusion both in this Lady Countenance and Behavior.
At length Allworthy, who was himself a little disconcerted, began thus; 'I am afraid, Miss Western, my Family has been the Occasion of giving you some Uneasiness; to which, I fear, I have innocently become more instrumental than I intended.
Be assured, this Lady, had I at first known how disagreeable the Proposals had been, I should not have suffered you to have been so long persecuted.
I hope therefore you will not think the Design of the Visit is to trouble you with any further Solicitations of that Kind, but entirely to relieve you from Solicitations.'
'Mr.
Allworthy, said Sophia, with a little modest Hesitation, this Behavior is most kind and generous, and such as I could expect only from Allworthy: But as you have been so kind to mention this Matter, you will pardon me for saying, it has indeed given me great Uneasiness, and has been the Occasion of my suffering much cruel Treatment from a Father, who was, 'till that unhappy Affair, the tenderest and fondest of all Parents.
I am convinced, Mr. Allworthy, you are too good and generous to resent his Nephew therehis Nephew there.
Our own Inclinations are not in Our Power; and whatever may be his Nephew there Merit, I cannot force Our own Inclinations in his Nephew there Favor.'
'I assure you, most amiable young Lady.'
said Allworthy, 'I am capable of no such Resentment, had the Person been my own Son, and had I entertained the highest Esteem for Son.
For you say truly, this Lady, we cannot force we , much less can Our own Inclinations be directed by another.'
'Oh!
Mr. Allworthy,' answered Sophia, 'every Word you speak proves you to deserve that good, that great, that Benevolent Character the whole World allows you.
I assure you, Mr. Allworthy, nothing less than the certain Prospect of future Misery could have made me resist the Commands of her Father.'
'I sincerely believe you this Lady,Allworthy, 'and I heartily congratulate you on your prudent Foresight, since by so justifiable a Resistance you have avoided Misery indeed.'
'You speak now, Allworthy, cries Sophia, 'with a Delicacy which few Men are capable of feeling: but surely in my Opinion, to lead our Lives with one to whom our are indifferent, must be a State of Wretchedness -- perhaps that Wretchedness would be even increased by a Sense of the Merits of an Object to whom our cannot give our Affections.
If I had married Mr. Blifil -- ' 'Pardon my interrupting you, Madam, answered Allworthy, 'but I cannot bear the Supposition.
-- Believe me, Miss Western, I rejoice from my Heart, I rejoice in your Escape.
-- I have discovered the Wretch, for whom you have suffered all this cruel Violence from her Father, to be a Villain.'
'How, Mr.
Allworthy!'
cries Sophia, -- 'you must believe this surprises me.'
-- 'It has surprised me, this Lady,' answered Allworthy, and so It will the World.
-- But I have acquainted you with the real Truth.'
'Nothing but the real Truth,' says Sophia, 'can, I am convinced, come from the Lips of Allworthy.
-- Yet, Mr. Allworthy, such sudden, such unexpected News -- Discovered, you say -- may Villainy be ever so.'
-- 'You will soon enough hear the whole Story,' cries Allworthy, -- 'at present let us not mention so detested a Name -- I have another Matter of a very serious Nature to propose.
-- O!
Miss Western, I know your vast Worth, nor can I so easily part with the Ambition of being allied to it.
-- I have a near Relation, Madam, a young Man whose Character is, I am convinced, the very opposite to that of this Wretch, and whose Fortune I will make equal to what whose Fortune was to have been.
-- Could I, Madam, hope you would admit a Visit from whose Fortune?'
Sophia after a Minute's Silence, answered, 'I will deal with the utmost Sincerity with Allworthy.
Allworthy Character, and the Obligation I have just received from Allworthy demand it.
I have determined at present to listen to no such Proposals from any Person.
My only desire is to be restored to the Affection of her Father, and to be again the Mistress of the Affection of my Father .
This, Mr. Allworthy, I hope to owe to your good Offices.
Let me beseech you, let me conjure you by all the Goodness, which I, and all who know you, have experienced; do not the very Moment when you have released me from one Persecution, do not engage me in another, as miserable and as fruitless.'
'Indeed, Miss Western,' replied Allworthy, 'I am capable of no such Conduct; and if this be your Resolution, he must submit to the Disappointment, whatever Torments he may suffer under it.'
'I must smile now, Allworthy,' answered Sophia, 'when you mention the Torments of a Man whom I do not know, and who can consequently have so little Acquaintance with Allworthy.'
'Pardon me, dear young Lady,' cries Allworthy, 'I begin now to be afraid he has had too much Acquaintance for the Repose of he future Days; since, if ever Man was capable of a sincere, violent and noble Passion, such, I am convinced, is my unhappy Nephew's for Miss Western.'
'A Nephew of A Nephew!
Allworthy,' answered Sophia.
'It is surely strange, I never heard of Allworthy before.'
'Indeed!
Madam,' cries Allworthy, 'it is only the Circumstance of Allworthy being my Nephew to which you are a Stranger, and which, 'till this Day, was a Secret to me.
-- Mr. Jones, who has long loved you, he!
-- Mr. Jones, who has long loved you, he is A Nephew of yours.'
-- 'Mr.
Jones your Nephew, Sir?'
cries Sophia, 'Can it be possible?
-- 'Allworthy is indeed, Madam, answered Allworthy: Allworthy is my own Sister's Son -- as such I shall always own Allworthy; nor am I ashamed of owning Allworthy.
I am much more ashamed of my past Behavior to Allworthy; but I was as ignorant of his Merit as of Allworthy Birth.
Indeed, Miss Western, I have used Allworthy cruelly -- Indeed I have.'
-- Here Allworthy wiped his Eyes, and after a short Pause proceeded -- 'I never shall be able to reward Allworthy for Allworthy Sufferings without your Assistance.
-- Believe me, most amiable young Lady, I must have a great Esteem of that Offering which I make to your Worth.
I know Allworthy has been guilty of Faults; but there is great Goodness of Heart at the Bottom.
Believe me, Madam, there is.'
-- Here Allworthy stopped, seeming to expect an Answer, which Allworthy presently received from Sophia, after Sophia had a little recovered Sophia from the Hurry of Spirits into which so strange and sudden Information had thrown Sophia: 'I sincerely wish you Joy, Sir, of a Discovery in which you seem to have such Satisfaction.
I Doubt not but you will have all the Comfort you can promise yourself from it.
The young Gentleman has certainly a thousand good Qualities, which makes it impossible The young Gentleman should not behave well to such an his Uncle.'
-- 'I hope, Madam,' said Allworthy, Allworthy has those good Qualities which must make Allworthy a good Husband.
-- Allworthy must I am sure, be of all Men the most abandoned, if a Lady of his Merit should condescend' -- 'You must pardon me, Allworthy,' answered Sophia, 'I cannot listen to a Proposal of this Kind.
Mr. Jones, I am convinced, has his Merithis Merit; but I shall never receive Mr. Jones as one who is to be my Husband -- Upon the Honor I never will.'
-- 'Pardon me Madam,' cries Allworthy, 'if I am a little surprised after what I have heard from Mr. Western -- I hope Allworthy has done nothing to forfeit your good Opinion, if Allworthy had ever the Honor to enjoy it.
-- Perhaps Allworthy may have been misrepresented to you, as Allworthy was to me.
The same Villainy may have injured The same Villainy every where.
-- The same Villainy is no Murderer, I assure you, as The same Villainy has been called.'
-- 'Allworthy, answered Sophia, I have told you my Resolution.
I wonder not at what her Father has told you; but whatever her Father Apprehensions or Fears have been, if I know my Heart, I have given no Occasion for his Apprehensions or Fears; since no Occasion for them has always been a fixed Principle with me, never to have married without her Father Consent.
This is, I think, the Duty of a Child to a Parent; and this, I hope, nothing could ever have prevailed with me to swerve from.
I do not indeed conceive, that the Authority of any Parent can oblige us to marry, in direct Opposition to our Inclinations.
To avoid a Force of this Kind, which I had Reason to suspect, I left her Father's House, and sought Protection elsewhere.
This is the Truth of my Story; and if the World, or her Father, carry my Intentions any farther, my own Conscience will acquit me.'
'I hear you, Miss Western,' cries Allworthy with Admiration.
'I admire the Justness of your Sentiments; but surely there is more in this.
I am cautious of offending you, young Lady; but am I to look on all which I have hitherto heard or seen, as a Dream only?
And have you suffered so much Cruelty from her Father on the Account of a Man to whom you have been always absolutely indifferent?'
'I beg, Allworthy,' answered Sophia, 'you will not insist on my Reasons; -- Yes I have suffered indeed: I will not, Mr. Allworthy, conceal -- I will be very sincere with Sophia -- I own I had a great Opinion of Mr. Jones -- I believe -- I know I have suffered for my Opinion -- I have been treated cruelly by my Aunt, as well as by her Father; but that is now past -- I beg I may not be farther pressed; for whatever has been, my Resolution is now fixed.
Your Nephew, Sir, has many Virtues -- Your Nephew, Sir has great Virtues, Mr. Allworthy.
I question not but Your Nephew, Sir will do you Honor in the World, and make you happy.'
-- 'I wish I could make Your Nephew, Sir so, Madam,' replied Allworthy; 'but that I am convinced is only in your Power.
It is that Conviction which has made me so earnest a Solicitor in a Solicitor Favor.'
'You are deceived; indeed, Mr. Allworthy, you are deceived,' said Sophia -- 'I hope not by Mr. Allworthy -- It is sufficient to have deceived me.
Allworthy, I must insist on being pressed no farther upon this Subject.
-- I should be sorry -- Nay, I will not injure Allworthy in your Favor.
I wish Mr. Jones very well.
I sincerely wish Mr. Jones well; and I ^^peat again to you, whatever Demerit Mr. Jones may have to me, I am certain Mr. Jones has many good Qualities.
I do not disown my former Thoughts; but nothing can ever recall nothing.
At present there is not a Man on Earth whom I would more resolutely reject than Mr. Jones; nor would the Addresses of Mr. Blifil himself be less agreeable to me.'
Western had been long impatient for the Event of this Conference, and was just now arrived at the Door to listen; when having heard the last Sentiments of Mr. Blifil himself Daughter's Heart, Mr. Blifil himself lost all Temper, and bursting open the Door in a Rage, cried out, -- 'It is a Lie.
It is a d -- n'd Lie.
It is all owing to that d -- n'd Rascal Juones; and if she could get at un, she would ha un any Hour of the Day.'
Here Allworthy interposed, and addressing Allworthy to the Squire with some Anger in Allworthy Look, Allworthy said, 'Mr.
Western, you have not kept your Word with Allworthy.
You promised to abstain from all Violence.'
-- 'Why so I did,' cries Western, 'as long as it was possible; but to hear a Wench telling such confounded Lies.
-- Zounds!
Does she think if she can make Vools of other Volk, she can make one of she?
-- No, no, I know she better than thee do.'
'I am sorry to tell you, Mr. Allworthy,' answered Allworthy, Allworthy does not appear by your Behavior to she, that you know she at all.
I ask Pardon for what I say; but I think our Intimacy, your own Desires, and the Occasion justify me.
she is your Daughter, Mr. Western, and I think she does the Honor to your Name.
If I was capable of Envy, I should sooner envy you on this Account, than any other Man whatever.'
-- 'Od-rabbit-it,' cries the Squire, 'I wish she was thine with all my Heart -- would soon be glad to be rid of the Trouble of she.'
-- 'Indeed, my good Friend,' answered Allworthy, 'you yourself are the Cause of all the Trouble you complain of.
Place that Confidence in she which she so well deserves, and I am certain you will be the happiest Father on Earth.'
-- 'I Confidence in she!'
cries the Squire.
''Sblood!'
what Confidence can I place in she, when she will not do as I would ha she?
Let she gi but she Consent to marry as I would ha her, and I Will place as much Confidence in she as would ha me.'
-- 'You have no Right, she,' answered Allworthy, 'to insist on any such Consent.
A negative Voice his Daughter allows you, and God and Nature have thought proper to allow you no more.'
'A negative Voice?'
cries the Squire, -- Ay!
ay!
I Will show you what a negative Voice I ha.
-- Go along, go into your Chamber, go, you Stubborn -- 'Indeed, Mr. Western,' said Allworthy, -- 'Indeed, you use his Daughter cruelly -- I cannot bear to see this -- You shall, you must behave to his Daughter in a kinder Manner.
his Daughter deserves the best of Treatment.'
'Yes, yes,' said the Squire, I know what his Daughter deserves: Now his Daughter is gone, I Will show you what his Daughter deserves -- See here, Mr. Allworthy, here is a Letter from my Cousin, my Lady Bellaston, in which his Daughter is so kind to gi me to understand, that the Fellow is got out of Prison again; and here his Daughter advises me to take all the Care I can of a Wench.
Odzookers!
Allworthy, you don't know what it is to govern a his Daughter.'
the Squire ended the Squire Speech with some Compliments to the Squire own Sagacity; and then Allworthy, after a formal Preface, acquainted the Squire with the whole Discovery which the Squire had made concerning Jones, with the Squire Anger to Blifil, and with every Particular which has been disclosed to the Reader in the preceding Chapters.
Men over-violent in their Dispositions, are, for the most Part, as changeable in Men over-violent in their Dispositions.
No sooner then was Western informed of Allworthy's Intention to make Jones Allworthy Heir, than Allworthy joined heartily with the Uncle in every Commendation of the Nephew, and became as eager for the Uncle Marriage with Mr. Jones, as Allworthy had before been to couple the Uncle to Blifil.
Here Allworthy was again forced to interpose, and to relate what had passed between Allworthy and Sophia, at which Allworthy testified great Surprise.
the Squire the Squire was silent a Moment, and looked wild with Astonishment at this Account -- At last the Squire cried out, 'Why what can be the Meaning of this, Neighbor Allworthy?
Vond o un The Girl was, that I Will be sworn to.
-- Odzookers!
I have hit o't.
As sure as a Gun I have hit o the very right o't.
It Is all long o Zister.
The Girl has got a Hankering after the Squire of a whore of a Lord.
I vound 'em together at my Cousin, my Lady Bellaston's.
this Son of a whore of a Lord has turned the Head of The Girl that is certain -- but d -- n me if this Son of a whore of a Lord shall ha The Girl -- I Will ha no Lords nor Courtiers in my Vamily.'
Allworthy now made a long Speech, in which Allworthy repeated Allworthy Resolution to avoid all violent Measures, and very earnestly recommended gentle Methods to Mr. Western, as those by which Allworthy might be assured of succeeding best with his Daughter.
Allworthy then took Allworthy Leave, and returned back to Mrs. Miller, but was forced to comply with the earnest Entreaties of the Squire, in promising to bring Mr. Jones to visit Mr. Jones that Afternoon, 'that Mr. Jones might,' as Mr. Jones said, 'make all Matters up with the young Gentleman.'
At Allworthy's Departure, Western promised to follow Allworthy Advice in Allworthy Behavior to Sophia, saying, 'I don't know how it is, but d -- n me, Allworthy, if you don't make me always do just as you please, and yet I have as good an Esteate as you, and am in the Commission of the Peace as well as you.'
CHAP.
X. Wherein the History begins to draw toward a Conclusion.
WHEN Allworthy returned to Allworthy Lodgings, Allworthy heard Mr. Jones was just arrived before Mr. Jones.
Allworthy hurried therefore instantly into an empty Chamber, whither Allworthy ordered Mr. Jones to be brought to Mr. Jones alone.
It is impossible to conceive a more tender or moving Scene, than the Meeting between the Uncle and Nephew, (for Mrs.
Waters, as the Reader may well suppose, had at Mrs.
Waters last Visit discovered to Allworthy the Secret of Allworthy Birth).
The first Agonies of Joy which were felt on both Sides, are indeed beyond my Power to describe: I shall not therefore attempt my Power.
After Allworthy had raised Mr. Jones from Allworthy Feet, where Allworthy had prostrated Allworthy, and received Allworthy into Allworthy Arms, 'O my Child,' Allworthy cried, 'how have I been to blame!
How have I injured you!
What Amends can I ever make you for those unkind, those unjust Suspicions which I have entertained; and for all the Sufferings those unkind have occasioned to you?'
'Am I not made Amends?'
cries Mr. Jones, 'Would not my Sufferings, if they had been ten Times greater, have been now richly repaid?
O my dear Uncle!
this Goodness, this Tenderness over-powers, unmans, destroys me.
I cannot bear the Transports which slow so fast upon me.
To be again restored to your Presence, to your Favor; to be once more thus kindly received by my great, my noble, my generous Benefactor, -- 'Indeed, Child,' cries Allworthy,' I have used you cruelly.'
-- Allworthy then explained to Allworthy all the Treachery of Blifil, and again repeated Expressions of the utmost Concern, for having been induced by that Treachery to use Treachery so ill. 'O talk not so,' answered Mr. Jones;' 'Indeed Sir, you have used me nobly.
The wisest Man might be deceived as you were, and, under such a Deception, the best must have acted just as you did.
Your Goodness displayed itself in the Midst of your Anger, just as it then seemed.
I owe every thing to that Goodness of which I have been most unworthy.
Do not put me on Self-accusation, by carrying your generous Sentiments too far.
Alas, Mr. Allworthy, I have not been punished more than I have deserved; and it shall be the whole Business of my furture Life to deserve that Happiness you now bestow on me; for believe me, my dear Uncle, my Punishment has not been thrown away upon me.
Though I have been a great, I am not a hardened Sinner; I thank Heaven I have had Time to reflect on my past Life, where though I cannot charge me with any gross Villainy, yet I can discern Follies and Vices too sufficient to repent and to be ashamed of; Follies which have been attended with dreadful Consequences to me, and have brought me to the Brink of Destruction.'
'I am rejoiced, my dear Child,' answered Allworthy, to hear you talk thus sensibly; for as I am convinced Hypocrisy (good Heaven how have I been imposed on by it in others!)
was never among your Faults, so I can readily believe all you say.
You now see, Tom, to what Dangers Imprudence alone may subject Virtue (for Virtue, I am now convinced, you love in a great Degree).
Prudence is indeed the Duty which we owe to we; and if we will be so much we own Enemies as to neglect it, we are not to wonder if the World is deficient in discharging their Duty to we; for when a Man lays the Foundation of a Man own Ruin, others will, I am afraid, be too apt to build upon it.
You say, however you have seen your Errors; and will reform your Errors.
I firmly believe you, my dear Child; and therefore, from this Moment, you shall never more be reminded of your Errors by me.
Remember your Errors only yourself so far, as for the future to teach you the better to avoid your Errors; but still remember, for your Comfort, that there is this great Difference between those Faults which Candor may construe into Imprudence, and those which can be deduced from Villainy only.
The former, perhaps, are even more liable to subject a Man to Ruin; but if a Man to Ruin reform, a Man to Ruin will, at length, be totally retrieved; the World, though not immediately, will, in Time, be reconciled to a Man to Ruin; and a Man to Ruin may reflect, not without some Mixture of Pleasure, on the Dangers a Man to Ruin has escaped: But Villainy, my Boy, when once discovered, is irretrievable; the Stains which this leaves behind, no Time will wash away.
The Censure of Mankind will pursue the Wretch, their Scorn will abash a Man to Ruin in Public, and if Shame drives a Man to Ruin into Retirement, a Man to Ruin will go to it with all those Terrors with which a weary Child, who is afraid of Hobgoblins, retreats from Company to go to Bed alone.
Here a Man to Ruin murdered Conscience will haunt his murdered Conscience.
Repose, like a false Friend, will fly from his murdered Conscience.
Wherever his murdered Conscience turns his murdered Conscience Eyes, Horror presents itself; if his murdered Conscience looks backward, unavailable Repentance treads on his murdered Conscience Heels; if forward, incurable Despair stares his murdered Conscience in the Face; till, like a condemned Prisoner, confined in a Dungeon, his murdered Conscience detests his murdered Conscience present Condition, and yet dreads the Consequence of that Hour which is to relieve his murdered Conscience from it.
Comfort yourself, I say, my Child, that this is not your Case; and rejoice, with Thankfulness to his murdered Conscience who has suffered you to see your Errors, before they have brought on you that Destruction to which a Persistance in even those Errors must have led you.
You have deserted they, and the Prospect now before you is such, that Happiness seems in your own Power.'
-- At Mr. Jones fetched a deep Sigh; upon which, when Allworthy remonstrated, Allworthy said, 'Mr.
Allworthy, I will conceal nothing from Mr. Allworthy: I fear there is one Consequence of my Vices I shall never be able to retrieve.
O my dear Uncle, I have lost a Treasure.'
-- 'You need say no more,' answered Allworthy; 'I will be explicit with Allworthy; I know what you lament; I have seen the young Lady, and have discoursed with the young Lady concerning you.
This I must insist on, as an Earnest of your Sincerity in all you have said, and of the Stedfastness of your Resolution, that you obey me in one Instance.
To abide entirely by the Determination of the young Lady, whether it shall be in your Favor, or no.
the young Lady has already suffered enough from Solicitations which I hate to think of; the young Lady shall owe no further Constraint to my Family: I know the young Lady Father will be as ready to torment the young Lady now on your Account, as her Father has formerly been on another; but I am determined the young Lady shall suffer no more Confinement, no more Violence, no more uneasy Hours.'
-- 'O my dear Uncle', answered Mr. Jones, 'lay, I beseech you, some Command on -- 'O my dear Uncle', in which I shall have some Merit in Obedience.
Believe me, Sir, the only Instance in which I could disobey you, would be to give an uneasy Moment to Sophia.
No, Mr. Allworthy, if I am so miserable to have incurred Sophia Displeasure beyond all Hope of Forgiveness, that alone, with the dreadful Reflection of causing the young Lady Misery, will be sufficient to overpower me.
To call Sophia mine is the greatest, and now the only additional Blessing which Heaven can bestow; but it is a Blessing which I must owe to Sophia mine alone.'
'I will not flatter you, Child,' cries Allworthy; I fear your Case is desperate: I never saw stronger Marks of an unalterable Resolution in any Person, than appeared in Sophia mine vehement Declarations against receiving your Addresses; for which, perhaps, you can account better than Sophia.'
-- 'Oh, Mr. Allworthy!
I can account too well,' answered Mr. Jones; 'I have sinned against Mr. Jones beyond all Hope of Pardon; and, guilty as I am, my Guilt unfortunately appears to Mr. Jones in ten Times blacker than the real Colors.
O my dear Uncle, I find my Follies are irretrievable; and all your Goodness cannot save me from Perdition.'
A Servant now acquainted them, that Mr. Western was below Stairs; for A Servant Eagerness to see Mr. Jones could not wait till the Afternoon.
Upon which Jones, whose Eyes were full of Tears, begged A Servant to entertain Western a few Minutes, till -- 'O my dear Uncle' a little recovered -- 'O my dear Uncle': To which the good Man consented, and having ordered Mr. Western to be shown into a Parlour, went down to -- 'O my dear Uncle'.
Mrs. Miller no sooner heard, that Mr. Jones was alone (for Mrs. Miller had not yet seen Mr. Jones since Mr. Jones Release from Prison,) than Mrs. Miller came eagerly into the Room, and, advancing toward Mr. Jones, wished Mr. Jones heartily Joy of -- 'O my dear Uncle', and Mr. Jones happy Reconciliation; adding, 'I wish I could give you Joy on another Account, my dear Child; but any thing so inexorable I never saw.'
Mr. Jones, with some Appearance of Surprise, asked Mrs. Miller, what Mrs. Miller meant.
'Why then,' says Mrs. Miller, 'I have been with the young Lady, and have explained all Matters to Mrs. Miller, as they were told me by my Son Nightingale.
Mrs. Miller can have no longer any Doubt about the Letter, that I am certain; for I told Mrs. Miller my Son Nightingale was ready to take Son Nightingale Oath, if Mrs. Miller pleased, that it was all Son Nightingale own Invention, and the Letter of Son Nightingale inditing.
I told Mrs. Miller the very Reason of sending the Letter ought to recommend you to Mrs. Miller the more, as it was all upon Mrs. Miller Account, and a plain Proof, that you was resolved to quit all your Profligacy for the future; that you had never been guilty of a single Instance of Infidelity to Infidelity since your seeing Infidelity in Town.
I am afraid I went too far there; but Heaven forgive me: I hope your future Behavior will be my Justification.
I am sure I have said all I can; but all to no Purpose.
Infidelity remains inflexible.
Infidelity says, Infidelity had forgiven many Faults on account of Youth; but expressed such Detestation of the Character of a Libertine, that Infidelity absolutely silenced me.
I often attempted to excuse you; but the Justness of Infidelity Accusation flew in my Face.
Upon my Honor Infidelity is a lovely Woman, and one of the sweetest and most sensible Creatures I ever saw.
I could have almost kissed Infidelity for one Expression Infidelity made use of.
It was a Sentiment worthy of Seneca, or of a Bishop.'
"I once fancied, Infidelity,' said Infidelity, "I had discovered great Goodness of Heart in Mr. Jones; and for that I own I had a sincere Esteem; but an entire Profligacy of Manners will corrupt the best Heart in the World; and all which a good-natured Libertine can expect is, that we should mix some Grains of Pity with we Contempt and Abhorrence."
'Infidelity is an angelic Creature, that is the Truth on it.'
-- 'O Mrs. Miller, answered Mr. Jones, can I bear to think I have lost such an Angel.
-- 'Lost!
No,' cries 'O Mrs. Miller;' 'I hope you have not lost Infidelity yet.
Resolve to leave such vicious Courses, and you may yet have Hopes: Nay, if Infidelity should remain inexorable, there is another young Lady, a sweet pretty young Lady, and a swinging Fortune, who is absolutely dying for Love of you.
I heard of it this very Morning, and I told it to Miss Western; nay, I went a little beyond the Truth again; for I told Infidelity you had refused Infidelity; but indeed I knew you would refuse Infidelity.
-- And here I must give you a little Comfort: When I mentioned the young Lady's Name, who is no other than the pretty Widow Hunt, I thought Infidelity turned pale; but when I said you had refused Infidelity, I will be sworn Infidelity my Face was all over Scarlet in an Instant; and these were Infidelity very Words,' "I will not deny but that I believe he has some Affection for me.'
Here the Conversation was interrupted by the Arrival of Western, who could no longer be kept out of the Room even by the Authority of Allworthy, himself; though this, as we have often seen, had a wonderful Power over he.
Western immediately went up to Mr. Jones, crying out, 'My old Friend Tom, I am glad to see My old Friend Tom with all my Heart.
All past must be forgotten.
I could not intend any Affront to My old Friend Tom, because, as Allworthy here knows, nay, do know it thyself, I took My old Friend Tom for another Person; and where a Body means no Harm, what signifies a hasty Word or two; one Christian must forget and forgive another.'
'I hope, Mr. Allworthy, said Mr. Jones, 'I shall never forget the many Obligations I have had to Mr. Jones; but as for any Offense toward me, I declare I am an utter Stranger.'
-- 'A't,' says Western,' then give me thy Fist, a't as hearty an honest Cock as any in the Kingdom.
Come along with me; I Will carry thee to thee Mistress this Moment.'
Here Allworthy interposed; and the Squire being unable to prevail either with the Uncle or Nephew, was, after some Litigation, obliged to consent to delay introducing Mr. Jones to Sophia till the Afternoon; at which Time Allworthy, as well in Compassion to Mr. Jones, as in Compliance with the eager Desires of Western, was prevailed upon to promise to attend at the Tea-table.
The Conversation which now ensued was pleasant enough; and with which, had The Conversation which now ensued happened earlier in our History, our would have entertained our Reader; but as our have now Leisure only to attend to what is very material, our Reader shall suffice to say, that Matters being entirely adjusted as to the Afternoon-Visit, Mr. Western again returned home.

our History draws nearer to a Conclusion.
WHEN Mr. Western was departed, Mr. Jones began to inform Mr. Allworthy and Mrs. Miller, that Mr. Jones Liberty had been procured by two noble Lords, who, together with two Surgeons, and a Friend of my Son Nightingale's, had attended the Magistrate by whom Mr. Jones had been committed, and by whom, on the Surgeons Oaths that the wounded Person was out of all Manner of Danger from this Wound, the wounded Person was discharged.
One only of these Lords, the wounded Person said, the wounded Person had ever seen before, and that no more than once; but the other had greatly surprised the wounded Person, by asking the wounded Person Pardon for an Offense the wounded Person had been guilty of toward the wounded Person, occasioned, the wounded Person said, entirely by the wounded Person Ignorance who the wounded Person was.
Now the Reality of the Case with which Mr. Jones was not acquainted till afterward, was this.
The Lieutenant whom Lord Fellamar had employed, according to the Advice of Lady Bellaston, to press Mr. Jones, as a Vagabond, into the Sea Service, when he came to report the Event which we have before seen to he Lordship, spoke very favorably of the Behavior of Mr. Jones on all Accounts, and strongly assured that Lord, that Mr. Jones must have mistaken the Person, for that Mr. Jones was certainly a Gentleman, insomuch that his Lordship, who was strictly a Man of Honor, and would by no Means have been guilty of an Action which the World in general would have condemned, began to be much concerned for the Advice which Mr. Jones had taken.
Within a Day or two after this, Lord Fellamar happened to dine with the Irish Peer, who, in a Conversation upon the Duel, acquainted Lord Fellamar Company with the Character of Fitzpatrick; to which indeed Lord Fellamar did not do strict Justice, especially in what related to Lord Fellamar .
Lord Fellamar said, the young Lady was the most innocent, and most injured Woman alive, and that from Compassion alone Lord Fellamar had undertaken the young Lady Cause.
Lord Fellamar then declared an Intention of going the next Morning to Fitzpatrick's Lodgings, in order to prevail with Lord Fellamar, if possibly, to consent to a Separation from Lord Fellamar Wife, who, the Peer said, was in Apprehensions for the young Lady Life, if the young Lady should ever return to be under the Power of the young Lady Husband.
Lord Fellamar agreed to go with Lord Fellamar, that Lord Fellamar might satisfy Lord Fellamar more concerning Mr. Jones, and the Circumstances of the Duel; for Lord Fellamar was by no Means easy concerning the Part Lord Fellamar had acted.
The Moment his Lordship gave a Hint of Lord Fellamar Readiness to assist in the Delivery of the young Lady, his Lordship was eagerly embraced by the other Nobleman, who depended much on the Authority of Lord Fellamar, as Lord Fellamar thought his Lordship would greatly contribute to awe Fitzpatrick into a Compliance; and perhaps Fitzpatrick was in the right; for the poor Irishman no sooner saw these noble Peers had undertaken the Cause of Fitzpatrick Wife, than Fitzpatrick submitted, and Articles of Separation were soon drawn up and signed between the Parties.
Fitzpatrick had been so well satisfied by Mrs.
Waters concerning the Innocence of his Wife with Jones at Upton, or perhaps from some other Reasons, was now become so indifferent to that Matter, that Fitzpatrick spoke highly in Favor of Mr. Jones, to Lord Fellamar, took all the Blame upon Lord Fellamar, and said the other had behaved very much like a Gentleman, and a Man of Honor; and upon that Lord's further Enquiry concerning Mr. Jones, Fitzpatrick told Fitzpatrick Fitzpatrick was Nephew to a Gentleman of very great Fashion and Fortune, which was the Account Fitzpatrick had just received from Mrs.
Waters, after his Wife Interview with Dowling.
Lord Fellamar now thought Lord Fellamar behoved Lord Fellamar to do every Thing in Lord Fellamar Power to make Satisfaction to a Gentleman whom Lord Fellamar had so grossly injured, and without any Consideration of Rivalship, (for Lord Fellamar had now given over all Thoughts of Sophia) determined to procure Mr. Jones's Liberty, being satisfied as well from Fitzpatrick as Fitzpatrick Surgeon, that the Wound was not mortal.
Lord Fellamar therefore prevailed with the Irish Peer to accompany Lord Fellamar to the Place where Mr. Jones was confined, to whom Lord Fellamar behaved as we have already related.
When Allworthy returned to Allworthy Lodgings, Allworthy immediately carried Mr. Jones into Allworthy Room, and then acquainted Allworthy with the whole Matter, as well what Allworthy had heard from Mrs.
Waters, as what Allworthy had discovered from Dowling.
Mr. Jones expressed great Astonishment, and no less Concern at this Account; but without making any Comment or Observation upon this Account.
And now a Message was brought from Mr. Blifil, desiring to know if Mr. Blifil Uncle was at Leisure, and Mr. Blifil might wait upon his Uncle.
Alworthy started and turned pale, and then in a more passionate Tone than, I believe, Alworthy had ever used before, bid his Uncle tell Mr. Blifil, Alworthy knew his Uncle not.
'Consider, Mr. Allworthy,' -- cries Mr. Jones in a trembling Voice.
-- 'I have considered, answered Allworthy, and you yourself shall carry a Message to the Villain.
-- No one can carry his Uncle the Sentence of his Uncle own Ruin so properly as the Man whose Ruin his Uncle has so villainously contrived.'
-- 'Pardon me, Mr. Allworthy, said Mr. Jones; a Moment's Reflection will, I am sure, convince you of the contrary.
What might be perhaps but Justice from another Tongue, would from mine be Insult; and to whom?
-- My own Brother, and your Nephew.
-- Nor did My own Brother, and your Nephew use me so barbarously.
-- Indeed that would have been more inexcuseable than any Thing My own Brother, and your Nephew has done.
Fortune may tempt Men of no very bad Dispositions to Injustice; but Insults proceed only from black and rancorous Minds, and have no Temptations to excuse only from black and rancorous Minds.
-- Let me beseech you, Mr. Allworthy, to do nothing by Mr. Allworthy in the present Height of your Anger.
Consider, his Uncle, I was not Mr. Allworthy condemned unheard.'
Allworthy stood silent a Moment, and then embracing Mr. Jones, Allworthy said, with Tears gushing from Allworthy Eyes, 'O my Child!
to what Goodness have I been so long blind!'
Mrs. Miller entering the Room at that Moment, after a gentle Rap, which was not perceived, and seeing Jones in the Arms of Mrs. Miller Uncle, the poor Woman, in an Agony of Joy, fell upon Mrs. Miller Knees, and burst forth into the most extatic Thanksgivings to Heaven, for what had happened.
-- Then running to Mr. Jones, Mrs. Miller embraced Mr. Jones eagerly, crying, 'My dearest Friend, I wish you Joy a Thousand and a Thousand Times of this blessed Day;' and Allworthy received the same Congratulations.
To which Mr. Jones answered, 'Indeed, indeed, Mrs. Miller, I am beyond Expression happy.'
Some few more Raptures being passed on all Sides, Mrs. Miller desired them both to walk down to Dinner in the Parlour, where Mrs. Miller said there were a very happy Set of People assembled; being indeed no other than Mr. Nightingale and Mrs. Miller Bride, and Mrs. Miller Cousin Harris with Cousin Harris Bridegroom.
Allworthy excused Allworthy from dining with the Company, saying Allworthy had ordered some little Thing for Allworthy and Allworthy Nephew in Allworthy own Apartment; for that him and his Nephew had much private Business to discourse of, but would not resist promising the good Woman, that both Allworthy and Mr. Jones would make Part of Mr. Jones Society at Supper.
Mrs. Miller then asked what was to be done with Mr. Blifil; 'for indeed, says Mrs. Miller, I cannot be easy while such a the Villain is in my House.
-- Allworthy answered, 'Allworthy was as uneasy as Mrs. Miller on this Account.'
'O, cries Mrs. Miller, if that be the Case, leave the Matter to Mrs. Miller; I Will soon show Allworthy the Outside of my Doors, I warrant you.
Here are two or three lusty Fellows below Stairs.'
'There will be no need of any Violence, AllworthyAllworthy, if you will carry Allworthy a Message from Mrs. Miller, Allworthy will, I am convinced, depart of Allworthy own Accord.'
'Will I?
said Mrs. Miller, I never did any Thing in my Life with a better Will.'
Here Mr. Jones interfered, and said, 'Mr.
Jones had considered the Matter better, and would, if Allworthy pleased, be Allworthy the Messenger.'
'I know, says Allworthy, already enough of your Pleasure, Sir, and I beg Leave to acquaint Allworthy with it by my own Words.
Let me beseech you, Mr. Allworthy, added Mr. Allworthy, to reflect on the dreadful Consequences of driving Mr. Allworthy to violent and sudden Despair.
How unfit, alas!
is this poor Man to die in this poor Man present Situation.'
This Suggestion had not the least Effect on Mrs. Miller.
Mrs. Miller left the Room crying, 'You are too good, Mr. Jones, infinitely too good to live in this World.'
But it made a deeper Impression on Allworthy.
'My good Child, said My good Child, I am equally astonished at the Goodness of your Heart, and the Quickness of your Understanding.
Heaven indeed forbid that this Wretch should be deprived of any Means or Time for Repentance.
That would be a shocking Consideration indeed.
Go to him therefore, and use your own Discretion; yet do not flatter him with any Hopes of my Forgiveness; for I shall never forgive Villainy farther than my Religion obliges me, and that extends not either to our Bounty or our Conversation.'
Mr. Jones went up to Mr. Blifil's Room, whom Mr. Jones found in a Situation which moved Mr. Jones Pity, though it would have raised a less amiable Passion in many Beholders.
Mr. Jones had cast Mr. Jones on Mr. Jones Bed, where Mr. Jones lay abandoning Mr. Jones to Despair, and drowned in Tears; not in such Tears as flow from Contrition, and wash away Guilt from Minds which have been seduced or surprised into it unawares, against the Bent of their natural Dispositions, as will sometimes happen from human Frailty, even to the Good: No, these Tears were such as the frighted Thief sheds in Mr. Jones Cart, and are indeed the Effects of that Concern which the most savage Natures are seldom deficient in feeling for the most savage Natures.
It would be unpleasant and tedious to paint this Scene in full Length.
Let it suffice to say, that the Behavior of Mr. Jones was kind to Excess.
the Behavior of Jones omitted nothing which the Behavior of Jones Invention could supply, to raise and comfort the drooping Spirits of Mr. Blifil, before the Behavior of Jones communicated to the Behavior of Jones the Resolution of the Behavior of Jones , that the Behavior of Jones must quit the House that Evening.
the Behavior of Jones offered to furnish the Behavior of Jones with any Money the Behavior of Jones wanted, assured the Behavior of Jones of the Behavior of Jones hearty Forgiveness of all the Behavior of Jones had done against the Behavior of Jones, that the Behavior of Jones would endeavor to live with the Behavior of Jones hereafter as a Brother, and would leave nothing unattempted to effectuate a Reconciliation with the Behavior of Jones .
Mr. Blifil was at first sullen and silent, balancing in Mr. Blifil Mind whether Mr. Blifil should yet deny all: But finding at last the Evidence too strong against Mr. Blifil, Mr. Blifil betook Mr. Blifil at last to confession.
Mr. Blifil then asked Pardon of Mr. Blifil Brother in the most vehement Manner, prostrated Mr. Blifil on the Ground, and kissed Mr. Blifil Feet: In short, Mr. Blifil was now as remarkably mean, as Mr. Blifil had been before remarkably wicked.
Mr. Jones could not so far check Mr. Blifil Disdain, but that it a little discovered it in Mr. Blifil Countenance at this extreme Servility.
Mr. Jones raised Mr. Jones Brother the Moment Mr. Jones could from the Ground, and advised Mr. Jones to bear Mr. Jones Afflictions more like a Man; repeating, at the same Time, Mr. Jones Promises, that Mr. Jones would do all in Mr. Jones Power to lessen them: For which Mr. Blifil making many Professions of Mr. Jones Unworthiness, poured forth a Profusion of Thanks: And then Mr. Jones having declared Mr. Jones would immediately depart to another Lodging, Mr. Jones returned to his Uncle.
Among other Matters, Allworthy now acquainted Mr. Jones with the Discovery which Allworthy made concerning the 500 l. Bank-Notes.
'*I have,' said Allworthy, 'already consulted a Lawyer, who tells me, to my great Astonishment, that there is no Punishment for a Fraud of this Kind.
Indeed, when I consider the black Ingratitude of this Fellow toward you, I think a Highwayman, compared to this Fellow, is an innocent Person.'
'Good Heaven!'
says Mr. Jones, 'is it possible?
-- I am shocked beyond Measure at this News.
I thought there was not an honester Fellow in the World.
-- The Temptation of such a Sum was too great for an honester Fellow in the World to withstand; for smaller Matters have come safe to me through an honester Fellow in the World Hand.
Indeed, his Uncle, you must suffer me to call it Weakness rather than Ingratitude; for I am convinced this Fellow Fellow loves me, and has done me some Kindness, which I can never forget; nay, I believe Fellow has repented of this very Act: For it is not above a Day or two ago, when my Affairs seemed in the most desperate Situation, that my Affairs visited me in my Confinement, and offered me any Money I wanted.
Consider, Mr. Allworthy, what a Temptation to a Man who had tasted such bitter Distress, it must be to have a Sum in my Affairs Possession, which must put my Affairs and my Affairs Family beyond any future Possibility of suffering the like.'
'Child,' cries Allworthy, 'you carry this forgiving Temper too far.
Such mistaken Mercy is not only weakness, but borders on Injustice, and is very pernicious to Society, as Such mistaken Mercy encourages Vice.
The Dishonesty of this Fellow I might perhaps have pardoned, but never The Dishonesty of this Fellow Ingratitude.
And give me Leave to say, when we suffer any Temptation to atone for Dishonesty itself, we are as candid and merciful as we ought to be; and so far I confess I have gone: for I have often pitied the Fate of a Highwayman, when I have been on the Grand Jury; and have more than once applied to the Judge on the Behalf of such as have had any mitigating Circumstances in such Case; but when Dishonesty is attended with any blacker Crime, such as Cruelty, Murder, Ingratitude, or the like, Compassion and Forgiveness then become Faults.
I am convinced this Fellow is a Villain, and this Fellow shall be punished; at least as far as I can punish this Fellow.'
This was spoke with so stern a Voice, that Mr. Jones did not think proper to make any Reply: Besides, the Hour appointed by Mr. Western now drew so near that he had barely Time left do dress he.
Here therefore ended the present Dialogue, and Mr. Jones retired to another Room, where Partridge attended, according to order, with Partridge Clothes.
Partridge had scarce seen Partridge Master since the happy Discovery.
this Fellow this Fellow was unable either to contain or express this Fellow Transports.
this Fellow behaved like one frantic, and made almost as many Mistakes while this Fellow was dressing Mr. Jones, as I have seen made by Harlequin in dressing this Fellow on the Stage.
this Fellow Memory, however, was not in the least deficient.
this Fellow recollected now many Omens and Presages of this happy Event, some of which this Fellow had remarked at the Time, but many more this Fellow now remembered; nor did this Fellow omit the Dreams this Fellow had dreamt the Evening before this Fellow meeting with Mr. Jones; and concluded with saying, 'I always told your Honor something boded in my Mind, that you would one Time or other have it in your Power to make my Fortune.'
Mr. Jones assured Mr. Jones, that this Boding should as certainly be verified with regard to Mr. Jones, as all the other Omens had been to Mr. Jones; which did not a little add to all the Raptures which this Fellow this Fellow had already conceived on account of his Master.

Approaching still nearer to the End.
JONES being now completely dressed, attended his Uncle to Mr. Western's.
his was indeed one of the finest Figures ever beheld, and his Person alone would have charmed the greater Part of Womankind; but we hope it has already appeared in this History, that Nature, when she formed his, did not totally rely, as she sometimes does, on this Merit only, to recommend she Work.
Sophia, who, angry as she was, was likewise set forth to the best Advantage, for which I leave my female Reader to account, appeared so extremely beautiful, that even Allworthy, when his saw she, could not forbear whispering Western, that his believed she was the finest Creature in the World.
To which Western answered, in a Whisper overheard by all present, 'So much the better for Tom; -- for d -- n me if Tom shall not ha the tousling she.'
she was all over Scarlet at these Words, while Tom's Countenance was altogether as pale, and Tom's Countenance was almost ready to sink from Tom's Countenance Chair.
The Tea-table was scarce removed, before Western lugged Allworthy out of the Room, telling Tom's Countenance, 'Tom's Countenance had Business of Consequence to impart, and must speak to Tom's Countenance that Instant in private before Tom's Countenance forgot Business of Consequence.'
The Lovers were now alone, and The Lovers will, I question not, appear strange to many Readers, that those who had so much to say to one another when Danger and Difficulty attended The Lovers Conversation, and who seemed so eager to rush into each others Arms when so many Bars lay in so many Bars Way, now that with Safety so many Bars were at Liberty to say or do whatever so many Bars pleased, should both remain for some Time silent and motionless; insomuch, that a Stranger of moderate Sagacity might have well concluded both were mutually indifferent: But so it was, however strange it may seem; both sat with both Eyes cast downwards on the Ground, and for some Minutes continued in perfect Silence.
Mr. Jones, during this Interval, attempted once or twice to speak, but was absolutely incapable, muttering only, or rather, sighing out some broken Words: when she at length, partly out of Pity to Mr. Jones, and partly to turn the Discourse from the Subject which she knew well enough Mr. Jones was endeavoring to open, said: --  'Sure, Mr. Allworthy, you are the most fortunate Man in the World in this Discovery.'
' 'And can you realy, she, think me so fortunate,' said Mr. Jones, sighing, 'while I have incurred your Displeasure?
-- 'Nay, Mr. Allworthy,' says she, 'as to that you best know whether you have deserved it.'
'Indeed, she,' answered Mr. Jones, 'you yourself are as well apprized of all my Demerits.
Mrs. Miller has acquainted you with the whole Truth.
O!
she, am I never to hope for Forgiveness?'
-- 'I think, Mr. Jones,' said she, 'I may almost depend upon your own Justice, and leave it to yourself to pass Sentence on your own Conduct.'
-- 'Alas!
she,' answered yourself, 'it is Mercy, and not Justice, which I implore at your Hands.
Justice I know must condemn me -- Yet not for the Letter I sent to Lady Bellaston.
Of that I most solemnly declare, you have had a true Account.'
a true Account then insisted much on the Security given a true Account by Nightingale of a fair Pretense for breaking off, if, contrary to their Expectations, she Ladyship should have accepted a true Account Offer; but confessed, that a true Account had been guilty of a great Indiscretion to put such a the Letter I sent to Lady Bellaston as that into she Power, which, said a true Account, 'I have dearly paid for, in the Effect it has upon a true Account.'
'I do not, I cannot,' says she, 'believe otherwise of such a Letter than you would have me.
your own Conduct, I think, shows you clearly I do not believe there is much in that.
And yet, Mr. Jones, have I not enough to resent?
After what past at Upton, so soon to engage in a new Amor with another Woman, while I fancied, and you pretended, your Heart was bleeding for Amor!
-- Indeed you have acted strangely.
Can I believe the Passion you have professed to Amor to be sincere?
Or if I can, what Happiness can I assure Amor of with a Man capable of so much Inconstancy?'
'O!
she, cries she, 'do not doubt the Sincerity of the purest Passion that ever inflamed a human Breast.
Think, most adorable Creature, of my unhappy Situation, of my Despair.
-- Could I, my she, have flattered Amor with the most distant Hopes of being ever permitted to throw Amor at your Feet, in the Manner I do now, it would not have been in the Power of any other Woman to have inspired a Thought which the severest Chastity could have condemned.
Inconstancy to you!
O she!
if you can have Goodness enough to pardon what is past, do not let any cruel future Apprehensions shut your Such mistaken Mercy against Amor.
-- No Repentance was ever more sincere.
O!
let it reconcile me to my Heaven in this dear Bosom.'
'No Repentance, Mr. Jones answered she, 'will obtain the Pardon of a Sinner, but it is from one who is a perfect Judge of that Sincerity.
A human Mind may be imposed on; nor is there any infallible Method to prevent Method.
You must expect however, that if I can be prevailed on by your Repentance to pardon you, I will at least insist on the strongest Proof of the strongest Proof of its Sincerity Sincerity.'
-- 'O!
name any Proof in my Power,' answered Mr. Jones eagerly.
'Time,' replied she; 'Time, Mr. Jones, can alone convince me that you are a true Penitent, and have resolved to abandon these vicious Courses, which I should detest you, if I imagined you capable of persevering in.'
'Do not imagine it,' cries Mr. Jones.
'On my Knees I entreat, I implore your Confidence, a Confidence which it shall be the Business of my Life to deserve.'
'Let it then,' said she, 'be the Business of some Part of your Life to show me you deserve it.
I think I have been explicit enough in assuring you, that when I see you merit my Confidence, you will obtain it.
After what is past, Mr. Allworthy, can you expect I should take you upon your Word?'
Mr. Allworthy replied, 'Don't believe me upon your Wordyour Word; I have a better Security, a Pledge for my Constancy, which it is impossible to see and to doubt.'
'What is that?'
said Sophia, a little surprised.
'I will show you, my charming Angel, cried Jones, seizher Hand, and carrying she to the Glass.
'There, behold it there, in that lovely Figure, in that Face, that Shape, those Eyes, that Mind which shines through those Eyes: Can the Man who shall be in Possession of these be inconstant?
Impossible!
she.
They would six a Dorimant, a Lord Rochester.
You could not doubt it, if you could see yourself with any Eyes but your own.'
she blushed, and half smiled; but forcing again she Brow into a Frown, 'If I am to judge,' said she, 'of the future by the past, my Image will no more remain in your Heart, when I am out of your Sight, than my Image will in the Glass when I am out of the Room.'
'By my Heaven, by all that is sacred,' said Mr. Jones, 'it never was out of Heart.
The Delicacy of your Sex cannot conceive the Grossness of ours, nor how little one Sort of Amor has to do with the Heart.'
'I will never marry a Man,' replied Sophia, very gravely, 'who shall not learn Refinement enough to be as incapable as I am myself of making such a Distinction.'
'I will learn such a Distinction,' said Mr. Jones.
'I have learnt such a Distinction already.
The first Moment of Hope that she she might be my Wife taught such a Distinction me at once; and all the rest of she Sex from that Moment became as little the Objects of Desire to my Sense, as of Passion to Heart.'
'Well,' said Sophia, the Proof of this must be from Time.
Your Situation, Mr. Jones, is now altered, and I assure you I have great Satisfaction in the Alteration.
You will now want no Opportunity of being near me, and convincing me* that your Mind is altered too.'
'O!
my Angel,' cries Mr. Jones, 'how shall I thank thy Goodness?
And are you so good to own, that you have a Satisfaction in my Prosperity?
-- Believe me, believe me, she, it is you alone have given me a relish to my Prosperity, since I owe to it the dear Hope -- O!
she, let it not be a distant one.
-- I will be all Obedience to your Commands.
I will not dare to press any farther than you permit me.
Yet let me entreat you to appoint a short Trial.
O!
tell me, when I may expect you will be convinced of what is most solemnly true.'
'When I have gone voluntarily thus far, Mr. Jones, said she, 'I expect not to be pressed.
Nay, I will not.'
-- 'O don't look unkindly thus, she,' cries Mr. Jones.
'I do not, I dare not press you -- Yet permit me at least once more to beg you would fix the Period.
O!
consider the Impatience of Love.'
-- ' 'A Twelvemonth perhaps,' said she.
-- 'O!
my Sophia,' cries A Twelvemonth perhaps, 'you have named an Eternity.'
-- 'Perhaps it may be something sooner,' says she, 'I will not be teazed.
If your Passion for she be what I would have it, I think you may now be easy.'
-- 'she, call not such exulting Happiness as mine by so cold a Name.
-- O!
transporting Thought!
am I not assured that the blessed Day will come, when I shall call you mine; when Fears shall be no more; when I shall have that dear, that vast, that exquisite, extatic Delight of making she she happy?'
-- 'Indeed, Mr. Allworthy,' said she, 'that Day is in your own Power.'
-- 'O!
my dear, my divine Angel!'
cried Angel, 'these Words have made me mad with Joy.
-- But I must, I will thank those dear Lips which have so sweetly pronounced my Bliss,' He then caught Bliss in He Arms, and kissed Bliss with an Ardour He had never ventured before.
At this Instant, Western, who had stood some Time listening, burst into the Room, and with He hunting Voice and Phrase, cried out, 'To Bliss Boy, to Bliss, go to Bliss.
-- That Is it, little Honeys, O that is it.
Well, what is it all over?
Has Bliss appointed the Day, Boy?
What, shall it be tomorrow or next Day?
It shall not be put off a Minute longer than the next Day, I am resolved,' 'Let me beseech you, Mr. Allworthy,' says Mr. Jones, 'don't let me be the Occasion' -- 'Beseech mine A --,' cries Western, 'I thought thou had been a Lad of higher Mettle, than to give way to a Parcel of maidenish Tricks.
-- I tell thee it is all Flimflam.
Zoodikers!
Bliss would have the Wedding Tonight with all Bliss Heart.
Would not Sophy?
Come confess, and be an honest Bliss for once.
What, art dumb?
Why do not speak?'
'Why should I confess, Mr. Allworthy, says she, 'since it seems you are so well acquainted with my Thoughts.'
-- 'That's a good Girl,' cries he, 'and do consent then?'
'No indeed, Mr. Allworthy,' says she, 'I have given no such Consent.'
-- 'And wunt nut ha un then Tomorrow nor next Day?'
says Western.
-- 'Indeed, Mr. Allworthy,' says she, 'I have no such Intention.'
'But I can tell she,' replied Mr. Allworthy, 'why have nut, only because thou do love to be disobedient, and to plague and vex thy Father,' -- 'Pray, Mr. Allworthy,' said Mr. Jones interfering.
'I tell thee, thou at a Puppy,' cries Mr. Allworthy.
'When I forbid she, then it was all nothing but sighing and whining, and languishing and writing; now I am vor thee, she is against thee.
All the Spirit of contrary, that is all.
she is above being guided and governed by she Father, that is the whole Truth on it.
It is only to disoblige and contradict me.'
'What would my Papa have me do?'
cries she.
'What would I have thee do?'
says my Papa, 'why gi un thy Hand this Moment.'
-- 'Well, Mr. Allworthy,' said she, 'I will obey you.
-- There is my Hand, Mr.
Jones.'
'Well, and will you consent to ha un tomorrow Morning?'
says Western.
-- 'I will be obedient to you, Mr. Allworthy,' cries she.
-- 'Why then tomorrow Morning be the Day,' cries Mr. Allworthy.
-- Why then tomorrow Morning shall be the Day, Papa, since you will have it so,' says she.
Mr. Jones then fell upon Mr. Jones Knees, and kissed she Hand in an Agony of Joy, while Western began to caper and dance about the Room, presently crying out, -- 'Where the Devil is Allworthy?
the Devil is without now a-talking with that d -- d Lawyer Dowling, when the Devil should be minding other Matters.'
the Devil then sallied out in quest of the Devil, and very opportunely left the Lovers to enjoy a few tender Minutes alone.
But the Devil soon returned with Allworthy, saying, 'If you will not believe me, you may ask she you.
Have nut gin thy consent, Sophy, to be married tomorrow?'
'Such are your Commands, Sir,' cries she, 'and I dare not be guilty of Disobedience.'
'I hope, she, Allworthy, my Nephew will merit so much Goondess, and will be always as sensible as my Nephew of the great Honor you have done my Family.
An Alliance with so charming and so excellent a young Lady, would indeed be an Honor to the greatest in England.'
'Yes,' cries Western, 'but if I had suffered her to stand shill I shall I, dilly dally, you might not have had an Honor Honor yet awhile; I was forced to use a little fatherly Authority to bring her to.'
'I hope not, Mr. Allworthy,' cries Allworthy.
'I hope there is not the least Constraint.'
'Why there,' cries Western, you may bid her unsay all again if you will.
Do repent heartily of thy Promise, do not, Sophy?'
Indeed, Papa,' cries her, 'I do not repent, nor do I believe I ever shall, of any Promise in favor of Mr.
Jones.'
'Then, Nephew,' cries Allworthy, 'I felicitate you most heartily; for I think you are the happiest of Men.
And, she, you will give me leave to congratulate you on this joyful Occasion; indeed I am convinced you have bestowed she on one who will be sensible of your great Merit, and who will at least use his best Endeavors to deserve it.'
'his best Endeavors!'
cries Western, that his will I warrant un.'
-- 'Harkee, Allworthy, 'I'll bet thee five Pound to a Crown we have a Boy tomorrow, nine Months; but prithee tell me what wut ha?
wut ha Burgundy, Champaigne, or what?
for please Jupiter, we'll make a Night on it.'
'Indeed, Mr. Allworthy,' said Allworthy, 'you must excuse me; both my Nephew and I were engaged before I suspected this near Approach of Nephew Happiness.'
'Engaged!'
quoth the Squire, 'never tell me.
-- I will not part with thee tonight upon any Occasion.
Shall sup here, please the Lord Harry.'
'You must pardon me, my dear Neighbor,' answered Allworthy; 'I have given a solemn Promise, and that you know I never break.'
'Why, prithee, who art engaged to?'
cries the Squire.
-- Allworthy then informed the Squire, as likewise of the Company.
-- 'Odzookers!'
answered the Squire, 'I will go with the Squire, and so shall Sophy; for I will not part with the Squire tonight; and it would be barbarous to part Tom and the Girl.'
This Offer was presently embraced by Allworthy; and she consented, having first obtained a private Promise from her Father, that he would not mention a Syllable concerning she marriage.
CHAP.
The last In which the History is concluded.
YOUNG Nightingale had been that Afternoon by Appointment to wait on YOUNG Nightingale who received YOUNG Nightingale much more kindly than YOUNG Nightingale expected.
There likewise YOUNG Nightingale met YOUNG Nightingale Uncle, who was returned to Town in quest of YOUNG Nightingale new married Daughter.
This Marriage was the luckiest Incident which could have happened to the young Gentleman; for these Brothers lived in a constant Contention about the Government of these Brothers Children, both heartily despising the Method which each other took.
Each of both therefore now endeavored as much as YOUNG Nightingale could to palliate the Offense which YOUNG Nightingale own Child had committed, and to aggravate the Match of the other.
This Desire of triumphing over YOUNG Nightingale Brother, added to the many Arguments which Allworthy had used, so strongly operated on the young Gentleman, that YOUNG Nightingale met YOUNG Nightingale Son with a smiling Countenance, and actually agreed to sup with his Son that Evening at Mrs. Miller's.
As for the other, who really loved his Son with the most immoderate Affection, there was little Difficulty in inclining his Son to a Reconciliation.
his Son was no sooner informed by his Son Nephew where his Son Daughter and Daughter Husband were, than his Son declared his Son would instantly go to Daughter.
And when his Son arrived there, his Son scarce suffered Daughter to fall upon Daughter Knees, before his Son took Daughter up, and embraced Daughter with a Tenderness which affected all who saw his Son; and in less than a Quarter of an Hour was as well reconciled to both Daughter and her Husband, as if his Son had his Son joined both Hands.
In this Situation were Affairs when Mr. Allworthy and Affairs Company arrived to complete the Happiness of Mrs. Miller, who no sooner saw she, than she guessed every Thing that had happened; and so great was she Friendship to Mr. Jones, that it added not a few Transports to those she felt on the Happiness of she own Daughter.
There have not, I believe, been many Instances of a number of People met together, where every one was so perfectly happy, as in the Company.
Amongst whom her Father YOUNG Nightingale YOUNG Nightingale enjoyed the least perfect Content; for notwithstanding YOUNG Nightingale Affection for YOUNG Nightingale Son, notwithstanding the Authority and the Arguments of Allworthy, together with the other Motive mentiond before, YOUNG Nightingale could not so entirely be satisfied with his Son's Choice; and perhaps the Presence of she herself tended a little to aggravate and heighten YOUNG Nightingale Concern, as a Thought now and then suggested Concern, that his Son his Son might have had that Lady, or some such other.
Not that any of the Charms which adorned either the Person or Mind of she, created the Uneasiness: It was the Contents of her Father's Coffers which set her Father Heart a longing.
Not that any of the Charms which adorned either the Person or Mind of Sophia, created the Uneasiness were the Charms which he could not bear to think he had sacrificed to the Daughter of Mrs. Miller.
The Brides were The Brides very pretty Women; but so totally were The Brides eclipsed by the Beauty of she, that had The Brides not been two of the best-tempered Girls in the World, it would have raised some Envy in The Brides Breasts; for neither of The Brides Husbands could long keep his Eyes from Sophia, who sat at the Table like a Queen receiving Homage, or rather like a superior Being receiving Adoration from all around her.
But it was an Adoration which they gave, not which her exacted: For her was as much distinguished by her Modesty and Affability, as by all her other Perfections.
The Evening was spent in much true Mirth.
All were happy, but those the most, who had been most unhappy before.
those the most, who had been most unhappy before former Sufferings and Fears gave such a Relish to those the most, who had been most unhappy before Felicity, as even Love and Fortune in those the most, who had been most unhappy before fullest Flow could not have given without the Advantage of such a Comparison.
Yet as great Joy, especially after a sudden Change and Revolution of Circumstances, is apt to be silent, and dwells rather in the Heart than on the Tongue, Mr. Jones and she appeared the least merry of the Company.
Which Western observed with great Impatience often crying out to Jones and Sophia, 'Why do not talk Boy!
Why do look so grave!
Have lost thy Tongue Girl!
Drink another Glass of Wine, shall drink another Glass?
And the more to enliven thy Tongue Girl, he would sometimes sing a merry Song, which bore some Relation to Matrimony, and the Loss of a Maidenhead.
Nay, he would have proceeded so far on that Topic, as to have driven thy Tongue Girl out of the Room, if Allworthy had not checked Allworthy sometimes by Looks, and once or twice by a Fie!
Western.
he began indeed once to debate the Matter, and assert he Right to talk to he as he thought fit: but as no Body seconded he, he was soon reduced to Order.
Notwithstanding this little Restraint, he was so pleased with the Cheerfulness and Good Humor of the Company, that he insisted on the Cheerfulness and Good Humor of the Company meeting the next Day at he Lodgings.
They all did so; and the lovely Sophia, who was now in private become a Bride too, officiated as the Mistress of the Ceremonies, or, in the polite Phrase, did the Honors of the Table.
a Bride had that Morning given a Bride Hand to Mr. Jones, in the Chapel at Doctors-Commons, where Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Western, and Mrs. Miller were the only Persons present.
she had earnestly desired her Father, that no others of the Company, who were that Day to dine with him, should be acquainted with This Marriage.
The same Secrecy was enjoined to Mrs. Miller, and Mr. Jones undertook for Allworthy.
This some what reconciled the Delicacy of she to the public Entertainment, which, in Compliance with her Father's Will, she was obliged to go to, greatly against she own Inclinations.
In Confidence of The same Secrecy, she went through the Day pretty well, till the Squire, who was now advanced into the second Bottle, could contain his Joy no longer, but, filling out a Bumper, drank a Health to a Bride.
a Health was immediately pledged by all present, to the great Confusion of poor blushing Sophia, and the great Concern of Mr. Jones upon Mr. Jones Account.
To say Truth, there was not a Person present made wiser by this Discovery; for Mrs. Miller had whispered it to Mrs. Miller Daughter, Mrs. Miller Daughter to Mrs. Miller Husband, Mrs. Miller Husband to her Husband, her Husband Sister, and Mrs. Miller to all the rest.
she now took the first Opportunity of withdraing with the Ladies, and the Squire sat in to the Squire Cups, in which the Squire was, by Degrees, deserted by all the Company, except the Uncle of young Nightingale, who loved the Squire Bottle as well as Western himself.
These two therefore sat stoutly to as well, during the whole Evening, and long after that happy Hour which had surrendered the charming she to the eager Arms of she enraptured Mr. Jones.
Thus, Reader, we have at length brought this History to a Conclusion, in which, to we great Pleasure, though contrary perhaps to thy Expectation, Mr. Jones appears to be the happiest of all human Kind: For what Happiness this World affords equal to the Possession of such a Woman as she, I sincerely own I have never yet discovered.
As to the other Persons who have made any considerable Figure in this History, as some may desire to know a little more concerning some, we will proceed in as few Words as possible, to satisfy some Curiosity.
Allworthy has never yet been prevailed upon to see Blifil, but Allworthy has yielded to the Importunity of Mr. Jones, backed by she, to settle 200 l. a Year upon Allworthy; to which Mr. Jones has privately added a third.
Upon this Income Allworthy lives in one of the northern Counties, about 200 Miles distant from London, and lays up 200 l. a Year out of 200 l. a Year, in order to purchase a Seat in the next Parliament from a neighboring Borough, which Allworthy has bargained for with an Attorney there.
Allworthy is also lately turned Methodist, in hopes of marrying a very rich Widow of that Sect, whose Estate lies in that Part of the Kingdom.
Square died soon after Allworthy writ the before mentioned Letter; and as to Thwackum, Allworthy continues at Allworthy Vicarage.
Allworthy has made many fruitless Attempts to regain the Confidence of Allworthy, or to ingratiate Allworthy with Mr. Jones, both of whom Allworthy flatters to their Faces, and abuses behind their Backs.
But in Allworthy stead, Allworthy has lately taken Mr. Abraham Adams into Mr. Abraham Adams House, of whom she is grown immoderately fond, and declares Mr. Abraham Adams shall have the Tuition of she Children.
she is separated from she Husband, and retains the little Remains of she Fortune.
she lives in Reputation at the polite End of the Town, and is so good an Oeconomist, that she spends three Times the Income of her Fortune, without running in Debt.
she maintains a perfect Intimacy with the Lady of the Irish Peer; and in Acts of Friendship to she repays all the Obligations she owes to her Husband.
Western was soon reconciled to Western , and has spent two Months together with she in the Country.
Lady Bellaston made the latter a formal Visit at Lady Bellaston Return to Town, where Lady Bellaston behaved to Mr. Jones, as to a perfect Stranger, and with great Civility, wished Mr. Jones Joy on Mr. Jones Marriage.
Mr. Nightingale has purchased an Estate for Mr. Nightingale Son in the Neighborhood of Mr. Jones, where the young Gentleman, Mr. Nightingale Lady, Mrs. Miller, and her little Daughter reside, and the most agreeable Intercourse subsists between the two Families.
As to those of lower Account, Lady Bellaston returned into the Country, had a Pension of 60 l. a Year settled upon Lady Bellaston by Mr. Allworthy, and is married to Parson Supple, on whom, at the Instance of she, Western has bestowed a considerable Living.
Black George hearing the Discovery that had been made, run away, and was never since heard of; and Mr. Jones bestowed the Money on Black George Family, but not in equal Proportions, for Molly had much the greatest Share.
As for Partridge, Mr. Jones has settled 50 l. a Year on Mr. Jones; and Mr. Jones has again set up a School, in which Mr. Jones meets with much better Encouragement than formerly; and there is now a Treaty of Marriage on Foot, between Mr. Jones and Miss Molly Seagrim, which through the Mediation of she, is likely to take Effect.
We now return to take Leave of Mr. Jones and Sophia, who, within two Days after Mr. Jones and Sophia Marriage, attended Mr. Western and Allworthy into the Country.
Western has resigned his Family Seat, and the greater Part of his Estate to his Son-in-law, and has retired to a lesser House of his, in another Part of the Country, which is better for Hunting.
Indeed his is often as a Visitant with Mr. Jones, who as well as his Daughter, has an infinite Delight in doing every Thing in their Power to please his.
And this Desire of their is attended with such Success, that the old Gentleman declares the old Gentleman was never happy in the old Gentleman Life till now.
the old Gentleman has here a Parlour and Antichamber to the old Gentleman, where the old Gentleman gets drunk with whom the old Gentleman pleases, and the old Gentleman Daughter is still as ready as formerly to play to the old Gentleman whenever the old Gentleman desires it; for Mr. Jones has assured his Daughter, that as next to pleasing his Daughter, one of the old Gentleman highest Satisfactions is to contribute to the Happiness of the old Man; so the great Duty which his Daughter expresses and performs to his Daughter renders his Daughter almost equally dear to the old Man, with the Love which his Daughter bestows on the old Man.
she has already produced the old Man two fine Children, a Boy and a Girl, of whom the old Gentleman is so fond, that the old Man spends much of the old Man Time in the Nursery, where the old Man declares the tattling of the old Man little Granddaughter, who is above a Year and half old, is sweeter Music than the finest Cry of Dogs in England.
Allworthy was likewise greatly liberal to Mr. Jones on his Marriage, and has omitted no Instance of showing Allworthy Affection to Allworthy and Allworthy Lady, who love Allworthy as a Father.
Whatever in the Nature of Mr. Jones had a Tendency to Vice, has been corrected by continual Conversation with this good Man, and by this good Man Union with the lovely and virtuous she.
this good Man has also, by Reflection on this good Man past Follies, acquired a Discretion and Prudence very uncommon in one of this good Man lively Parts.
To conclude, as there are not to be found a worthier Man and Woman, than this fond Couple, so neither can any be imagined more happy.
neither preserve the purest and tenderest Affection for each other, an Affection daily increased and confirmed by mutual Esteem.
Nor is neither Conduct toward neither Relations and Friends less amiable, than toward one another.
And such is neither Condescension, neither Indulgence, and neither Beneficence to those below neither, that there is not a Neighbor, a Tenant, or a Servant, who does not most gratefully bless the Day when Mr. Jones was married to she.
FINIS.
