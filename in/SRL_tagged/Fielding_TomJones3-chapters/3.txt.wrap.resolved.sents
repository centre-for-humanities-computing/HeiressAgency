nothing, they are doing Mischief.
I will not enlarge this quaint Saying to the most beautiful Part of the Creation in general: but so far I may be allowed, that when the^ Effects of female Jealousy do not appear openly i^ their proper Colors of Rage and Fury, we may suspect that mischievous Passion to be at work privately and attempting to undermine, what it does not attack above-ground.
This was exemplified in the Conduct of the Lady Bellaston, who under all the Smiles which she wor^ in she Countenance, concealed much Indignation against Sophia; and as Sophia plainly saw that this young Lady stood between this young Lady and the full Indulgence o^ this young Lady Desires, this young Lady resolved to get rid of this young Lady by some Means or other; nor was it long before a very favorable Opportunity of accomplishing this, presented it to this young Lady.
The Reader may be pleased to remember, that when Sophia was thrown into that Consternation at the Play house, by the Wit and Humor of a Set of young Gentlemen, who call themselves the Town, we informed him, that Sophia had put Sophia under the Protection of a young Nobleman, who had very safely conducted Sophia to Sophia Chair.
This Nobleman, who frequently visited Lady Bellaston, had more than once seen Sophia there, sin^^ Sophia Arrival in Town, and had conceived a very great liking to Sophia; which Liking, as Beauty never look^ more amiable than in Distress, Sophia had in the Fright so increased, that Sophia might now without any great Impropriety be said to be actually in love with Sophia.
It may easily be believed that Sophia would not suffer so handsome an Occasion of improving Sophia Acquaintance with the beloved Object as now offered the beloved Object to elapse, when good-breeding alone might have prompted Sophia to pay her a Visit.
The next Morning therefore, after this Accident Sophia waited on Sophia, with the usual Compliments and Hopes that Sophia had received no Harm from Sophia last Night's Adventure.
As Love like Fire when once thoroughly kindled, ^s soon blown into a Flame; Sophia in a very short Time completed Sophia Conquest.
Time now flew away unperceived, and the Noble Lord had been two Hours in Company with the Lady, before Company entered unto the Noble Lord Head that the Noble Lord had made too long a Visit.
Though ^his Circumstance alone would have alarmed Sophia, who was somewhat more a Mistress of Computation at present; Sophia had indeed much more pregnant Evidence from the Eyes of Sophia Lover of what ^ast within the Noble Lord Bosom; nay, though the Noble Lord did not make any open Declaration of the Noble Lord Passion, yet many of ^is Expressions were rather too warm, and too tender ^o have been imputed to Complaisance, even in the Age when Complaisance Complaisance was in Fashion; the very Reverse of which is well known to be the reign^ng Mode at present.
the Lady had been apprised of Lordship's Visit at the Lady first Arrival; and the Length of it very well satisfied the Lady that Things went as the Lady wished, and is indeed the Lady had suspected the second Time the Lady saw this young Couple together.
This Business the Lady rightly, I think, concluded, that the Lady should by no means forward by mixing in the Company while they were together; the Lady therefore ordered the Lady Servants that when my Lord was going, they should tell my Lord, the Lady desired to speak with my Lord, and employed the intermediate Time in meditating how best to accomplish a Scheme which the Lady made no doubt but my Lord Lord hip would very readily embrace the Execution of.
Lord Fellamar (for that was the Title of this young Nobleman) was no sooner introduced to the Lady Ladyship, than the Lady attacked my Lord in the following Strain: 'Bless me, my Lord, are you here yet?
I thought her Servants had made a Mistake and let you got away; and I wanted to see you about an Affair of some Importance.'
-- 'Indeed, Lady Bellaston,' said Lady Bellaston, I don't wonder you are astonished at the Length of my Visit: For I have staid above two Hours, and did not think I had staid above half a one.'
-- 'What am I to conclude from thence, my Lord?'
said the Lady, 'The Company must be very agreeable which can make Time slide away so very deceitfully.'
-- 'Upon my Honor,' said Lady Bellaston, 'the most agreeable I ever saw.
Pray tell me, Lady Bellaston, who is this blazing Star which you have produced among us all of a sudden?'
-- What blazing Star, my Lord?'
said the Lady, affecting a Surprise.
-- 'I mean,' said Lady Bellaston, 'the Lady I saw here the other Day, whom I had last Night in my Arms at the Playhouse, and to whom I have been making that unreasonable Visit.'
-- 'O my Cousin Western,' said the Lady, 'why that blazing Star, my Lord, is the Daughter of a Country Booby Squire, and has been in own about a fortnight, for the first Time.'
-- 'Upon my Soul,' said -- 'O my Cousin Western, 'I should swear the Lady had been bred in a Court; for besides the Lady Beauty, I never saw any thing so genteel, so sensible, so polite.'
-- 'O brave!'
cries the Lady, 'My Cousin has you, I find.'
-- 'Upon my Honor,' answered My Cousin, 'I wish the Lady had: for I am in Love with the Lady to Distraction.'
-- 'Nay, my Lord,' said the Lady, 'it is not wishing the Lady very ill neither, for the Lady is a very great Fortune, I assure you the Lady is an only Child, and the Lady Father's Estate is a good 3000l.
a Year.'
'Then I can assure you, the Lady,' answered my Lord, 'I think the Lady the best Match in England.'
'Indeed, my Lord,' replied the Lady, 'if you like the Lady, I heartily wish you had the Lady.'
'If you think so kindly of me, the Lady,' said me, 'as the Lady is a Relation of yours, will you do me the Honor to propose it to her Father?'
'And are you really then in earnest?'
cries the Lady, with an affected Gravity.
'I hope, the Lady,' answered me, 'you have a better Opinion of me, than to imagine I would jest with your Ladyship in an Affair of this Kind.'
'Indeed then,' said the Lady, 'I will most readily propose your Lordship to her Father, and I can, I believe, assure you of your Lordship joyful Acceptance of the Proposal; but there is a Bar, which I am almost ashamed to mention, and yet it is one you will never be able to conquer.
You have a Rival my Lord, and a Rival who, though I blush to name a Rival my Lord, neither you nor all the World will ever be able to conquer.'
'Upon my Word, Lady Bellaston,' cries your Lordship, 'you have struck a damp to my Heart which has almost deprived me of Being.'
'Fie!
my Lord,' said the Lady, 'I should rather hope I had struck Fire into the Lady.
A Lover, and talk of Damps in your Heart!
I rather imagined you would have asked your Rivil's Name, that you might have immediately entered the Lists with Rivil's Name.'
'I promise you, the Lady,' answered Rivil's Name, 'there are very few Things I would not undertake for your charming Cousin; but pray who is this happy Man?'
-- 'Why this happy Man is,' said the Lady, 'what I am sorry to say most happy Men with us are, one of the lowest Fellows in all the World.
this happy Man is a Beggar, a Bastard, a Foundling, a Fellow in meaner Circumstances than one of your Lordship's Footmen.'
'And is it possible,' cried this happy Man, that a young Creature with such Perfections, should think of bestowing herself so unworthily?'
'Alas!
my Lord,' answered herself, 'consider the Country -- the Bane of all young Women is the Country.
There the Bane of all young Women learn a Set of romantic Notions of Love and I know not what Folly, which The Company can scarce eradicate in a whole Winter.'
'Indeed, Madam,' replied my Lord, your Cousin is of too immense a Value to be thrown away: Such Ruin as this must be prevented.'
'Alas!'
cries herself, 'my Lord, how can it be prevented?'
The 'Family have already done all in The 'Family Power; but herself herself is, I think, intoxicated, and nothing less than Such Ruin will content herself.
And to deal more openly with you, I expect every Day to hear herself is run away with my Lord.'
'What you tell me, the Lady,' answered Lordship, 'affects me most tenderly, and only raises my Compassion instead of lessening my Adoration of your Cousin.
Some Means must be found to preserve so inestimable a Jewel.
Has your Ladyship endeavored to reason with herself?'
Here the Lady affected a Laugh.
and cried, 'my Lord, sure you know us better than to talk of reasoning a young Woman out of a young Woman Inclinations.
These inestimable Jewels are as deaf as the Jewels These inestimable Jewels wear; Time, my Lord, Time is the only Medicine to cure These inestimable Jewels Folly; but this is a Medicine, which I am certain the Lady will not take; nay, I live in hourly Horrors on the Lady Account.
In short nothing but violent Methods will do.'
'What is to be done?'
cries my Lord, 'what Methods are to be taken?'
-- 'Is there any Method upon Earth?'
-- 'Oh!
the Lady!
there is nothing which I would not undertake for such a Reward.'
-- 'I really know not,' answered the Lady, after a Pause, and then pausing again, the Lady cried out, -- 'Upon my Soul, I am at my Wit's End on her Account.
-- If the Lady can be preserved, something must be done immediately, and as I say, nothing but violent Methods will do.
-- If Lordship has really this Attachment to My Cousin, (and to do Lordship Justice, except in this silly Inclination, of which Lordship will soon see Lordship Folly, Lordship is every way deserving,) I think there may be one Way, indeed it is a very disagreeable one, and what I am almost afraid to think of.
-- it requires great Spirit, I promise you.'
'I am not conscions, Lordship,' said conscions, 'of any Defect there, nor am I, I hope, suspected of any such.
It must be an egregious Defect indeed, which could make me backward on this Occasion.'
'Nay, my Lord,' answered Lordship, 'I am far from doubting you.
I am much more inclined to doubt my own Courage: for I must run a monstrous Risque.
In short, I must place such a Confidence in your Honor as a wise Lordship will scarce ever place in a Man on any Consideration.'
In this Point likewise my Lord very well satisfied Lordship; for my Lord Reputation was extremely clear, and common Fame did my Lord no more than Justice, in speaking well of my Lord.
'Well then,' said Lordship, my Lord, -- I -- I vow, I cannot bear the Apprehension of it -- No, it shall not be.
-- At least every other Method must be tried.
Can you get rid of your Engagements and dine here today?
Lordship will have an Opportunity of seeing a little more of Miss Western.
-- I promise you we have no time to lose.
Here will be nobody but Lady Betty, and Miss Eagle, and Colonel Hampsted, and Tom Edwards; Lady Betty, and Miss Eagle, and Colonel Hampsted, and Tom Edwards will all go soon -- and I shall be at home to nobody.
Then Lordship may be a little more explicit.
Nay' I will contrive some Method to convince you of Lordship Attachment to this Fellow.'
my Lord made proper Compliments, accepted the Invitation, and then they parted to dress, it being now past three in the Morning, or to reckon by the old Style, in the Afternoon.
CHAP.
III.
A further Explanation of the foregoing Design.
THOUGH the Reader may have long since concluded the Lady to be a Member (and no inconsiderable one) of the Great World, the Lady was in reality a very considerable Member of the Little World; by which Appellation was distinguished a very worthy and honorable Society which not long since flourished in this Kingdom.
Among other good Principles upon which this Society was founded, was one very remarkable; for as it was a Rule of an honorable Club of Heroes, who assembled at the close of the late War, that all the Members should every Day fight once at least; so 'twas in this, that every Member should, within the twenty four Hours, tell at least one merry Fib, which was to be propagated by all the Brethren and Sisterhood.
Many idle Stories were told about this Society, which from a certain Quality may be perhaps not unjustly supposed to have come from this Society Many idle Stories.
As, that the Devil was the President, and that he sat in Person in an elbow Chair at the upper End of the Table; but upon very strict Enquiry, I find there is not the least Truth in any of those Tales, and that the Assembly consisted in reality of a Set of very good sort of People, and the Fibs which they propagated were of a harmless Kind, and tended only to produce Mirth and good Humor.
Tom Edwards was likewise a Member of this comical Society.
To Tom Edwards therefore the Lady applied as a proper Instrument for the Lady Purpose, and furnished Tom Edwards with a Fib, which Tom Edwards was to vent whenever the Lady the Lady gave Tom Edwards the Lady Cue; and this was not to be till the Evening when all the Company but Lord Fellamar and Tom Edwards were gone, and while all the Company but Lord Fellamar and himself were engaged in a Rubbers at Whist.
To this Time then, which was between seven and eight in the Evening, we will convey we ; when Lady Bellaston, Lord Fellamar, Miss Western, and Tom being engaged at Whist, and in the last Game of Lady Bellaston, Lord Fellamar, Miss Western, and Tom Rubbers, Tom received Tom Cue from Lady Bellaston, which was, I protest Tom, you are grown intolerable lately; you used to tell us all the News of the Town, and now you know no more of all the World than if you lived out of all the World.
Tom Edwards then began as follows: 'The Fault is not mine, Madam; The Fault lies in the Dullness of the Age that does nothing worth talking Of -- O la!
though now I think on The Fault, there has a terrible Accident befallen poor Col. Wilcox.
-- Poor Ned -- You know -- Poor Ned my Lord, every body knows him my Lord; faith!
I am very much concerned for him my Lord.'
'What is it, pray?'
says the Lady.
'Why, him my Lord has killed a Man this Morning in a Duel, that is all.'
His Lordship, who was not in the Secret, asked gravely, whom His had killed; to which Tom Edwards answered, 'A young Fellow we none of us know; a Somersetshire Lad just come to town, one Jones one Jones Name is; a near Relation of one Mr. Allworthy, of whom your Lordship I believe has heard.
I saw a Somersetshire Lad lie dead in a Coffee-house.
-- Upon my Soul a Somersetshire Lad is one of the finest Corpses I ever saw in my Life.'
Sophia, who just began to deal as Tom had mentioned that a Man was killed, stopped her Hand, and listened with Attention, (for all Stories of that Kind affected her) but no sooner had a Man arrived at the latter part of the Story, than her began to deal again; and having dealt three Cards to one, and seven to another, and ten to a third, at last dropped the rest from her Hand, and fell back in her .
The Company behaved as usually on these Occasions.
The usual Disturbance ensued, the usual Assistance was summoned, and Sophia at last, as it is usual, returned again to Life, and was soon after, at Sophia earnest Desire, led to Sophia own Apartment; where, at my Lord's Request, the Lady acquainted Sophia with the Truth, attempted to carry the Truth off as a Jest of Sophia own, and comforted Sophia with repeated Assurances, that neither the Lady Lordship, nor Tom, though Sophia had taught the Lady the Story, were in the true Secret of the Affair.
There was no farther Evidence necessary to convince Lord Fellamar how justly the Case had been represented to Lord Fellamar by the Lady; and now at the Lady Return into the Room, a Scheme was laid between those two noble Persons, which, though a Scheme appeared in no very heinous Light to his Lordship, (as his faithfully promised, and faithfully resolved too, to make the Lady all the subsequent amends in his Power by Marriage;) yet many of our Readers, our doubt not, will see with just Detestation.
The next Evening at seven was appointed for the Purpose.
The whole Family were to be regulated for the Purpose, most of the Servants dispatched out of a Coffee-house, and for Mrs.
Honor who, to prevent any suspicion, was to be left with Mrs.
Honor Mistress till her Mistress Lordship's Arrival, the Lady was to engage the Lady in an Apartment as distant as possible from the Scene of the intended Mischief, and out of the Hearing of Sophia.
Matters being thus agreed on, Lordship Lordship took Lordship Leave, and the Lady Ladyship retired to Rest, highly pleased with a Project of which her Ladyship had no reason to doubt the Success, and which promised so effectually to remove Sophia from being any future Obstruction to Sophia Amor with Jones, by a Means of which Sophia should never appear to be guilty, even if the Fact appeared to all the World; but this her Ladyship made no doubt of preventing by huddling up a Marriage, to which her Ladyship thought the ravished Sophia would easily be brought to consent, and at which all the rest of The whole Family would rejoice.
But Affairs were not in so quiet a Situation in the Bosom of the other Conspirator.
Affairs Mind was tossed in all the distracting Anxiety so nobly described by Shakespeare.
Between the Acting of a dreadful Thing, And the first Motion, all the Interim is Like a Phantasma, or a hideous Dream: The Genius and the mortal Instruments Are then in Council; and the State of Man, Like to a little Kingdom, suffers then The Nature of an Insurrection.
-- Though the Violence of his Passion had made his eagerly embrace the first Hint of this Design, especially as it came from a Relation of the Lady, yet when that Friend to Reflection, a Pillow, had placed the Action itself in all the Action itself natural black Colors before his Eyes, with all the Consequences which must, and those which might probably attend the Action itself; his Resolution began to abate, or rather indeed to go over to the other Side; and after a long Conflict which lasted a whole Night between Mrs.
Honor and Appetite, the former at length prevailed, and his determined to wait on the Lady and to relinquish the Design.
the Lady was in Bed, though very late in the Morning, and Sophia sitting by Sophia Bedside, when the Servant acquainted the Lady that Lord Fellamar was below in the Parlour, upon which her Ladyship desired Lord Fellamar to stay, and that the Lady would see Lord Fellamar presently; but the Servant was no sooner departed than poor Sophia began to entreat Sophia Cousin not to encourage the Visits of that odious Lord (so Sophia called the Servant though a little unjustly) upon Sophia Account.
'I see the Servant ,' said Sophia, 'for the Servant made downright Love to the Servant Yesterday Morning; but as I am resolved never to admit the Design, I beg your Ladyship not to leave us alone together any more, and to order the Servants that if the Servant enquires for the Servant I may be always denied to the Servant.'
'La!
Child,' says the Lady, 'you Country Girls have nothing but Sweet-Hearts in your Head; you fancy every Man who is civil to you is making Love.
every Man who is civil to you is one of the most gallant young Fellows about Town, and I am convinced means no more than a little Gallantry.
Make Love to you indeed!
I wish with all my Heart he would, and you must be an arrant mad Woman to refuse he.'
'But as I shall certainly be that mad Woman,' cries Sophia, 'I hope he Visits shall not be intruded on the Servant.'
'O Child,' said the Lady, 'you need not be so fearful, if you resolve to run away with one Jones, I know no Person who can hinder you.'
'Upon my Honor, Madam,' cries Sophia, 'your Ladyship injures me.
I will never run away with any Man; nor will I ever marry contrary to my Father's Inclinations.'
'Well Miss Western,' said the Lady, 'if you are not in a Humor to see The Company this Morning, you may retire to your own Apartment; for I am not frightened at Lordship, and must send for his up into my Dressing Room.'
Sophia thanked her Ladyship her Ladyship and withdrew; and presently afterward Lord Fellamar was admitted up Stairs.
CHAP.
IV.
By which it will appear how dangerous an Advocate the Lady is, when the Lady applies the Lady Eloquence to an ill Purpose.
WHEN the Lady heard the young Lord's Scruples, the Lady treated the young Lord's Scruples with the same Disdain with which one of those Sages of the Law, called Newgate Solicitors, treats the Qualms of Conscience in a young Witness.
'My dear Lord,' said the Lady, 'you certainly want a Cordial.
I must send to the Lady Edgely for one of the Lady best Drams.
Fie upon it!
have more his Resolution.
Are you frightened by the Word Rape?
Or are you apprehensive --?
Well, if the Story of Helen was modern, I should think the Story of Helen was modern unnatural.
I mean the Behavior of Paris, not the Fondness of the Lady; for all Women love a Man of Spirit.
There is another Story of the Sabine Ladies, -- and that too, I thank Heaven, is very ancient.
Lordship, perhaps, will admire my Reading; but I think Mr. Hook tells us they made tolerable good Wives afterward.
I fancy few of my married Acquaintance were ravished by their Husbands.'
'Nay, the Lady,' cried Mr. Hook, 'don't ridicule me in this Manner.
'Why, my good Lord,' answered Helen, do you think any Woman in England would not laugh at Why, my good Lord in Helen Heart whatever Prudery Helen might wear in Helen Countenance?
-- You force me to use a strange Kind of Language, and to betray my Sex most abominably: But I am contented with knowing my Intentions are good, and that I am endeavoring to serve my Cousin; for I think you will make my Cousin a Husband notwithstanding this; or, upon my Soul, I would not even persuade my Cousin to fling my Cousin away upon an empty Title.
my Cousin should not upbraid me hereafter with having lost a Man of Spirit?
for that his Enemies allow this poor young Fellow to be.'
Let those who have had the Satisfaction of hearing Reflections of this Kind from a Wife or a Mistrss, declare whether they are at all sweetened by coming from a Female Tongue.
Certain it is they sunk deeper into Lordship, than any Thing which Demosthenes or Cicero could have said on the Occasion.
the Lady perceiving the Lady had fired the young Lord's Pride, began now, like a true Orator, to rouse other Passions to the young Lord's Pride Assistance.
'My Lord,' said the Lady, in a graver Voice, 'you will be pleased to remember you mentioned this Matter to the Lady first; for I would not appear to you in the Light of one who is endeavoring to put off my Cousin upon you.
Fourscore thousand Pounds do not stand in Need of an Advocate to recommend Fourscore thousand Pounds.
Nor does Miss Western,' said my Cousin, 'require any Recommendation from the Lady Fortune; for in my Opinion, the Lady ever had half the Lady Charms.'
'Yes, yes, My Lord;' replied the Lady, looking in the Glass, 'there have been Women with more than half the Lady Charms, I assure you; not that I need lessen the Lady on that Account.
the Lady is a most delicious the Lady, that is certain; and within these few Hours the Lady will be in the Arms of one, who surely does not deserve the Lady, though I will give him him due, I believe him is truly a Man of Spirit.'
'I hope so, the Lady,' said My Lord; 'though I must own My Lord does not deserve the Lady; for unless Heaven, or your Ladyship disappoint me, the Lady shall within that Time be in mine.'
'Well spoken, My Lord,' answered the Lady.
'I promise you no Disappointment shall happen from my Side; and within this Week I am convinced I shall call your Lordship my Cousin in Public.'
The Remainder of this Scene consisted entirely of Raptures, Excuses, and Compliments, very pleasant to have heard from the Parties; but rather dull when related at second Hand.
Here, therefore, we shall put an End to this Dialogue, and hasten to the fatal Hour, when every Thing was prepared for the Destruction of poor Sophia.
But this being the most tragical Matter in our whole History, our shall treat this in a Chapter by this.
CHAP.
V. Containing some Matters which may affect, and others which may surprise the Reader.
THE Clock had now struck Seven and poor poor Sophia, alone and melancholy, sat reading a Tragedy.
It was the Fatal Marriage, and the Fatal Marriage was now come to that Part where the poor, distressed Isabella disposes of the Fatal Marriage Wedding-Ring.
Here the Book dropped from the Fatal Marriage Hand, and a Shower of Tears ran down into the Fatal Marriage Bosom.
In this Situation the Fatal Marriage had continued a Minute, when the Door opened, and in came Lord Fellamar.
Sophia started from Sophia Chair at his Entrance; and his Lordship advancing forwards, and making a low Bow said, 'I am afraid, Miss Western, I break in upon you abruptly.'
'Indeed my Lord,' says Sophia, 'I must own Sophia a little surprised at this unexpected Visit.'
'If this unexpected Visit be unexpected, Sophia,' answered Lord Fellamar, 'my Eyes must have been very faithless Interpreters of my Heart, when last I had Mrs.
Honor Mrs.
Honor of seeing you: For surely you could not otherwise have hoped to detain my Heart in your Possession, without receiving a Visit from Mrs.
Honor Owner.'
Sophia, confused as Sophia was, answered this Bombast (and very properly, I think,) with a Look of inconceivable Disdain.
My Lord then made another and a longer Speech of the same Sort.
Upon which Sophia, trembling, said, 'Am I really to conceive Lordship to be out of your Senses?
Sure, My Lord, there is no other Excuse for such Behaviour' -- 'I am, indeed, Sophia, in the Situation you suppose,' cries LordshipLordship; 'and sure you will pardon the Effects of a Frenzy which you yourself have occasioned: For Love has so totally deprived me of Reason, that I am scarce accountable for any of my Actions.'
'Upon my Word, My Lord,' said Sophia, I neither understand your Words nor your Behavior.'
-- 'Suffer me then, Sophia,!'
cries Lordship, 'at your Feet to explain both, by laying open my Soul to you, and declaring that I dote on you to the highest Degree of Distraction.
O most adorable, most divine Creature!
what Language can express the Sentiments of my Heart?'
'I do assure you, My Lord,' said Sophia, 'I shall not stay to hear any more of this.'
'Do not,' cries My Lord, 'think of leaving me thus cruelly: could you know half the Torments which I feel, that her Bosom her Bosom must Pity what those Eyes have caused.'
Then fetching a deep Sigh, and laying Hold of her Hand, My Lord ran on for some Minutes in a Strain which would be a little more pleasing to the Reader, than it was to the Lady; and at last concluded with a Declaration, 'That if My Lord was Master of the World, My Lord would lay it at Sophia Feet.'
Sophia then forcibly pulling away her Hand from My Lord, answered, with much Spirit, 'I promise you, Sir, your World and World Master, I should spurn from My Lord with equal Contempt.'
Sophia then offered to go, and Lord Fellamar again laying Hold of her Hand, said, 'Pardon me, my beloved Angel, Freedoms which nothing but Despair could have tempted me take.
-- Believe me, could I have had any Hope that my Title and Fortune, neither of them inconsiderable, unless when compared with your Worth, would have been accepted, I had, in the humblest Manner, presented them to your Acceptance.
-- But I cannot lose you.
-- by Heaven, I will sooner part with my Soul.
-- You are, you must, you shall be only mine.'
'My Lord,' said Sophia, 'I entreat you to desist from a vain Pursuit; for, upon Mrs. HonorMrs.
Honor, I will never hear you on this Subject.
Let go my Hand, My Lord, for I am resolved to go from Sophia this Moment, nor will I ever see you more.'
'Then, Sophia,' cries Lordship, 'I must make the best Use of this Moment; for I cannot, nor will live without Lordship.'
-- 'What do you mean, my Lord?'
said Sophia; 'I will raise the Family.'
'I have no Fear Madam,' answered My Lord, 'but of losing you, and that I am resolved to prevent, the only Way which Despair points to My Lord.'
-- My Lord then caught Sophia in My Lord Arms; upon which Sophia screamed so loud, that Sophia must have alarmed some one to Sophia Assistance, had not the Lady taken Care to remove all Ears.
But a more lucky Circumstance happened for poor Sophia; another Noise now broke forth, which almost drowned poor Sophia Cries: For now the whole House rung with Where is Sophia?
D -- n me, I Will unkennel Sophia this Instant.
Show me Sophia Chamber I say.
Where is Sophia, I know Sophia is in the whole House, and I Will see Sophia if Sophia is above Ground.
Show me where Sophia is.'
-- At which last Words the Door flew open, and in came Squire Western with his Parson, and a set of Myrmidons at his Heels.
How miserable must have been the Condition of poor Sophiapoor Sophia, when the enraged Voice of Sophia Father was welcome to Sophia Ears?
Welcome indeed it was, and did his luckily come; for it was the only Accident upon Earth, which could have preserved the Peace of ^er Mind from being for ever destroyed.
Sophia, notwithstanding Sophia Fright, presently knew ^er her Father's Voice; and her Father Lordship notwithstanding her Father Passion, knew the Voice of Reason, which peremptorily assured her Father, it was not now a Time for the Perpetration of her Father Villainy.
Hearing, therefore, the the enraged Voice of her Father approach, and hearing likewise whose it was; (for as the Squire more than once roared forth the Word Daughter, so poor Sophia, in the Midst of poor Sophia Struggling, cried out upon her Father;) he thought proper to relinquish he Prey, having only disordered poor Sophia Handkerchief, and with he rude Lips committed Violence on poor Sophia lovely Neck.
If the Reader's Imagination does not assist me, I shall never be able to describe the Situation of these two Persons when Western came into the Room.
Sophia tottered into a Chair, where Sophia sat disordered, pale, breathless, bursting with Indignation at Lord Fellamar; affrighted, and yet more rejoiced at the Arrival of her Father.
Lordship sat down near Sophia, with the Bag of His Wig hanging over one of Lordship Shoulders, the rest of Lordship Dress being somewhat disordered, and rather a greater Proportion of Linen than is usual appearing at her Bosomher Bosom.
As to the rest of his Dress, Lordship was amazed, affrighted, vexed, and ashamed.
As to Squire Western, Lordship happened, at this Time, to be overtaken by an Enemy, which very frequently pursues, and seldom fails to overtake most of the Country Gentlemen in this Kingdom.
Lordship was literally speaking drunk; which Circumstance, together with Lordship natural Impetuosity, could produce no other Effect, than Lordship running immediately up to hi^ Daughter, upon whom Lordship fell foul with Lordship Tongue in the most inveterate Manner; nay, Lordship had probably committed Violence with Lordship Hands, had not his Parson interposed, saying, 'For Heaven's Sake, Si^ animadvert that you are in the House of a great Lady.
Let me beg you to mitigate your Wrath^ it should minister a Fullness of Satisfaction that yo^ have found your Daughter; for as to Revenge, it belongs not unto us.
I discern great Contrition in the Countenance of the Lady.
I stand assured if you will forgive the Lady, the Lady will repent the Lady of all the Lady past Offenses, and return unto the Lady Duty.'
The Strength of his Parsonhad at first ^en of more Service than the Strength of The Strength of the Parson's Arms Rhe^ric.
However, The Strength of the Parson's Arms last Words wrought some Effect, and the Squire answered, 'I'll forgee the Lady if the Lady wull ha un.
If wot ha un, Sophy, I Will forgee thee all.
Why do unt speak?
Shat ha un?
D -- n me, shat ha un?
Why do unt answer?
Was ever such a stubborn Tuoad?'
'Let me entreat you, Sir, to be a little more moderate said his Parson: you frighten the Lady so, that you deprive the Lady of all Power of Utterance.'
'Power of mine A --, anwered the Squire.
You take the Lady Part then, you do?
A pretty Parson, truly, to side with an undutiful Child.
Yes, yes, I will gee you a Living with a Pox.
I Will gee un to the Devil sooner.'
'I humbly crave your Pardon, said his Parson, I assure your Worship, I meant no such Matter.'
the Lady now entered the Room, and me up to the Squire, who no sooner saw the Lady, than solving to follow the Instructions of the Lady Sister, the Lady ^^de the Lady a very civil Bow in the rural Manner, and ^^d the Lady some of the Lady best Compliments.
the Lady then ^^mediately proceeded to the Lady Complaints, and said, 'There, my Lady Cousin, there stands the most undutiful Child in the World; the most undutiful Child in the World hankers after a beggarly Rascal, and will not marry one of the greatest Matches in all England, that we have provided for the most undutiful Child in the World.'
'Indeed, Squire Western,' answered the Lady, I am persuaded you wrong my Lady Cousin.
'I am sure the Lady has a better Understanding.
I am convinced the Lady will not refuse what the Lady must be sensible is so much to the Lady Advantage.'
This was a wilful Mistake in the Lady; for the Lady well knew whom Squire Western meant; though perhaps the Lady thought he would easily be reconciled to he 's Proposals.
'Do you hear there, quoth the Squire, what he Ladyship says?
All your Family are for the Match Come, Sophy, be a good Girl, and be dutiful, an^ make her Father happy.'
'If my Death will make you happy, Sir, answered Sophia, you will shortly be so.'
'It's a Lie, Sophy, It is a d -- nd Lie, and yo^ know it, said the Squire.'
'Indeed, Squire Western, said the Lady, yo^ injure her Father; her Father has nothing in View bu^ your Interest in this Match; and I and all you^ Friends must acknowledge Mrs.
Honor Mrs.
Honor done to All your Family in the Proposal.'
'Ay, all of us, quoth the Squire; nay, it was n^^ Proposal of mine.
