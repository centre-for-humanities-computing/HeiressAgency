 'It's very well, Sir, said my Lord, I shall make ^^ Disturbance before the Ladies. I am very well ^^tisfied. Your humble Servant, Sir; Lady Bellaston, your most obedient.'  Your humble Servant, Sir; Lady Bellaston, your most obedient.'   Lordship was no sooner gone, than Lady Bel^^n coming up to Mr. Western, said, 'Bless me, ^r, what have you done? You know not whom ^ou have affronted; His Lordship is a Nobleman of the first ^^nk and Fortune, and Yesterday made Proposals ^ your Daughter; and such as I am sure you must ^^cept with the highest Pleasure.'  Answer for yourself, Lady Cousin, said the Squire, ^ will have nothing to do with any of your Lords. ^y Daughter shall have an honest Country Gen^^^man; 'I have pitched upon one for Daughter, -- and ^e shall have un, -- I am sorry for the trouble Daughter 'hath given your Ladyship with all my Heart.' Lady Bel^^n made a civil Speech upon the Word Trouble, to which the Squire the Squire answered, 'Why that is kind, -- and I would do as much for your Ladyship. To be sure Relations should do for one another. So I wish your Ladyship a good Night. -- Come, Daughter, you must go along with the Squire by fair Means, or I Will have you carried down to the Coach.'  ' Sophia said Sophia would attend the Coach without Force; but begged to go in a Chair, for Sophia said Sophia should not be able to ride any other Way.'  'Prithee, cries the Squire, wout unt persuade m^ can not ride in a Coach, would? That Is a pretty Thing surely, No, no, I Will never let thee ou^ of my Sight any more till art married, that I promise thee.' Sophia told art married Sophia saw art married was resolve to break Sophia Heart.' 'O break thy Heart and b^ d -- nd, quoth art married, if a good Husband will break i^ I don't value a Brass Varden, not a Halfpenny o^ any undutiful B -- upon Earth.' art married then took violently hold of Sophia Hand; upon which the Parso^ once more interfered, begging art married to use gentle Methods. At that the Squire thundered out a Curse, an^ bid the Parson hold an^ Tongue, saying, 'At'n't i^ Pulpit now? when art a got up there I never mi^ what do say; but I will not be Priest-ridde^ nor taught how to behave the Squire by thee. I wi^^ your Ladyship a good Night. Come along, Sophy, be a good Girl, and all shall be well, Shat ^^ un, d -- n me, shat ha un.'  Mrs. Honor appeared below Stairs, and with low Curtesy to the Squire, offered to attend Mrs. Honor Mi^tress; but the Squire pushed Mrs. Honor away, saying, 'Hold, M^dam, hold, you come no more near my House And will you take my Maid away from the Squire,' sa^ Sophia? 'Yes, indeed, Madam, will I, cries t^ the Squire; you need not fear being without a Se^+ vant, I will get you another Maid, and a better Maid than this, who, I Would lay five Pound to a Crown, is no more a another Maid than my Grannum. No, no, Sophy, Sophy shall contrive no more Escapes I promise you.' He then, packed up He Daughter and the Parson into the Hackney Coach, after which He ^ounted He, and ordered it to drive to He Lodg^ngs. In the Way thither He suffered sa^ Sophia to be ^uiet, and entertained He with reading a Lecture ^o the Parson on good Manners, and a proper Beha^iour to He Betters.  It is possible He might not so easily have carried ^ff He Daughter from Lady Bellaston, had that good Lady desired to have detained that good Lady; but in reality that good Lady was not a little pleased with the Confinement into which sa^ Sophia was going; and as that good Lady Project with Lord Fellamar had failed of Success, that good Lady was well ^ontented that other violent Methods were now go^^g to be used in Favor of another Man.  CHAP. VI. ^y what Means the Squire came to discover Means the Squire . THOUGH the Reader in many Histories is obliged to digest much more unaccountable Ap^arances than this of Mr. Western, without any Sa^^sfaction at all; yet as we dearly love to oblige Means the Squire ^henever it is in we Power, we shall now proceed ^ show by what Method the Squire discovered where ^s his Daughter from Lady Bellaston was.  In the third Chapter then of the preceding Book, ^e gave a Hint (for it is not we Custom to unfold at ^y Time more than is necessary for the Occasion) ^^at Mrs. Fitzpatrick, who was very desirous of re^^nciling herself to herself Uncle and Aunt Western, ^ought herself had a probable Opportunity by the Service ^ preserving Sophia from committing the same Crime which had drawn on herself the Anger of herself Family. After much Deliberation therefore herself resolved to inform herself Aunt Western where herself Cousin was, and accordingly her Cousin writ the following Letter, which we shall give the Reader at length for more Reasons than one.  Honored Madam, the Occasion of my writing this will perhaps make a Letter of mine agreeable to my dear Aunt, for the Sake of one of my dear Aunt Neices, though I have little Reason to hope it will be so on the account of another.  Without more Apology, as I was coming to throw my unhappy Self at your Feet, I met, by the strangest Accident in the World, my Cousin Sophy, whose History you are better acquainted with than myself, though, alas! I know infinitely too much; enough indeed to satisfy me, that unless she is immediately prevented, she is in Danger of running into the same fatal Mischief, which, by foolishly and ignorantly refusing your most wise and prudent Advice, I have unfortunately brought on myself.  I short, I have seen the Man, nay, I was most part of Yesterday in the Man Company, and a charming young Fellow I promise you the Man is. By the strangest Accident in the World the Man came acquainted with myself is too tedious to tell you now; but I have this Morning changed my Lodging to avoid the Man, lest the Man should by my Means discover my Cousin; for my Cousin does not yet know where my Cousin is, and it is advisable my Cousin should not till my Uncle has secured my Uncle. -- No Time therefore is to be lost, and I need only inform you, that my Cousin is now with Lady Bellaston, whom I have seen, and who has, I find a Design to conceal my Cousin from my Cousin Family. You know, my Cousin, my Cousin is a strange my Cousin; but nothing could misbecome me more, than to presume to give any Hint to one of your great Understanding and great Knowledge of the World, besides barely informing you of the Matter of Fact.  I hope, Madam, the Care which I have shown on this Occasion for the good of her Family, will recommend me again to the Favor of a Lady who has always exerted so much Zeal for the Honor and true Interest of us all; and that it may be a Means of restoring me to your Friendship, which has made so great a Part of my former, and is so necessary to my future Happiness. I am,  With the utmost Respect, Honored Madam, Your most dutiful obliged Neice, And most Obedient Humble Servant, Harriet Fitzpatrick.   Mrs. Western was now at Mrs. Western Brother's House, where Mrs. Western had resided ever since the Flight of Sophia, ^ order to administer Comfort to the poor Squire in ^is Affliction. Of this Comfort which Mrs. Western doled out ^^ this Comfort which she doled out in daily Portions, we have formerly given a ^pecimen.  Mrs. Western was now standing with Mrs. Western Back to the Fire, ^ad with a Pinch of Snuff in Mrs. Western Hand was dealing ^orth this daily Allowance of Comfort to the poor Squire while the poor Squire smoaked the poor Squire Afternoon Pipe, when Mrs. Western received the above Letter; which Mrs. Western had no sooner ^ad than Mrs. Western delivered it to the poor Squire, saying, 'There, the poor Squire, there is an Account of your lost Sheep. Fortune has again restored Mrs. Western to you, and if you will be governed by my Advice, it is possible you may preserve Mrs. Western yet.'  the poor Squire had no sooner read a Letter of mine than the poor Squire ^aped from the poor Squire Chair, threw the poor Squire Pipe into the Fire; ^d gave a loud Huzza for Joy. the poor Squire then summoned ^^ Servants, called for the poor Squire Boots, and ordered the ^evalier and several other Horses to be saddled, and ^at Parson Supple should be immediately sent for.  Having done this, the poor Squire turned to the poor Squire Sister, caught his Sister in the poor Squire Arms, and gave his Sister a close Embrace, saying, 'Zounds! you don't seem pleased, one would imagine you was sorry I have found his Sister.'  'Brother, answered his Sister, the deepest Politicians who see to the Bottom discover often a very different Aspect of Affairs, from what swims on the Surface. It is true indeed, Things do look rather less desperate than Things did formerly in Holland, when Lewis the fourteenth was at the Gates of Amsterdam; but there is a Delicacy required in this Matter, which you will pardon me, Brother, if ^ suspect you want. There is a Decorum to he used with a Woman of Figure, such as Lady Bellaston, Brother, which requires a Knowledge of the World superior, I am afraid, to yours.'  'his Sister, cries the poor Squire, I know you have no Opinion of my Parts; but I Will show you on this Occasion who is Fool. Knowledge quotha! I have not been in the Country so long without having some Knowledge of Warrants and the Law of the Land. I know I may take my own wherever can find it. Show me his Daughter from Lady Bellaston, and if don't know how to come at Daughter, I Will suffer you to call me Fool as long as I live. There be Justices o^ Peace in London, as well as in other Places.'  'I protest, cries Daughter, you make me tremble forth Event of this Matter, which if you will proceed b^ my Advice, you may bring to so good an Issue^ Do you really imagine, Brother, that the House o^ a Woman of Figure is to be attacked by Warran^ and brutal Justices of the Peace? I will inform yo^ how to proceed. As soon as you arrive in Tow^ and have got yourself into a decent Dress (for indeed, Brother, you have none at present sit to appear in) you must send your Compliments to Lad^ Bellaston, and desire Leave to wait on Lad^ Bellaston. Wh^ you are admitted to Daughter Presence, as you certainly will be, and have told Daughter your Story, and have made proper Use of my Name, (for I think you only just know one another by Sight, though you are Relations,) I am confident Daughter will withdraw Daughter Protection from my Niece, who has certainly imposed upon Daughter. This is the only Method. -- Justices of the Peace indeed! do you imagine any such Event can arrive to a Woman of Figure in a civilized Nation?'  'D -- n their Figures, cries the poor Squire; a pretty civilized Nation truly, where Women are above the Law. And what must I stand sending a Parcel of Compliments to a confounded Whore, that keeps away a Daughter from a Daughter own natural Father? I tell you, his Sister, I am not so ignorant as you think me. -- I know you would have Women above the Law, but it is all a Lie; I heard his Lordship say at 'Size, that no one is above the Law. But this of his Sister is the Law, I suppose.'  'Mr. Western, said Mr. Western, I think you daily improve in Ignorance. -- I protest you are grown an errant Bear.'  'No more a Bear than yourself, Sister Western, said the poor Squire. -- Pox! you may talk of your Civility an you will, I am sure you never show any to the poor Squire. I am no Bear, no, nor no Dog neither, though I know Somebody, that is something that begins with a B --, but -- Pox! I will show you I have a got more good Manners than some Folks.'  'Mr. Western, answered Mr. Western, you may say what you please, Je vous mesprise de tout mon Coeur. I shall not therefore be angry. -- Besides, as my Cousin with that odious Irish Name justly says, I have that Regard for the Honor and true Interest of her Family, and that concern for my Niece, who is a part of it, that I have resolved to go to Town myself upon this Occasion; for indeed, indeed, Brother, you are not a fit Minister to be employed at a polite Court. -- Greenland -- Greenland should always be the Scene of the Tramontane Negotiation.'  'I thank Heaven, cries the poor Squire, I don't understand you, now. You are got to your Hannoverian Linguo. However, I Will show you I scorn to be behind-hand in Civility with you; and as you are not angry for what I have said, so I am not angry for what you have said. Indeed I have always thought it a Folly for Relations to quarrel; and if they do now and then give a hasty Word, why People should give and take; for my Part I never bear Malice* and I take it very kind of you to go up to London, for I never was there but twice in my Life, and then I did not stay above a Fortnight at a Time; and to be sure I cannot be expected to know much of the Streets and the Folks in that Time. I never denied that you known'd all these Matters better than I. For me to dispute that would be all as one, as for you to dispute the Management of a Pack of Dogs or the finding a Hare sitting, with me. -- Which promise you, says Hare, I never will. -- Well, and promise you, returned Hare, that I never will dispute the the other.'  Here then a League was struck (to borrow a Phras^ from Mr. Western) between the contending Parties; an^ now the Parson arriving, and the Horses being ready the poor Squire departed, having promised his Sister his Sister to follow his Sister Advice, and his Sister prepared to follow the poor Squire the next Day.  But having communicated all these Matters to the Parson on the Road, they both agreed that the prescribe Formalities might very well be dispensed with; an^ the Squire having changed Squire Mind, proceeded in the Manner we have already seen.  CHAP. VII. In which various Misfortunes befall poor Jones. AFFAIRS were in the aforesaid Situation when Mrs. Honor arrrived at Mrs. Miller's, and called Jones out from the Company, as we have before seen, with whom, when Mrs. Honor found Mrs. Honor alone, Mrs. Honor began as follows.  'O my dear Sir, how shall I get Spirits to tell you; you are undone, Sir, and my poor Lady's undone, and I am undone.' 'Hath any thing happened to Sophia?' cries Jones, staring like a Madman. 'All that is bad, cries Mrs. Honor, O I shall never get such another Lady! O that I should ever live to see this Day!' At poor Jones turned pale as Ashes, rembled and stammered; but Mrs. Honor went on. 'O, Jones I have lost Mr. Western Lady for ever.' 'How! What! for Heaven's Sake tell me. -- O my dear Sophia! -- 'You may well call Mr. Western so, said Mrs. Honor, Mr. Western was Mr. Western to Mrs. Honor. -- I shall never have such another Place.' -- 'D -- n your Place,' ^ries Jones, 'where is? what! what is become of Sophia?' 'Ay, to be sure, cries Mr. Western, Servants may be d -- n'd. It signifies nothing what becomes of Servants, though Servants are turned away, and ruined ever so much. To be sure Servants are not Flesh and Blood like other People. No to be sure, it signifies nothing what becomes of Servants. -- 'If you have any Pity, any Compassion, JonesJones, I beg you will instantly tell me what has happened to Sophia?' 'To be sure I have more Pity for Sophia than you have for me, answered Mrs. Honor; I don't d -- n you because you have lost Mr. WesternLady . To be sure you are worthy to be pitied, and I am worthy to be pitied too: For to be sure if ever there was a good Mistress' -- 'What has happened,' cries Jones, in almost a raving Fit -- 'What? -- What? said Mrs. Honor! 'why the worst that could have happened both for you and for me. -- Her Father is come to. Town and has carried Her away from us both.' Here Jones fell on Jones Knees in Thanksgiving that it was no worse. -- 'No worse! repeated Mrs. Honor, what could be worse for either of us? Jones carried Her off, swearing Her should marry Mr. Blifil; that is for your Comfort? and for poor me, I am turned out of Doors.' 'Mrs. Honor, answered Jones you frightened me out of my Wits. I imagined some most dreadfuled sudden Accident had happened to Sophia; something, compared to which, even the seeing Sophia married to Blifil would be a Trifle; but while there is Life, there are Hopes, my dear Honor. Women in the Land cannot be married by actual brutal Force.' 'To be sure, Sir, said Sophia, 'that's true. There may be some Hopes for Sophia; but alack-a-day! what Hopes are there for poor me? And to be sure, Sir, you must be sensible I suffer all this upon your Account. All the Quarrel the poor Squire has to me is for taking your Part, as I have done, against Mr. Blifil.' 'Mrs. Honor, answered Mrs. Honor, 'I am sensible of my Obligations to Mrs. Honor, and will leave nothing in my Power undone to make you amends.' 'Alas, Sir, said she, what can make a Servant amends. for the Loss of one Place, but the getting another altogether as good!' -- 'Do not despair, Mrs. Honor, said Jones, 'I hope to reinstate you again in the same.' 'Alack-a-day, Sir, said she, how can I flatter me with such Hopes, when I know it is a Thing impossible; for the poor Squire is so set against me: and yet if you should ever have Mr. Western, as to be sure I now hopes heartily you will; for you are a generous good natured Gentleman, and I am sure you loves she, and to be sure she loves you as dearly as she own Soul; it is a Matter in vain to deny it; because as why, every Body that is in the least acquainted with Mr. Western, must see it; for, poor dear Lady, Mr. Western cannot dissemble; and if two People who loves one another a'n't happy, why who should be so? Happiness don't always depend upon what People has; besides, Mr. Western Mr. Western has enough for both. To be sure therefore as one may say, it would be all the Pity in the World to keep two such Loviers asunder; nay, I am convinced for my Part, you will meet together at last; for if it is to be, there is no preventing it. If a Marriage is made in Heaven, all the Justices of Peace upon Earth cannot break all the Justices of Peace upon Earth off. To be sure I wishes that Parson Supple had but a little more Spirit to tell the Squire of Squire Wickedness in endeavoring to force Squire Daughter contrary to his Daughter Liking; but then Squire whole Dependence is on the poor Squire, and so the poor Gentleman, though Squire is a very religious good sort of Man, and talks of the Badness of such Doings behind the poor Squire's Back, yet the poor Squire dares not say the poor Squire Soul is the poor Squire own to the poor Squire Face. To be sure I never saw the poor Squire make so bold as just now, I was afeard the poor Squire the poor Squire would have struck the poor Squire. -- I would not have Mrs. Honor Mrs. Honor be melancholy, Sir, nor despair; Things may go better, as long as you are sure of Mr. Western, and that I am certain you may be, for Mr. Western never will be brought to consent to marry any other Man. Indeed, I am terribly afeard the poor Squire will do Mr. Western a Mischief in the poor Squire Passion: For the poor Squire is a prodigious passionate Gentleman, and I am afeard too Mr. Western Mr. Western will be brought to break Mr. Western Heart, for Mr. Western is as tenderhearted as a Chicken; it is pity methinks, Mr. Western had not a little of my Courage. If I was in Love with a young Man, and Her Father offered to lock me up, I Would tear a young Man Eyes out, but I Would come at a young Man; but then there is a great Fortune in the Case, which it is in Her Father's Power either to give Mr. Western, or not; that, to be sure, may make some Difference.'  Whether Jones gave strict Attention to all the foregoing Harangue, or whether it was for want of any Vacancy in the Discourse, I cannot determine; but Jones never once attempted to answer, nor did Mr. Western once stop, till Partridge came running into the Room, and informed Jones that Mr. Western Mr. Western was upon the Stairs.  Nothing could equal the Dilemma to which Jones was now reduced. Mrs. Honor knew nothing of any Acquaintance that subsisted between Acquaintance and Lady Bellaston, and Lady Bellaston was almost the last Person in the World to whom Acquaintance would have communicated it. In this Hurry and Distress, Acquaintance took (as is common enough) the worst Course, and instead of exposing Lady Bellaston to the Lady, which would have been of little Consequence, Acquaintance chose to expose Mr. Western to Mr. Western; Acquaintance therefore resolved to hide Honor, whom Acquaintance had but just time to convey behind the Bed, and to draw the Curtains.  The Hurry in which Jones had been all Day engaged on Account of Jones poor Landlady and Landlady Family, the Terrors occasioned by Mrs. Honor, and the Confusion into which Jones was thrown by the sudden Arrival of Lady Bellaston, had altogether driven former Thoughts out of former Thoughts Head; so that it never once occurred to former Thoughts Memory to act the Part of a sick Man; which indeed, neither the Gayety of former Thoughts Dress, nor the Freshness of former Thoughts Countenance would have at all supported.  former Thoughts received her Ladyship therefore rather agreeably to her Desires than to her Expectations, with all the good Humor former Thoughts could muster in his Countenance, and without any real or affected Appearance of the least Disorder.  Lady Bellaston no sooner entered the Room, than Lady Bellaston squatted Lady Bellaston down on the Bed: 'So, my dear Jones,' said Lady Bellaston, you find nothing can detain me long from Lady Bellaston. Perhaps I ought to be angry with Lady Bellaston, that I have neither seen nor heard from you all Day; for I perceive your Distemper would have suffered you to come abroad; Nay, I suppose you have not sat in your Chamber all Day dressed up like a fine Mr. Western to see Company after a Lying-in; but however, don't think I intend to scold you: For I never will give you an Excuse for the cold Behavior of a Husband, by putting on the ill Humor of a Wife.'  'Nay, Lady Bellaston,' said Jones, 'I am sure her Ladyship will not upbraid me with neglect of Duty, when I only waited for Orders. Who, my dear Creature, has Reason to complain? Who missed an Appointment last Night, and left an unhappy Man to expect, and wish, and sigh, and languish?'  'Do not mention it, Jones,' cries Lady Bellaston. 'If you knew the Occasion, you would pity me. In short, it is impossible to conceive what Women of Condition are obliged to suffer from the Impertinence of Fools, in order to keep up the Farce of the World. I am glad however, all your languishing and wishing have done you no harm: for you never looked better in your Life. Upon my Faith! Jones, you might at this Instant sit for the Picture of Adonis.'  There are certain Words of Provocation which ^^en of Mrs. Honor hold can only properly be answered ^y a Blow. Among Lovers possibly there may be ^ome Expressions which can only be answered by a Kiss. The Compliment which Lady Bellaston now made Jones seems to be of this Kind, especially as ^t was attended with a Look in which Mr. Western con^eyed more soft Ideas than it was possible to express with Mr. Western Tongue.  Jones was certainly at this Instant in one of the most disagreeable and distressed situations imaginable; ^or to carry on the Comparison we made use of before, though the Provocation was given by Mr. Western, ^ones could not receive Satisfaction, nor so much as ^ffer to ask it, in the Presence of a third Person; Seconds in this kind of Duels not being according to the Law of Arms. As this Objection did not occur to Lady Bellaston, who was ignorant of any other Woman being there but Woman, Woman waited some time in great Astonishment for an Answer from Jones, who conscious of the ridiculous Figure he made, stood at a Distance, and not daring to give the proper Answer, gave none at all. Nothing can be imagined more comic, nor yet more tragical than this Scene would have been, if this Scene had lasted much longer. Mr. Western Mr. Western had already changed Color two or three times; had got up from the Bed and sat down again, while Jones was wishing the Ground to sink under Jones, or the House to fall on his Head, when an odd Accident freed Jones from an Embarassment out of which neither the Eloquence of Cicero, nor the Politics of a Machiavel could have delivered Jones, without utter Disgrace.  This was no other than the Arrival of young Nightingale dead drunk; or rather in that State of Drunkenness which deprives Men of the Use of Men Reason, without depriving Men of the Use of Men Limbs.  Mrs. Miller and her Daughters were in the Bed, and Partridge was smoking Partridge Pipe by the Kitchen Fire; so that Partridge arrived at Jones's Chamber Door without any Interruption. This Partridge burst open, and was entering without any Ceremony, when Jones started from Jones Seat, and ran to oppose Jones; which Jones did so effectually, that young Nightingale never came far enough within Mr. Jones's Chamber Door to see who was sitting on the Bed.  young Nightingale had in Reality mistaken Jones's Apartment for that in which Jones had lodged; Jones therefore strongly insisted on coming in, often swearing that Jones would not be kept from Jones own Bed. Jones however, prevailed over Jones, and delivered Jones in to the Hands of Partridge, whom the Noise on the Stairs soon summoned to Jones Master's Assistance.  And now Jones was unwillingly obliged to return to Jones own Apartment, where at the very Instant of Jones Entrance Jones heard Lady Bellaston venting an Exclamation, though not a very loud one; and at the same time, saw Lady Bellaston flinging Lady Bellaston into a Chair in a vast Agitation, which in a Lady of a tender Constitution would have been an Hysteric Fit.  In reality Mr. Western, frightened with the Struggle between the two Men, of which Lady Bellaston did not know what would be the Issue, as Lady Bellaston heard young Nightingale swear many Oaths Oaths would come to Oaths , attempted to retire to Lady Bellaston known Place of Hiding, which to Lady Bellaston great Confusion Lady Bellaston found already occupied by another.  'Is this Usage to be borne, Jones?' cries Mr. Western, ' -- basest of Men! -- What Wretch is this to whom you have exposed me?' 'Wretch!' cries Honor, bursting in a violent Rage from Lady Bellaston Place of Concealment -- 'marry come up! -- 'Wretch forsooth! -- As poor a Wretch as I am, I am honest, that is more than some Folks who are richer can say.' Jones, instead of applying Jones directly to take off the Edge of Mrs. Honor's Resentment, as a more experienced Gallant would have done, fell to cursing Jones Stars, and lamenting Jones as the most unfortunate Man in the World; and presently after, addresing Jones to Lady Bellaston, Jones fell to some very absurd Protestations of Innocence. By this time Mr. Western having recovered the Use of Mr. Western Reason, which Jones had as ready as any Woman in the World, especially on such Occasions, calmly replied; 'Jones, you need make no Apologies, I see now who the Person is; I did not at first know Mrs. Honor; but now I do, I can suspect nothing wrong between Mrs. Honor and you; and I am sure Mrs. Honor is a Woman of too good Sense to put any wrong Constructions upon my Visits to Jones; I have been always Mrs. Honor Friend, and it may be in my Power to be much more so hereafter.'  Mrs. Honor was altogether as placable, as Mrs. Honor was passionate. Hearing therefore Lady Bellaston assume the soft Tone, Mrs. Honor likewise softened here is. -- 'I'm sure, Mrs. Honor,' said Mrs. Honor, 'I have been always ready to acknowledge your Ladyship's Friendships to me; sure I never had so good a Friend as her Ladyship -- and to be sure now I see it is her Ladyship that I spoke to, I could almost bite my Tongue off for very mad. -- I Constructions upon her Ladyship -- to be sure it does not become a Servant as I am to think about such a great Lady -- I mean I was a Servant: for indeed I am no Body's Servant now, the more miserable Wretch is me. -- I have lost the best Mistress.' -- Here Mrs. Honor thought fit to produce a Shower of Tears. -- ' 'Don't cry, the best Mistress.' says the good Lady, 'Ways perhaps my be found to make you amends. Come to me tomorrow Morning.' Mrs. Honor then took up Mrs. Honor Fan which lay on the Ground, and without even looking at Jones, walked very majestically out of the Room; there being a kind of Dignity in the Impudence of Women of Quality, which their Inferiors vainly aspire to attain to in Circumstances of this Nature.  Jones followed Mrs. Honor down Stairs, often offering Mrs. Honor Jones Hand, which Mrs. Honor absolutely refused Jones, and go^ into Mrs. Honor Chair without taking any Notice of Jones as Jones stood bowing before Mrs. Honor.  At Jones Return up Stairs, a long Dialogue past between Jones and Mrs. Honor, while Mrs. Honor was adjusting Mrs. Honor after the Discomposure Mrs. Honor had undergone. The Subject of this was Jones Infidelity to Mrs. Honor ; on which Mrs. Honor enlarged with great Bitterness but Jones at last found means to reconcile Mrs. Honor, and not only so, but to obtain a Promise of most inviolable Secrecy, and that Mrs. Honor would the next Morning endeavor to find out Sophia, and bring Jones a further Account of the Proceedings of the Squire.  Thus ended this unfortunate Adventure to the Satisfaction only of Mrs. Honor; for a Secret (as some of my Readers will perhaps acknowledge from Experience) is often a very valuable Possession; and that not only to those who faithfully keep Thus ended this unfortunate Adventure to the Satisfaction only of Mrs. Honor; for a Secret (as some of my Readers will perhaps acknowledge from Experience), but sometimes to such as whisper Thus ended this unfortunate Adventure to the Satisfaction only of Mrs. Honor; for a Secret (as some of my Readers will perhaps acknowledge from Experience) about till it comes to ^he Ears of every one, except the ignorant Person, who pays for the supposed concealing of what is publicly known.  CHAP. VIII. Short and sweet. NOTWITHSTANDING all the Obligations she had received from Jones, Mrs. Miller could ^ot forbear in the Morning some gentle Remonstrances for the Hurricain which had happened the preceding Night in Mrs. Miller Chamber. These were however so gen^le and so friendly; professing, and indeed truly, to ^im at nothing more than the real good of Mr. Jones himself, that Mr. Jones himself far from being offended, thankfully ^eceived the Admonition of the good Woman, ex^ressed much Concern for what had past, excused it ^s well as Mr. Jones himself could, and promised never more to bring Mr. Jones himself same Disturbances into the House.  But though Mrs. Miller did not refrain from a ^hort Expostulation in private at their first meeting, ^et the Occasion of Mr. Jones himself being summoned down Stairs that Morning was of a much more agreeable Kind; ^eing indeed to perform the Office of a Father to Miss Nancy, and to give the Office of a Father to Miss Nancy in Wedlock to Mr, Nightingale, who was now ready dressed, and full as sober ^s many of my Readers will think a Man ought to ^e who receives a Wife in so imprudent a Man^er.  And here perhaps it may be proper to account for the Escape which this young Gentleman had made from this young Gentleman Uncle, and for this young Gentleman Appearance in the Condition in which we have seen this young Gentleman the Night before.  Now when his Uncle had arrived at his Uncle Lodgings with his Uncle Nephew, partly to indulge his Uncle own Inclinations (for his Uncle dearly loved his Uncle Bottle) and partly to disqualify his Nephew from the immediate Execution of his Uncle Purpose, his Uncle ordered Wine to be set on the Table; with which his Uncle so briskly plied this young Gentleman; that this latter, who though not much used to Drinking, did not detest it so as to be guilty of Disobedience or of want of Complaisance by refusing, was soon completely finished.  Just as his Uncle had obtained this Victory, and was preparing a Bed for his Nephew, a Messenger arrived with a Piece of News, which so entirely disconcerted and shocked his Uncle, that his Uncle in a Moment lost all Consideration for his Nephew, and his Uncle whole Mind became entirely taken up with his Nephew own Concerns.  This sudden and afflicting News was no less than that his Nephew Daughter had taken the Opportunity of almost the first Moment of his Nephew Absence, and had gone off with a Neighboring young Clergyman; against whom though his Daughter Father could have had but one Objection, namely, that his Nephew was worth nothing, yet his Daughter had never thought proper to communicate his Daughter Amoun^ even to her Father; and so artfully his Daughter managed, that even to that Father had never been once suspected by any, till now that even to that Father was consummated.  young Nightingale no sooner received this Account, than in the utmost Confusion young Nightingale ordered a Post-Chaise to be instantly got ready, and having recommended his Nephew to the Care of a Servant, his Nephew directly left the House, scarce knowing what his Nephew did, nor whither his Nephew went.  his Uncle being thus departed, when a Servant came to attend his Nephew to Bed, had waked his Nephew for that Purpose, and had at last made his Nephew sensible that his Nephew his Uncle was gone, his Uncle, instead of accepting the kind Offices tendered his Uncle, insisted on a Chair being called; with this the Servant, who had received no strict Orders to the contrary, readily complied; and thus being conducted back to the HouseMrs. Miller, his Nephew had staggered up to his Chamber, as has been before recounted.  This Bar of his Uncle being now removed (though young Nightingale young Nightingale knew not as yet in what Manner) and all Parties being quickly ready, the Mother Mr. Jones, Mr. Nightingale, and young Nightingale Love stepped into a Hackney-Coach, which conveyed young Nightingale to Doctor's Commons; where Miss Nancy was, in vulgar Language, soon made an honest Woman, and the poor Mother became in the purest Sense of the Word, one of the happiest of all human Beings.  And now Jones having seen Jones good Offices to that poor Woman and Woman Family brought to a happy Conclusion, began to apply Jones to his own Concerns; but here lest many of my Readers should censure Jones Folly for thus troubling Jones with the Affairs of others, and lest some few should think Jones acted more disinterestedly than indeed Jones did, we think proper to assure we Reader, that Jones was so far from being unconcerned in this Matter, that Jones had ^ndeed a very considerable Interest in bringing it to that final Consummation.  To explain this seeming Paradox at once, Jones was one who could truly say with Jones in Terence, Homo sum: Nihil humani a me alienum puto. Jones was never an ^ndifferent Spectator of the Misery or Happiness of any one; and Jones felt either the one or the other in greater Proportion as Jones contributed to either. Jones could not therefore be the Instrument of raising a whole Family from the lowest State of Wretchedness to the highest Pitch of Joy without conveying great Felicity to Jones; more perhaps than worldly Men often purchase to Men by undergoing the most severe Labor, and often by wading through the deepest Iniquity.  Those Readers who are of the same Complexion with Jones will perhaps think this short Chapter contains abundance of Matter; while others may probably wish, short as it is, that it had been totally spared as impertinent to the main Design, which I suppose Those Readers who are of the same Complexion with him conclude is to bring Jones to the Gallows, or if possible, to a more deplorable Catastrophe.  CHAP. IX. Containing Love Letters of several Sorts. MR. Jones at MR Return Home, found Love Letters of several Sorts lying on MR Table, which MR luckily opened in the Order Love Letters of several Sorts were sent.  LETTER I. Surely I am under some strange Infatuation; I cannot keep my Resolutions a Moment, however strongly made or justly founded. Last Night I resolved never to see you more; this Morning I am willing to hear if you can, as you say, clear up this Affair. And yet I know that to be impossible. I have said every Thing to MR which you can invent. -- Perhaps not. Perhaps your Invention is stronger Come to MR therefore the Moment you receive this. If you can forge an Excuse, I almost promise you to believe you can forge an Excuse. Betrayed to -- I will think no more. -- Come to MR directly. -- This is the third Letter I have writ, the two former are burnt -- I am almost inclined to burn thi^ too -- I wish I preserve my Senses. -- Come to MR presently.   LETTER II. If you ever expect to be forgiven, or even suffered within my Doors, come to MR this instant.   LETTER III. I now find you was not at Home when my Notes came to your Lodgings. The Moment you receive this let me see you; -- I shall not stir out; nor shall any Body be let in but yourself. Sure nothing can detain you long.   Jones had just read over these three Billets when young Nightingale came into the Room. 'Well, Tom,' said young Nightingale, 'any News from Lady Bellaston, after last Night's Adventure?' (for it was now no Secret to any one in that House who Lady Bellaston was.) 'Lady BellastonLady Bellaston? answered Jones very gravely. -- 'Nay, TomTom,' cries young Nightingale, 'don't be so reserved to your Friends. Though I was too drunk to see young Nightingale last Night, I saw young Nightingale at the Masquerade. Do you think I am ignorant who the Queen of the Fairies is?' 'And did you really then know Lady Bellaston at the Masquerade?' said Jones. 'Yes, upon my Soul, did I,' said young Nightingale, 'and have given you twenty Hints of it since, though you seemed always so tender on that Point, that I would not speak plainly. I fancy, my Friend, by your extreme Nicety in this Matter, you are not so well acquainted with the Character of Lady Bellaston as with the Character of the Lady Person. Don't be angry Tom, but, upon my Honor, you are not the first young Fellow the Character of the Lady has debauched. the Character of the Lady Reputation is in no Danger, believe me.'  Though Jones had no Reason to imagine Lady Bellaston ^o have been of the vestal Kind when Jones Amor began, yet as his Amor was thoroughly ignorant of the Town and had very little Acquaintance in it, Jones had yet no Knowledge of that Character which is vulgarly called a Demirep; that is to say, a Woman that intrigues 'with every Man the Character of the Lady likes, under the Name and Appearance of Virtue; and who, though some over-nice Ladies will not be seen with the Character of the Lady, is visited (as some over-nice Ladies term it) by the whole Town; in short, whom every Body knows to be what no Body calls the Character of the Lady.  When Jones found, therefore, that young Nightingale was perfectly acquainted with Jones Intrigue, and began to suspect that so scrupulous a Delicacy as Jones had hitherto observed, was not quite necessary on the Occasion, Jones gave a Latitude to Jones Friend's Tongue, and desired Jones to speak plainly what Jones knew, on had ever heard of Lady Bellaston.  Nightingale, who in many other Instances, wa^ rather too effeminate in Jones Disposition, had a pretty strong Inclination to Tittle Tattle. Jones had no sooner, therefore, received a full Liberty of speaking from Jones, than Jones entered upon a long Narrative concerning Lady Bellaston: which, as it contained many Particulars highly to Lady Bellaston Dishonor, we have to^ great a Tenderness for all Women of Condition to repeat; we would cautiously avoid giving an Opportunity to the future Commentators on we Works of making any malicious Application; and of forcing we to be against we Will, the Author of Scandal which never entered into we Head.  Jones having very attentively heard all that young Nightingale had to say, fetched a deep Sigh, which the other observing, cried, 'Heyday! Why thou a^^ not in Love
