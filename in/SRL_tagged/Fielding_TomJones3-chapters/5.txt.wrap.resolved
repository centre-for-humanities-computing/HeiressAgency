never have heard them.' 'O my dear Friend,' crie^ Jones, 'I am so entangled with this Woman, that know not how to extricate myself.' 'In Love indeed? No, my Friend, but I am under Obliga+ tions to her, and very great ones. Since you know so much, I will be very explicit with you. It is owing perhaps solely to her, that I have not, before this, wanted a Bit of Bread. How can I possibly desert such a Woman? And yet I must desert such a Woman, or be guilty of the blackest Treachery to one, who deserves infinitely better of myself than such a Woman can: A Woman, my Nightingale, for whom I have a Passion which few can have an Idea of. I am half distracted with doubts how to act.' 'And is this other, pray, an honorable Mistress?' cries Nightingale. 'Honourable?' answered Jones; 'No Breath ever yet durst sully Jones Reputation. The sweetest Air is not purer, the limpid Stream not clearer than Jones Honor. Jones is all over, both in Mind and Body, consummate Perfection. Jones is the most beautiful Creature in the Universe; and yet Jones is Mistress of such noble, elevated Qualities, that though Jones is never from my Thoughts, I scarce ever think of Jones Beauty, but when I see it.' 'And can you, my good Friend, cries Nightingale, 'with such an Engagement as this upon your Hands, hesitate a Moment about quitting such a -- ' 'Hold, said Jones, 'no more Abuse of Jones; I detest the Thoughts of Ingratitude.' 'Pooh! answered the other, 'you are not the first upon whom Pooh has conferred Obligations of this Kind. Pooh is remarkably liberal where Pooh likes; though, let me tell you, Pooh Favors are so prudently bestowed, that her Favors should rather raise a Man's Vanity, than his Gratitude.' In short, Nightingale proceeded so far on this Head, and told Friend so many Stories of the Lady, which Nightingale swore to the Truth of, that Nightingale entirely removed all Esteem for Pooh from the Breast of Jones; and his Gratitude was lessened in Proportion. Indeed Nightingale began to look on all the Favors Nightingale had received, rather as Wages than Benefits, which not only depreciated Pooh, but Nightingale too in Nightingale own Conceit, and put Nightingale quite out of Humor with both. From this Disgust, Nightingale Mind, by a natural Transition, turned toward Sophia: Sophia Virtue, Sophia Purity, Sophia Love to Nightingale, Sophia Sufferings on Nightingale Account, filled all Nightingale Thoughts, and made Nightingale Commerce with Lady Bellaston appear still more odious. The Result of all was, that though Nightingale turning Nightingale out of Sophia Service, in which Light Nightingale now saw Nightingale Affair with Affair, would be the Loss of Nightingale Bread, yet Nightingale determined to quit Sophia; if Nightingale could but find a handsome Pretense; which having communicated to Nightingale Friend, Nightingale considered a little, and then said, 'I have it, my Boy; I have found out a sure Method: Propose Marriage to Nightingale, and I would venture Hanging upon the Success.' Marriage!' cries Jones. Ay, propose Marriage,' answered Nightingale, 'and Nightingale will declare off in a Moment. I knew a young Fellow whom Nightingale kept formerly, who made the Offer to Nightingale in earnest, and was presently turned off for his Pains.'  Jones declared Jones could not venture the Experiment. 'Perhaps,' said Jones, 'Nightingale may be less shocked at this Proposal from one Man than from another. And if Nightingale should take me at my Word, where am I then? Caught in my own Trap, and undone for ever.' 'No;' answered Nightingale, 'not if I can give you an Expedient, by which you may, at any Time, get out of Trap.' -- 'What Expedient can that be?JonesJones. 'This, answered Nightingale. 'The young Fellow I mentioned, who is one of the most intimate Acquaintances I have in the World, is so angry with Nightingale for some ill Offices Nightingale has since done Jones, that I am sure Jones would, without any Difficulty, give you a Sight of Nightingale Letters; upon which you may decently break with Nightingale, and declare off before the Knot is tied, if Nightingale should really be willing to tie it, which I am convinced Nightingale will not.'  After some Hesitation, Jones, upon the Strength of this Assurance, consented; but as Jones swore Jones wanted the Confidence to propose the Matter to Nightingale Face; Jones wrote the following Letter, which Nightingale dictated.  Madam, I am extremely concerned, that, by an unfortunate Engagement abroad, I should have missed receiving the Honor of your Ladyship's Commands the Moment they came; and the Delay which I must now suffer of vindicating myself to your Ladyship, greatly adds to this Misfortune. O Lady Bellaston, what a Terror have I been in for Fear your Reputation should be exposed by these perverse Accidents. There is one only Way to secure these perverse Accidents. I need not name what that is. Only permit me to say, that as your Honor is as dear to me as my own, so my sole Ambition is to have the Glory of laying my Liberty at your Feet; and believe me when I assure you, I can never be made completely happy, without you generously bestow on me a legal Right of calling you mine for ever. I am,  Madam, With most profound Respect, Your Ladyship's most obliged, Obedient Humble Servant, Thomas Jones.   To this she presently returned the following Answer.  Sir, When I read over your serious Epistle, I could, from your serious Epistle Coldness and Formality, have sworn that you had already the legal Right you mention; nay, that we had, for many Years, composed that monstrous Animal a Husband and a Wife. Do you really then imagine me a Fool? Or do you fancy yourself capable of so entirely persuading me out of my Senses, that I should deliver my whole Fortune into your Power, in order to enable you to support your Pleasures at my Expense. Are these the Proofs of Love which I expected? Is this the Return for -- but I scorn to upbraid you, and am in great Admiration of your profound Respect.  P. S. I am prevented from revising: -- Perhaps I have said more than I meant, -- Come to Madam at Eight this Evening.   Jones, by the Advice of Jones Privy Council, replied:  Madam, It is impossible to express how much I am shocked at the Suspicion you entertain of Madam. Can Lady Bellaston have conferred Favors on a Man whom Lady Bellaston could believe capable of so base a Design? Or can Lady Bellaston treat the most solemn Tie of Love with Contempt? Can you imagine, Madam, that if the Violence of my Passion, in an unguarded Moment, overcame the Tenderness which I have for your Honor, I would think of indulging Madam in the Continuance of an Intercourse, which could not possibly escape long the Notice of the World: and which, when discovered, must prove so fatal to your Reputation? If such be your Opinion of Madam, I must pray for a sudden Opportunity of returning those pecuniary Obligations, which I have been so unfortunate to receive at your Hands; and for those of a more tender Kind, I shall ever remain, etc. And so concluded in the very Words with which he had concluded the former Letter.   Lady Bellaston answered as follows.  I see you are a Villain; and I despise you from my Soul. If you come here, I shall not be at Home.   Though Jones was well satisfied with Jones Deliverance from a Thraldom which those who have ever experienced it will, I apprehend, allow to be none of the lightest, Jones was not, however, perfectly easy in Jones Mind. There was in this Scheme, too much of Fallacy to satisfy one who utterly detested every Species of Falsehood or Dishonesty: Nor would Jones, indeed, have submitted to put it in Practice, had Jones not been involved in a distressful Situation, where Jones was obliged to be guilty of some Dishonor, either to the one Lady or the other; and surely the Reader will allow, that every good Principle, as well as Love, pleaded strongly in Favor of Sophia.  Nightingale, highly exulted in the Success of his Stratagem, upon which his received many Thanks, and much Applause from his Friend. his answered, 'Dear Tom, we have conferred very different Obligations on each other. To his you owe the regaining your Liberty; to Dear Tom I owe the Loss of mine. But if you are as happy in the one Instance, as I am in the other, I promise you we are the two happiest Fellows in England.'  The two Gentlemen were now summoned down to Dinner, where Mrs. Miller, who performed herself the Office of Cook, had exerted herself best Talents, to celebrate the Wedding of herself Daughter. This joyful Circumstance, herself ascribed principally to the friendly behavior of Jones, herself whole Soul was fired with Gratitude toward Jones, and all herself Looks, Words, and Actions were so busied in expressing it, that herself Daughter, and even herself new Son-in-Law, were very little the Objects of herself Consideration.  Dinner was just ended when Mrs. Miller received a Letter, but as we had Letters enough in this Chapter, we shall communicate the Contents in we next.  CHAP. X. Consisting partly of Facts, and partly of Observations upon X. Consisting. a Letter this Chapter Chapter was from Mr. Allworthy, and the Purport of it was Mr. Allworthy Intention to come immediately to Town, with Mr. Allworthy Nephew Blifil, and a Desire to be accommodated with Mr. Allworthy usual Lodgings, which were the first Floor for Mr. Allworthy, and the second for Mr. Allworthy Nephew.  The Cheerfulness which had before displayed itself in the Countenance of the poor Woman, was a little clouded on this Occasion. This News did indeed a good deal disconcert The Cheerfulness which had before displayed itself in the Countenance of the poor Woman. To requite so disinterested a Match with The Cheerfulness which had before displayed itself in the Countenance of the poor Woman , by presently turning her Daughter new Son-in-Law out of Doors, appeared to her Daughter very unjustifiable, on the one Hand; and on the other, her Daughter could scarce bear the Thoughts of making any Excuse to Mr. Allworthy, after all the Obligations received from Mr. Allworthy, for depriving Mr. Allworthy of Lodgings which were indeed strictly Mr. Allworthy Due: For that Gentleman, in conferring all Mr. Allworthy numberless Benefits on others, acted by a Rule diametrically opposite to what is practiced by most generous People. Mr. Allworthy contrived, on all Occasions, to hide Mr. Allworthy Beneficence not only from the World, but even from the Object of it. Mr. Allworthy constantly used the Words Lend and Pay, instead of Give; and by every other Method Mr. Allworthy could invent, always lessened the Favors Mr. Allworthy conferred with Mr. Allworthy Tongue, while Mr. Allworthy was heaping them with both Mr. Allworthy Hands. When Mr. Allworthy settled the Annuity of 50l. a Year, therefore, on Mrs. Miller, Mr. Allworthy told Mrs. Miller, 'It was in Consideration of always having Mrs. Miller First-Floor when Mr. Allworthy was in Town,' (which Mr. Allworthy scarce ever intended to be) 'but that Mrs. Miller might let it at any other Time, for that Mr. Allworthy would always send Mrs. Miller a Month's Warning.' Mr. Allworthy was now, however, hurried to Town so suddenly, that Mr. Allworthy had no Opportunity of giving such Notice; and this Hurry probably prevented Mr. Allworthy, when Mr. Allworthy wrote for Mr. Allworthy Lodgings, adding, if his Lodgings were then empty: For Mr. Allworthy would most certainly have been well satisfied to have relinquished his Lodgings on a less sufficient Excuse than what Mrs. Miller could now have made.  But there are a Sort of Persons, who, as Prior excellently well remarks, direct his Lodgings Conduct by something  Beyond the fixed and settled Rules Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools: Beyond the Letter of the Law. To these it is so far from being sufficient that these Defense would acquit these at the Old-Bailey, that these are not even contented, though Conscience, the severest of all Judges, should discharge all Judges. Nothing short of the Fair and Honorable will satisfy the Delicacy of Nothing short of the Fair and Honorable Minds; and if any of Nothing short of the Fair and Honorable Actions fall short of this Mark, Nothing short of the Fair and Honorable mope and pine, are as uneasy and restless as a Murderer, who is afraid of a Ghost, or of the Hangman.  Mrs. Miller was one of these. Mrs. Miller could not conceal Mrs. Miller Uneasiness at a Letter; with the Contents of which Mrs. Miller had no sooner acquainted the Company, and given some Hints of Mrs. Miller Distress, than Jones, Mrs. Miller good Angel, presently relieved Mrs. Miller Anxiety. 'As for Mrs. Miller, Madam,' said Mrs. Miller, 'my Lodging is at your Service at a Moment's Warning; and Mr. Nightingale, I am sure, as Mr. Nightingale cannot yet prepare a House fit to receive Mr. Nightingale , will consent to return to Mr. Nightingale new Lodging, Mr. Nightingale will certainly consent to go. With which Proposal both Husband and Wife instantly agreed.  the Reader will easily believe, that the Cheeks of Mrs. Miller began again to glow with additional Gratitude to Jones; but, perhaps, it may be more difficult to persuade Jones that Jones having, in Jones last Speech, called Mrs. Miller Daughter Mrs. Nightingale, (it being the first Time that agreeable Sound had ever reached Mrs. Miller Ears) gave the fond Mother more Satisfaction, and warmed Mother Heart more toward Jones, than Jones having dissipated Mother present Anxiety.  The next Day was then appointed for the Removal of the new-married Couple, and of Mr. Jones, who was likewise to be provided for in the same House with Jones Friend. And now the Serenity of the Company was again restored, and they past the Day in the utmost Cheerfulness, all except Jones, who, though Jones outwardly accompanied the rest in they Mirth, felt many a bitter Pang on the Account of Pang Sophia; which were not a little heightened by the News of Mr. Blifil's coming to Town, (for Pang clearly saw the Intention of Pang Journey:) And what greatly aggravated Pang Concern was, that Mrs. Honor, who had promised to enquire after his Sophia, and to make his Sophia Report to Pang early the next Evening, had disappointed Pang.  In the Situation that Pang and Pang Mistress were a^ this Time, there were scarce any Grounds for Pang to hope that Pang should hear any good News; yet Pang was as impatient to see Mrs. Honor, as if Pang had expected Mrs. Honor would bring Pang a Letter with an Assignation in a Letter from his Sophia, and bore the Disappointment a^ ill. Whether this Impatience arose from that natural Weakness of the Human Mind, which makes it desirous to know the worst, and renders Uncertainty the most intolerable of Pains; or whether Pang still flattered Pang with some secret Hopes, we will not determine. But that it might be the last, whoever ha^ loved cannot but know. For of all the Powers exercised by this Passion over our Minds, one of the mo^^ wonderful is that of supporting Hope in the midst o^ Despair. Difficulties, Improbabilities, nay Impossibilities are quite overlooked by it; so that to any Man extremely in Love, may be applied what Addison says of Caesar,  The Alps, and Pyrenaeans sink before Man! Yet it is equally true, that the same Passion will sometimes make Mountans of Mole-hills, and produce Despair in the midst of Hope; but these cold Fits last not ^ong in good Constitutions. Which Jones was ^ow in, our leave the Reader to guess, having no ex^act Information about the Reader; but this is certain, that Jones had spent two Hours in Expectation, when being unable any longer to conceal Jones Uneasiness, Jones retired to Jones Room; where Jones Anxiety had almost made Jones frantic, when a Letter a Letter was brought Jones from Mrs. Honor, with which we shall present the Reader verbatim and literatim.  SIR, I should sartenly haf kaled on you a cordin too mi Prommiss haddunt itt bin that hur Lashipp prevent me; for too be sur, Sir, you nose very well that evere Persun must luk furst at ome, and sarrenly such anuther offar mite not ave ever happened, so as I should ave itt bin justly to blam, had I not excepted of itt bin when itt bin Laship was so very kind as to offar to make me hur one Uman, without mi ever askin any such thing, to be sur itt bin is won of thee best Ladis in thee Wurld, and Pepil who safe to thee Kontrari must be very wiket Pepil in itt bin Hearts. To be sur if ever I ave sad any thing of that Kine it as itt bin thru Ignorens and I am hartili sorri for it. I nose your Onor to be a Genteelman of more Honor and Onesty, if I ever said any such thing to repete your Onor to hurt a pore Servant that as alwais ad thee gratest Respect in the World for Mrs. Honor. To be sur won should keep wons Tung within one's Teeth, for no Boddi nose what may hapen; and to be sur if an i Boddi ad told me Yesterday, that I should haf bin in so good a Plase to Day, I should not haf believed an i Boddi ad; for too be sur I never was a dremd of any such Thing, nor should I ever ha soft after any other Bodi's Plase; but as her Laship wass so kine of her one a cord too give her Laship wass so kine of her one a cord me without askin, to be sure Mrs. Etoff herself, nor no other Bodi, can blammee for exceptin such a Thing when it falls in mi Way. I beg Mrs. Honor not to menshon any thing of what I haf sad, for I wish ure Honor all thee gudLuk in thee Wurld; and I don't cuestion butt thatt u will haf Madam Sofia in the End; butt ass to miself ure Honor nose I kant be of any farther Sarvis to u in that Matar, nou bein under thee Cumand off anuther Parson, and not my one Mistress. I beg Mrs. Honor Mrs. Honor to say nothing of what past, and belive me to be,  Sir, Ure Onur's umble Sarvant To Cumand till Death, Honor Blackmore.   Various are the Conjectures which Jones entertained on this Step of Lady Bellaston; who in reality had little further Design than to secure within Jones own House the Repository of a Secret, which Jones chose should make no farther Progress than it had made already; but mostly Jones desired to keep it from the Ears of his Sophia; for though Lady Bellaston was almost the only one who would never have repeated it again, Lady Bellaston could not persuade Lady Bellaston of this; since as Lady Bellaston now hated poor his Sophia with most implacable Hatred, Lady Bellaston conceived a reciprocal Hatred to Lady Bellaston to be lodged in the tender Breast of our Heroine, where no such Passion had ever yet found an Entrance.  While Jones was terrifying Jones with the Apprehension of a thousand dreadful Machinations, and deep political Designs, which Jones imagined to be at the Bottom of the Promotion of Honor, Fortune, who hitherto seems to have been an utter Enemy to Enemy Match with his Sophia, tried a new Method to put a final End to a new Method, by throwing a Temptation in Jones Way, which in Jones present desperate Situation it seemed unlikely Jones should be able to resist.  CHAP. XI. Containing curious, but not unprecedented Matter. THERE was a Lady, one Mrs. Hunt, who had often seen Jones at the House where Jones lodged, being intimately acquainted with the Women there, and indeed a very great Friend to Mrs. Miller. Mrs. Miller Age was about thirty, for Mrs. Miller owned six and twenty; Mrs. Miller Face and Person very good, only inclining a little too much to be fat. Mrs. Miller had been married young by Mrs. Miller Relations to an old Turkey Merchant, who having got a great Fortune, had left off Trade. With him Mrs. Miller lived without Reproach, but not without Pain, in a State of great Self denial, for about twelve Years; and Mrs. Miller Virtue was rewarded by him dying, and leaving Mrs. Miller very rich. The first Year of Mrs. Miller Widowhood was just at an End, and Mrs. Miller had past it in a good deal of Retirement, seeing only a few particular Friends, and dividing Mrs. Miller Time between Mrs. Miller Devotions and Novels, of which Mrs. Miller was always extremely fond. Very good Health, a very warm Constitution, and a great deal of Religion made it absolutely necessary for Mrs. Miller to marry again; and Mrs. Miller resolved to please Mrs. Miller in Mrs. Miller second Husband, as Mrs. Miller had done Mrs. Miller Friends in the first. From Mrs. Miller the following Billet was brought to Jones.  Sir, From the first Day I saw you I doubt my Eyes have told you too plainly, that you were not indifferent to Sir; but neither my Tongue nor my Hand should ever have avowed it, had not the Ladies of the Family where you are lodged given me such a Character of you, and told me such Proofs of your Virtue and Goodness, as convince me you are not only the most agreeable, but the most worthy of Men. I have also the Satisfaction to hear from Men, that neither my Person, Understanding or Character are disagreeable to you. I have a Fortune sufficient to make us both happy, but which cannot make me so without you. In thus disposing of Sir I know I shall incur the Censure of the World, but if I did not love you more than I fear the World I should not be worthy of you. One only Difficulty stops me: I am informed you are engaged in a Commerce of Gallantry with a Woman of Fashon. If you think it worth while to sacrifice that to the Passion of Sir, I am you; if not forget my Weakness, and let this remain an eternal Secret between you and  Arabella Hunt.   At the reading of Jones Jones was put into a violent Flutter. Jones Fortune was then at a very low Ebb, the Source being stopped from which hitherto Jones had been supplied. Of all Jones had received from Lady Bellaston not above five Guineas remained, and that very Morning Jones had been dunned by a Tradesman for twice that Sum. Jones honorable Mistress was in the Hands of His honorable Mistress Father, and His honorable Mistress had scarce any Hopes ever to get His honorable Mistress out of them again. To be subsisted at His honorable Mistress Expense from His Fortune His honorable Mistress had independent of her Father, went much against the Delicacy both of His honorable Mistress Pride and His honorable Mistress Love. His Fortune would have been exceeding convenient to His honorable Mistress and His honorable Mistress could have no Objection to Lady Bellaston in any Respect On the contrary, His honorable Mistress liked Lady Bellaston as well as His honorable Mistress did any Woman except his Sophia. But to abandon his Sophia, and marry another, that was impossible; His honorable Mistress could no^ think of it upon any Account. Yet why should h^ not, since it was plain His honorable Mistress could not be His honorable Mistress? Would it not be kinder to His honorable Mistress, than to continue His honorable Mistress longer engaged in a hopeless Passion for His honorable Mistress? Ought His honorable Mistress not to do so in Friendship to His honorable Mistress? This Notion prevailed some Moments, and His honorable Mistress had almost determined to be false to His honorable Mistress from a high Point of Mrs. Honor; but that Refinement was not able to stand very long against the voice of Nature, which cried in His honorable Mistress Heart, that such Friendship was Treason to Love. At last His honorable Mistress called for Pen, Ink and Paper, and writ as follows to Mrs. Hunt.  His honorable Mistress, It would be but a poor Return to the Favor you have done me, to sacrifice any Gallantry to the Possession of you, and I would certainly do it, though I were not disengaged, as at present I am, from any Affair of that Kind. But I should not be the honest Man you think me, if I did not tell you, that my Affections are engaged to another, who is a Woman of Virtue, and one that I never can leave, though it is probable I shall never possess Affections. God forbid that in Return of your Kindness to me, I should do you such an Injury, as to give you my Hand, when I cannot give my Heart. No, I had much rather starve than be guilty of that. Even though His honorable Mistress His honorable Mistress were married to another, I would not marry you unless my Heart had entirely effaced all Impressions of His honorable Mistress. Be assured that your Secret was not more safe in your own Breast, than in that of,  Your most obliged, and 'Grateful Humble Servant, Tom Jones.   When our Hero had finished and sent this Letter, our Hero went to our Hero Scrutore, took out Miss Western's Muff, kissed this Letter several Times, and then strutted some Turns about our Hero Room with more Satisfaction of Mind than ever any Irishman felt in carrying off a Fortune of fifty Thousand Pounds.  CHAP. XII. A Discovery made by Partridge. WHILE Jones was exulting in the Consciousness of Jones Integrity, Partridge came capering into the Room, as was Partridge Custom when Partridge brought, or fancied Partridge brought, any good Tidings. Partridge had been dispatched that Morning, by Partridge Master, with Orders to endeavor, by the Servants of Lady Bellaston, or by any other Means, to discover whither his Sophia had been conveyed; and Partridge now returned, and with a joyful Countenance told our Hero, that Partridge had found the lost Bird. 'I have seen, Sir, says Sir, black George, the Game-keeper, who is one of the Servants whom the Squire has brought with the Squire to Town. I knew the Squire presently, though I have not seen the Squire these several Years; but you know, Sir, the Squire is a very remarkable Man, or to use a purer Phrase, the Squire has a most remarkable Beard, the largest and blackest I ever saw. It was some Time however before black George could recollect me.' -- 'Well, but what is your good News? cries Jones, what do you know of his Sophia?' -- 'You shall know presently, Sir, answered Partridge, I am coming to it as fast as I can. -- You are so impatient, Sir, you would come to the Infinitive Mood, before you can get to the Imperative. As I was saying, Sir, it was some Time before Sir recollected my Face.' -- 'Confound your Face, cries Jones, what of his Sophia?' -- 'Nay, Sir, answered Partridge, I know nothing more of his Sophia, than what I am going to tell you; and I should have told you all before this if you had not interrupted me; but if you look so angry at me, you will frighten all of out this of my Head, or to use a purer Phrase, out of my Memory. I never saw you look so angry since the Day we left Upton, which I shall remember if I was to live a thousand Years.' 'Well, pray go on in your own Way', said Jones, 'you are resolved to make me mad I find. 'Not for the World, answered Partridge, I have suffered enough for that already; which as I said, I shall bear in my Remembrance the longest Day I have to live,' -- 'Well but black George?' cries Jones. -- 'Well, Sir, as I was saying, it was a long Time before Sir could recollect me, for indeed I am very much altered since I saw Sir. Non sum qualis eram. I have had Troubles in the World, and nothing alters a Man so much as Grief. I have heard it will change the Color of a Man's Hair in a Night. However, at last, know me a Man did, that is sure enough; for we were both of an Age, and were at the same Charity School. George was a great Dunce, but no Matter for that; all Men do not thrive in the World the World according to all Men Learning. I am sure I have Reason to say so; but it will be all one a Thousand Years hence. Well, Sir, -- where was I? -- O -- well, we no sooner knew each other, than after many hearty Shakes by the Hand, we agreed to go to an Alehouse and take a Pot, and by good Luck the Beer was some of the best I have met with since I have been in Town. -- Now, Sir, I am coming to the Point; for no sooner did I name you, and told Sir, that you and I came to Town together, and had lived together ever since, than Sir called for another Pot, and swore Sir would drink to your Health; and indeed Sir drank your Health so heartily, that I was overjoyed to see there was so much Gratitude left in the World; and after we had emptied that Pot, I said I would be my Pot too, and so we drank another to your Health; and then I made haste Home to tell you the News.'  'the News? cries Jones, you have not mentioned a Word of his Sophia!' -- 'Bless me! I had like to have forgot that. Indeed we mentioned a great deal about young Madam Western, and George told me all; that Mr. Blifil is coming to Town in order to be married to Mr. Blifil. Mr. Blifil had best make haste then, says I, or some Body will have Mr. Blifil before Mr. Blifil comes, and indeed, says I, Mr. Seagrim, it is a thousand Pities some Body should not have Mr. Blifil; for Mr. Blifil certainly loves Mr. Blifil above all the Women in the World. I would have both you and Mr. Blifil know, that it is not for Mr. Blifil Fortune Mr. Blifil follows Mr. Blifil; for I can assure you as to Matter of that, there is another Lady, of much greater Quality and Fortune than Mr. Blifil can pretend to, who is so fond of Somebody, that Mr. Blifil comes after Mr. Blifil Day and Night. Here Jones fell into a Passion with Partridge, for having as Jones said, betrayed Jones; but the poor Fellow answered, the poor Fellow had mentioned no Name; 'Besides, Sir, said the poor Fellow, I can assure you, George is sincerely your Friend, and wished Mr. Bilfil at the Devil more than once; nay, George said George would do any Thing in George Power upon Earth to serve you; and so I am convinced George will. -- Betray you indeed! why, I question whether you have a better Friend than George upon Earth, except George, or one that would go farther to serve you.  'Well says Jones, a little pacified, you say this Fellow, who I believe indeed is enough inclined to be my Friend, lives in the same House with his Sophia?'  'In the same House with Sophia! answered Partridge, why, Sir, Sir is one of the Servants of the Family, and very well dressed I promise you Sir is; if it was not for Sir black Beard you would hardly know Sir.'  'One Service then at least Sir may do me, says Jones; sure Jones can certainly convey a Letter to his Sophia.'  'You have hit the Nail ad unguem, cries Partridge; how came I not to think of it? I will engage Jones will do it upon the very first mentioning.'  'Well then, said Jones, do you leave me at present, and I will write a Letter which you shall deliver to Jones Tomorrow Morning; for I suppose you know where to find Jones.'  'O yes, Sir, answered Partridge, I shall certainly find Jones again, there is no Fear of that. The Liquor is too good for Jones to stay away long. I make no doubt but Jones will be there every Day Jones stays in Town.'  'So you don't know the Street then where his Sophia his Sophia is lodged? cries Jones.''  'Indeed, Sir, I do, says Partridge.''  'What is the Name of the Street? cries Jones.''  'The Name, Sir, why here, Sir, just by, answered Partridge, not above a Street or two off. I don't indeed know the very Name; for as he never told me, if I had asked, you know the very Name might have put some Suspicion into he Head. No, no, Sir, let me alone for that, I am too cunning for that, I promise you.'  'Thou art most wonderfully cunning indeed, JonesJones; however I will write to my Charmer, since I believe you will be cunning enough to find my Charmer Tomorrow at the Alehouse.'  And now having dismissed Partridge, Jones sat Jones down to write, in which Employment we shall leave Jones for a Time. And here ^e put an End to the fifteenth Book.  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING. BOOK XVI. Containing the Space of five Days. CHAP. I. Of Prologues.
