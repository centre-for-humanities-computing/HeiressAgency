never have heard them.' 'O my dear Friend,' crie^ Jones, 'I am so entangled with this Woman, that know not how to extricate myself.' 'In Love indeed? No, my Friend, but I am under Obliga+ tions to her, and very great ones. Since you know so much, I will be very explicit with you. It is owing perhaps solely to her, that I have not, before this, wanted a Bit of Bread. How can I possibly desert such a Woman? And yet I must desert her, or be guilty of the blackest Treachery to one, who deserves infinitely better of me than she can: A Woman, my Nightingale, for whom I have a Passion which few can have an Idea of. I am half distracted with doubts how to act.' 'And is this other, pray, an honorable Mistress?' cries Nightingale. 'Honourable?' answered Jones; 'No Breath ever yet durst sully her Reputation. The sweetest Air is not purer, the limpid Stream not clearer than her Honor. She is all over, both in Mind and Body, consummate Perfection. She is the most beautiful Creature in the Universe; and yet she is Mistress of such noble, elevated Qualities, that though she is never from my Thoughts, I scarce ever think of her Beauty, but when I see it.' 'And can you, my good Friend, cries Nightingale, 'with such an Engagement as this upon your Hands, hesitate a Moment about quitting such a -- ' 'Hold, said Jones, 'no more Abuse of her; I detest the Thoughts of Ingratitude.' 'Pooh! answered the other, 'you are not the first upon whom she has conferred Obligations of this Kind. She is remarkably liberal where she likes; though, let me tell you, her Favors are so prudently bestowed, that they should rather raise a Man's Vanity, than his Gratitude.' In short, Nightingale proceeded so far on this Head, and told his Friend so many Stories of the Lady, which he swore to the Truth of, that he entirely removed all Esteem for her from the Breast of Jones; and his Gratitude was lessened in Proportion. Indeed he began to look on all the Favors he had received, rather as Wages than Benefits, which not only depreciated her, but himself too in his own Conceit, and put him quite out of Humor with both. From this Disgust, his Mind, by a natural Transition, turned toward Sophia: Her Virtue, her Purity, her Love to him, her Sufferings on his Account, filled all his Thoughts, and made his Commerce with Lady Bellaston appear still more odious. The Result of all was, that though his turning himself out of her Service, in which Light he now saw his Affair with her, would be the Loss of his Bread, yet he determined to quit her; if he could but find a handsome Pretense; which having communicated to his Friend, Nightingale considered a little, and then said, 'I have it, my Boy; I have found out a sure Method: Propose Marriage to her, and I would venture Hanging upon the Success.' 'Marriage!' cries Jones. Ay, propose Marriage,' answered Nightingale, 'and she will declare off in a Moment. I knew a young Fellow whom she kept formerly, who made the Offer to her in earnest, and was presently turned off for his Pains.'  Jones declared he could not venture the Experiment. 'Perhaps,' said he, 'she may be less shocked at this Proposal from one Man than from another. And if she should take me at my Word, where am I then? Caught in my own Trap, and undone for ever.' 'No;' answered Nightingale, 'not if I can give you an Expedient, by which you may, at any Time, get out of the Trap.' -- 'What Expedient can that be?' replied Jones. 'This, answered Nightingale. 'The young Fellow I mentioned, who is one of the most intimate Acquaintances I have in the World, is so angry with her for some ill Offices she has since done him, that I am sure he would, without any Difficulty, give you a Sight of her Letters; upon which you may decently break with her, and declare off before the Knot is tied, if she should really be willing to tie it, which I am convinced she will not.'  After some Hesitation, Jones, upon the Strength of this Assurance, consented; but as he swore he wanted the Confidence to propose the Matter to her Face; he wrote the following Letter, which Nightingale dictated.  Madam, I am extremely concerned, that, by an unfortunate Engagement abroad, I should have missed receiving the Honor of your Ladyship's Commands the Moment they came; and the Delay which I must now suffer of vindicating myself to your Ladyship, greatly adds to this Misfortune. O Lady Bellaston, what a Terror have I been in for Fear your Reputation should be exposed by these perverse Accidents. There is one only Way to secure it. I need not name what that is. Only permit me to say, that as your Honor is as dear to me as my own, so my sole Ambition is to have the Glory of laying my Liberty at your Feet; and believe me when I assure you, I can never be made completely happy, without you generously bestow on me a legal Right of calling you mine for ever. I am,  Madam, With most profound Respect, Your Ladyship's most obliged, Obedient Humble Servant, Thomas Jones.   To this she presently returned the following Answer.  Sir, When I read over your serious Epistle, I could, from its Coldness and Formality, have sworn that you had already the legal Right you mention; nay, that we had, for many Years, composed that monstrous Animal a Husband and a Wife. Do you really then imagine me a Fool? Or do you fancy yourself capable of so entirely persuading me out of my Senses, that I should deliver my whole Fortune into your Power, in order to enable you to support your Pleasures at my Expense. Are these the Proofs of Love which I expected? Is this the Return for -- but I scorn to upbraid you, and am in great Admiration of your profound Respect.  P. S. I am prevented from revising: -- Perhaps I have said more than I meant, -- Come to me at Eight this Evening.   Jones, by the Advice of his Privy Council, replied:  Madam, It is impossible to express how much I am shocked at the Suspicion you entertain of me. Can Lady Bellaston have conferred Favors on a Man whom she could believe capable of so base a Design? Or can she treat the most solemn Tie of Love with Contempt? Can you imagine, Madam, that if the Violence of my Passion, in an unguarded Moment, overcame the Tenderness which I have for your Honor, I would think of indulging myself in the Continuance of an Intercourse, which could not possibly escape long the Notice of the World: and which, when discovered, must prove so fatal to your Reputation? If such be your Opinion of me, I must pray for a sudden Opportunity of returning those pecuniary Obligations, which I have been so unfortunate to receive at your Hands; and for those of a more tender Kind, I shall ever remain, etc. And so concluded in the very Words with which he had concluded the former Letter.   The Lady answered as follows.  I see you are a Villain; and I despise you from my Soul. If you come here, I shall not be at Home.   Though Jones was well satisfied with his Deliverance from a Thraldom which those who have ever experienced it will, I apprehend, allow to be none of the lightest, he was not, however, perfectly easy in his Mind. There was in this Scheme, too much of Fallacy to satisfy one who utterly detested every Species of Falsehood or Dishonesty: Nor would he, indeed, have submitted to put it in Practice, had he not been involved in a distressful Situation, where he was obliged to be guilty of some Dishonor, either to the one Lady or the other; and surely the Reader will allow, that every good Principle, as well as Love, pleaded strongly in Favor of Sophia.  Nightingale, highly exulted in the Success of his Stratagem, upon which he received many Thanks, and much Applause from his Friend. He answered, 'Dear Tom, we have conferred very different Obligations on each other. To me you owe the regaining your Liberty; to you I owe the Loss of mine. But if you are as happy in the one Instance, as I am in the other, I promise you we are the two happiest Fellows in England.'  The two Gentlemen were now summoned down to Dinner, where Mrs. Miller, who performed herself the Office of Cook, had exerted her best Talents, to celebrate the Wedding of her Daughter. This joyful Circumstance, she ascribed principally to the friendly behavior of Jones, her whole Soul was fired with Gratitude toward him, and all her Looks, Words, and Actions were so busied in expressing it, that her Daughter, and even her new Son-in-Law, were very little the Objects of her Consideration.  Dinner was just ended when Mrs. Miller received a Letter, but as we had Letters enough in this Chapter, we shall communicate the Contents in our next.  CHAP. X. Consisting partly of Facts, and partly of Observations upon them. THE Letter then which arrived at the End of the preceding Chapter was from Mr. Allworthy, and the Purport of it was his Intention to come immediately to Town, with his Nephew Blifil, and a Desire to be accommodated with his usual Lodgings, which were the first Floor for himself, and the second for his Nephew.  The Cheerfulness which had before displayed itself in the Countenance of the poor Woman, was a little clouded on this Occasion. This News did indeed a good deal disconcert her. To requite so disinterested a Match with her Daughter, by presently turning her new Son-in-Law out of Doors, appeared to her very unjustifiable, on the one Hand; and on the other, she could scarce bear the Thoughts of making any Excuse to Mr. Allworthy, after all the Obligations received from him, for depriving him of Lodgings which were indeed strictly his Due: For that Gentleman, in conferring all his numberless Benefits on others, acted by a Rule diametrically opposite to what is practiced by most generous People. He contrived, on all Occasions, to hide his Beneficence not only from the World, but even from the Object of it. He constantly used the Words Lend and Pay, instead of Give; and by every other Method he could invent, always lessened the Favors he conferred with his Tongue, while he was heaping them with both his Hands. When he settled the Annuity of 50l. a Year, therefore, on Mrs. Miller, he told her, 'It was in Consideration of always having her First-Floor when he was in Town,' (which he scarce ever intended to be) 'but that she might let it at any other Time, for that he would always send her a Month's Warning.' He was now, however, hurried to Town so suddenly, that he had no Opportunity of giving such Notice; and this Hurry probably prevented him, when he wrote for his Lodgings, adding, if they were then empty: For he would most certainly have been well satisfied to have relinquished them on a less sufficient Excuse than what Mrs. Miller could now have made.  But there are a Sort of Persons, who, as Prior excellently well remarks, direct their Conduct by something  Beyond the fixed and settled Rules Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools: Beyond the Letter of the Law. To these it is so far from being sufficient that their Defense would acquit them at the Old-Bailey, that they are not even contented, though Conscience, the severest of all Judges, should discharge them. Nothing short of the Fair and Honorable will satisfy the Delicacy of their Minds; and if any of their Actions fall short of this Mark, they mope and pine, are as uneasy and restless as a Murderer, who is afraid of a Ghost, or of the Hangman.  Mrs. Miller was one of these. She could not conceal her Uneasiness at this Letter; with the Contents of which she had no sooner acquainted the Company, and given some Hints of her Distress, than Jones, her good Angel, presently relieved her Anxiety. 'As for myself, Madam,' said he, 'my Lodging is at your Service at a Moment's Warning; and Mr. Nightingale, I am sure, as he cannot yet prepare a House fit to receive his Lady, will consent to return to his new Lodging, whither Mrs. Nightingale will certainly consent to go. With which Proposal both Husband and Wife instantly agreed.  The Reader will easily believe, that the Cheeks of Mrs. Miller began again to glow with additional Gratitude to Jones; but, perhaps, it may be more difficult to persuade him that Mr. Jones having, in his last Speech, called her Daughter Mrs. Nightingale, (it being the first Time that agreeable Sound had ever reached her Ears) gave the fond Mother more Satisfaction, and warmed her Heart more toward Jones, than his having dissipated her present Anxiety.  The next Day was then appointed for the Removal of the new-married Couple, and of Mr. Jones, who was likewise to be provided for in the same House with his Friend. And now the Serenity of the Company was again restored, and they past the Day in the utmost Cheerfulness, all except Jones, who, though he outwardly accompanied the rest in their Mirth, felt many a bitter Pang on the Account of his Sophia; which were not a little heightened by the News of Mr. Blifil's coming to Town, (for he clearly saw the Intention of his Journey:) And what greatly aggravated his Concern was, that Mrs. Honor, who had promised to enquire after Sophia, and to make her Report to him early the next Evening, had disappointed him.  In the Situation that he and his Mistress were a^ this Time, there were scarce any Grounds for him to hope that he should hear any good News; yet he was as impatient to see Mrs. Honor, as if he had expected she would bring him a Letter with an Assignation in it from Sophia, and bore the Disappointment a^ ill. Whether this Impatience arose from that natural Weakness of the Human Mind, which makes it desirous to know the worst, and renders Uncertainty the most intolerable of Pains; or whether he still flattered himself with some secret Hopes, we will not determine. But that it might be the last, whoever ha^ loved cannot but know. For of all the Powers exercised by this Passion over our Minds, one of the mo^^ wonderful is that of supporting Hope in the midst o^ Despair. Difficulties, Improbabilities, nay Impossibilities are quite overlooked by it; so that to any Man extremely in Love, may be applied what Addison says of Caesar,  The Alps, and Pyrenaeans sink before him! Yet it is equally true, that the same Passion will sometimes make Mountans of Mole-hills, and produce Despair in the midst of Hope; but these cold Fits last not ^ong in good Constitutions. Which Temper Jones was ^ow in, we leave the Reader to guess, having no ex^act Information about it; but this is certain, that he had spent two Hours in Expectation, when being unable any longer to conceal his Uneasiness, he retired to his Room; where his Anxiety had almost made him frantic, when the following Letter was brought him from Mrs. Honor, with which we shall present the Reader verbatim and literatim.  SIR, I should sartenly haf kaled on you a cordin too mi Prommiss haddunt itt bin that hur Lashipp prevent me; for too be sur, Sir, you nose very well that evere Persun must luk furst at ome, and sarrenly such anuther offar mite not ave ever happened, so as I should ave bin justly to blam, had I not excepted of it when her Laship was so very kind as to offar to make me hur one Uman, without mi ever askin any such thing, to be sur she is won of thee best Ladis in thee Wurld, and Pepil who safe to thee Kontrari must be very wiket Pepil in their Hearts. To be sur if ever I ave sad any thing of that Kine it as bin thru Ignorens and I am hartili sorri for it. I nose your Onor to be a Genteelman of more Honor and Onesty, if I ever said any such thing to repete it to hurt a pore Servant that as alwais ad thee gratest Respect in thee World for ure Honor. To be sur won should keep wons Tung within one's Teeth, for no Boddi nose what may hapen; and to be sur if an i Boddi ad told me Yesterday, that I should haf bin in so good a Plase to Day, I should not haf believed it; for too be sur I never was a dremd of any such Thing, nor should I ever ha soft after any other Bodi's Plase; but as her Laship wass so kine of her one a cord too give it me without askin, to be sure Mrs. Etoff herself, nor no other Bodi, can blammee for exceptin such a Thing when it falls in mi Way. I beg ure Honor not to menshon any thing of what I haf sad, for I wish ure Honor all thee gudLuk in thee Wurld; and I don't cuestion butt thatt u will haf Madam Sofia in the End; butt ass to miself ure Honor nose I kant be of any farther Sarvis to u in that Matar, nou bein under thee Cumand off anuther Parson, and not my one Mistress. I beg ure Honor to say nothing of what past, and belive me to be,  Sir, Ure Onur's umble Sarvant To Cumand till Death, Honor Blackmore.   Various are the Conjectures which Jones entertained on this Step of Lady Bellaston; who in reality had little further Design than to secure within her own House the Repository of a Secret, which she chose should make no farther Progress than it had made already; but mostly she desired to keep it from the Ears of Sophia; for though that young Lady was almost the only one who would never have repeated it again, her Ladyship could not persuade herself of this; since as she now hated poor Sophia with most implacable Hatred, she conceived a reciprocal Hatred to herself to be lodged in the tender Breast of our Heroine, where no such Passion had ever yet found an Entrance.  While Jones was terrifying himself with the Apprehension of a thousand dreadful Machinations, and deep political Designs, which he imagined to be at the Bottom of the Promotion of Honor, Fortune, who hitherto seems to have been an utter Enemy to his Match with Sophia, tried a new Method to put a final End to it, by throwing a Temptation in his Way, which in his present desperate Situation it seemed unlikely he should be able to resist.  CHAP. XI. Containing curious, but not unprecedented Matter. THERE was a Lady, one Mrs. Hunt, who had often seen Jones at the House where he lodged, being intimately acquainted with the Women there, and indeed a very great Friend to Mrs. Miller. Her Age was about thirty, for she owned six and twenty; her Face and Person very good, only inclining a little too much to be fat. She had been married young by her Relations to an old Turkey Merchant, who having got a great Fortune, had left off Trade. With him she lived without Reproach, but not without Pain, in a State of great Self denial, for about twelve Years; and her Virtue was rewarded by his dying, and leaving her very rich. The first Year of her Widowhood was just at an End, and she had past it in a good deal of Retirement, seeing only a few particular Friends, and dividing her Time between her Devotions and Novels, of which she was always extremely fond. Very good Health, a very warm Constitution, and a great deal of Religion made it absolutely necessary for her to marry again; and she resolved to please herself in her second Husband, as she had done her Friends in the first. From her the following Billet was brought to Jones.  Sir, From the first Day I saw you I doubt my Eyes have told you too plainly, that you were not indifferent to me; but neither my Tongue nor my Hand should ever have avowed it, had not the Ladies of the Family where you are lodged given me such a Character of you, and told me such Proofs of your Virtue and Goodness, as convince me you are not only the most agreeable, but the most worthy of Men. I have also the Satisfaction to hear from them, that neither my Person, Understanding or Character are disagreeable to you. I have a Fortune sufficient to make us both happy, but which cannot make me so without you. In thus disposing of myself I know I shall incur the Censure of the World, but if I did not love you more than I fear the World I should not be worthy of you. One only Difficulty stops me: I am informed you are engaged in a Commerce of Gallantry with a Woman of Fashon. If you think it worth while to sacrifice that to the Passion of me, I am yours; if not forget my Weakness, and let this remain an eternal Secret between you and  Arabella Hunt.   At the reading of this Jones was put into a violent Flutter. His Fortune was then at a very low Ebb, the Source being stopped from which hitherto he had been supplied. Of all he had received from Lady Bellaston not above five Guineas remained, and that very Morning he had been dunned by a Tradesman for twice that Sum. His honorable Mistress was in the Hands of her Father, and he had scarce any Hopes ever to get her out of them again. To be subsisted at her Expense from that little Fortune she had independent of her Father, went much against the Delicacy both of his Pride and his Love. This Lady's Fortune would have been exceeding convenient to him and he could have no Objection to her in any Respect On the contrary, he liked her as well as he did any Woman except Sophia. But to abandon Sophia, and marry another, that was impossible; he could no^ think of it upon any Account. Yet why should h^ not, since it was plain she could not be his? Would it not be kinder to her, than to continue her longer engaged in a hopeless Passion for him? Ought he not to do so in Friendship to her? This Notion prevailed some Moments, and he had almost determined to be false to her from a high Point of Honor; but that Refinement was not able to stand very long against the voice of Nature, which cried in his Heart, that such Friendship was Treason to Love. At last he called for Pen, Ink and Paper, and writ as follows to Mrs. Hunt.  Madam, It would be but a poor Return to the Favor you have done me, to sacrifice any Gallantry to the Possession of you, and I would certainly do it, though I were not disengaged, as at present I am, from any Affair of that Kind. But I should not be the honest Man you think me, if I did not tell you, that my Affections are engaged to another, who is a Woman of Virtue, and one that I never can leave, though it is probable I shall never possess her. God forbid that in Return of your Kindness to me, I should do you such an Injury, as to give you my Hand, when I cannot give my Heart. No, I had much rather starve than be guilty of that. Even though my Mistress were married to another, I would not marry you unless my Heart had entirely effaced all Impressions of her. Be assured that your Secret was not more safe in your own Breast, than in that of,  Your most obliged, and 'Grateful Humble Servant, Tom Jones.   When our Hero had finished and sent this Letter, he went to his Scrutore, took out Miss Western's Muff, kissed it several Times, and then strutted some Turns about his Room with more Satisfaction of Mind than ever any Irishman felt in carrying off a Fortune of fifty Thousand Pounds.  CHAP. XII. A Discovery made by Partridge. WHILE Jones was exulting in the Consciousness of his Integrity, Partridge came capering into the Room, as was his Custom when he brought, or fancied he brought, any good Tidings. He had been dispatched that Morning, by his Master, with Orders to endeavor, by the Servants of Lady Bellaston, or by any other Means, to discover whither Sophia had been conveyed; and he now returned, and with a joyful Countenance told our Hero, that he had found the lost Bird. 'I have seen, Sir, says he, black George, the Game-keeper, who is one of the Servants whom the Squire has brought with him to Town. I knew him presently, though I have not seen him these several Years; but you know, Sir, he is a very remarkable Man, or to use a purer Phrase, he has a most remarkable Beard, the largest and blackest I ever saw. It was some Time however before black George could recollect me.' -- 'Well, but what is your good News? cries Jones, what do you know of my Sophia?' -- 'You shall know presently, Sir, answered Partridge, I am coming to it as fast as I can. -- You are so impatient, Sir, you would come to the Infinitive Mood, before you can get to the Imperative. As I was saying, Sir, it was some Time before he recollected my Face.' -- 'Confound your Face, cries Jones, what of my Sophia?' -- 'Nay, Sir, answered Partridge, I know nothing more of Madam Sophia, than what I am going to tell you; and I should have told you all before this if you had not interrupted me; but if you look so angry at me, you will frighten all of out it of my Head, or to use a purer Phrase, out of my Memory. I never saw you look so angry since the Day we left Upton, which I shall remember if I was to live a thousand Years.' 'Well, pray go on in your own Way', said Jones, 'you are resolved to make me mad I find. 'Not for the World, answered Partridge, I have suffered enough for that already; which as I said, I shall bear in my Remembrance the longest Day I have to live,' -- 'Well but black George?' cries Jones. -- 'Well, Sir, as I was saying, it was a long Time before he could recollect me, for indeed I am very much altered since I saw him. Non sum qualis eram. I have had Troubles in the World, and nothing alters a Man so much as Grief. I have heard it will change the Color of a Man's Hair in a Night. However, at last, know me he did, that is sure enough; for we were both of an Age, and were at the same Charity School. George was a great Dunce, but no Matter for that; all Men do not thrive in the World according to their Learning. I am sure I have Reason to say so; but it will be all one a Thousand Years hence. Well, Sir, -- where was I? -- O -- well, we no sooner knew each other, than after many hearty Shakes by the Hand, we agreed to go to an Alehouse and take a Pot, and by good Luck the Beer was some of the best I have met with since I have been in Town. -- Now, Sir, I am coming to the Point; for no sooner did I name you, and told him, that you and I came to Town together, and had lived together ever since, than he called for another Pot, and swore he would drink to your Health; and indeed he drank your Health so heartily, that I was overjoyed to see there was so much Gratitude left in the World; and after we had emptied that Pot, I said I would be my Pot too, and so we drank another to your Health; and then I made haste Home to tell you the News.'  'What News? cries Jones, you have not mentioned a Word of my Sophia!' -- 'Bless me! I had like to have forgot that. Indeed we mentioned a great deal about young Madam Western, and George told me all; that Mr. Blifil is coming to Town in order to be married to her. He had best make haste then, says I, or some Body will have her before he comes, and indeed, says I, Mr. Seagrim, it is a thousand Pities some Body should not have her; for he certainly loves her above all the Women in the World. I would have both you and she know, that it is not for her Fortune he follows her; for I can assure you as to Matter of that, there is another Lady, of much greater Quality and Fortune than she can pretend to, who is so fond of Somebody, that she comes after him Day and Night. Here Jones fell into a Passion with Partridge, for having as he said, betrayed him; but the poor Fellow answered, he had mentioned no Name; 'Besides, Sir, said he, I can assure you, George is sincerely your Friend, and wished Mr. Bilfil at the Devil more than once; nay, he said he would do any Thing in his Power upon Earth to serve you; and so I am convinced he will. -- Betray you indeed! why, I question whether you have a better Friend than George upon Earth, except myself, or one that would go farther to serve you.  'Well says Jones, a little pacified, you say this Fellow, who I believe indeed is enough inclined to be my Friend, lives in the same House with Sophia?'  'In the same House! answered Partridge, why, Sir, he is one of the Servants of the Family, and very well dressed I promise you he is; if it was not for his black Beard you would hardly know him.'  'One Service then at least he may do me, says Jones; sure he can certainly convey a Letter to my Sophia.'  'You have hit the Nail ad unguem, cries Partridge; how came I not to think of it? I will engage he will do it upon the very first mentioning.'  'Well then, said Jones, do you leave me at present, and I will write a Letter which you shall deliver to him Tomorrow Morning; for I suppose you know where to find him.'  'O yes, Sir, answered Partridge, I shall certainly find him again, there is no Fear of that. The Liquor is too good for him to stay away long. I make no doubt but he will be there every Day he stays in Town.'  'So you don't know the Street then where my Sophia is lodged? cries Jones.''  'Indeed, Sir, I do, says Partridge.''  'What is the Name of the Street? cries Jones.''  'The Name, Sir, why here, Sir, just by, answered Partridge, not above a Street or two off. I don't indeed know the very Name; for as he never told me, if I had asked, you know it might have put some Suspicion into his Head. No, no, Sir, let me alone for that, I am too cunning for that, I promise you.'  'Thou art most wonderfully cunning indeed, replied Jones; however I will write to my Charmer, since I believe you will be cunning enough to find him Tomorrow at the Alehouse.'  And now having dismissed the sagacious Partridge, Mr. Jones sat himself down to write, in which Employment we shall leave him for a Time. And here ^e put an End to the fifteenth Book.
