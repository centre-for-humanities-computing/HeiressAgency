rather stay here and starve with you and my Papa, than go to it. -- Pardon me, Gentlemen, I cannot help it, (saus she, wiping her Eyes) such Sensibility and Affection in a Child -- And yet, perhaps, he is least the Object of Pity, for a Day or two will, most probably, place him beyond the Reach of all human Evils. The Father is indeed most worthy of Compassion. Poor Man, his Countenance is the very Picture of Horror, and he looks rather like one dead than alive. Oh Heavens! what a Scene did I behold at my first coming into the Room! The good Creature was lying behind the Bolster, supporting at once both his Child and his Wife. He had nothing on but a thin Waistcoat, for his Coat was spread over the Bed, to supply the Want of Blankets -- When he rose up, at my Entrance, I scarce knew him. As comely a Man, Mr. Jones, within this Fortnight, as you ever beheld; Mr. Nightingle had seen him. His Eyes sunk, his Face pale, with a long Beard. His Body shivering with Cold, and worn with Hunger too; for my Cousin says, she can hardly prevail upon him to eat. -- He told me himself in a Whisper -- he told me -- I cannot repeat it -- he said he could not bear to eat the Bread his Children wanted. And yet, can you believe it, Gentlemen? In all this Misery, his Wife has as good a Cawdle as if she lay in, in the midst of the greatest Affluence; I tasted it, and I scarce ever tasted better -- The Means of procuring her this,' he said, he believed was sent him by an Angel from Heaven; I know not what he meant, for I had not Spirits enough to ask a single Question.'  'This was a Love-Match, as they call it on both Sides; that is, a Match between two Beggars. I must indeed say I never saw a fonder Couple; but what is their Fondness good for, but to torment each other? Indeed Mamma, cries Nancy, I have always looked on my Cousin Anderson (for that was her Name) as one of the happiest of Women.' I am sure' says Mrs. Miller, 'the Case at present is much otherwise; for any one might have discerned that the tender Consideration of each other's Sufferings, makes the most intolerable Part of their Calamity, both to the Husband and the Wife. Compared to which, Hunger and Cold, as they affect their own Persons only, are scarce Evils. Nay, the very Children, the youngest, which is not two Years old, excepted, feel in the same Manner; for they are a most loving Family; and if they had but a bare Competency, would be the happiest People in the World. I never saw the least Sign of Misery at her House, replied Nancy; I am sure my Heart bleeds for what you now tell me. -- O Child,' answered the Mother, 'she has always endeavored to make the best of every Thing. They have always been in great Distress; but, indeed, this absolute Ruin has been brought upon them by others. The poor Man was Bail for the Villain his Brother; and about a Week ago, the very Day before her Lyingin, their Goods were all carried away, and sold by an Execution. He sent a Letter to me of it by one of the Bailiffs, which the Villain never delivered. -- What must he think of my suffering a Week to pass before he heard of me?'  It was not with dry Eyes that Jones heard this Narrative; when it was ended, he took Mrs. Miller apart with him into another Room, and delivering her his Purse, in which was the Sum of 50 l. desired her to send as much of it as she thought proper to these poor People. The Look which Mrs. Miller gave Jones, on this Occasion, is not easy to be described. She burst into a Kind of Agony of Transport, and cried out -- 'Good Heavens! Is there such a Man in the World?' -- But recollecting herself, she said, 'Indeed I know one such; but can there be another? I hope, Madam, cries Jones, there are many who have common Humanity: For to relieve such Distresses in our Fellow Creatures, can hardly be called more.' Mrs. Miller then took ten Guineas, which were the utmost he could prevail with her to accept, and said, 'she would find some Means of conveying them the next Morning;' adding, 'that she had herself done some little Matter for the poor People, and had not left them in quite so much Misery as she found them.'  They then returned to the Parlour, where Nightingale expressed much Concern at the dreadful Situation of these Wretches, whom, indeed, he knew^ for he had seen them more than once at Mrs. Miller's. He inveighed against the Folly of making one's self liable for the Debts of others; vented many bitter Execrations against the Brother; and concluded with wishing something could be done for the unfortunate Family. 'Suppose, Madam, said he, you should recommend them to Mr. Allworthy? Or what think you of a Collection? I will give them a Guinea with all my Heart.'  Mrs. Miller made no Answer; and Nancy, to whom her Mother had whispered the Generosity of Jones, turned pale upon the Occasion; though if either of them was angry with Nightingale, it was surely without Reason. For the Liberality of Jones, ^ he had known it, was not an Example which he had any Obligation to follow; and there are Thousands who would not have contributed a single Halfpenny, as indeed he did not in Effect, for he made no Tender of any Thing; and therefore as the others thought proper to make no Demand, he kept his Money in his Pocket.  I have in Truth observed, and shall never have a better Opportunity than at present to communicate my Observation, that the World are in general divided into two Opinions concerning Charity, which are he very reverse of each other. One Party seems to ^old, that all Acts of this Kind are to be esteemed as ^oluntary Gifts, and however little you give (if in^eed no more than your good Wishes) you acquire a ^reat Degree of Merit in so doing. -- Others on the ^ontrary, appear to be as firmly persuaded, that Be^eficence is a positive Duty, and that whenever the ^ich fall greatly short of their Ability in relieving the Distresses of the Poor, their pitiful Largesses are so ^r from being meritorious, that they have only per^ormed their Duty by Halves, and are in some Sense more contemptible than those who have entirely ne^lected it.  To reconcile these different Opinions is not in my Power. I shall only add, that the Givers are generally of the former Sentiment, and the Receivers are almost universally inclined to the latter.  CHAP. IX. Which treats of Matters of a very different Kind from those in the preceding Chapter. IN the Evening Jones met his Lady again, and a long Conversation again ensued between them; but as it consisted only of the same ordinary Occurrences as before, we shall avoid mentioning Particulars, which we despair of rendering agreeable to the Reader; unless he is one whose Devotion to the Fair Sex, like that of the Papists to their Saints, wants to be raised by the Help of Pictures. But I am so far from desiring to exhibit such Pictures to the Public, that I would wish to draw a Curtain over those that have been lately set forth in certain French Novels; very bungling Copies of which have been presented us here, under the Name of Translations.  Jones grew still more and more impatient to see Sophia; and finding, after repeated Interviews with Lady Bellaston, no Likelihood of obtaining this by her Means; for, on the contrary, the Lady began to treat even the Mention of the Name of Sophia with Resentment; he resolved to try some other Method. He made no Doubt but that Lady Bellaston knew where his Angel was, so he thought it most likely, that some of her Servants should be acquainted with the same Secret. Partridge therefore was employed to get acquainted with those Servants, in order to fish this Secret out of them.  Few Situations can be imagined more uneasy than that to which his poor Master was at present reduced; for besides the Difficulties he met with in discovering Sophia, besides the Fears he had of having disobliged ^er, and the Assurances he had received from the Lady Bellaston of the Resolution which Sophia had taken against him, and of her having purposely concealed herself from him, which he had sufficient Reason to believe might be true; he had still a Difficulty to combat, which it was not in the Power of his Mistress to remove, however kind her Inclination might have been. This was the exposing of her to be disinherited of all her Father's Estate, the almost inevitable Consequence of their coming together without a Consent, which he had no Hopes of ever obtaining.  Add to all these the many Obligations which Lady Bellaston, whose violent Fondness we can no longer conceal, had heaped upon him; so that by her Means he was now become one of the best dressed Men about Town; and was not only relieved from those ridiculous Distresses we have before mentioned, but was actually raised to a State of Affluence, beyond what he had ever known.  Now though there are many Gentlemen who very well reconcile it to their Consciences to possess themselves of the whole Fortune of a Woman, without making her any Kind of Return; yet to a Mind the ^roprietor of which does not deserve to be hanged, nothing is, I believe, more irksome than to support Love with Gratitude only; especially where Inclina^ion pulls the Heart a contrary Way. Such was the unhappy Case of Jones; for though the virtuous Love which he bore to Sophia, and which left very little Affection for any other Woman, had been entirely out of the Question, he could never have been able to ^ave made an adequate Return to the generous Pas^ion of this Lady, who had indeed been once an Ob^ect of Desire; but was now entered at least into the Autumn of Life; though she wore all the Gayety of Youth both in her Dress and Manner; nay, she contrived still to maintain the Roses in her Cheeks; but these, like Flowers forced out of Season by Art, had none of that lively blooming Freshness with which Nature, at the proper Time, bedecks her own Productions. She had, besides, a certain Imperfection, which renders some Flowers, though very beautiful to the Eye, very improper to be placed in a Wilderness of Sweets, and what above all others is most disagreeable to the Breath of Love.  Though Jones saw all these Discouragements on the one Side, he felt his Obligations full as strongly on the other; nor did he less plainly discern the ardent Passion whence these Obligations proceeded, the extreme Violence of which if he failed to equal, he well knew the Lady would think him ungrateful; and, what is worse, he would have thought himself so. He knew the tacit Consideration upon which all her Favors were conferred; and as his Necessity obliged him to accept them, so his Honor, he concluded, forced him to pay the Price. This therefore he resolved to do, whatever Misery it cost him, and to devote himself to her, from that great Principle of Justice, by which the Laws of some Countries oblige a Debtor who is no otherwise capable of discharging his Debt to become the Slave of his Creditor.  While he was meditating on these Matters, he received the following Note from the Lady.  'A very foolish, but a very perverse Accident has happened since our last Meeting, which makes it improper I should see you any more at the usual Place. I will, if possible, contrive some other Place by Tomorrow. In the mean Time, Adieu.'  This Disappointment, perhaps, the Reader may conclude was not very great; but if it was, he was quickly relieved; for in less than an Hour afterward another Note was brought him from the same Hand, which contained as follows.  'I have altered my Mind since I wrote, a Change, which if you are no Stranger to the tenderest of all Passions, you will not wonder at. I am now resolved to see you this Evening, at my own House, whatever may be the Consequence. Come to me exactly at seven; I dine abroad, but will be at Home by that Time. A Day, I find, to those that sincerely love seems longer than I imagined.'  'If you should accidentally be a few Moments before me, bid them show you into the Drawing Room.'  To confess the Truth, Jones was less pleased with this last Epistle than he had been with the former, as he was prevented by it from complying with the earnest Entreaties of Mr. Nightingale, with whom he had now contracted much Intimacy and Friendship. These Entreaties were to go with that young Gentleman and his Company to a new Play, which was to be acted that Evening, and which a very large Party had agreed to damn, from some Dislike they had taken to the Author, who was a Friend to one of Mr. Nightingale's Acquaintance. And this Sort of Funn, our Hero, we are ashamed to confess, would willingly have preferred to the above kind Appointment; but his Honor got the better of his Inclination.  Before we attend him to this intended Interview with the Lady, we think proper to account for both the preceding Notes, as the Reader may possibly be not a little surprised at the Imprudence of Lady Bellaston in bringing her Lover to the very House where her Rival was lodged.  First then the Mistress of the House where these Lovers had hitherto met, and who had been for some Years a Pensioner to that Lady, was now become a Methodist, and had that very Morning waited upon her Ladyship, and after rebuking her severely for her past Life, had positively declared, that she would, on no Account, be instrumental in carrying on any of her Affairs for the future.  The Hurry of Spirits into which this Accident threw the Lady, made her despair of possibly finding any other Convenience to meet Jones that Evening; but as she began a little to recover from her Uneasiness at the Disappointment, she set her Thoughts to work, when luckily it came into her Head to propose to Sophia to go to the Play, which was immediately consented to, and a proper Lady provided for her Companion. Mrs. Honor was likewise dispatched with Mrs. Etoff on the same Errand of Pleasure; and thus her own House was left free for the safe Reception of Mr. Jones, with whom she promised herself two or three Hours of uninterrupted Conversation, after her Return from the Place where she dined, which was at a Friend's House in a pretty distant Part of the Town, near her old Place of Assignation, where she had engaged herself before she was well apprized of the Revolution that had happened in the Mind and Morals of her late Confidante.  CHAP. X. A Chapter which, though short, may draw Tears from some Eyes. MR. Jones was just dressed to wait on Lady Bellaston, when Mrs. Miller rapp'd at his Door; and being admitted, very earnestly desired his Company below Stairs to drink Tea in the Parlour.  Upon his Entrance into the Room, she presently introduced a Person to him, saying, 'This, Sir, is my Cousin, who has been so greatly beholden to your Goodness, for which he begs to return you his sincerest Thanks.'  The Man had scarce entered upon that Speech, which Mrs. Miller had so kindly prefaced, when both Jones and he looking steadfastly at each other, showed at once the utmost Tokens of Surprise. The Voice of the latter began instantly to faulter; and, instead of finishing his Speech, he sunk down into a Chair, crying, 'It is so, I am convinced it is so!'  'Bless me, what is the Meaning of this, cries Mrs. Miller, you are not ill, I hope, Cousin? Some Water, a Dram this Instant.'  'Be not frighted, Madam, cries Jones, I have almost as much Need of a Dram as your Cousin. We are equally surprised at this unexpected Meeting. Your Cousin is an Acquaintance of mine, Mrs. Miller.'  'An Acquaintance! cries the Man, -- Oh Heaven!'  'Ay, an Acquaintance, repeated Jones, and an honored Acquaintance too. When I do not love and honor the Man who dares venture every thing to preserve his Wife and Children from instant Destruction, may I have a Friend capable of disowning me in Adversity.'  'O you are an excellent young Man cries Mrs. Miller, -- yes, indeed, poor Creature! he has ventured every thing -- if he had not had one of the best of Constitutions it must have killed him.'  'Cousin, cries the Man, who had now pretty well recovered himself; this is the Angel from Heaven whom I meant. This is he to whom before I saw you, I owed the Preservation of my Peggy. He it was to whose Generosity every Comfort, every Support which I have procured for her was owing. He is indeed the worthiest, bravest, noblest of all human Beings. O, Cousin, I have Obligations to this Gentleman of such a Nature!'  'Mention nothing of Obligations, cries Jones eagerly, not a Word I insist upon it, not a Word.' (Meaning, I suppose, that he would not have him betray the Affair of the Robbery to any Person) -- 'If by the Trifle you have received from me, I have preserved a whole Family, sure Pleasure was never bought so cheap.'  'O, Sir, cries the Man, I wish you could this Instant see my House. If any Person had ever a Right to the Pleasure you mention, I am convinced it is yourself. My Cousin tells me, she acquainted you with the Distress in which she found us. That, Sir, is all greatly removed, and chiefly by your Goodness. -- My Children have now a Bed to lie on, -- and they have -- they have -- eternal Blessings reward you for it, -- they have Bread to eat. My little Boy is recovered; my Wife is out of Danger, and I am happy. All, all owing to you, Sir, and to my Cousin here, one of the best of Women. Indeed, Sir, I must see you at my House. -- Indeed my Wife must see you, and thank you. -- My Children too must express their Gratitude. -- Indeed, Sir, they are not without a Sense of their Obligation; but what is my Feeling when I reflect to whom I owe, that they are now capable of expressing their Gratitude. -- Oh, Sir! the little Hearts which you have warmed had now been cold as Ice without your Assistance. -- '  Here Jones attempted to prevent the poor Man from proceeding; but indeed the Overflowing of his own Heart would of itself have stopped his Words. And now Mrs. Miller likewise began to pour forth Thanksgivings, as well in her own Name, as in that of her Cousin, and concluded with saying, she doubted not but such Goodness would meet a glorious Reward.  Jones answered, 'He had been sufficiently rewarded already. Your Cousin's Account, Madam, said he, has given me a Sensation more pleasing than I have ever known. He must be a Wretch who is unmoved at hearing such a Story; how transporting then must be the Thought of having happily acted a Part in this Scene. If there are Men who cannot feel the Delight of giving Happiness to others, I sincerely pity them, as they are incapable of tasting what is in my Opinion, a greater Honor, a higher Interest, and a sweeter Pleasure, than the ambitious, the avaritious, or the voluptuous Man can ever obtain.'  The Hour of Appointment being now come, Jones was forced to take a hasty Leave, but not before he had heartily shaken his Friend by the Hand, and desired to see him again as soon as possible; promising, that he would himself take the first Opportunity of visiting him at his own House. He then stepped into his Chair, and proceeded to Lady Bellaston's, greatly exulting in the Happiness which he had procured to this poor Family; nor could he forbear reflecting without Horror on the dreadful Consequences which must have attended them, had he listened rather to the Voice of strict Justice, than to that of Mercy when he was attacked on the high Road.  Mrs. Miller sung forth the Praises of Jones during the whole Evening, in which Mr. Enderson, while he stayed, so passionately accompanied her, that he was often on the very Point of mentioning the Circumstances of the Robbery. However, he luckily recalled himself, and avoided an Indiscretion which would have been so much the greater, as he knew Mrs. Miller to be extremely strict and nice in her Principles. He was likewise well apprised of the Loquacity of this Lady; and yet such was his Gratitude, that it had almost got the better both of Discretion and Shame, and made him publish that which would have defamed his own Character, rather than omit any Circumstances which might do the fullest Honor to his Benefactor.  CHAP. XI. In which the Reader will be surprised. MR. Jones was rather earlier than the Time appointed, and earlier than the Lady, whose Arrival was hindered not only by the Distance of the Place where she dined, but by some other cross Accidents, very vexatious to one in her Situation of Mind. He was accordingly shown into the Drawing Room, where he had not been many Minutes before the Door opened, and in came -- no other than Sophia herself, who had left the Play before the End of the first Act; for this, as we have already said, being a new Play, at which two large Parties met, the one to damn, and the other to applaud, a violent Uproar, and an Engagement between the two Parties had so terrified our Heroine, that she was glad to put herself under the Protection of a young Gentleman, who safely conveyed her to her Chair.  As Lady Bellaston had acquainted her that she should not be at Home till late, Sophia expecting to find no one in the Room, came hastily in, and went directly to a Glass which almost fronted her, without once looking toward the upper End of the Room, where the Statue of Jones now stood motionless. -- In this Glass it was, after contemplating her own lovely Face, that she first discovered the said Statue; when instantly turning about, she perceived the Reality of the Vision: Upon which she gave a violent Scream, and scarce preserved herself from fainting, till Jones was able to move to her, and support her in his Arms.  To paint the Looks or Thoughts of either of these Lovers is beyond my Power. As their Sensations, from their mutual Silence, may be judged to have been too big for their Utterance, it cannot be supposed, that I should be able to express them: And the Misfortune is, that few of my Readers have been enough in Love, to feel by their own Hearts what past at this Time in theirs.  After a short Pause, Jones, with faultering Accents, said, -- 'I see, Madam, you are surprised.' -- 'Surprized! answered she; Oh Heavens! Indeed, I am surprised. I almost doubt whether you are the Person you seem.' 'Indeed, cries he, my Sophia, pardon me, Madam, for this once calling you so, I am that very wretched Jones, whom Fortune, after so many Disappointments, has, at last, kindly conducted to you. Oh! my Sophia, did you know the thousand Torments I have suffered in this long, fruitless Pursuit' -- 'Pursuit of whom?' said Sophia, a little recollecting herself, and assuming a reserved Air. -- 'Can you be so cruel to ask that Question?' cries Jones. 'Need I say of you? 'Of me?' answered Sophia: 'Hath Mr. Jones then any such important Business with me?' 'To some, Madam, cries Jones, 'this might seem an important Business, (giving her the Pocketbook).' I hope, Madam, you will find it of the same Value, as when it was lost.' Sophia took the Pocketbook, and was going to speak, when he interrupted her, thus; -- 'Let us not, I beseech you, lose one of these precious Moments which Fortune has so kindly sent us. -- O my Sophia, I have Business of a much superior Kind. -- Thus, on my Knees, let me ask your Pardon.' -- 'My Pardon?' cries she; -- 'Sure, Sir, after what is past you cannot expect, after what I have heard' -- 'I scarce know what I say, answered Jones. 'By Heavens! I scarce wish you should pardon me. O my Sophia, henceforth never cast away a Thought on such a Wretch as I am. If any Remembrance of me should ever intrude to give a Moment's Uneasiness to that tender Bosom, think of my Unworthiness; and let the Remembrance of what past at Upton blot me for ever from your Mind' --  Sophia stood trembling all this while. Her Face was whiter than Snow, and her Heart was throbbing through her Stays. But at the mention of Upton, a Blush arose in her Cheeks, and her Eyes, which before she had scarce lifted up, were turned upon Jones with a Glance of Disdain. He understood this silent Reproach, and replied to it thus: 'O my Sophia, my only Love, you cannot hate or despise me more for what happened there, than I do myself: But yet do me the Justice to think, that my Heart was never unfaithful to you. That had no Share in the Folly I was guilty of; it was even then unalterably yours. Though I despaired of possessing you, nay, almost of ever seeing you more, I doated still on your charming Idea, and could seriously love no other Woman. But if my Heart had not been engaged, she, into whose Company I accidentally fell at that cursed Place, was not an Object of serious Love. Believe me, my Angel, I never have seen her from that Day to this; and never intend, or desired to see her again.' Sophia, in her Heart, was very glad to hear this; but forcing into her Face an Air of more Coldness than she yet had assumed; Why, said she, Mr. Jones, do you take the 'Trouble to make a Defense, where you are not accused? If I thought it worth while to accuse you, I have a Charge of an unpardonable Nature indeed.' 'What is it, for Heaven's Sake?' answered Jones, trembling and pale, expecting to hear of his Amor with Lady Bellaston. 'Oh, said she, how is it possible! Can every Thing noble, and every Thing base, be lodged together in the same Bosom?' Lady Bellaston, and the ignominious Circumstance of having been kept, rose again in his Mind, and stopped his Mouth from any Reply. 'Could I have expected, proceeded Sophia, such Treatment from you? Nay, from any Gentleman, from any Man of Honor? To have my Name traduced in Public; in Inns, among the meanest Vulgar! To have any little Favors, that my unguarded Heart may have too lightly betrayed me to grant, boasted of there! Nay, even to hear that you had been forced to fly from my Love!' Nothing could equal Jones's Surprise at these Words of Sophia; but yet, not being guilty, he was much less embarrassed how to defend himself, than if she had touched that tender String, at which his Conscience had been alarmed. By some Examination he presently found, that her supposing him guilty of so shocking an Outrage against his Love, and her Reputation, was entirely owing to Partridge's Talk at the Inns, before Landlords and Servants; for Sophia confessed to him, it was from them that she received her Intelligence. He had no very great Difficulty to make her believe that he was entirely innocent of an Offense so foreign to his Character; but she had a great deal to hinder him from going instantly home, and putting Partridge to Death, which he more than once swore he would do. This Point being cleared up, they soon found themselves so well pleased with each other, that Jones quite forgot he had begun the Conversation with conjuring her to give up all Thoughts of him; and she was in a Temper to have given Ear to a Petition of a very different Nature: For before they were aware, they had both gone so far, that he let fall some Words that sounded like a Proposal of Marriage. To which she replied, 'That, did not her Duty to her Father forbid her to follow her own Inclinations, Ruin with him would be more welcome to her, than the most affluent Fortune with another Man.' At the mention of the Word Ruin he started, let drop her Hand, which he had held for some Time, and striking his Breast with his own, cried out, 'Oh, Sophia, can I then ruin thee? No; by Heavens, no! I never will act so base a Part. Dearest Sophia, whatever it costs me, I will renounce you; I will give you up: I will tear all such Hopes from my Heart, as are inconsistent with your real Good. My Love I will ever retain, but it shall be in Silence; it shall be at a Distance from you; it shall be in some foreign Land; from whence no Voice, no Sigh of my Despair, shall ever reach and disturb your Ears. And when I am dead' -- He would have gone on, but was stopped by a Flood of Tears which Sophia let fall in his Bosom, upon which she leaned, without being able to speak one Word. He kissed them off, which, for some Moments, she allowed him to do without any Resistance; but then recollecting herself, gently withdrew out of his Arms; and, to turn the Discourse from a Subject too tender, and which she found she could not support, bethought herself to ask him a Question she had never had Time to put to him before, 'How he came into that Room?' He begun to stammer, and would, in all Probability, have raised her Suspicions by the Answer he was going to give, when, at once, the Door opened, and in came Lady Bellaston.  Having advanced a few Steps, and seeing Jones and Sophia together, she suddenly stopped; when after a Pause of a few Moments, recollecting herself with admirable Presence of Mind, she said, -- though with sufficient Indications of Surprise both in Voice and Countenance -- 'I thought, Miss Western, you had been at the Play?'  Though Sophia had had no Opportunity of learning of Jones, by what Means he had discovered her, yet as she had not the least Suspicion of the real Truth, or that Jones and Lady Bellaston were acquainted; so she was very little confounded: And the less, as the Lady had, in all their Conversations on the Subject, entirely taken her Side against her Father. With very little Hesitation, therefore, she went through the whole Story of what had happened at the Playhouse, and the Cause of her hasty Return.  The Length of this Narrative gave Lady Bellaston an Opportunity of rallying her Spirits, and of considering in what Manner to act. And as the Behavior of Sophia gave her Hopes that Jones had not betrayed her, she put on an Air of Good Humor, and said, 'I should not have broke in so abruptly upon you, Miss Western, if I had known you had Company.'  Lady Bellaston fixed her Eyes on Sophia whilst she spoke these Words. To which that poor young Lady, having her Face overspread with Blushes and Confusion, answered, in a stammering Voice, 'I am sure, Madam, I shall always think the Honor of your Ladyship's Company. -- 'I hope, at least,' cries Lady Bellaston, 'I interrupt no Business.' -- 'No, Madam, answered Sophia, our Business was at an End. Your Ladyship may be pleased to remember, I have often mentioned the Loss of my Pocketbook, which this Gentleman having very luckily found, was so kind to return to me with the Bill in it.'  Jones, ever since the Arrival of Lady Bellaston, had been ready to sink with Fear. He sat kicking his Heels, playing with his Fingers, and looking more like a Fool, if it be possible, than a young boody Squire, when he is first introduced into a polite Assembly. He began, however, now to recover himself; and taking a Hint from the Behavior of Lady Bellaston, who, he saw, did not intend to claim any Acquaintance with him, he resolved as entirely to affect the Stranger on his Part. He said, 'Ever since he had had the Pocketbook in his Possession, he had used great Diligence in enquiring out the Lady whose Name was writ in it; but never till that Day could be so fortunate to discover her.'  Sophia had, indeed, mentioned the Loss of her Pocketbook to Lady Bellaston; but as Jones, for some Reason or other, had never once hinted to her that it was in his Possession, she believed not one Syllable of what Sophia now said, and wonderfully admired the extreme Quickness of the young Lady, in inventing such an Excuse. The Reason of Sophia's leaving the Playhouse met with no better Credit; and though she could not account for the Meeting between these two Lovers, she was firmly persuaded it was not accidental.  With an affected Smile, therefore, she said -- 'Indeed, Miss Western, you have had very good Luck in recovering your Money. Not only as it fell into the Hands of a Gentleman of Honor, but as he happened to discover to whom it belonged. I think you would not consent to have it advertised. -- It was great good Fortune, Sir, that you found out to whom the Note belonged.'  'O Madam, cries Jones, it was enclosed in a Pocketbook, in which the young Lady's Name was written.'  'That was very fortunate indeed, cries the Lady; -- And it was no less so, that you heard Miss Western was at my House; for she is very little known.'  Jones had at length perfectly recovered his Spirits; and as he conceived he had now an Opportunity of satisfying Sophia, as to the Question she had asked him just before Lady Bellaston came in, he proceeded thus: Why, Madam, answered he, 'it was by the luckiest Chance imaginable I made this Discovery. I was mentioning what I had found, and the Name of the Owner, the other Night, to a Lady at the Masquerade, who told me, she believed she knew where I might see Miss Western; and if I would come to her House the next Morning, she would inform me. I went according to her Appointment, but she was not at Home; nor could I ever meet with her till this Morning, when she directed me to your Ladyship's House. I came accordingly, and did myself the Honor to ask for your Ladyship; and upon my saying that I had very particular Business, a Servant showed me into this Room; where I had not been long before the young Lady returned from the Play.'  Upon his mentioning the Masquerade, he looked very slyly at Lady Bellaston, without any Fear of being remarked by Sophia; for she was visibly too much confounded to make any Observations. This Hint a little alarmed the Lady, and she was silent; when Jones, who saw the Agitations of Sophia's Mind, resolved to take the only Method of relieving her, which was by retiring: But before he did this, he said, 'I believe, Madam, it is customary to give some Reward on these Occasions; -- I must insist on a very high one for my Honesty; -- It is, Madam, no less than the Honor of being permitted to pay another Visit here.'  'Sir, replied the Lady, I make no Doubt that you are a Gentleman, and my Doors are never shut to People of Fashion.'  Jones then, after proper Ceremonials, departed, highly to his own Satisfaction, and no less to that of Sophia; who was terribly alarmed lest Lady Bellaston should discover what she knew already but too well.  Upon the Stairs Jones met his old Acquaintance Mrs. Honor, who, notwithstanding all she had said against him, was now so well-bred to behave with great Civility. This Meeting proved indeed a lucky Circumstance, as he communicated to her the House where he lodged, with which Sophia was unacquainted.  CHAP. XII. In which the Thirteenth Book is concluded. THE elegant Lord Shaftsbury somewhere objects to telling too much Truth: By which it may be fairly inferred, that, in some Cases, to lie, is not only excusable but commendable.  And surely there are no Persons who may so properly challenge a Right to this commendable Deviation from Truth, as young Women in the Affair of Love; for which they may plead Precept, Education, and above all, the Sanction, nay, I may say, the Necessity of Custom, by which they are restrained, not from submitting to the honest Impulses of Nature (for that would be a foolish Prohibition) but from owning them.  We are not, therefore, ashamed to say, that our Heroine now pursued the Dictates of the abovementioned Right Honorable Philosopher. As she was perfectly satisfied then, that Lady Bellaston was ignorant of the Person of Jones, so she determined to keep her in that Ignorance, though at the Expense of a little Fibbing.  Jones had not been long gone, before Lady Bellaston cried, 'Upon my Word, a good pretty young Fellow; I wonder who he is: For I don't remember ever to have seen his Face before.'  'Nor I neither, Madam, cries Sophia. I must say he behaved very handsomely in relation to my Note.'  'Yes; and he is a very handsome Fellow, said the Lady; don't you think so?'  I did not take much Notice of him, answered Sophia; 'but I thought he seemed rather awkward and ungenteel than otherwise.'  'You are extremely right, cries Lady Bellaston: You may see, by his Manner, that he has not kept good Company. Nay, notwithstanding his returning your Note, and refusing the Reward, I almost question whether he is a Gentleman. -- I have always observed there is a Something in Persons well-born, which others can never acquire. -- I think I will give Orders not to be at Home to him.'  'Nay sure, Madam, answered Sophia, one cannot suspect after what he has done: -- Besides, if your Ladyship observed him, there was an Elegance in his Discourse, a Delicacy, a Prettiness of Expression that, that -- '  'I confess, said Lady Bellaston, the Fellow has Words -- And indeed, Sophia, you must forgive me, indeed you must.'  'I forgive your Ladyship! said Sophia.'  'Yes indeed you must, answered she 'laughing; for I had a horrible Suspicion when I first came into the Room -- I vow you must forgive it; but I suspected it was Mr. Jones himself.'  'Did your Ladyship indeed? cries Sophia, blushing, and affecting a Laugh.'  'Yes, I vow I did, answered she, I cannot imagine what put it into my Head: For, give the Fellow his due, he was genteelly dressed; which, I think, dear Sophy, is not commonly the Case with your Friend.'  'This Raillery, cries Sophia, is a little cruel, Lady Bellaston, after my Promise to your Ladyship.'  'Not at all, Child,' said the Lady; -- It would have been cruel before; but after you have promised me never to marry without your Father's Consent, in which you know is implied your giving up Jones, sure you can bear a little Raillery on a Passion which was pardonable enough in a young Girl in the Country, and of which you tell me you have so entirely got the better. What must I think, my dear Sophy if you cannot bear a little Ridicule even on his Dress? I shall begin to fear you are very far gone indeed; and almost question whether you have dealt ingenuously with me.'  'Indeed, Madam, cries Sophia, your Ladyship mistakes me, if you imagine I had any Concern on his Account.'  'On his Account?' answered the Lady: 'You must have mistaken me; I went no farther than his Dress; -- for I would not injure your Taste by any other Comparison -- I don't imagine, my dear Sophy, if your Mr. Jones had been such a Fellow as this -- '  'I thought,' says Sophia, 'your Ladyship had allowed him to be handsome. -- '  'Whom, pray?' cried the Lady, hastily.  'Mr. Jones,' answered Sophia; -- and immediately recollecting herself, 'Mr. Jones! -- no, no; I ask your Pardon; -- I mean the Gentleman who was just now here.'  'O Sophy! Sophy!' cries the Lady; 'this Mr. Jones, I am afraid, still runs in your Head.'  'Then upon my Honor, Madam,' said Sophia, 'Mr. Jones is as entirely indifferent to me, as the Gentleman who just now left us.'  'Upon my Honor,' said Lady Bellaston, 'I believe it. Forgive me, therefore, a little innocent Raillery; but I promise you I will never mention his Name any more.'  And now the two Ladies separated, infinitely more to the Delight of Sophia, than of Lady Bellaston, who would willingly have tormented her Rival a little longer, had not Business of more Importance called her away. As for Sophia, her Mind was not perfectly easy under this first Practice of Deceit; upon which, when she retired to her Chamber, she reflected with the highest Uneasiness and conscious Shame. Nor could the peculiar Hardship of her Situation, and the Necessity of the Case, at all reconcile her Conduct to her Mind; the Frame of which was too delicate to bear the Thought of having been guilty of a Falsehood, however qualified by Circumstances. Nor did this Thought once suffer her to close her Eyes during the whole succeeding Night.  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING. BOOK XIV. Containing Two Days. CHAP. I. An Essay to prove that an Author will write the better, for having some Knowledge of the Subject on which he writes. AS several Gentlemen in these Times, by the wonderful Force of Genius only, without the least Assistance of Learning, perhaps, without being well able to read, have made a considerable Figure in the Republic of Letters; the modern Critics, I am told, have lately begun to assert, that all kind of Learning is entirely useless to a Writer; and, indeed, no other than a kind of Fetters on the natural Spriteliness and Activity on the Imaginations, which is thus weighed down, and prevented from soaring to those high Flights which otherwise it would be able to reach.  This Doctrine, I am afraid, is, at present, carried much too far: For why should Writing differ so much from all other Arts? The Nimbleness of a Dancing Master is not at all prejudiced by being taught to move; nor does any Mechanic, I believe, exercise his Tools the worse by knowing how to use them. For my own Part, I cannot conceive that Homer or Virgil would have writ with more Fire, if, instead of being Masters of all the Learning of their Times, they had really been as ignorant as most of the Authors of the present Age. Nor do I believe that all the Imagination, Fire, and Judgment of Pit could have produced those Orations that have made the Senate of England in these our Times a Rival in Eloquence to Greece and Rome, if he had not been so well read in the Writings of Demosthenes and Cicero, as to have transfused their whole Spirit into his Speeches, and with their Spirit, their Knowledge too.  I would not here be understood to insist on the same Fund of Learning in any of my Brethren, as Cicero persuades us is necessary to the Composition of an Orator. On the contrary, very little Reading is, I conceive, necessary to the Poet, less to the Critic, and the least of all to the Politician. For the first, perhaps, Bysse's Art of Poetry, and a few of our modern Poets, may suffice; for the second, a moderate Heap of Plays; and for the last, an indifferent Collection of political Journals.  To say the Truth, I require no more than that a Man should have some little Knowledge of the Subject on which he treats, according to the old Maxim of Law, Quam quisque norit artem in ea se exerceat. With this alone a Writer may sometimes do tolerably well; and indeed without this, all the other Learning in the World will stand him in little stead.  For Instance, let us suppose that Homer and Virgil, Aristotle and Cicero, Thucydides and Livy could have met all together, and have clubbed their several Talents to have composed a Treatise on the Art of Dancing; I believe it will be readily agreed they could not have equalled the excellent Treatise which Mr. Essex has given us on that Subject, entitled, The Rudiments of genteel Education. And, indeed, should the excellent Mr. Broughton be prevailed on to set Fist to Paper, and to complete the abovesaid Rudiments, by delivering down the true Principles of Athletics, I question whether the World will have any Cause to lament, that none of the great Writers, either ancient or modern, have ever treated about that noble and useful Art.  To avoid a Multiplicity of Examples in so plain a Case, and to come at once to my Point, I am apt to conceive, that one Reason why many English Writers have totally failed in describing the Manners of upper Life, may possibly be, that in Reality they know nothing of it.  This is a Knowledge unhappily not in the Power of many Authors to arrive at. Books will give us a very imperfect Idea of it; nor will the Stage a much better: The fine Gentleman formed upon reading the former will almost always turn out a Pedant, and he who forms himself upon the latter, a Coxcomb.  Nor are the Characters drawn from these Models better supported. Vanbrugh and Congreve copied Nature; but they who copy them draw as unlike the present Age, as Hogarth would do if he was to paint a Rout or a Drum in the Dresses of Titian and of Vandyke. In short, Imitation here will not do the Business. The Picture must be after Nature herself. A true Knowledge of the World is gained only by Conversation, and the Manners of every Rank must be seen in order to be known.  Now it happens that this higher Order of Mortals is not to be seen, like all the rest of the Human Species, for nothing, in the Streets, Shops, and Coffee-houses: Nor are they shown, like the upper Rank of Animals, for so much apiece. In short, this is a Sight to which no Persons are admitted, without one or other of these Qualifications, viz. either Birth or Fortune; or what is equivalent to both, the honorable Profession of a Gamester. And very unluckily for the World, Persons so qualified, very seldom care to take upon themselves the bad Trade of Writing; which is generally entered upon by the lower and poorer Sort, as it is a Trade which many think requires no Kind of Stock to set up with.  Hence those strange Monsters in Lace and Embroidery, in Silks and Brocades, with vast Wigs and Hoops; which, under the Name of Lords and Ladies, strut the Stage, to the great Delight of Attorneys and their Clerks in the Pit, and of Citizens and their Apprentices in the Galleries; and which are no more to be found in real Life, than the Centaur, the Chimera, or any other Creature of mere Fiction. But to let my Reader into a Secret, this Knowledge of upper Life, though very necessary for the preventing Mistakes, is no very great Resource to a Writer whose Province is Comedy, or that Kind of Novels, which like this I am writing, is of the comic Class.  What Mr. Pope says of Women is very applicable to most in this Station, who are indeed so entirely made up of Form and Affection, that they have no Character at all, at least, none which appears. I will venture to say the highest Life is much the dullest, and affords very little Humor or Entertainment. The various Callings in lower Spheres produce the great Variety of humorous Characters; whereas here, except among the few who are engaged in the Pursuit of Ambition, and the fewer still who have a Relish for Pleasure, all is Vanity and servile Imitation. Dressing and Cards, eating and drinking, bowing and curtesying, make up the Business of their Lives.  Some there are however of this Rank, upon whom Passion exercises its Tyranny, and hurries them far beyond the Bounds which Decorum prescribes; of these, the Ladies are as much distinguished by their noble Intrepidity, and a certain superior Contempt of Reputation, from the frail ones of meaner Degree, as a virtuous Woman of Quality is by the Elegance and Delicacy of her Sentiments from the honest Wife of a Yeoman or Shopkeeper. Lady Bellaston was of this intrepid Character; but let not my Country Readers conclude from her, that this is the general Conduct of Women of Fashion, or that we mean to represent them as such. They might as well suppose, that every Clergyman was represented by Thwackum, or every Soldier by Ensign Northerton.  There is not indeed a greater Error than that which universally prevails among the Vulgar, who borrowing their Opinion from some ignorant Satyrists, have affixed the Character of Lewdness to these Times. On the contrary, I am convinced there never was less of Love Intrigue carried on among Persons of Condition, than now. Our present Women have been taught by their Mothers to fix their Thoughts only on Ambition and Vanity, and to despise the Pleasures of Love as unworthy their Regard; and being afterward, by the Care of such Mothers, married without having Husbands, they seem pretty well confirmed in the Justness of those Sentiments; whence they content themselves for the dull Remainder of Life, with the Pursuit of more innocent, but I am afraid more childish Amusements, the bare Mention of which would ill suit with the Dignity of this History. In my humble Opinion, the true Characteristick of the present Beau Monde, is rather Folly than Vice, and the only Epithet which it deserves is that of Frivolous.  CHAP. II. Containing Letters and other Matters which attend Amors. JONES had not long been at Home, before he received the following Letter.  I was never more surprised than when I found you was gone. When you left the Room, I little imagined you intended to have left the House without seeing me again. Your Behavior is all of a Piece, and convinces me how much I ought to despise a Heart which can dote upon an Idiot; though I know not whether I should not admire her Cunning more than her Simplicity: Wonderful both! For though she understood not a Word of what passed between us, she yet had the Skill, the Assurance, the -- what shall I call it? to deny to my Face, that she knows you, or ever saw you before. -- Was this a Scheme laid between you, and have you been base enough to betray me? -- O how I despise her, you, and all the World, but chiefly myself, for -- I dare not write what I should afterward run mad to read; but remember, I can detest as violently as I have loved.   Jones had but little Time given him to reflect on his Letter, before a second was brought him from ^e same Hand; and this likewise, we shall set down ^n the precise Words.  When you consider the Hurry of Spirits in which I must have writ, you cannot be surprised at any Expressions in my former Note. -- Yet, perhaps, on Reflection, they were rather too warm. At least I would if possible, think all owing to the odious Playhouse, and to the Impertinence of Fool, which detained me beyond my Appointmen^ -- How easy is it to think well of those w^ love? -- Perhaps you desire I should think so I have resolved to see you to Night, so come to m^ immediately.  P. S. I have ordered to be at Home to none b^ 'yourself.  P. S. Mr. Jones will imagine I shall assist hi^ in his Defense; for I believe he cannot desir^ to impose on me more than I desire to impo^^ on myself.  P. S. Come immediately.     To the Men of Intrigue I refer the Determination whether the angry or the tender Letter gave the greatest Uneasiness to Jones. Certain it is, he ha^ no violent Inclination to pay more Visits that Evening, unless to one single Person. However he though^ his Honor engaged, and had not this been Moti^^ sufficient, he would not have ventured to blow the Temper of Lady Bellaston into that Flame of which he had Reason to think it susceptible, and of which he feared the Consequence might be a Discovery ^^ Sophia, which he dreaded. After some disconten^ Walks therefore about the Room, he was prepari^^ to depart, when the Lady kindly prevented him, n^ by another Letter, but by her own Presence. S^^ entered the Room very disordered in her Dress, a^ very discomposed in her Looks, and threw herself i^ to a Chair, where having recovered her Breath, s^^ said, -- 'You see, Sir, when Women have go^ one Length too far, they will stop at none. If a^ Person would have sworn this to me a Week ag^ I would not have believed it of myself.' 'I hop^ Madam, said Jones, my charming Lady Bellaston will be as difficult to believe any thing against o^ who is so sensible of the many Obligations she ha^ conferred upon him.' -- 'Indeed! says she, sensible of Obligations! Did I expect to hear such cold Language from Mr. Jones?' 'Pardon me, my dear Angel, said he, if after the Letters I have received, the Terrors of your Anger, though I know not how I have deserved it' -- 'And have I then, says she with a Smile, so angry a Countenance? -- Have I really brought a chiding Face with me?' -- 'If there be Honor in Man, said he, I have done nothing to merit your Anger.' -- You remember the Appointment you sent me -- I went in Pursuance' -- 'I beseech you, cried she, do not run through the odious Recital -- Answer me but one Question, and I shall be easy -- Have you not betrayed my Honor to her?' -- Jones fell upon his Knees, and began to utter the most violent Protestations, when Partridge came dancing and capering into the Room, like one drunk with Joy, crying out, 'she's found! she is found! -- Here, Sir, here, she is here, -- Mrs. Honor is upon the Stairs.' 'Stop her a Moment, cries Jones, -- Here, Madam, step behind the Bed, I have no other Room nor Closet, nor Place on Earth to hide you in; sure never was so damned an Accident.' -- 'D -- n'd indeed!' said the Lady as she went to her Place of Concealment; and presently afterward in came Mrs. Honor. 'Hey day! says she, Mr. Jones, what is the Matter? -- That impudent Rascal, your Servant, would scarce let me come up Stairs. I hope he has not the same Reason now to keep me from you as he had at Upton. -- I suppose you hardly expected to see me: but you have certainly bewitched my Lady. Poor dear young Lady! To be sure, I loves her as tenderly as if she was my own Sister. Lord have Mercy upon you, if you don't make her a good Husband; and to be sure, if you do not, nothing can be bad enough for you.' Jones 'begged her only to whisper, for that there was a Lady dying in the next Room.' 'A Lady! cries she; ay, I suppose one of your Ladies. -- O Mr. Jones, there are too many of them in the World; I believe we are got into the House of one, for my Lady Bellaston I dare to say is no better than she should be.' -- 'Hush! hush! cries Jones, every Word is overheard in the next Room.' 'I don't care a Farthing, cries Honor, I speaks no Scandal of any one; but to be sure the Servants makes no Scruple of saying as how her Ladyship meets Men at another Place -- where the House goes under the Name of a poor Gentlewoman, but her Ladyship pays the Rent, and many's the good Thing besides, they say, she has of her.' -- Here Jones, after expressing the utmost Uneasiness, offered to stop her Mouth, -- 'Hey day! why sure Mr. Jones you will let me speak, I speaks no Scandal, for I only says what I heard from others, -- and thinks I to myself much good may it do the Gentlewoman with her Riches, if she comes by it in such a wicked Manner. To be sure it is better to be poor and honest.' 'The Servants are Villains, cries Jones, and abuse their Lady unjustly' -- 'Ay to be sure Servants are always Villains, and so my Lady says, and will not hear a Word of it.' -- 'No, I am convinced, says Jones, my Sophia is above listening to such base Scandal.' 'Nay, I believe it is no Scandal neither, cries Honor, for why should she meet Men at another House? -- It can never be for any Good: for if she had a lawful Design of being courted, as to be sure any Lady may lawfully give her Company to Men upon that Account; why where can be the Sense' -- 'I protest, cries Jones, I cannot hear all 'this of a Lady of such Honor, and a Relation of Sophia; besides you will distract the poor Lady in the next Room. -- Let me entreat you to walk with me down Stairs. -- Nay, Sir, you will not let me speak, I have done -- Here, Sir, is a Letter from my young Lady, -- what would some Men give to have this? But, Mr. Jones, I think you are not over and above generous, and yet I have heard some Servants say; but I am sure you will do me the Justice to own I never saw the Color of your Money.' Here Jones hastily took the Letter, and presently after slipped five Pieces into her Hand. He then returned a thousand Thanks to his dear Sophia in a Whisper, and begged her to leave him to read her Letter; she presently departed, not without expressing much grateful Sense of his Generosity.  Lady Bellaston now came from behind the Curtain. How shall I describe her Rage? Her Tongue was at first incapable of Utterance; but streams of Fire darted from her Eyes, and well indeed they might, for her Heart was all in a Flame. And now as soon as her Voice found Way, instead of expressing any Indignation against Honor, or her own Servants, she began to attack poor Jones. 'You see, said she, what I have sacrificed to you, my Reputation, my Honor, -- gone for ever! And what Return have I found? Neglected, slighted for a Country Girl, for an Idiot.' -- 'What Neglect, Madam, or what Slight, cries Jones, have I been guilty of? -- Mr. Jones, said she, it is in vain to dissemble, if you will make me easy, you must entirely give her up; and as a Proof of your Intention, show me the Letter.' -- 'What Letter, Madam? said Jones. Nay, surely, said she, you cannot have the Confidence to deny your having received a Letter by the Hands of that Trollop'. And can your Ladyship, cries he, ask of me what I must part with my Honor before I grant? Have I acted in such a Manner by your Ladyship? Could I be guilty of betraying this poor innocent Girl to you, what Security could you have, that I should not act the same Part by yourself? A Moment's Reflection will, I am sure, convince you, that a Man with whom the Secrets of a Lady are not safe, must be the most contemptible of Wretches. Very well, said she -- I need not insist on your becoming this contemptible Wretch in your own Opinion; for the Inside of the Letter could inform me of nothing more than I know already. I see the Footing you are upon.' -- Here ensued a long Conversation, which the Reader, who is not too curious, will thank me for not inserting at length. It shall suffice therefore to inform him, that Lady Bellaston grew more and more pacified, and at length believed, or affected to believe, his Protestations, that his meeting with Sophia that Evening was merely accidental, and every other Matter which the Reader already knows, and which as Jones set before her in the strongest Light, it is plain that she had in Reality no Reason to be angry with him.  She was not however in her Heart perfectly satisfied with his Refusal to show her the Letter, so dea^ are we to the clearest Reason, when it argues against our prevailing Passions. She was indeed well convinced that Sophia possessed the first Place in Jones^ Affections; and yet, haughty and amorous as this Lady was, she submitted at last to bear the second Place or to express it more properly in a legal Phrase; wa^ contented with the Possession of that of which another Woman had the Reversion.  It was at length agreed, that Jones should for the future visit at the House: for that Sophia, her Mai^ and all the Servants would place these Visits to the Account of Sophia; and that she herself would ^^ considered as the Person imposed upon.  This Scheme was contrived by the Lady, and highly relished by Jones, who was indeed glad to have Prospect of seeing his Sophia at any Rate; and the Lady herself was not a little pleased with the Imposition on Sophia, which Jones, she thought, could not possibly discover to her for his own Sake.  The next Day was appointed for the first Visit, and then, after proper Ceremonials, the Lady Bellaston returned Home.  CHAP. III. Containing various Matters. JONES was no sooner alone, than he eagerly broke open his Letter, and read as follows,  Sir, it is impossible to express what I have suffered since you left this House; and as I have Reason to think you intend coming here again, I have sent Honor, though so late at Night, as she tells me she knows your Lodgings, to prevent you. I charge you, by all the Regard you have for me, not to think of visiting here; for it will certainly be discovered; nay, I almost doubt from some Things which have dropped from her Ladyship, that she is not already without some Suspicion. Something favorable perhaps may happen; we must wait with Patience; but I once more entreat you, if you have any Concern for my Ease, do not think of returning hither.   This Letter administered the same Kind of Consolation to poor Jones, which Job formerly received from his Friends. Besides disappointing all the Hopes which he promised to himself from seeing Sophia, he was reduced to an unhappy Dilemma, with Regard to Lady Bellaston; for there are some certain Engagements, which, as he well knew, do very difficultly admit of any Excuse for the Failure; and to go, after the strict Prohibition from Sophia, he was not to be forced by any human Power. At length, after much Deliberation, which during that Night supplied the Place of Sleep, he determined to feign himself sick: For this suggested itself as the only means of failing the appointed Visit, without incensing Lady Bellaston, which he had more than one Reason of desiring to avoid.  The first Thing however which he did in the Morning was to write an Answer to Sophia, which he enclosed in one to Honor. He then dispatched another to Lady Bellaston, containing the abovementioned Excuse; and to this he soon received the following Answer.  I am vexed that I cannot see you here this Afternoon, but more concerned for the Occasion; take great Care of yourself, and have the best Advice, and I hope there will be no Danger. -- I am so tormented all this Morning with Fools, that I have scace a Moment's Time to write to you. Adieu.  P. S. I will endeavor to call on you this Evening at nine. -- Be sure to be alone.     Mr. Jones now received a Visit from Mrs. Miller, who, after some formal Introduction, began the following Speech. 'I am very sorry, Sir, to wait upon you on such an Occasion; but I hope you will consider the ill Consequence which it must be to the Reputations of my poor Girls, if my House should once be talked of as a House of ill Fame. I hope you will not think me therefore guilty of Impertinence if I beg you not to bring any more Ladies in at th^^ Time of Night. The Clock had struck two before one of them went away.' 'I do assure you, Madam, said Jones, the Lady who was here last Night and who staid the latest (for the other only brought me a Letter) is a Woman of very great Fashion and my near Relation. I don't know what Fashion she is of, answered Mrs. Miller, but I am sure ^^ Woman of Virtue, unless a very near Relation indeed, would visit a young Gentleman at ten Night, and stay four Hours in his Room with him alone; besides, Sir, the Behavior of her Chairmen shows what she was; for they did nothing but make Jests all the Evening in the Entry, and asked Mr. Partridge in the hearing of my own Maid, if Madam intended to stay with his Master all Night; with a great deal of Stuff not proper to be repeated. I have really a great Respect for you, Mr. Jones, upon your own Account, nay I have a very high Obligation to you for your Generosity to my Cousin. Indeed I did not know how very good you had been till lately. Little did I imagine to what dreadful Courses the poor Man's Distress had driven him. Little did I think when you gave me the ten Guineas, that you had given them to a Highwayman! O Heavens! What Goodness have you shown? How have you preserved this Family. -- The Character which Mr. Allworthy has formerly given me of you, was, I find, strictly true. -- And indeed if I had no Obligation to you, my Obligations to him are such, that, on his Account, I should show you the utmost Respect in my Power. -- Nay, believe me, dear Mr. Jones, if my Daughters and my own Reputation were out of the Case, I should, for your own Sake, be sorry that so pretty a young Gentleman should converse with these Women; but if you are resolved to do it, I must beg you to take another Lodging; for I do not myself like to have such Things carried on under my Roof; but more especially upon the Account of my Girls, who have little, Heaven knows, besides their Characters to recommend them.' Jones started and changed Color at the Name of Allworthy. 'Indeed, Mrs. Miller, answered he a little warmly, I do not take this at all kind. I will never bring any Slander on your House; but I must insist on seeing what Company I please in my own Room; and if that gives you any Offense, I shall, as soon as I am able, look for another Lodging.' 'I am sorry we must part then, Sir, said she, but I am convinced Mr. Allworthy himself would never come within my Doors, if he had the least Suspicion of my keeping an ill House.' -- 'Very well, Madam,' said Jones. -- 'I hope, Sir, said she, 'you are not angry; for I would not for the World offend any of Mr. Allworthy's Family. I have not slept a wink all Night about this Matter.' -- 'I am sorry, I have disturbed your Rest, Madam,' said Jones, but I beg you will send Partridge up to me immediately;' which she promised to do, and then with a very low Courtesy retired.  As soon as Partridge arrived, Jones fell upon him in the most outrageous manner. -- 'How often,' said he, 'am I to suffer for your Folly, or rather for my own in keeping you? Is that Tongue of yours resolved upon my Destruction?' -- 'What have I done, Sir?' answered affrighted Partridge, 'Who was it gave you Authority to mention the Story of the Robbery, or that the Man you saw here was the Person?' -- 'I Sir?' cries Partridge. 'Now don't be guilty of a Falsehood in denying it, said Jones.' -- 'If I did mention such a Matter, answers Partridge, 'I am sure, I thought no Harm: For I should not have opened my Lips, if it had not been to his own Friends and Relations, who, I imagined, would have let it go no farther.' 'But I have a much heavier Charge against you,' cries Jones, than this. How durst you, after all the Precautions I give you, mention the Name of Mr. Allworthy in this House?' Partridge denied that he ever had, with many Oaths. 'How else,' said Jones, should Mrs. Miller be acquainted that there was any Connection between him and me? And it is but this Moment she told me, she respected me on his Account.' -- 'O Lord, Sir,' said Partridge, I desire only to be heard out; and to be sure, never was any thing so unfortunate; hear me but out, and you will own how wrongfully you have accused me. When Mrs. Honor came down Stairs last Night, she met me in the Entry, and asked me when my Master had heard from Mr. Allworthy; and to be sure Mrs. Miller heard the very Words; and the Moment Madam Honor was gone, she called me into the Parlour to her.' 'Mr. Partridge,' says she, What Mr. Allworthy is that the Gentlewoman mentioned? Is it the great Mr. Allworthy of Somersetshire?' 'Upon my Word, Madam,' says I, I know nothing of the Matter.' -- 'Sure,' says she, 'your Master is not the Mr. Jones I have heard Mr. Allworthy talk of?' 'Upon my Word, Madam,' says I, I know nothing of the Matter.' -- 'Then,' says she, turning to her Daughter Nancy,' says she, as sure as ten Pence this is the very young Gentleman, and he agrees exactly with the Squire's Description. 'The Lord above knows who it was told her, for I am the arrantest Villain that ever walked upon two Legs if ever it came out of my Mouth. -- 'I promise you, Sir, I can keep a Secret when I am desired.' -- 'Nay, Sir, so far was I from telling her any thing about Mr. Allworthy, that I told her the very direct contrary: For though I did not contradict it at that Moment, yet as second Thoughts, they say, are best; so when I came to consider that some body must have informed her, thinks I to myself, I will put an End to the Story, and so I went back again into the Parlour some time afterward, and says I, Upon my word, says I, whoever, says I, told you that this Gentleman was Mr. Jones, that is, says I, that this Mr. Jones was that Mr. Jones, told you a confounded Lie; and I beg, says I, you will never mention any such Matter, says I: for my Master, says I, will think I must have told you so, and I defy any body in the House, ever to say, I mentioned any such Word. To be certain, Sir, it is a wonderful Thing, and I have been thinking with myself ever since, how it was she came to know it: not but I saw an old Woman here the other Day a begging at the Door, who looked as like her we saw in Warwickshire, that caused all that Mischief to us. To be sure it is never good to pass by an old Woman without giving her something, especially if she looks at you; for all the World shall never persuade me but that they have a great Power to do Mischief, and to be sure I shall never see at old Woman again, but I shall think to myself, Infandum, Regina, jubes renovare Dolorem.'  The Simplicity of Partridge set Jones a laughing and put a final end to his Anger, which had indeed seldom any long Duration in his Mind; and instead o^ commenting on his Defense, he told him he intende^ presently to leave those Lodgings, and ordered him t^ go and endeavor to get him others.  CHAP. IV. Which we hope will be very attentively perused i^ young People of both Sexes. PARTRIDGE had no sooner left Mr. Jones, tha^ Mr. Nightingale, with whom he had now contracted a great Intimacy, came to him, and after short Salutation, said, 'So Tom, I hear you had Company very late last Night. Upon my Soul, you are a happy Fellow, who have not been in Town above a Fortnight, and can keep Chairs waiting at you^ Door till two in the Morning.' He then ran on wit^ much commonplace Raillery of the same Kind, ^^ Jones, at last interrupted him, saying, 'I suppos^ you have received all this Information from M^^ Miller, who has been up here a little while ago to give me Warning. The good Woman is afraid, it seems, of the Reputation of her Daughters.' 'O she is wonderfully nice,' says Nightingale, 'upon that Account; if you remember, she would not let Nancy go with us to the Masquerade.' 'Nay, upon my Honor, I think she is in the Right of it,' says Jones; however I have taken her at her Word, and have sent Partridge to look for another Lodging.' 'If you will,' says Nightingale, we may, I believe, be again together; for to tell you a Secret, which I desire you will not mention in the Family, I intend to quit the House today.' -- 'What, has Mrs. Miller given you Warning too, my Friend?' cries Jones. 'No,' answered the other; but the Rooms are not convenient enough. -- Besides, I am grown weary of this part of the Town. I want to be nearer the Places of Diversion; so I am going to Pallmall. -- 'And do you intend to make a Secret of your going away?' said Jones. 'I promise you,' answered Nightingale, 'I don't intend to bilk my Lodgings; but I have a private Reason for not taking a formal Leave.' 'Not so private,' answered Jones; 'I promise you, I have seen it ever since the second Day of my coming to the House. -- Here will be some wet Eyes on your Departure. -- Poor Nancy, I pity her, faith! -- 'Indeed, Jack, you have played the Fool with that Girl -- You have given her a Longing, which I am afraid nothing will ever cure her of.' -- Nightingale answered, 'What the Devil would you have me do? Would you have me marry her to cure her?' -- 'No,' answered Jones, 'I would not have had you make Love to her, as you have often done in my Presence. I have been astonished at the Blindness of her Mother in never seeing i^.' 'Pugh, see it!' cries Nightingale, 'What the Devil should she see?' 'Why see,' said Jones, 'that you have made her Daughter distractedly in Love with you. The poor Girl cannot conceal it a Moment, her Eyes are never off from you, and she always colors every time you come into the Room. Indeed, I pity her heartily; for she seems to be one of the best natured, and honestest of human Creatures.' 'And so answered Nightingale, according to your Doctrine, one must not amuse one's self by any common Gallantries with Women, for fear they should fall in love with us.' 'Indeed, Jack,' said Jones, 'you wilfully misunderstand me; I do not fancy Women are so apt to fall in love; but you have gone far beyond common Gallantries.' -- 'What do you suppose,' says Nightingale, 'that we have been a bed together?' 'No, upon my Honor,' answered Jones, very seriously, 'I do not suppose so ill of you; nay, I will go farther, I do not imagine you have laid a regular premeditated Scheme for the Destruction of the Quiet of a poor little Creature, or have even foreseen the Consequence; for I am sure thou art a very good-natured Fellow, and such a one can never be guilty of a Cruelty of that Kind; but at the same time, you have pleased your own Vanity, without considering that this poor Girl was made a Sacrifice to it; and while you have had no Design but of amusing an idle Hour, you have actually given her Reason to flatter herself, that you had the most serious Designs in her Favor. Prithee, Jack, answer me honestly: To what have tended all those elegant and luscious Descriptions of Happiness arising from violent and mutual Fondness, all those warm Professions of Tenderness, and generous, disinterested Love? did you imagine she would not apply them? or speak ingenuously, did not you intend she should?' 'Upon my Soul, Tom,' cries Nightingale, 'I did not think this was in thee. Thou will make an admirable Parson. -- 'So, I suppose, you would not go to Bed to Nancy now, if she would let you?' -- 'No,' cries Jones, may I be d -- n'd if I would.' ' 'Tom, Tom,' answered Nightingale, 'last Night, remember last Night.'  ' -- When every Eye was closed, and the pale Moon, 'And silent Stars shone conscious of the Theft. 'Lookee, Mr. Nightingale,' said Jones, I am no 'canting Hypocrite, nor do I pretend to the Gift of Chastity, more than my Neighbors. I have been guilty with Women, I own it; but am not conscious that I have ever injured any -- nor would I to procure Pleasure to myself, be knowingly the Cause of Misery to any human Being.'  'Well, well,' said Nightingale, I believe you, and I am convinced you acquit me of any such Thing.'  'I do, from my Heart,' answered Jones, of having debauched the Girl, but not from having gained her Affections.'  'If I have,' said Nightingale, I am sorry for it; but Time and Absence will soon wear off such Impressions. It is a Receipt I must take myself: For to confess the Truth to you -- I never liked any Girl half so much in my whole Life; but I must let you into the whole Secret Tom. My Father has provided a Match for me, with a Woman I never saw, and she is now coming to Town, in order for me to make my Addresses to her.'  'At these Words Jones burst into a loud Fit of Laughter; when Nightingale cried, -- 'Nay, prithee don't turn me into Ridicule. The Devil take me if I am not half mad about this Matter! my poor Nanny! Oh Jones, Jones, I wish I had ^ Fortune in my own Possession.'  'I heartily wish you had,' cries Jones; 'for if th^^ be the Case, I sincerely pity you both: But surely you don't intend to go away without taking you^ Leave of her.'  'I would not, answered Nightingale, undergo the Pain of taking Leave for ten thousand Pound; besides, I am convinced, instead of answering an^ good Purpose, it would only serve to inflame m^ poor Nancy the more. I beg therefore, you would not mention a Word of it to day, and in the Eve^ing or tomorrow morning I intend to deaprt.'  Jones promised he would not, and said, upon Reflection he thought, as he had determined and w^ obliged to leave her, he took the most prudent Metho^ he then told Nightingale, he should be very glad ^ lodge in the same House with him; and it was accordingly agreed between them, that Nightingale should procure him either the Ground Floor or the two P^^ of Stairs; for the young Gentleman himself was ^^ occupy that which was between them.  This Nightingale, of whom we shall be present^^ obliged to say a little more, was in the ordina^^ Transactions of Life a Man of strict Honor, an^ what is more rare among young Gentlemen of t^^ Town, one of strict Honesty too; yet in Affairs ^^ Love he was somewhat looser in his Morals; not th^^ he was even here as void of Principle as Gentlem^^ sometimes are, and oftener affect to be; but it is certain he had been guilty of some indefensible Treachery to Women, and had in a certain Mystery call^ making Love, practiced many Deceits, which if ^^ had used in Trade he would have been counted ^^ greatest Villain upon Earth.  But as the World, I know not well for what Reason, agree to see this Treachery in a better Light, ^ was so far from being ashamed of his Iniquities of this Kind, that he gloried in them, and would often boast of his Skill in gaining of Women, and his Triumphs over their Hearts, for which he had before this Time received some Rebukes from Jones, who always expressed great Bitterness against any Misbehaviour to the fair Part of the Species, who, if considered, he said, as they ought to be, in the Light of the dearest Friends, were to be cultivated, honored, and caressed with the utmost Love and Tenderness; but if regarded as Enemies, were a Conquest of which a Man ought rather to be ashamed than to value himself upon it.  CHAP. V. A short Account of the History of Mrs. Miller. JONES this Day eat a pretty good Dinner for a sick Man, that is to say, the larger Half a Shoulder of Mutton. In the Afternoon he received an Invitation from Mrs. Miller to drink Tea: For that good Woman having learnt, either by Means of Partridge, or by some other Means natural or super natural, that he had a Connection with Mr. Allworthy, could not endure the Thoughts of parting with him in an angry Manner.  Jones accepted the Invitation; and no sooner was the Tea-kettle removed, and the Girls sent out of the Room, than the Widow, without much Preface, began as follows: 'Well, there are very surprising Things happen in this World; but certainly it is a wonderful Business, that I should have a Relation of Mr. Allworthy in my House, and never know any Thing of the Matter. Alas! Sir, you little imagine what a Friend that best of Gentlemen has been to me and mine. Yes, Sir, I am not ashamed to own it; it is owing to his Goodness, that I did not long since perish for Want, and leave my poor little Wretches, two destitute helpless friendless Orphans, to the Care or rather to the Cruelty of the World.'  'You must know, Sir, though I am now reduced to get my Living by letting Lodgings, I was born and bred a Gentlewoman. My Father was an Officer of the Army, and died in a considerable Rank: But he lived up to his Pay; and as that expired with him, his Family, at his Death, became Beggars. We were three Sisters. One of us had the good Luck to dies soon afterward of the Smallpox. A Lady was so kind to take the second out of Charity, as she said, to wait upon her. The Mother of this Lady had been a Servant to my Grandmother; and having inherited a vast Fortune from her Father, which he had got by Pawn-broking, was married to a Gentleman of great Estate and Fashion. She used my Sister so barbarously, often upraiding her with her Birth and Poverty, calling her in Derision a Gentlewoman, that I believe she at length broke the Heart of the poor Girl. In short, she likewise died within a Twelvemonth after my Father. Fortune thought proper to provide better for me, and within a Month from his Decease I was married to a Clergyman, who had been my Lover a long* Time before, and who had been very i^ used by my Father upon that Account; for though my poor Father could not give any of us a Shilling, yet he bred us up as delicately, considered us, and would have had us consider ourselves as highly, as if we had been the richest Heiresses. But my dear Husband forgot all this Usage, and the Moment we were become fatherless, he immediately renewed his Addresses to me so warmly, that I, who always liked, and now more than ever esteemed him, soon complied. Five Years did I live in a State of perfect Happiness with that best of Men, 'till at last -- Oh! cruel, cruel Fortune that ever separated us, that deprived me of the kindest of Husbands, and my poor Girls of the tenderest Parent. -- O my poor Girls! you never knew the Blessing which ye lost -- I am ashamed, Mr. Jones, of this womanish Weakness; but I shall never mention him without Tears.' -- 'I ought rather, Madam,' said Jones, 'to be ashamed that I do not accompany you.' -- Well, Sir,' continued she, 'I was now left a second Time in a much worse Condition than before; besides the terrible Affliction I was to encounter, I had now two Children to provide for; and was if possible more pennyless than ever, when that great, that good, that glorious Man, Mr. Allworthy, who had some little Acquaintance with my Husband, accidentally heard of my Distress, and immediately writ this Letter to me. Here, Sir; -- here it is; I put it into my Pocket to show it you. This is the Letter, Sir; I must and will read it you.'  Madam, I I heartily condole with you on your late grievous Loss, which your own good Sense, and the excellent Lessons you must have learnt from the worthiest of Men, will better enable you to bear, than any Advice which I am capable of giving. Nor have I any Doubt that you, whom I have heard to be the tenderest of Mothers, will suffer any immoderate Indulgence of Grief to prevent you from discharging your Duty to those poor Infants, who now alone stand in Need of your Tenderness.  However, as you must be supposed at present to be incapable of much worldly Consideration, you will pardon my having ordered a Person to wait on you, and to pay you Twenty Guineas, which I beg you will accept 'till I have the Pleasure of seeing you, and believe me to be, Madam, etc.   'This Letter, Sir, I received within a Fortnight after the irreparable Loss I have mentioned, and within a Fortnight afterward, Mr. Allworthy, -- the blessed Mr. Allworthy, came to pay me a Visit, when he placed me in the House you now see me, gave me a large Sum of Money to furnish it, and settled an Annuity of 50l. a Year upon me, which I have constantly received ever since. Judge then, Mr. Jones, in what Regard I must hold a Benefactor, to whom I owe the Preservation of my Life, and of those dear Children, for whose Sake alone my Life is valuable. -- Do not, therefore, think me impertinent, Mr. Jones, (since I must esteem one for whom I know Mr. Allworthy has so much Value) if I beg you not to converse with these wicked Women. You are a young Gentleman, and do not know half their artful Wiles. Do not be angry with me, Sir, for what I said upon account of my House; you must be sensible i^ would be the Ruin of my poor, dear Girls. Besides, Sir, you cannot but be acquainted, that Mr. Allworthy himself would never forgive my conniving at such Matters, and particularly with you.'  'Upon my Word, Madam,' said Jones, 'you need make no farther Apology; nor do I in the least take any Thing ill you have said; but give me Leave as no one can have more Value than myself for Mr. Allworthy, to deliver you from one Mistake which, perhaps, would not be altogether for his Honor: I do assure you, I am no Relation of his'  'Alas! Sir,' answered she, 'I know you are not. I know very well who you are; for Mr. Allworthy has told me all: But I do assure you, had you been twenty Times his Son, he could not have express^^ more Regard for you, than he has often expresse^ in my Presence. You need not be ashamed, Sir of what you are; I promise you no good Person will esteem you the less on that Account. No, Mr. Jones; the Words dishonorable Birth are Nonsense, as my dear, dear Husband used to say, unless the Word dishonorable be applied to the Parents; for the Children can derive no real Dishonor from an Act of which they are entirely innocent.'  Here Jones heaved a deep Sigh, and then said, Since I perceive, Madam, you really do know me, and Mr. Allworthy has thought proper to mention my Name to you; and since you have been so explicit with me as to your own Affairs, I will acquaint you with some more Circumstances concerning myself.' And these Mrs. Miller having expressed great Desire and Curiosity to hear, he began and related to her his whole History, without once mentioning the Name of Sophia.  There is a Kind of Sympathy in honest Minds, by Means of which they give an easy Credit to each other. Mrs. Miller believed all which Jones told her to be true, and expressed much pity and Concern for him. She was beginning to comment on the Story, but Jones interrupted her: For as the Hour of Assignation now drew nigh, he began to stipulate for a second Interview with the Lady that Evening, which he promised should be the last at her House; swearing, at the same Time, that she was one of great Distinction, and that nothing but what was entirely innocent was to pass between them; and I do firmly believe he intended to keep his Word.  Mrs. Miller was at length prevailed on, and Jones departed to his Chamber, where he sat alone till Twelve o'Clock, but no Lady Bellaston appeared.  As we have said that this Lady had a great Affection for Jones, and as it must have appeared that she really had so, the Reader may perhaps wonder at the first Failure of her Appointment, as she apprehended him to be confined by Sickness, a Season when Friendship seems most to require such Visits. This Behavior, therefore, in the Lady, may, by some, be condemned as unnatural; but that is not our Fault; for our Business is only to record Truth.  CHAP. VI. Containing a Scene which we doubt not will affect all our Readers. MR. Jones closed not his Eyes during all the former Part of the Night; not owing to any Uneasiness which he conceived at being disappointed by Lady Bellaston; nor was Sophia herself, though most of his waking Hours were justly to be charged to her Account, the present Cause of dispelling his Slumber^ In Fact, poor Jones was one of the best-natured fellows alive, and had all that Weakness which is called Compassion, and which distinguishes this imperfect Character from that noble Firmness of Mind, which rolls a Man as it were, within himself, and, like a polished Bowl, enables him to run through the Work without being once stopped by the Calamities which happen to others. He could not help, therefore, compassionating the Situation of poor Nancy, whose Lord for Mr. Nightingale seemed to him so apparent, th^^ he was astonished at the Blindness of her Mother who had more than once, the preceding Evening remarked to him the great Change in the Temper o^ her Daughter, 'who from being,' she said, one o^ the liveliest, merriest Girls in the World, was, o^ a sudden, become all Gloom and Melancholy.  Sleep, however, at length got the better of all Resistance; and now, as if he had really been a Deity as the Ancients imagined, and an offended one too, he seemed to enjoy his dear-bought Conquest. -- To speak simply, and without any Metaphor, Mr. Jones slept till Eleven the next Morning, and would, perhaps, have continued in the same quiet Situation much longer, had not a violent Uproar awakened him.  Partridge was now summoned, who, being asked what was the Matter, answered, 'That there was a dreadful Hurricane below Stairs; that Miss Nancy was in Fits; and that the other Sister and the Mother were both crying and lamenting over her.' Jones expressed much Concern at this News, which Partridge endeavored to relieve, by saying, with a Smile, 'He fancied the young Lady was in no Danger of Death; for that Susan (which was the Name of the Maid) had given him to understand, it was nothing more than a common Affair. In short,' said he, 'Miss Nancy has had a Mind to be as wise as her Mother, that is all. She was a little hungry, it seems, and so sat down to Dinner before Grace was said, and so there is a Child coming for the Foundling Hospital.' -- 'Prithee leave thy stupid jesting,' cries Jones; 'is the Misery of these poor Wretches a Subject of Mirth? Go immediately to Mrs. Miller, and tell her I beg Leave, -- Stay, you will make some Blunder, I will go myself; for she desired me to breakfast with her.' He then rose and dressed himself as fast as he could; and while he was dressing, Partridge, notwithstanding many severe Rebukes, could not avoid throwing forth certain Pieces of Brutality, commonly called Jests, on this Occasion. Jones was no sooner dressed than he walked down Stairs, and knocking at the Door was presently admitted, by the Maid into the outward Parlour, which was as empty of Company as it was of any Apparatus for eating. Mrs. Miller was in the inner Room with her Daughter, whence the Maid presently brought a Message to Mr. Jones, 'that her Mistress hoped he would excuse the Disappointment, but an Accident had happened, which made it impossible for her to have the Pleasure of his Company at Breakfast that Day, and begged his Pardon for not sending him up Notice sooner.' Jones 'desired she would give herself no Trouble about any Thing so triffling as his Disappointment; that he was heartily sorry for the Occasion; and that if he could be of any Service to her, she might command him.' He had scarce spoke these Words, when Mrs. Miller, who heard them all, suddenly threw open the Door, and coming out to him in a Flood of Tears, said 'O Mr. Jones, you are certainly one of the best young Men alive. I give you a thousand Thanks for your kind Offer of your Service; but, alas! Sir, it is out of your Power to preserve my poor Girl. -- O my Child, my Child! She is undone, she is ruined for ever!' 'I hope, Madam,' said Jones no Villain' -- 'O Mr. Jones,' said she, 'tha^ Villain who Yesterday left my Lodgings, has betrayed my poor Girl; has destroyed her, -- know you are a Man of Honor. You have good -- a noble Heart, Mr. Jones. The Actions to which I have been myself a Witness, could proceed from no other. I will tell you all: Nay indeed, it is impossible, after what has happened to keep it a Secret. That Nightingale, that barbarous Villain has undone my Daughter. She is -- she is -- oh! Mr. Jones, my Girl is with Child by him; and in that Condition he has deserted he^ Here! here, Sir, is his cruel Letter; read it, Mr. Jones, and tell me if such another Monster lives' The Letter was as follows:  Dear Nancy, As I found it impossible to mention to you what am afraid will be no less shocking to you, than it to me, I have taken this Method to inform you, that my Father insists upon my immediately paying my Addresses to a young Lady of Fortune, whom he has provided for my -- I need not write the detested Word. Your own good Understanding will make you sensible, how entirely I am obliged to an Obedience, by which I shall be for ever excluded from your dear Arms. The Fondness of your Mother may encourage you to trust her with the unhappy Consequence of our Love, which may be easily kept a Secret from the World, and for which I will take Care to provide, as I will for you. I wish you may feel less on this Account than I have suffered: But summon all your Fortitude to your Assistance, and forgive and forget the Man, whom nothing but the Prospect of certain Ruin, could have forced to write this Letter. I bid you forget me, I mean only as a Lover; but the best of Friends you shall ever find in  Your faithful, though unhappy J. N.   When Jones had read this Letter, they both stood ent during a Minute, looking at each other; at last began thus: 'I cannot express, Madam, how much I am shocked at what I have read; yet let me beg you, in one Particular, to take the Writer's Advice. Consider the Reputation of your Daughter',' -- 'It is gone, it is lost, Mr. Jones,' cried she, 'as well as her Innocence. She received the Letter ^n a Room-full of Company, and immediately swooning away upon opening it, the Contents were known to every one present. But the loss of her Reputation, bad as it is, is not the worst; I shall ^ose my Child; she has attempted twice to destroy herself already: And though she has been hitherto prevented, vows she will not outlive it; nor could I myself outlive any Accident of that Nature. -- What then will become of my little Betsy, a helpless, infant Orphan? And the poor, little Wret^^ will, I believe, break her Heart at the Miseries wi^^ which she sees her Sister and myself distracted, wh^ she is ignorant of the Cause. -- O it is the most sensible, and the best-natured little Thing. The barbarous cruel -- has destroyed us all. O my poo^ Children! Is this the Reward of all my Cares? this the Fruit of all my Prospects? Have I so cheerfully undergone all the Labors and Duties of Mother? Have I been so tender of their Infancy so careful of their Education? Have I been to^^ so many Years, denying myself even the Conv^niencies of Life to provide some little Sustena^^ for them, to lose one or both in such a Manner 'Indeed, Madam,' said Jones, with Tears in b^ Eyes, 'I pity you from my Soul.' -- 'O Mr. Jones,' answered she, 'even you, though I kno^ the Goodness of your Heart, can have no Idea what I feel. The best, the kindest, the most d^tiful of Children. O my poor Nancy, the Darli^^ of my Soul; the Delight of my Eyes; the Pride my Heart: Too much, indeed, my Pride; for these foolish, ambitious Hopes, arising from (...) Beauty, I owe her Ruin. Alas! I saw with Pleasure the Liking which this young Man had for h^^ I thought it an honorable Affection; and flatter my foolish Vanity with the Thoughts of seeing (...) married to one so much her superior. And a thousand Times in my Presence, nay, often in you^ he has endeavored to sooth and encourage the Hopes by the most generous Expressions of disinrested Love, which he has always directed to (...) poor Girl, and which I, as well as she, believed be real. Could I have believed that these were only Snares laid to betray the Innocence of my Chi^^ and for the Ruin of us all?' -- At these Words ^ittle Betsy came running into the Room, crying, 'Dear Mamma, for Heaven's Sake come to my Sister, for she is in another Fit, and my Cousin cannot hold her.' Mrs. Miller immediately obeyed the Summons; but first ordered Betsy to stay with Mr. Jones, and begged him to entertain her a few Minutes, saying, in the most pathetic Voice, 'Good Heaven! let me preserve one of my Children at least.'  Jones, in Compliance with this Request, did all he could to comfort the little Girl, though he was, in Reality, himself very highly affected with Mrs. Miller's Story. He told her, 'her Sister would be very well again soon: That by taking on in that Manner, she would not only make her Sister worse, but make her Mother ill too.' 'Indeed, Sir, says she, I would not do any Thing to hurt them for the World. I would burst my Heart, rather than they should see me cry. -- But my poor Sister cannot see me cry. -- I am afraid she will never be able to see me cry any more. Indeed, I cannot part with her; indeed I cannot. -- And then poor Mamma too, what will become of her? -- She says she will die too, and leave me; but I am resolved I will not be left behind.' 'And are you not afraid to die, my little Betsy?' said Jones. 'Yes,' answered she, 'I was always afraid to die; because I must have left my Mamma, and my Sister; but I am not afraid of going any where with those I love.'  Jones was so pleased with this Answer, that he ^^gerly kissed the Child; and soon after Mrs. Miller ^urned, saying, 'She thanked Heaven Nancy was ^ow come to herself. And now, Betsy,' says she, you may go in, for your Sister is better, and longs to see you.' She then turned to Jones, and began ^renew her Apologies for having disappointed him his Breakfast.  'I hope, Madam,' said Jones, 'I shall have a more exquisite Repast than any you could have provided for me. This, I assure you, will be the Case, if I can do any Service to this little Family of Love. Bu^ whatever Success may attend my Endeavors, I am resolved to attempt it. I am very much deceived in Mr. Nightingale, if, notwithstanding what hat^ happened, he has not much Goodness of Heart a^ the Bottom, as well as a very violent Affection for your Daughter. If this be the Case, I think the Picture which I shall lay before him, will affect him. Endeavor, Madam, to comfort yourself an^ Miss Nancy, as well as you can. I will go instantly in quest of Mr. Nightingale; and I hope to brin^ you good News.'  Mrs. Miller fell upon her Knees, and invoked a^ the Blessings of Heaven upon Mr. Jones; to which she aftewards added the most passionate Expressions o^ Gratitude. He then departed to find Mr. Nightingale, and the good Woman returned to comfort he Daughter, who was somewhat cheared at what he^ Mother told her; and both joined in resounding the Praises of Mr. Jones.  CHAP. VII. The Interview between Mr. Jones and Mr. Nightingale THE Good or Evil we confer on others, ve^^ often, I believe, recoils on ourselves. For Men of a benign Disposition enjoy their own Acts. Beneficence, equally with those to whom they a^ done, so there are scarce any Natures so entirely di^bolical, as to be capable of doing Injuries, with^^ paying themselves some Pangs, for the Ruin wh^^ they bring on their Fellow Creatures.  Mr. Nightingale, at least, was not such a Pers^ On the contrary, Jones found him in his new Lo^ings, sitting melancholy by the Fire, and silently menting the unhappy Situation in which he had placed poor Nancy. He no sooner saw his Friend appear, than he rose hastily to meet him; and after much Congratulation said, 'Nothing could have been more opportune than this kind Visit; for I was never more in the Spleen in my Life.'  'I am sorry,' answered Jones, 'that I bring News very unlikely to relieve you; nay, what I am convinced must, of all other, shock you the most. However, it is necessary you should know it. Without further Preface then, I come to you, Mr. Nightingale, from a worthy Family, which you have involved in Misery and Ruin.' Mr. Nightingale changed Color at these Words; but Jones, without regarding it, proceeded, in the liveliest Manner, to paint the tragical Story, with which the Reader was acquainted in the last Chapter.  Nightingale never once interrupted the Narration, though he discovered violent Emotions at many Parts of it. But when it was concluded, after fetching a ^eep Sigh, he said, 'What you tell me, my Friend, affects me in the tenderest Manner. Sure there never was so cursed an Accident as the poor Girl's betraying my Letter. Her Reputation might otherwise have been safe, and the Affair might have remained a profound Secret; and then the Girl might have gone off never the worse; for many such Things happen in this Town; and if the Husband should suspect a little, when it is too late, it will be his wiser Conduct to conceal his Suspicion both from his Wife and the World.'  'Indeed, my Friend,' answered Jones, 'this could not have been the Case with your poor Nancy. You have so entirely gained her Affections, that it is the Loss of you, and not of her Reputation, which afflicts her, and will end in the Destruction of her and her Family.' 'Nay, for that Matter, I promise you,' cries Nightingale, 'she has my Affections so absolutely, that my Wife, whoever she is to be, will have very little Share in them.' And is it possible then,' said Jones, 'you can think of deserting her?' 'Why what can I do?' answered the other.' 'Ask Miss Nancy;' replied Jones warmly. 'In the Condition to which you have reduced her, I sincerely think she ought to determine what Reparation you shall make her. Her Interest alone, and not yours, ought to be your sole Consideration. But if you ask me what you shall do; what can you do less,' cries Jones, 'than to fulfill the Expectations of her Family, and her own. Nay, and I sincerely tell you, they were mine too, ever since I first saw you together. You will pardon me, if I presume on the Friendship you have favored me with, moved as I am with Compassion for those poor Creatures. But your own Heart will best suggest to you, whether you have never intended, by your Conduct, to persuade the Mother, as well as the Daughter, into an Opinion, that you designed honorably: And if so, though there may have been no direct Promise of Marriage in the Case, I will leave to your own good Understanding, how far you are bound to proceed.'  'Nay, I must not only confess what you have hinted,' said Nightingale; 'but I am afraid even that very Promise you mention I have given.' 'And can you, after owning that,' said Jones, 'hesitate a Moment?' 'Consider, my Friend,' answered the other; 'I know you are a Man of Honor, and would advise no one to act contrary to its Rules; if there were no other Objection, can I, after this Publication of her Disgrace, think of such an Alliance with Honor?' 'Undoubtedly,' replied Jones; 'and the very best and truest Honor, which is Goodness, requires it of you. As you mention a Scruple of this Kind, you will give me leave to examine it. Can you, with Honor, be guilty of having, under false Pretenses, deceived a young Woman and her Family, and of having, by these Means, treacherously robbed her of her Innocence? Can you, with Honor, be the knowing, the wilful, nay, I must add, the artful Contriver of the Ruin of a Human Being? Can you, with Honor, destroy the Fame, the Peace, nay, probably, both the Life and Soul too of this Creature? Can Honor bear the Thought, that this Creature is a tender, helpless, defenseless young Woman? A young Woman who loves, who doats on you, who dies for you; who has placed the utmost Confidence in your Promises; and to that Confidence has sacrificed every Thing which is dear to her? Can Honor support such Contemplations as these a Moment?'  'Common Sense, indeed,' said Nightingale, 'warrants all you say; but yet you well know the Opinion of the World is so much the contrary, that was I to marry a Whore, though my own, I should be ashamed of ever showing my Face again.'  'Fie upon it, Mr. Nightingale,' said Jones, 'do not call her by so ungenerous a Name: When you promised to marry her, she became your Wife, and she has sinned more against Prudence than Virtue. And what is this World, which you would be ashamed to face, but the Vile, the Foolish, and the Profligate? Forgive me, if I say such a Shame must proceed from false Modesty, which always attends false Honor as its Shadow. -- But I am well assured there is not a Man of real Sense and Goodness in the World, who would not honor and applaud the Action. But admit no other would, would not your own Heart, my Friend, applaud it? And do not the warm, rapturous Sensations, which we feel from the Consciousness of an honest, noble, generous, benevolent Action, convey more Delight to the Mind, than the undeserved Praise of Millions? Set the Alternative fairly before your Eyes. On the one Side, see this poor, unhappy, tender, believing Girl, in the Arms of her wretched Mother, breathing her last. Hear her breaking Heart in Agonies sighing out your Name; and lamenting, rather than accusing, the Cruelty which weighs her down to Destruction. Paint to your Imagination the Circumstances of her fond, despairing Parent, driven to Madness, or, perhaps, to Death, by the Loss of her lovely Daughter. View the poor, helpless, Orphan-Infant: And when your Mind has dwelt a Moment only on such Ideas, consider yourself as the Cause of all; the Ruin of this poor, little, worthy, defenseless Family. On the other Side, consider yourself as relieving them from their temporary Sufferings. Think with what Joy, with what Transports, that lovely Creature will fly to your Arms. See her Blood returning to her pale Cheeks, her Fire to her languid Eyes, and Raptures to her tortured Breast. Consider the Exultations of her Mother, the Happiness of all. Think of this little Family made, by one Act of yours, completely happy. Think of this Alternative, and sure I am mistaken in my Friend, if it requires any long Deliberation, whether he will sink these Wretches down for ever, or, by one generous, noble Resolution, raise them all from the Brink of Misery and Despair, to the highest Pitch of human Happiness. Add to this but one Consideration more; the Consideration that it is your Duty so to do -- That the Misery from which you will relieve these poor People, is the Misery which you yourself have wilfully brought upon them.'  'O my dear Friend,' cries Nightingale, 'I wanted not your Eloquence to rouse me. I pity poor Nancy from my Soul, and would willingly give any Thing in my Power, that no Familiarities had ever passed between us. Nay, believe me, I had many Struggles with my Passion, before I could prevail with myself to write that cruel Letter, which has caused all the Misery in that unhappy Family. If I had no Inclinations to consult but my own, I would marry her Tomorrow Morning; I would, by Heaven; but you will easily imagine how impossible it would be to prevail on my Father to consent to such a Match; besides, he has provided another for me; and Tomorrow, by his express Command, I am to wait on the Lady.'  'I have not the Honor to know your Father,' said Jones; 'but suppose he could be persuaded, would you yourself consent to the only Means of preserving these poor People?' 'As eagerly as I would pursue my Happiness,' answered Nightingale; 'for I never shall find it in any other Woman. -- O my dear Friend, could you imagine what I have felt within these twelve Hours for my poor Girl, I am convinced she would not engross all your Pity. Passion leads me only to her; and if I had any foolish Scruples of Honor, you have fully satisfied them: Could my Father be induced to comply with my Desires, nothing would be wanting to complete my own Happiness, or that of my Nancy.'  'Then I am resolved to undertake it,' said Jones, 'You must not be angry with me, in whatever Light it may be necessary to set this Affair, which, you may depend on it, could not otherwise be long hid from him; for Things of this Nature make a quick Progress, when once they get abroad, as this unhappily has already. Besides, should any fatal Accident follow, as upon my Soul I am afraid will, unless immediately prevented, the Public would ring of your Name, in a Manner which, if your Father has common Humanity, must offend him. If you will therefore tell me where I may find the old Gentleman, I will not loose a Moment in the Business; which while I pursue, you cannot do a more genereous Action, than by paying a Visit to the poor Girl. You will find I have not exaggerated in the Account I have given of the Wretchedness of the Family.'  Nightingale immediately consented to the Proposal; and now having acquainted Jones with his Father's Lodging, and the Coffee-house where he would most probably find him, he hesitated a Moment, and then said, 'My dear Tom, you are going to undertake an Impossibility. If you knew my Father, you would never think of obtaining his Consent. -- Stay, there is one Way -- Suppose you told him I was already married, it might be easier to reconcile him to the Fact after it was done; and, upon my Honor, I am so affected with what you have said, and I love my Nancy so passionately, I almost wish it was done, whatever might be the Consequence.'  Jones greatly approved the Hint, and promised to pursue it. They then separated, Nightingale to visit his Nancy, and Jones in quest of the old Gentleman.  CHAP. VIII. What passed between Jones and old Mr. Nightingale, with the Arrival of a Person not yet mentioned in this History. NOtwithstanding the Sentiment of the Roman Satyrist, which denies the Divinity of Fortune; and the Opinion of Seneca to the same Purpose; Cicero, who was, I believe, a wiser Man than either of them, expressly holds the contrary; and certain it is there are some Incidents in Life so very strange and unaccountable, that it seems to require more than human Skill and Foresight in producing them.  Of this Kind was what now happened to Jones, who found Mr. Nightingale the elder in so critical a Minute, that Fortune, if she was really worthy all the Worship she received at Rome, could not have contrived such another. In short the old Gentleman and the Father of the young Lady whom he intended for his Son, had been hard at it for many Hours; and the ^atter was just now gone, and had left the former delighted with the Thoughts that he had succeeded in a long Contention which had been between the two Fathers of the future Bride and Bridegroom; in which both endeavored to overreach the other, and as not rarely happens in such Cases, both had retreated fully satisfied of having obtained the Victory.  This Gentleman whom Mr. Jones now visited, was what they call a Man of the World, that is to say, a Man who directs his Conduct in this World, as one who being fully persuaded there is no other, as resolved to make the most of this. In his early Years he had been bred to Trade, but having acquired a very good Fortune, he had lately declined his Business; or to speak more properly, had changed it from dealing in Goods to dealing only in Money, of which he had always a plentiful Fund at Command, and of which he knew very well how to make a very plentiful Advantage; sometimes of the Necessities of private Men, and sometimes those of the Public. He had indeed conversed so entirely with Money, that it may be almost doubted, whether he imagined there was any other thing really existing in the World; this at least may be certainly averred, that he firmly believed nothing else to have any real Value.  The Reader will, I fancy, allow, that Fortune could not have culled out a more improper Person for Mr. Jones to attack with any Probability of Success, nor could the whimsical Lady have directed this Attack at a more unseasonable Time.  As Money then was always uppermost in this Gentleman's Thoughts, so the Moment he saw a Stranger within his Doors, it immediately occurred to his Imagination, that such Stranger was either come to bring him Money, or to fetch it from him. And according as one or other of these Thoughts prevailed, he conceived a favorable or unfavourable Idea of the Person who approached him.  Unluckily for Jones, the latter of these was the Ascendant at present; for as a young Gentleman had visited him the Day before, with a Bill from his Son for a Play Debt, he apprehended at the first Sight of Jones, that he was come on such another Errand. Jones therefore had no sooner told him that he was come on his Son's Account, than the old Gentleman, being confirmed in his Suspicion, burst forth into an Exclamation, 'That he would lose his Labor.' 'Is it then possible, Sir,' answered Jones, 'that you can guess my Business?' If I do guess it, replied the other, I repeat again to you, you will lose your Labor. What, I suppose you are one of those Sparks who lead my Son into all those Scenes of Riot and Debauchery, which will be his Destruction; but I shall pay no more of his Bills I promise you. I expect he will quit all such Company for the future. If I had imagined otherwise I should not have provided a Wife for him; for I would be instrumental in the Ruin of no Body.' 'How, Sir, said Jones, and was this Lady of your providing?' 'Pray Sir,' answered the old Gentleman, 'how comes it to be any Concern of yours?' -- 'Nay, dear Sir,' replied Jones, 'be not offended that I interest myself in what regards your Son's Happiness, for whom I have so great an Honor and Value. It was upon that very Account I came to wait upon you. I cannot express the Satisfaction you have given me by what you say for I do assure you your Son is a Person for whom I have the highest Honor. -- Nay, Sir, it is not easy to express the Esteem I have for you, who could be so generous, so good, so kind, so indulgent to provide such a Match for your Son; a Woman who, I dare swear, will make him one of the happiest Men upon Earth.'  There is scarce any thing which so happily introduces Men to our good Liking, as having conceived some Alarm at their first Appearance; when once those Apprehensions begin to vanish, we soon forget the Fears which they occasion, and look on ourselves as indebted for our present Ease, to those very Persons who at first raised our Fears.  Thus it happened to Nightingale, who no sooner found that Jones had no Demand on him, as he suspected, than he began to be pleased with his Presence. 'Pray, good Sir, said he, be pleased to sit down. I do not remember to have ever had the Pleasure of seeing you before; but if you are a Friend of my Son, and have any thing to say concerning this young Lady, I shall be glad to hear you. As to her making him happy, it will be his own Fault if she does not. I have discharged my Duty, in taking Care of the main Article. She will bring him a Fortune capable of making any reasonable, prudent, sober Man happy.' 'Undoubtedly, cries Jones, for she is in herself a Fortune; so beautiful, so genteel, so sweet-tempered, and so well educated; she is indeed a most accomplished young Lady; sings admirably well, and has a most delicate Hand at the Harpsichord.' 'I did not know any of these Matters, answered the old Gentleman, for I never saw the the Lady; but I do not like her the worse for what you tell me; and I am the better pleased with her Father for not laying any Stress on these Qualifications in our Bargain. I shall always think it a Proof of his Understanding. A silly Fellow would have brought in these Articles as an Addition to her Fortune; but to give him his due, he never mentioned any such Matter; though to be sure they are no Disparagements to a Woman.' 'I do assure you, Sir,' cries Jones, 'she has them all in the most eminent Degree: For my Part I own I was afraid you might have been a little backward, a little less inclined to the Match: For your Son told me you had never seen the Lady, therefore I came, Sir, in that Case, to entreat you, to conjure you, as you value the Happiness of your Son, not to beaverse to his Match with a Woman who has not only all the good Qualities I have mentioned, but many more.' -- 'If that was your Business, Sir, said the old Gentleman, we are both obliged to you; and you may be perfectly easy, for I give you my Word I was very well satisfied with her Fortune.' 'Sir,' answered Jones, I honor you every Moment more and more. To be so easily satisfied, so very moderate on that Account, is a Proof of the Soundness of your Understanding, as well as the Nobleness of your Mind.' -- 'Not so very moderate, young Gentleman, not so very moderate, answered the Father. -- Still more and more noble, replied Jones, and give me Leave to add sensible: For sure it is little less than Madness to consider Money as the sole Foundation of Happiness. Such a Woman as this with her little, her nothing of a Fortune.' -- 'I find, cries the old Gentleman, you have a pretty just Opinion of Money, my Friend, or else you are better acquainted with the Person of the Lady than with her Circumstances. Why pray, what Fortune do you imagine this Lady to have?' -- 'What Fortune? cries Jones, why too contemptible a one to be named for your Son. Well, well, well, said the other, perhaps he might have done better.' -- 'That I deny, said Jones, for she is one of the best of Women.' 'Ay, ay, but in Point of Fortune I mean -- answered the other. -- And yet as to that now, how much do you imagine your Friend is to have?' -- 'How much, cries Jones, how much! -- Why at the utmost, perhaps, 200 l.' 'Do you mean to banter me, young Gentleman? said the Father a little angry.' -- 'No, upon my Soul, answered Jones, I am in Earnest, nay I believe I have gone to the utmost Farthing. If I do the Lady an Injury, I ask her Pardon.' 'Indeed you do, cries the Father. I am certain she has fifty Times that Sum, and she shall produce fifty to that before I consent that she shall marry my Son.' 'Nay, said Jones, it is too late to talk of Consent now -- If she has not fifty Farthings your Son is married.' -- 'My Son married! answered the old Gentleman with Surprise.' 'Nay, said Jones, 'I thought you was unacquainted with it.' -- 'My Son married to Miss Harris!' answered he again' -- 'To Miss Harris! Said Jones, no Sir, to Miss Nancy Miller, the Daughter of Mrs. Miller, at whose House he lodged; a young Lady, who, though her Mother is reduced to let Lodgings' -- 'Are you bantering, or are you in Earnest?' cries the Father with a most solemn Voice. 'Indeed, Sir, answered Jones, 'I scorn the Character of a Banterer. I came to you in most serious Earnest, imagining, as I find true, that your Son had never dared acquaint you with a Match so much inferior to him in Point of Fortune, though the Reputation of the Lady will suffer it no longer to remain a Secret.'  While the Father stood like one struck suddenly ^mb at this News, a Gentleman came into the ^oom, and saluted him by the Name of Brother.  But though these two were in Consanguinity so ^arly related, they were in their Dispositions almost ^e opposites to each other. The Brother who now arrived had likewise been bred to Trade, in which he no sooner saw himself worth 6000 l. than he purchase^ a small Estate with the greatest Part of it, and retired into the Country; where he married the Daughter o^ an unbeneficed Clergyman; a young Lady who, though she had neither Beauty nor Fortune, had recommended herself to his Choice, entirely by her good Humor, of which she possessed a very immoderate Share.  With this Woman he had, during twenty-five Years, lived a Life more resembling the Model which certain Poets ascribe to the Golden Age, than any o^ those Patterns which are furnished by the present Times. By her he had four Children, but none o^ them arrived at Maturity except only one Daughter, whom in vulgar Language he and his Wife had spoiled; that is, had educated with the utmost Tenderness and Fondness; which she returned to such a Degree, that she had actually refused a very extraordinary Match with a Gentleman a little turned of forty, because she could not bring herself to part with her Parents.  The young Lady whom Mr. Nightingale had intended for his Son was a near Neighbor of his Brother, and an Acquaintance of his Niece; and in reality it was upon the Account of this projected Match, that he was now come to Town; not indeed to forward, but to dissuade his Brother from a Purpose which he conceived would inevitably ruin his Nephew; for (...) foresaw no other Event, from a Union with Miss Harris, notwithstanding the Largeness of her Fortune, ^ neither her Person nor Mind seemed to him to promi^^ any Kind of matrimonial Felicity; for she was very tall, very thin, very ugly, very affected, very silly and very ill-natured.  His Brother therefore no sooner mentioned the Marriage of his Nephew with Miss Miller, than he expressed the utmost Satisfaction; and when the Father had very bitterly reviled his Son, and pronounced Sentence of Beggary upon him, the Uncle began in the following Manner.  'If you was a little cooler, Brother, I would ask you whether you love your Son for his Sake, or for your own. You would answer, I suppose, and so I suppose you think, for his Sake; and doubtless it is his Happiness which you intended in the Marriage you proposed for him.'  'Now, Brother, to prescribe Rules of Happiness to others, has always appeared to me very absurd, and to insist on doing this very tyrannical. It is a vulgar Error I know; but it is nevertheless an Error. And if this be absurd in other Things, it is mostly so in the Affair of Marriage, the Happiness of which depends entirely on the Affection which subsists between the Parties.'  'I have therefore always thought it unreasonable in Parents to desire to choose for their Children on this Occasion, since to force Affection is an impossible Attempt; nay, so much does Love abhor Force, that I know not whether through an unfortunate but incureable Perverseness in our Natures, it may not be even impatient of Persuasion.'  'It is, however, true, that though a Parent will not, I think, wisely prescribe, he ought to be consulted on this Occasion, and in Strictness perhaps should at least have a negative Voice. My Nephew therefore, I own, in marrying without asking your Advice, has been guilty of a Fault. But honestly speaking, Brother, have you not a little promoted this Fault? Have not your frequent Declarations on this Subject, given him a moral Certainty of your Refusal, where there was any Deficiency in Point of Fortune? nay, does not your present Anger arise solely from that Deficiency? And if he has failed in his Duty here, did not you as much exceed that Authority, when you absolutely bargained with him for a Woman without his Knowledge, whom you yourself never saw, and whom if you had seen and known as well as I, it must have been Madness in you, to have ever thought of bringing her into your Family.'  'Still I own my Nephew in a Fault; but surely it is not an unpardonable Fault. He has acted indeed without your Consent, in a Matter in which he ought to have asked it; but it is in a Matter in which his Interest is principally concerned; you yourself must and will acknowledge, that you consulted his Interest only, and if he unfortunately differed from you, and has been mistaken in his Notion of Happiness, will you, Brother, if you love your Son, carry him still wider from the Point? Will you increase the ill Consequences of his simple Choice? Will you endeavor to make an Event certain Misery to him, which may accidentally prove so? In a Word, Brother, because he has put it out of your Power to make his Circumstances as affluent as you would, will you distress them as much as you can?'  By the Force of the true Catholic Faith, St. Anthony won upon the Fishes. Orpheus and Amphi^^ went a little farther, and by the Charms of Music enchanted Things merely inanimate. Wonderful both ^ But neither History nor Fable have ever yet ventured to record an Instance of any one, who by Force o^ Argument and Reason had triumphed over habitu^^ Avarice.  Mr. Nightingale, the Father, instead of attempting to answer his Brother, contented himself with only observing, that they had always differed in their Sentiments concerning the Education of their Children. 'I wish, said he, Brother, you would have consined your Care to your own Daughter, and never have troubled yourself with my Son, who has, I believe, as little profited by your Precepts, as by your Example:' For young Nightingale was his Uncle's ^odson, and had lived more with him than with his ^ather. So that the Uncle had often declared, he loved ^is Nephew almost equally with his own Child.  Jones fell into Raptures with this good Gentleman; and when after much Persuasion, they found the Fa^er grew still more and more irritated, instead of ap^eased, Jones conducted the Uncle to his Nephew at ^^e House of Mrs. Miller.  CHAP. IX. Containing strange Matters. AT his Return to his Lodgings, Jones found the Situation of Affairs greatly altered from what ^^ey had been in at his Departure. The Mother, the ^wo Daughters and young Mr. Nightingale were now ^t down to Supper together, when the Uncle was, at ^s own Desire, introduced without any Ceremony to the Company, to all of whom he was well known; ^ he had several Times visited his Nephew at that ^ouse.  The old Gentleman immediately walked up to Miss Nancy, saluted and wished her Joy, as he did afterward the Mother and the other Sister; and lastly, ^ paid the proper Compliments to his Nephew, with ^e same good Humor and Curtesy, as if his Nephew ^d married his equal or superior in Fortune, with all ^e previous Requisites first performed.  Miss Nancy and her supposed Husband both turned ^e, and looked rather foolish than otherwise upon ^e Occasion; but Mrs. Miller took the first Oppor^^nity of withdrawing; and having sent for Jones into ^^e Dining Room, she threw herself at his Feet, and in a most passionate Flood of Tears, called him her good Angel, the preserver of her poor little Family, with many other respectful and endearing Appellations, and made him every Acknowledgment which the highest Benefit can extract from the most grateful Hearts.  After the first Gust of her Passion was a little over, which she declared, if she had not vented, would have burst her, she proceeded to inform Mr. Jones that all Matters were settled between Mr. Nightingale and her Daughter, and that they were to be married the next Morning: At which Mr. Jones having expressed much Pleasure, the poor Woman fell again into a Fit of Joy and Thanksgiving, which he at lengt^ with Difficulty silenced, and prevailed on her t^ return with him back to the Company, whom the^ found in the same good Humor in which they ha^ left them.  This little Society now past two or three very agreeable Hours together, in which the Uncle, wh^ was a very great Lover of his Bottle, had so w^ply'd his Nephew, that this latter, though not dru^^ began to be somewhat flustered; and now Mr. Nightingale taking the old Gentleman with him up St^^ into the Apartment he had lately occupied, unb^somed himself as follows.  'As you have been always the best and kindest Uncles to me, and as you have shown such un^^rallelled Goodness in forgiving this Match, which be sure may be thought a little improvident; I sho^ never forgive myself if I attempted to deceive y^^ in any thing.' He then confessed the Truth, a^ opened the whole Affair.  'How, Jack! said the old Gentleman, and ^ you really then not married to this young Woman No, upon my Honor, answered Nightingale have told you the simple Truth. My dear B^ cries the Uncle, kissing him, I am heartily glad to hear it. I never was better pleased in my Life. If you had been married, I should have assisted you as much as was in my Power, to have made the best of a bad Matter; but there is a great Difference between considering a Thing which is already done and irrecoverable, and that which is yet to do. Let your Reason have fair Play, Jack, and you will see this Match in so foolish and preposterous a Light, that there will be no Need of any dissuasive Arguguments.' 'How, Sir! replies young Nightingale, is there this Difference between having already done an Act, and being in Honor engaged to do it?' 'Pugh, said the Uncle, Honor is a Creature of the World's making, and the World has the Power of a Creator over it, and may govern and direct it as they please. Now you well know how trivial these Breaches of Contract are thought; even the grossest make but the Wonder and Conversation of a Day. Is there a Man who will be afterward more backward in giving you his Sister or Daughter? Or is there any Sister or Daughter who would be more backward to receive you? Honor is not concerned in these Engagements.' 'Pardon me, dear Sir, cries Nightingale, I can never think so; and not only Honor, but Conscience and Humanity are concerned. I am well satisfied, that was I now to disappoint the young Creature, her Death would be the Consequence, and I should look on myself as her Murderer; nay, as her Murderer by the cruel^est of all Methods, by breaking her Heart.' 'Break her Heart, indeed! no, no, Jack, cries the Uncle, the Hearts of Women are not so soon broke; they are tough, Boy, they are tough.' 'But, Sir, answered Nightingale, my own Affections are engaged, and I never could be happy with any other Woman.' 'How often have I heard you say, that Children should be always suffered to choose for themselves, and that you would let my Cousin Harriet do so!' 'Why ay, replied the old Gentleman, so I would have them, but then I would have them choose wisely.' -- 'Indeed, Jack, you must and shall leave this Girl.' -- 'Indeed, Uncle, cries the other, I must and will have her.' 'You will, young Gentleman? said the Uncle; I did not expect such a Word from you. I should not wonder if you had used such Language to your Father, who had always treated you like a Dog, and kept you at the Distance which a Tyrant preserves over his Subjects; but I who have lived with you upon an equal Footing might surely expect better Usage: But I know how to account for it all; it is all owing to your preposterous Education, in which I have had too little Share. There is my Daughter now, whom I have brought up as my Friend, never does any thing without my Advice, nor ever refuses to take it when I give it her.' 'You have never yet given her Advice in an Affair of this Kind, said Nightingale, for I am greatly mistaken in my Cousin, if she would be very ready to obey even your most positive Command in abandoning her Inclinations.' 'Don't abuse my Girl, answered the old Gentleman with some Emotion; don't abuse my Harriet. I have brought her up to have no Inclinations contrary to my own. By suffering her to do whatever she pleases I have enured her to a Habit of being pleased to do whatever I like.' 'Pardon me, Sir, said Nightingale, I have not the least Design to reflect on my Cousin, for whom I have the greatest Esteem and indeed I am convinced you will never put he^ to so severe a Trial, or lay such hard Command on her as you would do on me. -- But, dear Sir, le^ us return to the Company; for they will begin to be uneasy at our long Absence. I must beg on^ Favor of my dear Uncle, which is that he would not say any thing to shock the poor Girl or her Mother.' 'O you need not fear me, answered he, I understand myself too well to affront Women; so I will readily grant you that Favor; and in Return I must expect another of you.' 'There are but few of your Commands, Sir, said Nightingale, which I shall not very cheerfully obey.' 'Nay, Sir, I ask nothing, said the Uncle, but the Honor of your Company home to my Lodging, that I may reason the Case a little more fully with you: For I would if possible have the Satisfaction of preserving my Family, notwithstanding the headstrong Folly of my Brother, who, in his own Opinion, is the wisest Man in the World.'  Nightingale, who well knew his Uncle to be as ^^adstrong as his Father, submitted to attend him ^ome, and then they both returned back into the ^om, where the old Gentleman promised to carry himself with the same Decorum which he had before ^^aintained.  CHAP. X. A short Chapter which concludes the Book. THE long Absence of the Uncle and the Nephew occasioned some Disquiet in the Minds of whom they had left behind them; and the more, during the preceding Dialogue, the Uncle had ^re than once elevated his Voice, so as to be heard ^wn Stairs; which though they could not distin^^sh what he said, had caused some evil foreboding Nancy and her Mother, and indeed even in Jones ^^self.  When the good Company therefore again assembled, ^e was a visible Alteration in all their Faces; and good Humor which at their last Meeting, universally shone forth in every Countenance, was now changed into a much less agreeable Aspect. It was a Change indeed common enough to the Weather in this Climate, from Sunshine to Clouds, from June to December.  This Alteration was not however greatly remarked by any present; for as every one was now endeavoring to conceal their own Thoughts, and to act a Part, they became all too busily engaged in the Scene to be Spectators of it. Thus neither the Uncle nor Nephew saw any Symptoms of Suspicion in the Mother or Daughter nor did the Mother or Daughter remark the over-acted Complaisance of the old Man, nor the counterfeit Satisfaction which grinned in the Features of the young one.  Something like this, I believe, frequently happens where the whole Attention of two Friends being engaged in the Part which each is to act, in order to impose on the other, neither sees nor suspects the A^ practiced against himself; and thus the Thrust of bo^^ (to borrow no improper Metaphor on the Occasion alike takes Place.  From the same Reason it is no unusual Thing f^^ both Parties to be overreached in a Bargain, thoug^ the one must be always the greater Loser; as was ^^ who sold a blind Horse, and received a bad Note i^ Payment.  Our Company in about half an Hour broke up and the Uncle carried off his Nephew; but not before the latter had assured Miss Nancy, in a Whisper that he would attend her early in the Morning, an^ fulfill all his Engagements.  Jones, who was the least concerned in this Sce^^ saw the most. He did indeed suspect the very Fact for besides observing the great Alteration in the Behavior of the Uncle, the Distance he assumed, and ^ overstrained Civility to Miss Nancy; the carrying ^^ Bridegroom from his Bride at that Time of Night, was so extraordinary a Proceeding, that it could be only accounted for, by imagining that young Nightingale had revealed the whole Truth, which the ap^arent Openness of his Temper, and his being flustered with Liquor, made too probable.  While he was reasoning with himself, whether he could acquaint these poor People with his Suspicion, ^he Maid of the House informed him, that a Gentlewoman desired to speak with him. -- He went ^mmediately out, and taking the Candle from the Maid, ushered his Visitant up Stairs, who in the Person of Mrs. Honor acquainted him with such dread^ul News concerning his Sophia, that he immediately ^ost all Consideration for every other Person; and his whole Stock of Compassion was entirely swallowed ^p in Reflections on his own Misery, and on that of ^is unfortunate Angel.  What this dreadful Matter was, the Reader will be ^^formed, after we have first related the many preceding Steps which produced it, and those will be the Subject of the following Book.  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING BOOK XV. In which the History advances about two Days. CHAP. I. Too short to need a Preface. THERE are a Set of Religious, or rather Moral Writers, who teach that Virtue is the certain Road to Happiness, and Vice to Misery in this World. A very wholesome and comfortable Doctrine, and to which we have but one Objection, namely, That it is not true.  Indeed if by Virtue these Writers mean, the Exercise of those Cardinal Virtues, which like good House-wives stay at home, and mind only the Business of their own Family, I shall very readily conced the Point: For so surely do all these contribute an lead to Happiness, that I would almost wish, in Violation of all the ancient and modern Sages, to ca^ them rather by the Name of Wisdom, than by that o^ Virtue: For with regard to this Life, no System, I ^onceive, was ever wiser than that of the ancient ^picureans, who held this Wisdom to constitute the ^hief Good; nor foolisher than that of their Opposites, those modern Epicures, who place all Fe^^ity in the abundant Gratification of every sensual ^ppetite.  But if by Virtue is meant (as I almost think it ought) certain relative Quality, which is always busying self without Doors, and seems as much interested pursuing the Good of others as its own; I cannot easily agree that this is the surest way to human ^appiness; because I am afraid we must then include ^overty and Contempt, with all the Mischiefs which ^^ckbiting, Envy, and Ingratitude can bring on Man^d, in our Idea of Happiness; nay, sometimes per^^ps we shall be obliged to wait upon the said Happi^^ss to a Goal, since many by the above Virtue have ^^ought themselves thither.  I have not now Leisure to enter upon so large a ^eld of Speculation, as here seems opening upon ^e; my Design was to wipe off a Doctrine that lay my Way; since while Mr. Jones was acting the ^ost virtuous Part imaginable in laboring to preserve fellow Creatures from Destruction, the Devil, or ^e other evil Spirit, one perhaps clothed in human ^sh, was hard at Work to make him completely ^^serable in the Ruin of his Sophia.  This therefore would seem an Exception to the ^ve Rule, if indeed it was a Rule; but as we have ^our Voyage through Life seen so many other Ex^tions to it, we choose to dispute the Doctrine on ^ich it is founded, which we don't apprehend to be ^^ristian, which we are convinced is not true, and ^^ich is indeed destructive of one of the noblest Ar^ents that Reason alone can furnish for the Belief Immortality.  But as the Reader's Curiosity (if he has any) mu^^ be now awake, and hungry, we shall provide to feed it as fast as we can.  CHAP. II. In which is opened a very black Design against Sophia.
