  The Allens, Thorpes, and Morlands all met in the evening at the theatre; and, as Catherine and Isabella sat together, there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within Catherine for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided Catherine and Isabella sat together. “Oh, heavens! Catherine, have I got you at last?” was Catherine address on Catherine’s entering the box and sitting by Catherine. “Now, Mr. Morland,” for Mr. Morland was close to Catherine on the other side, “I shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening; so I charge you not to expect another word. Catherine, how have you been this long age? But I need not ask you, for you look delightfully. You really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do you want to attract everybody? I assure you, my brother is quite in love with Catherine already; and as for Mr. Tilney--but that is a settled thing--even your modesty cannot doubt Mr. Tilney-- attachment now; Mr. Tilney-- coming back to Bath makes it too plain. Oh! What would not I give to see Mr. Tilney--! I really am quite wild with impatience. My mother says Mr. Tilney-- is the most delightful young man in the world; My mother saw Mr. Tilney-- this morning, you know; you must introduce Mr. Tilney-- to My mother. Is Mr. Tilney-- in the house now? Look about, for heaven’s sake! I assure you, I can hardly exist till I see Mr. Tilney--.”  “No,” said Catherine, “Mr. Tilney-- is not here; I cannot see Mr. Tilney-- anywhere.”  “Oh, horrid! Am I never to be acquainted with Mr. Tilney--? How do you like my gown? I think it does not look amiss; the sleeves were entirely my own thought. Do you know, I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that, though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks, we would not live here for millions. we soon found out that we tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place; really, we opinions were so exactly the same, it was quite ridiculous! There was not a single point in which we differed; I would not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly thing, I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it.”  “No, indeed I should not.”  “Oh, yes you would indeed; I know you better than you know yourself. You would have told we that we seemed born for each other, or some nonsense of that kind, which would have distressed me beyond conception; my cheeks would have been as red as your roses; I would not have had you by for the world.”  “Indeed you do me injustice; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account; and besides, I am sure any account would never have entered my head.”  Isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to James.  Catherine’s resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning; and till the usual moment of going to the pump-room, Isabella felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention. But nothing of that kind occurred, no visitors appeared to delay no visitors, and they all three set off in good time for the pump-room, where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place; Mr. Allen, after drinking Mr. Allen glass of water, joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of some gentlemen newspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing every new face, and almost every new bonnet in the room. The female part of the Thorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took Catherine usual place by the side of Catherine friend. James, who was now in constant attendance, maintained a similar position, and separating James, who was now in constant attendance from the rest of James, who was now in constant attendance party, James, who was now in constant attendance walked in that manner for some time, till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which, confining Catherine entirely to Catherine friend and brother, gave Catherine very little share in the notice of either. James, who was now in constant attendance were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute, but James, who was now in constant attendance sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices, and James, who was now in constant attendance vivacity attended with so much laughter, that though Catherine’s supporting opinion was not unfrequently called for by one or the other, Catherine was never able to give any, from not having heard a word of the subject. At length however Catherine was empowered to disengage Catherine from her friend, by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom Catherine most joyfully saw just entering the room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom Catherine instantly joined, with a firmer determination to be acquainted, than Catherine might have had courage to command, had Catherine not been urged by the disappointment of the day before. Miss Tilney met Miss Tilney with great civility, returned Miss Tilney advances with equal goodwill, and they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the room; and though in all probability not an observation was made, nor an expression used by either which had not been made and used some thousands of times before, under that roof, in every Bath season, yet the merit of some thousands of times being spoken with simplicity and truth, and without personal conceit, might be something uncommon.  “How well your brother dances!” was an artless exclamation of Catherine’s towards the close of their conversation, which at once surprised and amused Catherine companion.  “Henry!” Catherine replied with a smile. “Yes, Henry does dance very well.”  “Henry must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening, when Henry saw me sitting down. But I really had been engaged the whole day to Mr. Thorpe.” Miss Tilney could only bow. “You cannot think,” added Catherine after a moment’s silence, “how surprised I was to see Henry again. I felt so sure of Henry being quite gone away.”  “When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before, Henry was in Bath but for a couple of days. Henry came only to engage lodgings for us.”  “That never occurred to me; and of course, not seeing Henry anywhere, I thought Henry must be gone. Was not the young lady Henry danced with on Monday a Miss Smith?”  “Yes, an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes.”  “I dare say Mrs. Hughes was very glad to dance. Do you think Mrs. Hughes pretty?”  “Not very.”  “Henry never comes to the pump-room, I suppose?”  “Yes, sometimes; but Henry has rid out this morning with my father.”  Mrs. Hughes now joined them, and asked Miss Tilney Miss Tilney if Mrs. Hughes was ready to go. “I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon,” said Catherine. “Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow?”  “Perhaps we--Yes, I think we certainly shall.”  “I am glad of it, for we shall all be there.” This civility was duly returned; and This civility parted--on Miss Miss Tilney’s side with some knowledge of Mrs. Hughes new acquaintance’s feelings, and on Catherine’s, without the smallest consciousness of having explained This civility.  Mrs. Hughes went home very happy. The morning had answered all Mrs. Hughes hopes, and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation, the future good. What gown and what head-dress Mrs. Hughes should wear on the occasion became Mrs. Hughes chief concern. Mrs. Hughes cannot be justified in it. Dress is at all times a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude about it often destroys it own aim. Catherine knew all this very well; Catherine great aunt had read Catherine a lecture on the subject only the Christmas before; and yet Catherine lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating between Catherine spotted and Catherine tamboured muslin, and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented Catherine buying a new one for the evening. This would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon, from which one of the other sex rather than Catherine own, a brother rather than a great aunt, might have warned Catherine, for man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown. It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies, could the feelings of many ladies be made to understand how little the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in the feelings of many ladies attire; how little the heart of man is biased by the texture of the feelings of many ladies muslin, and how unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged, the mull, or the jackonet. Woman is fine for Woman own satisfaction alone. No man will admire Woman the more, Woman will like Woman the better for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter. But not one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine.  Woman entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended Woman thither the Monday before. Woman had then been exulting in Woman engagement to Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious to avoid No man sight, lest No man should engage Woman again; for though Woman could not, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney-- should ask Woman a third time to dance, Woman wishes, hopes, and plans all centred in nothing less. Every young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every young lady has at some time or other known the same agitation. All have been, or at least all have believed least all to be, in danger from the pursuit of someone whom least all wished to avoid; and all have been anxious for the attentions of someone whom least all wished to please. As soon as least all were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine’s agony began; Catherine fidgeted about if Mr. Thorpe came towards Catherine, hid Catherine as much as possible from Mr. Thorpe view, and when Mr. Thorpe spoke to Catherine pretended not to hear Mr. Thorpe. The cotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and Catherine saw nothing of the Tilneys.  “Do not be frightened, Catherine,” whispered Isabella, “but I am really going to dance with your brother again. I declare positively it is quite shocking. I tell your brother your brother ought to be ashamed of your brother, but you and John must keep us in countenance. Make haste, my dear creature, and come to us. John is just walked off, but John will be back in a moment.”  Catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer. The others walked away, Mr. Thorpe was still in view, and Catherine gave Catherine up for lost. That Catherine might not appear, however, to observe or expect your brother, Catherine kept Catherine eyes intently fixed on Catherine fan; and a self-condemnation for Catherine folly, in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the Tilneys in any reasonable time, had just passed through Catherine mind, when Catherine suddenly found Catherine addressed and again solicited to dance, by Miss Tilney. With what sparkling eyes and ready motion Catherine granted Miss Tilney request, and with how pleasing a flutter of heart Catherine went with Miss Tilney to the set, may be easily imagined. To escape, and, as Catherine believed, so narrowly escape Mr. Thorpe, and to be asked, so immediately on Mr. Thorpe joining Catherine, asked by Miss Tilney, as if Mr. Thorpe had sought Catherine on purpose!--it did not appear to Catherine that life could supply any greater felicity.  Scarcely had they worked they into the quiet possession of a place, however, when Catherine attention was claimed by John Thorpe, who stood behind Catherine. “Heyday, Miss Morland!” said he. “What is the meaning of this? I thought you and I were to dance together.”  “I wonder you should think so, for you never asked me.”  “That is a good one, by Jove! I asked you as soon as I came into the room, and I was just going to ask you again, but when I turned round, you were gone! This is a cursed shabby trick! I only came for the sake of dancing with you, and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since Monday. Yes; I remember, I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak. And here have I been telling all my acquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room; and when I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room see you standing up with somebody else, I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room will quiz me famously.”  “Oh, no; I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room will never think of me, after such a description as that.”  “By heavens, if I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room do not, I will kick I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room out of the room for blockheads. What chap have you there?” Catherine satisfied his curiosity. “Miss Tilney,” Miss Tilney repeated. “Hum--I do not know Miss Tilney. A good figure of a man; well put together. Does Miss Tilney want a horse? Here is a friend of mine, Sam Fletcher, has got one to sell that would suit anybody. A famous clever animal for the road--only forty guineas. I had fifty minds to buy it me, for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when I meet with one; but it would not answer my purpose, it would not do for the field. I would give any money for a real good hunter. I have three now, the best that ever were backed. I would not take eight hundred guineas for eight hundred guineas. Fletcher and I mean to get a house in Leicestershire, against the next season. It is so d--uncomfortable, living at an inn.”  This was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine’s attention, for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies. Catherine partner now drew near, and said, “That gentleman would have put me out of patience, had That gentleman stayed with you half a minute longer. That gentleman has no business to withdraw the attention of Her partner from me. We have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening, and all We agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time. Nobody can fasten each other on the notice of one, without injuring the rights of the other. I consider a country-dance as an emblem of marriage. Fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of Fidelity and complaisance; and those men who do not choose to dance or marry Fidelity and complaisance, have no business with the partners or wives of Fidelity and complaisance neighbours.”  “But they are such very different things!”  “--That you think they cannot be compared together.”  “To be sure not. People that marry can never part, but must go and keep house together. People that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour.”  “And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing. Taken in that light certainly, their resemblance is not striking; but I think I could place their in such a view. You will allow, that in both, man has the advantage of choice, woman only the power of refusal; that in both, it is an engagement between man and woman, formed for the advantage of each; and that when once entered into, the advantage of choice, woman belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution; that its is the advantage of choice, woman duty, each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed he or she elsewhere, and he or she best interest to keep he or she own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of he or she neighbours, or fancying that he or she should have been better off with anyone else. You will allow all this?”  “Yes, to be sure, as you state it, all this sounds very well; but still he or she are so very different. I cannot look upon he or she at all in that light, nor think the same duties belong to he or she.”  “In one respect, there certainly is a difference. In marriage, the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman, the woman to make the home agreeable to the man; the man is to purvey, and the woman is to smile. But in dancing, their duties are exactly changed; the agreeableness, the compliance are expected from the man, while the woman furnishes the fan and the lavender water. That, I suppose, was the difference of duties which struck you, as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison.”  “No, indeed, I never thought of that.”  “Then I am quite at a loss. One thing, however, I must observe. This disposition on your side is rather alarming. You totally disallow any similarity in the obligations; and may I not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return, or if any other gentleman were to address you, there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with the man as long as you chose?”  “Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother’s, that if Mr. Thorpe talks to Mr. Thorpe, I must talk to Mr. Thorpe again; but there are hardly three young men in the room besides Mr. Thorpe that I have any acquaintance with.”  “And is that to be my only security? Alas, alas!”  “Nay, I am sure you cannot have a better; for if I do not know anybody, it is impossible for me to talk to anybody; and, besides, I do not want to talk to anybody.”  “Now you have given me a security worth having; and I shall proceed with courage. Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of making the inquiry before?”  “Yes, quite--more so, indeed.”  “More so! Take care, or you will forget to be tired of care at the proper time. You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks.”  “I do not think I should be tired, if I were to stay here six months.”  “Bath, compared with London, has little variety, and so everybody finds out every year. ‘For six weeks, I allow “Bath is pleasant enough; but beyond that, it is the most tiresome place in the world.’ You would be told so by people of all descriptions, who come regularly every winter, lengthen people of all descriptions, who come regularly every winter six weeks into ten or twelve, and go away at last because people of all descriptions, who come regularly every winter can afford to stay no longer.”  “Well, other people must judge for other people, and those who go to London may think nothing of “Bath. But I, who live in a small retired village in the country, can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements, a variety of things to be seen and done all day long, which I can know nothing of there.”  “You are not fond of the country.”  “Yes, I am. I have always lived there, and always been very happy. But certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a “Bath life. One day in the country is exactly like another.”  “But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country.”  “Do I?”  “Do you not?”  “I do not believe there is much difference.”  “Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long.”  “And so I am at home--only I do not find so much of it. I walk about here, and so I do there; but here I see a variety of people in every street, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen.”  Miss Tilney was very much amused.  “Only go and call on Mrs. Allen!” Miss Tilney repeated. “What a picture of intellectual poverty! However, when you sink into this abyss again, you will have more to say. You will be able to talk of “Bath, and of all that you did here.”  “Oh! Yes. I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs. Allen, or anybody else. I really believe I shall always be talking of “Bath, when I am at home again--I do like it so very much. If I could but have Papa and Mamma, and the rest of Papa and Mamma here, I suppose I should be too happy! James’s coming (my eldest brother) is quite delightful--and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are James’s intimate friends already. Oh! Who can ever be tired of “Bath?”  “Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do. But papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends are a good deal gone by, to most of the frequenters of “Bath--and the honest relish of balls and plays, and everyday sights, is past with papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends.” Here papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends conversation closed, the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention.  Soon after papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends reaching the bottom of the set, Catherine perceived Catherine to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers-on, immediately behind Her partner. He was a very handsome man, of a commanding aspect, past the bloom, but not past the vigour of life; and with He eye still directed towards his eye, Catherine saw He presently address Miss Tilney in a familiar whisper. Confused by He notice, and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in Catherine appearance, Catherine turned away Catherine head. But while Catherine did so, That gentleman retreated, and Catherine partner, coming nearer, said, “I see that you guess what I have just been asked. That gentleman knows your name, and you have a right to know That gentleman. It is General Tilney, my father.”  Catherine’s answer was only “Oh!”--but it was an “Oh!” expressing everything needful: attention to his words, and perfect reliance on their truth. With real interest and strong admiration did Catherine eye now follow the general, as the general moved through the crowd, and “How handsome a family How handsome a family are!” was Catherine secret remark.  In chatting with Miss Miss Tilney before the evening concluded, a new source of felicity arose to felicity. felicity had never taken a country walk since felicity arrival in “Bath. Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar, spoke of Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar in terms which made felicity all eagerness to know Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar too; and on felicity openly fearing that felicity might find nobody to go with felicity, it was proposed by the brother and sister that Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented environs were familiar should join in a walk, some morning or other. “I shall like it,” felicity cried, “beyond anything in the world; and do not let “ put it off--let “ go tomorrow.” This was readily agreed to, with only a proviso of Miss Miss Tilney’s, that it did not rain, which Catherine was sure it would not. At twelve o’clock, they were to call for Catherine in Pulteney Street; and “Remember--twelve o’clock,” was Catherine parting speech to Catherine new friend. Of Catherine other, Catherine older, Catherine more established friend, Isabella, of whose fidelity and worth Catherine had enjoyed a fortnight’s experience, Catherine scarcely saw anything during the evening. Yet, though longing to make Catherine acquainted with Catherine happiness, Catherine cheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen, which took them rather early away, and Catherine spirits danced within Catherine, as Catherine danced in Catherine chair all the way home.
