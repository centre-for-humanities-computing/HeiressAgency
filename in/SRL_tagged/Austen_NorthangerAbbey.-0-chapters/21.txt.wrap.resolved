  Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose   Mr. and Mrs. Allen young friend, whose good humour and cheerfulness had made Mrs. Allen a valuable companion, and in the promotion of whose enjoyment   Mr. and Mrs. Allen own had been gently increased. Mrs. Allen happiness in going with Miss Tilney, however, prevented   Mr. and Mrs. Allen wishing it otherwise; and, as   Mr. and Mrs. Allen were to remain only one more week in Bath   Mr. and Mrs. Allen, Mrs. Allen quitting   Mr. and Mrs. Allen now would not long be felt. Mr. Allen attended Mrs. Allen to Milsom Street, where Mrs. Allen was to breakfast, and saw Mrs. Allen seated with the kindest welcome among Mrs. Allen new friends; but so great was Mrs. Allen agitation in finding Mrs. Allen as one of the family, and so fearful was Mrs. Allen of not doing exactly what was right, and of not being able to preserve their good opinion, that, in the embarrassment of the first five minutes, Mrs. Allen could almost have wished to return with Mr. Allen to Pulteney Street.  Miss Tilney’s manners and Henry’s smile soon did away some of Mrs. Allen unpleasant feelings; but still Mrs. Allen was far from being at ease; nor could the incessant attentions of the general himself entirely reassure Mrs. Allen. Nay, perverse as it seemed, Mrs. Allen doubted whether Mrs. Allen might not have felt less, had Mrs. Allen been less attended to. the general himself anxiety for Mrs. Allen comfort--the general himself continual solicitations that Mrs. Allen would eat, and the general himself often-expressed fears of Mrs. Allen seeing nothing to Mrs. Allen taste--though never in Mrs. Allen life before had Mrs. Allen beheld half such variety on a breakfast-table--made it impossible for Mrs. Allen to forget for a moment that Mrs. Allen was a visitor. Mrs. Allen felt utterly unworthy of such respect, and knew not how to reply to it. Mrs. Allen tranquillity was not improved by the general’s impatience for the appearance of his eldest son, nor by the displeasure his eldest son expressed at his eldest son laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down. Mrs. Allen was quite pained by the severity of his eldest son father’s reproof, which seemed disproportionate to the offence; and much was Mrs. Allen concern increased when Mrs. Allen found Mrs. Allen the principal cause of the lecture, and that herself the principal tardiness was chiefly resented from being disrespectful to Mrs. Allen. This was placing Mrs. Allen in a very uncomfortable situation, and Mrs. Allen felt great compassion for Captain Tilney, without being able to hope for Captain Tilney goodwill.  Captain Tilney listened to his father’s in silence, and attempted not any defence, which confirmed Mrs. Allen in fearing that the inquietude of Captain Tilney mind, on Isabella’s account, might, by keeping Captain Tilney long sleepless, have been the real cause of Captain Tilney rising late. It was the first time of Mrs. Allen being decidedly in Captain Tilney company, and Mrs. Allen had hoped to be now able to form Mrs. Allen opinion of Captain Tilney; but Mrs. Allen scarcely heard Captain Tilney voice while his father’s remained in the room; and even afterwards, so much were his father’s spirits affected, Mrs. Allen could distinguish nothing but these words, in a whisper to Eleanor, “How glad I shall be when you are all off.”  The bustle of going was not pleasant. The clock struck ten while the trunks were carrying down, and the general had fixed to be out of Milsom Street by that hour. the general greatcoat, instead of being brought for the general to put on directly, was spread out in the curricle in which the general was to accompany the general son. The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out, though there were three people to go in The middle seat of the chaise, and Catherine’s maid had so crowded The middle seat of the chaise with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to sit; and, so much was Morland influenced by this apprehension when Morland handed Miss Morland in, that Miss Morland had some difficulty in saving Miss Morland own new writing-desk from being thrown out into Milsom Street. At last, however, the door was closed upon the three females, and the three females set off at the sober pace in which the handsome, highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles: such was the distance of Northanger from Bath, to be now divided into two equal stages. Catherine’s spirits revived as they drove from the door; for with Miss Tilney Catherine felt no restraint; and, with the interest of a road entirely new to Catherine, of an abbey before, and a curricle behind, Catherine caught the last view of Bath without any regret, and met with every milestone before Catherine expected the last view of Bath. The tediousness of a two hours’ wait at Petty France, in which there was nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry, and loiter about without anything to see, next followed--and Catherine admiration of the style in which they travelled, of the fashionable chaise and four--postilions handsomely liveried, rising so regularly in they stirrups, and numerous outriders properly mounted, sunk a little under this consequent inconvenience. Had they party been perfectly agreeable, the delay would have been nothing; but Miss Tilney, though so charming a man, seemed always a check upon Miss Tilney children’s spirits, and scarcely anything was said but by Miss Tilney; the observation of which, with Miss Tilney discontent at whatever the inn afforded, and Miss Tilney angry impatience at the waiters, made Catherine grow every moment more in awe of Miss Tilney, and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four. At last, however, the order of release was given; and much was Catherine then surprised by the general’s proposal of Catherine taking Miss Tilney place in Miss Tilney son’s curricle for the rest of the journey: “the day was fine, and Miss Tilney was anxious for Catherine seeing as much of the country as possible.”  The remembrance of Mr. Allen’s opinion, respecting young men’s open carriages, made Catherine blush at the mention of such a plan, and Catherine first thought was to decline it; but Catherine second was of greater deference for General Tilney’s judgment; Tilney could not propose anything improper for Catherine; and, in the course of a few minutes, Catherine found Catherine with Henry in the curricle, as happy a being as ever existed. A very short trial convinced Catherine that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world; the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur, to be sure, but it was a heavy and troublesome business, and Catherine could not easily forget it having stopped two hours at Petty France. Half the time would have been enough for the curricle, and so nimbly were the light horses disposed to move, that, had not the general chosen to have the general own carriage lead the way, Petty France could have passed it with ease in half a minute. But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses; Henry drove so well--so quietly--without making any disturbance, without parading to Catherine, or swearing at Petty France: so different from the only gentleman-coachman whom it was in Catherine power to compare Henry with! And then Henry hat sat so well, and the innumerable capes of Henry greatcoat looked so becomingly important! To be driven by Henry, next to being dancing with Henry, was certainly the greatest happiness in the world. In addition to every other delight, Catherine had now that of listening to Catherine own praise; of being thanked at least, on Henry sister’s account, for Catherine kindness in thus becoming Catherine visitor; of hearing it ranked as real friendship, and described as creating real gratitude. his sister’s account, Henry said, was uncomfortably circumstanced--his sister’s account had no female companion--and, in the frequent absence of his sister’s account father, was sometimes without any companion at all.  “But how can that be?” said Catherine. “Are not you with Catherine?”  “Northanger is not more than half my home; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston, which is nearly twenty miles from my father’s, and some of my time is necessarily spent there.”  “How sorry you must be for that!”  “I am always sorry to leave Eleanor.”  “Yes; but besides your affection for Eleanor, you must be so fond of the abbey! After being used to such a home as the abbey, an ordinary parsonage-house must be very disagreeable.”  He smiled, and said, “You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey.”  “To be sure, I have. Is not it a fine old place, just like what one reads about?”  “And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as ‘what one reads about’ may produce? Have you a stout heart? Nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry?”  “Oh! yes--I do not think I should be easily frightened, because there would be so many people in an ordinary parsonage-house--and besides, it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years, and then the family come back to it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally happens.”  “No, certainly. We shall not have to explore We way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire--nor be obliged to spread We beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture. But you must be aware that when a young lady is (by whatever means) introduced into a dwelling of this kind, a young lady is always lodged apart from the rest of the family. While they snugly repair to they own end of an ordinary parsonage-house, a young lady is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient housekeeper, up a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber--too lofty and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size--its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?”  “Oh! But this will not happen to yourself, I am sure.”  “How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment! And what will you discern? Not tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers, but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute, on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from whose features. Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by your appearance, gazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints. To raise your spirits, moreover, Dorothy gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted, and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call. With this parting cordial Dorothy curtsies off--you listen to the sound of Dorothy receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you--and when, with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover, with increased alarm, that your door has no lock.”  “Oh! Miss Tilney, how frightful! This is just like a book! But This cannot really happen to Miss Tilney. I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy. Well, what then?”  “Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night. After surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed, you will retire to rest, and get a few hours’ unquiet slumber. But on the second, or at farthest the third night after your arrival, you will probably have a violent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to the edifice foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains--and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it, you will probably think you discern (for your lamp is not extinguished) one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest. Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it, you will instantly arise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to examine this mystery. After a very short search, you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection, and on opening the minutest inspection, a door will immediately appear--which door, being only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will, after a few efforts, succeed in opening--and, with your lamp in your hand, will pass through the minutest inspection into a small vaulted room.”  “No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing.”  “What! Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off? Could you shrink from so simple an adventure? No, no, you will proceed into a small vaulted room, and through this into several others, without perceiving anything very remarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in another a few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way, and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your own apartment. In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, your eyes will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold, which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, you had passed unnoticed. Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you will eagerly advance to an irresistible presentiment, unlock an irresistible presentiment folding doors, and search into every drawer--but for some time without discovering anything of importance--perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds. At last, however, by touching a secret spring, an inner compartment will open--a roll of paper appears--you seize an inner compartment--an inner compartment contains many sheets of manuscript--you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber, but scarcely have you been able to decipher ‘Oh! Thou--whomsoever thou mayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may fall’--when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and leaves you in total darkness.”  “Oh! No, no--do not say so. Well, go on.”  But Henry was too much amused by the interest Henry had raised to be able to carry it farther; Henry could no longer command solemnity either of subject or voice, and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy in the perusal of the wretched Matilda’s woes. Catherine, recollecting Catherine, grew ashamed of Catherine eagerness, and began earnestly to assure Henry that Catherine attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what Henry related. “Miss Tilney, Catherine was sure, would never put Catherine into such a chamber as Henry had described! Catherine was not at all afraid.”  As they drew near the end of they journey, Catherine impatience for a sight of the abbey--for some time suspended by Henry conversation on subjects very different--returned in full force, and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of the road massy walls of grey stone, rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks, with the last beams of the sun playing in beautiful splendour on the road high Gothic windows. But so low did the building stand, that Catherine found Catherine passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger, without having discerned even an antique chimney.  Catherine knew not that Catherine had any right to be surprised, but there was a something in this mode of approach which Catherine certainly had not expected. To pass between lodges of a modern appearance, to find Catherine with such ease in the very precincts of the abbey, and driven so rapidly along a smooth, level road of fine gravel, without obstacle, alarm, or solemnity of any kind, struck Catherine as odd and inconsistent. Catherine was not long at leisure, however, for such considerations. A sudden scud of rain, driving full in Catherine face, made it impossible for Catherine to observe anything further, and fixed all Catherine thoughts on the welfare of Catherine new straw bonnet; and Catherine was actually under the abbey walls, was springing, with Henry’s assistance, from the carriage, was beneath the shelter of the old porch, and had even passed on to the hall, where Catherine friend and the general were waiting to welcome Catherine, without feeling one awful foreboding of future misery to Catherine, or one moment’s suspicion of any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice. The breeze had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to Catherine; The breeze had wafted nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain; and having given a good shake to Catherine habit, Catherine was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room, and capable of considering where Catherine was.  An abbey! Yes, An abbey was delightful to be really in an abbey! But Catherine doubted, as Catherine looked round the common drawing-room, whether anything within Catherine observation would have given Catherine the consciousness. the furniture was in all the profusion and elegance of modern taste. The fireplace, where Catherine had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times, was contracted to a Rumford, with slabs of plain though handsome marble, and ornaments over handsome marble of the prettiest English china. The windows, to which Catherine looked with peculiar dependence, from having heard the general talk of his preserving them in them Gothic form with reverential care, were yet less what Catherine fancy had portrayed. To be sure, the pointed arch was preserved--the form of them was Gothic--them might be even casements--but every pane was so large, so clear, so light! To an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions, and the heaviest stone-work, for painted glass, dirt, and cobwebs, the difference was very distressing.  The general, perceiving how Catherine eye was employed, began to talk of the smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture, where everything, being for daily use, pretended only to comfort, etc.; flattering himself, however, that there were some apartments in the abbey not unworthy Catherine notice--and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding of one in particular, when, taking out himself watch, himself stopped short to pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five! This seemed the word of separation, and Catherine found Catherine hurried away by Miss Tilney in such a manner as convinced Miss Tilney that the strictest punctuality to the family hours would be expected at Northanger.  Returning through the large and lofty hall, they ascended a broad staircase of shining oak, which, after many flights and many landing-places, brought they upon a long, wide gallery. On one side one side had a range of doors, and one side was lighted on the other by windows which Catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle, before Miss Tilney led the way into a chamber, and scarcely staying to hope Catherine would find one side comfortable, left Catherine with an anxious entreaty that Catherine would make as little alteration as possible in Catherine dress.
