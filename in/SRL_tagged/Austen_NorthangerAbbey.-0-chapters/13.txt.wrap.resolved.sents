  “Mrs.
Allen,” said Catherine the next morning, “will there be any harm in my calling on Miss Tilney today?
I shall not be easy till I have explained everything.”  “Go, by all means, my dear; only put on a white gown; Miss Tilney always wears white.”  Catherine cheerfully complied, and being properly equipped, was more impatient than ever to be at the pump-room, that Catherine might inform Catherine of General Tilney’s lodgings, for though Catherine believed they were in Milsom Street, Catherine was not certain of the house, and Mrs. Allen’s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful.
To Milsom Street Catherine was directed, and having made Catherine perfect in the number, hastened away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay Catherine visit, explain Catherine conduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, and resolutely turning away Catherine eyes, that Catherine might not be obliged to see Catherine beloved Isabella and Catherine dear family, who, Catherine had reason to believe, were in a shop hard by.
Catherine reached the house without any impediment, looked at the number, knocked at the door, and inquired for Miss Tilney.
Miss Tilney believed Miss Tilney Miss Tilney to be at home, but was not quite certain.
Would Catherine be pleased to send up Catherine name?
Catherine gave Catherine card.
In a few minutes the servant returned, and with a look which did not quite confirm the servant words, said the servant had been mistaken, for that Miss Tilney Miss Tilney was walked out.
Catherine, with a blush of mortification, left the house.
Catherine felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney Miss Tilney was at home, and too much offended to admit Catherine; and as Catherine retired down the street, could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, in expectation of seeing Catherine there, but no one appeared at them.
At the bottom of the street, however, Catherine looked back again, and then, not at a window, but issuing from the door, Catherine saw Miss TilneyMiss Tilney .
Catherine was followed by a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be Catherine father, and a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her father turned up towards Edgar’s Buildings.
Catherine, in deep mortification, proceeded on Catherine way.
Catherine could almost be angry Catherine at such angry incivility; but Catherine checked the resentful sensation; Catherine remembered Catherine own ignorance.
Catherine knew not how such an offence as Catherine might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness, to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead, nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make Catherine amenable.
Dejected and humbled, Catherine had even some thoughts of not going with the others to the theatre that night; but it must be confessed that the others were not of long continuance, for Catherine soon recollected, in the first place, that Catherine was without any excuse for staying at home; and, in the second, that it was a play Catherine wanted very much to see.
To the theatre accordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please Catherine; Catherine feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness for plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because the many perfections of the family, a fondness for plays was not to be ranked were habituated to the finer performances of the London stage, which Catherine knew, on Isabella’s authority, rendered everything else of the kind “quite horrid.” Catherine was not deceived in Catherine own expectation of pleasure; the comedy so well suspended Catherine care that no one, observing Catherine during the first four acts, would have supposed Catherine had any wretchedness about Catherine.
On the beginning of the fifth, however, the sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father, joining a party in the opposite box, recalled Catherine to anxiety and distress.
The stage could no longer excite genuine merriment--no longer keep Catherine whole attention.
Every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box; and, for the space of two entire scenes, did Catherine thus watch Henry Tilney, without being once able to catch Henry Tilney eye.
No longer could Henry Tilney be suspected of indifference for a play; Henry Tilney notice was never withdrawn from the stage during two whole scenes.
At length, however, Henry Tilney did look towards Catherine, and Henry Tilney bowed--but such a bow!
No smile, no continued observance attended no continued observance; Henry Tilney eyes were immediately returned to their former direction.
Catherine was restlessly miserable; Catherine could almost have run round to the box in which Henry Tilney sat and forced Henry Tilney to hear Catherine explanation.
Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed Catherine; instead of considering Catherine own dignity injured by this ready condemnation--instead of proudly resolving, in conscious innocence, to show Catherine resentment towards Henry Tilney who could harbour a doubt of it, to leave to Henry Tilney all the trouble of seeking an explanation, and to enlighten Henry Tilney on the past only by avoiding Henry Tilney sight, or flirting with somebody else--Catherine took to Catherine all the shame of misconduct, or at least of its appearance, and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause.
The play concluded--the curtain fell--Henry Tilney was no longer to be seen where Henry Tilney had hitherto sat, but Henry Tilney father remained, and perhaps Henry Tilney might be now coming round to their box.
Catherine was right; in a few minutes Henry Tilney appeared, and, making Henry Tilney way through the then thinning rows, spoke with like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and Catherine friend.
Not with such calmness was Henry Tilney answered by the latter: “Oh!
Henry Tilney, I have been quite wild to speak to Henry Tilney, and make my apologies.
You must have thought me so rude; but indeed it was not my own fault, was it, Mrs. Allen?
Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and Henry Tilney sister were gone out in a phaeton together?
And then what could I do?
But I had ten thousand times rather have been with Henry Tilney; now had not I, Mrs. Allen?”  “My dear, you tumble my gown,” was Mrs. Allen’s reply.
My dear assurance, however, standing sole as Her assurance did, was not thrown away; Her assurance brought a more cordial, more natural smile into his countenance, and his replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve: “We were much obliged to Henry Tilney at any rate for wishing We a pleasant walk after We passing you in Argyle Street: you were so kind as to look back on purpose.”  “But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk; I never thought of such a thing; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop; I called out to Mr. Thorpe as soon as ever I saw you; now, Mrs. Allen, did not--Oh!
You were not there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped, I would have jumped out and run after Mrs. Allen.”  Is there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such a declaration?
Henry Tilney at least was not.
With a yet sweeter smile, Henry Tilney said everything that need be said of Catherine’s concern, regret, and dependence on Catherine’s honour.
“Oh!
Do not say Henry Tilney Henry Tilney was not angry,” cried Catherine, “because I know Catherine was; for Catherine would not see me this morning when I called; I saw Catherine walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving the house; I was hurt, but I was not affronted.
Perhaps you did not know I had been there.”  “I was not within at the time; but I heard of the house from Eleanor, and Eleanor has been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such incivility; but perhaps I can do the house as well.
the house was nothing more than that my father--they were just preparing to walk out, and my father being hurried for time, and not caring to have the house put off--made a point of Eleanor being denied.
That was all, I do assure you.
Eleanor was very much vexed, and meant to make Eleanor apology as soon as possible.”  Catherine’s mind was greatly eased by this information, yet a something of solicitude remained, from which sprang the following question, thoroughly artless in this information, though rather distressing to the gentleman: “But, Henry Tilney, why were you less generous than your sister?
If Eleanor felt such confidence in my good intentions, and could suppose it to be only a mistake, why should you be so ready to take offence?”  “Me!
I take offence!”  “Nay, I am sure by your look, when you came into the box, you were angry.”  “I angry!
I could have no right.”  “Well, nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face.” Henry Tilney replied by asking Eleanor to make room for Henry Tilney, and talking of the play.
Henry Tilney remained with them some time, and was only too agreeable for Catherine to be contented when Henry Tilney went away.
Before them parted, however, it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon as possible; and, setting aside the misery of Henry Tilney quitting them box, Catherine was, upon the whole, left one of the happiest creatures in the world.
While talking to each other, Catherine had observed with some surprise that John Thorpe, who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together, was engaged in conversation with Henry Tilney; and Catherine felt something more than surprise when Catherine thought Catherine could perceive Catherine the object of some surprise that John Thorpe, who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together, was engaged in conversation with General Tilney attention and discourse.
What could some surprise that John Thorpe, who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes together, was engaged in conversation with General Tilney have to say of Catherine?
Catherine feared Henry Tilney did not like Catherine appearance: Catherine found it was implied in Henry Tilney preventing Catherine admittance to Henry Tilney daughter, rather than postpone Henry Tilney own walk a few minutes.
“How came Mr. Thorpe to know his father?” was Catherine anxious inquiry, as Catherine pointed them out to Catherine companion.
Mr. Thorpe knew nothing about it; but Mr. Thorpe father, like every military man, had a very large acquaintance.
When the entertainment was over, Mr. Thorpe came to assist his father, like every military man in getting out.
Catherine was the immediate object of Catherine gallantry; and, while his father, like every military man waited in the lobby for a chair, Catherine prevented the inquiry which had travelled from Catherine heart almost to the tip of Catherine tongue, by asking, in a consequential manner, whether Catherine had seen Catherine talking with Henry Tilney: “Catherine is a fine old fellow, upon my soul!
Stout, active--looks as young as Catherine son.
I have a great regard for his son, I assure you: a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived.”  “But how came you to know a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived?”  “Know a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived!
There are few people much about town that I do not know.
I have met a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived forever at the Bedford; and I knew a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived face again today the moment a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived came into the billiard-room.
One of the best players we have, by the by; and we had a little touch together, though I was almost afraid of a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived at first: the odds were five to four against a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived; and, if I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world--I took a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived ball exactly--but I could not make you understand his ball without a table; however, I did beat a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived.
A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew.
I should like to dine with A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew; I dare say A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew gives famous dinners.
But what do you think we have been talking of?
You.
Yes, by heavens!
And A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew thinks you the finest girl in Bath.”  “Oh!
Nonsense!
How can you say so?”  “And what do you think I said?”--lowering A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew voice--“well done, general, said I; I am quite of your mind.”  Here Catherine, who was much less gratified by A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew admiration than by General Tilney’s, was not sorry to be called away by Mrs. Allen.
Mr. Thorpe, however, would see Mr. Thorpe to Mr. Thorpe chair, and, till Mr. Thorpe entered it, continued the same kind of delicate flattery, in spite of Mr. Thorpe entreating A very fine fellow; as rich as a Jew to have done.
That Henry Tilney, instead of disliking, should admire Mr. Thorpe, was very delightful; and Mr. Thorpe joyfully thought that there was not one of the family whom Mr. Thorpe need now fear to meet.
The evening had done more, much more, for Mr. Thorpe than could have been expected.
