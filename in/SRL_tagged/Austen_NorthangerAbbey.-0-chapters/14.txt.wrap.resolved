  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have now passed in review before the reader; the events of each day, the reader hopes and fears, mortifications and pleasures, have been separately stated, and the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be described, and close the week. The Clifton scheme had been deferred, not relinquished, and on the afternoon’s Crescent of this day, The Clifton scheme was brought forward again. In a private consultation between Isabella and James, the former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going, and the latter no less anxiously placed his upon pleasing her, it was agreed that, provided the weather were fair, the party should take place on the following morning; and the party were to set off very early, in order to be at home in good time. The affair thus determined, and Thorpe’s approbation secured, Catherine only remained to be apprised of The affair. Catherine had left the party for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney. In that interval the plan was completed, and as soon as Catherine came again, Catherine agreement was demanded; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella, Catherine looked grave, was very sorry, but could not go. The engagement which ought to have kept Catherine from joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for Catherine to accompany the party now. Catherine had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take the party proposed walk tomorrow; it was quite determined, and Catherine would not, upon any account, retract. But that Catherine must and should retract was instantly the eager cry of both the Thorpes; she must and should retract must go to Clifton tomorrow, she must and should retract would not go without Catherine, it would be nothing to put off a mere walk for one day longer, and she must and should retract would not hear of a refusal. Catherine was distressed, but not subdued. “Do not urge me, Isabella. I am engaged to Miss Tilney. I cannot go.” This availed nothing. The same arguments assailed Catherine again; Catherine must go, Catherine should go, and The same arguments would not hear of a refusal. “It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney Miss Tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement, and must only beg to put off the walk till Tuesday.”  “No, it would not be easy. I could not do it. There has been no prior engagement.” But Isabella became only more and more urgent, calling on Isabella in the most affectionate manner, addressing Isabella by the most endearing names. Isabella was sure Isabella dearest, Catherine Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved Catherine so dearly. Isabella knew Isabella Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so sweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those Isabella loved. But all in vain; Catherine felt Catherine to be in the right, and though pained by such tender, such flattering supplication, could not allow the right to influence Catherine. Isabella then tried another method. Isabella reproached Isabella with having more affection for Miss Tilney, though Isabella had known Isabella so little a while, than for Isabella best and oldest friends, with being grown cold and indifferent, in short, towards Isabella. “I cannot help being jealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who love you so excessively! When once my affections are placed, it is not in the power of anything to change them. But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody’s; I am sure my feelings are too strong for my own peace; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick, I own. These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else.”  Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind. Was this reproach the part of a friend thus to expose Catherine feelings to the notice of others? Isabella appeared to Isabella ungenerous and selfish, regardless of everything but Isabella own gratification. These painful ideas crossed Isabella mind, though Isabella said nothing. Isabella, in the meanwhile, had applied Isabella handkerchief to Isabella eyes; and Morland, miserable at such a sight, could not help saying, “Nay, Catherine. I think you cannot stand out any longer now. The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a friend--I shall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse.”  This was the first time of Isabella brother’s openly siding against Isabella, and anxious to avoid her brother’s displeasure, Isabella proposed a compromise. If they would only put off they scheme till Tuesday, which they might easily do, as it depended only on they, Isabella could go with they, and everybody might then be satisfied. But “No, no, no!” was the immediate answer; “that could not be, for Thorpe did not know that Thorpe might not go to town on Tuesday.” Catherine was sorry, but could do no more; and a short silence ensued, which was broken by Isabella, who in a voice of cold resentment said, “Very well, then there is an end of the party. If Catherine does not go, I cannot. I cannot be the only woman. I would not, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing.”  “Catherine, you must go,” said James.  “But why cannot Thorpe drive one of Thorpe other sisters? I dare say either of his other sisters would like to go.”  “Thank ye,” cried Thorpe, “but I did not come to Bath to drive his other sisters about, and look like a fool. No, if you do not go, d---- me if I do. I only go for the sake of driving you.”  “That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure.” But Catherine words were lost on Thorpe, who had turned abruptly away.  The three others still continued together, walking in a most uncomfortable manner to CatherineCatherine; sometimes not a word was said, sometimes Catherine was again attacked with supplications or reproaches, and Catherine arm was still linked within Isabella’s, though The three others hearts were at war. At one moment Catherine was softened, at another irritated; always distressed, but always steady.  “I did not think you had been so obstinate, Catherine,” said James; “you were not used to be so hard to persuade; you once were the kindest, best-tempered of his other sisters.”  “I hope I am not less so now,” Catherine replied, very feelingly; “but indeed I cannot go. If I am wrong, I am doing what I believe to be right.”  “I suspect,” said Isabella, in a low voice, “there is no great struggle.”  Catherine’s heart swelled; Catherine’s drew away Catherine’s , and Isabella made no opposition. Thus passed a long ten minutes, till no opposition were again joined by Thorpe, who, coming to no opposition with a gayer look, said, “Well, I have settled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe conscience. I have been to Miss Tilney, and made your excuses.”  “You have not!” cried Catherine.  “I have, upon my soul. Left Catherine’s this moment. Told Catherine’s you had sent me to say that, having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us tomorrow, you could not have the pleasure of walking with Catherine’s till Tuesday. Catherine’s said very well, Tuesday was just as convenient to Catherine’s; so there is an end of all our difficulties. A pretty good thought of mine--hey?”  Isabella’s countenance was once more all smiles and good humour, and James too looked happy again.  “A most heavenly thought indeed! Now, my sweet Catherine, all our distresses are over; you are honourably acquitted, and our shall have a most delightful party.”  “This will not do,” said my sweet Catherine; “I cannot submit to this. I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set Miss Tilney right.”  Isabella, however, caught hold of one hand, Thorpe of the other, and remonstrances poured in from all three. James James was quite angry. When everything was settled, when Miss Tilney Miss Tilney said that Tuesday would suit Miss Tilney as well, it was quite ridiculous, quite absurd, to make any further objection.  “I do not care. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message. If I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss TilneyMiss Tilney . This is only doing it in a ruder way; and how do I know that Thorpe has--Thorpe may be mistaken again perhaps; Thorpe led me into one act of rudeness by Thorpe mistake on Friday. Let me go, Thorpe, do not hold me.”  Thorpe told Isabella it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys; they were turning the corner into Brock Street, when Thorpe had overtaken they, and were at home by this time.  “Then I will go after they,” said Catherine; “wherever they are I will go after they. It does not signify talking. If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into It.”  And with these words Isabella broke away and hurried off. Thorpe would have darted after Isabella, but Morland withheld Thorpe. “Let Isabella go, let Isabella go, if Isabella will go.”  “Isabella is as obstinate as--”  Thorpe never finished the simile, for Thorpe could hardly have been a proper one.  Away walked Catherine in great agitation, as fast as the crowd would permit Isabella, fearful of being pursued, yet determined to persevere. As Isabella walked, Isabella reflected on what had passed. It was painful to Isabella to disappoint and displease them, particularly to displease Isabella brother; but Isabella could not repent Isabella resistance. Setting Isabella own inclination apart, to have failed a second time in Isabella engagement to Miss Tilney, to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before, and on a false pretence too, must have been wrong. Isabella had not been withstanding them on selfish principles alone, Isabella had not consulted merely Isabella own gratification; that might have been ensured in some degree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, Isabella had attended to what was due to others, and to Isabella own character in others opinion. Isabella conviction of being right, however, was not enough to restore Isabella composure; till Isabella had spoken to Miss Tilney Miss Tilney Isabella could not be at ease; and quickening Isabella pace when Isabella got clear of the Crescent, Isabella almost ran over the remaining ground till Isabella gained the top of Milsom Street. So rapid had been Isabella movements that in spite of the Tilneys’ advantage in the outset, they were but just turning into they lodgings as Isabella came within view of they; and the servant still remaining at the open door, Isabella used only the ceremony of saying that Isabella must speak with Miss Tilney that moment, and hurrying by Tilney proceeded upstairs. Then, opening the first door before Isabella, which happened to be the right, Isabella immediately found Isabella in the drawing-room with General Tilney, Tilney son, and daughter. Isabella explanation, defective only in being--from Isabella irritation of nerves and shortness of breath--no explanation at all, was instantly given. “I am come in a great hurry--It was all a mistake--I never promised to go--I told them from the first I could not go.--I ran away in a great hurry to explain it.--I did not care what you thought of me.--I would not stay for the servant.”  The business, however, though not perfectly elucidated by this speech, soon ceased to be a puzzle. Catherine found that Thorpe had given the message; and Miss Tilney Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning Miss Tilney greatly surprised by no scruple. But whether Miss Tilney brother had still exceeded Miss Tilney in resentment, Catherine, though Catherine instinctively addressed Catherine as much to one as to the other in Catherine vindication, had no means of knowing. Whatever might have been felt before Catherine arrival, Catherine eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as Catherine could desire.  The affair thus happily settled, Catherine was introduced by Miss Tilney to Catherine father, and received by Tilney with such ready, such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe’s information to Catherine mind, and made Catherine think with pleasure that Tilney might be sometimes depended on. To such anxious attention was the general’s civility carried, that not aware of Catherine extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, Tilney was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced Catherine to open the door of the apartment herself. “What did William mean by it? William should make a point of inquiring into the matter.” And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted William innocence, it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of William master forever, if not William place, by Catherine rapidity.  After sitting with them a quarter of an hour, Catherine rose to take leave, and was then most agreeably surprised by Isabella’s asking Catherine if Catherine would do Isabella’s daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with Catherine. Miss Tilney added Miss Tilney own wishes. Catherine was greatly obliged; but it was quite out of Catherine power. Mr. and Mrs. Allen would expect Catherine back every moment. Isabella’s declared Isabella’s could say no more; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded; but on some other day Isabella’s trusted, when longer notice could be given, the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen would not refuse to spare Catherine to Catherine friend. “Oh, no; Catherine was sure the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen would not have the least objection, and Catherine should have great pleasure in coming.” Isabella’s attended Catherine himself to the street-door, saying everything gallant as they went downstairs, admiring the elasticity of Catherine walk, which corresponded exactly with the spirit of Catherine dancing, and making Catherine one of the most graceful bows Catherine had ever beheld, when they parted.  Catherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to Pulteney Street, walking, as Catherine concluded, with great elasticity, though Catherine had never thought of it before. Catherine reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party; and now that Catherine had been triumphant throughout, had carried Catherine point, and was secure of Catherine walk, Catherine began (as the flutter of Catherine spirits subsided) to doubt whether Catherine had been perfectly right. A sacrifice was always noble; and if Catherine had given way to their entreaties, Catherine should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased, a brother angry, and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed, perhaps through Catherine means. To ease Catherine mind, and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what Catherine own conduct had really been, Catherine took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the half-settled scheme of Catherine brother and the Thorpes for the following day. Mr. Allen caught at it directly. “Well,” said Mr. Allen, “and do you think of going too?”  “No; I had just engaged Mr. Allen to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it; and therefore you know I could not go with they, could I?”  “No, certainly not; and I am glad you do not think of it. These schemes are not at all the thing. Young men and women driving about the country in open carriages! Now and then it is very well; but going to inns and public places together! It is not right; and I wonder Thorpe should allow It. I am glad you do not think of going; I am sure Morland would not be pleased. Mr. Allen, are not you of my way of thinking? Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable?”  “Yes, very much so indeed. Open carriages are nasty things. A clean gown is not five minutes’ wear in Open carriages. You are splashed getting in and getting out; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction. I hate an open carriage myself.”  “I know you do; but that is not the question. Do not you think it has an odd appearance, if young ladies are frequently driven about in young ladies by young men, to whom young ladies are not even related?”  “Yes, my dear, a very odd appearance indeed. I cannot bear to see it.”  “Dear madam,” cried Catherine, “then why did not you tell me so before? I am sure if I had known it to be improper, I would not have gone with Thorpe at all; but I always hoped you would tell me, if you thought I was doing wrong.”  “And so I should, my dear, you may depend on it; for as I told Morland at parting, I would always do the best for you in my power. But one must not be over particular. Young people will be young people, as your good mother says your good mother. You know I wanted you, when we first came, not to buy that sprigged muslin, but you would. Young people do not like to be always thwarted.”  “But this was something of real consequence; and I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade.”  “As far as it has gone hitherto, there is no harm done,” said Mr. Allen; “and I would only advise you, my dear, not to go out with Thorpe any more.”  “That is just what I was going to say,” added Thorpe wife.  Catherine, relieved for his wife, felt uneasy for Isabella, and after a momentIsabella’s thought, asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in Isabella to write to Miss Thorpe, and explain the indecorum of which Isabella must be as insensible as Isabella; for Isabella considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day, in spite of what had passed. Mr. Allen, however, discouraged Isabella from doing any such thing. “You had better leave Isabella alone, my dear; Isabella is old enough to know what Isabella is about, and if not, has a mother to advise Isabella. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt; but, however, you had better not interfere. Thorpe and your brother choose to go, and you will be only getting ill will.”  Catherine submitted, and though sorry to think that Isabella should be doing wrong, felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen’s approbation of Isabella own conduct, and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error Isabella. Isabella escape from being one of the party to Clifton was now an escape indeed; for what would the Tilneys have thought of Isabella, if Isabella had broken Isabella promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself, if Isabella had been guilty of one breach of propriety, only to enable Isabella to be guilty of another?
