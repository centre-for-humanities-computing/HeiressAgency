  The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella:   Bath, April  My dearest Catherine, I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight, and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering your two kind letters sooner. I really am quite ashamed of my idleness; but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing. I have had my pen in my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath, but have always been prevented by some silly trifler or other. Pray write to My dearest Catherine soon, and direct to my own home. Thank God, we leave this horrid place tomorrow. Since you went away, I have had no pleasure in it--the dust is beyond anything; and everybody one cares for is gone. I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest, for you are dearer to My dearest Catherine than anybody can conceive. I am quite uneasy about your dear brother, not having heard from your dear brother since your dear brother went to Oxford; and am fearful of some misunderstanding. Your kind offices will set all right: your dear brother is the only man I ever did or could love, and I trust you will convince your dear brother of all right. The spring fashions are partly down; and the hats the most frightful you can imagine. I hope you spend your time pleasantly, but am afraid you never think of My dearest Catherine. I will not say all that I could of the family you are with, because I would not be ungenerous, or set you against those you esteem; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust, and young men never know young men minds two days together. I rejoice to say that the young man whom, of all others, I particularly abhor, has left Bath. You will know, from this description, I must mean Captain Tilney, who, as you may remember, was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me, before you went away. Afterwards your dear brother got worse, and became quite my shadow. Many girls might have been taken in, for never were such attentions; but I knew the fickle sex too well. your dear brother went away to your dear brother regiment two days ago, and I trust I shall never be plagued with your dear brother again. your dear brother is the greatest coxcomb I ever saw, and amazingly disagreeable. The last two days your dear brother was always by the side of Charlotte Davis: I pitied your dear brother taste, but took no notice of your dear brother. The last time we met was in Bath Street, and I turned directly into a shop that your dear brother might not speak to your dear brother; I would not even look at your dear brother. your dear brother went into the pump-room afterwards; but I would not have followed your dear brother for all the world. Such a contrast between your dear brother and your brother! Pray send me some news of the latter--I am quite unhappy about your dear brother; your dear brother seemed so uncomfortable when your dear brother went away, with a cold, or something that affected your dear brother spirits. I would write to your dear brother your dear brother, but have mislaid your dear brother direction; and, as I hinted above, am afraid your dear brother took something in my conduct amiss. Pray explain everything to your dear brother satisfaction; or, if your dear brother still harbours any doubt, a line from your dear brother to your dear brother, or a call at Putney when next in town, might set all to rights. I have not been to the rooms this age, nor to the play, except going in last night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half price: they teased me into it; and I was determined they should not say I shut your dear brother up because Tilney was gone. We happened to sit by the Mitchells, and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me out. I knew they spite: at one time they could not be civil to your dear brother, but now they are all friendship; but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by they. You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own. Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine, as I wore a turban like mine the week before at the concert, but made wretched work of a turban like mine--a turban like mine happened to become my odd face, I believe, at least Tilney told me so at the time, and said every eye was upon your dear brother; but Tilney is the last man whose word I would take. I wear nothing but purple now: I know I look hideous in it, but no matter--it is your dear brother’s favourite colour. Lose no time, my dearest, sweetest Catherine, in writing to Catherine and to me, Who ever am, etc.   Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine. Its inconsistencies, contradictions, and falsehood struck Anne Mitchell from the very first. Anne Mitchell was ashamed of Isabella, and ashamed of having ever loved Anne Mitchell. Anne Mitchell professions of attachment were now as disgusting as Anne Mitchell excuses were empty, and Anne Mitchell demands impudent. “Write to James on Anne Mitchell behalf! No, James should never hear Isabella’s name mentioned by Isabella again.”  On Henry’s arrival from Woodston, Isabella made known to James and Eleanor him and Eleanor brother’s safety, congratulating him and Eleanor with sincerity on it, and reading aloud the most material passages of Isabella letter with strong indignation. When Isabella had finished it--“So much for Isabella,” Isabella cried, “and for all our intimacy! Isabella must think me an idiot, or Isabella could not have written so; but perhaps this has served to make Isabella character better known to Isabella than mine is to Isabella. I see what Isabella has been about. Isabella is a vain coquette, and Isabella tricks have not answered. I do not believe Isabella had ever any regard either for James or for Isabella, and I wish I had never known Isabella.”  “It will soon be as if you never had,” said Henry.  “There is but one thing that I cannot understand. I see that Isabella has had designs on Captain Tilney, which have not succeeded; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time. Why should Captain Tilney pay Isabella such attentions as to make Isabella quarrel with my brother, and then fly off my brother?”  “I have very little to say for Frederick’s motives, such as I believe Frederick’s motives to have been. Frederick’s has Frederick’s vanities as well as Miss Thorpe, and the chief difference is, that, having a stronger head, Frederick’s motives have not yet injured Frederick’s. If the effect of Frederick’s behaviour does not justify Frederick’s with you, we had better not seek after the cause.”  “Then you do not suppose Frederick’s ever really cared about Isabella?”  “I am persuaded that Frederick’s never did.”  “And only made believe to do so for mischief’s sake?”  Henry bowed Henry assent.  “Well, then, I must say that I do not like Frederick’s at all. Though it has turned out so well for we, I do not like Frederick’s at all. As it happens, there is no great harm done, because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose. But, suppose Frederick’s had made Isabella very much in love with Frederick’s?”  “But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose--consequently to have been a very different creature; and, in that case, Isabella would have met with very different treatment.”  “It is very right that you should stand by your brother.”  “And if you would stand by yours, you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe. But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity, and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality, or a desire of revenge.”  Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness. Frederick could not be unpardonably guilty, while Henry made Frederick so agreeable. Catherine resolved on not answering Isabella’s letter, and tried to think no more of it.
