  Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening, in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe, though they certainly claimed much of   Catherine leisure, as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which   Catherine eye could reach; but   Catherine looked in vain.
Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room.
Catherine hoped to be more fortunate the next day; and when   Catherine wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning,   Catherine hardly felt a doubt of it; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of it inhabitants, and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is.
As soon as divine service was over, the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other; and after staying long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable, and that there was not a genteel face to be seen, which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season, the Thorpes and Allens hastened away to the Crescent, to breathe the fresh air of better company.
Here Catherine and Isabella, arm in arm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation; the Thorpes and Allens talked much, and with much enjoyment; but again was Catherine disappointed in Catherine hope of reseeing Catherine partner.
He was nowhere to be met with; every search for He was equally unsuccessful, in morning lounges or evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms, at dressed or undressed balls, was He perceivable; nor among the walkers, the horsemen, or the curricle-drivers of the morning.
He name was not in the pump-room book, and curiosity could do no more.
He must be gone from Bath.
Yet He had not mentioned that He stay would be so short!
This sort of mysteriousness, which is always so becoming in a hero, threw a fresh grace in Catherine’s imagination around He person and manners, and increased Catherine anxiety to know more of He.
From the Thorpes Catherine could learn nothing, for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen.
It was a subject, however, in which Catherine often indulged with Catherine fair friend, from whom Catherine received every possible encouragement to continue to think of He; and He impression on Catherine fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken.
Catherine was very sure that He must be a charming young man, and was equally sure that He must have been delighted with Catherine dear Catherine, and would therefore shortly return.
Catherine liked He the better for being a clergyman, “for Catherine must confess Catherine very partial to the profession”; and something like a sigh escaped Catherine as Catherine said it.
Perhaps her dear Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion--but her dear Catherine was not experienced enough in the finesse of love, or the duties of friendship, to know when delicate raillery was properly called for, or when a confidence should be forced.
her dear Catherine was now quite happy--quite satisfied with Bath.
her dear Catherine had found some acquaintance, had been so lucky too as to find in some acquaintance the family of a most worthy old friend; and, as the completion of good fortune, had found some acquaintance by no means so expensively dressed as her dear Catherine.
her dear Catherine daily expressions were no longer, “I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath!” some acquaintance were changed into, “How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe!” and Mrs. Thorpe was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families, as Mrs. Thorpe young charge and Isabella themselves could be; never satisfied with the day unless Mrs. Thorpe spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance of subject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of Mrs. Thorpe children, and Mrs. Allen of Mrs. Thorpe gowns.
The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm, and Catherine and Isabella passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of its to be given to Catherine and Isabella friends or Catherine and Isabella.
Catherine and Isabella called each other by Catherine and Isabella Christian name, were always arm in arm when Catherine and Isabella walked, pinned up each other’s train for the dance, and were not to be divided in the set; and if a rainy morning deprived Catherine and Isabella of other enjoyments, Catherine and Isabella were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt, and shut Catherine and Isabella up, to read novels together.
Yes, novels; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by ungenerous and impolitic custom contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which ungenerous and impolitic custom are ungenerous and impolitic custom adding--joining with ungenerous and impolitic custom greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting ungenerous and impolitic custom to be read by ungenerous and impolitic custom own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over she accidentally take up a novel insipid pages with disgust.
Alas!
If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard?
I cannot approve of it.
Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at the reviewers leisure, and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans.
Let us not desert one another; us are an injured body.
Although us productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has been so much decried.
From pride, ignorance, or fashion, us foes are almost as many as our readers.
And while the abilities of the nine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne, are eulogized by a thousand pens--there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and of slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to recommend the abilities of the nine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne, are eulogized by a thousand pens.
“I am no novel-reader--I seldom look into novels--Do not imagine that I often read novels--It is really very well for a novel.”  Such is the common cant.
“And what are you reading, Miss--?” “Oh!
It is only a novel!” replies the young lady, while the young lady lays down the young lady book with affected indifference, or momentary shame.
“It is only Cecilia, or Camilla, or Belinda”; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language.
Now, had the same young lady been engaged with a volume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly would the same young lady have produced the book, and told the book name; though the chances must be against the same young lady being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication, of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of taste: the substance of the book papers so often consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and topics of conversation which no longer concern anyone living; and anyone language, too, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age that could endure it.
