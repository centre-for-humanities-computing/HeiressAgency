  The progress of Catherine’s unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows.
It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about Catherine, while Catherine remained in the rooms, which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home.
This, on arriving in Pulteney Street, took the direction of extraordinary hunger, and when that was appeased, changed into an earnest longing to be in bed; such was the extreme point of Catherine distress; for when there Catherine immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours, and from which Catherine awoke perfectly revived, in excellent spirits, with fresh hopes and fresh schemes.
The first wish of Catherine heart was to improve Catherine acquaintance with Miss Tilney, and almost Catherine first resolution, to seek Catherine for that purpose, in the pump-room at noon.
In the pump-room, one so newly arrived in Bath must be met with, and that building Catherine had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence, and the completion of female intimacy, so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited confidence, that Catherine was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within the discovery of female excellence walls.
Catherine plan for the morning thus settled, Catherine sat quietly down to Catherine book after breakfast, resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one; and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen, whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such, that as Catherine never talked a great deal, so Catherine could never be entirely silent; and, therefore, while Catherine sat at Catherine work, if Catherine lost Catherine needle or broke Catherine thread, if Catherine heard a carriage in the street, or saw a speck upon Catherine gown, Catherine must observe a speck aloud, whether there were anyone at leisure to answer Catherine or not.
At about half past twelve, a remarkably loud rap drew Catherine in haste to the window, and scarcely had Catherine time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door, in the first only a servant, Catherine brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second, before John Thorpe came running upstairs, calling out, “Well, Miss Morland, here I am.
Have you been waiting long?
We could not come before; the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into, and now the old devil of a coachmaker is ten thousand to one but they break down before We are out of the street.
How do you do, Mrs. Allen?
A famous ball last night, was not it?
Come, Miss Morland, be quick, for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off.
the others want to get the others tumble over.”  “What do you mean?” said Catherine.
“Where are you all going to?”  “Going to?
Why, you have not forgot We engagement!
Did not We agree together to take a drive this morning?
What a head you have!
We are going up Claverton Down.”  “Something was said about it, I remember,” said Catherine, looking at Mrs. Allen for Mrs. Allen opinion; “but really I did not expect you.”  “Not expect me!
That’s a good one!
And what a dust you would have made, if I had not come.”  Catherine’s silent appeal to Catherine friend, meanwhile, was entirely thrown away, for Mrs. Allen, not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression Catherine by a look, was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else; and Catherine, whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive, and who thought there could be no impropriety in Catherine going with Mr. Thorpe, as Isabella was going at the same time with James, was therefore obliged to speak plainer.
“Well, ma’am, what do you say to it?
Can you spare me for an hour or two?
Shall I go?”  “Do just as you please, my dear,” replied Mrs. Allen, with the most placid indifference.
Catherine took the advice, and ran off to get ready.
In a very few minutes Catherine reappeared, having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in Catherine praise, after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen’s admiration of Thorpe gig; and then receiving Catherine friend’s parting good wishes, they both hurried downstairs.
“My dearest creature,” cried Isabella, to whom the duty of friendship immediately called Catherine before Catherine could get into the carriage, “you have been at least three hours getting ready.
I was afraid you were ill. What a delightful ball we had last night.
I have a thousand things to say to you; but make haste and get in, for I long to be off.”  Catherine followed Catherine orders and turned away, but not too soon to hear her friend’s exclaim aloud to James, “Catherine Catherine is!
I quite dote on Catherine.”  “You will not be frightened, Miss Morland,” said Thorpe, as Thorpe handed Catherine in, “if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off.
Thorpe will, most likely, give a plunge or two, and perhaps take the rest for a minute; but Thorpe will soon know Thorpe master.
Thorpe is full of spirits, playful as can be, but there is no vice in Thorpe.”  Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one, but it was too late to retreat, and Catherine was too young to own Catherine frightened; so, resigning Catherine to Catherine fate, and trusting to the animal’s boasted knowledge of ’s owner, Catherine sat peaceably down, and saw Thorpe sit down by Catherine.
Everything being then arranged, the servant who stood at the horse’s head was bid in an important voice “to let the servant who stood at the horse’s head go,” and off they went in the quietest manner imaginable, without a plunge or a caper, or anything like one.
Catherine, delighted at so happy an escape, spoke Catherine pleasure aloud with grateful surprise; and Catherine companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her companion that the matter was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins, and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed he whip.
Catherine, though Catherine could not help wondering that with such perfect command of he horse, he should think it necessary to alarm Catherine with a relation of it tricks, congratulated Catherine sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman; and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner, without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity, and (considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour) by no means alarmingly fast, gave Catherine up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind, in a fine mild day of February, with the consciousness of safety.
A silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue; it was broken by Thorpe’s saying very abruptly, “Old Allen is as rich as a Jew--is not “Old Allen?” Catherine did not understand “Old Allen--and “Old Allen repeated “Old Allen question, adding in explanation, “Old Allen, the man you are with.”  “Oh!
“Old Allen, the man you are.
Yes, I believe, “Old Allen is very rich.”  “And no children at all?”  “No--not any.”  “A famous thing for his next heirs.
his is your godfather, is not his?”  “your godfather!
No.”  “But you are always very much with his next heirs.”  “Yes, very much.”  “Aye, that is what I meant.
“Aye seems a good kind of old fellow enough, and has lived very well in “Aye time, I dare say; “Aye is not gouty for nothing.
Does “Aye drink “Aye bottle a day now?”  “his bottle!
No.
Why should you think of such a thing?
“Aye is a very temperate man, and you could not fancy “Aye in liquor last night?”  “Lord help you!
You women are always thinking of men’s being in liquor.
Why, you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle?
I am sure of this--that if everybody was to drink everybody a day, there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now.
It would be a famous good thing for us all.”  “I cannot believe it.”  “Oh!
Lord, it would be the saving of thousands.
There is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be.
Our foggy climate wants help.”  “And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford.”  OxfordOxford!
There is no drinking at Oxford now, I assure you.
Nobody drinks there.
You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost four pints at the utmost.
Now, for instance, it was reckoned a remarkable thing, at the last party in my rooms, that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head.
It was looked upon as something out of the common way.
Mine is famous good stuff, to be sure.
You would not often meet with anything like it in Oxford--and that may account for it.
But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there.”  “Yes, this does give a notion,” said Catherine warmly, “and that is, that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did.
However, I am sure James does not drink so much.”  This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply, of which no part was very distinct, except the frequent exclamations, amounting almost to oaths, which adorned This declaration, and Catherine was left, when This declaration ended, with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford, and the same happy conviction of Catherine brother’s comparative sobriety.
Thorpe’s ideas then all reverted to the merits of Thorpe’s own equipage, and Catherine was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which Thorpe’s horse moved along, and the ease which Thorpe’s paces, as well as the excellence of the springs, gave the motion of the carriage.
Catherine followed Thorpe’s in all Thorpe’s admiration as well as Catherine could.
To go before or beyond Thorpe’s was impossible.
Thorpe’s knowledge and Catherine ignorance of the subject, Thorpe’s rapidity of expression, and Catherine diffidence of Catherine put that out of Catherine power; Catherine could strike out nothing new in commendation, but Catherine readily echoed whatever Thorpe’s chose to assert, and it was finally settled between them without any difficulty that Thorpe’s equipage was altogether the most complete of his equipage kind in England, Thorpe’s carriage the neatest, Thorpe’s horse the best goer, and Thorpe’s the best coachman.
“You do not really think, John Thorpe,” said Catherine, venturing after some time to consider the matter as entirely decided, and to offer some little variation on the subject, “that Thorpe’s gig will break down?”  “Break down!
Oh!
Lord!
Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life?
There is not a sound piece of iron about it.
The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least--and as for the body!
Upon my soul, you might shake The wheels to pieces yourself with a touch.
It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld!
Thank God!
we have got a better.
I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds.”  “Good heavens!” cried Catherine, quite frightened.
“Then pray let we turn back; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on.
Do let we turn back, John Thorpe; stop and speak to my brother, and tell my brother how very unsafe it is.”  “Unsafe!
Oh, Lord!
What is there in that?
They will only get a roll if it does break down; and there is plenty of dirt; it will be excellent falling.
Oh, curse it!
The carriage is safe enough, if a man knows how to drive The carriage; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after The carriage is fairly worn out.
Lord bless you!
I would undertake for five pounds to drive five pounds to York and back again, without losing a nail.”  Catherine listened with astonishment; Catherine knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing; for Catherine had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle, nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead.
Catherine own family were plain, matter-of-fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind; Catherine father, at the utmost, being contented with a pun, and Catherine mother with a proverb; Her own family were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase Her own family importance, or of asserting at one moment what Her own family would contradict the next.
Catherine reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity, and was more than once on the point of requesting from John Thorpe a clearer insight into John Thorpe real opinion on the subject; but Catherine checked Catherine, because it appeared to Catherine that John Thorpe did not excel in giving those clearer insights, in making those things plain which John Thorpe had before made ambiguous; and, joining to this, the consideration that John Thorpe would not really suffer John Thorpe sister and John Thorpe friend to be exposed to a danger from which John Thorpe might easily preserve his sister and his friend, Catherine concluded at last that John Thorpe must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe, and therefore would alarm Catherine no longer.
By John Thorpe the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten; and all the rest of John Thorpe conversation, or rather talk, began and ended with John Thorpe and John Thorpe own concerns.
John Thorpe told Catherine of horses which John Thorpe had bought for a trifle and sold for incredible sums; of racing matches, in which John Thorpe judgment had infallibly foretold the winner; of shooting parties, in which John Thorpe had killed more birds (though without having one good shot) than all John Thorpe companions together; and described to Catherine some famous day’s sport, with the fox-hounds, in which John Thorpe foresight and skill in directing the dogs had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman, and in which the boldness of John Thorpe riding, though it had never endangered John Thorpe own life for a moment, had been constantly leading others into difficulties, which John Thorpe calmly concluded had broken the necks of many.
Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for Catherine, and unfixed as were Catherine general notions of what men ought to be, Catherine could not entirely repress a doubt, while Catherine bore with the effusions of John Thorpe endless conceit, of John Thorpe being altogether completely agreeable.
It was a bold surmise, for John Thorpe was Isabella’s brother; and Catherine had been assured by James that James manners would recommend James to all Catherine sex; but in spite of this, the extreme weariness of James company, which crept over Catherine before they had been out an hour, and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again, induced Catherine, in some small degree, to resist such high authority, and to distrust James powers of giving universal pleasure.
When they arrived at Mrs. Allen’s door, the astonishment of Isabella was hardly to be expressed, on finding that the astonishment of Isabella was too late in the day for they to attend Isabella friend into the house: “Past three o’clock!” It was inconceivable, incredible, impossible!
And Isabella would neither believe Isabella own watch, nor Isabella brother’s, nor the servant’s; Isabella would believe no assurance of the servant’s founded on reason or reality, till Morland produced his watch, and ascertained the fact; to have doubted a moment longer then would have been equally inconceivable, incredible, and impossible; and Isabella could only protest, over and over again, that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before, as Catherine was called on to confirm; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella; but the latter was spared the misery of Isabella friend’s dissenting voice, by not waiting for Isabella answer.
Isabella own feelings entirely engrossed Isabella; Isabella wretchedness was most acute on finding Isabella obliged to go directly home.
her wretchedness was ages since Isabella had had a moment’s conversation with Isabella ; and, though Isabella had such thousands of things to say to Isabella, it appeared as if they were never to be together again; so, with smiles of most exquisite misery, and the laughing eye of utter despondency, Isabella bade Isabella friend adieu and went on.
Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning, and was immediately greeted with, “Well, my dear, here you are,” a truth which Catherine had no greater inclination than power to dispute; “and I hope you have had a pleasant airing?”  “Yes, ma’am, I thank you; we could not have had a nicer day.”  “So John Thorpe said; John Thorpe was vastly pleased at your all going.”  “You have seen John Thorpe, then?”  “Yes, I went to the pump-room as soon as you were gone, and there I met John Thorpe, and we had a great deal of talk together.
John Thorpe says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning, it is so uncommonly scarce.”  “Did you see anybody else of we acquaintance?”  “Yes; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent, and there we met Mrs. Hughes, and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with Mrs. Hughes.”  “Did you indeed?
And did they speak to Mrs. Hughes?”  “Yes, we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour.
they seem very agreeable people.
Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin, and I fancy, by what I can learn, that Miss Tilney always dresses very handsomely.
Mrs. Hughes talked to Mrs. Hughes a great deal about the family.”  “And what did Miss Tilney tell you of the family?”  “Oh!
A vast deal indeed; Miss Tilney hardly talked of anything else.”  “Did Miss Tilney tell you what part of Gloucestershire the family come from?”  “Yes, Miss Tilney did; but I cannot recollect now.
But the family are very good kind of people, and very rich.
Miss Tilney was a Miss Drummond, and Miss Tilney and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows; and Miss Drummond had a very large fortune; and, when Miss Drummond married, Miss Drummond father gave Miss Drummond twenty thousand pounds, and five hundred to buy wedding-clothes.
Mrs. Hughes saw wedding-clothes after wedding-clothes came from the warehouse.”  “And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath?”  “Yes, I fancy Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath are, but I am not quite certain.
Upon recollection, however, I have a notion Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath are both dead; at least the mother is; yes, I am sure Miss Tilney is dead, because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Miss Drummond gave Miss Drummond daughter on his daughter wedding-day and that Miss Tilney Miss Tilney has got now, for they were put by for his daughter when his daughter died.”  “And is Mr. Tilney, my partner, the only son?”  “I cannot be quite positive about that, my dear; I have some idea he is; but, however, he is a very fine young man, Mrs. Hughes says, and likely to do very well.”  Catherine inquired no further; Catherine had heard enough to feel that Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give, and that Catherine was most particularly unfortunate Catherine in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister.
Could Catherine have foreseen such a circumstance, nothing should have persuaded Catherine to go out with the others; and, as it was, Catherine could only lament Catherine ill luck, and think over what Catherine had lost, till it was clear to Catherine that the drive had by no means been very pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable.
