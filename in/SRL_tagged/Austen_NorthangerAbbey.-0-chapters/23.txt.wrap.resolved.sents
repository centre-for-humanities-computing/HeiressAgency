  The housemaid’s folding back her window-shutters at eight o’clock the next day was the sound which first roused Catherine; and Catherine opened Catherine eyes, wondering that they could ever have been closed, on objects of cheerfulness; Catherine fire was already burning, and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night.
Instantaneously, with the consciousness of existence, returned Catherine recollection of the manuscript; and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid’s going away, Catherine eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground, and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on Catherine pillow.
Catherine now plainly saw that Catherine must not expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what Catherine had shuddered over in books, for the roll, seeming to consist entirely of small disjointed sheets, was altogether but of trifling size, and much less than Catherine had supposed it to be at first.
Catherine greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page.
Catherine started at a page import.
Could it be possible, or did not Catherine senses play Catherine false?
An inventory of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was before Catherine!
If the evidence of sight might be trusted, Catherine held a washing-bill in Catherine hand.
Catherine seized another sheet, and saw the same articles with little variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothing new.
Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced Catherine in each.
Two others, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball.
And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its first cramp line, “To poultice chestnut mare”--a farrier’s bill!
Such was the collection of papers (left perhaps, as Catherine could then suppose, by the negligence of a servant in the place whence Catherine had taken them) which had filled Catherine with expectation and alarm, and robbed Catherine of half Catherine night’s rest!
Catherine felt humbled to the dust.
Could not the adventure of the chest have taught Catherine wisdom?
A corner of it, catching Catherine eye as Catherine lay, seemed to rise up in judgment against Catherine.
Nothing could now be clearer than the absurdity of Catherine recent fancies.
To suppose that a manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in a room such as that, so modern, so habitable!--Or that Catherine should be the first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet, the key of which was open to all!
How could Catherine have so imposed on Catherine?
Heaven forbid that Henry Tilney should ever know Catherine folly!
And it was in a great measure Henry Tilney own doing, for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with Henry Tilney description of Catherine adventures, Catherine should never have felt the smallest curiosity about it.
This was the only comfort that occurred.
Impatient to get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly, those detestable papers then scattered over the bed, Catherine rose directly, and folding those detestable papers up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before, returned those detestable papers to the same spot within the cabinet, with a very hearty wish that no untoward accident might ever bring those detestable papers forward again, to disgrace Catherine even with Catherine.
Why the locks should have been so difficult to open, however, was still something remarkable, for Catherine could now manage those detestable papers with perfect ease.
In this there was surely something mysterious, and Catherine indulged in the flattering suggestion for half a minute, till the possibility of the door’s having been at first unlocked, and of being Catherine the door fastener, darted into Catherine head, and cost Catherine another blush.
Catherine got away as soon as Catherine could from a room in which Catherine conduct produced such unpleasant reflections, and found Catherine way with all speed to the breakfast-parlour, as it had been pointed out to Catherine by Miss Tilney the evening before.
Henry was alone in it; and Henry immediate hope of Catherine having been undisturbed by the tempest, with an arch reference to the character of the building they inhabited, was rather distressing.
For the world would Catherine not have Catherine weakness suspected, and yet, unequal to an absolute falsehood, was constrained to acknowledge that the wind had kept Catherine awake a little.
“But we have a charming morning after it,” Catherine added, desiring to get rid of the subject; “and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when storms and sleeplessness are over.
What beautiful hyacinths!
I have just learnt to love a hyacinth.”  “And how might you learn?
By accident or argument?”  “Your sister taught me; I cannot tell how.
Mrs. Allen used to take pains, year after year, to make me like them; but I never could, till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street; I am naturally indifferent about flowers.”  “But now you love a hyacinth.
So much the better.
You have gained a new source of enjoyment, and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible.
Besides, a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex, as a means of getting you out of doors, and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take.
And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic, who can tell, the sentiment once raised, but you may in time come to love a rose?”  “But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors.
The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me, and in fine weather I am out more than half my time.
Mamma says I am never within.”  “At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth.
The mere habit of learning to love is the thing; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing.
Has Catherine a pleasant mode of instruction?”  Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the general, whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind, but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance Catherine composure.
The elegance of the breakfast set forced The elegance of the breakfast set on Catherine’s notice when they were seated at table; and, luckily, The elegance of the breakfast set had been the general’s choice.
He was enchanted by Catherine approbation of He taste, confessed it to be neat and simple, thought it right to encourage the manufacture of He country; and for He part, to He uncritical palate, the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire, as from that of Dresden or Save.
But this was quite an old set, purchased two years ago.
the manufacture of his country was much improved since that time; He had seen some beautiful specimens when last in town, and had He not been perfectly without vanity of that kind, might have been tempted to order a new set.
He trusted, however, that an opportunity might ere long occur of selecting one--though not for He.
Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand He.
Shortly after breakfast Henry left the party who did not understand him for Woodston, where business required and would keep Henry two or three days.
They all attended in the hall to see Henry mount Henry horse, and immediately on re-entering the breakfast-room, Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of Henry figure.
“This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother’s fortitude,” observed the general to Eleanor.
“Woodston will make but a sombre appearance today.”  “Is it a pretty place?” asked Catherine.
“What say you, Eleanor?
Speak your opinion, for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men.
I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations.
The house stands among fine meadows facing the south-east, with an excellent kitchen-garden in the same aspect; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago, for the benefit of my son.
It is a family living, Miss Morland; and the property in the place being chiefly my own, you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one.
Did Henry’s income depend solely on this living, Henry would not be ill-provided for.
Perhaps it may seem odd, that with only two younger children, I should think any profession necessary for Henry; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish Henry disengaged from every tie of business.
But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies, I am sure your father, Miss Morland, would agree with myself in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment.
The money is nothing, The money is not an object, but employment is the thing.
Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county, has Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county profession.”  The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county wishes.
The silence of a young lady proved it to be unanswerable.
Something had been said the evening before of a young lady being shown over the house, and Something now offered Something as a young lady conductor; and though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by Something daughter, it was a proposal of too much happiness in it, under any circumstances, not to be gladly accepted; for a young lady had been already eighteen hours in the abbey, and had seen only a few of it rooms.
The netting-box, just leisurely drawn forth, was closed with joyful haste, and a young lady was ready to attend Something in a moment.
“And when they had gone over the house, Something promised Something moreover the pleasure of accompanying a young lady into the shrubberies and garden.” a young lady curtsied a young lady acquiescence.
“But perhaps it might be more agreeable to a young lady to make those a young lady first object.
The weather was at present favourable, and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of the uncertainty continuing so.
Which would a young lady prefer?
Something was equally at a young lady service.
Which did his daughter think would most accord with a young lady fair friend’s wishes?
But Something thought Something could discern.
Yes, Something certainly read in Miss Morland’s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather.
But when did a young lady judge amiss?
the abbey would be always safe and dry.
Something yielded implicitly, and would fetch Something hat and attend the abbey in a moment.” Something left the room, and Catherine, with a disappointed, anxious face, began to speak of a young lady unwillingness that Something should be taking them out of doors against Something own inclination, under a mistaken idea of pleasing a young lady; but a young lady was stopped by Miss Henry Tilney’s saying, with a little confusion, “I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on my fatherMiss Tilney’s account; my father always walks out at this time of day.”  Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood.
Why was Miss Tilney embarrassed?
Could there be any unwillingness on the general’s side to show Miss Tilney over the abbey?
The proposal was Henry Tilney own.
And was not The proposal odd that Henry Tilney should always take Henry Tilney walk so early?
Neither Miss Tilney father nor Mrs. Allen did so.
It was certainly very provoking.
Miss Tilney was all impatience to see the house, and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds.
If Henry had been with them indeed!
But now Miss Tilney should not know what was picturesque when Miss Tilney saw it.
Such were Miss Tilney thoughts, but Miss Tilney kept them to Miss Tilney, and put on Miss Tilney bonnet in patient discontent.
Miss Tilney was struck, however, beyond Miss Tilney expectation, by the grandeur of the abbey, as Miss Tilney saw it for the first time from the lawn.
The whole building enclosed a large court; and two sides of the quadrangle, rich in Gothic ornaments, stood forward for admiration.
The remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees, or luxuriant plantations, and the steep woody hills rising behind, to give The remainder shelter, were beautiful even in the leafless month of March.
Catherine had seen nothing to compare with The remainder; and Catherine feelings of delight were so strong, that without waiting for any better authority, Catherine boldly burst forth in wonder and praise.
the general listened with assenting gratitude; and it seemed as if the general own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour.
The kitchen-garden was to be next admired, and the general led the way to The kitchen-garden across a small portion of the park.
The number of acres contained in The kitchen-garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay, being more than double the extent of all Mr. Allen’s, such as Catherine as Catherine father’s, including church-yard and orchard.
The walls seemed countless in number, endless in length; a village of hot-houses seemed to arise among a village of hot-houses, and a whole parish to be at work within the enclosure.
the general was flattered by the general looks of surprise, which told the general almost as plainly, as the general soon forced the general to tell the general in words, that the general had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before; and the general then modestly owned that, “without any ambition of that sort himself--without any solicitude about it--the general did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom.
If the general had a hobby-horse, it was that.
the general loved a garden.
Though careless enough in most matters of eating, the general loved good fruit--or if the general did not, the general friends and children did.
There were great vexations, however, attending such a garden as the general.
The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits.
The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year.
Mrs. Allen, Mrs. Allen supposed, must feel these inconveniences as well as Mrs. Allen.”  “No, not at all.
Mrs. Allen did not care about a garden, and never went into a garden.”  With a triumphant smile of self-satisfaction, the general wished the general could do the same, for the general never entered the general, without being vexed in some way or other, by its falling short of the general plan.
“How were Mrs. Allen succession-houses worked?” describing the nature of Mrs. Allen own as Mr. Allen’s succession-houses entered Mr. Allen’s succession-houses.
“Mrs.
Allen had only one small hot-house, which Mrs. Allen had the use of for Mrs. Allen plants in winter, and there was a fire in it now and then.”  “Mrs.
Allen is a happy man!” said the general, with a look of very happy contempt.
Having taken Mrs. Allen into every division, and led Mrs. Allen under every wall, till Mrs. Allen was heartily weary of seeing and wondering, Mrs. Allen suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door, and then expressing Mrs. Allen wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea-house, proposed the tea-house as no unpleasant extension of the girls walk, if Miss Morland were not tired.
“But where are you going, Eleanor?
Why do you choose that cold, damp path to it?
Miss Morland Morland will get wet.
Our best way is across the park.”  “This is so favourite a walk of mine,” said Miss Tilney, “that I always think it the best and nearest way.
But perhaps it may be damp.”  it was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs; and Catherine, struck by its gloomy aspect, and eager to enter its, could not, even by the general’s disapprobation, be kept from stepping forward.
even by the general’s disapprobation perceived her inclination, and having again urged the plea of health in vain, was too polite to make further opposition.
even by the general’s disapprobation excused even by the general’s disapprobation, however, from attending them: “The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for even by the general’s disapprobation, and even by the general’s disapprobation would meet them by another course.” even by the general’s disapprobation turned away; and Catherine was shocked to find how much Catherine spirits were relieved by the separation.
The shock, however, being less real than the relief, offered The shock no injury; and Catherine began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired.
“I am particularly fond of this spot,” said Catherine companion, with a sigh.
“It was my mother’s favourite walk.”  Catherine had never heard Miss Tilney mentioned in the family before, and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed this tender remembrance directly in Catherine altered countenance, and in the attentive pause with which Catherine waited for something more.
“I used to walk here so often with Catherine!” added Eleanor; “though I never loved it then, as I have loved it since.
At that time indeed I used to wonder at Catherine choice.
But Catherine memory endears her memory now.”  “And ought her memory not,” reflected Catherine, “to endear her memory to Catherine husband?
Yet the general would not enter her memory.” Miss Tilney continuing silent, Catherine ventured to say, “Catherine death must have been a great affliction!”  “A great and increasing one,” replied the other, in a low voice.
“I was only thirteen when it happened; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it, I did not, I could not, then know what a loss it was.” Catherine stopped for a moment, and then added, with great firmness, “I have no sister, you know--and though Henry--though my brothers are very affectionate, and Henry is a great deal here, which I am most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to be often solitary.”  “To be sure you must miss the general very much.”  “A mother would have been always present.
A mother would have been a constant friend; A mother influence would have been beyond all other.”  “Was A mother a very charming woman?
Was A mother handsome?
Was there any picture of A mother in the abbey?
And why had A mother been so partial to that grove?
Was it from dejection of spirits?”--were questions now eagerly poured forth; the first three received a ready affirmative, the two others were passed by; and Catherine’s interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with every question, whether answered or not.
Of A mother unhappiness in marriage, A mother felt persuaded.
The general certainly had been an unkind husband.
an unkind husband did not love A mother walk: could an unkind husband therefore have loved A mother?
And besides, handsome as an unkind husband was, there was a something in the turn of an unkind husband features which spoke an unkind husband not having behaved well to A mother.
“A mother picture, I suppose,” blushing at the consummate art of A mother own question, “hangs in your father’s room?”  “No; it was intended for the drawing-room; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting, and for some time it had no place.
Soon after A mother I obtained Soon after her death for my own, and hung Soon after her death in my bed-chamber--where I shall be happy to show Soon after her death you; Soon after her death is very like.”  Here was another proof.
A portrait--very like--of a departed wife, not valued by an unkind husband!
an unkind husband must have been dreadfully cruel to A mother!
Catherine attempted no longer to hide from Catherine the nature of the feelings which, in spite of all an unkind husband attentions, an unkind husband had previously excited; and what had been terror and dislike before, was now absolute aversion.
Yes, aversion!
an unkind husband cruelty to such a charming woman made an unkind husband odious to His cruelty to such a charming woman.
His cruelty to such a charming woman had often read of such characters, characters which Mrs. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn; but here was proof positive of the contrary.
His cruelty to such a charming woman had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them directly upon the general; and in spite of all His cruelty to such a charming woman virtuous indignation, His cruelty to such a charming woman found His cruelty to such a charming woman again obliged to walk with an unkind husband, listen to an unkind husband, and even to smile when an unkind husband smiled.
Being no longer able, however, to receive pleasure from the surrounding objects, His cruelty to such a charming woman soon began to walk with lassitude; the general perceived it, and with a concern for His cruelty to such a charming woman health, which seemed to reproach His cruelty to such a charming woman for His cruelty to such a charming woman opinion of the general, was most urgent for returning with the general daughter to the house.
the general would follow them in a quarter of an hour.
Again them parted--but Eleanor was called back in half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking Eleanor friend round the abbey till the general return.
This second instance of the general anxiety to delay what His cruelty to such a charming woman so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable.
