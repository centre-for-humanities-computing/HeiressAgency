  From this time, the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people; and Catherine found, with some surprise, that Catherine two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella’s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of Catherine marrying their brother. their persuasion that the general would, upon this ground alone, independent of the objection that might be raised against Catherine character, oppose the connection, turned Catherine feelings moreover with some alarm towards Catherine. Catherine was as insignificant, and perhaps as portionless, as Isabella; and if the heir of the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in the heir of the Tilney property, at what point of interest were the demands of the heir of the Tilney property younger brother to rest? The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality, which, as Catherine was given to understand by the heir of the Tilney property words as well as the heir of the Tilney property actions, Catherine had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money, which Catherine had more than once heard the heir of the Tilney property utter, and which tempted Catherine to think the heir of the Tilney property disposition in such matters misunderstood by the heir of the Tilney property children.  his children were so fully convinced, however, that his children would not have the courage to apply in person for his younger brother father’s consent, and so repeatedly assured Catherine that his younger brother had never in his younger brother life been less likely to come to Northanger than at the present time, that Catherine suffered Catherine mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of Catherine own. But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney, whenever Captain Tilney made Captain Tilney application, would give Captain Tilney any just idea of Isabella’s conduct, it occurred to Isabella as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before Henry as the whole business really was, enabling the general by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion, and prepare Henry objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations. Isabella proposed it to Henry accordingly; but Henry did not catch at the measure so eagerly as Isabella had expected. “No,” said Henry, “my father’s hands need not be strengthened, and Frederick’s confession of folly need not be forestalled. Frederick must tell Frederick own story.”  “But Frederick will tell only half of his own story.”  “A quarter would be enough.”  A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney. Captain Tilney brother and sister knew not what to think. Sometimes it appeared to His brother and sister as if Captain Tilney silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement, and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it. The general, meanwhile, though offended every morning by Frederick’s remissness in writing, was free from any real anxiety about Frederick’s, and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland’s time at Northanger pass pleasantly. Frederick’s often expressed Frederick’s uneasiness on this head, feared the sameness of every dayFrederick’s society and employments would disgust employments with the place, wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country, talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner, and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood. But then it was such a dead time of year, no wild-fowl, no game, and the Lady Frasers were not in the country. And it all ended, at last, in Frederick’s telling Henry one morning that when Henry next went to Woodston, they would take Henry by surprise there some day or other, and eat they mutton with Henry. Henry was greatly honoured and very happy, and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme. “And when do you think, sir, I may look forward to this pleasure? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting, and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days.”  “Well, well, we will take we chance some one of those days. There is no need to fix. You are not to put yourself at all out of your way. Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough. I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor’s table. Let me see; Monday will be a busy day with you, we will not come on Monday; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me. I expect my surveyor from Brockham with my surveyor from Brockham report in the morning; and afterwards I cannot in decency fail attending the club. I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the country, it would be taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me, Miss Morland, never to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it. They are a set of very worthy men. They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year; and I dine with They whenever I can. Tuesday, therefore, we may say is out of the question. But on Wednesday, I think, Henry, you may expect we; and we shall be with Henry early, that we may have time to look about we. Two hours and three quarters will carry we to Woodston, I suppose; we shall be in the carriage by ten; so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday, you may look for we.”  A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion, so strong was Catherine desire to be acquainted with Woodston; and Catherine heart was still bounding with joy when Henry, about an hour afterwards, came booted and greatcoated into the room where Catherine and Eleanor were sitting, and said, “I am come, young ladies, in a very moralizing strain, to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for, and that our often purchase young ladies at a great disadvantage, giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on the future, that may not be honoured. Witness myself, at this present hour. Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday, which bad weather, or twenty other causes, may prevent, I must go away directly, two days before I intended it.”  “Go away!” said Catherine, with a very long face. “And why?”  “Why! How can you ask the question? Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of my old housekeeper wits, because I must go and prepare a dinner for you, to be sure.”  “Oh! Not seriously!”  “Aye, and sadly too--for I had much rather stay.”  “But how can you think of such a thing, after what the general said? When the general so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble, because anything would do.”  Henry only smiled. “I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister’s account and mine. You must know it to be so; and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary: besides, if the general had not said half so much as the general did, the general has always such an excellent dinner at home, that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify.”  “I wish I could reason like yourself, for the general sake and my own. Good-bye. As tomorrow is Sunday, Eleanor, I shall not return.”  the general went; and, it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine to doubt Catherine own judgment than Henry’s, Catherine was very soon obliged to give the general credit for being right, however disagreeable to Catherine the general going. But the inexplicability of the general’s conduct dwelt much on Catherine thoughts. That the general was very particular in the general eating, Catherine had, by Catherine own unassisted observation, already discovered; but why the general should say one thing so positively, and mean another all the while, was most unaccountable! How were people, at that rate, to be understood? Who but Henry could have been aware of what Henry father was at?  From Saturday to Wednesday, however, they were now to be without Henry. This was the sad finale of every reflection: and Captain Tilney’s letter would certainly come in Tilney absence; and Wednesday Catherine was very sure would be wet. The past, present, and future were all equally in gloom. Catherine brother so unhappy, and Catherine loss in Isabella so great; and Eleanor’s spirits always affected by Henry’s absence! What was there to interest or amuse Catherine? Catherine was tired of the woods and the shrubberies--always so smooth and so dry; and the abbey in itself was no more to Catherine now than any other house. The painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a consideration of the building. What a revolution in Catherine ideas! Catherine, who had so longed to be in an abbey! Now, there was nothing so charming to Catherine imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well-connected parsonage, something like Fullerton, but better: Fullerton had Fullerton faults, but Woodston probably had none. If Wednesday should ever come!  It did come, and exactly when It might be reasonably looked for. It came--It was fine--and Catherine trod on air. By ten o’clock, the chaise and four conveyed the trio from the abbey in itself; and, after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles, the chaise and four entered Woodston, a large and populous village, in a situation not unpleasant. Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty Catherine thought it, as the general seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country, and the size of the village; but in Catherine heart Catherine preferred it to any place Catherine had ever been at, and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage, and at all the little chandler’s shops which the chaise and four passed. At the further end of the village, and tolerably disengaged from the rest of it, stood the parsonage, a new-built substantial stone house, with it semicircular sweep and green gates; and, as they drove up to the door, Henry, with the friends of Henry solitude, a large Newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers, was ready to receive and make much of two or three terriers.  Catherine’s mind was too full, as Catherine entered the house, for Catherine either to observe or to say a great deal; and, till called on by the general for Catherine opinion of it, Catherine had very little idea of the room in which Catherine was sitting. Upon looking round it then, Catherine perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world; but Catherine was too guarded to say so, and the coldness of Catherine praise disappointed Henry.  “We are not calling it a good house,” said Henry. “We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger--We are considering it as a mere parsonage, small and confined, We allow, but decent, perhaps, and habitable; and altogether not inferior to the generality; or, in other words, I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good. it may admit of improvement, however. Far be it from me to say otherwise; and anything in reason--a bow thrown out, perhaps--though, between We, if there is one thing more than another my aversion, it is a patched-on bow.”  Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by this speech; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry, at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by Henry servant, the general was shortly restored to Henry complacency, and Catherine to all Catherine usual ease of spirits.  The room in question was of a commodious, well-proportioned size, and handsomely fitted up as a dining-parlour; and on their quitting The room in question to walk round the grounds, Catherine was shown, first into a smaller apartment, belonging peculiarly to the master of the house, and made unusually tidy on the occasion; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing-room, with the appearance of which, though unfurnished, Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general. It was a prettily shaped room, the windows reaching to the ground, and the view from them pleasant, though only over green meadows; and Catherine expressed Catherine admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which Catherine felt it. “Oh! Why do not you fit up The room in question, Mr. Tilney? What a pity not to have it fitted up! It is the prettiest room I ever saw; It is the prettiest room in the world!”  “I trust,” said the general, with a most satisfied smile, “that the general will very speedily be furnished: the general waits only for a lady’s taste!”  “Well, if it was the house, I should never sit anywhere else. Oh! What a sweet little cottage there is among the trees--apple trees, too! It is What a sweet little cottage!”  “You like It--you approve It as an object--It is enough. Henry, remember that Robinson is spoken to about it. What a sweet little cottage remains.”  Such a compliment recalled all Catherine’s consciousness, and silenced Catherine directly; and, though pointedly applied to by the general for Catherine choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings, nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from Catherine. The influence of fresh objects and fresh air, however, was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations; and, having reached the ornamental part of the premises, consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow, on which Henry’s genius had begun to act about half a year ago, Catherine was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure-ground Catherine had ever been in before, though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner.  A saunter into other meadows, and through part of the village, with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements, and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about, brought a litter of puppies just able to roll to four o’clock, when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three. At four a litter of puppies just able to roll were to dine, and at six to set off on a litter of puppies just able to roll return. Never had any day passed so quickly!  Catherine could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the general; nay, that he was even looking at the side-table for cold meat which was not there. he son and daughter’s observations were of a different kind. His son and daughter’s observations had seldom seen he eat so heartily at any table but he own, and never before known he so little disconcerted by the melted butter’s being oiled.  At six o’clock, the general having taken he coffee, the carriage again received His son and daughter’s observations; and so gratifying had been the tenor of he conduct throughout the whole visit, so well assured was Catherine mind on the subject of he expectations, that, could Catherine have felt equally confident of the wishes of he son, Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When Catherine might return to it.
