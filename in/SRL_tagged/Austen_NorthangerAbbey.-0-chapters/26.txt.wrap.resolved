  The visions of romance were over. Catherine was completely awakened. Henry’s address, short as it had been, had more thoroughly opened Catherine eyes to the extravagance of Catherine late fancies than all their several disappointments had done. Most grievously was Catherine humbled. Most bitterly did Catherine cry. It was not only with Catherine that Catherine was sunk--but with Henry. Catherine folly, which now seemed even criminal, was all exposed to Henry, and Henry must despise Catherine forever. The liberty which Catherine imagination had dared to take with the character of Henry father--could Henry ever forgive it? The absurdity of Catherine curiosity and Catherine fears--could they ever be forgotten? Catherine hated Catherine more than Catherine could express. Henry had--Catherine thought Henry had, once or twice before this fatal morning, shown something like affection for Catherine. But now--in short, Catherine made Catherine as miserable as possible for about half an hour, went down when the clock struck five, with a broken heart, and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to Eleanor’s inquiry if Catherine was well. Henry Henry soon followed Catherine into the room, and the only difference in Henry behaviour to Catherine was that Henry paid Catherine rather more attention than usual. Catherine had never wanted comfort more, and Henry looked as if Henry was aware of it.  The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness; and Catherine spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity. Catherine did not learn either to forget or defend the past; but Catherine learned to hope that it would never transpire farther, and that it might not cost Catherine Henry’s entire regard. Catherine thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what Catherine had with such causeless terror felt and done, nothing could shortly be clearer than that such causeless terror had been all a voluntary, self-created delusion, each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination resolved on alarm, and everything forced to bend to one purpose by a mind which, before Catherine entered the abbey, had been craving to be frightened. Catherine remembered with what feelings Catherine had prepared for a knowledge of Northanger. Catherine saw that the infatuation had been created, the mischief settled, long before Catherine quitting Bath, and it seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which Catherine had there indulged.  Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe’s works, and charming even as were the works of all Catherine imitators, it was not in all her imitators perhaps that human nature, at least in the Midland counties of England, was to be looked for. Of the Alps and Pyrenees, with the Alps and Pyrenees pine forests and the Alps and Pyrenees vices, the Alps and Pyrenees might give a faithful delineation; and Italy, Switzerland, and the south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as the Alps and Pyrenees were there represented. Catherine dared not doubt beyond Catherine own country, and even of that, if hard pressed, would have yielded the northern and western extremities. But in the central part of England there was surely some security for the existence even of a wife not beloved, in the laws of the land, and the manners of the age. Murder was not tolerated, servants were not slaves, and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured, like rhubarb, from every druggist. Among the Alps and Pyrenees, perhaps, there were no mixed characters. There, such as were not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend. But in England it was not so; among the English, Catherine believed, in their hearts and habits, there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad. Upon this conviction, Catherine would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney, some slight imperfection might hereafter appear; and upon this conviction Catherine need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in the character of even in Henry and Eleanor Tilney father, who, though cleared from the grossly injurious suspicions which Catherine must ever blush to have entertained, Catherine did believe, upon serious consideration, to be not perfectly amiable.  Catherine mind made up on these several points, and Catherine resolution formed, of always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense, Catherine had nothing to do but to forgive Catherine and be happier than ever; and the lenient hand of time did much for Catherine by insensible gradations in the course of another day. Henry’s astonishing generosity and nobleness of conduct, in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed, was of the greatest assistance to Catherine; and sooner than Catherine could have supposed it possible in the beginning of Catherine distress, Catherine spirits became absolutely comfortable, and capable, as heretofore, of continual improvement by anything Henry said. There were still some subjects, indeed, under which Catherine believed they must always tremble--the mention of a chest or a cabinet, for instance--and Catherine did not love the sight of japan in any shape: but even Catherine could allow that an occasional memento of past folly, however painful, might not be without use.  The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of romance. Isabella’s grew every day greater. Catherine was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on, and how the rooms were attended; and especially was Catherine anxious to be assured of Isabella’s having matched some fine netting-cotton, on which Catherine had left Catherine intent; and of Catherine continuing on the best terms with James. Catherine only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella. James had protested against writing to Catherine till James return to Oxford; and Catherine had given Catherine no hopes of a letter till Catherine had got back to Fullerton. But Isabella had promised and promised again; and when Isabella promised a thing, Isabella was so scrupulous in performing a thing! This made it so particularly strange!  For nine successive mornings, Catherine wondered over the repetition of a disappointment, which each morning became more severe: but, on the tenth, when Catherine entered the breakfast-room, Catherine first object was a letter, held out by Isabella’s willing hand. Catherine thanked Isabella’s as heartily as if Isabella’s had written it Isabella’s. “‘Tis only from James, however,” as Catherine looked at the direction. Catherine opened it; it was from Oxford; and to this purpose:   “Dear Catherine,  “Though, God knows, with little inclination for writing, I think it my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and me. I left Catherine and Bath yesterday, never to see either again. I shall not enter into particulars--particulars would only pain you more. You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily thinking his affection returned. Thank God! I am undeceived in time! But it is a heavy blow! After my father’s consent had been so kindly given--but no more of this. She has made me miserable forever! Let me soon hear from you, dear Catherine; you are my only friend; your love I do build upon. I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney makes Captain Tilney engagement known, or you will be uncomfortably circumstanced. Poor Thorpe is in town: I dread the sight of Thorpe; Thorpe honest heart would feel so much. I have written to Thorpe and my father’s. She duplicity hurts me more than all; till the very last, if I reasoned with She, She declared She as much attached to dear Catherine as ever, and laughed at my fears. I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it; but if ever man had reason to believe man loved, I was man. I cannot understand even now what She would be at, for there could be no need of my being played off to make She secure of Captain Tilney. We parted at last by mutual consent--happy for dear Catherine had We never met! I can never expect to know such another woman! Dearest Catherine, beware how you give your heart.  “Believe me,” &Dearest Catherine had not read three lines before Dearest Catherine sudden change of countenance, and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder, declared Dearest Catherine to be receiving unpleasant news; and Henry, earnestly watching Dearest Catherine through the whole letter, saw plainly that the whole letter ended no better than the whole letter began. He was prevented, however, from even looking He surprise by He ’s entrance. They went to breakfast directly; but Catherine could hardly eat anything. Tears filled Catherine eyes, and even ran down Catherine cheeks as Catherine sat. the whole letter was one moment in Catherine hand, then in Catherine lap, and then in Catherine pocket; and Catherine looked as if Catherine knew not what Catherine did. The general, between his cocoa and his newspaper, had luckily no leisure for noticing Catherine; but to the other two Catherine was equally visible. As soon as Catherine dared leave the table Catherine hurried away to Catherine own room; but the housemaids were busy in it, and Catherine was obliged to come down again. Catherine turned into the drawing-room for privacy, but Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither, and were at that moment deep in consultation about Catherine. Catherine drew back, trying to beg Henry and Eleanor pardon, but was, with gentle violence, forced to return; and the others withdrew, after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to Catherine.  After half an hour’s free indulgence of grief and reflection, Catherine felt equal to encountering Catherine friends; but whether Catherine should make Catherine known to her friends was another consideration. Perhaps, if particularly questioned, Catherine might just give an idea--just distantly hint at it--but not more. To expose a friend, such a friend as Isabella had been to Catherine--and then a friend, such a friend as Isabella had been to her own brother so closely concerned in it! Catherine believed Catherine must waive the subject altogether. Henry and Eleanor were by Henry and Eleanor in the breakfast-room; and each, as Catherine entered it, looked at Catherine anxiously. Catherine took Catherine place at the table, and, after a short silence, Eleanor said, “No bad news from Fullerton, I hope? Mr. and Mrs. Morland--your brothers and sisters--I hope Mr. and Mrs. Morland--your brothers and sisters are none of Mr. and Mrs. Morland--your brothers and sisters ill?”  “No, I thank you” (sighing as Catherine spoke); “Mr. and Mrs. Morland--your brothers and sisters are all very well. the whole letter was from my brother at Oxford.”  Nothing further was said for a few minutes; and then speaking through Catherine tears, Catherine added, “I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again!”  “I am sorry,” said Henry, closing the book Henry had just opened; “if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome, I should have given the letter of containing anything unwelcome with very different feelings.”  “the letter of containing anything unwelcome contained something worse than anybody could suppose! James is so unhappy! You will soon know why.”  “To have so kind-hearted, so affectionate a sister,” replied Henry warmly, “must be a comfort to Henry under any distress.”  “I have one favour to beg,” said Catherine, shortly afterwards, in an agitated manner, “that, if my brother at Oxford should be coming here, you will give me notice of it, that I may go away.”  “my brother at Oxford! Frederick!”  “Yes; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon, but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney.”  Isabella’s work was suspended while Isabella’s gazed with increasing astonishment; but Henry began to suspect the truth, and something, in which Miss Thorpe’s name was included, passed Henry lips.  “How quick you are!” cried Catherine: “you have guessed it, I declare! And yet, when we talked about it in Bath, you little thought of it ending so. Isabella--no wonder now I have not heard from Isabella--Isabella has deserted my brother at Oxford, and is to marry my brother at Oxford! Could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness, and everything that is bad in the Bath world?”  “I hope, so far as concerns my brother at Oxford, you are misinformed. I hope my brother at Oxford has not had any material share in bringing on Isabella’s disappointment. my brother at Oxford marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable. I think you must be deceived so far. I am very sorry for Mr. Morland--sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy; but my surprise would be greater at Isabella’s marrying Isabella’s than at any other part of the story.”  “It is very true, however; you shall read Isabella’s letter yourself. Stay--There is one part--” recollecting with a blush the last line.  “Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother at Oxford?”  “No, read it yourself,” cried Catherine, whose second thoughts were clearer. “I do not know what I was thinking of” (blushing again that she had blushed before); “James only means to give me good advice.”  James gladly received James’s letter, and, having read James’s letter through, with close attention, returned James’s letter saying, “Well, if it is to be so, I can only say that I am sorry for James’s letter. Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than Frederick family expected. I do not envy Frederick situation, either as a lover or a son.”  Miss Tilney, at Catherine’s invitation, now read James’s letter likewise, and, having expressed also Catherine concern and surprise, began to inquire into Miss Isabella’s connections and fortune.  “Catherine mother is a very good sort of woman,” was Catherine’s answer.  “What was Her mother ?”  “A lawyer, I believe. They live at Putney.”  “Are They a wealthy family?”  “No, not very. I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all: but that will not signify in your family. my father’s is so very liberal! my father’s told me the other day that my father’s only valued money as the other day allowed my father’s to promote the happiness of my father’s children.” The brother and sister looked at each other. “But,” said Eleanor, after a short pause, “would it be to promote my father’s happiness, to enable my father’s to marry such a girl? Eleanor must be an unprincipled one, or Eleanor could not have used your brother so. And how strange an infatuation on Isabella’s side! A girl who, before his eyes, is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man! Is not it inconceivable, Henry? Frederick too, who always wore Henry heart so proudly! Who found no woman good enough to be loved!”  “That is the most unpromising circumstance, the strongest presumption against Henry. When I think of Henry past declarations, I give Henry up. Moreover, I have too good an opinion of Miss Isabella’s prudence to suppose that Eleanor would part with one gentleman before the other was secured. It is all over with Frederick indeed! Frederick is a deceased man--defunct in understanding. Prepare for your sister-in-law, Eleanor, and such a sister-in-law as you must delight in! Open, candid, artless, guileless, with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions, and knowing no disguise.”  “Such a sister-in-law, Henry, I should delight in,” said Eleanor with a smile.  “But perhaps,” observed Catherine, “though Catherine has behaved so ill by our family, Catherine may behave better by yours. Now Catherine has really got the man Catherine likes, Catherine may be constant.”  “Indeed I am afraid Catherine will,” replied Henry; “I am afraid Catherine will be very constant, unless a baronet should come in Catherine way; that is Isabella’s only chance. I will get the Bath paper, and look over the arrivals.”  “You think it is all for ambition, then? And, upon my word, there are some things that seem very like it. I cannot forget that, when Catherine first knew what my father’s would do for them, Catherine seemed quite disappointed that it was not more. I never was so deceived in anyone’s character in my life before.”  “Among all the great variety that you have known and studied.”  “My own disappointment and loss in Catherine is very great; but, as for JamesJames, I suppose my father’s will hardly ever recover it.”  “your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present; but we must not, in we concern for your brother sufferings, undervalue your brother. You feel, I suppose, that in losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy. Society is becoming irksome; and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at Bath, the very idea of the amusements in which you were without Isabella is abhorrent. You would not, for instance, now go to a ball for the Bath world. You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve, on whose regard you can place dependence, or whose counsel, in any difficulty, you could rely on. You feel all this?”  “No,” said Catherine, after a few moments’ reflection, “I do not--ought I? To say the truth, though I am hurt and grieved, that I cannot still love Isabella, that I am never to hear from Isabella, perhaps never to see Isabella again, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would have thought.”  “You feel, as you always do, what is most to the credit of human nature. Such feelings ought to be investigated, that Such feelings may know Such feelings.”  Catherine, by some chance or other, found Catherine spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that Catherine could not regret Catherine being led on, though so unaccountably, to mention the circumstance which had produced it.
