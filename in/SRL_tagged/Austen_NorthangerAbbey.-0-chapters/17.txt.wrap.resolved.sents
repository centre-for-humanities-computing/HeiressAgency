  Catherine’s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable; and accordingly, though her was most politely received by General Tilney, and kindly welcomed by General Tilney daughter, though Henry was at home, and no one else of the party, her found, on her return, without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings, that her had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded.
Instead of finding her improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourse of the day, her seemed hardly so intimate with her as before; instead of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of a family party, Henry Tilney had never said so little, nor been so little agreeable; and, in spite of their father’s great civilities to her--in spite of Henry Tilney thanks, invitations, and compliments--it had been a release to get away from Henry Tilney.
it puzzled her to account for all this.
it could not be General Tilney’s fault.
That he was perfectly agreeable and good-natured, and altogether a very charming man, did not admit of a doubt, for he was tall and handsome, and Henry’s father.
he could not be accountable for he children’s want of spirits, or for her want of enjoyment in he company.
The former her hoped at last might have been accidental, and the latter her could only attribute to her own stupidity.
her, on hearing the particulars of the visit, gave a different explanation: “It was all pride, pride, insufferable haughtiness and pride!
her had long suspected the family to be very high, and this made it certain.
Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney’s her had never heard of in her life!
Not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding!
To behave to her guest with such superciliousness!
Hardly even to speak to her!”  “But it was not so bad as that, her; there was no superciliousness; her was very civil.”  “Oh!
Don’t defend her!
And then the brother, he, who had appeared so attached to her!
Good heavens!
Well, some people’s feelings are incomprehensible.
And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day?”  “I do not say so; but he did not seem in good spirits.”  “How contemptible!
Of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion.
Let me entreat you never to think of he again, my dear Catherine; indeed he is unworthy of my dear Catherine.”  “Unworthy!
I do not suppose he ever thinks of my dear Catherine.”  “That is exactly what I say; he never thinks of my dear Catherine.
Such fickleness!
Oh!
How different to your brother and to mine!
I really believe John has the most constant heart.”  “But as for General Tilney, I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to my dear Catherine with greater civility and attention; it seemed to be he only care to entertain and make me happy.”  “Oh!
I know no harm of John; I do not suspect John of pride.
I believe John is a very gentleman-like man.
John thinks very well of John, and John’s judgment--”  “Well, I shall see how they behave to John this evening; we shall meet they at the rooms.”  “And must I go?”  “Do not you intend it?
I thought it was all settled.”  “Nay, since you make such a point of it, I can refuse you nothing.
But do not insist upon my being very agreeable, for my heart, you know, will be some forty miles off.
And as for dancing, do not mention it, I beg; that is quite out of the question.
Charles Hodges will plague me to death, I dare say; but I shall cut Charles Hodges very short.
Ten to one but Charles Hodges guesses the reason, and that is exactly what I want to avoid, so I shall insist on Charles Hodges keeping Charles Hodges conjecture to Charles Hodges.”  Isabella’s opinion of the Tilneys did not influence Isabella friend; Isabella was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister; and Isabella did not credit there being any pride in brother or sister hearts.
The evening rewarded Isabella confidence; Isabella was met by one with the same kindness, and by the other with the same attention, as heretofore: Miss Tilney took pains to be near Miss Tilney, and Henry asked Miss Tilney to dance.
Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother, Captain Tilney, was expected almost every hour, Miss Tilney was at no loss for the name of a very fashionable-looking, handsome young man, whom Miss Tilney had never seen before, and who now evidently belonged to a very fashionable-looking, handsome young man, whom she had never seen before party.
Miss Tilney looked at him with great admiration, and even supposed it possible that some people might think him handsomer than him brother, though, in Miss Tilney eyes, him air was more assuming, and him countenance less prepossessing.
him taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior; for, within Miss Tilney hearing, him not only protested against every thought of dancing him, but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it possible.
From the latter circumstance it may be presumed that, whatever might be our heroine’s opinion of Henry, Henry admiration of Miss Tilney was not of a very dangerous kind; not likely to produce animosities between the brothers, nor persecutions to Miss Tilney.
Henry cannot be the instigator of the three villains in horsemen’s greatcoats, by whom Miss Tilney will hereafter be forced into a traveling-chaise and four, which will drive off with incredible speed.
Catherine, meanwhile, undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil, or of any evil at all, except that of having but a short set to dance down, enjoyed Miss Tilney usual happiness with Henry Tilney, listening with sparkling eyes to everything Henry Tilney said; and, in finding Henry Tilney irresistible, becoming so Miss Tilney.
At the end of the first dance, Henry Tilney came towards them again, and, much to Catherine’s dissatisfaction, pulled Henry Tilney brother away.
them retired whispering together; and, though Catherine delicate sensibility did not take immediate alarm, and lay it down as fact, that Henry Tilney must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of Catherine, which Henry Tilney now hastened to communicate to his brother, in the hope of separating them forever, Catherine could not have Catherine partner conveyed from Catherine sight without very uneasy sensations.
Catherine suspense was of full five minutes’ duration; and Catherine was beginning to think Her suspense a very long quarter of an hour, when they both returned, and an explanation was given, by Henry’s requesting to know if Catherine thought Catherine friend, Miss Thorpe, would have any objection to dancing, as Henry’s would be most happy to be introduced to Catherine.
Catherine, without hesitation, replied that Catherine was very sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all.
The cruel reply was passed on to the other, and his brother immediately walked away.
“his brother will not mind it, I know,” said Catherine, “because I heard his brother say before that his brother hated dancing; but it was very good-natured in his brother to think of it.
I suppose his brother saw Isabella sitting down, and fancied Isabella might wish for a partner; but his brother is quite mistaken, for Isabella would not dance upon any account in the world.”  Henry smiled, and said, “How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people’s actions.”  “Why?
What do you mean?”  “With you, it is not, How is such a one likely to be influenced, What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person’s feelings, age, situation, and probable habits of life considered--but, How should I be influenced, What would be my inducement in acting so and so?”  “I do not understand you.”  “Then we are on very unequal terms, for I understand you perfectly well.”  “Me?
Yes; I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.”  “Bravo!
An excellent satire on modern language.”  “But pray tell me what you mean.”  “Shall I indeed?
Do you really desire it?
But you are not aware of the consequences; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment, and certainly bring on a disagreement between we.”  “No, no; it shall not do either; I am not afraid.”  “Well, then, I only meant that your attributing my brother’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world.”  Catherine blushed and disclaimed, and the gentleman’s predictions were verified.
There was a something, however, in his words which repaid Catherine for the pain of confusion; and that something occupied Catherine mind so much that Catherine drew back for some time, forgetting to speak or to listen, and almost forgetting where Catherine was; till, roused by the voice of Isabella, Catherine looked up and saw Catherine with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across.
Isabella shrugged Isabella shoulders and smiled, the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given; but as it was not quite enough for Catherine’s comprehension, Isabella spoke Isabella astonishment in very plain terms to Isabella partner.
“I cannot think how it could happen!
Isabella was so determined not to dance.”  “And did Isabella never change Isabella mind before?”  “Oh!
But, because--And your brother!
After what you told --And your brother from me, how could --And your brother think of going to ask Isabella?”  “I cannot take surprise to me on that head.
You bid me be surprised on your friend’s account, and therefore I am; but as for his brother, his brother conduct in the business, I must own, has been no more than I believed his brother perfectly equal to.
The fairness of your friend’s was an open attraction; your friend’s firmness, you know, could only be understood by yourself.”  “You are laughing; but, I assure you, Isabella is very firm in general.”  “It is as much as should be said of anyone.
To be always firm must be to be often obstinate.
When properly to relax is the trial of judgment; and, without reference to his brother, I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour.”  The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over; but then, as The friends walked about the room arm in arm, Isabella thus explained Isabella: “I do not wonder at your surprise; and I am really fatigued to death.
death is such a rattle!
Amusing enough, if my mind had been disengaged; but I would have given the world to sit still.”  “Then why did not you?”  “Oh!
My dear!
It would have looked so particular; and you know how I abhor doing that.
I refused death as long as I possibly could, but death would take no denial.
You have no idea how death pressed me.
I begged death to excuse me, and get some other partner--but no, not death; after aspiring to my hand, there was nobody else in the room death could bear to think of; and it was not that death wanted merely to dance, death wanted to be with me.
Oh!
Such nonsense!
I told death death had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me; for, of all things in the world, I hated fine speeches and compliments; and so--and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not stand up.
Besides, I thought Mrs. Hughes, who introduced death, might take it ill if I did not: and your dear brother, I am sure death would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening.
I am so glad it is over!
My spirits are quite jaded with listening to death nonsense: and then, being such a smart young fellow, I saw every eye was upon us.”  “death is very handsome indeed.”  “Handsome!
Yes, I suppose death may.
I dare say people would admire death in general; but death is not at all in my style of beauty.
I hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man.
However, death is very well.
Amazingly conceited, I am sure.
I took death down several times, you know, in my way.”  When the young ladies next met, the young ladies had a far more interesting subject to discuss.
James Morland’s second letter was then received, and the kind intentions of his father fully explained.
A living, of which James Morland was James Morland patron and incumbent, of about four hundred pounds yearly value, was to be resigned to James Morland son as soon as his son should be old enough to take it; no trifling deduction from the family income, no niggardly assignment to one of ten children.
An estate of at least equal value, moreover, was assured as An estate of at least equal value future inheritance.
James expressed James on the occasion with becoming gratitude; and the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could marry, being, however unwelcome, no more than James had expected, was borne by James without discontent.
Catherine, whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her income, and whose judgment was now entirely led by her , felt equally well satisfied, and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled.
“It is very charming indeed,” said Isabella, with a grave face.
“James Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed,” said the gentle Mrs. Thorpe, looking anxiously at the gentle Mrs. Thorpe daughter.
“I only wish I could do as much.
One could not expect more from James Morland, you know.
If James Morland finds James Morland can do more by and by, I dare say James Morland will, for I am sure James Morland must be an excellent good-hearted man.
Four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed, but your wishes, my dear Isabella, are so moderate, you do not consider how little you ever want, my dear.”  “It is not on my own account I wish for more; but I cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland, making James Morland sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life.
For myself, it is nothing; I never think of myself.”  “I know you never do, my dear; and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for myself.
There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you; and I dare say when James Morland sees you, my dear child--but do not let us distress us by talking of such things.
James Morland has behaved so very handsome, you know.
I always heard James Morland was a most excellent man; and you know, my dear, us are not to suppose but what, if you had had a suitable fortune, James Morland would have come down with something more, for I am sure James Morland must be a most liberal-minded man.”  “Nobody can think better of James Morland than I do, I am sure.
But everybody has their failing, you know, and everybody has a right to do what their like with their own money.” Catherine was hurt by these insinuations.
“I am very sure,” said Catherine, “that his father has promised to do as much as his father can afford.”  Isabella recollected Isabella.
“As to that, CatherineCatherine, there cannot be a doubt, and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me.
It is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits; I hate money; and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year, I should not have a wish unsatisfied.
Ah!
Catherine, you have found me out.
There’s the sting.
The long, long, endless two years and half that are to pass before his brother can hold the living.”  “Yes, yes, Isabella,” said Mrs. Thorpe, ““ perfectly see into your heart.
You have no disguise.
“ perfectly understand the present vexation; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection.”  There’s the sting uncomfortable feelings began to lessen.
There’s the sting endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella’s regret; and when There’s the sting saw There’s the sting at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever, endeavoured to forget that There’s the sting had for a minute thought otherwise.
James soon followed James letter, and was received with the most gratifying kindness.
