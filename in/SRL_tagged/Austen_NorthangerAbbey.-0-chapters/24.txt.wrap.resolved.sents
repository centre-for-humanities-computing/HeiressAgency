  An hour passed away before the general came in, spent, on the part of the general young guest, in no very favourable consideration of the general character.
“This lengthened absence, these solitary rambles, did not speak a mind at ease, or a conscience void of reproach.” At length the general appeared; and, whatever might have been the gloom of the general meditations, the general could still smile with them.
Miss Tilney, understanding in part Catherine friend’s curiosity to see the house, soon revived the subject; and Catherine father being, contrary to Catherine’s expectations, unprovided with any pretence for further delay, beyond that of stopping five minutes to order refreshments to be in the room by their return, was at last ready to escort their.
their set forward; and, with a grandeur of air, a dignified step, which caught the eye, but could not shake the doubts of the well-read Catherine, the general led the way across the hall, through the common drawing-room and one useless antechamber, into a room magnificent both in size and furniture--the real drawing-room, used only with company of consequence.
It was very noble--very grand--very charming!--was all that Catherine had to say, for Catherine indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned the colour of the satin; and all minuteness of praise, all praise that had much meaning, was supplied by the general: the costliness or elegance of any room’s fitting-up could be nothing to Catherine; Catherine cared for no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century.
When the general had satisfied the general own curiosity, in a close examination of every well-known ornament, the costliness or elegance of any room’s fitting-up proceeded into the library, an apartment, in its way, of equal magnificence, exhibiting a collection of books, on which an humble man might have looked with pride.
Catherine heard, admired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than before--gathered all that Catherine could from this storehouse of knowledge, by running over the titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed.
But suites of apartments did not spring up with Catherine wishes.
Large as was the building, Catherine had already visited the greatest part; though, on being told that, with the addition of the kitchen, the six or seven rooms Catherine had now seen surrounded three sides of the court, Catherine could scarcely believe the court, or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted.
It was some relief, however, that some relief were to return to the rooms in common use, by passing through a few of less importance, looking into the court, which, with occasional passages, not wholly unintricate, connected the different sides; and Catherine was further soothed in Catherine progress by being told that Catherine was treading what had once been a cloister, having traces of cells pointed out, and observing several doors that were neither opened nor explained to Catherine--by finding Catherine successively in a billiard-room, and in the general’s private apartment, without comprehending some relief connection, or being able to turn aright when Catherine left some relief; and lastly, by passing through a dark little room, owning Henry’s authority, and strewed with Henry litter of books, guns, and greatcoats.
From the dining-room, of which, though already seen, and always to be seen at five o’clock, the general could not forgo the pleasure of pacing out the length, for the more certain information of Miss Morland, as to what Catherine neither doubted nor cared for, what she neither doubted nor cared proceeded by quick communication to the kitchen--the ancient kitchen of the convent, rich in the massy walls and smoke of former days, and in the stoves and hot closets of the present.
The general’s improving hand had not loitered here: every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had been adopted within this, the cooks spacious theatre; and, when the genius of others had failed, the genius of others own had often produced the perfection wanted.
the genius of others endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed the genius of others high among the benefactors of the convent.
With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey; the fourth side of the quadrangle having, on account of the quadrangle having decaying state, been removed by the general’s father, and the present erected in the quadrangle having place.
All that was venerable ceased here.
The new building was not only new, but declared The new building to be so; intended only for offices, and enclosed behind by stable-yards, no uniformity of architecture had been thought necessary.
Catherine could have raved at the hand which had swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest, for the purposes of mere domestic economy; and would willingly have been spared the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen, had the genius of others allowed the genius of others; but if the genius of others had a vanity, it was in the arrangement of the genius of others offices; and as the genius of others was convinced that, to a mind like Miss Morland’s, a view of the accommodations and comforts, by which the labours of Catherine inferiors were softened, must always be gratifying, the genius of others should make no apology for leading Catherine on.
They took a slight survey of all; and Catherine was impressed, beyond Catherine expectation, by They multiplicity and They convenience.
The purposes for which a few shapeless pantries and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at Fullerton, were here carried on in appropriate divisions, commodious and roomy.
The number of servants continually appearing did not strike The number of servants continually appearing less than the number of The number of servants continually appearing offices.
Wherever The number of servants continually appearing went, some pattened girl stopped to curtsy, or some footman in dishabille sneaked off.
Yet this was an abbey!
How inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements from such as The number of servants continually appearing had read about--from abbeys and castles, in which, though certainly larger than Northanger, all the dirty work of the house was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost.
How they could get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen; and, when Catherine saw what was necessary here, Catherine began to be amazed Catherine.
they returned to the hall, that the chief staircase might be ascended, and the beauty of the chief staircase wood, and ornaments of rich carving might be pointed out: having gained the top, they turned in an opposite direction from the gallery in which Catherine room lay, and shortly entered one on the same plan, but superior in length and breadth.
Catherine was here shown successively into three large bed-chambers, with three large bed-chambers dressing-rooms, most completely and handsomely fitted up; everything that money and taste could do, to give comfort and elegance to apartments, had been bestowed on these; and, being furnished within the last five years, three large bed-chambers were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing, and wanting in all that could give pleasure to Catherine.
As three large bed-chambers were surveying the last, the general, after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters by whom three large bed-chambers had at times been honoured, turned with a smiling countenance to Catherine, and ventured to hope that henceforward some of three large bed-chambers earliest tenants might be “our friends from Fullerton.” Catherine felt the unexpected compliment, and deeply regretted the impossibility of thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards Catherine, and so full of civility to all Catherine family.
The gallery was terminated by folding doors, which Miss Tilney, advancing, had thrown open, and passed through, and seemed on the point of doing the same by the first door to the left, in another long reach of gallery, when the general, coming forwards, called Catherine hastily, and, as Catherine thought, rather angrily back, demanding whether Catherine were going?--And what was there more to be seen?--Had not Miss Morland already seen all that could be worth Catherine notice?--And did Catherine not suppose Catherine friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much exercise?
Miss Tilney drew back directly, and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine, who, having seen, in a momentary glance beyond them, a narrower passage, more numerous openings, and symptoms of a winding staircase, believed Catherine at last within the reach of something worth Catherine notice; and felt, as Catherine unwillingly paced back The gallery, that Catherine would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest.
The general’s evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional stimulant.
Something was certainly to be concealed; Catherine fancy, though it had trespassed lately once or twice, could not mislead Catherine here; and what that something was, a short sentence of Miss Miss Tilney’s, as they followed the general at some distance downstairs, seemed to point out: “I was going to take you into what was my mother’s room--the room in which Catherine died--” were all Catherine words; but few as they were, they conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine.
It was no wonder that the general should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room must contain; a room in all probability never entered by the general since the dreadful scene had passed, which released the general suffering wife, and left the general to the stings of conscience.
Catherine ventured, when next alone with Eleanor, to express Catherine wish of being permitted to see it, as well as all the rest of that side of the house; and Eleanor promised to attend Catherine there, whenever they should have a convenient hour.
Catherine understood Catherine: the genius of others must be watched from home, before that room could be entered.
“It remains as it was, I suppose?” said Catherine, in a tone of feeling.
“Yes, entirely.”  “And how long ago may it be that your mother died?”  “Catherine has been dead these nine years.” And nine years, Catherine knew, was a trifle of time, compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife, before Catherine room was put to rights.
“You were with Catherine, I suppose, to the last?”  “No,” said Miss Tilney, sighing; “I was unfortunately from home.
Catherine illness was sudden and short; and, before I arrived it was all over.”  Catherine’s blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words.
Could it be possible?
Could Henry’s father--?
And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions!
And, when Catherine saw Henry in the evening, while Catherine worked with Catherine friend, slowly pacing the drawing-room for an hour together in silent thoughtfulness, with downcast eyes and contracted brow, Catherine felt secure from all possibility of wronging Henry.
It was the air and attitude of a Montoni!
What could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity, in a mind fearful review of past scenes of guilt?
Unhappy man!
And the anxiousness of Catherine spirits directed Catherine eyes towards his figure so repeatedly, as to catch Miss Miss Tilney’s notice.
“the general’s father,” Catherine whispered, “often walks about the room in this way; it is nothing unusual.”  “So much the worse!” thought Catherine; such ill-timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks, and boded nothing good.
After an evening, the little variety and seeming length of which made Catherine peculiarly sensible of Henry’s importance among them, Catherine was heartily glad to be dismissed; though it was a look from the general not designed for Catherine observation which sent his daughter to the bell.
When the butler would have lit his master’s candle, however, his was forbidden.
The latter was not going to retire.
“I have many pamphlets to finish,” said his to Catherine, “before I can close my eyes, and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep.
Can either of us be more meetly employed?
my eyes will be blinding for the good of others, and yours preparing by rest for future mischief.”  But neither the business alleged, nor the magnificent compliment, could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose.
To be kept up for hours, after the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely.
There must be some deeper cause: something was to be done which could be done only while the household slept; and the probability that Miss Tilney yet lived, shut up for causes unknown, and receiving from the pitiless hands of Miss Tilney husband a nightly supply of coarse food, was the conclusion which necessarily followed.
Shocking as was the idea, it was at least better than a death unfairly hastened, as, in the natural course of things, Miss Tilney must ere long be released.
The suddenness of Miss Tilney reputed illness, the absence of Miss Tilney daughter, and probably of Miss Tilney other children, at the time--all favoured the supposition of Miss Tilney imprisonment.
Its origin--jealousy perhaps, or wanton cruelty--was yet to be unravelled.
In revolving these matters, while Miss Tilney undressed, Its suddenly struck Miss Tilney as not unlikely that Miss Tilney might that morning have passed near the very spot of this unfortunate woman’s confinement--might have been within a few paces of the cell in which Miss Tilney languished out Miss Tilney days; for what part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which yet bore the traces of monastic division?
In the high-arched passage, paved with stone, which already Miss Tilney had trodden with peculiar awe, Miss Tilney well remembered the doors of which the genius of others had given no account.
To what might not the doors of which the general had given no account lead?
In support of the plausibility of this conjecture, it further occurred to Miss Tilney that the forbidden gallery, in which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney, must be, as certainly as Miss Tilney memory could guide Miss Tilney, exactly over this suspected range of cells, and the staircase by the side of those apartments of which Miss Tilney had caught a transient glimpse, communicating by some secret means with those cells, might well have favoured the barbarous proceedings of her husband.
Down the chief staircase Miss Tilney had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well-prepared insensibility!
Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of Miss Tilney own surmises, and sometimes hoped or feared that Catherine had gone too far; but they were supported by such appearances as made they dismissal impossible.
The side of the quadrangle, in which Catherine supposed the guilty scene to be acting, being, according to Catherine belief, just opposite Catherine own, The side of the quadrangle, in which she supposed the guilty scene to be acting, being, according to her belief, just opposite her own struck Catherine that, if judiciously watched, some rays of light from the general’s lamp might glimmer through the lower windows, as he passed to the prison of he wife; and, twice before Catherine stepped into bed, Catherine stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in The gallery, to see if it appeared; but all abroad was dark, and it must yet be too early.
The various ascending noises convinced Catherine that the servants must still be up.
Till midnight, Catherine supposed it would be in vain to watch; but then, when the clock had struck twelve, and all was quiet, Catherine would, if not quite appalled by darkness, steal out and look once more.
the clock struck twelve--and Catherine had been half an hour asleep.
