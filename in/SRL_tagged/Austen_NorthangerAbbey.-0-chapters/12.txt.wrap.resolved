more than seven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more to go. It will never do. we set out a great deal too late. we had much better put a great deal off till another day, and turn round.”  “It is all one to me,” replied Thorpe rather angrily; and instantly turning Thorpe horse, they were on they way back to Bath.  “If your brother had not got such a d--beast to drive,” said your brother soon afterwards, “we might have done it very well. his horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour, if left to your brother, and I have almost broke my arm with pulling your brother in to that cursed broken-winded jade’s pace. Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of Morland own.”  “No, Morland is not,” said Catherine warmly, “for I am sure Morland could not afford it.”  “And why cannot Morland afford it?”  “Because Morland has not money enough.”  “And whose fault is that?”  “Nobody’s, that I know of.” Thorpe then said something in the loud, incoherent way to which Thorpe had often recourse, about its being a d--thing to be miserly; and that if people who rolled in money could not afford things, Thorpe did not know who could, which Catherine did not even endeavour to understand. Disappointed of what was to have been the consolation for Catherine first disappointment, Catherine was less and less disposed either to be agreeable Catherine or to find Catherine companion so; and they returned to Pulteney Street without Catherine speaking twenty words.  As Catherine entered the house, the footman told Catherine that a gentleman and lady had called and inquired for Catherine a few minutes after Catherine setting off; that, when the footman told a gentleman and lady Catherine was gone out with Thorpe, lady had asked whether any message had been left for lady; and on the footman saying no, had felt for a card, but said lady had none about lady, and went away. Pondering over these heart-rending tidings, Catherine walked slowly upstairs. At the head of a gentleman and lady Catherine was met by Mr. Allen, who, on hearing the reason of a gentleman and lady speedy return, said, “I am glad your brother had so much sense; I am glad you are come back. It was a strange, wild scheme.”  They all spent the evening together at Thorpe’s. Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce, in the fate of which Isabella shared, by private partnership with Morland, a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton. Isabella satisfaction, too, in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more than once. “How I pity the poor creatures that are going there! How glad I am that I am not amongst the poor creatures that are going there! I wonder whether it will be a full ball or not! the poor creatures that are going there have not begun dancing yet. I would not be there for all the world. It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball. I know the Mitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity everybody that is. But I dare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, do not you? I am sure you do. Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you. I dare say we could do very well without you; but you men think yourselves of such consequence.”  Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in tenderness towards Catherine and Catherine sorrows, so very little did they appear to dwell on Catherine mind, and so very inadequate was the comfort Catherine offered. “Do not be so dull, my dearest creature,” Catherine whispered. “You will quite break my heart. It was amazingly shocking, to be sure; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame. Why were not the Tilneys more punctual? It was dirty, indeed, but what did that signify? I am sure John and I should not have minded It. I never mind going through anything, where a friend is concerned; that is my disposition, and John is just the same; John has amazing strong feelings. Good heavens! What a delightful hand you have got! Kings, I vow! I never was so happy in my life! I would fifty times rather you should have fifty times than myself.”  And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch, which is the true heroine’s portion; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with tears. And lucky may Catherine think Catherine, if Catherine get another good night’s rest in the course of the next three months.
