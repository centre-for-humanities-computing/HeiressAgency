  With more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump-room the next day, secure within Catherine of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the morning were over, and ready to meet Mr. Tilney with a smile; but no smile was demanded--Mr. Mr. Tilney did not appear. Every creature in Bath, except Mr. Tilney, was to be seen in the pump-room at different periods of the fashionable hours; crowds of people were every moment passing in and out, up the steps and down; people whom nobody cared about, and nobody wanted to see; and Mr. Tilney only was absent. “What a delightful place Bath is,” said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock, after parading the pump-room till they were tired; “and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here.”  This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now; but we are told to “despair of nothing we would attain,” as “unwearied diligence we point would gain”; and the unwearied diligence with which Mrs. Allen had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have the same thing just reward, for hardly had Mrs. Allen been seated ten minutes before a lady of about Mrs. Allen own age, who was sitting by Mrs. Allen, and had been looking at Mrs. Allen attentively for several minutes, addressed Mrs. Allen with great complaisance in these words: “I think, madam, I cannot be mistaken; it is a long time since I had the pleasure of seeing you, but is not your name Allen?”  This question answered, as it readily was, the stranger pronounced Mrs. Allen to be Thorpe; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom Mrs. Allen had seen only once since a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages respective marriages, and that many years ago. a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages joy on this meeting was very great, as well this meeting might, since a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years. Compliments on good looks now passed; and, after observing how time had slipped away since a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages were last together, how little a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages had thought of meeting in Bath, and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend, a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages families, sisters, and cousins, talking a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages together, far more ready to give than to receive information, and each hearing very little of what the other said. Thorpe, however, had one great advantage as a talker, over Mrs. Allen, in a family of children; and when Mrs. Allen expatiated on the talents of Mrs. Allen sons, and the beauty of Mrs. Allen daughters, when Mrs. Allen related their different situations and views--that John was at Oxford, Edward at Merchant Taylors’, and William at sea--and all of their more beloved and respected in their different station than any other three beings ever were, Mrs. Allen had no similar information to give, no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of Mrs. Allen friend, and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions, consoling Mrs. Allen, however, with the discovery, which Mrs. Allen keen eye soon made, that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe’s pelisse was not half so handsome as that on Mrs. Allen own.  “Here come my dear girls,” cried Mrs. Thorpe, pointing at three smart-looking females who, arm in arm, were then moving towards Mrs. Thorpe. “Mrs. Allen, I long to introduce them; them will be so delighted to see you: the tallest is Isabella, my eldest; is not Mrs. Allen a fine young woman? The others are very much admired too, but I believe Mrs. Allen is the handsomest.”  The Miss Thorpes were introduced; and Miss Morland, who had been for a short time forgotten, was introduced likewise. The name seemed to strike them all; and, after speaking to Mrs. Allen with great civility, the eldest young lady observed aloud to the rest, “How excessively like the eldest young lady brother Miss Morland is!”  “The very picture of her brother Miss Morland indeed!” cried the mother--and “I should have known the eldest young lady anywhere for her brother Miss Morland sister!” was repeated by them all, two or three times over. For a moment Catherine was surprised; but Mrs. Thorpe and Catherine daughters had scarcely begun the history of Mrs. Thorpe and her daughters acquaintance with Mr. James Morland, before Catherine remembered that Catherine had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of her brother Miss Morland own college, of the name of Thorpe; and that her brother Miss Morland had spent the last week of the Christmas vacation with her brother Miss Morland family, near London.  The whole being explained, many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of many obliging things wish of being better acquainted with Catherine; of being considered as already friends, through the friendship of friends brothers, etc., which Catherine heard with pleasure, and answered with all the pretty expressions Catherine could command; and, as the first proof of amity, Catherine was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe, and take a turn with Catherine about the room. Catherine was delighted with this extension of Catherine Bath acquaintance, and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while Catherine talked to the eldest Miss Thorpe. Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.  Their conversation turned upon those subjects, of which the free discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies: such as dress, balls, flirtations, and quizzes. the eldest Miss Thorpe, however, being four years older than Miss Morland, and at least four years better informed, had a very decided advantage in discussing such points; Catherine could compare the balls of Bath with those of Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London; could rectify the opinions of Catherine new friend in many articles of tasteful attire; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only smiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd. These powers received due admiration from Catherine, to whom These powers were entirely new; and the respect which These powers naturally inspired might have been too great for familiarity, had not the easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe’s manners, and Catherine frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with Catherine, softened down every feeling of awe, and left nothing but tender affection. These powers increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room, but required, when they all quitted it together, that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen’s house; and that These powers should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands, after learning, to These powers mutual relief, that These powers should see each other across the theatre at night, and say These powers prayers in the same chapel the next morning. Catherine then ran directly upstairs, and watched Miss Thorpe’s progress down the street from the drawing-room window; admired the graceful spirit of Catherine walk, the fashionable air of Catherine figure and dress; and felt grateful, as well Catherine might, for the chance which had procured Catherine such a friend.  Miss Thorpe was a widow, and not a very rich one; Miss Thorpe was a good-humoured, well-meaning woman, and a very indulgent mother. Miss Thorpe eldest daughter had great personal beauty, and the younger ones, by pretending to be as handsome as the younger ones sister, imitating Her eldest daughter air, and dressing in the same style, did very well.  This brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity of a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself, of Mrs. Thorpe herself past adventures and sufferings, which might otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters; in which the worthlessness of lords and attorneys might be set forth, and conversations, which had passed twenty years before, be minutely repeated.
