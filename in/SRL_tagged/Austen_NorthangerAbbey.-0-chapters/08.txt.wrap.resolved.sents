  In spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker, however, the party from Pulteney Street reached the Upper Rooms in very good time.
The Thorpes and James Morland were there only two minutes before The Thorpes and James Morland; and Isabella having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting Isabella friend with the most smiling and affectionate haste, of admiring the set of Isabella gown, and envying the curl of Isabella hair, The Thorpes and James Morland followed The Thorpes and James Morland chaperones, arm in arm, into the ballroom, whispering to each other whenever a thought occurred, and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand or a smile of affection.
The dancing began within a few minutes after The Thorpes and James Morland were seated; and James, who had been engaged quite as long as his sister, was very importunate with Isabella to stand up; but John was gone into the card-room to speak to a friend, and nothing, a friend declared, should induce a friend to join the set before a friend dear Catherine could join the set too.
“I assure you,” said a friend, “I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening.” her dear Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude, and this kindness continued as this kindness were for three minutes longer, when Isabella, who had been talking to James on the other side of a friend, turned again to James and whispered, “My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you, your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will not mind my going away, and I dare say John will be back in a moment, and then you may easily find me out.” her dear Catherine, though a little disappointed, had too much good nature to make any opposition, and the others rising up, Isabella had only time to press Isabella friend’s hand and say, “Good-bye, my dear love,” before they hurried off.
The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing, her dear Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom her dear Catherine now remained.
her dear Catherine could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe, for her dear Catherine not only longed to be dancing, but was likewise aware that, as the real dignity of her dear Catherine situation could not be known, her dear Catherine was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner.
To be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance of infamy while her dear Catherine heart is all purity, her dear Catherine actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true source of her dear Catherine debasement, is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine’s life, and her dear Catherine fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her dear Catherine character.
her dear Catherine had fortitude too; her dear Catherine suffered, but no murmur passed her dear Catherine lips.
From this state of humiliation, her dear Catherine was roused, at the end of ten minutes, to a pleasanter feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr. Tilney, within three yards of the place where they sat; he seemed to be moving that way, but he did not see her dear Catherine, and therefore the smile and the blush, which he sudden reappearance raised in Catherine, passed away without sullying her dear Catherine heroic importance.
he looked as handsome and as lively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing-looking young woman, who leant on he arm, and whom her dear Catherine immediately guessed to be he sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering he lost to her dear Catherine forever, by being married already.
But guided only by what was simple and probable, it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; Mr. Tilney had not behaved, Mr. Tilney had not talked, like the married men to whom her had been used; Mr. Tilney had never mentioned a wife, and Mr. Tilney had acknowledged a sister.
From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of a sister now being by Mr. Tilney side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen’s bosom, her dear Catherine sat erect, in the perfect use of her dear Catherine senses, and with cheeks only a little redder than usual.
Mr. Tilney and his companion, who continued, though slowly, to approach, were immediately preceded by a lady, an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe; and her dear Catherine stopping to speak to her dear Catherine, Mr. Tilney and his companion, who continued, though slowly, to approach, as belonging to her dear Catherine, stopped likewise, and her dear Catherine, catching Mr. Tilney’s eye, instantly received from her dear Catherine the smiling tribute of recognition.
her dear Catherine returned the smiling tribute of recognition with pleasure, and then advancing still nearer, her dear Catherine spoke Mr. Tilney and his companion, who continued, though slowly, to approach to her dear Catherine and Mrs. Allen, by whom her dear Catherine was very civilly acknowledged.
“I am very happy to see you again, sir, indeed; I was afraid you had left Bath.” sir thanked her dear Catherine for her dear Catherine fears, and said that sir had quitted it for a week, on the very morning after sir having had the pleasure of seeing her dear Catherine.
“Well, sir, and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again, for it is just the place for young people--and indeed for everybody else too.
I tell Mr. Allen, when Mr. Allen talks of being sick of it, that I am sure Mr. Allen should not complain, for it is so very agreeable a place, that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year.
I tell Mr. Allen Mr. Allen is quite in luck to be sent here for Mr. Allen health.”  “And I hope, madam, that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place, from finding the place of service to Mr. Allen.”  “Thank you, sir.
I have no doubt that sir will.
A neighbour of ours, Dr. Skinner, was here for sir health last winter, and came away quite stout.”  “That circumstance must give great encouragement.”  “Yes, sir--and Dr. Skinner and sir family were here three months; so I tell Mr. Allen Mr. Allen must not be in a hurry to get away.”  Here Dr. Skinner and his family were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mr. Allen, that Mr. Allen would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney with seats, as Dr. Skinner and his family had agreed to join Dr. Skinner and his family party.
This was accordingly done, Miss Tilney still continuing standing before Dr. Skinner and his family; and after a few minutes’ consideration, Miss Tilney asked Catherine to dance with Miss Tilney.
This compliment, delightful as it was, produced severe mortification to the lady; and in giving the lady denial, the lady expressed the lady sorrow on the occasion so very much as if the lady really felt it that had Thorpe, who joined the lady just afterwards, been half a minute earlier, Miss Tilney might have thought the lady sufferings rather too acute.
The very easy manner in which Miss Tilney then told the lady that Miss Tilney had kept the lady waiting did not by any means reconcile the lady more to the lady lot; nor did the particulars which Miss Tilney entered into while they were standing up, of the horses and dogs of the friend whom Miss Tilney had just left, and of a proposed exchange of terriers between they, interest the lady so much as to prevent the lady looking very often towards that part of the room where the lady had left Mr. Tilney.
Of the lady dear Isabella, to whom the lady particularly longed to point out that gentleman, the lady could see nothing.
They were in different sets.
the lady was separated from all the lady party, and away from all the lady acquaintance; one mortification succeeded another, and from the whole the lady deduced this useful lesson, that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady.
From such a moralizing strain as this, the lady was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder, and turning round, perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind the lady, attended by Miss Tilney.
“I beg your pardon, Miss Morland,” said the lady, “for this liberty--but I cannot anyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Miss Thorpe said Miss Thorpe was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by Miss Thorpe.” Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige Mrs. Hughes than Catherine.
The young ladies were introduced to each other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness, Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with having so respectably settled Mrs. Hughes young charge, returned to Mrs. Hughes party.
Miss Tilney had a good figure, a pretty face, and a very agreeable countenance; and Miss Tilney air, though it had not all the decided pretension, the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe’s, had more real elegance.
Mrs. Hughes manners showed good sense and good breeding; they were neither shy nor affectedly open; and Mrs. Hughes seemed capable of being young, attractive, and at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near Mrs. Hughes, and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling occurrence.
Catherine, interested at once by Mrs. Hughes appearance and Mrs. Hughes relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous of being acquainted with Mrs. Hughes, and readily talked therefore whenever Mrs. Hughes could think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for saying it.
But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented the frequent want of one or more of these requisites doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance, by informing the frequent want of one or more of these requisites how well the other liked Bath, how much Mrs. Hughes admired its buildings and surrounding country, whether Mrs. Hughes drew, or played, or sang, and whether Mrs. Hughes was fond of riding on horseback.
The two dances were scarcely concluded before her dear Catherine found her dear Catherine arm gently seized by her dear Catherine faithful Isabella, who in great spirits exclaimed, “At last I have got you.
My dearest creature, I have been looking for My dearest creature this hour.
What could induce you to come into this set, when you knew I was in the other?
I have been quite wretched without My dearest creature.”  “her dear Isabella, how was it possible for me to get at her dear Isabella?
I could not even see where you were.”  “So I told your brother all the time--but your brother would not believe me.
Do go and see for her dear Isabella, Mr. Morland, said I--but all in vain--your brother would not stir an inch.
Was not it so, Mr. Morland?
But you men are all so immoderately lazy!
I have been scolding your brother to such a degree, her dear Catherine, you would be quite amazed.
You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people.”  “Look at that young lady with the white beads round that young lady with the white beads head,” whispered her dear Catherine, detaching that young lady with the white beads friend from James.
“It is Mr. Tilney’s sister.”  “Oh!
Heavens!
You don’t say so!
Let me look at her dear Isabella this moment.
What a delightful girl!
I never saw anything half so beautiful!
But where is her dear Isabella all-conquering brother?
Is her all-conquering brother in the room?
Point her all-conquering brother out to me this instant, if her all-conquering brother is.
I die to see her all-conquering brother.
Mr. Morland, you are not to listen.
We are not talking about Mr. Morland.”  “But what is all this whispering about?
What is going on?”  “There now, I knew how it would be.
You men have such restless curiosity!
Talk of the curiosity of women, indeed!
‘Tis nothing.
But be satisfied, for you are not to know anything at all of the matter.”  “And is that likely to satisfy me, do you think?”  “Well, I declare I never knew anything like me.
What can it signify to me, what We are talking of.
Perhaps We are talking about me; therefore I would advise you not to listen, or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable.”  In this commonplace chatter, which lasted some time, the original subject seemed entirely forgotten; and though Catherine was very well pleased to have the original subject dropped for a while, Catherine could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella’s impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney.
When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance, James would have led James fair partner away, but Catherine resisted.
“I tell you, Mr. Morland,” Catherine cried, “I would not do such a thing for all the world.
How can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what her all-conquering brother wants me to do.
her all-conquering brother wants me to dance with her all-conquering brother again, though I tell her all-conquering brother that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against the rules.
It would make We the talk of the place, if We were not to change partners.”  “Upon my honour,” said James, “in these public assemblies, it is as often done as not.”  “Nonsense, how can you say so?
But when you men have a point to carry, you never stick at anything.
Catherine, do support me; persuade her all-conquering brother how impossible it is.
Tell her all-conquering brother that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing; now would not it?”  “No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had much better change.”  “There,” cried Isabella, “you hear what your sister says, and yet you will not mind your sister.
Well, remember that it is not my fault, if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle.
Come along, my dearest Catherine, for heaven’s sake, and stand by me.” And off they went, to regain they former place.
Miss Thorpe, in the meanwhile, had walked away; and Catherine, ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once, made her way to Mrs. Allen and Miss Thorpe as fast as her could, in the hope of finding Mr. Tilney still with them--a hope which, when it proved to be fruitless, her felt to have been highly unreasonable.
“Well, my dear,”  said Mrs. Thorpe, impatient for praise of her son, “I hope you have had an agreeable partner.”  “Very agreeable, madam.”  “I am glad of an agreeable partner.
John has charming spirits, has not John?”  “Did you meet Mr. Tilney, my dear?” said Mr. Allen.
“No, where is John?”  “John was with us just now, and said John was so tired of lounging about, that John was resolved to go and dance; so I thought perhaps John would ask you, if John met with you.”  “Where can John be?” said Catherine, looking round; but Catherine had not looked round long before Catherine saw John leading a young lady to the dance.
“Ah!
John has got a partner; I wish John had asked you,” said Mr. Allen; and after a short silence, Mr. Allen added, “John is a very agreeable young man.”  “Indeed John is, Mr. Allen,” said Miss Thorpe, smiling complacently; “I must say it, though I am John mother, that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world.”  This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many; but This inapplicable answer did not puzzle Mr. Allen, for after only a moment’s consideration, Mr. Allen said, in a whisper to Catherine, “I dare say Mr. Allen thought I was speaking of Mr. Allen son.”  Catherine was disappointed and vexed.
Catherine seemed to have missed by so little the very object Catherine had had in view; and this persuasion did not incline Catherine to a very gracious reply, when Miss Thorpe came up to Catherine soon afterwards and said, “Well, Miss Morland, I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig this persuasion together again.”  “Oh, no; I am much obliged to you, our two dances are over; and, besides, I am tired, and do not mean to dance any more.”  “Do not you?
Then let our walk about and quiz people.
Come along with me, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my two younger sisters and their partners.
I have been laughing at their this half hour.”  Catherine Catherine excused Catherine; and at last Catherine walked off to quiz Catherine sisters by Catherine.
The rest of the evening Catherine found very dull; Miss Tilney was drawn away from all her party at tea, to attend that of Miss Tilney partner; Miss TilneyMiss Tilney, though belonging to it, did not sit near Catherine, and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile, one squeeze, and one “dearest Catherine.”
