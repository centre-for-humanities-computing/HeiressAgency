  The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of   The Allens stay in Bath; and whether it should be the last was for some time a question, to which Catherine listened with a beating heart. To have Catherine acquaintance with the Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance. Catherine whole happiness seemed at stake, while the affair was in suspense, and everything secured when the affair was determined that the lodgings should be taken for another fortnight. What another fortnight was to produce to Catherine beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine’s speculation. Once or twice indeed, since James’s engagement had taught Catherine what could be done, Catherine had got so far as to indulge in a secret “perhaps,” but in general the felicity of being with general for the present bounded Catherine views: the present was now comprised in another three weeks, and Catherine happiness being certain for that period, the rest of Catherine life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest. In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged, Catherine visited Henry Tilney, and poured forth Catherine joyful feelings. It was doomed to be a day of trial. No sooner had Catherine expressed Catherine delight in Mr. Allen’s lengthened stay than Henry Tilney told Catherine of Catherine father’s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week. Here was a blow! The past suspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment. Catherine’s countenance fell, and in a voice of most sincere concern Catherine echoed Miss Henry Tilney’s concluding words, “By the end of another week!”  “Yes, her father’s can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I think a fair trial. her father’s has been disappointed of some friends’ arrival whom her father’s expected to meet here, and as her father’s is now pretty well, is in a hurry to get home.”  “I am very sorry for it,” said Catherine dejectedly; “if I had known this before--”  “Perhaps,” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner, “you would be so good--it would make me very happy if--”  The entrance of her father’s put a stop to the civility, which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of the civility, which Catherine was beginning to hope corresponding. After addressing Catherine with her father’s usual politeness, her father’s turned to her father’s daughter and said, “Well, Eleanor, may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend?”  “I was just beginning to make the request, sir, as you came in.”  “Well, proceed by all means. I know how much your heart is in your heart. My daughter, Miss Morland,” sir continued, without leaving sir daughter time to speak, “has been forming a very bold wish. We leave Bath, as Bath has perhaps told you, on Saturday se’nnight. A letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home; and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here, some of my very old friends, there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath. And could We carry We selfish point with you, We should leave it without a single regret. Can you, in short, be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire? I am almost ashamed to make the request, though the request presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself. Modesty such as yours--but not for the world would I pain not for the world by open praise. If you can be induced to honour us with a visit, you will make us happy beyond expression. ‘Tis true, us can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place; us can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour, for us mode of living, as you see, is plain and unpretending; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on us side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable.”  Northanger Abbey! These were thrilling words, and wound up Catherine’s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy. Catherine grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness. To receive so flattering an invitation! To have Catherine company so warmly solicited! Everything honourable and soothing, every present enjoyment, and every future hope was contained in it; and Catherine acceptance, with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma’s approbation, was eagerly given. “I will write home directly,” said Catherine, “and if they do not object, as I dare say they will not--”  General Tilney was not less sanguine, having already waited on Catherine excellent friends in Pulteney Street, and obtained their sanction of General Tilney wishes. “Since their can consent to part with you,” said General Tilney, “we may expect philosophy from all the world.”  General Tilney General Tilney was earnest, though gentle, in General Tilney secondary civilities, and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to Fullerton would allow.  The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine’s feelings through the varieties of suspense, security, and disappointment; but their were now safely lodged in perfect bliss; and with spirits elated to rapture, with Henry at Catherine heart, and Northanger Abbey on Catherine lips, Catherine hurried home to write Catherine letter. Mr. and Mrs. Morland, relying on the discretion of the friends to whom Mr. and Mrs. Morland had already entrusted Mr. and Mrs. Morland daughter, felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had been formed under Mr. and Mrs. Morland eye, and sent therefore by return of post Mr. and Mrs. Morland ready consent to Catherine visit in Gloucestershire. This indulgence, though not more than Catherine had hoped for, completed Catherine conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature, in friends and fortune, circumstance and chance. Everything seemed to cooperate for Catherine advantage. By the kindness of Catherine first friends, the Allens, Catherine had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met Catherine. Catherine feelings, Catherine preferences, had each known the happiness of a return. Wherever Catherine felt attachment, Catherine had been able to create attachment. The affection of Isabella was to be secured to Catherine in a sister. The Tilneys, they, by whom, above all, Catherine desired to be favourably thought of, outstripped even Catherine wishes in the flattering measures by which their intimacy was to be continued. Catherine was to be their chosen visitor, Catherine was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society Catherine mostly prized--and, in addition to all the rest, the same roof with the person whose society she mostly prized was to be the roof of an abbey! Catherine passion for ancient edifices was next in degree to Catherine passion for Henry Tilney--and castles and abbeys made usually the charm of those reveries which Henry Tilney image did not fill. To see and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or the cloisters of the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though to be more than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire. And yet, this was to happen. With all the chances against Catherine of house, hall, place, park, court, and cottage, Northanger turned up an abbey, and Northanger was to be Northanger inhabitant. Northanger long, damp passages, Northanger narrow cells and ruined chapel, were to be within Northanger daily reach, and Northanger could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends, some awful memorials of an injured and ill-fated nun.  It was wonderful that Northanger friends should seem so little elated by the possession of such a home, that the consciousness of it should be so meekly borne. The power of early habit only could account for The power of early habit. A distinction to which they had been born gave no pride. they superiority of abode was no more to they than they superiority of person.  Many were the inquiries Northanger was eager to make of Miss Tilney; but so active were Northanger thoughts, that when these inquiries were answered, Northanger was hardly more assured than before, of Northanger Abbey having been a richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation, of Northanger Abbey having fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on Northanger Abbey dissolution, of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the present dwelling although the rest was decayed, or of Northanger Abbey standing low in a valley, sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak.
