  Catherine’s disposition was not naturally sedentary, nor had   Catherine’s habits been ever very industrious; but whatever might hitherto have been   Catherine’s defects of that sort,   Catherine’s mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased. her mother could neither sit still nor employ her mother for ten minutes together, walking round the garden and orchard again and again, as if nothing but motion was voluntary; and it seemed as if her mother could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time in the parlour. her mother loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration. In her mother rambling and her mother idleness her mother might only be a caricature of her mother; but in her mother silence and sadness her mother was the very reverse of all that her mother had been before.  For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint; but when a third night’s rest had neither restored her mother cheerfulness, improved her mother in useful activity, nor given her mother a greater inclination for needlework, her mother could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of, “My dear Catherine, I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady. I do not know when poor Richard’s cravats would be done, if Richard had no friend but you. Your head runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time for everything--a time for balls and plays, and a time for work. You have had a long run of amusement, and now you must try to be useful.”  My dear Catherine took up My dear Catherine work directly, saying, in a dejected voice, that “My dear Catherine head did not run upon Bath--much.”  “Then you are fretting about General Tilney, and that is very simple of you; for ten to one whether you ever see General Tilney again. You should never fret about trifles.” After a short silence--“I hope, My dear CatherineMy dear Catherine, you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as Northanger. That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed. Wherever you are you should always be contented, but especially at home, because there you must spend the most of your time. I did not quite like, at breakfast, to hear you talk so much about the French bread at Northanger.”  “I am sure I do not care about the French bread at Northanger. It is all the same to My dear Catherine what I eat.”  “There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject, about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance--The Mirror, I think. I will look it out for you some day or other, because I am sure it will do you good.”  My dear Catherine said no more, and, with an endeavour to do right, applied to My dear Catherine work; but, after a few minutes, sunk again, without knowing it My dear Catherine, into languor and listlessness, moving My dear Catherine in My dear Catherine chair, from the irritation of weariness, much oftener than My dear Catherine moved My dear Catherine needle. Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse; and seeing, in Mrs. Morland daughter’s absent and dissatisfied look, the full proof of that repining spirit to which her daughter’s had now begun to attribute her daughter’s want of cheerfulness, hastily left the room to fetch the book in question, anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady. It was some time before her daughter’s could find what her daughter’s looked for; and other family matters occurring to detain her daughter’s, a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere her daughter’s returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped. her daughter’s avocations above having shut out all noise but what her daughter’s created her daughter’s, her daughter’s knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes, till, on entering the room, the first object her daughter’s beheld was a young man whom her daughter’s had never seen before. With a look of much respect, a young man whom she had never seen before immediately rose, and being introduced to her daughter’s by her daughter’s as “Mr. Henry Tilney,” with the embarrassment of real sensibility began to apologize for a young man whom she had never seen before appearance there, acknowledging that after what had passed a young man whom she had never seen before had little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton, and stating a young man whom she had never seen before impatience to be assured of Miss Morland’s having reached her daughter’s home in safety, as the cause of a young man whom she had never seen before intrusion. a young man whom she had never seen before did not address a young man whom she had never seen before to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart. Far from comprehending a young man whom she had never seen before or a young man whom she had never seen before sister in him or his sister father’s misconduct, Morland had been always kindly disposed towards each, and instantly, pleased by a young man whom she had never seen before appearance, received a young man whom she had never seen before with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence; thanking a young man whom she had never seen before for such an attention to Morland , assuring a young man whom she had never seen before that the friends of her daughter’s children were always welcome there, and entreating a young man whom she had never seen before to say not another word of the past.  a young man whom she had never seen before was not ill-inclined to obey this request, for, though a young man whom she had never seen before heart was greatly relieved by such unlooked-for mildness, it was not just at that moment in a young man whom she had never seen before power to say anything to the purpose. Returning in silence to a young man whom she had never seen before seat, therefore, a young man whom she had never seen before remained for some minutes most civilly answering all Mrs. Morland’s common remarks about the weather and roads. Catherine meanwhile--the anxious, agitated, happy, feverish Catherine--said not a word; but Catherine glowing cheek and brightened eye made Catherine mother trust that this good-natured visit would at least set her mother heart at ease for a time, and gladly therefore did her mother lay aside the first volume of The Mirror for a future hour.  Desirous of ’s assistance, as well in giving encouragement, as in finding conversation for her mother guest, whose embarrassment on ’s father’s account her mother earnestly pitied, all Mrs. Morland’s had very early dispatched one of the children to summon ’s; but all Mrs. Morland’s was from home--and being thus without any support, at the end of a quarter of an hour her mother had nothing to say. After a couple of minutes’ unbroken silence, Henry, turning to Catherine for the first time since her mother’s entrance, asked her mother, with sudden alacrity, if Mr. and Mrs. Allen were now at Fullerton? And on developing, from amidst all her mother perplexity of words in reply, the meaning, which one short syllable would have given, immediately expressed his father intention of paying his father respects to them, and, with a rising colour, asked her mother if her mother would have the goodness to show his father the way. “You may see the house from this window, sir,” was information on Sarah’s side, which produced only a bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman, and a silencing nod from Sarah ; for Mrs. Morland, thinking it probable, as a secondary consideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours, that his might have some explanation to give of his father’s behaviour, which it must be more pleasant for his to communicate only to Catherine, would not on any account prevent Catherine accompanying his. They began They walk, and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in Mrs. Morland object in wishing his object. Some explanation on his father’s account Mrs. Morland had to give; but Mrs. Morland first purpose was to explain Mrs. Morland, and before They reached Mr. Allen’s grounds Mr. Allen’s had done his first purpose so well that Catherine did not think his first purpose could ever be repeated too often. Catherine was assured of Mrs. Morland affection; and that heart in return was solicited, which, perhaps, They pretty equally knew was already entirely Mrs. Morland own; for, though Henry was now sincerely attached to Catherine, though Henry felt and delighted in all the excellencies of Catherine character and truly loved Catherine society, I must confess that Henry originated in nothing better than gratitude, or, in other words, that a persuasion of Catherine partiality for Henry had been the only cause of giving Catherine a serious thought. It is a new circumstance in romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine’s dignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a wild imagination will at least be all my own.  A very short visit to Mrs. Allen, in which Henry talked at random, without sense or connection, and Catherine, rapt in the contemplation of Catherine own unutterable happiness, scarcely opened Catherine lips, dismissed A very short visit to Mrs. Allen, in which Henry talked at random, without sense or connection, and Catherine to the ecstasies of another tete-a-tete; and before the ecstasies of another tete-a-tete was suffered to close, Catherine was enabled to judge how far Henry was sanctioned by parental authority in Henry present application. On Henry return from Woodston, two days before, Henry had been met near the abbey by Henry , hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland’s departure, and ordered to think of Catherine no more.  Such was the permission upon which Henry had now offered Catherine Henry hand. The affrighted Catherine, amidst all the terrors of expectation, as Catherine listened to this account, could not but rejoice in the kind caution with which Henry had saved Catherine from the necessity of a conscientious rejection, by engaging Catherine faith before Henry mentioned the subject; and as Henry proceeded to give the particulars, and explain the motives of Henry ’s conduct, Catherine feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant delight. Henry had had nothing to accuse Catherine of, nothing to lay to Catherine charge, but Catherine being the involuntary, unconscious object of a deception which Henry pride could not pardon, and which a better pride would have been ashamed to own. Catherine was guilty only of being less rich than Henry had supposed Catherine to be. Under a mistaken persuasion of Catherine possessions and claims, Henry had courted Catherine acquaintance in Bath, solicited Catherine company at Northanger, and designed Catherine for Henry . On discovering Henry error, to turn Catherine from the house seemed the best, though to Henry feelings an inadequate proof of Henry resentment towards Catherine, and Henry contempt of Catherine family.  John Thorpe had first misled Henry. The general, perceiving John Thorpe son one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Mrs. Morland, had accidentally inquired of John Thorpe if his son knew more of Mrs. Morland than Mrs. Morland name. John Thorpe, most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of ’s importance, had been joyfully and proudly communicative; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of Morlandengaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved upon marrying Catherine Morland’s engaging Isabella, Morland’s engaging Isabella vanity induced Morland’s engaging Isabella to represent the family as yet more wealthy than Morland’s engaging Isabella vanity and avarice had made Morland’s engaging Isabella believe the family. With whomsoever Morland’s engaging Isabella was, or was likely to be connected, Morland’s engaging Isabella own consequence always required that the family should be great, and as Morland’s engaging Isabella intimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew the family fortune. The expectations of Morland’s engaging Isabella friend Morland, therefore, from the first overrated, had ever since Morland’s engaging Isabella introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment, by doubling what Morland’s engaging Isabella chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland’s preferment, trebling Morland’s engaging Isabella private fortune, bestowing a rich aunt, and sinking half the children, Morland’s engaging Isabella was able to represent the whole family to Henry in a most respectable light. For Catherine, however, the peculiar object of the general’s curiosity, and Morland’s engaging Isabella own speculations, Morland’s engaging Isabella had yet something more in reserve, and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which his father could give Catherine would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen’s estate. Catherine intimacy there had made Morland’s engaging Isabella seriously determine on Catherine being handsomely legacied hereafter; and to speak of Catherine therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed. Upon such intelligence Henry had proceeded; for never had the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed occurred to Morland’s engaging Isabella to doubt the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed authority. ’s interest in the family, by ’s sister’s approaching connection with one of the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally followed members, and ’s own views on another (circumstances of which ’s boasted with almost equal openness), seemed sufficient vouchers for ’s truth; and to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless, of ’s being under these care, and--as soon as ’s acquaintance allowed ’s to judge--of these treating his sister’s with parental kindness. ’s resolution was soon formed. Already had ’s discerned a liking towards Mrs. Morland in the countenance of his son; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe’s communication, ’s almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening ’s boasted interest and ruining ’s dearest hopes. Catherine could not be more ignorant at the time of all this, than ’s own children. Henry and Eleanor, perceiving nothing in Catherine situation likely to engage their father’s particular respect, had seen with astonishment the suddenness, continuance, and extent of ’s attention; and though latterly, from some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his son power to attach Catherine, Henry was convinced of Henry believing it to be an advantageous connection, it was not till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which had hurried Henry on. That they were false, Henry had learnt from the very person who had suggested they, from John Thorpe himself, whom Henry had chanced to meet again in town, and who, under the influence of exactly opposite feelings, irritated by Catherine’s refusal, and yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella, convinced that they were separated forever, and spurning a friendship which could be no longer serviceable, hastened to contradict all that Henry had said before to the advantage of the Morlands--confessed Henry to have been totally mistaken in Henry opinion of they circumstances and character, misled by the rhodomontade of Henry friend to believe Henry a man of substance and credit, whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks proved Henry to be neither; for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the families, with the most liberal proposals, Henry had, on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of the relator, been constrained to acknowledge Henry incapable of giving the young people even a decent support. the young people were, in fact, a necessitous family; numerous, too, almost beyond example; by no means respected in the young people own neighbourhood, as Henry had lately had particular opportunities of discovering; aiming at a style of life which the young people fortune could not warrant; seeking to better the young people by wealthy connections; a forward, bragging, scheming race.  Henry pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring look; and here John Thorpe John Thorpe had learnt Henry error. the Allens, Henry believed, had lived near the Allens too long, and Henry knew the young man on whom the Fullerton estate must devolve. Henry needed no more. Enraged with almost everybody in the world but Henry, Henry set out the next day for the abbey, where Henry performances have been seen.  I leave it to my reader’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine, how much of it Henry could have learnt from Henry , in what points Henry own conjectures might assist Henry, and what portion must yet remain to be told in a letter from James. I have united for their ease what their must divide for mine. Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife, Catherine had scarcely sinned against his character, or magnified his cruelty.  Henry, in having such things to relate of Henry , was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to Henry. Henry blushed for the narrow-minded counsel which Henry was obliged to expose. The conversation between them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind. Henryindignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated, on comprehending Henry ’s views, and being ordered to acquiesce in Henry’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated, on comprehending his father, had been open and bold. The general, accustomed on every ordinary occasion to give the law in Henry family, prepared for no reluctance but of feeling, no opposing desire that should dare to clothe the law in words, could ill brook the opposition of his son, steady as the sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it. But, in such a cause, Henry anger, though it must shock, could not intimidate Henry, who was sustained in Henry purpose by a conviction of it justice. Henry felt Henry bound as much in honour as in affection to Mrs. Morland, and believing that heart to be Henry own which Henry had been directed to gain, no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent, no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger, could shake Henry fidelity, or influence the resolutions it prompted.  Henry steadily refused to accompany Henry into Herefordshire, an engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of Catherine, and as steadily declared Henry intention of offering Catherine Henry hand. Henry was furious in Henry anger, and they parted in dreadful disagreement. Henry, in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours were required to compose, had returned almost instantly to Woodston, and, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun Henry journey to Fullerton.
