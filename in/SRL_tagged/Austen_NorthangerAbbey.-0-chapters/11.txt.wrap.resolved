  The morrow brought a very sober-looking morning, the sun making only a few efforts to appear, and Catherine augured from the sun everything most favourable to Catherine wishes. A bright morning so early in the year, Catherine allowed, would generally turn to rain, but a cloudy one foretold improvement as the day advanced. Catherine applied to Mr. Allen for confirmation of Catherine hopes, but Mr. Allen, not having Mr. Allen own skies and barometer about Mr. Allen, declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine. Catherine applied to Mr. Allen, and Mrs. Allen’s opinion was more positive. “Catherine had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day, if the clouds would only go off, and the sun keep out.”  At about eleven o’clock, however, a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught Catherine’s watchful eye, and “Oh! dear, I do believe it will be wet,” broke from Catherine in a most desponding tone.  “I thought how it would be,” said Mr. Allen.  “No walk for Mr. Allen today,” sighed Catherine; “but perhaps it may come to nothing, or it may hold up before twelve.”  “Perhaps it may, but then, my dear, it will be so dirty.”  “Oh! That will not signify; I never mind dirt.”  “No,” replied her friend very placidly, “I know you never mind dirt.”  After a short pause, “It comes on faster and faster!” said Catherine, as Catherine stood watching at a window.  “So it does indeed. If it keeps raining, the streets will be very wet.”  “There are four umbrellas up already. How I hate the sight of an umbrella!”  “They are disagreeable things to carry. I would much rather take a chair at any time.”  “It was such a nice-looking morning! I felt so convinced It would be dry!”  “Anybody would have thought so indeed. There will be very few people in the pump-room, if it rains all the morning. I hope Mr. Allen will put on Mr. Allen greatcoat when Mr. Allen goes, but I dare say Mr. Allen will not, for Mr. Allen had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat; I wonder Mr. Allen should dislike it, it must be so comfortable.”  The rain continued--fast, though not heavy. Catherine went every five minutes to the clock, threatening on each return that, if it still kept on raining another five minutes, Catherine would give up the matter as hopeless. the clock struck twelve, and the clock still rained. “You will not be able to go, my dear.”  “I do not quite despair yet. I shall not give not quite despair yet up till a quarter after twelve. This is just the time of day for it to clear up, and I do think it looks a little lighter. There, it is twenty minutes after twelve, and now I shall give it up entirely. Oh! That we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho, or at least in Tuscany and the south of France!--the night that poor St. Aubin died!--such beautiful weather!”  At half past twelve, when Catherine’s anxious attention to the weather was over and Catherine could no longer claim any merit from Catherine’s amendment, the sky began voluntarily to clear. A gleam of sunshine took Catherine quite by surprise; Catherine looked round; the clouds were parting, and Catherine instantly returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance. Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed, and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen, who had “always thought it would clear up.” But whether Catherine might still expect Catherine friends, whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture, must yet be a question.  It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany Mrs. Allen husband to the pump-room; her husband accordingly set off by her husband, and Catherine had barely watched her husband down the street when Catherine notice was claimed by the approach of the same two open carriages, containing the same three people that had surprised Catherine so much a few mornings back.  “Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe, I declare! Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe are coming for her husband perhaps--but I shall not go--I cannot go indeed, for Miss Morland.” Mrs. Allen agreed to it. John Thorpe was soon with Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe, and John Thorpe voice was with Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe yet sooner, for on the stairs John Thorpe was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick. “Make haste! Make haste!”  as John Thorpe threw open the door. “Put on your hat this moment--there is no time to be lost--we are going to Bristol. How d’ye do, Mrs. Allen?”  “To Bristol! Is not that a great way off? But, however, I cannot go with you today, because I am engaged; I expect some friends every moment.”  This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all; Mrs. Allen was called on to second Mrs. Allen, and the two others walked in, to give the two others assistance. “My sweetest Catherine, is not this delightful? We shall have a most heavenly drive. You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme; the scheme darted into We heads at breakfast-time, I verily believe at the same instant; and We should have been off two hours ago if the scheme had not been for this detestable rain. But the scheme does not signify, the nights are moonlight, and We shall do delightfully. Oh! I am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet! So much better than going to the Lower Rooms. We shall drive directly to Clifton and dine there; and, as soon as dinner is over, if there is time for it, go on to Kingsweston.”  “I doubt We being able to do so much,” said Morland.  “You croaking fellow!” cried Thorpe. “We shall be able to do ten times more. Kingsweston! Aye, and Blaize Castle too, and anything else we can hear of; but here is your sister says your sister will not go.”  Blaize Castle!” cried Catherine. “What is that?”  “The finest place in England--worth going fifty miles at any time to see.”  “What, is it really a castle, an old castle?”  “The oldest in the kingdom.”  “But is it like what one reads of?”  “Exactly--the very same.”  “But now really--are there towers and long galleries?”  “By dozens.”  “Then I should like to see it; but I cannot--I cannot go.”  “Not go! My beloved creature, what do you mean?”  “I cannot go, because”--looking down as she spoke, fearful of Isabella’s smile--“I expect Miss Tilney and she brother to call on me to take a country walk. Miss Tilney and her brother promised to come at twelve, only it rained; but now, as it is so fine, I dare say Miss Tilney and her brother will be here soon.”  “Not Miss Tilney and her brother indeed,” cried Thorpe; “for, as we turned into Broad Street, I saw Miss Tilney and her brother--does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts?”  “I do not know indeed.”  “Yes, I know he does; I saw he. You are talking of the man you danced with last night, are not you?”  “Yes.”  “Well, I saw he at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road, driving a smart-looking girl.”  “Did you indeed?”  “Did upon my soul; knew he again directly, and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too.”  “It is very odd! But I suppose Miss Tilney and her brother thought it would be too dirty for a walk.”  “And well Miss Tilney and her brother might, for I never saw so much dirt in my life. Walk! You could no more walk than you could fly! It has not been so dirty the whole winter; It is ankle-deep everywhere.”  Isabella corroborated it: “My dearest Catherine, you cannot form an idea of the dirt; come, you must go; you cannot refuse going now.”  “I should like to see the castle; but may we go all over the castle? May we go up every staircase, and into every suite of rooms?”  “Yes, yes, every hole and corner.”  “But then, if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer, and call by and by?”  “Make yourself easy, there is no danger of that, for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback, that they were going as far as Wick Rocks.”  “Then I will. Shall I go, Mrs. Allen?”  “Just as you please, my dear.”  “Mrs. Allen, you must persuade Mrs. Allen to go,” was the general cry. Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it: “Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Allen, “suppose you go.” And in two minutes they were off.  My dearest Catherine’s feelings, as My dearest Catherine got into the carriage, were in a very unsettled state; divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure, and the hope of soon enjoying another, almost its equal in degree, however unlike in kind. My dearest Catherine could not think the Tilneys had acted quite well by My dearest Catherine, in so readily giving up their engagement, without sending My dearest Catherine any message of excuse. It was now but an hour later than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk; and, in spite of what My dearest Catherine had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course of that hour, My dearest Catherine could not from My dearest Catherine own observation help thinking that their might have gone with very little inconvenience. To feel My dearest Catherine slighted by their was very painful. On the other hand, the delight of exploring an edifice like Udolpho, as My dearest Catherine fancy represented Blaize Castle to be, was such a counterpoise of good as might console My dearest Catherine for almost anything.  their passed briskly down Pulteney Street, and through Laura Place, without the exchange of many words. John Thorpe talked to John Thorpe horse, and John Thorpe meditated, by turns, on broken promises and broken arches, phaetons and false hangings, Tilneys and trap-doors. As they entered Argyle Buildings, however, John Thorpe was roused by this address from John Thorpe companion, “Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as John Thorpe went by?”  “Who? Where?”  “On the right-hand pavement--John Thorpe must be almost out of sight now.”  Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on Catherine brother’s arm, walking slowly down Pulteney Street. Catherine saw them both looking back at Catherine. “Stop, stop, John Thorpe,” Catherine impatiently cried; “it is Miss Tilney; it is indeed. How could you tell me them were gone? Stop, stop, I will get out this moment and go to them.” But to what purpose did Catherine speak? John Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys, who had soon ceased to look after Catherine, were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place, and in another moment Catherine was Catherine whisked into the marketplace. Still, however, and during the length of another street, Catherine entreated him to stop. “Pray, pray stop, John Thorpe. I cannot go on. I will not go on. I must go back to Miss Tilney.” But John Thorpe only laughed, smacked John Thorpe whip, encouraged his horse, made odd noises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as Catherine was, having no power of getting away, was obliged to give up the point and submit. Catherine reproaches, however, were not spared. “How could you deceive me so, John Thorpe? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road? I would not have had the Lansdown Road happen so for the world. They must think it so strange, so rude of me! To go by They, too, without saying a word! You do not know how vexed I am; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, nor in anything else. I had rather, ten thousand times rather, get out now, and walk back to They. How could you say you saw They driving out in a phaeton?” John Thorpe defended John Thorpe very stoutly, declared John Thorpe had never seen two men so much alike in John Thorpe life, and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself.  two men drive, even when this subject was over, was not likely to be very agreeable. Catherine’s complaisance was no longer what Catherine’s complaisance had been in two men former airing. Catherine listened reluctantly, and Catherine replies were short. Blaize Castle remained Catherine only comfort; towards that, Catherine still looked at intervals with pleasure; though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk, and especially rather than be thought ill of by the Tilneys, Catherine would willingly have given up all the happiness which Blaize Castle walls could supply--the happiness of a progress through a long suite of lofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture, though now for many years deserted--the happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow, winding vaults, by a low, grated door; or even of having their lamp, their only lamp, extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, and of being left in total darkness. In the meanwhile, their proceeded on their journey without any mischance, and were within view of the town of Keynsham, when a halloo from Morland, who was behind their, made his friend pull up, to know what was the matter. The others then came close enough for conversation, and Morland said, “We had better go back, John Thorpe; it is too late to go on today; your sister thinks so as well as
