  A moment’s glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that Catherine apartment was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm Catherine by the description of. It was by no means unreasonably large, and contained neither tapestry nor velvet. The walls were papered, the floor was carpeted; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those of the drawing-room below; the furniture, though not of the latest fashion, was handsome and comfortable, and the air of the room altogether far from uncheerful. Catherine heart instantaneously at ease on this point, Catherine resolved to lose no time in particular examination of anything, as Catherine greatly dreaded disobliging the general by any delay. Catherine habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste, and Catherine was preparing to unpin the linen package, which the chaise-seat had conveyed for Catherine immediate accommodation, when Catherine eye suddenly fell on a large high chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace. The sight of it made Catherine start; and, forgetting everything else, Catherine stood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts crossed Catherine:  “This is strange indeed! I did not expect such a sight as this! An immense heavy chest! What can it hold? Why should it be placed here? Pushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight! I will look into it--cost me what it may, I will look into it--and directly too--by daylight. If I stay till evening my candle may go out.” Catherine advanced and examined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darker wood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of the same. The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each end were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken perhaps prematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, was a mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it intently, but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty. Catherine could not, in whatever direction Catherine took it, believe the last letter to be a T; and yet that the last letter should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment. If not originally theirs, by what strange events could it have fallen into the Tilney family?  Catherine fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing, with trembling hands, the hasp of The lock, Catherine resolved at all hazards to satisfy Catherine at least as to it contents. With difficulty, for something seemed to resist Catherine efforts, Catherine raised the lid a few inches; but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made Catherine, starting, quit Catherine hold, and the lid closed with alarming violence. This ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney’s maid, sent by Catherine mistress to be of use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed Catherine, This ill-timed intruder recalled Catherine to the sense of what Catherine ought to be doing, and forced Catherine, in spite of Catherine anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed in Catherine dressing without further delay. Catherine progress was not quick, for Catherine thoughts and Catherine eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm; and though Catherine dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt, Catherine could not remain many paces from the chest. At length, however, having slipped one arm into Catherine gown, Catherine toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of Catherine curiosity might safely be indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate should be the exertion of Catherine strength, that, unless secured by supernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back. With this spirit Catherine sprang forward, and Catherine confidence did not deceive Catherine. Catherine resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave to Catherine astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane, properly folded, reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession!  Catherine was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney, anxious for Catherine friend’s being ready, entered the room, and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation, was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search. “That is a curious old chest, is not it?” said Miss Tilney, as Catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass. “It is impossible to say how many generations it has been here. How it came to be first put in the room I know not, but I have not had it moved, because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets. The worst of it is that it weight makes its weight difficult to open. In that corner, however, it is at least out of the way.”  Catherine had no leisure for speech, being at once blushing, tying Catherine gown, and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch. Miss Tilney gently hinted Miss Tilney fear of being late; and in half a minute they ran downstairs together, in an alarm not wholly unfounded, for Miss Tilney was pacing the drawing-room, Miss Tilney watch in Miss Tilney hand, and having, on the very instant of they entering, pulled the bell with violence, ordered “Dinner to be on table directly!”  Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which Catherine spoke, and sat pale and breathless, in a most humble mood, concerned for Catherine children, and detesting old chests; and the general, recovering Catherine politeness as Catherine looked at Catherine, spent the rest of Catherine time in scolding Catherine daughter for so foolishly hurrying his daughter fair friend, who was absolutely out of breath from haste, when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world: but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved Catherine friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton Catherine, till the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself were happily seated at the dinner-table, when the general’s complacent smiles, and a good appetite of Catherine own, restored Catherine to peace. The dining-parlour was a noble room, suitable in The dining-parlour dimensions to a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use, and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of Catherine, who saw little more than The dining-parlour spaciousness and the number of their attendants. Of the former, Catherine spoke aloud Catherine admiration; and the general, with a very gracious countenance, acknowledged that it was by no means an ill-sized room, and further confessed that, though as careless on such subjects as most people, he did look upon a tolerably large eating-room as one of the necessaries of life; he supposed, however, “that Catherine must have been used to much better-sized apartments at Mr. Allen’s?”  “No, indeed,” was Mr. Allen’s honest assurance; “Mr. Allen’s dining-parlour was not more than half as large,” and Catherine had never seen so large a room as this in Catherine life. Mr. Allen’s good humour increased. Why, as he had such rooms, he thought it would be simple not to make use of he had such rooms; but, upon he honour, he believed there might be more comfort in rooms of only half he had such rooms size. Mr. Allen’s house, he was sure, must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness.  The evening passed without any further disturbance, and, in the occasional absence of General Tilney, with much positive cheerfulness. It was only in General Tilney presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue from Catherine journey; and even then, even in moments of languor or restraint, a sense of general happiness preponderated, and Catherine could think of Catherine friends in Bath without one wish of being with her friends in Bath.  The night was stormy; the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon; and by the time the party broke up, the party blew and rained violently. Catherine, as Catherine crossed the hall, listened to the tempest with sensations of awe; and, when Catherine heard the party rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door, felt for the first time that Catherine was really in an abbey. Yes, these were characteristic sounds; these brought to Catherine recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes, which such buildings had witnessed, and such storms ushered in; and most heartily did Catherine rejoice in the happier circumstances attending Catherine entrance within walls so solemn! Catherine had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants. Henry had certainly been only in jest in what Henry had told Catherine that morning. In a house so furnished, and so guarded, Catherine could have nothing to explore or to suffer, and might go to Catherine bedroom as securely as if it had been Catherine own chamber at Fullerton. Thus wisely fortifying Catherine mind, as Catherine proceeded upstairs, Catherine was enabled, especially on perceiving that Miss Tilney Miss Tilney slept only two doors from Catherine, to enter Catherine room with a tolerably stout heart; and Catherine spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire. “How much better is this,” said Catherine, as Catherine walked to the fender--“how much better to find a fire ready lit, than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed, as so many poor girls have been obliged to do, and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot! How glad I am that Northanger is what Northanger is! If it had been like some other places, I do not know that, in such a night as this, I could have answered for my courage: but now, to be sure, there is nothing to alarm one.”  Catherine looked round the room. The window curtains seemed in motion. The window curtains could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the divisions of the shutters; and Catherine stepped boldly forward, carelessly humming a tune, to assure Catherine of its being so, peeped courageously behind each curtain, saw nothing on either low window seat to scare Catherine, and on placing a hand against the shutter, felt the strongest conviction of the wind’s force. A glance at the old chest, as Catherine turned away from this examination, was not without its use; Catherine scorned the causeless fears of an idle fancy, and began with a most happy indifference to prepare Catherine for bed. “Catherine should take Catherine time; Catherine should not hurry Catherine; Catherine did not care if Catherine were the last person up in the house. But Catherine would not make up Catherine fire; that would seem cowardly, as if Catherine wished for the protection of light after Catherine were in bed.” her fire therefore died away, and Catherine, having spent the best part of an hour in Catherine arrangements, was beginning to think of stepping into bed, when, on giving a parting glance round the room, Catherine was struck by the appearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet, which, though in a situation conspicuous enough, had never caught Catherine notice before. Henry’s words, Henry description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape Catherine observation at first, immediately rushed across Catherine; and though there could be nothing really in it, there was something whimsical, it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence! Catherine took Catherine candle and looked closely at the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first. It was not absolutely ebony and gold; but It was japan, black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind; and as Catherine held her candle, the yellow had very much the effect of gold. The key was in the door, and Catherine had a strange fancy to look into The key; not, however, with the smallest expectation of finding anything, but it was so very odd, after what Henry had said. In short, Catherine could not sleep till Catherine had examined it. So, placing her candle with great caution on a chair, Catherine seized The key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn The key; but The key resisted Catherine utmost strength. Alarmed, but not discouraged, Catherine tried The key another way; a bolt flew, and Catherine believed Catherine successful; but how strangely mysterious! the door was still immovable. Catherine paused a moment in breathless wonder. the wind roared down the chimney, the rain beat in torrents against the windows, and everything seemed to speak the awfulness of Catherine situation. To retire to bed, however, unsatisfied on such a point, would be vain, since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in Catherine immediate vicinity. Again, therefore, Catherine applied Catherine to The key, and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hopeMr. Allen’s last effort, the door suddenly yielded to Catherine hand: Catherine heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, and having thrown open each folding door, the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock, though in that Catherine eye could not discern anything unusual, a double range of small drawers appeared in view, with some larger drawers above and below some larger drawers; and in the centre, a small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in all probability a cavity of importance.  Catherine’s heart beat quick, but Catherine’s did not fail Catherine’s. With a cheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, Catherine’s fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew her fingers forth. her fingers was entirely empty. With less alarm and greater eagerness Catherine’s seized a second, a third, a fourth; each was equally empty. Not one was left unsearched, and in not one was anything found. Well read in the art of concealing a treasure, the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape Catherine’s, and Catherine’s felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain. The place in the middle alone remained now unexplored; and though Catherine’s had “never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first, and was not in the least disappointed at Catherine’s ill success thus far, it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while Catherine’s was about it.” It was some time however before Catherine’s could unfasten the door, the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer; but at length it did open; and not vain, as hitherto, was Catherine’s search; Catherine’s quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity, apparently for concealment, and Catherine’s feelings at that moment were indescribable. Catherine’s heart fluttered, Catherine’s knees trembled, and Catherine’s cheeks grew pale. Catherine’s seized, with an unsteady hand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters; and while Catherine’s acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold, resolved instantly to peruse every line before Catherine’s attempted to rest.  The dimness of the light Catherine’s emitted made Catherine’s turn to The dimness of the light her candle emitted with alarm; but there was no danger of The dimness of the light her candle emitted sudden extinction; The dimness of the light her candle emitted had yet some hours to burn; and that Catherine’s might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what The dimness of the light her candle emitted ancient date might occasion, Catherine’s hastily snuffed The dimness of the light her candle emitted. Alas! The dimness of the light her candle emitted was snuffed and extinguished in one. A lamp could not have expired with more awful effect. Catherine, for a few moments, was motionless with horror. It was done completely; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath. Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room. A violent gust of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment. Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded, a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on Catherine affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more. A cold sweat stood on Catherine forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand, and groping Catherine way to the bed, Catherine jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes. To close Catherine eyes in sleep that night, Catherine felt must be entirely out of the question. With a curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every way so agitated, repose must be absolutely impossible. The storm too abroad so dreadful! Catherine had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence. the manuscript so wonderfully found, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning’s prediction, how was the manuscript to be accounted for? What could the manuscript contain? To whom could the manuscript relate? By what means could the manuscript have been so long concealed? And how singularly strange that the manuscript should fall to Catherine lot to discover the manuscript! Till Catherine had made Catherine mistress of the manuscript contents, however, Catherine could have neither repose nor comfort; and with the sun’s first rays Catherine was determined to peruse herself mistress of its contents. But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene. Catherine shuddered, tossed about in the bed, and envied every quiet sleeper. The storm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific even than the wind, which struck at intervals on Catherine startled ear. The very curtains of the bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another the lock of Catherine door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than once Catherine blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour after hour passed away, and Catherine Catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or Catherine unknowingly fell fast asleep.
