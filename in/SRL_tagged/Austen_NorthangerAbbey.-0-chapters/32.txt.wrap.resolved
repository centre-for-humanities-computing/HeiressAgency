  Mr. and Mrs. Morland’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for   Mr. and Mrs. Morland consent to Mr. Tilney marrying   Mr. and Mrs. Morland daughter was, for a few minutes, considerable, their daughter having never entered   Mr. and Mrs. Morland heads to suspect an attachment on either side; but as nothing, after all, could be more natural than Catherine’s being beloved,   Mr. and Mrs. Morland soon learnt to consider their daughter with only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far as   Mr. and Mrs. Morland alone were concerned, had not a single objection to start. His pleasing manners and good sense were self-evident recommendations; and having never heard evil of His, it was not His pleasing manners and good sense way to suppose any evil could be told. Goodwill supplying the place of experience, Goodwill supplying the place of experience character needed no attestation. “Catherine would make a sad, heedless young housekeeper to be sure,” was Catherine mother’s foreboding remark; but quick was the consolation of there being nothing like practice.  There was but one obstacle, in short, to be mentioned; but till that one was removed, it must be impossible for a sad, heedless young housekeeper to sanction the engagement. a sad, heedless young housekeeper tempers were mild, but a sad, heedless young housekeeper principles were steady, and while his parent so expressly forbade the connection, a sad, heedless young housekeeper could not allow a sad, heedless young housekeeper to encourage the connection. That the general should come forward to solicit the alliance, or that the general should even very heartily approve the connection, the general should come forward to solicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded, and that once obtained--and the general should come forward to solicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it own hearts made the general should come forward to solicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it trust that the connection could not be very long denied--the general should come forward to solicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it willing approbation was instantly to follow. the general consent was all that the general should come forward to solicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it wished for. the general should come forward to solicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it were no more inclined than entitled to demand the general money. Of a very considerable fortune, the general son was, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his son present income was an income of independence and comfort, and under every pecuniary view, it was a match beyond the claims of an income of independence and comfort daughter.  The young people could not be surprised at a decision like this. The young people felt and The young people deplored--but The young people could not resent a decision like this; and The young people parted, endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general, as each believed almost impossible, might speedily take place, to unite The young people again in the fullness of privileged affection. Henry returned to what was now Henry only home, to watch over Henry young plantations, and extend Henry improvements for her sake, to whose share in The young people Henry looked anxiously forward; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry. Whether the torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence, let us not inquire. Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did--Mr. and Mrs. Morland had been too kind to exact any promise; and whenever Catherine received a letter, as, at that time, happened pretty often, Mr. and Mrs. Morland always looked another way.  The anxiety, which in this state of Mr. and Mrs. Morland attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine, and of all who loved either, as to this state of their attachment final event, can hardly extend, I fear, to the bosom of my readers, who will see in the tell-tale compression of the pages before Mr. and Mrs. Morland, that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity. The means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt: what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the general’s? The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course of the summer--an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour, from which him did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained him forgiveness of Henry, and him permission for him “to be a fool if him liked it!”  The marriage of Eleanor Tilney, Eleanor Tilney removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been made by Henry’s banishment, to the home of Eleanor Tilney choice and the man of her choice, is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all Eleanor Tilney acquaintance. My own joy on the occasion is very sincere. I know no one more entitled, by unpretending merit, or better prepared by habitual suffering, to receive and enjoy felicity. Eleanor Tilney partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin; and this gentleman had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from addressing Eleanor Tilney. this gentleman unexpected accession to title and fortune had removed all this gentleman difficulties; and never had the general loved this gentleman daughter so well in all his daughter hours of companionship, utility, and patient endurance as when this gentleman first hailed his daughter “Your Ladyship!” his daughter husband was really deserving of his daughter; independent of Her husband peerage, Her husband wealth, and Her husband attachment, being to a precision the most charming young man in the world. Any further definition of Her husband merits must be unnecessary; the most charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination of us all. Concerning the one in question, therefore, I have only to add--aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable--that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind whose negligent servant that collection of washing-bills, resulting from a long visit at Northanger, by which my heroine was involved in one of my heroine most alarming adventures.  The influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother’s behalf was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland’s circumstances which, as soon as the general would allow the general to be informed, they were qualified to give. It taught the general that the general had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe’s first boast of the family wealth than by the general subsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no sense of the word were they necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would have three thousand pounds. This was so material an amendment of the general late expectations that This greatly contributed to smooth the descent of the general pride; and by no means without This effect was the private intelligence, which the general was at some pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely at the disposal of the Fullerton estate present proprietor, was consequently open to every greedy speculation.  On the strength of this, the general, soon after Eleanor’s marriage, permitted soon after Eleanor son to return to Northanger, and thence made his son the bearer of his son consent, very courteously worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland. The event which it authorized soon followed: Henry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and everybody smiled; and, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of Henry and Catherine meeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful delays occasioned by the general’s cruelty, that Henry and Catherine were essentially hurt by it. To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen is to do pretty well; and professing myself moreover convinced that the general’s unjust interference, so far from being really injurious to the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to it, by improving the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen knowledge of each other, and adding strength to the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen attachment, I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may concern, whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, or reward filial disobedience.    *Vide a letter from Mr. Richardson, No. 97, Vol. II, Rambler.
