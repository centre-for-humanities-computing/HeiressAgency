  A few days passed away, and Catherine, though not allowing Catherine to suspect Catherine friend, could not help watching Catherine closely. The result of Catherine observations was not agreeable. Isabella seemed an altered creature. When Isabella saw Isabella, indeed, surrounded only by their immediate friends in Edgar’s Buildings or Pulteney Street, Isabella change of manners was so trifling that, had her change of manners gone no farther, her change of manners might have passed unnoticed. A something of languid indifference, or of that boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before, would occasionally come across Catherine; but had nothing worse appeared, that might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But when Catherine saw Catherine in public, admitting Captain Tilney’s attentions as readily as Captain Tilney’s attentions were offered, and allowing Captain Tilney’s almost an equal share with James in Catherine notice and smiles, the alteration became too positive to be passed over. What could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what her friend could be at, was beyond Catherine comprehension. Isabella could not be aware of the pain Isabella was inflicting; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent. James was the sufferer. Catherine saw James grave and uneasy; and however careless of James present comfort Catherine might be who had given James Catherine heart, to Catherine it was always an object. For poor Captain Tilney too Catherine was greatly concerned. Though James looks did not please Catherine, James name was a passport to Catherine goodwill, and Catherine thought with sincere compassion of James approaching disappointment; for, in spite of what Catherine had believed Catherine to overhear in the pump-room, James behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella’s engagement that Catherine could not, upon reflection, imagine James aware of it. James might be jealous of Catherine brother as a rival, but if more had seemed implied, the fault must have been in Catherine misapprehension. Catherine wished, by a gentle remonstrance, to remind Isabella of Catherine situation, and make Catherine aware of this double unkindness; but for remonstrance, either opportunity or comprehension was always against Catherine. If able to suggest a hint, Isabella could never understand it. In this distress, the intended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation; the Tilney family journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days, and Captain Tilney’s removal would at least restore peace to every heart but Tilney own. But Tilney had at present no intention of removing; Tilney was not to be of the party to Northanger; Tilney was to continue at Bath. When Catherine knew this, Catherine resolution was directly made. Catherine spoke to Tilney on the subject, regretting Tilney brother’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe, and entreating Tilney to make known Catherine prior engagement.  “his brother’s does know it,” was Henry’s answer.  “Does his brother’s? Then why does his brother’s stay here?”  his brother’s made no reply, and was beginning to talk of something else; but Catherine eagerly continued, “Why do not you persuade his brother’s to go away? The longer his brother’s stays, The worse it will be for his brother’s at last. Pray advise his brother’s for his brother’s own sake, and for everybody’s sake, to leave Bath directly. Absence will in time make his brother’s comfortable again; but his brother’s can have no hope here, and it is only staying to be miserable.”  Tilney smiled and said, “I am sure his brother’s would not wish to do that.”  “Then you will persuade his brother’s to go away?”  “Persuasion is not at command; but pardon me, if I cannot even endeavour to persuade Persuasion. I have myself told Tilney that Miss Thorpe is engaged. Tilney knows what Tilney is about, and must be Tilney own master.”  “No, Tilney does not know what Tilney is about,” cried Catherine; “Tilney does not know the pain Tilney is giving his brother’s. Not that James has ever told me so, but I am sure James is very uncomfortable.”  “And are you sure it is his brother’s doing?”  “Yes, very sure.”  “Is it his brother’s attentions to Miss Thorpe, or Miss Thorpe’s admission of my brother’s attentions, that gives the pain?”  “Is not it the same thing?”  “I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference. No man is offended by another man’s admiration of the woman No man loves; it is the woman he loves only who can make it a torment.”  Catherine blushed for Catherine friend, and said, “Isabella is wrong. But I am sure Catherine cannot mean to torment, for Catherine is very much attached to his brother’s. Catherine has been in love with his brother’s ever since they first met, and while my father’s consent was uncertain, Catherine fretted Catherine almost into a fever. You know Catherine must be attached to his brother’s.”  “I understand: Catherine is in love with James, and flirts with Frederick.”  “Oh! no, not flirts. A woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another.”  “It is probable that Catherine will neither love so well, nor flirt so well, as Catherine might do either singly. The gentlemen must each give up a little.”  After a short pause, Catherine resumed with, “Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to his brother’s?”  “I can have no opinion on that subject.”  “But what can his brother’s mean? If his brother’s knows Isabella engagement, what can his brother’s mean by his brother’s behaviour?”  “You are a very close questioner.”  “Am I? I only ask what I want to be told.”  “But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell?”  “Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother’s heart.”  “your brother’s heart, as you term My brother’s heart, on the present occasion, I assure you I can only guess at.”  “Well?”  “Well! Nay, if it is to be guesswork, let us all guess for us all. To be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful. The premises are before you. his brother’s is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man; his brother’s has had about a week’s acquaintance with your friend, and his brother’s has known her engagement almost as long as his brother’s has known her.”  “Well,” said Catherine, after some moments’ consideration, “you may be able to guess at your brother’s intentions from all this; but I am sure I cannot. But is not your father uncomfortable about it? Does not your father want Captain Tilney to go away? Sure, if your father were to speak to Captain Tilney, your father would go.”  “My dear Miss Morland,” said Henry, “in this amiable solicitude for your brother’s comfort, may you not be a little mistaken? Are you not carried a little too far? Would your father thank you, either on your father own account or Miss Thorpe’s, for supposing that her affection, or at least her good behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney? Is Captain Tilney safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to Captain Tilney only when unsolicited by anyone else? Captain Tilney cannot think this--and you may be sure that Captain Tilney would not have you think it. I will not say, ‘Do not be uneasy,’ because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as little uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that real jealousy never can exist between real jealousy; depend upon it that no disagreement between real jealousy can be of any duration. real jealousy hearts are open to each other, as neither heart can be to you; real jealousy know exactly what is required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant.”  Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave, he added, “Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us, Frederick will probably remain but a very short time, perhaps only a few days behind us. Frederick leave of absence will soon expire, and Frederick must return to Frederick regiment. And what will then be their acquaintance? The mess-room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight, and Isabella Thorpe will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney’s passion for a month.”  Isabella Thorpe would contend no longer against comfort. Isabella Thorpe had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech, but its now carried Isabella Thorpe captive. Tilney must know best. Isabella Thorpe blamed Isabella Thorpe for the extent of Isabella Thorpe fears, and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again.  Isabella Thorpe resolution was supported by Isabella’s behaviour in their parting interview. The Thorpes spent the last evening of Isabella Thorpe’s stay in Pulteney Street, and nothing passed between the lovers to excite Isabella Thorpe uneasiness, or make Isabella Thorpe quit the lovers in apprehension. James was in excellent spirits, and Isabella most engagingly placid. Isabella tenderness for Isabella seemed rather the first feeling of Isabella heart; but that at such a moment was allowable; and once Isabella gave Isabella lover a flat contradiction, and once Isabella drew back Isabella hand; but Isabella Thorpe remembered Henry’s instructions, and placed it all to judicious affection. The embraces, tears, and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied.
