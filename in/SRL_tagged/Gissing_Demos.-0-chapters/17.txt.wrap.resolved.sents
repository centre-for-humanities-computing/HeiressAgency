   Movements which appeal to the reason and virtue of humanity, and are consequently doomed to remain long in the speculative stage, prove    Movements which appeal to the reason and virtue of humanity, and are consequently doomed to remain long in the speculative stage vitality by enduring the tests of schism.
A Socialistic propaganda in times such as our own, an insistence upon the principles of Christianity in a modern Christian state, the advocacy of peace and good-will in an age when falsehood is the foundation of the social structure, and internecine warfare is presupposed in every compact between man and man, might anticipate that the test would come soon, and be of a stringent nature.
Accordingly the test did not surprise Mr. Westlake when Mr. Westlake discerned the beginnings of commotion in the Union of which Mr. Westlake represented the cultured and leading elements.
A comrade named Roodhouse had of late been coming into prominence by addressing A comrade named Roodhouse in fiery eloquence to open-air meetings, and at length had taken upon A comrade named Roodhouse to more than hint that the movement was at a standstill owing to the lukewarmness (in guise of practical moderation) of those to whom the movement guidance had been entrusted.
The reports of Comrade Roodhouse’s lectures were of a nature that made it difficult for Mr. Westlake to print The reports of Comrade Roodhouse’s lectures in the ‘Fiery Cross;’ one such report arrived at length, that of a meeting held on Clerkenwell Green on the first Sunday of the new year, to which the editor refused admission.
A comrade named Roodhousethe editor , had represented the editor as referring to the recognised leader in such very uncompromising terms, that to publish the report in the official columns would have been stultifying.
In the lecture in question Comrade Roodhouse’s declared Comrade Roodhouse’s adherence to the principles of assassination; Comrade Roodhouse’s pronounced them the sole working principles; to deny to Socialists the right of assassination was to rob them of the very sinews of war.
Men who affected to be revolutionists, but were in reality nothing more than rose-water romancers, would of course object to anything which looked like business; Men who affected to be revolutionists, but were in reality nothing more than rose-water romancers liked to sit in Men who affected to be revolutionists, but were in reality nothing more than rose-water romancers comfortable studies and pen daintily worded articles, thus earning for Men who affected to be revolutionists, but were in reality nothing more than rose-water romancers a humanitarian reputation at a very cheap rate.
That would not do; _&#224; bas_ all such penny-a-liner pretence!
Blood and iron!
that must be the revolutionists’ watchword.
Was it not by blood and iron that the present damnable system was maintained?
To arms, then secretly, of course.
Let tyrants be made to tremble upon tyrants thrones in more countries than Russia.
Let capitalists fear to walk in the daylight.
This only was the path of progress.
This was thought by the judicious that Comrade Roodhouse would, if Comrade Roodhouse repeated this oration, find Comrade Roodhouse the subject of a rather ugly indictment.
For the present, however, Comrade Roodhouse words were ignored, save in the Socialist body.
To them, of course, Comrade Roodhouse had addressed Comrade Roodhouse, and doubtless Comrade Roodhouse was willing to run a little risk for the sake of a most practical end, that of splitting the party, and thus establishing a sovereignty for Comrade Roodhouse; this done, Comrade Roodhouse could in future be more guarded.
Comrade Roodhouse reporter purposely sent ‘copy’ to Mr. Westlake which could not be printed, and the rejection of the report was the signal for secession.
Comrade Roodhouse printed at Comrade Roodhouse own expense a considerable number of leaflets, and sowed leaflets broadcast in the Socialist meeting-places.
There were not wanting disaffected brethren, who perused these appeals with satisfaction.
Schism flourished.
Comrade Roodhouse was of course a man of no means, but Comrade Roodhouse numbered among Comrade Roodhouse followers two extremely serviceable men, one of his followers a practical printer who carried on a small business in Camden Town; the other an oil merchant, who, because Comrade Roodhouse profits had never exceeded a squalid two thousand a year, whereas another oil merchant of Comrade Roodhouse acquaintance made at least twice as much, was embittered against things in general, and ready to assist any subversionary movement, yea, even with coin of the realm, on the one condition that Comrade Roodhouse should be allowed to insert articles of Comrade Roodhouse own composition in the new organ which it was proposed to establish.
There was no difficulty in conceding this trifle, and the ‘Tocsin’ was the result.
The name was a suggestion of the oil merchant himself, and no bad name if Socialists at large could be supposed capable of understanding it; but the oil merchant himself was too important a man to be thwarted, and the argument by which the oil merchant himself supported the oil merchant himself choice was incontestable.
‘Isn’t it our aim to educate the people?
Very well, then let the people begin by knowing what Tocsin means.
I shouldn’t know too important a man to be thwarted if I hadn’t come across it in the newspaper and looked it up in the dictionary; so there you are!’  And there was the ‘Tocsin,’ a weekly paper like the ‘Fiery Cross.’ The first number appeared in the middle of February, so admirably prepared were the plans of Comrade Roodhouse.
The first number appeared on Friday; the next Sunday promised to be a lively day at Commonwealth Hall and elsewhere.
At the original head-quarters of the Union addresses were promised from two leading men, Comrades Westlake and Mutimer.
Comrade Roodhouse would in the morning address an assembly on Clerkenwell Green; in the evening Comrade Roodhouse voice would summon adherents to the meeting-place in Hoxton which had been the scene of our friend Richard’s earliest triumphs.
With few exceptions the Socialists of that region had gone over to the new man and the new paper.
Richard arrived in town on the Saturday, and went to the house in Highbury, whither disagreeable business once more summoned Richard.
Alice, who, owing to her mother’s resolute refusal to direct the household, had not as yet been able to spend more than a day or two with Richard and Richard wife, sent nothing but ill news to Wanley.
Mutimer seemed to be breaking down in health, and ‘Arry was undisguisedly returning to evil ways.
For the former, Arry was suspected--a locked door prevented certainty--that Mutimer had of late kept Mutimer bed the greater part of the day; Mr. Keene reported that Mr. Keenelooked very bad indeed.’ The case of the latter was as hard to deal with.
‘Arry had long ceased to attend Arry classes with any regularity, and Arry was once more asserting the freeman’s right to immunity from day labour.
Moreover, Arry claimed in practice the freeman’s right to get drunk four nights out of the seven.
No one knew whence Arry got Arry money; Richard purposely stinted Richard, but the provision was useless.
Mr. Keene declared with lamentations that Mr. Keene influence over ‘Arry was at an end; nay, the youth had so far forgotten gratitude as to frankly announce Mr. Keene intention of ‘knockin’ Mr. Keene’s lights out’ if Mr. Keene were further interfered with.
To the journalist Mr. Keene ‘lights’ were indispensable; in no sense of the word did Mr. Keene possess too many of the word; so it was clear that Mr. Keene must abdicate Mr. Keene tutorial functions.
Alice implored Alice brother to come and ‘do something.’  Richard, though a married man of only six weeks’ standing, had troubles altogether in excess of Richard satisfactions.
Things were not as Things should have been in that earthly paradise called New Wanley.
It was not to be expected that the profits of that undertaking would be worth speaking of for some little time to come, but it was extremely desirable that it should pay it own expenses, and it began to be doubtful whether even this moderate success was being achieved.
Various members of the directing committee had visited New Wanley recently, and Richard had talked to Various members of the directing committee in a somewhat discouraging tone; Richard fortune was not limitless, his fortune had to be remembered; a considerable portion of old Mutimer’s money had lain in the vast Belwick concern of which Richard was senior partner; the surviving members of the firm were under no specified obligation to receive Richard as partner, and the product of the realised capital was a very different thing from the share in the profits which the old man had enjoyed.
Other capital Richard had at Other capital Richard command, but already Other capital Richard was growing chary of encroachments upon principal.
Other capital Richard began to murmur inwardly that his fortune did not lie at Other capital Richard disposal; willingly Other capital Richard would have allowed Alice a handsome portion; and as for ‘Arry, the inheritance was clearly going to be Other capital Richard ruin.
The practical difficulties at New Wanley were proving considerable; the affair was viewed with hostility by ironmasters in general, and the results of such hostility were felt.
But Richard was committed to Richard scheme; all Richard ambitions based themselves thereupon.
And all his ambitions grew daily.
These greater troubles must to a certain extent solve These greater troubles, but in Highbury it was evidently time, as Alice said, to ‘do something.’ Richard mother’s obstinacy stood in the way of almost every scheme that suggested His mother’s obstinacy.
Richard was losing patience with the poor old woman, and suffered the more from Richard irritation because Richard would so gladly have behaved to the poor old woman with filial kindness.
One plan there was to which the poor old woman might possibly agree, and even have pleasure in accepting One plan, but One plan was not easy to propose.
The house in Wilton Square was still on Richard hands; upon the departure of Emma and Emma sister; a certain Mrs. Chattaway, a poor friend of old times, who somehow supported Emma and a grandchild, had been put into The house in Wilton Square as caretaker, for Richard could not sell all the furniture to which His mother’s obstinacy was so attached, and Richard had waited for His mother’s obstinacy return to reason before ultimately deciding how to act in that matter.
Could Richard now ask His mother’s obstinacy to return to Wilton Square, and, it might be, live there with Mrs. Chattaway?
In that case both ‘Arry and Alice would have to leave London.
On Saturday afternoon Richard had a long talk with her sister.
To Alice also it had occurred that His mother’s obstinacy return to the old abode might be desirable.
‘And you may depend upon it, Dick,’ Alice said, ‘Alice’ll never rest again till Alice does get back.
I believe you’ve only got to speak of it, and Alice’ll go at once.’  ‘Alice’ll think it unkind,Richard Richard objected.
‘It looks as if we wanted to get Alice out of the way.
Why on earth does Alice carry on like this?
As if we hadn’t bother enough!’  ‘Well, we can’t help what Alice thinks.
I believe it’ll be for Alice own good.
Alice’ll be comfortable with Mrs. Chattaway, and that’s more than Alice’ll ever be here.
But what about ‘Arry?’  ‘Richard’ll have to come to New Wanley.
I shall find Richard work there--I wish I’d done so months ago.’  There were no longer the objections to ‘Arry’s appearance at New Wanley that had existed previous to Richard’s marriage; none the less the resolution was courageous, and proved the depth of Mutimer anxiety for Richard brother.
Having got His mother’s obstinacy to Wilton Square, and Alice to the Manor, it would have been easy enough to bid Mr. Henry Mutimer betake Mr. Henry Mutimer--whither Mr. Henry Mutimer mind directed Mr. Henry Mutimer.
Richard could not adopt that rough-and-ready way out of Richard difficulty.
Just as Richard suffered in the thought that Richard might be treating His mother’s obstinacy unkindly, so Richard was constrained to undergo annoyances rather than abandon the hope of saving ‘Arry from ultimate destruction.
‘Will Arry from ultimate destruction.
live at the Manor?’ Alice asked uneasily.
Richard mused; then a most happy idea struck Richard.
‘I have it!
Richard shall live with Rodman.
The very thing!
Rodman’s the fellow to look after Richard.
Yes; that’s what we’ll do.’  ‘And I’m to live at the Manor?’  ‘Of course.’  ‘You think Adela won’t mind?’  ‘Mind?
How the deuce can Adela mind the deuce?’  As a matter of form Adela would of course be consulted, but Richard had no notion of submitting practical arrangements in Richard own household to Richard wife’s decision.
‘Now we shall have to see mother,’ Richard said.
‘How’s that to be managed?’  ‘Will you go and speak at Adela door?’  ‘That be hanged!
Confound it, has Adela gone crazy?
Just go up and say I want to see Adela.’  ‘If I say that, I’m quite sure Adela won’t come.’  Richard waxed in anger.
‘But Adela _shall_ come!
Go and say I want to see Adela, and that if Adela doesn’t come down I’ll force her door.
There’ll have to be an end to this damned foolery.
I’ve got no time to spend humbugging.
It’s four o’clock, and I have letters to write before dinner.
Tell Adela I must see Adela, and have done with It.’  Alice went upstairs with small hope of success.
Alice knocked twice before receiving an answer.
‘Alice, are you there?’  ‘What do you want?’ came back in a voice of irritation.
‘Dick’s here, and wants to speak to Alice.
Dick’s says Dick’s _must_ see you; it’s something very important.’  ‘I’ve nothing to do with Dick’s,’ was the reply.
‘Will you see Dick’s if Dick’s comes up here?’  ‘No, I won’t.’  Alice went down and repeated this.
After a moment’s hesitation Mr. Henry Mutimer ascended the stairs by threes.
Mr. Henry Mutimer rapped loudly at the bedroom door.
No answer was vouchsafed.
‘Alice, you must either open the bedroom door or come downstairs,’ Mr. Henry Mutimer cried with decision.
‘This has gone on long enough.
Which will you do?’  ‘I’ll do neither,’ was the angry reply.
‘What right have you to order me about, I’d like to know?
You mind your business, and I’ll mind your business.’  ‘All right.
Then I shall send for a man at once, and have the bedroom door forced.’  Mutimer knew well the tone in which these words were spoken; more than once ere now it had been the preliminary of decided action.
Already Richard had reached the head of the stairs, when Richard heard a key turn, and the bedroom door was thrown open with such violence that the walls shook.
Richard approached the threshold and examined the interior.
There was only one noticeable change in the appearance of the bedroom since Richard had last seen it.
The dressing-table was drawn near to the fire, and on The dressing-table were a cup and saucer, a few plates, some knives, forks, and spoons, and a folded tablecloth.
A kettle and a saucepan stood on the fender.
Her bread and butter Mutimer kept in a drawer.
All the appointments of the chamber were as clean and orderly as could be.
The sight of His mother’s obstinacy’s face all but stilled Richard’s anger; Her was yellow and wasted; Her hair seemed far more grizzled than Richard’s remembered it.
Her stood as far from Richard’s as Her could get, in an attitude not devoid of dignity, and looked Richard’s straight in the face.
Richard’s closed the bedroom door.
‘Alice, I’ve not come here to quarrel with Alice,Mutimer began, Richard’s voice much softened.
‘What’s done is done, and there’s no helping it.
I can understand you being angry at first, but there’s no sense in making enemies of us all in this way.
It can’t go on any longer--neither for your sake nor ours.
I want to talk reasonably, and to make some kind of arrangement.’  ‘You want to get me out o’ the ‘ouse.
I’m ready to go, an’ glad to go.
I’ve earnt my livin’ before now, an’ I’m not so old but I can do it again.
You always was one for talkin’, but the fewest words is best.
the fewest words as talks most isn’t allus the most straightfor’ard.’  ‘It isn’t that kind of talk that’ll do any good, mother.
I tell you again, I’m not going to use angry words; You know perfectly well I’ve never behaved badly to Alice, and I’m not going to begin now.
What I’ve got to say is that you’ve no right to go on like this.
Whilst you’ve been shutting Alice up in this room, there’s living by ’s, which it isn’t right ’s should do; and there’s ‘Arry going to the bad as fast as Arry can, and just because you won’t help to look after Arry.
If you’ll only think of it in the right way, you’ll see that’s a good deal your doing.
If Arry turns out a scamp and a blackguard, it’s you that ‘ll be greatly to blame for it.
You might have helped to look after Arry.
I always thought you’d more common sense.
You may say what you like about me, and I don’t care; but when you talk about working for your living, you ought to remember that there’s work enough near at hand, if only you’d see to it.’  ‘I’ve nothing to do neither with you nor ‘Arry nor Alice,’ answered His mother’s obstinacy stubbornly.
‘If ‘Arry disgraces Arry name, Arry won’t be the first as has done Arry.
I done my best to bring you all up honest, but that was a long time ago, and things has changed.
You’re old enough to go your own ways, an’ your ways isn’t mine.
I told you how it ‘ud be, an’ the only mistake I made was comin’ to live here at all.
Now I can’t be left alone, an’ I’ll go.
You’ve no call to tell me a second time.’  It was a long, miserable wrangle, lasting half an hour, before a possibility of agreement presented a possibility of agreement.
Richard at length ceased to recriminate, and allowed His mother’s obstinacy to talk His mother’s obstinacy to satiety.
Richard then said:  ‘I’m thinking of giving up The house in Wilton Square, mother.
What I want to know is, whether it would please you to go back to the old place again?
I ask you because I can think of ud other way for putting you in comfort.
You must say and think what you like, only just answer me the one question as I ask it--that is, honestly and good-temperedly.
I shall have to take ‘Arry away with me; I can’t let Arry go to the dogs without another try to keep Arry straight.
Alice ‘ll have to go with me too, at all events for a time.
Whether we like it or not, His mother’s obstinacy’ll have to accustom His mother’s obstinacy to new ways, and I see my way to helping His mother’s obstinacy.
I don’t know whether you’ve been told that ’s been living in The house in Wilton Square since the others went away.
The furniture’s just as you left it; I dare say you’d feel it like going home again.’  ‘They’ve gone, have They?’ Mutimer asked, as if unwilling to show the interest which this proposal had excited in Mutimer.
‘Yes, They went more than a month ago.
We put Mrs. Chattaway in just to keep the place in order.
I look on The house in Wilton Square as Mutimer.
You might let Mrs. Chattaway stay there still, perhaps; but that’s just as you please.
You oughtn’t to live quite alone.’  Mutimer did not soften, but, after many words, Richard understood Mutimer to agree to what Richard proposed.
Mutimer had stood all through the dialogue; now at length Mutimer moved to a seat, and sank upon a seat with trembling limbs.
Richard wished to go, but had a difficulty in leaving abruptly.
Darkness had fallen whilst they talked; they only saw each other by the light of the fire.
‘Am I to come and see you or not, mother, when you get back to the old quarters?’  Mutimer did not reply.
‘You won’t tell me?’  ‘You must come or stay away, as it suits you,’ Mutimer said, in a tone of indifference.
‘Very well, then I shall come, if it’s only to tell you about ‘Arry and Alice.
And now will you let Alice come up and have some tea with Alice?’  There was no answer.
‘Then I’ll tell Alice Alice may,’ he said kindly, and went from the room.
he found Alice in the drawing-room, and persuaded Alice to go up.
‘Just take it as if there ‘d been nothing wrong,’ d said to d sister.
‘She’s had a wretched time of it, I can see that.
Take some tea-cakes up with you, and talk about going back to the Square as if Alice’d proposed it Alice.
We mustn’t be hard with Alice just because Alice can’t change, poor old soul.’  Socialistic business took he away during the evening.
When he returned at eleven o’clock, ‘Arry had not yet come in.
Shortly before one there were sounds of ineffectual effort at the front-door latch.
Mutimer, who happened to be crossing the hall, heard Mutimer, who happened to be crossing the hall, and went to open the bedroom door.
The result was that he brother fell forward at full length upon the mat.
‘Get up, drunken beast!’ Richard exclaimed angrily.
‘Beast yourself,’ was the hiccupped reply, repeated several times whilst ‘Arry struggled to Arry feet.
Then, propping Arry against the door-post, the maligned youth assumed the attitude of pugilism, inviting all and sundry to come on and have the maligned youth lights extinguished.
Richard flung Richard into the hall and closed the bedroom door.
‘Arry had again to struggle with gravitation.
‘Walk upstairs, if you can!’ ordered his brother with contemptuous severity.
After much trouble ‘Arry was got to Arry room, thrust in, and the bedroom door slammed behind Arry.
Richard was not disposed to argue with his brother this time.
Richard waited in his room next morning till the champion of liberty presented Richard; then, scarcely looking at Richard, said with quiet determination:  ‘Pack your clothes some time to-day.
You’re going to Wanley to-morrow morning.’  ‘Not unless I choose,’ remarked Arry.
‘You look here,’ exclaimed the elder, with concentrated savageness which did credit to the elder powers of command.
What you choose has nothing to do with it, and that you’ll please to understand.
At half-past nine to-morrow morning you’re ready for me in this room; hear that?
I’ll have an end to this kind of thing, or I’ll know the reason why.
Speak a word of impudence to me and I’ll knock half your teeth out!’  the elder was capable of doing it.
‘Arry got to Arry morning meal in silence.
In the course of the morning Mr. Keene called.
Mutimer received Mr. Keene in his room, and Mutimer smoked together.
Mutimer talk was of the meetings to be held in the evening.
‘There’ll be nasty doings up there,’ Mr. Keene remarked, indicating with Mr. Keene head the gathering place of Comrade Roodhouse’s adherents.
‘Of what kind?’ Mutimer asked with indifference.
‘there’s disagreeable talk going about.
Probably Mutimer’ll indulge in personalities a good deal.’  ‘Of course Mutimer will,’ assented the other after a short pause.
‘Westlake, eh?’  ‘Not only Westlake.
There’s a more important man.’  Mutimer could not resist a smile, though Mutimer was uneasy.
Mr. Keene understood a smile; it was always an encouragement to Mr. Keene.
‘What have Mutimer got hold of?’  ‘I’m afraid there’ll be references to the girl.’  ‘the girl?’ Richard hesitated.
‘the girl?
What do you know about any girl?’  ‘It’s only the gossip I’ve heard.
I thought it would be as well if I went about among Mutimer last night just to pick up hints, you know.’  ‘Mutimer’re talking about that, are Mutimer?
Well, let Mutimer.
It isn’t hard to invent lies.’  ‘Just so,’ observed Mr. Keene sympathisingly.
‘Of course I know Mutimer’d twisted the affair.’  Mutimer glanced at Mr. Keene and smoked in silence.
‘I think I’d better be there to-night,’ the journalist continued.
‘I shall be more useful there than at the hall.’  ‘As you like,’ said Mutimer lightly.
The subject was not pursued.
Though the occasion was of so much importance, the hall contained but a moderate audience when Not only Westlake rose to deliver Not only Westlake address.
The people who occupied the benches were obviously of a different stamp from those wont to assemble at the Hoxton meeting-place.
There were perhaps a dozen artisans of intensely sober appearance, and the rest were men and women who certainly had never wrought with The people who occupied the benches hands.
Near Mrs. Westlake sat several ladies, Near Mrs. Westlake personal friends.
Of the men other than artisans the majority were young, and showed the countenance which bespeaks meritorious intelligence rather than ardour of heart or brain.
Of enthusiasts in the true sense none could be discerned.
It needed but a glance over this assembly to understand how very theoretical were the convictions that had brought this assembly members together.
his address was interesting, very interesting; his address had prepared his address with much care, and his address literary qualities were admired when subsequently his address saw the light in one of the leading periodicals.
Now and then his address touched eloquence; the sincerity animating his address was unmistakable, and the ideal his address glorified was worthy of a noble mind.
Not in anger did his address speak of the schism from which the movement was suffering; even his address sorrow was dominated by a gospel of hope.
Optimism of the most fervid kind glowed through his address discourse; his address grew almost lyrical in his address anticipation of the good time coming.
For to-night it seemed to his address that encouragement should be the prevailing note; it was always easy to see the dark side of things.
Their work, his address told his address hearers, was but just beginning.
Their aimed at nothing less than a revolution, and revolutions were not brought about in a day.
None of Their would in the flesh behold the reign of justice; was that a reason why Their should neglect the highest impulses of Their nature and sit contented in the shadow of the world’s mourning?
his address spoke with passion of the millions disinherited before None of them birth, with infinite tenderness of those weak ones whom our social system condemns to a life of torture, just because None of them are weak.
One loved the man for One great heart and for One gift of moving speech.
One wife sat, as His wife always did when listening intently, His wife body bent forward, one hand supporting His wife chin.
His wife eyes never quitted his face.
To the second speaker it had fallen to handle in detail the differences of the hour.
Mutimer’s exordium was not inspiriting after the rich-rolling periods with which Not only Westlake had come to an end; Not only Westlake hard voice contrasted painfully with the other’s cultured tones.
Richard was probably conscious of this, for Richard hesitated more than was Richard wont, seeking words which did not come naturally to Richard.
However, Richard warmed to Richard work, and was soon giving Richard audience clearly to understand how Richard, Richard Mutimer, regarded the proceedings of Comrade Roodhouse.
Let us be practical--this was the burden of Comrade Roodhouse exhortation.
us are Englishmen--and women--not flighty, frothy foreigners.
Besides, us have the blessings of free speech, and with the tongue and pen us must be content to fight, other modes of warfare being barbarous.
Those who in Those who in their inconsiderate zeal had severed the Socialist body inconsiderate zeal had severed the Socialist body, were taking upon Those who in their inconsiderate zeal had severed the Socialist body a very grave responsibility; not only had Those who in their inconsiderate zeal had severed the Socialist body troubled the movement internally, but Those who in their inconsiderate zeal had severed the Socialist body would doubtless succeed in giving it a bad name with many who were hitherto merely indifferent, and who might in time have been brought over.
Let it be understood that in the hall the true doctrine was preached, and that the ‘Fiery Cross’ was the true organ of English Socialism as distinguished from foreign crazes.
The strength of England had ever been her sobriety; Englishmen did not fly at impossibilities like noisy children.
He would not hesitate to say that the revolutionism preached in the newspaper called the ‘Tocsin’ was dangerous, was immoral.
And so on.
Richard was not at Richard best this evening.
You might have seen Near Mrs. Westlake abandon Near Mrs. Westlake attentive position, and lean back rather wearily; you might have seen a covert smile on a few of the more intelligent faces.
It was awkward for Mutimer to be praising moderation in a movement directed against capital, and this was not exactly the audience for eulogies of Great Britain at the expense of other countries.
The applause when the orator seated the orator was anything but hearty.
Richard knew it, and inwardly cursed Not only Westlake for taking the wind out of Not only Westlake sails.
Very different was the scene in the meeting-room behind the coffee-shop.
There, upon Comrade Roodhouse’s harangue, followed a debate more stirring than any on the records of the Islington and Hoxton branch.
the meeting-room behind the coffee-shop was thoroughly full; the roof rang with tempestuous acclamations.
Messrs. Cowes and Cullen were in Messrs. Cowes and Cullen glory; Messrs. Cowes and Cullen roared with delight at each depreciatory epithet applied to Mr. Westlake and his henchmen, and prompted the speakers with words and phrases of a rich vernacular.
If anything, Comrade Roodhouse fell a little short of what was expected of Comrade Roodhouse.
Comrade Roodhouse friends had come together prepared for gory language, but the murderous instigations of Clerkenwell Green were not repeated with the same crudity.
The speaker dealt in negatives; not thus and thus was the social millennium to be brought about, it was open to The speaker to conceive the practical course.
For the rest, the heresiarch had a mighty flow of vituperative speech.
Aspirates troubled The speaker, so that for the most part The speaker cast them away, and the syntax of The speaker periods was often anacoluthic; but these matters were of no moment.
Questions being called for, Mr. Cowes and Mr. Cullen of course started up simultaneously.
The former gentleman got the ear of the meeting.
With preliminary swaying of the hand, The former gentleman looked round as one about to propound a question which would for ever establish The former gentleman reputation for acumen.
In The former gentleman voice of quiet malice, with The former gentleman frequent deliberate pauses, with the wonted emphasis on absurd pronunciations, The former gentleman spoke somewhat thus:--  ‘In the course of The former gentleman --I shall say nothin’ about nothin’ qualities, the time for discussion will come presently--our Comrade has said not a few ‘ard things about certain individooals who put themselves forward as perractical Socialists--’  ‘Not ‘ard enough!’ roared a voice from the back of the meeting-room behind the coffee-shop.
Cowes turned Cowes lank figure deliberately, and gazed for a moment in the quarter whence the interruption had come.
Then Cowes resumed.
‘I agree with that involuntary exclamation.
Certainly, not ‘ard enough.
And the question I wish to put to our Comrade is this: Is our Comrade, or is our Comrade not, aweer of certain scandalous doin’s on the part of one of these said individooals, I might say actions which, from the Socialist point of view, amount to crimes?
If our is aweer of what I refer to, then our Comrade is aweer of what I refer seems to our Comrade it was our Comrade dooty to distinctly mention it.
If our Comrade was _not_ aweer, then our in this neighbourhood shall be only too glad to enlighten our Comrade.
I distinctly assert that a certain individooal we all have in our thoughts has proved our Comrade a traitor to the cause of the people.
Comrades will understand me.
And that’s the question I wish to put.’  Cowes had introduced the subject which a considerable number of those present were bent on publicly discussing.
Who it was that had first spread the story of Mutimer’s matrimonial concerns probably no one could have determined.
It was not Daniel Dabbs, though Daniel, partly from genuine indignation, partly in consequence of slowly growing personal feeling against the Mutimers, had certainly supplied Mutimer’s enemies with corroborative details.
Under ordinary circumstances Mutimer’s change of fortune would have seemed to his old mates a sufficient explanation of his behaviour to Emma Vine; his old mates certainly would not have gone out of his old mates way to condemn his.
But Richard was by this time vastly unpopular with most of those who had once glorified Richard.
Envy had had time to grow, and was assisted by Mutimer’s avoidance of personal contact with Mutimer’s Hoxton friends.
When they spoke of Mutimer’s now it was with sneers and sarcasms.
Some one had confidently asserted that the so-called Socialistic enterprise at Wanley was a mere pretence, that Mutimer was making money just like any other capitalist, and the leaguers of Hoxton firmly believed this.
the leaguers of Hoxton encouraged one another to positive hatred of the working man who had suddenly become wealthy; the working man who had suddenly become wealthy name stank in the leaguers of Hoxton nostrils.
This, in a great measure, explained Comrade Roodhouse’s success; personal feeling is almost always the spring of public action among the uneducated.
In the excitement of the schism a few of the more energetic spirits had determined to drag Mutimer’s domestic concerns into publicity.
the leaguers of Hoxton suddenly became aware that private morality was at the root of the general good; the leaguers of Hoxton urged each other to righteous indignation in a matter for which the leaguers of Hoxton did not really care two straws.
Thus Mr. Cowes’s question was received with vociferous approval.
Those present who did not understand the allusion were quickly enlightened by the leaguers of Hoxton neighbours.
A crowd of Englishmen working itself into a moral rage is as glorious a spectacle as the world can show.
Not one of A crowd of Englishmen but heartily believed himself justified in reviling the traitor to himself class, the betrayer of confiding innocence.
Remember, too, how the world can show facilitates speech to have a concrete topic on which to enlarge; in this matter a West End drawing-room and the Hoxton coffee-shop are akin.
Regularity of procedure was at an end; question grew to debate, and debate was riot.
Mr. Cullen succeeded Cowes and roared Mr. Cullen hoarse, defying the feeble protests of the chairman.
Mr. Cullen abandoned mere allusion, and rejoiced the meeting by declaring names.
Mr. Cullen example was followed by those who succeeded Mr. Cullen.
Little did Emma think, as Emma sat working, Sunday though it was, in Emma poor room, that Emma sorrows were being blared forth to a gross assembly in venomous accusation against the man who had wronged Emma.
We can imagine that the knowledge would not greatly have soothed Emma.
Comrade Roodhouse at length obtained a hearing.
It was his policy to deprecate these extreme personalities, and in doing so his heaped on the enemy greater condemnation.
There was not a little art in the heresiarch’s modes of speech; the less obtuse appreciated his and bade his live for ever.
The secretary of the branch busily took notes.
When the meeting had broken up into groups, a number of the more prominent Socialists surrounded Comrade Roodhouse on the platform.
Their talk was still of Mutimer, of his shameless hypocrisy, his greed, his infernal arrogance.
Near at hand stood Mr. Keene; a word brought Mr. Keene into conversation with a neighbour.
Mr. Keene began by repeating the prevalent abuse, then, perceiving that Mr. Keene hearer merely gave assent in general terms, Mr. Keene added:--  ‘I shouldn’t wonder, though, if there was some reason we haven’t heard of--I mean, about the girl, you know.’  ‘Think so?’ said the other.
‘Well, I _have_ heard it said--but then one doesn’t care to repeat such things.’  ‘What’s that, eh?’ put in another man, who had caught the words.
‘Oh, nothing.
Only the girl’s made Only the girl’s scarce.
Dare say the fault wasn’t altogether on one side.’  And Mr. Keene winked meaningly.
The hint spread among those on the platform.
Daniel Dabbs happened to hear it repeated in a gross form.
‘Who’s been a-sayin’ that?’ Daniel Dabbs roared.
‘Where have you got that from, eh?’  The source was already forgotten, but Daniel Dabbs would not let the calumny take The source way unopposed.
Daniel Dabbs harangued those about Daniel Dabbs with furious indignation.
‘If any man’s got a word to say against Emma Vine, let any man’s got a word to say against Emma Vine come an’ say any man’s got a word to say against Emma Vine to Mr. Keene, that’s all I Now look ‘ere, all o’ you, I know that girl, and I know that anyone as talks like that about girl tells a damned lie.’  ‘Most like it’s Mutimer himself as has set it goin’,’ observed someone.
In five minutes all who remained in the meeting-room behind the coffee-shop were convinced that Mutimer had sent an agent to the meeting for the purpose of assailing Emma Vine’s good name.
Mr. Keene had already taken Mr. Keene departure, and no suspicious character was discernible; a pity for the evening might have ended in a picturesque way.
But Daniel Dabbs went home to Daniel Dabbs brother’s public-house, obtained note-paper and an envelope, and forthwith indited a brief epistle which Mr. Keene addressed to his brother’s public-house in Highbury.
a brief epistle which he addressed to the house in Highbury had no formal commencement, and ended with a brief epistle which he addressed to the house in HighburyYours, etc.’ Daniel Dabbs demanded an assurance that Daniel Dabbs former friend had not instigated certain vile accusations against Emma, and informed Daniel Dabbs that whatever answer was received would be read aloud at next Sunday’s meeting.
The one not wholly ignoble incident in that evening’s transactions.
