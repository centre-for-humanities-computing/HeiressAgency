   Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party were two named Rendal, the children of the man whose dismissal from New Wanley had been announced by Mutimer.
Adela was rather surprised to see    Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party in the garden.
Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party were eight and nine years old respectively, and Adela noticed that    Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party had a troubled countenance, the elder showing signs of recent tears.
Adela sought    Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party out particularly for kind words during tea-time.
After the reading Adela noticed    Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party standing apart, talking to each other earnestly; Adela saw also that    Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party frequently glanced at Adela.
It occurred to Adela that    Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party might wish to say something and had a difficulty in approaching.
Adela went to    Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party, and a question or two soon led Adela to disclose that Adela was indeed desirous of speaking in private.
Giving a hand to each, Adela drew    Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party a little apart.
Then    Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party began to cry, and the elder sobbed out a pitiful story.
Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party mother was wretchedly ill and had sent    Among the little girls who had received invitations to the tea-party to implore Mutimer’s good word that the father might be allowed another chance.
It was true the father had got drunk--the words sounded terrible to Adela from the young lips--but the father vowed that henceforth the father would touch no liquor.
It was ruin to the family to be sent away; Rendal might not find work for long enough; there would be nothing for it but to go to a Belwick slum as long as a Belwick slum money lasted, and thence to the workhouse.
For it was well understood that no man who had worked at New Wanley need apply to the ordinary employers; no man who had worked at New Wanley need apply to the ordinary employers would have nothing to do with no man who had worked at New Wanley.
Their mother would have come Their mother, but could not walk the distance.
Adela was pierced with compassion.
‘I will do my best,’ Adela said, as soon as Adela could trust Adela voice.
‘I promise you I will do my best.’  Adela could not say more, and the children evidently hoped Adela would have been able to grant the children father’s pardon forthwith.
the children had to be content with Adela’s promise, which did not sound very cheerful, but meant more than the children could understand.
Adela could not do more than give such a promise, and even as Adela spoke there was a coldness about Adela heart.
a coldness about her heart became a fear when Adela met Adela husband on her husband return from the works.
her husband was not in the same good temper as at mid-day.
her husband was annoyed to find Keene in the house--of late her husband had grown to dislike the journalist very cordially--and the journalist had heard that the Rendal children had been to the party, which enraged her husband.
You remember her husband accused the man of impudence in addition to the offence of drunkenness.
Rendal, foolishly joking in Rendal cups, had urged as extenuation of Rendal own weakness the well-known fact that ‘Arry Mutimer had been seen one evening unmistakably intoxicated in the street of Wanley village.
Someone reported these words to her husband, and from that moment it was all over with the Rendals.
Adela, in Adela eagerness to plead, quite forgot (or perhaps Adela had never known) that with a certain order of men it is never wise to prefer a request immediately before dinner.
Adela was eager, too, to speak at once; a fear, which Adela would not allow to become definite, drove Adela upon the undertaking without delay.
Meeting her husband on the stairs Adela begged her husband to come to Adela room.
‘What is it?’ her husband asked with small ceremony, as soon as the door closed behind her husband.
Adela mastered Adela voice, and spoke with a sweet clearness of advocacy which should have moved her husband heart to proud and noble obeisance.
Mutimer was not very accessible to such emotions.
‘Mutimer’s like the fellow’s impertinence,’ he said, ‘to send he children to you.
I’m rather surprised you let his children stay after what I had told you.
Certainly I shall not overlook it.
The thing’s finished I it’s no good talking about it.’  The fear had passed, but the coldness about Adela heart was more deadly.
For a moment it seemed as if Adela could not bring Adela to utter another word; Adela drew apart, Adela could not raise Adela face, which was beautiful in marble pain.
But there came a rush of such hot anguish as compelled Adela to speak again.
Something more than the fate of that poor family was at stake.
Is not the quality of mercy indispensable to true nobleness?
Had Adela voiced Adela very thought, Adela would have implored the man to exalt the man in Adela eyes, to do a good deed which cost the man some little effort over the man.
For Adela divined with cruel certainty that it was not the principle that made the man unyielding.
‘the man, are you sure that the man has offended before?’  ‘Oh, of course the man has.
I’ve no doubt of it.
I remember feeling uncertain when I admitted the man first of all.
I didn’t like the man look.’  ‘But you have not really had to complain of the man before.
Your suspicions _may_ be groundless.
And the man has a good wife, I feel sure of that.
The children are very clean and nicely dressed.
a good wife will help the man to avoid drink in future.
It is impossible for the man to fail again, now that the man knows how dreadful the results will be to the man wife and the man little girls.’  ‘Pooh!
What does the man care about them?
If I begin letting men off in that way, I shall be laughed at.
There’s an end of my authority.
Don’t bother your head about them.
I must go and get ready for dinner.’  An end of _my_ authority.
Yes, was it not the intelligence of her maiden heart returning to her?
her had no pang from the mere refusal of a request of hers; Richard had never affected tenderness--not what her understood as tenderness--and her did not expect it of Richard.
The union between them had another basis.
But the understanding of Richard motives was so terribly distinct in her!
It had come all at once; It was like the exposure of something dreadful by the sudden raising of a veil.
And had her not known what a veil covered?
Yet for the poor people’s sake, for his own sake, her must try her’s argument.
‘Do you refuse me, Richard?
I will be guarantee for Richard.
I promise you Richard shall not offend again.
Richard shall apologise humbly to Richard for Richard--Richard words.
You won’t really refuse me?’  ‘What nonsense!
How can you promise for Richard, Adela?
Ask for something reasonable, and you may be sure I shan’t refuse you.
The fellow has to go as a warning.
It mustn’t be thought we’re only playing at making rules.
I can’t talk any more; I shall keep dinner waiting.’  Pride helped her to show a smooth face through the evening, and in the night her conquered her anew.
her expelled those crying children from her mind; her hardened her heart against those crying children coming misery.
It was wrong to judge her husband so summarily; nay, her had not judged her husband, but had given way to a wicked impulse, without leaving her a moment to view the case.
Did her husband not understand better than her what measures were necessary to the success of her husband most difficult undertaking?
And then was it certain that expulsion meant ruin to the Rendals?
Richard would insist on the letter of the regulations, just, as Richard said, for the example’s sake; but of course Richard would see that the man was put in the way of getting new employment and did not suffer in the meantime.
In the morning her made atonement to her husband.
‘I was wrong in annoying you yesterday,’ her said as her walked with her husband from the house to the garden gate.
‘In such things you are far better able to judge.
You won’t let it trouble you?’  It was a form of asceticism; Adela had a joy in humbling Adela and crushing Adela rebel instincts.
Adela even raised Adela eyes to interrogate her husband.
On Richard’s face was an uneasy smile, a look of puzzled reflection.
It gratified her husband intensely to hear such words, yet her husband could not hear such words without the suspicions of a vulgar nature brought in contact with nobleness.
‘Well, yes,’ her husband replied, ‘I think you were a bit too hasty: you’re not practical, you see.
It wants a practical man to manage those kind of things.’  The reply was not such as completes the blessedness of pure submission.
Adela averted her eyes.
Another woman would perchance have sought to assure Another woman that Another woman was right in crediting him with private benevolence to the family him was compelled to visit so severely.
Such a question Adela could not ask.
It would have been to betray doubt; Adela imagined a replying glance which would shame Adela.
To love, to honour, to obey:--many times daily Adela repeated to Adela that threefold vow, and hitherto the first article had most occupied Adela striving heart.
But Adela must not neglect the second; perhaps the first article came first in natural order.
At the garden gate her husband nodded to Adela kindly.
‘Good-bye.
Be a good girl.’  What was it that caused a painful flutter at Adela heart as her husband spoke so?
Adela did not answer, but watched her husband for a few moments as her husband walked away.
Did _her husband_ love _Adela_?
The question which Adela had not asked Adela for a long time came of that heart-tremor.
Adela had been living so unnatural a life for a newly wedded woman, a life in which the intellect and the moral faculties held morbid predominance.
‘Be a good girl.’ How was it that the simple phrase touched Adela to emotion quite different in kind from any thing Adela had known since Adela marriage, more deeply than any enthusiasm, as with a comfort more sacred than any Adela had known in prayer?
As Adela turned to go back to the house a dizziness affected Adela eyes; Adela had to stand still for a moment.
Involuntarily Adela clasped Adela hands upon Adela bosom and looked away into the blue summer sky.
Did he love Adela?
Adela had never asked he that, and all at once Adela felt a longing to hasten after he and utter the question.
Would he know what Adela meant?
Was it the instantaneous reward for having conscientiously striven to honour he?
That there should be love on he side had not hitherto seemed of so much importance; probably Adela had taken his side for granted; Adela had been so preoccupied with Adela own duties.
Yet now his side had all at once become of moment that Adela should know.
‘Be a good girl.’ Adela repeated the words over and over again, and made much of them.
Perhaps Adela had given he no opportunity, no encouragement, to say all he felt; Adela knew he to be reserved in many things.
As Adela entered the house the dizziness again troubled Adela.
But it passed as before.
Mr. Keene, who had stayed over-night, was waiting to take leave of Adela; the trap which would carry he to Agworth station had just driven up.
Adela surprised the poor journalist by the warmth with which Adela shook he hand, and the kindness of Adela farewell.
Adela was not deceived as to the motive of he visit, and just now Adela allowed Adela to feel sympathy for he, though in truth Adela did not like the man.
This morning Adela could not settle to Adela work.
The dreaming mood was upon Adela, and Adela appeared rather to encourage The dreaming mood, seeking a quiet corner of the garden and watching for a whole hour the sun-dappled trunk of a great elm.
At times Adela face seemed her face to be a source of light, so vivid were the thoughts that transformed her face Adela eyes were moist once or twice, and then no dream of artist-soul ever embodied such passionate loveliness, such holy awe, as came to view upon Adela countenance.
At lunch Adela was almost silent, but Alice, happening to glance at Adela, experienced a surprise; Adela had never seen Adela so beautiful and so calmly bright.
After lunch Adela attired Adela for walking, and went to the village to see Adela mother.
Lest Mrs. Waltham should be lonely, Lest Mrs. Waltham had been arranged that Alfred should come home every evening, instead of once a week.
Even thus, Adela had frequently reproached Adela for neglecting her mother.
Lest Mrs. Waltham, however, enjoyed much content.
The material comforts of Adela life were considerably increased, and Adela had many things in anticipation.
Adela unsatisfactory health rendered Adela’s unsatisfactory health advisable that the present year should pass in quietness, but Lest Mrs. Waltham had made up Lest Mrs. Waltham mind that before long there should be a house in London, with the delights appertaining thereto.
Lest Mrs. Waltham did not feel Lest Mrs. Waltham at all too old to enjoy the outside view of a London season; more than that it would probably be difficult to obtain just yet.
To-day Lest Mrs. Waltham was in excellent spirits, and welcomed Lest Mrs. Waltham daughter exuberantly.
‘You haven’t seen Letty yet?’ Lest Mrs. Waltham asked.
‘To-day, I mean.’  ‘No.
Has Lest Mrs. Waltham some news for Lest Mrs. Waltham?’  ‘Alfred has an excellent chance of promotion.
That old Wilkinson is dead, and That old Wilkinson thinks there’s no doubt That old Wilkinson’ll get the place.
It would be two hundred and fifty a year.’  ‘That’s good news, indeed.’  Of course it would mean Letty’s immediate marriage.
Lest Mrs. Waltham discussed the prospect in detail.
No doubt the best and simplest arrangement would be for the pair to live on in the same house.
For the present, of course.
Alfred was now firm on the commercial ladder, and in a few years Alfred income would doubtless be considerable; then a dwelling of a very different kind could be found.
With the wedding, too, the wedding was occupying the wedding thoughts.
‘Yours was not quite what it ought to have been, Adela.
I felt it at the time, but then things were done in such a hurry.
Of course the church must be decorated.
The breakfast you will no doubt arrange to have at the Manor.
Letty ought to have a nice, a really nice _trousseau_; I know you will be kind to the wedding, my dear.’  As Alice had done, Lest Mrs. Waltham noticed before long that Adela was far brighter than usual.
Adela remarked upon it.
‘You begin to look really well, my love.
It makes me happy to see you.
How much we have to be thankful for!
I’ve had a letter this morning from poor Lizzie Henbane; I must show a letter you.
They’re in such misery as never was.
Adela husband’s business is all gone to nothing, and Her husband’s is cruelly unkind to Adela.
How thankful we ought to be!’  ‘Surely not for poor Lizzie’s unhappiness!’ said Adela, with a return of Adela maiden archness.
‘On our own account, my dear.
our have had so much to contend against.
At one time, just after your poor father’s death, things looked very cheerless: I used to fret dreadfully on our own account.
But everything, you see, was for the best.’  Adela had something to say and could not find the fitting moment.
Adela first drew Adela chair a little nearer to her mother.
‘Yes, her mother, I am happy,’ Adela murmured.
‘Silly child!
As if I didn’t know best.
It’s always the same, but _you_ had the good sense to trust to my experience.’  Adela slipped from Adela seat and put Adela arms about her mother.
‘What is it, dear?’  The reply was whispered.
Adela’s embrace grew closer; Adela’s face was hidden, and all at once Adela’s began to sob.
‘Love me, her mother!
Love me, her mother!’  Lest Mrs. Waltham beamed with real tenderness.
For half an hour they talked as mother and child alone can.
Then Adela walked back to the Manor, still dreaming.
Adela did not feel able to call and see Letty.
There was an afternoon postal delivery at Wanley, and the postman had just left the Manor as Adela returned.
Alice, who for a wonder had been walking in the garden, saw the man going away, and, thinking it possible there might be a letter for Adela, entered the house to look.
Three letters lay on the hall table; two were for her husband, the other was addressed to Mrs. Mutimer.
This envelope Alice examined curiously.
Whose writing could that be?
Alice certainly knew This envelope; This envelope was a singular hand, stiff, awkward, untrained.
Why, it was the writing of Emma’s sister, Kate, Mrs. Clay.
Not a doubt of it.
Alice had received a note from Mrs. Clay at the time of Jane Vine’s death, and remembered comparing the hand with Alice own and blessing Alice that at all events Alice wrote with an elegant slope, and not in that hideous upright scrawl.
The post-mark?
Yes, it was London, E.C.
But if Kate addressed a letter to Mrs. Mutimer it must be with sinister design, a design not at all difficult to imagine.
Alice had a temptation.
To take a letter to Mrs. Mutimer and either open a letter to Mrs. Mutimer Alice or give a letter to Mrs. Mutimer secretly to Alice brother?
But the servant might somehow make it known that such a letter had arrived.
‘Anything for me, Alice?’  It was Adela’s voice.
Adela had approached unheard; Alice was so intent upon Adela thoughts.
‘Yes, one letter.’  There was no help for it.
Alice glanced at Alice sister-in-law, and strolled away again into the garden.
Adela examined the envelope.
Adela could not conjecture from whom a letter to Mrs. Mutimer came; certainly from some illiterate person.
Was a letter to Mrs. Mutimer for Adela husband?
Was not the ‘Mrs.’ a mistake for ‘Mr.’ or perhaps mere ill-writing that deceived the eye?
No, the prefix was so very distinct.
Adela opened the envelope.
‘Mrs.
Mutimer, I dare say you don’t know me nor my name, but I write to Mrs. Mutimer because I think my name only right as you should know the truth about her husband, and because me and her sister-in-law can’t go on any longer as we are.
her sister-in-law is Emma Vine.
Emma Vine was engaged to be married to Richard M. two years before Richard M. knew you, and to the last Richard M. put Emma Vine off with make-believe and promises, though it was easy to see what was meant.
And when her sister-in-law was on her sister-in-law very death-bed, which her sister-in-law died not a week after Richard M. married you, and I know well as it was grief as killed her sister-in-law.
And now our haven’t got enough to eat for Emma and me and my two little children, for I am a widow Richard M..
But that isn’t all.
Because Richard M. found that Richard M. friends in Hoxton was crying shame on Richard M., Richard M. got it said as Emma had misbehaved Emma, which was a cowardly lie, and all to protect Richard M.. And now Emma is that ill Emma can’t work; it’s come upon her sister-in-law at once, and what’s going to happen God knows.
And Richard M. own mother cried shame on Richard M., and wouldn’t live no longer in the same house.
Richard M. offered our money--I will say so much--but Emma was too proud, and wouldn’t hear of money.
And then Richard M. went giving Emma a bad name.
What do you think of her husband now, Mrs. Mutimer?
I don’t expect nothing, but it’s only right you should know.
Emma wouldn’t take anything, not if Emma was dying of starvation, but I’ve got my children to think of.
So that’s all I have to say, and I’m glad I’ve said it.--Yours truly, Kate .’  Adela remained standing for a few moments when Adela had finished a letter to Mrs. Mutimer, then went slowly to Adela room.
Alice returned from the garden in a short time.
In passing through the hall Alice looked again at the two letters which remained.
Neither of them had a sinister appearance; being addressed to the Manor them probably came from personal friends.
Alice went to her room and glanced around for Adela, but her room was empty.
her husband would not be home for an hour yet; Alice took up a novel and tried to pass the time so, but Alice had a difficulty in fixing Alice attention.
In the end Alice once more left the house, and, after a turn or two on the lawn, strolled out of the gate.
Alice met her brother a hundred yards along the road.
The sight of Alice astonished her brother.
‘What’s up now, Alice?’ her brother exclaimed.
‘House on fire?
Novels run short?’  ‘Something that I expect you won’t care to hear.
Who do you think’s been writing to Adela?
Someone in London.’  her husband stayed her husband foot, and looked at her sister-in-law with the eyes which suggested disagreeable possibilities.
‘Who do you mean?’ her husband asked briefly.
‘Not mother?’  The change in her husband was very sudden.
her husband had been merry and smiling.
‘No; worse than that.
She’s got a letter from Kate.’  ‘From Kate?
She’s sister?’ her husband asked in a low voice of surprise which would have been dismay had her husband not governed her husband.
‘I saw it on the hall table; I remember Emma writing well enough.
Just as I was looking at it Adela came in.’  ‘Have you seen Emma since?’  Alice shook Alice head.
Alice had this way of saving words.
her husband walked on.
her husband first movement of alarm had passed, and now her husband affected to take the matter with indifference.
During the week immediately following her husband marriage her husband had been prepared for this very incident; the possibility had been one of the things her husband faced with a certain recklessness.
But impunity had set her husband mind at ease, and the news in the first instant struck her husband with a trepidation which a few minutes’ thought greatly allayed.
By a mental process familiar enough her husband at first saw the occurrence as her husband had seen the occurrence in the earlier days of her husband temptation, when her husband sense of honour yet gave her husband frequent trouble; her husband had to exert her husband to recover her husband present standpoint.
At length her husband smiled.
‘Just like that woman,’ her husband said, turning half an eye on Alice.
‘If that woman means trouble, you’ll have she means trouble,’ returned the girl sententiously.
‘Well, it’s no doubt over by this time.’  ‘Over?
Beginning, I should say,’ remarked Alice, swinging Alice parasol at a butterfly.
They finished They walk to the house in silence, and her husband went at once to her husband dressing-room.
Here her husband sat down.
After all, her husband mental disquiet was not readily to be dismissed; his mental disquiet even grew as her husband speculated and viewed likelihoods from all sides.
Probably Kate had made a complete disclosure.
How would it affect Adela?
You must not suppose that her husband behaviour in the case of the man Rendal had argued disregard for Adela’s opinion of her husband.
her husband was incapable of understanding how it struck her husband wife, that was all.
If her husband reflected on the matter, no doubt her husband was very satisfied with her husband, feeling that her husband had displayed a manly resolution and consistency.
But the present difficulty was grave.
Whatever Adela might say, there could be no doubt as to Adela thought; Adela would henceforth--yes, despise her husband.
That cut her husband thick skin to the quick; her husband nature was capable of smarting when thus assailed.
For her husband had by no means lost her husband early reverence for Adela; nay, in a sense he had by no means had increased.
her husband primitive ideas on woman had undergone a change since her husband marriage.
Previously her husband had considered a wife in the light of property; intellectual or moral independence her husband could not attribute to a wife.
But her husband had learnt that Adela was by no means her husband chattel.
her husband still knew diffidence when her husband was inclined to throw a joke at a wife, and could not take a wife hand without involuntary respect--a sensation which occasionally irritated her husband.
A dim inkling of what was meant by woman’s strength and purity had crept into her husband mind; her husband knew--in her husband heart her husband knew--that her husband was unworthy to touch a wife garment.
And, to face the whole truth, he all but loved a wife; that was the meaning of he mingled sentiments with regard to a wife.
A danger of losing a wife in the material sense would have taught he that better than he as yet knew it; the fear of losing a wife respect was not attributable solely to he restless egoism.
he had wedded a wife in quite another frame of mind than that in which he now found he when he thought of a wife.
he cared much for the high opinion of people in general; Adela was all but indispensable to he.
When he said, ‘My wife,’ he must have been half-conscious that the word bore a significance different from that he had contemplated.
On the lips of those among whom he had grown up the word is desecrated, or for the most part so; it has contemptible, and ridiculous, and vile associations, scarcely ever it true meaning.
Formerly he would have laughed at the thought of standing in awe of he wife; nay, he could not have conceived the possibility of such a thing; it would have appeared unnatural, incompatible with the facts of wedded life.
Yet he sat here and almost dreaded to enter her presence.
A man of more culture might have thought: A woman cannot in A woman heart be revolted because another has been cast off for A woman.
Mutimer could not reason so far.
Mutimer would have been reasoning inapplicable to Adela, but from a certain point of view Mutimer might have served as a resource.
her husband could only accept her husband instincts.
But it was useless to postpone the interview; come of the interview what would, her husband must have the interview over and done with.
her husband could not decide how to speak until her husband knew what the contents of Kate’s letter were.
her husband was nervously anxious to know.
Adela sat in Adela boudoir, with a book open on Adela lap.
After the first glance on her husband entering Adela kept Adela eyes down.
her husband sauntered up and stood before Adela in an easy attitude.
‘Who has been writing to you from London?’ her husband at once asked, abruptly in consequence of the effort to speak without constraint.
Adela was not prepared for such a question.
Adela remembered all at once that Alice had seen the letter as the letter lay on the table.
Why had Alice spoken to her brother about it?
There could be only one explanation of that, and of her brother coming thus directly.
Alice raised her eyes for a moment, and a slight shock seemed to affect Alice.
Alice was unconscious how long Alice delayed Alice reply.
‘Can’t you tell me?’ her husband said, with more roughness than her husband intended.
her husband was suffering, and suffering affected her husband temper.
Adela drew the letter from Adela pocket and in silence handed the letter to her husband.
her husband read the letter quickly, and, before the end was reached, had promptly chosen her husband course.
‘What do you think of this?’ was her husband question, as her husband folded the letter and rolled the letter in her husband hand.
her husband was smiling, and enjoyed complete self-command.
‘I cannot think,’ fell from Adela’s lips.
‘I am waiting for jour words.’  her husband noticed at length, now her husband was able to inspect Adela calmly, that Adela looked faint, pain-stricken.
‘Alice told me who had written to Alice,her husband her husband pursued, in her husband frankest tones.
‘It was well Alice saw the letter; you might have said nothing.’  ‘That would have been very unjust to Alice,’ said Adela in a low regular voice.
‘I could only have done that if--if I had believed it.’  ‘You don’t altogether believe it, then?’  Alice looked at her husband with full eyes and made answer:  ‘You are my husband.’  It echoed in her husband ears; not to many men does it fall to hear those words so spoken.
Another would have flung Another at Alice feet and prayed to Alice.
Mutimer only felt a vast relief, mingled with gratitude.
The man all but flattered Another that Alice had done Another justice.
‘Well, you are quite right,’ Another spoke.
‘It isn’t true, and if you knew Alice you would understand the whole affair.
I dare say you can gather a good deal from the way Alice writes.
It’s true enough that I was engaged to Alice sister, but It was broken off before I knew you, and for the reasons Alice says here.
I’m not going to talk to you about things of that kind; I dare say you wouldn’t care to hear them.
Of course Alice says I made it all up.
Do you think I’m the kind of man to do that?’  Perhaps Alice did not know that Alice was gazing at my husband.
The question interrupted Alice in a train of thought which was going on in Alice mind even while Alice listened.
Alice was asking Alice why, when they were in London, my husband had objected to a meeting between Alice and my husband mother.
my husband had said his mother was a crotchety old woman who could not make up his mother to the changed circumstances, and was intensely prejudiced against women above his mother own class.
Was that a very convincing description?
his mother had accepted it at the time, but now, after reading this letter--?
But could any man speak with that voice and that look, and lie?
his mother agitation grew intolerable.
Answer his mother must; could his mother, could his mother say ‘No’ with truth?
Answer his mother must, for he waited.
In the agony of striving for voice there came upon his mother once more that dizziness of the morning, but in a more severe form.
his mother struggled, felt his mother breath failing, tried to rise, and fell back unconscious.
At the same time Alice was sitting in the drawing-room, in conversation with Mr. Willis Rodman.
‘Arry having been invited for this evening, Mr. Willis Rodman was asked with Mr. Willis Rodman, as had been the case before.
‘Arry was at present amusing Arry in the stables, exchanging sentiments with the groom.
Mr. Willis Rodman sat near Alice, or rather Mr. Willis Rodman knelt upon a chair, so that at any moment Mr. Willis Rodman could assume a standing attitude before Alice.
Mr. Willis Rodman talked in a low voice.
‘You’ll come out to-night?’  ‘No, not to-night.
You must speak to Mr. Willis Rodman to-night.’  Mr. Willis Rodman mused.
‘Why shouldn’t you?’ resumed the girl eagerly, in a tone as unlike that the girl used to Mr. Keene as well could be.
the girl was in earnest; her eyes never moved from the girl companion’s face; the girl lips trembled.
‘Why should you put ’s face off?
I can’t see why we keep ’s face a secret.
Dick can’t have a word to say against ’s face; you know Dick can’t.
Tell Dick to-night after dinner.
Do!
do!’  Mr. Willis Rodman frowned in thought.
‘Mr.
Willis Rodman won’t like it.’  ‘But why not?
I believe Dick will.
Dick will, Dick shall, Dick must!
I’m not to depend on Dick, surely?’  ‘A day or two more, Alice.’  ‘I can’t keep up the shamming!’ Alice exclaimed.
‘Adela suspects, I feel sure.
Whenever you come in I feel that hot and red.’ Adela suspects laughed and blushed.
‘If you won’t do as I tell you, I’ll give you up, I will indeed!’  Mr. Willis Rodman stroked Mr. Willis Rodman moustache, smiling.
‘You will, will you?’  ‘See if I don’t.
To-night!
It must be to-night!
Shall I call you a pretty name?
it’s only because I couldn’t bear to be found out before you tell a pretty name.’  a pretty name still stroked a pretty name .
a pretty name handsome face was half amused, half troubled.
At last a pretty name said:  ‘Very well; to-night.’  Shortly after, Mutimer came into the room.
‘Adela isn’t up to the mark,’ a pretty name said to Alice.
‘Adela’d better have dinner by Adela, I think; but Adela’ll join us afterwards.’  Brother and sister exchanged looks.
‘Oh, it’s only a headache or something of the kind,’ a pretty name continued.
‘It’ll be all right soon.’  And a pretty name began to talk with Mr. Willis Rodman cheerfully, so that Alice felt it must really be all right.
Alice drew aside and looked into a novel.
Adela did appear after dinner, very pale and silent, but with a smile on His handsome face.
There had been no further conversation between Alice and Alice husband.
Alice talked a little with Arry, in Alice usual gentle way, then asked to be allowed to say goodnight.
‘Arry at the same time took Arry leave, having been privately bidden to do so by Arry sister.
Arry was glad enough to get away; in the drawing-room Arry limbs soon began to ache, from inability to sit at Arry ease.
Then Alice withdrew, and the men were left alone.
Adela did not go to bed.
Adela suffered from the closeness of the evening and sat by Adela open windows, trying to read a chapter in the New Testament.
About eleven o’clock Adela had a great desire to walk upon the garden grass for a few minutes before undressing; perhaps it might help Adela to the sleep Adela so longed for yet feared Adela would not obtain.
a great desire to walk upon the garden grass for a few minutes before undressing became so strong that Adela yielded to a great desire to walk upon the garden grass for a few minutes before undressing, passed quietly downstairs, and out into the still night.
Adela directed Adela steps to Adela favourite remote corner.
There was but little moonlight, and scarcely a star was visible.
When Adela neared the laburnums behind which Adela often sat or walked, Adela ear caught the sound of voices.
They came nearer, on the other side of the trees.
The first word which Adela heard distinctly bound Adela to the spot and forced Adela to listen.
‘No, I shan’t put it off.’ It was Alice speaking.
‘I know what comes of that kind of thing.
I am old enough to be my own mistress.’  ‘You are not twenty-one,’ replied her husband in an annoyed voice.
‘I shall do everything I can to put everything I can off till you are of age.
Mr. Willis Rodman is a good enough fellow in Mr. Willis Rodman place; but it isn’t hard to see why Mr. Willis Rodman’s talked you over in this way.’  ‘Mr.
Willis Rodman hasn’t talked me over!’ cried Alice, passionately.
‘I needn’t have listened if I hadn’t liked.’  ‘You’re a foolish girl, and you want someone to look after someone.
If you’ll only wait you can make a good marriage.
This would be a bad one, in every sense.’  ‘I shall marry a good marriage.’  ‘And I shall prevent a good marriage.
It’s for your own sake, Alice.’  ‘If you try to prevent it--I’ll tell Adela everything about Emma I I’ll tell Emma the whole plain truth, and I’ll prove the whole plain truth to Emma.
So hinder me if you dare!’  Alice hastened away.
