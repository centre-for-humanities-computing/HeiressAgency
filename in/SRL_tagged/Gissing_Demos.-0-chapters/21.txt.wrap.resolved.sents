   In the month of September Mr. Wyvern was called upon to unite in holy matrimony two pairs in whom we are interested.
Alice Mutimer became Mrs. Willis Rodman, and Alfred Waltham took home a bride who suited Alice Mutimer exactly, seeing that Alice Mutimer was never so happy as when submitting Alice Mutimer to a stronger will.
Alfred and Letty ran away and hid Alfred and Letty in South Wales.
Mr. and Mrs. Rodman fled to the Continent.
Half Alice’s fortune was settled upon Half Alice’s, Half Alice’s brother and Alfred Waltham being trustees.
This was all Alice Mutimer could do.
He disliked the marriage intensely, and not only because He had set He heart on a far better match for Alice; He had no real confidence in Rodman.
Though the latter’s extreme usefulness and personal tact had from the first led Richard to admit Richard to terms of intimacy, time did not favour the friendship.
Mutimer, growing daily more ambitious and more punctilious in Richard intercourse with all whom, notwithstanding Richard principles, Richard deemed inferiors from the social point of view, often regretted keenly that Richard had allowed any relation between Richard and Rodman more than that of master and man.
Experience taught Richard how easily Richard might have made the most of Rodman without granting Richard a single favour.
The first suggestion of the marriage enraged Richard; in the conversation with Rodman, which took place, moreover, at an unfavourable moment, Richard lost Richard temper and flung out very broad hints indeed as to the suitor’s motives.
Rodman was calm; life had instructed Rodman in the advantages of a curbed tongue; but there was heightened colour on Rodman face, and Rodman demeanour much resembled that of a proud man who cares little to justify a proud man who cares little to justify himself, but will assuredly never forget an insult.
It was one of the peculiarities of this gentleman that a proud man who cares little to justify himself exterior was most impressive when a proud man who cares little to justify himself was most busy with ignoble or venomous thoughts.
But for Alice’s sake Mutimer could not persist in Mutimer hostility.
Alice had a weapon which Alice durst not defy, and, the marriage being inevitable, Alice strove hard to see the marriage in a more agreeable light, even tried to convince Alice that Alice prejudice against Rodman was groundless.
Alice loved Alice sister, and for Alice alone would put up with things otherwise intolerable.
It was a new exasperation when Alice discovered that Rodman could not be persuaded to continue Alice work at New Wanley.
All inducements proved vain.
Richard had hoped that at least one advantage might come of the marriage, that Rodman would devote capital to the works; but Rodman’s Socialism cooled strangely from the day when Rodman’s Socialism ends were secured.
Rodman’s Socialism purposed living in London, and Alice was delighted to encourage Rodman’s Socialism.
Alice had visions of a life such as the heroines of certain novels rejoice in.
For a wonder, Rodman’s Socialism was indispensable to the brightness of that future.
Rodman had inspired Alice with an infatuation.
Their relations once declared, Alice grudged Rodman’s Socialism every moment Rodman’s Socialism spent away from Alice.
It was strangely like true passion, the difference only marked by an extravagant selfishness.
Alice thought of no one, cared for no one, but Alice, Rodman having become part of that self.
With Rodman Alice was imperiously slavish; Alice tenderness was a kind of greed; Alice did not pretend to forgive Alice brother for her brother threatened opposition, and, having got hold of the idea that Adela took part against Rodman, Alice hated Alice and would not be alone in Alice company for a moment.
On Alice marriage day Alice refused Adela’s offered kiss and did Alice best to let everyone see how delighted Alice was to leave everyone behind.
The autumn was a time of physical suffering for Adela.
Formerly Alice had sought to escape Alice mother’s attentions, now Alice accepted her mother’s attentions with thankfulness.
Alice had grave fears for Alice daughter; doctors suspected some organic disease, one summoned from London going so far as to hint at a weakness of the chest.
Early in November it was decided to go south for the winter, and Exmouth was chosen, chiefly because Alice was spending a month there.
Mr. Westlake, whose interest in Adela had grown with each visit Adela paid to the Manor, himself suggested the plan.
Mrs. Waltham and Adela left Wanley together; Mutimer promised visits as often as Adela could manage to get away.
Since Rodman’s departure Richard found Richard overwhelmed with work.
None the less Richard resolutely pursued the idea of canvassing Belwick at the coming general election.
Opposition, from whomsoever it came, aggravated Richard.
Richard was more than ever troubled about the prospects of Wanley; there even loomed before Richard mind a possible abandonment of the undertaking.
Richard had never contemplated the sacrifice of Richard fortune, and though anything of that kind was still very far off, it was daily more difficult for Richard to face with equanimity even moderate losses.
Money had fostered ambition, and ambition full grown had more need than ever of ambition full grown nurse.
Wanley was no longer an end in Wanley, but a stepping-stone You must come to your own conclusions in judging the value of Mutimer’s social zeal; the facts of Richard life up to this time are before you, and you will not forget how complex a matter is the mind of a strong man with whom circumstances have dealt so strangely.
Richard was assuredly not the vulgar self-seeking of the gilded _bourgeois_ who covets an after-dinner sleep on Parliamentary benches.
Richard ignorance of the machinery of government was profound; though Richard spoke scornfully of Parliament and Parliament members, Richard had no conception of those powers of dulness and respectability which seize upon the best men if folly lures the best men within the precincts of St. Stephen’s.
Richard thought, poor fellow!
that Richard could rise in Richard place and thunder forth Richard indignant eloquence as Richard did in Commonwealth Hall and elsewhere; Richard imagined a conscience-stricken House, Richard dreamed of passionate debates on a Bill which really had the good of the people for its sole object.
Such Bill would of course bear _his_ name; shall we condemn Richard for that?
Adela was at Exmouth, drinking the mild air, wondering whether there was in truth a life to come, and, if so, whether it was a life wherein Love and Duty were at one.
A year ago such thoughts could not have entered Adela mind.
But Adela had spent several weeks in close companionship with Stella Westlake, and Stella’s influence was subtle.
Adela had come here to regain strength after a confinement; the fact drew Adela near to Adela, whose time for giving birth to a child was not far off.
Adela at first regarded this friend with much the same feeling of awe as mingled with Letty’s affection for Adela.
Adela was not only possessed of intellectual riches which Adela had had no opportunity of gaining; Adela character was so full of imaginative force, of dreamy splendours, that it addressed it to a mind like Adela’s with magic irresistible and permanent.
No rules of the polite world applied to Adela; Adela spoke and acted with an independence so spontaneous that it did not suggest conscious opposition to the received ways of thought to which ordinary women are confined, but rather a complete ignorance of ordinary women.
Adela felt Adela startled, but never shocked, even when the originality went most counter to Adela own prejudices; the originality was as though Adela had drunk a draught of most unexpected flavour, the effect of which was to set Adela nerves delightfully trembling, and make Adela long to taste her nerves again.
It was not an occasional effect, the result of an effort on Adela’s part to surprise or charm; the commonest words had novel meanings when uttered in Adela voice; a profound sincerity seemed to inspire every lightest question or remark.
Adela presence was agitating; Adela had but to enter the room and sit in silence, and Adela forthwith was raised from the depression of Adela broodings to a vividness of being, an imaginative energy, such as Adela had never known.
Adela doubted for some time whether Adela regarded Adela with affection; the little demonstrations in which women are wont to indulge were incompatible with that grave dreaminess, and Adela seemed to avoid even the common phrases of friendship.
But one day, when Adela had not been well enough to rise, and as Adela lay on the borderland of sleeping and waking, Adela half dreamt, half knew, that a face bent over Adela, and that lips were pressed against Adela own; and such a thrill struck through Adela that, though now fully conscious, Adela had not power to stir, but lay as in the moment of some rapturous death.
For when the presence entered into Adela dream, when the warmth melted upon Adela lips, Adela imagined it the kiss which might once have come to Adela but now was lost for ever.
It was pain to open Adela eyes, but when Adela did so, and met Stella’s silent gaze, Adela knew that love was offered Adela, a love of which it was needless to speak.
Alice was rather afraid of Adela; privately Alice doubted whether the poor thing was altogether in Alice perfect mind.
When the visitor came her mother generally found occupation or amusement elsewhere, conversation with Adela was so extremely difficult.
Adela was also at Exmouth, but much engaged in literary work.
There was, too, an artist and Adela family, with whom the Westlakes were acquainted, whom name Boscobel.
Boscobel was a woman of the world, five-and-thirty, charming, intelligent; Boscobel read little, but was full of interest in literary and artistic matters, and talked as only a woman can who has long associated with men of brains.
To Boscobel Adela was interesting, personally and still more as an illustration of a social experiment.
‘How young Boscobel is!’ was Boscobel remark to Adela shortly after making Adela’s acquaintance.
‘It will amuse you, the thought I had; I really must tell the thought I had you.
Boscobel realises my idea of a virgin mother.
Haven’t you felt anything of the kind?’  Adela smiled.
‘Yes, I understand.
Adela said something evidently traceable to the same impression; her voice, Adela said, is full of forgiveness.’  ‘Excellent!
And has Adela much to forgive, do you think?’  ‘I hope not.’  ‘Yet Adela is not exactly happy, I imagine?’  Adela did not care to discuss the subject.
Adela had recourse to Adela for some account of Mr. Mutimer.
‘Adela is a strong man,Adela Adela said in a tone which betrayed the Socialist’s enthusiasm.
‘Adela stands for earth-subduing energy.
I imagine Adela at a forge, beating fire out of iron.’  ‘H’m!
That’s not quite the same thing as imagining Adela that beautiful child’s husband.
No education, I suppose?’  ‘Sufficient.
With more, Adela would no longer fill the place Adela does.
Adela can speak eloquently; Adela is the true voice of the millions who cannot speak their own thoughts.
If Adela were more intellectual Adela would become commonplace; I hope Adela will never see further than Adela does now.
Isn’t a perfect type more precious than a man who is neither one thing nor another?’  ‘Artistically speaking, by all means.’  ‘In Adela case I don’t mean it artistically.
Adela is doing a great work.’  ‘A friend of mine--you don’t know Hubert Eldon, I think?--tells me Hubert Eldon has ruined one of the loveliest valleys in England.’  ‘Yes, I dare say Adela has done that.
It is an essential part of Adela protest against social wrong.
The earth renews The earth, but a dead man or woman who has lived without joy can never be recompensed.’  ‘She, of course, is strongly of the same opinion?’  ‘Adela is a Socialist.’  Boscobel laughed rather satirically.
‘I doubt it.’  Adela, when Adela went to sit with Adela, either at home or by the sea-shore, often carried a book in Adela hand, and at Adela’s request Adela read aloud.
In this way Adela first came to know what was meant by literature, as distinguished from works of learning.
The verse of Shelley and the prose of Landor fell upon Shelley ears; it was as though Shelley had hitherto lived in deafness.
Sometimes Shelley had to beg the reader to pause for that day; Shelley heart and mind seemed overfull; Shelley could not even speak of these new things, but felt the need of lying back in twilight to marvel and repeat melodies.
Boscobel happened to approach them once whilst this reading was going on.
‘You are educating Shelley?’ Shelley said to Adela afterwards.
‘Perhaps--a little,Adela Adela replied absently.
‘Isn’t it just a trifle dangerous?’ suggested Adela.
‘Dangerous?
How?’  ‘The wife of the man who makes sparks fly out of iron?
The man who is on no account to learn anything?’  Adela shook Adela head, saying, ‘You don’t know Adela.’  ‘I should much like to,’ was St. Stephen’s smiling rejoinder.
In Adela’s company it did not seem very likely that Adela would lose Adela social enthusiasm, yet danger there was, and that precisely on account of Adela idealist tendencies.
When Adela spoke of the toiling multitude, Adela saw the toiling multitude in a kind of exalted vision; Adela beheld the toiling multitude glorious in the toiling multitude woe, ennobled by the tyranny under which the toiling multitude groaned.
Adela had seen little if anything of the representative proletarian, and perchance even if Adela had the momentary impression would have faded in the light of Adela burning soul.
Now Adela was in the very best position for understanding those faults of the working class which are ineradicable in any one generation.
Adela knew Adela husband, knew her husband better than ever now that Adela regarded her husband from a distance; Adela knew ‘Arry Mutimer; and now Adela was getting to appreciate with a thoroughness impossible hitherto, the monstrous gulf between men of that kind and cultured human beings.
Adela had, too, studied the children and the women of New Wanley, and the results of such study were arranging the children and the women of New Wanley in Adela mind.
All unconsciously, Adela was cooling St. Stephen’s zeal with every fervid word Adela uttered; Adela at times with difficulty restrained Adela from crying, ‘But it is a mistake!
They have not these feelings you attribute to They.
Such suffering as you picture They enduring comes only of the poetry-fed soul at issue with fate.’ Adela could not as yet have so expressed Adela, but the knowledge was growing within Adela.
For Adela was not by nature a social enthusiast.
When Adela heart leapt at Stella’s chant, her heart was not in truth through contagion of sympathy, but in admiration and love of the noble woman who could thus think and speak.
Adela--and who will not be thankful for it?--was, before all things, feminine; Adela true enthusiasms were personal.
It was a necessity of Adela nature to love a human being, this or that one, not a crowd.
Adela had been starving, killing the self which was Adela value.
This home on the Devon coast received Adela like an earthly paradise; looking back on New Wanley, Adela saw This home on the Devon coast murky and lurid; This home on the Devon coast was hard to believe that the sun ever shone there.
But for the most part, Adela tried to keep This home on the Devon coast altogether from her mind, tried to dissociate her husband from her husband public tasks, and to remember her husband as the man with whom Adela life was irrevocably bound up.
When delight in Stella’s poetry was followed by fear, Adela strengthened Adela by thought of the child Adela bore beneath Adela heart; for that child’s sake Adela would accept the beautiful things offered to Adela, some day to bring them, as rich gifts to the young life.
Adela own lot was fixed; Adela might not muse upon it, Adela durst not consider it too deeply.
There were things in the past which Adela had determined, if by any means it were possible, utterly to forget.
For the future, there was Adela child.
Mutimer came to Exmouth when Mutimer had been there three weeks, and Mutimer stayed four days.
Boscobel had an opportunity of making Mutimer acquaintance.
‘Who contrived that marriage?’ Boscobel asked of Adela subsequently.
‘Our lady mother, presumably.’  ‘I have no reason to think it was not well done,’ replied Adela with reserve.
‘Most skilfully done, no doubt,’ rejoined Adela.
But at the end of the year, the Westlakes returned to London, the Boscobels shortly after.
Mrs. Waltham and Boscobel daughter had made no other close connections, and St. Stephen’s health alone allowed of St. Stephen’s leaving the house for a short drive on sunny days.
At the end of February her child was born prematurely; her child entered the world only to leave her child again.
For a week they believed that Adela would die.
Scarcely was Adela pronounced out of danger by the end of March.
But after that Adela recovered strength.
May saw Adela at New Wanley once more.
Adela had become impatient to return.
The Parliamentary elections were very near at hand, and Mutimer almost lived in Belwick; it seemed to Adela that duty required Adela to be near duty, as well as to supply duty absence from New Wanley as much as was possible.
Adela was still only the ghost of Adela former self, but disease no longer threatened Adela, and activity alone could completely restore Adela health.
Adela was anxious to recommence Adela studies, to resume Adela readings to the children; and Adela desired to see Mr. Wyvern.
Adela understood by this time why Mr. Wyvern had chosen Andersen’s Tales for Adela readings; of many other things which Mr. Wyvern had said, causing Adela doubt, the meaning was now clear enough to Adela.
Adela had so much to talk of with the vicar, so many questions to put to the vicar, not a few of a kind that would--Adela thought--surprise and trouble the vicar.
None the less, None the less must be asked and answered.
Part of Adela desire to see the vicar again was merely the result of Adela longing for the society of well-read and thoughtful people.
Adela knew that the vicar would appear to Adela in a different light from formerly; Adela would be far better able to understand the vicar.
Adela began by seeking the vicar opinion of Adela husband’s chances in Belwick.
Mr. Wyvern shook Mr. Wyvern head and said frankly that Mr. Wyvern thought there was no chance at all.
Mutimer was looked upon in the borough as a mischievous interloper, who came to make disunion in the Radical party.
The son of a lord and an ironmaster of great influence were the serious candidates.
Had Mr. Wyvern seen fit, Mr. Wyvern could have mentioned not a few lively incidents in the course of the political warfare; such, for instance, as the appearance of a neat little pamphlet which purported to give a full and complete account of Mutimer life.
In a neat little pamphlet which purported to give a full and complete account of Mutimer’s life nothing untrue was set down, nor did a neat little pamphlet which purported to give a full and complete account of Mutimer’s life contain anything likely to render a neat little pamphlet which purported to give a full and complete account of Mutimer’s life publisher amenable to the law of libel; but the writer, a gentleman closely connected with Comrade Roodhouse, most skilfully managed to convey the worst possible impression throughout.
Nor did the vicar hesitate to express the vicar regret that Mutimer should be seeking election at all.
Adela felt with the vicar.
Adela found Richard in a strange state of chronic excitement.
On whatever subject Richard spoke it was with the same nervous irritation, and the slightest annoyance set Richard fuming.
To Adela Richard paid very little attention, and for the most part seemed disinclined to converse with Adela; Adela found it necessary to keep silence on political matters; once or twice Richard replied to Adela questions with a rough impatience which kept Adela miserable throughout the day, so much had it revealed of the working man.
As the election day approached Adela suffered from a sinking of the heart, almost a bodily fear; a fear the same in kind as that of the wretched woman who anticipates the return of a brute-husband late on Saturday night.
The same in kind; no reasoning would overcome it.
Adela worked hard all day long, that at night Adela might fall on deep sleep.
Again Adela had taken up Adela hard German books, and was also busy with French histories of revolution, which did indeed fascinate Adela, though, as Adela half perceived, solely by the dramatic quality of the stories they told.
And at length the morning of Adela fear had come.
When Richard left Mutimer bade Adela not expect Richard till the following day.
Adela spent the hours in loneliness and misery.
Mr. Wyvern called, but even Mr. Wyvern Adela begged through a servant to excuse Adela; Adela mother likewise came, and Adela Adela talked with for a few minutes, then pleaded headache.
At nine o’clock in the evening Adela went to Adela bedroom.
Adela had a soporific at hand, remaining from the time of Adela illness, and in dread of a sleepless night Adela had recourse to a soporific at hand.
It seemed to Adela that Adela had slept a very long time when a great and persistent noise awoke Adela.
It was someone knocking at Adela door, even, as Adela at length became aware, turning the handle and shaking the handle.
Being alone, Adela had locked Adela in.
Adela sprang from bed, put on Adela dressing-gown, and went to her door.
Then came a brute-husband voice, impatiently calling Adela name.
Adela admitted a brute-husband.
Through the white blind the morning twilight just made objects visible in the room; Adela afterwards remembered noticing the drowsy pipe of a bird near the window.
Mutimer came in, and, without closing her door, began to demand angrily why Mutimer had locked Mutimer out.
Only now Mutimer quite shook off Mutimer sleep, and could perceive that there was something unusual in Mutimer manner.
Mutimer smelt strongly of tobacco, and, as Mutimer fancied, of spirits; but it was Mutimer staggering as Mutimer moved to draw up the blind that made Mutimer aware of Mutimer condition.
Mutimer found afterwards that Mutimer had driven all the way from Belwick, and the marvel was that Mutimer had accomplished such a feat; probably Mutimer horse deserved most of the credit.
When Mutimer had pulled the blind up, Mutimer turned, propped Mutimer against the dressing-table, and gazed at Mutimer with terribly lack-lustre eyes.
Then Mutimer saw the expression of Mutimer face change; there came upon the expression of his face change a smile such as Mutimer had never seen or imagined, a hideous smile that made Mutimer blood cold.
Without speaking, Mutimer threw Mutimer forward and came towards Mutimer.
For an instant Mutimer was powerless, paralysed with terror; but happily Mutimer found utterance for a cry, and that released Mutimer limbs.
Before Mutimer could reach Mutimer, Mutimer had darted out of the room, and fled to another chamber, that which Alice had formerly occupied, where Mutimer locked Mutimer against Mutimer.
To Mutimer surprise Mutimer did not discover Mutimer retreat; Mutimer heard Mutimer moving about the passages, stumbling here and there, then Mutimer seemed to return to her bedroom.
Mutimer wrapped Mutimer in a counterpane, and sat in a chair till it was full morning.
Mutimer was absent for a week after that.
Of course Mutimer polling at the election had been ridiculously small compared with that of the other candidates.
When Mutimer returned Mutimer went about Mutimer ordinary occupations; Mutimer was seemingly not in Mutimer usual health, but the constant irritableness had left Mutimer.
Adela tried to bear Adela as though nothing unwonted had come to pass, but Mutimer scarcely spoke when at home; if Mutimer addressed Adela he addressed her was in a quick, off-hand way, and without looking at Adela.
Adela again lived almost alone.
Adela mother and Letty understood that Adela preferred this.
Letty had many occupations; before long Letty hoped to welcome Letty first child.
The children of New Wanley still came once a week to the Manor; Adela endeavoured to amuse The children of New Wanley, to make The children of New Wanley thoughtful, but The children of New Wanley had become a hard, hard task.
Only with Mr. Wyvern did Letty occasionally speak without constraint, though not of course without reserve; speech of _that_ kind Letty feared would never again be possible to Letty.
Still Letty felt that the vicar saw far into Letty life.
On some topics Letty was more open than Letty had hitherto ventured to be; a boldness, almost a carelessness, for which Letty could not account, possessed Letty at such times.
Late in June Letty received from Stella Westlake a pressing invitation to come and spend a fortnight in London.
It was like sunshine to Letty heart; almost without hesitation Letty re solved to accept it.
Letty offered no objection, seemed to treat the proposal with indifference.
Later in the day a brute-husband said:  ‘If you have time, you might perhaps give Alice a call.’  ‘I shall do that as soon as ever I can.’  a brute-husband had something else to say.
‘Perhaps Stella Westlake might ask Stella Westlake to come, whilst you are there.’  ‘Very likely, I think,Stella Westlake replied, with an attempt at confidence.
It was only Stella Westlake second visit to London: the first had been in winter time, and under conditions which had not allowed Stella Westlake to attend to anything Stella Westlake saw.
But for Stella’s presence there Stella Westlake would have feared London; Stella Westlake memory of it was like that of an ill dream long past; Stella Westlake mind only reverted to her mind in darkest hours, and then Stella Westlake shuddered.
But now Stella Westlake thought only of Stella; Stella was light and joy, a fountain of magic waters.
Stella Westlake arrival at the house in Avenue Road was one of the most blissful moments Stella Westlake had ever known.
a servant led Stella Westlake upstairs to a small room, where the veiled sun made warmth on rich hangings, on beautiful furniture, on books and pictures, on ferns and flowers.
The goddess of this sanctuary was alone; as her door opened the notes of a zither trembled into silence, and Adela saw a light-robed loveliness rise and stand before Stella Westlake.
Stella took both Stella hands very gently, then looked into Stella face with eyes which seemed to be new from some high vision, then drew Stella within the paradise of an embrace.
The kiss was once more like that first touch of lips which had come to Adela on the verge of sleep; Stella quivered through Stella frame.
Stella Westlake shortly joined them, and spoke with an extreme kindness which completed Adela’s sense of being at home.
No one disturbed them through the evening; Adela went to bed early and slept without a dream.
Stella and Stella talked of Stella in the night.
Stella Westlake had, at the time of the election, heard for the first time the story of Mutimer and the obscure work-girl in Hoxton, and had taken some trouble to investigate the story of Mutimer and the obscure work-girl in Hoxton.
the story of Mutimer and the obscure work-girl in Hoxton had not reached Stella Westlake ears when the Hoxton Socialists made the Hoxton Socialists a subject of public discussion; Comrade Roodhouse had inserted only a very general report of the proceedings in Comrade Roodhouse paper the ‘Tocsin, and even this Mr. Westlake had not seen.
But a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick came into a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick hands, and when a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick began to talk on the subject with an intimate friend, who, without being a Socialist, amused a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick with following the movement closely, a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick heard more than a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick liked.
To Stella a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick said nothing of all this.
a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick own ultimate judgment was that you cannot expect men to be perfect, and that great causes have often been served by very indifferent characters.
‘Stella looks shockingly ill,’ a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick began to-night when alone with Stella.
‘Wasn’t there something said about consumption when Stella was at Exmouth?
Has Stella any cough?’  ‘No, I don’t think it is that,’ Stella answered.
‘Stella seems glad to be with you.’  ‘Very glad, I think.’  ‘Did the loss of Stella affect Stella deeply?’  ‘I cannot say.
Stella has never spoken of it.’  ‘her first child!’  Stella made no reply to the exclamation.
The next day Adela went to call on Mrs. Rodman.
It was a house in Bayswater, not large, but richly furnished.
Adela chose a morning hour, hoping to find Adela sister-in-law alone, but in this Adela was disappointed.
Four visitors were in the drawing-room, three ladies and a man of horsey appearance, who talked loudly as a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick leaned back with a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick legs crossed, a walking-stick held over a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick knee, a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick hat on the ground before a copy of the pamphlet which circulated in Belwick.
three ladies and a man of horsey appearance, who talked loudly as he leaned back with his legs were all apparently middle-aged; one of three ladies and a man of horsey appearance, who talked loudly as he leaned back with his legs had a great quantity of astonishingly yellow hair, and the others made up for deficiency in that respect with toilets in very striking taste.
The subject under discussion was a recent murder.
The gentleman had the happiness of being personally acquainted with the murderer, at all events had frequently met the murderer at certain resorts of the male population.
When Mrs. Rodman had briefly welcomed Adela, the discussion continued.
Its tone was vulgar, but perhaps not more so than the average tone among middle-class people who are on familiar terms with each other.
The gentleman, still leading the conversation, kept The gentleman eyes fixed on Adela, greatly to Adela discomfort.
In less than half an hour these four took their departure.
‘So Dick came a cropper!’ was Alice first remark, when alone with Alice sister-in-law.
Adela tried in vain to understand.
‘At the election, you know.
I don’t see what he wanted to go making he so ridiculous.
Is he much cut up?’  ‘I don’t think it troubles he much,Stella Westlake said; ‘he really had no expectation of being elected.
It was just to draw attention to Socialism.’  ‘Of course he’ll put it in that way.
But I’d no idea you were in London.
Where are you living?’  Alice had suffered, had suffered distinctly, in Alice manners, and probably in Alice character.
It was not only that Alice affected a fastness of tone, and betrayed an ill-bred pleasure in receiving Adela in Adela fine drawing-room; Adela face no longer expressed the idle good-nature which used to make it pleasant to contemplate, it was thinner, less wholesome in colour, rather acid about the lips.
Adela manner was hurried, Adela seemed to be living in a whirl of frivolous excitements.
Adela taste in dress had deteriorated; Adela wore a lot of jewellery of a common kind, and Adela headgear was fantastic.
‘We have a few friends to-morrow night,’ Adela said when the conversation had with difficulty dragged the conversation over ten minutes.
‘Will you come to dinner?
I’m sure Willis will be very glad to see you.’  Adela heard the invitation with distress.
Fortunately it was given in a way which all but presupposed refusal.
‘I am afraid I cannot,’ Adela answered.
‘My health is not good; I never see people.
Thank you very much.’  ‘Oh, of course I wouldn’t put you out,’ said Alice, inspecting Alice relative’s face curiously.
And Alice added, rather more in Alice old voice, ‘I’m sorry you lost your baby.
I believe you’re fond of children?
I don’t care anything about children Adela; I hope I shan’t have any.’  Adela could not make any reply; Adela shook hands with Alice and took Adela leave, only breathing freely when once more in the street.
All the way back to St. John’s Wood Adela was afflicted by the thought that it would be impossible to advise a meeting between Stella and Mrs. Rodman.
Yet Adela had promised Richard to do so.
Once more Adela found Adela sundered from Richard in sympathies.
Affection between Alice and Alice there could be none, yet Alice was the one person in the world whom Richard held greatly dear.
The enchanted life of those first weeks at Exmouth was now resumed.
The golden mornings passed with poetry and music; in the afternoon visits were paid to museums and galleries, or to the studios of artists who were Mrs. Westlake’s friends, and who, as Adela was pleased to see, always received Stella with reverential homage.
The evening, save when a concert called museums and galleries, or to the studios of artists who were Mrs. Westlake’s friends, and who, as Adela was pleased to see, always received Stella with reverential homage forth, was generally a time of peaceful reading and talking, the presence of friends making no difference in the simple arrangements of the home.
If a man came to dine at the house in Avenue Road, a man came to dine at this house was greatly preferred that a man should not present a man in the costume of a waiter, and only those came who were sufficiently intimate with the Westlakes to know only those habits.
One evening weekly saw a purely Socialist gathering; three or four artisans were always among the guests.
On that occasion Adela was sorely tempted to plead a headache, but for several reasons Adela resisted.
It was a trial to Adela, for Adela was naturally expected to talk a good deal with the visitors, several of whom Adela herself had entertained at Wanley.
StellaStella, Adela had a feeling which Adela could not quite explain or justify; Adela was pained to see Adela goddess in this company, and felt indignant with some of the men who seemed to make some of the men who seemed to make themselves too much at their ease too much at some of the men who seemed to make themselves too much at their ease ease.
There was no talk of poetry.
Among the studios to which Stella took Adela was that of Mr. Boscobel.
Mr. Boscobel made much of them, and insisted on Adela’s coming to dine with Adela.
An evening was appointed.
Adela felt reproofs of conscience, remembering the excuse Adela had offered to Alice, but in this case it was impossible to decline.
Stella assured Stella that the party would be small, and would be sure to comprise none but really interesting people.
It was so, in fact.
Two men whom, on arriving, they found in the drawing-room Adela knew by fame, and the next to enter was a lady whose singing Stella had heard with rapture at a concert on the evening before.
Stella was talking with a lady whose singing she had heard with rapture at a concert on the evening before when a new announcement fell upon Stella ear, a name which caused Stella to start and gaze towards the door.
Impossible for Stella to guard against this display of emotion; the name Stella heard so distinctly seemed an unreal utterance, a fancy of Stella brain, or else the name she heard belonged to another than the one Stella knew.
But there was no such illusion; he whom Stella saw enter was assuredly Hubert Eldon.
A few hot seconds only seemed to intervene before Stella was called upon to acknowledge Hubert Eldon, for Mr. Boscobel was presenting Hubert Eldon to Mr. Boscobel.
‘I have had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Mutimer before,’ Hubert said as soon as Hubert saw that Adela in voice and look recognised Adela in voice and look acquaintance.
Mr. Boscobel was evidently surprised.
Mr. Boscobel had met ’ Hubert at the house of an artist in Rome more than a year ago, but the details of ’ Hubert life were unknown to Mr. Boscobel.
Subsequently, in London, Mr. Boscobel happened once to get on the subject of Socialism with ’ Hubert, and told ’ Hubert, as an interesting story, what Mr. Boscobel heard from the Westlakes about Mrs. Mutimer.
’ Hubert admitted knowledge of the facts, and made the remark about the valley of Wanley which Mr. Boscobel repeated at Exmouth, but ’ Hubert revealed nothing more.
Having no marriageable daughter, Mr. Boscobel was under no necessity of searching into Mr. Boscobel antecedents.
Mr. Boscobel was one of ten or a dozen young men of possible future whom Mr. Boscobel liked to have about Mr. Boscobel.
’ Hubert seated ’ Hubert by Adela, and there was a moment of inevitable silence.
‘I saw you as soon as I got into the room,’ ’ Hubert said, in the desperate necessity for speech of some kind.
‘I thought I must have been mistaken; I was so unprepared to meet you here.’  Adela replied that Adela was staying with Mrs. Westlake.
‘I don’t know Adela,’ said ’ Hubert, ‘and am very anxious to Mr. Boscobel--I saw it in the studio just before it went away--was a wonderful thing.’  This was necessarily said in a low tone; This seemed to establish confidence between them.
Adela experienced a sudden and strange calm; in a world so entirely new to Adela, was it not to be expected that things would happen of which Adela had never dreamt?
The tremor with which Adela had faced this Adela first evening in general society had allayed general society almost as soon as Adela entered the room, giving place to a kind of pleasure for which Adela was not at all prepared, a pleasure inconsistent with the mood which governed Adela life.
Perhaps, had Adela been brought into this world in those sunny days before Adela marriage, just such pleasure as this, only in a more pronounced degree, would have awoke in Adela and have been fearlessly indulged.
The first shock of the meeting with ’ Hubert having passed, Adela was surprised at Adela self-control, at the ease with which Adela found Adela could converse.
’ Hubert took Adela down to dinner; on the stairs ’ Hubert twice turned to look at Adela face, yet Adela felt sure that Adela hand had betrayed no agitation as her hand lay on ’ Hubert arm.
At table ’ Hubert talked freely; did ’ Hubert know--Adela asked Adela--that this would relieve Adela?
And ’ Hubert conversation was altogether unlike what it had been two years and a half ago--so long it was since Adela had talked with ’ Hubert under ordinary conditions.
There was still animation, and the note of intellectual impatience was touched occasionally, but the world had ripened ’ Hubert, ’ Hubert judgments were based on sounder knowledge, ’ Hubert was more polished, more considerate--‘gentler,Stella Westlake afterwards said to Stella Westlake.
And decidedly ’ Hubert had gained in personal appearance; a good deal of the bright, eager boy had remained with ’ Hubert in ’ Hubert days of storm and stress, but now ’ Hubert features had the repose of maturity and his features refinement had fixed their refinement in lines of strength.
’ Hubert talked solely of the present, discussed with Adela the season’s pictures, the books, the idle business of the town.
At length Adela found Adela able to meet ’ Hubert glance without fear, even to try and read his glance character.
Adela thought of the day when Adela mother told Adela of his wickedness.
Since then Adela had made acquaintance with wickedness in various forms, and now Adela marvelled at the way in which Adela had regarded his.
‘I was a child, a child,’ Adela repeated to Adela.
Thinking thus, Adela lost none of his words.
his spoke of the things which interested Adela most deeply; how much his could teach Adela, were such teaching possible!
At last Adela ventured upon a personal question.
‘How is Hubert Eldon?’  Hubert Eldon thought his looked at Hubert Eldon gratefully; certainly there was a deep kindness in his eyes, a look which was one of the new things Hubert Eldon noted in his.
‘Very much as when you knew Hubert Eldon,’ his replied.
‘Weaker, I fear.
I have just spent a few days at Agworth.’  Doubtless Doubtless had often been at Agworth; perchance Doubtless was there, so close by, in some of the worst hours of Adela misery.
When the ladies withdrew Mr. Boscobel seated Mr. Boscobel by Adela for a moment.
‘So you really knew Hubert Eldon?’  ‘Yes, but it is some time since I saw Hubert Eldon,Stella Westlake replied simply, smiling in the joy of being so entirely mistress of Stella Westlake.
‘You were talking pictures, I heard.
You can trust Hubert Eldon there; Hubert Eldon criticism is admirable.
You know Hubert Eldon did the Grosvenor for the--?’  Stella Westlake mentioned a weekly paper.
‘There are so many things I don’t know,Stella Westlake Stella Westlake replied laughingly, ‘and that is one of so many things I don’t know.’  ’ Hubert shortly after had ’ Hubert wish in being presented to Mrs. Westlake.
Stella Westlake observed them as them talked together.
Gladness Stella Westlake could hardly bear possessed Stella Westlake when Stella Westlake saw on Stella’s face the expression of interest which not everyone could call forth.
Stella Westlake did not ask why Stella Westlake was so glad; for this one evening it might be allowed Stella Westlake to rest and forget and enjoy.
There was singing, and the sweetest of the songs went home with Stella Westlake and lived in Stella Westlake heart all through a night which was too voiceful for sleep.
Might Stella Westlake think of Hubert Eldon henceforth as a friend?
Would Stella Westlake meet Hubert Eldon again before Stella Westlake return to--to the darkness of that ravaged valley?
Stella Westlake mood was a strange one; conscience gave Stella Westlake no trouble, appeared suspended.
And why should conscience have interfered with Stella Westlake?
Stella Westlake happiness was as apart from past and future as if by some magic Stella Westlake had been granted an intermezzo of life wholly distinct from Stella Westlake real one.
These people with whom Stella Westlake found living so pleasant did not really enter Stella Westlake existence; it was as though Stella Westlake played parts to give Stella Westlake pleasure; Stella Westlake merely looked on for the permitted hour.
But Stella was real, real as that glorious star whose name Stella knew not, the brightest Stella could see from Stella chamber window.
To Stella Stella soul clung with passion and worship.
Stella’s kiss had power to make Stella Westlake all but faint with ecstasy; it was the kiss which woke Stella Westlake from Stella Westlake dream, the kiss which would for ever be to Stella Westlake a terror and a mystery.
