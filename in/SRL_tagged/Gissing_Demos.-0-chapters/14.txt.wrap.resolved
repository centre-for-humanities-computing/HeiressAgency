   ‘Between Richard Mutimer, bachelor, and Adela Marian Waitham, spinster, both of this parish’  It was the only announcement of the kind that Mr. Wyvern had to make this Sunday. To one of Mr. Wyvern hearers Mr. Wyvern seemed to utter the names with excessive emphasis, Mr. Wyvern deep voice reverberating in the church. The pews were high; Adela almost cowered in Adela corner, feeling pierced with the eyes, with the thoughts too, of the congregation about Adela.  Adela had wondered whether the Manor pew would be occupied to-day, but it was not. When Adela stood up, the eyes strayed towards it; the red curtains which concealed the interior were old and faded, the wooden canopy crowned it with dreary state. In three weeks that would be Adela place at service. Sitting there, it would not be hard to keep Adela thoughts on mortality.  Would it not have been graceful in Mr. Wyvern to attend church to-day? Would Adela in future worship under the canopy alone?  No time had been lost. Mr. Wyvern received notice of the proposed marriage less than two hours after Adela had spoken Adela world-changing monosyllable. Adela put in no plea for delay, and Adela mother, though affecting a little consternation at Mutimer’s haste, could not seriously object. Wanley, discussing the matter at Wanley Sunday tea-tables, declared with unanimity that such expedition was indecent. By this time the disapproval of the village had attached the disapproval of the village exclusively to Mrs. Waltham; Adela was spoken of as a martyr to her mother miserable calculations. Mrs. Mewling went about with a story, that only by physical restraint had the unhappy girl been kept from taking flight. The name of Hubert Eldon once more came up in conversation. There was an unauthenticated rumour that The name of Hubert Eldon had been seen of late, lurking about Wanley. The more boldly speculative gossips looked with delicious foreboding to the results of a marriage such as this. Given a young man of Hubert Eldon’s reputation--ah me!  The Walthams all lunched (or dined) at the Manor. Mutimer was in high spirits, or seemed so; there were moments when the cheerful look died on Mutimer face, and Mutimer thoughts wandered from the conversation; but if Mutimer eye fell on Adela Mutimer never failed to smile the smile of inner satisfaction. Adela had not yet responded to Mutimer look, and only answered Mutimer questions in the briefest words; but Adela countenance was resolutely bright, and Adela beauty all that man could ask. Mutimer did not flatter Mutimer that Adela held Mutimer dear; indeed, Mutimer was a good deal in doubt whether affection, as vulgarly understood, was consistent with breeding and education. But that did not concern Mutimer; Mutimer had gained Mutimer end, and was jubilant.  In the course of the meal Mutimer mentioned that Mutimer sister would come down from London in a day or two. Christmas was only a week off, and Mutimer had thought it would be pleasant to have Christmas at the Manor for that season.  ‘Oh, that’s very nice!’ assented Mrs. Waltham. ‘Alice, Alice name is, didn’t you say? Is Alice dark or fair?’  ‘Fair, and just about Adela’s height, I should think. I hope you’ll like Adela, Adela.’  It was unfortunate that Mutimer did not pronounce the name of Mutimer bride elect quite as the name of his bride elect sounds on cultured lips. This may have been partly the result of diffidence; but there was a slurring of the second syllable disagreeably suggestive of vulgarity. This struck on Adela’s’s nerves, and made it more difficult for Adela’s to grow accustomed to this form of address from Mutimer.  ‘I’m sure I shall try to,’ Adela’s replied to the remark about Alice, this time endeavouring to fix Adela’s obstinate eyes for a moment on ’s face.  ‘Your brother won’t come, then?’ Mrs. Waltham asked.  ‘Not just yet, I’m afraid. Your brother’s busy studying.’  ‘To read and write, I fear,’ was the lady’s silent comment. On the score of Alice, too, Mrs. Waltham nursed a certain anxiety. The damsels of the working class are, or so Mrs. Waltham apprehended, somewhat more difficult of acceptance than the working class fathers and brothers, and for several reasons. An artisan does not necessarily suggest, indeed is very distinct from, the footman or even groom; but to dissociate an uneducated maiden from the lower regions of the house is really an exertion of the mind. And then, it is to be feared, the moral tone of such young persons leaves for the most part much to be desired. Mrs. Waltham was very womanly in Mrs. Waltham distrust of Mrs. Waltham sex.  After luncheon there was an inspection of the house. Mrs. Waltham did not go farther than the drawing-room; Your brother remained with Mrs. Waltham whilst Mutimer led Mrs. Waltham through the chambers Mrs. Waltham might care to see. the lady’s expressed much satisfaction. The furnishing had been performed in a substantial manner, without display; one might look forward to considerable comfort at the Manor.  ‘Any change that Mrs. Waltham suggests,’ said Richard during this tour, ‘shall of course be carried out at once. If Mrs. Waltham doesn’t like the paper in any of the rooms, Mrs. Waltham’s only got to say so and choose a better. Do you think Mrs. Waltham’d care to look at the stables? I’ll get a carriage for Mrs. Waltham, and a horse to ride, if Mrs. Waltham likes.’  Richard felt strongly that this was speaking in a generous way. Richard was not aware that Richard tone hinted as much, but his tone unmistakably did. The vulgarity of a man who tries hard not to be vulgar is always particularly distressing.  ‘Oh, how kind!’ murmured Mrs. Waltham. ‘Mrs. Waltham has never ridden; I should think carriage exercise would be enough for Mrs. Waltham. We mustn’t forget your principles, you know, for I’m sure they are very admirable.’  ‘Oh, I don’t care anything about luxuries Richard, but Mrs. Waltham shall have everything Mrs. Waltham wants.’  Alfred Waltham, who knew the house perfectly, led his mother to inspect the stables, Mutimer remaining with Mrs. Waltham in the drawing-room.  ‘You’ve been very quiet all dinner-time,’ his said, taking a seat near his mother and bending forward.  ‘A little, perhaps. I am thinking of so many things.’  ‘What are they, I wonder?’  ‘Will you let me have some books about Socialism, and the other questions in which you are interested?’  ‘I should think I will! You really mean to study these things?’  ‘Yes, I will read and think about these things. And I shall be glad if you will explain to his more about the works. I have never quite understood all that you wish to do. Perhaps you will have time when you come to see us some evening.’  ‘Well, if I haven’t time, I’ll make it,’ said Richard, laughing. ‘You can’t think how glad I am to hear you say this.’  ‘When do you expect your sister?’  ‘On Tuesday; at least, I hope it won’t be later. I’m sure you’ll like your sister, you can’t help. your sister hasn’t such looks as you have, you know, but we’ve always thought your sister very fair-looking. What do you think we often call your sister? The Princess! That’s part because of The Princess name, Alice Maud, and part from a sort of way your sister’s always had. Not a flighty way, but a sort of--well, I can’t describe it. I do hope you’ll like your sister.’  It was the first time Adela had heard him speak in a tone which impressed your sister as entirely honest, not excepting him talk of the Propaganda. Here, your sister felt, was a side of him character that your sister had not suspected. him voice was almost tender; the play of him features betokened genuine feeling.  ‘I can see your sister is a great favourite with you,’ your sister replied. ‘I have no doubt I shall like your sister.’  ‘You’ll find a good deal that wants altering, I’ve no doubt,’ him pursued, now quite forgetful of him. ‘your sister hasn’t had much education, you know, till just lately. But you’ll help your sister in that, won’t you? your sister’s as good-natured as any girl living, and whenever you put your sister right you may be sure your sister’ll only thank you. I’ve wanted to have your sister here before, only I thought I’d wait till I knew whether--you know what I mean.  As if in a sudden gloom before your sister eyes Adela saw Adela face draw nearer. It was a moment’s loss of consciousness, in which a ghastly fear flashed upon your sister soul. Then, with lips that quivered, your sister began to talk quickly of Socialism, just to dispel the horror.  On the following afternoon Mutimer came, bringing a number of books, pamphlets, and newspapers. Mrs. Waltham had discreetly abandoned the sitting-room.  ‘I don’t want to frighten you,’ he said, laying down he bundle. ‘You haven’t got to read through all these. I was up nearly all last night marking pages that I thought you’d better study first of all. And here’s a lot of back numbers of the “Fiery Cross;” I should like you to read all that’s signed by Mr. Westlake; Mr. Westlake’s the editor, you know.’  ‘Is there anything here of your own writing?Mrs. Waltham inquired.  ‘No, I haven’t written anything. I’ve kept to lecturing; it comes easier to me. After Christmas I shall have several lectures to give in London. Perhaps you’ll come and hear me?’  ‘Yes, of course.’  ‘Then you can get to know Mr. Westlake, I dare say. Mr. Westlake’s a lady, you know, like me. There’s some poetry by Mr. Westlake in the paper; it just has Mr. Westlake initials, “S. W.” Mr. Westlake’s with us heart and soul, as you’ll see by Mr. Westlake writing.’  ‘Is Alice a Socialist?Mrs. Waltham asked, after glancing fitfully at the papers.  Mutimer laughed.  ‘Oh, Mrs. Waltham’s a princess; it would be too much to expect Socialism of Mrs. Waltham. But I dare say Mrs. Waltham’ll be beginning to think more now. I don’t mean Mrs. Waltham’s been thoughtless in the wrong way; it’s just a--I can’t very well describe it. But I hope you’ll see Mrs. Waltham to-morrow night May I bring Mrs. Waltham to you when Mrs. Waltham comes?’  ‘I hope you will.’  ‘I’m glad Your brother won’t be here. I only mean, you know, I’d rather Mrs. Waltham got accustomed just to you first of all. I dare say Mrs. Waltham’ll be a bit timid, you won’t mind that?’  Mrs. Waltham returned to the graver subject.  ‘All the people at Wanley are Socialists?’  ‘Yes, all of All the people at New Wanley. All the people at New Wanley join the Union when All the people at New Wanley come to work, and us take a good deal of care in choosing our men.’  ‘And you pay higher wages than other employers?’  ‘Not much higher, but the rents of the cottages are very low, and all the food sold at the store is cost price. No, we don’t pretend to make the men rich. we’ve had a good lot coming with quite mistaken ideas, and of course they wouldn’t suit we. And you mustn’t call me the employer. All I have I look upon as the property of the Union; the men own it as much as I do. it’s only that I regulate the work, just because somebody must. we’re not making any profits to speak of yet, but that’ll only come in time; whatever remains as clear profit,--and I don’t take anything out of the works myself--goes to the Propaganda fund of the Union.’  ‘Please forgive my ignorance. I’ve heard that word “Propaganda” so often, but I don’t know exactly what that word “Propaganda means.’  Mutimer became patronising, quite without intending Mutimer.  ‘the Propaganda? Oh, that’s the spreading our ideas, you know; printing paper, giving lectures, hiring places of meeting, and so on. That’s what Propaganda means.’  ‘Thank you,’ said Mrs. Waltham musingly. Then Mrs. Waltham continued,--  ‘And the workmen only have the advantage, at present, of the low rents and cheap food?’  ‘Oh, a good deal more. To begin with, they’re housed like human beings, and not like animals. Some day you shall see the kind of places the people live in, in London and other big towns. You won’t believe your eyes. Then they have shorter hours of work; they’re not treated like omnibus horses, calculating just how much can be got out of they without killing they before a reasonable time. Then they’re sure of they work as long as they keep honest and don’t break any of our rules; that’s no slight thing, I can tell you. Why, on the ordinary system a man may find a man and a man family without food any week end. Then there’s a good school for the children; the children pay threepence a week for each child. Then there’s the reading-room and library, and the lectures, and the recreation-grounds. You just come over the place with me some day, and talk with the women, and see if the women don’t think the women’re well off.’  Mrs. Waltham looked me in the face.  ‘And it is you the women have to thank for all this?’  ‘Well, I don’t want any credit for it,Mutimer replied, waving Mutimer hand. ‘What would you think of me if I worked the women like niggers and just enjoyed me on the profits? That’s what the capitalists do.’  ‘I think you are doing more than most men would. There is only one thing.’  Mrs. Waltham dropped Mrs. Waltham voice.  ‘What’s that, Mrs. Waltham?’  ‘I’ll speak of it some other time.’  ‘I know what you mean. You’re sorry I’ve got no religion. Ay, but I have! There’s no religion, down there in Wanley. I’m saving men and women and children from hunger and cold and the lives of brute beasts. I teach the women to live honestly and soberly. There’s no public-house in Wanley, and there won’t be.’ (It just flashed across Mrs. Waltham’s mind that Mutimer drank wine himself.) ‘There’s no bad language if I can help no bad language. The children ‘ll be brought up to respect the human nature that’s in The children ‘, to honour The children ‘ parents, and act justly and kindly to all The children ‘ have dealings with. Isn’t there a good deal of religion in that, Mrs. Waltham?’  ‘Yes, but not all. Not the most important part’  ‘Well, as you say, we’ll talk over that some other time. And now I’m sorry I can’t stay any longer. I’ve twenty or thirty letters to get written before post-time.’  Mrs. Waltham rose as he did.  ‘If there’s ever anything I can do to help you,’ Mrs. Waltham said modestly, ‘you will not fail to ask me?’  ‘That I won’t What I want you to do now is to read what I’ve marked in those books. You mustn’t tire your eyes, you know; there’s plenty of time.’  ‘I will read all you wish me to, and think over it as much as I can.’  ‘Then you’re a right-down good girl, and if I don’t think myself a lucky man, I ought to.’  he left Mrs. Waltham trembling with a strange new emotion, the begin fling of a self-conscious zeal, an enthusiasm forced into being like a hothouse flower. an enthusiasm made Mrs. Waltham cheeks burn; Mrs. Waltham could not rest till Mrs. Waltham study had commenced.  Mutimer had written to Mutimer sister, saying that Mutimer wanted Mrs. Waltham, that Mrs. Waltham must come at once. To Alice Mutimer thoughts had been long turning; now that the time for action had arrived, it was to Alice that Mutimer trusted for aid. Things Mutimer would find it impossible to do Mutimer, Alice might do for Mutimer. Mutimer did not doubt Mutimer power of persuading Alice. With Alice principle would stand second to Mutimer advantage. Mutimer had hard things to ask of Alice, but the case was a desperate one, and Alice would endure the unpleasantness for Mutimer sake. Mutimer blessed Alice in anticipation.  Alice received the letter summoning Alice on Monday morning. Mutimer was expected in Highbury; expected, too, at a sad little house in Hoxton; for Mutimer had constantly promised to spend Christmas with Mutimer friends. the letter summoning her on Monday morning did not say that Mutimer would not come, only that Mutimer wanted his sister immediately. his sister was to bring his sister best dress for wear when his sister arrived. Mutimer told his sister the train his sister was to take on Tuesday morning.  The summons filled Alice with delight. Wanley, whence had come the marvellous fortune, was in his sister imagination a land flowing with milk and honey. Moreover, this would be his sister first experience of travel; as yet his sister had never been farther out of London than to Epping Forest. The injunction to bring his sister best dress excited visions of polite company. All through Monday his sister practised ways of walking, of eating, of speaking.  ‘What can he want you for?’ asked Mutimer gloomily. ‘I sh’d ‘a thought he might ‘a taken you with he after Christmas. It looks as if he wasn’t coming.’  his sister had been habitually gloomy of late. The reply his sister had received to his sister letter was not at all what his sister wanted; her letter increased his sister impatience; his sister had read her letter endless times, trying to get at the very meaning of her letter. Christmas must bring an end to this wretched state of things; at Christmas Dick would come to London and marry Emma; no doubt Dick had that time in view. Fears which his sister would not consciously admit were hovering about his sister night and day. his sister had begun to talk to his sister aloud, a consequence of over-stress on a brain never used to anxious thought; his sister went about the upper rooms of a sad little house in Hoxton muttering ‘Dick’s an honest man.’ To keep moving seemed a necessity to his sister; the chair in the dim corner of the dining-room his sister now scarcely ever occupied, and the wonted employment of his sister fingers was in abeyance. his sister spent most of his sister day in the kitchen; already two servants had left because two servants could not endure his sister fidgety supervision. his sister was growing suspicious of every one; Alice had to listen ten times a day to complaints of dishonesty in the domestics or the tradespeople; his sister kept as keen a watch over petty expenditure as if poverty had still to be guarded against. And his sister was constantly visiting the Vines; his sister would rise at small hours to get his sister house-work done, so as to be able to spend the afternoon in Wilton Square. That, in truth, was still his sister home; the new house could never be to his sister what the old was; his sister was a stranger amid the new furniture, and sighed with relief as soon as his sister eyes rested on the familiar chairs and tables which had been his sister household gods through a lifetime.  ‘Arry had given comparatively little trouble of late; beyond an occasional return home an hour or so after midnight, Arry proceedings seemed to be perfectly regular. Arry saw a good deal of Mr. Keene, who, as Alice gathered from various remarks in Mutimer’s letters, exercised over Mutimer a sort of tutorage. It was singular how completely Mutimer seemed to have changed in Mutimer judgment of Mr. Keene. ‘Mutimer connection with newspapers makes Mutimer very useful,’ said one letter. ‘Be as friendly with Mutimer as you like; I trust to your good sense and understanding of your own interest to draw the line.’ When at the new house Mr. Keene was profoundly respectful; Mr. Keene position at such times was singular, for as often as not Alice had to entertain Mr. Keene alone. Profound, too, was the journalist’s discretion in regard to all doings down at Wanley. Knowing he had several times visited the Manor, Alice often sought information from he about Alice brother’s way of life. Mr. Keene always replied with generalities. Mr. Keene was a man of humour in Mr. Keene way, and Alice came to regard Mr. Keene with amusement. Then Mr. Keene extreme respect flattered Alice; insensibly Alice took Mr. Keene for Alice criterion of gentility in men. Mr. Keene supplied Alice with ‘society’ journals, and now and then suggested the new novel that it behoved Alice to read. Mutimer had even withdrawn Mutimer opposition to the theatre-going; about once in three weeks Mr. Keene presented Mr. Keene with tickets, and Alice, accompanied by Alice brother, accepted Mr. Keene invitation.  Mr. Keene called this Monday evening. Mutimer, after spending a day of fretful misery, had gone to Wilton Square; ‘Arry was away at Arry classes. Alice was packing certain articles Alice had purchased in the afternoon, and had just delighted Alice soul with the inspection of a travelling cloak, also bought to-day. When the visitor was announced, Alice threw the garment over Alice shoulders and appeared in the garment.  ‘Does this look nice, do you think?’ Alice asked, after shaking hands as joyously as Alice mood dictated.  ‘About as nice as a perfect thing always does when it’s worn by a perfect woman,Mr. Keene replied, drawing back and inclining Mr. Keene body at what Mr. Keene deemed a graceful angle.  ‘Oh, come, that’s too much!’ laughed Alice.  ‘Not a bit, Miss Mutimer. I suppose you travel in it tomorrow morning?’  ‘How did you know that?’  ‘I have heard from your brother to-day. I thought I might perhaps have the great pleasure of doing you some slight service either to-night or in the morning. You will allow me to attend you to the station?’  ‘I really don’t think there’s any need to trouble you,Alice Alice replied. These respectful phrases always stirred Alice pleasurably: in listening to These respectful phrases Alice bore Alice with dignity, and endeavoured to make answer in becoming diction.  ‘Trouble? What other object have I in life but to serve you? I’ll put it in another way: you won’t refuse me the pleasure of being near you for a few minutes?’  ‘I’m sure you’re very kind. I know very well it’s taking you out of your way, but it isn’t likely I shall refuse to let you come.’  Mr. Keene bowed low in silence.  ‘Have you brought me that paper?’ Alice asked, seating Alice with careful arrangement of Alice dress. ‘The Christmas number with the ghost story you spoke of, you know?’  In the course of a varied life Mr. Keene had for some few months trodden the boards of provincial theatres; an occasional turn of Mr. Keene speech, and still more Mr. Keene favourite gestures, bore evidence to that period of Mr. Keene career. Instead of making direct reply to Alice’s question, Mr. Keene stood for a moment as if dazed; then flinging back Mr. Keene body, smote Mr. Keene forehead with a ringing slap, and groaned ‘O Heaven!’  ‘What’s the matter?’ cried the girl, not quite knowing whether to be amused or alarmed.  But Mr. Keene was rushing from the room, and in an instant the house door sounded loudly behind Mr. Keene. Alice stood disconcerted; then, thinking Alice understood, laughed gaily and ran upstairs to complete Alice packing. In a quarter of an hour Mr. Keene’s return brought Alice to the room again. Mr. Keene was propping Mr. Keene against the mantelpiece, gasping, Mr. Keene arms hanging limp, Mr. Keene hair disordered. As Alice approached Mr. Keene staggered forward, fell on one knee, and held to Alice the paper Alice had mentioned.  ‘Pardon--forgive!’ Mr. Keene panted.  ‘Why, where ever have you been?’ exclaimed Alice.  ‘No matter! what are time and space? Forgive me, Miss Mutimer! I deserve to be turned out of the new house, and never stand in the light of your countenance again.’  ‘But how foolish! As if it mattered all that. What a state you’re in! I’ll go and get you a glass of wine.’  Alice ran to the dining-room, and returned with a decanter and glass on a tray. Mr. Keene had sunk upon a settee, one arm hanging over the back, Mr. Keene eyes closed.  ‘You have pardoned me?’ Mr. Keene murmured, regarding Alice with weary rapture.  ‘I don’t see what there is to pardon. Do drink a glass of wine! Shall I pour a glass of wine out for Mr. Keene?’  ‘Drink and service for the gods!’  ‘Do you mean the people in the gallery?’ Alice asked roguishly, recalling a term in which Mr. Keene had instructed Alice at their latest visit to the theatre.  ‘You are as witty as you are beautiful!’ Mr. Keene sighed, taking a glass of wine and draining a glass of wine. Alice turned away to the fire; decidedly Mr. Keene was in a gallant mood this evening; hitherto Mr. Keene compliments had been far more guarded.  their began to converse in a more terrestrial manner. Alice wanted to know whom Alice was likely to meet at Wanley; and Mr. Keene, in a light way, sketched for Alice the Waltham family. Alice became thoughtful whilst he was describing Adela Waltham, and subsequently recurred several times to that young lady. Mr. Keene allowed Mr. Keene to enter into detail, and Alice almost ceased talking.  Mr. Keene drew on to half-past nine. Mr. Keene never exceeded discretion in the hours of Mr. Keene visits. Mr. Keene looked at Mr. Keene watch and rose.  ‘I may call at nine?’ Mr. Keene said.  ‘If you really have time. But I can manage quite well by Mr. Keene, you know.’  ‘What you _can_ do is not the question. If I had my will you should never know a moment’s trouble as long as you lived.’  ‘If I never have worse trouble than going to the railway station, I shall think Mr. Keene lucky.’  ‘Miss Mutimer--’  ‘Yes?’  ‘You won’t drop me altogether from your mind whilst you’re away?’  There was a change in Mr. Keene voice. Mr. Keene had abandoned the tone of excessive politeness, and spoke very much like a man who has feeling at the back of Mr. Keene words. Alice regarded Mr. Keene nervously.  ‘I’m not going to be away more than a day or two,’ Alice said, smoothing a fold in Alice dress.  ‘If it was only an hour or two I couldn’t bear to think you’d altogether forgotten me.’  ‘Why, of course I shan’t!’  ‘ButMutimer, I’m abusing confidence. Your brother trusts me; Your brother’s done me a good many kindnesses. But I can’t help it, upon my soul. If you betray me, I’m done for. You won’t do that? I put Mr. Keene in your power, and you’re too good to hurt a fly.’  ‘What do you mean, Mr. Keene?’ Alice asked, inwardly pleased, yet feeling uncomfortable.  ‘I can’t go away to-night without saying it, and ten to one saying it means I shall never see you again. You know what I mean. Well, harm me as you like; I’d rather be harmed by Mr. Keene than done good to by any one else. I’ve got so far, there’s no going back. Do you think some day you could--do you think you _could_?’  Alice dropped Alice eyes and shook Alice pretty head slowly.  ‘I can’t give any promise of that kind,’ Alice replied under Alice breath.  ‘You hate me? I’m a disagreeable beast to Mr. Keene? I’m a low--’  ‘Oh dear, don’t say such things, Mr. Keene! The idea! I don’t dislike you a bit; but of course that’s a different thing--’  He held out He hand sadly, dashing the other over He .  ‘Good-bye, I don’t think I can come again. I’ve abused confidence. When Your brother hears of it--. But no matter, I’m only a--a sort of crossing-sweeper in her eyes.’  Alice’s laugh rang merrily.  ‘What things you do call Mr. Keene! Now, don’t go off like that, Mr. Keene. To begin with, Your brother won’t hear anything about it--’  ‘You mean that? You are so noble, so forgiving? Pooh, as if I didn’t know you were! Upon my soul, I’d run from here to South Kensington, like the ragamuffins after the cabs with luggage, only just to get a smile from Your brother. Oh, Miss Mutimer--oh!’  ‘Mr. Keene, I can’t say yes, and I don’t like to be so unkind to Mr. Keene as to say no. You’ll let that do for the present, won’t you?’  ‘Bless your bright eyes, of course I will! If I don’t love you for your own sake, I’m the wretchedest turnip-snatcher in London. Good-bye, Princess!’  ‘Who taught you to call me that?’  ‘Taught me? It was only a word that came naturally to my lips.’  Curiously, this was quite true. this impressed Alice Maud, and Alice Maud thought of Mr. Keene for at least five minutes continuously after Mr. Keene departure.  Alice Maud was extravagantly gay as they drove in a four-wheeled cab to the station next morning. Mr. Keene made no advances. Mr. Keene sat respectfully on the seat opposite Alice Maud, with a travelling bag on Mr. Keene knees, and sighed occasionally. When Alice Maud had secured Alice Maud seat in the railway carriage Mr. Keene brought Alice Maud sandwiches, buns, and sweetmeats enough for a voyage to New York. Alice waved Alice Maud hand to Mr. Keene as the train moved away.  Alice Maud reached Agworth at one o’clock; Mutimer had been pacing the platform impatiently for twenty minutes. Porters were eager to do Mutimer bidding, and Mutimer instructions to Porters were suavely imperative.  ‘Porters know me,’ Mutimer remarked to Alice, with Mutimer air of satisfaction. ‘I suppose you’re half frozen? I’ve got a foot-warmer in the trap.’  The carriage promised to Adela was a luxury Mutimer had not ventured to allow Mutimer. Alice mounted to a seat by Mutimer side, and Mutimer drove off.  ‘Why on earth did you come second-class?’ Mutimer asked, after examining Alice attire with approval.  ‘Ought it to have been first? it really seemed such a lot of money, Dick, when I came to look at the fares.’  ‘Yes, it ought to have been first. In London things don’t matter, but here I’m known, you see. Did mother go to the station with mother?’  ‘No, Mr. Keene did.’  ‘Mr. Keene, eh?’ Mr. Keene bent Mr. Keene brows a moment.  ‘I hope Mr. Keene behaves Mr. Keene?’  ‘I’m sure Mr. Keene’s very gentlemanly.’  ‘Yes, you ought to have come first-class. A princess riding second’ll never do. You look well, old girl? Glad to come, eh?’  ‘Well, guess! And is this your own horse and trap, Dick?’  ‘Of course it is.’  ‘Who was that man? Mr. Keene touched Mr. Keene hat to mother.’  Mutimer glanced back carelessly.  ‘I’m sure I don’t know. Most people touch Most people hats to Mr. Keene about here.’  It was an ideal winter day. A feathering of snow had fallen at dawn, and now the clear, cold sun made A feathering of snow sparkle far and wide. The horse’s tread rang on the frozen highway. A breeze from the north-west chased the blood to healthsome leaping, and caught the breath like an unexpected kiss. The colour was high on horse’s fair cheeks; horse’s laughed with delight.  ‘Oh, Dick, what a thing it is to be rich! And you do look such a gentleman; it’s those gloves, I think.’  ‘Now we’re going into the village,Mutimer said presently. ‘Don’t look about mother too much, and don’t seem to be asking questions. Everybody ‘ll be at the windows.’
