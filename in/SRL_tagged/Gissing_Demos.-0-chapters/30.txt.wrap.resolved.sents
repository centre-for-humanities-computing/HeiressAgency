   The valley rested.
On the morning of Mutimer’s departure from Wanley there was no wonted clank of machinery, no smoke from the chimneys, no roar of iron-smelting furnaces; the men and women of the colony stood idly before the men and women of the colony houses, discussing prospects, asking each other whether it was seriously Mr. EldonMutimer’s intention to raze New Wanley, many of them grumbling or giving vent to revolutionary threats.
them had continued in work thus long since the property in fact changed hands, and to most of them it seemed unlikely, in spite of every thing, that them would have to go in search of new employments.
This morning them would hear finally.
The valley rested.
For several days there had been constant rain; though summer was scarcely over,    The valley had turned cold and the sky was cheerless.
Over Stanbury Hill there were always heavy, dripping clouds, and the leaves of Adela’s favourite wood were already falling.
At the Manor there was once more disorder; before Mutimer and Mutimer wife took Mutimer and his wife departure the removal of furniture had commenced.
Over the whole scene brooded a spirit of melancholy.
the whole scene needed faith in human energy to imagine the pollutions swept away, and the seasons peacefully gliding as of old between the hillsides and amid meadows and garden closes.
Hubert Eldon drove over from Agworth, and was in the Public Hall at the appointed time.
Hubert Eldon business with the men was simple and brief.
Hubert Eldon had to inform the men that the men employment here was at an end, but that each one would receive a month’s wages and permission to inhabit the men present abodes for yet a fortnight.
After that the men had no longer right of tenancy.
Hubert Eldon added that if any man considered Hubert Eldon specially aggrieved by this arrangement, Hubert Eldon was prepared to hear and judge the individual case.
There was a murmur of discontent through the room, but no one took upon Hubert Eldon to rise and become spokesman of the community.
Disregarding the manifestation, Hubert Eldon described in a few words how and when His business with the men would be transacted; then Hubert Eldon left the Public Hall by the door which led from the platform.
Then followed a busy week.
Claims of all kinds were addressed to Hubert Eldon, some reasonable, most of some not to be entertained.
Mr. Yottle was constantly at the Manor; there Mr. Yottle and Hubert Eldon held a kind of court.
Hubert Eldon was not well fitted for business of this nature; Hubert Eldon easily became impatient, and, in spite of humane intentions, often suffered from a tumult of Hubert Eldon blood, when opposed by some dogged mechanic.
‘I can’t help it!’ Hubert Eldon exclaimed to Mr. Wyvern one right, after a day of peculiar annoyance.
‘We are all men, it is true; but for the brotherhood--feel the brotherhood who can!
I am illiberal, if you like, but in the presence of those fellows I feel that I am facing enemies.
It seems to Hubert Eldon that I have nothing in common with those fellows but the animal functions.
Absurd?
Yes, of course, it is absurd; but I speak of how intercourse with those fellows affects me.
those fellows are our enemies, yours as well as mine; those fellows are the enemies of every man who speaks the pure English tongue and does not earn a living with his hands.
When those fellows face me I understand what revolution means; some of those fellows look at Hubert Eldon as some of them would if some of them had muskets in some of them hands.’  ‘You are not conciliating,’ remarked the vicar.
‘I am not, and cannot be.
some of them stir the worst feelings in Hubert Eldon; I grow arrogant, autocratic.
As long as I have no private dealings with some of them I can consider some of them hardships and judge some of them characters dispassionately; but I must not come to close quarters.’  ‘You have special causes of prejudice.’  ‘True.
If I were a philosopher I should overcome all that.
However, my prejudice is good in one way; my prejudice enables me thoroughly to understand the detestation with which they regard me and the like of Hubert Eldon.
If I had been born one of they I should be the most savage anarchist.
The moral is, that I must hold apart.
Perhaps I shall grow cooler in time.’  The special causes of prejudice were quite as strong on the side of the workmen; Hubert might have been far less aristocratic in bearing, they would have disliked Hubert as cordially.
Most of they took it as a wanton outrage that they should be driven from the homes in which they had believed they settled for life.
The man Redgrave--he of the six feet two who had presented the address to Mutimer--was a powerful agent of ill-feeling; during the first few days The man Redgrave--he of the six feet two who had presented the address to Mutimer-- was constantly gathering impromptu meetings in New Wanley and haranguing them violently on the principles of Socialism.
But in less than a week The man Redgrave--he of the six feet two who had presented the address to Mutimer-- had taken The man Redgrave--he of the six feet two who had presented the address to Mutimer-- departure, and the main trouble seemed at an end.
Mrs. Eldon was so impatient to return to the Manor that a room was prepared for Mrs. Eldon as soon as possible, and Mrs. Eldon came from Mrs. Eldon house at Agworth before Mutimer had been gone a week.
Through the summer Mrs. Eldon strength had failed rapidly; it was Mrs. Eldon own conviction that Mrs. Eldon could live but a short time longer.
The extreme agitation caused by the discovery of the will had visibly enfeebled Mrs. Eldon; it was Mrs. Eldon one desire to find Mrs. Eldon once more in Mrs. Eldon old home, and there to breathe Mrs. Eldon last.
The journey from Agworth cost Mrs. Eldon extreme suffering; Mrs. Eldon was prostrate, almost lifeless, for three days after it.
But Mrs. Eldon son’s society revived Mrs. Eldon.
Knowing her son’s established in her son’s family possessions, Mrs. Eldon only cared to taste for a little while this unhoped-for joy.
Lying on a couch in Mrs. Eldon familiar chamber, Mrs. Eldon delighted to have flowers brought to Mrs. Eldon from the garden, even leaves from the dear old trees, every one of which Mrs. Eldon knew as a friend.
But Mrs. Eldon had constant thought for those upon whose disaster Mrs. Eldon own happiness was founded; of Adela Mrs. Eldon spoke often.
‘What will become of that poor child?’ Mrs. Eldon asked one evening, when Hubert had been speaking of Rodman’s impracticable attitude, and of the proceedings Mutimer was about to take.
‘Do you know anything of Mrs. Eldon life, Hubert?’  ‘I met Mrs. Eldon in the wood here a few weeks ago,’ Hubert replied, mentioning the incident for the first time.
‘Mrs.
Eldon wanted to make a Socialist of Hubert.’  ‘Was that after the will came to light?’  ‘The day after.
Mrs. Eldon pleaded for New Wanley--hoped I should keep New Wanley up.’  ‘Then Mrs. Eldon has really accepted Mrs. Eldon husband’s views?’  ‘It seems so.
I am afraid Mrs. Eldon thought me an obstinate tyrant.’  Hubert spoke carelessly.
‘But Mrs. Eldon must not suffer, dear.
How can they be helped?’  ‘they can’t fall into absolute want.
And I suppose Hubert Socialist friends will do something for Hubert.
I have been as considerate as it was possible to be.
I dare say Hubert will make me a commonplace in Hubert lectures henceforth, a type of the brutal capitalist.’  Hubert laughed when Hubert had said it, and led the conversation to another subject.
About the workmen, too, Mrs. Eldon was kindly thoughtful.
Hubert spared Mrs. Eldon Hubert prejudices and merely described what Hubert was doing.
Mrs. Eldon urged Hubert to be rather too easy than too exacting with them.
It was the same in everything; the blessing which had fallen upon Mrs. Eldon made Mrs. Eldon full of gentleness and sweet charity.
The fortnight’s grace was at an end, and The fortnight’s grace was announced to Hubert that the last family had left New Wanley.
The rain still continued; as evening set in Hubert returned from an inspection of the deserted colony, Hubert spirits weighed upon by the scene of desolation.
After dinner Hubert sat as usual with Hubert mother for a couple of hours, then went to Hubert own room and read till eleven o’clock.
Just as Hubert had thrown aside Hubert book the silence of the night was riven by a terrific yell, a savage cry of many voices, which came from the garden in the front of the house, and at the same instant there sounded a great crashing of glass.
The windows behind Hubert back were broken and a couple of heavy missiles thundered near Hubert upon the floor--stones they proved to be.
Hubert rushed from his own room.
All the lights in the house except Hubert own and that in Mrs. Eldonhis own room were extinguished.
Hubert reached his mother.
Before Hubert could open it the yell and the shower of stones were repeated, again with ruin of windows, this time on the east side of the Manor.
In a moment Hubert was by his mother’s bed; Hubert saw his mother sitting up in terror; his mother was speechless and unable even to stretch his mother arms towards Hubert.
An inner door opened and the woman who was always in attendance rushed in half dressed.
At the same time there were sounds of movement in other parts of the house.
Once more the furious voices and the stone-volley Hubert put the stone-volley Hubert about the stone-volley Hubert and tried to calm his mother.
‘Don’t be frightened; it’s those cowardly roughs.
They have had They three shots, now They’ll take to They heels.
Mrs. Winter is here, his mother: his mother will stay with his mother whilst I go down and see what has to be done.
I’ll be back directly if there is no more danger.’  the stone-volley Hubert hastened away.
The servants had collected upon the front staircase, with lamps and candles, in fright and disorder unutterable.
Hubert Eldon repeated to The servants what Hubert Eldon had said to his mother, and it seemed to be the truth, for the silence outside was unbroken.
‘I shouldn’t wonder,’ Hubert Eldon cried, ‘if The servants’ve made an attempt to set the house on fire.
We must go about and examine.’  The door-bell was rung loudly.
The servants rushed back up the stairs; Hubert Eldon went into his own room, carrying no light, and called through the shattered windows asking who had rung.
It was the vicar; the shouts had brought Hubert Eldon forth.
‘The servants are gone,’ Hubert Eldon said, in Hubert Eldon strong, deep voice, in his strong, deep voice reassuring.
‘I think there were only some ten or a dozen; The servants’ve made off up the hill.
Is anybody hurt?’  ‘No, The servants have only broken all the windows,Hubert Eldon Hubert Eldon replied.
‘But I am terribly afraid for the effect upon his mother.
We must have the doctor round at once.’  the vicar was admitted to the house, and a messenger forthwith despatched for the medical man, who resided halfway between Wanley and Agworth.
On returning to Hubert Eldon mother’s room Hubert Eldon found Hubert Eldon fears only too well justified; Mrs. Eldon lay motionless, Mrs. Eldon eyes open, but seemingly without intelligence.
At intervals of five minutes a sigh was audible, else Mrs. Eldon could scarcely be perceived to breathe.
The attendant said that Mrs. Eldon had not spoken.
It was some time before the doctor arrived.
After a brief examination, the doctor came out with Hubert Eldon; the doctor opinion was that the sufferer would not see daybreak.
Mrs. Eldon lived, however, for some twelve hours, if that could be called life which was only distinguishable from the last silence by the closest scrutiny.
Hubert Eldon did not move from the bedside, and from time to time Mr. Wyvern came and sat with Mr. Wyvern.
Neither of that spoke.
Hubert Eldon had no thought of food or rest; the shadow of a loss, of which Hubert Eldon only understood the meaning now that it was at hand, darkened Hubert Eldon and all the world.
Behind Hubert Eldon voiceless misery was immeasurable hatred of those who had struck Hubert Eldon this blow; at moments a revengeful fury all but maddened Hubert Eldon.
Hubert Eldon held Hubert Eldon mother’s band; if Hubert Eldon could but feel one pressure of the slight fingers before they were impotent for ever!
And this much was granted Hubert Eldon.
Shortly before midday her eyes trembled to consciousness, the lips moved in endeavour to speak.
To Hubert Eldon it seemed that Hubert Eldon intense gaze had worked a miracle, effecting that which Hubert Eldon will demanded.
Mother saw Hubert Eldon and understood.
‘Mother, can you speak?
Do you know me, dear?’  Mother smiled, and Mother lips tried to shape words.
Hubert Eldon bent over Mother, close, close.
At first the faint whisper was unintelligible, then Hubert Eldon heard:  ‘They did not know what They were doing.’  Something followed, but Hubert Eldon could not understand it.
the faint whisper ended in a sigh, the smiling features quivered.
Hubert Eldon held Mother, but was alone.
A hand was laid gently upon Hubert Eldon shoulder.
Through blinding tears Hubert Eldon discerned Mr. Wyvern’s solemn countenance.
Mr. Wyvern resisted the efforts to draw Mr. Wyvern away, but was at length persuaded.
Early in the evening Mr. Wyvern fell asleep, lying dressed upon Mr. Wyvern bed, and the sleep lasted till midnight.
Then Mr. Wyvern left Mr. Wyvern , and descended the stairs, for the lower part of the house was still lighted.
In the hall Mr. Wyvern met Mr. Wyvern.
‘Let us go into the library,’ Mr. Wyvern said to the clergyman.
‘I want to talk to the clergyman.’  the clergyman had resumed the clergyman ordinary manner.
Without mention of the clergyman , the clergyman began at once to speak of the rioters.
‘They were led by that man Redgrave; there can be no doubt of that.
I shall go to Agworth at once and set the police at work.’  ‘I have already done that,’ replied the vicar.
‘Three fellows have been arrested in Agworth.’  ‘New Wanley men?’  ‘Yes; but that man Redgrave is not one of New Wanley men.’  ‘He shall be caught, though!’  Hubert Eldon appeared to have forgotten everything but Hubert Eldon desire of revenge.
It supported Hubert Eldon through the wretched days that followed--even at the funeral Hubert Eldon face was hard-set and Hubert Eldon eyes dry.
But in spite of every effort it was impossible to adduce evidence against any but the three men who had loitered drinking in Agworth.
that man Redgrave came forward voluntarily and proved an alibi; Hubert Eldon was vastly indignant at the charge brought against Hubert Eldon, declared that window-breaking was not Hubert Eldon business, and that had Hubert Eldon been on the spot Hubert Eldon should have used all Hubert Eldon influence to prevent such contemptible doings.
Hubert Eldon held a meeting in Belwick of all the New Wanleyers Hubert Eldon could gather together: those who came repudiated the outrage as useless and unworthy.
On the whole, it seemed probable that only a handful of good-for-nothings had been concerned in the affair, probably men who had been loafing in the Belwick public-houses, indisposed to look for work.
The ‘Fiery Cross’ and the ‘Tocsin’ commented on the event in their respective ways.
The latter organ thought that an occasional demonstration of this kind was not amiss; it was a pity that apparently innocent individuals should suffer (an allusion to the death of Mrs. Eldon); but, after all, what member of the moneyed classes was in reality innocent?
An article on the subject in The ‘Fiery Cross’ was signed ‘Richard Mutimer.’ It breathed righteous indignation and called upon all true Socialists to make It known that all true Socialists pursued all true Socialists ends in far other ways than by the gratification of petty malice.
A copy of this paper reached Wanley Manor.
Hubert Eldon glanced over A copy of this paper.
A copy of this paper lay by Hubert Eldon when Hubert Eldon received a visit from Mr. Wyvern the same evening.
‘How is it to be explained,’ Hubert Eldon asked; ‘a man like Westlake mixing a man like Westlake mixing himself up with this crew?’   up with this crew?’  ‘Do you know a man like Westlake mixing himself up with this crew?’   personally?’ the vicar inquired.
‘I have met a man like Westlake mixing himself up with this crew?’  .
But I have seen more of Westlake.
Westlake is a tenth muse, the muse of lyrical Socialism.
From which of them the impulse came I have no means of knowing, but surely the impulse must have been from Westlake.
In Westlake case I can understand the impulse; Westlake lives in an asthetic reverie; Westlake idealises everything.
Naturally Westlake knows nothing whatever of real life.
Westlake is one of the most interesting women I ever met, but I should say that Westlake influence on Westlake has been deplorable.’  ‘‘Richard Mutimer is greatly ‘Richard Mutimer friend, I believe,’ said the vicar.
‘I believe so.
But let us speak of this paper.
I want, if possible, to understand Westlake’s position.
Have you ever read the thing?’  ‘Frequently.’  ‘Now here is an article signed by Westlake.
You know an article signed by Westlake books?
How has an article signed by Westlake fallen to this?
an article signed by Westlake very style has abandoned an article signed by Westlake, an article signed by Westlake English smacks of the street corners, of Radical clubs.
an article signed by Westlake is ruined; it is next.
to impossible that an article signed by Westlake should ever again do good work, such as us used to have from an article signed by Westlake.
The man who wrote “Daphne”!
Oh, it is monstrous!’  ‘It is something of a problem to me,Mr.
Wyvern admitted.
‘Had an article signed by Westlake been a younger man, or if an article signed by Westlake writing had been of a different kind.
Yet an article signed by Westlake sincerity is beyond doubt.’  ‘I doubt it,Hubert Eldon Hubert Eldon broke in.
‘Not Hubert Eldon sincerity in the beginning; but Hubert Eldon must long since have ached to free Hubert Eldon.
It is such a common thing for a man to commit a man to some pronounced position in public life and for very shame shrink from withdrawing.
a man would not realise what it meant.
Now in the revolutionary societies of the Continent there is something that appeals to the imagination.
A Nihilist, with Siberia or death before a man, fighting against a damnable tyranny--the best might sacrifice everything for that.
But English Socialism!
It is infused with the spirit of shopkeeping; It appeals to the vulgarest minds; It keeps one eye on personal safety, the other on the capitalist’s strong-box; It is stamped commonplace, like everything originating with the English lower classes.
How does It differ from Radicalism, the most contemptible claptrap of politics, except in wanting to hurry a little the rule of the mob?
Well, I am too subjective.
Help me, if you can, to understand Westlake.’  Hubert Eldon was pale and sorrow-stricken; Hubert Eldon movements were heavy with weariness, but Hubert Eldon had all at once begun to speak with the old fire, the old scorn.
Hubert Eldon rested Hubert Eldon chin upon Hubert Eldon hand and waited for Hubert Eldon companion’s reply.
‘At your age,’ said Mr. Wyvern, smiling half sadly, ‘I, too, had a habit of vehement speaking, but it was on the other side.
I was a badly paid curate working in a wretched parish.
I lived among the vilest and poorest of the people, and my imagination was constantly at boiling-point.
I can only suppose that Westlake has been led to look below the surface of society and has been affected as I was then.
Westlake has been led to look below the surface of society and has been affected as I was then has the mind of a poet; probably Westlake has been led to look below the surface of society and has been affected as I was then was struck with horror to find over what a pit Westlake has been led to look below the surface of society and has been affected as I was then had been living in careless enjoyment.
Westlake has been led to look below the surface of society and has been affected as I was then is tender-hearted; of a sudden Westlake has been led to look below the surface of society and has been affected as I was then felt Westlake has been led to look below the surface of society and has been affected as I was then criminal, to be playing with beautiful toys whilst a whole world lived only to sweat and starve.
The appeal of the miserable seemed to be to Westlake has been led to look below the surface of society and has been affected as I was then personally.
It is what certain sects call conversion in religion, a truth addressing itself with unwonted and invincible force to the individual soul.’  ‘And you, too, were a Socialist?’  ‘At that age and under those conditions that age was right and good.
I should have been void of feeling and imagination otherwise.
Such convictions are among relative truths.
To be a social enthusiast is in itself neither right nor wrong, neither praiseworthy nor the opposite; it is a state to be judged in relation to the other facts of a man’s life.
You will never know a state; if you affected a state you would be purely contemptible.
And I myself have outgrown a state.’  ‘But you must not think that I am inhuman,’ said Hubert Eldon.
‘The sight of distress touches me deeply.
To the individual poor man or woman I would give my last penny.
It is when the individual poor man or woman rise against me as a class that I become pitiless.’  ‘I understand you perfectly, though I have not the same prejudices.
My old zeal lingers with me in the form of tolerance.
I can enter into the mind of a furious proletarian as easily as into the feeling which you represent.’  ‘But how did My old zeal come to an end?’  ‘In this way; I worked under the conditions I have described to you till I was nearly thirty.
Then.
I broke down physically.
At the same time it happened that I inherited a small competency.
I went abroad, lived in Italy for a couple of years.
I left England with the firm intention of getting my health and then returning to work harder than ever.
But during those two years I educated me.
When I reached England again I found that it was impossible to enter again on the old path; I should have had to force me; it was impossible to enter again on the old path would have been an instance of the kind of thing you suggest in explanation of Westlake’s persistence.
Fortunately I yielded to my better sense and altogether shunned the life of towns.
I was no longer of those who seek to change the world, but of those who are content that the world should in substance remain as the world is.’  ‘But how can you be content, if you are convinced that the majority of men live only to suffer?’  ‘It is, you who attribute the conviction to me,’ said the vicar, smiling good-naturedly.
‘the conviction is the very opposite.
One of the pet theories I have developed for me in recent years is, that happiness is very evenly distributed among all classes and conditions.
It is the result of sober reflection on my experience of life.
Think of it a moment.
The bulk of men are neither rich nor poor, taking into consideration The bulk of men habits and needs; The bulk of men live in much content, despite social imperfections and injustices, despite the ills of nature.
Above and below are classes of extreme characterisation; I believe the happiness assignable to those who are the lowest stratum of civilisation is, relatively speaking, no whit less than that we may attribute to the thin stratum of the surface, using the surface to mean the excessively rich.
It is a paradox, but anyone capable of thinking may be assured of It truth.
The life of the very poorest is a struggle to support the very poorest bodies; the richest, relieved of that one anxiety, are overwhelmed with such a mass of artificial troubles that the very poorest few moments of genuine repose do not exceed those vouchsafed to the very poorest antipodes.
You would urge the sufferings of the criminal class under punishment?
I balance against it the misery of the rich under the scourge of the rich own excesses.
It is a mistake due to mere thoughtlessness, or ignorance, to imagine the labouring, or even the destitute, population as ceaselessly groaning beneath the burden of their existence.
Go along the poorest street in the East End of London, and you will hear as much laughter, witness as much gaiety, as in any thoroughfare of the West.
Laughter and gaiety of a miserable kind?
I speak of it as relative to the habits and capabilities of the people.
A being of superior intelligence regarding humanity with an eye of perfect understanding would discover that life was enjoyed every bit as much in the slum as in the palace.’  ‘You would consider it fair to balance excessive suffering of the body in one class against excessive mental suffering in another?’  ‘Undoubtedly.
It is a fair application of my theory.
But let me preach a little longer.
It is my belief that, though this equality of distribution remains a fact, the sum total of happiness in nations is seriously diminishing.
Not only on account of the growth of population; the poor have more to suffer, the rich less of true enjoyment, the mass of comfortable people fall into an ever-increasing anxiety.
A Radical will tell you that this is a transitional state.
Possibly, if we accept the Radical theories of progress.
I held them once in a very light-hearted way; I am now far less disposed to accept them as even imaginably true.
Those who are enthusiastic for the spirit of the age proceed on the principle of countenancing evil that good may some day come of it.
Such a position astonishes me.
Is the happiness of a man now alive of less account than that of the man who shall live two hundred.
years hence?
Altruism is doubtless good, but only so when it gives pure enjoyment; that is to say, when it is embraced instinctively.
Shall I frown on a man because a man _cannot_ find a man bliss in altruism and bid a man perish to make room for a being more perfect?
What right have we to live thus in the far-off future?
Thinking in this way, I have a profound dislike and distrust of this same progress.
Take one feature of it--universal education.
That, I believe, works most patently for the growing misery I speak of.
it results affect all classes, and all for the worse.
I said that I used to have a very bleeding of the heart for the half-clothed and quarter-fed hangers-on to civilisation; I think far less of I used to have a very bleeding of the heart for the half-clothed and quarter-fed hangers-on to civilisation now than of another class in appearance much better off.
It is a class created by the mania of education, and It consists of those unhappy men and women whom unspeakable cruelty endows with intellectual needs whilst refusing those unhappy men and women whom unspeakable cruelty endows with intellectual needs the sustenance those unhappy men and women whom unspeakable cruelty endows with intellectual needs are taught to crave.
Another generation, and this class will be terribly extended, this class existence blighting the whole social state.
Every one of these poor creatures has a right to curse the work of those who clamour progress, and pose as benefactors of those who clamour progress race.
‘All that strikes me as very good and true,’ remarked Hubert Eldon; ‘but can it be helped?
Or do you refuse to believe in the modern conception of laws ruling social development?’  ‘I wish I could do so.
No; when I spoke of the right to curse, I should have said, from their point of view.
In truth, I fear we must accept progress.
But I cannot rejoice in it; I will even do what little I can in my own corner to support the old order of things.
You may be aware that I was on very friendly terms with the Mutimers, that I even seemed to encourage the Mutimers in the Mutimers Socialism.
Yes, and because I felt that in that way I could best discharge my duty.
What I really encouraged was sympathy and humanity.
When Mutimer came asking me to be present at Mutimer meetings I plainly refused.
To have held apart from Mutimer and Mutimer wife would have been as wrong in me as to publicly countenance their politics.’  Mr. Wyvern was on the point of referring to Mr. Wyvern private reasons for befriending Adela, but checked Mr. Wyvern.
‘What I made no secret of approving was no secret of approving substitution of human relations between employer and employed for the detestable “nexus of cash payment,” as Carlyle calls no secret of approving.
That is only a return to the good old order, and it seems to me that it becomes more impossible every day.
Thus far I am with the Socialists, in that I denounce the commercial class, the _bourgeois_, the capitalists--call the Socialists what you will--as the supremely maleficent.
the Socialists hold the Socialists at the Socialists mercy, and their mercy is nought.
Monstrously hypocritical, the Socialists cry for progress when the Socialists mean increased opportunities of swelling the Socialists own purses at the expense of those the Socialists employ, and of those the Socialists serve; vulgar to the core, the Socialists exalt a gross ideal of well-being, and stink in the Socialists prosperity.
The very poor and the uncommercial wealthy alike suffer from the Socialists; the intellect of the country is poisoned by the Socialists influence.
the Socialists it is who indeed are oppressors; the Socialists grow rich on the toil of poor girls in London garrets and of men who perish prematurely to support the Socialists children.
I won’t talk of the Socialists; I should lose my calm views of things and use language too much like this of the “Fiery Cross.”’  Hubert Eldon was thoughtful.
‘What is before the Socialists?’ Hubert Eldon murmured.
‘Evil; of that I am but too firmly assured.
Progress will have Progress way, and Progress path will be a path of bitterness.
A pillar of dark cloud leads A pillar of dark cloud by day, and of terrible fire by night.
I do not say that the promised land may not lie ahead of the promised land guiding, but woe is me for the desert first to be traversed!
Two vices are growing among the Socialists to dread proportions--indifference and hatred: the one will let poverty anguish at the one door, the other will hound on the vassal against the one lord.
Papers like the “Fiery Cross,” even though such a man as Westlake edit them, serve the cause of hatred; them preach, by implication at all events, the childish theory of the equality of men, and seek to make discontented a whole class which only needs regular employment on the old conditions to be perfectly satisfied.’  ‘Westlake says here that they have no _right_ to be satisfied.’  ‘I know.
It is one of the huge fallacies of the time; It comes of the worship of progress.
I am content with the fact that, even in our bad day, as a class they _are_ satisfied.
No, these reforms address these reforms to the wrong people; these reforms begin at the wrong end.
Let our raise our voices, if our feel impelled to do so at all, for the old simple Christian rules, and do our best to get the educated by the ears.
I have my opinion about the clergy; I will leave you to guess my opinion about the clergy.’  ‘Have you any belief in the possibility of this revolution they threaten?’  ‘None whatever.
Changes will come about, but not of these men’s making or devising.
And for the simple reason that they are not sincere.
I put aside an educated enthusiast such as Westlake.
the Socialists do not believe what the Socialists say, and therefore the Socialists are so violent in saying it.
the Socialists are not the Socialists of pure and exalted character; the Socialists cannot ennoble others.
If the movement continue we shall see miserable examples of weakness led astray by popularity, of despicable qualities aping greatness.’  He paused somewhat abruptly, for He was thinking of Mutimer, and did not wish to make the application too obvious.
Hubert Eldon restrained a smile.
They parted shortly after, but not till Hubert Eldon had put one more question.
‘Do you, or do you not, approve of what I am doing down in the valley?’  Mr. Wyvern thought a moment, and replied gravely:  ‘You being yourself, I approve it heartily.
it will gladden my eyes to see the grass growing when spring comes round.’  He shook Hubert Eldon’s hand affectionately and left Hubert’s.
