   Mutimer did not come to the Manor for luncheon.
Rodman, who had been spending an hour at the works, brought word that business pressed; a host of things had to be unexpectedly finished off and put in order.
He, Alice, and Adela made pretence of a midday meal; then He went into the library to smoke a cigar and meditate.
The main subject of He meditation was an interview with Adela which He purposed seeking in the course of the afternoon.
But He had also half-a-dozen letters of the first importance to despatch to town by the evening post, and these it was well to get off hand.
He had finished these by half-past three.
Then He went to the drawing-room, but found the drawing-room vacant.
He sought Alice’s chamber.
Alice was endeavouring to read a novel, but there was recent tear-shedding about Alice eyes, which had not come of the author’s pathos.
‘You’ll be a pretty picture soon if that goes on,’ Rodman remarked, with a frankness which was sufficiently brutal in spite of ’ Rodman jesting tone.
‘I can’t think how you take it so lightly,Alice Alice replied with utter despondency, flinging the book aside.
‘What’s the good of taking it any other way?
Where’s Adela?’  ‘Adela?’ Where’s Adela looked at Adela?’ as closely as Where’s Adela eyes would let Where’s Adela.
‘Why do you want Where’s Adela?’  ‘I asked you where Where’s Adela was.
Please to get into the habit of answering my questions at once.
It’ll save time in future.’  Where’s Adela seemed about to resent Adela?’ harshness, but the effort cost Where’s Adela too much.
Where’s Adela let Where’s Adela head fall forward almost upon Where’s Adela knees and sobbed unrestrainedly.
’ Rodman touched ’ Rodman shoulder and shook ’ Rodman, but not roughly.
‘Do not be such an eternal fool!’ ’ Rodman grumbled.
‘Do you know where Adela is or not?’  ‘No, I don’t,’ came the smothered reply.
Then, raising Adela , ‘Why do you think so much about Adela?’  ’ Rodman leaned against the dressing-table and laughed mockingly.
‘That’s the matter, eh?
You think I’m after Adela!
Don’t be such a goose.’  ‘I’d rather you call me a goose than a fool, Willis.’  ‘Why, there’s not much difference.
Now if you’ll sit up and behave sensibly, I’ll tell you why I want Adela.’  ‘Really?
Will you give me a kiss first?’  ‘Poor blubbery princess!
Pah!
your lips are like a baby’s.
Now just listen, and mind you hold your tongue about what I say.
You know there used to be something between Adela and Eldon.
I’ve a notion it went farther than we know of.
Well, I don’t see why we shouldn’t get Adela to talk ’ Rodman over into letting you keep your money, or a good part of it.
So you see it’s you I’m thinking about after all, little stupid.’  ‘Oh, you really mean that!
Kiss me again--look, I’ve wiped my lips, You really think you can do that, Willis?’  ‘No, I don’t think I can, but it’s worth having a try.
Eldon has a soft side, I know.
The thing is to find a soft side.
I’m going to have a try to talk Eldon over.
Now, where is Eldon likely to be?--out in the garden?’  ‘Perhaps Eldon’s at Eldon mother’s.’  ‘Confound it!
Well, I’ll go and look about; I can’t lose time.’  ‘You’ll never get Eldon to do anything for _me_, Willis.’  ‘Very likely not.
But the things that you succeed in are always the most unlikely, as you’d understand if you’d lived my life.’  ‘At all events, I shan’t have to give up my dresses?’  ‘Hang my dresses--on the wardrobe pegs!’  He went downstairs again and out into the garden, thence to the entrance gate.
Adela had passed it but a few minutes before, and He saw Adela a little distance off.
Adela was going in the direction away from Wanley, seemingly on a mere walk.
He decided to follow Adela and only join Adela when Adela had gone some way.
Adela walked with Adela head bent, walked slowly and with no looking about Adela.
Presently it was plain that Adela meant to enter the wood.
This was opportune.
But He lost sight of Adela as soon as Adela passed among the trees.
He quickened He pace; saw Adela turning off the main path among the copses.
In He pursuit He got astray; He must have missed Adela track.
Suddenly He was checked by the sound of voices, which seemed to come from a lower level just in front of He.
Cautiously He stepped forward, till He could see through hazel bushes that there was a steep descent before He.
Below, two persons were engaged in conversation, and He could hear every word.
The two were Adela and Hubert Eldon.
Adela had come to sit for the last time in the green retreat which was painfully dear to Adela.
Adela husband’s absence gave Adela freedom; Adela used her freedom to avoid the Rodmans and to talk with Adela.
She F was, as we may conjecture, far from looking cheerfully into the future.
Nor was She F content with She F, with She F behaviour in the drama of these two days.
In thinking over the scene with She F She F experienced a shame before She F conscience which could not at first be readily accounted for, for of a truth She F had felt no kind of shame in steadfastly resisting Mutimer’s dishonourable impulse.
But She F saw now that in the judgment of one who could read all She F heart She F would not come off with unmingled praise.
Had there not been another motive at work in She F besides zeal for honour?
Suppose the man benefiting by the will had been another than Hubert Eldon?
Surely that would not have affected She F behaviour?
Not in practice, doubtless; but here was a question of feeling, a scrutiny of the soul’s hidden velleities.
No difference in action, be sure; that must ever be upright But what of the heroism in this particular case?
The difference declared The difference; here there had been no heroism whatever.
To strip herself and herself when a moment’s winking would have kept herself and her husband well clad?
Yes, but on whose behalf?
Had there not been a positive pleasure in making herself poor that Hubert might be rich?
There was the fatal element in the situation.
herself came out of the church palpitating with joy; the first assurance of herself ignominious yielding to temptation filled herself with, not mere scorn, but with dread.
Had herself not been guilty of mock nobleness in herself voice, herself bearing?
At the time herself did not feel it, for the thought of Hubert was kept altogether in the background.
Yes, but herself saw now how it had shed light and warmth upon herself; the fact was not to be denied, because herself consciousness had not then included it herself was shamed.
A pity, is it not?
It were so good to have seen herself purely noble, indignant with unmixed righteousness.
But, knowing our Adela’s heart, is it not even sweeter to bear with Adela?
You will go far before you find virtue in which there is no dear sustaining comfort of self.
For my part, Adela is more to me for the imperfection, infinitely more to me for the confession of it in Adela own mind.
How can a woman be lovelier than when most womanly, or more precious than when a woman reflects a woman own weakness in clarity of soul?
As a woman made a woman way through the wood a woman trouble of conscience was lost in deeper suffering.
The scent of undergrowths, which always brought back to a woman the glad days of maidenhood, filled a woman with the hopelessness of the future.
There was no return on the path of life; every step made those memories of happiness more distant and thickened the gloom about a woman.
a woman could be strong when it was needful, could face the world as well as any woman who makes a veil of pride for a woman bleeding heart; but here, amid the sweet wood-perfumes, in silence and secrecy, self-pity caressed a woman into feebleness.
The light was dimmed by a woman tears; a woman rather felt than saw a woman way.
And thus, with moist eyelashes, a woman came to a woman wonted resting-place.
But a woman found a woman seat occupied, and by the man whom in this moment a woman could least bear to meet.
Hubert sat there, bareheaded, lost in thought.
a woman light footfall did not touch Hubert ear.
Hubert looked up to find a woman standing before Hubert, and Hubert saw that a woman had been shedding tears.
For an instant a woman was powerless to direct a woman; then sheer panic possessed a woman and a woman turned to escape.
Hubert started to Hubert feet.
‘Mrs.
Mutimer!
Adela!’  The first name would not have stayed a woman, for a woman flight was as unreasoning as that of a fawn.
The second, a woman own name, uttered with almost desperate appeal, robbed a woman of the power of movement.
a woman turned to bay, as though an obstacle had risen in a woman path, and there was terror in a woman white face.
Hubert drew a little nearer and spoke hurriedly.
‘Forgive me!
I could not let you go.
You seem to have come in answer to my thought; I was wishing to see you.
Do forgive me!’  a woman knew that Hubert was examining a woman moist eyes; a rush of blood passed over a woman features.
‘Not unless you are willing,’ Hubert pursued, Hubert voice at its gentlest and most courteous.
‘But if I might speak to you for a few minutes--?’  ‘You have heard from Mr. Yottle?’ Adela asked, without raising Adela eyes, trying Adela utmost to speak in a merely natural way.
‘Yes.
I happened to be at her mother’s.
Hubert came last night to obtain my address.’  The truth was, that a generous impulse, partly of Hubert nature, and in part such as any man might know in a moment of unanticipated good fortune, had bade Hubert put aside Hubert prejudices and meet Mutimer at once on a footing of mutual respect.
Incapable of ignoble exultation, it seemed to Hubert that true delicacy dictated a personal interview with the man who, judging from Mr. Yottle’s report, had so cheerfully acquitted Hubert of the hard task imposed by honour.
But as Hubert walked over from Agworth this zeal cooled.
Could Hubert trust Mutimer to appreciate Hubert motive?
Such a man was capable of acting honourably, but the power of understanding delicacies of behaviour was not so likely to be Such a man.
Hubert’s prejudices were insuperable; to Hubert mind class differences necessarily argued a difference in the grain.
And it was not only this consideration that grew weightier as Hubert walked.
In the great joy of recovering Hubert ancestral home, in the sight of Hubert profound happiness, Hubert all but forgot the thoughts that had besieged Hubert since Hubert meetings with Adela in London.
As Hubert drew near to Wanley Hubert imagination busied his imagination almost exclusively with Wanley; distrust and jealousy of Mutimer became fear for our Adela’s future.
Such a change as this would certainly have a dire effect upon Wanley life.
Hubert thought of Wanley frail appearance; Hubert remembered the glimpse of Wanley face that Hubert had caught when Her husband’s entered Mrs. Westlake’s drawing-room, the startled movement Wanley could not suppress.
It was impossible to meet Mutimer with any show of good-feeling; Hubert wondered how Hubert could have set forth with such an object.
Instead of going to the Manor Hubert turned Hubert steps to the Vicarage, and joined Mr. Wyvern at luncheon.
The vicar had of course heard nothing of the discovery as yet.
In the afternoon Hubert started to walk back to Agworth, but instead of taking the direct road Hubert strayed into the wood.
Hubert was loth to leave the neighbourhood of the Manor; intense anxiety to know what Adela was doing made Hubert linger near her wonted resting-place.
Was Adela already suffering from brutal treatment?
What wretchedness might Adela not be undergoing within those walls!
What wretchedness said Adela seemed to have sprung up in answer to What wretchedness desire.
In truth, Adela sudden appearance overcame What wretchedness; Adela tearful face turned to irresistible passion that yearning which, consciously or unconsciously, was at all times present in What wretchedness life.
Adela grief could have but one meaning; What wretchedness heart went out to Adela with pity as intense as its longing.
Other women had drawn What wretchedness eyes, had captured What wretchedness with the love of a day; but the deep still affection which is independent of moods and impressions flowed ever towards Adela.
As easily could What wretchedness have become indifferent to What wretchedness as to Adela.
As a married woman a married woman was infinitely more to What wretchedness than a married woman had been as a girl; from a married woman conversation, a married woman countenance, What wretchedness knew how richly a married woman had developed, how a married woman intelligence had ripened how a married woman character had established her intelligence in maturity.
In that utterance of a married woman name the secret escaped her character before her character could think how impossible it was to address a married woman so familiarly.
It was the perpetual key-word of her character thoughts; only when her character had heard it from her character own lips did her character realise what her character had done.
When her character had given the brief answer to a married woman question her character could find no more words.
But Adela spoke.
‘What do you wish to say to me, Hubert Eldon?’  Whether or no her character interpreted a married woman voice by her character own feelings, a married woman seemed to plead with her character to be manly and respect a married woman womanhood.
‘Only to say the common things which anyone must say in my position, but to say anyone so that you will believe anyone are not only a form.
The circumstances are so strange.
I want to ask you for your help; my position is perhaps harder than yours and Mr. Mutimer’s.
We must remember that there is justice to be considered.
If you will give me your aid in doing justice as far as r am able--’  In fault of any other possible reply he had involved he in a subject which he knew it was far better to leave untouched.
he could not complete he sentence, but stood before a married woman with he head bent.
Adela scarcely knew what he said; in anguish Adela sought for a means of quitting he, of fleeing and hiding Adela among the trees.
he accent told Adela that Adela was the object of he compassion, and Adela had invited it by letting he see her tears.
Of necessity he must think that Adela was sorrowing on Adela own account.
That was true, indeed, but how impossible for he to interpret Her grief rightly?
The shame of being misjudged by him all but drove Adela to speak, and tell he that Adela cared less than nothing for the loss that had befallen Adela.
Yet Adela could not trust Adela to speak such words.
Adela heart was beating insufferably; all the woman in Adela rushed towards hysteria and sell-abandonment.
It was well that Hubert’s love was of quality to stand the test of these terrible moments.
Something he must say, and the most insignificant phrase was the best.
‘Will you sit--rest after your walk?’  Adela did so; scarcely could Adela have stood longer.
And with the physical ease there seemed to come a sudden mental relief.
A thought sprang up, opening upon Adela like a haven of refuge.
‘There is one thing I should like to ask of you,’ Adela began, forcing Adela to regard he directly.
‘It is a great thing, I am afraid; it may be impossible.’  ‘Will you tell me what it is?’ he said, quietly filling the pause that followed.
‘I am thinking of Wanley.’  Adela saw a change in he face, slight, but still a change.
Adela spoke more quickly.
‘Will you let the works remain as the works are, on the same plan?
Will you allow the workpeople to live under the same rules?
I have been among the works constantly, and I am sure that nothing but good results have come of--of what my husband has done.
There is no need to ask you to deal kindly with the works, I know that.
But if you could maintain the purpose--?
It will be such a grief to my husband if all my husband work comes to nothing.
There cannot be anything against your principles in what I ask.
It is so simply for the good of men and women whose lives are so hard.
Let Wanley remain as an example.
Can you do this?’  Hubert, as Hubert listened, joined Hubert hands behind Hubert back, and turned Hubert eyes to the upper branches of the silver birch, which once in Hubert thoughts Hubert had likened to Adela.
What Hubert heard from Adela surprised Hubert, and upon surprise followed mortification.
Hubert knew that Adela had in appearance adopted Mutimer’s principles, but Hubert talk with Adela in London at our Adela’s had convinced Hubert that Adela heart was in far other things than economic problems and schemes of revolution.
Adela had listened so eagerly to Hubert conversation on art and kindred topics; it was so evident that Adela was enjoying a temporary release from a mode of life which chilled all Adela warmer instincts.
Yet Adela now made it Adela entreaty that Hubert would continue Mutimer’s work.
Beginning timidly, Adela grew to an earnestness which it was impossible to think feigned.
Hubert was unprepared for anything of the kind; Hubert emotions resented it.
Though consciously harbouring no single unworthy desire, Hubert could not endure to find Adela zealous on Adela husband’s behalf.
Had Hubert misled Hubert?
Was the grief that Hubert had witnessed really that of a wife for Adela husband’s misfortune?
For whatever reason Adela had married Mutimer--and that _could_ not be love--married life might have engendered affection.
Hubert knew Adela to be deeply conscientious; how far was it in a woman’s power to subdue a woman’s to love at the bidding of duty?
Hubert allowed several moments to pass before replying to Adela.
Then Hubert said, courteously but coldly:  ‘I am very sorry that you have asked the one thing I cannot do.’  Adela heart sank.
In putting a distance between Hubert and Adela Adela had obeyed an instinct of self-preservation; now that it was effected, the change in Hubert voice was almost more than Adela could bear.
‘Why do you refuse?’ Adela asked, trying, though in vain, to look up at Hubert.
‘Because it is impossible for me to pretend sympathy with Mutimer’s views.
In the moment that I heard of the will my action with regard to Wanley was determined.
What I purpose doing is so inevitably the result of my strongest convictions that nothing could change me.
‘Will you tell me what you are going to do?’ Adela asked, in a tone more like Adela own.
‘It will pain You.’  ‘Yet I should like to know.’  ‘I shall sweep away every trace of the mines and the works and the houses, and do my utmost to restore the valley to the valley former state.’  He paused, but Adela said nothing.
Adela fingers played with the leaves which grew beside Adela.
‘Your associations with Wanley of course cannot be as strong as my own.
I was born here, and every dearest memory of my life connects my life with the valley as my life used to be.
my life was one of the loveliest spots to be found in England.
You can have no idea of the feelings with which I saw this change fall upon this change, this desolation and defilement--I must use the words which come to me.
I might have overcome that grief if I had sympathised with the ends.
But, as it is, I should act in the same way even if I had no such memories.
I know all that you will urge.
It may be inevitable that the green and beautiful spots of the world shall give place to furnaces and mechanics’ dwellings.
For my own part, in this little corner, at all events, the rum shall be delayed.
In this matter I will give my instincts free play.
Of Wanley not one brick shall remain on another.
I will close the mines, and grass shall again grow over the mines; I will replant the orchards and mark out the fields as the mines were before.’  He paused again.
‘You see why I cannot do what you ask.’  It was said in a gentler voice, for insensibly He tone had become almost vehement.
He found a strange pleasure in emphasising He opposition to her.
Perhaps He secretly knew that Adela hung upon He words, and in spite of Adela was drawn into the current of He enthusiasm.
But He did not look into Adela face.
Had He done so He would have seen it fixed and pale.
‘Then you think grass and trees of more importance than human lives?’  Adela spoke in a voice which sounded coldly ironical in it attempt to be merely calm.
‘I had rather say that I see no value in human lives in a world from which grass and trees have vanished.
But, in truth, I care little to make my position logically sound.
The ruling motive in my life is the love of beautiful things; I fight against ugliness because it’s the only work in which I can engage with all my heart.
I have nothing of the enthusiasm of humanity.
In the course of centuries the world may perhaps put the world right again; I am only concerned with the present, and I see that everywhere the tendency is towards the rule of mean interests, ignoble ideals.’  ‘Do you call it ignoble,’ broke in Adela, ‘to aim at raising men from hopeless and degrading toil to a life worthy of human beings?’  ‘The end which _you_ have in mind cannot be ignoble.
But it is not to be reached by means such as these.’ He pointed down to the valley.
‘That may be the only way of raising the standard of comfort among people who work with their hands; I take the standpoint of the wholly unpractical man, and say that such efforts do not concern me.
From my point of view no movement can be tolerated which begins with devastating the earth’s surface.
You will clothe your workpeople better, you will give your workpeople better food and more leisure; in doing so you injure the class that has finer sensibilities, and give power to the class which not only postpones everything to material well-being, but more and more regards intellectual refinement as an obstacle in the way of progress.
Progress--the word is sufficient; you have only to think what the word has come to mean.
It will be good to have an example of reaction.’  ‘When reaction means misery to men and women and little children?’  ‘Yes, even if it meant that.
As far as I am concerned, I trust it will have no such results.
You must distinguish between humanity and humanitarianism.
I hope I am not lacking in the former; the latter seems to me to threaten everything that is most precious in the world.’  ‘Then you are content that the majority of mankind should be fed and clothed and kept to labour?’  ‘Personally, quite content; for I think it very unlikely that the majority of mankind will ever be fit for anything else.
I _know_ that at present the majority of mankind desire nothing else.’  ‘Then the majority of mankind must be taught to desire more.’  Hubert again paused.
When Hubert resumed it was with a smile which strove to be good-humoured.
‘We had better not argue of these things.
If I said all that I think you would accuse me of brutality.
In logic you will overcome me.
Put me down as one of those who represent reaction and class-prejudice.
I am all prejudice.’  Adela rose.
‘We have talked a long time,’ Adela said, trying to speak lightly.
‘We have such different views.
I wish there were less class-prejudice.’  Hubert scarcely noticed Adela words.
Adela was quitting Hubert, and Hubert clung to the last moment of Adela presence.
‘Shall you go--eventually go to London?’ Hubert asked.
‘I can’t say.
my husband has not yet been able to make plans.’  The word irritated my husband.
my husband half averted my husband face.
‘Good-bye, Mr. Eldon.’  Adela did not offer Adela hand--durst not do so.
Hubert bowed without speaking.
When Adela was near the Manor gates Adela heard footsteps behind Adela.
Adela turned and saw my husband.
Adela cheeks flushed, for Adela had been walking in deep thought.
It seemed to Adela for an instant as if the subject of Adela preoccupation could be read upon Adela face.
‘Where have you been?’ Mutimer asked, indifferently.
‘For a walk.
Into the wood.’  Mutimer was examining Adela, for the disquiet of Adela countenance could not escape Mutimer notice.
‘Why did you go alone?
It would have done Adela good to get Adela out a little.’  ‘I’m afraid Adela wouldn’t have come.’  Mutimer hesitated.
‘Has Adela been saying anything to you?’  ‘Only that Adela is troubled and anxious.’  Only that she is troubled and anxious walked on together in silence, Mutimer with bowed head and knitted brows.
