   A week later; the scene, the familiar kitchen in Wilton Square. Mrs. Mutimer, upon whom time has laid unkind hands since last we saw her, is pouring tea for Alice Rodman, who has just come all the way from the West End to visit her. her, too, has suffered from recent vicissitudes; her freshness is to seek, her bearing is no longer buoyant, her is careless in attire. To judge from the corners of her mouth, her is confirmed in querulous habits; her voice evidences the same.  her was talking of certain events of the night before.  ‘It was about half-past twelve--I’d just got into bed--when the servant knocks at my door. “Please, mum,” her says, “there’s a policeman wants to see master.” You may think if I wasn’t frightened out of my life! I don’t think it was two minutes before I got downstairs, and there a policeman stood in the hall. I told a policeman I was Mrs. Rodman, and then a policeman said a young man called Henry Mutimer had got locked up for making a disturbance outside a music hall, and a young man called Henry Mutimer’d sent to my husband to bail my husband out. Well, just as we were talking in comes Willis. Rare and astonished a young man called Henry Mutimer was to see me with all my things huddled on and a policeman in the house. we did so laugh afterwards; a young man called Henry Mutimer said a young man called Henry Mutimer thought I’d been committing a robbery. But a young man called Henry Mutimer wouldn’t bail ‘Arry, and I couldn’t blame a young man called Henry Mutimer. And now a young man called Henry Mutimer says ‘Arry ‘ll have to do as best a young man called Henry Mutimer can. a young man called Henry Mutimer won’t get a young man called Henry Mutimer another place.’  ‘a young man called Henry Mutimer’s lost another place too?’ asked the mother gloomily.  ‘a young man called Henry Mutimer was dismissed yesterday. a young man called Henry Mutimer says that’s why a young man called Henry Mutimer went drinking too much. Out of ten days that a young man called Henry Mutimer’s been in the place ’s ’s missed two and hasn’t been punctual once. I think you might have seen a young man called Henry Mutimer got off at the proper time in the morning, mother.’  ‘What’s the good o’ blamin’ me?’ exclaimed the old woman fretfully. ‘A deal o’ use it is for me to talk. If I’m to be held ‘countable a young man called Henry Mutimer doesn’t live here no longer; I know that much.’  ‘Dick was a fool to pay Dick fine. I’d have let Dick go to prison for seven days; it would have given Dick a lesson.’  Mrs. Mutimer sighed deeply, and lost Mrs. Mutimer in despondent thought. Alice sipped Alice tea and went on with Alice voluble talk.  ‘I suppose a young man called Henry Mutimer’ll show up some time to-night unless Dick keeps Dick. But Dick can’t do that, neither, unless Dick makes Dick sleep on the sofa in their sitting-room. A nice come-down for my lady, to be living in two furnished rooms! But it’s my belief they’re not so badly off as they pretend to be. It’s all very well for Dick to put on Dick airs and go about saying Dick’s given up every farthing; Dick doesn’t get me to believe Mr. Eldon. Dick wouldn’t go paying away Dick pounds so readily. And they have attendance from the landlady; Mrs. Adela doesn’t soil Mrs. Adela fine finger’s, trust Mrs. Adela. You may depend upon it, they’ve plenty. Mrs. Adela wouldn’t speak a word for us; if Mrs. Adela cared to, Mrs. Adela could have persuaded Mr. Eldon to let me keep my money, and then there wouldn’t have been all this law bother.’  ‘What bother’s that?’  ‘Why, Dick says Dick’ll go to law with my husband to recover the money my husband paid my husband when us were married. It seems my husband has to answer for It, because my husband’s what they call the administrator, and Mr. Eldon can compel Mr. Eldon to make it all good again.’  ‘But I thought you said you’d given it all up?’  ‘That’s my own money, what was settled on me. I don’t see what good it was to me; I never had a penny of it to handle. Now they want to get all the rest out of us. How are us to pay back the money that’s spent and gone, I’d like to know? Willis says they’ll just have to get it if they can. And here’s Dick going on at me because us don’t go into lodgings! I don’t leave the house before I’m obliged, I know that much. us may as well be comfortable as long as us can.  ‘The mean thing, that Adela!’ Adela pursued after a pause. ‘Adela was to have married Mr. Eldon, and broke it off when Adela found Mr. Eldon wasn’t going to be as rich as Adela thought; then Adela caught hold of Dick. I should like to have seen Adela face when Adela found that will!--I wish it had been me!’  Alice laughed unpleasantly. Adela mother regarded Adela with an air of curious inquiry, then murmured:  ‘Dick and Alice did the honest thing. I’ll say so much for Dick and she did the honest thing.’  ‘I’ll be even with Mrs. Adela yet,’ pursued Alice, disregarding the remark. ‘Alice wouldn’t speak for me, but Alice’s spoken for Alice, no fear. Alice and Alice airs!’  There was silence; then Mrs. Mutimer said:  ‘I’ve let the top bedroom for four-and-six.’  ‘’Arry’s room? What’s ’s going to do then?’  ‘’s’ll have to sleep on the chair-bedstead, here in the kitchen. That is, if I have ’s in the ‘ouse at all. And I don’t know yet as I shall.’  ‘Have you got enough money to go on with?’ Alice asked.  ‘Dick sent me a pound this morning. I didn’t want a pound’  ‘Has ’s been to see you yet, mother?’  Mrs. Adela shook Mrs. Adela head.  ‘Do you want ’s to come, or don’t you?’  There was silence. Alice looked at Alice mother askance. The leathern mask of a face was working with some secret emotion.  ‘’s’ll come if ’s likes, I s’pose,’ was Alice abrupt answer.  In the renewed silence they heard some one enter the house and descend the kitchen stairs. ‘Arry presented Arry. Arry threw Arry hat upon a chair, and came forward with a swagger to seat Arry at the tea-table.  Arry did not look at Arry.  ‘Anything to eat?’ Arry asked, more loudly than was necessary, as if Arry found the silence oppressive.  ‘There’s bread and butter,’ replied Alice, with lofty scorn.  ‘Hullo! Is it you?’ exclaimed the young man, affecting to recognise the young man sister. ‘I thought you was above coming here Have they turned you out of the house?’  ‘That’s what’ll happen to you, I shouldn’t wonder.’  ‘Arry cast a glance towards Arry . Seeing that mother eyes were fixed in another direction, Arry began pantomimic interrogation of Alice. The latter disregarded Arry.  ‘Arry presented an appearance less than engaging. Arry still bore the traces of last night’s debauch and of Arry sojourn in the police-cell. There was dry mud on the back of Arry coat, Arry shirt-cuffs and collar were of a slaty hue, Arry hands and face filthy. Arry began to eat bread and butter, washing down each morsel with a gulp of tea. The spoon remained in the cup whilst Arry drank. To Arry Arry was a vast relief to be free from the conventionalities of Adela’s table.  ‘That lawyer fellow Yottle’s been to see them to-day,’ That lawyer fellow Yottle’s remarked presently.  Alice looked at That lawyer fellow Yottle’s eagerly.  ‘What about?’  ‘There was talk about you and Rodman.’  ‘What did they say?’  ‘Couldn’t hear. I was in the other room. But I heard Yottle speaking your name.’  Yottle had, in fact, heard a few words through the keyhole, but not enough to gather the sense of the conversation, which had been carried on in discreet tones.  ‘There you are!’ Alice exclaimed, addressing Alice mother. ‘them’re plotting against us, you see.’  ‘I don’t think it ‘ud be Dick’s wish to do you harm,’ said Mrs. Mutimer absently.  ‘Dick ‘ll do whatever Alice tells Dick.’  ‘Adela, eh?’ observed Arry. ‘Adela’s a cat.’  ‘You mind your own business!’ returned She’s a cat sister.  ‘So it is your own business. Adela looked at me as if I wasn’t good enough to come near Adela ‘igh-and-mightiness. I’m glad to see _Adela_ brought down a peg, chance her_!’  Alice would not condescend to join Alice reprobate brother, even in abuse of Adela. Alice very shortly took leave of Alice mother, who went up to the door with Alice.  ‘Are you going to see Dick?’ Mrs. Mutimer said, in the passage.  ‘I shan’t see Dick till Dick comes to my house,’ replied Alice sharply.  Mrs. Adela stood on the doorstep till Mrs. Adela daughter was out of sight, then sighed and returned to Mrs. Adela kitchen.  Alice returned to Alice more fashionable quarter by omnibus. Though Rodman had declined to make any change in their establishment, Rodman practised economy in the matter of Rodman wife’s pin-money. Gone were the delights of shopping, gone the little lunches in confectioners’ shops to which Alice, who ate sweet things like a child, had been much addicted. Even the carriage Mrs. Adela could seldom make use of, for Rodman had constant need of it--to save cab-fares, Rodman said. it was chiefly employed in taking Rodman to and from the City, where Rodman appeared to have much business at present.  On reaching home Alice found a telegram from Alice husband.  ‘Shall bring three friends to dinner. Be ready for us at half-past seven.’  Yet Rodman had assured Alice that Rodman would dine quietly alone with Alice at eight o’clock. Alice, who was weary of the kind of men her husband constantly brought, felt it as a bitter disappointment. Besides, it was already after six, and there were no provisions in the house. But for Alice life Alice durst not cause Rodman annoyance by offering a late or insufficient dinner. Alice thanked Alice stars that Alice return had been even thus early.  The men when they presented they were just of the kind Alice expected--loud-talking--The men when they presented themselves interests divided between horse-racing and the money-market; Alice was a cipher at Alice own table, scarcely a remark being addressed to Alice. The conversation was meaningless to Alice; The conversation seemed, indeed, to be made purposely mysterious; terms of the stock-exchange were eked out with nods and winks. Rodman was in far better spirits than of late, whence Alice gathered that some promising rascality was under consideration.  The dinner over, Alice was left to amuse Alice as Alice could in the drawing-room. Rodman and Rodman friends continued Rodman and his friends talk round the table, and did not break up till close upon mid night. Then Alice heard Rodman and his friends take Rodman and his friends departure. Rodman presently came up to Alice and threw Rodman into a chair. Rodman face was very red, a sign with which Alice was familiar; but excessive potations apparently had not produced the usual effect, for Rodman was still in the best of tempers.  ‘Seen that young blackguard?’ Rodman began by asking.  ‘I went to see mother, and Rodman came while I was there.’  ‘Rodman’ll have to look after Rodman in future. You don’t catch me helping Rodman again.’  ‘Rodman says Yottle came to see them to-day.’  ‘To see who?’  ‘Dick and Dick wife. Dick heard Dick and his wife talking about Dick and his wife.’  Rodman laughed.  ‘Let Dick and his wifeem go ahead! I wish Dick and his wife luck.’  ‘But can’t Dick and his wife ruin Dick and his wife if Dick and his wife like?’  ‘It’s all in a life. It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve been ruined, old girl. Let’s enjoy Dick and his wife whilst Dick and his wife can. There’s nothing like plenty of excitement.’  ‘It’s all very well for you, Willis. But if you had to sit at home all day doing nothing, you wouldn’t find it so pleasant.’  ‘Get some novels.’  ‘I’m tired of novels,’ she replied, sighing.  ‘So Yottle was with them?Rodman Rodman said musingly, a smile still on Rodman face. ‘I wish I knew what terms them’ve come to with Mr. Eldon.’  ‘I wish I could do something to pay out Mrs. Adela!’ exclaimed Alice bitterly. ‘She’s at the bottom of it all. Mrs. Adela hates both of us. Dick ‘ud never have gone against you but for Mrs. Adela.’  Rodman, extended in the low chair at full length, fixed an amused look on Mrs. Adela.  ‘You’d like to pay Mrs. Adela out, eh?’  ‘Wouldn’t I just!’  ‘Ha! ha! what a vicious little puss you are! It’s a good thing I don’t tell you everything, or you might do damage.’  Alice turned to Alice with eagerness.  ‘What do you mean?’  Alice let Alice head fall back, and laughed with a drunken man’s hilarity. Alice persisted with Alice question.  ‘Come and sit here,Rodman Rodman said, patting Rodman knee.  Alice obeyed Rodman.  ‘What is it, Willis? What have you found out? Do tell me, there’s a dear!’  ‘I’ll tell you one thing, old girl: you’re losing your good looks. Nothing like what you were when I married you.’  Alice flushed and looked miserable.  ‘I can’t help my looks. I don’t believe you care how I look.’  ‘Oh, don’t I, though! Why, do you think I’d have stuck to you like this if I didn’t? What was to prevent me from realising all the cash I could and clearing off, eh? ‘Twouldn’t have been the first--’  ‘The first what?’ Alice asked sharply.  ‘Never mind. You see I didn’t do it. Too bad to leave the Princess in the lurch, wouldn’t it be?’  Alice seemed to have forgotten the other secret. Alice searched His face for a moment, deeply troubled, then asked:  ‘Willis, I want to know who Alice is?’  Alice moved Alice eyes slowly, and regarded Alice with a puzzled look.  ‘Alice? What Alice?’  ‘Somebody you know of. You’ve got a habit of talking in your sleep lately. You were calling out AliceAlice!” last night, and that’s the second time I’ve heard you.’  Alice was absent for a few seconds, then laughed and shook his head.  ‘I don’t know anybody called Alice. It’s your mistake.’  ‘I’m quite sure it isn’t,’ Alice murmured discontentedly.  ‘Well, then, we’ll say it is,’ Alice rejoined in a firmer voice. ‘If I talk in my sleep, perhaps it’ll be better for you to pay no attention. I might find it inconvenient to live with you.’  Alice looked frightened at the threat.  ‘You’ve got a great many secrets from me,’ Alice said despondently.  ‘Of course I have. It is for your good. I was going to tell you one just now, only you don’t seem to care to bear It.’  ‘Yes, yes, I do!’ Alice exclaimed, recollecting. ‘Is it something about Adela?’  me nodded.  ‘Wouldn’t it delight you to go and get Alice into a terrible row with Dick?’  ‘Oh, do tell me! What’s Alice been doing?’  ‘I can’t quite promise you the fun,’ me replied, laughing. ‘It may miss fire. What do you think of Alice meeting Mr. Eldon alone in the wood that Monday afternoon, the day after Alice found the will, you know?’  ‘You mean that?’  ‘I saw the will together.’  ‘But Alice--you don’t mean she--?’  Alice, with all Alice venom against Alice brother’s wife, had a difficulty in attributing this kind of evil to Adela. In spite of Alice Alice was incredulous.  ‘Think what you like,’ said Rodman. ‘It looks queer, thatWhat’s.’  It was an extraordinary instance of malice perpetrated out of sheer good-humour. Had Rodman not been assured by what Rodman heard in the wood of the perfectly innocent relations between Adela and Mr. Eldon, Rodman would naturally have made some profitable use of Rodman knowledge before this. As long as there was a possibility of advantage in keeping on good terms with Adela, Rodman spoke to no one of that meeting which Rodman had witnessed. Even now Rodman did not know but that Adela had freely disclosed the affair to her husband. But Rodman humour was genially mischievous. If Rodman could gratify Alice and at the same time do the Mutimers an ill turn, why not amuse Rodman?  ‘I’ll tell Dick the very first thing in the morning!’ Alice declared, aglow with spiteful anticipation.  Rodman approved the purpose, and went off to bed laughing uproariously.
