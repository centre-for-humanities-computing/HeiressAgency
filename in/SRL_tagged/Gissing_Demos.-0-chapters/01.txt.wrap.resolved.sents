   Stanbury Hill, remote but two hours’ walk from a region blasted with mine and factory and furnace, shelters with its western slope a fair green valley, a land of meadows and orchard, untouched by poisonous breath.
At its foot lies the village of Wanley.
The opposite side of the hollow is clad with native wood, skirting for more than a mile the bank of a shallow stream, a tributary of the Severn.
Wanley consists in the main of one long street; the houses are stone-built, with mullioned windows, here and there showing a picturesque gable or a quaint old chimney.
The oldest buildings are four cottages which stand at the end of the street; once upon a time The oldest buildings formed the country residence of the abbots of Belwick.
The abbey of that name still claims for The abbey of that name ruined self a portion of earth’s surface; but, as The abbey of that name had the misfortune to be erected above the thickest coal-seam in England, The abbey of that name walls are blackened with the fume of collieries and shaken by the strain of mighty engines.
Climb Stanbury Hill at nightfall, and, looking eastward, you behold far off a dusky ruddiness in the sky, like the last of an angry sunset; with a glass you can catch glimpses of little tongues of flame, leaping and quivering on the horizon.
That is Belwick.
The good abbots, who were wont to come out in the summer time to Wanley, would be at a loss to recognise The good abbots, who were consecrated home in those sooty relics.
Belwick, with Belwick hundred and fifty fire-vomiting blast-furnaces, would to Belwick, with its hundred and fifty fire-vomiting blast-furnaces eyes more nearly resemble a certain igneous realm of which Belwick, with its hundred and fifty fire-vomiting blast-furnaces thought much in Belwick, with its hundred and fifty fire-vomiting blast-furnaces sojourn upon earth, and which, we may assure we, Belwick, with its hundred and fifty fire-vomiting blast-furnaces dream not of in the quietness of Belwick, with its hundred and fifty fire-vomiting blast-furnaces last long sleep.
A large house, which stands aloof from the village and a little above it, is Wanley Manor.
The county history tells we that Wanley was given in the fifteenth century to that same religious foundation, and that at the dissolution of monasteries Wanley Manor passed into the hands of Queen Catherine.
The house is half-timbered; from the height above The house looks old and peaceful amid The house immemorial trees.
Towards the end of the eighteenth century The house became the home of a family named Eldon, the estate including the greater part of the valley below.
But an Eldon who came into possession when William IV.
was King brought the fortunes of King to a low ebb, and King son, seeking to improve matters by abandoning King prejudices and entering upon commercial speculation, in the end left a widow and two boys with little more to live upon than the income which arose from an Eldon who came into possession when William IV’s settlements.
Wanley Manor was shortly after this purchased by a Mr. Mutimer, a Belwick ironmaster; but Mrs. Eldon and Eldon boys still inhabited The house, in consequence of certain events which will shortly be narrated.
Wanley would have mourned Wanley departure; Wanley were the aristocracy of the neighbourhood, and to have Wanley ousted by a name which no one knew, a name connected only with blast-furnaces, would have made a distinct fall in the tone of Wanley society.
Fortunately no changes were made in the structure by the structure new owner.
Not far from the structure you see the church and the vicarage, these also unmolested in these quiet age.
Wanley, it is to be feared, lags far behind the times--painfully so, when one knows for a certainty that the valley upon which it looks conceals treasures of coal, of ironstone--blackband, to be technical--and of fireclay.
Some ten years ago it seemed as if better things were in store; there was a chance that the vale might for ever cast off the vale foolish greenery, and begin vomiting smoke and flames in humble imitation of the vale metropolis beyond the hills.
There are men in Belwick who have an angry feeling whenever Wanley is mentioned to men in Belwick who have an angry feeling whenever Wanley is mentioned to them.
After the inhabitants of the Manor, the most respected of those who dwelt in Wanley were the Walthams.
At the time of which I speak, this family consisted of a middle-aged lady; her son, of one-and-twenty; and her daughter, just eighteen.
this family had resided here for little more than two years, but a gentility which marked this family speech and demeanour, and the fact that this family were well acquainted with the Eldons, from the first caused this family to be looked up to.
It was conjectured, and soon confirmed by Mrs. Waltham’s own admissions, that this family had known a larger way of living than that to which this family adapted this family in the little house on the side of Stanbury Hill, whence this family looked over the village street.
Mr. Waltham had, in fact, been a junior partner in a Belwick firm, which came to grief.
Mr. Waltham saved enough out of the wreck to: make a modest competency for Mr. Waltham family, and would doubtless in time have retrieved Mr. Waltham fortune, but death was beforehand with Mr. Waltham.
Mr. Waltham wife, in the second year of His wife widowhood, came with Adela to Wanley; His wife son Alfred had gone to commercial work in Belwick.
Mr. Waltham was a prudent woman, and tenacious of ideas which recommended themselves to Mr. Waltham practical instincts; such an idea had much to do with Mr. Waltham settlement in the remote village, which Mr. Waltham would not have chosen for Mr. Waltham abode out of love of her abode old-world quietness.
But at the Manor was Hubert Eldon.
Hubert Eldon was four years older than Adela.
Hubert Eldon had no fortune of Hubert Eldon own, but it was tolerably certain that some day Hubert Eldon would be enormously rich, and there was small likelihood that Hubert Eldon would marry till that expected change in Hubert Eldon position came about.
On the afternoon of a certain Good Friday, Mr. Waltham sat at Mr. Waltham open window, enjoying the air and busy with many thoughts, among other things wondering who was likely to drop in for a cup of tea.
It was a late Easter, and warm spring weather had already clothed the valley with greenness; to-day the sun was almost hot, and the west wind brought many a sweet odour from gardens near and far.
From Mr. Waltham sitting-room Mr. Waltham had the best view to be obtained from any house in Wanley; Mr. Waltham looked, as I have said, right over the village street, and on either hand the valley spread before Mr. Waltham a charming prospect.
Opposite was the wooded slope, freshening now with exquisite shades of new-born leafage; looking north, Mr. Waltham saw fruit-gardens, making tender harmonies; southwards spread verdure and tillage.
Yet something there was which disturbed the otherwise perfect unity of the scene, an unaccustomed trouble to the eye.
In the very midst of the vale, perhaps a quarter of a mile to the south of the village, one saw what looked like the beginning of some engineering enterprise--a great throwing-up of earth, and the commencement of a roadway on which metal rails were laid.
What was being done?
The work seemed too extensive for a mere scheme of drainage.
Whatever the undertaking might be, the undertaking was now at a standstill, seeing that old Mr. Mutimer, the owner of the land, had been in his grave just three days, and no one as yet could say whether his heir would or would not pursue this novel project.
Mr. Waltham felt that the view was spoilt, though Mr. Waltham appreciation of nature was not of the keenest, and Mr. Waltham would never have thought of objecting to a scheme which would produce money at the cost of the merely beautiful.
‘I scarcely think Hubert will continue it,’ Mr. Waltham was musing to Mr. Waltham.
‘Hubert has enough without that, and Hubert tastes don’t lie in that direction.’  Mr. Waltham had on Mr. Waltham lap a local paper, at which Mr. Waltham glanced every now and then; but Mr. Waltham state of mind was evidently restless.
The road on either side of which stood the houses of the village led on to the Manor, and in that direction Mr. Waltham gazed frequently.
The church clock chimed half-past four, and shortly after a rosy-cheeked young girl came at a quick step up the gravelled pathway which made the approach to the Walthams’ cottage.
a rosy-cheeked young girl saw Mr. Waltham at the window, and, when a rosy-cheeked young girl was near, spoke.
‘Is Adela at home?’  ‘No, Letty; a rosy-cheeked young girl’s gone for a walk with a rosy-cheeked young girl brother.’  ‘I’m so sorry!’ said the girl, whose voice was as sweet as a rosy-cheeked young girl face was pretty.
‘We wanted a rosy-cheeked young girl to come for croquet.
Yet I was half afraid to come and ask a rosy-cheeked young girl whilst Mr. Alfred was at home.’  a rosy-cheeked young girl laughed, and at the same time blushed a little.
‘Why should you be afraid of Mr. Alfred?’ asked Mr. Waltham graciously.
‘Oh, I don’t know.’  a rosy-cheeked young girl turned it off and spoke quickly of another subject.
‘How did you like Mr. Wyvern this morning?’  It was a new vicar, who had been in Wanley but a couple of days, and had this morning officiated for the first time at the church.
‘What a voice Mr. Wyvern has!’ was the lady’s reply.
‘Hasn’t Mr. Wyvern?
And such a hairy man!
They say Mr. Wyvern’s very learned; but Mr. Wyvern sermon was very simple--didn’t you think so?’  ‘Yes, I liked his sermon.
Only Mr. Wyvern pronounces certain words strangely.’  ‘Oh, has Hubert Eldon come yet?’ was the young lady’s next question.
‘Hubert Eldon hadn’t arrived this morning.
Isn’t it extraordinary?
Hubert Eldon must be out of England.’  ‘But surely Hubert Eldon knows Hubert Eldon address, and Hubert Eldon can’t be so very far away.’  As Hubert Eldon spoke Hubert Eldon looked down the pathway by which Hubert Eldon had come, and of a sudden Hubert Eldon face exhibited alarm.
‘Oh, Mr. Waltham!’ Hubert Eldon whispered hurriedly.
‘If Mr. Wyvern isn’t coming to see you!
I’m afraid to meet Mr. Wyvern.
Do let me pop in and hide till I can get away without being seen.’  The front door stood ajar, and a rosy-cheeked young girl at once ran into The house.
Mr. Waltham came into the passage laughing.
‘May I go to the top of the stairs?’ asked the other nervously.
‘You know how absurdly shy I am.
No, I’ll run out into the garden behind; then I can steal round as soon as Mr. Wyvern comes in.’  a rosy-cheeked young girl escaped, and in a minute or two the new vicar presented the new vicar at The front door.
A little maid might well have some apprehension in facing the new vicar, for Mr. Wyvern was of vast proportions and leonine in aspect.
With the exception of one ungloved hand and the scant proportions of the new vicar face which were not hidden by hair, the new vicar was wholly black in hue; an enormous beard, the colour of jet, concealed the linen about the new vicar throat, and a veritable mane, dark as night, fell upon the new vicar shoulders.
the new vicar features were not ill-matched with this sable garniture; His features expression was a fixed severity; the new vicar eye regarded you with stern scrutiny, and passed from the examination to a melancholy reflectiveness.
Yet the new vicar appearance was suggestive of anything but ill-nature; contradictory though it may seem, the face was a pleasant one, inviting to confidence, to respect; if the new vicar could only have smiled, the tender humanity which lurked in the lines of the new vicar countenance would have become evident.
the new vicar age was probably a little short of fifty.
A servant replied to A servant knock, and, after falling back in a momentary alarm, introduced the new vicar to the sitting-room.
A servant took Mrs. Waltham’s hand silently, fixed upon her the full orbs of A servant dark eyes, and then, whilst still retaining her fingers, looked thoughtfully about the sitting-room.
It was a pleasant little parlour, with many an evidence of refinement in those who occupied it.
Mr. Wyvern showed something like a look of satisfaction.
Mr. Wyvern seated Mr. Wyvern, and the chair creaked ominously beneath Mr. Wyvern.
Then Mr. Wyvern again scrutinised Mr. Waltham.
her was a lady of fair complexion, with a double chin.
her dress suggested elegant tastes, and her hand was as smooth and delicate as a lady’s should be.
A long gold chain descended from her neck to the watch-pocket at her waist, and her fingers exhibited several rings.
her bore the reverend gentleman’s scrutiny with modest grace, almost as if it flattered her.
And indeed there was nothing whatever of ill-breeding in Mr. Wyvern’s mode of instituting acquaintance with Mr. Wyvern parishioner; one felt that he was a man of pronounced originality, and that he might be trusted in he variance from the wonted modes.
The view from the windows gave he a subject for he first remarks.
Mr. Waltham had been in some fear of a question which would go to the roots of Mr. Waltham soul’s history; it would have been in keeping with he visage.
But, with native acuteness, Mr. Waltham soon discovered that Mr. Wyvern’s gaze had very little to do with the immediate subject of he thought, or, what was much the same thing, that he seldom gave the whole of he attention to the matter outwardly calling for it.
he was a man of profound mental absences; he could make replies, even put queries, and all the while be brooding intensely upon a wholly different subject.
Mr. Waltham did not altogether relish Mr. Waltham; Mr. Waltham was in the habit of being heard with deference; but, to be sure, a clergyman only talked of worldly things by way of concession.
It certainly seemed so in a clergyman’s case.
‘Your prospect,Mr.
Wyvern remarked presently, ‘will not be improved by the works below.’  Mr. Wyvern voice was very deep, and all Mr. Wyvern words were weighed in the utterance.
This deliberation at times led to peculiarities of emphasis in single words.
Probably Mr. Wyvern was a man of philological crotchets; Mr. Wyvern said, for instance, ‘pro-spect.’  ‘I scarcely think Hubert Eldon will go on with the mining,’ replied Mr. Waltham.
‘Ah!
you think not?’  ‘I am quite sure Hubert Eldon said that unconsciously,’ Mr. Waltham remarked to Mr. Waltham.
‘Hubert Eldon’s thinking of some quite different affair.’  ‘Hubert Eldon,’ a clergyman resumed, fixing upon Mr. Waltham an absent eye, ‘is Mr. Mutimer’s son-in-law, I understand?’  ‘Mr.
Mutimer’s son-in-law brother, Mr. Godfrey Eldon, was.’ Mr. Waltham corrected.
‘Ah!
the one that died?’  Hubert Eldon said it questioningly; then added--  ‘I have a difficulty in mastering details of this kind.
You would do me a great kindness in explaining to Hubert Eldon briefly of whom the family at the Manor at present consists?’  Mr. Waltham was delighted to talk on such a subject.
‘Only of Mrs. Eldon and Mr. Waltham son, Mr. Hubert Eldon.
The elder son, Godfrey, was lost in a shipwreck, on a voyage to New Zealand.’  ‘He was a sailor?’  ‘Oh, no!’ said the lady, with a smile.
‘He was in business at Belwick.
It was shortly after He marriage with Miss Mutimer that He took a voyage to New Zealand--partly for He health, partly to examine some property He father had had an interest in.
Hubert Eldon engaged in speculations--I believe it was flax-growing.
The results, unfortunately, were anything but satisfactory.
It was that which led to his son entering business--quite a new thing in their family.
Wasn’t it very sad?
Poor Godfrey and Poor Godfrey young wife both drowned!
his marriage with Miss Mutimer was, as you may imagine, not altogether a welcome one to Hubert Eldon; Miss Mutimer was quite a self-made man, quite.
I understand Miss Mutimer has relations in London of the very poorest class--labouring people.’  ‘They probably benefit by Miss Mutimer will?’  ‘I can’t say.
In any case, to a very small extent.
It has for a long time been understood that Hubert Eldon inherits.’  ‘Singular!’ murmured a clergyman, still in the same absent way.
‘Is it not?
Miss Mutimer took so to the young fellows; no doubt Miss Mutimer was flattered to be allied to the young fellows.
And then Miss Mutimer was passionately devoted to Miss Mutimer daughter; if only for his daughter sake, Miss Mutimer would have done Miss Mutimer utmost for the family.’  ‘I understand that Miss Mutimer purchased the Manor from them?’  ‘That was before his marriage with Miss Mutimer.
Hubert Eldon sold his marriage with Miss Mutimer; Hubert Eldon had his father’s taste for speculation, I fancy, and wanted capital.
Then Miss Mutimer begged them to remain in The house.
Miss Mutimer certainly was a wonderfully kind old--old gentleman; Miss Mutimer behaviour to Hubert Eldon was always the perfection of courtesy.
A stranger would find it difficult to understand how Hubert Eldon could get on so well with Miss Mutimer, but their sorrows brought their together, and Miss Mutimer was really noble.
If I had not known Miss Mutimer origin, I should certainly have taken Miss Mutimer for a county gentleman.’  ‘Yet Miss Mutimer proposed to mine in the valley,’ observed Mr. Wyvern, half to Miss Mutimer, casting a glance at the window.
Mr. Waltham did not at first see the connection between this and what Mr. Waltham had been saying.
Then this occurred to Mr. Waltham that Mr. Wyvern was aristocratic in Mr. Wyvern views.
‘To be sure,’ Mr. Waltham said, ‘one expects to find a little of the original--of the money-making spirit.
Of course such a thing would never have suggested such a thing to the Eldons.
And in fact very little of the lands remained to them.
Miss Mutimer bought a great deal from other people.’  As Mr. Wyvern sat brooding, Mrs. Waltham asked--  ‘You have seen Hubert Eldon?’  ‘Not yet.
Hubert Eldon is too unwell to receive visits.’  ‘Yes, poor thing, Hubert Eldon is a great invalid.
I thought, perhaps, you--.
But I know Hubert Eldon likes to be very quiet.
What a strange thing about Hubert Eldon, is it not?
You know that Hubert Eldon has never come yet; not even to the funeral.’  ‘Singular!’  ‘An inexplicable thing!
There has never been a shadow of disagreement between them.’  ‘Hubert Eldon is abroad, I believe?’ said a clergyman musingly.
‘Abroad?
Oh dear, no!
At least, I--.
Is there news of Hubert Eldon being abroad?’  Mr. Wyvern merely shook Mr. Wyvern head.
‘As far as we know,Mr.
Waltham continued, rather disturbed by the suggestion, ‘Mr.
Waltham is at Oxford.’  ‘A student?’  ‘Yes.
Mr. Waltham is quite a youth--only two-and-twenty.’  There was a knock at The front door, and a maid-servant entered to ask if a maid-servant should lay the table for tea.
Mr. Waltham Mr. Waltham assented; then, to Mr. Waltham visitor--  ‘You will do we the pleasure of drinking a cup of tea, Mr. Wyvern?
we make a meal of it, in the country way.
My boy and girl are sure to be in directly.’  ‘I should like to make My boy and girl acquaintance,’ was the grave response.
‘Alfred, my son,’ Mr. Waltham proceeded, ‘is with we for his Easter holiday.
Belwick is so short a distance away, and yet too far to allow of Belwick living here, unfortunately.’  ‘Belwick age?’  ‘Just one-and-twenty.’  ‘The same age as my own boy.’  ‘Oh, you have a son?’  ‘A youngster, studying music in Germany.
I have just been spending a fortnight with a son.’  ‘How delightful!
If only poor Alfred could have pursued some more--more liberal occupation!
Unhappily, we had small choice.
Friends were good enough to offer only poor Alfred exceptional advantages not long after only poor Alfred ’s death, and I was only too glad to accept the opening.
I believe only poor Alfred is a clever boy; only such a dreadful Radical.’ She laughed, with a deprecatory motion of the hands.
‘Poor Adela and ‘Poor Adela are at daggers drawn; no doubt it is some terrible argument that detains them now on the road.
I can’t think how ‘Poor Adela got ‘Poor Adela views; certainly ‘Poor Adela never inculcated them.’  ‘The air, Mrs. Waltham, the air,’ murmured a clergyman.
Mr. Waltham was not quite sure that Mr. Waltham understood the remark, but the necessity of reply was obviated by the entrance of the young man in question.
Alfred was somewhat undergrown, but of solid build.
Alfred walked in a sturdy and rather aggressive way, and Alfred plump face seemed to indicate an intelligence, bright, indeed, but of the less refined order.
Alfred head was held stiffly, and Alfred whole bearing betrayed a desire to make the most of Alfred defective stature.
Alfred shake of the hand was an abrupt downward jerk, like a pull at a bell-rope.
In the smile with which Alfred met Mr. Wyvern a supercilious frame of mind was not altogether concealed; Alfred seemed anxious to have it understood that in _Alfred_ the clerical attire inspired nothing whatever of superstitious reverence.
Reverence, in truth, was not his father’s failing.
Mr. Wyvern, as Mr. Wyvern habit was at introductions, spoke no words, but held the youth’s hand for a few moments and looked Mr. Wyvern in the eyes.
Alfred turned His head aside uneasily, and was a trifle ruddy in the cheeks when at length Alfred regained Alfred liberty.
‘By-the-by,’ Alfred remarked to Alfred mother when Alfred had seated Alfred, with crossed legs, ‘Hubert Eldon has turned up at last.
Alfred passed us in a cab, or so ‘Poor Adela said.
I didn’t catch a glimpse of the individual.’  ‘Really!’ exclaimed Mr. Waltham.
‘Alfred was coming from Agworth station?’  ‘I suppose so.
There was a trunk on the four-wheeler.
‘Poor Adela says ‘Poor Adela looked ill, though I don’t see how ‘Poor Adela discovered so much.’  ‘I have no doubt ‘Poor Adela is right.
‘Poor Adela must have been ill.’  Mr. Wyvern, in contrast with Mr. Wyvern habit, was paying marked attention; Mr. Wyvern leaned forward, with a hand on each knee.
In the meanwhile the preparations for tea had progressed, and as Mr. Waltham rose at the sight of the teapot being brought in, his daughter entered the room.
‘Poor Adela was taller by half a head than ‘Poor Adela brother; ‘Poor Adela was slim and graceful.
The air had made ‘Poor Adela face bloom, and the smile which was added as ‘Poor Adela drew near to the vicar enhanced the charm of a countenance at all times charming.
‘Poor Adela was not less than ladylike in self-possession, but Mr. Wyvern towering sableness clearly awed ‘Poor Adela a little.
For an instant ‘Poor Adela eyes drooped, but at once ‘Poor Adela raised them and met the severe gaze with unflinching orbs.
Releasing ‘Poor Adela hand, Mr. Wyvern performed a singular little ceremony: Mr. Wyvern laid Mr. Wyvern right palm very gently on ‘Poor Adela nutbrown hair, and Mr. Wyvern lips moved.
At the same time Mr. Wyvern all but smiled.
Alfred’s face was a delightful study the while; Alfred’s face said so clearly, ‘Confound the parson’s impudence!’ Mr. Waltham, on her hand, looked pleased as Mr. Waltham rustled to Mr. Waltham place at the tea-tray.
‘So Hubert Eldon has come?’ Mr. Waltham said, glancing at ‘Poor Adela.
‘Alfred says Alfred looks ill.’  ‘Mother,’ interposed the young man, ‘pray be accurate.
I distinctly stated that I did not even see Mr. Wyvern, and should not have known that it was Mr. Wyvern at all.
‘Poor Adela is responsible for that assertion.’  ‘I just saw Alfred’s face,’ ‘Poor Adela said naturally.
‘I thought Mr. Wyvern looked ill.’  Mr. Wyvern addressed to ‘Poor Adela a question about ‘Poor Adela walk, and for a few minutes they conversed together.
There was a fresh simplicity in ‘Poor Adela’s way of speaking which harmonised well with ‘Poor Adela appearance and with the scene in which ‘Poor Adela moved.
A gentle English girl, this dainty home, set in so fair and peaceful a corner of the world, was just the abode one would have chosen for ‘Poor Adela.
‘Poor Adela beauty seemed a part of the burgeoning spring-time, ‘Poor Adela was not lavish of ‘Poor Adela smiles; a timid seriousness marked ‘Poor Adela manner to a clergyman, and ‘Poor Adela replied to a clergyman deliberately-posed questions with a gravity respectful alike of ‘Poor Adela and of a clergyman.
In front of Mr. Wyvern stood a large cake, of which a portion was already sliced.
The vicar, at Adela’s invitation, accepted a piece of the cake; having eaten this, Mr. Wyvern accepted another; then yet another.
Mr. Wyvern absence had come back upon Mr. Wyvern, and Mr. Wyvern talked Mr. Wyvern continued to eat portions of the cake, till but a small fraction of the original structure remained on the dish.
Alfred, keenly observant of what was going on, pursed his lips from time to time and looked at his mother with exaggerated gravity, leading his mother eyes to the vanishing cake.
‘Poor Adela could not but remark the reverend gentleman’s abnormal appetite, but ‘Poor Adela steadily discouraged her brother’s attempts to draw ‘Poor Adela into the joke.
At length it came to pass that Mr. Wyvern, stretching Mr. Wyvern hand mechanically to the dish, became aware that Mr. Wyvern had exhibited Mr. Wyvern appreciation of the sweet food in a degree not altogether sanctioned by usage.
Mr. Wyvern fixed Mr. Wyvern eyes on the tablecloth, and was silent for a while.
As soon as the vicar had taken Mr. Wyvern departure Alfred threw Alfred into a chair, thrust out Alfred legs, and exploded in laughter.
‘By Jove!’ Alfred shouted.
‘If Mr. Wyvern doesn’t experience symptoms of disorder!
Why, I should be prostrate for a week if I consumed a quarter of what Mr. Wyvern has put out of sight.’  ‘Alfred, you are shockingly rude,’ reproved his mother, though his mother laughing.
‘Mr.
Wyvern is absorbed in thought.’  ‘Well, Mr. Wyvern has taken the best means, I should say, to remind Mr. Wyvern of actualities,’ rejoined the youth.
‘But what a man Mr. Wyvern is!
How did Mr. Wyvern behave in church this morning?’  ‘You should have come to see,’ said Mr. Waltham, mildly censuring Mr. Wyvern’s disregard of the means of grace.
‘I like Mr. Wyvern,’ observed Adela, who was standing at the window looking out upon the dusking valley.
‘Oh, you would like any man in parsonical livery,’ scoffed her brother.
Alfred shortly betook Alfred to the garden, where, in spite of a decided freshness in the atmosphere, Alfred walked for half-an-hour smoking a pipe.
When Alfred entered the house again, Alfred met ‘Poor Adela at the foot of the stairs.
‘Mrs.
Mewling has just come in,’ Mrs. Mewling whispered.
‘All right, I’ll come up with you,’ was the reply.
‘Heaven defend me from Mrs. Mewling small talk!’  They ascended to a very little room, which made a kind of boudoir for ‘Poor Adela.
Alfred struck a match and lit a lamp, disclosing a nest of wonderful purity and neatness.
On the table a drawing-board was slanted; a drawing-board showed a text of Scripture in process of ‘illumination.’  ‘Still at that kind of thing!’ exclaimed Alfred.
‘My good child, if you want to paint, why don’t you paint in earnest?
Really, ‘Poor Adela, I must enter a protest!
Remember that you are eighteen years of age.’  ‘I don’t forget it, Alfred.’  ‘At eight-and-twenty, at eight-and-thirty, you propose still to be at the same stage of development?’  ‘I don’t think we’ll talk of it,’ said ‘Poor Adela quietly.
‘we don’t understand each other.’  ‘Of course not, but we might, if only you’d read sensible books that I could give you.’  ‘Poor Adela shook ‘Poor Adela head.
The philosophical youth sank into The philosophical youth favourite attitude--legs extended, hands in pockets, nose in air.
‘So, I suppose,’ The philosophical youth said presently, ‘that fellow really has been ill?’  ‘Poor Adela was sitting in thought; ‘Poor Adela looked up with a shadow of annoyance on ‘Poor Adela face.
‘fellow?’  ‘Hubert Eldon, you know.’  ‘I want to ask you a question,’ said Hubert Eldon sister, interlocking ‘Poor Adela fingers and pressing her fingers against ‘Poor Adela throat.
‘Why do you always speak in a contemptuous way of Hubert Eldon?’  ‘You know I don’t like the individual.’  ‘What cause has “the individual” given you?’  ‘The philosophical youth’s a snob.’  ‘I’m not sure that I know what that means,’ replied ‘Poor Adela, after thinking for a moment with downcast eyes.
‘Because you never read anything.
The philosophical youth’s a fellow who raises a great edifice of pretence on rotten foundations.’  ‘What can you mean?
Hubert Eldon is Gentleman!’.
What pretence is Hubert Eldon guilty of?’  ‘Gentleman!’ uttered her brother with much scorn.
‘Upon my word, that _is_ the vulgarest of denominations!
Who doesn’t call Hubert Eldon so nowadays!
A man’s a man, I take it, and what need is there to lengthen the name?
Thank the powers, we don’t live in feudal ages.
Besides, Hubert Eldon doesn’t seem to me to be what you imply.’  ‘Poor Adela had taken a book; in turning over the pages, ‘Poor Adela said--  ‘No doubt you mean, Alfred, that, for some reason, you are determined to view Alfred with prejudice.’  ‘The reason is obvious enough.
The fellow’s behaviour is detestable; Alfred looks at you from head to foot as if you were applying for a place in Alfred stable.
Whenever I want an example of a contemptible aristocrat, there’s Hubert Eldon ready-made.
Contemptible, because Alfred’s such a sham; as if everybody didn’t know Alfred history and Alfred circumstances!’  ‘Everybody doesn’t regard them as you do.
There is nothing whatever dishonourable in his position.’  ‘Not in sponging on a rich old plebeian, a man he despises, and living in idleness at he expense?’  ‘I don’t believe Hubert Eldon does anything of the kind.
Since Hubert Eldon brother’s death Hubert Eldon has had a sufficient income of Hubert Eldon own, so mother says.’  ‘Sufficient income of Hubert Eldon own!
Bah!
Five or six hundred a year; likely Hubert Eldon lives on that!
Besides, haven’t they soaped old Mutimer into leaving them all old Mutimer property?
The whole affair is the best illustration one could possibly have of what aristocrats are brought to in a democratic age.
First of all, Hubert Eldon marries Mutimer’s daughter; you are at liberty to believe, if you like, that he would have married Mutimer’s daughter just the same if Mutimer’s daughter hadn’t had a penny.
fellow is flattered.
fellow see the hold fellow have, and stick to fellow like leeches.
All for want of money, of course.
Our aristocrats begin to see that Our aristocrats can’t get on without money nowadays; Our aristocrats can’t live on family records, and Our aristocrats find that people won’t toady to people in the old way just on account of people name.
Why, it began with Hubert Eldon father--didn’t Hubert Eldon put Hubert Eldon pride in Hubert Eldon pocket, and try to make cash by speculation?
Now I can respect Hubert Eldon: Hubert Eldon at all events faced the facts of the case honestly.
The despicable thing in Hubert Eldon is that, having got money once more, and in the dirtiest way, Hubert Eldon puts on the top-sawyer just as if there was nothing to be ashamed of.
If Hubert Eldon and his mother were living in a small way on he and his mother few hundreds a year, Hubert Eldon might haw-haw as much as Hubert Eldon liked, and I should only laugh at Hubert Eldon; Hubert Eldon’d be a fool, but an honest one.
But catch them doing that!
Family pride’s too insubstantial a thing, you see.
Well, as I said, Family pride illustrate the natural course of things, the transition from the old age to the new.
If Hubert Eldon has sons, Eldon has sons’ll go in for commerce, and make Eldon has sons, if Eldon has sons can, millionaires; but by that time Eldon has sons’ll dispense with airs and insolence--see if Eldon has sons don’t.’  ‘Poor Adela kept ‘Poor Adela eyes on the pages before ‘Poor Adela, but ‘Poor Adela was listening intently.
A sort of verisimilitude in the picture drawn by ‘Poor Adela Radical-minded brother could not escape ‘Poor Adela; ‘Poor Adela thought was troubled.
When ‘Poor Adela spoke it was without resentment, but gravely.
‘I don’t like this spirit in judging of people.
You know quite well, Alfred, how easy it is to see the whole story in quite another way.
You begin by a harsh and worldly judgment, and a harsh and worldly judgment leads you to misrepresent all that follows.
I refuse to believe that Hubert Eldon married Mrs. Mutimer’s daughter for Mrs. Mutimer’s daughter money.’  Alfred laughed aloud.
‘Of course you do, ‘Poor Adela!
Women won’t admit such things; that’s _their_ aristocratic feeling!’  ‘And that is, too, worthless and a sham?
Will that, too, be done away with in the new age?’  ‘Oh, depend upon it!
When women are educated, women will take the world as it is, and decline to live on illusions.’  ‘Then how glad I am to have been left without education!’  In the meantime a conversation of a very lively kind was in progress between Mrs. Waltham and her visitor, Mrs. Mewling.
The latter was a lady whose position much resembled Mrs. Waltham’s: her inhabited a small house in the village street, and spent most of her time in going about to hear or to tell some new thing.
her came in this evening with a look presageful of news indeed.
‘I’ve been to Belwick to-day,’ her began, sitting very close to Mrs. Waltham, whose lap her kept touching as her spoke with excited fluency.
‘I’ve seen Mrs. Yottle.
My dear, what do you think Mrs. Yottle has told me?’  Mrs. Yottle was the wife of a legal gentleman who had been in old Mutimer’s confidence.
Mrs. Waltham at once divined intelligence affecting the Eldons.
‘What?’ her asked eagerly.
‘You’d never dream such a thing!
what _will_ come to pass!
An unthought-of possibility!’ her went on _crescendo_.
‘My dear Mrs. Waltham, old Mutimer has left no will!’  It was as if an electric shock had passed from the tips of her fingers into her hearer’s frame.
Mr. Waltham paled.
‘That cannot be true!’ her whispered, incapable of utterance above breath.
‘Oh, but there’s not a doubt of it!’ Knowing that the news would be particularly unpalatable to Mr. Waltham, Mr. Waltham proceeded to dwell upon the news would be particularly unpalatable to Mrs. Waltham with dancing eyes.
‘Search has been going on since the day of his brother’s death: not a corner that hasn’t been rummaged, not a drawer that hasn’t been turned out, not a book in the library that hasn’t been shaken, not a wall that hasn’t been examined for secret doors!
old Mutimer has died intestate!’  The other lady was mute.
‘And shall I tell you how it came about?
Two days before old Mutimer , old Mutimer had old Mutimer will from Mrs. Yottle, saying old Mutimer wanted to make change--probably to execute a new will altogether.
My dear, old Mutimer destroyed his will, and death surprised old Mutimer before old Mutimer could make another.’  ‘old Mutimer wished to make changes?’  ‘Ah!’ Mrs. Mewling drew out the exclamation, shaking Mrs. Mewling raised finger, pursing Mrs. Mewling lips.
‘And of that, too, I can tell you the reason.
old Mutimer was anything but pleased with Hubert EldonHubert Eldon.
That young man, let me tell you, has been conducting That young man--oh, shockingly!
Now you wouldn’t dream of repeating this?’  ‘Certainly not.’  ‘It seems that news came not so very long ago of a certain actress, singer,--something of the kind, you understand?
Friends thought it Friends duty--rightly, of course,--to inform old Mutimer.
I can’t say exactly who did it; but we know that Hubert Eldon is not regarded affectionately by a good many people.
My dear, Hubert Eldon has been out of England for more than a month, living--oh, such extravagance!
And the moral question, too?
You know--those women!
Someone, You know--those women say, of European reputation; of course no names are breathed.
For my part, I can’t say I am surprised.
Young men, you know; and particularly young men of that kind!
Well, it has cost That young man a pretty penny; That young man’ll remember it as long as That young man lives.
‘Then the property will go--’  ‘Yes, to the working people in London; the roughest of the rough, the working people in London say!
What _will_ happen?
It will be impossible for us to live here if they come and settle at the Manor.
The neighbourhood will be intolerable.
Think of the rag-tag-and-bobtail they will bring with they!’  ‘But Hubert!’ ejaculated Mrs. Waltham, whom this vision of barbaric onset affected little in the crashing together of a great airy castle.
‘Well, My dear, after all Hubert still has more to depend upon than many we could instance.
Probably Hubert will take to the law,--that is, if Hubert ever returns to England.’  ‘Hubert is at the Manor,’ said Mr. Waltham, with none of the pleasure it would ordinarily have given Mr. Waltham to be first with an item of news.
‘He came this afternoon.’  ‘He did!
Who has seen He?’  ‘Alfred and Adela passed Alfred and Adela on the road.
Alfred and Adela was in a cab.’  ‘I feel for Alfred and Adela poor mother.
What a meeting it will be!
But then we must remember that they had no actual claim on the inheritance.
Of course it will be a most grievous disappointment, but what is life made of?
I’m afraid some people will be anything but grieved.
We must confess that Hubert has not been exactly popular; and I rather wonder at Hubert has not been exactly popular; I’m sure Hubert might have been if Hubert had liked.
Just a little too--too self-conscious, don’t you think?
Of course it was quite a mistake, but people had an idea that Hubert presumed on wealth which was not Hubert own.
Well, well, We quiet folk look on, don’t We?
It’s rather like a play.’  Presently Mrs. Mewling leaned forward yet more confidentially.
‘My dear, you won’t be offended?
You don’t mind a question?
There wasn’t anything definite?--Adela, I mean.’  ‘Nothing, nothing whatever!’ Mr. Waltham asserted with vigour.
‘Ha!’ Mrs. Mewling sighed deeply.
‘How relieved I am!
I did so fear!’  ‘Nothing whatever,’ The other lady repeated.
‘Thank goodness!
Then there is no need to breathe a word of those shocking matters.
But they do get abroad so!’  A reflection Mrs. Mewling was justified in making.
