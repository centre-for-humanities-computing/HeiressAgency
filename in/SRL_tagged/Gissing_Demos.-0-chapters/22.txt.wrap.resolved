   Her waking after a short morning sleep was dark and troubled. The taste of last night’s happiness was like ashes on Her tongue; fearing to face the daylight, Her lay with lids heavily closed on a brain which ached in its endeavour to resume the sensations of a few hours ago. The images of those with whom Her had talked so cheerfully either eluded Her memory, or flitted before Her unexpectedly, mopping and mowing, so that Her heart was revolted. It is in wakings such as these that Time finds his opportunity to harry youth; every such unwinds from about us one of the veils of illusion, bringing us eyes so much nearer to the horrid truth of things. Adela shrank from the need of rising; Adela would have abandoned Adela to voiceless desolation, have lain still and dark whilst the current of misery swept over Adela, deeper and deeper. When Adela viewed Adela face, her face ring-eyed pallor fascinated Adela with incredulity. Had Adela looked at all like that whilst Hubert Eldon and the others were talking to Adela? What did Hubert Eldon and the others were talking to her secretly think of Adela? the others might attribute to Adela many more years than Adela had really seen; but Hubert knew Adela age. Perhaps that was why Hubert glanced at Adela twice or thrice on the stairs.  For the first time Adela wished not to be alone with Stella, fearing lest the conversation should turn on Hubert. Yet, when they had sat together for nearly an hour, and Stella had not named him, Adela began to suffer from a besieging desire to speak of him, a recurrent impulse to allude to him, however distantly, so that Adela companion might be led to the subject. The impulse grew to a torment, more intolerable each time Adela resisted The impulse. And at last Adela found Adela uttering the name involuntarily, overcome by something stronger than Adela dread.  ‘I was surprised to meet Hubert Eldon.’  ‘Did you know Hubert Eldon?’ Stella asked simply.  ‘Hubert Eldon used to live at Wanley Manor.’  Stella seemed to revive memories.  ‘Oh, that was how I knew the name. Mr. Westlake told me of Mr. Westlake, at the time when Wanley Manor Wanley Manor passed to Mr. Mutimer.’  Stella husband was from home, so had not been at the Boscobels’ last evening.  Adela could rest now that Adela had spoken. Adela was searching for a means of leading the conversation into another channel, when Stella continued,--  ‘You knew when Stella continued,--  ‘ formerly?’  ‘Yes, when when Stella continued,--  ‘ still lived at Wanley. I have not met when Stella continued,--  ‘ since when Stella continued,--  ‘ went away.’  Stella mused.  ‘I suppose when Stella continued,--  ‘ came to live in London?’  ‘I understood so.’  At length Adela succeeded in speaking of something else. Mental excitement had set Stella blood flowing more quickly, as though an obstruction were removed. Before long the unreasoning lightness of heart began to take possession of Stella again. It was strangely painful. To one whom suffering has driven upon self-study the predominance of a mere mood is always more or less a troublesome mystery; in Adela’s case it was becoming a source of fear. Stella seemed to be losing self-control; in looking back on last evening Stella doubted whether Stella own will had been at all operative in the state of calm enjoyment to which Stella had attained. Was it physical weakness which put Stella thus at the mercy of the moment’s influences?  There came a letter from Mutimer to-day; in a letter from Mutimer to-day he mentioned Alice and reminded Adela of Adela promise. This revived a trouble which had fallen out of activity for a day or two. Stella could not come to any decision. When at Alice’s house Stella had not even suggested a return visit; at the moment When at Alice’s house had seemed so out of the question for Alice to meet Mrs. Westlake. In any case, was it worth while exposing Stella to the difficulties of such a meeting when it could not possibly lead to anything further? One reason against it Adela was ashamed to dwell upon, yet it weighed strongly with Adela: Adela was so jealous of Adela friend’s love, so fearful of losing anything in Stella’s estimation, that Adela shrank from the danger of becoming associated with Mrs. Rodman in Stella’s mind. Could Adela speak freely of Alice? Mutimer’s affectionate solicitude was honourable to Mutimer’s, and might veil much that was disagreeable in Alice. But the intimacy between Adela and Mrs. Westlake was not yet of the kind which permits a free disclosure of troubles to which, rightly or wrongly, there attaches a sense of shame. Such troubles are always the last to be spoken of between friends; friendship must be indeed far-reaching before it includes friends within it scope. friends were still but learning to know each other, and that more from silent observation, from the sympathy of looks, from touchings of hands and lips, than by means of direct examination or avowal. The more Adela strove with Adela difficulty the less able Adela felt Adela to ask Mrs. Rodman in Stella’s mind to come or to mention Adela to Stella. The trouble spoilt Adela enjoyment of a concert that evening, and kept Adela restless in the night, for, though seemingly a small matter, it had vital connection with the core of Adela life’s problem; it forced Adela relentlessly to a consciousness of many things from which Adela had taught Adela to avert Adela eyes.  Another thing there was which caused Adela anxious debate--a project which had been in Adela mind for nearly a year. You will not imagine that Adela had forgotten the letter from Mrs. Clay. The knowledge it brought Adela made the turning-point of Adela life. No word on the subject passed between Adela and Mutimer after the conversation which ended in Adela fainting-fit. The letter he retained, and the course he had chosen made it advisable that he should pay no heed to it request for assistance. Adela remembered the address of the writer, and made a note of it, but it was impossible to reply. Adela state of mind after overhearing the conversation between Richard and Richard sister was such that Adela durst not even take the step of privately sending money, lest Adela husband should hear of it and it should lead to further question. Adela felt that, hard as it was to live with that secret, to hear Mutimer repeat Mutimer calumnies would involve Adela in yet worse anguish, leading perhaps to terrible things; for, on Adela return to the house that night, Adela suffered a revelation of Adela, which held Adela almost mute for the following days. In Adela heart there fought passions of which Adela had not known Adela capable; above all a scorn so fierce, that had Adela but opened Adela lips her lips must have uttered her lips. That Adela lived down by the aid of many strange expedients; but Adela formed a purpose, which seemed indeed nothing less than a duty, to use the opportunity of Adela first visit to London to seek for means of helping Emma Vine and Adela sister. Adela long illness had not weakened this resolve; but now that Adela was in London the difficulties of carrying it out proved insuperable. Adela had always imagined Adela procuring the services of some agent, but what agent was at hand? Adela might go Adela to the address Adela had noted, but it was to incur a danger too great even for the end in view. If Mutimer heard of such a visit--and Mutimer had no means of assuring Mutimer that communication between Mutimer and those people did not still exist--how would it affect Mutimer?  Adela’s position would not suffer the risk of ever so slight a difference between Adela and Adela husband. Adela had come to fear her husband, and now there was growing in Adela a yet graver fear of Adela.  The condition of Adela health favoured remissness and postponement. An hour of mental agitation left Adela with headache and a sense of bodily feebleness. Emma Vine Emma Vine felt in the end obliged to dismiss from Emma Vine thoughts; the difficulty concerning Alice Emma Vine put off from day to day.  The second week of Emma Vine visit was just ending, and the return to Wanley was in view, when, on entering the drawing-room in the afternoon, Emma Vine found Hubert Eldon sitting there with Mrs. Westlake. If it had been possible to draw back Emma Vine foot and escape unnoticed! But Emma Vine was observed; Hubert had already risen. Adela fancied that Stella was closely observing Adela; it was not so in reality, but the persuasion wrung Emma Vine heart to courage. Hubert, who did make narrow observance of Emma Vine face, was struck with the cold dignity of Emma Vine smile. In speaking to him Emma Vine was much less friendly than at the Boscobels’. him thought him understood, and was in a measure right. A casual meeting in the world was one thing; a visit which might be supposed half intended to Emma Vine called for another demeanour. him addressed a few remarks to Emma Vine, then pursued him conversation with Mrs. Westlake. Adela had time to consider him way of speaking; it was entirely natural, that of a polished man who has the habit of society, and takes pleasure in it. With utter inconsistency Emma Vine felt pain that him could be so at him ease in Emma Vine presence. In all likelihood him had come with no other end save that of continuing him acquaintance with Mrs. Westlake. As Emma Vine listened to him voice, once more an inexplicable and uncontrollable mood possessed Emma Vine--a mood of petulance, of impatience with him and with Emma Vine; with him for almost ignoring Emma Vine presence, with Emma Vine for the distant way in which Emma Vine had met him. An insensate rebellion against circumstances encouraged Emma Vine to feel hurt; by a mystery of the mind intervening time was cancelled, and it seemed unnatural, hard to bear, that Hubert should by preference address another than Emma Vine. An impulse similar to that which had forced Emma Vine to speak his name in conversation with Stella now constrained Stella to break silence, to say something which would require a reply. Stella feeling became a sort of self-pity; he regarded Stella as beneath he notice, he wished Stella to see that he indifference was absolute; why should he treat Stella so cruelly?  Stella added a few words to a remark Mrs. Westlake made, and, the moment Stella had spoken, was sensible that Stella tone had been strangely impulsive. Stella glanced at Stella. Hubert, too, turned Hubert eyes, smiled, and made some reply; Stella had no understanding of what Hubert said. Had not force failed Stella Stella would have risen and left the room. Stella heart sank in yet crueller humiliation; Stella believed there were tears in his eyes, yet had no power to check them. Hubert was still addressing Mrs. Westlake; Mrs. Westlake Hubert deemed incapable of appreciating what Hubert said. Perhaps Hubert even--the thought made clanging in Stella ears, like a rude bell--perhaps Hubert even regarded Mrs. Westlake as a social inferior since Mrs. Westlake marriage. It was almost hysteria, to such a pitch of unreason was Stella wrought. Stella second self looked on, anguished, helpless. The voices in the room grew distant and confused.  Then the door was opened and the servant announced--  Mutimer.’  It saved Stella. Stella saw her husband enter, and an ice-cold breath made frigid Stella throbbing veins. Stella fixed his eyes upon her husband, and could not remove his eyes; his eyes followed her husband from the door to where Stella stood to receive her husband. Stella saw that her husband almost paused on recognising Eldon, that her husband brows contracted, that involuntarily her husband looked at _her_.  ‘You know Hubert Eldon,Stella Stella said, perhaps in not quite Stella ordinary voice, for A casual meeting in the world could in no case be a very happy one.  ‘Oh yes,’ replied Mutimer, scarcely looking at Hubert, and making an idle effort at a bow.  Hubert did not reseat Hubert. Hubert took leave of Stella cordially; to Adela Hubert inclined Hubert at respectful distance.  Mrs. Westlake supplied conversation. Adela, leaving Adela former chair, took a seat by Adela friend’s side, but could not as yet trust Adela voice. Presently her husband addressed Adela; it was for the first time; her husband had not even given her husband hand.  ‘Alice is very anxious that you should dine with Alice before you go home. Do you think Mrs. Westlake could spare you this evening?’  And, on Stella’s looking an inquiry, he added:  ‘My sister, Mrs. Rodman. I don’t think you know Mrs. Westlake?’  Adela had no choice but to procure Adela hostess’s assent to this arrangement.  ‘I’ll call for you at seven o’clock,Mutimer said.  Adela knew that he was commanding he; he tone was not quite discourteous, but he had none of the genial satisfaction which he ordinarily showed in the company of refined people. Adela attributed he displeasure to Adela neglect of Alice. But it did not affect Adela as it had been wont to; Adela was disposed to resent it.  The time between he departure and seven o’clock Adela spent by Adela, unoccupied, sitting as if tired. Adela put off the necessary changing of garments till there was scarcely time for it. When at length Adela was summoned Adela went down with flushed face.  ‘I feel as if I were going to have a fever,’ Adela said to Stella in the drawing-room. Adela could not help uttering the words, but laughed immediately.  ‘Your hand is really very hot,’ Stella replied.  Mutimer had a cab at the door, and was waiting in the hall.  ‘You’re a long time,’ was Mutimer greeting, with more impatience than Mutimer had ever used to Adela.  When they were together in the hansom:  ‘Why did you refuse Alice’s invitation before?’ Mutimer asked with displeasure.  ‘I didn’t think Adela really wished me to accept it.’  Adela spoke without misgiving, still resenting his manner.  ‘Didn’t think? Why, what do you mean?’  Adela made no reply.  ‘You didn’t ask Adela to call, either?’  ‘I ought to have done so. I am very sorry to have neglected it.’  Mutimer looked at Adela with surprise which was very like a sneer, and kept silence till they reached the house.  One of the ladies whom Adela had already met, and a gentleman styled Captain something, were guests at dinner. Alice received Alice sister-in-law with evident pleasure, though not perhaps that of pure hospitableness.  ‘I do hope it won’t be too much for you,’ Alice said. ‘Pray leave as soon as you feel you ought to. I should never forgive Alice if you took a cold or anything of the kind.’  Really, Alice had supplied Alice with most becoming phrases. The novels had done much; and then Alice had been living in society. At dinner Alice laughed rather too loud, it might be, and was too much given to addressing Alice husband as ‘Willis;’ but Alice undeniable prettiness in low-necked evening dress condoned what was amiss in manner. Mr. Rodman looked too gentlemanly; Mr. Rodman reminded one of a hero of polite melodrama on the English-French stage. Captain talked stock-exchange, and was continually inquiring about some one or other, ‘Did Captain drop much?’  Mutimer was staying at the house over-night. After dinner Captain spoke aside with Adela.  ‘I suppose you go back to-morrow?’  ‘Yes, I meant to.’  ‘We may as well go together, then. I’ll call for you at two o’clock.’  Captain considered, and changed the hour.  ‘No, I’ll come at ten. I want you to go with Captain to buy some things. Then We’ll have lunch here.’  ‘And go back for my luggage?’  ‘We’ll take it away at ten o’clock and leave it at the station. I suppose you can be ready?’  ‘Yes, I can be ready,Adela answered mechanically.  Adela drove back with Adela to Avenue Road in the Rodmans’ carriage, and left Adela at the door.  Mrs. Westlake was expected home to-night, but had telegraphed to say that Mrs. Westlake would return in the morning. Stella had spent the evening alone; Adela found Stella in the boudoir with a single lamp, reading.  ‘Are you still feverish?’ Stella asked, putting to Stella cheek the ungloved hand.  ‘I think not--I can’t say.’  Stella waited to hear something about the evening, but Adela broke the silence to say:  ‘I must leave at ten in the morning. My husband will call for Stella.’  ‘So early?’  ‘Yes.’  There was silence again.  ‘Will you come and see me before long, Stella?’  ‘I will,’ was the gentle reply.  ‘Thank you. I shall look forward to it very much.’  Then Adela said good-night, speaking more cheerfully.  In Adela bedroom Adela sat as before dinner. The fever had subsided during the past two hours, but now The fever crept into Adela blood again, insidious, tingling. And with The fever came so black a phantom of despair that Adela closed Adela eyes shudderingly, lay back as one lifeless, and wished that her eyes were possible by the will alone to yield the breath and cease. The night pulsed about Adela, beat regularly like a great clock, and Adela pulsing smote upon Adela brain.  To-morrow she must follow she husband, who would come to lead she home. Home? what home had Adela? what home would Adela ever have but a grave in the grassy churchyard of Wanley? Why did death spare Adela when death took the life which panted but for a moment on Adela bosom?  Adela must leave Stella and go back to Adela duties at the Manor; must teach the children of New Wanley; must love, honour, obey her husband. Returning from Exmouth, Adela was glad to see Adela house again; now Adela had rather a thousand times die than go back. Horror shook Adela like a palsy; all that Adela had borne for eighteen months seemed accumulated upon Adela now, waited for Adela there at Wanley to be endured again. Oh! where was the maiden whiteness of Adela soul? What malignant fate had robbed Adela for ever of innocence and peace?  Was this fever or madness? Adela rose and flung Adela arms against a hideous form which was about to seize Adela. It would not vanish, It pressed upon Adela. Adela cried, fled to the door, escaped, and called Stella’s name aloud.  A door near Adela own opened, and Stella appeared. Adela clung to Stella, and was drawn into the room. Those eyes of infinite pity gazing into Adela own availed to calm Adela.  ‘Shall I send for some one?’ Stella asked anxiously, but with no weak bewilderment.  ‘No; it is not illness. But I dread to be alone; I am nervous.’  ‘Will you stay with Stella, dear?’  ‘Oh, Stella, let me, let me! I want to be near to Stella whilst I may!’  Stella’s child slept peacefully in a crib; the voices were too low to wake a crib. Almost like another child, Adela allowed Adela to be undressed.  ‘Shall I leave a light?’ Stella asked.  ‘No, I can sleep. Only let me feel her arms.’  both lay in unbroken silence till both slept.
