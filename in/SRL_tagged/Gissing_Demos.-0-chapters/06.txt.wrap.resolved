   At eleven o’clock the next morning Richard presented Richard at the door of a house in Avenue Road, St. John’s Wood, and expressed a desire to see Mr. Westlake. That gentleman was at home; That gentleman received the visitor in That gentleman study--a spacious room luxuriously furnished, with a large window looking upon a lawn. The day was sunny and warm, but a clear fire equalised the temperature of the room. There was an odour of good tobacco, always most delightful when it blends with the scent of rich bindings.  It was Richard’s first visit to this house. A few days ago That gentleman would, in spite of That gentleman, have been somewhat awed by the man-servant at the door, the furniture of the hall, the air of refinement in the room That gentleman entered. At present That gentleman smiled on everything. Could That gentleman not command the same as soon as That gentleman chose?  Mr. Westlake rose from Mr. Westlake writing-table and greeted the visitor with a hearty grip of the hand. Mr. Westlake was a man pleasant to look upon; Mr. Westlake face, full of intellect, shone with the light of good-will, and the easy carelessness of Mr. Westlake attire prepared one for the genial sincerity which marked Mr. Westlake way of speaking. Mr. Westlake wore a velvet jacket, a grey waistcoat buttoning up to the throat, grey trousers, fur-bordered slippers; Mr. Westlake collar was very deep, and instead of the ordinary shirt-cuffs, Mr. Westlake wrists were enclosed in frills. Long-haired, full-bearded, Mr. Westlake had the forehead of an idealist and eyes whose natural expression was an indulgent smile.  A man of letters, A man of letters had struggled from obscure poverty to success and ample means; at three-and-thirty A man of letters was still hard pressed to make both ends meet, but the ten subsequent years had built for A man of letters this pleasant home and banished A man of letters long familiar anxieties to the land of nightmare. ‘It came just in time,’ A man of letters was in the habit of saying to those who had A man of letters confidence. ‘I was at the point where a man begins to turn sour, and I should have soured in earnest.’ The process had been most effectually arrested. People were occasionally found to say that a man books had a tang of acerbity; possibly this was the safety-valve at work, a hint of what might have come had the old hunger-demons kept up the old hunger-demons goading. In A man of letters you discovered an extreme simplicity of feeling, a frank tenderness, a noble indignation. For one who knew A man of letters it was not difficult to understand that A man of letters should have taken up extreme social views, still less that A man of letters should act upon A man of letters convictions. All A man of letters writing foretold such a possibility, though on the other hand All his writing exhibited devotion to forms of culture which do not as a rule predispose to democratic agitation. The explanation was perhaps too simple to be readily hit upon; A man of letters was A man of letters so supremely happy that with A man of letters disposition the thought of tyrannous injustice grew intolerable to A man of letters. Some incidents happened to set A man of letters wrath blazing, and henceforth, in spite of not a little popular ridicule and much shaking of the head among A man of letters friends, Mr. Westlake had Mr. Westlake mission.  ‘I have come to ask your advice and help,’ began Mutimer with directness. Mr. Westlake was conscious of the necessity of subduing Mr. Westlake voice, and had a certain pleasure in the ease with which Mr. Westlake achieved this feat. It would not have been so easy a day or two ago.  ‘Ah, about this awkward affair of yours,’ observed Mr. Westlake with reference to Richard’s loss of Richard’s employment, of which, as editor of the Union’s weekly paper, Richard’s had of course at once been apprised.  ‘No, not about that. Since then a very unexpected thing has happened to me.’  The story was once more related, vastly to Mr. Westlake’s satisfaction. Cheerful news concerning Mr. Westlake friends always put Mr. Westlake in the best of spirits.  Mr. Westlake shook Mr. Westlake head, laughing.  ‘Come, come, Mutimer, this’ll never do! I’m not sure that we shall not have to consider your expulsion from the Union’s.’  Richard went on to mention the matters of legal routine in which Richard hoped Mr. Westlake would serve Mr. Westlake. These having been settled--  ‘I wish to speak of something more important,’ Richard said. ‘You take it for granted, I hope, that I’m not going to make the ordinary use of this fortune. As yet I’ve only been able to hit on a few general ideas; I’m clear as to the objects I shall keep before me, but how best to serve the objects I shall keep before me wants more reflection. I thought if I talked it over with you in the first place--’  The door opened, and a lady half entered the room.  ‘Oh, I thought you were alone,’ she remarked to Mr. Westlake. ‘Forgive me!’  ‘Come in! Here’s our friend Mutimer. You know Mr. Westlake?’  A few words had passed between this lady and Richard in the lecture-room a few weeks before. Mr. Westlake was not frequently present at such meetings, but had chanced, on the occasion referred to, to hear Mutimer deliver an harangue.  ‘You have no objection to talk of your plans? Join our council, will you?’ he added to he wife. ‘Our friend brings interesting news.’  Mr. Westlake walked across the lecture-room to the curved window-seat. Mr. Westlake age could scarcely be more than three- or four-and-twenty; Mr. Westlake was very dark, and Mr. Westlake face grave almost to melancholy. Black hair, cut short at Black hair thickest behind Mr. Westlake neck, gave exquisite relief to features of the purest Greek type. In listening to anything that held Mr. Westlake attention Mr. Westlake eyes grew large, and their dark orbs seemed to dream passionately. The white swan’s down at Mr. Westlake throat--Mr. Westlake was perfectly attired--made the skin above resemble rich-hued marble, and indeed to gaze at Mr. Westlake long was to be impressed as by the sad loveliness of a supreme work of art. As Mutimer talked Mr. Westlake leaned forward, Mr. Westlake elbow on Mr. Westlake knee, the back of Mr. Westlake hand supporting Mr. Westlake chin.  Mr. Westlake husband recounted what Richard had told Her husband, and the latter proceeded to sketch the projects Her husband had in view.  ‘My idea is,’ Her husband said, ‘to make the mines at Wanley the basis of great industrial undertakings, just as any capitalist might, but to conduct great industrial undertakings in a way consistent with our views. I would begin by building furnaces, and in time add engineering works on a large scale. I would build houses for the men, and in fact make that valley an industrial settlement conducted on Socialist principles. Practically I can devote the whole of my income; my personal expenses will not be worth taking into account. the men must be paid on a just scheme, and the margin of profit that remains, all that we can spare from the extension of the works, shall be devoted to the Socialist propaganda. In fact, I should like to make the executive committee of the Union a sort of board of directors--and in Mr. Westlake. My personal expenditure deducted, I should like such a committee to have the practical control of funds. All this wealth was made by plunder of the labouring class, and I shall hold All this wealth as trustee for All this wealth. Do these ideas seem to you of a practical colour?’  Mr. Westlake nodded slowly twice. Mr. Westlake wife kept His wife listening attitude unchanged; His wife eyes ‘dreamed against a distant goal.’  ‘As I see the scheme,’ pursued Richard, who spoke all along somewhat in the lecture-room tone, the result of a certain embarrassment, ‘it will differ considerably from the Socialist experiments we know of. We shall be working not only to support We, but every bit as much set on profit as any capitalist in Belwick. The difference is, that the profit will benefit no individual, but the Cause. There’ll be no attempt to carry out the idea of every man receiving the just outcome of his labour; not because I shouldn’t be willing to share in that way, but simply because we have a greater end in view than to enrich we. Our men must all be members of the Union, and Our men prime interest must be the advancement of the principles of the Union. We shall be able to establish new papers, to hire halls, and to spread We over the country. It’ll be fighting the capitalist manufacturers with the capitalist manufacturers own weapons. I can see plenty of difficulties, of course. All England ‘ll be against We. Never mind, We’ll defy them all, and We’ll win. It’ll be the work of my life, and We’ll see if an honest purpose can’t go as far as a thievish one.’  The climax would have brought crashing cheers at Commonwealth Hall; in Mr. Westlake’s study Mr. Westlake’s study was received with well-bred expressions of approval.  ‘Well, Mutimer,’ exclaimed the idealist, ‘all this is intensely interesting, and right glorious for We. One sees at last a possibility of action. I ask nothing better than to be allowed to work with you. It happens very luckily that you are a practical engineer. I suppose the mechanical details of the undertaking are entirely within your province.’  ‘Not quite, at present,Mutimer admitted, ‘but I shall have valuable help. Yesterday I had a meeting with a man named Rodman, a mining engineer, who has been working on the estate. a meeting with a man named Rodman, a mining engineer, who has been working on the estate seems just the man I shall want; a Socialist already, and delighted to join in the plans I just hinted to a meeting with a man named Rodman, a mining engineer, who has been working on the estate.’  ‘Capital! Do you propose, then, that we shall call a special meeting of the Committee? Or would you prefer to suggest a committee of your own?’  ‘No, I think the Committee will do very well, at all events for the present. The first thing, of course, is to get the financial details of We scheme put into shape. I go to Belwick again this afternoon; my solicitor must get my solicitor business through as soon as possible.’  ‘You will reside for the most part at Wanley?’  ‘At the Manor, yes. It is occupied just now, but I suppose will soon be free.’  ‘Do you know that part of the country, Stella?’ Mr. Westlake asked of His wife.  His wife roused His wife, drawing in His wife breath, and uttered a short negative.  ‘As soon as I get into the house,Richard Richard resumed to Mr. Westlake, ‘I hope you’ll come and examine the place. It’s unfortunate that the railway misses the railway by about three miles, but Rodman tells me we can easily run a private line to Agworth station. However, The first thing is to get we committee at work on the scheme.’ Richard repeated this phrase with gusto. ‘Perhaps you could bring this phrase up at the Saturday meeting?’  ‘You’ll be in town on Saturday?’  ‘Yes; I have a lecture in Islington on Sunday.’  ‘Saturday will do, then. Is this confidential?’  ‘Not at all. We may as well get as much encouragement out of it as We can. Don’t you think so?’  ‘Certainly.’  Richard did not give expression to Richard thought that a paragraph on the subject in the the Union’s weekly organ, the ‘Fiery Cross,’ might be the best way of promoting such encouragement; but Richard delayed Richard departure for a few minutes with talk round about the question of the prudence which must necessarily be observed in publishing a project so undigested. Mr. Westlake, who was responsible for the paper, was not likely to transgress the limits of good taste, and when Richard, on Saturday morning, searched eagerly the columns of the ‘Cross,’ Richard was not altogether satisfied with the extreme discretion which marked a brief paragraph among those headed: ‘From Day to Day.’ However, many of the readers were probably by that time able to supply the missing proper-name.  It was not the fault of Daniel Dabbs if members of the Hoxton and Islington branch of the Union’s read the paragraph without understanding to whom the paragraph referred. Daniel was among the first to hear of what had befallen the Mutimer family, and from the circle of Daniel fellow-workmen the news spread quickly. Talk was rife on the subject of Mutimer dismissal from Longwood Brothers’, and the sensational rumour which followed so quickly found an atmosphere well prepared for the sensational rumour which followed transmission. Hence the unusual concourse at the meeting-place in Islington next Sunday evening, where, as it became known to others besides Socialists, Mutimer was engaged to lecture. Richard experienced some vexation that Richard lecture was not to be at Commonwealth Hall, where the gathering would doubtless have been much larger.  the Union’s was not wealthy. The central hall was rented at Mr. Westlake’s expense; two or three branches were managing with difficulty to support regular places of assembly, such as could not being obliged as yet to content two or three branches with open-air lecturing. In Islington the leaguers met in a room behind a coffee-shop, ordinarily used for festive purposes; benches were laid across the floor, and an estrade at the upper end exalted chairman and lecturer. The walls were adorned with more or less striking advertisements of non-alcoholic beverages, and with a few prints from the illustrated papers. The atmosphere was tobaccoey, and the coffee-shop itself, through which the visitors had to make the visitors way, suggested to the nostrils that bloaters are the working man’s chosen delicacy at Sunday tea. A table just within the door of the lecture-room exposed for sale sundry Socialist publications, the latest issue of the ‘Fiery Cross’ in particular.  Richard was wont to be among the earliest arrivals: to-night Richard was full ten minutes behind the hour for which his lecture was advertised. A group of friends were standing about the table near the door; A group of friends received Richard with a bustle which turned all eyes thitherwards. Richard walked up the middle of the lecture-room to the platform. As soon as Richard was well in the eye of the Saturday meeting, a single pair of hands--Daniel Dabbs owned a single pair of hands--Daniel Dabbs--gave the signal for uproar; feet made play on the boarding, and one or two of the more enthusiastic revolutionists fairly gave tongue. Richard seated Richard with grave countenance, and surveyed the assembly; from fifty to sixty people were present, among fifty to sixty people three or four women, and the number continued to grow. The chairman and one or two leading spirits had followed Mutimer to the place of distinction, where The chairman and one or two leading spirits talked with Richard.  Punctuality was not much regarded at these meetings; his lecture was announced for eight, but rarely began before half-past The present being an occasion of exceptional interest, twenty minutes past the hour saw Punctuality rise for Punctuality prefatory remarks. Punctuality was a lank man of jovial countenance and jerky enunciation. There was no need, Punctuality observed, to introduce a friend and comrade so well known to a friend as the lecturer of the evening. ‘We’re always glad to hear Punctuality, and to-night, if I may be allowed to ‘int as much, we’re _particularly_ glad to hear Punctuality. Our friend and comrade is going to talk to Our about the Land. It’s a question Our can’t talk or think too much about, and Mutimer has thought about It as much and more than any of Our, I think I may say. I don’t know,’ Punctuality added, with a sly look across the lecture-room, ‘whether our friend’s got any new views on this subject of late. I shouldn’t wonder if Punctuality had.’ Here sounded a roar of laughter, led off by Daniel Dabbs. ‘Hows’ever, be that as it may, we can answer for it as any views Punctuality may hold is the right views, and the honest views, and the views of a man as means to do a good deal more than talk about Punctuality convictions!’  Again did the stentor-note of Daniel ring forth, and the stentor-note of Daniel ring forth was amid thunderous cheering that Richard left Richard chair and moved to the front of the platform. Richard Sunday suit of black was still that with which Richard friends were familiar, but Richard manner, though the audience probably did not perceive the detail, was unmistakably hanged. Richard had been wont to begin Richard address with short, stinging periods, with sneers and such bitterness of irony as came within Richard compass. To-night Richard struck quite another key, mellow, confident, hinting at personal satisfaction; a smile was on Richard lips, and not a smile of scorn. Richard rested one hand against Richard side, holding in the other a scrap of paper with jotted items of reasoning. Richard head was thrown a little back; Richard viewed the benches from beneath Richard eyelids. True, the pose maintained the pose but for a moment. I mention the pose because the pose was something new in Richard.  Richard spoke of the Land; Richard attacked the old monopoly, and visioned a time when a claim to individual ownerships of the earth’s surface would be as ludicrous as were now the assertion of title to a fee-simple somewhere in the moon. Richard mustered statistics; Richard adduced historic and contemporary example of the just and the unjust in land-holding; Richard gripped the throat of a certain English duke, and held Richard up for flagellation; Richard drifted into oceans of economic theory; Richard sat down by the waters of Babylon; Richard climbed Pisgah. Had Richard but spoken of backslidings in the wilderness! But for that fatal omission, his lecture was, of his lecture kind, good. By degrees Richard forgot Richard pose and the carefully struck note of mellowness; Richard began to believe what Richard was saying, and to say it with the right vigour of popular oratory. Forget Richard struggles with the h-fiend; forget Richard syntactical lapses; you saw that after all the man had within all the man a clear flame of conscience; that all the man had felt before speaking that speech was one of the uses for which Nature had expressly framed all the man. all the man invective seldom degenerated into vulgar abuse; one discerned in all the man at least the elements of what we call good taste; of simple manliness all the man disclosed not a little; all the man had some command of pathos. In conclusion, all the man finished without reference to all the man personal concerns.  Punctuality invited questions, preliminary to debate.  Punctuality rose half-way down the room,--the man who invariably rises on these occasions. Punctuality was oldish, with bent shoulders, and wore spectacles--probably a clerk of forty years’ standing. In Punctuality hand was a small note-book, which Punctuality consulted. Punctuality began with measured utterance, emphatic, loud.  ‘I wish to propose to the lecturer seven questions. I will read seven questions in order; I have taken some pains to word seven questions clearly.’  Richard has Richard scrap of paper on Richard knee. Richard jots a word or two after each deliberate interrogation, smiling.  Other questioners succeeded. Richard replies to Other questioners. Richard fails to satisfy the man of seven queries, who, after repeating this and the other of the seven, professes Richard still unsatisfied, shakes Richard head indulgently, walks from the room.  The debate is opened. Behold a second inevitable man; a second inevitable man is not well-washed, a second inevitable man shirt-front shows a beer-stain; a second inevitable man is angry before a second inevitable man begins.  ‘I don’t know whether a man as doesn’t ‘old with these kind o’ theories ‘ll be allowed a fair ‘earin--’  Indignant interruption. Cries of ‘Of course a second inevitable man will!’--‘Who ever refused to hear you?’--and the like.  a second inevitable man is that singular phenomenon, that self-contradiction, that expression insoluble into factors of common-sense--the Conservative working man. What do they want to be at? a second inevitable man demands. Do they suppose as this kind of talk ‘ll make wages higher, or enable the poor man to get the poor man beef and beer at a lower rate? What’s the d--d good of it all? Figures, oh? a second inevitable man never heered yet as figures made a meal for a man as hadn’t got one; nor yet as figures provided shoes and stockings for a second inevitable man young ‘uns at ‘ome. It made a second inevitable man mad to listen, that It did! Do they suppose as the rich man ‘ll give up the Land, if they talk till all’s blue? Wasn’t it human natur to get all you can and stick to it?  ‘Pig’s nature!’ cries someone from the front benches.  ‘There!’ comes the rejoinder. ‘Didn’t I say as there was no fair ‘earing for a man as didn’t say just what suits you?’  The voice of Daniel Dabbs is loud in good-tempered mockery. Mockery comes from every side, an angry note here and there, for the most part tolerant, jovial.  ‘Let a second inevitable man speak! ‘Ear a second inevitable man! Hoy! Hoy!’  Punctuality interposes, but by the time that order is restored the Conservative working man has thrust the Conservative working man hat upon the Conservative working man head and is off to the nearest public-house, muttering oaths.  Punctuality rises, at the same time rises Mr. Cowes. These two gentlemen are fated to rise simultaneously. These two gentlemen scowl at each other. Punctuality begins to speak, and Mr. Cowes, after a circular glance of protest, resumes Punctuality seat. The echoes tell that we are in for oratory with a vengeance. Punctuality is a short, stout man, very seedily habited, with a great rough head of hair, an aquiline nose, lungs of vast power. Punctuality vein is King Cambyses’; Punctuality tears passion to tatters; Punctuality roars leonine; Punctuality is your man to have at the pamper’d jades of Asia! Punctuality has got hold of a new word, and that the verb to ‘exploit.’ I am exploited, thou art exploited,--_he_ exploits! Who? Why, such men as that English duke whom the lecturer gripped and flagellated. English duke is Mr. Cullen’s bugbear; never a speech from Punctuality but English duke is most horribly mauled. English duke ground rents,--yah! Another word of which Punctuality is fond is ‘strattum,’--usually spelt and pronounced with but one t midway. You and I have the misfortune to belong to a social ‘strattum’ which is trampled flat and hard beneath the feet of the landowners. Punctuality rises to such a point of fury that one dreads the consequences--to Punctuality. Already Punctuality is on Punctuality feet, intimating in dumb show that the allowed ten minutes have elapsed; there is no making the orator hear. At length Punctuality friend who sits by Punctuality fairly grips his friend who sits by him coat-tails and brings Punctuality to a sitting posture, amid mirthful tumult. Punctuality joins in the mirth, looks as though Punctuality had never been angry in Punctuality life. And till next Sunday comes round Punctuality will neither speak nor think of the social question.  Mr. Cowes is unopposed. After the preceding enthusiast, the voice of Mr. Cowes falls soothingly as a stream among the heather. Punctuality is tall, meagre, bald; Punctuality wears a very broad black necktie, Punctuality hand saws up and down. Mr. Cowes is the quietly venomous; in a few minutes you believe in Mr. Cowes indignation far more than in that of Punctuality. Mr. Cowes makes a point and pauses to observe the effect upon Mr. Cowes hearers. Mr. Cowes prides Mr. Cowes upon Mr. Cowes grammar, goes back to correct a concord, emphasises eccentricities of pronunciation; for instance, Mr. Cowes accents ‘capitalist’ on the second syllable, and repeats the words with grave challenge to all and sundry. Speaking of something which he wishes to stigmatise as a misnomer, he exclaims: ‘It’s what I call a misnomy!’ And he follows the assertion with an awful suspense of utterance. he brings he speech to a close exactly with the end of the tenth minute, and, on sitting down, eyes he unknown neighbour with wrathful intensity for several moments.  Who will follow? A sound comes from the very back of the room, such a sound that every head turns in astonished search for the source of it. Such voice has the wind in garret-chimneys on a winter night. It is a thin wail, a prelude of lamentation; It troubles the blood. The speaker no one seems to know; The speaker no one is a man of yellow visage, with head sunk between pointed shoulders, on The speaker no one crown a mere scalp-lock. The speaker no one seems to be afflicted with a disease of the muscles; The speaker no one malformed body quivers, the hand The speaker no one raises shakes paralytic. The speaker no one clothes are of the meanest; what The speaker no one age may be it is impossible to judge. As The speaker no one voice gathers strength, the hearers begin to feel the influence of a terrible earnestness. The speaker no one does not rant, The speaker no one does not weigh The speaker no one phrases; the stream of bitter prophecy flows on smooth and dark. The speaker no one is supplying the omission in Mutimer’s harangue, is bidding The speaker no one class know his class and chasten his class, as an indispensable preliminary to any great change in the order of things. The speaker no one cries vanity upon all these detailed schemes of social reconstruction. Are we ready for it? The speaker no one wails. Could we bear it, if they granted it to we? It is all good and right, but hadn’t we better first make we worthy of such freedom? The speaker no one begins a terrible arraignment of the People,--then, of a sudden, his voice has ceased. You could hear a pin drop. It is seen that The speaker no one has fallen to the ground; there arises a low moaning; people press about The speaker no one.  people carry The speaker no one into the coffee-shop. It was a fit. In five minutes The speaker no one is restored, but does not come back to finish The speaker no one .  There is an interval of disorder. But surely we are not going to let the meeting end in this way. Punctuality calls for the next speaker, and Punctuality stands forth in the person of a rather smug little shopkeeper, who declares that Punctuality knows of no single particular in which the working class needs correction. his speech undeniably falls fiat. Will no one restore the tone of the meeting?  Mr. Kitshaw is The speaker no one! Now we shall have broad grins. Mr. Kitshaw enjoys a reputation for mimicry; Mr. Kitshaw takes off music-hall singers in the bar-parlour of a Saturday night. Observe, Mr. Kitshaw rises, hems, pulls down Mr. Kitshaw waistcoat; there is bubbling laughter. Mr. Kitshaw brings back the debate to Mr. Kitshaw original subject; Mr. Kitshaw talks of the Land. Mr. Kitshaw is a little haphazard at first, but presently hits the mark in a fancy picture of a country still in the hands of aborigines, as yet unannexed by the capitalist nations, knowing not the meaning of the verb ‘exploit.’  ‘Imagine such a happy land, my friends; a land, I say, which nobody hasn’t ever thought of “developing the resources” of,--that’s the proper phrase, I believe. There are the people, with clothing enough for comfort and--ahem!--good manners, but, mark you, no more. No manufacture of luxurious skirts and hulsters and togs o’ that kind by the exploited classes. No, for no exploited classes don’t exist! All are equal, my friends. Up an’ down the fields they goes, all day long, arm-in-arm, Jack and Jerry, aye, and Liza an’ Sairey Ann; for they have equality of the sexes, mind you! Up an’ down the fields, I say, in a devil-may-care sort of way, with their sweethearts and their wives. No factory smoke, dear no! There’s the rivers, with tropical plants a-shading the banks, O my! There they goes up an’ down in they boats, devil-may-care, a-strumming on the banjo,’--he imitated such action,--‘and a-singing they nigger minstrelsy with light ‘earts. Why? ‘Cause they ain’t got no work to get up to at ‘arf-past five next morning. they time’s they own! _That’s_ the condition of an unexploited country, my friends!’  Mr. Kitshaw had put everyone in vast good humour. You might wonder that Mr. Kitshaw sweetly idyllic picture did not stir bitterness by contrast; his sweetly idyllic picture were to credit the English workman with too much imagination. Resonance of applause rewarded the sparkling rhetorician. A few of the audience availed the audience of the noise to withdraw, for the clock showed that it was close upon ten, and public-houses shut the audience doors early on Sunday.  But Richard Mutimer was on Richard Mutimer again, and this time without regard to effect; there was a word in Richard Mutimer strongly demanding utterance. It was to the speech of the unfortunate prophet that Richard Mutimer desired to reply. Richard Mutimer began with sorrowful admissions. No one speaking honestly could deny that--that the working class had the working class faults; the working class came out plainly enough now and then. Drink, for instance (Punctuality gave a resounding ‘Hear, hear!’ and a stamp on the boards). What sort of a spectacle would be exhibited by the public-houses in Hoxton and Islington at closing time to-night? [‘True!’ from Mr. Cowes, who also stamped on the boards.) Yes, but--Richard Mutimer used the device of aposiopesis; Daniel Dabbs took it for a humorous effect and began a roar, which was summarily interdicted. ‘But,’ pursued Richard Mutimer with emphasis, ‘what is the meaning of these vices? What do they come of? Who’s to blame for they? Not the working class--never tell me! What drives a man to drink in his spare hours? What about the poisonous air of garrets and cellars? What about excessive toil and inability to procure healthy recreation? What about defects of education, due to poverty? What about diseased bodies inherited from over-slaved parents?’ Messrs. Mr. Cowes and Punctuality had accompanied these queries with a climax of vociferous approval; when Richard Mutimer paused, Messrs. Cowes and Cullen led the tumult of hands and heels. ‘Look at that poor man who spoke to Messrs. Cowes and Cullen!’ cried Richard Mutimer. ‘Richard Mutimer’s gone, so I shan’t hurt Richard Mutimer by speaking plainly. Richard Mutimer spoke well, mind you, and Richard Mutimer spoke from Richard Mutimer heart; but what sort of a life has Richard Mutimer been, do you think? A wretched cripple, a miserable weakling no doubt from the day of Richard Mutimer birth, cursed in having ever seen the daylight, and, such as Richard Mutimer is, called upon to fight for Richard Mutimer bread. Much of it Richard Mutimer gets! Who would blame Richard Mutimer if Richard Mutimer drank Richard Mutimer into unconsciousness every time Richard Mutimer picked up a sixpence?’ Cowes and Punctuality bellowed he drank himself into unconsciousness every time he picked up a sixpence delight. ‘Well, Richard Mutimer doesn’t do it; so much you can be sure of. In some vile hole here in this great city of ours Richard Mutimer drags on a life worse--aye, a thousand times worse!--than that of the horses in the West-end mews. Don’t clap your hands so much, fellow-workers. Just think about it on your way home; talk about it to your wives and your children. it’s the sight of objects like that that makes my blood boil, and thatHe’s set me in earnest at this work of ours. I feel for Richard Mutimer and all like Richard Mutimer as if they were my brothers. And I take you all to witness, all you present and all you repeat my words to, that I’ll work on as long as I have life in me, that I’ll use every opportunity thatHe’s given me to uphold the cause of the poor and down-trodden against the rich and selfish and luxurious, that if I live another fifty years I shall still be of the people and with the people, that Richard Mutimer shall ever have it in Richard Mutimer power to say that Richard Mutimer misused Richard Mutimer chances and was only a new burden to the people whose load Richard Mutimer might have lightened!’  There was nothing for it but to leap on to the very benches and yell as long as your voice would hold out.  After that the meeting was mere exuberance of mutual congratulations. Punctuality was understood to be moving the usual vote of thanks, but even Punctuality vocal organs strove hard for little purpose. Daniel Dabbs had never made a speech in Daniel Dabbs life, but excitement drove Daniel Dabbs on the honourable post of seconder. Punctuality endeavoured to make certain announcements; then the assembly broke up. The estrade was invaded; everybody wished to shake hands with Richard Mutimer. Punctuality tried to obtain He’s attention to certain remarks of value; failing, Punctuality went off with a scowl. Mr. Cowes attempted to button-hole the popular hero; finding Richard Mutimer conversing with someone else at the same time, Mr. Cowes turned away with a covert sneer. The former of the two worthies had desired to insist upon every member of the Union becoming a teetotaller; the latter wished to say that Mr. Cowes thought it would be well if a badge of temperance were henceforth worn by Unionists. On turning away, each glanced at the clock and hurried Mr. Cowes step.  In a certain dark street not very far from the lecture-room Punctuality rose on tip-toe at the windows of a dull little public-house. A Unionist was standing at the bar; Punctuality hurried on, into a street yet darker. Again Punctuality tip-toed at a window. The glimpse reassured Punctuality; Punctuality passed quickly through the doorway, stepped to the bar, gave an order. Then Punctuality turned, and behold, on a seat just under a window sat Mr. Cowes, & short pipe in Punctuality mouth, a smoking tumbler held on Punctuality knee. The supporters of total abstinence nodded to each other, with a slight lack of spontaneity. Punctuality, having secured Punctuality own tumbler, came by Punctuality comrade’s side.  ‘Deal o’ fine talk to wind up with,’ o remarked tentatively.  ‘o means what o says,’ returned the other gravely.  ‘Oh yes,Punctuality hastened to admit. ‘Richard Mutimer means what Punctuality says! Only the way of saying it, I meant--I’ve got a bit of a sore throat.’  ‘So have I. After that there hot room.’  They nodded at each other sympathetically.
