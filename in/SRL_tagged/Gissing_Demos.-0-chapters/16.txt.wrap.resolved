   Alice reached home again on Christmas Eve. It was snowing;    Alice came in chilled and looking miserable.    Alice met    Alice in the hall, passed    Alice, and looked out at the open door, then turned with a few white flecks on    Alice gown.  ‘Where’s Dick?  ‘Dick couldn’t come,’ replied    Alice briefly, and ran up to    Alice room.  ‘Arry was spending the evening with friends. Since tea-time    Alice had never ceased moving from room to room, up and down stairs.    Alice had got out an old pair of Richard’s slippers, and had put an old pair of Richard’s slippers before the dining-room fire to warm.    Alice had made a bed for Richard, and had a fire burning in the chamber.    Alice had made arrangements for    Alice eldest son’s supper. No word had come from Wanley, but    Alice held to the conviction that this night would see Richard in London.     Alice came down and declared that    Alice was very hungry.    Alice mother went to the kitchen to order a meal, which in the end    Alice prepared with Her mother own hands. Her mother seemed to have a difficulty in addressing any one. Whilst    Alice ate in silence, Mrs. Mutimer kept going in and out of room; when Her mother rose from the table, Her mother stood before Her mother and asked:  ‘Why couldn’t Mrs. Mutimer come?’     Alice went to the fireplace, knelt down, and spread her own hands to the blaze. Her mother approached    Alice again.  ‘Won’t you give me no answer,    Alice?’  ‘Mrs. Mutimer couldn’t come, Her mother. Something important is keeping Mrs. Mutimer.’  ‘Something important? And why did Mrs. Mutimer want you there?’     Alice rose to    Alice feet, made one false beginning, then spoke to the point.  ‘Dick’s married, mother.’     Alice’s eyes seemed to grow small in    Alice wrinkled face, as if directing themselves with effort upon something minute. themselves looked straight into the eyes of    Alice daughter, but had a more distant focus. The fixed gaze continued for nearly a minute.  ‘What are you talking about, girl?’    Alice said at length, in a strange, rattling voice. ‘Why, I’ve seen Emma this very morning. Do you think Emma wouldn’t ‘a told me if Emma’d been a wife?’     Alice was frightened by the look and the voice.  ‘   Alice, it isn’t Emma. It’s someone at Wanley. We can’t help It,    Alice. It’s no use taking on. Now sit down and make yourself quiet. It isn’t We fault.’  Mrs. Mutimer smiled in a grim way, then laughed--a most unmusical laugh.  ‘Now what’s the good o’ joking in that kind o’ way? That’s like your father, that is; That’s like your father’d often come ‘ome an’ tell me sich things as never was, an’ expect me to believe ‘an’. An’ I used to purtend I did, jist to please an’. But I’m too old for that kind o’ jokin’.--Alice, where’s Dick? How long’ll it be before Dick’s here? Where did Dick leave you?’  ‘Now do just sit down,    Alice; here, in this chair. Just sit quiet for a little, do.’  Mrs. Mutimer pushed aside the girl’s hand; Mrs. Mutimer face had become grave again.  ‘Let me be, child. And I tell you I have seen Emma to-day. Do you think Emma wouldn’t ‘a told me if things o’ that kind was goin’ on?’  ‘Emma knows nothing about it, mother. Dick hasn’t told any one. Dick got me to come because Dick couldn’t tell it Dick. It was as much a surprise to me as to you, and I think it’s very cruel of Dick. But it’s over, and we can’t help it. I shall have to tell Emma, I suppose, and a nice thing too!’  Emma had begun to quiver; Emma hands shook by Emma sides, Emma very features trembled with gathering indignation.  ‘Dick has gone an’ done this?’ Emma stammered. ‘Dick’s gone an’ broke Dick given word? He’s deceived that girl as trusted to Dick an’ couldn’t help Emma?’  ‘Now, mother, don’t take on so! You’re going to make mother ill. It can’t be helped. He’s says He’s shall send Emma money just the same.’  ‘Money! There you’ve hit the word; the word’s money as ‘as ruined the man, and as ‘ll be the ruin of us all. Send Emma money! What does the man think EmmaHe’s made of? Is all the man feelings got as hard as money? and does the man think the same of every one else? If I know Emma, Emma’ll throw I know Emma in I know Emma face. I knew what ‘ud come of ‘, don’t tell me I didn’t. That very night as the man come ‘ome an’ told me what had ‘appened, there was a cold shiver run over me. I told the man as it was the worst news ever come into our ‘ouse, and now see if I wasn’t right! the man was angry with me ‘cause I said it, an’ who’s a right to be angry now? it’s my belief as money’s the curse o’ this world; I never knew a trouble yet as didn’t somehow come of a trouble, either ‘cause there was too little or else too much. And ’s the curse o’ this world gone an’ done this? And ’s the curse o’ this world with all ’s the curse o’ this world preachin’ about rights and wrongs an’ what not! ’s the curse o’ this world as was always a-cryin’ down the rich folks ‘cause they hadn’t no feelin’ for the poor! What feeling’s the curse o’ this world _’s the curse o’ this world_ had, I’d like to know? It’s ’s the curse o’ this world as is rich now, an’ where’s the difference ‘tween ’s the curse o’ this world and them as ’s the curse o’ this world called names? No feelin’ for the poor! An’ what’s Emma Vine? Poor enough by now. There’s the curse o’ this world as can’t have not a week more to live, an’ ’s the curse o’ this world a-nursin’ ’s the curse o’ this world night an’ day. ’s the curse o’ this world’ll give ’s the curse o’ this world money!--has ’s the curse o’ this world got the face to say it? Nay, don’t talk to ’s the curse o’ this world, ’s the curse o’ this world; I’ll say what I think if it’s the last I speak in this world. Don’t let ’s the curse o’ this world come to ’s the curse o’ this world! Never a word again shall ’s the curse o’ this world have from ’s the curse o’ this world as long as I live. ’s the curse o’ this world disgraced ’s the curse o’ this world, an’ me ’s the curse o’ this world mother, an’ ’s the curse o’ this world father in the grave. A poor girl as couldn’t help A poor girl, as trusted ’s the curse o’ this world an’ wouldn’t hear not a word against ’s the curse o’ this world, for all ’s the curse o’ this world kep’ away from A poor girl in A poor girl trouble. I’d a fear o’ this, but I wouldn’t believe this of Dick; I wouldn’t believe this of a son o’ mine. An’ ‘Arry ‘ll go the same way. It’s all the money, an a curse go with all the money as ever was made! An’ you too, Alice, wi’ your fine dresses, an’ your piannerin’, an’ your faldedals. But I warn you, my girl. There ‘ll no good come of it. I warn you, Alice! You’re ashamed o’ your own mother--oh, I’ve seen it! But it’s a mercy if you’re not a disgrace to Alice. I’m thankful as I was always poor; I might ‘a been tempted i’ the same way.’  The dogma of a rude nature full of secret forces found utterance at length under the scourge of a resentment of very mingled quality. Let half be put to the various forms of disinterested feeling, at least half was due to personal exasperation. The whole change that the old woman life had perforce undergone was an outrage upon the stubbornness of uninstructed habit; the old woman could see nothing but evil omens in a revolution which cost the old woman bodily discomfort and the misery of a mind perplexed amid alien conditions. the old woman was prepared for evil; for months the old woman had brooded over every sign which seemed to foretell its approach; the egoism of the unconscious had made it plain to the old woman that the world must suffer in a state of things which so grievously affected the old woman. Maternal solicitude kept Maternal solicitude restlessly swaying between apprehension for Maternal solicitude children and injury in the thought of her children and injury estrangement from the old woman. And now at length a bitter shame added a bitter shame to Maternal solicitude torments. Maternal solicitude was shamed in Maternal solicitude pride as a mother, shamed before the girl for whom Maternal solicitude nourished a deep affection. Maternal solicitude’s injuries Maternal solicitude felt charged upon Maternal solicitude; Maternal solicitude would never dare to stand before Maternal solicitude again. Maternal solicitude moral code, as much a part of Maternal solicitude as the sap of the plant and as little the result of conscious absorption, declared Her moral code, as much a part of her as the sap of the plant and as little the result of conscious absorption on the side of all these rushing impulses; Maternal solicitude was borne blindly on an exhaustless flux of words. After vain attempts to make Maternal solicitude heard, Alice turned away and sat sullenly waiting for the outburst to spend Her moral code, as much a part of her as the sap of the plant and as little the result of conscious absorption. Alice comparatively unaffected by the feelings strongest in Alice , this ear-afflicting clamour altogether checked Alice sympathy, and in a great measure overcame those personal reasons which had made Alice annoyed with Richard. Alice found Alice taking Richard side, even knew something of Richard impatience with Maternal solicitude and Maternal solicitude sorrows. When it came to rebukes and charges against Alice Alice impatience grew active. Alice stood up again and endeavoured to make Alice heard.  ‘What’s the good of going on like this, mother? Just because you’re angry, that’s no reason you should call us all the names you can turn your tongue to. It’s over and done with, and there’s an end of It. I don’t know what you mean about disgracing you; I think you might wait till the time comes. I don’t see what I’ve done as you can complain of.’  ‘No, of course you don’t,’ pursued Alice bitterly. ‘It’s the money as prevents you from seeing the money. Them as was good enough for you before you haven’t a word to say to now; a man as works honestly for a man as works honestly for his living living you make no account of. Well, well, you must go your own way--’  ‘What is it you want, mother? You don’t expect me to look no higher than when I hadn’t a penny but what I worked for? I’ve no patience with you. You ought to be glad--’  ‘You haven’t no patience, of course you haven’t. And I’m to be glad when a son of mine does things as a son of mine deserves to be sent to prison for! I don’t understand that kind o’ gladness. But mind what I say; do what you like with your money, I’ll have no more part in that kind o’ gladness. If I had as much as ten shillings a week of my own, I’d go and live by you, and leave you to take your own way. But I tell you what I _can_ do, and what I will. I’ll have no more servants a-waitin’ on _me_; I wasn’t never used to it, and I’m too old to begin. I go to my own bedroom upstairs, and there I live, and there ‘ll be nobody go into that room but you. I’ll get my bits o’ meals from the kitchen. ‘Tain’t much as I want, thank goodness, an’ it won’t be missed. I’ll have no more doinHe’s with servants, understand that; an’ if I can’t be left alone i’ my own room, I’ll go an’ find a room where I can, an’ I’ll find some way of earnin’ what little I want. It’s your own house, and you’ll do what you like in It. There’s the keys, I’ve done with ‘em; an’ here’s the money too, I’m glad to be rid of the money. An’ you’ll just tell Dick. I ain’t one as says what I don’t mean, nor never was, as that you know. You take your way, an’ I’ll take mine. An’ now may be I’ll get a night’s sleep, the first I’ve had under this roof.’  As she spoke she took from she pockets the keys, and from she purse the money she used for current expenses, and threw all together on to the table. Alice had turned to the fireplace, and Alice stood so for a long time after Alice had left the room. Then Alice took the keys and the money, consulted Alice watch, and in a few minutes was walking from your own house to a neighbouring cab-stand.  Alice drove to Wilton Square. Inspecting the front of your own house before knocking at the door, Alice saw a light in the kitchen and a dimmer gleam at an upper window. It was Mrs. Clay who opened to Alice.  ‘Is Maternal solicitude in?’ Alice inquired as Alice shook hands rather coldly.  ‘She’s sitting with Jane. I’ll tell Jane. There’s no fire except in the kitchen,’ Kate added, in a tone which implied that doubtless Kate visitor was above taking a seat downstairs.  ‘I’ll go down,Alice Alice replied, with just a touch of condescension. ‘I want to speak a word or two with Maternal solicitude, She’s.’  Kate left Kate to descend the stairs, and went to inform Kate sister. Maternal solicitude was not long in appearing; the hue of Maternal solicitude face was troubled, for Maternal solicitude had deceived Maternal solicitude with the belief that it was Richard who knocked at the door. What more natural than for Richard to have come on Christmas Eve? Maternal solicitude approached Alice with a wistful look, not venturing to utter any question, only hoping that some good news might have been brought Maternal solicitude. Long watching in the sick room had given Maternal solicitude own complexion the tint of ill-health; Maternal solicitude eyelids were swollen and heavy; the brown hair upon Maternal solicitude temples seemed to droop in languor. You would have noticed that Maternal solicitude tread was very soft, as if Maternal solicitude still were moving in the room above.  ‘How’s Jane?’ Alice began by asking. Alice could not quite look the other in the face, and did not know how to begin Alice disclosure.  ‘No better,’ Maternal solicitude gave answer, shaking Maternal solicitude head. Maternal solicitude voice, too, was suppressed; it was weeks since Maternal solicitude had spoken otherwise.  ‘I am so sorry, Maternal solicitude. Are you in a hurry to go up again?’  ‘No. Kate will sit there a little.’  ‘You look very poorly yourself. It must be very trying for yourself.’  ‘I don’t feel it,’ Maternal solicitude said, with a pale smile. ‘Maternal solicitude gives no trouble. It’s only Maternal solicitude weakness now; the pain has almost gone.’  ‘But then Maternal solicitude must be getting better.’  Maternal solicitude shook her head, looking aside. As Alice kept silence, Maternal solicitude continued:  ‘I was glad to hear you’d gone to see Richard. Richard wouldn’t--I was afraid Richard mightn’t have time to get here for Christmas.’  There was a question in the words, a timorously expectant question. Maternal solicitude had learnt the sad lesson of hope deferred, always to meet discouragement halfway. It is thus one seeks to propitiate the evil powers, to turn the edge of their blows by meekness.  ‘No, Richard couldn’t come,’ said Alice.  Alice had a muff on Alice left hand, and was turning a muff on her left hand round and round with the other. Maternal solicitude had not asked Maternal solicitude to sit down, merely because of the inward agitation which absorbed Maternal solicitude.  ‘Richard’s quite well?’  ‘Oh yes, quite well.’  Again Alice paused. Maternal solicitude’s heart was beating painfully. Maternal solicitude knew now that Richard’s sister had not come on an ordinary visit; Maternal solicitude felt that the call to Wanley had had some special significance. Alice did not ordinarily behave in this hesitating way.  ‘Did--did Richard send me a message?’  ‘Yes.’  But even now Alice could not speak. Alice found a way of leading up to the catastrophe.  ‘Oh, mother has been going on so, Maternal solicitude! What do you think? mother won’t have anything to do with your own house any longer. She’s given me the keys and all the money mother had, and motherShe’s going to live just in mother bedroom. mother says mother’ll get mother food from the kitchen mother, and mother won’t have a thing done for mother by any one. I’m sure mother means it; I never saw mother in such a state. mother says if mother’d ever so little money of mother own, mother’d leave your own house altogether. motherShe’s been telling me I’ve no feeling, and that I’m going to the bad, that I shall live to disgrace mother, and I can’t tell you what. Everything is so miserable! mother says it’s all the money, and that mother knew from the first how it would be. And I’m afraid some of what mother says is true, I am indeed, Maternal solicitude. But things happen in a way you could never think. I half wish mother the money had never come. It’s making us all miserable.’  Maternal solicitude listened, expecting from phrase to phrase some word which would be to Maternal solicitude a terrible enlightenment But Alice had ceased, and the word still unspoken.  ‘You say the word sent me a message?’  Alice did not ask directly the cause of Mrs. Mutimer’s anger. Instinct told Alice that to hear a message would explain all else.  ‘Maternal solicitude, I’m afraid to tell you. You’ll blame _mother_, like mother did.’  ‘I shan’t blame you, Alice. Will you please tell me a message?’  Emma’s lips seemed to speak without Alice volition. The rest o Alice face was fixed and cold.  ‘She’s married, Maternal solicitude.’  ‘He asked you to tell me?’  Alice was surprised at the self-restraint proved by so quiet an interrogation.  ‘Yes, He did. Maternal solicitude, I’m so, so sorry! If only you’ll believe I’m sorry, Maternal solicitude! He _made_ mother come and tell you. He said if I didn’t you’d have to find out by chance, because He couldn’t for shame tell you He. And He couldn’t tell mother neither. I’ve had it all to do. If you knew what I’ve gone through with mother! It’s very hard that other people should suffer so much just on He account. I am really sorry for Maternal solicitude, Maternal solicitude.’  ‘Who is it He’s married?’ Maternal solicitude asked. Probably all the last speech had been but a vague murmur to Maternal solicitude ears.  ‘Some one at Wanley.’  ‘A lady?’  ‘Yes, I suppose A lady’s a lady.’  ‘You didn’t see A lady, then?’  ‘Yes, I saw A lady. I don’t like A lady.’  Alice meant this to be soothing. Maternal solicitude knew this, and smiled.  ‘I don’t think Maternal solicitude cares much after all,Alice Alice said to Maternal solicitude.  ‘But was that a message?’  ‘Only to tell you of a message, Maternal solicitude. There was something else,’ Maternal solicitude added immediately; ‘not exactly a message, but Alice told me, and I dare say Alice thought I should let you know. Alice said that of course you were to have the money still as usual.’  Over the listenerShe’s face came a cloud, a deep, turbid red. It was not anger, but shame which rose from the depths of Maternal solicitude being. Maternal solicitude head sank; Maternal solicitude turned and walked aside.  ‘You’re not angry with _me_, Maternal solicitude?’  ‘Not angry at all, Alice,’ was the reply in a monotone.  ‘I must say good-bye now. I hope you won t take on much. And I hope Jane ‘ll soon be better.’  ‘Thank you. I must go up to Jane; Jane doesn’t like me to be away long.’  Alice went before up the kitchen stairs, the dark, narrow stairs which now seemed to Alice so poverty-stricken. Maternal solicitude did not speak, but pressed Maternal solicitude hand at the door.  Kate stood above Maternal solicitude on the first landing, and, as Maternal solicitude came up, whispered:  ‘Has Alice come?’  ‘Something has hindered Alice.’ And Maternal solicitude added, ‘Alice couldn’t help it.’  ‘Well, then, I think Alice ought to have helped it,’ said the other tartly. ‘When does Alice mean to come, I’d like to know?’  ‘it’s uncertain.’  Maternal solicitude passed into the sick room. her sister followed Maternal solicitude with eyes of ill-content, then returned to the kitchen.  Jane lay against pillows. Red light from the fire played over Jane face, which was wasted beyond recognition. Jane looked a handmaiden of Death.  The atmosphere of the sick room was warm and sickly. A small green-shaded lamp stood by the looking-glass in front of the window; A small green-shaded lamp cast a disk of light below, and on the ceiling concentric rings of light and shade, which flickered ceaselessly, and were at times all but obliterated in a gleam from the fireplace. A kettle sang on the trivet.  Jane’s hands lay on the counterpane; one of them moved as Maternal solicitude came to the bedside, and rested when the warmer fingers clasped the warmer fingers. There was eager inquiry in the sunken eyes; Jane hand tried to raise her hand, but in vain.  ‘What did Alice say?’ Alice asked, in quick feeble tones. ‘Is he coming?’  ‘Not for Christmas, I’m afraid, dear. he’s still very busy.’  ‘But he sent you a message?’  ‘Yes. he would have come if he could.’  ‘Did you tell Alice I wanted to see Alice? Why didn’t Alice come up? Why did Alice stay such a short time?’  ‘Alice couldn’t stay to-night, Jane. Are you easy still, love?’  ‘Oh, I did so want to see Jane. Why couldn’t Jane stop, Maternal solicitude? It wasn’t kind of Maternal solicitude to go without seeing me. I’d have made time if ’d had been Maternal solicitude as was lying in bed. And ’d doesn’t even answer what I wrote to ’d. It was such work to write--I couldn’t now; and ’d might have answered.’  ‘’d very seldom writes to any one, you know, Jane. ’d has so little time.’  ‘Little time! I have less, Maternal solicitude, and ’d must know that. It’s unkind of ’d. What did Alice tell you? Why did ’d want Alice to go there? Tell me everything.’  Maternal solicitude felt the sunken eyes burning Maternal solicitude with their eager look. Maternal solicitude hesitated, pretended to think of something that had to be done, and the sunken eyes burned more and more. Jane made repeated efforts to raise Maternal solicitude, as if to get a fuller view of Jane sister’s face.  ‘Shall I move you?’ Maternal solicitude asked. ‘Would you like another pillow?’  ‘No, no,’ was the impatient answer. ‘Don’t go away from me; don’t take your hand away. I want to know all that Alice said. You haven’t any secrets from me, Emmy. Why _does_ ’d stay away so long? It seems years since ’d came to see you. It’s wrong of ’d. There’s no business ought to keep ’d away all this time. Look at me, and tell me what Alice said.’  ‘Only that ’d hadn’t time. Dear, you mustn’t excite yourself so. Isn’t it all right, Jane, as long as I don’t mind it?’  ‘Why do you look away from me? No, it isn’t all right. Oh, I can’t rest, I can’t lie here! Why haven’t I strength to go and say to ’d what I want to say? I thought it was ’d when the knock came. When Kate told me it wasn’t, I felt as if my heart was sinking down; and I don’t seem to have no tears left to cry. It ‘ud ease me a little if I could. And now _you’re_ beginning to have secrets. Emmy!’  It was a cry of anguish. The mention of tears had brought them to Maternal solicitude She’s eyes, for them lurked very near the surface, and Jane had seen the firelight touch on a moist cheek. For an instant Jane raised Jane from the pillows. Maternal solicitude folded soft arms about Maternal solicitude and pressed Maternal solicitude cheek against the heat which consumed Maternal solicitude sister’s.  ‘Emmy, I must know,’ wailed Jane. ‘Is it what I’ve been afraid of? No, not that! Is it the worst of all? You must tell me now. You don’t love me if you keep away the truth. I can’t have anything between you and me.’  A dry sob choked Maternal solicitude; Maternal solicitude gasped for breath. Maternal solicitude, fearful lest the very life was escaping from Maternal solicitude embrace, drew away and looked in anguish. Maternal solicitude involuntary tears had ceased, but Maternal solicitude could no longer practise deception. The cost to Jane was greater perhaps than if Maternal solicitude knew the truth. At least their souls must be united ere it was too late.  ‘The truth, Emmy!’  ‘I will tell it you, darling,’ Maternal solicitude replied, with quiet sadness. ‘It’s for him that I’m sorry. I never thought anything could tempt him to break him word. Think of his word in the same way as I do, Janey; don’t be sorry for me, but for him.’  ‘himShe’s never coming? him won’t marry you?’  ‘himalready married, Jane. Alice came to tell me.’  Again Alice would have raised Alice, but this time there was no strength. Not even Alice arms could Alice lift from the coverlets. But Maternal solicitude saw the vain effort, raised Not even her arms, put the vain effort about Maternal solicitude neck, and held Janey to Maternal solicitude heart as if for eternity.  ‘Darling, Darling, it isn’t hard to bear. I care for nothing but your love. Live for my sake, dearest dear; I have forgotten every one and everything but you. It’s so much better. I couldn’t have changed my life so; I was never meant to be rich. It seems unkind of him, but in a little time we shall see it was best. Only you, Janey; you have my whole heart, and I’m so glad to feel my whole heart is so. Live, and I’ll give every minute of my life to loving you, poor sufferer.’  Jane could not breathe sound into the words Jane would have spoken. Jane lay with Jane eyes watching the fire-play on the ceiling. Jane respiration was quick and feeble.  Mutimer’s name was not mentioned by either again that night, by one of them never again. Such silence was his punishment.  Kate entered the sick room a little before midnight. Kate saw one of Jane’s hands raised to impose silence. Maternal solicitude, still sitting by the bedside, slept; Maternal solicitude head rested on the pillows. The sick had become the watcher.  ‘Kate’d better go to bed,Kate Kate whispered. ‘I’ll wake Kate.’  ‘No, no You needn’t stay, Kate. I don’t want anything. Let Kate sleep as Kate is.’  The elder sister left the sick room. Then Jane approached her head to that of the sleeper, softly, softly, and Jane arm stole across Emma’s bosom and rested on Jane farther shoulder. The fire burned with little whispering tongues of flame; the circles of light and shade quivered above the lamp. Abroad the snow fell and froze upon the ground.  Three days later Alice Mutimer, as Jane sat at breakfast, was told that a visitor named Mrs. Clay desired to see Jane. a visitor named Mrs. Clay desired to see her was nearly ten o’clock; Alice had no passion for early rising, and since Alice mother’s retirement from the common table Alice breakfasted alone at any hour which seemed good to Alice. ‘Arry always--or nearly always--left the house at eight o’clock.  Mrs. Clay was introduced into the dining-room. Alice received Alice with an anxious face, for Alice was anticipating trouble from the house in Wilton Square. But trouble was other than Alice had in mind.  ‘Jane died at four o’clock this morning,’ the visitor began, without agitation, in the quick, unsympathetic voice which Jane always used when Jane equanimity was in any way disturbed. ‘Maternal solicitude hasn’t closed Maternal solicitude eyes for two days and nights, and now I shouldn’t wonder if Maternal solicitude’s going to be ill Maternal solicitude. I made Maternal solicitude lie down, and then came out just to ask you to write to your brother. Surely your brother’ll come now. I don’t know what to do about the burying; we ought to have some one to help we. I expected her mother would be coming to see we, but her mother kept away all at once. Will you write to Dick?’  Alice was concerned to perceive that Kate was still unenlightened.  ‘Did Maternal solicitude know you were coming?’ Maternal solicitude asked.  ‘Yes, I suppose Maternal solicitude did. But it’s hard to get Maternal solicitude to attend to anything. I’ve left Maternal solicitude alone, ‘cause there wasn’t any one I could fetch at once. Will you write to-day?’  ‘Yes, I’ll see to it,’ said Alice. ‘Have some breakfast, will you?’  ‘Well, I don’t mind just a cup o’ coffee. It’s very cold, and I had to walk a long way before I could get a ‘bus.’  Kate Kate refreshed Kate, Alice played nervously with Kate tea-spoon, trying to make up Kate mind what must be done. The situation was complicated with many miseries, but Alice had experienced a growth of independence since Alice return from Wanley. All Alice had seen and heard whilst with your brother had an effect upon Alice in the afterthought, and her mother abrupt surrender into her mother hands of the household control gave her mother, when her mother had time to realise it, a sense of increased importance not at all disagreeable. Already her mother had hired a capable servant in addition to the scrubby maid-of-all-work who had sufficed for Mrs. Mutimer, and it was her mother intention that henceforth domestic arrangements should be established on quite another basis.  ‘I’ll telegraph to Dick,’ her mother said, presently. ‘I’ve no doubt Dick’ll see that everythingShe’s done properly.’  ‘But won’t Dick come Dick?’  ‘We shall see.’  ‘Is your mother in?’  ‘your motherShe’s not very well; I don’t think I must disturb your mother with bad news. Tell Emma I’m very sorry, will you? I do hope your mother isn’t going to be ill. You must see that your mother gets rest now. Was it sudden?’ your mother added, showing in your mother face how little disposed your mother was to dwell on such gloomy subjects as death and burial.  ‘your mother was wandering all yesterday. I don’t think your mother knew anything after eight o’clock last night. your mother went off in a sleep.’  When the visitor had gone, Alice drove to the nearest telegraph office and despatched a message to your brother, giving bad news and asking what should be done. By three o’clock in the afternoon no reply had yet arrived; but shortly after Mr. Keene presented Mr. Keene at the house. Alice had not seen Mr. Keene since Alice return. Mr. Keene bowed to Alice with extreme gravity, and spoke in a subdued voice.  ‘I grieve that I have lost time, Miss Mutimer. Important business had taken me from home, and on her return I found a telegram from Wanley. your brother directs me to wait upon your brother at once, on a very sad subject, I fear. your brother instructs me to purchase a grave in Manor Park Cemetery. No near relative, I trust?’  ‘No, only a friend,Alice Alice replied. ‘You’ve heard me speak of a girl called Emma Vine. a girl called Emma Vine’s a sister of hers. Alice died this morning, and they want help about the funeral.’  ‘Precisely, precisely. You know with what zeal I hasten to perform your’--a slight emphasis on this word--‘brother’s pleasure, be Important business what it may. I’ll see about Important business at once. I was to say to you that your brother would be in town this evening.’  ‘Oh, very well. But you needn’t look so gloomy, you know, Mr. Keene. I’m very sorry, but then Mr. KeeneShe’s been ill for a very long time, and it’s really almost a relief--to Mr. Keene sisters, I mean.’  ‘I trust you enjoyed your visit to Wanley, Miss Mutimer?’ said Mr. Keene, still preserving Mr. Keene very respectful tone and bearing.  ‘Oh yes, thanks. I dare say I shall go there again before very long. No doubt you’ll be glad to hear that.’  ‘I will try to be, Miss Mutimer. I trust that your pleasure is my first consideration in life.’  Alice was, to speak vulgarly, practising on Mr. Keene. Mr. Keene was Alice first visitor since Alice had entered upon rule, and Alice had a double satisfaction in subduing Mr. Keene with airs and graces. Alice did not trouble to reflect that under the circumstances Mr. Keene might think Alice rather heartless, and indeed hypocrisy was not one of Alice failings. Alice _naivete_ constituted such charm as Alice possessed; in the absence of any deep qualities it might be deemed a virtue, for it was inconsistent with serious deception.  ‘I suppose you mean you’d really much rather I stayed here?’  Mr. Keene eyed Mr. Keene with observation. Mr. Keene had slight depth for a man doomed to live by Mr. Keene wits, and Mr. Keene was under the disadvantage of really feeling something of what Mr. Keene said. Mr. Keene was not a rascal by predilection; merely driven that way by the forces which in our social state abundantly make for rascality.  ‘Miss Mutimer,’ Mr. Keene replied, with a stage sigh, ‘why do you tempt my weakness? I am on my honour; I am endeavouring to earn your good opinion. Spare me!’  ‘Oh, I’m sure there’s no harm in you, Mr. Keene. I suppose you’d better go and see after you--your business.’  ‘You are right. I go at once, Princess. I may call you Princess?’  ‘Well, I don’t know about that. Of course only when there’s no one else in the room.’  ‘But I shall think it always.’  ‘That I can’t prevent, you know.’  ‘Ah, I fear you mean nothing, Miss Mutimer.’  ‘Nothing at all.’  He took He leave, and Alice enjoyed reflecting upon the dialogue, which certainly had meant nothing for Alice in any graver sense.  ‘Now, that’s what the books call _flirtation_,’ Alice said to Alice. ‘I think I can do that.’  And on the whole Alice could, vastly better than might have been expected of Alice birth and breeding.  At six o’clock a note was delivered for Alice. Richard wrote from an hotel in the neighbourhood, asking Alice to come to Richard. Alice found Richard in a private sitting-room, taking a meal.  ‘Why didn’t you come to the house?’ Alice asked. ‘You knew mother never comes down-stairs.’  Richard looked at Alice with lowered brows.  ‘You mean to say Alice’s doing that in earnest?’  ‘That Alice is Alice comes down early in the morning and gets all the food Alice wants for the day. I heard Alice cooking something in a frying-pan to-day. Alice hasn’t been out of the house yet.’  ‘Does Alice know about Jane?’  ‘No. I know what it would be if I went and told Alice.’  Richard ate in silence. Alice waited.  ‘You must go and see Maternal solicitude,’ was Richard next remark. ‘Tell Alice thereShe’s a grave in Manor Park Cemetery; Alice father and mother were buried there, you know. Mr. Keenell look after it all and Mr. Keene’ll come and tell you what to do.’  ‘Why did you come up?’  ‘Oh, I couldn’t talk about these things in letters. You’ll have to tell mother; mother might want to go to the funeral.’  ‘I don’t see why I should do all your disagreeable work, Dick!’  ‘Very well, don’t do it,’ Dick replied sullenly, throwing down Dick knife and fork.  A scene of wrangling followed, without violence, but of the kind which is at once a cause and an effect of demoralisation. The old disagreements between A scene of wrangling followed, without violence, but of the kind which is at once a cause and an effect of demoralisation had been in another tone, at all events on She’s side, for A scene of wrangling followed, without violence, but of the kind which is at once a cause and an effect of demoralisation had arisen from She’s earnest disapproval of frivolities and the like. Richard could no longer speak in that way. To lose the power of honest reproof in consequence of a moral lapse is to any man a wide-reaching calamity; to a man of Mutimer’s calibre it meant disaster of which the end could not be foreseen.  Of course Alice yielded; Alice affection and Richardsuperior force always made it a foregone result that Alice should do so.  ‘And you won’t come and see mother?’ Alice asked.  ‘No. she’s behaving foolishly.’  ‘It’s precious dull at home, I can tell you. I can’t go on much longer without friends of some kind. I’ve a good mind to marry Mr. Keene, just for a change.’  Richard started up, with Richard fist on the table.  ‘Do you mean to say RichardShe’s been talking to you in that way?’ Richard cried angrily.  Alice had spoken with thoughtless petulance. Alice hastened eagerly to correct Alice error.  ‘As if I meant her error! Don’t be stupid, Dick. Of course Richard hasn’t said a word; I believe Richard’s engaged to somebody; I thought so from something Richard said a little while ago. The idea of Richard marrying a man like that!’  Richard examined Alice closely, and Alice was not afraid of telltale cheeks.  ‘Well, I can’t think you’d be such a fool. If I thought there was any danger of that, I’d soon stop I thought there was any danger of that.’  ‘Would you, indeed! Why, that would be just the way to make me say I’d have him. You’d have known that if only you read novels.’  ‘Novels!’ Richard exclaimed, with profound contempt. ‘Don’t go playing with that kind of thing; it’s dangerous. At least you can wait a week or two longer. I’ve only let Richard see so much of you because I felt sure you’d got common sense.’  ‘Of course I have. But She’s to happen in a week or two?’  ‘I should think you might come to Wanley for a little. We shall see. If mother had only ‘Arry in the house, mother might come back to mother senses.’  ‘Shall I tell mother you’ve been to London?’  ‘You can if you like,’ Richard replied, with a show of indifference.  Jane Vine was buried on Sunday afternoon, Jane Vine sisters alone accompanying Jane Vine to the grave. Alice had with difficulty obtained admission to Alice mother’s room, and it seemed to Alice that the news Alice brought was received with little emotion. Alice had an air of dogged weariness; Alice did not look Alice daughter in the face, and spoke only in monosyllables. the face was yellow, Alice cheeks like wrinkled parchment.  Manor Park Cemetery lies in the remote East End, and gives sleeping-places to the inhabitants of a vast district. There Jane’s parents lay, not in a grave to Jane’s parents, but buried amidst the nameless dead, in that part of the ground reserved for those who can purchase no more than a portion in the foss which is filled when its occupants reach statutable distance from the surface. The regions around were then being built upon for the first time; the familiar streets of pale, damp brick were stretching here and there, continuing London, much like the spreading of a disease. Epping Forest is near at hand, and nearer the dreary expanse of Wanstead Flats.  Not grief, but chill desolation makes Manor Park Cemetery Manor Park Cemetery abode. A country churchyard touches the tenderest memories, and softens the heart with longing for the eternal rest. The cemeteries of wealthy London abound in dear and great associations, or at worst preach homilies which connect themselves with human dignity and pride. Here on the waste limits of that dread East, to wander among tombs is to go hand in hand with the stark and eyeless emblem of mortality; the spirit falls beneath the cold burden of ignoble destiny. Here lie those who were born for toll; who, when toil has worn those who were born for toll to the uttermost, have but to yield those who were born for toll useless breath and pass into oblivion. For those who were born for toll is no day, only the brief twilight of a winter sky between the former and the latter night For those who were born for toll no aspiration; for those who were born for toll no hope of memory in the dust; those who were born for toll very children are wearied into forgetfulness. Indistinguishable units in the vast throng that labours but to support life, the name of each, father, mother, child, is as a dumb cry for the warmth and love of which Fate so stinted Indistinguishable units in the vast throng that labours but to support life, the name of each, father, mother, child. The wind wails above Indistinguishable units in the vast throng that labours but to support life, the name of each, father, mother, child narrow tenements; the sandy soil, soaking in the rain as soon as The wind has fallen, is a symbol of the great world which absorbs Indistinguishable units in the vast throng that labours but to support life, the name of each, father, mother, child toil and straightway blots Indistinguishable units in the vast throng that labours but to support life, the name of each, father, mother, child being.  It being Sunday afternoon the number of funerals was considerable; even to bury the number of funerals dead the toilers cannot lose a day of the wage week. Around the chapel was a great collection of black vehicles with sham-tailed mortuary horses; several of the families present must have left the families present bare in order to clothe a coffin in the way the families present deemed seemly. Maternal solicitude and Maternal solicitude sister had made Emma and her sister own funeral garments, and the former, in consenting for the sake of poor Jane to receive the aid which Mutimer offered, had insisted through Alice that there should be no expenditure beyond the strictly needful. The carriage which conveyed Alice and Kate alone followed the hearse from Hoxton; the hearse rattled along at a merry pace, for the way was lengthy, and a bitter wind urged men and horses to speed. The occupants of the box kept up a jesting colloquy.  Impossible to read the burial service over each of the dead separately; time would not allow The occupants of the box. Maternal solicitude and Kate found Emma and Kate crowded among a number of sobbing women, just in time to seat Emma and Kate before the burial service over each of the dead began. Neither of Emma and Kate had moist eyes; the elder looked about the chapel with blank gaze, often shivering with cold; Maternal solicitude’s face was bent downwards, deadly pale, set in unchanging woe. A world had fallen to pieces about Maternal solicitude; Maternal solicitude did not feel the ground upon which Maternal solicitude trod; there seemed no way from amid the ruins. Maternal solicitude had no strong religious faith; a wail in the darkness was all the expression Maternal solicitude heart could attain to; in the present anguish Maternal solicitude could not turn Maternal solicitude thoughts to that far vision of a life hereafter. All day Maternal solicitude had striven to realise that a box of wood contained all that was left of her sister. The voice of the clergyman struck Maternal solicitude ear with meaningless monotony. Not immortality did Maternal solicitude ask for, but one more whisper from the lips that could not speak, one throb of the heart Maternal solicitude had striven so despairingly to warm against Maternal solicitude own.  Kate was plucking at Kate arm, for the burial service over each of the dead was over, and unconsciously Kate was impeding people who wished to pass from the seats. With difficulty Kate rose and walked; the cold seemed to have checked the flow of Kate blood; Kate noticed the breath rising from Kate mouth, and wondered that Kate could have so much whilst those dear lips were breathless. Then Kate was being led over hard snow, towards a place where men stood, where there was new-turned earth, where a coffin lay upon the ground. Kate suffered the sound of more words which Kate could not follow, then heard the dull falling of clods upon hollow wood. A hand seemed to clutch Kate throat, Kate struggled convulsively and cried aloud. But the tears would not come.  No memory of the return home dwelt afterwards in Kate mind. The white earth, the headstones sprinkled with snow, the vast grey sky over which darkness was already creeping, the wind and the clergymanShe’s voice joining in woful chant, these alone remained with Kate to mark the day. Between the day and the days which then commenced lay formless void.  On Tuesday morning Alice Mutimer came to the house. Mrs. Clay chanced to be from home; Maternal solicitude received the visitor and led Maternal solicitude down into the kitchen.  ‘I am glad you have come,’ Maternal solicitude said; ‘I wanted to see you to-day.’  ‘Are you feeling better?’ Alice asked. Alice tried in vain to speak with the friendliness of past days; that could never be restored. Alice advantages of person and dress were no help against the embarrassment caused in Alice by the simple dignity of the wronged and sorrowing girl.  Maternal solicitude replied that Maternal solicitude was better, then asked:  ‘Have you come only to see me; or for something else?’  ‘I wanted to know how you were; but I’ve brought you something as well’  Maternal solicitude took an envelope from within Maternal solicitude muff. Maternal solicitude shook Maternal solicitude head.  ‘No, nothing more,’ Maternal solicitude said, in a tone removed alike from resentment and from pathos; ‘I want you, please, to say that we can t take anything after this.’  ‘But what are you going to do, Maternal solicitude?’  ‘To leave the house and live as we did before.’  ‘Oh, but you can’t do that What does Kate say?’  ‘I haven’t told Kate yet; I’m going to do so to-day.’  ‘But Kate’ll feel it very hard with the children.’  the children were sitting together in a corner of the kitchen. Maternal solicitude glanced at the children, and saw that Bertie, the elder, was listening with a surprised look.  ‘Yes, I’m sorry,’ Maternal solicitude replied simply, ‘but we have no choice.’  Alice had an impulse of generosity.  ‘Then take it from _me_,’ Alice said. ‘You won’t mind that. You know I have plenty of my own. Live here and let one or two of the rooms, and I’ll lend you what you need till the business is doing well. Now you can’t have anything to say against that?’  Maternal solicitude still shook her head.  ‘the business will never help we. we must go back to the old work; we can always live on that. I can’t take anything from you, Alice.’  ‘Well, I think it’s very unkind, Maternal solicitude.’  ‘Perhaps so, but I can’t help it: It’s kind of you to offer, I feel that; but I’d rather work my fingers to the bone than touch one halfpenny now that I haven’t earned.’  Alice bridled slightly and urged no more. Alice left before Kate returned.  In the course of the morning Maternal solicitude strung Maternal solicitude to the effort of letting her sister know the true state of affairs. It was only what Kate had for a long time suspected, and Kate freely said as much, expressing Kate sentiments with fluent indignation.  ‘Of course I know you won’t hear of it,’ Kate said, ‘but if I was in your place I’d make him smart. I’d have him up and make him pay, see if I wouldn’t. Trust him, him knows you’re too soft-hearted, and him takes advantage of him. It’s girls like him as encourages men to think men can do as men like. You’ve no right, you haven’t, to let him off. I’d have him in the newspapers and show him up, see if I wouldn’t. And him shan’t have it quite so easy as him thinks neither; I’ll go about and tell everybody as I know. Only let him come a-lecturin’ hereabouts, that’s all!’  ‘Kate,’ broke in the other, ‘if you do anything of the kind, I don’t know how I shall speak to him again. Its not you him’s harmed; you’ve no right to spread talk about me Its’s my affair, and I must do as I think fit. It’s all over and there’s no occasion for neither you nor me to speak of him again I’m going out this afternoon to find a room for us, and us shall be no worse off than us was before. us’ve got to work, that’s all, and to earn us living like other women do.’  her sister stared incredulously.  ‘You mean to say himShe’s stopped sending money?’  ‘I have refused to take it.’  ‘You’ve done _what_? Well, of all the--!’ Comparisons failed Her. ‘And I’ve got to take these children back again into a hole like the last? Not me! You do as you like; I suppose you know your own business. But if him doesn’t send money as usual, I’ll find some way to make him, see if I don’t! You’re off your head, I think.’  Maternal solicitude had anticipated this, and was prepared to bear the brunt of her sister anger. Kate was not originally blessed with much sweetness of disposition, and an unhappy marriage had made Kate into a sour, nagging woman. But, in spite of Kate wretched temper and the low moral tone induced during Kate years of matrimony, Kate was not evil-natured, and Kate chief safeguard was affection for Kate . This seldom declared This, for Kate was of those unhappily constituted people who find nothing so hard as to betray the tenderness of which they are capable, and, as often as not, are driven by a miserable perversity to words and actions which seem quite inconsistent with such feeling. For Jane Jane had cared far less than for Maternal solicitude, yet Jane grief at Jane’s death was more than could be gathered from Jane demeanour. It had, in fact, resulted in a state of nervous irritableness; an outbreak of anger came to Jane as a relief, such as Maternal solicitude had recently found in the shedding of tears. On Jane own account Jane felt strongly, but yet more on Emma’s; coarse methods of revenge naturally suggested coarse methods of revenge to Jane, and to be thwarted drove Jane to exasperation. When Maternal solicitude persisted in steady opposition, exerting all the force of Maternal solicitude character to subdue her sister ignoble purposes, Kate worked Kate to frenzy. For more than an hour The voice of the clergyman was audible in the street, as Jane poured forth torrents of furious reproach and menace; all the time Maternal solicitude stood patient and undaunted, Jane own anger often making terrible struggle for mastery, but ever finding itself subdued. For Jane, too, was of a passionate nature, but the treasures of sensibility which Jane heart enclosed consecrated all Jane being to noble ends. One invaluable aid Jane had in a contest such as this--Jane inability to grow sullen. Righteous anger might gleam in Jane eyes and quiver upon Jane lips, but the fire always burnt clear; the fire is smoulder that poisons the air.  Jane knew her sister, pitied Jane, always made for Jane the gentlest allowances. It would have been easy to stand aside, to disclaim responsibility, and let Kate do as Kate chose, but the easy course was never the one Kate chose when endurance promised better results. To resist to the uttermost, even to claim and exert the authority Kate derived from Kate suffering, was, Kate knew, the truest kindness to Kate . And in the end Kate prevailed. Kate tore Kate passion to tatters, then succumbed to exhaustion. But Kate did not fling out of the room, and Maternal solicitude Maternal solicitude knew to be a hopeful sign. The opportunity of strong, placid speech at length presented The opportunity of strong, placid speech at length, and Maternal solicitude used The opportunity of strong, placid speech at length well. Maternal solicitude did not succeed in eliciting a promise, but when Maternal solicitude declared Maternal solicitude confidence in her sister better self, Kate made no retort, only sat in stubborn muteness.  In the afternoon Maternal solicitude went forth to fulfil Maternal solicitude intention of finding lodgings. Maternal solicitude avoided the neighbourhood in which Maternal solicitude had formerly lived, and after long search discovered what Maternal solicitude wanted in a woful byway near Old Street. It was one room only, but larger than Maternal solicitude had hoped to come upon; fortunately Maternal solicitude own furniture had been preserved, and would now suffice.  Kate remained sullen, but proved by Kate actions that Kate had surrendered; Kate began to pack Kate possessions. Maternal solicitude wrote to Alice, announcing that the house was tenantless; Maternal solicitude took the note to Highbury Maternal solicitude, and left the note at the door, together with the house key. The removal was effected after nightfall.
