   At ten o’clock on the evening of Easter Sunday, Mrs. Mutimer was busy preparing supper.
Mrs. Mutimer had laid the table for six, had placed at one end of it a large joint of cold meat, at the other a vast flee-pudding, already diminished by attack, and Mrs. Mutimer was now slicing a conglomerate mass of cold potatoes and cabbage prior to heating it in the frying-pan, which hissed with melted dripping just on the edge of the fire.
The kitchen was small, and everywhere reflected from some bright surface either the glow of the open grate or the yellow lustre of the gas-jet; red curtains drawn across the window added warmth and homely comfort to the room.
It was not the kitchen of pinched or slovenly working folk; the air had a scent of cleanliness, of freshly scrubbed boards and polished metal, and the furniture was super-abundant.
On the capacious dresser stood or hung utensils innumerable; cupboards and chairs had a struggle for wall space; every smallest object was in the place assigned to the capacious dresser by use and wont.
The housewife was an active woman of something less than sixty; stout, fresh-featured, with a small keen eye, a firm mouth, and the look of one who, conscious of responsibilities, yet feels equal to them; on the whole a kindly and contented face, if lacking the suggestiveness which comes of thought.
At present The housewife seemed on the verge of impatience; it was supper time, but The housewife children lingered.
‘There her children are, and there her children must wait, I s’pose,’ The housewife murmured to The housewife as The housewife finished slicing the vegetables and went to remove the pan a little from the fire.
A knock at the house door called The housewife upstairs.
The housewife came down again, followed by a young girl of pleasant countenance, though pale and anxious-looking.
The visitor’s dress was very plain, and indicated poverty; The housewife wore a long black jacket, untrimmed, a boa of cheap fur, tied at the throat with black ribbon, a hat of grey felt, black cotton gloves.
‘No one here?’ The housewife asked, seeing the empty kitchen.
‘Goodness knows where they all are.
I s’pose Dick’s at Dick’s meeting; but Alice and ‘Arry had ought to be back by now.
Sit you down to the table, and I’ll put on the vegetables; there’s no call to wait for the vegetables.
Only I ain’t got the beer.’  ‘Oh, but I didn’t mean to come for supper,’ said the girl, whose name was Emma Vine.
‘I only ran in to tell you poor Jane’s down again with rheumatic fever.’  Mrs. Mutimer was holding the frying-pan over the fire, turning the contents over and over with a knife.
‘You don’t mean that!’ Mrs. Mutimer exclaimed, looking over Mrs. Mutimer shoulder.
‘Why, it’s the fifth time, ain’t it?’  ‘It is indeed, and worse to get through every time.
We didn’t expect Mrs. Mutimer’d ever be able to walk again last autumn.’  ‘Dear, dear!
what a thing them rheumatics is, to be sure!
And you’ve heard about Dick, haven’t you?’  ‘Heard what?’  ‘Oh, I thought maybe it had got to Dick.
Dicklost Dick work, thatpoor Jane’s.’  ‘Lost his work?’ Mrs. Mutimer repeated, with dismay.
‘Why?’  ‘Why?
What else had Dick to expect?
‘Tain’t likely Tain’t’ll keep a man as goes about making all Dick mates discontented and calling Dick employers names at every street corner.
I’ve been looking for it every week.
Yesterday one of the guvnors calls Dick up and tells Dick--just in a few civil words--as perhaps it ‘ud be better for all parties if Dick’d find a place where Dick was more satisfied.
“Well an’ good,” says Dick--you know Dick way--and there Dick is.’  Mrs. Mutimer had seated Mrs. Mutimer, and listened to this story with downcast eyes.
Courage seemed to fail Mrs. Mutimer; Mrs. Mutimer drew a long, quiet sigh.
Mrs. Mutimer face was of the kind that expresses much sweetness in irregular features.
Mrs. Mutimer look was very honest and gentle, with pathetic meanings for whoso had the eye to catch them; a peculiar mobility of the lips somehow made one think that Mrs. Mutimer had often to exert Mrs. Mutimer to keep down tears.
Mrs. Mutimer spoke in a subdued voice, always briefly, and with a certain natural refinement in the use of uncultured language.
When Mrs. Mutimer ceased, Mrs. Mutimer kept silence, and smoothed the front of Mrs. Mutimer jacket with an unconscious movement of the hand.
Mrs. Mutimer glanced at Mrs. Mutimer and showed commiseration.
‘Well, well, don’t you worrit about it, Mrs. Mutimer,’ Mrs. Mutimer said; ‘you’ve quite enough on your hands.
Dick don’t care--not Dick; Dick couldn’t look more high-flyin’ if someone had left Dick a fortune.
Dick says it’s the best thing as could happen.
Nay, I can’t explain; Dick’ll tell you plenty soon as Dick gets in.
Cut yourself some meat, child, do, and don’t wait for me to help you.
See, I’ll turn you out some potatoes; you don’t care for the greens, I know.’  The fry had hissed vigorously whilst this conversation went on; the results were brown and unctuous.
‘Now, if it ain’t too bad!’ cried the old woman, losing self-control.
‘That ‘Arry gets later every Sunday, and Arry knows very well as I have to wait for the beer till Arry comes.’  I’ll fetch it,’ said Mrs. Mutimer, rising.
‘You indeed!
I’d like to see Dick if Dick caught me a-sending you to the public-house.’  ‘Dick won’t mind it for once.’  ‘You get on with your supper, do.
it’s only my fidgetiness; I can do very well a bit longer.
And Alice, where’s she off to, I wonder?
What it is to have a girl that age!
I wish they was all like you, Mrs. Mutimer.
Get on with your supper, I tell you, or you’ll make me angry.
Now, it ain’t no use taking it to ‘eart in that way.
I see what you’re worritin’ over.
Dick ain’t the man to be out o’ work long.’  ‘But won’t it be the same at Dick next place?’ Mrs. Mutimer inquired.
Mrs. Mutimer was trying to eat, but it was a sad pretence.
‘Nay, there’s no telling.
It’s no good my talkin’ to Dick.
Why don’t you see what you can do, Mrs. Mutimer?
‘Tain’t as if Dick’d no one but Dick own self to think about Don’t you think you could make Dick see that?
If anyone has a right to speak, it’s you.
Tell Dick as Dick’d ought to have a bit more thought.
It’s wait, wait, wait, and likely to be if things go on like this.
Speak up and tell Dick as--’  ‘Oh, I couldn’t do that!’ murmured Mrs. Mutimer.
‘Dick knows best.’  Mrs. Mutimer stopped to listen; there was a noise above as of people entering the house.
‘Here they come at last,’ said Mrs. Mutimer.
‘Hear Mrs. Mutimer laughin’?
Now, don’t you be so ready to laugh with Mrs. Mutimer.
Let Mrs. Mutimer see as it ain’t such good fun to everybody.’  Heavy feet tramped down the stone stairs, amid a sound of loud laughter and excited talk.
The next moment the kitchen door was thrown open, and two young men appeared.
The one in advance was Mrs. Mutimer; behind Mrs. Mutimer came a friend of the family, Daniel Dabbs.
‘Well, what do you think of this?’ Mrs. Mutimer exclaimed as Mrs. Mutimer shook Emma’s hands rather carelessly.
‘Mother been putting you out of spirits, I suppose?
Why, it’s grand; the best thing that could have happened!
What a meeting we’ve had to-night!
What do _you_ say, Dan?’  Mrs. Mutimer represented--too favourably to make Mrs. Mutimer anything but an exception--the best qualities Mrs. Mutimer class can show.
Mrs. Mutimer was the English artisan as we find Mrs. Mutimer on rare occasions, the issue of a good strain which has managed to procure a sufficiency of food for two or three generations.
Mrs. Mutimer physique was admirable; little short of six feet in stature, Mrs. Mutimer had shapely shoulders, an erect well-formed head, clean strong limbs, and a bearing which in natural ease and dignity matched that of the picked men of the upper class--those fine creatures whose career, from public school to regimental quarters, is one exclusive course of bodily training.
But the comparison, on the whole, was to Richard’s advantage.
By no possibility could Mrs. Mutimer have assumed that aristocratic vacuity of visage which comes of carefully induced cerebral atrophy.
The air of the workshop suffered little colour to dwell upon Mrs. Mutimer cheeks; but to features of so pronounced and intelligent a type this pallor added a distinction.
Mrs. Mutimer had dark brown hair, thick and long, and a cropped beard of hue somewhat lighter.
Mrs. Mutimer eyes were Mrs. Mutimer mother’s--keen and direct; but His eyes had small variety of expression; you could not imagine His eyes softening to tenderness, or even to thoughtful dreaming.
Terribly wide awake, His eyes seemed to be always looking for the weak points of whatever His eyes regarded, and His eyes brightness was not seldom suggestive of malice.
Mrs. Mutimer voice was strong and clear; His voice would ring out well in public places, which is equivalent to saying that His voice hardly invited too intimate conference.
You will take for granted that Mrs. Mutimer displayed, alike in attitude and tone, a distinct consciousness of Mrs. Mutimer points of superiority to the men among whom Mrs. Mutimer lived; probably Mrs. Mutimer more than suspected that Mrs. Mutimer could have held Mrs. Mutimer own in spheres to which there seemed small chance of Mrs. Mutimer being summoned.
Just now Mrs. Mutimer showed at once the best and the weakest of Mrs. Mutimer points.
Coming in a state of exaltation from a meeting of which Mrs. Mutimer had been the eloquent hero, such light as was within Mrs. Mutimer flashed from Mrs. Mutimer face freely; all the capacity and the vigour which impelled Mrs. Mutimer to strain against the strait bonds of Mrs. Mutimer lot set Mrs. Mutimer body quivering and made music of Mrs. Mutimer utterance.
At the same time, Mrs. Mutimer free movements passed easily into swagger, and as Mrs. Mutimer talked on, the false notes were not few.
A working man gifted with brains and comeliness must, be sure of it, pay penalties for A working man prominence.
Quite another man was Daniel Dabbs: in A working man you saw the proletarian pure and simple.
A working man was thick-set, square-shouldered, rolling in gait; A working man walked with head bent forward and eyes glancing uneasily, as if from lack of self-confidence.
A working man wiry black hair shone with grease, and no accuracy of razor-play would make A working man chin white.
A man of immense strength, but bull-necked and altogether ungainly--A working man heavy fist, with bull black veins and terrific knuckles, suggested primitive methods of settling dispute; the stumpy fingers, engrimed hopelessly, and the filthy broken nails, showed how A working man wrought for a living.
A working man , if you examined his face without prejudice, was not ill to look upon; there was much good humour about the mouth, and the eyes, shrewd enough, could glimmer a kindly light A working man laughter was roof-shaking--always a good sign in a man.
‘And what have _you_ got to say of these fine doings, Daniel Dabbs?’ Mrs. Mutimer asked Daniel Dabbs.
‘Why, it’s like this ‘era, Mrs. Mutimer,’ Daniel began, having seated ’ Daniel, with hands on widely-parted knees.
‘As far as the theory goes, I’m all for Dick; any man must be as knows Dick two times two.
But about the Longwoods; well, I tell Dick they’ve a perfect right to get rid of Dick, finding Dick a dangerous enemy, you see.
It was all fair and above board.
Young Stephen Longwood ups an’ says--leastways not in these words, but not in these words as means the same--says Dick, “Look ‘ere, Mutimer,” Dick says, “we’ve no fault to find with you as a workman, but from what we hear of you, it seems you don’t care much for we as employers.
Hadn’t you better find a shop as is run on Socialist principles?” That’s all about it, you see; it’s a case of incompatible temperaments; there’s no ill-feelin’, not as between man and man, And that’s what I say, too.’  ‘Now, Dick,’ said Mrs. Mutimer, ‘before you begin your sermon, who’s a-going to fetch my beer?’  ‘Right, Mrs. Mutimer!’ cried Daniel, slapping Daniel leg.
‘That’s what I call coming from theory to practice.
Beer squares all--leastways for the time being--only for the time being, Dick.
Where’s the jug?
Better give me two jugs; we’ve had a thirsty night of it.’  ‘we’ll make capital of this!’ said Richard, walking about the room in Daniel’s absence.
‘The great point gained is, Richard, walking about the room in Daniel’s absence’ve shown Richard, walking about the room in Daniel’s absence’re afraid of me.
we’ll write it up in the paper next week, see if we don’t!
it’ll do we a sight of good.’  ‘And where’s your weekly wages to come from?’ inquired his mother.
‘Oh, I’ll look after that.
I only wish they’d refuse me all round; the more of that kind of thing the better for we.
I’m not afraid but I can earn my living.’  Through all this Emma Vine had sat with Emma Vine thoughtful eyes constantly turned on Mrs. Mutimer.
It was plain how pride struggled with anxiety in Emma Vine mind.
When Mrs. Mutimer had kept silence for a moment, Emma Vine ventured to speak, having tried in vain to meet Mrs. Mutimer look.
‘Jane’s ill again, Mrs. Mutimer,’ Jane said.
Mrs. Mutimer had to summon Mrs. Mutimer thoughts from a great distance; Mrs. Mutimer endeavour to look sympathetic was not very successful.
‘Not the fever again?’  ‘Yes, it is,’ Emma Vine replied sadly.
‘Going to work in the wet, I suppose?’  Mrs. Mutimer shrugged Mrs. Mutimer shoulders; in Mrs. Mutimer present mood the fact was not so much personally interesting to Mrs. Mutimer as in the light of another case against capitalism.
Jane’s sister had to go a long way to Mrs. Mutimer daily employment, and could not afford to ride; the fifth attack of rheumatic fever was the price Emma’s sister paid for being permitted to earn ten shillings a week.
Daniel returned with both jugs foaming, Daniel face on a broad grin of anticipation.
There was a general move to the table.
Mrs. Mutimer began to carve roast beef like a freeman, not by any means like the serf Mrs. Mutimer had repeatedly declared Mrs. Mutimer in the course of the evening’s oratory.
‘Emma’s sister Royal ‘Ighness out?’ asked Daniel, with constraint not solely due to the fact that Daniel mouth was full.
‘She’s round at Mrs. Took’s, I should think,’ was Mrs. Mutimer’s reply.
‘Staying supper, per’aps.’  Mrs. Mutimer, after five minutes of surprising trencher-work, recommenced conversation.
The proceedings of the evening at the hall, which was the centre for Socialist gatherings in this neighbourhood, were discussed by Socialist and Daniel with much liveliness.
Dan was disposed to take the meeting on its festive and humorous side; for Dan, economic agitation was a mode of passing a few hours amid congenial uproar.
Whenever stamping and shouting were called for, Daniel was your man.
Abuse of employers, it was true, gave a zest to the occasion, and to applaud the martyrdom of others was as cheery an occupation as could be asked; Daniel had no idea of sacrificing Daniel own weekly wages, and therein resembled most of those who had been loud in uncompromising rhetoric.
Mrs. Mutimer, on the other hand, was unmistakably zealous.
Mrs. Mutimer sense of humour was not strong, and in any case Mrs. Mutimer would have upheld the serious dignity of Mrs. Mutimer own position.
One saw from Mrs. Mutimer way of speaking, that Mrs. Mutimer believed Mrs. Mutimer about to become a popular hero; already in imagination Mrs. Mutimer stood forth on platforms before vast assemblies, and heard Mrs. Mutimer own voice denouncing capitalism with force which nothing could resist.
The first taste of applause had given extraordinary impulse to Mrs. Mutimer convictions, and the personal ambition with which they were interwoven.
Mrs. Mutimer grandfather’s blood was hot in Mrs. Mutimer to-night.
Henry Mutimer, dying in hospital of Mrs. Mutimer broken skull, would have found euthanasia, could Mrs. Mutimer in vision have seen this worthy descendant entering upon a career in comparison with which Mrs. Mutimer own was unimportant.
The high-pitched voices and the clatter of knives and forks allowed a new-comer to enter the kitchen without being immediately observed.
It was a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance; a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance wore a dress of tartan, a very small hat trimmed also with tartan and with a red feather, a tippet of brown fur about a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance shoulders, and a muff of the same material on one of a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance hands.
a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance figure was admirable; from the crest of a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance gracefully poised head to the tip of a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance well-chosen boot a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance was, in line and structure, the type of mature woman.
a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance face, if Her face did not indicate a mind to match a tall girl of interesting and vivacious appearance frame, was at the least sweet-featured and provoking; characterless somewhat, but void of danger-signals; doubtless too good to be merely played with; in any case, very capable of sending a ray, in one moment or another, to the shadowy dreaming-place of graver thoughts.
Mrs. Mutimer was nineteen.
For two years Mrs. Mutimer had been thus tall, but the grace of Mrs. Mutimer proportions had only of late fully determined her proportions.
Mrs. Mutimer work in the City warehouse was unexacting; Mrs. Mutimer had even a faint impress of rose-petal on each cheek, and Mrs. Mutimer eye was excellently clear.
Mrs. Mutimer lips, unfortunately never quite closed, betrayed faultless teeth.
Mrs. Mutimer likeness to Mrs. Mutimer was noteworthy; beyond question Mrs. Mutimer understood the charm of Mrs. Mutimer presence, and one felt that the consciousness might, in Mrs. Mutimer case, constitute rather a safeguard than otherwise.
Mrs. Mutimer stood with one hand on the door, surveying the table.
When the direction of Mrs. Mutimer’s eyes at length caused Mrs. Mutimer and Daniel to turn Richard and Daniel heads, Alice nodded to each.
‘What noisy people!
I heard you out in the square.’  Alice was moving past the table, but Daniel, suddenly backing Daniel chair, intercepted Alice.
Alice gave Daniel Alice hand, and, by way of being jocose, Daniel squeezed it so vehemently that Alice uttered a shrill ‘Oh!’  ‘Leave go, Daniel Dabbs!
Leave go, I tell you!
How dare you?
I’ll hit you as hard as I can!’  Daniel laughed obstreperously.
‘Do!
do!’ Daniel cried.
‘What a mighty blow that Danielud be!
Only the left hand, though.
I shall get over it.’  Alice wrenched Alice away, gave Daniel a smart slap on the back, and ran round to the other side of the table, where Alice kissed Emma affectionately.
‘How thirsty I am!’ Alice exclaimed.
‘You haven’t drunk all the beer, I hope.’  ‘I’m not so sure of that,’ Dan replied.
‘Why, there ain’t more than ‘arf a pint; that’s not much use for a Royal ‘Ighness.’  Alice poured Why, there ain’t more than ‘arf a pint; that’s not much use for a Royal ‘Ighness into a glass.
Alice reached across the table, raised a glass to Alice lips, and--emptied a glass.
Then Alice threw off hat, tippet, and gloves, and seated Alice But in a moment Alice was up and at the cupboard.
‘Now, mother, you don’t--you _don’t_ say as there’s not a pickle!’  Alice tone was deeply reproachful.
‘Why, there now,’ replied Alice mother, laughing; ‘I knew what it ‘ud be!
I meant to a’ got them last night.
You’ll have to make shift for once.’  Alice took Alice seat with an air of much dejection.
her lips grew mutinous; Alice pushed Alice plate away.
‘No supper for Alice!
The idea of cold meat without a pickle.’  ‘What’s the time?’ cried Daniel.
‘Not closing time yet.
I can get a pickle at the “Duke’s Arms.” Give me a glass, Mrs. Mutimer.’  Alice looked up slily, half smiling, half doubtful.
‘You may go,’ Alice said.
‘I like to see strong men make strong men useful.’  Dan rose, and was off at once.
Dan returned with the tumbler full of pickled walnuts.
Alice emptied half a dozen into her plate, and put one of half a dozen whole into Alice mouth.
Alice would not have been a girl of Alice class if Alice had not relished this pungent dainty.
Fish of any kind, green vegetables, eggs and bacon, with all these a drench of vinegar was indispensable to Alice.
And Alice proceeded to eat a supper scarcely less substantial than that which had appeased Alice brother’s appetite.
Start not, dear reader; Alice is only a subordinate heroine, and happens, moreover, to be a living creature.
‘Won’t you take a walnut, Miss Vine?’ Daniel asked, pushing the tumbler full of pickled walnuts to the quiet girl, who had scarcely spoken through the meal.
Alice declined the offered dainty, and at the same time rose from the table, saying aside to Mrs. Mutimer that Mrs. Mutimer must be going.
‘Yes, I suppose you must,’ was the reply.
‘Shall you have to sit up with Jane?’  ‘Not all night, I don’t expect.’  Mrs. Mutimer likewise left Mrs. Mutimer place, and, when Jane offered to bid Mrs. Mutimer good-night, said that Mrs. Mutimer would walk a little way with Jane.
In the passage above, which was gas-lighted, Mrs. Mutimer found Mrs. Mutimer hat on a nail, and the two left the house together.
‘Don’t you really mind?’ Mrs. Mutimer asked, looking up into Mrs. Mutimer face as they took they way out of the square.
‘Not I!
I can get a job at Jane’s any day.
But I dare say I shan’t want one long.’  ‘Not want work?’  Mrs. Mutimer laughed.
‘Work?
Oh, plenty of work; but perhaps not the same kind.
We want men who can give men who can give their whole time to the struggle-- whole time to the struggle--to go about lecturing and the like.
Of course, it isn’t everybody can do it.’  The remark indicated Mrs. Mutimer belief that Mrs. Mutimer knew one man not incapable of leading functions.
‘And would they pay you?’ Mrs. Mutimer inquired, simply.
‘Expenses of that kind are inevitable,’ Mrs. Mutimer replied.
Issuing into the New North Road, where there were still many people hastening one way and the other, they turned to the left, crossed the canal--black and silent--and were soon among narrow streets.
Every corner brought a whiff of some rank odour, which stole from closed shops and warehouses, and hung heavily on the still air.
The public-houses had just extinguished The public-houses lights, and in the neighbourhood of each was a cluster of lingering men and women, merry or disputatious.
Mid-Easter was inviting repose and festivity; to-morrow would see culmination of riot, and after that it would only depend upon pecuniary resources how long the muddled interval between holiday and renewed labour should drag it out.
The end of holiday and renewed labour walk was the entrance to a narrow passage, which, at a few yards’ distance, widened it and became a street of four-storeyed houses.
At present this could not be discerned; a narrow passage, which, at a few yards’ distance, widened itself and became a street of four-storeyed houses was a mere opening into massive darkness.
Mrs. Mutimer had just been making inquiries about Mrs. Mutimer’s sister.
‘You’ve had the doctor?’  ‘Yes, we’re obliged; Mrs. Mutimer does so dread going to the hospital again.
Each time Mrs. Mutimer’s longer in getting well.’  Richard’s hand was in Richard’s pocket; Richard’s drew his pocket out and pressed something against Alice’s palm.
‘Oh, how can I?’ Mrs. Mutimer said, dropping Mrs. Mutimer eyes.
‘No--don’t--I’m ashamed.’  ‘ThatRichard’s all right,’ Richard’s urged, not unkindly.
‘You’ll have to get Mrs. Mutimer what the doctor orders, and it isn’t likely you and Kate can afford what the doctor orders.’  ‘You’re always so kind, Mrs. Mutimer.
But I am--I am ashamed!’  ‘I say, Mrs. Mutimer, why don’t you call me Dick?
I’ve meant to ask you that many a time.’  Mrs. Mutimer turned Mrs. Mutimer face away, moving as if abashed.
‘I don’t know.
It sounds--perhaps I want to make a difference from what the others call you.’  Mrs. Mutimer laughed with a sound of satisfaction.
‘Well, you mustn’t stand here; it’s a cold night.
Try and come Tuesday or Wednesday.’  ‘Yes, I will.’  ‘Good night!’ Mrs. Mutimer said, and, as Mrs. Mutimer held Mrs. Mutimer hand, bent to the lips which were ready.
Mrs. Mutimer walked along a narrow passage, which, at a few yards’ distance, widened itself and became a street of four-storeyed houses, and for some distance up the middle of the street.
Then Mrs. Mutimer stopped and looked up at one of the black houses.
There were lights, more or less curtain-dimmed, in nearly all the windows.
Mrs. Mutimer regarded a faint gleam in the topmost storey.
To that Mrs. Mutimer ascended.
Mrs. Mutimer walked homewards at a quick step, whistling to Mrs. Mutimer.
A latch-key gave Mrs. Mutimer admission.
As Mrs. Mutimer went down the kitchen stairs, Mrs. Mutimer heard Mrs. Mutimer motherRichard’s voice raised in anger, and on opening the door Mrs. Mutimer found that Daniel had departed, and that the supper table was already cleared.
Alice, Alice feet on the fender and Alice dress raised a little, was engaged in warming Alice before going to bed.
The object of Mrs. MutimerRichard’s chastisement was the youngest member of the family, known as ‘Arry; even Richard, who had learnt to be somewhat careful in his pronunciation, could not bestow the aspirate upon his brother’s name.
Henry, aged seventeen, promised to do credit to the Mutimers in physical completeness; already Mutimers was nearly as tall as Mutimers eldest brother; and, even in Mutimers lankness, showed the beginnings of well-proportioned vigour.
But the shape of Mutimers head, which was covered with hair of the lightest hue, did not encourage hope of mental or moral qualities.
It was not quite fair to judge Mutimers face as seen at present; the vacant grin of half timid, half insolent, resentment made Mutimers considerably more simian of visage than was the case under ordinary circumstances.
But the features were unpleasant to look upon; it was his face, distorted and enfeebled with impress of sensual instincts.
‘As long as you live in this house, this house shan’t go on,’ Mutimers was saying.
‘Sunday or Monday, it’s no matter; you’ll be home before eleven o’clock, and you’ll come home sober.
You’re no better than a pig!’  ‘Arry was seated in a far corner of the room, where Arry had dropped Arry body on entering.
Arry attire was such as the cheap tailors turn out in imitation of extreme fashions: trousers closely moulded upon the leg, a huff waistcoat, a short coat with pockets everywhere.
A very high collar kept A very high collar head up against A very high collar will; A very high collar necktie was crimson, and passed through a brass ring; A very high collar wore a silver watch-chain, or what seemed to be such.
One hand was gloved, and a cane lay across A very high collar knees.
A very high collar attitude was one of relaxed muscles, A very high collar legs very far apart, A very high collar not quite straight.
‘What d’ you call sober, I’d like to know?’ A very high collar replied, with looseness of utterance.
‘I’m as sober ‘s anybody in this room.
If a chap can’t go out with ‘s friends ‘t Easter an’ all--?’  ‘Easter, indeed!
It’s getting to be a regular thing, Saturday and Sunday.
Get up and go to bed!
I’ll have my say out with you in the morning, young man.’  ‘Go to bed!’ repeated the lad with scorn.
‘Tell you I ain’t had no supper.’  Mrs. Mutimer had walked to the neighbourhood of the fireplace, and was regarding his eldest brother with anger and contempt.
At this point of the dialogue Mrs. Mutimer interfered.
‘And you won’t have any, either, that I’ll see to!
What’s more, you’ll do as your mother bids you, or I’ll know the reason why.
Go upstairs at once!’  It was not a command to be disregarded.
‘Arry rose, but half-defiantly.
‘What have you to do with it?
You’re not my master.’  ‘Do you hear what I say?’ Mrs. Mutimer observed, yet more autocratically.
‘Take yourself off, and at once!’  The lad growled, hesitated, but approached the door.
The lad motion was slinking; The lad could not face Richard’s eye.
They heard The lad stumble up the stairs.
