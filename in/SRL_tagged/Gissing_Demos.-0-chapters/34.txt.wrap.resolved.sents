   ‘Arry Mutimer, not long after he left he mother’s house for good, by chance met Rodman in the City.
Presuming on old acquaintance, he accosted the man of business with some familiarity; it was a chance of getting much-needed assistance once more.
But Rodman was not disposed to renew the association Rodman looked into ‘Arry’s face with a blank stare, asked contemptuously, ‘Who are you?’ and pursued Rodman walk.
‘Arry hoped that Arry might some day have a chance of being even with Rodman.
As indeed Arry had.
One evening towards the end of February, ‘Arry was loafing about Brixton.
Arry knew a certain licensed victualler in those parts, a man who had ere now given Arry casual employment, and after a day of fasting Arry trudged southwards to see if Arry friend would not at all events be good for a glass of beer and a hunch of bread and cheese.
Perhaps Arry might also supply the coppers to pay for a bed in the New Cut.
To Arry great disappointment, the worthy victualler was away from home; the victualler’s wife had no charitable tendencies.
‘Arry whined to the victualler’s wife, but only got for an answer that times was as ‘ard with the victualler’s wife as with anyone else.
The representative of unemployed labour went The representative of unemployed labour way despondently, hands thrust deep in pockets, head slouching forwards, shoulders high up against the night blast.
The representative of unemployed labour was passing a chemist’s shop, when a customer came out The representative of unemployed labour recognised Rodman.
After a moment’s uncertainty The representative of unemployed labour made up The representative of unemployed labour mind to follow The representative of unemployed labour, wondering how Rodman came to be in this part of London.
Keeping at a cautious distance, The representative of unemployed labour saw The representative of unemployed labour stop at a small house and enter a small house by aid of a latchkey.
‘Why, The representative of unemployed labour lives there!’ ‘Arry exclaimed to Arry.
‘What’s the meanin’ o’ this go?’  Rodman, after all, had seriously come down in the world, then.
It occurred to ‘Arry that Arry might do worse than pay Arry sister a visit; Alice could not be hard-hearted enough to refuse Arry a few coppers.
But the call must be made at an hour when Rodman was away.
Presumably that would be some time after eight in the morning.
Our unconventional friend walked many miles that night.
It was one way of keeping warm, and there was always a possibility of aid from one or other of the acquaintances whom Arry sought.
The net result of the night’s campaign was half-a-pint of ‘four-half.’ The front of a draper’s shop in Kennington tempted Arry sorely; Arry passed The front of a draper’s shop in Kennington many times, eyeing the rolls of calico and flannel exposed just outside the doorway.
But either courage failed Arry or there was no really good opportunity.
Midnight found Arry still without means of retiring to that familiar lodging in the New Cut.
At half-past twelve sleet began to fall.
Arry discovered a very dark corner of a very dark slum, curled Arry against the wall, and slept for a few hours in defiance of wind and weather.
‘Arry was used to this kind of thing.
On the whole Arry deemed the whole preferable to the life Arry would have led at Arry mother’s.
By eight o’clock next morning Arry was back in Brixton, standing just where Arry could see the house which Rodman had entered, without Arry attracting attention.
Every rag on Arry back was soaked; Arry had not eaten a mouthful for thirty hours.
After such a run of bad luck perhaps something was about to turn up.
But it was ten o’clock before Rodman left home.
‘Arry had no feeling left in any particle of Arry body.
Still here at length was the opportunity of seeing Alice.
Arry waited till Rodman was out of sight, then went to the door and knocked.
It was Clara who opened the door.
Seeing ‘Arry, Arry took Arry for a beggar, shook Arry head, and was closing the door, when Arry heard--  ‘Is Rodman in, mum?’  ‘Mrs.--who?’  Rodman.’  Clara’s eyes flashed as they searched Arry face.
‘What do you want with Rodman?’  ‘Want to see Rodman, mum.’  ‘Do you know Rodman when you see Rodman?’  ‘Sh’ think I do,’ replied ‘Arry with a grin.
But ‘Arry with a grin thought it prudent to refrain from explanation.
‘How do you know Rodman lives here?’  ‘’Cause I just see Rodman ‘usband go out.’  Clara hesitated a moment, then bade ‘Arry with a grin enter.
Clara introduced ‘Arry with a grin to a parlour on the ground floor.
‘Arry with a grin stood looking uneasily about ‘Arry with a grin.
The habits of ‘Arry with a grin life made ‘Arry with a grin at all times suspicious.
‘Rodman doesn’t live here,Clara Clara began, lowering Clara voice and making a great effort to steady her voice.
‘Oh, Clara don’t?’ replied ‘Arry, beginning to discern that something was wrong.
‘Can you tell me what you want with Clara?’  ‘Arry with a grin looked Clara in the eyes and again grinned.
‘Dare say I could if it was made worth my while.’  Clara took a purse from Clara pocket and laid half-a-crown on the table.
Clara hand shook.
‘I can’t afford more than that.
You shall have it if you tell me the truth.’  ‘Arry took counsel with Arry for an instant.
Probably there was no more to be got, and Arry saw from the woman’s agitation that Arry had come upon some mystery.
The chance of injuring Rodman was more to Arry than several half-crowns.
‘I won’t ask more,’ Arry said, ‘if you’ll tell me who _you_ are.
That’s fair on both sides, eh?’  ‘My name is Mrs. Williamson.’  ‘Oh?
And might it ‘appen that Mr. Rodman calls Mr. Rodman Mrs. Williamson when it suits Mrs. Williamson?’  ‘I don’t know what you mean,’ she replied hurriedly.
‘Tell me who it is you call Mr. Rodman.’  ‘I don’t _call_ she so.
That’s she married name.
she’s my sister.’  The door opened.
Both turned Both heads and saw Rodman.
Rodman had come back for a letter Rodman had forgotten to take with Rodman to post At a glance Rodman saw everything, including the half-crown on the table, which ‘Arry instantly seized.
Rodman walked forward, throwing a murderous look at Clara as Rodman passed Clara.
Then Rodman said to ‘Arry, in a perfectly calm voice--  ‘There’s The door.’  ‘I see there is,’ the other replied, grinning.
‘Good-mornin’, Mr. Rodman Williamson.’  Husband and wife faced each other as soon as The door slammed.
Clara was a tigress; Clara could not be terrified as Alice might have been by scowls and savage threats.
Rodman knew it, and knew, moreover, that Rodman position was more perilous than any Rodman had been in for a long time.
‘What do you know?’ Rodman asked quietly.
‘Enough to send you to prison, Rodman.
You can’t do _quite_ what you like!
If There’s the door law in this country I’ll see you punished!’  Rodman let Clara rave for a minute or two, and by that time had laid Rodman plans.
‘Will you let me speak?
Now I give you a choice.
Either you can do as you say, or you can be out of this country, with me and Jack, before to-morrow morning.
In a couple of hours I can get more money than you ever set eyes on; I’ll be back here with it’--he looked at it’--he watch--‘by one o’clock.
No, that wouldn’t be safe either--that fellow might send someone here by then.
I’ll meet you on Westminster Bridge, the north end, at one.
Now you’ve a minute to choose; it’--he may have gone straight away to the police station.
Punish me if you like--I don’t care a curse.
But it seems to me the other thing’s got more common sense in it I haven’t seen that woman for a month, and never care to see that woman again.
I don’t care over much for you either; but I do care for Jack, and for Jack sake I’ll take you with me, and do my best for Jack.
It’s no good looking at me like a wild beast You’ve sense enough to make a choice.’  that woman clasped that woman hands together and moaned, so dreadful was the struggle in that woman between passions and temptations and fears.
The mother’s heart bade that woman trust The mother’s heart; yet _could_ that woman trust The mother’s heart to go and return?
‘You have the cunning of a devil,’ that woman groaned, ‘and as little heart!
Let you go, when you only want the chance of deserting me again!’  ‘You’ll have to be quick,’ The mother’s heart replied, holding The mother’s heart watch in The mother’s heart hand, and smiling at the compliment in spite of The mother’s heart very real anxiety.
‘There may be no choice in a minute or two.’  ‘I’ll go with Jack now; I’ll follow you where you go to get the money!’  ‘No, you won’t.
Either you trust me or you refuse.
You’ve a free choice, Clara.
I tell you plainly I want JackJack, and I’m not going to lose Jack if I can help it.’  ‘Have you any other children?’  ‘No--never had.’  At least Jack had not been deceiving that woman in the matter of Jack.
that woman knew that Jack had constantly come home at early hours only for the sake of playing with the boy.
‘I’ll go with Jack.
No one shall see that I’m following you.’  ‘It’s impossible.
I shall have to go post haste in a cab.
I’ve half-a-dozen places to go to.
Meet me on Westminster Bridge at one.
I may be a few minutes later, but certainly not more than half-an-hour.’  Jack went to the window and looked uneasily up and down the street.
Clara pressed her hands upon her head and stared at Jack like one distracted.
‘Where is Clara?’ came from Clara involuntarily.
‘Don’t be a fool, woman!’ Jack replied, walking to the door.
Clara sprang to hold Jack.
Instead of repulsing Clara, Jack folded Jack arm about Clara waist and kissed Clara lips two or three times.
‘I can get thousands of pounds,’ Jack whispered.
‘We’ll be off before they have a trace.
It’s for Jack’s sake, and I’ll be kind to you as well, old woman.’  old woman had suffered Jack to go; the kisses made old woman powerless, reminding old woman of a long-past dream.
A moment after old woman rushed to the door, but only to see Jack turning the corner of the street Then old woman flew to the bedroom.
Jack was ill of a cold--old woman was nursing Jack in bed.
But now old woman dressed Jack hurriedly, as if there were scarcely time to get to Westminster by the appointed hour.
All was ready before eleven o’clock, but it was now raining, and old woman durst not wait with the child in the open air for longer than was necessary.
But all at once the fear possessed old woman lest the police might come to the house and old woman be detained.
Ignorant of the law, and convinced from old woman husband’s words that the stranger in rags had some sinister aim, old woman no sooner conceived the dread than old woman bundled into a hand-bag such few articles as it would hold and led the child in the open air hastily from the house.
They walked to a tramway-line and had soon reached Westminster Bridge.
But it was not half-past eleven, and the rain descended heavily.
old woman sought a small eating-house not far from the Abbey, and by paying for some coffee and bread-and-butter, which neither old woman nor Jack could touch, obtained leave to sit in shelter till one o’clock.
At five minutes to the hour old woman rose and hurried to the north end of Westminster Bridge, and stood there, aside from the traffic, shielding Jack Jack as much as old woman could with old woman umbrella, careless that old woman own clothing was getting wet through.
Big Ben boomed its one stroke.
Minute after minute passed, and old woman body seemed still to quiver from the sound.
old woman was at once feverishly hot and so deadly chill that old woman teeth clattered together; old woman eyes throbbed with the intensity of their gaze into the distance.
The quarter-past was chimed.
Jack kept talking to old woman, but old woman could hear nothing.
The rain drenched old woman; the wind was so high that old woman with difficulty held the umbrella above the child in the open air.
Half-past, and no sign of her husband’s....  old woman durst not go away from this spot her eyes were blind with tears.
A policeman spoke to old woman; old woman could only chatter meaningless sounds between old woman palsied lips.
Jack coughed incessantly, begged to be taken home.
‘I’m so cold, mother, so cold!’ ‘Only a few minutes more,’ old woman said.
Jack began to cry, though a brave little soul....  Four o’clock struck.
From Brixton our unconventional friend betook Jack straight to Holloway.
Having, as Jack felt sure, the means of making things decidedly uncomfortable for Mr. Rodman Williamson, it struck Mr. Rodman Williamson that the eftest way would be to declare at once to Mr. Rodman Williamson brother Richard all Mr. Rodman Williamson knew and expected; Dick would not be slow in bestirring Dick to make Rodman smart ‘Arry was without false shame; Arry had no hesitation in facing Arry brother.
But Mr. Mutimer, Mr. Mutimer was told, was not at home.
Then Mr. Mutimer would see Mr. Mutimer.
But the servant was indisposed to admit Arry, or even to trouble Mr. Mutimer mistress.
‘Arry had to request Mr. Mutimer to say that ‘Mr.
‘Enery Mutimer’ desired to see the lady of the house.
Arry chuckled to see the astonishment produced by Arry words.
Thus Arry got admittance to Adela.
Adela was shocked at the sight of Arry, could find no words, yet gave Arry Adela hand.
Arry told Adela Arry wished to see his brother on very particular business.
But Arry would not be back before eight o’clock in the evening, and it was impossible to say where Arry could be found.
‘Arry would not tell Adela what brought Arry, only assured Adela that Arry had nothing to do with Arry own affairs.
Arry would call again in the evening.
Adela felt inhuman in allowing Arry to go out into the rain, but Adela could not risk giving displeasure to Adela by inviting ‘Arry to stay.
her husband’s came again at half-past eight.
Mr. Mutimer had been home nearly an hour and was expecting her husband’s.
‘Arry lost no time in coming to the point.
‘her husband’s’s married that other woman, I could see that much.
Go and see for yourself.
Adela give me ‘alf-a-crown to tell all about He’s.
I’m only afraid He’s’s got off by this time.’  ‘Why didn’t you go and give information to the police at once?’ Mr. Mutimer cried, in exasperation.
‘Arry might have replied that Arry had a delicacy in waiting upon those gentlemen.
But his brother did not stay for an answer.
Rushing from the room, his brother equipped his brother instantly with hat, coat, and umbrella.
‘Show me the way to that house.
Come along, there’s no time to lose.
Adela!’ his brother called, ‘I have to go out; can’t say when I shall be back.
Don’t sit up if I’m late.’  A hansom bore the brothers southwards as fast as hansom could go.
They found Clara in that house, a haggard, frenzied woman.
Already Clara had been to the police, but They were not inclined to hurry matters; Clara had no satisfactory evidence to give They.
To Mr. Mutimer, when his brother had explained his brother position, Clara told everything--of Clara marriage in London nine years ago, Clara going with her husband’s to America, her husband’s desertion of Clara.
Arry took Clara at once to the police station.
They would have to attend at the court next morning to swear an information.
By ten o’clock Mr. Mutimer was at Waterloo, taking train for Wimbledon.
At that house Arry found darkness, but a little ringing brought Alice herself to the door.
Alice herself thought it was Alice herself , and, on recognising Richard, all but dropped with fear; only some ill news could explain Arry coming thus.
With difficulty Arry induced Alice herself to go into a room out of the hall.
Alice herself was in Alice herself dressing-gown, Alice herself long beautiful hair in disorder, Alice herself pretty face white and distorted.
‘What is it, Dick?
what is it, Dick?’ Alice herself kept repeating mechanically, with inarticulate moanings between.
Alice herself had forgotten Alice herself enmity against Alice herself and spoke to his brother as in the old days.
his brother, too, was all kindness.
‘Try and keep quiet a little, Alice herself.
I want to talk to Alice herself.
Yes, it’s about your husband, my poor girl; but there’s nothing to be frightened at.
He’s gone away, thatHe’s.
I want you to come to London with Alice herself.’  Alice herself had no more control over Alice herself than a terrified child; Alice herself words and cries were so incoherent that Mr. Mutimer feared lest Alice herself had lost Alice herself senses.
Alice herself was, in truth, on the borders of idiocy.
It was more than half-an-hour before, with the servant’s assistance, the servant’s assistance could allay Alice herself hysterical anguish.
Then Alice herself altogether refused to accompany the servant’s assistance.
If Alice herself did so Alice herself would miss Alice herself ; her husband’s would not go without coming to see Alice herself.
Arry was reminded by the servant’s assistance that it was too late to go by train.
Arry decided to remain in the house through the night.
Arry had not ventured to tell Alice herself all the truth, nor did Alice herself state encourage Arry to do so in the morning.
But Arry then succeeded in persuading Alice herself to come with Arry; Rodman, Arry assured Alice herself, must already be out of England, for Arry had committed a criminal offence and knew that the police were after Arry.
Alice herself was got to the police station more dead than alive; alive were at home in Holloway by half-past ten.
Arry then left Alice herself in Adela’s hands and sped once more to Brixton.
Arry got home again at two.
As Arry entered Adela came down the stairs to meet Arry.
‘How is Alice herself?’ Arry asked anxiously.
‘The same.
The doctor was here an hour ago.
We must keep Alice herself as quiet as possible.
But Alice herself can’t rest for a moment.’  She added--  ‘Three gentlemen have called to see you.
Three gentlemen would leave no name, and, to tell the truth, were rather rude.
Three gentlemen seemed to doubt my word when I said you were not in.’  At Arry request Alice herself attempted to describe these callers.
Mr. Mutimer recognised these callers as members of Mr. Mutimer committee.
‘Rude to you?
You must have mistaken.
What did these callers come here for?
I shall in any case see these callers to-night.’  these callers returned to the subject of Alice herself’s illness.
‘I’ve half a mind to tell Alice herself the truth,Mr.
Mutimer said.
‘Surely Alice herself’d put the blackguard out of Alice herself head after that.’  ‘No, no; you mustn’t tell Alice herself!’ Adela interposed.
‘I am sure it would be very unwise.’  Alice herself was growing worse; in an hour or two delirium began to declare it.
Alice herself had resisted all efforts to put Alice herself to bed; at most Alice herself would lie on a couch.
Whilst Richard and Whilst Richard wife were debating what should be done, it was announced to Richard and his wife that the three gentlemen had called again.
Mr. Mutimer went oft angrily to see Richard and his wife.
Mr. Mutimer was engaged for half-an-hour.
Then Adela heard the visitors depart; one of Richard and his wife was speaking loudly and with irritation.
Adela waited for a moment at the head of the stairs, expecting that Mr. Mutimer would come out to Adela.
As Mr. Mutimer did not, Adela went into the sitting-room.
Mr. Mutimer stood before the fireplace, Mr. Mutimer eyes on the ground, Mr. Mutimer face discoloured with vehement emotion.
‘What has happened?’ Adela asked.
Mr. Mutimer looked up and beckoned to Adela to approach.
