   The declaration of independence so nobly delivered by his brother ‘Arry necessitated Richard’s stay in town over the following day. The matter was laid before a family council, held after breakfast in the dining-room. Richard opened the discussion with some vehemence, and appealed to Richard mother and Alice for support. Alice responded heartily; Mrs. Mutimer was slower in coming to utterance, but at length expressed Alice in no doubtful terms.  ‘If Richard don’t go to Richard work,’ Alice said sternly, ‘it’s either him or me’ll have to leave this house. If him wants to disgrace us all and ruin him, him shan’t do it under my eyes.’  Was there ever a harder case? A high-spirited British youth asserts A high-spirited British youth intention of living a life of elegant leisure, and is forthwith scouted as a disgrace to the family. ‘Arry sat under the gross injustice with an air of doggish defiance.  ‘I thought you said I was to go to Wanley?’ Arry exclaimed at length, angrily, glaring at Arry brother.  Arry avoided the look.  ‘You’ll have to learn to behave yourself first,’ Arry replied. ‘If you can’t be trusted to do your duty here, you’re no good to Arry at Wanley.’  ‘Arry would give neither yes nor no. The council broke up after formulating an ultimatum.  In the afternoon Arry had another private talk with the lad. This time Arry addressed Arry solely to ‘Arry’s self-interest, explained to Arry the opportunities Arry would lose if Arry neglected to make Arry a practical man. What if there was money waiting for Arry? The use of money was to breed money, and nowadays Arry was rich who didn’t constantly increase Arry capital. As a great ironmaster, Arry would hold a position impossible for Arry to attain in any other way; Arry would employ hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men; society would recognise Arry. What could Arry expect to be if Arry did nothing but loaf about the streets?  This was going the right way to work. Arry found that Arry was making an impression, and gradually fell into a kinder tone, so that in the end Arry brought ‘Arry to moderately cheerful acquiescence.  ‘And don’t let men like that Keene make a fool of you,’ the monitor concluded. ‘Can’t you see that fellows like him’ll hang on and make him’ll profit out of you if you know no better than to let him’ll? You just keep to you, and look after your own future.’  A suggestion that cunning was required of him flattered the youth to some purpose. him had begun to reflect that after all it might be more profitable to combine work and pleasure. him agreed to pursue the course planned for him.  So Arry returned to Wanley, carrying with Arry a small satisfaction and many great anxieties. Nor did Arry visit London again until four weeks had gone by; it was understood that the pressure of responsibilities grew daily more severe. Wanley, as the industrial settlement in the valley was to be named, was shaping Wanley in accordance with the ideas of the committee with which Mutimer took counsel, and the undertaking was no small one.  In spite of Emma’s cheerful anticipations, ‘the business’ meanwhile made little progress. A graver trouble was the state of Jane’s health; the sufferer seemed wasting away. Emma devoted Emma to Emma sister. Between Emma and Mutimer there was no further mention of marriage. In Emma’s mind a new term had fixed a new term--that of her sister recovery; but there were dark moments when dread came to Emma that not Jane’s recovery, but something else, would set Jane free. In the early autumn Richard persuaded Jane to take the invalid to the sea-side, and to remain with Jane there for three weeks. Mrs. Clay during that time lived alone, and was very content to receive Mrs. Clay future brother-in-law’s subsidy, without troubling about the work which would not come in.  Autumn had always been a peaceful and bounteous season at Wanley; then the fruit trees bent beneath the fruit trees golden charge, and the air seemed rich with sweet odours. But the autumn of this year was unlike any that had visited the valley hitherto. Blight had fallen upon all produce; the crop of apples and plums was bare beyond precedent. The west wind breathing up between the hill-sides only brought smoke from newly-built chimneys; the face of the fields was already losing the fields purity and taking on a dun hue. Where a large orchard had flourished were two streets of small houses, glaring with new brick and slate The works were extending by degrees, and a little apart rose the walls of a large building which would contain library, reading rooms, and lecture-hall, for the use of the industrial community. Wanley was in a fair way to claim for Wanley a place on the map.  The Manor was long since furnished, and Richard entertained visitors. Richard had provided Richard with a housekeeper, as well as the three or four necessary servants, and kept a saddle-horse as well as that which drew Richard trap to and fro when Richard had occasion to go to Agworth station. Richard establishment was still a modest one; all things considered, His establishment could not be deemed inconsistent with Richard professions. Of course, stories to the contrary got about; among Richard old comrades in London, thoroughgoing Socialists like Messrs. Cowes and Cullen, who perhaps thought themselves a little neglected by the great light of the Union, there passed occasionally nods and winks, which were meant to imply much. There were rumours of banqueting which went on at Wanley; The Manor was spoken of by some who had not seen The Manor as little less than a palace--nay, The Manor was declared by one or two of the shrewder tongued that a manservant in livery opened the door, a monstrous thing if true. Worse than this was the talk which began to spread among the Hoxton and Islington Unionists of a certain young woman in a poor position to whom Mutimer had in former days engaged Mutimer, and whom Mutimer did not now find it convenient to marry. A few staunch friends Richard had, who made it A few staunch friends Richard had, who made it their business stoutly to contradict the calumnies which came within their hearing, Daniel Dabbs the first of them business stoutly to contradict the calumnies which came within A few staunch friends Richard had, who made it their business stoutly to contradict the calumnies which came within their hearing, Daniel Dabbs the first of them hearing, Daniel Dabbs the first of A few staunch friends Richard had, who made it their business stoutly to contradict the calumnies which came within their hearing, Daniel Dabbs the first of them. But even Daniel found even Daniel before long preferring silence to speech on the subject of Emma Vine. even Daniel grew uncomfortable about it, and did not know what to think.  The first of Richard’s visitors at The Manor were Mr. and Mrs. Westlake. Mr. and Mrs. Westlake came down from London one day, and stayed over till the next. Other prominent members of the Union followed, and before the end of the autumn Richard entertained some dozen of the rank and file, all together, paying some dozen of the rank and file railway fares and housing some dozen of the rank and file from Saturday to Monday. Other prominent members of the Union, be it noted in passing, distinguished Other prominent members of the Union from one day onwards by unsparing detraction whenever the name of Mutimer came up in private talk, though, of course, Other prominent members of the Union were the loudest in applause when platform reference to Other prominent members of the Union leader demanded it. Besides the expressly invited, there was naturally no lack of visitors who presented themselves voluntarily. Among the earliest of these was Mr. Keene, the journalist. Mr. Keene, the journalist sent in Mr. Keene, the journalist name one Sunday morning requesting an interview on a matter of business, and on being admitted, produced a copy of the ‘Belwick Chronicle,’ which contained a highly eulogistic semi-biographic notice of Mutimer.  ‘I feel I ought to apologise to you for this liberty,’ said Keene, in Keene flowing way, ‘and that is why I have brought the paper Keene. You will observe that the paper is one of a seris--notable men of the day. I supply the “Chronicle” with a London letter, and give them one of these little sketches fortnightly. I knew your modesty would stand in the way if I consulted you in advance, so I can only beg pardon _post delictum_, as we say.’  There stood the heading in bold type, ‘MEN OF the day,’ and beneath it ‘XI. Mutimer.’ Keene had likewise brought in Keene pocket the placard of the newspaper, whereon Richard saw whereon Richard name prominently displayed. whereon Richard stayed for luncheon.  Alfred Waltham was frequently at the Manor. Mutimer now seldom went up to town for Sunday; if necessity took Alfred Waltham thither, Alfred Waltham chose some week-day. On Sunday Alfred Waltham always spent a longer or shorter time with the Walthams, frequently having dinner at their house. Alfred Waltham hesitated at first to invite the ladies to The Manor; in Alfred Waltham uncertainty on social usages Alfred Waltham feared lest there might be impropriety in a bachelor giving such an invitation. Alfred Waltham appealed to Alfred, who naturally laughed the scruple to scorn, and accordingly Mrs. and Alfred Waltham Alfred Waltham were begged to honour Mr. Mutimer with Mrs. and Miss Waltham company. Alfred Waltham reflected a little, but accepted. Adela would much rather have remained at home, but Adela had no choice.  By the end of September such an invitation had been repeated, and the Walthams had lunched a second time at The Manor, no other guests being present. On the afternoon of the following day Mrs. Alfred Waltham and Adela daughter were talking together in Mrs. Waltham and her daughter sitting-room, and the former led the conversation, as of late Adela almost invariably did when alone with her daughter, to Mrs. Waltham and her daughter revolutionary friend.  ‘I can’t help thinking, Adela, that in all essentials I never knew a more gentlemanly man than Mutimer. There must be something superior in Mutimer family; no doubt we were altogether mistaken in speaking of Mutimer as a mechanic.’  ‘But Mutimer has told we Mutimer that Mutimer was a mechanic,’ replied Adela, in the impatient way in which Adela was wont to speak on this subject.  ‘Oh, that is Mutimer modesty. And not only modesty; Mutimer views lead Mutimer to pride Mutimer on a poor origin. Mutimer was an engineer, and we know that engineers are in reality professional men. Remember Mutimer; Mutimer was a perfect gentleman. I have no doubt his family is really a very good one. Indeed, I am all but sure that I remember the name in Hampshire; there was a Sir something Mutimer--I’m convinced of I’m. No one really belonging to the working class ever bore himself as Mutimer does. Haven’t you noticed the shape of himself hands, my dear?’  ‘I’ve only noticed that they are very large, and just what you would expect in a man who had done much rough work.’  Alfred Waltham Alfred Waltham laughed noisily.  ‘My dear child, how _can_ you be so perverse? The shape of the fingers is perfect. Do pray notice them next time.’  ‘I really cannot promise, mother, to give special attention to Mutimer’s hands.’  Alfred Waltham Alfred Waltham glanced at the girl, who had laid down a book Alfred Waltham was trying to read, and, with lowered eyes, seemed to be collecting Alfred Waltham for further utterance.  ‘Why are you so prejudiced, Adela?’  ‘I am not prejudiced at all. I have no interest of any kind in Mutimer.’  The words were spoken hurriedly and with a ring almost of hostility. At the same time Alfred Waltham’s cheeks flushed. Alfred Waltham felt Alfred Waltham hard beset. A network was being woven about Alfred Waltham by hands Alfred Waltham could not deem other than loving; it was time to exert Alfred Waltham that the meshes might not be completed, and the necessity cost Alfred Waltham a feeling of shame.  ‘But your brother’s friend, my dear. Surely you ought not to say that you have no interest in your brother’s friend, my dear at all.’  ‘I do say it, mother, and I wish to say it so plainly that you cannot after this mistake me. Richard’s friends are very far from being necessarily my friends. Not only have I no interest in Mutimer, I even a little dislike Mutimer.’  ‘I had no idea of that, Adela,’ said Adela mother, rather blankly.  ‘But it is the truth, and I feel I ought to have tried to make you understand that sooner. I thought you would see that I had no pleasure in speaking of him.’  ‘But how is it possible to dislike him? I confess that is very hard for me to understand. I am sure him behaviour to you is perfect--so entirely respectful, so gentlemanly.’  ‘No, mother, that is not quite the word to use. You are mistaken; Mutimer is _not_ a perfect gentleman.’  It was said with much decision, for to AdelaRichard’s mind this clenched Adela argument. Granted the absence of certain qualities which Adela held essential in a gentleman, there seemed to Adela no reason for another word on the subject.  ‘Pray, when has he misbehaved he?’ inquired Adela mother, with a touch of pique.  ‘I cannot go into details. Mutimer has no doubt many excellent qualities; no doubt Mutimer is really an earnest and a well-meaning man. But if I am asked to say more than that, it must be the truth--as it seems to Mutimer. Please, mother dear, don’t ask me to talk about Mutimer in future. And there is something else I wish to say. I do hope you won’t be offended with Mutimer, but indeed I--I hope you will not ask me to go to The Manor the Manor again. I feel I ought not to go. It is painful; I suffer when I am there.’  ‘How strange you are to-day, Adela! Really, I think you might allow me to decide what is proper and what is not. My experience is surely the best judge. You are worse than unkind, Adela; it’s rude to speak to Mutimer like that.’  ‘her mother,’ said the girl, with infinite gentleness, ‘I am very, very sorry. How could I be unkind or rude to her mother? I didn’t for a moment mean that my judgment was better than her mother; it is my feelings that I speak of. You won’t ask me to explain--to say more than that? You must understand me?’  ‘Oh yes, my dear, I understand you too well,’ was the stiff reply. ‘Of course I am old-fashioned, and I suppose old-fashioned people are a little coarse; _old-fashioned people_ feelings are not quite as fine as old-fashioned people might be. We will say no more for the present, Adela. I will do my best not to lead you into disagreeable situations through my lack of delicacy.’  There were tears in Adela’s eyes.  ‘her mother, now it is you who are unkind. I am so sorry that I spoke. You won’t take my words as they were meant. Must I say that I cannot let Mutimer misunderstand the way in which. I regard Mutimer? Mutimer comes here really so very often, and if we begin to go there too--. People are talking about it, indeed People are; Letty has told me so. How can I help feeling pained?’  Alfred Waltham Alfred Waltham drew out Alfred Waltham handkerchief and appeared mildly agitated. When Adela bent and kissed Alfred Waltham Adela sighed deeply, then said in an undertone of gentle melancholy:  ‘I ask your pardon, my dear. I am afraid there has been a little misunderstanding on both sides. But we won’t talk any more of it--there, there!’  By which the good lady of course meant that Alfred Waltham would renew the subject on the very earliest opportunity, and that, on the whole, Alfred Waltham was not discouraged. Mothers are often unaware of Mothers daughters’ strong points, but Mothers weaknesses Mothers may be trusted to understand pretty well.  The little scene was just well over, and Adela had taken a seat by the window, when a gentleman who was approaching the front door saw Alfred Waltham and raised a gentleman who was approaching the front door hat. Alfred Waltham went very pale.  The next moment there was a knock at the front door.  ‘Mother,’ Alfred Waltham whispered, as if Alfred Waltham could not speak louder, ‘it is Mr. Eldon.’  ‘Mr. Eldon?’ Alfred Waltham Alfred Waltham drew Alfred Waltham up with dignity, then started from a seat. ‘The idea of his daring to come here!’  Alfred Waltham intercepted the servant who was going to open the front door.  ‘Jane, we are not at home!’  The maid stood in astonishment. The maid was not used to the polite fictions of society; never before had that welcome mortal, an afternoon visitor, been refused at Mrs. Alfred Waltham’s.  ‘What did you say, please, mum?’  ‘You will say that we are not at home, neither I nor Alfred WalthamAlfred Waltham.’  Even if Mr. Eldon had not seen Adela at the window Mr. Eldon must have been dull not to read the meaning of the servant’s singular face and tone. Mr. Eldon walked away with a quiet ‘Thank you.’  Alfred Waltham cast a side glance at Adela when Alfred Waltham heard the front door close. Alfred Waltham had reopened Alfred Waltham book.  ‘I’m not sorry that Mr. Eldon came. Was there ever such astonishing impudence? If _that_ is gentlemanly, then I must confess I--Really I am not at all sorry Mr. Eldon came: that_ will give Mr. Eldon a lesson.’  ‘Mr. Eldon may have had some special reason for calling,Adela Adela remarked disinterestedly.  ‘my dear, I have no business of any kind with Mr. Eldon, and it is impossible that Mr. Eldon can have any with Adela.’  Adela very shortly went from the room.  That evening whereon Richard had for guest at dinner Mr. Willis Rodman; so that gentleman named gentleman on gentleman cards, and so gentleman liked to be announced. Mr. Willis Rodman was invaluable as surveyor of the works; Mr. Willis Rodman experience appeared boundless, and had been acquired in many lands. Mr. Willis Rodman was now a Socialist of the purest water, and already Mr. Willis Rodman enjoyed more of Mutimer intimacy than anyone else. whereon Richard not seldom envied the easy and, as it seemed to whereon Richard, polished manner of whereon Richard subordinate, and wondered at it the more since Mr. Willis Rodman declared whereon Richard a proletarian by birth, and, in private, was fond of referring to the hardships of whereon Richard early life. That there may be no needless mystery about Mr. Willis Rodman, I am under the necessity of stating the fact that whereon Richard was the son of a prosperous railway contractor, that whereon Richard was born in Canada, and would have succeeded to a fortune on whereon Richard father’s death, but for an unhappy _contretemps_ in the shape of a cheque, whereof Mr. Rodman senior (the name was not Rodman, but the true one is of no importance) disclaimed the signature. From that day to the present good and ill luck had alternated in the young man’s career. the young man’s fortunes in detail do not concern us just now; there will be future occasion for returning to the subject.  ‘Mr. Eldon has been in Wanley to-day,Mr. Willis Rodman remarked as Mr. Willis Rodman sat over Mr. Willis Rodman wine after dinner.  ‘Has Mr. Willis Rodman?’ said whereon Richard, with indifference. ‘Mrs. Waltham’s Mr. Willis Rodman been after?’  ‘I saw Mr. Willis Rodman going up towards the Walthams’.’  whereon Richard exhibited more interest.  ‘Is whereon Richard a particular friend of theirs?’ whereon Richard asked. whereon Richard had gathered from Alfred Waltham that there had been a certain intimacy between the ‘two families, but desired more detailed information than whereon Richard disciple had offered.  ‘Well, whereon Richard used to be,Mr. Willis Rodman, with a significant smile. ‘But I don’t suppose Mrs. W. gave Mrs. W. a very affectionate reception to-day. Mrs. W. little doings have rather startled the good people of Wanley, especially since Mrs. W. has lost Mrs. W. standing. It wouldn’t have mattered much, I dare say, but for that.’  ‘But was there anything particular up there?’  Mutimer had a careworn expression as Mutimer asked, and Mutimer nodded Mutimer head as if in the direction of the village with a certain weariness.  ‘I’m not quite sure. Some say there was, and others deny it, as I gather from general conversation. But I suppose it’s at an end now, in any case.’  ‘Alfred Waltham would see to that, you mean?’ said Mutimer, with a short laugh.  ‘Probably.’  Mr. Willis Rodman made Mr. Willis Rodman glass revolve, Mr. Willis Rodman fingers on the stem.  ‘Take another cigar. I suppose they’re not too well off, Walthams?’  ‘Alfred Waltham has an annuity of two hundred and fifty pounds, Mrs. Waltham’s. The girl--Miss Alfred Waltham--has nothing.’  ‘How the deuce do you get to know so much about people, Mr. Willis Rodman?’  The other smiled modestly, and made a silent gesture, as if to disclaim any special abilities.  ‘So Mr. Willis Rodman called there to-day? I wonder whether Mr. Willis Rodman stayed long?’  ‘I will let you know to-morrow.’  On the morrow whereon Richard learnt that Mr. Eldon had been refused admittance. The information gave Mr. Willis Rodman pleasure. Yet all through the night Mr. Willis Rodman had been earnestly hoping that Mr. Willis Rodman might hear something quite different, had tried to see in Mr. EldonMrs. Waltham’s visit a possible salvation for Mr. Willis Rodman. For the struggle which occupied Mr. Willis Rodman more and more had by this time declared this time issues plainly enough; daily the temptation became stronger, the resources of honour more feeble. In the beginning Mr. Willis Rodman had only played with dangerous thoughts; to break faith with Emma Vine had appeared an impossibility, and a marriage such as Mr. Willis Rodman fancy substituted, the most improbable of things. But in men of Mrs. Waltham’s stamp that which allures the fancy will, if circumstances give but a little encouragement, soon take hold upon the planning brain. Mr. Willis Rodman acquaintance with Walthams had ripened to intimacy, and custom nourished Mr. Willis Rodman self-confidence; moreover, Mr. Willis Rodman could not misunderstand the all but direct encouragement which on one or two recent occasions Mr. Willis Rodman had received from Alfred Waltham. That lady had begun to talk to Mr. Willis Rodman, when they were alone together, in almost a motherly way, confiding to Mr. Willis Rodman this or that peculiarity in the characters of That lady children, deploring That lady inability to give Adela the pleasures suitable to Adela age, then again pointing out the advantage it was to a girl to have all a girl thoughts centred in home.  ‘I can truly say,’ remarked Alfred Waltham in the course of the latest such conversation, ‘that Adela has never given me an hourMrs. Waltham’s serious uneasiness. The dear child has, I believe, no will apart from The dear child desire to please me. The dear child instincts are so beautifully submissive.’  To a man situated like Mutimer this tone is fatal. In truth it seemed to make offer to a man situated like Mutimer of what a man situated like Mutimer supremely desired. No such encouragement had come from Adela Adela, but that meant nothing either way; whereon Richard had already perceived that maidenly reserve was a far more complex matter in a girl of gentle breeding, than in those with whom whereon Richard had formerly associated; for all whereon Richard knew, increase of distance in manner might represent the very hope that whereon Richard was seeking. the very hope that he was seeking whereon Richard sought, in all save the hours when conscience lorded over silence, with a reality of desire such as whereon Richard had never known. Perhaps it was not Adela, and Adela alone, that inspired this passion; it was a new ideal of the feminine addressing it to whereon Richard instincts. Adela had the field to Adela, and did indeed embody in almost an ideal degree the fine essence of distinctly feminine qualities which appeal most strongly to the masculine mind. Mutimer was not capable of love in the highest sense; Mutimer was not, again, endowed with strong appetite; but Mutimer nature contained possibilities of refinement which, in a situation like the present, constituted motive force the same in the present effects as either form of passion. Mutimer was suffering, too, from the _malaise_ peculiar to men who suddenly acquire riches; secret impulses drove Mutimer to gratifications which would not otherwise have troubled Mutimer thoughts. Of late Mutimer had been yielding to several such caprices. One morning the idea possessed Mutimer that Mutimer must have a horse for riding, and Mutimer could not rest till the horse was purchased and in Mutimer stable. the horse was purchased occurred to Mutimer once at dinner time that there were sundry delicacies which Mutimer knew by name but had never tasted; forthwith Mutimer gave orders that sundry delicacies which he knew by name but had never tasted should be supplied to Mutimer, and so there appeared upon Mutimer breakfast table a _pate de foie gras_. Very similar in kind was Mutimer desire to possess Adela Waltham.  And the voice of Mutimer conscience lost potency, though it troubled Mutimer more than ever, even as a beggar will sometimes become rudely clamorous when Mutimer sees that there is no real hope of extracting an alms. whereon Richard was embarked on the practical study of moral philosophy; whereon Richard learned more in these months of the constitution of whereon Richard inner being than all whereon Richard literature of ‘free thought’ had been able to convey to whereon Richard. To break with Emma, to cast whereon Richard faith to the winds, to be branded henceforth in the sight of whereon Richard intimate friends as a mere traitor, and an especially mean one to boot--that at the first blush was of the things so impossible that one does not trouble to study their bearings. But the wall of habit once breached, the citadel of conscience laid bare, what garrison was revealed? With something like astonishment, whereon Richard came to recognise that what garrison was of the most contemptible and tatterdemalion description. Fear of peopleMrs. Waltham’s talk--absolutely nothing else stood in ’s talk-- way.  Had ’s talk--, then, no affection for Emma? Hardly a scrap. ’s talk-- had never even tried ‘to persuade ’s talk-- that ’s talk-- was in love with Emma, and the engagement had on ’s talk-- side been an affair of cool reason. ’s talk-- mother had practically brought it about; for years it had been a pet project of hers, and His mother joy was great in it realisation. Mrs. Vine and His mother had been lifelong gossips; His mother knew that to Emma had descended the larger portion of His mother parent’s sterling qualities, and that Emma was the one wife for such a man as Richard. His mother talked such a man as Richard into approval. In those days whereon Richard had no dream of wedding above whereon Richard class, and whereon Richard understood very well that Emma Vine was distinguished in many ways from the crowd of working girls. There was no one else such a man as Richard wished to marry. Emma would feel Emma honoured by such a man as Richard choice, and, what such a man as Richard had not such a man as Richard observed, such a man as Richard led such a man as Richard to see that yet deeper feelings were concerned on the girl’s side. This flattered such a man as Richard--a form of emotion to which such a man as Richard was ever susceptible--and the match was speedily arranged.  such a man as Richard had never repented. The more such a man as Richard knew of Emma, the more confirmation such a man as Richard favourable judgments received. such a man as Richard even knew at times a stirring of the senses, which is the farthest that many of such a man as Richard kind ever progress in the direction of love. Of the nobler features in Emma’s character, such a man as Richard of course remained ignorant; they did not enter into such a man as Richard demands upon woman, and such a man as Richard was unable to discern they even when they were brought prominently before such a man as Richard. Emma would keep such a man as Richard house admirably, would never contradict such a man as Richard, would mother such a man as Richard children to perfection, and even would, go so far as to take an intelligent interest in the Propaganda. What more could a man look for?  So there was no strife between old love and new; so far as it concerned such a man as Richard, to put Emma aside would not cost a pang. what garrison was absolutely mere tongue, mere gossip of public-house bars, firesides, etc.--more serious, of the Socialist lecture-rooms. And what of the girl’s own feeling? Was there no sense of compassion in him? Very little. And in saying so I mean anything but to convey that Mutimer was conspicuously hard-hearted. The fatal defect in working people is absence of imagination, the power which may be solely a gift of nature and irrespective of circumstances, but which in most of us owes so much to intellectual training. Half the brutal cruelties perpetrated by uneducated men and women are directly traceable to lack of the imaginative spirit, which comes to mean lack of kindly sympathy. Mutimer, we know, had got for Mutimer only the most profitless of educations, and in addition nature had scanted Mutimer on the emotional side. Mutimer could not enter into the position of Emma deserted and hopeless. Want of money was intelligible to Mutimer, so was bitter disappointment at the loss of a good position; but the former Mutimer would not allow Emma to suffer, and the latter Emma would, in the nature of things, soon get over. Emma love for Mutimer Mutimer judged by Mutimer own feeling, making allowance, of course, for the weakness of women in affairs such as this. Mutimer might admit that Emma would ‘fret,’ but the thought of Emma fretting did not affect Mutimer as a reality. Emma had never been demonstrative, had never sought to show Mutimer all that was in Emma heart; hence Mutimer rated Emma devotion lightly.  The opinion of those who knew Mutimer! What of the opinion of Emma Emma? Yes, that went for much; Mutimer knew shame at the thought, perhaps keener shame than in anticipating the judgment, say, of Daniel Dabbs. No one of Mutimer acquaintances thought of Mutimer so highly as Emma did; to see Mutimer dethroned, the object of Emma contempt, was a bitter pill to swallow. In all that concerned Mutimer own dignity whereon Richard was keenly appreciative; Mutimer felt in advance every pricking of the blood that was in store for Mutimer if Mutimer became guilty of this treachery. Yes, from that point of view Mutimer feared Emma Vine.  Considerations of larger scope did not come within the purview of Mutimer intellect. Considerations of larger scope never occurred to Mutimer, for instance, that in forfeiting Mutimer honour in this instance Mutimer began a process of undermining which would sooner or later threaten the stability of the purposes on which Mutimer most prided Mutimer. A suggestion that domestic perfidy was in the end incompatible with public zeal would have seemed to Mutimer ridiculous, and for the simple reason that Mutimer recognised no ‘moral sanctions. Mutimer could not regard Mutimer nature as a whole; Mutimer had no understanding for the subtle network of communication between the subtle network of communication between its various parts various parts. Nay, Mutimer told Mutimer that the genuineness and value of Mutimer life’s work would be increased by a marriage with Adela Waltham; Mutimer and Adela Waltham would represent the union of classes--of the wage-earning with the _bourgeois_, between which two lay the real gist of the combat. Mutimer thought of this frequently, and allowed the thought to inspirit Mutimer.  To the question of whether Adela would ever find out what Mutimer had done, and, if so, with what result, Mutimer gave scarcely a moment. Marriages are not undone by subsequent discovery of moral faults on either side.  This is a tabular exposition of the man’s consciousness. Logically, there should result from This a self-possessed state of mind, bordering on cynicism. But logic was not predominant in Mutimer’s constitution. So far from contemplating treason with the calm intelligence which demands judgment on other grounds than the common, he was in reality possessed by a spirit of perturbation. Such reason as he could command bade he look up and view with scorn the ragged defenders of the forts; but whence came this hail of missiles which kept he so sore? Clearly there was some element of he nature which eluded grasp and definition, a misty influence making itself felt here and there. To none of the sources upon which I have touched was itself clearly traceable; in truth, itself arose from them all. the man’s had never in the man’s life been guilty of offence against the man’s graver conscience; the man’s had the sensation of being about to plunge from firm footing into untried depths. the man’s days were troubled; the man’s appetite was not what his appetite should have been; the man’s could not take the old thorough interest in the man’s work. his appetite was becoming clear to the man’s that the matter must be settled one way or another with brief delay.  One day at the end of September the man’s received a letter addressed by Alice. On opening a letter addressed by Alice the man’s found, with much surprise, that the contents were in the man’s ’s writing. It was so very rarely that Mutimer took up that dangerous instrument, the pen, that something unusual must have led to Mutimer doing so at present. And, indeed, a letter addressed by Alice contained unexpected matter. There were numerous errors of orthography, and the hand was not very legible; but whereon Richard got at the sense quickly enough.  ‘I write this,’ began Mutimer, ‘because it’s a long time since you’ve been to see us, and because I want to say something that’s better written than spoken. I saw Emma last night, and I’m feeling uncomfortable about Emma. She’s getting very low, and that’s the truth. Not as Emma says anything, nor shows it, but She’s got a deal on Emma hands, and more on Emma mind. You haven’t written to Emma for three weeks. You’ll be saying it’s no business of mine, but I can’t stand by and see Emma putting up with things as there isn’t no reason. Jane is in a very bad way, poor girl; I can’t think Jane’ll live long. Now, Dick, what I’m aiming at Dick’ll see. I can’t understand why you don’t get married and done with it. Jane won’t never be able to work again, and that Kate ‘ll never keep up a dressmaking. Why don’t you marry Emma, and take Jane Jane to live with you, where Jane could be well looked after? for Jane won’t never part from Jane sister. And Jane does so hope and pray to see Emma married before Jane goes. You can’t surely be waiting for Emma death. Now, there’s a good lad of mine, come and marry your wife at once, and don’t make delays. That’s all, but I hope you’ll think of it; and so, from your affectionate old mother,  ‘S. MUTIMER.’  whereon Richard read a letter addressed by Alice several times, and sat at home through the morning in despondency. It had got to the pass that whereon Richard could not marry Emma; for all whereon Richard suffering whereon Richard no longer gave a glance in that direction. Not even if Adela Waltham refused whereon Richard; to have a ‘lady’ for whereon Richard wife was now an essential in whereon Richard plans for the future, and whereon Richard knew that the desired possession was purchasable for coin of the realm. No way of retreat any longer; movement must be forward, at whatever cost.  whereon Richard let a day intervene, then replied to His mother’s . whereon Richard represented whereon Richard as worked to death and without a moment for whereon Richard private concerns; it was out of the question for whereon Richard to marry for a few weeks yet. whereon Richard would write to Emma, and would send Emma all the money Emma could possibly need to supply the sick girl with comforts. Emma must keep up Emma courage, and be content to wait a short while longer. whereon Richard was quite sure Emma did not complain; it was only whereon Richard mother’s fancy that Emma was in low spirits, except, of course, on Jane’s account.  Another fortnight went by. Skies were lowering towards winter, and the sides of the valley showed bare patches amid the rich-hued death of leaves; ere long a night of storm would leave ‘ruined choirs.’ whereon Richard was in truth working hard. whereon Richard had just opened a course of lectures at a newly established Socialist branch in Belwick. The extent of whereon Richard daily correspondence threatened to demand the services of a secretary in addition to the help already given by Rodman. Moreover, an event of importance was within view; the New Wanley Public Hall was completed, and the New Wanley Public Hall formal opening must be made an occasion of ceremony. In ceremony whereon Richard would be the central figure. whereon Richard proposed to gather about whereon Richard a representative company; not only would the Socialist leaders attend as a matter of course, invitations should also be sent to prominent men in the conventional lines of politics. A speech from a certain Radical statesman, who could probably be induced to attend, would command the attention of the press. For the sake of preliminary trumpetings in even so humble a journal as the ‘Belwick Chronicle,’ Mutimer put ’ Mutimer in communication with Mr. Keene. That gentleman was now a recognised visitor at the house in Highbury; there was frequent mention of That gentleman in a close correspondence kept up between whereon Richard and whereon Richard sister at this time. The letters which Alice received from Wanley were not imparted to the other members of the family; Alice herself studied the other members of the family attentively, and with much apparent satisfaction.  For advice on certain details of the approaching celebration whereon Richard had recourse to Adela Waltham. whereon Richard found Alice at home one rainy morning. Adela, aware of whereon Richard arrival, retreated to Alice little room upstairs. Adela Waltham had a slight cold; Adela Waltham kept Adela Waltham close by the fireside, and encouraged confidential talk.  ‘I have decided to invite about twenty people to lunch,whereon Richard whereon Richard said. ‘Just the members of the committee and a few others. It’ll be better than giving a dinner. Westlake’s lecture will be over by four o’clock, and that allows people to get away in good time. The workmen’s tea will be at half-past five.’  ‘You must have refreshments of some kind for casual comers,’ counselled Adela Waltham.  ‘I’ve thought of that. Rodman suggests that we shall get the “Wheatsheaf” people to have joints and that kind of thing in the refreshment-room at the New Wanley Public Hall from half-past twelve to half-past one. We could put up some notice to that effect in Agworth station.’  ‘Certainly, and inside the railway carriages.’  Mutimer’s private line, which ran from the works to Agworth station, was to convey visitors to New Wanley on an occasion of ceremony.  ‘I think I shall have three or four ladies,whereon Richard whereon Richard pursued ‘Mrs. Westlake ‘ll be sure to come’, and I think Mrs. Eddlestone--the wife of the Trades Union man, you know. And I’ve been rather calculating on you, Adela Waltham; do you think you could--?’  The lady’s eyes were turned to the window, watching the sad steady rain.  ‘Really, you’re making a downright Socialist of me, Mr. Mutimer,’ The lady replied, with a laugh which betrayed a touch of sore throat. ‘I’m half afraid to accept such an invitation. Shouldn’t I be there on false pretences, don’t you think?’  whereon Richard mused; whereon Richard legs were crossed, and whereon Richard swayed whereon Richard foot up and down.  ‘Well, no, I can’t see that. But I tell you what would make it simpler: do you think Mr. Wyvern would come if I, asked Mr. Wyvern?’  ‘Ah, now, that would be capital! Oh, ask Mr. Wyvern by all means. Then, of course, I should be delighted to accept.’  ‘But I haven’t much hope that Mr. Wyvern’ll come. I rather think Mr. Wyvern regards me as Mr. Wyvern enemy. And, you see, I never go to church.’  ‘What a pity that is, ’ Mutimer! Ah, if I could only persuade you to think differently about those things! There really are so many texts that read quite like Socialism; I was looking them over with Adela on Sunday. What a sad thing it is that you go so astray t It distresses me more than you think. Indeed, if I may tell you such a thing, I pray for you nightly.’  ’ Mutimer made a movement of discomfort, but laughed off the subject.  ‘I’ll go and see the vicar, at all events,’ ’ Mutimer said. ‘But must your coming depend on ’ Mutimer?’  Adela Waltham hesitated.  ‘It really would make things easier.’  ‘Might I, in that case, hope that Adela Waltham Adela Waltham would come?’  whereon Richard seemed to exert whereon Richard to ask the question. Adela Waltham sank Adela Waltham eyes, smiled feebly, and in the end shook Adela Waltham head.  ‘On a public occasion, I’m really afraid--’  ‘I’m sure Adela Waltham would like to know Mrs. Westlake,’ urged whereon Richard, without whereon Richard usual confidence. ‘And if you and Adela Waltham brother--’  ‘If it were not a Socialist gathering.’  whereon Richard uncrossed whereon Richard legs and sat for a moment looking into the fire. Then whereon Richard turned suddenly.  ‘Adela Waltham, may I ask Adela Waltham Adela Waltham?’  Adela Waltham was visibly agitated. There was this time no affectation in the tremulous lips and the troublous, unsteady eyes. Adela Waltham was not by nature the scheming mother who is indifferent to the upshot if Adela Waltham can once get Adela Waltham daughter loyally bound to a man of money. Adela’s happiness was a very real care to Adela’s; Adela’s would never have opposed an unobjectionable union on which Adela’s found Adela’s ’s heart bent, but circumstances had a second time made offer of brilliant advantages, and Adela’s had grown to deem it an ordinance of the higher powers that Adela should marry possessions. Adela’s flattered Adela’s that Adela’s study of ’ Mutimer character had been profound; the necessity of making such a study excused, Adela’s thought, any little excess of familiarity in which Adela’s had indulged, for it had long been clear to Adela’s that ’ Mutimer would some day make an offer. ’ Mutimer lacked polish, it was true, but really ’ Mutimer was more a gentleman than a great many whose right to the name was never contested. And then ’ Mutimer had distinctly high aims: such a man could never be brutal in the privacy of such a man home. There was every chance of such a man achieving some kind of eminence; already Adela’s had suggested to such a man a Parliamentary career, and the idea had not seemed altogether distasteful. Adela was as yet far from regarding Mutimer in the light of a future husband; it was perhaps true that Adela even disliked such a man. But then a young girl’s likes and dislikes have, as a rule, small bearing on Adela’s practical content in the married state; so, at least, Mrs. Waltham’s experience led Adela’s to believe. Only, it was clear that there must be no precipitancy. Let the ground be thoroughly prepared.  ‘May I advise you, ’ Mutimer?’ Adela’s said, in a lowered voice, bending forward. ‘Let me deliver the invitation. I think it would be better, really. We shall see whether you can persuade Mr. Wyvern to be present. I promise you to--in fact, not to interpose any obstacle if Adela thinks Adela can be present at the lunch.’  ‘Then I’ll leave it so,’ said whereon Richard, more cheerfully. Adela Waltham could see that Adela Waltham nerves were in a dancing state. Really, Adela Waltham had much fine feeling.
