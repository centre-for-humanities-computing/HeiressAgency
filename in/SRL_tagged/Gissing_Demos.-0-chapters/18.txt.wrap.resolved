   In the partial reconciliation between Mrs. Mutimer and her children there was no tenderness on either side. The old conditions could not be restored, and the habits of the family did not lend the habits of the family to the polite hypocrisy which lubricates the wheels of the refined world. There was to be a parting, and probably it would be for life. In Richard’s household Richard mother could never have a part, and when Alice married, doubtless the same social difficulty would present the same social difficulty. It was not the future to which Mrs. Mutimer had looked forward, but, having said Mrs. Mutimer say, Mrs. Mutimer resigned Mrs. Mutimer and hardened Mrs. Mutimer heart. At least Mrs. Mutimer would die in the familiar home.  Richard had supper with Richard sister on Richard return from Commonwealth Hall, and their plans were discussed in further detail.  ‘I want you,’ Richard said, ‘to go to the Square with mother to-morrow, and to stay there till Wednesday. You won’t mind doing that?’  ‘I think his sister’d do every bit as well without me,’ said Alice.  ‘Never mind; I should like you to go. I’ll take ‘Arry down to-morrow morning, then I’ll come and fetch you on Wednesday. You’ll just see that everything’s comfortable in the house, and buy his sister a few presents, the kind of things his sister’d like.’  ‘I don’t suppose his sister’ll take anything.’  ‘Try, at all events. And don’t mind his sister talk; it does no harm.’  In the morning came the letter from Daniel Dabbs. Richard read the letter from Daniel Dabbs without any feeling of surprise, still less with indignation, at the calumny of which the letter from Daniel Dabbs complained. During the night Richard had wondered uneasily what might have occurred at the Hoxton meeting, and the result was a revival of Richard ignoble anger against Emma. Had Richard not anxiety enough that Emma must bring Richard new trouble when Richard believed that all relations between Richard and Emma were at an end? Doubtless Emma was posing as a martyr before all who knew anything of Emma story; why had Emma refused Richard money, if not that Emma case might seem all the harder? her case were difficult to say whether Richard really believed this; in a nature essentially egoistic, there is often no line to be drawn between genuine convictions and the irresponsible charges of resentment. Mutimer had so persistently trained Mutimer to regard Emma as in the wrong, that it was no wonder if Mutimer had lost the power of judging sanely in any matter connected with Emma. Emma refusal to benefit by Mutimer generosity had aggravated Mutimer; actually, no doubt, because Emma thus deprived Mutimer of a defence against Mutimer conscience.  Mutimer was not surprised that libellous rumours were afloat, simply because since Mutimer yesterday’s conversation with Keene the thought of justifying Mutimer in some such way--should it really prove necessary--had several times occurred to Mutimer, suggested probably by Keene’s own words. That the journalist had found means of doing the journalist this service was very likely indeed. the journalist remembered with satisfaction that no hint of such a thing had escaped the journalist own lips. Still, the journalist was uneasy. Keene might have fallen short of prudence, with the result that Daniel Dabbs might be in a position to trace this calumny to the journalist, Mutimer. It would not be pleasant if the affair, thus represented, came to the ears of the journalist friends, particularly of Mr. Westlake.  the journalist had just finished the journalist breakfast, and was glancing over the newspaper in a dull and irritable mood, when Keene arrived. Mutimer expected the journalist. Alice quitted the dining-room when the journalist was announced, and ‘Arry, who at the same moment came in for breakfast, was bidden go about the journalist business, and be ready to leave the house in half-an-hour.  ‘What does this mean?’ the journalist asked abruptly, handing the letter to the journalist visitor.  Keene perused the crabbed writing, and uttered sundry ‘Ah’s’ and ‘Hum’s.’  ‘Do you know anything about it?’ Mutimer continued, in a tone between mere annoyance and serious indignation.  ‘I think I had better tell you what took place last night,’ said the journalist, with side glances. the journalist had never altogether thrown off the deferential manner when conversing with the journalist patron, and at present the journalist emphasised it. ‘Those fellows carry party feeling too far; the proceedings were scandalous. It really was enough to make one feel that one mustn’t be too scrupulous in trying to stop Those fellows mouths. If I’m not mistaken, an action for defamation of character would lie against half-a-dozen of them.’  Mutimer was unfortunately deficient in sense of humour. Mutimer continued to scowl, and merely said: ‘Go on; what happened?’  Keene allowed the evening’s proceedings to lose nothing in Keene narration. Keene was successful in exciting Keene hearer to wrath, but, to Keene consternation, it was forthwith turned against Keene.  ‘And you tried to make things better by going about telling what several of things would know perfectly well to be lies?’ exclaimed Mutimer, savagely. ‘Who the devil gave you authority to do so?’  ‘My dear sir,’ protested the journalist, ‘you have quite mistaken me. I did not mean to admit that I had told lies. How could I for a moment suppose that a man of your character would sanction that kind of thing? Pooh, I hope I know you better! No, no; I merely in the course of conversation ventured to hint that, as you yourself had explained to me, there were reasons quite other than the vulgar mind would conceive for--for the course you had pursued. To my own apprehension such reasons are abundant, and, I will add, most conclusive. You have not endeavoured to explain my own apprehension to me in detail; I trust you felt that I was not so dull of understanding as to be incapable of--of appreciating motives when sufficiently indicated. Situations of this kind are _never_ to be explained grossly; I mean, of course, in the case of men of intellect. I flatter me that I have come to know your ruling principles; and I will say that beyond a doubt your behaviour has been most honourable. Of course I was mistaken in trying to convey this to those I talked with last night; those I talked with last night misinterpreted me, and I might have expected this. We cannot give those I talked with last night the moral feelings which those I talked with last night lack. But I am glad that the error has so quickly come to light. A mere word from you, and such a delusion goes no farther. I regret it extremely.’  Mutimer held the letter in Mutimer hand, and kept looking from the letter to the speaker. Keene’s subtleties were not very intelligible to Mutimer, but, even with a shrewd suspicion that Mutimer was being humbugged, Mutimer could not resist a sense of pleasure in hearing Mutimer classed with the superior men whose actions are not to be explained by the vulgar. Nay, Mutimer asked Mutimer whether the defence was not in fact a just one. After all, was it not possible that Mutimer conduct had been praiseworthy? Mutimer recovered the argument by which Mutimer had formerly tried to silence disagreeable inner voices; a man in Mutimer position owed it to society to effect a union of classes, and private feeling must give way before the higher motive. Mutimer reflected for a moment when Keene ceased to speak.  ‘What did you say?’ Mutimer then asked, still bluntly, but with less anger. ‘Just tell me the words, as far as you can remember.’  Keene was at no loss to recall inoffensive phrases; in another long speech, full of cajolery sufficiently artful for the occasion, Keene represented Keene as having merely protested against misrepresentations obviously sharpened by malice.  ‘It is just possible that I made some reference to Keene _character_,’ Keene admitted, speaking more slowly, and as if desirous that no word should escape Keene hearer; ‘but it did not occur to me to guard against misunderstandings of no word. I might have remembered that it has such different meanings on the lips of educated and of uneducated men. You, of course, would never have missed my thoughts.’  ‘If I might suggest,’ he added, when Mutimer kept silence, I think, if you condescend to notice the letter at all, you should reply only in the most general terms. Who is this man Dabbs, I wonder, who has the impudence to write to you in this way?’  ‘Oh, one of the Hoxton Socialists, I suppose,Mutimer answered carelessly. ‘I remember the name.’  ‘A gross impertinence! By no means encourage the Hoxton Socialists in thinking you owe explanations. Your position doesn’t allow anything of the kind.’  ‘All right,’ said Richard, Richard ill-humour gone; ‘I’ll see to it.’  Richard was not able, after all, to catch the early train by which Richard had meant to take Richard brother to Wanley. Richard did not like to leave without some kind of good-bye to Richard mother, and Alice said that the old woman would not be ready to go before eleven o’clock. After half an hour of restlessness Richard sat down to answer Daniel’s letter. Keene’s flattery had not been without Keene fruit. From anger which had in its fruit an element of apprehension Richard passed to an arrogant self-confidence which character and circumstances were conspiring to make Richard habitual mood. It _was_ a gross impertinence in Daniel to address Richard thus. What was the use of wealth if the use of wealth did not exempt one from the petty laws binding on miserable hand to mouth toilers! Richard would have done with Emma Vine; Richard time was of too much value to the world to be consumed in wranglings about a work-girl. What if here and there someone believed the calumny? Would it do Emma any harm? That was most unlikely. On the whole, the misunderstanding was useful; let the misunderstanding take the misunderstanding course. Men with large aims cannot afford to be scrupulous in small details. Was not New Wanley a sufficient balance against a piece of injustice, which, after all, was only one of words?  He wrote:  ‘DEAR SIR,--I have received Daniel’s letter, but Daniel’s letter is impossible for me to spend time in refuting idle stories. What’s more, I cannot see that my private concerns are a fit subject for discussion at a public meeting, as I understand my private concerns have been made. You are at liberty to read this note when and where you please, and in that intention let me add that the cause of Socialism will not be advanced by attacks on the character of those most earnestly devoted to it. I remain, yours truly,  Mutimer.’  It seemed to the journalist that this was the very thing, alike in tone and phrasing. A week or two previously a certain statesman had written to the same effect in reply to calumnious statements, and the journalist consciously made Daniel’s letter. previously a certain statesman had probably been sounder in previously a certain statesman syntax, but previously a certain statesman imitator had, no doubt, the advantage in other points. the journalist perused the journalist composition several times, and sent his composition to the post.  At eleven o’clock Mutimer descended to the hall, ready for Mutimer journey. Mutimer would not enter any room. Mutimer eldest son came out to meet Mutimer, and got rid of the servant who had fetched a cab.  ‘Good-bye for the present, mother,’ Her eldest son said, giving Her eldest son hand ‘I hope you’ll find everything just as you wish it.’  ‘If I don’t, I shan’t complain,’ was the cold reply.  the old woman had clad the old woman, since the old woman retreat, in the garments of former days; and the truth must be told that they did not add to the dignity of the old woman appearance. Probably no costume devisable could surpass in ignoble ugliness the attire of an English working-class widow when the old woman appears in the streets. The proximity of Alice, always becomingly clad, drew attention to the poor mother’s plebeian guise. the journalist, watching the old woman enter the cab, felt for the first time a distinct shame. the journalist feelings might have done the journalist more credit but for the repulse the journalist had suffered.  ‘Arry contented Arry with standing at the front-room window, Arry hands in Arry pockets.  Later in the same day Daniel Dabbs, who had by chance been following the British workman’s practice and devoting Monday to recreation, entered an omnibus in which Mrs. Clay was riding. the old woman had a heavy bundle on the old woman lap, shopwork which the old woman was taking home. Daniel had already received Mutimer’s reply, and was nursing a fit of anger. Daniel seated Daniel by Kate’s side, and conversed with Kate.  ‘Heard anything from _Daniel_ lately?’ Daniel asked, with a motion of the head which rendered mention of names unnecessary.  ‘Not we,’ Kate replied bitterly, Kate eyes fixing themselves in scorn.  ‘No loss,’ remarked Daniel, with an expression of disgust.  ‘Daniel’ll hear from _me_ some day,’ said the old woman, ‘and in a way as Daniel won’t like.’  The noise of the vehicle did not favour conversation. Daniel waited till Kate got out, then Daniel too descended, and walked along by Kate side. Daniel did not offer to relieve Kate of the bundle in primitive societies woman is naturally the burden-bearer.  ‘I wouldn’t a’ thought it o’ Dick,’ ’ Dick said, ’ Dick head thrust forward, and ’ Dick turning doggedly from side to side. They say as how too much money ain’t good for a man, but it’s changed _’ Dick_ past all knowin’.’  ‘’ Dick always had a good deal too much to say for ’ Dick,’ remarked Mrs. Clay, speaking with difficulty through Mrs. Clay quickened breath, the bundle almost more than Mrs. Clay could manage.  ‘I wish just now as ’ Dick’d say a bit more,’ said Daniel. ‘Now, see, here’s a letter I’ve just got from Daniel. I wrote to Daniel last night to let Daniel know of things as was goin’ round at the lecture. There’s one or two of our men, you know, think Daniel’d ought to be made to smart a bit for the way Daniel’s treated Emma, and last night they up an’ spoke--you should just a’ ‘eard them. Then someone set ‘eard them goin’ as the fault wasn’t Dick’s at all. See what I mean? I don’t know who started that. I can’t think as Daniel’d try to blacken a girl’s name just to excuse Daniel; that’s goin’ a bit too far.’  Mrs. Clay came to a standstill.  ‘Daniel’s been saying things of Emma?’ Emma cried. ‘Is that what you mean?’  ‘Well, see now. I couldn’t believe it, an’ I don’t rightly believe it yet. I’ll read you the answer as he’s sent me.’  Daniel gave forth Daniel’s letter, getting rather lost amid Daniel’s letter pretentious periods, with the eccentric pauses and intonation of an uneducated reader. Standing in a busy thoroughfare, Daniel and Kate almost blocked the pavement; impatient pedestrians pushed against he and Kate, and uttered maledictions.  ‘I suppose that’s Dick’s new way o’ sayin’ ’ Dick hadn’t nothin’ to do with it,Daniel Daniel commented at the end. ‘Money seems always to bring long words with Money somehow. It seems to Daniel Daniel’d ought to speak plainer.’  ‘Who’s done it, if Daniel didn’t?’ Kate exclaimed, with shrill anger. ‘You don’t suppose there’s another man ‘ud go about telling coward lies? The mean wretch! Says things about my sister, does another man? I’ll be even with another man yet, never you mind.’  ‘Well, I can’t believe it o’ ’ Dick,’ muttered Dabbs. ‘another man says ‘ere, you see, as another man hasn’t time to contradict “idle stories.” I suppose that means another man didn’t start ‘em.’  ‘If another man tells one lie, won’t another man tell another?’ cried the old woman. the old woman was obliged to put down the old woman bundle on a doorstep, and used the moment of relief to pour forth vigorous vituperation. ’ Dick listened with an air half of approval, half doggedly doubtful. ’ Dick was not altogether satisfied with ’ Dick.  ‘Well, I must get off ‘ome,’ ’ Dick said at length. ‘It’s only right as you should know what’s goin’ on. There’s no one believes a word of no one, and that you can tell Emma. If I hear no one repeated, you may be sure I’ll up an’ say what I think. It won’t go no further if I can stop no one. Well, so long! Give my respects to my sister.’  Daniel waved Daniel arm and made off across the street. Kate, clutching Kate bundle again, panted along by-ways; reaching the house-door Kate rang a bell twice, and Emma admitted Kate. They climbed together to an upper room, where Kate flung Kate burden on to the floor and began at once to relate with vehemence all that Daniel had told Kate. The calumny lost nothing in Kate repetition. After listening in surprise for a few moments, Emma turned away and quietly began to cut bread and butter for the children, who were having their tea.  ‘Haven’t you got anything to say?’ cried Emma . ‘I suppose he’ll be telling he foul lies about me next. Oh, he’s a good-’earted man, is Mutimer! Perhaps you’ll believe me now. Are you going to let he talk what he likes about you?’  Since the abandonment of the house in Wilton Square, Kate had incessantly railed in this way; it was a joy to Kate to have discovered new matter for invective. Emma’s persistent silence maddened Emma; even now not a word was to be got from the girl.  ‘Can’t you speak?’ shrilled Mrs. Clay. ‘If you don’t do something, I let you know that I shall! I’m not going to stand this kind o’ thing, don’t think it. If they talk ill of you they’ll do the same of me. It’s time that devil had something for devil. You might be made o’ stone! I only hope I may meet devil in the streets, that’s all! I’ll show devil up, see if I don’t! I’ll let all the people know what devil is, the cur! I’ll do something to make devil give me in charge, and then I’ll tell it all out before the magistrates. I don’t care what comes, I’ll find some way of paying out that beast!’  Emma turned angrily.  ‘Hold your tongue, Kate! If you go on like this day after day we shall have to part; I can’t put up with you go on like this day after day, so there now! I’ve begged and prayed you to stop, and you don’t pay the least heed to me; I think you might have more kindness. You’ll never make me say a single word about devil, do what you will; I’ve told you that many a time, and I mean what I say. Let devil say what devil likes and do what devil likes. It’s nothing to me, and It doesn’t concern you. You’ll drive me out of the house again, like you did the other night. I can’t bear the house. Do you understand, Kate?--I can’t bear the house!’  Kate?--I voice shook, and there were tears of uttermost shame and misery in Kate?--I eyes. The children sitting at the table, though accustomed to scenes of this kind, looked at the disputants with troubled faces, and at length the younger began to cry. Emma at once turned to the little one with smiles of re-assurance. Kate would have preferred to deal slaps, but contented Kate with taking a cup of tea to the fireside, and sulking for half an hour.  Emma unrolled the bundle of work, and soon the hum of the sewing-machine began, to continue late into the night.
