   You remember that one side of the valley in which stood New Wanley was clad with trees.
Through this wood a public path made transverse ascent to the shoulder of the bill, a way little used save by Wanley ramblers in summer time.
The section of the wood above the path was closed against trespassers; among the copses below anyone might freely wander.
In places it was scarcely possible to make a way for fern, bramble, and underwood, but elsewhere mossy tracks led one among hazels or under arches of foliage which made of the mid-day sky a cool, golden shimmer.
One such track, abruptly turning round a great rock over the face of which drooped the boughs of an ash, came upon a little sloping lawn, which started from a high hazel-covered bank.
a high hazel-covered bank was so shaped as to afford an easy seat, shaded even when the grass in front was all sunshine.
Adela had long known this retreat, and had been accustomed to sit here with Letty, especially when Adela needed to exchange deep confidences with Adela friend.
Once, just as they were settling they upon a high hazel-covered bank, they were startled by a movement among the leaves above, followed by the voice of someone addressing they with cheerful friendliness, and making request to be allowed to descend and join they.
It was Hubert Eldon, just home for the long vacation.
Once or twice subsequently the girls had met Hubert on the same spot; there had been a picnic here, too, in which Mrs. Eldon and Mrs. Waltham took part.
But Adela always thought of the place as peculiarly Adela own.
To others it was only a delightfully secluded corner of the wood, fresh and green; for Adela it had something intimately dear, as the haunt where Adela had first met Adela own self face to face and had heard the whispering of secrets as if by another voice to Adela tremulous heart.
Adela sat here one morning in July, six months after Adela marriage.
It was more than a year since Adela had seen the spot, and on reaching it to-day it seemed to Adela less beautiful than formerly; the leafage was to Adela eyes thinner and less warm of hue than in earlier years, the grass had a coarser look and did not clothe the soil so completely.
An impulse had brought Adela hither, and Adela first sense on arriving had been one of disappointment.
Was the change in Adela way of seeing?
or had the retreat indeed suffered, perchance from the smoke of New Wanley?
The disappointment was like that we experience in revisiting a place kept only in memory since childhood.
Adela had not travelled much in the past year, but Adela growth in experience had put great tracts between Adela and the days when Adela came here to listen and wonder.
It was indeed a memory of Adela childhood that led Adela into the wood.
Adela had brought with Adela a German book on Socialism and a little German dictionary.
At the advice of Mr. Westlake, given some months ago on the occasion of a visit to the Manor, Adela had applied Adela diligently to this study.
But it was not only with a view to using the time that Adela had selected these books this morning.
In visiting a scene which would strongly revive the past, instinct--rather than conscious purpose--had bidden Adela keep firm hold upon the present.
On experiencing Adela disillusion a sense of trouble had almost led Adela to retrace Adela steps at once, but Adela overcame this, and, seating Adela on the familiar bank, began to toil through hard sentences.
Such moments of self-discipline were of daily occurrence in Adela life; Adela kept watch and ward over Adela feelings and found in efforts of the mind a short way out of inner conflicts which Adela durst not suffer to pass beyond the first stage.
Near at hand there grew a silver birch Hubert Eldon, on one of the occasions when he talked here with Adela and Letty, had by chance let he eyes wander from Adela to the birch tree, and he fancy, just then active among tender images, suggested a likeness between that graceful, gleaming stem with its delicately drooping foliage and the sweet-featured girl who stood before he with Adela head bowed in unconscious loveliness.
As the silver birch among the trees of the wood, so was Adela among the men and women of the world.
And to one looking upon Adela by chance such a comparison might still have occurred.
But in face Adela was no longer what Adela had then been.
Adela eyebrows, formerly so smooth and smiling, now constantly drew Her eyebrows, formerly so smooth and smiling together as if at a thought of pain or in some mental exertion.
Adela cheeks had none of Her eyebrows, formerly so smooth and smiling maiden colour.
Adela lips were closed too firmly, and sometimes trembled like those of old persons who have known much trouble.
In spite of Adela Adela attention flagged from the hard, dull book; the spirit of the place was too strong for Adela, and, as in summers gone by, Adela was lost in vision.
But not with eyes like these had Adela been wont to dream on the green branches or on the sward that lay deep in sunlight.
On Adela raised lids sat the heaviness of mourning; Adela seemed to strain Adela sight to something very far off, something which withdrew her sight from Adela desire, upon which Adela soul called and called in vain.
Her cheeks showed their thinness, Adela brow foretold the lines which would mark her brow when Adela grew old.
It was a sob in Adela throat which called Adela back to consciousness, a sob which Adela lips, well-trained warders, would not allow to pass.
Adela forced Adela to the book again, and for some minutes plied Adela dictionary with feverish zeal.
Then there came over Adela countenance a strange gleam of joy, as if Adela triumphed in self-conquest.
Adela smiled as Adela continued Adela work, clearly making a happiness of each mastered sentence.
And, looking up with the smile still fixed, Adela found that Adela solitude was invaded.
Letty Tew had just appeared round the rock which sheltered the green haven.
‘You here, Adela?’ Adela exclaimed.
‘How strange!’  ‘Why strange, Letty Tew?’  ‘Oh, only because I had a sort of feeling that perhaps I might meet you.
Not here, particularly,’ Adela added, as if eager to explain Adela, ‘but somewhere in the wood.
The day is so fine; The day tempts one to walk about.’  Letty Tew did not approach Letty Tew friend as Letty Tew would have done when formerly they met here.
Letty Tew manner was constrained, almost timid; Her manner seemed an afterthought when Letty Tew bent forward for the kiss.
Since Adela marriage the intercourse between Adela’s marriage had been comparatively slight.
For the first three months Adela’s marriage had seen each other only at long intervals, in part owing to circumstances.
After the fortnight Letty Tew spent in London at the time of Letty Tew marriage, Adela had returned to Wanley in far from Letty Tew usual state of health; during the first days of February there had been a fear that Letty Tew might fall gravely ill. Only in advanced spring had Letty Tew begun to go beyond the grounds of the Manor, and it was still unusual for Letty Tew to do so except in Letty Tew carriage.
Letty Tew had acquiesced in the altered relations; Letty Tew suffered, and for various reasons, but did not endeavour to revive an intimacy which Adela seemed no longer to desire.
Visits to the Manor were from the first distressing to Letty Tew; the natural subjects of conversation were those which both avoided, and to talk in the manner of mere acquaintances was scarcely possible.
Of course this state of things led to remark.
Mrs. Waltham was inclined to suspect some wrong feeling on Letty’s side, though of what nature it was hard to determine.
Alfred, on the other hand, took his sisterLetty’s behaviour ill, more especially as his felt a distinct change in his sister manner to his.
Was his sister going to be spoilt by the possession of wealth?
What on earth did his sister mean by his sister reserve, his sister cold dignity?
Wasn’t Letty good enough for his sister now that his sister was lady of the Manor?
Letty his sister, when the subject was spoken of, pretended to recognise no change beyond what was to be expected.
So far from being hurt, his sister love for Adela grew warmer during these months of seeming estrangement; Adela only trouble was that Adela could not go often and sit by Adela friend’s side--sit silently, hand holding hand.
That would have been better than speech, which misled, or at best was inadequate.
Meantime Adela supported Adela with the hope that love might some day again render Adela worthy of Adela’s confidence.
That her friend’s was far above Adela Adela had always gladly confessed; Adela felt it more than ever now that Adela tried in vain to read Adela secret thoughts.
Adela’s marriage was a mystery to Adela; to the last moment Adela had prayed that something might prevent Adela’s marriage.
Yet, now that Adela was Mrs. Mutimer, Adela conscientiously put away every thought of discontent, and only wondered what high motive had dictated the choice and--for such Adela knew the choice must be--the sacrifice.
‘What are you reading?’ Letty Tew asked, sitting down on the familiar bank at a little distance.
‘It’s hardly to be called reading.
I have to look out every other word.
It’s a book by a man called Schaeffle, on the “Social Question.”’  ‘Oh yes,’ said the girl, hazarding a conjecture that the work had something to do with Socialism.
‘Of course that interests you.’  ‘I think I’m going to write a translation of it.
My husband doesn’t read German, and a book is important.’  ‘I suppose you are quite a Socialist, Adela?’ Letty Tew inquired, in a tone which seemed anxious to presuppose the affirmative answer.
Letty Tew had never yet ventured to touch on the subject.
‘Yes, I am a Socialist,’ said Adela firmly.
‘I am sure anyone will be who thinks about it, and really understands the need for Socialism.
Does the word still sound a little dreadful to you?
I remember so well when the word did to me.
It was only because I knew nothing about it.’  ‘I don’t think I have that excuse,’ said the other.
‘Alfred is constantly explaining.
But, Adela--’  Adela paused, not quite daring to speak Adela thoughts.
Adela smiled an encouragement.
‘I was going to say--I’m sure you won’t be offended.
But you still go to church?’  ‘Oh yes, I go to church.
You mustn’t think that everything Alfred insists upon belongs to Socialism.
I believe that all Christians ought to be Socialists; I think all Christians ought to be Socialists is part of our religion, if only we carry all Christians ought to be Socialists out faithfully.’  ‘But does Mr. Wyvern think so?’  ‘Yes, Mr. Wyvern does; Mr. Wyvern does indeed.
I talk with Mr. Wyvern frequently, and I never knew, before Mr. Wyvern showed me, how necessary it is for a Christian to be a Socialist.’  ‘You surprise me, Adela.
Yet Mr. Wyvern doesn’t confess Mr. Wyvern a Socialist.’  ‘Indeed, Mr. Wyvern does.
When did you hear Mr. Wyvern preach a sermon without insisting on justice and unselfishness and love of our neighbour?
If our try to be just and unselfish, and to love our neighbour as ourself, our help the cause of Socialism.
Mr. Wyvern doesn’t deal with politics--it is not necessary Mr. Wyvern should.
That is for men like my husband, who give men like my husband, who give their lives to the practical work lives to the practical work.
Mr. Wyvern confines Mr. Wyvern to spiritual teaching.
Mr. Wyvern would injure Mr. Wyvern usefulness if Mr. Wyvern went beyond that.’  Letty Tew was awed by the exceeding change which showed Letty Tew not only in Adela’s ways of thought, but in Letty Tew very voice and manner of speaking.
The tone was so authoritative, so free from the diffidence which had formerly kept Adela from asserting strongly even Adela cherished faiths.
Adela felt, too, that with the maiden hesitancy something else had gone, at all events in a great degree; something that it troubled Adela to miss; namely, that winning persuasiveness which had been one of the characteristics that made Adela so entirely lovable.
At present Mrs. Mutimer scarcely sought to persuade; Mrs. Mutimer uttered Mrs. Mutimer beliefs as indubitable.
A competent observer might now and then have surmised that Mrs. Mutimer felt A competent observer needful to remind Mrs. Mutimer of the creed Mrs. Mutimer had accepted.
‘You were smiling when I first caught sight of you,’ Letty Tew said, after reflecting for a moment.
‘Was it something in the book?’  Adela again smiled.
‘No, something in myself,’ Mrs. Mutimer replied with an air of confidence.
‘Because you are happy, Adela?’  ‘Yes, because I am happy.’  ‘How glad I am to hear that, dear!’ Letty Tew exclaimed, for the first time allowing Mrs. Mutimer to use the affectionate word.
‘You will let me be glad with you?’  Mrs. Mutimer hands stole a little forward, but Adela did not notice Her hands; for Mrs. Mutimer was gazing straight before Mrs. Mutimer, with an agitated look.
‘Yes, I am very happy, I have found something to do in life.
I was afraid at first that I shouldn’t be able to give my husband any help in my husband work; I seemed useless.
But I am learning, and I hope soon to be of real use, if only in little things.
You know that I have begun to give a tea to the children every Wednesday?
the children’re not in need of food and comforts, I’m glad to say; nobody wants in Wanley; but it’s nice to bring the children together at the Manor, and teach the children to behave gently to each other, and to sit properly at table, and things like that.
Will you come and see the children to-day?’  ‘I shall be very pleased.’  ‘To-day I’m going to begin something new.
After tea we shall have a reading.
Mr. Wyvern sent me a book this morning--“Andersen’s Fairy Tales.”’  ‘Oh, I’ve read the children.
Yes, that’ll do nicely.
Read the children “The Ugly Duckling,” Adela; it’s a beautiful story.
I thought perhaps you were going to read something--something instructive, you know.’  Adela laughed.
It was Adela’s laugh still, but not what it used to be.
‘No, I want to amuse the children.
the children get enough instruction in school.
I hope soon to give another evening to the older girls.
I wonder whether you would like to come and help me then?’  ‘If only you would let me!
There is nothing I should like more than to do something for you.’  ‘But you mustn’t do it for you.
It must be for the girls’ sake.’  ‘Yes, for the children as well, but ever so much more for you, dear.
You can’t think how glad I am that you have asked me.’  Again the little hand was put forward, and this time Adela took the little hand.
But Adela did not soften as Adela once would have done.
With eyes still far away, Adela talked for some minutes of the hopes with which Adela life was filled.
Frequently Adela made mention of my husband, and always as one to whom it was a privilege to devote Adela.
Adela voice had little failings and uncertainties now and then, but this appeared to come of excessive feeling.
They rose and walked from the wood together.
‘Alfred wants us to go to Malvern for a fortnight,’ Letty Tew said, when us were near the gates of the Manor.
‘us were wondering whether you could come, Adela?’  ‘No, I can’t leave Wanley,’ was the reply.
‘My husband’--she never referred to Mutimer otherwise than by this name--‘spoke of the seaside the other day, but us decided not to go away at all.
There is so much to be done.’  When Adela went to the drawing-room just before luncheon, Adela found Mutimer engaged with a novel.
Reading novels had become an absorbing occupation with Alice.
Adela took them to bed with Adela so as to read late, and lay late in the morning for the same reason.
Adela must have been one of Mr. Mudie’s most diligent subscribers.
Adela had no taste for walking in the country, and could only occasionally be persuaded to take a drive.
It was not surprising that Adela face had not quite the healthy colour of a year ago; there was negligence, too, in Adela dress, and Adela had grown addicted to recumbent attitudes.
Between Adela and Adela no semblance of friendship had yet arisen, though the latter frequently sought to substitute a nearer relation for superficial friendliness.
Alice never exhibited anything short of good-will, but Alice first impressions were lasting; Alice suspected Alice sister-in-law of a desire to patronise, and was determined to allow nothing of the kind.
With a more decided character, Alice’s prepossessions would certainly have made life at the Manor anything but smooth; as it was, nothing ever occurred to make unpleasantness worth Alice while.
Besides, when not buried in Alice novels, Alice gave Alice up to absentmindedness; Adela found conversation with Alice almost impossible, for Alice would answer a remark with a smiling ‘Yes’ or ‘No,’ and at once go off into dreamland, so that one hesitated to disturb Alice.
‘What time is it?’ Alice inquired, when Alice became aware of Adela moving about the room.
‘All but half-past one.’  ‘Really?
I suppose I must go and get ready for lunch.
What a pity we can’t do without meals!’  ‘You should go out in the morning and get an appetite.
Really, you are getting very pale, Alice.
I’m sure you read far too much.’  Adela had it on Adela lips to say ‘too many novels,’ but was afraid to administer a direct rebuke.
‘Oh, I like reading, and I don’t care a bit for going out.’  ‘What about your practising?’ Adela asked, with a playful shake of the head.
‘Yes, I know it’s very neglectful, but really it is such awful work.’  ‘And your French?’  ‘I’ll make a beginning to-morrow.
At least, I think I will.
I don’t neglect things wilfully, but it’s so awfully hard to really get at it when the time comes.’  The luncheon-bell rang, and Alice, with a cry of dismay, sped to Alice room.
Alice knew that Alice brother was to lunch at home to-day, and Richard was terrible in the matter of punctuality.
As Soon as the meal was over Alice hastened back to Alice low chair in her room.
Richard and Richard wife went together into the garden.
‘What do you think Rodman’s been advising me this morning?’ Mutimer said, speaking with a cigar in Mutimer mouth.
‘It’s a queer idea; I don’t quite know what to think of It.
You know there’ll be a general election some time next year, and Mutimer advises me to stand for Belwick.’  Mutimer did not look at his wife.
Coming to a garden-seat, Mutimer put up one foot upon one foot, and brushed the cigar ash against the back.
Adela sat down; Adela had not replied at once, and was thoughtful.
‘As a Socialist candidate?’ Adela asked, when at length Mutimer turned Mutimer eyes to Adela.
‘Well, I don’t know.
Radical rather, I should think.
It would come to the same thing, of course, and there’d be no use in spoiling the thing for the sake of a name.’  Adela had a Japanese fan in Adela hand; Adela put a Japanese fan against Adela forehead, and still seemed to consider.
‘Do you think you could find time for Parliament?’  ‘That has to be thought of, of course; but by then I should think we might arrange then.
There’s not much that Rodman can’t see to.’  ‘You are inclined to think of then?’  Adela’s tone to my husband was not one of tenderness, but of studious regard and deference.
Adela very seldom turned his eyes to my husband, but there was humility in Adela bent look.
If ever my husband and Adela began to speak at the same time, Adela checked Adela instantly, and Mutimer had no thought of giving Adela precedence.
This behaviour in his wife struck my husband as altogether becoming.
‘I almost think I am,’ my husband replied.
‘I’ve a notion I could give them an idea or two at Westminster.
It would be news to them to hear a man say what a man really thinks.’  Adela smiled faintly, but said nothing.
‘Would you like me to be in Parliament?’ Richard asked, putting down Richard foot and leaning back Richard head a little.
‘Certainly, if you feel that it is a step gained.’  ‘That’s just what I think it would be.
Well, we must talk about it again.
By-the-by, I’ve just had to send a fellow about a man business.’  ‘To discharge a man?’ Adela asked, with pain.
‘Yes.
It’s a man; I was talking about a man the other day, you remember.
a manMr.
Mudie’s been getting drunk; I’ll warrant It’s not the first time.’  ‘And you really must send a man away?
Couldn’t you give a man another chance?’  ‘No.
a man was impudent to me, and I can’t allow that.
a man’ll have to go.’  Richard spoke with decision.
When the fact of impudence was disclosed Adela felt that it was useless to plead.
Adela looked at Adela fan and was sorrowful.
‘So you are going to read to the youngsters to-day?’ Mutimer recommenced.
‘Yes; Mr. Wyvern has given me a book that will do very well indeed.’  ‘Oh, has Mr. Wyvern?’ said Richard doubtfully.
‘Is it a religious book?
That kind of thing won’t do, you know.’  ‘No, it isn’t religious at all.
Only a book of fairy tales.’  ‘Fairy tales!’ There was scorn in his way of repeating the words.
‘Couldn’t you find something useful?
A history book, you know, or about animals, or something of that kind.
We mustn’t encourage A history book, you know, or about animals, or something of that kind in idle reading.
And that reminds me of Alice.
You really must get Alice away from her novels.
I can’t make out whatMr.
Mudie’s come to Alice.
Alice seems to be going off Alice head.
Did you notice at lunch?--she didn’t seem to understand what I said to Alice.
Do try and persuade Alice to practise, if nothing else.’  ‘I am afraid to do more than just advise in a pleasant way,’ said Adela.
‘Well, I shall lose my temper with Alice before long.’  ‘How is Harry doing?
‘Adela asked, to pass over the difficult subject.
‘Harry’s an idle scamp!
If some one ‘ud give some one ‘ a good thrashing, that’s what _some one ‘_ wants.’  ‘Shall I ask some one ‘ to dinner to-morrow?’  ‘You can if you like, of course,’ Richard replied with hesitation.
‘I shouldn’t have thought you cared much about having some one ‘.’  ‘Oh, I am always very glad to have some one ‘.
I have meant to ask you to let some one ‘ dine with us oftener.
I am so afraid some one ‘ should think us neglect some one ‘, and that would be sure to have a bad effect.’  Mutimer looked at Mutimer with satisfaction, and assented to Mutimer reasoning.
‘But about the fairy tales,Adela said presently, when Richard had finished Richard cigar and was about to return to the works.
‘Do you seriously object to them?
Of course I could find another book.’  ‘What do _you_ think?
I am rather surprised that Mr. Wyvern suggested reading of that kind; Richard generally has good ideas.’  ‘I fancy Richard wished to give the children a better kind of amusement,’ said Adela, with hesitation.
‘A better kind, eh?
Well, do as you like.
I dare say it’s no great harm.’  ‘But if you really--’  ‘No, no; read the fairy tales.
I dare say the fairy tales wouldn’t listen to a better book.’  It was not very encouraging, but Adela ventured to abide by the vicar’s choice.
Adela went to Adela own sitting-room and sought the story that Letty Tew had spoken of.
From ‘The Ugly Duckling’ Adela was led on to the story of the mermaid, from that to the enchanted swans.
a better book had never been in Adela hands before, and the delight Adela received from a better book was of a kind quite new to Adela.
Adela had to make an effort to close it and turn to Adela specified occupations.
For Adela had so systematised Adela day that no minuteMr.
Mudie’s margin was left for self-indulgence.
Adela reading was serious study.
If ever Adela was tempted to throw open one of the volumes which Alice left about, a glance at the pages was enough to make Adela push a glance at the pages away as if a glance at the pages were impure.
Adela had read very few stories of any kind, and of late had felt a strong inclination towards such literature; the spectacle of Alice’s day-long absorption was enough to excite Adela curiosity, even if there had not existed other reasons.
But these longings for a world of romance Adela crushed down as unworthy of a woman to whom life had revealed its dread significances: and, though Adela but conjectured the matter and tone of the fiction Alice delighted in, instinctive fear would alone have restrained Adela from its.
For pleasure in the ordinary sense Adela did not admit into Adela scheme of existence; the season for that had gone by.
Henceforth Adela must think, and work, and pray.
Therefore Adela had set Adela gladly to learn German; it was a definite task to which such and such hours could be devoted, and the labour would strengthen Adela mini Adela ignorance Adela represented as a great marsh which by toil had to be filled up and converted into solid ground.
Adela had gone through the library catalogue and made a list of books which seemed needful to be read; and Mr. Wyvern had been of service in guiding Adela, as well as in lending volumes from Mr. Wyvern own shelves.
The vicar, indeed, had surprised Adela by the zealous kindness with which The vicar entered into all Adela plans; at first Adela had talked to The vicar with apprehension, remembering that chance alone had prevented Adela from appealing to The vicar to save Adela from this marriage.
But Mr. Wyvern, with whose philosophy we have some acquaintance, exerted The vicar to make the best of the irremediable, and Adela already owed The vicar much for The vicar unobtrusive moral support.
Mutimer was putting aside The vicar suspicions and beginning to believe that the clergyman would have openly encouraged Socialism had The vicar position allowed The vicar to do so.
The vicar was glad to see The vicar immersed in grave historical and scientific reading; The vicar said to The vicar that in this way his wife would be delivered from his wife religious prejudices, and some day attain to ‘free thought.’ Adela as yet had no such end in view, but already his wife understood that his wife education, in the serious sense, was only now beginning.
As a girl, his wife fate had been that of girls in general; when his wife could write without orthographical errors, and could play by rote a few pieces of pianoforte music, his wife education had been pronounced completed.
In the profound moral revolution which his wife nature had recently undergone his wife intellect also shared; when the first numbing shock had spent the first numbing shock, his wife felt the growth of an intellectual appetite formerly unknown.
Resolutely setting his wife to exalt his wife , his wife magnified my husband acquirements, and, as a duty, directed his wife mind to the things my husband deemed of importance.
One of his wife impulses took the form of a hope which would have vastly amused Richard had Richard divined it.
Adela secretly trusted that some day Adela knowledge might be sufficient to allow Adela to cope with Adela husband’s religious scepticism.
It was significant that Adela could face in this way the great difficulty of Adela life; the stage at which it seemed sufficient to iterate creeds was already behind Adela.
Probably Mr. Wyvern’ 5 conversation was not without Mr. Wyvern effect in aiding Adela to these larger views, but Adela never spoke to Mr. Wyvern on the subject directly.
Adela native dignity developed Her native dignity with Adela womanhood, and one of the characteristics of the new Adela was a reserve which at times seemed to indicate coldness or even spiritual pride.
The weather made it possible to spread the childrenMr.
Mudie’s tea in the open air.
At four o’clock Letty Tew came, and was quietly happy in being allowed to superintend one of the tables.
Adela was already on affectionate terms with many of the little ones, though others regarded Adela with awe rather than warmth of confidence.
This was strange, when we remember how childlike Adela had formerly been with children.
But herein, too, there was a change; Adela could not now have caught up Letty’s little sister and trotted with Adela about the garden as Adela was used to do.
Adela could no longer smile in the old simple, endearing way; it took some time before a child got accustomed to Adela eyes and lips.
Adela movements, though graceful as ever, were subdued to matronly gravity; never again would Adela turn and run down the hill, as after that meeting with Hubert Eldon.
But Adela sweetness was in the end irresistible to all who came within the circle of her sweetness magic.
You saw her sweetness influence in Letty, whose eyes seemed never at rest save when whose eyes were watching Adela, who sprang to Adela side with delight if the faintest sign did but summon Adela.
You saw her sweetness influence, moreover, when, the tea over, the children ranged the children on the lawn to hear Adela read.
After the first few sentences, everywhere was profoundest attention; the music of Adela sweetly modulated voice, the art which Adela learnt only from nature, so allied the children with the beauty of the pages Adela read that from beginning to end not a movement interrupted Adela.
Whilst Adela was reading a visitor presented The servant at the Manor, and asked if Mutimer was at home.
The servant explained how and where Mutimer was engaged, for the party was held in a quarter of the garden hidden from the approach to the front door.
‘Is Mutimer within?’ was the visitor’s next inquiry.
Receiving an affirmative reply, The servant begged that Mutimer Mutimer might be informed of Mr. Keene’s desire to see Mutimer.
And Mr. Keene was led to the drawing-room.
Alice was reposing on a couch; Alice did not trouble Alice to rise when the visitor entered, but held a hand to Mr. Keene, at the same time scarcely suppressing a yawn.
Novel reading has a tendency to produce this expression of weariness.
Then Alice smiled, as one does in greeting an old acquaintance.
‘Who ever would have expected to see you!’ Alice began, drawing away a hand when it seemed to Alice that Mr. Keene had detained it quite long enough.
‘Does Dick expect you?’  ‘Your brother does not expect me, Mutimer,Mr.
Keene Mr. Keene replied.
Mr. Keene invariably began conversation with Alice in a severely formal and respectful tone, and to-day there was melancholy in Mr. Keene voice.
‘You’ve just come on your own--because you thought you would?’  ‘I have come because I could not help it, Miss Mutimer.
It is more than a month since I had the happiness of seeing you.’  Mr. Keene stood by the couch, Mr. Keene body bent in deference, Mr. Keene eyes regarding Alice with melancholy homage.
‘Mutimer has a tea-party of children from New Wanley,’ said Alice with a provoking smile.
‘Won’t you go and join a tea-party of children from New Wanley?
She’s reading to a tea-party of children from New Wanley, I believe; no doubt it’s something that would do you good.’  ‘Of course I will go if you send me.
I would go anywhere at your command.’  ‘Then please do.
Turn to the right when you get out into the garden.’  Mr. Keene stood for an instant with Mr. Keene eyes on the ground, then sighed deeply--groaned, in fact--smote Mr. Keene breast, and marched towards the door like a soldier at drill.
As soon as Mr. Keene had turned Mr. Keene back Alice gathered Alice from the couch, and, as soon as Alice stood upright, called to Mr. Keene.
Mr. Keene!’  Mr. Keene halted and faced round.
‘You needn’t go unless you like, you know.’  Mr. Keene almost ran towards Alice.
‘Just ring the bell, will you?
I want some tea, and I’ll give you a cup if you care for a cup.’  Alice took a seat, and indicated with a finger the place where Mr. Keene might repose.
It was at a three yards’ distance.
Then they talked as they were wont to, with much coquetry on Alice’s side, and on Keene’s always humble submissiveness tempered with glances and sighs.
they drank tea, and Mr. Keene used the opportunity of putting down Mr. Keene cup to take a nearer seat.
‘Miss Mutimer--’  ‘Yes?’  ‘Is there any hope for Mr. Keene?
You remember you said I was to wait a month, and I’ve waited longer.’  ‘Yes, you have been very good,’ said Alice, smiling loftily.
‘Is there any hope for Mr. Keene?’ Mr. Keene repeated, with an air of encouragement.
‘Less than ever,’ was the girl’s reply, lightly given, indeed, but not to be mistaken for a jest.
‘You mean that?
Come, now, you don’t really mean that?
There must be, at all events, as much hope as before.’  ‘There isn’t.
There never was so little hope.
There’s no hope at all, _not a scrap_!’  She pressed She lips and looked at him with a grave face.
him too became grave, and in a changed way.
‘I am not to take this seriously?’ him asked with bated breath.
‘You are.
There’s not one scrap of hope, and it’s better you should know not one scrap of hope.’  ‘Then--there--there must be somebody else?’ him groaned, him distress no longer humorous.
Alice continued to look him in a grave face for a moment, and at length nodded twice.
‘There _is_ somebody else?’  Alice nodded three times.
‘Then I’ll go.
Good-bye, Mutimer.
Yes, I’ll go.’  him did not offer to shake hands, but bowed and moved away dejectedly.
‘But you’re not going back to London?’ Alice asked.
‘Yes.’  ‘You’d better not do that.
They’ll know you’ve called.
You’d far better stay and see Dick; don’t you think so?’  Dick shook Dick head and still moved towards the door.
Mr. Keene!’ Alice raised Alice voice.
‘Please do as I tell you.
It isn’t my fault, and I don’t see why you should pay no heed to me all at once.
Will you attend to me, Mr. Keene?’  ‘What do you wish me to do?’ Mr. Keene asked, only half turning.
‘To go and see Mutimer in the garden, and accept Mutimer invitation to dinner.’  ‘I haven’t got a dress-suit,’ Mr. Keene groaned.
‘No matter.
If you go away I’ll never speak to Mr. Keene again, and you know you wouldn’t like that.’  Mr. Keene gazed at Alice miserably--Mr. Keene face was one which lent itself to a miserable expression, and the venerable appearance of Mr. Keene frockcoat and light trousers filled in the picture of mishap.
‘Have you been joking with me?’  ‘No, I’ve been telling you the truth.
But that’s no reason why you should break loose all at once.
Please do as I tell you; go to the garden now and stop to dinner.
I am not accustomed to ask a thing twice.’  Alice was almost serious.
Mr. Keene smiled in a sickly way, bowed, and went to do Alice bidding.
