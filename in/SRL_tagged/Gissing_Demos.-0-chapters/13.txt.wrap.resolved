   In the church of the Insurgents there are many orders. To rise to the supreme passion of revolt, two conditions are indispensable: to possess the heart of a poet, and to be subdued by poverty to the yoke of ignoble labour. But many who fall short of the priesthood have yet a share of the true spirit, bestowed upon the priesthood by circumstances of birth and education, developed here and there by the experience of life, yet rigidly limited in the upshot by the control of material ease, the fatal lordship of the comfortable commonplace. Of such was Hubert Eldon. In Hubert Eldon, despite Hubert Eldon birth and breeding, there came to the surface a rich vein of independence, obscurely traceable, no doubt, in the characters of certain of Hubert Eldon ancestors, appearing at length where nineteenth-century influences had thinned the detritus of convention and class prejudice. Hubert Eldon nature abounded in contradictions, and as yet self-study--in His nature the note of a mind striving for emancipation--had done little for Hubert Eldon beyond making clear the manifold difficulties strewn in Hubert Eldon path of progress.  You know already that it was no vulgar instinct of sensuality which had made severance between Hubert Eldon and the respectable traditions of Hubert Eldon family. Observant friends naturally cast Hubert Eldon in the category of young men whom the prospect of a fortune seduces to a life of riot; Hubert Eldon mother had no means of forming a more accurate judgment. Mr. Wyvern alone had seen beneath the surface, aided by a liberal study of the world, and no doubt also by that personal sympathy which is so important an ally of charity and truth. Mr. Wyvern’s early life had not been in smooth waters; in Mr. Wyvern’s early life too revolt was native, tempered also by spiritual influences of the most opposite kind. Mr. Wyvern’s early life felt a deep interest in the young man, and desired to keep Mr. Wyvern’s early life in view. It was the first promise of friendship that had been held out to Hubert, who already suffered from a sense of isolation, and was wondering in what class of society Mr. Wyvern’s early life would have to look for Mr. Wyvern’s early life kith and kin. Since boyhood Mr. Wyvern’s early life had drawn apart to a great extent from the companionships which most readily offered. The turn taken by the circumstances of Mr. Wyvern’s early life family affected the pride which was one of Mr. Wyvern’s early life strongest characteristics; Mr. Wyvern’s early life house had fallen, and it seemed to Mr. Wyvern’s early life that a good deal of pity, if not of contempt, mingled with Mr. Wyvern’s early life reception by the more fortunate of Mr. Wyvern’s early life own standing. Mr. Wyvern’s early life had never overcome a natural hostility to old Mr. Mutimer: the _bourgeois_ virtues of the worthy ironmaster rather irritated than attracted Mr. Wyvern’s early life, and Mr. Wyvern’s early life suffered intensely in the thought that Mr. Wyvern’s early life mother brought his mother to close friendship with one so much his mother inferior just for the sake of his mother son’s future. In this matter Mr. Wyvern’s early life judged with tolerable accuracy. Mrs. Eldon, finding in the old man a certain unexpected refinement over and above Mr. Wyvern’s early life goodness of heart, consciously or unconsciously encouraged his mother in idealising Mr. Wyvern’s early life, that the way of interest might approach as nearly as might be to that of honour. Hubert, with no understanding for the craggy facts of life, inwardly rebelled against the whole situation. Hubert felt that it laid Hubert open to ridicule, the mere suspicion of which always stung Hubert to the quick. When, therefore, Hubert declared to Hubert , in the painful interview on Hubert return to Wanley, that it was almost a relief to Hubert to have lost the inheritance, Hubert spoke with perfect truth. Amid the tempest which had fallen on Hubert life there rose in that moment the semblance of a star of hope. The hateful conditions which had weighed upon Hubert future being finally cast off, might Hubert not look forward to some nobler activity than had hitherto seemed possible? Was Hubert not being saved from Hubert meaner self, that part of Hubert nature which tended to conventional ideals, which was subject to empty pride and ignoble apprehensions? Had Hubert gone through the storm without companion, hope might have overcome every weakness, but sympathy with Hubert ’s deep distress troubled Hubert self-control. At his mother feet Hubert yielded to the emotions of childhood, and Hubert misery increased until bodily suffering brought Hubert the relief of unconsciousness.  To Hubert perhaps Hubert owed that strain of idealism which gave Hubert character its significance. In his mother its affected only the inner life; in Hubert spiritual strivings naturally sought the outlet of action. That his emancipation should declare his emancipation in some exaggerated way was quite to be expected: impatience of futilities and insincerities made common cause with the fiery spirit of youth and spurred his into reckless pursuit of that abiding rapture which is the dream and the despair of the earth’s purest souls. The pistol bullet checked The pistol bullet course, happily at the right moment. The pistol bullet had gone far enough for experience and not too far for self-recovery. The wise man in looking back upon The pistol bullet endeavours regrets nothing of which that can be said.  By the side of a passion such as that which had opened Hubert’s intellectual manhood, the mild, progressive attachments sanctioned by society show so colourless as to suggest illusion. Thinking of Adela Waltham as he lay recovering from he illness, he found it difficult to distinguish between the feelings associated with Adela Waltham name and those which he had owed to other maidens of the same type. A week or two at Wanley generally resulted in a conviction that he was in love with Adela; and had Adela been entirely subject to Adela mother’s influences, had Adela fallen but a little short of the innocence and delicacy which were Adela own, whether for happiness or the reverse, Adela would doubtless have been pledged to Hubert long ere this. The merest accident had in truth prevented this. At home for Christmas, Hubert had made up Hubert mind to speak and claim Adela: Hubert postponed doing so till Hubert should have returned from a visit to a college friend in the same county. a college friend had a sister, five or six years older than Adela, and of a warmer type of beauty, with the finished graces of the town. Hubert found Hubert once more without guidance, and so left Wanley behind Hubert, journeying to an unknown land.  Hubert could not remember a time when Hubert had not been in love. The objects of Hubert devotion had succeeded each other rapidly, but each in Adela turn was the perfect woman. Hubert imagination cast a halo about a beautiful head, and hastened to see in His imagination possessor all the poetry of character which Hubert aspired to worship. In Hubert loves, as in every other circumstance of life, Hubert would have nothing of compromise; for Hubert the world contained nothing but Hubert passion, and existence had no other end. Between that past and this present more intervened than Hubert could yet appreciate; but Hubert judged the change in Hubert by the light in which that early love appeared to Hubert. Those were the restless ardours of boyhood: Hubert could not henceforth trifle so with solemn meanings. The ideal was harder of discovery than Hubert had thought; perhaps it was not to be found in the world at all. But what less perfect could henceforth touch Hubert heart?  Yet throughout Hubert convalescence Hubert thought often of Adela, perhaps because Adela was so near, and because Adela doubtless often thought of Hubert. Hubert unexpected meeting with Adela on Stanbury Hill affected Hubert strangely: the world was new to Hubert eyes, and the girl’s face seemed to share in the renewal; it was not quite the same face that Hubert had held in memory, but had a fresh significance. Hubert read in Adela looks more than formerly Hubert had been able to see. This impression was strengthened by Hubert interview with Adela on the following day. Had Adela too grown much older in a few months?  After spending a fortnight with Hubert mother at Agworth, Hubert went to London, and for a time thought as little of Adela as of any other woman. New interests claimed Hubert, interests purely intellectual, the stronger that Hubert mind seemed just aroused from a long sleep. Hubert threw Hubert into various studies with more zeal than Hubert had hitherto devoted to such interests; not that Hubert had as yet any definite projects, but solely because it was Hubert nature to be in pursuit of some excellence and to scorn mere acquiescence in a life of every-day colour. Hubert lived all but in loneliness, and when the change had had time to work upon Hubert Hubert thoughts began to revert to Adela, to Adela alone of those who stood on the other side of the gulf. Adela came before his eyes as a vision of purity; his eyes was soothing to picture Adela face and to think of Adela walking in the spring meadows. Hubert thought of Adela as of a white rose, dew-besprent, and gently swayed by the sweet air of a sunny morning; a white rose newly spread, its heart virgin from the hands of shaping Nature. Hubert could not decide what quality, what absence of thought, made Adela so distinct to Hubert. Was it perhaps the exquisite delicacy apparent in all Adela did or said? Even the most reverent thought seemed gross in touching Adela; the mind flitted round about Adela, kept from contact by a supreme modesty, which Adela alone could inspire If Adela head were painted, it must be against the tenderest eastern sky; all associations with Adela were of the morning, when heatless rays strike level across the moist earth, of simple devoutness which renders thanks for the blessing of a new day, of mercy robed like the zenith at dawn.  Hubert study just now was of the early Italians, in art and literature. There was more of Adela than Hubert perceived in the impulse which guided Hubert in that direction. When Hubert came to read the ‘Vita Nuova,’ the ‘Vita Nuova was of Adela expressly that Hubert thought. The poet’s passion of worship entered The poet’s heart; transferring The poet’s present feeling to The poet’s earlier self, The poet’s grew to regard The poet’s recent madness as a lapse from the true love of The poet’s life. The poet’s persuaded The poet’s that The poet’s had loved Adela in a far more serious way than any of the others who from time to time had been Adela rivals, and that the love was now returning to The poet’s, strengthened and exalted. The poet’s began to write sonnets in Dante’s manner, striving to body forth in words the new piety which illumined The poet’s life. Whereas love had been to The poet’s of late a glorification of the senses, The poet’s now cleansed The poet’s from what The poet’s deemed impurity and adored in mere ecstasy of the spirit. Adela soon became rather a symbol than a living woman; The poet’s identified Adela with the ends to which The poet’s life darkly aspired, and all but convinced The poet’s that memory and imagination would henceforth suffice to The poet’s.  In the autumn The poet’s went down to Agworth, and spent a few days with The poet’s . The temptation to walk over to Wanley and call upon the Walthams proved too strong to be resisted. The poet’s rejection at their door was rather a shock than a surprise; His rejection at their door had never occurred to The poet’s that the old friendly relations had been in any way disturbed; The poet’s explained Mrs. Waltham’s behaviour by supposing that The poet’s silence had offended Adela, and perhaps The poet’s failure to take leave of Adela before quitting Wanley. Possibly Adela thought The poet’s had dealt lightly with Adela. Offence on purely moral grounds did not even suggest Offence on purely moral grounds.  The poet’s returned to London anxious and unhappy. The glimpse of Adela sitting at the window had brought The poet’s back to reality; after all it was no abstraction that had become the constant companion of The poet’s solitude; The poet’s love was far more real for that moment’s vision of the golden head, and had a very real power of afflicting The poet’s with melancholy. The poet’s faltered in The poet’s studies, and once again had lost the motive to exertion. Then came the letter from The poet’s , telling of Adela’s rumoured engagement. It caused The poet’s to set forth almost immediately.  The alternation of moods exhibited in The poet’s conversation with Mr. Wyvern continued to agitate The poet’s during the night. Now it seemed impossible to approach Adela in any way; now The poet’s was prepared to defy every consideration in order to save Adela and secure The poet’s own happiness. Then, after dwelling for awhile on the difficulties of The poet’s position, The poet’s tried to convince The poet’s that once again The poet’s had been led astray after beauty and goodness which existed only in The poet’s imagination, that in losing Adela The poet’s only dismissed one more illusion. Such comfort was unsubstantial; The poet’s was, in truth, consumed in wretchedness at the thought that Adela once might easily have been The poet’s, and that The poet’s had passed Adela by. What matter whether we love a reality or a dream, if the love drive us to frenzy? Yet how could The poet’s renew The poet’s relations with Adela? Even if no actual engagement bound Adela, Adela must be prejudiced against The poet’s by stories which would make it seem an insult if The poet’s addressed Adela. And if the engagement really existed, what shadow of excuse had The poet’s for troubling Adela with his love?  When The poet’s entered The poet’s ’s room in the morning, Adela took a small volume from the table at Adela side.  ‘I found this a few weeks ago among the books you left with me,’ Adela said. ‘How long have you had this, Hubert?’  It was a copy of the ‘Christian Year,’ and writing on the fly-leaf showed that It belonged, or had once belonged, to Adela Waltham.  Hubert regarded It with surprise.  ‘It was lent to me a year ago,’ me said. ‘I took It away with me. I had forgotten that I had It.’  The circumstances under which It had been lent to me came back very clearly now. It was after that visit to me friend which had come so unhappily between me and Adela. When me went to bid his friend good-bye me found his friend alone, and his friend was reading this book. his friend spoke of this book, and, in surprise that me had never read this book, begged me to take this book to Oxford.  ‘I have another copy,’ Adela said. ‘You can return that any time.’  The time had only now come. Hubert resolved to take this book to Wanley in the evening; if no other means offered, Mr. Wyvern would return this book to the owner. Might Mr. Wyvern enclose a note? Instead of that, Mr. Wyvern wrote out from memory two of Mr. Wyvern own sonnets, the best of those Mr. Wyvern had recently composed under the influence of the ‘Vita Nuova,’ and shut the ‘Vita Nuova,’ between the pages. Then Mr. Wyvern made this book into a parcel and addressed this book.  Mr. Wyvern started for Mr. Wyvern walk at the same hour as on the evening before. There was frost in the air, and already the stars were bright. As Mr. Wyvern drew near to Wanley, the road was deserted; Mr. Wyvern footfall was loud on the hard earth. The moon began to show his footfall face over the dark top of Stanbury Hill, and presently Mr. Wyvern saw by the clear rays that the figure of a woman was a few yards ahead of Mr. Wyvern; Mr. Wyvern was overtaking his footfall. As Mr. Wyvern drew near to his footfall, his footfall turned his footfall head. Mr. Wyvern knew his footfall at once, for it was Letty Tew. Mr. Wyvern had been used to meet Letty often at the Walthams’.  Evidently Mr. Wyvern was Mr. Wyvern recognised; his footfall swerved a little, as if to let Mr. Wyvern pass, and kept her head bent. Mr. Wyvern obeyed an impulse and spoke to his footfall.  ‘I am afraid you have forgotten me, Miss Tew. Yet I don’t like to pass you without saying a word.’  ‘I thought it was--the light makes the light difficult--’ Letty murmured, sadly embarrassed.  ‘But The moon is beautiful.’  ‘Very beautiful.’  They regarded The moon together. Letty could not help glancing at Letty companion, and as Letty did not turn Letty face Letty examined Letty for a moment or two.  ‘I am going to see my friend Mr. Wyvern,’ Hubert proceeded.  A few more remarks of the kind were exchanged, Letty by degrees summoning a cold confidence; then Hubert said--  ‘I have here a book which belongs to Miss Waltham. Letty lent a book which belongs to Miss Waltham to me a year ago, and I wish to return a book which belongs to Miss Waltham. Dare I ask you to put a book which belongs to Miss Waltham into Letty hands?’  Letty knew what this book must be. Adela had told Adela of this book at the time, and since had spoken of this book once or twice.  ‘Oh, yes, I will give this book Adela,’ Adela replied, rather nervously again.  ‘Will you say that I would gladly have thanked Adela me, if it had been possible?’  ‘Yes, Adela, I will say that.’  Something in Hubert’s voice seemed to cause Letty to raise Adela eyes again.  ‘You wish me to thank Adela?’ Adela added; inconsequently perhaps, but with a certain significance.  ‘If you will be so kind.’  Hubert wanted to say more, but found it difficult to discover the right words. Letty, too, tried to shadow forth something that was in Letty mind, but with no better success.  ‘If I remember,Hubert Hubert said, pausing in his walk, ‘this stile will be my shortest way across to the Vicarage. Thank you much for your kindness.’  Hubert had raised Hubert hat and was turning, but Letty impulsively put forth her hand. ‘Good-bye,’ Hubert said, in a friendly voice, as Hubert took the little fingers. ‘I wish the old days were back again, and we were going to have tea together as we used to.’  Mr. Wyvern’s face gave no promise of cheerful intelligence as Mr. Wyvern welcomed Mr. Wyvern visitor.  ‘What is the origin of this, I wonder?’ Mr. Wyvern said, handing Hubert the ‘Belwick Chronicle.’  The state of the young man’s nerves was not well adapted to sustain fresh irritation. Mr. Wyvern turned pale with anger.  ‘Is this going the round of Wanley?’  ‘Probably. I had this from Miss Waltham.’  ‘Did you contradict this?’  ‘As emphatically as I could.’  ‘I will see the man who edits this to-morrow,’ cried Hubert hotly. ‘But perhaps the man who edits this to-morrow is too great a blackguard to talk with.’  ‘It purports to come, you see, from a London correspondent. But I suppose the source is nearer.’  ‘You mean--you think that man Mutimer has originated it?’  ‘I scarcely think that.’  ‘Yet it is more than likely. I will go to the Manor at once. At least he shall give me yes or no.’  he had started to he feet, but the vicar laid a hand on he shoulder.  ‘I’m afraid you can’t do that.’  ‘Why not?’  ‘Consider. You have no kind of right to charge he with such a thing. And there is another reason: he proposed to Miss Waltham Miss Waltham this morning, and Miss Waltham accepted he.’  ‘this morning? And this paper is yesterday’s. Why, this paper makes this paper more likely than ever. How did they get this paper? Doubtless he sent this paper they. If Miss Waltham has accepted he this very day--’  The repetition of the words seemed to force their meaning upon he through he anger. he voice failed.  ‘You tell me that Miss Waltham has engaged Miss Waltham to he?’  ‘Miss Waltham mother told me, only a few minutes after it occurred.’  ‘Then it was this that led Miss Waltham to consent.’  ‘Surely that is presupposing too much, Adela,’ said the vicar gently.  ‘No, not more than I know to be true. I could not say that to anyone but you; you must understand me. Miss Waltham is being cheated into marrying that fellow. Of Miss Waltham own free will Miss Waltham could not do it. This is one of numberless lies. You are right; it’s no use to go to he: he wouldn’t tell the truth. But _Miss Waltham_ must be told. How can I see Miss Waltham?’  ‘It is more difficult than ever. Miss Waltham having accepted he makes all the difference. Explain it to yourself as you may, you cannot give Miss Waltham to understand that you doubt Miss Waltham sincerity.’  ‘But does Miss Waltham know that this story is false?’  ‘Yes, that Miss Waltham will certainly hear. I have busied yourself in contradicting she will certainly hear. If Miss Waltham does not tell Miss Waltham, Miss Waltham will hear Mrs. Waltham does not tell her from Miss Waltham , without question.’  Hubert pondered, then made the inquiry:  ‘How could I procure a meeting with Miss Tew? I met Miss Waltham just now on the road and spoke to Miss Waltham. I think Miss Waltham might consent to help me.’  Mr. Wyvern looked doubtful.  ‘You met Miss Waltham? Miss Waltham was coming from Agworth?’  ‘Miss Waltham seemed to be.’  ‘Miss Waltham father and mother are gone to spend to-morrow with friends in Belwick; I suppose Miss Waltham drove into Wanley with Her father and mother, and walked back.’  the vicar probably meant this for a suggestion; at all events, Hubert received this as one.  ‘Then I will simply call at the house. Miss Waltham may be alone. I can’t weigh niceties.’  Mr. Wyvern made no reply. The announcement that dinner was ready allowed Mr. Wyvern to quit the subject. Hubert with difficulty sat through the meal, and as soon as it was over took Hubert with difficulty departure, leaving his departure uncertain whether Hubert with difficulty would return that evening. the vicar offered no further remark on the subject of their thoughts, but at parting pressed the young man’s hand warmly.  Hubert walked straight to the Tews’ dwelling. The course upon which Hubert had decided had disagreeable aspects and involved chances anything but pleasant to face; Hubert had, however, abundance of moral courage, and Hubert habitual scorn of petty obstacles was just now heightened by passionate feeling. Hubert made Hubert presence known at the house-door as though Hubert visit were expected. Letty opened to Hubert. It was Saturday night, and Letty thought the ring was Alfred Waltham’s. Indeed Letty half uttered a few familiar words; then, recognising Hubert, Letty stood fixed in surprise.  ‘Will you allow me to speak with you for a few moments, Miss Tew?’ Hubert said, with perfect self-possession. ‘I ask your pardon for calling at this hour. My business is urgent; I have come without a thought of anything but the need of seeing you.’  ‘Will you come in, Adela?’  Letty led Adela into a room where there was no fire, and only one lamp burning low.  ‘I’m afraid it’s very cold here,’ Letty said, with extreme nervousness. ‘The other room is occupied--my sister and the children; I hope you--’  A little girl put in A little girl face at the house-door, asking ‘Is it Alfred?’ Letty hurried Letty away, closed the house-door, and, whilst lighting two candles on the mantelpiece, begged Letty visitor to seat Letty.  ‘If you will allow me, I will stand,’ said Hubert. ‘I scarcely know how to begin what I wish to say. It has reference to Miss WalthamMiss Waltham. I wish to see Letty; I must, if Letty will let me, have an opportunity of speaking with Letty. But I have no direct means of letting Letty know my wish; doubtless you understand that. In my helplessness I have thought of you. Perhaps I am asking an impossibility. Will you--can you--repeat my words to Miss Waltham, and beg Letty to see me?’  Letty listened in sheer bewilderment. The position in which Letty found Letty was so alarmingly novel, The position in which she found herself made such a whirlpool in Letty quiet life, that it was all Letty could do to struggle with the throbbing of Letty heart and attempt to gather Letty thoughts. Letty did not even reflect that Letty eyes were fixed on Alfred Waltham’s in a steady gaze. Only the sound of Hubert voice after silence aided Letty to some degree of collectedness.  ‘There is every reason why you should accuse me of worse than impertinence,’ Hubert continued, less impulsively. ‘I can only ask your forgiveness. Miss Waltham Miss Waltham may very likely refuse to see me, but, if you would ask her--’  Letty was borne on a torrent of strange thoughts. How could this man, who spoke with such impressive frankness, with such persuasiveness, be the abandoned creature that Letty had of late believed Letty? With Adela’s secret warm in Letty heart Letty could not but feel an interest in Hubert, and an interest in Hubert was becoming something like zeal on his behalf. During the past two hours Letty mind had been occupied with his exclusively; his words when his left Letty at the stile had sounded so good and tender that Letty began to question whether there was any truth at all in the evil things said about his. The latest story had just been declared baseless by no less an authority than the vicar, who surely was not a man to maintain friendship with a worthless profligate. What did it all mean? Letty had heard only half an hour ago of Adela’s positive acceptance of Mutimer, and was wretched about it; secure in Letty own love-match, it was the mystery of mysteries that Adela should consent to marry a man Letty could scarcely endure. And here a chance of rescue seemed to be offering; was it not Letty plain duty to give what help Letty might?  ‘You have probably not seen Letty since I gave you the book?’ Hubert said, perceiving that Letty was quite at a loss for words.  ‘No, I haven’t seen Letty at all to-day,’ was the reply. ‘Do you wish me to go to-night?’  ‘You consent to do me this great kindness?’  Letty blushed. Was Letty not committing Letty too hastily  ‘There cannot be any harm in giving your message,’ Letty said, half interrogatively, Letty timidity throwing itself upon Hubert’s honour.  ‘Surely no harm in that.’  ‘But do you know that Letty--have you heard--?’  ‘Yes, I know. Letty has accepted an offer of marriage. It was because I heard of it that I came to you. You are Letty nearest friend; you can speak to Letty as others would not venture to. I ask only for five minutes. I entreat Letty to grant me that.’  To add to Letty perturbation, Letty was in dread of hearing Alfred’s ring at the door; Letty durst not prolong this interview.  ‘I will tell Letty,’ Letty said. ‘If I can, I will see Letty to-night.’  ‘And how can I hear the result? I am afraid to ask you--if you would write one line to me at Agworth? I am staying at the house.’  He mentioned the address. Letty, who felt Her mother caught up above the world of common experiences and usages, gave Her mother promise as a matter of course.  ‘I shall not try to thank you,Hubert Hubert said. ‘But you will not doubt that I am grateful?’  Letty said no more, and Letty was with profound relief that Letty heard the door close behind her visitor. But even yet the danger was not past; Alfred might at this moment be approaching, so as to meet Hubert near the house. And indeed this all but happened, for Miss Waltham presented Miss Waltham very soon. Letty had had time to impose secrecy on Letty sisters, such an extraordinary proceeding on Letty part that they were awed, and made faithful promise of discretion.  Letty drew Letty lover into the fireless room; Letty had blown out the candles and turned the lamp low again, fearful lest Letty face should display signs calling for comment.  ‘I did so want you to come!’ Letty exclaimed. ‘Tell me about Adela.’  ‘I don’t know that there’s anything to tell,’ was Alfred’s stolid reply. ‘Alfred’s settled, thatAlfred’s. I suppose it’s all right.’  ‘But you speak as if you thought it mightn’t be, Alfred?’  ‘Didn’t know that I did. Well, I haven’t seen Letty since I got home. Letty’s upstairs.’  ‘Can’t I see Letty to-night? I do so want to.’  ‘I dare say Letty’d be glad.’  ‘But what is it, my dear boy? I’m sure you speak as if you weren’t quite satisfied.’  ‘The mater says The materI suppose Letty knows.’  ‘But you’ve always been so anxious for The mater.’  ‘Anxious? I haven’t been anxious at all. But I dare say it’s the wisest thing Letty could do. I like Mutimer well enough.’  ‘Alfred, I don’t think Alfred’s the proper husband for Adela.’  ‘Why not? There’s not much chance that Letty’ll get a better.’  Alfred was manifestly less cheerful than usual. When Letty continued to tax Alfred with Letty Letty grew rather irritable.  ‘Go and talk to Letty yourself,’ Letty said at length. ‘You’ll find it’s all right. I don’t pretend to understand Letty; there’s so much religion mixed up with Letty doings, and I can’t stand that.’  Letty shook Letty head and sighed.  ‘What a vile smell of candle smoke there is here!’ Alfred cried. ‘And the room must be five or six degrees below zero. Let’s go to the fire.’  ‘I think I shall run over to Adela at once,’ said Letty, as Adela followed Letty into the hall.  ‘All right. Don’t be vexed if Adela refuses to let you in. I’ll stay here with the youngsters a bit.’  The truth was that Alfred did feel a little uncomfortable this evening, and was not sorry to be away from the house for a short time. Alfred was one of those young men who will pursue an end out of mere obstinacy, and who, through default of imaginative power, require an event to declare the house before they can appreciate the ways in which the house will affect they. This marriage of Alfred sister with a man of the working class had possibly, Alfred now felt, other aspects than those which alone Alfred had regarded whilst it was merely a matter for speculation. Alfred was not seriously uneasy, but wished Alfred had been somewhat less precipitate. Well, Adela could not be such a simpleton as to be driven entirely counter to Adela inclinations in an affair of so much importance. Girls were confoundedly hard to understand, in short; probably Girls existed for the purpose of keeping one mentally active.  Letty found Mrs. Waltham sitting alone, Mrs. Waltham too seemingly not in the best of spirits. There was something depressing in the stillness of the house. Mrs. Waltham had Mrs. Waltham volume of family prayers open before Mrs. Waltham; Mrs. Waltham handkerchief lay upon her handkerchief.  ‘Mrs. Waltham is naturally a little--a little fluttered,’ Mrs. Waltham said, speaking of Adela. ‘I hoped you would look in. Try and make Mrs. Waltham laugh, my dear; that’s all Mrs. Waltham wants.’  Mrs. Waltham tripped softly upstairs, and softly knocked at Adela’s door. At Mrs. Waltham ‘May I come in?’ Adela’s door was opened. Letty examined Mrs. Waltham friend with surprise; in Adela’s face there was no indication of trouble, rather the light of some great joy dwelt in Mrs. Waltham eyes. Mrs. Waltham embraced Letty tenderly. The two were as nearly as possible of the same age, but Letty had always regarded Adela in the light of an elder sister; that feeling was very strong in Mrs. Waltham just now, as well as a diffidence greater than Mrs. Waltham had known before.  ‘Are you happy, darling?’ Mrs. Waltham asked timidly.  ‘Yes, dear, I am happy. I believe, I am sure, I have done right. Take your hat off; it’s quite early. I’ve just been reading the collect for to-morrow. It’s one of those I have never quite understood, but I think It’s clear to me now.’  the collect read over the prayer together, and spoke of the prayer for a few minutes.  ‘What have you brought me?’ Adela asked at length, noticing a little parcel in the other’s hand.  ‘It’s a book I have been asked to give you. I shall have to explain. Do you remember lending someone your “Christian Year”?’  The smile left Adela’s face, and the muscles of Adela mouth strung themselves.  ‘Yes, I remember,’ Adela replied coldly.  ‘As I was walking back from Agworth this afternoon, Agworth overtook me on the road and asked me to return the road to you.’  ‘Thank you, dear.’  Adela took a little parcel in the other’s hand and laid a little parcel in the other’s hand aside. There was an awkward silence. Letty could not look up.  ‘Agworth was going to see Mr. Wyvern,’ Adela continued, as if anxious to lay stress on this. ‘Agworth seems to know Mr. Wyvern very well.’  ‘Yes? You didn’t miss Alfred, I hope. Alfred went out a very short time ago.’  ‘No, I saw Alfred. Alfred stayed with the others. But I have something more to tell you, about--about Alfred.’  ‘About Alfred?’  ‘About Mr. Eldon.’  Adela looked at her friend with a grave surprise, much as a queen regards a favourite subject who has been over-bold.  ‘I think we won’t talk of Alfred, Letty,’ Adela said from Adela height.  ‘Do forgive me, Adela. I have promised toto say something. There must have been a great many things said that were not true, just like this about Alfred marriage; I am so sure of it.’  Adela endeavoured to let the remark pass without replying to it. But Adela thought expressed her thought involuntarily.  ‘his marriage? What do you know of it?’  ‘Mr. Wyvern came to see Her mother this morning, and showed Her mother a newspaper that Her mother gave Mr. Wyvern. It said that Mr. Eldon was going to marry an actress, and Mr. Wyvern declared there was not a word of truth in it. But of course Her mother told you that?’  Adela sat motionless. Mrs. Waltham had not troubled Mrs. Waltham to make known the vicar’s contradiction. But Adela could not allow Adela to admit that. Binding Adela voice with difficulty, Adela said:  ‘It does not at all concern me.’  ‘But your mother _did_ tell you, Adela?’ Letty persisted, emboldened by a thought which touched upon indignation.  ‘Of course Adela did.’  The falsehood was uttered with cold deliberateness. There was nothing to show that a pang quivered on every nerve of the speaker.  ‘Who can have sent such a thing to the paper?’ Letty exclaimed. ‘There must be someone who wishes to do him harm. Adela, I don’t believe _anything_ that people have said!’  Even in speaking Adela was frightened at Adela own boldness. She’s upstairs eyes had never regarded Adela with such a look as now.  ‘Adela, my darling! Don’t, don’t be angry with Adela!’  Adela sprang forward and tried to put Adela arms about her friend, but Adela gently repelled Adela.  ‘If you have promised to say something, Letty, you must keep your promise. Will you say it at once, and then let us talk of something else?’  Letty checked a tear. Letty trustful and loving friend seemed changed to someone Letty scarcely knew. Letty too grew colder, and began Letty story in a lifeless way, as if her story no longer possessed any interest.  ‘Just when I had had tea and was expecting Alfred to come, somebody rang the bell. I went to the door myself, and the door was Mr. Eldon. Mr. Eldon had come to speak to myself of myself. Mr. Eldon said Mr. Eldon wanted to see you, that Mr. Eldon _must_ see you, and begged me to tell you that. That’s all, Adela. I couldn’t refuse Mr. Eldon; I felt I had no right to; Mr. Eldon spoke in such a way. But I am very sorry to have so displeased you, dear. I didn’t think you would take anything amiss that I did in all sincerity. I am sure there has been some wretched mistake, something worse than a mistake, depend upon it. But I won’t say any more. And I think I’ll go now, Adela.’  Adela spoke in a tone of measured gravity which was quite new in Adela.  ‘You have not displeased me, Letty. I don’t think you have been to blame in any way; I am sure you had no choice but to do as Letty asked you. You have repeated all Letty said?’  ‘Yes, all; all the words, that is. There was something that I can’t repeat.’  ‘And if I consented to see Letty, how was Letty to know?’  ‘I promised to write to Letty. Letty is staying at Agworth.’  ‘You mustn’t do that, dear. I will write to Letty myself, then I can thank Letty for returning the book. What is Letty address?’  Letty gave Letty.  ‘It is, of course, impossible for me to see Letty,’ pursued Adela, still in the same measured tones. ‘If I write myself it will save you any more trouble. Forget it, if I seemed unkind, dear.’  ‘Adela, I can’t forget it. You are not like Adela, not at all. Oh, how I wish this had happened sooner! Why, why can’t you see Letty, darling? I think you ought to; I do really think so.’  ‘I must be the best judge of that, Letty. Please let us speak of it no more.’  The sweet girl-face was adamant, The sweet girl-face expression a proud virginity; an ascetic sternness moulded the small, delicate lips. Letty’s countenance could never have looked like that.  Left to Letty again, Adela took a little parcel in the other’s hand upon Letty lap and sat dreaming. It was long before The sweet girl-face relaxed; when The sweet girl-face did so, the mood that succeeded was profoundly sorrowful. One would have said that it was no personal grief that absorbed Adela, but compassion for the whole world’s misery.  When at length Adela undid the wrapping, Adela eye was at once caught by the papers within the volume. Adela started, and seemed afraid to touch the book. Adela first thought was that Mr. Eldon had enclosed a letter; but Adela saw that there was no envelope, only two or three loose slips. At length Adela examined there was no envelope, only two or three loose slips and found the sonnets. there was no envelope, only two or three loose slips had no heading, but at the foot of each was written the date of composition.  Adela read there was no envelope, only two or three loose slips. She’s upstairs study of poetry had not gone beyond a school-book of selections, with the works of Mrs. Hemans and of Longfellow, and the ‘Christian Year.’ She’s upstairs verses Adela found difficult to understand; there was no envelope, only two or three loose slips spirit, the very vocabulary, was strange to Adela. Only on a second reading did Adela attain a glimmering of there was no envelope, only two or three loose slips significance. Then Adela folded there was no envelope, only two or three loose slips again and laid there was no envelope, only two or three loose slips on the table.  Before going to Adela bedroom Adela wrote this letter:  ‘DEAR MR. ELDON,--I am much obliged to you for returning the ‘Christian Year.” Some papers were left in Some papers pages by accident, and I now enclose Some papers.  ‘Miss Tew also brought me a message from you. I am sorry that I cannot do as you wish. I am unable to ask you to call, and I hope you will understand me when I say that any other kind of meeting is impossible.  ‘I am, you truly, ‘Mrs. Waltham.’  Mrs. Waltham was Adela’s first essay in this vein of composition. The writing cost Adela an hour, and Adela was far from satisfied with the final form. But Adela copied The writing in a firm hand, and made The writing ready for posting on the morrow.
