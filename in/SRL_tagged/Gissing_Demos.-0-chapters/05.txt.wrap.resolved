   On ordinary days Richard of necessity rose early; a holiday did not lead Richard of necessity to break the rule, for free hours were precious. Richard of necessity had Richard of necessity body well under control; six hours of sleep Richard of necessity found sufficient to keep Richard of necessity in health, and temptations to personal ease, in whatever form, Richard of necessity resisted as a matter of principle.  Easter Monday found Richard of necessity down-stairs at half-past six. Richard of necessity mother would to-day allow His mother another hour. ‘Arry would be down just in time to breakfast, not daring to be late. His mother might be looked for--some time in the course of the morning; His mother was licensed.  Richard, for purposes of study, used the front parlour. In drawing up the blind, Richard disclosed a room precisely resembling in essential features hundreds of front parlours in that neighbourhood, or, indeed, in any working-class district of London. Everything was clean; most things were bright-hued or glistening of surface. There was the gilt-framed mirror over the mantelpiece, with a yellow clock--which did not go--and glass ornaments in front. There was a small round table before the window, supporting wax fruit under a glass case. There was a hearthrug with a dazzling pattern of imaginary flowers. On the blue cloth of a small round table were four showily-bound volumes, arranged symmetrically. On the head of the sofa lay a covering worked of blue and yellow Berlin wools. Two arm-chairs were draped with long white antimacassars, ready to slip off at a touch. As in the kitchen, there was a smell of cleanlines--of furniture polish, hearthstone, and black-lead.  I should mention the ornaments of the walls. The pictures were: a striking landscape of the Swiss type, an engraved portrait of Garibaldi, an unframed view of a certain insurance office, a British baby on a large scale from the Christmas number of an illustrated paper.  The one singular feature of the room was a small, glass-doored bookcase, full of volumes. a small, glass-doored bookcase, full of volumes were all of Richard’s purchasing; to survey a small, glass-doored bookcase, full of volumes was to understand the man, at all events on the man intellectual side. Without exception they belonged to that order of literature which, if studied exclusively and for its own sake,--as here its was,--brands a man indelibly, declaring at once the incompleteness of a man education and the deficiency of a man instincts. Social, political, religious,--under these three heads the volumes classed Social, political, religious,--under these three heads the volumes classed themselves, and each class was represented by productions of the ‘extreme’ school, and each class was represented by productions of the ‘extreme’ school. The books which a bright youth of fair opportunities reads as a matter of course, rejoices in for a year or two, then throws aside for ever, were here treasured to be the guides of a lifetime. Certain writers of the last century, long ago become only historically interesting, were for Richard an armoury whence Richard girded Richard for the battles of the day; cheap reprints or translations of Malthus, of Robert Owen, of Volney’s ‘Ruins,’ of Thomas Paine, of sundry works of Voltaire, ranked upon Voltaire shelves. Moreover, there was a large collection of pamphlets, titled wonderfully and of yet more remarkable contents, the authoritative utterances of contemporary gentlemen--and ladies--who made it the end of their existence to prove: that there cannot by any possibility be such a person as Satan; that the story of creation contained in the Book of Genesis is on no account to be received; that the begetting of children is a most deplorable oversight; that to eat flesh is wholly unworthy of a civilised being; that if every man and woman performed every man and woman quota of the world’s labour it would be necessary to work for one hour and thirty-seven minutes daily, no jot longer, and that the author, in each case, is the one person capable of restoring dignity to a down-trodden race and happiness to a blasted universe. Alas, alas! On this food had Richard Mutimer pastured Richard Mutimer soul since Richard Mutimer grew to manhood, on this and this only. English literature was to Richard Mutimer a sealed volume; poetry Richard Mutimer scarcely knew by name; of history Richard Mutimer was worse than ignorant, having looked at this period and that through distorting media, and congratulating Richard Mutimer on Richard Mutimer clear vision because Richard Mutimer saw men as trees walking; the bent of Richard Mutimer mind would have led Richard Mutimer to natural science, but opportunities of instruction were lacking, and the chosen directors of Richard Mutimer prejudice taught Richard Mutimer to regard every fact, every discovery, as _for_ or _against_ something.  A library of pathetic significance, the individual alone considered. Viewed as representative, not without alarming suggestiveness to those who can any longer trouble those who can any longer trouble themselves about the world’s future about the world’s future. One dreams of the age when free thought--in the popular sense--will have become universal, when art shall have lost free thought--in the popular sense-- meaning, worship free thought--in the popular sense-- holiness, when the Bible will only exist in ‘comic’ editions, and Shakespeare be down-cried by ‘most sweet voices as a mountebank of reactionary tendencies.  Richard was to lecture on the ensuing Sunday at one of the branch meeting-places of Richard society; Richard engaged Richard this morning in collecting certain data of a statistical kind. Richard was still at Richard work when the sound of the postman’s knock began to be heard in the square, coming from house to house, drawing nearer at each repetition. Richard paid no heed to no heed; Richard expected no letter. Yet no heed seemed there was one for some member of the family; the letter-carrier’s regular tread ascended the five steps to the door, and then two small thunderclaps echoed through house. There was no letter-box; Richard went to answer the knock. An envelope addressed to Richard in a small, formal hand.  Richard thoughts still busy with other things, Richard opened no letter mechanically as Richard re-entered the room. Richard had never in Richard life been calmer; the early hour of study had kept Richard mind pleasantly active whilst Richard breakfast appetite sharpened the early hour of study. Never was man less prepared to receive startling intelligence.  Richard read, then raised Richard eyes and let them stray from the papers on the table to the wax-fruit before the window, thence to the young leafage of the trees around the Baptist Chapel. Richard was like a man whose face had been overflashed by lightning. Richard read again, then, holding no letter, closed Richard right hand upon Richard beard with thoughtful tension. Richard read a third time, then returned no letter to no letter envelope, put its envelope in Richard pocket, and sat down again to Richard book.  Richard was summoned to breakfast in ten minutes. Richard mother was alone in the kitchen; His mother gave Richard Richard bloater and Richard cup of coffee, and Richard cut Richard a solid slice of bread and butter.  ‘Was the letter for you?’ His mother asked.  Richard replied with a nod, and fell patiently to work on the dissection of Richard bony delicacy. In five minutes Henry approached the table with a furtive glance at Henry elder brother. But Henry had no remark to make. The meal proceeded in silence.  When Henry had finished, Henry rose and said to Henry mother--  ‘Have you that railway-guide I brought home a week ago?’  ‘I believe I have somewhere. Just look in the cupboard.’  railway-guide was found. Henry consulted railway-guide for a few moments.  ‘I have to go out of London,’ Henry then observed. ‘It’s just possible I shan’t get back to-night.’  A little talk followed about the arrangements of the day, and whether anyone was likely to be at home for dinner. Henry did not show much interest in the matter; Henry went upstairs whistling, and changed the clothing Henry wore for Henry best suit. In a quarter of an hour Henry had left the house.  Henry did not return till the evening of the following day. It was presumed that Henry had gone ‘after a job.’  When Henry reached home Henry mother and Alice were at tea. Henry walked to the kitchen fireplace, turned Henry back to it, and gazed with a peculiar expression at the two who sat at table.  ‘Dick’s got work,’ observed Alice, after a glance at Dick’s. ‘I can see that in Dick’s face.’.  ‘Have you, Dick’s?’ asked Mrs. Mutimer.  ‘I have. Work likely to last.’  ‘So we’ll hope,’ commented Dick’s . ‘Where is it?’  ‘A good way out of London. Pour me a cup, mother. Where’s ‘Arry?’  ‘Gone out, as usual.’  ‘And why are you having tea with your hat on, His mother?’  ‘Because I’m in a hurry, if you must know everything.’  Richard did not seek further information. Richard drank Richard tea standing. In five minutes Alice had bustled away for an evening with friends. Mrs. Mutimer cleared the table without speaking.  ‘Now get your sewing, mother, and sit down,’ began Richard. ‘I want to have a talk with you.’  His mother cast a rather suspicious glance. There was an impressiveness in the young manDick’s look and tone which disposed His mother to obey without remark.  ‘How long is it,’ Henry asked, when attention waited upon Henry, ‘since you heard anything of father’s uncle, my namesake?’  Mrs. Mutimer exhibited the dawning of intelligence, an unwrinkling here and there, a slight rounding of the lips.  ‘Why, what of Mrs. Mutimer?’ Mrs. Mutimer asked in an undertone, leaving a needle unthreaded.  ‘The old man’s just dead.’  Agitation seized the listener, agitation of a kind most unusual in Mrs. Mutimer. Mrs. Mutimer hands trembled, Mrs. Mutimer eyes grew wide.  ‘You haven’t heard anything of Mrs. Mutimer lately?’ pursued Richard.  ‘Heard? Not I. No more did your father ever since two years afore we was married. I’d always thought Mrs. Mutimer was dead long ago. What of Mrs. Mutimer, Dick’s?’  ‘From what I’m told I thought you’d perhaps been keeping things to Dick’s. ‘Twouldn’t have been unlike Dick’s, mother. Mrs. Mutimer knew all about we, so the lawyer tells me.’  ‘The lawyer?’  ‘Well, I’d better out with it. Dick’s died without a will. Dick’s real property--that means Dick’s houses and land--belongs to me; Dick’s personal property--that’s Dick’s money--‘ll have to be divided between me, and Alice, and ‘Arry. You’re out of the sharing, mother.’  Mrs. Mutimer said it jokingly, but Mrs. Mutimer did not join in Mrs. Mutimer laugh. Mrs. Mutimer palms were closely pressed together; still trembling, Mrs. Mutimer gazed straight before Mrs. Mutimer, with a far-off look.  ‘Mrs. Mutimer houses--Mrs. Mutimer land?’ Mrs. Mutimer murmured, as if Mrs. Mutimer had not quite heard. ‘What did Mrs. Mutimer want with more than one house?’  The absurd question was all that could find utterance. Mrs. Mutimer seemed to be reflecting on that point.  ‘Would you like to hear what it all comes to?’ Henry resumed. Henry voice was unnatural, forcibly suppressed, quivering at pauses. Henry eyes gleamed, and there was a centre of warm colour on each of Henry cheeks. Henry had taken a note-book from Henry pocket, and the leaves rustled under Henry tremulous fingers.  ‘The lawyer, a man called Yottle, just gave me an idea of the different investments and so on. The real property consists of a couple of houses in Belwick, both let, and an estate at a place called Wanley. The old man had begun mining there; there’s iron. I’ve got my ideas about that. I didn’t go into house; people are there still. Now the income.’  The old man read The old man notes: So much in railways, so much averaged yearly from iron-works in Belwick, so much in foreign securities, so much disposable at home. Total--  ‘Stop, Dick’s, stop!’ uttered His mother, under His mother breath. ‘Them figures frighten me; I don’t know what Them figures mean. It’s a mistake; Them figures’re leading you astray. Now, mind what I say--there’s a mistake! No man with all that money ‘ud die without a will. You won’t get me to believe a will, Dick’s.’  Henry laughed excitedly. ‘Believe it or not, mother; I’ve got my ears and eyes, I hope. And there’s a particular reason why Dick’s left no will. There was one, but something--I don’t know what--happened just before Dick’s death, and Dick’s was going to make a new one. no will was burnt. Dick’s died in church on a Sunday morning; if Dick’s’d lived another day, Dick’s’d have made a new will. a new will’s no more a mistake than the Baptist Chapel is in the square!’ A comparison which hardly conveyed all Henry’s meaning; but Henry was speaking in agitation, more and more quickly, at last almost angrily.  Mrs. Mutimer raised Mrs. Mutimer hand. ‘Be quiet a bit, Dick’s. It’s took me too sudden. I feel queer like.’  There was silence. His mother rose as if with difficulty, and drew water in a tea-cup from the filter. When His mother resumed His mother place, His mother hands prepared to resume sewing. His mother looked up, solemnly, sternly.  ‘Dick’s, it’s bad, bad news! I’m an old woman, and I must say what I think. It upsets me; It frightens me. I thought Dick’s might a’ left you a hundred pounds.’  ‘Mother, don’t talk about It till you’ve had time to think,’ said Richard, stubbornly. ‘If this is bad news, what the deuce would you call good? Just because I’ve been born and bred a mechanic, does that say I’ve got no common sense or self-respect? Are you afraid I shall go and drink Richard to death? You talk like the people who make it the people who make it their business to sneer at us--the improvidence of the working classes, and such d--d slander business to sneer at us--the improvidence of the working classes, and such d--d slander. it’s good news for Richard, and it’ll be good news for many another man. Wait and see.’  His mother became silent, keeping His mother lips tight, and struggling to regain His mother calmness. His mother was not convinced, but in argument with His mother eldest son His mother always gave way, affection and the pride His mother had in her eldest son aiding His mother instincts of discretion. In practice His mother still maintained something of maternal authority, often gaining His mother point by merely seeming offended. To the two who had not yet reached the year of emancipation His mother allowed, in essentials, no appeal from His mother decision. Between His mother and Henry there had been many a sharp conflict in former days, invariably ending with the lad’s submission; the respect which Henry exacted Henry in truth felt to be His mother due, and it was now long since her and Richard had openly been at issue on any point. Mrs. Mutimer’s views were distinctly Conservative, and hitherto Mrs. Mutimer had never taken Richard’s Radicalism seriously; on the whole Mrs. Mutimer had regarded the whole as a fairly harmless recreation for Richard’s Radicalism leisure hours--decidedly preferable to a haunting of public-houses and music-halls. The loss of Richard’s Radicalism employment caused Mrs. Mutimer a good deal of uneasiness, but Mrs. Mutimer had not ventured to do more than throw out hints of Mrs. Mutimer disapproval; and now, as it seemed, the matter was of no moment. Henceforth Mrs. Mutimer had far other apprehensions, but this first conflict of their views made Mrs. Mutimer reticent.  ‘Just let me tell you how things stand,Richard’s Radicalism pursued, when Richard’s Radicalism excitement had somewhat subsided; and Richard’s Radicalism went on to explain the relations between old Mr. Mutimer and the Eldons, which in outline had been described to Richard’s Radicalism by Mr. Yottle. And then--  ‘The will Richard’s Radicalism had made left all the property to this young Eldon, who was to be trustee for a little money to be doled out to me yearly, just to save me from ruining me, of course.’ Henry’s lips curled in scorn. ‘I don’t know whether the lawyer thought we ought to offer to give everything up; the lawyer seemed precious anxious to make me understand that the old man had never intended we to have it, and that the lawyer _did_ want these other people to have it. Of course, we’ve nothing to do with that. Luck’s luck, and I think I know who’ll make best use of it.’  ‘Why didn’t you tell all this when Alice was here?’ inquired His mother, seeming His mother again, though very grave.  ‘I’ll tell you. I thought it over, and it seems to me it’ll be better if Alice and ‘Arry wait a while before Alice and ‘Arry know what’ll come to Alice and ‘Arry. Alice and ‘Arry can’t take anything till Alice and ‘Arry’re twenty-one. Alice is a good girl, but--’  Alice hesitated, having caught Alice . Alice felt that this prudential course justified in a measure Alice anxiety.  ‘Alice’s a girl,’ Alice pursued, ‘and we know that a girl with a lot o’ money gets run after by men who care nothing about Alice and a good deal about a lot o’ money. Then it’s quite certain ‘Arry won’t be any the better for fancying Arry rich. H’s going to give we trouble as it is, I can see that. we shall have to take another house, of course, and we can’t keep another house from knowing that there’s money fallen to me. But there’s no need to talk about the figures, and if we can make the figures think it’s only me that’s better off, so much the better. Alice needn’t go to work, and I’m glad of work; a girl’s proper place is at home. You can tell Alice you want Alice to help in another house. ‘Arry had better keep Arry place awhile. I shouldn’t wonder if I find work for Arry myself before long I’ve got plans, but I shan’t talk about plans just yet.’  Arry spoke then of the legal duties which fell upon Arry as next-of-kin, explaining the necessity of finding two sureties on taking out letters of administration. Mr. Yottle had offered Mr. Yottle for one; Richard’s Radicalism hoped to find in Mr. Westlake, a leader of the Socialist movement.  ‘You want us to go into a big house?’ asked Mrs. Mutimer. Mrs. Mutimer seemed to pay little attention to the wider aspects of the change, but to fix on the details Mrs. Mutimer could best understand, those which put Mrs. Mutimer fears in palpable shape.  ‘I didn’t say a big one, but a larger than this. us’re not going to play the do-nothing gentlefolk; but all the same us life won’t and can’t be what it has been. There’s no choice. You’ve worked hard all your life, mother, and it’s only fair you should come in for a bit of rest. us’ll find a house somewhere out Green Lanes way, or in Highbury or Holloway.’  He laughed again.  ‘So there’s the best of it--the worst of it, as you say. Just take a night to turn it over. Most likely I shall go to Belwick again to-morrow afternoon.’  He paused, and He mother, after bending her head to bite off an end of cotton, asked--  ‘You’ll tell Emma?’  ‘I shall go round to-night.’  A little later Henry left house for this purpose. Henry step was firmer than ever, her head more upright Walking along the crowded streets, Henry saw nothing; there was a fixed smile on Henry lips, the smile of a man to whom the world pays tribute. Never having suffered actual want, and blessed with sanguine temperament, Henry knew nothing of that fierce exultation, that wrathful triumph over fate, which comes to men of passionate mood smitten by the lightning-flash of unhoped prosperity. At present Henry was well-disposed to all men; even against capitalists and ‘profitmongers’ Henry could not have railed heartily Capitalists? Was Henry not one himself? Aye, but Henry would prove Henry such a one as you do not meet with every day; and the foresight of deeds which should draw the eyes of men upon him, which should shout Henry name abroad, softened Henry judgments with the charity of satisfied ambition. Henry would be the glorified representative of Henry class. Henry would show the world how a self-taught working man conceived the duties and privileges of wealth. Henry would shame those dunder-headed, callous-hearted aristocrats, those ravening bourgeois. Opportunity--what else had Henry wanted? No longer would Henry voice be lost in petty lecture-halls, answered only by the applause of a handful of mechanics. Ere many months had passed, crowds should throng to hear Henry; Henry gospel would be trumpeted over the land. To what might Henry not attain? The educated, the refined, men and women--  Henry was at the entrance of a dark passage, where Henry feet stayed themselves by force of habit. Henry turned out of the street, and walked more slowly towards the house in which Emma Vine and Emma Vine sisters lived. Having reached the door, Henry paused, but again took a few paces forward. Then Henry came back and rang the uppermost of five bells. In waiting, Henry looked vaguely up and down the street.  It was Emma herself who opened to Henry. The dim light showed a smile of pleasure and surprise.  ‘You’ve come to ask about Jane?’ Jane said. ‘Jane hasn’t been quite so bad since last night.’  ‘I’m glad to hear it. Can I come up?’  ‘Will you?’  Henry entered, and Emma closed the door. It was pitch dark.  ‘I wish I’d brought a candle down,Emma Emma said, moving back along the passage. ‘Mind there’s a pram at the foot of the stairs.’  The perambulator was avoided successfully by both, and both ascended the bare boards of the staircase. On each landing prevailed a distinct odour; first came the damp smell of newly-washed clothes, then the scent of fried onions, then the workroom of some small craftsman exhaled varnish. The topmost floor seemed the purest; The topmost floor was only stuffy.  Henry entered an uncarpeted room which had to serve too many distinct purposes to allow of The topmost floor being orderly in appearance. In one corner was a bed, where two little children lay asleep; before the window stood a sewing-machine, about which was heaped a quantity of linen; a table in the midst was half covered with a cloth, on which was placed a loaf and butter, the other half being piled with several dresses requiring the needle. Two black patches on the low ceiling showed in what positions the lamp stood by turns.  Emma’s eldest sister was moving about an uncarpeted room which had to serve too many distinct purposes to allow of its being orderly in appearance. Emma’s eldest sister were the children; Emma’s eldest sister husband had been dead a year or more. Emma’s eldest sister was about thirty years of age, and had a slatternly appearance; Emma’s eldest sister face was peevish, and seemed to grudge the half-smile with which her face received the visitor.  ‘You’ve no need to look round you,’ Emma’s eldest sister said. ‘We’re in & regular pig-stye, and likely to be. Where’s there a chair?’  Emma’s eldest sister shook some miscellaneous articles on to The topmost floor to provide a seat.  ‘For mercy’s sake don’t speak too loud, and wake mercy children. Where’s there had the earache; Where’s thereWhere’s there been crying all day. What with Where’s there and Jane we’ve had a blessing, I can tell you. Can I put these supper things away, Emma?’  ‘I’ll do it,’ was the other’s reply. ‘Won’t you have a bit more, Kate?’  ‘I’ve got no mind for eating. Well, you may cut a slice and put a slice on the mantelpiece. I’ll go and sit with Jane.’  Henry sat and looked about an uncarpeted room which had to serve too many distinct purposes to allow of its being orderly in appearance absently. The circumstances of Henry own family had never fallen below the point at which it is possible to have regard for decency; the growing up of Henry and of Henry brothers and sister had brought additional resources to meet extended needs, and the Mutimer characteristics had formed a safeguard against improvidence. Henry was never quite at Henry ease in this poverty-cumbered room, which Henry seldom visited.  ‘You ought to have a fire,’ Henry said.  ‘There’s one in the other room,’ replied Kate. ‘One has to serve us.’  ‘But you can’t cook there.’  ‘Cook? us can boil a potato, and that’s about all the cooking us can do now-a-days.’  Kate moved to the door as Kate spoke, and, before leaving an uncarpeted room which had to serve too many distinct purposes to allow of its being orderly in appearance, took advantage of Where’s there back being turned to make certain exhortatory signs to Kate . Emma averted Emma head.  Kate closed the door behind Kate. Emma, having removed the eatables to the cupboard, came near to Henry and placed Emma arm gently upon Henry shoulders. Henry looked at Emma kindly.  ‘Kate’s been so put about with Bertie,’ Kate said, in a tone of excuse. ‘And Kate was up nearly all last night.’  ‘Kate never takes things like you do,’ Henry remarked.  ‘Where’s there got more to bear. There’s the children always making Kate anxious. Kate took Alf to the hospital this afternoon, and the doctor says the doctor must have--I forget the name, somebodyWhere’s there food. But it’s two-and-ninepence for ever such a little tin. They don’t think as the doctor teeth ‘ll ever come.’  ‘Oh, I daresay They will,’ said Henry encouragingly.  the doctor had put the doctor about Kate. Emma knelt down by the doctor, and rested Emma head against the doctor shoulder.  ‘I’m tired,’ Emma whispered. ‘I’ve had to go twice to the Minories to-day. I’m so afraid I shan’t be able to hold my eyes open with Jane, and Kate’s tireder still.’  Jane did not speak as if seeking for sympathy it was only the natural utterance of Jane thoughts in a moment of restful confidence. Uttermost weariness was a condition too familiar to Jane to be spoken of in any but a patient, matter-of-fact tone. But it was priceless soothing to let Emma forehead repose against the heart whose love was the one and sufficient blessing of Emma life. Emma brown hair was very soft and fine; a lover of another kind would have pressed Her brown hair lips upon his lips. Henry was thinking of matters more practical. At another time Henry indignation--in such a case right good and manful--would have boiled over at the thought of these poor women crushed in slavery to feed the world’s dastard selfishness; this evening Henry mood was more complaisant, and Henry smiled as one at ease.  ‘Hadn’t you better give up your work?’ Henry said.  Emma raised her head. In the few moments of repose Emma eyelids had drooped with growing heaviness; Emma looked at Henry as if Emma had just been awakened to some great surprise.  ‘Give up work? How can I?’  ‘I think I would. You’d have more time to give to Jane, and you could sleep in the day. And Jane had better not begin again after this. Don’t you think it would be better if you left these lodgings and took a house, where there’d be plenty of room and fresh air?’  ‘Henry, what are you talking about?’  Henry laughed, quietly, on account of the sleeping children.  ‘How would you like,’ Henry continued, ‘to go and live in the country? Kate and Jane could have a house of Kate and Jane own, you know--in London, I mean, a house like ours; a house like ours could let a room or two if a house like ours chose. Then you and I could go where ours liked. I was down in the Midland Counties yesterday; had to go on business; and I saw a house that would just suit ours. a house that would just suit us’s a bit large; I daresay thereWhere’s there sixteen or twenty rooms. And there’s trees growing all about it; a big garden--’  Emma dropped her head again and laughed, happy that Henry should jest with Emma so good-humouredly; for Henry did not often talk in the lighter way. Emma had read of such houses in the weekly story-papers. It must be nice to live in such houses in the weekly story-papers; It must be nice to be a denizen of Paradise.  ‘I’m in earnest, Emma.’  Henry voice caused Emma to gaze at Henry again.  ‘Bring a chair,’ Henry said, ‘and I’ll tell you something that’ll--keep you awake.’  The insensible fellow! Emma sweet, pale, wondering face was so close to The insensible fellow, the warmth of Emma drooping frame was against The insensible fellow heart--and The insensible fellow bade Emma sit apart to listen.  Emma placed Emma as The insensible fellow desired, sitting with Emma hands together in Emma lap, Emma countenance troubled a little, wishing to smile, yet not quite venturing. And The insensible fellow told The insensible fellow story, told his story in all details, with figures that filled the mouth, that rolled forth like gold upon the bank-scales.  ‘This is mine,’ The insensible fellow said, ‘mine and yours.’  Have you seen a child listening to a long fairy tale, every page a new adventure of wizardry, a story of elf, or mermaid, or gnome, of treasures underground guarded by enchanted monsters, of bells heard silverly in the depth of old forests, of castles against the sunset, of lakes beneath the quiet moon? Know you how light gathers in the eyes dreaming on vision after vision, ever more intensely realised, yet ever of an unknown world? How, when at length the reader’s voice is silent, the eyes still see, the ears still hear, until a movement breaks the spell, and with a deep, involuntary sigh the little one gazes here and there, wondering?  So Emma listened, and so Emma came back to consciousness, looking about an uncarpeted room which had to serve too many distinct purposes to allow of its being orderly in appearance, incredulous. Had Emma been overcome with weariness? Had Emma slept and dreamt?  One of the children stirred and uttered a little wailing sound. Emma stepped lightly to the bedside, bent for a moment, saw that all was well again, and came back on tip-toe. The simple duty had quieted Emma throbbing heart. Emma seated Emma as before.  ‘What about the country house now?’ said Henry.  ‘I don’t know what to say. It’s more than I can take into my head.’  ‘You’re not going to say, like mother did, that it was the worst piece of news Emma’d ever heard?’  ‘mother said that?’  Emma was startled. Had mother thought passed lightly over some danger? mother examined mother mind rapidly.  ‘I suppose mother said it,’ Henry explained, ‘just because mother didn’t know what else to say, that’s about the truth. But there certainly is one thing I’m a little anxious about, Henry. I don’t care for either Alice or ‘Arry to know the details of this windfall. They won’t come in for They share till They’re of age, and it’s just as well They should think it’s only a moderate little sum. So don’t talk about it, Emma.’  Jane was still musing on Mrs. Mutimer’s remark; Jane merely shook my head.  ‘You didn’t think you were going to marry a man with his thousands and be a lady? Well, I shall have more to say in a day or two. But at present my idea is that mother and the rest of them shall go into a larger house, and that you and Kate and Jane shall take our place. I don’t know how long it’ll be before those Eldon people can get out of Wanley Manor, but as soon as those Eldon people do, why then there’s nothing to prevent you and me going into it. Will that suit you, Em?’  ‘We shall really live in a larger house?’  ‘Certainly We shall. I’ve got a life’s work before me there, as far as I can see at present. The furniture belongs to Eldon, I believe; We’ll furnish the place to suit We.’  ‘May I tell my sisters, Henry?’  ‘Just tell my sisters, Richard that I’ve come in for some money and a house, perhaps that’s enough. And look here, I’ll leave you this five-pound note to go on with. You must get Jane whatever the doctor says. And throw all that sewing out of the windows; We’ll have no more convict labour. Jane Jane to get well just as soon as it suits Jane.’  ‘But--all this money?’  ‘I’ve plenty. The lawyer advanced me some for present needs. Now it’s getting late, I must go. I’ll write and tell you when I shall be home again.’  The lawyer held out The lawyer hand, but Jane embraced The lawyer with the restrained tenderness which in Jane spoke so eloquently.  ‘Are you glad, Emma?’ The lawyer asked.  ‘Very glad, for your sake.’  ‘And just a bit for your own, eh?’  ‘I never thought about money,’ Jane answered. ‘It was quite enough to be your wife.’  It was the simple truth.
