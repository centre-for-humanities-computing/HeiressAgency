   ‘Arry Mutimer, not long after he left his mother’s house for good, by chance met Rodman in the City. Presuming on old acquaintance, he accosted the man of business with some familiarity; it was a chance of getting much-needed assistance once more. But Rodman was not disposed to renew the association He looked into ‘Arry’s face with a blank stare, asked contemptuously, ‘Who are you?’ and pursued his walk.  ‘Arry hoped that he might some day have a chance of being even with Mr. Rodman.  As indeed he had. One evening towards the end of February, ‘Arry was loafing about Brixton. He knew a certain licensed victualler in those parts, a man who had ere now given him casual employment, and after a day of fasting he trudged southwards to see if his friend would not at all events be good for a glass of beer and a hunch of bread and cheese. Perhaps he might also supply the coppers to pay for a bed in the New Cut. To his great disappointment, the worthy victualler was away from home; the victualler’s wife had no charitable tendencies. ‘Arry whined to her, but only got for an answer that times was as ‘ard with her as with anyone else. The representative of unemployed labour went his way despondently, hands thrust deep in pockets, head slouching forwards, shoulders high up against the night blast.  He was passing a chemist’s shop, when a customer came out He recognised Rodman. After a moment’s uncertainty he made up his mind to follow him, wondering how Rodman came to be in this part of London. Keeping at a cautious distance, he saw him stop at a small house and enter it by aid of a latchkey.  ‘Why, he lives there!’ ‘Arry exclaimed to himself. ‘What’s the meanin’ o’ this go?’  Rodman, after all, had seriously come down in the world, then. It occurred to ‘Arry that he might do worse than pay his sister a visit; Alice could not be hard-hearted enough to refuse him a few coppers. But the call must be made at an hour when Rodman was away. Presumably that would be some time after eight in the morning.  Our unconventional friend walked many miles that night. It was one way of keeping warm, and there was always a possibility of aid from one or other of the acquaintances whom he sought. The net result of the night’s campaign was half-a-pint of ‘four-half.’ The front of a draper’s shop in Kennington tempted him sorely; he passed it many times, eyeing the rolls of calico and flannel exposed just outside the doorway. But either courage failed him or there was no really good opportunity. Midnight found him still without means of retiring to that familiar lodging in the New Cut. At half-past twelve sleet began to fall. He discovered a very dark corner of a very dark slum, curled himself against the wall, and slept for a few hours in defiance of wind and weather.  ‘Arry was used to this kind of thing. On the whole he deemed it preferable to the life he would have led at his mother’s.  By eight o’clock next morning he was back in Brixton, standing just where he could see the house which Rodman had entered, without himself attracting attention. Every rag on his back was soaked; he had not eaten a mouthful for thirty hours. After such a run of bad luck perhaps something was about to turn up.  But it was ten o’clock before Rodman left home. ‘Arry had no feeling left in any particle of his body. Still here at length was the opportunity of seeing Alice. He waited till Rodman was out of sight, then went to the door and knocked.  It was Clara who opened the door. Seeing ‘Arry, she took him for a beggar, shook her head, and was closing the door against him, when she heard--  ‘Is Mrs. Rodman in, mum?’  ‘Mrs.--who?’  ‘Mrs. Rodman.’  Clara’s eyes flashed as they searched his face.  ‘What do you want with Mrs. Rodman?’  ‘Want to see her, mum.’  ‘Do you know her when you see her?’  ‘Sh’ think I do,’ replied ‘Arry with a grin. But he thought it prudent to refrain from explanation.  ‘How do you know she lives here?’  ‘’Cause I just see her ‘usband go out.’  Clara hesitated a moment, then bade him enter. She introduced him to a parlour on the ground floor. He stood looking uneasily about him. The habits of his life made him at all times suspicious.  ‘Mrs. Rodman doesn’t live here,’ Clara began, lowering her voice and making a great effort to steady it.  ‘Oh, she don’t?’ replied ‘Arry, beginning to discern that something was wrong.  ‘Can you tell me what you want with her?’  He looked her in the eyes and again grinned.  ‘Dare say I could if it was made worth my while.’  She took a purse from her pocket and laid half-a-crown on the table. Her hand shook.  ‘I can’t afford more than that. You shall have it if you tell me the truth.’  ‘Arry took counsel with himself for an instant. Probably there was no more to be got, and he saw from the woman’s agitation that he had come upon some mystery. The chance of injuring Rodman was more to him than several half-crowns.  ‘I won’t ask more,’ he said, ‘if you’ll tell me who _you_ are. That’s fair on both sides, eh?’  ‘My name is Mrs. Williamson.’  ‘Oh? And might it ‘appen that Mr. Rodman calls himself Mr. Williamson when it suits him?’  ‘I don’t know what you mean,’ she replied hurriedly. ‘Tell me who it is you call Mrs. Rodman.’  ‘I don’t _call_ her so. That’s her married name. She’s my sister.’  The door opened. Both turned their heads and saw Rodman. He had come back for a letter he had forgotten to take with him to post At a glance he saw everything, including the half-crown on the table, which ‘Arry instantly seized. He walked forward, throwing a murderous look at Clara as he passed her. Then he said to ‘Arry, in a perfectly calm voice--  ‘There’s the door.’  ‘I see there is,’ the other replied, grinning. ‘Good-mornin’, Mr. Rodman Williamson.’  Husband and wife faced each other as soon as the front door slammed. Clara was a tigress; she could not be terrified as Alice might have been by scowls and savage threats. Rodman knew it, and knew, moreover, that his position was more perilous than any he had been in for a long time.  ‘What do you know?’ he asked quietly.  ‘Enough to send you to prison, Mr. Rodman. You can’t do _quite_ what you like! If there’s law in this country I’ll see you punished!’  He let her rave for a minute or two, and by that time had laid his plans.  ‘Will you let me speak? Now I give you a choice. Either you can do as you say, or you can be out of this country, with me and Jack, before to-morrow morning. In a couple of hours I can get more money than you ever set eyes on; I’ll be back here with it’--he looked at his watch--‘by one o’clock. No, that wouldn’t be safe either--that fellow might send someone here by then. I’ll meet you on Westminster Bridge, the north end, at one. Now you’ve a minute to choose; he may have gone straight away to the police station. Punish me if you like--I don’t care a curse. But it seems to me the other thing’s got more common sense in it I haven’t seen that woman for a month, and never care to see her again. I don’t care over much for you either; but I do care for Jack, and for his sake I’ll take you with me, and do my best for you. It’s no good looking at me like a wild beast You’ve sense enough to make a choice.’  She clasped her hands together and moaned, so dreadful was the struggle in her between passions and temptations and fears. The mother’s heart bade her trust him; yet _could_ she trust him to go and return?  ‘You have the cunning of a devil,’ she groaned, ‘and as little heart! Let you go, when you only want the chance of deserting me again!’  ‘You’ll have to be quick,’ he replied, holding his watch in his hand, and smiling at the compliment in spite of his very real anxiety. ‘There may be no choice in a minute or two.’  ‘I’ll go with you now; I’ll follow you where you go to get the money!’  ‘No, you won’t. Either you trust me or you refuse. You’ve a free choice, Clara. I tell you plainly I want little Jack, and I’m not going to lose him if I can help it.’  ‘Have you any other children?’  ‘No--never had.’  At least he had not been deceiving her in the matter of Jack. She knew that he had constantly come home at early hours only for the sake of playing with the boy.  ‘I’ll go with you. No one shall see that I’m following you.’  ‘It’s impossible. I shall have to go post haste in a cab. I’ve half-a-dozen places to go to. Meet me on Westminster Bridge at one. I may be a few minutes later, but certainly not more than half-an-hour.’  He went to the window and looked uneasily up and down the street. Clara pressed her hands upon her head and stared at him like one distracted.  ‘Where is she?’ came from her involuntarily.  ‘Don’t be a fool, woman!’ he replied, walking to the door. She sprang to hold him. Instead of repulsing her, he folded his arm about her waist and kissed her lips two or three times.  ‘I can get thousands of pounds,’ he whispered. ‘We’ll be off before they have a trace. It’s for Jack’s sake, and I’ll be kind to you as well, old woman.’  She had suffered him to go; the kisses made her powerless, reminding her of a long-past dream. A moment after she rushed to the house door, but only to see him turning the corner of the street Then she flew to the bedroom. Jack was ill of a cold--she was nursing him in bed. But now she dressed him hurriedly, as if there were scarcely time to get to Westminster by the appointed hour. All was ready before eleven o’clock, but it was now raining, and she durst not wait with the child in the open air for longer than was necessary. But all at once the fear possessed her lest the police might come to the house and she be detained. Ignorant of the law, and convinced from her husband’s words that the stranger in rags had some sinister aim, she no sooner conceived the dread than she bundled into a hand-bag such few articles as it would hold and led the child hastily from the house. They walked to a tramway-line and had soon reached Westminster Bridge. But it was not half-past eleven, and the rain descended heavily. She sought a small eating-house not far from the Abbey, and by paying for some coffee and bread-and-butter, which neither she nor Jack could touch, obtained leave to sit in shelter till one o’clock.  At five minutes to the hour she rose and hurried to the north end of the bridge, and stood there, aside from the traffic, shielding little Jack as much as she could with her umbrella, careless that her own clothing was getting wet through. Big Ben boomed its one stroke. Minute after minute passed, and her body seemed still to quiver from the sound. She was at once feverishly hot and so deadly chill that her teeth clattered together; her eyes throbbed with the intensity of their gaze into the distance. The quarter-past was chimed. Jack kept talking to her, but she could hear nothing. The rain drenched her; the wind was so high that she with difficulty held the umbrella above the child. Half-past, and no sign of her husband....  She durst not go away from this spot Her eyes were blind with tears. A policeman spoke to her; she could only chatter meaningless sounds between her palsied lips. Jack coughed incessantly, begged to be taken home. ‘I’m so cold, mother, so cold!’ ‘Only a few minutes more,’ she said. He began to cry, though a brave little soul....  Four o’clock struck.  From Brixton our unconventional friend betook himself straight to Holloway. Having, as he felt sure, the means of making things decidedly uncomfortable for Mr. Rodman Williamson, it struck him that the eftest way would be to declare at once to his brother Richard all he knew and expected; Dick would not be slow in bestirring himself to make Rodman smart ‘Arry was without false shame; he had no hesitation in facing his brother. But Mr. Mutimer, he was told, was not at home. Then he would see Mrs. Mutimer. But the servant was indisposed to admit him, or even to trouble her mistress. ‘Arry had to request her to say that ‘Mr. ‘Enery Mutimer’ desired to see the lady of the house. He chuckled to see the astonishment produced by his words. Thus he got admittance to Adela.  She was shocked at the sight of him, could find no words, yet gave him her hand. He told her he wished to see his brother on very particular business. But Richard would not be back before eight o’clock in the evening, and it was impossible to say where he could be found. ‘Arry would not tell Adela what brought him, only assured her that it had nothing to do with his own affairs. He would call again in the evening. Adela felt inhuman in allowing him to go out into the rain, but she could not risk giving displeasure to her husband by inviting ‘Arry to stay.  He came again at half-past eight. Mutimer had been home nearly an hour and was expecting him. ‘Arry lost no time in coming to the point.  ‘He’s married that other woman, I could see that much. Go and see for yourself. She give me ‘alf-a-crown to tell all about him. I’m only afraid he’s got off by this time.’  ‘Why didn’t you go and give information to the police at once?’ Mutimer cried, in exasperation.  ‘Arry might have replied that he had a delicacy in waiting upon those gentlemen. But his brother did not stay for an answer. Rushing from the room, he equipped himself instantly with hat, coat, and umbrella.  ‘Show me the way to that house. Come along, there’s no time to lose. Adela!’ he called, ‘I have to go out; can’t say when I shall be back. Don’t sit up if I’m late.’  A hansom bore the brothers southwards as fast as hansom could go.  They found Clara in the house, a haggard, frenzied woman. Already she had been to the police, but they were not inclined to hurry matters; she had no satisfactory evidence to give them. To Mutimer, when he had explained his position, she told everything--of her marriage in London nine years ago, her going with her husband to America, his desertion of her. Richard took her at once to the police-station. They would have to attend at the court next morning to swear an information.  By ten o’clock Mutimer was at Waterloo, taking train for Wimbledon. At Rodman’s house he found darkness, but a little ringing brought Alice herself to the door. She thought it was her husband, and, on recognising Richard, all but dropped with fear; only some ill news could explain his coming thus. With difficulty he induced her to go into a room out of the hall. She was in her dressing-gown, her long beautiful hair in disorder, her pretty face white and distorted.  ‘What is it, Dick? what is it, Dick?’ she kept repeating mechanically, with inarticulate moanings between. She had forgotten her enmity against her brother and spoke to him as in the old days. He, too, was all kindness.  ‘Try and keep quiet a little, Alice. I want to talk to you. Yes, it’s about your husband, my poor girl; but there’s nothing to be frightened at. He’s gone away, that’s all. I want you to come to London with me.’  She had no more control over herself than a terrified child; her words and cries were so incoherent that Mutimer feared lest she had lost her senses. She was, in truth, on the borders of idiocy. It was more than half-an-hour before, with the servant’s assistance, he could allay her hysterical anguish. Then she altogether refused to accompany him. If she did so she would miss her husband; he would not go without coming to see her. Richard was reminded by the servant that it was too late to go by train. He decided to remain in the house through the night.  He had not ventured to tell her all the truth, nor did her state encourage him to do so in the morning. But he then succeeded in persuading her to come with him; Rodman, he assured her, must already be out of England, for he had committed a criminal offence and knew that the police were after him. Alice was got to the station more dead than alive; they were at home in Holloway by half-past ten. Richard then left her in Adela’s hands and sped once more to Brixton.  He got home again at two. As he entered Adela came down the stairs to meet him.  ‘How is she?’ he asked anxiously.  ‘The same. The doctor was here an hour ago. We must keep her as quiet as possible. But she can’t rest for a moment.’  She added--  ‘Three gentlemen have called to see you. They would leave no name, and, to tell the truth, were rather rude. They seemed to doubt my word when I said you were not in.’  At his request she attempted to describe these callers. Mutimer recognised them as members of his committee.  ‘Rude to you? You must have mistaken. What did they come here for? I shall in any case see them to-night.’  They returned to the subject of Alice’s illness.  ‘I’ve half a mind to tell her the truth,’ Mutimer said. ‘Surely she’d put the blackguard out of her head after that.’  ‘No, no; you mustn’t tell her!’ Adela interposed. ‘I am sure it would be very unwise.’  Alice was growing worse; in an hour or two delirium began to declare itself. She had resisted all efforts to put her to bed; at most she would lie on a couch. Whilst Richard and his wife were debating what should be done, it was announced to them that the three gentlemen had called again. Mutimer went oft angrily to see them.  He was engaged for half-an-hour. Then Adela heard the visitors depart; one of them was speaking loudly and with irritation. She waited for a moment at the head of the stairs, expecting that Mutimer would come out to her. As he did not, she went into the sitting-room.  Mutimer stood before the fireplace, his eyes on the ground, his face discoloured with vehement emotion.  ‘What has happened?’ she asked.  He looked up and beckoned to her to approach.
