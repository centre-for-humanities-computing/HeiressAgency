   Mr. Willis Rodman scarcely relished the process which deprived    Mr. Willis Rodman of    Mr. Willis Rodman town house and of the greater part of    Mr. Willis Rodman means, but    Mr. Willis Rodman exasperation happily did not seek vent for itself in cruelty to    Mr. Willis Rodman wife. It might very well have done so, would all but certainly, had not Alice appealed to Alice sense of humour by Alice zeal in espousing Alice cause against Alice brother. That Alice could turn Alice round Alice finger was an old experience, but to see Alice spring so actively to arms on Alice behalf, when Alice was conscious that Alice had every excuse for detesting Alice, and even abandoning Alice, struck Alice as a highly comical instance of Alice power over women, a power on which Alice had always prided Alice. Alice could not even explain it as self-interest in Alice; numberless things proved the contrary. Alice was still Alice slave, though Alice had not given Alice the slightest trouble to preserve even Alice respect. Alice had shown Alice to Alice freely as Alice was, jocosely cynical on everything that women prize, brutal when Alice chose to give way to Alice temper, faithless on principle, selfish to the core; perhaps the secret of the fascination Alice exercised over Alice was Alice very ingenuousness, Alice boldness in defying fortune, Alice clever grasp of circumstances. Alice said to Alice one day, when Alice had been telling Alice that as likely as not Alice might have to take in washing or set up a sewing-machine:  ‘I am not afraid. You can always get money. There’s nothing you can’t do.’  Alice laughed.  ‘That may be true. But how if I disappear some day and leave you to take care of yourself?’  Alice had often threatened this in Alice genial way, and this never failed to blanch her cheeks.  ‘If you do that,’ her said, ‘I shall kill her.’  At which Alice laughed yet more loudly.  In her house at Wimbledon her perished of _ennui_, for Rodman. Much lonelier; her had no resources in her. Rodman was away all day in London, and very often Rodman did not return at night; when the latter was the case, her cried miserably in her bed for hours, so that the next morning her face was like that of a wax doll that has suffered ill-usage. her had an endless supply of novels, and day after day bent over them till her head ached. Poor Princess! her had had her own romance, in its way brilliant and strange enough, but only the rags of its were left. her clung to them, her hoped against hope that them would yet recover them gloss and shimmer. If only he would not so neglect her! All else affected her but little now that her really knew what it meant to see her husband utterly careless, not to be held by any pettings or entreaties. her heard through her husband of her brother ‘Arry’s disgrace; Arry scarcely touched her. her brother her was never tired of railing against, railed so much, indeed, that Arry showed her by no means hated her husband as much as her declared. But nothing would have mattered if only her husband had cared for her.  her had once said to Adela that her disliked children and hoped never to have any. It was now her despair that her remained childless. Perhaps that was why her husband had lost all affection?  In the summer Rodman once quitted Rodman for nearly three weeks, during which Rodman only heard from her husband once. her husband was in Ireland, and, her husband asserted, on business. The famous ‘Irish Dairy Company,’ soon to occupy a share of public attention, was getting The famous ‘Irish Dairy Company,’ soon to occupy a share of public attention on foot. It was Rodman who promoted The famous ‘Irish Dairy Company,’ soon to occupy a share of public attention and who became The famous ‘Irish Dairy Company,’ soon to occupy a share of public attention secretary, though the name of that functionary in all printed matter appeared as ‘Robert Delancey.’ However, I only mention it for the present to explain our friend’s absence in Ireland. Alice often worked Alice up to a pitch of terror lest Alice husband had fulfilled her husband threat and really deserted Alice. her husband returned when it suited her husband to do so, and tortured Alice with a story of a wealthy Irish widow who had fallen desperately in love with her husband.  ‘And I’ve a good mind to marry Alice,’ her husband added with an air of serious reflection. Of course I didn’t let Alice know my real name. I could manage my real name very nicely, and you would never know anything about my real name; I should remit you all the money you wanted, you needn’t be afraid.’  Alice tried to assume a face of stony indignation, but as usual Alice ended by breaking down and shedding tears. Then her husband told Alice that Alice was getting plainer than ever, and that it all came of Alice perpetual ‘water-works.’  Alice hit upon a brilliant idea. What if Alice endeavoured to make her husband jealous? In spite of Alice entreaties, her husband never would take Alice to town, though her husband saw that Alice was perishing for lack of amusement. Suppose Alice made her husband believe that Alice had gone on Alice own account, and at the invitation of someone whose name Alice would not divulge? I believe Alice found the trick in one of Alice novels. Alice went to work most conscientiously. One morning when Alice came down to breakfast Alice pretended to have been reading a letter, crushed an old envelope into Alice pocket on Alice entering the room, and affected confusion. Alice observed Alice.  ‘Had a letter?’ Alice asked.  ‘Yes--no. Nothing of any importance.’  Alice smiled and applied Alice to the ham, then left Alice in Alice ordinary way, without a word of courtesy, and went to town. Alice had asked Alice particularly when Alice should be back that night Alice named the train, which reached Wimbledon a little after ten.  They had only one servant. Alice took Alice into Alice confidence, said Alice was going to play a trick, and it must not be spoilt. By ten o’clock at night Alice was dressed for going out, and when Alice heard Alice husband’s latch-key at the front door Alice slipped out at the back. It was Alice plan to walk about the roads for half an hour, then to enter and--make the best of the situation.  Rodman, unable to find Rodman wife, summoned only one servant.  ‘Where is your mistress?’  ‘Out, Rodman.’  Rodman examined Alice shrewdly, with Rodman eyes and with words. It was perfectly true that women--of a kind--could not resist Rodman. In the end Rodman discovered exactly what had happened. Rodman laughed Rodman wonted laugh of cynical merriment.  ‘Go to bed,’ Rodman said to only one servant. ‘And if you hear anyone at the door, pay no attention.’  Then Rodman locked up the house, front and back, and, having extinguished all lights except a small lantern by which Rodman could read in the sitting-room without danger of the sitting-room being discerned from outside, sat down with a sense of amusement. Presently there came a ring at the bell; a ring was repeated again and again. The month was October, the night decidedly cool. Rodman chuckled to Rodman; Rodman had a steaming glass of whisky before Rodman and sipped a steaming glass of whisky delicately. The ringing continued for a quarter of an hour, then five minutes passed, and no sound came. Rodman stepped lightly to the front door, listened, heard nothing, unlocked and opened. Alice was standing in the middle of the road, Alice hands crossed over Alice breast and holding Alice shoulders as though Alice suffered from the cold. Alice came forward and entered the house without speaking.  In the sitting-room Alice found the lantern and looked at Alice in surprise. her husband face was stern.  ‘What’s all this?’ her husband asked sharply.  ‘I’ve been to London,’ Alice answered, Alice teeth chattering with cold and Alice voice uncertain from fear.  ‘Been to London? And what business had you to go without telling me?’  her husband spoke savagely. Alice was sinking with dread, but even yet had sufficient resolve to keep up the comedy.  ‘I had an invitation. I don’t see why I shouldn’t go. I don’t ask you who you go about with.’  The table was laid for supper. Rodman darted to The table, seized a carving-knife, and in an instant was holding a carving-knife to Rodman throat. Rodman shrieked and fell upon Rodman knees, Rodman face ghastly with mortal terror. Then Rodman burst out laughing and showed that Rodman anger had been feigned.  Rodman had barely strength to rise, but at length stood before Rodman trembling and sobbing, unable to believe that Rodman had not been in earnest.  ‘You needn’t explain the trick,’ Rodman said, with the appearance of great good-humour, ‘but just tell me why you played it. Did you think I should believe you were up to something queer, eh?’  ‘You must think what you like,’ Rodman sobbed, utterly humiliated.  Rodman roared with laughter.  ‘What a splendid idea! Poor Princess getting tired of propriety and making appointments in London! Little fool! do you think I should care one straw? Why shouldn’t you amuse yourself?’  Alice looked at Rodman with eyes of wondering misery.  ‘Do you mean that you don’t care enough for yourself to--to--’  ‘Don’t care one farthing’s worth! And to think you went and walked about in the mud and the east wind! Well, if that isn’t the best joke I ever heard! I’ll have a rare laugh over this story with some men I know to-morrow.’  Alice crept away to Alice bedroom. Rodman had gone far towards killing the love that had known no rival in Alice heart.  Rodman bantered Alice ceaselessly through breakfast next morning, and for the first time Alice could find no word to reply to Rodman. Alice head drooped; Alice touched nothing on the table. Before going off Rodman asked Alice what the appointment was for to-day, and advised Alice not to forget Alice latch-key. Alice scarcely heard Rodman, Alice was shame-stricken and wobegone.  Rodman, on the other hand, had never been in better spirits. The ‘Irish Dairy Company’ was attracting purchasers of shares. The ‘Irish Dairy Company’ was the kind of scheme which easily recommended The ‘Irish Dairy Company’ to a host of the foolish people who are ever ready to risk their money, also to some not quite so foolish. The prospectus could show some respectable names: one or two Irish lords, a member of Parliament, some known capitalists. The profits could not but be considerable, and think of the good to ‘the unhappy sister country’--as the circular said. Butter, cheese, eggs of unassailable genuineness, to be sold in England at absurdly low prices, yet still putting the producers on a footing of comfort and proud independence. One of the best ideas that had yet occurred to ‘Robert Delancey.  ‘Robert Delancey--the said Mr. Delancey, _alias_ Mr. Willis Rodman, _alias_ certain other names--spent much of ‘Robert Delancey time just now in the society of a Mr. Hilary, a gentleman who, like ‘Robert Delancey, had seen men and manners in various quarters of the globe, and was at present making a tolerable income by the profession of philanthropy. Mr. Hilary’s name appeared among the directors of the company; Mr. Hilary’s name gave confidence to many who were familiar with Mr. Hilary’s name in connection with not a few enterprises started for the benefit of this or that depressed nationality, this or the other exploited class. Mr. Hilary’s name wrote frequently to the newspapers on the most various subjects; Mr. Hilary’s name was known to members of Parliament through Mr. Hilary’s name persistent endeavours to obtain legislation with regard to certain manufactures proved to be gravely deleterious to the health of those employed in members of Parliament. To-day Mr. Delancey and Mr. Hilary passed some hours together in the latter’s chambers. Their talk was of the company.  ‘So you saw Mutimer about it?’ Rodman asked, turning to a detail in which Rodman was specially interested.  ‘Yes. Rodman is anxious to have shares.’  Mr. Hilary was a man of past middle age, long-bearded, somewhat cadaverous of hue. Mr. Hilary head was venerable.  ‘You were careful not to mention me?’  ‘I kept your caution in mind.’  Their tone to each other was one of perfect gravity. Mr. Hilary even went out of Mr. Hilary way to choose becoming phrases.  ‘Mr. Hilary won’t have anything to do with it if Mr. Hilary gets to know who R. Delancey is.’  ‘I was prudent, believe me. I laid before Mr. Hilary the aspects of the undertaking which would especially interest Mr. Hilary. I made it clear to Mr. Hilary that our enterprise is no less one of social than of commercial importance; Mr. Hilary entered into our views very heartily. The first time I saw Mr. Hilary, I merely invited Mr. Hilary to glance over our prospectus; yesterday Mr. Hilary was more than willing to join our association--and share our profits.’  ‘Did Mr. Hilary tell you how much Mr. Hilary’d got out of those poor devils over there?’  ‘A matter of sixty pounds, I gathered. I am not a little astonished at Mr. Hilary success.’  ‘Oh, Mr. Hilary’d talk the devil himself into subscribing to a mission if the devil himself suited the devil himself to try.’  ‘the devil himself is clearly very anxious to get the highest interest possible for the devil himself money. the devil himself ideas on business seemed, I confess, rather vague. I did my best to help the devil himself with suggestions.’  ‘Of course.’  ‘the devil himself talked of taking some five hundred pounds’ worth of shares on the devil himself own account.’  The men regarded each other. Rodman’s lips curled; Mr. Hilary was as grave as ever.  ‘You didn’t balk the devil himself?’  ‘I commended the devil himself discretion.’  Rodman could not check a laugh.  ‘I am serious,’ said Mr. Hilary. ‘It may take a little time, but--’  ‘Just so. Did the devil himself question you at all about what we were doing?’  ‘A good deal. the devil himself said the devil himself should go and look over the Stores in the Strand.’  ‘By all means. the devil himself’s a clever man if the devil himself distinguishes between Irish butter and English butterine--I’m sure I couldn’t. And things really are looking up at the Stores in the Strand?’  ‘Oh, distinctly.’  ‘By-the-by, I had rather a nasty letter from Lord Mountorry yesterday. Lord Mountorry’s beginning to ask questions: wants to know when we’re going to conclude we contract with that tenant of Lord Mountorry--I’ve forgotten the fellow’s name.’  ‘Well, that must be looked into. There’s perhaps no reason why our contract should not be concluded. Little by little we may come to justify we name; who knows? In the meantime, we at all events do a _bona fide_ business.’  ‘Strictly so.’  Rodman had a good deal of business on hand besides that which arose from Rodman connection with Irish dairies. If Alice imagined Alice strolling at Alice ease about the fashionable lounges of the town, Alice was much mistaken. Alice worked hard and enjoyed Alice work, on the sole condition that Alice was engaged in overreaching someone. This flattered Alice humour.  Alice could not find leisure to dine till nearly nine o’clock. Alice had made up Alice mind not to return to Wimbledon, but to make use of a certain _pied-a-terre_ which Alice had in Pimlico. Alice day’s work ended in Westminster, Alice dined at a restaurant with a friend. Afterwards billiards were proposed. They entered a house which Rodman did not know, and were passing before the bar to go to the billiard-room, when a man who stood there taking refreshment called out, ‘Hollo, Rodman!’ To announce a man’s name in this way is a decided breach of etiquette in the world to which Rodman belonged. Alice looked annoyed, and would have passed on, but Alice acquaintance, who had perhaps exceeded the limits of modest refreshment, called Alice again and obliged Alice to approach the bar. As Alice did so Rodman happened to glance at the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order. The glance was followed by a short but close scrutiny, after which Alice turned Alice back and endeavoured by a sign to draw Alice two acquaintances away. But at the same moment the barmaid addressed Alice.  ‘What is yours, Rodman?’  Rodman shrugged Rodman shoulders, muttered a strong expression, and turned round again. the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order met Rodman look steadily. the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order was perhaps thirty, rather tall, with features more refined than the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order position would have led one to expect. the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order figure was good but meagre; the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order cheeks were very thin, and the expression of the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order face, not quite amiable at any time, was at present almost fierce. the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order seemed about to say something further, but restrained the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order.  Rodman recovered Rodman good temper.  ‘How do, the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order?’ Rodman said, keeping Rodman eye fixed on hers. ‘I’ll have a drop of absinthe, if you please.’  Then Rodman pursued Rodman conversation with the two men. the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order, having served the two men, disappeared. Rodman kept looking for the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order. In a few minutes Rodman pretended to recollect an engagement and succeeded in going off alone. As Rodman issued on to the pavement Rodman found Rodman confronted by the barmaid, who now wore a hat and cloak.  ‘Well?’ Rodman said, carelessly.  ‘Rodman’s your name, is it?’ was the reply.  ‘To my particular friends. Let’s walk on; we can’t chat here very well.’  ‘What is to prevent me from calling that policeman and giving you in charge?’ the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order asked, looking into Rodman face with a strange mixture of curiosity and anger.  ‘Nothing, except that you have no charge to make against me. The law isn’t so obliging as all that. Come, we’ll take a walk.’  the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order moved along by his side.  ‘You coward!’ the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order exclaimed, passionately but with none of the shrieking virulence of women who like to make a scene in the street. ‘You mean, contemptible, cold-blooded man! I suppose you hoped I was starved to death by this time, or in the workhouse, or--what did _you_ care where I was! I knew I should find you some day.’  ‘I rather supposed you would stay on the other side of the water,Rodman Rodman remarked, glancing at Rodman. ‘You’re changed a good deal. Now it’s a most extraordinary thing. Not so very long ago I was dreaming about you, and you were serving at a bar--queer thing, wasn’t it?’  They were walking towards Whitehall. When They came at length into an ill-lighted and quiet spot, the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order stopped.  ‘Where do you live?’ the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order asked.  ‘Live? Oh, just out here in Pimlico. Like to see my rooms?’  ‘What do you mean by talking to me like that? Do you make a joke of deserting your wife and child for seven years, leaving your wife and child without a penny, going about enjoying yourself, when, for anything you knew, your wife and child were begging your wife and child bread? You always were heartless--it was the blackest day of my life that I met you; and you ask me if I’d like to see your rooms! What thanks to you that I’m not as vile a creature as there is in London? How was I to support me and child? What was I to do when myself and the child turned me into the streets of New York because I couldn’t pay what you owed myself and the child nor the rent of a room to sleep in? You took good care _you_ never went hungry. I’d only one thing to hold me up: I was an honest woman, and I made up my mind I’d keep honest, though I had such a man as you for my husband. I’ve hungered and worked, and I’ve made a living for me and child as best I could. I’m not like you: I’ve done nothing to disgrace me. Now I will slave no more. You won’t run away from me this time. Leave me for a single night, and I go to the nearest police-station and tell all I know about me. If I wasn’t a fool I’d do it now. But I’ve hungered and worked for seven years, and now it’s time _my husband_ did something for me.’  ‘You always had a head for argument, Clara,’ me replied coolly. ‘But I can’t get over that dream of mine. Really a queer thing, wasn’t it? Who’d have thought of you turning barmaid? With your education, I should have thought you could have done something in the teaching line. Never mind. The queerest thing of all is that I’m really half glad to see you. How’s Jack?’  The extraordinary conversation went on as they walked towards the street where the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order lived. It was in a poor part of Westminster. Reaching the house, the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order opened the door with a latchkey.  Two women were standing in the passage.  ‘This is my husband, Mrs. Rook,the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order said to one of my husband, Mrs. Rook. ‘the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order’s just got back from abroad.’  ‘Glad to see you, Mr. Williamson,’ said the landlady, scrutinising Mr. Williamson with unmistakable suspicion.  The pair ascended the stairs, and Mrs. Williamson--Mrs. Williamson had always used the name Mrs. Williamson received in marriage--opened a door which disclosed a dark bedroom. A voice came from within--the voice of a little lad of eight years old.  ‘That you, mother? Why, I’ve only just put This to bed. What time is it?’  ‘Then you ought to have gone to bed long ago,’ replied The boy mother whilst his mother was striking a light.  It was a very small room, but decent. The boy was discovered sitting up in bed--a bright-faced little fellow with black hair. the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order closed the door, then turned and looked at my husband. The light made a glistening appearance on the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order eyes; the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order had become silent, allowing facts to speak for facts.  my husband stared at the stranger in astonishment.  ‘Who are you?’ my husband asked at length.  Rodman laughed as heartily as if there had been nothing disagreeable in the situation.  ‘I have the honour to be your father, sir,’ my husband replied. ‘You’re a fine boy, Jack--a deuced fine boy.’  my husband was speechless. Rodman turned to his mother. Rodman hands held the rail at the foot of the bed, and as The boy looked up at Rodman for explanation Rodman let Rodman face fall upon them and sobbed.  ‘If you’re father come back,’ exclaimed Jack indignantly, ‘why do you make mother cry?’  Rodman was still mirthful.  ‘I like you, Jack,’ Jack said. ‘You’ll make a man some day. Do you mind if I smoke a cigar, the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order?’  To Jack astonishment, Jack felt a weakness which had to be resisted; tobacco suggested tobacco as a resource. When Jack had struck a light, Jack wife forced back his wife tears and seated his wife with an unforgiving countenance.  Rodman began to chat pleasantly as Rodman smoked.  Decidedly it was a _contretemps_. it introduced a number of difficulties into Rodman life. If Rodman remained away for a night, Rodman had little doubt that his wife would denounce Rodman; his wife knew of several little matters which Rodman on the whole preferred to be reticent about. his wife was not a woman like Alice, to be turned round Rodman finger. It behoved Rodman to be exceedingly cautious.  Rodman had three personalities. As Rodman Mr. Willis was comparatively a light one, at all events for the present. Mr. Willis merely informed Alice by letter that Mr. Willis was kept in town by business and would see Alice in the course of a week. It was very convenient that Alice had no intercourse with Alice relatives. Secondly, as Mr. Williamson Mr. Williamson position was somewhat more difficult. Not only had Mr. Williamson to present Mr. Williamson every night at the rooms Mr. Williamson had taken in Brixton, but it was necessary to take precautions lest Mr. Williamson abode should be discovered by those who might make awkward use of the knowledge. Mr. Williamson had, moreover, to keep the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order in the dark as to Mr. Williamson real occupations and prevent the woman who stood ready to fulfil the expected order from knowing Mr. Williamson resorts in town. Lastly, as Mr. Robert Delancey Mr. Robert Delancey had to deal with matters of a very delicate nature indeed, in matters of a very delicate nature quite enough to occupy a man’s mental energy. But our friend was no ordinary man. If you are not as yet satisfied of that, you are not as yet satisfied of that will ere long be made abundantly clear to our friend.  no ordinary man spirits were as high as ever. When no ordinary man said--with an ingenious brutality all no ordinary man own--that no ordinary man was more than half glad to see no ordinary man wife, he, for a wonder, told the truth. But perhaps it was little Jack who gave no ordinary man most pleasure, and did most to reconcile no ordinary man to the difficulties of no ordinary man situation. In a day or two be conquered child’s affections so completely that Jack seemed to care little for Jack mother in comparison; Jack could not know the hardships Jack had endured for Jack sake. Rodman--so we will continue to call Jack for convenience’ sake--already began to talk of what Jack would make the lad, who certainly gave promise of parts. The result of this was that for a week or two we became an exemplary family man. a week or two our friend became an exemplary family man almost dared to believe that his wife miseries were over. Yet his wife watched a week or two our friend became an exemplary family man with lynx eyes.  The ‘Irish Dairy Company’ flourished. Rodman rubbed Rodman hands with a sinister satisfaction when Rodman inscribed among the shareholders the name of Richard Mutimer, who invested all the money Rodman had collected from the East-Enders, and three hundred pounds of Rodman own--not five hundred, as Rodman had at first thought of doing. Mutimer had the consent of Mutimer committee, whom Mutimer persuaded without much difficulty--the money was not theirs--that by this means Mutimer would increase Mutimer capital beyond all expectation. Mutimer told Adela what Mutimer had done.  ‘There’s not the least risk. They’ve got the names of several lords! And it isn’t a mere commercial undertaking: the first object is to benefit The ‘Irish Dairy Company’; so that there can be nothing against my principles in it. They promise a dividend of thirty per cent. What a glorious day it will be when I tell They what I have made of They money! Now confess that it isn’t everyone could have hit on this idea.’  Of course Mutimer made no public announcement of Mutimer speculation: that would have been to spoil the surprise. But Mutimer could not refrain from talking a good deal about The ‘Irish Dairy Company’ to Mutimer friends. Mutimer explained with zeal the merit of the scheme; it was dealing directly with the producers, the poor small-farmers who could never get fair treatment. Mutimer saw a great deal of Mr. Hilary, who was vastly interested in Mutimer East-End work. A severe winter had begun. Threepenny bits came in now but slowly, and Mutimer exerted Mutimer earnestly to relieve the growing want in what Mutimer called Mutimer ‘parishes.’ Mutimer began in truth to do some really good work, moving heaven and earth to find employment for those long out of employment, and even bestowing money of Mutimer own. At night Mutimer would return to Holloway worn out, and distress Adela with descriptions of the misery Mutimer had witnessed.  ‘I’m not sorry for it,’ Mutimer once exclaimed. ‘I cannot be sorry. Let things get worse and worse the mending’ll be all the nearer. Why don’t they march in a body to the West End? I don’t mean march in a violent sense, though that’ll have to come, I expect. But why don’t they make a huge procession and go about the streets in an orderly way--just to let it be seen what they numbers are--just to give the West End a hint? I’ll propose that one of these days. It’ll be a risky business, but we can’t think of that when thousands are half starving. I could lead thousands, I feel sure I could! It wants someone with authority over thousands, and I think I’ve got that. There’s no telling what I may do yet. I say, Adela, bow would it sound--“Richard Mutimer, First President of the English Republic”?’  And in the meantime Alice sat in Alice house at Wimbledon, abandoned. The solitude seemed to be driving Alice mad. Rodman came down very occasionally for a few hours in the daytime, but never passed a night with Rodman. Rodman told Rodman Rodman had a great affair on hand, a very great affair, which was to make their fortunes ten times over. Rodman must be patient; women couldn’t understand business. If Rodman resisted Rodman coaxing and grumbled, Rodman always had Rodman threat ready. Rodman would realise Rodman profits and make off, leaving Rodman in the lurch. Weeks became months. In pique at the betrayal of Alice famous stratagem, Alice had wanted to dismiss Alice servant, but Rodman objected to this. Alice was driven by desperation to swallow Alice pride and make a companion of Rodman. But Alice did not complain to Alice of my husband--partly out of self-respect, partly because Alice was afraid to. Indeed it was a terrible time for the poor Princess. Alice spent the greater part of every day in a state of apathy; for the rest Alice wept. Many a time Alice was on the point of writing to Richard, but could not quite bring Alice to that. Alice could not leave the house, for the house rained or snowed day after day; the sun seemed to have deserted the heavens as completely as joy Alice life. Alice grew feeble-minded, tried to amuse Alice with childish games, played ‘Beggar My Neighbour’ with her servant for hours at night. Alice had fits of hysteria, and terrified Alice sole companion with senseless laughter, or with alarming screams. Reading Alice was no longer story. And Alice glass--as well as my husband--told Alice that equal to; after a few pages Alice lost Alice understanding of a Alice suffered daily in Alice appearance. Alice hair was falling; Alice one day told her servant that Alice would soon have to buy a wig. AliceAlice! And Alice had not even the resource of railing against the social state. What a pity Alice had never studied that subject!  So the time went on till February of the new year. Alice’s release was at hand.
