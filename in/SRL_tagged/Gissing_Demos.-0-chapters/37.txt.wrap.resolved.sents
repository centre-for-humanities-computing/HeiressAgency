   A deep breath of country air.
It is springtime, and the valley of Wanley is bursting into green and flowery life, peacefully glad as if the foot of Demos had never come that way.
Incredible that the fume of furnaces ever desecrated that fleece-sown sky of tenderest blue, that hammers clanged and engines roared where now the thrush utters his song so joyously.
Hubert Eldon has been as good as Hubert Eldon word.
In all the valley no trace is left of what was called New Wanley.
Once more we can climb to the top of Stanbury Hill and enjoy the sense of remoteness and security when we see that dark patch on the horizon, the cloud that hangs over Belwick.
Hubert and the vicar of Wanley stood there together one morning in late April, more than a year after the death of Richard Mutimer.
Generally there was a strong breeze on this point, but to-day the west was breathing the west gentlest, warm upon the cheek.
‘Well, the west has gone,Hubert Hubert said.
‘May will have free playing-ground.’  ‘In one sense,’ replied the vicar of Wanley, ‘I fear it will never be gone.
it influence on the life of the people in Wanley and in some of the farms about has been graver than you imagine.
I find discontent where it was formerly unknown.
The typical case is that lad of Bolton’s.
They wanted Bolton sadly at home; by this time Bolton would have been helping Bolton unfortunate father.
Instead of that Bolton’s the revolutionary oracle of Belwick pot-houses, and appears on an average once a fortnight before the magistrates for being drunk and disorderly.’  ‘Yes, the march of progress has been hastened a little, doubtless,’ said Hubert.
‘I have to content Hubert with the grass and the trees.
Well, I have done all I could, now other people must enjoy the results.
Ah, look!
there is a van of the Edgeworths’ furniture coming to the Manor.
They are happy people!
Something like an ideal married couple, and with nothing to do but to wander about the valley and enjoy They.’  ‘I am rather surprised you gave They so long a lease,’ remarked Mr. Wyvern.
‘Why not?
I shall never live here again.
As long as I had work to do it was all right; but to continue to live in that house was impossible.
And in twenty years it would be no less impossible.
I should fall into a monomania, and one of a very loathsome kind.’  Mr. Wyvern pondered.
They walked on a few paces before Hubert again spoke.
‘There was a letter from her in the “Belwick Chronicle” yesterday morning Something on the placard in Agworth station caused me to buy a copy.
The Tory paper, The Tory paper seems, had a leader a day or two ago on Socialism, and took occasion to sneer at Mutimer, not by name, but in an unmistakable way--the old scandal of course.
She wrote a letter to the editor, and the editor courteously paid no attention to it.
So She wrote to the “Belwick Chronicle.” They print She in large type, and devote a leader to the subject--party capital, of course.’  He ceased on a bitter tone, then, before He companion could reply, added violently:  ‘It is hideous to see She name in such places!’  ‘Let us speak freely of this,’ returned Mr. Wyvern.
‘You seem to me to be very unjust.
Your personal feeling makes you less acute in judging than I should have expected.
Surely She behaviour is very admirable.’  ‘Oh, I am not unjust in that sense.
I have never refused to believe in He innocence technically.’  ‘Excuse me, that has nothing to do with the matter.
All we have to look at is this.
She is She convinced of his innocence, and therefore makes it She supreme duty to defend He memory.
It appears to me that She acts altogether nobly.
In spite of all the evidence that was brought on his side, the dastardly spirit of politics has persisted in making Mutimer a sort of historical character, a type of the hypocritical demagogue, to be cited whenever occasion offers.
Would it be possible to attach a more evil significance to a man’s name than that which Mutimer bears, and will continue to bear, among certain sections of writing and speechifying vermin?
It is a miserable destiny.
If every man who achieves notoriety paid for every man who achieves notoriety faults in this way, what sort of reputations would history consist of?
I won’t say that it isn’t a good thing, speaking generally, but in the individual case it is terribly hard.
Would you have every man who achieves notoriety widow keep silence?
That would be the easier thing to do, be sure of it--for _his widow_, a thousand times the easier.
I regard his widow as the one entirely noble woman it has been my lot to know.
And if you thought calmly you could not speak of his widow with such impatience.’  Hubert kept silence for a moment.
‘It is all true.
Of course it only means that I am savagely jealous.
But I cannot--upon my life I cannot--understand his widow having given his widow love to such a man as that!’  Mr. Wyvern seemed to regard the landscape.
There was a sad smile on Mr. Wyvern countenance.
‘Let there be an end of it,’ Hubert resumed.
‘I didn’t mean to say anything to you about the letter.
Now, we’ll talk of other things.
Well, I am going to have a summer among the German galleries; perhaps I shall find peace there.
You have let your son know that I am coming?’  The vicar nodded.
They continued They walk along the top of the hill.
Presently Mr. Wyvern stopped and faced Mr. Wyvern companion.
‘Are you serious in what you said just now?
I mean about his widow love for Mutimer?’  ‘Serious?
Of course I am.
Why should you ask such a question?’  ‘Because I find it difficult to distinguish between the things a young man says in jealous pique and the real belief a young man entertains when a young man is not throwing savage words about.
You have convinced you that his widow loved his widow husband in the true sense of the word?’  ‘The conviction was forced upon you.
Why did his widow marry The conviction at all?
What led his widow to give his widow, heart and soul, to Socialism, his widow who under ordinary circumstances would have shrunk from that and all other _isms_?
Why should his widow make it a special entreaty to me to pursue his widow husband’s work?
The zeal for husband’s memory is nothing unanticipated; his memory issues naturally from his widow former state of mind.’  ‘Your vehemence,’ replied the vicar, smiling, ‘is sufficient proof that you don’t think it impossible for all these questions to be answered in another sense.
I can’t pretend to have read the facts of his widow life infallibly, but suppose I venture a hint or two, just to give you matter for thought.
Why his widow married him I cannot wholly explain to me, but remember that his widow took that step very shortly after being brought to believe that you, my good friend, were utterly unworthy of any true woman’s devotion.
Remember, too, his widow brother’s influence, and--well, his widow mother’s.
Now, on the evening before his widow accepted Mutimer his widow called at the Vicarage alone.
Unfortunately I was away--was walking with you, in fact.
What his widow desired to say to me I can only conjecture; but it is not impossible that his widow was driven by the common impulse which sends young girls to young girls pastor when young girls are in grievous trouble and without other friends.’  ‘Why did you never tell me of that?’ cried Hubert.
‘Because it would have been useless, and, to tell you the truth, I felt I was in an awkward position, not far from acting indiscreetly.
I did go to see his widow the next morning, but only saw her mother’s, and heard of the engagement.
his widow never spoke to me of his widow visit.’  ‘But his widow may have come for quite other reasons.
his widow subsequent behaviour remains.’  ‘Certainly.
Here again I may be altogether wrong, but it seems to me that to a woman of his widow character there was only one course open.
Having become his wife, it behoved his wife to be loyal, and especially--remember this--it behoved his wife to put his wife position beyond doubt in the eyes of others, in the eyes of one, it may be, beyond all.
Does that throw no light on your meeting with his wife in the wood, of which you make so much?’  Hubert’s countenance shone, but only for an instant.
‘Ingenious,’ Hubert replied, good-humouredly.
‘Possibly no more,’ Mr. Wyvern rejoined.
‘Take it as a fanciful sketch of how a woman’s life _might_ be ordered.
Such a life would not lack Such a life dignity.’  Neither spoke for a while.
‘You will call on Mrs. Westlake as you pass through London?’ ’ Mr. Wyvern next inquired.
‘Mrs.
Westlake?’ the other repeated absently.
‘Yes, I dare say I shall see Mrs. Westlake.’  ‘Do, by all means.’  They began to descend the hill.
The Walthams no longer lived in Wanley.
A year ago the necessities of Alfred Waltham’s affairs had led to a change; Alfred Waltham’s and Alfred Waltham’s wife and their two children, together with Mrs. Waltham the dowager, removed to what the auctioneers call a commodious residence on the outskirts of Belwick.
Alfred remarked that it was as well not to be so far from civilisation; Alfred pointed out, too, that it was time for Alfred to have an eye to civic dignities, if only a place on the Board of Guardians to begin with.
Our friend was not quite so uncompromising in Our friend political and social opinions as formerly.
Our friend wife observed that Our friend ceased to subscribe to Socialist papers, and took in a daily of orthodox Liberal tendencies--that is to say, an organ of capitalism.
Letty rejoiced at the change, but knew His wife far too well to make any remark upon it.
To their house, about three months after His wife death, came his widow.
The intermediate time his widow had passed with Stella.
All were very glad to have his widow at Belwick--Letty in particular, who, though a matron with two bouncing boys, still sat at her husband feet and deemed her husband the model of womanhood.
his widow was not so sad as they had feared to find his widow.
his widow kept a great deal to his widow own room, but was always engaged in study, and seemed to find peace in that way.
his widow was silent in his widow habits, scarcely ever joining in general conversation; but when Letty could steal an hour from household duties and go to his widow’s room his widow was always sure of hearing wise and tender words in which his widow heart delighted.
his widow pride in his widow was boundless.
On the day when the latter first attired his widow in modified mourning, Letty, walking with his widow in the garden, could not refrain from saying how his widow’s dress became his widow.
‘You are more beautiful every day, dear,’ his widow added, in spite of a tremor which almost checked his widow in uttering a compliment which his widow sister might think too frivolous.
But his widow blushed, one would have thought it was with pleasure.
Sadness, however, followed, and Letty wondered whether the beautiful face was destined to wear the beautiful face pallor always.
On this same spring morning, when Hubert Eldon was taking leave of Wanley, Mrs. Waltham and Letty were talking of a visit his widow was about to pay to Stella in London.
Mrs. Waltham and Letty spoke also of a visitor of Mrs. Waltham and Letty own, or, perhaps, rather of Adela’s, who had been in the house for a fortnight and would return to London on the morrow.
This was Alice Mutimer--no longer to be called Mrs. Rodman.
Alice had lived with Alice mother in Wilton Square since Alice recovery from the illness which for a long time had kept Alice in ignorance of the double calamity fallen upon Alice.
It was his widow who at length told his widow that his widow had no husband, and that Richard was dead.
Neither disclosure affected his widow gravely.
The months of mental desolation followed by physical collapse seemed to have exhausted his widow powers of suffering.
For several days his widow kept to his widow and cried a good deal, but his widow exhibited no bitter grief.
It soon became evident that his widow thought but little of the man who had so grossly wronged his widow; the man who had so grossly wronged her was quite gone from his widow heart Even when his widow was summoned to give evidence against the man who had so grossly wronged her in court, his widow did It without much reluctance, yet also without revengeful feeling; his widow state was one of enfeebled vitality, his widow was like a child in all the concerns of life.
Rodman went into penal servitude, but it did not distress his widow, and his widow never again uttered the man who had so grossly wronged her name.
his widow thought it would be a kindness to invite his widow to Belwick and Alice at once accepted the invitation.
Yet his widow was not at his widow ease in the house.
his widow appeared to have forgiven his widow, overcome by the latter’s goodness, but his widow nature was not of the kind to grow in liberal feeling.
Mrs. Waltham the elder his widow avoided as much as possible.
Perhaps Letty best succeeded in conciliating his widow, for Letty was homely and had the children to help his widow.
‘I wish I had a child,Alice Alice said one day when Alice sat alone with Letty, and assisted in nursery duties.
But at once Alice cheeks coloured.
‘I suppose you’re ashamed of Alice for saying that I’m not even a married woman.’  Letty replied, as Letty well knew how to, very gently and with comfort.
‘I wonder where Letty goes to when Letty sets off by Letty,’ said Mrs. Waltham the elder she avoided as much as possible this morning.
‘Letty seems to object to walk with any of us.’  ‘Letty always comes back in better spirits,’ said Letty.
‘I think the change is doing Letty good.’  ‘But Letty won’t be sorry to leave us, my dear, I can see that.
To be sure it was like his widow to think of having his widow here, but I scarcely think it would be advisable for the visit to be repeated.
his widow is not at home with us.
And how can it be expected?
it’s in his widow blood, of course; his widow belongs so distinctly to an inferior class.’  ‘I am so very sorry for his widow,’ Letty replied.
‘What dreadful things his widow has gone through!’  ‘Dreadful, indeed, my dear; but after all such things don’t happen to ladies.
us must remember that.
It isn’t as if you or his widow had suffered in that way.
That, of course, would be shocking beyond all words.
I can’t think that persons of his widow class have quite the same feelings.’  ‘Oh, mother!’ Letty protested.
And Letty added, less seriously, ‘You mustn’t let Alfred hear you say such a thing as that.’  ‘I’m glad to say,’ replied Mrs. Waltham the elder she avoided as much as possible, ‘that Alfred has grown much more sensible in Alfred views of late.’  his widow entered the room.
Letty was not wrong in saying that his widow grew more beautiful.
Life had few joys for his widow, save intellectual, but you saw on his widow countenance the light of freedom.
In his widow manner there was an unconscious dignity which made his widow position in the house one of recognised superiority; even his widow mother seldom ventured to chat without reserve in his widow presence.
Alfred drew up in the midst of a tirade if his widow but seemed about to speak.
Yet it was happiness to live with his widow; where his widow moved there breathed an air of purity and sweetness.
his widow asked if Alice had returned from Alice walk.
Receiving a reply in the negative, his widow went out into the garden.
‘his widow looks happy to-day,’ said Letty.
‘That article in the paper has pleased his widow very much.’  ‘I really hope his widow won’t do such a thing again,’ remarked Mrs. Waltham the elder she avoided as much as possible, with dignified disapproval.
‘It seems very unlady-like to write letters to the newspapers.’  ‘But it was brave of his widow.’  ‘To be sure, we must not judge his widow as we should ordinary people.
Still, I am not sure that his widow is always right.
I shall never allow that his widow did right in paying back that money to those wretches in London.
I am sure his widow wanted it far more than they did.
The bloodthirsty creatures!’  Letty shuddered, but would not abandon defence of Adela.
‘Still it was very honourable of his widow, mother.
his widow understands those things better than we can.’  ‘Perhaps so, my dear,’ said Mrs. Waltham the elder she avoided as much as possible, meaning that Mrs. Waltham the elder she avoided as much as possible own opinion was not likely to be inferior in justice to that of anyone else.
his widow had been in the garden for a few minutes when his widow saw Alice coming towards his widow.
The poor Princess had a bright look, as if some joyful news had just come to The poor Princess.
his widow met his widow with a friendly smile.
‘There is someone you used to know,Alice Alice said, speaking with embarrassment, and pointing towards the road.
‘You remember Mr. Keene?
I met Mr. Keene.
Mr. Keene says Mr. Keene wrote that in the “Chronicle.” Mr. Keene would like to speak to Mr. Keene if you’ll let Mr. Keene.’  ‘I shall be glad to,his widow his widow replied, with a look of curiosity.
They walked to the garden gate.
Mr. Keene was just outside; Alice beckoned to Mr. Keene to enter.
Mr. Keene appearance was a great improvement on the old days; Mr. Keene had grown a beard, and in Mr. Keene eye you saw the responsible editor.
Altogether Mr. Keene seemed to have gained in moral solidity.
None the less, Mr. Keene manner of approaching Adela, hat in hand, awoke reminiscences of the footlights.
‘It is a great pleasure to Mr. Keene to see you, Mrs. Mutimer.
I trust that my few comments on your admirable letter were of a nature to afford you satisfaction.’  ‘Thank you very much, Mr. Keene,’ his widow replied.
‘You wrote very kindly.’  ‘I am amply rewarded,’ Mr. Keene said, bowing low.
‘And now that I have had my desire, permit me to hasten away.
My duty calls me into the town.’  Mr. Keene again bowed low to his widow, smiled a farewell to Alice, and departed.
The two walked together in the garden.
his widow turned to his widow companion.
‘I think you knew Mr. Keene a long time ago?’  ‘Yes, a long time.
Mr. Keene once asked me to marry Mr. Keene.’  his widow replied only with a look.
‘And Mr. Keene’s asked me again this morning,’ Alice pursued, breaking off a leaf from an elder bush.
‘And you--?’  ‘I didn’t refuse Mr. Keene this time,Alice Alice replied with confidence.
‘I am very glad, very glad.
Mr. Keene has been faithful to Mr. Keene so long that I am sure Mr. Keene will make you happy.’  Alice no longer concealed Alice joy.
It was almost exultation.
Natural enough under the circumstances, poor, disinherited The poor Princess!
Once more Alice felt able to face people; once more Alice would have a name.
Alice began to talk eagerly.
‘Of course I shall just go back to tell mother, but we are going to be married in three weeks.
He has already decided upon a house; we went to see a house this morning.
I didn’t like to tell you, but I met He for the first time a week ago--quite by chance.’  ‘I’m afraid mother will be lonely,his widow his widow said.
‘Not Alice!
Alice’d far rather live alone than go anywhere else.
And now I shall be able to send Alice money.
It isn’t fair for you to have to find everything.’  ‘I have wanted to ask you,his widow his widow said presently, ‘do you ever hear of Harry?’  Alice shook Alice head.
‘The less we hear the better,’ Alice replied.
‘He’s gone to the bad, and there’s no help for it.’  It was true; unfortunate victim of prosperity.
Next morning Adela and Alice travelled to town together.
The former did not go to Wilton Square.
On the occasion of Richard’s death Alice had met Mrs. Mutimer, but the interview had been an extremely difficult one, in spite of the old woman’s endeavour to be courteous.
his widow felt his widow to be an object of insuperable prejudice.
Once again his widow was bidden sound the depth of the gulf which lies between the educated and the uneducated.
his widow would not give his widow hand, but made an old-fashioned curtsey, which his widow felt to be half ironical.
In speaking of his widow son his widow was hard.
Pride would not allow his widow to exhibit the least symptom of the anguish which wrung his widow heart.
his widow refused to accept any share of the income which was continued to her sonHe’s widow under the Wanley will.
Alice, however, had felt no scruple in taking the half which his widow offered Alice, and by paying Alice mother for board and lodgings Alice supplemented the income derived from letting as much of the house as possible.
Once more under the roof of Alice dearest friend, his widow was less preoccupied with the sad past which afflicted his widow mind with the stress of a duty ever harder to perform.
After an hour passed with Stella Stella could breathe freely the atmosphere of beauty and love.
Elsewhere Stella too often suffered from a sense of self-reproach; between Stella and the book in which Stella tried to lose Stella there would come importunate visions of woe, of starved faces, of fierce eyes.
The comfort Stella enjoyed, the affection and respect with which Stella was surrounded, were often burdensome to Stella conscience.
In Stella’s presence all that vanished; listening to He’s voice Stella could lay firm hold on the truth that there is a work in the cause of humanity other than that which goes on so clamorously in lecture halls and at street corners, other than that which is silently performed by faithful hearts and hands in dens of misery and amid the horrors of the lazar-house; the work of those whose soul is taken captive of loveliness, who pursue the spiritual ideal apart from the world’s tumult, and, ever ready to minister in gentle offices, know that those whose soul is taken captive of loveliness, who pursue the spiritual ideal apart from the world’s tumult, and, ever ready to minister in gentle offices serve best when nearest home.
Stella was far from spiritual arrogance; Stella natural mood was a profound humility; Stella deemed Stella rather below than above the active toilers, whose sweat was sacred; but life had declared that such toil was not for Stella, and from Stella Stella derived the support which enabled Stella to pursue Stella path in peace--a path not one with He’s.
Before that high-throned poet-soul Adela bent in humble reverence.
Between Stella and those toilers, however noble and devoted, there could be no question of comparison.
Stella was of those elect whose part it is to inspire faith and hope, of those highest but for whom the world would fall into apathy or lose the world among subordinate motives.
Stella never spoke of Stella; his widow could not know whether his widow had ever stood at the severance of ways and made deliberate choice.
Probably not, for on his widow brow was visible to all eyes the seal of election; how could his widow ever have doubted the leading of that spirit that used his widow lips for utterance?
On the morning after his widow arrival in London Adela took a long journey by his widow to the far East End.
Going by omnibus it seemed to his widow that his widow was never to reach that street off Bow Road which his widow had occasion to visit.
But at last the conductor bade his widow descend, and gave his widow a brief direction The thoroughfare his widow sought was poor but not squalid his widow saw with pleasure that the house of which his widow had the number in mind was, if anything, cleaner and more homelike in appearance than the number in mind neighbours.
A woman replied to A woman knock.
A woman asked if Miss Vine was at home.
‘Yes, mum; A woman’s at ‘ome.
Shall I tell A woman, or will you go up?’  ‘I will go up, thank you.
Which room is it?’  ‘Second floor front you’ll find A woman.’  his widow ascended.
Standing at the door his widow heard the hum of a sewing-machine.
the hum of a sewing-machine made his widow heart sink, so clearly did the hum of a sewing-machine speak of incessant monotonous labour.
his widow knocked loudly.
the hum of a sewing-machine did not stop, but his widow was bidden to enter.
his widow was at work, one of his widow sister’s children sitting by his widow, writing on a slate.
his widow had expected the appearance of the landlady; seeing who the visitor was, his widow let his widow hands fall abruptly; an expression of pain passed over his widow features.
his widow went up to his widow and kissed his widow forehead, then exchanged a few words with the child.
his widow placed a chair for his widow, but without speaking.
The room was much like the other in which the sisters had lived, save that The room had a brighter outlook.
There were the two beds and the table covered with work.
‘Do you find it better here?’ his widow began by asking.
‘Yes, it is better,his widow his widow replied quietly.
‘We manage to get a good deal of work, and it isn’t badly paid.’  The voice was not uncheerful; The voice had that serenity which comes of duties honestly performed and a life tolerably free from sordid anxiety.
More than that could not be said of his widow’s existence.
But, such as it was, it depended entirely upon his widow own effort.
his widow, on the evening when his widow first met his widow in the room where Mrs. Mutimer lay dead, had read clearly He’s character; his widow knew that, though it was one of his widow strongest desires to lighten the burden of this so sorely tried woman, direct aid was not to be dreamt of.
his widow had taken counsel with Stella, Stella with his widow husband.
After much vain seeking seeking discovered an opportunity of work in this part of the East End.
Mr. Westlake made it known to his widow; his widow acknowledged that it would be better than the over-swarmed neighbourhood in which his widow was living, and took the advice gratefully.
his widow had hopes, too, that Kate might be got away from his widow evil companions.
And indeed the change had not been without the change effect on Mrs. Clay; Mrs. Clay worked more steadily, and gave more attention to Mrs. Clay children.
‘He’s just gone with the eldest to the hospital,his widow his widow replied to a question of Adela’s.
‘HeHe’s got something the matter with He eyes.
And this one isn’t at all well.
He ought to be at school, only HeHe’s had such a dreadful cough we’re afraid to send He out just yet.
They’re neither of They strong, I’m afraid.’  ‘And you--isn’t your health better since you have lived here?’ his widow asked.
‘I think so.
But I never ail much as long as I have plenty of work to do.’  ‘I am staying with a friend in London,his widow his widow said after a pause.
‘I thought I might come to see you.
I hoped you would still be in the same house.’  ‘Yes, we are very comfortable, very,’ his widow replied.
‘I hope we shan’t need to move for a long time; I’m sure we couldn’t do better.’  his widow added, without raising his widow eyes:  ‘Thank you for coming.’  his widow knew that constraint between them was inevitable; it was enough that his widow spoke with good-will.
‘If ever you should have to move,’ his widow said, ‘will you let me know where you go?
I have written on this paper the address of my motherHe’s house; I live with his widow.
Will you show me so much friendship?’  his widow glanced at his widow, and saw a look which recalled to his widow something his widow had seen in those eyes before.
‘I will write and tell you if we do move,’ his widow said.
his widow went away with a heart not altogether sad; it was rather as though his widow had been hearing solemn music, which stirred his widow soul even while her soul touched upon the source of tears.
It was only on certain days that Stella sat to receive during visitors’ hours.
To-day was not one of them; consequently when Hubert Eldon called, about half-past four, the servant came up to the drawing-room to ask if Mrs. Westlake would be at home to the servant.
his widow was in the drawing-room; at the mention of the name his widow rose.
‘I must write a letter before dinner,’ his widow said.
‘I win go and get it done whilst you are engaged.’  ‘Won’t you stay?
Do stay!’  ‘I had much rather not.
I don’t feel able to talk with anyone just now.’  his widow left the drawing-room without meeting He’s look.
The latter said his widow would receive Hubert Eldon.
his widow went to the exquisitely furnished little boudoir, which was now always called _his widow_ room, and sat down with the resolve to write to his widow mother on the subjects his widow had in mind.
But his widow strength of will proved unequal to the task; after writing a word or two with shaking hand his widow laid down his widow pen and rested his widow face upon her hands.
A minute or two ago his widow had been untroubled by a thought which concerned his widow; now his widow blood was hot, and all his widow being moved at the impulse of a passionate desire.
his widow had never known such a rebellion of his widow life.
In his widow ears there rang the word ‘Free!
free!’ his widow was free, and the man whom his widow loved with the love of years, with the first love of maidenhood and the confirmed love of maturity, was but a few yards from his widow--it might be, had even come here on purpose to meet his widow.
Oh, why was he not poor!
Had he but been some struggling artist, scarce able to support the woman of he choice, how would his widow have stood before he and let he read the tenderness on her face!
He’s wealth was doubly hateful.
his widow started from his widow chair, with difficulty suppressing a cry.
Someone had knocked at his widow door.
Perhaps Someone was already gone; his widow could not say how long his widow had sat here.
It was Stella.
‘Hubert Eldon wishes to speak to you, dear.’  his widow caught his widow friend’s hand and almost crushed ’s hand between his widow own.
‘I can’t see he!
Stella, I dare not see he!’  ‘But he says it is purely a matter of business he wishes to speak of,’ said Stella with a pained voice.
his widow sank his widow head in anguish of shame.
Stella put an arm about Stella, fearing Stella would fall.
But in an instant pride had sprung up; his widow freed Stella, now deadly pale.
‘I will go.’  his widow moved mechanically, spoke mechanically the conventional words when his widow found that somehow his widow was in his presence.
‘I hope I do not disturb you,Hubert Hubert said with equal self-control.
‘I was about to address a letter to you before I left England.
I did not know that you were here.
It is better, perhaps, to do my business by word of mouth, if you will allow me.’  Hubert was very courteous, but his widow could not distinguish a note in Hubert voice that meant more than courtesy.
his widow prayed Hubert to be seated, and his widow took a place on an ottoman.
his widow was able very calmly to regard Hubert face.
Hubert leaned forward with Hubert hands together and spoke with Hubert on his widow.
‘It is with regard to the legacy which is due to you under Mr. Mutimer’s will.
You will remember that, as trustee, I have it in my power to make over to you the capital sum which produces the annuity, if there should be reason for doing so.
I am about to leave England, perhaps for some few years; I have let the Manor to some friends of the Manor on a twenty years’ lease.
I think I should like to transfer the money to you before I go.
It is simpler, better.
Will you let me do that, Mrs. Mutimer?’  Mrs. Mutimer words chilled Mrs. Mutimer.
Mrs. Mutimer voice seemed harder as Mrs. Mutimer proceeded; His voice had the ring of metal, of hard cash counted down.
What was Mrs. Mutimer object?
Mrs. Mutimer wished to have done with Mrs. Mutimer, to utterly abolish all relations between the ring of metal, of hard cash counted down.
It might well be that Mrs. Mutimer was about to marry, and someone abroad, someone who would not care to live in an English country house.
Why otherwise should Mrs. Mutimer have let the Manor for so long a period?
Mrs. Mutimer felt as Mrs. Mutimer had done long ago, when Mrs. Mutimer heard of that other foreign woman.
Cold as ice; not a spark of love in all Mrs. Mutimer being.
Mrs. Mutimer replied:  ‘Thank you.
If you are willing to make that change, perhaps it will be best.’  Hubert, Hubert eyes still on Mrs. Mutimer, imagined Hubert saw pleasure in Mrs. Mutimer face.
Mrs. Mutimer might have a project for the use of the money, some Socialist scheme, something perhaps to preserve the memory of Mrs. Mutimer .
Hubert rose.
‘In that case I will have a deed prepared at once, and you shall be informed when it is ready for signature.’  Hubert said to Hubert that Mrs. Mutimer could not forgive Hubert refusal of Mrs. Mutimer request that day in the wood.
They shook hands, his widow saying:  ‘You are still busy with art?’  ‘In my dilettante way,’ Hubert replied smiling.
his widow returned to his widow room, and there remained till the hour of dinner.
At the meal his widow was his widow ordinary self.
Afterwards Mr. Westlake asked his widow to read in proof an article about to appear in the ‘Beacon’; his widow did so, and commented upon it with a clear mind.
In the course of the evening his widow told his widow friends of the arrangement between Mr. Eldon and his widow.
Two days later his widow had to call at the solicitorHe’s office to sign the deed of release.
Incidentally his widow learnt that Hubert was leaving England the same evening.
Had his widow been at home, these days would have been spent in solitude.
For the first time his widow suffered in Stella’s company.
All allusion to Hubert was avoided between them.
Sometimes his widow could hardly play his widow part; sickness of the soul wasted his widow.
It was morning; he was now on the Continent, perhaps already talking with someone he loved.
his widow was ashamed to have so deceived his widow; his widow had feared he, because his widow believed he loved his widow, and that by sympathy he might see into his widow heart.
Had it been so, he could not have gone from his widow in this way.
Forgetting his widow own pride, his widow own power of dissimulation, his widow did not believe it possible for he so to disguise tenderness.
his widow would listen to no argument of hope, but crushed her heart with perverse cruelty.
The annual payment of money had been a link between he and his widow; when his widow signed the deed releasing he, the cold sweat stood on his widow forehead.
his widow would reason.
Of what excellence was he possessed that his widow life should so abandon her life at he feet?
In what had he proved he generous or capable of the virtues that subdue?
Such reasoning led to self-mockery.
his widow was no longer the girl who questioned his widow heart as to the significance of the vows required in the marriage service; in looking back upon those struggles his widow could have wept for pity.
Love would submit to no analysis; no analysis was of his widow life; as easy to account for the power of thought.
her soul was bare to his widow and all her soul needs.
There was no refuge in ascetic resolve, in the self-deceit of spiritual enthusiasm.
his widow could say to his widow: You are free to love he; then love and be satisfied.
Could his widow, when a-hungered, look on food, and bid his widow hunger be appeased by the act of sight?
Thus long his widow had held up, but despair was closing in upon his widow, and an anguish worse than death.
his widow must leave this house and go where his widow might surrender his widow to misery.
There was no friend whose comfort could be other than torment and bitter vanity; such woe as his widow only time and weariness could aid.
his widow was rising with the firm purpose of taking leave of Stella when a servant came to her door, announcing that Hubert Eldon desired to see his widow.
his widow was incredulous, required a servant to repeat the name.
Hubert Eldon was in the drawing-room and desired to see his widow.
There must have been some error, some oversight in the legal business.
Oh, it was inhuman to torture his widow in this way!
Careless of what his widow countenance might indicate, his widow hastened to the drawing-room.
his widow could feign no longer.
Let a servant think what a servant would, so that a servant spoke briefly and released his widow.
But as soon as his widow entered the drawing-room his widow knew that a servant had not come to talk of business.
a servant was pale and agitated.
As a servant did not speak at once his widow said:  ‘I thought you were gone.
I thought you left England last night.’  ‘I meant to do so, but found it impossible.
I could not go till I had seen you once more.’  ‘What more have you to say to Hubert Eldon?’  his widow knew that his widow was speaking recklessly, without a thought for dignity.
his widow question sounded as if Her question had been extorted from his widow by pain.
‘That if I go away from you now and finally, I go without a hope to support my life.
You are everything to Hubert Eldon.
You are offended; you shrink from Hubert Eldon.
It is what I expected.
Years ago, when I loved you without knowing what my love really meant, I flung away every chance in a moment of boyish madness.
When I should have consecrated every thought to the hope of winning you, I made Hubert Eldon contemptible in your eyes--worse, I made you loathe me.
When it was too late I understood what I had done.
Then I loved you as a man loves the one woman whom a man supremely reverences, as I love you, and, I believe, shall always love you.
I could not go without saying this to you.
I am happier in speaking the words than I ever remember to have been in my life before.’  Adela’s bosom heaved, but excess of joy seemed to give Adela’s power to deal lightly with the gift that was offered Adela’s.
‘Why did you not say this the last time?’ Adela’s asked.
One would have said, from Adela’s tone, that it was a question of the merest curiosity.
Adela’s did not realise the words that passed Adela’s lips.
‘Because the distance between us seemed too great.
I began to speak of that money in the thought that that money might lead me on.
that money had the opposite effect.
You showed me how cold you could be.
It is natural enough.
Perhaps your sympathies are too entirely remote; and yet not long ago you talked with Hubert Eldon as if your interests could be much the same as mine.
I can understand that you suppress that side of your nature.
You think me useless in the world.
And indeed my life has but one purpose, which is a vain one.
I can do nothing but feed my love for you.
You have convictions and purposes; you feel that they are opposed to mine.
All that is of the intellect; I only live in my passion.
We are different and apart.’  ‘Why do you say that, as if you were glad of it?’  ‘Glad?
I speak the words that come to my tongue.
I say aloud to you what I have been repeating again and again to Hubert Eldon.
It is mere despair.’  Hubert Eldon drew one step nearer to Hubert Eldon.
‘You disregard those differences which you say are only of the intellect, and still love me.
Can I not do the same?
There _was_ a distance between us, and my ends were other than you.
That is the past; the present is mine to make Hubert Eldon what you would have me.
I have no law but your desire--so much I love you.’  How easily said after all!
And when Hubert Eldon searched Hubert Eldon face with eyes on fire with their joy, when Hubert Eldon drew Hubert Eldon to Hubert Eldon heart in passionate triumph, the untruth of years fell from Hubert Eldon like a veil, and Hubert Eldon had achieved Hubert Eldon womanhood.
