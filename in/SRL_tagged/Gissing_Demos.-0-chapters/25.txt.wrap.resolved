   Adela and Adela husband did not return from Belwick till eight o’clock in the evening. In the first place Mr. Yottle had to be sent for from a friend’s house in the country, where Mr. Yottle was spending Sunday; then there was long waiting for a train back to Agworth. The Rodmans, much puzzled to account for the disorder, postponed dinner. Adela, however, dined alone, and but slightly, though Adela had not eaten since breakfast. Then fatigue overcame Adela. Adela slept an unbroken sleep till sunrise.  On going down next morning Adela found ‘Arry alone in the dining-room; Arry was standing at the window with hands in pocket, and, after a glance round, averted Arry face again, a low growl Arry only answer to Adela morning salutation. Mr. Rodman was the next to appear. Mr. Rodman shook hands as usual. In Mr. Rodman ‘I hope you are well?’ there was an accent of respectful sympathy. Personally, Mr. Rodman seemed in Mr. Rodman ordinary spirits. Mr. Rodman proceeded to talk of trifles, but in such a tone as Mr. Rodman might have used had there been grave sickness in the house. And presently, with yet lower voice and a smile of good-humoured resignation, Mr. Rodman said--  ‘Our journey, I fear, must be postponed.’  Adela smiled, not quite in the same way, and briefly assented.  ‘Alice is not very well,Mr. Rodman Mr. Rodman then remarked. ‘I advised Alice to have breakfast upstairs. I trust you excuse Alice?’  Mutimer made Mutimer appearance. Mutimer just nodded round, and asked, as Mutimer seated Mutimer at table--  ‘Who’s been letting Freeman loose? Mutimer’s running about the garden.’  The dog furnished a topic for a few minutes’ conversation, then there was all but unbroken silence to the end of the meal. ’s face expressed nothing in particular, unless it were a bad night. Mr. Rodman kept up Mr. Rodman smile, and, eating little Mr. Rodman, devoted Mr. Rodman to polite waiting upon Adela. When Mr. Rodman rose from the table, Mr. Rodman said to Mr. Rodman brother--  ‘You’ll go down as usual. I shall be at the office in half-an-hour.’  Adela presently went to the drawing-room. Adela was surprised to find Alice sitting there. Mr. Rodman had clearly not enjoyed the unbroken rest which gave Adela Mr. Rodman appearance of freshness and calm; Mr. Rodman eyes were swollen and red, Mr. Rodman lips hung like those of a fretful child that has tired her lips with sobbing, Mr. Rodman hair was carelessly rolled up, Mr. Rodman attire slatternly. Mr. Rodman sat in sullen disorder. Seeing Adela, Mr. Rodman dropped her eyes, and her lips drew themselves together. Adela hesitated to approach Mr. Rodman, but was moved to do so by sheer pity.  ‘I’m afraid you’ve had a bad night,’ Mr. Rodman said kindly.  ‘Yes, I suppose I have,’ was the ungracious reply.  Adela stood before Mr. Rodman for a moment, but could find nothing else to say. Adela was turning when Alice looked up, her eyes almost glaring, Adela breast shaken with uncontrollable passion.  ‘I think you might have had some consideration,’ Adela exclaimed. ‘If you didn’t care to speak a word for yourself, you might have thought about others. What are we to do, I. should like to know?’  Adela was struck with consternation. Adela had been prepared for petulant bewailing, but a vehement outburst of this kind was the last thing Adela could have foreseen, above all to have it directed against Adela.  ‘What do you mean, Alice?’ Alice said with pained surprise.  ‘Why, it’s all your doing, I suppose,’ the other pursued, in the same voice. ‘What right had you to let him go off in that way without saying a word to us? If the truth was known, I expect you were at the bottom of the truth; him wouldn’t have been such a fool, whatever him says. What right had you, I’d like to know?’  Adela calmed Adela as Adela listened. Adela surprise at the attack was modified and turned into another channel by Alice’s words.  ‘Has Richard told you what passed between us?’ Adela inquired. It cost Adela nothing to speak with unmoved utterance; the difficulty was not to seem too indifferent.  ‘Richard’s told us as much as Richard thought fit. Richard duty! I like that! As if you couldn’t have stopped Richard, if you’d chosen! You might have thought of other people.’  ‘Did Richard tell you that I tried to stop Richard?’ Adela asked, with the same quietness of interrogation.  ‘Why, did you?’ cried Alice, looking up scornfully.  ‘No.’  ‘Of course not! Talk about duty! I should think that was plain enough duty. I only wish Richard’d come to me with Richard talk about duty. It’s a duty to rob people, I suppose? Oh, I understand _Richard_ well enough. It’s an easy way of getting out of Richard difficulties; as well lose Richard money this way as any other. Richard always thinks of Richard first, trust Richard! Richard’ll go down to New Wanley and make a speech, no doubt, and show off--with Richard duty and all the rest of New Wanley! What’s going to become of me? You’d no right to let Richard go before telling us.’  ‘You would have advised Richard to say nothing about the will?’  ‘Advised Richard!’ she laughed angrily. ‘I’d have seen if I couldn’t do something more than advise.’  ‘I fear you wouldn’t have succeeded in making your brother act dishonourably,’ Adela replied.  It was the first sarcasm that had ever passed ’ Adela lips, and as soon as it was spoken ’ Adela turned to leave the room, fearful lest ’ Adela might say things which would afterwards degrade ’ Adela in ’ Adela own eyes. ’ Adela body quivered. As ’ Adela reached the door Rodman opened Her body and entered. Rodman bowed to let ’ Adela pass, searching ’ Adela face the while.  When ’ Adela was gone Rodman approached to Alice, whom Rodman had at once observed:  ‘What have you been up to?’ Rodman asked sternly.  ’ Adela head was bent before Rodman, and ’ Adela gave no answer.  ‘Can’t you speak? What’s made ’ Adela look like that? Have you been quarrelling with ’ Adela?’  ‘Quarrelling?’  ‘You know what I mean well enough. Just tell me what you said. I thought I told you to stay upstairs? What’s been going on?’  ‘I told ’ Adela ’ Adela ought to have let us know,’ replied Alice, timorous, but affecting the look and voice of a spoilt child.  ‘Then you’ve made a fool of yourself!’ he exclaimed with subdued violence. ‘You’ve got to learn that when I tell you to do a thing you do it--or I’ll know the reason why! You’d no business to come out of your room. Now you’ll just find ’ Adela and apologise. You understand? You’ll go and beg ’ Adela pardon at once.’  Alice raised Alice eyes in wretched bewilderment.  ‘Beg ’ Adela pardon?’ ’ Adela faltered. ‘Oh, how can I? Why, what harm have I done, Willis? I’m sure I shan’t beg her pardon.’  ‘You won’t? If you talk to me in that way you shall go down on your knees before ’ Adela. You won’t?’  Willis voice had such concentrated savagery in His voice suppression that Alice shrank back in terror.  ‘Willis! How can you speak so! What have I done?’  ‘You’ve made a confounded fool of yourself, and most likely spoilt the last chance you had, if you want to know. In future, when I say a thing understand that I mean it; I don’t give orders for nothing. Go and find ’ Adela and beg her pardon. I’ll wait here till you’ve done it.’  ‘But I _can’t_! Willis, you won’t force me to do that? I’d rather die than humble me to ’ Adela.’  ‘Do you hear me?’  ’ Adela stood up, almost driven to bay. her eyes were wet, ’ Adela poor, crumpled prettiness made a deplorable spectacle.  ‘I can’t, I can’t! Why are you so unkind to me? I have only said what any one would. I hate ’ Adela! My lips won’t speak the words. You’ve no right to ask me to do such a thing.’  ’ Adela wrist was caught in a clutch that seemed to crush the muscles, and ’ Adela was flung back on to the chair. Terror would not let the scream pass ’ Adela lips: ’ Adela lay with open mouth and staring eyes.  Rodman looked at ’ Adela for an instant, then seemed to master Rodman fury and laughed.  ‘That doesn’t improve your beauty. Now, no crying out before you’re hurt. There’s no harm done. Only you’ve to learn that I mean what I say, that’s all. Now I haven’t hurt you, so don’t pretend.’  ‘Oh, you _have_ hurt me!’ ’ Adela sobbed wretchedly, with ’ Adela fingers round ’ Adela injured wrist. ‘I never thought you could be so cruel. Oh, my hand! What harm have I done? And you used to say you’d never be unkind to me, never! Oh, how miserable I am! Is this how you’re going to treat me? As if I could help this! Willis, you won’t begin to be cruel? Oh, my hand!’  ‘Let me look at this. Pooh, what’s amiss?’ what’s spoke all at once in what’s usual good-natured voice. ‘Now go and find Adela, whilst I wait here.’  ‘You’re going to force me to do that?’  ‘You’re going to do it. Now don’t make me angry again.’  Adela rose, frightened again by what’s look. Adela took a step or two, then turned back to what’s.  ‘If I do this, will you be kind to me, the same as before?’  ‘Of course I will. You don’t take me for a brute?’  Adela held Adela bruised wrist to what’s.  ‘Will you--will you kiss it well again?’  The way in which Adela said it was as nearly pathetic as anything from poor Alice could be. Adela misery was so profound, and this childish forgiveness of an outrage was so true a demonstration of womanly tenderness which Adela character would not allow to be noble. Adela laughed rather uneasily, and did Adela bidding with an ill grace. But yet Adela could not go.  ‘You’ll promise never to speak--’  ‘Yes, yes, of course I promise. Come back to me. Mind, shall know how you did it.’  ‘But why? What is Adela to us?’  ‘I’ll tell you afterwards.’  There was a dawning of jealousy in Adela eyes.  ‘I don’t think you ought to make your wife lower herself--’  her husband brow darkened.  ‘Will you do as I tell you?’  your wife moved towards the door, stopped to dry your wife wet cheeks, half looked round. What your wife saw sped your wife on your wife way.  Adela was just descending the stairs, dressed to go out. Alice let Alice go past without speaking, but followed Alice through the hall and into the garden. Adela turned, saying gently--  ‘Do you wish to speak to me?’  ‘I’m sorry I said those things. I didn’t mean it. I don’t think it was your fault.’  The other smiled; then in that voice which Stella had spoken of as full of forgiveness--  ‘No, it is not my fault, Alice. it couldn’t be otherwise.’  ‘Don’t think of it another moment.’  Alice would gladly have retreated, but durst not omit what seemed to Alice the essential because the bitterest words.  ‘I beg your pardon.’  ‘No, no!’ exclaimed Adela quickly. ‘Go and lie down a little; you look so tired. Try not to be unhappy, your husband will not let harm come to your husband.’  Alice returned to the house, hating Alice sister-in-law with a perfect hatred.  The hated one took Alice way into New Wanley. Alice had no pleasant mission--that of letting Alice mother and Letty know what had happened. The latter Alice found in the garden dancing Alice baby-boy up and down in the sunlight. Letty did not look very matronly, Letty must be confessed; but what Letty lacked in mature dignity was made up in blue-eyed and warm-checked happiness. At the sight of Adela Letty gave a cry of joy.  ‘Why, mother’s just getting ready to go and say good-bye to mother. As soon as mother comes down and takes this little rogue I shall just slip my own things on. We didn’t think you’d come here.’  ‘We’re not going to-day,’ Adela replied, playing with her baby-boy’s face.  ‘Not going?’  ‘Business prevents Richard.’  ‘How you frightened We by leaving church yesterday! I was on my way to ask about mother, but Mr. Wyvern met me and said there was nothing the matter. And you went to Agworth, didn’t you?’  ‘To Belwick. We had to see Mr. Yottle.’  Mrs. Waltham issued from the house, and explanations were again demanded.  ‘Could you give baby to the nurse for a few minutes?’ Adela asked Letty. ‘I should like to speak to you and mother quietly.’  The arrangement was effected and all three went into the sitting-room. There ’ Adela explained in simple words all that had come to pass; emotionless herself, but the cause of utter dismay in ’ Adela hearers. When ’ Adela ceased there was blank silence.  Mrs. Waltham was the first to find ’ Adela voice.  ‘But surely Mr. Eldon won’t take everything from Mr. Eldon? I don’t think Mr. Eldon has the power to--it wouldn’t be just; there must be surely some kind of provision in the law for such a thing. What did Mr. Yottle say?’  ‘Only that Mr. Eldon could recover the whole estate.’  ‘the whole estate exclaimed Mrs. Waltham eagerly. ‘But not the money?’  Adela smiled.  ‘the whole estate includes the money, mother. the whole estate means everything.’  ‘Oh, Adela!’ sighed Letty, who sat with Adela hands on Adela lap, bewildered.  ‘But surely not Rodman’s settlement?’ cried the elder lady, who was rapidly surveying the whole situation.  ‘Everything,’ affirmed Adela.  ‘But what an extraordinary, what an unheard-of thing! Such injustice I never knew! Oh, but Mr. Eldon is a gentleman--Mr. Eldon can never exact Mr. Eldon legal rights to the full extent. Mr. Eldon has too much delicacy of feeling for that.’ Adela glanced at mother with a curious openness of look--the expression which by apparent negation of feeling reveals feeling of special significance. Mrs. Waltham caught the glance and checked Mrs. Waltham flow of speech.  ‘Oh, Mr. Eldon could never do that!’ Mrs. Waltham murmured the next moment, in a lower key, clasping her hands together upon Mrs. Waltham knees. ‘I am sure Mr. Eldon wouldn’t.’  ‘You must remember, mother,’ remarked Adela with reserve, ‘that ’s disposition cannot affect us.’  ‘My dear child, what I meant was this: it is impossible for My dear child to go to law with your husband to recover the uttermost farthing. How are you to restore money that is long since spent? and it isn’t as if it had been spent in the ordinary way--it has been devoted to public purposes. Mr. Eldon will of course take all these things into consideration. And really one must say that it is very strange for a wealthy man to leave a wealthy man property entirely to strangers.’  ‘Not entirely,’ put in Adela rather absently.  ‘A hundred and seven pounds a year!’ exclaimed mother protestingly. ‘My dear love, what _can_ be done with such a paltry sum as that!’  ‘We must do a good deal with a good deal, mother. It will be all we have to depend upon until Richard finds--finds some position.’  ‘But you are not going to leave the Manor at once?’  ‘As soon as ever we can. I don’t know what arrangement my husband is making. We shall see Mr. Yottle again to-morrow.’  ‘Adela, this is positively shocking! It seems incredible I never thought such things could happen. No wonder you looked white when you went out of church. How little I imagined! But you know you can come here at any moment. You can sleep with me, or we’ll have another bed put up in the sitting-room. Oh, dear; oh, dear! It will take me a long time to understand it. my husband could not possibly object to your living here till my husband found you a suitable home. What _will_ Alfred say? Oh, you must certainly come here. I shan’t have a moment’s’ rest if you go away somewhere whilst things are in this dreadful state.’  ‘I don’t think that will be necessary,’ Adela ’ Adela replied with a reassuring smile. ‘It might very well have happened that we had nothing at all, not even the hundred pounds; but a wife can’t run away for reasons of that kind--can a wife, Letty?’  Letty gazed with a wife eyes of loving pity, and sighed, ‘I suppose not, dear.’  ’ Adela sat with them for only a few minutes more. ’ Adela did not feel able to chat at length on a crisis such as this, and the tone of mother’s sympathy was not soothing to ’ Adela. Mrs. Waltham had begun to put a handkerchief to Mrs. Waltham eyes.  ‘You mustn’t take it to heart,’ Adela ’ Adela said as ’ Adela bent and kissed ’ Adela cheek. ‘You can’t think how little it troubles me--on my own account. Letty, I look to Letty to keep mother cheerful. Only think what numbers of poor creatures would dance for joy if they had a hundred a year left they! We must be philosophers, you see. I couldn’t shed a tear if I tried ever so hard. Good-bye, dear mother!’  Mrs. Waltham did not rise, but Letty followed Mrs. Waltham friend into the hall. Mrs. Waltham had been very silent and undemonstrative; now Mrs. Waltham embraced Adela tenderly. There was still something of the old diffidence in Mrs. Waltham manner, but the effect of Mrs. Waltham motherhood was discernible. Adela was childless--a circumstance in itself provocative of a gentle sense of protection in Letty’s heart.  ‘You’ll let We see you every day, darling?’  ‘As often as I can, Letty. Don’t let mother get low-spirited. There’s nothing to grieve about.’  Letty returned to the sitting-room; Mrs. Waltham was still pressing a handkerchief on this cheek and that alternately.  ‘How wonderful Mrs. Waltham is!’ Letty exclaimed. ‘I feel as if I could never again fret over little troubles.’  ‘Adela has a strong character,’ assented mother with mournful pride.  Letty, unable to sit long without Letty baby, fetched Letty from the nurse’s arms. The infant’s luncheon-hour had arrived, and the nourishment was still of Letty’s own providing. It was strange to see on Mrs. Waltham face the slow triumph of this ineffable bliss over the grief occasioned by the recent conversation. Mrs. Waltham had floated into a stream of talk.  ‘Now, what a strange thing it is!’ Mrs. Waltham observed, after many other reflections, and when the sound of Mrs. Waltham own voice had had time to soothe. ‘On the very morning of the wedding I had the most singular misgiving, a feeling I couldn’t explain. One would almost think I had foreseen this very thing. And you know very well, my dear, that the marriage troubled me in many ways. It was not _the_ match for Adela, but then--. Adela, as you say, has a strong character; a strong character is not very easy to reason with. I tried to make both sides of the question clear to a strong character. But then a strong character prejudice against Mr. Eldon was very strong, and how naturally, poor child! Young people don’t like to trust to time; Young people think everything must be done quickly. If a strong character had been one to marry for reasons of interest she had been one to marry for reasons of interest might look like a punishment; but then she had been one to marry for reasons of interest was so far otherwise. How much better she had been one to marry for reasons of interest would have been to wait a few years! One really never knows what is going to happen. Young people really ought to trust others’ experience.’  Letty was only lending half an ear. The general character of Letty mother-in-law’s monologues did not encourage much attention. a strong character was conscious of a little surprise, even now and then of a mild indignation; but the baby sucking at a strong character breast lulled a strong character into a sweet maternal apathy. a strong character could only sigh from time to time and wonder whether it was a good thing or the contrary that ’ Adela had no baby in ’ Adela trials.
