   Adela allowed a week to pass before speaking of    Adela desire to visit Mrs. Westlake. In Mutimer a fit of sullenness had followed upon his settlement in lodgings. his was away from home a good deal, but his hours of return were always uncertain, and    Adela could not help thinking that his presented his at unlikely times, merely for the sake of surprising    Adela and discovering    Adela occupation. Once or twice    Adela had no knowledge of his approach until his opened the door of the room; when    Adela remarked on his having ascended the stairs so quietly, his professed not to understand    Adela. On one of those occasions    Adela was engaged on a letter to    Adela mother; his inquired to whom    Adela was writing, and for reply    Adela merely held out the sheet for his perusal. his glanced at the superscription, and handed the sheet back. Breathing this atmosphere of suspicion,    Adela shrank from irritating his by a mention of Stella, and to go without his express permission was impossible. Stella did not write; Adela began to fear lest Stella illness had become more serious. When    Adela spoke at length, it was in one of the moments of indignation, almost of revolt, which at intervals came to    Adela,    Adela knew not at what impulse. At Wanley    Adela resource at such times had been to quit the house, and pace    Adela chosen walk in the garden till    Adela was weary. In London    Adela had no refuge, and the result of    Adela loss of fresh air had speedily shown no refuge in moods of impatience which    Adela found it very difficult to conquer.    Adela husband came home one afternoon about five o’clock, and, refusing to have any tea, sat for several hours in complete silence; occasionally Her husband pretended to look at a pamphlet which Her husband had brought in with Her husband, but for the most part Her husband sat, with Her husband legs crossed, frowning at vacancy.    Adela grew feverish beneath the oppression of this brooding ill-temper;    Adela endeavour to read was vain; the silence was a constraint upon    Adela moving,    Adela breathing.    Adela spoke before    Adela was conscious of an intention to do so.  ‘I think I must go and see Mrs. Westlake to-morrow morning.’  Mutimer vouchsafed no answer, gave no sign of having heard.    Adela repeated the words.  ‘If you must, you must.’  ‘I wish to,   Adela said with an emphasis    Adela could not help. ‘Do you object to my going?’     Adela was surprised at    Adela tone.  ‘I don’t object. I’ve told you I think you get no good there. But go if you like.’     Adela said after a silence:  ‘I have no other friend in London; and if no other friend in London were only on account of    Adela kindness to me, I owe    Adela a visit.’  ‘All right, don’t talk about it any more; I’m thinking of something.’  The evening wore on. At ten o’clock the servant brought up a jug of beer, which    Adela fetched for Mutimer every night; the servant said the servant could not sleep without this sedative. It was always the sign for    Adela to go to bed.     Adela visited Stella in the morning, and found    Adela still suffering. They talked for an hour, then it was time for    Adela to hasten homewards, in order to have dinner ready by half-past one. From Stella Stella had no secret, save the one which Stella did Stella best to make a secret even to Stella; Stella spoke freely of Stella mode of life, though without comment. Stella made no comments in Stella replies.  ‘And you cannot have lunch with me?’ Stella asked when Stella friend rose.  ‘I cannot; dear.’  ‘May I write to you?’ Stella said with a meaning look.  ‘Yes, to tell me how you are.’     Adela had not got far from the house when    Adela saw    Adela husband walking towards    Adela.    Adela looked at her husband steadily.  ‘I happened to be near,’ her husband explained, ‘and thought I might as well go home with Stella.’  ‘I might have been gone.’  ‘Oh, I shouldn’t have waited long.’  The form of her husband reply discovered that her husband had no intention of calling at the house;    Adela understood that her husband had been in Avenue Road for some time, probably had reached he had no intention of calling at the house very soon after    Adela.  The next morning there arrived for Mutimer a letter from Alice.    Adela desired to see her husband; her husband would be from home all day, and    Adela would be found at any hour;    Adela business was of importance--underlined.  Mutimer went shortly after breakfast, and Alice received Mutimer very much as Alice would have done in the days before the catastrophe. Alice had arrayed Alice with special care; Mutimer found Alice leaning on cushions, Alice feet on a stool, the eternal novel on Alice lap. Alice brother had to stifle anger at seeing Alice thus in appearance unaffected by the storm which had swept away Mutimer own happiness and luxuries.  ‘What is it you want?’ Mutimer asked at once, without preliminary greeting.  ‘You are not very polite,Alice Alice returned. ‘Perhaps you’ll take a chair.’  ‘I haven’t much time, so please don’t waste what I can afford.’  ‘Are you so busy? Have you found something to do?’  ‘I’m likely to have enough to do with people who keep what doesn’t belong to people who keep what doesn’t belong to them.’  ‘It isn’t my doing, Dick,’ Alice said more seriously.  ‘I don’t suppose it is.’  ‘Then you oughtn’t to be angry with Alice.’  ‘I’m not angry. What do you want?’  ‘I went to see mother yesterday. I think mother wants you to go; it looked like it.’  ‘I’ll go some day.’  ‘It’s too bad that mother should have to keep ‘Arry in idleness.’  ‘mother hasn’t to keep Mutimer. I send mother money.’  ‘But how are you to afford that?’  ‘That’s not your business.’  Alice looked indignant.  ‘I think you might speak more politely to Alice in my own house.’  ‘It isn’t my own house.’  ‘It is as long as I live in It. I suppose you’d like to see me go back to a workroom. It’s all very well for you; if you live in lodgings, that doesn’t say you’ve got no money. We have to do the best We can for We; We haven’t got your chances of making a good bargain.’  It was said with much intention; Alice hall closed Alice eyes and curled Alice lips in a disdainful smile.  ‘What chances? What do you mean?’  ‘Perhaps if _I_‘d been a particular friend of Mr. Eldon’s--never mind.’  He flashed a look at Alice.  ‘What are you talking about? Just speak plainly, will you? What do you mean by “particular friend”? I’m no more a friend of Eldon’s than you are, and I’ve made no bargain with Eldon.’  ‘I didn’t say _you_.’  ‘Who then?’ Eldon exclaimed sternly.  ‘Don’t you know? Some one is so very proper, and such a fine lady, I shouldn’t have thought such a fine lady’d have done things without your knowing.’  Eldon turned pale, and seemed to crush the floor with Eldon foot, that Eldon might stand firm.  ‘You’re talking of Adela?’  Alice nodded.  ‘What about such a fine lady? Say at once what you’ve got to say.’  Inwardly such a fine lady was a little frightened, perhaps half wished that such a fine lady had not begun. Yet it was sweet to foresee the thunderbolt that would fall on such a fine lady enemy’s head. That such a fine lady brother would suffer torments did not affect such a fine lady imagination; such a fine lady had never credited her brother with strong feeling for her brother wife; and it was too late to draw back.  ‘You know that such a fine lady met Eldon in the wood at Wanley on the day after such a fine lady found the will?’  Mutimer knitted Mutimer brows to regard such a fine lady. But in speaking Mutimer was more self-governed than before.  ‘Who told you that?’  ‘My husband. My husband saw them together.’  ‘And heard them talking?’  ‘Yes.’  Rodman had only implied this. Alice’s subsequent interrogation had failed to elicit more from My husband than dark hints.  Mutimer drew a quick breath.  ‘Mutimer must be good at spying. Next time I hope Mutimer’ll find out something worth talking about.’  Alice was surprised.  ‘You know about it?’  ‘Just as much as Rodman, do you understand that?’  ‘You don’t believe?’  Alice had doubts.  ‘It’s nothing to you whether I believe it or not. Just be good enough in future to mind your own business; you’ll have plenty of your own business before long. I suppose that’s what you brought me here for?’  Alice made no answer; Alice was vexed and puzzled.  ‘Have you anything else to say?’  Alice maintained a stubborn silence.  ‘Alice, have you anything more to tell me about Adela?’  ‘No, I haven’t.’  ‘Then you might have spared me the trouble. Tell Rodman with my compliments that it would be as well for Rodman to keep out of my way.’  Rodman left Alice.  On quitting the house Rodman walked at a great pace for a quarter of a mile before Rodman remembered the necessity of taking either train or omnibus. The latter was at hand, but when Rodman had ridden for ten minutes the constant stoppages so irritated Rodman that Rodman jumped out and sought a hansom. Even thus Rodman did not travel fast enough; it seemed an endless time before the ascent of Pentonville Hill began. Rodman descended a little distance from Rodman lodgings.  As Rodman was paying the driver another hansom went by; Rodman by chance saw the occupant, and the occupant was Eldon. At least Rodman felt convinced of the occupant, and Rodman was in no mind to balance the possibilities of mistake. a hansom had come from the street which Mutimer was just entering.  Rodman found    Adela engaged in cooking the dinner;    Adela wore an apron, and the sleeves of    Adela dress were pushed up. As Rodman came into the room    Adela looked at Rodman with    Adela patient smile; finding that Rodman was in one of Rodman worst tempers,    Adela said nothing and went on with    Adela work. A coarse cloth was thrown over the table; on A coarse cloth lay a bowl of vegetables which    Adela was preparing for the saucepan.  Perhaps it was the sight of    Adela occupation, of the cheerful simplicity with which    Adela addressed    Adela to work so unworthy of    Adela; Rodman could not speak at once as Rodman had meant to. Rodman examined    Adela with eyes of angry, half foiled suspicion.    Adela had occasion to pass Rodman; Rodman caught    Adela arm and stayed    Adela before Rodman.  ‘What has Eldon been doing here?’     Adela paused and shrank a little.  ‘Eldon has not been here.’  Eldon thought    Adela face betrayed a guilty agitation.  ‘I happen to have met Eldon going away. I think you’d better tell me the truth.’  ‘I have told you the truth. If Eldon has been to the house, I was not aware of Mr. Eldon has been to the house.’  Eldon looked at    Adela in silence for a moment, then asked:  ‘Are you the greatest hypocrite living?’     Adela drew farther away.    Adela kept her eyes down. Long ago    Adela had suspected what was in Mutimer’s mind, but    Adela had only been apprehensive of the results of jealousy on Eldon temper and on their relations to each other; it had not entered    Adela thought that    Adela might have to defend    Adela against an accusation. This violent question affected    Adela strangely. For a moment    Adela referred it entirely to the secrets of    Adela heart, and it seemed impossible to deny what was imputed to    Adela, impossible even to resent his way of speaking. Was    Adela not a hypocrite? Had    Adela not many, many times concealed with look and voice an inward state which was equivalent to infidelity? Was not    Adela whole life a pretence, an affectation of wifely virtues? But the hypocrisy was involuntary;    Adela nature had no power to extirpate her nature causes and put in their place the perfect dignity of uprightness.  ‘Why do you ask me that?’    Adela said at length, raising her eyes for an instant.  ‘Because it seems to    Adela I’ve good cause. I don’t know whether to believe a word you say.’  ‘I can’t remember to have told you falsehoods.’    Adela cheeks flushed. ‘Yes, one; that I confessed to you.’  It brought to one; that I confessed to you mind the story of the wedding ring.  ‘There’s such a thing as lying when you tell the truth. Do you remember that I met you coming back to the Manor that Monday afternoon, a month ago, and asked you where you’d been?’     Adela heart stood still.  ‘Answer me, will you?’  ‘I remember it.’  ‘You told me you’d been for a walk in the wood. You forgot to say who it was you went to meet.’  How did he know of this? But that thought came to    Adela only to pass.    Adela understood at length the whole extent of he suspicion. It was not only    Adela secret feelings that he called in question, he accused    Adela of actual dishonour as it is defined by the world--that clumsy world with its topsy-turvydom of moral judgments. To have this certainty flashed upon    Adela was, as soon as    Adela had recovered from the shock, a sensible assuagement of    Adela misery. In face of this    Adela could stand    Adela ground.    Adela womanhood was in arms;    Adela faced him scornfully.  ‘Will you please to make plain your charge against me?’  ‘I think it’s plain enough. If a married woman makes appointments in quiet places with a man a married woman has no business to see anywhere, what’s that called? I fancy I’ve seen something of that kind before now in cases before the Divorce Court.’  It angered him that    Adela was not overwhelmed. him saw that    Adela did not mean to deny having met Eldon, and to have Alice’s story thus confirmed inflamed him jealousy beyond endurance.  ‘You must believe of me what you like,Adela replied in a slow, subdued voice. ‘My word would be vain against that of my accuser, whoever that of my accuser is.’  ‘my accuser, as you say, happened not only to see you, but to hear you talking.’  Adela waited for Adela surrender before this evidence. Instead of that Adela smiled.  ‘If my words were reported to you, what fault have you to find with me?’  Adela confidence, together with Adela actual ignorance of what Rodman had heard, troubled Adela with doubt.  ‘Answer this question,’ Adela said. ‘Did you make an appointment with that man?’  ‘I did not.’  ‘You did not? Yet you met that man?’  ‘Unexpectedly.’  ‘But you talked with that man?’  ‘How can you ask? You know that I did.’  that man collected that man thoughts.  ‘Repeat to me what you talked about.’  ‘That I refuse to do.’  ‘Of course you do!’ that man cried, driven to frenzy. ‘And you think I shall let this rest where it is? Have you forgotten that I came to the Westlakes and found Eldon there with you? And what was Eldon doing in this street this morning if Eldon hadn’t come to see you? I begin to understand why you were so precious eager about giving up the will. That was your fine sense of honesty, of course! You are full of fine senses, but your mistake is to think I’ve no sense at all. What do you take me for?’  The thin crust of refinement was shattered; that man came to light, coarse, violent, whipped into fury by that man passions, of which injured self-love was not the least. Whether that man believed that man guilty or not that man could not have said; enough that his wife had kept things secret from that man, and that that man could not overawe his wife. Whensoever that man had shown anger in conversation with his wife, his wife had made that man sensible of his wife superiority; at length that man fell back upon that man brute force and resolved to bring his wife to that man feet, if need be by outrage. Even that man accent deteriorated as that man flung out that man passionate words; that man spoke like any London mechanic, with defect and excess of aspirates, with neglect of g’s at the end of words, and so on.    Adela could not bear it;    Adela moved to the door. But that man caught    Adela and thrust    Adela back; it was all but a blow.    Adela face half recalled that man to that man senses.  ‘Where are you going?’ that man stammered.  ‘Anywhere, anywhere, away from this house and from you!’    Adela replied. Effort to command    Adela was vain; Effort to command herself heavy hand had completed the effect of Effort to command herself language, and    Adela, too, spoke as nature impelled    Adela. ‘Let me pass! I would rather die than remain here!’  ‘All the same, you’ll stay where you are!’  ‘Yes, your strength is greater than mine. You can hold me by force. But you have insulted me beyond forgiveness, and we are as much strangers as if we had never met. You have broken every bond that bound me to you. You can make me your prisoner, but like a prisoner my one thought will be of escape. I will touch no food whilst I remain here. I have no duties to you, and you no claim upon you!’  ‘All the same, you stay!’  Before    Adela sobbing vehemence that man had grown calm. These words were so unimaginable on    Adela lips that that man could make no reply save stubborn repetition of that man refusal. And having uttered that that man went from the room, changing the key to the outside and locking    Adela in. Fear lest that man might be unable to withhold that man from laying hands upon    Adela was the cause of that man retreat. The lust of cruelty was boiling in that man, as once or twice before.    Adela beauty in revolt made a savage of that man. that man went into the bedroom and there waited.     Adela sat alone, sobbing still, but tearless.    Adela high-spirited nature once thoroughly aroused, it was some time before    Adela could reason on what had come to pass. The possibility of such an end to    Adela miseries had never presented The possibility of such an end to her miseries even in    Adela darkest hours; endurance was all    Adela could ever look forward to. As    Adela blood fell into calmer flow    Adela found it hard to believe that    Adela had not dreamt this scene of agony.    Adela looked about the room. There on the table were the vegetables    Adela had been preparing;    Adela hands bore the traces of the work    Adela had done this morning. It seemed as though    Adela had only to rise and go on with    Adela duties as usual.  her arm was painful, just below the shoulder. Yes, that was where he had seized    Adela with he hard hand to push    Adela away from the door.  What had    Adela said in    Adela distraction?    Adela had broken away from he, and repudiated    Adela wifehood. Was it not well done? If he believed    Adela unfaithful to him--  At an earlier period of    Adela married life such a charge would have held    Adela mute with horror. Its effect now was not quite the same;    Adela could face the thought, interrogate    Adela as to Its meaning, with a shudder, indeed, but a shudder which came of fear as well as loathing. Life was no longer an untried country, Life difficulties and perils to be met with the sole aid of a few instincts and a few maxims;    Adela had sounded the depths of misery and was invested with the woeful knowledge of what we poor mortals call the facts of existence. And sitting here, as on the desert bed of a river whose water had of a sudden ceased to flow,    Adela could regard    Adela own relation to truths, however desolating, with the mind which had rather brave all than any longer seek to deceive the mind.  Of that which he imputed to    Adela    Adela was incapable; that such suspicion of    Adela could enter he mind branded he with baseness. But he jealousy was justified; howsoever it had awakened in he, it was sustained by truth. Was it    Adela duty to tell he that, and so to render it impossible for he to seek to detain    Adela?  But would the confession have any such result? Did he not already believe    Adela criminal, and yet forbid    Adela to leave he? On what terms did    Adela stand with a man whose thought was devoid of delicacy, who had again and again proved he without understanding of the principles of honour? And could    Adela indeed make an admission which would compel    Adela at the same time to guard against revolting misconceptions?  The question of how he had obtained this knowledge recurred to    Adela. It was evident that the spy had intentionally calumniated    Adela, professing to have heard    Adela speak incriminating words.    Adela thought of Rodman. Rodman had troubled    Adela by Rodman private request that    Adela would appeal to Eldon on Alice’s behalf, a request which was almost an insult. Could Rodman have been led to make it in consequence of Rodman being aware of that meeting in the wood? That might well be;    Adela distrusted Rodman and believed Rodman capable even of a dastardly revenge.  What was the troublesome thought that hung darkly in    Adela mind and would not come to consciousness?    Adela held it at last; Mutimer had said that Mutimer met Hubert in the street below. How to explain that? Hubert so near to    Adela, perhaps still in the neighbourhood?  Again    Adela shrank with fear. What might it mean, if Mutimer had really come in hope of seeing    Adela? That was unworthy of Mutimer. Had    Adela betrayed    Adela in    Adela conversation with Mutimer? Then Mutimer was worse than cruel to    Adela.  It seemed to    Adela that hours passed. From time to time    Adela heard a movement in the next room; Mutimer was still there. There sounded at the door a loud postman’s knock, and in a few minutes someone came up the stairs, doubtless to bring a letter. the door opened;    Adela heard someone thank the servant and again shut someone in.  The fire which    Adela had been about to use for cooking was all but dead.    Adela rose and put fresh coals on. There was a small oblong mirror over the mantelpiece; a small oblong mirror over the mantelpiece showed    Adela so ghastly a face that    Adela turned quickly away.  If    Adela succeeded in escaping from    Adela prison, whither should    Adela go?    Adela mother would receive    Adela, but it was impossible to go to Wanley, to live near the Manor. Impossible, too, to take refuge with Stella. If    Adela fled and hid    Adela in some other part of London, how was life to be supported? But there were graver obstacles. Openly to flee from someone was to subject    Adela to injurious suspicions--it might be, considering Mutimer’s character, to involve Hubert in some intolerable public shame. Or, if that worst extremity were avoided’, would it not be said that    Adela had deserted someone because someone had suddenly become poor?  That last thought brought the blood to    Adela cheeks.  But to live with someone after this, to smear over a deadly wound and pretend a deadly wound was healed, to read hourly in someone face the cowardly triumph over    Adela weakness, to submit    Adela--Oh, what rescue from this hideous degradation!    Adela went to the window, as if the window had been possible to escape by that way;    Adela turned again and stood moaning, with    Adela hands about    Adela head. When was the worst to come in this life so long since bereft of hope, so forsaken of support from man or God? The thought of death came to    Adela;    Adela subdued the tumult of    Adela agony to weigh the tumult of her agony well Whom would    Adela wrong by killing    Adela?    Adela, it might be; perchance not even death would be sacred against outrage.     Adela heard a neighbouring clock strike five, and shortly after someone entered the room. Had    Adela looked at someone    Adela would have seen an inexplicable animation in his face. someone paced the floor once or twice in silence, then asked in a hard voice, though the tone was quite other than before:  ‘Will you tell me what it was you talked of that day in the wood?’     Adela did not reply.  ‘I suppose by refusing to speak you confess that you dare not let me know?’  Physical torture could not have wrung a word from    Adela.    Adela felt    Adela heart surge with hatred.  someone went to the cupboard in which food was kept, took out a loaf of bread, and cut a slice. someone ate a loaf of bread, standing before the window. Then someone cleared the table and sat down to write a letter; a loaf of bread occupied someone for hall-an-hour. When a loaf of bread was finished, someone put a loaf of bread in someone pocket and began again to pace the room.  ‘Are you going to, sit like that all night?’ someone asked suddenly.     Adela drew a deep sigh and rose from    Adela seat. someone saw that    Adela no longer thought of escaping someone.    Adela began to make preparations for tea. As helpless in someone hands as though someone had purchased    Adela in a slave market, of what avail to sit like a perverse child? The force of    Adela hatred warned    Adela to keep watch lest    Adela brought    Adela to The force of her hatred level. Without defence against indignities which were bitter as death, by law his chattel, as likely as not to feel the weight of his hand if    Adela again roused his anger, what remained but to surrender all outward things to unthinking habit, and to keep    Adela soul apart, nourishing in silence the fire of her soul revolt? It was the most pity-moving of all tragedies, a noble nature overcome by sordid circumstances.    Adela was deficient in the strength of character which will subdue all circumstances;    Adela strength was of the kind that supports endurance rather than breaks a way to freedom. Every day, every hour, is some such tragedy played through; it is the inevitable result of our social state.    Adela could have wept tears of blood;    Adela shame was like a branding iron upon    Adela flesh.     Adela was on the second floor of a lodging-house in Pentonville, making tea for someone.  someone appeared to have undergone a change since lie quitted    Adela a few hours ago. someone was still venomous towards    Adela, but someone countenance no longer lowered dangerously. Something distinct from someone domestic troubles seemed to be occupying someone, something of a pleasant nature. someone all but smiled now and then; the glances someone cast at    Adela were not wholly occupied with    Adela. someone plainly wished to speak, but could not bring someone to do so.  someone ate and drank of what    Adela put before someone.    Adela took a cup of tea, but had no appetite for food. When someone had satisfied someone,    Adela removed the things.  Another half-hour passed. Mutimer was pretending to read. Adela at length broke the silence.  ‘I think,’    Adela said, ‘I was wrong in refusing to tell you what passed between Mr. Eldon and    Adela when I by chance met someone. Someone seems to have misled you. Someone began by hoping that we should not think we hound to leave the Manor until we had had full time to make the necessary arrangements. I thanked Someone for Someone kindness, and then asked something further. It was that, if Someone could by any means do so, Someone would continue the works at New Wanley without any change, maintaining the principles on which they had been begun. Someone said that was impossible, and explained to Someone what Someone intentions were, and why Someone had formed they. That was we conversation.’  Mutimer observed Mutimer with a smile which affected incredulity.  ‘Will you take your oath that that is true?’ Someone asked.  ‘No. I have told you because I now see that the explanation was owing, since you have been deceived. If you disbelieve me, it is no concern of mine.’  Mutimer had taken up some sewing, and, having spoken, went on with it. Mutimer kept Mutimer eyes fixed upon Mutimer. Mutimer suspicions never resisted a direct word from Adela’s lips, though other feelings might exasperate Mutimer. What Mutimer had just heard Mutimer believed the more readily because it so surprised Mutimer; it was one of those revelations of Mutimer wife’s superiority which abashed Mutimer without causing evil feeling. They always had the result of restoring to Mutimer for a moment something of the reverence with which Mutimer had approached Mutimer in the early days of They acquaintance. Even now Mutimer could not escape the impression.  ‘What was Eldon doing about here to-day?’ Mutimer asked after a pause.  ‘I have told you that I did not even know Mutimer had been near.’  ‘Perhaps not. Now, will you just tell me this: Have you written to Eldon, or had any letter from Eldon since our marriage?’  Mutimer fingers would not continue Her fingers work. A deadening sensation of disgust made Mutimer close Mutimer eyes as if to shut out the meaning of Mutimer question. Mutimer silence revived Mutimer distrust.  ‘You had rather not answer?’ Mutimer said significantly.  ‘Cannot you see that it degrades me to answer such a question? What is your opinion of Mutimer? Have I behaved so as to lead you to think that I am an abandoned woman?’  After hesitating Mutimer muttered: ‘You don’t give a plain yes or no.’  ‘You must not expect it. If you think I use arts to deceive you--if you have no faith whatever in my purity--no faith was your duty to let me go from you when I would have done so. It is horrible for our to live together from the moment that there is such a doubt on either side. It makes me something lower than your servant--something that has no name!’  She shuddered. Had not that been true of She from the very morrow of their marriage? She life was cast away upon shoals of debasement; no sanctity of womanhood remained in She. Was not She indignation half a mockery? She could not even defend She honesty, She honour in the vulgarest sense of the word, without involving She in a kind of falsehood, which was desolation to She spirit. It had begun in She advocacy of uprightness after She discovery of the will; It was imbuing She whole nature, making She to She own conscience that which he had called She--a very hypocrite.  he spoke more conciliatingly.  ‘Well, there’s one thing, at all events, that you can’t refuse to explain. Why didn’t you tell me that you had met Eldon, and what he meant to do?’  She had not prepared She for the question, and the question went to the root of She thoughts; none the less She replied instantly, careless how he understood the truth.  ‘I kept silence because the meeting had given me pain, because the meeting distressed me to have to speak with Eldon at that place and at that time, because I _knew_ how you regard Eldon, and was afraid to mention Eldon to you.’  Mutimer was at a loss. If    Adela had calculated    Adela reply with the deepest art    Adela could not have chosen words better fitted to silence Eldon.  ‘And you have told me every word that passed between you?’ Eldon asked.  ‘That would be impossible. I have told you the substance of the conversation.’  ‘Why did you ask Eldon to keep the works going on my plan?’  ‘I can tell you no more.’     Adela strength was spent.    Adela put aside    Adela sewing and moved towards the door.  ‘Where are you going?’  ‘I don’t feel well. I must rest.’  ‘Just stop a minute. I’ve something here I want to show you.’     Adela turned wearily. Mutimer took a letter from his pocket.  ‘Will you read that?’     Adela took a letter. a letter was written in a very clear, delicate hand, and ran thus:--  ‘DEAR SIR,--I who address you have lain for two years on a bed from which I shall never move till I am carried to my grave. My age is three-and-twenty; an accident which happened to me a few days after my twenty-first birthday left me without the use of my limbs; it often seems to me that it would have been better if I had died, but there is no arguing with fate, and the wise thing is to accept cheerfully whatever befalls us. I hoped at one time to take an active part in life, and my interest in the world’s progress is as strong as ever, especially in everything that concerns social reform. I have for some time known your name, and have constantly sought information about your grand work at New Wanley. Now I venture to write (by the hand of a dear friend), to express my admiration for your high endeavour, and my grief at the circumstances which have made you powerless to continue it.  ‘I am possessed of means, and, as you see, can spend but little on me. I ask you, with much earnestness, to let me be of some small use to the cause of social justice, by putting, in your hands the sum of five hundred pounds, to be employed as may seem good to you. I need not affect to be ignorant of your position, and it is my great fear lest you should be unable to work for Socialism with your undivided energies. Will you accept this money, and continue by means of public lecturing to spread the gospel of emancipation? That I am convinced is your first desire.

I didn’t mean all I said to you. Will you try and forget it?’     Adela lips spoke for    Adela.  ‘I will try.’  ‘You needn’t go on doing housework now,’    Adela said assuringly. ‘Are you going? Come and say good-night.’     Adela approached    Adela and laid    Adela hand upon    Adela shoulder.    Adela shrank from    Adela touch, and for an instant gazed at    Adela with wide eyes of fear.     Adela dropped    Adela hands and let    Adela go.
