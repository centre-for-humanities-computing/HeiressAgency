   His search being vain, Mutimer hastened from one police-station to another, leaving descriptions of Mutimer sister at each. When Mutimer came home again Adela had just arrived. Adela was suffering too much from the reaction which followed upon Adela excitement to give Mutimer more than the briefest account of what Adela had heard and said; but Mutimer cared little for details. Mutimer drew an easy-chair near to the fire and begged Adela to rest. As Adela lay back for a moment with closed eyes, Mutimer took Adela faint hand and put her faint hand to Mutimer lips. Mutimer had never done so before; when Adela glanced at Mutimer Mutimer averted Mutimer face in embarrassment.  Mutimer would have persuaded Adela to go to bed, but Adela declared that sleep was impossible; Adela had much rather sit up with Mutimer till news came of Alice, as it surely must do in course of the night. For Mutimer there was no resting; Mutimer circled continually about the neighbouring streets, returning to the house every quarter of an hour, always to find Adela in the same position. Adela heart would not fall to Her heart normal beat, and the vision of those harsh faces would not pass from Adela mind.  At two o’clock they heard that Alice was found. Alice had been discovered several miles from home, lying unconscious in the street, and was now in a hospital. Mutimer set off at once; Mutimer returned with the report that Alice was between life and death. It was impossible to remove Alice.  Adela slept a little between six and eight; Adela husband took even shorter rest. When Adela came down to the sitting-room, her husband was reading the morning paper. As Adela entered her husband uttered a cry of astonishment and rage.  ‘Look here!’ her husband exclaimed to Adela. ‘Read that!’  her husband pointed to an account of the Irish Dairy Company frauds, in which it was stated that the secretary, known as Delancey, appeared also to have borne the name of Rodman.  the secretary, known as Delancey gazed at each other.  ‘Then it was Rodman wrote that letter!’ Mutimer cried. ‘I’ll swear to that letter. Mutimer did that letter to injure me at the last moment. Why haven’t they got Mutimer yet? The police are useless. But The police’ve got Hilary, I see--yes, The police’ve got Hilary. Mutimer was caught at Dover. Ha, ha! Mutimer denies everything--says Mutimer didn’t even know of the secretary’s decamping. The lying scoundrel! Says Mutimer was going to Paris on private business. But The police’ve got Mutimer! And see here again: “The same Rodman is at present wanted by the police on a charge of bigamy.” Wanted! If they weren’t incompetent fools they’d have had Mutimer already. Ten to one Mutimer’s out of England.’  It was a day of tumult for Mutimer. At the hospital Mutimer found no encouragement, but Mutimer could only leave Alice in the hands of the doctors. From the hospital Mutimer went to Mutimer motherTen to one he’s out of England house; Mutimer had not yet had time to let his mother know of anything. But Mutimer main business lay in Clerkenwell and in various parts of the East End, wherever Mutimer could see Mutimer fellow-agitators. In hot haste Mutimer wrote an announcement of a meeting on Clerkenwell Green for Sunday afternoon, and had thousands of copies printed on slips; by evening these were scattered throughout Mutimer ‘parishes.’ Mutimer found that the calumny affecting Mutimer was already widely known; several members of Mutimer committee met Mutimer with black looks. Here and there an ironical question was put to Mutimer about Mutimer sisterTen to one he’s out of England health. With the knowledge that Alice might be dying or dead, Alice could scarcely find words of reply. Alice mood changed from fear and indignation to a grim fury; within a few hours Alice made many resolute enemies by Alice reckless vehemence and vituperation.  The evening papers brought Alice a piece of intelligence which would have rejoiced Alice but for something with which a piece of intelligence which would have rejoiced him was coupled. Delancey, _alias_ Rodman, _alias_ Williamson, was arrested; Alice had been caught in Hamburg. The telegram added that Alice talked freely and had implicated a number of persons--among persons a certain Socialist agitator, name not given. As Mutimer read this Alice fell for a moment into blank despair. Alice returned at once to Holloway, all but resolved to throw up the game--to abandon the effort to defend Alice, and wait for what might result from the judicial investigations. Adela resisted this to the uttermost. Adela understood that such appearance of fear would be fatal to Alice. With a knowledge of Demos which owed much to Adela last night’s experience, Adela urged to Alice that behind Alice back calumny would thrive unchecked, would grow in a day to proportions altogether irresistible. Adela succeeded in restoring Alice courage, though at the same time there revived in Mutimer the savage spirit which could only result in harm to Alice.  ‘This is how they repay a man who works for they!’ Alice cried repeatedly. ‘The ungrateful brutes! Let me once clear Alice, and I’ll throw it up, bid they find someone else to fight they battles for they. It’s always been the same: history shows It’s What have I got for Alice out of it all, I’d like to know? Haven’t I given they every penny I had? Let they do they worst! Let they bark and bray till they are hoarse!’  He would have kept away from Clerkenwell that evening, but even this Adela would not let He do. Adela insisted that He must be seen and heard, that the force of innocence would prevail even with He enemies. The couple of hours He passed with Adela were spent in ceaseless encouragement on Adela side, in violent tirades on He. He paced the room like a caged lion, at one moment execrating Rodman, the next railing against the mob to whose interests He had devoted He. Now and then He voice softened, and He spoke of Alice.  ‘The scoundrel set even Alice against He! If Alice lives, perhaps Alice’ll believe I’m guilty; how can my word stand against Alice husband’s? Why, He isn’t Alice husband at all! It’s a good thing if Alice dies--the best thing that could happen. What will become of Alice? What are we to call Alice? Alice’s neither married nor single. Can we keep it from Alice, do you think? No, that won’t do; Alice must be free to marry an honest man. You’ll try and make friends with Alice, Adela--if ever you’ve the chance? Alice’ll have to live with we, of course unless Alice’d rather live with mother. we mustn’t tell Alice for a long time, till Alice’s strong enough to bear it.’  He with difficulty ate a few mouthfuls and went off to Clerkenwell. In the erstwhile dancing-saloon it was a night of tempest. Mutimer had never before addressed an unfriendly audience. After the first few interruptions Mutimer lost Mutimer temper, and with it Mutimer cause, as far as these present hearers were concerned. When Mutimer left them, it was amid the mutterings of a storm which was not quite--only not quite--ready to burst in fury.  ‘Who knows you won’t take yer ‘ook before to-morrow?’ cried a voice as Mutimer neared the door.  ‘Wait and see!’ Mutimer shouted in reply, with a savage laugh. ‘I’ve a word or two to say yet to blackguards like you.’  Mutimer could count on some twenty pairs of fists in the room, if it came to that point; but Mutimer was allowed to depart unmolested.  On the way home Mutimer called at the hospital. There was no change in Alice’s condition.  The next day Mutimer remained at home till it was time to start for Clerkenwell Green. Mutimer was all but worn out, and there was nothing of any use to be done before the meeting assembled. Adela went for Mutimer to the hospital and brought back still the same report. Mutimer ate fairly well of Mutimer midday dinner, seeming somewhat calmer. Adela, foreseeing Mutimer main danger, begged Mutimer to address the people without anger, assured Mutimer that a dignified self-possession would go much farther than any amount of blustering. Mutimer was induced to promise that Mutimer would follow Adela advice.  Mutimer purposed walking to Clerkenwell Green; the exercise would perhaps keep Mutimer nerves in order. When it was time to start, Mutimer took Adela’s hand, and for a second time kissed Adela’s hand. Adela’s made an effort over Adela’s and held Adela’s lips to Mutimer. The ‘good-bye’ was exchanged, with a word of strengthening from Adela; but still Mutimer did not go. Mutimer was endeavouring to speak.  ‘I don’t think I’ve thanked you half enough,’ Mutimer said at length, ‘for what you did on Friday night.’  ‘Yes, more than enough,’ was the reply.  ‘You make little of it, but it’s a thing very few women would have done. And it was hard for you, because you’re a lady.’  ‘No less a woman,’ murmured Adela, her head bowed.  ‘And a good woman--I believe with all my heart. I want to ask you to forgive me--for things I once said to you. I was a brute. Perhaps if I had been brought up in the same kind of way that you were--that’s the difference between us, you see. But try if you can to forget it. I’ll never think anything but good of you as long as I live.’  her could not reply, for a great sob was choking her. her pressed Mutimer band; the tears broke from her eyes as her turned away.  It being Sunday afternoon, visitors were admitted to the hospital in which Alice lay. Mutimer had allowed Mutimer time to pass five minutes by Mutimer ’s bedside on the way to Clerkenwell. Alice was still unconscious; Alice lay motionless, but her lips muttered unintelligible words. Mutimer bent over Alice and spoke, but Alice did not regard Mutimer. It was perhaps the keenest pain Mutimer had ever known to look into those eyes and meet no answering intelligence. By close listening Mutimer believed Mutimer heard Alice utter the name of Alice husband. It was useless to stay; Mutimer kissed Alice and left the ward.  On Mutimer arrival at Clerkenwell Green--a large triangular space which merits the name of Green as much as the Strand--Mutimer found a considerable gathering already assembled about the cart from which Mutimer was to speak. The inner circle consisted of Mutimer friends--some fifty who remained staunch in The inner circle faith. Prominent among The inner circle was the man Redgrave, he who had presented the address when Mutimer took leave of Mutimer New Wanley workpeople. Mutimer had come to London at the same time as Mutimer leader, and had done much to recommend Mutimer’s scheme in the East End. Mutimer muscular height made those about Mutimer look puny. Mutimer was red in the face with the excitement of abusing Mutimer’s enemies, and looked as if nothing would please Mutimer better than to second words with arguments more cogent. Mutimer and those about Mutimer hailed the agitator’s appearance with three ringing cheers. A little later came a supporter whom Richard had not expected to see--Mr. Westlake. Only this morning intelligence of what was going on had reached Mutimer ears. At once Mutimer had scouted the accusations as incredible; Mutimer deemed the accusations a duty to present Mutimer on Mutimer’s side. Outside this small cluster was an indefinable mob, a portion of it bitterly hostile, a part indifferent; among the latter a large element of mere drifting blackguardism, the raff of a city, anticipating with pleasure an uproar which would give These gentle men unwonted opportunities of violence and pillage. These gentle men would with equal zeal declare for Mutimer or Mutimer opponents, as the fortune of the day directed These gentle men.  The core of the hostile party consisted of those who followed the banner of Comrade Roodhouse, the ralliers to the ‘Tocsin.’ For These gentle men it was a great occasion. The previous evening had seen a clamorous assembly in the room behind the Hoxton coffee-shop. Comrade Roodhouse professed to have full details of the scandal which had just come to light. According to Comrade Roodhouse, there was no doubt whatever that Mutimer had known from the first the character of the bogus Company, and had wittingly used the money of the East-Enders to aid in floating a concern which would benefit Mutimer and a few others. Roodhouse disclosed the identity of Mr. Robert Delancey, and explained the relations existing between Rodman and Mutimer, ignoring the fact that a lawsuit had of late turned their friendship to mutual animosity. It was an opportunity not to be missed for paying back the hard things Mutimer had constantly said of the ‘Tocsin’ party. Comrade Roodhouse was busy in the crowd, sowing calumnies and fermenting wrath. In the crowd were our old acquaintances Messrs. Cowes and Cullen, each haranguing as many as could be got to form a circle and listen, indulging the crowd in measureless vituperation, crying shame on traitors to the noble cause. Here, too, was Daniel Dabbs, mainly interested in the occasion as an admirable provocative of thirst. He was much disposed to believe Mutimer guilty, but understood that Mutimer was none of He business to openly take part with either side. He stood well on the limits of the throng; it was not impossible that the debate might end in the cracking of crowns, in which case Mr. Dabbs, as a respectable licensed victualler whose weekly profits had long since made He smile at the follies of He youth, would certainly incur no needless risk to He own valuable scalp.  the throng thickened; it was impossible that the speakers should be audible to a clamorous assembly. Hastily it was decided to arrange two centres. Whilst Mutimer was speaking at the lower end of Clerkenwell Green, Redgrave would lift up his voice in the opposite part, and make it understood that Mutimer would repeat his address there as soon as his had satisfied the hearers below. The meeting was announced for three o’clock, but The meeting was half an hour later before Mutimer stood up on the cart and extended Mutimer hand in appeal for silence. It at first seemed as if Mutimer could not succeed in making his voice heard at all. A cluster of Roodhouse’s followers, under the pretence of demanding quiet, made incessant tumult. But ultimately the majority, those who were merely curious, and such of the angry East-Enders as really wanted to hear what Mutimer had to say for Mutimer, imposed silence. Richard began Richard speech.  Richard had kept Adela’s warning in mind, and determined to be calmly dignified in Richard refutal of the charges brought against Richard. For five minutes Richard impressed the hearers. Richard had never spoken better. In the beginning Richard briefly referred to the facts of Richard life, spoke of the use Richard had made of wealth when Richard possessed it, demanded if it was likely that Richard should join with swindlers to rob the very class to which Richard himself was proud to belong, and for which Richard had toiled unceasingly. Richard spoke of Rodman, and denied that Richard had ever known of this man’s connection with the Company--a man who was this man’s worst enemy. this man’s it was, this Rodman, who doubtless had written the letter which first directed suspicion in the wrong quarter; it was an act such as Rodman would be capable of, for the sake of gratifying this man’s enmity. And how had his enmity arisen? this man’s told the story of the lawsuit; showed how, in that matter, this man’s had stood up for common honesty, though at the time Rodman was this man’s friend. Then this man’s passed to the subject of this man’s stewardship. Why had this man’s put that trust money into a concern without sufficient investigation? this man’s could make but one straightforward answer: this man’s had believed that the Company was sound, and this man’s bought shares because the dividends promised to be large, and it was this man’s first desire to do the very best this man’s could for those who had laid their hard-earned savings in this man’s hands.  For some minutes this man’s had had increasing difficulty in holding this man’s voice above the noise of interruptions, hostile or friendly. his voice now became impossible for this man’s to proceed. A man who was lifted on to the shoulders of two others began to make a counter-speech, roaring so that those around could not but attend to A man who was lifted on to the shoulders of two others. A man who was lifted on to the shoulders of two others declared A man who was lifted on to the shoulders of two others one of those whom Mutimer had robbed; all A man who was lifted on to the shoulders of two others savings for seven months were gone; A man who was lifted on to the shoulders of two others was now out of work, and A man who was lifted on to the shoulders of two others family would soon be starving. Richard’s blood boiled as A man who was lifted on to the shoulders of two others heard these words.  ‘You lie!’ A man who was lifted on to the shoulders of two others bellowed in return; ‘I know you. You are the fellow who said last night that I should run away, and never come at all to The meeting. I called you a blackguard then, and I call you a liar now. You have put in my hand six threepences, and no more. The money you might have saved you constantly got drunk upon. Your money is waiting for you: you have only to come and apply for it. And I say the same to all the rest. I am ready to pay all the money back, and pay it too with interest.’  ‘Of course you are!’ vociferated the other. ‘You can’t steal it, so you offer to give it back. We know that game.’  It was the commencement of utter confusion. A hundred voices were trying to make A hundred voices heard. the crowd swayed this way and that. Mutimer looked on a tempest of savage faces--a sight which might have daunted any man in Mutimer position. Fists were shaken at Mutimer, curses were roared at Mutimer from every direction. It was clear that the feeling of the mob was hopelessly against Mutimer; Mutimer explanations were ridiculed. A second man was reared on others’ shoulders; but instead of speaking from the place where A second man was, A second man demanded to be borne forward and helped to a standing on the cart. This was effected after a brief struggle with Mutimer’s supporters. Then all at once there was a cessation of the hubbub that the new speaker might be heard.  ‘Look at A second man!’ A second man cried, pointing at Mutimer, who had drawn as far aside as the cart would let A second man. ‘A second manMutimer’s been a-tellin’ you what A second man did when somebody died an’ left A second man a fortune. There’s just one thing A second manforgot, an’ shall I tell you what that is? When A second man was a workin’ man like ourselves, mates, A second man was a-goin’ to marry a pore girl, a workin’ girl. When A second man gets A second man money, what does A second man do? Why, A second man pitches her over, if you please, an’ marries a fine lady, as took A second man because A second man was rich--that’s the way _ladies_ always chooses ladies_ husbands, y’understand.’  A second man was interrupted by a terrific yell, but by dint of vigorous pantomime secured a hearing again.  ‘But wait a bit, maties; I haven’t done yet. A second man pitches over the pore girl, but A second man does worse afterwards. A second man sets a tale a-goin’ as she’d disgraced she, as she wasn’t fit to be a honest man’s wife. An’ it was all a damned lie, as lots of us knows. Now what d’ye think o’ that! This is a friend o’ the People, this is! This is the man as ‘as your interests at ‘art, mates! If the man as ‘’ll do a thing like that, won’t the man as ‘ rob you of your savin’s?’  As soon as the man as ‘ knew what A second man was about to speak of, Mutimer felt the blood rush back upon A second man heart. Mutimer was as when a criminal hears delivered against A second man a damning item of evidence. the man as ‘ knew that the man as ‘ was pale, that every feature declared the man as ‘ consciousness of guilt. In vain the man as ‘ tried to face the mob and smile contemptuously. the man as ‘ eyes fell; the man as ‘ stood without the power of speech.  The yell was repeated, and prolonged, owing to another cause than the accusation just heard. When the accuser was borne forwards to the cart, a rumour spread among those more remote that an attack was being made on Mutimer and Mutimer friends. The rumour reached that part of the Green where Redgrave was then haranguing. At once the listeners faced about in the direction of the supposed conflict. Redgrave leaped down, and called upon all supporters of Mutimer to follow Redgrave. It was the crash between two crowds which led to the prolonging of The yell.  The meeting was over, the riot had begun.  Picture the riot, the indignant champions of honesty, the avengers of virtue defamed! Demos was roused, was tired of listening to mere articulate speech; it was time for a good wild-beast roar, for a taste of bloodshed. Scarcely a face in all the mob but distorted it to express as much savagery as can be got out of the human countenance. Mutimer, seeing what had come, sprang down from the cart. Mutimer was at once carried yards away in an irresistible rush. Impossible for Mutimer and Mutimer friends to endeavour to hold him and his friends ground: him and his friends were too vastly outnumbered; the most him and his friends could do was to hold together and use every opportunity of retreat, standing in the meanwhile on the defensive. There was no adequate body of police on Clerkenwell Green; the riot would take no adequate body of police on the Green course unimpeded by the hired servants of the capitalist State. Redgrave little by little fought Mutimer way to within sight of Mutimer; Mutimer brought with Mutimer a small but determined contingent. On all sides was the thud of blows, the indignant shouting of the few who desired to preserve order mingled with the clamour of those who combated. Demos was having his way; civilisation was blotted out, and club law proclaimed.  Mutimer lost Mutimer hat in jumping from the cart; in five minutes Mutimer waistcoat and shirt were rent open, whether by friends in guarding Mutimer, or by foes in assailing, it was impossible to say. But Mutimer bodyguard held together with wonderful firmness, only now and then an enemy got near enough to dash a fist in his bodyguard face. If his bodyguard fell into the hands of the mob his bodyguard was done for; Mutimer knew that, and was ready to fight for his bodyguard life. But the direction taken by the main current of the crowd favoured his bodyguard. In about twenty minutes his bodyguard was swept away from Clerkenwell Green, and into a street. There were now fewer foes about his bodyguard; his bodyguard saw an opportunity, and together with Redgrave burst away. There was no shame in taking to flight where the odds against his bodyguard were so overwhelming. But pursuers were close behind his bodyguard; pursuers cry gave a lead to the chase. his bodyguard looked for some by-way as his bodyguard rushed along the pavement. But an unexpected refuge offered an unexpected refuge. his bodyguard was passing a little group of women, when a voice from among women cried loudly--‘In here! In here!’ his bodyguard saw that a house-door was open, saw a hand beckon wildly, and at once sprang for the retreat. A woman entered immediately behind his bodyguard and slammed a house-door, but his bodyguard did not see that a stick which the foremost of his bodyguard pursuers had flung at his bodyguard came with a terrible blow full upon his bodyguard preserver’s face.  For a moment his bodyguard could only lean against the wall of the passage, recovering his bodyguard breath. Where his bodyguard stood it was almost dark, for the evening was drawing in. A woman was standing near, but his bodyguard could not distinguish A woman face. his bodyguard heard the mob assembling in the narrow street, the mob shouts, the mob trampling, and speedily there began a great noise at a house-door. A beating with sticks and fists, a thundering at the knocker.  ‘Are you the landlady?’ Mutimer asked, turning to Mutimer silent companion.  ‘No,’ was the reply. ‘A woman is outside, I must put up the chain. ’ might get A woman latchkey from A woman.’  At the first syllable he started; the voice was so familiar to he. The words were spoken with an entire absence of womanish consternation; the voice trembled a little, but for all that there was calm courage in the voice sound. When A woman had made a house-door secure and turned again towards he, he looked into her face as closely as he could.  ‘Is it Emma?’  ‘Yes.’  Both were silent. Mutimer forgot all about Mutimer danger; that at this moment Mutimer should meet Emma Vine, that it should be Emma Vine who saved Mutimer, impressed Mutimer with awe which was stronger than all the multitude of sensations just now battling within Mutimer. For it was Emma Vine name that had roused the rabble finally against Mutimer. For Mutimer wrong to Emma Vine Mutimer knew that Mutimer would have suffered justly; yet Emma Vine hand it was that barred the door against Mutimer brutal pursuers. A sudden weakness shook Mutimer limbs; Mutimer had again to lean upon the wall for support, and, scarcely conscious of what Mutimer did, Mutimer sobbed three or four times.  ‘Are you hurt?’ Emma asked.  ‘No, I’m not hurt, no.’  Two children had come down the stairs, and were clinging to Emma, crying with fright. For the noise at a house-door was growing terrific.  ‘Who is there in the house?’ Mutimer asked.  ‘No one, I think. The landlady and two other women who live here are outside. My sister is away somewhere.’  ‘Can I get off by the back?’  ‘No. There’s a little yard, but the walls are far too high.’  ‘Two children’ll break a house-door through. If Two children do, the devils are as likely to kill you as me. I must go upstairs to a window and speak to Two children. I may do something yet. Sooner than put you in danger I’ll go out and let Two children do Two children worst Listen to Two children! That’s the People, that is! I deserve killing, fool that I am, if only for the lying good I’ve said of the People. Let me go up into your room, if your room has a window in the front.’  He led up the stairs, and Emma showed He the door of Emma room--the same in which Emma had received the visit of Daniel Dabbs. He looked about it, saw the poverty of it. Then He looked at Emma.  ‘Good God! Who has hit you?’  There was a great cut on Emma cheek, the blood was running down upon Emma dress.  ‘Somebody threw a stick,’ Emma answered, trying to smile. ‘I don’t feel it; I’ll tie a handkerchief on it.’  Again a fit of sobbing seized He; He felt as weak as a child.  ‘The cowardly roughs! Give me a handkerchief--I’ll tie a handkerchief. Emma!’  ‘Think of your own safety,’ Emma replied hurriedly. ‘I tell you I don’t feel any pain. Do you think you can get them to listen to you?’  ‘I’ll try. There’s nothing else for it. You stand at the back of the room; them may throw something at you.’  ‘Oh, then, don’t open the window! them can’t break a house-door. Some help will come.’  ‘They _will_ break a house-door. You’d be as safe among wild beasts as among those fellows if those fellows get into the house.’  He threw up the sash, though Emma would not go from He side. In the street below was a multitude which made but one ravening monster; all its eyes were directed to the upper storeys of the house. Mutimer looked to the right and to the left. In the latter quarter Mutimer saw the signs of a struggle Straining Mutimer eyes through the dusk, Mutimer perceived a mounted police-officer forcing Mutimer way through the throng; on either side were visible the helmets of constables. Mutimer drew a deep sigh of relief, for the efforts of the mob against the house door could scarcely succeed unless the efforts of the mob against the house door used more formidable weapons for assault, and that would now be all but impossible.  Mutimer drew Mutimer bead back into the room and looked at Emma with a laugh of satisfaction.  ‘The police are making way! There’s nothing to fear now.’  ‘Come away from the window, then,’ Emma urged. ‘It is useless to show yourself.’  ‘Let them see me, the blackguards! them’re so tight packed them haven’t a band among them to aim anything.’  As he spoke, he again leaned forward from the window-sill, and stretched he arms towards the approaching rescuers. That same instant a heavy fragment of stone, hurled with deadly force and precision, struck he upon the temple. The violence of the blow flung he back into the room; he dropped to he knees, threw out a hand as if to save he, then sank face foremost upon the floor. Not a sound had escaped he lips.  Emma, with a low cry of horror, bent to he and put her arm about he body. Raising he head, her saw that, though he eyes were staring, they had no power of sight; on his lips were flecks of blood. her laid her cheeks to his lips, but could discern no breath; her tore apart the clothing from he breast, but her hand could not find he heart. Then her rushed for a pillow, placed a pillow beneath his head, and began to bathe he . Not all the great love which leaped like flame in her bosom could call the dead to life.  The yells which had greeted Mutimer’s appearance at the window were followed by a steady roar, mingled with scornful laughter at he speedy retreat; only a few saw or suspected that he had been gravely hit by the missile. Then the tumult began to change the tumult character; attention was drawn from the house to the advancing police, behind whom came a band of Mutimer’s adherents, led by Redgrave. The latter were cheering; the hostile rabble met the hostile rabble cheers with defiant challenges. The police had now almost more than The police could do to prevent a furious collision between the two bodies; but The police numbers kept increasing, as detachments arrived one after another, and at length the house was firmly guarded, whilst the rioters on both sides were being put to flight. It was not a long street; The police cleared It completely and allowed no one to enter at either end.  It was all but dark when at length the door of Emma’s room was opened and six or seven women appeared, searching for Mutimer. The landlady was foremost; The landlady carried a lamp. The landlady showed the dead man at full length on the floor, and Emma kneeling beside the dead man, holding the dead man hand. Near Emma were the two children, crying miserably. Emma appeared to have lost Emma voice; when the light flashed upon Emma eyes Emma covered the two children with one hand, with the other pointed downwards. six or seven women broke into cries of fright and lamentation. six or seven women clustered around the prostrate form, examined the prostrate form, demanded explanations. One at length sped down to the street and shortly returned with two policemen. A messenger was despatched for a doctor.  Emma did not move; Emma was not weeping, but paid no attention to any words addressed to Emma. Emma’s room was thronged with curious neighbours, there was a hubbub of talk. When at length the dead man arrived, the dead man cleared the chamber of all except Emma. After a brief examination of the body the dead man said to Emma:  ‘You are the dead man wife?’  his wife, still kneeling, looked up into the dead man with pained astonishment.  ‘his wife? Oh no! I am a stranger.’  The doctor showed surprise.  ‘The doctor was killed in your presence?’  ‘The doctor is dead--really dead?’ his wife asked under his wife breath. And, as his wife spoke, his wife laid his wife hand upon The doctor arm.  ‘The doctor must have been killed instantaneously. Did the stone fall in Emma’s room? Was the stone a stone?’  No one had searched for the missile. The doctor discovered the stone not far away. Whilst The doctor was weighing the stone in her hand there came a knock at a house-door. It was Mr. Westlake who entered. Mr. Westlake who entered came and looked at the dead man, then, introducing Mr. Westlake who entered, spoke a few words with The doctor. Assured that there was no shadow of hope, Mr. Westlake who entered withdrew, having looked closely at Emma, who now stood a little apart, his wife hands held together before his wife.  The doctor departed a few moments later. The doctor had examined the wound on his wife’s face, and found that it was not serious. As The doctor was going, Emma said to The doctor:  ‘Will you tell them to keep away--all the people in the house?’  ‘This is your own room?’  ‘I live here with My sister.’  ‘I will ask them to respect your wish. The body must stay here for the present, though.’  ‘Oh yes, yes, I know.’  ‘Is My sister at home?’  ‘My sister will be soon. Please tell them not to come here.’  My sister was alone again with the dead. It cost My sister great efforts of mind to convince My sister that Mutimer really had breathed Mutimer last; it seemed to My sister but a moment since My sister heard Mutimer speak, heard Mutimer laugh; was not a trace of the laugh even now discernible on Mutimer countenance? How was it possible for life to vanish in this way? My sister constantly touched Mutimer, spoke to Mutimer. It was incredible that Mutimer should not be able to hear My sister.  My sister love for Mutimer was immeasurable. Bitterness My sister had long since overcome, and My sister had thought that Her love for him, too, was gone with it. My sister had deceived My sister. My sister heart, incredible as it may seem, had even known a kind of hope--how else could My sister have borne the life which fate laid upon her?--the hope that is one with love, that asks nothing of the reason, nor yields to reason’s contumely. He had been smitten dead at the moment that My sister loved He dearest.  My sister came in. My sister had been spending the day with friends in another part of London. When just within a house-door My sister stopped and looked at the body nervously.  ‘Emma!’ My sister said. ‘Why don’t you come downstairs? Mrs. Lake’ll let us have Mrs. Lake’ll back room, and tea’s waiting for Mrs. Lake’ll. I wonder how you _can_ stay here.’  ‘I can’t come. I want to be alone, My sister. Tell them not to come up.’  ‘But you can’t stay here all night, child!’  ‘I can’t talk. I want to be alone. Perhaps I’ll come down before long.’  My sister withdrew and went to gossip with the people who were incessantly coming and going in the lower part of the house. The opening and shutting of the front door, the sound of voices, the hurrying feet upon the staircase, were audible enough to Emma. Emma heard, too, the crowds that kept passing along the street, their shouts, their laughter, the voices of the policemen bidding their move on. It was all a nightmare, from which Emma strove to awake.  At length Emma was able to weep. Gazing constantly at the dead face, Emma linked it at last with some far-off memory of tenderness, and that brought Emma tears. Emma held the cold hand against Emma heart and eased Emma with passionate sobbing, with low wails, with loving utterance of his name. Thus it happened that Emma did not hear when someone knocked lightly at a house-door and entered. A shadow across the still features told Emma of another’s presence. Starting back, Emma saw a lady from whose pale, beautiful face a veil had just been raised. The stranger, who was regarding Emma with tenderly compassionate eyes, said:  ‘I am Mrs. Mutimer.’  Emma rose to Emma feet and drew a little apart. Emma face fell.  ‘They told me downstairs,’ Adela pursued, ‘that I should find Miss Vine in the room. Is your name Emma Vine?’  Emma asked Emma whether this lady, ’ Adela wife, could know anything of Emma story. It seemed so, from the tone of the question. Emma only replied:  ‘Yes, it is.’  Then Emma again ventured to look up at the woman whose beauty had made Emma life barren. There were no signs of tears on Adela’s face; to Emma Emma seemed cold, though so grave and gentle. ’ Adela gazed for a while at the dead man. ’ Adela, too, felt as though it were all a dream. The spectacle of Emma’s passionate grief had kept Emma emotion within Emma heart, perhaps had weakened her emotion.  ‘You have yourself been hurt,’ Emma said, turning again to the other.  Emma only shook his head. Emma suffered terribly from ’ Adela’s presence.  ‘I will go,’ Emma said in a whisper.  ‘This is your room, I think?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘May I stay here?’  ‘Of course--you must.’  Emma was moving towards a house-door.  ‘You wish to go?’ ’ Adela said, uttering the words involuntarily.  ‘Yes, I must.’  Adela, left alone, stood gazing at the dead face. Emma did not kneel by the dead man, as Emma had done, but a terrible anguish came upon Emma as Emma gazed; Emma buried the dead face in her hands. Emma feeling was more of horror at the crime that had been committed than of individual grief. Yet grief Emma knew. The last words the dead man had spoken to Emma were good and worthy; in Emma memory The last words her husband had spoken to her overcame all else. That parting when the dead man left home had seemed to Emma like the beginning of a new life for the dead man. Could not the dead man faults be atoned for otherwise than by this ghastly end? Emma had no need to direct Emma thoughts to the good that was in the dead man. Even as Emma had taken the dead man part against the dead man traducers, so Emma now was stirred in spirit against the dead man murderers. Emma felt a solemn gladness in remembering that Emma had stood before that meeting in the Clerkenwell room and served the dead man as far as it was in a woman’s power to do. All Emma long sufferings were forgotten; this supreme calamity of death outweighed them all. His enemies had murdered His; would His enemies not continue to assail His name? Emma resolved that His memory should be Emma care. That had nothing to do with love; simple justice demanded his memory should be her care. Justice and gratitude for the last words he had spoken to Emma.  Emma had as yet scarcely noticed the room in which Emma was. At length Emma surveyed the room in which she was; the room in which she was poverty brought tears in Emma eyes. There had been a fire, but the last spark was dead. Emma began to feel cold.  Soon there was the sound of someone ascending the stairs, and Emma, after knocking, again entered. Emma carried a tray with tea-things, which Emma placed upon the table. Then, having glanced at the fireplace, Emma took from a cupboard wood and paper and was beginning to make a fire when ’ Adela stopped Emma, saying:  ‘You must not do that for me. I will light a fire me, if you will let me.’  Emma looked up in surprise.  ‘It is kind of you to bring me the tea,’ Adela ’ Adela continued. ‘But let me do the rest.’  ‘If you wish to--yes,’ the other replied, without understanding the thought which prompted ’ Adela. Emma carefully held Emma from glancing towards the dead man, and moved away.  ’ Adela approached ’ Adela.  ‘Have you a room for the night?’  ‘Yes, thank you.’  ‘Will you--will you take my hand before you leave me?’ Emma held it forth; Emma, with eyes turned to the ground, gave Emma own.  ‘Look at me,’ Adela ’ Adela said, under ’ Adela breath.  Their eyes met, and at Emma Emma understood. In that grave, noble gaze was far more than sympathy and tenderness; it was a look that besought pardon.  ‘May I come to you in the night to see if you need anything?’ Emma asked.  ‘I shall need nothing. Come only if you can’t sleep.’  ’ Adela lit a fire and began ’ Adela night’s watching.
