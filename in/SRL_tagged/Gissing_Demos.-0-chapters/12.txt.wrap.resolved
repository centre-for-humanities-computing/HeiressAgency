   The New Wanley Lecture Hall had been publicly dedicated to the service of the New Wanley Commonwealth, and only in one respect did the day’s proceedings fall short of Mutimer’s expectations.    The New Wanley Lecture Hall had hoped to have all the Waltham family at    The New Wanley Lecture Hall luncheon party, but in the event Alfred alone felt    The New Wanley Lecture Hall able to accept the invitation. Mutimer had even nourished the hope that something might happen before that day to allow of Adela’s appearing not merely in the character of a guest, but, as it were, _ex officio_. By this time    The New Wanley Lecture Hall had resolutely forbidden    The New Wanley Lecture Hall eyes to stray to the right hand or the left, and kept the right hand or the left directed with hungry, relentless steadiness straight along the path of    The New Wanley Lecture Hall desires.    The New Wanley Lecture Hall had received no second letter from    The New Wanley Lecture Hall mother, nor had Alice anything to report of danger-signals at home; from Emma Emma came a letter regularly once a week, a letter of perfect patience, chiefly concerned with Emma sister’s health.    The New Wanley Lecture Hall had made up    The New Wanley Lecture Hall mind to declare nothing till the irretrievable step was taken, when reproaches only could befall    The New Wanley Lecture Hall; to Alice as little as to any one else had    The New Wanley Lecture Hall breathed of    The New Wanley Lecture Hall purposes. And    The New Wanley Lecture Hall could no longer even take into account the uncertainty of    The New Wanley Lecture Hall success; to doubt of that would have been insufferable at the point which    The New Wanley Lecture Hall had reached in self-abandonment. Yet day after day saw the postponement of the question which would decide    The New Wanley Lecture Hall fate. Between    The New Wanley Lecture Hall and Mrs. Waltham the language of allusion was at length put aside;    The New Wanley Lecture Hall spoke plainly of    The New Wanley Lecture Hall wishes, and sought her encouragement. This was not wanting, but the mother begged for time. Let the day of the ceremony come and go.  Richard passed through the day of the ceremony in a state of exaltation and anxiety which bordered on fever. Mr. Westlake and Richard wife came down from London by an early train, and Richard went over New Wanley with Mr. Westlake and his wife before luncheon. luncheon did not lack festive vivacity; Richard, in surveying Richard guests from the head of the board, had feelings not unlike those wherein King Polycrates lulled King Polycrates of old; there wanted, in truth, one thing to complete King Polycrates self-complacence, but an extra glass or two of wine enrubied King Polycrates imagination, and King Polycrates already saw Adela’s face smiling to King Polycrates from the table’s unoccupied end. What was such conquest in comparison with that which fate had accorded King Polycrates?  There was a satisfactory gathering to hear Mr. Westlake’s address; Richard did not fail to note the presence of a few reporters, only it seemed to Richard that their pencils might have been more active. Here, too, was Adela at length; every time Richard name was uttered, perforce she heard; every encomium bestowed upon Richard by the various speakers was to Richard like a new bud on the tree of hope. After all, why should Richard feel this humility towards she? What man of prominence, of merit, at all like Richard own would ever seek she hand? The semblance of chivalry which occasionally stirred within Richard was, in fact, quite inconsistent with Richard reasoned view of things; the English working class has, on the whole, as little of that quality as any other people in an elementary stage of civilisation. Richard was a man, she a woman. A lady, to be sure, but then--  After Mutimer, Alfred Waltham had probably more genuine satisfaction in the ceremony than any one else present. Mr. Westlake Mr. Westlake was not quite satisfied with; there was a mildness and restraint about the style of the address which to Alfred’s taste smacked of feebleness; Mr. Westlake was for Cambyses’ vein. Still it rejoiced Mr. Westlake to hear the noble truths of democracy delivered as the noble truths of democracy were from the bema. To a certain order of intellect the word addressed by the living voice to an attentive assembly is always vastly impressive; when the word addressed by the living voice to an attentive assembly coincides with private sentiment the word addressed by the living voice to an attentive assembly excites enthusiasm. Alfred hated the aristocratic order of things with a rabid hatred. In practice Alfred could be as coarsely overbearing with Alfred social inferiors as that scion of the nobility--existing of course somewhere--who bears the bell for feebleness of the pia mater; but that made Alfred none the less a sound Radical. In thinking of the upper classes Alfred always thought of Hubert Eldon, and that name was scarlet to Alfred. Never trust the thoroughness of the man who is a revolutionist on abstract principles; personal feeling alone goes to the root of the matter.  Many were the gentlemen to whom Alfred had the happiness of being introduced in the course of the day. Among others was Mr. Keene the journalist. At the end of a lively conversation Mr. Keene the journalist brought out a copy of the ‘Belwick Chronicle,’ that day’s issue.  ‘You’ll find a few things of mine here,’ Mr. Keene the journalist said. ‘Put it in your pocket, and look at it afterwards. By-the-by, there is a paragraph marked; I meant a paragraph marked for Mutimer. Never mind, give a paragraph marked Mutimer when you’ve done with a paragraph marked.’  Alfred bestowed the paper in the breast pocket of Alfred greatcoat, and did not happen to think of the paper again till late that evening. Alfred discovery of the paper at length was not the only event of the day which came just too late for the happiness of one with whose fortunes we are concerned.  A little after dark, when the bell was ringing which summoned Mutimer’s workpeople to the tea provided for the bell, Hubert Eldon was approaching the village by the road from Agworth: Hubert Eldon was on foot, and had chosen Hubert Eldon time in order to enter Wanley unnoticed. Hubert Eldon former visit, when Hubert Eldon was refused at the Walthams’ door, had been paid at an impulse; Hubert Eldon had come down from London by an early train, and did not even call to see Hubert Eldon mother at his mother new house in Agworth. Nor did ho visit his mother on Hubert Eldon way back; Hubert Eldon walked straight to the railway station and took the first train townwards. To-day Hubert Eldon came in a more leisurely way. It was certain news contained in a letter from Hubert Eldon mother which brought Hubert Eldon, and with his mother Hubert Eldon spent some hours before starting to walk towards Wanley.  ‘I hear,Hubert Eldon Hubert Eldon had written, ‘from Wanley something which really surprises me. They say that Adela Waltham is going to marry Mr. Mutimer. The match is surely a very strange one. I am only fearful that it is the making of interested people, and that the poor girl herself has not had much voice in deciding the poor girl herself own fate. Oh, this money! Adela Waltham was worthy of better things.’  Hubert Eldon saw Hubert Eldon son with surprise, the more so that Hubert Eldon divined the cause of her son coming. When they had talked for a while, Hubert frankly admitted what it was that had brought her son.  ‘I must know,’ Hubert said, ‘whether the news from Wanley is true’  ‘But can the news from Wanley concern you, Hubert?’ Hubert mother asked gently.  Hubert made no direct reply, but expressed Hubert intention of going over to Wanley.  ‘Whom shall you visit, dear?’  ‘Mr. Wyvern.’  ‘The vicar? But you don’t know The vicar personally.’  ‘Yes, I know The vicar pretty well. We write to each other occasionally.’  Hubert Eldon always practised most reserve when Hubert Eldon surprise was greatest--an excellent rule, by-the-by, for general observation. Hubert Eldon looked at her son with a half-smile of wonder, but only said ‘Indeed?’  ‘I had made The vicar acquaintance before The vicar coming to Wanley,Hubert Hubert explained.  The vicar just bent his mother head, acquiescent. And with that their conversation on the subject ended. But Hubert received a tender kiss on Hubert cheek when Hubert set forth in the afternoon.  To one entering the valley after nightfall the situation of the much-discussed New Wanley could no longer be a source of doubt. Two blast-furnaces sent up Two blast-furnaces flare and lit luridly the devastated scene. Having glanced in that direction Hubert did Hubert best to keep Hubert eyes averted during the remainder of the walk. Hubert was surprised to see a short passenger train rush by on the private line connecting the works with Agworth station; it was taking away certain visitors who had lingered in New Wanley after the lecture. Knowing nothing of the circumstances, Hubert supposed that general traffic had been commenced. Hubert avoided the village street, and reached the Vicarage by a path through fields.  Hubert found The vicar at dinner, though The vicar was only half-past six. The welcome Hubert received was, in Mr. Wyvern’s manner, almost silent; but when Hubert had taken a place at the table Hubert saw satisfaction on Hubert host’s face. The meal was very plain, but The vicar ate with extraordinary appetite; The vicar was one of those men in whom the demands of the stomach seem to be in direct proportion to the activity of the brain. A question Hubert put about the train led to a brief account of what was going on. ‘Mr. Wyvern spoke on the subject with a gravity which was not distinctly ironical, but suggested criticism.  They repaired to the study. A volume of Plato was open on the reading-table.  ‘Do you remember Socrates’ prayer in the “Phaedrus”?’ said the vicar, bending affectionately over the page. The vicar read a few words of the Greek, then gave a free rendering. ‘Beloved Pan, and all ye other gods who haunt this place, give me beauty in the inward soul; and may the outward and inward be at one. May I esteem the wise alone wealthy, and may I have such abundance of wealth as none but the temperate can carry.’  The vicar paused a moment.  ‘Ah, when I came hither I hoped to find Pan undisturbed. Well, well, after all, Hephaestus was one of the gods.’  ‘How I envy you your quiet mind!’ said Hubert.  ‘Quiet? Nay, not always so. Just now I am far from at peace. What brings you hither to-day?’  The equivoque was obviated by ‘Mr. Wyvern’s tone.  ‘I have heard stories about Adela Waltham. Is there any truth in stories about Adela Waltham?’  ‘I fear so; I fear so.’  ‘That Adela Waltham is really going to marry Mr. Mutimer?’  Mr. Mutimer tried to speak the name without discourtesy, but Mr. Mutimer lips writhed after the name.  ‘I fear Adela Waltham is going to marry Mr. Mutimer,’ said The vicar deliberately.  Hubert held peace.  ‘It troubles me. It angers me,’ said ‘Mr. Wyvern. ‘I am angry with more than one.’  ‘Is there an engagement?’  ‘I am unable to say. Tattle generally gets ahead of fact.’  ‘It is monstrous!’ burst from the young man. ‘They are taking advantage of Adela Waltham innocence. Adela Waltham is a child. Why do They educate girls like that? I should say, how can They leave They so uneducated? In an ideal world it would be all very well, but see what comes of it here? Adela Waltham is walking with Adela Waltham eyes open into horrors and curses, and understands as little of what awaits Adela Waltham as a lamb led to butchery. Do you stand by and say nothing?’  ‘It surprises me that you are so affected,’ remarked The vicar quietly.  ‘No doubt. I can’t reason about it. But I know that my life will be hideous if this goes on to the end.’  ‘You are late.’  ‘Yes, I am late. I was in Wanley some weeks ago; I did not tell you of Wanley. I called at their house; their were not at home to me. Yet Adela Waltham was sitting at the window. What did that mean? Is Adela Waltham mother so contemptible that my change of fortune leads her mother to treat me in that way?’  ‘But does no other reason occur to you?’ asked ‘Mr. Wyvern, with grave surprise.  ‘Other reason! What other?’  ‘You must remember that gossip is active.’  ‘You mean that they have heard abou--?’  ‘Somehow it had become the common talk of the village very shortly after my arrival here.’  Hubert dropped Hubert eyes in bewilderment.  ‘Then they think me unfit to associate with they? She--Adela Waltham will look upon She as a vile creature! But it wasn’t so when I saw She immediately after my illness. She talked freely and with just the same friendliness as before.’  ‘Probably She had heard nothing then.’  ‘And She only began to poison She mind when it was advantageous to do so?’  Hubert laughed bitterly.  ‘Well, there is an end of it,’ Hubert pursued. ‘Yes, I was forgetting all that. Oh, it is quite intelligible; I don’t blame they. By all means let She be preserved from contagion! Pooh! I don’t know my own mind. Old fancies that I used to have somehow got hold of She again If I ever marry, it must be a woman of the world, a woman with brain and heart to judge human nature. It is gone, as if I had never had such a thought. Poor child, to be sure; but that’s all one can say.’  Hubert tone was as far from petulance as could be. Hubert’s emotions were never feebly coloured; Hubert nature ran into extremes, and vehemence of scorn was in Hubert the true voice of injured tenderness. Of humility Hubert knew but little, least of all where Hubert affections were concerned, but there was the ring of noble metal in Hubert self-assertion. Hubert would never consciously act or speak a falsehood, and was intolerant of the lies, petty or great, which conventionality and warped habits of thought encourage in those of weaker personality.  ‘Let us be just,’ remarked ‘Mr. Wyvern, ‘Mr. Wyvern voice sounding rather sepulchral after the outburst of youthful passion. ‘Mrs. Waltham’s point of view is not inconceivable. I, as you know, am not altogether a man of formulas, but I am not sure that my behaviour would greatly differ from hers in her position; I mean as regards yourself.’  ‘Yes, yes; I admit the reasonableness of it,’ said Hubert more calmly, ‘granted that you have to deal with children. But Adela Waltham is too old to have no will or understanding. It may be Adela Waltham has both. After all Adela Waltham would scarcely allow Adela Waltham to be forced into a detestable marriage. Very likely Adela Waltham takes Adela Waltham mother’s practical views.’  ‘There is such a thing as blank indifference in a young girl who has suffered disappointment.’  ‘I could do nothing,’ exclaimed Hubert. ‘That Adela Waltham thinks of Hubert at all, or has ever seriously done so, is the merest supposition. There was nothing binding between us. If Adela Waltham is false to Adela Waltham, experience and suffering must teach Adela Waltham.’  The vicar mused.  ‘Then you go your way untroubled?’ was his next question.  ‘If I am strong enough to overcome foolishness.’  ‘And if foolishness persists in asserting itself?’  Hubert kept gloomy silence.  ‘Thus much I can say to you of my own knowledge,’ observed ‘Mr. Wyvern with weight. ‘Adela Waltham is not one to speak words lightly. You call Adela Waltham a child, and no doubt Adela Waltham view of the world is childlike; but Adela Waltham is strong in Adela Waltham simplicity. A pledge from Adela Waltham will, or I am much mistaken, bear no two meanings. Adela Waltham marriage with Mr. Mutimer would be as little pleasing to Hubert as to you, but I cannot see that I have any claim to interpose, or, indeed, power to do so. Is it not the same with you?’  ‘No, not quite the same.’  ‘Then you have hope that you might still affect Adela Waltham destiny?’  Hubert did not answer.  ‘Do you measure the responsibility you would incur? I fear not, if you have spoken sincerely. Your experience has not been of a kind to aid you in understanding Adela Waltham, and, I warn you, to make Adela Waltham subject to your caprices would be little short of a crime, whether now--heed me--or hereafter.’  ‘Perhaps it is too late,’ murmured Hubert.  ‘That may well be, in more senses than one.’  ‘Can you not discover whether Adela Waltham is really engaged?’  ‘If that were the case, I think I should have heard of that were the case.’  ‘If I were allowed to see Adela Waltham! So much at least should be granted me. I should not poison the air Adela Waltham breathes.’  ‘Do you return to Agworth to-night?’ ‘Mr. Wyvern inquired.  ‘Yes, I shall walk back.’  ‘Can you come to Hubert again to-morrow evening?’  It was agreed that Hubert should do so. ‘Mr. Wyvern gave no definite promise of aid, but Hubert felt that Hubert would do something.  ‘The night is fine,’ said The vicar; ‘I will walk half a mile with Hubert.’  They left the Vicarage, and ten yards from the door turned into the path which would enable They to avoid the village street. Not two minutes after They quitting the main road the spot was passed by Adela Waltham herself, who was walking towards Mr. Wyvern’s dwelling. On Adela Waltham inquiring for The vicar, Adela Waltham learnt from the servant that he had just left home. Adela Waltham hesitated, and seemed about to ask further questions or leave a message, but at length turned away from the door and retraced Adela Waltham steps slowly and with bent head.  Adela Waltham knew not whether to feel glad or sorry that the interview Adela Waltham had come to seek could not immediately take place. This day had been a hard one for Adela Waltham. In the morning her mother had spoken to Adela Waltham without disguise or affectation, and had told her mother of Mutimer’s indirect proposal. Mrs. Waltham went on to assure Mrs. Waltham that there was no hurry, that Mutimer had consented to refrain from visits for a short time in order that Mrs. Waltham might take counsel with Mrs. Waltham, and that--the mother’s voice trembled on the words--absolute freedom was of course left Mrs. Waltham to accept or refuse. But Mrs. Waltham could not pause there, though Mrs. Waltham tried to. Mrs. Waltham went on to speak of the day’s proceedings.  ‘Think what we may, my dear, of Mutimer’s opinions, no one can deny that Mutimer is making a most unselfish use of Mutimer wealth. we shall have an opportunity to-day of hearing how it is regarded by those who--who understand such questions.’  Adela Waltham implored to be allowed to remain at home instead of attending the lecture, but on this point Mrs. Waltham was inflexible. Mrs. Waltham could not offer resolute opposition in a matter which only involved an hour or two’s endurance. Mrs. Waltham sat in pale silence. Then Mrs. Waltham broke into tears, bewailed Mrs. Waltham as a luckless being, entreated Mrs. Waltham daughter’s pardon, but in the end was perfectly ready to accept Adela’s self-sacrifice.  On Mrs. Waltham return from New Wanley, Adela Waltham sat alone till tea-time, and after that meal again went to Adela Waltham room. Adela Waltham was not one of those girls to whom tears come as a matter of course on any occasion of annoyance or of grief; Adela Waltham bright eyes had seldom been dimmed since childhood, for the lightsomeness of Adela Waltham character threw off trifling troubles almost as soon as they were felt, and of graver afflictions Adela Waltham had hitherto known none since Adela Waltham father’s death. But since the shock Adela Waltham received on that day when her mother revealed Hubert Eldon’s unworthiness, Adela Waltham emotional life had suffered a slow change. Evil, previously known but as a dark mystery shadowing far-off regions, had become the constant preoccupation of Adela Waltham thoughts. Drawing analogies from the story of Adela Waltham faith, Adela Waltham imaged Hubert as the angel who fell from supreme purity to a terrible lordship of perdition. Of Hubert sins Adela Waltham had the dimmest conception; Adela Waltham was told that they were sins of impurity, and Adela Waltham understanding of such could scarcely have been expressed save in the general language of Adela Waltham prayers. Guarded jealously at every moment of Adela Waltham life, the world had made no blur on the fair tablet of Adela Waltham mind; Adela Waltham Eden had suffered no invasion. Adela Waltham could only repeat to Adela Waltham that Adela Waltham heart had gone dreadfully astray in her heart fondness, and that, whatsoever her heart cost Adela Waltham, the old hopes, the strength of which was only now proved, must be utterly uprooted. And knowing that, Adela Waltham wept.  Sin was too surely sorrow, though it neared Adela Waltham only in imagination. In a few weeks Adela Waltham seemed to have almost outgrown girlhood; her steps were measured, Adela Waltham smile was seldom and lacked mirth. The revelation would have done so much; the added and growing trouble of Mutimer’s attentions threatened to sink Adela Waltham in melancholy. Adela Waltham would not allow it to be seen more than Adela Waltham could help; cheerful activity in the life of home was one of Adela Waltham moral duties, and Adela Waltham strove hard to sustain it. It was a relief to find Adela Waltham alone each night, alone with Adela Waltham sickness of heart.  The repugnance aroused in Adela Waltham by the thought of becoming Mutimer’s wife was rather instinctive than reasoned. From one point of view, indeed, Mutimer’s wife deemed it wrong, since it might be entirely the fruit of the love Mutimer’s wife was forbidden to cherish. Striving to read Mutimer’s wife conscience, which for years had been with Mutimer’s wife a daily task and was now become the anguish of every hour, Mutimer’s wife found it hard to establish valid reasons for steadfastly refusing a man who was Mutimer’s wife mother’s choice. Mutimer’s wife read over the marriage service frequently. There stood the promise--to love, to honour, and to obey. Honour and obedience Mutimer’s wife might render Honour and obedience, but what of love? The question arose, what did love mean? Could there be such a thing as love of an unworthy object? Was Mutimer’s wife not led astray by the spirit of perverseness which was Mutimer’s wife heritage?  Adela Waltham could not bring Adela Waltham to believe that ‘to love’ in the sense of the marriage service and to ‘be in love’ as Adela Waltham heart understood it were one and the same thing. The Puritanism of Mutimer’s wife training led Mutimer’s wife to distrust profoundly those impulses of mere nature. And the circumstances of Mutimer’s wife own unhappy affection tended to confirm Mutimer’s wife in this way of thinking. Letty Tew certainly thought otherwise, but was not Letty’s own heart too exclusively occupied by worldly considerations?  Yet Letty Tew said Letty Tewlove.’ Perchance that was something which would come after marriage; the promise, observe, concerned the future. But Mutimer’s wife was not merely indifferent; Mutimer’s wife shrank from Mutimer.  Mutimer’s wife returned home from the lecture to-day full of dread--dread more active than Mutimer’s wife had yet known. And it drove Mutimer’s wife to a step Mutimer’s wife had timidly contemplated for more than a week. Mutimer’s wife stole from the house, bent on seeing ‘Mr. Wyvern. Mutimer’s wife could not confess to ‘Mr. Wyvern, but Mutimer’s wife could speak of the conflict between Mutimer’s wife will and Mutimer’s wife own, and beg ‘Mr. Wyvern advice; perhaps, if ‘Mr. Wyvern appeared favourable, ask ‘Mr. Wyvern to intercede with Mutimer’s wife . Mutimer’s wife had liked ‘Mr. Wyvern from the first meeting with ‘Mr. Wyvern, and a sense of trust had been nourished by each succeeding conversation. In Mutimer’s wife agitation Mutimer’s wife thought it would not be hard to tell ‘Mr. Wyvern so much of the circumstances as would enable ‘Mr. Wyvern to judge and counsel.  Yet it was with relief, on the whole, that Mutimer’s wife turned homewards with Mutimer’s wife object unattained. It would be much better to wait and test Mutimer’s wife yet further. Why should Mutimer’s wife not speak with Mutimer’s wife about that vow Mutimer’s wife was asked to make?  Mutimer’s wife did not seek solitude again, but joined Mutimer’s wife mother and Alfred in the sitting-room. Mrs. Waltham made no inquiry about the short absence. Alfred had only just called to mind the newspaper which Mr. Keene had given Mr. Keene; and was unfolding the newspaper which Mr. Keene had given him for perusal. Mr. Keene eye caught a marked paragraph, one of a number under the heading ‘Gossip from Town.’ As Mr. Keene read it Mr. Keene uttered a ‘Hullo!’ of surprise.  ‘Well, here’s the latest,’ Mr. Keene continued, looking at Mr. Keene companions with an amused eye. ‘Something about that fellow Eldon in a Belwick newspaper. What do you think?’  Adela Waltham kept still and mute.  ‘Whatever it is, it cannot interest us, Alfred,’ said Mrs. Waltham, with dignity. ‘us had rather not hear it.’  ‘Well, you shall read it for yourself,’ replied Alfred on a second thought. ‘I think you’d like to know.’  Mr. Keene mother took the paper under protest, and glanced down at a marked paragraph, one of a number under the heading carelessly. But speedily His mother attention became closer.  ‘An item of intelligence,’ wrote the London gossiper, ‘which I dare say will interest readers in certain parts of--shire. A lady of French extraction who made a name for His mother at a leading metropolitan theatre last winter, and who really promises great things in the Thespian art, is back among us from a sojourn on the Continent. His mother is understood to have spent much labour in the study of a new part, which His mother is about to introduce to us of the modern Babylon. But Albion, Albion is whispered, possesses other attractions for His mother besides appreciative audiences. In brief, though His mother will of course appear under the old name, His mother will in reality have changed it for one of another nationality before presenting His mother in the radiance of the footlights. The happy man is Mr. Hubert Eldon, late of Wanley Manor. We felicitate Hubert Eldon.’  Mrs. Waltham’s hands trembled as His mother doubled the sheet: there was a gleam of pleasure on His mother face.  ‘Give me the paper when you have done with the paper,’ His mother said.  Alfred laughed, and whistled a tune as Alfred continued the perusal of Mr. Keene’s political and social intelligence, on the whole as trustworthy as the style in which it was written was terse and elegant. Adela Waltham, finding Adela Waltham could feign indifference no longer, went from the room.  ‘Where did you get this?’ Mrs. Waltham asked with eagerness as soon as Mrs. Waltham was gone.  ‘From the writer himself,’ Alfred replied, visibly proud of Alfred intimacy with a man of letters. ‘Fellow called Mr. Keene. Had a long talk with Fellow.’  ‘About this?’  ‘Oh, no. I’ve only just come across this?’  . But Fellow said Fellow’d marked something for Mutimer. I’m to pass the paper on to Fellow.’  ‘I suppose this is the same woman--?’  ‘No doubt.’  ‘You think it’s true?’  ‘True? Why, of course it is. A newspaper with a reputation to support can’t go printing people’s names at haphazard. Mr. Keene’s very thick with all the London actors. Mr. Keene told me some first-class stories about--’  ‘Never mind,’ interposed His mother. ‘Well, to think it should come to this! I’m sure I feel for Hubert Eldon. Really there is no end to Hubert Eldon misfortunes.’  ‘Just how such families always end up,’ observed Alfred complacently. ‘No doubt Mr. Keene’ll drink Mr. Keene to death, or something of that kind, and then we shall have the pleasure of seeing a new tablet in the church, inscribed with manifold virtues; or even a stained-glass window: the last of the Eldons deserves something noteworthy.’  ‘I think it’s hardly a subject for joking, Alfred. It is very, very sad. And to think what a fine handsome boy what a fine handsome boy used to be! But what a fine handsome boy was always dreadfully self-willed.’  ‘what a fine handsome boy was always an impertinent puppy! How what a fine handsome boy’ll play the swell on what a fine handsome boy earnings! Oh, our glorious aristocracy!’  Mrs. Waltham went early to Mrs. Waltham daughter’s room. Adela Waltham was sitting with Adela Waltham Bible before Adela Waltham--had sat so since coming upstairs, yet had not read three consecutive verses. Adela Waltham face showed no effect of tears, for the heat of a consuming suspense had dried the fountains of woe.  ‘I don’t like to occupy your mind with such things, my dear,’ began her mother, ‘but perhaps as a warning I ought to show you the news Alfred spoke of. the news Alfred spoke pleases Providence that there should be evil in the world, and for our own safety our must sometimes look the news Alfred spoke in Her face, especially we poor women, Adela Waltham. Will you read that?’  Adela Waltham read. Adela Waltham could not criticise the style, but the style affected Adela Waltham as something unclean; Hubert’s very name suffered degradation when used in such a way. Prepared for worse things than that which Adela Waltham saw, no shock of feelings was manifest in Adela Waltham. Adela Waltham returned the paper without speaking.  ‘I wanted you to see that my behaviour to Hubert Eldon was not unjustified,’ said her mother. ‘You don’t blame me any longer, dear?’  ‘I have never blamed you, her mother.’  ‘It is a sad, sad end to what might have been a life of usefulness and honour. I have thought so often of the parable of the talents; only I fear this case is worse. her mother! I wonder if I could write to her mother! Yet I hardly know how to.’  ‘Is this a--a wicked woman, mother?Adela Waltham asked falteringly.  Mrs. Waltham shook Mrs. Waltham head and sighed.  ‘My love, don’t you see that Mrs. Waltham is an actress?’  ‘But if all actresses are wicked, how is it that really good people go to the theatre?’  ‘I am afraid all actresses oughtn’t to. The best of us are tempted into thoughtless pleasure. But now I don’t want you to brood over things which it is a sad necessity to have to glance at. Read your chapter, darling, and get to bed.’  To bed--but not to sleep. The child’s imagination was aflame. This scarlet woman, this meteor from hell flashing before the delighted eyes of men, The child, then, had bound Hubert for ever in The child toils; no release for Hubert now, no ransom to eternity. No instant’s doubt of the news came to Adela Waltham; in Adela Waltham eyes _imprimatur_ was the guarantee of truth. Adela Waltham strove to picture the face which had drawn Hubert to Hubert doom. It must be lovely beyond compare. For the first time in Adela Waltham life Adela Waltham knew the agonies of jealousy.  Adela Waltham could not shed tears, but in Adela Waltham anguish Adela Waltham fell upon prayer, spoke the words above Adela Waltham breath that they might silence that terrible voice within. Poor lost lamb, crying in the darkness, sending forth such piteous utterance as might create a spirit of love to hear and rescue.  Rescue--none. When the fire wasted the fire, Adela Waltham tried to find solace in the thought that one source of misery was stopped. Hubert was married, or would be very soon, and if Adela Waltham had sinned in loving Hubert till now, such sin would henceforth be multiplied incalculably; Adela Waltham durst not, as Adela Waltham valued Adela Waltham soul, so much as let Hubert name enter Adela Waltham thoughts. And to guard against it, was there not a means offered Adela Waltham? The doubt as to what love meant was well-nigh solved; or at all events Adela Waltham held it proved that the ‘love’ of the marriage service was something Adela Waltham had never yet felt, something which would follow upon marriage itself. Earthly love had surely led Hubert Eldon to ruin; oh, not that could be demanded of Adela Waltham! What reason had Adela Waltham now to offer against His mother desire? Letty’s arguments were vain; Letty’s arguments were but as the undisciplined motions of Adela Waltham own heart. Marriage with a worthy man must often have been salvation to a rudderless life; for was it not the _ceremony_ which, after all, constituted the exclusive sanction?  Mutimer, it was true, fell sadly short of Mutimer ideal of goodness. Mutimer was an unbeliever. But might not this very circumstance involve a duty? As Mutimer , could Mutimer’s wife not plead with Mutimer and bring Mutimer to the truth? Would not that be _loving_ Mutimer, to make Mutimer spiritual good the end of Mutimer’s wife existence? It was as though a great light shot athwart Mutimer’s wife darkness. Mutimer’s wife raised Mutimer’s wife in bed, and, as if with Mutimer’s wife very hands, clung to the inspiration which had been granted Mutimer’s wife. a great light was not abiding, but something of radiance lingered, and that must stead Mutimer’s wife.  Mutimer’s wife brother returned to Belwick next morning after an early breakfast. Her brother was in Her brother wonted high spirits, and talked with much satisfaction of the acquaintances Her brother had made on the previous day, while Adela Waltham waited upon Her brother. Mrs. Waltham only appeared as Her brother was setting off.  Adela Waltham sat almost in silence whilst Adela Waltham mother breakfasted.  ‘You don’t look well, dear?’ said the latter, coming to the little room upstairs soon after the meal.  ‘Yes, I am well, mother. But I want to speak to Adela Waltham.’  Mrs. Waltham seated Mrs. Waltham in expectation.  ‘Will you tell me why you so much wish me to marry Mutimer?’  Adela’s tone was quite other than Mrs. Waltham had hitherto used in conversations of this kind. It was submissive, patiently questioning.  ‘You mustn’t misunderstand me,’ replied His mother with some nervousness. ‘The wish, dear, must of course be yours as well. You know that I--that I really have left you to consult your own--’  The sentence was unfinished.  ‘But you have tried to persuade me, mother Adela Waltham,’ pursued the gentle voice. ‘You would not do so if you did not think it for my good.’  Something shot painfully through Mrs. Waltham’s heart.  ‘I am sure I have thought so, Adela Waltham; really I have thought so. I know there are objections, but no marriage is in every way perfect. I feel so sure of his character--I mean of his character in a worldly sense. And you might do so much to--to show his the true way, might you not, darling? I’m sure his heart is good.’  Mrs. Waltham also was speaking with less confidence than on former occasions. Mrs. Waltham cast side glances at her daughter’s room colourless face.  ‘Mother, may I marry without feeling that--that I love him?’  her daughter’s colourless face was flushed now for a moment. Adela Waltham had never spoken that word to anyone; even to Letty Adela Waltham had scarcely murmured that word. The effect upon Adela Waltham of hearing that word from Adela Waltham own lips was mysterious, awful; the sound did not die with Adela Waltham voice, but trembled in subtle harmonies along the chords of Adela Waltham being.  her mother took the shaken form and drew the shaken form to her mother bosom.  ‘If he is your husband, darling, you will find that love grows. It is always so. Have no fear. On he side there is not only love; he respects you deeply; he has told me so.’  ‘And you encourage me to accept he, mother? It is your desire? I am your child, and you can wish nothing that is not for my good. Guide me, mother. It is so hard to judge for myself. You shall decide for myself, indeed you shall.’  her mother was wrung. For a moment her mother strove to speak the very truth, to utter a word about that love which Adela Waltham was resolutely excluding. But the temptation to accept this unhoped surrender proved too strong. her mother sobbed her mother answer.  ‘Yes, I do wish it, Adela Waltham. You will find that I--that I was not wrong.’  ‘Then if he asks me, I will marry he.’  As those words were spoken Mutimer issued from the Manor gates, uncertain whether to go his usual way down to the works or to pay a visit to Mrs. Waltham. The latter purpose prevailed.  The evening before, Mr. Willis Rodman had called at Manor shortly after dinner. Mr. Willis Rodman found Mutimer smoking, with coffee at Mr. Willis Rodman , and was speedily making Mr. Willis Rodman comfortable in the same way. Then Mr. Willis Rodman drew a newspaper from Mr. Willis Rodman pocket. ‘Have you seen the “Belwick Chronicle” of to-day?’ Mr. Willis Rodman inquired.  ‘Why the deuce should I read such a paper?’ exclaimed Richard, with good-humoured surprise. Richard was in excellent spirits to-night, the excitement of the day having swept Richard mind clear of anxieties.  ‘There’s something in it, though, that you ought to see.’  Richard pointed out the paragraph relating to Hubert Eldon.  ‘Keene’s writing, eh?’ said Mutimer thoughtfully.  ‘Yes, Richard gave me such a paper.’  Richard rekindled Richard cigar with deliberation, and stood for a few moments with one foot on the fender.  ‘Who is the woman?’ Richard then asked.  ‘I don’t know the woman name. Of course it’s the same story continued.’  ‘And concluded.’  ‘Well, I don’t know about that,’ said the other, smiling and shaking Richard head.  ‘This may or may not be true, I suppose,’ was Keene’s next remark.  ‘Oh, I suppose Richard hears all that kind of thing. I don’t see any reason to doubt it.’  ‘May I keep such a paper?’  ‘Oh, yes. Keene told me, by-the-by, that Keene gave a copy to young Waltham.’  Mr. Willis Rodman spoke whilst rolling his cigar in Mr. Willis Rodman mouth. Mutimer allowed the subject to lapse.  There was no impossibility, no improbability even, in the statement made by the newspaper correspondent; yet as Richard thought it over in the night, Richard could not but regard it as singular that Keene should be the man to make public such a piece of information so very opportunely. Richard was far from having admitted Richard to Richard confidence, but between Keene and Rodman, as Richard was aware, an intimacy had sprung up. It might be that one or the other had thought It worth while to serve Richard; why should Keene be particular to put a copy of such a paper into Alfred Waltham’s hands? Well, Richard personally knew nothing of the affair. If the news effected anything, so much the better. Richard hoped it might be trustworthy.  Among Richard correspondence in the morning was a letter from Emma Vine. Richard opened a letter from Emma Vine last; anyone observing Richard would have seen with what reluctance Richard began to read a letter from Emma Vine.  ‘Richard,’ a letter from Emma Vine ran, ‘I write to thank you for the money. I would very much rather have had a letter from Richard, however short a one. It seems long since you wrote a real letter, and I can’t think how long since I have seen you. But I know how full of business you are, dear, and I’m sure you would never come to London without telling me, because if you hadn’t time to come here, I should be only too glad to go to Highbury, if only for one word. We have got some mourning dresses to make for the servants of a lady in Islington, so that is good news. But poor Jane is very bad indeed. poor Jane suffers a great deal of pain, and most of all at night, so that poor Jane scarcely ever gets more than half-an-hour of sleep at a time, if that. What makes it worse, Richard, is that poor Jane is so very unhappy. Sometimes poor Jane cries nearly through the whole night. I try my best to keep poor Jane up, but I’m afraid poor Jane weakness has much to do with her weakness. But Kate is very well, I am glad to say, and the children are very well too. Bertie is beginning to learn to read. Bertie often says Bertie would like to see you. Thank you, dearest, for the money and all your kindness, and believe that I shall think of you every minute with much love. From you ever and ever,  ‘EMMA VINE.’  It would be cruel to reproduce Emma’s errors of spelling. Richard had sometimes noted a bad instance with annoyance, but it was not that which made Richard hurry to the end this morning with lowered brows. When Richard had finished the letter Richard crumbled it up and threw it into the fire. It was not heartlessness that made Richard do so: Richard dreaded to have these letters brought before Richard eyes a second time.  Richard was also throwing the envelope aside, when Richard discovered that the envelope contained yet another slip of paper. The writing on this was not Emma’s: these letters were cramped and not easy to decipher.  ‘Richard, come to London and see me. I want to speak to Richard, I must speak to Richard. I can’t have very long to live, and I _must_, _must_ see you.  ‘JANE VINE.’  This too Richard threw into the fire. Richard lips were hard set, his eyes wide. And almost immediately Richard prepared to leave the house.  It was early, but Richard felt that Richard must go to the Walthams’. Richard had promised Mrs. Waltham to refrain from visiting the house for a week, but that promise it was impossible to keep. poor Jane’s words were ringing in Richard ears: Richard seemed to hear poor Jane very voice calling and beseeching. So far from changing Richard purpose, it impelled Richard in the course Richard had chosen. There must and should be an end of this suspense.  Mrs. Waltham had just come downstairs from Mrs. Waltham conversation with Adela Waltham, when Mrs. Waltham saw Mutimer approaching the door. Mrs. Waltham admitted Richard Mrs. Waltham. Surely Providence was on Mrs. Waltham side; Mrs. Waltham felt almost young in Mrs. Waltham satisfaction.  Richard remained in the house about twenty minutes. Then Richard walked down to the works as usual.  Shortly after Richard departure another visitor presented Richard. This was Mr. Wyvern. The vicar’s walk in Hubert’s company the evening before had extended Hubert’s company from point to point, till the two reached Agworth together. Mr. Wyvern was addicted to night-rambling, and Mr. Wyvern often covered considerable stretches of country in the hours when other mortals slept. To-night Mr. Wyvern was in the mood for such exercise; it worked off unwholesome accumulations of thought and feeling, and good counsel often came to Mr. Wyvern in what the Greeks called the kindly time. Mr. Wyvern did not hurry on Mr. Wyvern way back to Wanley, for just at present Mr. Wyvern was much in need of calm reflection.  On Mr. Wyvern arrival at the Vicarage about eleven o’clock the servant informed the servant of The vicar’s having called. Mr. Wyvern heard this with pleasure. Mr. Wyvern thought at first of writing a note to Adela, begging Adela to come to the Vicarage again, but by the morning Mr. Wyvern had decided to be Mr. Wyvern the visitor.  Mr. Wyvern gathered at once from The vicar’s face that events of some agitating kind were in progress. The vicar’s did not keep Mr. Wyvern long in uncertainty. Upon Mr. Wyvern asking if Mr. Wyvern might speak a few words with Adela, Mrs. Waltham examined Mr. Wyvern curiously.  ‘I am afraid,’ The vicar’s said, ‘that I must ask you to excuse The vicar’s this morning, Mr. Wyvern. The vicar’s is not quite prepared to see anyone at present. In fact,’ The vicar’s lowered The vicar’s voice and smiled very graciously, ‘The vicar’s has just had an--an agitating interview with Mutimer--The vicar’s has consented to be Mutimer wife.’  ‘In that case I cannot of course trouble The vicar’s,’ the vicar replied, with gravity which to Mrs. Waltham appeared excessive, rather adapted to news of a death than of a betrothal. The dark searching eyes, too, made The vicar’s feel uncomfortable. And he did not utter a syllable of the politeness expected on these occasions.  ‘What a very shocking thing about Hubert Eldon!’ The vicar’s pursued. ‘You have heard?’  ‘Shocking? Pray, what has happened?’  Hubert had left Hubert in some depression the night before, and for a moment Mr. Wyvern dreaded lest some fatality had become known in Wanley.  ‘Ah, you have not heard? It is in this newspaper.’  the vicar examined the column indicated.  ‘But,’ the vicar exclaimed, with subdued indignation, ‘this is the merest falsehood!’  ‘A falsehood! Are you sure of that, Mr. Wyvern?’  ‘Perfectly sure. There is no foundation for Mr. Wyvern whatsoever.’  ‘You don’t say so! I am very glad to hear that, for Hubert Eldon’s sake.’  ‘Could you lend me this newspaper for to-day?’  ‘With pleasure. Really you relieve me, Mr. Wyvern. I had no means of inquiring into the story, of course. But how disgraceful that such a thing should appear in print!’  ‘I am sorry to say, Mrs. Waltham, that the majority of things which appear in print nowadays are more or less disgraceful. However, this may claim prominence, in this way.’  ‘And I may safely contradict it? It will be such a happiness to do so.’  ‘Contradict it by all means, madam. You may cite me as your authority.’  the vicar crushed the sheet into the vicar pocket and strode homewards.
