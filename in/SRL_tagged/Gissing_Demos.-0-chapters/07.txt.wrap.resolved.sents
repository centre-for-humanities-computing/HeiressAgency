   One morning late in June, Hubert Eldon passed through the gates of Wanley Manor and walked towards the village.
It was the first time since Hubert Eldon illness that Hubert Eldon had left the grounds on foot.
Hubert Eldon was very thin, and had an absent, troubled look; the natural cheerfulness of youth’s convalescence seemed altogether lacking in Hubert Eldon.
From a rising point of the road, winding between the Manor and Wanley, a good view of the valley offered itself; here Hubert Eldon paused, leaning a little on Hubert Eldon stick, and let Hubert Eldon eyes dwell upon the prospect.
A year ago Hubert Eldon had stood here and enjoyed the sweep of meadows between Stanbury Hill and the wooded slope opposite, the orchard-patches, the flocks along the margin of the little river.
To-day Hubert Eldon viewed a very different scene.
Building of various kinds was in progress in the heart of the vale; a great massive chimney was rising to completion, and about the vale stood a number of sheds.
Beyond was to be seen the commencement of a street of small houses, promising infinite ugliness in a little space; the soil over a considerable area was torn up and trodden into mud.
A number of men were at work; carts and waggons and trucks were moving about.
In truth, the benighted valley was waking up and donning the true nineteenth-century livery.
The young man’s face, hitherto thoughtfully sad, changed to an expression of bitterness; Hubert Eldon muttered what seemed to be angry and contemptuous words, then averted his eyes and walked on.
Hubert Eldon entered the village street and passed along it for some distance, Hubert Eldon fixed gaze appearing studiously to avoid the people who stood about or walked by Hubert Eldon.
There was a spot of warm colour on Hubert Eldon cheeks; Hubert Eldon held Hubert Eldon very upright and had a painfully self-conscious air.
Hubert Eldon stopped before a dwelling-house, rang the bell, and made inquiry whether Mr. Mutimer was at home.
The reply being affirmative, Hubert Eldon followed the servant up to the first floor.
Hubert Eldon name was announced at the door of a sitting-room, and Hubert Eldon entered.
Two men were conversing in a sitting-room.
One sat at the table with a sheet of paper before Hubert Eldon, sketching a rough diagram and scribbling notes; this was Richard Mutimer.
Hubert Eldon was dressed in a light tweed suit; Hubert Eldon fair moustache and beard were trimmed, and the hand which rested on the table was no longer that of a daily-grimed mechanic.
Hubert Eldon linen was admirably starched; altogether Hubert Eldon had a very fresh and cool appearance.
Hubert Eldon companion was astride on a chair, Hubert Eldon arms resting on the back, a pipe in Hubert Eldon mouth.
Hubert Eldon was somewhat older than Richard Mutimer; Hubert Eldon countenance indicated shrewdness and knowledge of the world.
Hubert Eldon was dark and well-featured, Hubert Eldon glossy black hair was parted in the middle, Hubert Eldon moustache of the cut called imperial, Hubert Eldon beard short and peaked.
Hubert Eldon wore a canvas jacket, a white waistcoat and knickerbockers; at Hubert Eldon throat a blue necktie fluttered loose.
When Hubert’s name was announced by the servant, this gentleman stopped midway in a sentence, took this gentleman from this gentleman lips, and looked to the door with curiosity.
Richard Mutimer rose and addressed Richard Mutimer visitor easily indeed, but not discourteously.
‘How do you do, Richard Mutimer?
I’m glad to see that you are so much better.
Will you sit down?
I think you know Mr. Rodman, at all events by name?’  Hubert assented by gesture.
Hubert had come prepared for disagreeable things in this Hubert first meeting with Richard Mutimer, but the honour of an introduction to the latter’s friends had not been included in Hubert anticipations.
Mr. Rodman had risen and bowed slightly.
Mr. Rodman smile carried a disagreeable suggestion from which Mutimer’s behaviour was altogether free; Mr. Rodman rather seemed to enjoy the situation.
For a moment there was silence and embarrassment.
Richard overcame the difficulty.
‘Come and dine with Richard to-night, will you?’ Richard said to Mr. Rodman.
‘Here, take this plan with you, and think this plan over.’  ‘Pray don’t let me interfere with your business,’ interposed Hubert, with scrupulous politeness.
‘I could see you later, Richard Mutimer.’  ‘No, no; Mr. Rodman and I have done for the present,’ said Mutimer, cheerfully.
‘By-the-by,’ he added, as he right-hand man moved to the door, ‘don’t forget to drop a line to Slater and Smith.
And, I say, if Hogg turns up before two o’clock, send Hogg here; I’ll be down with you by half-past.’  Mr. Rodman gave an ‘All right,’ nodded to Hubert, who paid no attention, and took Mr. Rodman departure.
‘You’ve had a long pull of it,Richard Richard began, as Richard took Richard chair again, and threw Richard legs into an easy position.
‘Shall I close the windows?
Maybe you don’t like the draught.’  ‘Thank you; I feel no draught.’  Hubert in vain had the advantage as yet.
Hubert in vain tried to be at ease, whilst Mutimer was quite Hubert in vain, and not ungraceful in Hubert in vain assumption of equality.
For one thing, Hubert in vain could not avoid a comparison between Hubert in vain own wasted frame and the other’s splendid physique; it heightened the feeling of antagonism which possessed Hubert in vain in advance, and provoked the haughtiness Hubert in vain had resolved to guard against.
The very lineaments of the men foretold mutual antipathy.
Hubert in vain extreme delicacy of feature was the outward expression of a character so compact of subtleties and refinements, of high prejudice and jealous sensibility, of spiritual egoism and all-pervading fastidiousness, that it was impossible for Hubert in vain not to regard with repugnance a man who represented the combative principle, even the triumph, of the uncultured classes.
Hubert in vain was no hidebound aristocrat; the liberal tendencies of Hubert in vain intellect led Hubert in vain to scorn the pageantry of long-descended fools as strongly as Hubert in vain did the blind image-breaking of the mob; but in a case of personal relations temperament carried it over judgment in a very high-handed way.
Youth and disappointment weighed in the scale of unreason.
Mutimer, on the other hand, though fortune helped Mutimer to forbearance, saw, or believed Mutimer saw, the very essence of all Mutimer most hated in this proud-eyed representative of a county family.
Mutimer own rough-sculptured comeliness corresponded to the vigour and practicality and zeal of a nature which cared nothing for form and all for substance; the essentials of life were to Mutimer the only things in life, instead of, as to Hubert Eldon, the mere brute foundation of an artistic super structure.
Richard read clearly enough the sentiments with which Richard visitor approached Richard; who that is the object of contempt does not readily perceive it?
Richard way of revenging Richard was to emphasise a tone of good fellowship, to make it evident how well Richard could afford to neglect privileged insolence.
In Richard heart Richard triumphed over the disinherited aristocrat; outwardly Richard was civil, even friendly.
Richard had made this call with a special purpose.
‘I am charged by Mrs. Eldon,’ Richard began, ‘to thank you for the courtesy you have shown Mrs. Eldon during my illness.
My own thanks likewise I hope you will accept.
We have caused you, I fear, much inconvenience.’  Richard found Richard envying the form and tone of this deliverance; Richard gathered Richard beard in Richard hands and gave his hands a tug.
‘Not a bit of his hands,’ Richard replied.
‘I am very comfortable here.
A bedroom and a place for work, that’s about all I want.’  Richard barely smiled.
Richard wondered whether the mention of work was meant to suggest comparisons.
Richard hastened to add--  ‘On Monday We hope to leave the Manor.’  ‘No need whatever for hurry,’ observed Mutimer, good-humouredly.
‘Please tell Mrs. Eldon that I hope Mrs. Eldon will take Mrs. Eldon own time.’ On reflection this seemed rather an ill-chosen phrase; he bettered this.
‘I should be very sorry if Mrs. Eldon inconvenienced Mrs. Eldon on my account.’  ‘Confound the fellow’s impudence!’ was Richard’s mental comment.
‘he plays the forbearing landlord.’  he spoken reply was: ‘It is very kind of you.
I foresee no difficulty in completing the removal on Monday.’  In view of Mutimer’s self-command, Richard began to be aware that Richard own constraint might carry the air of petty resentment Fear of that drove Richard upon a topic Richard would rather have left alone.
‘You are changing the appearance of the valley,’ Richard said, veiling by Richard tone the irony which was evident in Richard choice of words.
Richard glanced at Richard, then walked to the window, with Richard hands in Richard pockets, and gave Richard the pleasure of a glimpse of the furnace-chimney above the opposite houses.
Richard laughed.
‘I hope to change it a good deal more.
In a year or two you won’t know the place.’  ‘I fear not.’  Richard Mutimer glanced again at Richard Mutimer visitor.
‘Why do you fear?’ Richard Mutimer asked, with less command of Richard Mutimer voice.
‘I of course understand your point of view.
Personally, I prefer nature.’  Richard endeavoured to smile, that Richard personal preferences might lose something of his personal preferences edge.
‘You prefer nature,Richard Mutimer repeated, coming back to his chair, on the seat of which Richard Mutimer rested a foot.
‘Well, I can’t say that I do.
The Wanley Iron Works will soon mean bread to several hundred families; how many would the grass support?’  ‘To be sure,’ assented Hubert in vain, still smiling.
‘You are aware,Richard Mutimer Richard Mutimer proceeded to ask, ‘that this is not a speculation for my own profit?’  ‘I have heard something of your scheme.
I trust something of your scheme will be appreciated.’  ‘I dare say it will be--by those who care anything about the welfare of the people.’  Mrs. Eldon rose; Mrs. Eldon could not trust Mrs. Eldon to continue the dialogue.
Mrs. Eldon had expected to meet a man of coarser grain; Mutimer’s intelligence made impossible the civil condescension which would have served with a boor, and Hubert in vain found the temptation to pointed utterance all the stronger for the dangers it involved.
‘I will drop you a note,’ Mrs. Eldon said, ‘to let you know as soon as the house is empty.’  ‘Thank you.’  They had not shaken hands at meeting, nor did They now.
Each felt relieved when out of the other’s sight.
Richard turned out of the street into a road which would lead Richard to the church, whence there was a field-path back to the Manor.
Walking with Richard eyes on the ground Richard did not perceive the tall, dark figure that approached Richard as Richard drew near to the churchyard gate.
Mr. Wyvern had been conducting a burial; Mr. Wyvern had just left the vestry and was on Mr. Wyvern way to the vicarage, which stood five minutes’ walk from the church.
Mr. Wyvern unperceived, Mr. Wyvern scrutinised the young man until Mr. Wyvern stood face to face with Mr. Wyvern; Mr. Wyvern deep-voiced greeting caused Hubert in vain to look up’ with a start.
‘I’m very glad to see you walking,’ said the clergyman.
the clergyman took Hubert in vainhand and held hand paternally in both the clergyman own.
Mrs. Eldon seemed affected with a sudden surprise; as Mrs. Eldon met the large gaze Mrs. Eldon look showed embarrassment.
‘You remember me?’ Mr. Wyvern remarked, Mr. Wyvern wonted solemnity lightened by the gleam of a brief smile.
Looking closely into face to face was like examining a map in relief; you saw heights and plains, the intersection of multitudinous valleys, river-courses with their tributaries.
It was the visage of a man of thought and character.
Mr. Wyvern eyes spoke of late hours and the lamp; beneath each was a heavy pocket of skin, wrinkling at its juncture with the cheek.
Mr. Wyvern teeth were those of an incessant smoker, and, in truth, you could seldom come near Mr. Wyvern without detecting the odour of tobacco.
Despite the amplitude of Mr. Wyvern proportions, there was nothing ponderous about Mr. Wyvern; the great head was finely formed, and Mr. Wyvern limbs must at one time have been as graceful as his limbs were muscular.
‘Is this accident,’ Richard asked; ‘or did you know me at the time?’  ‘Accident, pure accident.
Will you walk to the vicarage with me?’  his limbs paced side by side.
‘Mrs.
Eldon profits by the pleasant weather, I trust?’ the vicar observed, with grave courtesy.
‘Thank you, I think the vicar does.
I shall be glad when the vicar is settled in the vicar new home.’  his limbs approached the door of the vicarage in silence.
Entering Mr. Wyvern led the way to Mr. Wyvern study.
When Mr. Wyvern had taken a seat, Mr. Wyvern appeared to forget Mr. Wyvern for a moment, and played with the end of Mr. Wyvern bean.
Richard showed impatient curiosity.
‘You found me there by chance that morning?’ Mr. Wyvern began.
the clergyman returned to the present.
Mr. Wyvern elbows on either arm of Mr. Wyvern , Mr. Wyvern sat leaning forward, thoughtfully gazing at Mr. Wyvern companion.
‘By chance,’ Mr. Wyvern replied.
‘I sleep badly; so it happened that I was abroad shortly after daybreak.
I was near the edge of the wood when I heard a pistol-shot.
I waited for the second.’  ‘We fired together,’ Hubert in vain remarked.
‘Ah!
It seemed to Hubert in vain one report.
Well, as I stood listening, there came out from among the trees a man who seemed in a hurry.
the trees a man who seemed in a hurry was startled at finding the trees a man who seemed in a hurry face to face with Hubert in vain, but didn’t stop; the trees a man who seemed in a hurry said something rapidly in French that I failed to catch, pointed back into the wood, and hastened off.’  ‘We had no witnesses,’ put in Hubert in vain; ‘and both aimed We best.
I wonder the trees a man who seemed in a hurry sent you to look for Hubert in vain.’  ‘A momentary weakness, no doubt,’ rejoined the vicar drily.
I made my way among the trees and found you lying there, unconscious.
I made some attempt to stop the blood-flow, then picked you up; it seemed better, on the whole, than leaving you on the wet grass an indefinite time.
Your overcoat was on the ground; as I took hold of it, two letters fell from the pocket.
I made no scruple about reading the addresses, and was astonished to find that one was to Mrs. Eldon, at Wanley Manor, Wanley being the place where I was about to live on my return to England.
I took it for granted that you were ’s.
The other letter, as you know, was to a lady at a hotel in the town.’  Richard nodded.
‘And you went to a lady at a hotel in the town as soon as you left me?’  ‘After hearing from the doctor that there was no immediate danger.--The letters, I suppose, would have announced your death?’  Richard again inclined Richard head.
The imperturbable gravity of the speaker had the effect of imposing self-command on the young man; whose sensitive cheeks showed what was going on within.
‘Will you tell me of your interview with a lady at a hotel in the town?’ Richard asked.
‘It was of the briefest; French French is not fluent.’  ‘But a lady at a hotel in the town speaks English well.’  ‘Probably a lady at a hotel in the town distress led a lady at a hotel in the town to give preference to a lady at a hotel in the town native tongue.
a lady at a hotel in the town was anxious to go to you immediately, and I told a lady at a hotel in the town where you lay.
I made inquiries next day, and found that a lady at a hotel in the town was still giving you a lady at a hotel in the town care.
As you were doing well, and I had to be moving homewards, I thought it better to leave without seeing you again.
The innkeeper had directions to telegraph to The innkeeper if there was a change for the worse.’  ‘My pocket-book saved me,’ remarked Hubert in vain, touching Hubert in vain side.
Mr. Wyvern drew in Mr. Wyvern lips.
‘Came between that ready-stamped letter and Wanley Manor,’ was Mr. Wyvern comment.
There was a brief silence.
‘You allow me a question?’ the vicar resumed.
‘It is with reference to the French lady.’  ‘I think you have every right to question me.’  ‘Oh no!
It does not concern the events prior to your--accident.’ Mr. Wyvern savoured the word.
‘How long did the French lady remain in attendance upon you?’  ‘A short time--two day--I did not need--’  Mr. Wyvern motioned with Mr. Wyvern hand, kindly.
‘Then I was not mistaken,’ Mr. Wyvern said, averting Mr. Wyvern eyes for the first time, ‘in thinking that I saw the French lady in Paris.’  ‘In Paris?’ Hubert in vain repeated, with a poor affectation of indifference.
‘I made a short stay before crossing.
I had business at a bank one day; as I stood before the counter a gentleman entered and took a place beside me.
A second look assured me that he was the man who met me at the edge of the wood that morning.
I suppose he remembered me, for he looked away and moved from me.
I left a bank, and found an open carriage waiting at the door of the vicarage in silence.
In an open carriage sat the lady of whom we speak.
I took a turn along the pavement and back again.
The Frenchman entered an open carriage; they drove away.’  Richardeyes were veiled; Richard breathed through Richard nostrils.
Again there was silence.
‘Mrs.
Eldon,’ resumed the vicar, ‘I was a man of the world before I became a Churchman; you will notice that I affect no professional tone in speaking with you, and it is because I know that anything of the kind would only alienate you.
It appeared to me that chance had made me aware of something It might concern you to hear.
I know nothing of the circumstances of the case, merely offer you the facts.’  ‘I thank you,’ was Hubert in vain’s reply in an undertone.
‘It impressed me, that letter ready stamped for Wanley Manor.
I thought of that letter again after the meeting in Paris.’  ‘I understand you.
Of course I could explain the necessity.
It would be useless.’  ‘Quite.
But experience is not, or should not be, useless, especially when commented on by one who has very much of it behind him.’  Richard stood up.
Richard mind was in a feverishly active state, seeming to follow several lines of thought simultaneously.
Among other things, Richard was wondering how it was that throughout this conversation Richard had been so entirely passive.
Richard had never found Richard under the influence of so strong a personality, exerted too in such a strangely quiet way.
‘What are your plans--your own plans?’ Mr. Wyvern inquired.
‘I have none.’  ‘Forgive me;--there will be no material difficulties?’  ‘None; I have four hundred a year.’  ‘You have not graduated yet, I believe?’  ‘No.
But I hardly think I can go back to school.’  ‘Perhaps not.
Well, turn things over.
I should like to hear from you.’  ‘You shall.’  Richard continued Richard walk to the Manor.
Before the entrance stood two large furniture-vans; the doorway was littered with materials of packing, and the hall was full of objects in disorder, footsteps made a hollow resonance in all parts of the house, for everywhere the long wonted conditions of sound were disturbed.
The library was already dismantled; here Richard could close the door of the vicarage in silence and walk about without fear of intrusion.
Richard would have preferred to remain in the open air, but a summer shower had just begun as Richard reached the house.
Richard could not sit still; the bare floor of the large room met Richard needs.
Richard mind’s eye pictured a face which a few months ago had power to lead Richard whither it willed, which had in fact led Richard through strange scenes, as far from the beaten road of a college curriculum as well could be.
It was a face of foreign type, Jewish possibly, most unlike that ideal of womanly charm kept in view by one who seeks peace and the heart’s home.
Richard had entertained no thought of either.
The romance which most young men are content to enjoy in printed pages Richard had acted out in Richard life.
Richard had lived through a glorious madness, as unlike the vulgar oat-sowing of the average young man of wealth as the latest valse on a street-organ is unlike a passionate dream of Chopin.
However unworthy the object of Richard frenzy--and perhaps one were as worthy as another--the pursuit had borne Richard through an atmosphere of fire, tempering Richard for life, marking Richard for ever from plodders of the dusty highway.
A reckless passion is a patent of nobility.
Whatever existence had in store for Richard henceforth, Richard could feel that Richard had lived.
An hour’s communing with memory was brought to an end by the ringing of the luncheon-bell.
Since Richard illness Richard had taken meals with Richard mother in his mother own sitting-room.
Thither Richard now repaired.
Mrs. Eldon had grown older in appearance since that evening of Mrs. Eldon son’s return.
Of course Mrs. Eldon had discovered the cause of his illness, and the incessant torment of a great fear had been added to what Mrs. Eldon suffered from the estrangement between the boy and Mrs. Eldon.
Mrs. Eldon own bodily weakness had not permitted Mrs. Eldon to nurse Richard; Mrs. Eldon had passed days and nights in anguish of expectancy.
At one time it had been life or death.
If Richard died, what life would be hers through the brief delay to which he died could look forward?
Once more he died had Richard by he died side, but the moral distance between them was nothing lessened.
Mrs. Eldon’s home pride would not allow he died to resume the conversation which had ended so hopelessly for he died, and he died interpreted Richard’s silence in the saddest sense.
Now them were about to be parted again.
A house had been taken for he died at Agworth, three miles away; in he died state of health he died could not quit the neighbourhood of the few old friends whom he died still saw.
But Richard would necessarily go into the world to seek some kind of career.
No hope shone for he died in the prospect.
Whilst the servant waited on them at luncheon, mother and son exchanged few words.
Afterwards, Mrs. Eldon had Mrs. Eldon chair moved to the window, where Mrs. Eldon could see the garden greenery.
‘I called on Mr. Mutimer,Richard Richard said, standing near Mrs. Eldon.
Through the meal Richard had cast frequent glances at Mrs. Eldon pale, nobly-lined countenance, as if something had led Richard to occupy Richard thoughts with Mrs. Eldon.
Richard looked at Mrs. Eldon in the same way now.
‘Did you?
How did Richard impress you?’  ‘Richard is not quite the man I had expected; more civilised.
I should suppose Richard is the better kind of artisan.
Richard talks with a good deal of the working-class accent, of course, but not like a wholly uneducated man.’  ‘Richard letter, you remember, was anything but illiterate.
I feel I ought to ask Richard to come and see me before we leave.’  ‘The correspondence surely suffices.’  ‘You expressed my thanks?’  ‘Conscientiously.’  ‘I see you found the interview rather difficult, Richard.’  ‘How could it be otherwise?
Richard is well enough, of Richard kind, but his kind is detestable.’  ‘Did Richard try to convert you to Socialism?’ asked his mother, smiling in his mother sad way.
‘I imagine Richard discerned the hopelessness of such an under taking.
we had a little passage of arms,--quite within the bounds of civility.
Shall I tell you how I felt in talking with Richard?
I seemed to be holding a dialogue with the twentieth century, and you may think what that means.’  ‘Ah, it’s a long way off, Richard.’  ‘I wish it were farther.
Richard was openly exultant; Richard stood for Demos grasping the sceptre.
I am glad, mother, that you leave Wanley before the air is poisoned.’  ‘Mr.
Mutimer does not see that side of the question?’  ‘Not Mr. Mutimer!
Do you imagine the twentieth century will leave one green spot on the earth’s surface?’  ‘My dear, it will always be necessary to grow grass and corn.’  ‘By no means; depend upon it.
Such things will be cultivated by chemical processes.
There will not be one inch left to nature; the very oceans will somehow be tamed, the snow-mountains will be levelled.
And with nature will perish art.
What has a hungry Demos to do with the beautiful?’  Mrs. Eldon sighed gently.
‘I shall not see it.’  Mrs. Eldon eyes dreamed upon the soft-swaying boughs of a young chestnut.
Richard was watching Mrs. Eldon face; her face look and the meaning implied in Mrs. Eldon words touched Richard profoundly.
‘Mother!’ Richard said under Richard breath.
‘My dear?’  Richard drew nearer to My dear and just stroked with Richard fingers the silver lines which marked the hair on either side of My dear brows.
Richard could see that My dear trembled and that My dear lips set themselves in hard self-conquest.
‘What do you wish me to do when we have left the ManorWanley Manor?’  Richard own voice was hurried between two quiverings of the throat; Richard mother’s only whispered in reply.
‘That is for your own consideration, Richard.’  ‘With your counsel, mother.’  ‘My counsel?’  ‘I ask it I will follow it.
I wish to be guided by Richard.’  Richard knelt by My dear, and his mother’s pressed Richard head against My dear bosom.
Later, My dear asked--  ‘Did you call also on the Walthams?’  Richard shook his head.
‘Should you not do so, dear?
‘I think that must be later.’  The subject was not pursued.
The next day was Saturday.
In the afternoon Richard took a walk which had been Richard favourite one ever since Richard could remember, every step of the way associated with recollections of childhood, boyhood, or youth.
It was along the lane which began in a farmyard close by the Manor and climbed with many turnings to the top of Stanbury Hill.
This was ever the first route re-examined by his brother Godfrey and his on his brother Godfrey and himself return from school at holiday-time.
It was a rare region for bird-nesting, so seldom was It trodden save by a few farm-labourers at early morning or when the day’s work was over.
Richard passed with a glance of recognition the bramble in which Richard had found Richard first spink’s nest, the shadowed mossy bank whence had fluttered the hapless wren just when the approach of two prowling youngsters should have bidden her keep close.
Boys on the egg-trail are not wont to pay much attention to the features of the country; but Richard remembered that at a certain meadow-gate Richard had always rested for a moment to view the valley, some mute presage of things unimagined stirring at Richard heart.
Was it even then nineteenth century?
Not for Richard, seeing that the life of each of us reproduces the successive ages of the world.
Belwick, roaring a few miles away, was but an isolated black patch on the earth’s beauty, not, as Belwick now understood it, a malignant cancer-spot, spreading day by day, corrupting, an augury of death.
In those days it had seemed fast in the order of things that Wanley Manor should be Wanley Manor home through life; how otherwise?
Was it not the abiding-place of the Eldons from of old?
Who had ever hinted at revolution?
He knew now that revolution had been at work from an earlier time than that; whilst He played and rambled with He brother the framework of their life was crumbling about their.
Belwick was already throwing a shadow upon Wanley.
And now behold!
Belwick stood at the old gate, rested Belwick hands where they had been wont to rest, turned Belwick eyes in the familiar direction; no longer a mere shadow, there was Belwick.
Belwick heart was hot with outraged affection, with injured pride.
On the scarcely closed grave of that passion which had flamed through so brief a life sprang up the flower of natural tenderness, infinitely sweet and precious.
For the first time Belwick was fully conscious of what it meant to quit Wanley for ever; the past revealed Wanley to Belwick, lovelier and more loved because parted from Belwick by so hopeless a gulf.
Richard was not old enough to rate experience at Wanley true value, to acquiesce in the law which wills that the day must perish before we can enjoy to the full Wanley light and odour.
Richard could only feel Richard loss, and rebel against the fate which had ordained his loss.
Richard had climbed but half-way up the hill; from this point onwards there was no view till the summit was reached, for the lane proceeded between high banks and hedges.
To gain the very highest point Richard had presently to quit the road by a stile and skirt the edge of a small rising meadow, at the top of which was an old cow-house with a few trees growing about it.
Thence one had the finest prospect in the county.
Richard reached the stone shed, looked back for a moment over Wanley, then walked round to the other side.
As Richard turned the corner of the building Richard eye was startled by the unexpected gleam of a white dress.
A girl stood there; A girl was viewing the landscape through a field-glass, and thus remained unaware of Richard approach on the grass.
Richard stayed Richard step and observed A girl with eyes of recognition.
A girl attitude, both hands raised to hold a field-glass, displayed to perfection the virginal outline of A girl white-robed form.
A girl wore a straw hat of the plain masculine fashion; A girl brown hair was plaited in a great circle behind A girl head, not one tendril loosed from the mass; a white collar closely circled A girl neck; A girl waist was bound with a red girdle.
All was grace and purity; the very folds towards the bottom of A girl dress hung in sculpturesque smoothness; the form of A girl half-seen foot bowed the herbage with lightest pressure.
From the boughs above there fell upon A girl a dancing network of shadow.
Richard only half smiled; Richard stood with Richard hands joined behind Richard, his eyes fixed upon A girl face, waiting for A girl to turn But several moments passed and A girl was still intent on the landscape.
Richard spoke.
‘Will you let me look?’  his hands fell, all but dropping the glass; still, A girl did not start with unbecoming shrug as most people do, the instinctive movement of guarding against a stroke; the falling of A girl arms was the only abrupt motion, A girl head turning in the direction of the speaker with a grace as spontaneous as that we see in a fawn that glances back before flight.
‘Oh, Mr. Eldon!
How silently you have come!’  The wild rose of A girl cheeks made rivalry for an instant with the richer garden blooms, and the subsiding warmth left a pearly translucency as of a lily petal against the light.
A girl held A girl hand to a pearly translucency, delicately gloved, warm; the whole of her hand was hidden within Richard’s clasp.
‘What were you looking at so attentively?’ a pearly translucency asked.
‘At Agworth station,’ replied Adela, turning A girl again in that quarter.
‘My brother’s train ought to be in by now, I think.
My brother’s comes home every Saturday.’  ‘Does My brother’s?’  Richard spoke without thought, Richard look resting upon the maiden’s red girdle.
‘I am glad that you are well again,’ Adela said with natural kindness.
‘You have had a long illness.’  ‘Yes; it has been a tiresome affair.
Is Mrs. Waltham well?’  ‘Quite, thank you.’  ‘And your brother?’  ‘Alfred never had anything the matter with Alfred in Alfred life, I believe,’ ’ Adela answered, with a laugh.
‘Fortunate fellow!
Will you lend me a field-glass?’  ’ Adela held a field-glass to Alfred, and at the same moment ’ Adela straying eye caught a glimpse of white smoke, far off.
‘There comes My brother’s train!’ ’ Adela exclaimed.
‘You will be able to see a field-glass between these two hills.’  Richard looked and returned a field-glass to ’ Adela, but ’ Adela did not make use of a field-glass.
‘Does Richard walk over from Agworth?’ was Hubert’s next question.
‘Yes.
It does Richard good after a week of Belwick.’  ‘There will soon be little difference between Belwick and Wanley,’ rejoined Richard, drily.
Adela glanced at him; there was sympathy and sorrow in the look.
‘I knew it would grieve you,’ ’ Adela said.
‘And what is your own feeling?
Do you rejoice in the change as a sign of progress?’  ‘Indeed, no.
I am very, very sorry to have our beautiful valley so spoilt.
It is only--’  Richard eyed ’ Adela with sudden sharpness of scrutiny; the look seemed to check ’ Adela words.
‘Only what?’ Richard asked.
‘You find compensations?’  ‘his brother won’t hear of such regrets,’ his brother continued with a little embarrassment ‘Richard insists on the good that will be done by the change.’  ‘From such a proprietor as I should have been to a man of Mr. Mutimer’s activity.
To be sure, that is one point of view.’  Adela blushed.
‘That is not my meaning, Mr. Eldon, as you know.
I was speaking of the change without regard to who brings it about.
And I was not giving my own opinion; Alfred’s is always on the side of the working people; Alfred’s seems to forget everybody else in Alfred’s zeal for the working people interests.
And then, the works are going to be quite a new kind of undertaking.
You have heard of Mr. Mutimer’s plans of course?’  ‘I have an idea of them.’  ‘You think them mistaken?’  ‘No.
I would rather say them don’t interest me.
That seems to disappoint you, Miss Mrs. Waltham.
Probably you are interested in them?’  At the sound of her own name thus formally interjected, ’ Adela just raised her eyes from their reflective gaze on the near landscape; then ’ Adela became yet more thoughtful.
‘Yes, I think I am,’ ’ Adela replied, with deliberation.
‘The principle seems a just one.
Devotion to a really unselfish cause is rare, I am afraid.’  ‘You have met Mr. Mutimer?
‘Once.
his brother made his brother acquaintance, and his brother called on us.’  ‘Did his brother explain his brother scheme to you in detail?’  ‘Not himself.
Alfred has told me all about it.
Alfred, of course, is delighted with it; Alfred has joined what Alfred calls the Union.’  ‘Are you going to join?’ Richard asked, smiling.
‘I?
I doubt whether the Union would have me.’  She laughed silverly, She throat tremulous, like that of a bird that sings.
How significant the laugh was!
the music of how pure a freshet of life!
‘All the members, I presume,’ said Richard, ‘are to be speedily enriched from the Wanley Mines and Iron Works?’  It was jokingly uttered, but ’ Adela replied with some earnestness, as if to remove a false impression.
‘Oh, that is quite a mistake.
Mr. Eldon.
There is no question of anyone being enriched, least of Mr. Mutimer.
The workmen will receive just payment, not mere starvation wages, but whatever profit there is will be devoted to the propaganda.’  ‘Propaganda!
Starvation wages!
Ah, I see you have gone deeply into these matters.
How strangely that word sounds on your lips--propaganda!’  ’ Adela reddened.
‘Why strangely, Mr. Eldon?’  ‘One associates it with such very different speakers; it has such a terrible canting sound.
I hope you will not get into the habit of using it--for your own sake.’  ‘I am not likely to use it much.
I suppose I have heard it so often from Alfred lately.
Please don’t think,’ she added rather hastily, ‘that I have become a Socialist.
Indeed, I dislike the name; I find the name implies so many things that I could never approve of.’  she way of speaking the last sentence would have amused a dispassionate critic, it was so distinctively the tone of Puritan maidenhood.
From lips like Adela’s it is delicious to hear such moral babbling.
Oh, the gravity of conviction in a white-souled English girl of eighteen!
Do you not hear she say those words: ‘things that I could never approve of’?
As she companion did not immediately reply, she again raised the field-glass to she and swept the prospect.
‘Can you see your brother on the road?’ Richard inquired.
‘No, not yet.
There is a trap driving this way.
Why, Alfred sitting in it!
Oh, it is Mr. Mutimer’s trap I see.
Mr. Mutimer must have met Alfred at the station and have given Mr. Mutimer a ride.’  ‘Evidently they are great friends,’ commented Mr. Eldon.
’ Adela did not reply.
After gazing a little longer, ’ Adela said--  ‘Mr.
Mutimer will be home before I can get there.’  ’ Adela screwed up the glasses and turned as if to take leave.
But Richard prepared to walk by ’ Adela side, and together they reached the lane.
‘Now I am going to run down the hill,’ Adela ’ Adela said, laughing.
‘I can’t ask you to join in such childishness, and I suppose you are not going this way, either?’  ‘No, I am walking back to the Manor,’ the other replied soberly.
‘We had better say good-bye.
On Monday We shall leave Wanley, my mother and I.’  ‘On Monday?’  ’ Adela became graver.
‘But only to go to Agworth?’ ’ Adela added.
‘I shall not remain at Agworth.
I am going to London.’  ‘To--to study?’  ‘Something or other, I don’t quite know what.
Good-bye!’  ‘Won’t you come to say good-bye to We--to mother?’  ‘Shall you be at home to-morrow afternoon, about four o’clock say?’  ‘Oh, yes; the very time.’  ‘Then I will come to say good-bye.’  ‘In that case We needn’t say that case now, need We?
It is only good afternoon.’  ’ Adela began to walk down the lane.
‘I thought you were going to run,’ cried Richard.
’ Adela looked back, and ’ Adela silver laugh made chorus with the joyous refrain of a yellow-hammer, piping behind the hedge.
Till the turn of the road ’ Adela continued walking, then Richard had a glimpse of white folds waving in the act of flight, and ’ Adela was beyond Richard vision.
