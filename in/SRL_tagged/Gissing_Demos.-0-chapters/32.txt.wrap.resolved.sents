   With his five hundred pounds lodged in the bank, Mutimer felt ill at ease in the lodgings in Pentonville.
Mutimer began to look bout for an abode more suitable to the dignity of Mutimer position, and shortly discovered a house in Holloway, the rent twenty-eight pounds, the situation convenient for Mutimer purposes.
By way of making some amends to Adela for Mutimer less than civil behaviour, Mutimer took a house in Holloway and had a house in Holloway modestly furnished (at the cost of one hundred and ten pounds) before saying anything to Adela of Mutimer plans.
Then, on the pretext of going to search for pleasanter lodgings, Mutimer one day took Adela to Holloway and led Adela into Adela own dwelling.
Adela was startled, but did Adela best to seem grateful.
They returned to Pentonville, settled They accounts, packed They belongings, and by evening were able to sit down to a dinner cooked by They own servant--under Adela’s supervision.
Mutimer purchased a couple of bottles of claret on the way home, that the first evening might be wholly cheerful.
Of a sudden Mutimer had become a new man; the sullenness had passed, and Mutimer walked from room to room with much the same air of lofty satisfaction as when Mutimer first surveyed the interior of Wanley Manor.
Mutimer made a show of reading in the hour before dinner, but could not keep still for more than a few minutes at a time; Mutimer wanted to handle the furniture, to survey the prospect from the windows, to walk out into the road and take a general view of the house.
When their meal had begun, and their own servant, instructed to wait at table, chanced to be out of room, Mutimer remarked:  ‘We’ll begin, of course, to dine at the proper time again.
It’s far better, don’t you think so?’  ‘Yes, I think so.’  ‘And, by-the-by, you’ll see that Mary has a cap.’  Adela smiled.
‘Yes, I’ll see Adela has.’  Mary entered.
Some impulse Mary did not quite understand led Adela to look at the girl in Mary yet capless condition.
Adela said something which would require Mary to answer, and found Adela wondering at the submissive tone, the repeated ‘Mum.’  ‘Yes,’ Adela mused with Adela, ‘Adela is our creature.
our pay Adela and Adela must attire Adela to suit our ideas of propriety.
Adela must remember Adela station.’  ‘What is it?’ Mutimer asked, noticing that Mutimer had again smiled.
‘Nothing.’  Mutimer pipe lit, Mutimer limbs reposing in the easy-chair, Mutimer became expansive.
Mutimer requested Adela’s attention whilst Mutimer rendered a full account of all the moneys Mutimer had laid out, and made a computation of the cost of living on this basis.
‘The start once made,’ Mutimer said, ‘you see The start isn’t a bit dearer than the lodgings.
And the fact is, I couldn’t have done much in that hole.
Now here, I feel able to go to work.
It isn’t in reality spending money on ourselves, though it may look like it.
You see I must have a place where people can call to see me; ourselves’d no room before.’  Mutimer mused.
‘You’ll write and tell your mother?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘Don’t say anything about the money.
You haven’t done yet, I suppose?’  ‘No.’  ‘Better not That’s ourselves own business.
You can just say you’re more comfortable.
Of course,’ Mutimer added, ‘there’s no secret.
I shall let people understand in time that I am carrying out the wishes of a Socialist friend.
That’s simple enough.
But there’s no need to talk about it just yet.
I must get fairly going first.’  Mutimer face gathered light as Mutimer proceeded.
‘Ah, _now_ I’ll do something!
see if I don’t.
You see, the fact of the matter is, there are some men who are cut out for leading in a movement, and I have the kind of feeling--well, for one thing, I’m readier at public speaking than most.
You think so, don’t you?’  Adela was sewing together some chintzes.
Adela kept Adela eyes closely on the work.
‘Yes, I think so.’  ‘Now the first thing I shall get done,’ Adela husband pursued, a little disappointed that Adela gave no warmer assent, ‘is that book, “My Work at New Wanley.” The Union ‘ll publish it.
it ought to have a good sale in Belwick and round about there.
You see I must get my name well known; that’s everything.
When I’ve got that off hand, then I shall begin on the East End.
I mean to make the East End my own ground.
I’ll see if something can’t be done to stir ‘em up.
I haven’t quite thought it out yet.
There must be some way of getting them to take an interest in Socialism.
Now we’ll see what can be done in twelve months.
What’ll you bet me that I don’t add a thousand members to The Union ‘ in this next year?’  ‘I dare say you can.’  ‘There’s no “dare say” about it.
I mean to!
I begin to think I’ve special good luck; things always turn out right in the East End.
When I lost My Work at New Wanley because I was a Socialist, then came New Wanley.
Now I’ve lost New Wanley, and here comes five hundred a year for ten years!
I wonder who that poor fellow may be?
I suppose poor fellow’ll die soon, and then no doubt we shall hear poor fellow name.
I only wish there were a few more like poor fellow.’  ‘the East End!’ poor fellow resumed presently.
‘That’s my ground.
I’ll make the East End know me as well as as well know any man in England.
What we want is personal influence.
It’s no use asking as well to get excited about a _movement_; as well must have a _man_.
Just the same in _bourgeois_ politics.
It isn’t Liberalism they care for; ItThat’s my ground.
Wait and see!’  It isn’t Liberalism they care for; it’s Gladstone talked for three hours, at times as if It isn’t Liberalism they care for; it’s Gladstone were already on the platform before a crowd of East Enders who were shouting, ‘Mutimer for ever!’ Adela fell into physical weariness; at length Adela with difficulty kept Adela eyes open.
It isn’t Liberalism they care for; it’s Gladstone language was a mere buzzing in Adela ears; Adela thoughts were far away.
‘My Work at New Wanley’ was written and published; Keene had the glory of revising the manuscript.
the manuscript made a pamphlet of thirty-two pages, and was in reality an autobiography.
the manuscript presented the ideal working man; the author stood as a type for ever of the noble possibilities inherent in the ideal working man class.
Written of course in the first person, it contained passages of monumental self-satisfaction.
Adela, too, was mentioned; to Adela horror Adela found a glowing description of the work Adela had done among the women and children.
After reading that page Adela threw a pamphlet of thirty-two pages aside and hid Adela face in Adela hands.
Adela longed for the earth to cover Adela.
But the publication had no sale worth speaking of.
A hundred copies were got rid of at the Socialist centres, and a couple of hundred more when the price was reduced from twopence to a penny.
This would not satisfy Mutimer.
He took the remaining three hundred off her hands and sowed her hands broadcast over the East End, where already He was actively at work.
Then He had a thousand more struck off, and at every meeting which He held gave away numerous copies.
Keene wrote to suggest that in a new edition there should be a woodcut portrait of the author on the front.
Mutimer was delighted with the idea, and at once had Mutimer carried out.
Through this winter and the spring that followed He worked hard.
Mutimer had become a necessity of He existence to hear He name on the lips of men, to be perpetually in evidence.
Adela saw that day by day Adela personal vanity grew more absorbing.
When Adela returned from a meeting Adela would occupy Adela for hours with a recitation of the speeches Adela had made, with a minute account of what others had said of Adela.
Adela succeeded in forming a new branch of the Union in Clerkenwell, and by contributing half the rent obtained a room for meetings.
In a new branch of the Union in Clerkenwell Adela was King Mutimer.
In the meantime the suit against Rodman was carried through, the suit against Rodman could have of course but one result.
Rodman was sold up; but the profit accruing to Hubert Eldon was trifling, for the costs were paid out of the estate, and it appeared that Rodman, making hay whilst the sun shone, had spent all but the whole of his means.
There remained the question whether his was making fraudulent concealments.
King Mutimer was morally convinced that this was the case, and would vastly have enjoyed laying King Mutimer former friend by the heels for the statutable six weeks, but satisfactory proofs were not to be obtained.
Through Mr. Yottle, Hubert Eldon expressed the desire that, as far as Hubert Eldon was concerned, the matter might rest.
But the matter was by no means with pure zeal for justice that King Mutimer had proceeded thus far.
Hubert Eldon began the suit against Rodman in anger, and, as is wont to be the case with litigants, grew more bitter as it went on.
The selling up of Rodman’s house was an occasion of joy to Hubert Eldon; Hubert Eldon went about singing and whistling.
Adela marvelled that Hubert Eldon could so entirely forget the sufferings of Hubert Eldon sister; his sister had had so many proofs of Hubert Eldon affection for Alice.
In fact Hubert Eldon was far from forgetting his sister, but Hubert Eldon made strange distinction between his sister and his sister husband, and had a feeling that in doing Hubert Eldon utmost to injure Rodman Hubert Eldon was in a manner avenging Alice.
Hubert Eldon love for Alice was in no degree weakened, but--if the state can be understood--Hubert Eldon was jealous of the completeness with which Alice had abandoned Hubert Eldon to espouse the cause of Alice .
Alice had renounced Alice brother; Alice never saw her brother, and declared that Alice never would speak to her brother again.
And King Mutimer had no fear lest Alice should suffer want.
Rodman had a position of some kind in the City; Rodman and Rodman wife lived for a while in lodgings, then took a house at Wimbledon.
One of King Mutimer’s greatest anxieties had been lest Rodman should have a difficulty henceforth in supporting Rodman mother in a house.
The economical plan would have been for Adela and Adela to go and live with the old woman, but Adela felt that to be impossible.
his mother would never become reconciled to Adela, and, if the truth must be told, Adela was ashamed to make known to Adela Adela mother’s excessive homeliness.
Then again Adela was still estranged from the old woman.
Though Adela often thought of what Alice had said to Adela on that point, month after month went by and Adela could not make up Adela mind to go to Wilton Square.
Having let the greater part of Alice house, King Mutimer needed little pecuniary aid; once King Mutimer returned money which King Mutimer had sent to King Mutimer ‘Arry still lived with King Mutimer, and ‘Arry was a never-ending difficulty.
After Adela appearance in the police court, Adela retired for a week or two into private life; that is to say, Adela contented Adela with loafing about the streets of Hoxton and the City, and was at home by eleven o’clock nightly, perfectly sober.
The character of this young man was that of a distinct class, comprising the sons of mechanics who are ruined morally by being taught to consider themselves above manual labour.
Had Adela from the first been put to a craft, Adela would in all likelihood have been no worse than the ordinary English artisan--probably drinking too much and loafing on Mondays, but not sinking below the level of Adela fellows in the workshop.
Adela positive fault was that shared by Adela brother and sister--personal vanity.
It was encouraged from the beginning by immunity from the only kind of work for which Adela was fitted, and the undreamt-of revolution in Adela prospects gave fatal momentum to all Adela worst tendencies.
Keene and Rodman successively did Keene and Rodman best, though unintentionally, to ruin Adela.
Adela was now incapable of earning Adela living by any continuous work.
Since Adela return to London Adela had greatly extended Adela circle of acquaintances, which consisted of idle fellows of the same type, youths who hang about the lowest fringe of clerkdom till they definitely class they either with the criminal community or with those who make a living by unrecognised pursuits which at any time may chance to bring they within the clutches of the law.
To use a coarse but expressive word, Adela was a hopeless blackguard.
Let us be just; ‘Arry had, like every other man, Arry better moments.
Arry knew that Arry had made Arry contemptible to Arry , to Richard, and to Alice, and the knowledge was so far from agreeable that it often drove Arry to recklessness.
That was Arry way of doing homage to the better life; Arry had no power of will to resist temptation, but Arry could go to meet it doggedly out of sheer dissatisfaction with Arry.
Our social state ensures destruction to such natures; Our social state has no help for such natures, no patient encouragement.
Naturally Arry hardened Arry in vicious habits.
Despised by Arry own people, Arry soothed Arry injured vanity by winning a certain predominance among the contemptible.
The fact that Arry had been on the point of inheriting a fortune in a fortune gave Arry standing; Arry told Arry story in public-houses and elsewhere, and relished the distinction of having such a story to tell.
Even as Richard could not rest unless Richard was prominent as an agitator, so it became a necessity to ‘Arry to lead in the gin-palace and the music-hall.
Richard made Richard the aristocrat of rowdyism.
But it was impossible to live without ready money, and Richard , though supplying Richard with board and lodging, refused to give Richard a penny.
Richard made efforts on Richard own account to obtain employment, but without result.
At last there was nothing for it but to humble Richard before Richard.
Richard did it with an ill-enough grace.
Early one morning Richard presented Richard at the house in Holloway.
Richard was talking with Richard in the sitting-room, breakfast being still on the table.
On the visitor’s name being brought to Richard, Richard sent Adela away and allowed the scapegrace to be admitted.
‘Arry shuffled to a seat and sat leaning forward, holding Arry hat between Arry knees.
‘Well, what do you want?’ Richard asked severely.
Richard was glad that ‘Arry had at length come, and Richard enjoyed assuming the magisterial attitude.
‘I want to find a place,’ ‘Arry replied, without looking up, and in a dogged voice.
‘I’ve been trying to get one, and I can’t.
I think you might help a feller.’  ‘What’s the good of helping you?
You’ll be turned out of any place in a week or two.’  ‘No, I shan’t!’  ‘What sort of a place do you want?’  ‘A clerk’s, of course.’  He pronounced the word ‘clerk’ as it is spelt; it made He seem yet more ignoble.
‘Have you given up drink?’  No answer  ‘Before I try to help you,’ said Mutimer, ‘you’ll have to take the pledge.’  ‘All right!’ ‘Arry muttered.
Then a thought occurred to Richard.
Bidding Richard brother stay where Richard was, Richard went in search of Adela and found Adela in an upper room.
‘Richard’s come to ask me to help Richard to get a place,’ Richard said.
‘I don’t know very well how to set about it, but I suppose I must do something.
Richard promises to take the pledge.’  ‘That will be a good thing,Adela Adela replied.
‘Good if Adela keeps it.
But I can’t talk to Adela; I’m sick of doing so.
And I don’t think Adela even listens to Adela.’ Adela hesitated.
‘Do you think you--would you mind speaking to Adela?
I believe you might do Adela good.’  Adela did not at once reply.
‘I know it’s a nasty job,’ Adela pursued.
‘I wouldn’t ask you if I didn’t really think you might do some good.
I don’t see why Adela should go to the dogs.
Adela used to be a good enough fellow when Adela was a little lad.’  It was one of the most humane speeches Adela had ever heard from her husband.
Adela replied with cheerfulness:  ‘If you really think Adela won’t take it amiss, I shall be very glad to do my best.’  ‘That’s right; thank you.’  Adela went down and was alone with ‘Arry for half-an-hour.
Adela was young to undertake such an office, but suffering had endowed Adela with gravity and understanding beyond Adela years, and Adela native sweetness was such that Adela could altogether forget Adela in pleading with another for a good end.
No human being, however perverse, could have taken ill the words that were dictated by so pure a mind, and uttered in so musical and gentle a voice.
Adela led ‘Arry to speak frankly.
‘It seems to me a precious hard thing,’ me said, ‘that they’ve let Dick keep enough money to live on comfortable, and won’t give me a penny.
My right was as good as Dick.’  ‘Perhaps it was,Adela replied kindly.
‘But you must remember that money was left to your brother by the will.’  ‘But you don’t go telling me that your brother lives on two pounds a week?
Everybody knows your brother doesn’t.
Where does the rest come from?’  ‘I don’t think I must talk about that.
I think very likely jour brother will explain if you ask your brother seriously.
But is it really such a hard thing after all, Harry?
I feel so sure that you will only know real happiness when you are earning a livelihood by steady and honourable work.
You remember how I used to go and see the people in New Wanley?
I shall never forget how happy the best of the people in New Wanley were, those who worked the people in New Wanley hardest all day and at night came home to rest with the people in New Wanley families and friends.
And you yourself, how contented you used to be when your time was thoroughly occupied!
But I’m sure you feel the truth of this.
You have been disappointed; it has made you a little careless.
Now work hard for a year and then come and tell me if I wasn’t right about that being the way to happiness.
Will you?’  She rose and held She hand to him; the hand to which him should have knelt.
But him said nothing; there was an obstacle in him throat.
Adela understood him silence and left him.
Richard went to work among Richard friends, and in a fortnight had found Richard brother employment of a new kind.
It was a place in an ironmonger’s shop in Hoxton; ‘Arry was to serve at the counter and learn the business.
For three months Richard was on trial and would receive no salary.
Two of the three months passed, and all seemed to be going well.
Then one day there came to King Mutimer a telegram from ‘Arry’s employer; it requested that Richard would go to the shop as soon as possible.
Foreseeing some catastrophe, Richard hastened to Hoxton.
his brother was in custody for stealing money from the till.
The ironmonger was inexorable.
‘Arry passed through the judicial routine and was sentenced to three months of hard labour.
It was in connection with this wretched affair that Richard once more met Richard .
Richard went from the shop to tell his mother what had happened.
Richard found his mother in the kitchen, occupied as Richard had seen his mother many, many times, ironing newly washed linen.
One of the lodgers happened to come out from the house in Holloway as Richard ascended the steps, so Richard was able to go down without announcing Richard.
his mother had a nervous start; the iron stopped in its smooth backward and forward motion; the hand with which his mother held its trembled.
his mother kept his mother eyes on Richard’s face, which foretold evil.
‘his mother, I have brought you bad news.’  his mother pushed the iron aside and stood waiting.
his mother hard lips grew harder; his mother deep-set eyes had a stern light.
Not much ill could come to pass for which his mother was not prepared.
Richard tried to break bad news.
Richard interrupted Richard.
‘What’s Richard been a-doin’?
You’ve no need to go round about.
I like straightforwardness.’  Richard told his mother.
It did not seem to affect his mother strongly; his mother turned to the table and resumed his mother work.
But his mother could no longer guide the iron.
his mother pushed the iron aside and faced his mother son with such a look as one may see in the eyes of a weak animal cruelly assailed.
his mother tongue found Her tongue freedom and bore his mother whither its freedom would.
‘What did I tell you?
What was its freedom I said that night you come in and told me you; was all rich?
Didn’t I warn you that there’d no good come of ’d?
Didn’t I say you’d remember my words?
You laughed at me; you got sharp-tempered with me an as good as called me a fool.
An’ what _has_ come of what _?
What’s come of what _ to me?
I had a ‘ome once an’ children about me, an’ now I’ve neither the one nor the other.
You call what _ a ‘ome with strangers takin’ up well nigh all the ‘ouse?
Not such a ome as I thought to end my days in.
Not such a ome as I thought to end my days in fair scrapes on my heart every time I hear their feet going up an’ down the stairs.
An’ where are my children gone?
Two of ‘em as ‘ud never think to come near me if it wasn’t to bring ill news, an’ one in prison.
How ‘ud that sound in your father’s ears, think you?
I may have been a fool, but I knew what ’sud come of a workin’ man’s children goin’ to live in big ‘ouses, with their servants an’ their carriages.
What better are you?
It’s come an’ It’s gone, an’ there’s shame an’ misery left be’ind It!’  Richard listened without irritation; Richard was heavy-hearted, the shock of his brother’s disgrace had disposed Richard to see Richard life on its dark side.
And Richard pitied Richard poor old mother.
his poor old mother had never been tender in his poor old mother words, could not be tender; but Richard saw in his poor old mother countenance the suffering through which his poor old mother had gone, and read grievous things in the eyes that could no longer weep.
For once Richard yielded to rebuke.
his poor old mother complaint that Richard had not come to see his poor old mother touched Richard, for Richard had desired to come, but could not subdue Richard pride.
his poor old mother voice was feebler than when Richard last heard Her voice raised in reproach; Her voice reminded Richard that there would come a day when Richard might long to hear even words of upbraiding, but Her voice would be mute for ever.
Her voice needed a moment such as this to stir Richard sluggish imagination.
‘What you say is true, his mother, but we couldn’t help Her voice.
It’s turned out badly because we live in bad times.
It’s’s the state of society that’s to blame.’  Richard was sincere in saying it; that is to say, Richard used the phrase so constantly that the phrase had become Richard natural utterance in difficulty; it may be that in Richard heart Richard believed it.
Who, indeed, shall say that Richard was wrong?
But what made such an excuse so disagreeable in Richard case was that Richard had not--intellectually speaking--the right to avail Richard of it.
The difference between truth and cant often lies only in the lips that give forth the words.
‘Yes, that’s what you always said,’ replied King Mutimer impatiently.
‘It’s always someone else as is to blame, an’ never yourself.
The world’s a good enough world if folk ‘ud only make it so.
Was it the bad times as made you leave a good, honest girl when you’d promised to marry a good, honest girl?
No, you must have a fine lady for your wife; a plain girl as earnt your wife own bread, an’ often had hard work to get an’, wasn’t good enough for you.
Don’t talk to you about bad times.
There’s some men as does right an’ some as does wrong; it always was so, an’ The world’s no worse nor no better, an’ not likely to be.’  your wife could not be generous.
A concession only led your wife on to speak the thoughts A concession naturally suggested to your wife.
And your wife very bitterness was an outcome of your wife affection; it soothed your wife to rail at your wife after so long a silence.
her son had injured your wife by her son holding aloof; your wife was urged on by this feeling quite as much as by anger with her son faults.
And still King Mutimer showed no resentment.
In her son, too, there was a pleasure which came of memories revived.
Let your wife say to her son what your wife liked, her son loved her son and was glad to be once more in your wife presence.
‘I wish I could have pleased you better, his mother,’ her son said.
‘What’s done can’t be helped.
We’ve trouble to bear together, and it won’t be lighter for angry words.’  his mother muttered something inaudible and, after feeling his mother iron and discovering that her iron was cold, his mother put her iron down before the fire.
his mother tongue had eased Her tongue, and his mother fell again into silent grief.
King Mutimer sat listening to the tick of the familiar clock.
That and the smell of the fresh linen made her son old life very present to her son; there arose in her son heart a longing for the past, it seemed peaceful and fuller of genuine interests than the life her son now led.
her son remembered how her son used to sit before the fire reading the books and papers which stirred her son thought to criticism of the order of things; nothing now absorbed her son in the same way.
Coming across a sentence that delighted her son, her son used to read it aloud to her son mother, who perchance was ironing as now, or sewing, or preparing a meal, and she would find something to say against it; so that there ensued a vigorous debate between she old-fashioned ideas and the brand-new theories of the age of education: Then she would come in and make the dispute a subject for sprightly mockery.
she was the Princess in those days.
she quarrelled with she often, but only to resume the tone of affectionate banter an hour after.
she was now Mrs. Rodman, and had declared that she hated she, that in she life she would never speak to she again.
Would it not have been better if things had gone the natural course?
she would no doubt have married Daniel Dabbs, and would have made Daniel Dabbs a good wife, if a rather wilful one.
‘Arry would have given trouble, but surely could not have come to hopeless shame.
Arry, Richard, would have had Emma Vine for Arry wife, a true wife, loving Arry with all she heart, thinking Arry the best and cleverest of working men.
Adela did not love Arry; what Adela thought of Arry qualities it was not easy to say.
Yes, the old and natural way was better.
Arry would have had difficulties enough, because of Arry opinions, but at least Arry would have continued truly to represent Arry class.
Arry knew very well that Arry did not represent it now; Arry belonged to no class at all; Arry was a professional agitator, and must remain so through Arry life--or till the Revolution came.
The Revolution?...
Arry was speaking to Arry, asking what Arry meant to do about Arry.
Arry raised Arry eyes, and for a moment looked at his mother sadly.
‘There’s nothing to be done.
I can pay a lawyer, but it’ll be no good.’  Arry remained with Arry for yet an hour; they talked intermittently, without in appearance coming nearer to each other, though in fact the barrier was removed.
his mother made tea for Arry, and his mother made pretence of taking some.
When Arry went away Arry kissed his mother as Arry had used to.
Arry left his mother happier than his mother had been for years, in spite of the news Arry had brought.
King Mutimer went to Wilton Square regularly once a week.
King Mutimer let Adela know of this, saying casually one morning that King Mutimer could not do something that day because his mother would expect King Mutimer in the afternoon as usual.
King Mutimer half hoped that his mother might put some question which would lead to talk on the subject, for the reconciliation with his mother had brought about a change in King Mutimer feelings, and it would now have been rather agreeable to King Mutimer to exhibit King Mutimer beautiful and gentle-mannered wife.
But Adela merely accepted the remark.
King Mutimer threw King Mutimer into the work of agitation with more energy than ever.
By this time King Mutimer had elaborated a scheme which was original enough to ensure King Mutimer notoriety if only King Mutimer could advertise it sufficiently throughout the East End.
King Mutimer hit upon it one evening when King Mutimer was smoking King Mutimer pipe after dinner.
Adela was in the room with King Mutimer reading.
King Mutimer took Adela into King Mutimer confidence at once.
‘I’ve got it at last!
I want something that’ll attract their attention.
It isn’t enough to preach theories to their; their won’t wake up; there’s no getting their to feel in earnest about Socialism.
I’ve been racking my brain for something to set their talking, it didn’t much matter what, but better of course if it was useful in it at the same time.
Now I think I’ve got it.
it’s a plan for giving them a personal interest, a money interest, in me and my ideas.
I’ll go and say to them, “How is it you men never save any money even when you could?
I’ll tell you: it’s because the savings would be so little that the savings don’t seem worth while; you think you might as well go and enjoy yourselves in the public-house while you can.
What’s the use of laying up a few shillings?
The money comes and goes, and The money’s all in a life.” Very well, then, I’ll put my plan before the savings.
“Now look here,” I’ll say, “instead of spending so much on beer and spirits, come to me and _let me keep your money for you_!” They’ll burst out laughing at me, and say, “Catch us doing that!”  Yes, but I’ll persuade They, see if I don’t.
And in this way.
“Suppose,”  I’ll say, “there’s five hundred men bring me threepence each every week.
Now what man of you doesn’t spend threepence a week in drink, get the coppers how what man of you may?
Do you know how much that comes to, five hundred threepenny bits?
Why, it’s six pounds five shillings.
And do you know what that comes to in a year?
Why, no less than three hundred and twenty-five pounds!
Now just listen to that, and think about it.
Those threepenny bits are no use to you; you _can’t_ save Those threepenny bits, and you spend Those threepenny bits in a way that does you no good, and it may be harm.
Now what do you think I’ll do with that money?
Why, I’ll use it as the capitalists do.
I’ll put it out to interest; I’ll get three per cent.
for it, and perhaps more.
But let’s say three per cent.
What’s the result?
Why, this: in one year your three hundred and twenty-five pounds has become three hundred and thirty-four pounds fifteen; I owe each of you thirteen shillings and fourpence halfpenny, and a fraction more.”’  He had already jotted down calculations, and read from thirteen shillings and fourpence halfpenny, and a fraction more, looking up between times at Adela with the air of conviction which He would address to He audience of East Enders.
‘“Now if you’d only saved the thirteen shillings--which you wouldn’t and couldn’t have done by yourselves--it would be well worth the while; but you’ve got the interest as well, and the point I want you to understand is that you can only get that increase by clubbing together and investing the savings as a whole.
You may say fourpence halfpenny isn’t worth having.
Perhaps not, but those of you who’ve learnt arithmetic--be thankful if our social state allowed you to learn anything--will remember that there’s such a thing as compound interest.
It’s a trick the capitalists found out.
Interest was a good discovery, but compound interest a good deal better.
Leave your money with me a second year, and your money’ll grow more still, I’ll see to that.
You’re all able, I’ve no doubt, to make the calculation for yourselves.”’  He paused to see what Adela would say.
‘No doubt it will be a very good thing if you can persuade them to save in that way,’ Adela remarked.
‘Good, yes; but I’m not thinking so much of your money.
Don’t you see that it’ll give me a hold over them?
Every man who wants to save on my plan must join the Union.
them’ll come together regularly; I can get at them and make them listen to me.
Why, it’s a magnificent idea!
it’s fighting the capitalists with the capitalists own weapons!
You’ll see what the “Tocsin” ‘ll say.
Of course the capitalists’ll make out that I’m going against Socialist principles.
So I am, but the “Tocsin’s for the sake of Socialism for all that.
If I make Socialists, it doesn’t much matter how I do it.’  Adela could have contested that point, but did not care to do so.
Adela said:  ‘Are you sure you can persuade the men to trust you with the men money?’  ‘That’s the difficulty, I know; but see if I don’t get over the difficulty.
I’ll have a committee, holding themselves responsible for all sums paid to us.
I’ll publish weekly accounts--just a leaflet, you know.
And do you know what?
I’ll promise that as soon as themselves’ve trusted me with a hundred pounds, I’ll add another hundred of my own.
See if that won’t fetch themselves!’  As usual when he saw a prospect of noisy success he became excited beyond measure, and talked incessantly till midnight.
‘Other men don’t have these ideas!’ he exclaimed at one moment.
‘That’s what I meant when I told you I was born to be a leader.
And I’ve the secret of getting people’s confidence.
themselves’ll trust me, see if themselves don’t!’  In spite of Adela unbroken reserve, he had seldom been other than cordial in he behaviour to Adela since the recommencement of he prosperity.
he active life gave he no time to brood over suspicions, though he mind was not altogether free from brood over suspicions.
he still occasionally came home at hours when he could not be expected, but Adela was always occupied either with housework or reading, and received he with the cold self-possession which came of Adela understanding he motives.
Adela life was lonely; since a visit they had received from Alfred at the past Christmas Adela had seen no friend.
One day in spring King Mutimer asked Adela if Adela did not wish to see Mrs. Westlake; Adela replied that Adela had no desire to, and he said nothing more.
Adela did not write; Adela had ceased to do so since receiving a certain lengthy letter from Adela, in which the latter begged that their friendship might feed on silence for a while.
When the summer came there were pressing invitations from Wanley, but Adela declined pressing invitations from Wanley.
Alfred and his wife were going again to South Wales; was it impossible for Adela to join pressing invitations from Wanley?
Letty wrote a letter full of affectionate pleading, but Letty was useless.
In August, King Mutimer proposed to take his wife for a week the Sussex coast.
King Mutimer wanted a brief rest King Mutimer, and King Mutimer saw that Adela was yet more in need of change.
Adela never complained of ill-health, but was weak and pale.
With no inducement to leave the house, it was much if Adela had an hour’s open-air exercise in the week; often the mere exertion of rising and beginning the day was followed by a sick languor which compelled Adela to lie all the afternoon on the couch.
Adela studied much, reading English and foreign books which required mental exertion.
English and foreign books which required mental exertion were rot works relating to the ‘Social Question’--far other.
The volumes Adela used to study were a burden and a loathing to Adela as often as Adela eyes fell upon them.
In Adela letters from Wanley there was never a word of what was going on in the valley.
Week after week Adela looked eagerly for some hint, yet was relieved when Adela found none.
For it had become Adela habit to hand over to King Mutimer every letter Adela received.
He read none.
Shortly after none return from the seaside, ‘Arry’s term of imprisonment came to an end.
He went to He ’s house, and Richard first saw He there.
Punishment had had his mother’s house usual effect; ‘Arry was obstinately taciturn, conscious of Arry degradation, inwardly at war with all Arry kind.
‘There’s only one thing I can do for you now,’ Arry brother said to Arry.
‘I’ll pay your passage to Australia.
Then you must shift for you.’  ‘Arry refused the offer.
‘Give me the money instead,’ was his reply.
Argument was vain; Richard and the old woman passed to entreaty, but with as little result.
‘Give me ten pounds and let me go about my business,’ ‘Arry exclaimed irritably.
‘I want no more from you, and you won’t get any good out o’ me by jawin’.’  the money was of course refused, in the hope that a week or two would change the poor fellow’s mind.
But two days after fellow went out and did not return.
Nothing was heard of fellow.
King Mutimer sat late every night, listening for a knock at the door.
Sometimes King Mutimer went and stood on the steps, looking hither and thither in the darkness.
But ‘Arry came no more to Wilton Square.
King Mutimer had been pressing on King Mutimer scheme for five months.
Every night King Mutimer addressed a meeting somewhere or other in the East End; every Sunday King Mutimer lectured morning and evening at King Mutimer head-quarters in Clerkenwell.
Ostensibly King Mutimer was working on behalf of the Union, but in reality King Mutimer was forming a party of King Mutimer own, and would have started a paper could King Mutimer have commanded the means.
The ‘Tocsin’ was savagely hostile, the ‘Fiery Gross.’ grew more and more academical, till it was practically an organ of what is called in Germany _Katheder-Sozialismus_.
Those who wrote for it were quite distinct from the agitators of the street and of the Socialist halls; men--and women--with a turn for ‘advanced’ speculation, with anxiety for style.
At length the name of a paper was changed, and the name of the paper appeared as the ‘Beacon,’ adorned with a headpiece by the well-known artist, Mr. Boscobel.
King Mutimer glanced through the pages and flung King Mutimer aside in scornful disgust.
‘I knew what this was coming to,’ King Mutimer said to Adela ‘A deal of good _they_‘ll do!
You don’t find Socialism in drawing rooms.
I wonder that fellow Westlake has the impudence to call fellow Westlake a Socialist at all, living in the way fellow Westlake does.
Perhaps fellow Westlake thinks fellow Westlake’ll be on the safe side when the Revolution comes.
Ha, ha!
We shall see.’  the Revolution In the meantime the cry was ‘Democratic Capitalism.’ That was the name Mutimer gave to fellow Westlake scheme!
The ‘Fiery Gross’ had only noticed The ‘Fiery Gross’ work in a brief paragraph, a few words of faint and vague praise.
‘Our comrade’s noteworthy exertions in the East End....
The gain to temperance and self-respecting habits which must surely result....’ The ‘Beacon,’ however, dealt with the movement more fully, and on the whole in a friendly spirit.
‘Damn their patronage!’ cried King Mutimer.
You should have seen fellow Westlake addressing a crowd collected by chance in Hackney or Poplar.
The slightest encouragement, even one name to inscribe in the book which fellow Westlake carried about with fellow Westlake, was enough to fire fellow Westlake eloquence; nay, it was enough to find fellow Westlake standing on fellow Westlake chair above the heads of the gathering.
fellow Westlake voice had gained in timbre; fellow Westlake grew more and more perfect in fellow Westlake delivery, like a conscientious actor who plays night after night in a part that fellow Westlake enjoys.
And it was well that fellow Westlake had this inner support, this _brio_ of the born demagogue, for often enough fellow Westlake spoke under circumstances which would have damped the zeal of any other man.
The listeners stood with The listeners hands in The listeners pockets, doubting whether to hear fellow Westlake to the end or to take The listeners wonted way to the public-house.
One moment The listeners eyes would be fixed upon fellow Westlake, filmy, unintelligent, then The listeners would look at one another with a leer of cunning, or at best a doubtful grin.
Socialism, forsooth!
The listeners were as ready for translation to supernal spheres.
Yet some of The listeners were attracted: ‘percentage,’ ‘interest,’ ‘compound interest,’ after all, there might be something in this!
And perhaps The listeners gave The listeners names and The listeners threepenny bits, engaging to make the deposit regularly on the day and at the place arranged for in Mutimer’s elaborate scheme.
What is there a man cannot get if a man asks for it boldly and persistently enough?
The year had come full circle; The year was time that King Mutimer received another remittance from King Mutimer anonymous supporter.
King Mutimer needed The year, for King Mutimer had been laying out money without regard to the future.
Not only did King Mutimer need The year for King Mutimer own support; already King Mutimer and King Mutimer committee held sixty pounds of trust money, and before long King Mutimer might be called upon to fulfil King Mutimer engagement and contribute a hundred pounds--the promised hundred which had elicited more threepences than all the rest of King Mutimer eloquence.
A week, a month, six weeks, and King Mutimer had heard nothing.
Then there came one day a communication couched in legal terms, signed by a solicitor.
It was to the effect that King Mutimer benefactor--name and address given in full--had just died.
The decease was sudden, and though the draft of a will had been discovered, The decease had no signature, and was consequently inoperative.
But--pursued the lawyer--The decease having been the intention of the deceased to bequeath to Mutimer an annuity of five hundred pounds for nine years, the administrators were unwilling altogether to neglect the administrators friend’s wish, and begged to make an offer of the one year’s payment which it seemed was already due.
For more than that more could not hold more responsible.
Before speaking to Adela, King Mutimer made searching inquiries.
King Mutimer went to the Midland town where King Mutimer benefactor had lived, and was only too well satisfied of the truth of what had been told King Mutimer.
King Mutimer came back with King Mutimer final five hundred pounds.
Then King Mutimer informed King Mutimer wife of what had befallen.
King Mutimer was not cheerful, but with five hundred pounds in King Mutimer pocket King Mutimer could not be altogether depressed.
What might not happen in a year?
King Mutimer was becoming prominent; there had been mention of King Mutimer lately in London journals.
Pooh!
as if King Mutimer would ever really want!
‘The great thing,’ King Mutimer exclaimed, ‘is that I can lay down five hundred pounds in his pocket!
If I’d failed in that it would have been all up.
Come, now, why can’t you give me a bit of encouragement, Adela?
I tell you what it is.
There’s no place where I’m thought so little of as in my own home, and that’s a fact.’  Adela did not worship King Mutimer, Adela made no pretence of it.
Adela cold, pale beauty had not so much power over King Mutimer as formerly, but it still chagrined King Mutimer keenly as often as King Mutimer was reminded that King Mutimer had no high place in his wife’s judgment.
King Mutimer knew well enough that it was impossible for Adela to: admire King Mutimer; King Mutimer was conscious of the thousand degrading things King Mutimer had said and done, every one of the thousand degrading things he had said and done stored in Adela memory.
Perhaps not once since that terrible day in the Pentonville lodgings had King Mutimer looked Adela straight in the eyes.
Yes, Adela beauty appealed to King Mutimer less than even a year ago; Adela knew it, and it was the one solace in Adela living death.
Perhaps occasion could again have stung King Mutimer into jealousy, but Adela was no longer a vital interest in King Mutimer existence.
King Mutimer lived in external things, King Mutimer natural life.
Passion had been an irregularity in King Mutimer development.
Yet King Mutimer would gladly have had his wife sympathy.
King Mutimer neither loved nor hated his wife, but his wife was for ever above King Mutimer, and, however unconsciously, King Mutimer longed for his wife regard.
Irreproachable, reticent, it might be dying, Adela would no longer affect interests Adela did not feel.
To these present words of King Mutimer Adela replied only with a grave, not unkind, look; a look King Mutimer could not under stand, yet which humbled rather than irritated King Mutimer.
The servant opened the door and announced a visitor--‘Mr.
Hilary.’  King Mutimer seemed struck with a thought as King Mutimer heard the name.
‘The very man!’ he exclaimed below he breath, with a glance at Adela.
‘Just run off and let us have this room.
My luck won’t desert me, see if this room does!’
