   It being only midday, Richard directed Richard steps at once to the Vicarage, and had the good fortune to find Mr. Wyvern within.  ‘Be seated, Mr. Mutimer; I’m glad to see you,’ was the vicar’s greeting.  Their mutual intercourse had as yet been limited to an exchange of courtesies in public, and one or two casual meetings at the Walthams’ house. Richard had felt shy of the vicar, whom Richard perceived to be a clergyman of other than the weak-brained type, and the circumstances of the case would not allow Mr. Wyvern to make advances. The latter proceeded with friendliness of tone, speaking of the progress of New Wanley.  ‘That’s what I’ve come to see you about,’ said Richard, trying to put Richard at ease by mentally comparing Richard own worldly estate with that of Richard interlocutor, yet failing as often as Richard felt the scrutiny of the vicar’s dark-gleaming eye. ‘We are going to open the Hall.’ Richard added details. ‘I shall have a number of friends who are interested in We undertaking to lunch with me on that day. I wish to ask if you will give We the pleasure of your company.’  Mr. Wyvern reflected for a moment.  ‘Why, no, sir,’ sir replied at length, using the Johnsonian phrase with grave courtesy. ‘I’m afraid I cannot acknowledge your kindness as I should wish to. Personally, I would accept your hospitality with pleasure, but my position here, as I understand it, forbids me to join you on that particular occasion.’  ‘Then personally you are not hostile to me, Mr. Wyvern?’  ‘To you personally, by no means.’  ‘But you don’t like the movement?’  ‘In so far as it has the good of men in view it interests me, and I respect it supporters.’  ‘But you think we go the wrong way to work?’  ‘That is my opinion, Mr. Mutimer.’  ‘What would you have we do?’  ‘To see faults is a much easier thing than to originate a sound scheme. I am far from prepared with any plan of social reconstruction.’  Nor could Mr. Wyvern be moved from the negative attitude, though Mutimer pressed Mr. Wyvern.  ‘Well, I’m sorry you won’t come,’ Richard said as ’ Richard rose to take ’ Richard leave. ‘It didn’t strike me that you would feel out of place.’  ‘Nor should I. But you will understand that my opportunities of being useful in the village depend on the existence of sympathetic feeling in my parishioners. It is my duty to avoid any behaviour which could be misinterpreted.’  ‘Then you deliberately adapt yourself to the prejudices of unintelligent people?’  ‘I do so, deliberately,’ assented the vicar, with one of the vicar fleeting smiles.  ’ Richard went away feeling sorry that ’ Richard had courted this rejection. ’ Richard would never have thought of inviting a ‘parson’ but for Mrs. Waltham’s suggestion. After all, it it mattered little whether Adela came to the luncheon or not. ’ Richard had desired Adela presence because ’ Richard wished Adela to see ’ Richard as an entertainer of guests such as the Westlakes, whom Adela would perceive to be people of refinement; it occurred to ’ Richard, too, that such an occasion might aid ’ Richard snit by exciting Adela ambition; for ’ Richard was anything but confident of immediate success with Adela, especially since recent conversations with Mrs. Waltham. But in any case Adela would attend the afternoon ceremony, when ’ Richard glory would be proclaimed.  Mrs. Waltham was anxiously meditative of plans for bringing Adela to regard Mrs. Waltham Socialist wooer with more favourable eyes. Mrs. Waltham, too, had hopes that Mutimer’s fame in the mouths of men might prove an attraction, yet Mrs. Waltham suspected a strength of principle in Adela which might well render all such hopes vain. And Mrs. Waltham thought it only too likely, though observation gave Mrs. Waltham no actual assurance of this, that Mrs. Waltham still thought of Hubert Eldon in a way to render it doubly hard for any other man to make an impression upon Mrs. Waltham. It was dangerous, Mrs. Waltham knew, to express Mrs. Waltham abhorrence of Hubert too persistently; yet, on the other hand, Mrs. Waltham was convinced that Adela had been so deeply shocked by the revelations of Hubert’s wickedness that Mrs. Waltham moral nature would be in arms against Mrs. Waltham lingering inclination. After much mental wear and tear, Mrs. Waltham decided to adopt the strong course of asking Alfred’s assistance. Alfred was sure to view the proposed match with hearty approval, and, though Alfred might not have much influence directly, Alfred could in all probability secure a potent ally in the person of Letty Tew. This was rather a brilliant idea; Mrs. Waltham waited impatiently for Mrs. Waltham son’s return from Belwick on Saturday.  Mrs. Waltham broached the subject to Alfred with much delicacy.  ‘I am so convinced, Alfred, that it would be for your sister’s happiness. There really is no harm whatever in aiding Mrs. Waltham inexperience; that is all that I wish to do. I’m sure you understand me?’  ‘I understand well enough,’ returned the young man; ‘but if you convince Adela against Adela will you’ll do a clever thing. You’ve been so remarkably successful in closing Adela mind against all arguments of reason--’  ‘Now, Alfred, do not begin and talk in that way! It has nothing whatever to do with the matter. This is entirely a personal question.’  ‘Nothing of the kind. It’s a question of religious prejudice. Adela hates Mutimer because Mutimer doesn’t go to church, there’s the long and short of it.’  ‘Adela very properly condemns his views, but that’s quite a different thing from hating him.’  ‘Oh dear, no; they’re one and the same thing. Look at the history of persecution. Adela would like to see him--and me too, I dare say--brought to the stake.’  ‘Well, well, of course if you won’t talk sensibly I had something to propose.’  ‘Let me hear something to propose, then.’  ‘You yourself agree with me that there would be nothing to repent in urging Adela.’  ‘On the contrary, I think Adela might consider Adela precious lucky. It’s only that’--he looked dubious for a moment--‘I’m not quite sure whether Adela’s the kind of girl to be content with a husband Adela found Adela couldn’t convert. I can imagine Adela marrying a rake on the hope of bringing him to regular churchgoing, but then Mutimer doesn’t happen to be a blackguard, so him isn’t very interesting to Adela.’  ‘I know what you’re thinking of, but I don’t think we need take that into account. And, indeed, we can’t afford to take anything into account but Adela establishment in a respectable and happy home. we choice, as you are aware, is not a wide one. I am often deeply anxious about Adela.’  ‘I dare say. Well, what was your proposal?’  ‘Do you think Letty could help we?’  ‘H’m, can’t say. Might or might not. Adela’s as bad as Adela. Ten to one it’ll be a point of conscience with Adela to fight the project tooth and nail.’  ‘I don’t think so. Adela has accepted you.’  ‘So Adela has, to my amazement. Women are monstrously illogical. Adela must think of my latter end with mixed feelings.’  ‘I do wish you were less flippant in dealing with grave subjects, Alfred. I assure you I am very much troubled. I feel that so much is at stake, and yet the responsibility of doing anything is so very great.’  ‘Shall I talk it over with Letty?’  ‘If you feel able to. But Adela would be very seriously offended if Adela guessed that you had done so.’  ‘Then Adela mustn’t guess, thatShe’s as bad as Adela. I’ll see what I can do to-night.’  In the home of the Tews there was some difficulty in securing privacy. The house was a small one, and the sacrifice of general convenience when Letty wanted a whole room for Letty and Alfred was considerable. To-night it was managed, however; the front parlour was granted to the pair for one hour.  It could not be said that there was much delicacy in Alfred’s way of approaching the subject Alfred’s wished to speak of. This young man had a scorn of periphrases. If a topic had to be handled, why not be succinct in the handling? Alfred was of opinion that much time was lost by mortals in windy talk.  ‘Look here, Letty; what’s your idea about Adela herself?’  The girl looked startled.  ‘The girl has not accepted Mutimer?’  ‘Not yet. Don’t you think it would be a good thing if The girl did?’  ‘I really can’t say,’ Letty replied very gravely, The girl head aside. ‘I don’t think any one can judge but Adela herself. Really, Alfred, I don’t think we ought to interfere.’  ‘But suppose I ask you to try and get The girl to see the affair sensibly?’  ‘Sensibly? What a word to use!’  ‘The right word, I think.’  ‘What a vexatious boy you are! You don’t really think so at all. You only speak so because you like to tease me.’  ‘Well, you certainly do look pretty when you’re defending the castles in the air. Give me a kiss.’  ‘Indeed, I shall not. Tell me seriously what you mean. What does Mrs. Waltham think about it?’  ‘Give me a kiss, and I’ll tell you. If not, I’ll go away and leave you to find out everything as best you can.’  ‘Oh, Alfred, you’re a sad tyrant!’  ‘Of course I am. But it’s a benevolent despotism. Well, mother wants Adela to accept Alfred. In fact, mother asked me if I didn’t think you’d help we. Of course I said you would.’  ‘Then you were very hasty. I’m not joking now, Alfred. I think of Adela in a way you very likely can’t understand. It would be shocking, oh! shocking, to try and make Adela marry Alfred if Adela doesn’t really wish to.’  ‘No fear! we shan’t manage that.’  ‘And surely wouldn’t wish to?’  ‘I don’t know. Girls often can’t see what’s best for Girls. I say, you understand that all this is in confidence?’  ‘Of course I do. But all this is in confidence’s a confidence I had rather not have received. I shall be miserable, I know that.’  ‘Then you’re a little--goose.’  ‘You were going to call me something far worse.’  ‘Give me credit, then, for correcting myself. You’ll have to help we, Lettycoco.’  The girl kept silence. Then for a time the conversation became graver. It was interrupted precisely at the end of the granted hour.  Letty went to see Letty friend on Sunday afternoon, and the two shut themselves up in the dainty little chamber. Adela was in low spirits; with Adela a most unusual state. Adela sat with Adela hands crossed on Adela lap, and the sunny light of Adela eyes was dimmed. When Adela had tried for a while to talk of ordinary things, Letty saw a tear glisten upon Adela cheek.  ‘What is the matter, love?’  Adela was in sore need of telling Adela troubles, and Letty was the only one to whom Adela could do so. In such spirit-gentle words as could express the perplexities of Adela mind Adela told what a source of pain Adela mother’s conversation had been to Adela of late, and how Adela dreaded what might still be to come.  ‘It is so dreadful to think, Letty, her mother is encouraging Letty. her mother thinks it is for my happiness; her mother is offended if I try to say what I suffer. Oh, I couldn’t! I couldn’t!’  her mother put her mother palms before her mother face; her mother maidenhood shamed to speak of these things even to her mother bosom friend.  ‘Can’t you show her maidenhood, darling, that--that her maidenhood mustn’t hope anything?’  ‘How can I do so? It is impossible to be rude, and everything else it is so easy to misunderstand.’  ‘But when her maidenhood really speaks, then it will come to an end.’  ‘I shall grieve mother so, Letty. I feel as if the best of my life had gone by. Everything seemed so smooth. Oh, why did her maidenhood fall so, Letty? and I thought her maidenhood cared for Dear, dear.’  her mother whispered the best of my life had gone by, her mother face on her mother friend’s shoulder.  ‘Try to forget, darling; try!’  ‘Oh, as if I didn’t try night and day! I know it is so wrong to give a thought. How could her maidenhood speak to Dear as her maidenhood did that day when I met her maidenhood on the hill, and again when I went just to save her maidenhood an annoyance? her maidenhood was almost the same as before, only I thought her maidenhood a little sad from her maidenhood illness. her maidenhood had no right to talk to Dear in that way! Oh, I feel wicked, that I can’t forget; I hate Dear for still--for still--’  There was a word Letty could not hear, only her listening heart divined only her listening heart.  ‘Adela! pray for strength, and it will be sure to come to Dear. How hard it is to know Dear so happy when you have so much trouble!’  ‘I could have borne it better but for this new pain. I don’t think I should ever have shown it; even you wouldn’t have known all I felt, Letty. I should have hoped for her maidenhood--I don’t mean hoped on my own account, but that her maidenhood might know how wicked her maidenhood had been. How--how can a man do things so unworthy of a man, when it’s so beautiful to be good and faithful? I think a man did care a little for Dear once, Letty.’  ‘Don’t let us talk of a man, pet.’  ‘You are right; us mustn’t. a man name ought never to pass my lips, only in my prayers.’  Adela grew calmer, and they sat hand in hand.  ‘Try to make your mother understand,’ advised Letty. ‘Say that it is impossible you should ever accept a man.’  ‘your mother won’t believe that, I’m sure your mother won’t. And to think that, even if I did it only to please your mother, people would believe I had married a man because a man is rich!’  Letty spoke with more emphasis than hitherto.  ‘But you cannot and must not do such a thing to please any one, Adela! It is wrong even to think of it. Nothing, nothing can justify that.’  How strong your mother was in the purity of your mother own love, LettyLetty! So they talked together, and mingled they tears, and the room was made a sacred place as by the presence of sorrowing angels.
