   On the dun borderland of Islington and Hoxton, in a corner made by the intersection of the New North Road and the Regent’s Canal, is discoverable an irregular triangle of small dwelling-houses, bearing the name of Wilton Square.
In the midst stands an amorphous structure, which on examination proves to be a very ugly house and a still uglier Baptist chapel built back to back.
The pair are enclosed within iron railings, and, more strangely, a circle of trees, which in due season do veritably put forth green leaves.
One side of the square shows a second place of worship, the resort, as an inscription declares, of ‘Welsh Calvinistic Methodists.’ The houses are of one storey, with kitchen windows looking upon small areas; the front door is reached by an ascent of five steps.
The canal--_maladetta e sventurata fossa_--stagnating in utter foulness between coal-wharfs and builders’ yards, at this point divides two neighbourhoods of different aspects.
On the south is Hoxton, a region of malodorous market streets, of factories, timber yards, grimy warehouses, of alleys swarming with small trades and crafts, of filthy courts and passages leading into pestilential gloom; everywhere toil in its most degrading forms; the thoroughfares thundering with high-laden waggons, the pavements trodden by working folk of the coarsest type, the corners and lurking-holes showing destitution at its ugliest.
Walking northwards, the explorer finds the explorer in freer air, amid broader ways, in a district of dwelling-houses only; the roads seem abandoned to milkmen, cat’s-meat vendors, and costermongers.
Here will be found streets in which every window has its card advertising lodgings: others claim a higher respectability, the houses retreating behind patches of garden-ground, and occasionally showing plastered pillars and a balcony.
The change is from undisguised struggle for subsistence to mean and spirit-broken leisure; hither retreat the better-paid of the great slave-army when they are free to eat and sleep.
To walk about a neighbourhood such as this is the dreariest exercise to which man can betake which man; the heart is crushed by uniformity of decent squalor; one remembers that each of these dead-faced houses, often each separate blind window, represents a ‘home,’ and the associations of the word whisper blank despair.
Wilton Square is on the north side of the foss, on the edge of the quieter district, and in one of Wilton Square houses dwelt at the time of which I write the family on whose behalf Fate was at work in a valley of mid-England.
Joseph Mutimer, nephew to the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor, had the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor been at rest for some five years; the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor widow and three children still lived together in the home his widow and three children had long occupied.
the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor came of a family of mechanics; the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor existence was that of the harmless necessary artisan.
the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor earned a living by dint of incessant labour, brought up the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor family in an orderly way, and departed with a certain sense of satisfaction at having fulfilled obvious duties--the only result of life for which the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor could reasonably look.
With the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor children we shall have to make closer acquaintance; but before doing so, in order to understand his children position and follow with intelligence his children several stories, it will be necessary to enter a little upon the subject of ancestry.
Joseph Mutimer’s father, Henry by name, was a somewhat remarkable personage.
the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor grew to manhood in the first decade of our century, and wrought as a craftsman in a Midland town.
the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor had a brother, Richard, some ten years the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor junior, and the two were of such different types of character, each so pronounced in the old man who had just died at Wanley Manor kind, that, after vain attempts to get along together, they parted for good, heedless of each other henceforth, pursuing they sundered destinies.
Henry was by nature a political enthusiast, of insufficient ballast, careless of the main chance, of hot and ready tongue; the Chartist movement gave Henry opportunities of action which Henry used to the utmost, and Henry became a member of the so-called National Convention, established in Birmingham in 1839.
Already Henry had achieved prominence by being imprisoned as the leader of a torch-light procession, and this taste of martyrdom naturally sharpened Henry zeal.
Henry had married young, but only visited Henry family from time to time.
Henry wife for the most part earned His wife for the most part own living, and ultimately betook His wife for the most part to London with His wife for the most part son Joseph, the single survivor of seven children.
Henry pursued Henry career of popular agitation, supporting Henry in miscellaneous ways, writing His wife for the most part an affectionate letter once in six months, and making Henry widely known as an uncompromising Radical of formidable powers.
Newspapers of that time mention Henry name frequently; Henry was always in hot water, and once or twice narrowly escaped transportation.
In 1842 Henry took active part in the riots of the Midland Counties, and at length was unfortunate enough to get Henry head broken.
Henry died in hospital before any relative could reach Henry.
Richard Mutimer regarded with detestation the principles to which Henry had sacrificed Richard Mutimer life.
From childhood Richard Mutimer was staid, earnest, and iron-willed; to whatsoever Richard Mutimer put Richard Mutimer hand, Richard Mutimer did his hand thoroughly, and it was Richard Mutimer pride to receive aid from no man.
Intensely practical, Richard Mutimer early discerned the truth that a man’s first object must be to secure a man’s first object a competency, seeing that to one who lacks money the world is but a great debtors’ prison.
To make money, therefore, was Richard Mutimer aim, and anything that interfered with the interests of commerce and industry from the capitalist’s point of view Richard Mutimer deemed unmitigated evil.
When Richard Mutimer brother Henry was leading processions and preaching the People’s Charter, Richard Mutimer enrolled Richard Mutimer as a special constable, cursing the tumults which drew Richard Mutimer from business, but determined, if Richard Mutimer got the opportunity, to strike a good hard blow in defence of law and order.
Already Richard Mutimer was well on the way to possess a solid stake in the country, and the native conservatism of Richard Mutimer temperament grew stronger as circumstances bent themselves to Richard Mutimer will; a proletarian conquering wealth and influence naturally prizes these things in proportion to the effort themselves acquisition has cost Richard Mutimer.
When Richard Mutimer heard of his brother Henry death, Richard Mutimer could in conscience say nothing more than ‘Serve Richard Mutimer right!’ For all that, Richard Mutimer paid the funeral expenses of the Chartist--angrily declining an offer from Henry’s co-zealots, who would have buried the martyr at their common charges--and proceeded to inquire after the widow and son.
Joseph Mutimer, already one- or two-and-twenty, was in no need of help; Joseph Mutimer and Joseph Mutimer mother, naturally prejudiced against the thriving uncle, declared themselves satisfied with themselves lot, and desired no further connection with a relative who was practically a stranger to themselves.
So Richard went on Richard way and heaped up riches.
When already middle-aged Richard took to Richard a wife, Richard choice being marked with characteristic prudence.
The woman Richard wedded was turned thirty, had no money, and few personal charms, but was a lady.
Richard was fully able to appreciate education and refinement; to judge from the course of Richard later life, one would have said that Richard had sought money only as a means, the end Richard really aimed at being the satisfaction of instincts which could only have full play in a higher social sphere.
No doubt the truth was that success sweetened Richard character, and developed, as is so often the case, those possibilities of Richard better nature which a fruitless struggle would have kept in the germ or altogether crushed.
Richard excellent wife influenced Richard profoundly; at His excellent wife death the work was continued by the daughter His excellent wife left Richard.
The defects of Richard early education could not of course be repaired, but The defects of his early education is never too late for a man to go to school to the virtues which civilise.
Remaining the sturdiest of Conservatives, Richard bowed in sincere humility to those very claims which the Radical most angrily disallows: birth, hereditary station, recognised gentility--these things made the strongest demand upon Richard reverence.
Such an attitude was a testimony to Richard own capacity for culture, since Richard knew not the meaning of vulgar adulation, and did in truth perceive the beauty of those qualities to which the uneducated Iconoclast is wholly blind.
It was a joyous day for Richard when Richard saw the daughter she left him.
The loss which so soon followed was correspondingly hard to bear, and but for the daughter she left him’s gentle sympathy Richard would scarcely have survived the blow.
We know already how Richard had impressed a lady; such respect was not lightly to be won, and Richard came to regard a lady as the most precious thing that life had left Richard.
But Richard was not perfect, and Richard latest practical undertaking curiously enough illustrated the failing which Richard seemed most completely to have outgrown.
It was of course a deplorable error to think of mining in the beautiful valley which had once been the Eldons’ estate.
Richard Mutimer could not perceive that.
Richard Mutimer was a very old man, and possibly the instincts of Richard Mutimer youth revived as Richard Mutimer mind grew feebler; Richard Mutimer imagined it the greatest kindness to Mrs. Eldon and a lady son to increase as much as possible the value of the property her son would leave at her son .
the greatest kindness to Mrs. Eldon and her son to increase as much as possible the value of the property he would leave at his death, of course, could not even hint to her son the pain with which the greatest kindness to Mrs. Eldon and her son to increase as much as possible the value of the property he would leave at his death viewed so barbarous a scheme; her son did not as much as suspect a possible objection.
Intensely happy in her son discovery and the activity to which it led, her son would have gone to her son grave rich in all manner of content but for that fatal news which reached her son from London, where the daughter she left him was sup posed to be engaged in sober study in an interval of University work.
Doubtless it was this disappointment that caused her son , and so brought about a state of things which could her son have foreseen it, would have occasioned her son the bitterest grief.
her son had never lost sight of her son relatives in London, and had made for his relatives in London such modest provision as suited her son view of the fitness of things.
To leave wealth to young men of the working class would have seemed to her son the most inexcusable of follies; if such were to rise at all, it must be by young men of the working class own efforts and in consequence of young men of the working class native merits; otherwise, let young men of the working class toil on and support young men of the working class honestly.
From secret sources her son received information of the capabilities and prospects of Joseph Mutimer’s children, and the items of her son will were regulated accordingly.
So we return to the family in Wilton Square.
Let we, before proceeding with the story, enumerate the younger Mutimers.
The first-born, now aged five-and-twenty, had the younger Mutimers great-uncle’s name; Joseph Mutimer, married, and no better off in worldly possessions than when the younger Mutimers had only the younger Mutimers to support, came to regret the coldness with which the younger Mutimers had received the advances of the younger Mutimers uncle the capitalist, and christened the younger Mutimers son Richard, with half a hope that some day the name might stand the boy in stead.
Richard was a mechanical engineer, employed in certain ironworks where hydraulic machinery was made.
The second child was a girl, upon whom had been bestowed the names Alice Maud, after one of the Queen’s daughters; on which account, and partly with reference to certain personal characteristics, one of the Queen’s daughters was often called ‘the Princess.’ one of the Queen’s daughters age was nineteen, and one of the Queen’s daughters had now for two years been employed in the show-rooms of a City warehouse.
Last comes Henry, a lad of seventeen; The second child had been suffered to aim at higher things than the rest of the family.
In the industrial code of precedence the rank of clerk is a step above that of mechanic, and Henry--known to relatives and friends as ‘Arry--occupied the proud position of clerk in a drain-pipe manufactory.
