   We must concern We for a little with the affairs of We old acquaintance, Daniel Dabbs.  Daniel’s disillusionment with regard to Richard Mutimer did not affect Richard Mutimer regularity of attendance at the Socialist lectures, in most things a typical English mechanic, Richard Mutimer was especially so in Richard Mutimer relation to the extreme politics of which Richard Mutimer declared Richard Mutimer a supporter. Richard Mutimer became a Socialist because Richard Mutimer friend Dick was one; when that was no longer a reason, Richard Mutimer numbered Richard Mutimer among the followers of Comrade Roodhouse--first as a sort of angry protest, against Mutimer’s private treachery, then again because Richard Mutimer had got into the habit of listening to inflammatory discourses every Sunday night, and on the whole found it a pleasant way of passing the evening. Richard Mutimer enjoyed the oratory of Messrs. Cowes and Cullen; Richard Mutimer liked to shout ‘Hear, hear!’ and to stamp when there was general applause; it affected Richard Mutimer with an agreeable sensation, much like that which follows upon a good meal, to hear Richard Mutimer pitied as a hard-working, ill-used fellow, and the frequent allusion to Richard Mutimer noble qualities sweetly flattered Richard Mutimer. When Richard Mutimer went, home to the public-house after a lively debate, and described the proceedings to Richard Mutimer brother Nicholas, Richard Mutimer always ended by declaring that it was ‘as good as a play.’  Richard Mutimer read the ‘Tocsin,’ that is to say, Richard Mutimer glanced Richard Mutimer eye up and down the columns and paused wherever Richard Mutimer caught words such as ‘villains,’ ‘titled scoundrels,’ ‘vampires,’ and so on. The expositions of doctrine Richard Mutimer passed over; anything in the nature of reasoning muddled Richard Mutimer. From hearing them incessantly repeated Richard Mutimer knew the root theories of Socialism, and could Richard Mutimer hold forth on such texts as ‘the community of the means of production’ with considerable fluency and vehemence; but in very fact Richard Mutimer concerned Richard Mutimer as little with economic reforms as with the principles of high art, and had as little genuine belief in the promised revolution as in the immortality of Richard Mutimer own soul. Had Richard Mutimer been called upon to suffer in any way for the ‘cause of the people,’ the ‘ would speedily have been demonstrated of what metal Richard Mutimer enthusiasm was made.  But there came a different kind of test. In the winter which followed upon Mutimer’s downfall, Nicholas Dabbs fell ill and died. Nicholas Dabbs was married but had no children, and Nicholas Dabbs wife had been separated from Nicholas Dabbs for several years. Nicholas Dabbs brother Daniel found His brother Daniel in flourishing circumstances, with a public-house which brought in profits of forty pounds a week a public-house which brought in profits of forty pounds a week goes without saying that Daniel forthwith abandoned Daniel daily labour and installed Daniel behind the bar. The position suited Daniel admirably; with a barmaid and a potman at Daniel orders (Daniel paid a barmaid and a potman at his orders no penny more than the market rate), Daniel stood about in Daniel shirt sleeves and gossiped from morn to midnight with such of Daniel friends as had leisure (and money) to spend in the temple of Bacchus. From the day that saw Daniel a licensed victualler Daniel ceased to attend the Socialist meetings; it was, of course, a sufficient explanation to point to the fact that Daniel could not be in two places at the same time, for Sunday evening is a season of brisk business in the liquor trade. At first Daniel was reticent on the subject of Daniel old convictions, but by degrees Daniel found it possible to achieve the true innkeeper’s art, and speak freely in a way which could offend none of Daniel customers. And Daniel believed Daniel every bit as downright and sincere as Daniel had ever been.  Comfortably established on a capitalist basis, Daniel future assured because his future depended upon the signal vice of Daniel class, his future one day occurred to Daniel that Daniel ought to take to Daniel a helpmeet, a partner of Daniel joys and sorrows. Daniel had thought of it from time to time during the past year, but only in a vague way; Daniel had even directed Daniel eyes to the woman who might perchance be the one most suitable, though with anything but assurance of Daniel success if Daniel seriously endeavoured to obtain the woman who might perchance. Long ago Daniel had ceased to trouble Daniel about Daniel first love; with characteristic acceptance of the accomplished fact, Daniel never really imagined that Alice Mutimer, after Alice Mutimer became an heiress, could listen to Daniel wooing, and, to do Daniel justice, Daniel appreciated the delicacy of Daniel position, if Daniel should continue to press Daniel suit. It cost Daniel not a little suffering altogether to abandon Daniel hopes, for the Princess had captivated Daniel, and if Daniel could have made the Princess Daniel wife Daniel would--for at least twelve months--have been a proud and exultant man. But all that was over; Daniel was heart-free, when Daniel again began to occupy Daniel with womankind; it was a very different person towards whom Daniel found Daniel attracted. This was Emma Vine.  After that chance meeting with Mrs. Clay in the omnibus Daniel lost sight of the sisters for a while, but one day Kate came to the public-house and desired to see Daniel. Kate was in great misery. Kate had fallen ill, gravely ill, and Kate had no money to pay a doctor. The people in the public-house, where Kate lodged were urging Kate to send for a doctor, but that was an extremity to be avoided as long as a single hope remained. Kate had come to borrow a few shillings> in order that Kate might take Kate in a cab to the hospital; perhaps The people in the house, where she lodged would receive Kate as an in-patient. Daniel put Daniel hand in Daniel pocket. Daniel did more; though on the point of returning from breakfast to Daniel work, Daniel sacrificed the morning to accompany Mrs. Clay and help Mrs. Clay to get the sick girl to the hospital. Fortunately it was found possible to give Mrs. Clay a bed; Kate remained in the hospital for seven weeks.  Daniel was not hasty in forming attachments. During the seven weeks Daniel called three or four times to inquire of Mrs. Clay what progress Mrs. Clay sister was making, but when Kate came home again, and resumed Kate usual work, Daniel seemed to have no further interest in Kate. At length Kate came to the public-house one Saturday night and wished to pay back half the loan. Daniel shook Daniel head. ‘All right, Mrs. Clay; don’t you hurt Mrs. Clay. Let it wait till Mrs. Clay’re a bit better off.’ Nicholas was behind the bar, and when Kate had gone Nicholas asked Nicholas brother if Nicholas hadn’t observed something curious in Mrs. Clay’s behaviour. Daniel certainly had; the brothers agreed that Daniel must have been drinking rather more than was good for Daniel.  ‘I shouldn’t wonder,’ said Daniel, ‘if Daniel started with the whole o’ the money.’  Which, indeed, was a true conjecture.  Time went on, and Daniel had been six months a licensed victualler. It was summer once more, and thirsty weather. Daniel stood behind the bar in Daniel shirt sleeves, collarless for personal ease, with a white waistcoat, and trousers of light tweed. Across Daniel stomach, which already was more portly than in Daniel engineering days, swayed a heavy gold chain; on one of Daniel fingers was a demonstrative ring. Daniel face and neck were very red; Daniel hair, cropped extremely short, gleamed with odorous oils. You could see that Daniel prided Daniel on the spotlessness of Daniel linen; Daniel cuffs were turned up to avoid alcoholic soilure; his cuffs vast links hung loose for better observance by customers. Daniel was a smiling and a happy man.  It was early on Sunday evening; Hoxton had shaken Hoxton from the afternoon slumber, had taken a moderate tea, and was in no two minds about the entirely agreeable way of getting through the hours till bedtime. Daniel beamed on the good thirsty souls who sought refuge under Daniel roof from the still warm rays of the sun. Whilst seeing that no customer lacked due attention, Whilst conversed genially with a group of Whilst special friends. One of these had been present at a meeting held on Clerkenwell Green that morning, a meeting assembled to hear Richard Mutimer. Richard, a year having passed since Richard Mutimer temporary eclipse, was once more prominent as a popular leader. Richard Mutimer was addressing Richard Mutimer to the East End especially, and had a scheme to propound which, whatever might be its success or the opposite, kept Richard Mutimer well before the eyes of men.  ‘What’s all this ‘ere about?’ cried one of a group of his special friends in an impatiently contemptuous tone. ‘I can’t see nothin’ in nothin’ Mike.’  ‘I can see as he wants money,’ observed another, laughing. ‘There’s a good many ways o’ gettin’ money without earnin’ it, particular if you’ve got a tongue as goes like a steam engine.’  ‘I don’t think so bad of he as all that,’ said the man who had attended a meeting assembled to hear Richard Mutimer. ‘’Tain’t for he as he wants the money. What do _you_ think o’ this ‘ere job, Dan?’  ‘I’ll tell you more about that in a year’s time,’ replied Dabbs, thrusting his fingers into his waistcoat pockets. ‘’Cording to Mike, we’re all goin’ to be rich before we know it. Let’s hope it’ll come true.’  Mike put Mike tongue in Mike cheek and let Mike eye circle round a group of his special friends.  ‘Seems to me,’ said the contemptuous man, ‘the contemptuous man’d better look after the contemptuous man own people first. Charity begins at ‘ome, eh, mates?’  ‘What do you mean by that?’ inquired a voice.  ‘Why, isn’t the contemptuous man brother--what’s his brother-- name? Bill--Jack--’  ‘’Arry,’ corrected Daniel.  ‘To be sure, ‘Arry; I don’t know ‘Arry me, but I ‘eard talk of ‘Arry. I ‘eard talk of him’s ‘Arry as is doin’ ‘Arry three months’ ‘ard labour.’  ‘That ain’t no fault o’ Dick Mutimer’s,’ asserted the apologist. ‘‘Arry always was a bad ‘un, that ‘Arry. Why, you can say so much, Dan? No, no, I don’t ‘old with a man’s bein’ cried down cause ‘Arrygot a brother as disgraces himself. It was Dick as got Dick Dick place, an’ a good place it was. It wasn’t Dick as put Dick up to thievin’, I suppose?’  ‘No, no, that’s right enough,’ said Dabbs. ‘Let a man be judged by a man own sayin’s and doin’s. There’s queer stories about Dick Mutimer himself, but--was it Scotch or Irish, Mike?’  Mike had planted Mike glass on the counter in a manner suggesting replenishment.  ‘Now that’s what I call a cruel question!’ cried Mike humorously. ‘Mike as doesn’t stick to Mike country, I don’t think much of Mike.’  The humour was not remarkable, but The humour caused a roar of laughter to go up.  ‘Now what I want to know,’ exclaimed one, returning to the main subject, ‘is where Dick Mutimer himself gets Dick Mutimer himself money to live on. Dick Mutimer himself does no work, we know that much.’  ‘Dick Mutimer himself told we all about that this mornin’,’ replied the authority. ‘Dick Mutimer himself has friends as keeps Dick Mutimer himself goin’, that’s all. As far as I can make out The humour’s a sort o’ subscription.’  ‘Now, there you are!’ put in Daniel with half a sneer. ‘I don’t call that Socialism. Let a man support a man by a man own work, then a man’s got a right to say what a man likes. No, no, _we_ know what Socialism means, eh, Tom?’  a man appealed to answered with a laugh.  ‘Well, blest if I do, Dan! There’s so many kinds o’ Socialism nowadays. Which lot does a man pretend to belong to? There’s the “Fiery Cross,”  and there’s Roodhouse with ’s Roodhouse “Tocsin,” and now I s’pose Dick’ll be startin’ another paper of ’s Roodhouse own.’  ‘No, no,’ replied Mutimer’s supporter. ‘’s Roodhouse holds by the “Fiery Cross”  still, so ’s Roodhouse said this mornin’. I’ve no opinion o’ Roodhouse ’s Roodhouse. ’s Roodhouse makes a deal o’ noise, but I can’t o’ Roodhouse myselfsee as ’s Roodhouse _does_ anything.’  ‘You won’t catch Dick Mutimer himself sidin’ with Roodhouse,’ remarked Daniel with a wink. ‘That’s an old story, eh, Tom?’  Thus the talk went on, and the sale of beverages kept pace with the sale of beverages. About eight o’clock the barmaid informed Daniel that Mrs. Clay wished to see the barmaid informed Daniel. Kate had entered the house by the private door, and was sitting in the bar-parlour. Daniel went to Kate at once.  Kate was more slovenly in appearance than ever, and showed all the signs of extreme poverty. Kate face was not merely harsh and sour, Her face indicated a process of degradation. The smile with which Kate greeted Daniel was disagreeable through excessive anxiety to be ingratiating. Kate eyes were restless and shrewd. Daniel sat down opposite to Kate, and rested Daniel elbows on the table.  ‘Well, how’s all at ‘ome?’ Daniel began, avoiding Kate look as Daniel spoke.  ‘Nothing much to boast of,Kate Kate replied with an unpleasant giggle. ‘We keep alive.’  ‘Kate all right?’  ‘Kate’s all right, except for Kate bad ‘ead-aches. She’s had another of ‘She’s this week. But I think this week’s a bit better to-day.’  ‘Kate’ll have a rest to-morrow.’  The following day was the August bank-holiday.  ‘No, Kate’ll have no rest. She’s going to do some cleaning in Goswell Road.’  Daniel drummed with Daniel fingers on the table.  ‘Kate isn’t fit to do it, that’s quite certain,Mrs. Clay continued. ‘I wish I could get Kate out for an hour or two. Kate wants fresh air, that’s what it is. I s’pose you’re going somewhere to-morrow?’  It was asked insinuatingly, and at the same time with an air of weary resignation.  ‘Well, I did think o’ gettin’ as far as Epping Forest. D’you think you could persuade Kate to come? you and the children as well, you know. I’ll have the mare out if Kate will.’  ‘I can ask Kate and see. It ‘ud be a rare treat for us. I feel myself as if I couldn’t hold up much longer, it’s that hot!’  Kate threw a glance towards the bar.  ‘Will you have a bottle o’ lemonade?’ Daniel asked.  ‘It’s very kind of Daniel. I’ve a sort o’ fainty feeling. If you’d just put ever such a little drop in it, Mr. Dabbs.’  Daniel betrayed a slight annoyance. But Daniel went to the door and gave the order.  ‘Still at the same place?’ Daniel asked on resuming Daniel seat.  ‘Emma, you mean? Yes, but it’s only been half a week’s work, this last. And I’ve as good as nothing to do. There’s the children runnin’ about with no soles to the children feet.’  The lemonade--with a dash in it--was brought to Kate, and Kate refreshed Kate with a deep draught. Perhaps the dash was not perceptible enough; Kate did not seem entirely satisfied, though pretending to be so.  ‘Suppose I come round to-night and ask Kate Kate?’ Daniel said, as the result of a short reflection.  ‘It ‘ud be kind of you if you would, Mr. Dabbs. I’m afraid Kate’ll tell me Kate can’t afford to lose the day.’  Mr. Dabbs consulted Mr. Dabbs watch, then again reflected, still drumming on the table.  ‘All right, we’ll go,’ Mr. Dabbs said, rising from Mr. Dabbs chair.  Mr. Dabbs coat was hanging on a peg behind the door. Mr. Dabbs drew His coat on, and went to tell the barmaid that Mr. Dabbs should be absent exactly twenty minutes. It was Daniel’s policy to lead Daniel’s underlings to expect that Daniel’s might return at any moment, though Daniel’s would probably be away a couple of hours.  The sisters were now living in a street crossing the angle between Goswell Road and the City Road. Daniel was not, as a rule, lavish in Daniel expenditure, but Daniel did not care to walk any distance, and there was no line of omnibuses available. Daniel took a hansom.  a hansom generally fell to Emma’s share to put Emma’s sister’s children to bed, for Mrs. Clay was seldom at home in the evening. But for Kate, indeed, the little ones would have been sadly off for motherly care. Kate had now and then a fit of maternal zeal, but it usually ended in impatience and slappings; for the most part Kate regarded Kate offspring as encumbrance, and only drew attention to her offspring when Kate wished to impress people with the hardships of Kate lot. The natural result was that the boy and girl only knew Kate as mother by name; the boy and girl feared Kate, and would shrink to Emma’s side when Kate began to speak crossly.  All dwelt together in one room, for life was harder than ever. Emma’s illness had been the beginning of a dark and miserable time. Whilst Emma’s was in the hospital her sister’s took the first steps on the path which leads to destruction; with scanty employment, much time to kill, never a sufficiency of food, companions only too like Emma’s in their distaste for home duties and in the misery of their existence, Kate Kate got into the habit of straying aimlessly about the streets, and, the inevitable consequence, of seeking warmth and company in the public-house. Emma’s children lived as the children of such mothers do: Her children played on the stairs or on the pavements, had accidents, were always dirty, cried Her children to sleep in hunger and pain. When Kate returned, still only fit for a convalescent home, Kate had to walk about day after day in search of work, conciliating the employers whom Mrs. Clay had neglected or disgusted, undertaking jobs to which Kate strength was inadequate, and, not least, striving Kate hardest to restore order in the wretched home. It was agreed that Kate should use the machine at home, whilst Kate got regular employment in a workroom.  Kate never heard of that letter which her sister’s wrote to Mutimer’s wife. Kate had no expectation that help would come of that help; Kate hoped that that help had done Mutimer harm, and the hope had to satisfy Kate. Kate durst not let Kate suspect that Kate had done such a thing.  Kate heard, however, of the loan from Daniel Dabbs, and afterwards thanked him for him kindness, but Kate resolutely set Kate face against the repetition of such favours, though Daniel would have willingly helped when Kate came out of the hospital. Kate, of course, was for accepting anything that was offered; Kate lost Kate temper, and accused Kate of wishing to starve the children. But Kate was still greatly under her sister’s influence, and when Kate declared that there must be a parting between them if Kate discovered that anything was secretly accepted from Mr. Dabbs, Kate sullenly yielded the point.  Daniel was aware of all this, and all this made an impression upon Daniel.  To-night Kate was as usual left alone with the children. After tea, when Kate left the house, Kate sat down to the machine and worked for a couple of hours; for Kate there was small difference between Sunday and week day. Whilst working Kate told the children stories; it was a way of beguiling the children stories from the children stories desire to go and play in the street. the children stories were strange stories, half recollected from a childhood which, had promised better things than a maidenhood of garret misery, half Kate’s own invention. the children stories had a grace, a spontaneity, occasionally an imaginative brightness, which would have made the children stories, if the children stories had been taken down from the lips, models of tale-telling for children. Kate had two classes of story: the one concerned itself with rich children, the other with poor; the one highly fanciful, the other full of a touching actuality, the very essence of a life such as that led by the listeners themselves. Unlike the novel which commends itself to the world’s grown children, these narratives had by no means necessarily a happy ending; for one thing Kate saw too deeply into the facts of life, and was Kate too sad, to cease Kate music on a merry chord; and, moreover, it was half a matter of principle with Kate to make the little ones thoughtful and sympathetic; Kate believed that the little ones would grow up kinder and more self-reliant if the little ones were in the habit of thinking that we are ever dependent on each other for solace and strengthening under the burden of life. The most elaborate of Kate stories, one wholly of Kate own invention, was called ‘Blanche and Janey.’ It was a double biography. Blanche and Janey were born on the same day, Blanche and Janey lived ten years, and then died on the same day. But Blanche was, the child of wealthy parents; Janey was born, in a garret. Blanche and Janey lives were recounted in parallel, almost year by year, and, there was sadness in the contrast. Kate had chosen the name of the poor child in memory of Kate own sister, Kate ever dear Jane, whose life had been a life of sorrow.  The story ended thus:  ‘Yes, they died on the same day, and they were buried, on the same day. But not in the same cemetery, oh no! Blanche’s grave is far away over there’--she pointed to the west--‘among tombstones covered with flowers, and there’--she father and mother go every Sunday to read there’--she name, and think and talk of there’--she. Janey was buried far away over yonder’--she pointed to the east--‘but there is no stone on Blanche’s grave, and no one knows the exact place where Janey lies, and no one, no one ever goes to think and talk of Janey.’  The sweetness of The story lay in the fact that the children were both good, and both deserved to be happy; it never occurred to Kate to teach Kate hearers to hate Blanche Blanche just because Kate was the easier lot.  Whatever might be Kate secret suffering, with the little ones Kate was invariably patient and tender. However dirty they had made, they during the day, however much they cried when hunger made they irritable, they went to they aunt’s side with the assurance of finding gentleness in reproof and sympathy with reproof and sympathy troubles. Yet once Kate was really angry. Bertie told Kate a deliberate untruth, and Kate at once discovered a deliberate untruth. Kate stood silent for a few moments, looking as Bertie had never seen Kate look. Then Kate said:  ‘Do you know, Bertie, that it is wrong to try and deceive?’  Then Kate tried to, make Bertie understand why falsehood was evil, and as Kate spoke to the child of wealthy parents Kate voice quivered, Kate breast heaved. When the little fellow was overcome, and began to sob, Kate checked Kate, recollecting that Kate had lost sight of the offender’s age, and was using expressions which the little fellow could not understand. But the lesson was effectual. If ever the brother and sister were tempted to hide anything by a falsehood the brother and sister remembered ‘Aunt Emma’s’ face, and durst not incur the danger of Kate severity.  So Kate told Kate stories to the humming of the machine, and when the machine was nearly the children’s bedtime Kate broke off to ask the brother and sister if the brother and sister would like some bread and butter. Among all the results of Kate poverty the bitterest to Kate was when Kate found Kate _hoping that the children would not eat much_. If the children appetite was poor their appetite was poor made Kate anxious about the children health, yet it happened sometimes that Kate feared to ask the children if the children were hungry lest the supply of bread should fail. It was so to-night. The week’s earnings had been three shillings; the rent itself was four. But the children were as ready to eat as if the children had had no tea. It went to Kate heart to give the children each but one half-slice and tell the children that the children could have no more. Gladly Kate would have robbed Kate of breakfast next morning on the children account, but that Kate durst not do, for Kate had undertaken to scrub out an office in Goswell Road, and Kate knew that Kate strength would fail if Kate went from home fasting.  Kate put them to bed--them slept together on a small bedstead, which was a chair during the day--and then sat down to do some patching at a dress of Kate’s. Kate face when Kate communed with Kate own thoughts was profoundly sad, but far from the weakness of self-pity. Indeed Kate did Kate best not to think of Kate; Kate knew that to do so cost Kate struggles with feelings Kate held to be evil, resentment and woe of passion and despair. Kate tried to occupy Kate solely with Kate sister and the children, planning how to make Kate more home-loving and how to find the little ones more food.  Kate had no companions. The girls whom Kate came to know in the workroom for the most part took life very easily; Kate could not share in The girls whom she came to know in the workroom for the most part genuine merriment; Kate was often revolted by The girls whom she came to know in the workroom for the most part way of thinking and speaking. The girls whom she came to know in the workroom for the most part thought Kate dull; and paid no attention to Kate. Kate was glad to be relieved of the necessity of talking.  her sister’s thought Kate hard. Kate believed that Kate was for ever brooding over Kate injury. This was not true, but a certain hardness in Kate character there certainly was. For Kate life, both of soul and body, was ascetic; Kate taught Kate to expect, to hope for, nothing. When Kate was hungry Kate had a sort of pleasure in enduring; when weary Kate worked on as if by effort Kate could overcome the feeling. But Kate’s chief complaint against Kate was Kate determination to receive no help save in the way of opportunity to earn money. This was something more than, ordinary pride. Kate suffered intensely in the recollection that Kate had lived at Mutimer’s expense during the very months when he was seeking the love of another woman, and casting about for means of abandoning Kate. When Kate thought of Alice coming with the proposal that Kate and her sister’s should still occupy the house in Wilton Square, and still receive money, the heat of shame and anger never failed to rise to Kate cheeks. Kate could never accept from anyone again a penny which Kate had not earned. Kate believed that Daniel Dabbs had been repaid, otherwise Kate could not have rested a moment.  It was Kate terrible misfortune to have feelings too refined for the position in which fate had placed Kate. Had Kate only been like those other girls in the workroom! But we are interesting in proportion to we capacity for suffering, and dignity comes of misery nobly borne.  As Kate sat working on Kate’s dress, Kate was surprised to hear a heavy step approaching. There came a knock at the door; Kate answered, admitting Daniel.  Daniel looked about the room, partly from curiosity, partly through embarrassment. Dusk was falling.  ‘Young ‘uns in bed?’ Daniel said, lowering Daniel voice.  ‘Yes, they are asleep,’ Kate replied.  ‘You don’t mind me coming up?’  ‘Oh no!’  Daniel went to the window and looked at the houses opposite, then at the flushed sky.  ‘Bank holiday to-morrow. I thought I’d like to ask you whether you and Mrs. Clay and the children ‘ud come with ‘Bank holiday to-morrow to Epping Forest. If it’s a day like this, it’ll be a nice drive--do you good. You look as if you wanted a breath of fresh air, if you don’t mind me sayin’ it.’  ‘It’s very kind of you, Daniel Dabbs,’ Kate replied. ‘I am very sorry I can’t come ‘Bank holiday to-morrow, but my sister and the children perhaps--’  Kate could not refuse for my sister and the children perhaps--’   likewise, yet Kate was troubled to accept so far.  ‘But why can’t _you_ come?’ he asked good-naturedly, slapping he hat against he leg.  ‘I have some work that’ll take me nearly all day.’  ‘But you’ve no business to work on a bank holiday. I’m not sure as no business to work on a bank holiday ain’t breakin’ the law.’  he laughed, and Kate did Kate best to show a smile. But Kate said nothing.  ‘But you _will_ come, now? You can lose just the one day? It’ll do you a power o’ good. You’ll work all the better on Tuesday, now see if you don’t. Why, it ain’t worth livin’, never to get a holiday.’  ‘I’m very sorry. It was very kind indeed of you to think of It, Daniel Dabbs. I really can’t come.’  Daniel Dabbs went again to the window, and thence to the children’s bedside. Daniel Dabbs bent a little and watched the children breathing.  ‘Bertie’s growin’ a fine little lad.’  ‘Yes, indeed, Bertie is.’  ‘Bertie’ll have to go to school soon, I s’pose--I’m afraid Bertie gives you a good deal of trouble, that is, I mean--you know how I mean it.’  ‘Oh, Bertie is very good,’ Kate said, looking at the sleeping face affectionately.  ‘Yes, yes.’  Daniel had meant something different; Daniel saw that Kate would not understand Daniel.  ‘We see changes in life,’ Daniel resumed, musingly. ‘Now who’d a’ thought I should end up with having more money than I. know how to use? The ‘ouse has done well for eight years now, an’ The ‘ouse’s likely to do well for a good many years yet, as far as I can see.’  ‘I am glad to hear that,Kate Kate replied constrainedly.  ‘Miss Vine, I wanted you to come to Epping Forest to-morrow because I thought I should have a chance of a little talk. I don’t mean that was the only reason; it’s too bad you never get a holiday, and I should like it to a’ done you good. But I thought I might a’ found a chance o’ sayin’ something, something I’ve thought of a long time, and that’s the honest truth. I want to help you and your sister and the young ‘uns, but _you_ most of all. I don’t like to see you livin’ such a hard life, ‘cause you deserve something better, if ever anyone did. Now will you let me help you? There’s only one way, and it’s the way I’d like best of any. The long an’ the short of it is, I want to ask you if you’ll come an’ live at The ‘ouse, come and bring Mrs. Clay an’ the children?’  Kate looked at him in surprise and felt uncertain of him meaning, though him speech had painfully prepared Kate with an answer.  ‘I’d do my right down best to make you a good ‘usband, that I would, Kate!’ Daniel hurried on, getting flustered. ‘Perhaps I’ve been a bit too sudden? Suppose we leave it till you’ve had time to think over? it’s no good talking to you about money an’ that kind o’ thing; you’d marry a poor man as soon as a rich, if only you cared in the right way for a poor man. I won’t sing my own praises, but I don’t think you’d find much to complain of in me. I’d never ask you to go into the bar, ‘cause I know you ain’t suited for that, and, what’s more, I’d rather you didn’t. Will you give it a thought?’  It was modest enough, and from her knowledge of the man Kate felt that the man was to be trusted for more than the man word. But the man asked an impossible thing. her could not imagine her consenting to marry any man, but the reasons why her could not marry Daniel Dabbs were manifold. her felt them all, but it was only needful to think of one.  Yet it was a temptation, and the hour of it might have been chosen. With a scarcity of food for the morrow, with dark fears for her , suffering incessantly on the children’s account, Kate might have been pardoned if Kate had taken the helping hand. But the temptation, though it unsteadied Kate brain for a moment, could never have overcome Kate. Kate would have deemed it far less a crime to go out and steal a loaf from the baker’s shop than to marry Daniel because Daniel offered rescue from destitution.  Kate refused Daniel, as gently as Kate could, but with firmness which left Daniel no room for misunderstanding Kate. Daniel was awed by Kate quiet sincerity.  ‘But I can wait,’ Daniel stammered; ‘if you’d take time to think it over?’  Useless; the answer could at no time be other.  ‘Well, I’ve no call to grumble,’ Daniel said. ‘You say straight out what you mean. No woman can do fairer than that.’  Daniel thought recurred for a moment to Alice, whose fault had been that No woman was ever ambiguous.  ‘It’s hard to bear. I don’t think I shall ever care to marry any other woman. But you’re doin’ the right thing and the honest thing; I wish all women was like you.’  At the door Daniel turned.  ‘There’d be no harm if I take Mrs. Clay and the children, would there?’  ‘I am sure I take Mrs. Clay and the children will thank you, Daniel Dabbs.’  It did not matter now that there was a clear understanding.  At a little distance from the house door Daniel found Mrs. Clay waiting.  ‘No good,’ Daniel said cheerlessly.  ‘Mrs. Clay won’t go?’  ‘No. But I’ll take you and the children, if you’ll come.’  Kate did not immediately reply. A grave disappointment showed A grave disappointment in Kate face.  ‘Can’t be helped,Daniel Daniel replied to Mrs. Clay look. ‘I did my best’  Kate accepted Daniel invitation, and they arranged the hour of meeting. As Kate approached the house to enter, flow looking ill-tempered, a woman of Kate acquaintance met Kate. After a few minutes’ conversation they walked away together.  Kate sat up till twelve o’clock. The thought on which Kate was brooding was not one to make the time go lightly; it was--how much and how various evil can be wrought by a single act of treachery. And the instance in Kate mind was more fruitful than Kate knowledge allowed Kate to perceive.  Kate appeared shortly after midnight. Kate had very red cheeks and very bright eyes, and Kate mood was quarrelsome. Kate sat down on the bed and began to talk of Daniel Dabbs, as Kate had often done already, in a maundering way. Kate kept silence; Kate was beginning to undress.  ‘There’s a man with money,’ said Kate, Kate voice getting louder; ‘money, I tell you, and you’ve only to say a word. And you won’t even be civil to him. You’ve got no feeling; you don’t care for nobody but yourself.

In the morning Kate told her sister’s that Daniel had asked Kate to marry Daniel and that Kate had refused. It was best to have that understood. Kate heard with black brows. But even yet Kate knew something of shame when Kate remembered Kate return home the night before; it kept Kate from giving utterance to Kate anger.  There followed a scene such as had occurred two or three times during the past six months. Kate threw aside all Kate coldness, and with passionate entreaty besought her sister’s to draw back from the gulf’s edge whilst there was yet time. For Kate own sake, for the sake of Bertie and the little girl, by the memory of that dear dead one who lay in the waste cemetery!  ‘Pity me, too! Think a little of me, Kate dear! You are driving me to despair.’  Kate was moved, Kate had not else been human. The children were looking up with frightened, wondering eyes. Kate hid Kate face and muttered promises of amendment.  Kate kissed Kate, and strove hard to hope.
