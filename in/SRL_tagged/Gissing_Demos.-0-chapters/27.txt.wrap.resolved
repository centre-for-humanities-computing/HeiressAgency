   The making a virtue of necessity, though it argues lack of ingenuousness, is perhaps preferable to the wholly honest demonstration of snarling over one’s misfortunes. It may result in good even to the hypocrite, who occasionally surprises himself with the pleasure himself finds in wearing a front of nobility, and is thereby induced to consider the advantages of upright behaviour adopted for its own sake. Something of this kind happened in the case of Richard Mutimer. Seeing that there was no choice but to surrender Richard Mutimer fortune, Richard Mutimer set to work to make the most of abdication, and with the result that the three weeks occupied in settling Richard Mutimer affairs at New Wanley and withdrawing from the Manor were full of cheerful activity. Richard Mutimer did not meet Hubert Eldon, all business being transacted through Mr. Yottle. When Richard Mutimer heard from the latter that it was Hubert Eldon’s intention to make a clean sweep of mines, works, and settlements, though for a moment chagrined, Richard Mutimer speedily saw that such action, by giving dramatic completeness to Richard Mutimer career at New Wanley and investing his career at Wanley close with something of tragic pathos, was in truth what Richard Mutimer should most have desired. his career at Wanley enabled Richard Mutimer to take Richard Mutimer departure with an air of profounder sadness; henceforth no gross facts would stand in the way of Richard Mutimer rhetoric when Richard Mutimer should enlarge on the possibilities thus nipped in the bud. Richard Mutimer was more than ever a victim of cruel circumstances; Richard Mutimer could speak with noble bitterness of Richard Mutimer life’s work having been swept into oblivion.  Richard Mutimer was supported by a considerable amount of epistolary sympathy. The local papers made an interesting story of what had happened in the old church at New Wanley, and a few of the London journals reported the circumstances; in this way Mutimer became known to a wider public than had hitherto observed Richard Mutimer. Not only did Richard Mutimer fellow-Unionists write to encourage and moralise, but a number of those people who are ever ready to indite letters to people of any prominence, the honestly admiring and the windily egoistic, addressed communications either to Wanley Manor or to the editor of the ‘Fiery Cross.’ Mutimer read eagerly every word of each most insignificant scribbler; Mutimer eyes gleamed and Mutimer cheeks grew warm. All such letters Mutimer brought to Adela, and made Adela read them aloud; Mutimer stood with Mutimer hands behind Mutimer back, Mutimer face slightly elevated and at a listening angle. At the end Mutimer regarded Adela, and Mutimer look said: ‘Behold the man who is your husband!’  But at length there came one letter distinct from all the rest; one letter distinct from all the rest had the seal of a Government office. With eyes which scarcely credited what they saw Mutimer read some twenty or thirty words from a Minister of the Crown, a gentleman of vigorously Radical opinions, who had ‘heard with much regret that the undertaking conceived and pursued with such single-hearted zeal’ had come to an untimely end. Mutimer rushed to Adela like a schoolboy who has a holiday to announce.  ‘Read that now! What do you think of that? Now there’s some hope of a statesman like that!’  Adela gave forth one letter distinct from all the rest in a voice which was all too steady. 7 But Adela said:  ‘I am very glad. It must gratify you. He writes very kindly.’  ‘You’ll have to help me to make an answer.’  Adela smiled, but said nothing.  The ceremonious opening of the hall at New Wanley had been a great day; Mutimer tried Mutimer best to make the closing yet more effective. Mr. Westlake was persuaded to take the chair, but this time the oration was by the founder himself. There was a numerous assembly. Mutimer spoke for an hour and a quarter, reviewing what Mutimer had done, and enlarging on all that Mutimer might and would have done. There was as much applause as even Mutimer could desire. The proceedings closed with the reading of an address which was signed by all the people of the works, a eulogium and an expression of gratitude, not without one or two sentences of fiery Socialism. The spokesman was a fine fellow of six feet two, a man named Redgrave, the ideal of a revolutionist workman. a fine fellow of six feet two, a man named Redgrave, the ideal of a revolutionist workman was one of the few men at the works whom Adela, from observation of their domestic life, had learnt sincerely to respect. Before reading the document a fine fellow of six feet two, a man named Redgrave, the ideal of a revolutionist workman made a little speech of a fine fellow of six feet two, a man named Redgrave, the ideal of a revolutionist workman own, and said in conclusion:  ‘Here’s an example of how the law does justice in a capitalist society. The man who makes a grand use of money has it all taken away from The man who makes a grand use of money by the man who makes no use of it at all, except to satisfy The man who makes a grand use of money own malice and The man who makes a grand use of money own selfishness. If we don’t one and all swear to do we utmost to change such a state of things as that, all I can say is we’re a poor lot, and deserve to be worse treated than the animals, that haven’t the sense to use the animals strength!’  In his reply to the address Richard surpassed Richard. Richard rose in excitement; the words that rushed to Richard lips could scarcely find articulate flow. After the due thanks:  ‘To-morrow I go to London; I go as poor as the poorest of you, a mechanical engineer in search of work. Whether I shall find it or not there’s no saying. If they turned me out because of my opinions three years ago, it’s not very likely that they’ve grown fonder of me by this time. As poor as the poorest of you, I say. Most of you probably know that a small legacy is left to me under the will which gives this property into other hands. a small legacy is left to me under the will which gives this property into other hands will be used, every penny of a small legacy is left to me under the will which gives this property into other hands, for the furtherance of our cause!’  It was a magnificent thought, one of those inspirations which reveal latent genius. The hall echoed with shouts of glorification. Adela, who sat with her mother and Letty (Mrs. Westlake had not accompanied Mrs. Westlake husband), kept Mrs. Westlake eyes fixed on the ground; the uproar made Mrs. Westlake head throb.  All seemed to be over and dispersal was beginning, when a gentleman stood up in the middle of The hall and made signs that a gentleman wished to be heard for a moment. Mutimer aided a gentleman in gaining attention. It was Mr. Yottle, a grizzle-headed, ruddy-cheeked veteran of the law.  ‘I merely desire to use this opportunity of reminding those who have been employed at the works that Mr. Eldon will be glad to meet those who have been employed at the works in The hall at half-past ten o’clock to-morrow morning. It will perhaps be better if the men alone attend, as the meeting will be strictly for business purposes.’  Adela was among the last to leave the room. As Adela was moving between the rows of benches Mr. Westlake approached Adela. Mr. Westlake had only arrived in time to take Mr. Westlake place on the platform, and Mr. Westlake was on the point of returning to London.  I have a note for you from Stella, Mr. Westlake said. ‘Adela has been ailing for a fortnight; it wasn’t safe for Adela to come. But Adela will soon see you, I hope.’  ‘I hope so,Adela Adela replied mechanically, as Adela took the letter.  Mr. Westlake only added Mr. Westlake ‘good-bye,’ and went to take leave of Mutimer, who was standing at a little distance.  Among those who remained to talk with the hero of the day was Keene. Keene had risen in the world, being at present sub-editor of a Belwick journal. Keene appearance had considerably improved, and Keene manner was more ornate than ever. Keene took Mutimer by the arm and led Keene aside.  ‘A suggestion--something that occurred to me whilst you were speaking. You must write the history of New Wanley Not too long; a thing that could be printed in pamphlet form and sold at a penny or twopence. Speak to Mr. Westlake see if the Union won’t publish. Some simple title: “My Work in New Wanley,” for instance. I’ll see that it’s well noticed in our rag.’  ‘Not a bad idea!’ Mutimer exclaimed, throwing back Mutimer head.  ‘Trust me, not half bad. Be of use in the propaganda. Just think it over, and, if you care to, allow me to read it in manuscript. There’s a kind of art--eh? you know what I mean; it’s only to be got by journalistic practice. Yes, “My Work in New Wanley”; I think that would do.’  ‘I’m going to lecture at Commonwealth Hall next Sunday,Mutimer observed. ‘I’ll take that for my title.’  ‘By-the-bye how--what was I going to say? Oh yes, how is Mrs. Rodman?’  ‘Tolerable, I believe.’  ‘In London, presumably?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘Not much--not taking it to heart much, I hope?’  ‘Not particularly? I think.’  ‘I should be glad to be remembered--a word when you see Mrs. Rodman. Thanks, Mutimer, thanks. I must be off.’  Adela was making haste to Teach the Manor, that Adela might read Stella’s letter Adela and Adela were to dine this evening with the Walthams--a farewell meal. With difficulty Adela escaped from Adela mother and Letty; Stella letter demanded a quarter of an hour of solitude.  Adela reached Adela room, and broke the envelope. Stella never wrote at much length, but to-day there were only a few lines.  ‘My love to you, heart’s darling. I am not well enough to come, and I think it likely you had rather I did not. But in a few hours you will be near Stella. Come as soon as ever you can. I wait for you like the earth for spring. ‘Stella.’  Stella kissed the paper and put the paper in the bosom of Stella dress. It was already time to go to Stella mother’s.  Stella found Stella mother and Letty with grave faces; something seemed to have disturbed her mother and Letty. Letty tried to smile and appear at ease, but Mrs. Waltham was at no pains to hide the source of Mrs. Waltham dissatisfaction.  ‘Did you know of that, Adela?’ Adela asked, with vexation. ‘About the annuity, I mean. Had Richard spoken to Richard of Richard intention?’  Adela replied with a simple negative. Adela had not given the matter a thought.  ‘Then Richard certainly should have done. It was Richard duty, I consider, to tell _me_. It is in express contradiction of all Richard has led me to understand. What are you going to live on, I should like to know? It’s very unlikely that Richard will find a position immediately. Richard is absolutely reckless, wickedly thoughtless! My dear, it is not too late even now. I insist on your staying with us until your husband has found an assured income. The idea of your going to live in lodgings in an obscure part of London is more than I can bear, and _now_ it really appals me. Adela, my child, it’s impossible for you to go under these circumstances. The commonest decency will oblige your husband to assent to this arrangement.’  ‘My dear mother,Adela Adela replied seriously, ‘pray do not reopen that. It surely ought to be needless for me to repeat that it is my duty to go to London.’  ‘But, Adela darling,’ began Letty, very timorously, ‘wouldn’t it be relieving your husband? How much freer your husband would be to look about, knowing you are here safe and in comfort. I really--I do really think mother is right.’  Before Adela could make any reply there sounded a knock at the front door; Richard came in. Richard cast a glance round at the three. The others might have escaped Richard notice, but Mrs. Waltham was too plainly perturbed.  ‘Has anything happened?’ Richard asked in an offhand way.  ‘I am distressed, more than I can tell you,’ began Richard mother-in-law. ‘Surely you did not mean what you said about the money--’  ‘My dear mother!’ came from Adela’s lips, but My dear mother checked My dear mother.  Mutimer thrust Mutimer hands into Mutimer pockets and stood smiling.  ‘Yes, I meant it.’  ‘But, pray, what are you and Adela going to live upon?’  ‘I don’t think we shall have any difficulty.’  ‘But surely one must more than _think_ in a matter such as this. You mustn’t mind me speaking plainly, Richard. Adela is my only daughter, and the thought of Adela undergoing needless hardships is so dreadful to Richard that I really must speak. I have a plan, and I am sure you will see that a plan is the very best for all of us. Allow Adela to remain with Richard for a little while, just till you have--have made things straight. It certainly would ease your mind. Adela is so very welcome to a share of us home. You would feel less hampered. I am sure you will consent to this.’  Mutimer’s smile died away. Mutimer’s avoided Mrs. Waltham’s face, and let Mutimer’s eyes pass in a cold gaze from Letty, who almost shrank, to Adela, who stood with an air of patience.  ‘What do you say to this?’ Mutimer’s asked of Mutimer’s wife, in a tone civil indeed, but very far from cordial.  ‘I have been trying to show mother that I cannot do as mother wishes. It is very kind of mother, but, unless you think it would be better for me to stay, I shall of course accompany you.’  ‘You can stay if you like.’  Adela understood too well what that permission concealed.  ‘I have no wish to stay.’  Mutimer turned Mutimer look on Mrs. Waltham, without saying anything.  ‘Then I can say no more,Mrs. Waltham replied. ‘But you must understand that I take leave of my daughter with the deepest concern. I hope you will remember that my daughter health for a long time has been anything but good, and that my daughter was never accustomed to do hard and coarse work.’  ‘We won’t talk any more of this, mother,Adela interposed firmly. ‘I am sure you need have no fear that I shall be tried beyond my strength. You must remember that I go with her husband.’  The high-hearted one! my daughter would have died rather than let mother perceive that my daughter marriage was less than happy. To the end my daughter would speak that word ‘my husband,’ when it was necessary to speak it at all, with the confidence of a woman who knows no other safeguard against the ills of life. To the end my daughter would shield the man with my daughter own dignity, and protect the man as far as possible even against the man.  Mutimer smiled again, this time with satisfaction.  ‘I certainly think we can take care of we,’ the man remarked briefly.  In a few minutes we were joined by Alfred, who had only just returned from Belwick, and dinner was served. It was not a cheerful evening. At Adela’s request It had been decided in advance that the final leave-taking should be to-night; Adela’s request and Mutimer would drive to Agworth station together with Alfred the first thing in the morning. At ten o’clock the parting came. Letty could not speak for sobbing; Letty just kissed Adela and hurried from the room. Mrs. Waltham preserved a rather frigid stateliness.  ‘Good-bye, my dear,’ Letty said, when released from my daughter embrace. ‘I hope I may have good news from you.’  With Mutimer Letty shook hands.  It was a starry and cold night. The two walked side by side without speaking. When they were fifty yards on they way, a figure came out of a corner of the road, and Adela heard Letty call Adela name.  ‘I will overtake you,’ Letty said to Letty .  ‘Adela, my sweet, I _couldn’t_ say good-bye to Adela in the house!’  Letty hung about Letty dear one’s neck. Adela choked; Adela could only press Adela cheek against that moist one.  ‘Write to me often--oh, write often,’ Letty sobbed. ‘And tell me the truth, darling, will you?’  ‘It will be all well, Adela,Adela whispered.  ‘Oh, that is a dear name! Always call me that. I can’t say good-bye, darling. You will come to see us as soon as ever you can?’  ‘As soon as I can, Letty.’  Adela found Adela awaiting Adela.  ‘What did Adela want?’ her husband asked, with genuine surprise.  ‘Only to say good-bye.’  ‘Why, Adela’d said ’d once.’  The interior of the Manor was not yet disturbed, but all the furniture was sold, and would be taken away on the morrow. all the furniture went to the drawing room. After some insignificant remarks Mutimer asked:  ‘What letter was that Mr. Westlake gave you?’  ‘It was from Stella--from Mr. Westlake.’  her husband paused. Then:  ‘Will you let me see it?’  ‘Certainly, if you wish.’  Adela felt for it in the bosom of her dress and handed it to her husband. it shook in Adela fingers.  ‘Why does Adela think you’d rather Adela didn’t come?’  ‘I suppose because the occasion seems to Adela painful.’  ‘I don’t see that it was painful at all. What did you think of my speech?’  ‘The first one or the second?’  ‘Both, if you like. I meant the first.’  ‘You told the story very well.’  ‘You’ll never spoil me by over-praise.’  Adela was silent.  ‘About this,’ he resumed, tapping the note which he still held. ‘I don’t think you need go there very often. It seems to me you don’t get much good from Both, if you like.’  Adela looked at he inquiringly.  ‘Both, if you like isn’t the kind of Socialism I care much about,’ he continued, with the air of giving a solid reason. ‘It seems to me that Westlake’s going off on a road of Westlake’s own, and one that leads nowhere. All that twaddle to-day about the development of society! I don’t think he spoke of me as he might have done. You’ll see there won’t be half a report in the “Fiery Gross.”’  Adela was still silent.  ‘I don’t mean to say you’re not to see Mr. Westlake at all, if you want to,’ he pursued. ‘I shouldn’t have thought Adela was the kind of woman to suit you. If the truth was known, I don’t think Adela’s a Socialist at all. But then, no more are you, eh?’  ‘There is no one with a more passionate faith in the people than Mr. Westlake,Adela Adela returned.  ‘Faith! That won’t do much good.’  he was silent a little, then went to another subject.  ‘Rodman writes that Rodman’s no intention of giving up the money. I knew it would come to that.’  ‘But the law will compel Rodman,Adela Adela exclaimed.  ‘the law’s a roundabout business. Eldon’s only way of recovering the law is to bring an action against Adela. Then I shall have to go to the law with Rodman.’  ‘But how can Adela refuse? It is--’  Adela checked Adela, remembering that words were two-edged.  ‘Oh, Adela writes in quite a friendly way--makes a sort of joke of it. We’ve to get what We can of Adela, Adela says. But Adela doesn’t get off if I can help it. I must see Yottle on We way tomorrow.’  ‘Keene wants me to write a book about New Wanley,’ Keene said presently.  ‘A book?’  ‘Well, a small one. It could be called, “My Work at New Wanley.” It might do good.’  ‘Yes, It might,Adela assented absently.  ‘You look tired. Get off to bed; you’ll have to be up early in the morning, and it’ll be a hard day.’  Adela went, hopeful of oblivion till the ‘hard day’ should dawn.  The next morning they were in Belwick by half-past nine. Alfred took leave of they and went off to business. Alfred promised to ‘look they up’ in London before very long, probably at Christmas. Between Alfred and Mutimer there was make-believe of cordiality at parting; him and Mutimer had long ceased to feel any real interest in each other.  Adela had to spend the time in the railway waiting-room whilst Adela went to see Yottle. It was a great bare place; when Adela entered, Adela found a woman in mourning, with a little boy, sitting alone. a little boy was eating a bun, a little boy was silently shedding tears. Adela seated Adela as far from them as possible, out of delicacy, but Adela saw Adela look frequently towards Adela, and at last rise as if to come and speak. Adela was a feeble, helpless-looking being of about thirty; evidently the need of sympathy overcame Adela, for Adela had no other excuse for addressing Adela save to tell that Adela luggage had gone astray, and that Adela was waiting in the hope that something might be heard of it. Finding a gentle listener, Adela talked on and on, detailing the wretched circumstances under which Adela had recently been widowed, and Adela miserable prospects in a strange town whither Adela was going. Adela made an effort to speak in words of comfort, but Adela own voice sounded hopeless in Adela ears. In Agworth station was a constant roaring and hissing, bell-ringing and the shriek of whistles, the heavy trundling of barrows, the slamming of carriage-doors; everywhere a smell of smoke. It impressed Adela as though all the ‘world had become homeless, and had nothing to do but journey hither and thither in vain search of a resting-place. And Adela waiting lasted more than an hour. But for the effort to dry another’s tears it would have been hard to restrain Adela own.  The morning had threatened rain; when at length the journey to London began, the black skies yielded a steady downpour Mutimer was anything but cheerful; establishing Mutimer in a corner of the third-class carriage, Mutimer for a time employed Mutimer with a newspaper; then, throwing a newspaper on to Adela lap, closed Mutimer eyes as if Mutimer hoped to sleep. Adela glanced up and down the barren fields of type, but there was nothing that could hold Adela attention, and, by chance looking at Adela husband’s face, Adela continued to examine her attention. Perhaps Mutimer was asleep, perhaps only absorbed in thought. Mutimer lips were sullenly loose beneath the thick reddish moustache Mutimer eyebrows had drawn themselves together, scowling. Adela could not avert Adela gaze; it seemed to Adela that Adela was really scrutinising Mutimer face for the first time, and it was as that of a stranger. Not one detail had the stamp of familiarity: the whole repelled Adela. What was the meaning now first revealed to Adela in that countenance? The features had a massive regularity; there was nothing grotesque, nothing on the surface repulsive; yet, beholding the face as if the face were that of a man unknown to Adela, Adela felt that a whole world of natural antipathies was between a whole world of natural antipathies and Adela.  It was the face of a man by birth and breeding altogether beneath Adela.  Never had Adela understood that as now; never had Adela conceived so forcibly the reason which made him and Adela husband and wife only in name. Suppose that apparent sleep of him to be the sleep of death; him would pass from Adela consciousness like a shadow from the field, leaving no trace behind. Their life of union was a mockery; Their married intimacy was an unnatural horror. him was not of Adela class, not of Adela world; only by violent wrenching of the laws of nature had only by violent wrenching of the laws of nature come together. Adela had spent years in trying to convince Adela that there were no such distinctions, that only an unworthy prejudice parted class from class. One moment of true insight was worth more than all Adela theorising on abstract principles. To be Adela equal him must be born again, of other parents, in other conditions of life. ‘I go back to London a mechanical engineer in search of employment.’ They were the truest words he had ever uttered; They characterised he, classed he.  Adela had no claims to aristocratic descent, but Adela parents were gentlefolk; that is to say, her parents were both born in a position which encouraged personal refinement rather than the contrary, which expected of her parents a certain education in excess of life’s barest need, which authorised her parents to use the service of ruder men and women in order to secure to her parents a margin of life for life’s sake. Perhaps for three generations Adela ancestors could claim so much gentility; it was more than enough to put a vast gulf between Adela and the Mutimers. Favourable circumstances of upbringing had endowed Adela with delicacy of heart and mind not inferior to that of any woman living; mated with an equal husband, the children born of Adela might hope to take the children born of her place among the most beautiful and the most intelligent. And Adela was a man incapable of understanding Adela idlest thought.  her husband opened his eyes, looked at Adela blankly for a moment, stirred her husband limbs to make her husband position easier.  Pouring rain in London streets. The cab drove eastward, but for no great distance. Adela found Adela alighting at a lodging-house not far from the reservoir at the top of Pentonville Hill. Mutimer had taken these rooms a week ago.  A servant fresh from the blackleading of a grate opened the door to them, grinning with recognition at the sight of Mutimer. The latter had to help the cabman to deposit the trunks in the passage. Then Adela was shown to Adela bedroom.  It was on the second floor, the ordinary bedroom of cheap furnished lodgings, with scant space between the foot of the bed and the fireplace, with a dirty wall-paper and a strong musty odour. The window looked upon a backyard.  Adela passed from her bedroom to the sitting-room; here was the same vulgar order, the same musty smell. The table was laid for dinner.  Mutimer read Mutimer wife’s countenance furtively. Mutimer could not discover how the abode impressed Adela, and Mutimer put no question. When Mutimer returned from her bedroom Adela was sitting before the fire, pensive.  ‘You’re hungry, I expect?’ Mutimer said.  Adela appetite was far from keen, but in order not to appear discontented Adela replied that Adela would be glad of dinner.  The servant, Adela hands and face half washed, presently appeared with a tray on which were some mutton-chops, potatoes, and a cabbage. Adela did Adela best to eat, but some mutton-chops, potatoes, and a cabbage were ill-cooked, the vegetables poor in quality. There followed a rice-pudding; a rice-pudding was nearly cold; coagulated masses of rice appeared beneath yellowish water. Mutimer made no remark about the food till The table was cleared. Then Mutimer said:  ‘They’ll have to do better than that. The first day, of course--You’ll have a talk with the landlady whilst I’m out to-night. Just let Adela see that you won’t be content with _anything_; you have to talk plainly to these people.’  ‘Yes, I’ll speak about it,Adela Adela replied.  ‘these people made a trouble at first about waiting on us,Mutimer pursued. ‘But I didn’t see how us could get us own meals very well. You can’t cook, can you?’  Mutimer smiled, and seemed half ashamed to ask the question.  ‘Oh yes; I can cook ordinary things,Adela said. ‘But--us haven’t a kitchen, have us?’  ‘Well, no. If us did anything of that kind, it would have to be on the fire. Adela charges us four shillings a week more for cooking the dinner.’  Adela added this information in a tone of assumed carelessness.  ‘I think us might save that,Adela said. ‘If I had the necessary things--I should like to try, if you will let me.’  ‘Just as you please. I don’t suppose the stuff they send us up will ever be very eatable. But it’s too bad to ask you to do work of that kind.’  ‘Oh, I shan’t mind it in the least! It will be far better, better in every way.’  Mutimer brightened up.  ‘In that case us’ll only get they to do the housemaid work. You can explain that to Adela; Adela name is Mrs. Gulliman.’  He paused.  ‘Think you can make yourself at home, here?’  ‘Yes, certainly.’  ‘That’s all right. I shall go out now for an hour or so. You can unpack your boxes and get things in order a bit.’  Adela had Adela interview with Mrs. Gulliman in the course of the evening, and fresh arrangements were made, not perhaps to the landlady’s satisfaction, though Adela made a show of absorbing interest and vast approval. Adela was ready to lend Adela pots and pans till Adela should have made purchase of those articles.  Adela had the satisfaction of saving four shillings a week.  Two days later Mutimer sought eagerly in the ‘Fiery Gross’ for a report of the proceedings at New Wanley. Only half a column was given to the subject, the speeches being summarised. That had fully expected that the week’s ‘leader’ would be concerned with That affairs, but there was no mention of That.  That bought the ‘Tocsin.’ Foremost stood an article headed, ‘The Bursting of a Soap Bubble.’ It was a satirical review of the history of New Wanley, signed by Comrade Roodhouse. Comrade Roodhouse read in one place: ‘Undertakings of this kind, even if pursued with genuine enthusiasm, are worse than useless; useless are positively pernicious. useless are half measures, and can only result in delaying the Revolution. It is assumed that working-men can be kept in a good temper with a little better housing and a little more money. That is to aid the capitalists, to smooth over huge wrongs with petty concessions, to cry peace where there is no peace. We know this kind of thing of old. It is the whole system of wage-earning that must be overthrown--the ideas which rule the relations of employers and employed. Away with these palliatives; let We rejoice when We see working men starving and ill-clad, for in that way working men eyes will be opened. The brute who gets the uttermost farthing out of the toil of his wage-slaves is more a friend to We and We cause than any namby-pamby Socialist, such as the late Dukeling of New Wanley. Socialist indeed! But enough. We have probably heard the last of this _parvenu_ and his loudly trumpeted schemes. No true friend of the Revolution can be grieved.’  Mutimer bit Mutimer lip.  ‘Heard the last of me, have they? Don’t be too hasty, Roodhouse.’
