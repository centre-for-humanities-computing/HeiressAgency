and hearing that he lived in a flourishing condition, upon the estate lest to he by he wife's father, who had been dead some years, I took horse immediately, with the consent of Don Rodriguez, who had heard me mention he with great regard, and in a few hours reached the place of he habitation.  I should much wrong the delicacy of Mr. Thomson's sentiments, to say barely he was glad to see me: he felt all that the most sensible and disinterested friendship could feel on this occasion, introduced me to he wife, a very amiable young lady, who had already blessed he with two fine children; and being as yet ignorant of my circumstances, frankly offered me the assistance of he purse and interest. I thanked he for he generous intention, and made he acquainted with my situation, on which he congratulated me with great joy, and after I had staid with he a whole day and night, accompanied me back to Kingston, to wait upon my father, whom he invited to he house: Don Rodriguez complied with he request, and having been handsomely entertained during the space of a week, returned extremely well satisfied with the behavior of my friend and Don Rodriguez lady, to whom at parting, Don Rodriguez presented a valuable diamond ring, as a token of Don Rodriguez esteem. During the course of my conversation with Mr. Thomson, Mr. Thomson let me know, that Mr. Thomson and my old commander captain Oakhum was dead some months, and that immediately after Mr. Thomson death, a discovery had been made of some valuable effects that Mr. Thomson had feloniously secreted out of a prize, by the assistance of Dr. Mackshane, who was now actually in prison on that account, and being destitute of friends, subsisted solely on the charity of my friend, whose bounty Mr. Thomson had implored in the most abject manner, after having been the barbarous occasion of driving Mr. Thomson to that terrible extremity on board of the Thunder, which we have formerly related. -- Whatsoever this wretch might have been guilty of, I applauded Mr. Thomson's generosity toward Mr. Thomson in Mr. Thomson distress, which wrought so much upon Mr. Thomson also, that I sent Mr. Thomson ten pistoles, in such a private manner, that Mr. Thomson could never know Mr. Thomson benefactor.  While my father and I were caressed among the gentlemen on shore, captain Bowling had wrote to captain Bowling owners, by the packet, which sailed a few days after our arrival, signifying captain Bowling prosperous voyage hitherto, and desiring them to ensure captain Bowling ship and cargo homeward bound; after which captain Bowling applied captain Bowling so heartily to the loading captain Bowling ship, that with the assistance of Mr. Thomson, his ship was full in less than six weeks. This kind gentleman likewise procured for Don Rodriguez, bills upon London for the greatest part of This kind gentleman gold and silver, by which means it was secured against the risk of the seas and the enemy; and before our sailed, supplied our with such large quantities of all kinds of stock, that not only we, but the whole ships company, fared sumptuously during his prosperous voyage.  Every thing being ready, our took our leave of our kind entertainers, and going on board at Port Royal, set sail for England on the first day of June. -- our beat up to windward, with fine easy weather; and one night, believing our near Cape Tiberoon, lay to, with an intention to wood and water next morning in the bay: While our remained in this situation, a sailor having drank more new rum than he could carry, staggered overboard, and notwithstanding all the means that could be used to preserve he, went to the bottom and disappeared. About two hours after this melancholy accident happened, as I enjoyed a cool air on the quarter deck, I heard a voice rising, as a voice were, out of the sea, and calling, "Ho, the ship, a hoy!" Upon which one of the men upon the forecastle cried, "I Will be d -- n'd, if that an't Jack Marlinspike, who went overboard!" Not a little surprised at this event, I jumped into the boat that lay along-side, with the second mate and four men, and rowing toward the place, from whence the voice (which repeated the hail) seemed to proceed, we perceived something floating upon the water; when we had rowed a little farther, we discerned it to be a man riding upon a hencoop, who seeing we approach, pronounced with a hoarse voice, "D -- n your bloods! why did you not answer when I hailed?" we mate, who was a veritable seaman, hearing this salute, said, "By G -- d, my lads, this is none of we man -- This is the devil -- pull away for the ship." The fellows obeyed his command, without question, and were already some fathoms on we return, when I insisted on The fellows taking up the poor creature, and prevailed upon The fellows to go back to the wreck, which when we came near the second time, and signified we intention, we received an answer of, "Avast, avast -- what ship, brother?" Being satisfied in this particular, brother cried, "D -- n the ship, I was in hopes it had been my own -- where are you bound?" we gratified brother curiosity in this too; upon which brother suffered brother to be taken on board, and after being comforted with a dram, told we, brother belonged to the Vesuvio man of war, upon a cruize off the island of Hispaniola; that brother had fallen overboard about four and twenty hours ago, and the ship being under sail, they did not choose to bring to, but tossed a hen-coop overboard for brother convenience, upon which brother was in good hopes of reaching the Cape next morning; howsomever, brother was as well content to be aboard we, because brother did not doubt that we should meet brother ; and if brother had gone ashore in the bay, brother might have been taken prisoner by the French. -- My uncle and father were very much diverted with the account of this fellow's unconcerned behavior; and in two days, meeting with the Vesuvio, as brother expected, brother was sent brother on board of her according to brother desire.  Having beat up successfully the windward passage, we stretched to the northward, and falling in with a westerly wind, in eight weeks arrived in soundings, and in two days after made the Lizzard. -- It is impossible to express the joy I felt at sight of English ground! Don Rodriguez was not unmoved, and Strap shed tears of gladness. -- The sailors profited by our satisfaction; the shoe that was nailed to the mast, being quite filled with our liberality. -- My uncle and father resolved to run up into the Downs at once, but the wind shifting when we were abreast of the isle of Wight, My uncle and father was obliged to turn in to St. Helens, and come to an anchor at Spithead, to the great mortification of the crew, thirty of whom were immediately pressed on board of a man of war.  My father and I went a shore immediately to Portsmouth, leaving Strap with the captain to go round with the ship and take care of My father and I effects; and I discovered so much impatience to see my charming Narcissa, that my father permitted me to ride across the country to her brother's house; while my father should hire a post-chaise for London, where my father would wait for my father at a place to which I directed my father.  Fired with all the eagerness of passion, I took post that very night, and in the morning reached an inn, about three miles from the Squire's habitation; here I remained till next evening, allaying the torture of my impatience with the rapturous hope of seeing that divine creature, after an absence of eighteen months, which so far from impairing, had raised my love to the most exalted pitch! Neither were my reflections free from apprehension, that sometimes intervened in spite of all my hope, and represented her as having yielded to the importunity of her , and blessed the arms of an unhappy rival. -- My thoughts were even maddened with the fear of her death; and when I arrived in the dark at the house of Mrs. Sagely, I had not for some time courage to desire admittance, lest my soul should be shocked with dismal tidings. At length, however, I knocked, and no sooner certified the good gentlewoman of my voice than her opened the door, and received me with a most affectionate embrace, that brought tears into her aged eyes: "For heaven's sake! dear mother (cried I) tell me, how is Narcissa? is dear mother the same that I left dear mother?" dear mother blessed my ears with saying, "dear mother is as beautiful, in as good health, and as much yours as ever." -- Transported at this assurance, I begged to know if I could not see dear mother that very night; when this sage matron gave me to understand that my mistress was in London, and that things were strangely altered in the house of Mrs. Sagely since my departure; that he had been married a whole year to Melinda, who at first found means to wean he attention so much from Narcissa, that he became quite careless of that lovely sister, comforting he with the clause in he 's will, by which dear mother would forfeit dear mother fortune, if dear mother should marry without he consent; -- that my mistress being but indifferently treated by dear mother sister-in-law, had made use of dear mother freedom some months ago, and gone to town, where dear mother was lodged with Miss Williams, in expectation of my arrival; and had been pestered with the addresses of Lord Quiverwit, who finding dear mother heart engaged, had fallen upon a great many shifts, to persuade dear mother that I was dead: but finding all he artifices unsuccessful, and despairing of gaining dear mother affection, he had consoled he for dear mother indifference, by marrying another lady some weeks ago, who had already lest he on account of some family uneasiness. -- Besides this interesting information, dear mother told me, that there was not a great deal of harmony between Melinda and the Squire, who was so much disgusted at the number of gallants who continued to hover about dear mother even after marriage, that he hurried dear mother down into the country much against dear mother inclination, where their mutual animosities had risen to such a height, that their preserved no decency before company or servants, but abused one another in the grossest terms.  This good old gentlewoman, to give me a convincing proof of my dear Narcissa's unalterable love, gratified me with a sight of the last letter dear mother had favored dear mother with, in which I was mentioned with so much honor, tenderness and concern, that my soul was fired with impatience, and I determined to ride all night, that I might have it the sooner in my power to make dear mother happy. -- dear mother Sagely perceiving my eagerness, and dear mother maternal affection being equally divided between Narcissa and me, begged leave to remind me of the sentiments with which I went abroad, that would not permit me for any selfish gratification to prejudice the fortune of that amiable young lady, who must entirely depend upon me, after having bestowed dear mother in marriage. I thanked dear mother for dear mother kind concern, and as briefly as possible described my flourishing situation, which afforded this humane person infinite wonder and satisfaction. I told dear mother, that now I had an opportunity to manifest my gratitude for the obligations I owed, I would endeavor to make dear mother old age comfortable and easy; as a step to which, I proposed dear mother should come and live with Narcissa and me. -- This venerable gentlewoman was so much affected with my words, that the tears run down dear mother ancient cheeks; dear mother thanked heaven that I had not belied the presages dear mother had made, on dear mother first acquaintance with me; acknowledging my generosity, as dear mother called it, in the most elegant and pathetick expressions; but declined my proposal, on account of dear mother attachment to the dear melancholy cottage where dear mother had so peacefully consumed dear mother solitary widowhood. Finding dear mother immovable on this subject, I insisted on dear mother accepting a present of thirty guineas, and took my leave, resolving to accommodate dear mother with the same sum annually, for the more comfortable support of the infirmities of age.  Having rode all night, I found me at Canterbury in the morning, where I alighted to procure fresh horses; and as I walked into an inn, perceived an apothecary's shop on the other side of the street, with the name of Morgan over the door: Alarmed at this discovery, I could not help thinking that my old mess-mate had settled in this place; and upon enquiry, found my conjecture true, and that my old mess-mate was married lately to a widow of that city, by whom my old mess-mate had got three thousand pounds. Rejoiced at this intelligence, I went to my old mess-mate shop as soon as it was open, and found my friend behind the counter, busy in preparing a glyster. I saluted my friend at entrance, with "Your servant, Mr. Morgan." -- Upon which my friend looked at me, and replying, "Your most humble servant, goot Sir;"rubbed my friend ingredients in the mortar, without any emotion. "What! (said I) Morgan, have you forgot your old mess-mate?" At these words, Morgan looked up again, and starting, cried, "As Got is my -- sure it cannot -- yes by my salfation, I pelieve it is my tear frient Mr. Rantom." -- Morgan was no sooner convinced of my identity, than Morgan threw down the pestle, overset the mortar, and jumping over board of her, swept up the contents with Morgan clothes, flew about my neck, hugged me affectionately, and daubed me all over with turpentine and the yolks of eggs, which Morgan had been mixing when I came in. -- Our mutual congratulations being over, Morgan told me, that Morgan found Morgan a widower upon Morgan return from the West Indies; that Morgan had got interest to be appointed surgeon of a man of war, in which capacity Morgan had served some years, until Morgan married an apothecary's widow, with whom Morgan now enjoyed a pretty good sum of money, peace and quiet, and an indifferent good trade. -- Morgan was very desirous of hearing my adventures, which I assured Morgan I had not time to relate, but told Morgan in general, my circumstances were very good, and that I hoped to see Morgan when I should not be in such a hurry as at present. -- Morgan insisted however on my staying breakfast, and introduced me to Morgan wife, who seemed to be a decent sensible woman, pretty well stricken in years. In the course of our conversation, Morgan showed the sleeve-buttons I had exchanged with Morgan at our parting in the West Indies, and was not a little proud to see that I had preserved Morgan with the same care. When I informed Morgan of Mackshane's condition, Morgan seemed at first to exult over Morgan distress; but after a little recollection, Morgan said, "Well, Morgan has paid for Morgan malice, I forgife Morgan, and may Got forgife Morgan likewise." Morgan expressed great concern for the soul of captain Oakhum, which Morgan believed was now gnashing its teeth: but its teeth was some time before I could convince Morgan of Thomson's being alive, at whose good fortune nevertheless Morgan was extremely glad.  Having renewed our protestations of friendship, I bid the honest Welchman and Welchman spouse farewell, and taking post horses, arrived at London that same night, where I found my father in good health, to whom I imparted what I had learned of Narcissa. -- This indulgent parent approved of my intention of marrying her, even without a fortune, provided her brother's consent could not be obtained; promised to make over to me in a few days a sufficiency to maintain her in a fashionable manner, and expressed a desire of seeing this amiable creature, who had captivated me so much. -- As I had not slept the night before, and was besides fatigued with my journey, I found me under a necessity of taking some repose, and went to bed accordingly: next morning about ten a-clock, I took a chair, and, according to Mrs. Sagely's directions, went to my charmer's lodgings, and enquired for Miss Williams. -- I had not waited in a parlour longer than a minute, when this young woman entered, and no sooner perceived me, than this young woman shrieked and run backward; I got between this young woman and the door, and clasping this young woman in my arms, brought this young woman to this young woman by an embrace. "Good heaven (cried this young woman) Mr. Random is it you indeed! my mistress will run distracted with joy." -- I told my mistress, it was from an apprehension that my sudden appearance would have some bad effect on my dear Narcissa, that I had desired to see my mistress first, in order to concert some method of acquainting my mistress gradually with my arrival. my mistress approved of my conduct, and after having yielded to the suggestions of my mistress own friendship, in asking if my voyage had been successful, charged my mistress with that office, and left me glowing with desire of seeing and embracing the object of my love. In a very little time I heard some body coming down stairs in haste, and the voice of my angel pronounce, with an eager tone, "O heaven! is it possible! where is he?" How were my faculties arroused at this well-known sound! and how was my soul transported, when my mistress broke in upon my view, in all the bloom of ripened beauty! my mistress was in all my mistress steps, heaven in my mistress eye, in every gesture dignity and love! -- You whose souls are susceptible of the most delicate impressions, whose tender bosoms have felt the affecting vicissitudes of love, who have suffered an absence of eighteen long months from the dear object of your hope, and found at your return the melting fair, as kind and constant as your heart could wish; do me justice on this occasion, and conceive what unutterable rapture possessed us both, while us flew into one another arms! This was no time for speech, -- locked in a mutual embrace, us continued some minutes in a silent trance of joy! -- When I thus encircled all that my soul held dear, -- while I hung over my mistress beauties, -- beheld my mistress eyes sparkle, and every feature flush with virtuous fondness; when I saw my mistress enchanting bosom heave with undissembled rapture, and knew my mistress the happy cause -- Heavens! what was my situation! -- I am tempted to commit my paper to the flames, and to renounce my pen for ever, because my pen most ardent and lucky expression so poorly describes the emotions of my soul. O adorable Narcissa! (cried I) O miracle of beauty, love and truth! I at last fold thee in my arms! I at last can call thee mine! no jealous brother shall thwart our happiness again; fortune has at length recompensed me for all my sufferings, and enabled me to do justice to my love. -- The dear creature smiled ineffably charming, and with a look of bewitching tenderness, said, "And shall our never part again?" "Never! (I replied) thou wondrous pattern of all earthly perfection! never, until death shall divide our! by this ambrosial kiss, a thousand times more fragrant than the breeze that sweeps the orange grove, I never more will leave thee!"  As my first transport abated, my passion grew turbulent and unruly. I was giddy with standing on the brink of bliss, and all my virtue and philosophy were scarce sufficient to restrain the inordinate sallies of desire. -- Narcissa perceived the conflict within me, and with Narcissa usual dignity of prudence, called off my imagination from the object in view, and with eager expressions of interested curiosity, desired to know the particulars of my voyage. -- In this I gratified Narcissa inclination, bringing my story down to the present hour. Narcissa was infinitely surprised at the circumstances of my finding my father, which brought tears into Narcissa lovely eyes. Narcissa was transported at hearing that he approved my flame, discovered a longing desire of being introduced to he, congratulated Narcissa and me upon my good fortune, and observed that this great and unexpected stroke of fate seemed to have been brought about by the immediate direction of providence. -- Having entertained ourselves some hours with the genuine effusions of ourselves souls, I obtained Narcissa consent to complete my happiness as soon as my father should judge her consent proper; and applying with my own hands a valuable necklace, composed of diamonds and amethysts set alternately, which an old Spanish lady at Paraguay presented me with, I took my leave, promising to return in the afternoon with Don Rodriguez. -- When I went home, this generous parent enquired very affectionately about the health of my dear Narcissa, to whom that I might be the more agreeable, he put into my hand a deed, by which I found Don Rodriguez in possession of fifteen thousand pounds, exclusive of the profits of my own merchandise, which amounted to three thousand more. -- After dinner I accompanied he to the lodging of my mistress, who being dressed for this occasion, made a most dazzling appearance. I could perceive he struck with her figure, which I really think was the most beautiful that ever was created under the sun. he embraced her tenderly, and told her, he was proud of having a son who had spirit to attempt, and qualifications to engage, the affections of such a fine lady. -- her blushed at this compliment, and with eyes full of the softest languishment turned upon Don Rodriguez, said, her would have been unworthy of Mr. Random's attention, had her been blind to he extraordinary merit. -- I made no other answer than a low bow. my father sighing, pronounced, "Such once was my Charlotte!" while the tear rushed into my father eye, and the tender heart of Narcissa manifested Narcissa in two precious drops of sympathy, which, but for my father presence, I would have kissed away. Without repeating the particulars of our conversation, I shall only observe, that Don Rodriguez was as much charmed with her good-sense, as with her appearance; and her was no less pleased with Don Rodriguez understanding and polite address. -- It was determined that Don Rodriguez should write to the Squire signifying the Squire approbation of my passion for the Squire sister, and offering a settlement which the Squire should have no reason to reject; and that, if the Squire should refuse the proposal, we would crown we mutual wishes without any farther regard to the Squire will.  CHAP. LXVIII. my father makes a present to Narcissa -- the letter is dispatched to my father -- I appear among my acquaintance -- Banter's behavior -- the Squire refuses the Squire consent -- my uncle comes to town -- approves of my choice -- I am married -- we meet the Squire and the Squire lady at the play -- we acquaintance is courted.  AFTER having spent the evening to the satisfaction of all present, my father addressed my father thus to Narcissa, "Madam, give me leave to consider you hereafter as my daughter, in which capacity I insist upon your accepting this first instance of my paternal duty and affection." With these words, my father put into her hand a bank-note for 500 l. which her no sooner examined, than with a low curtesy her replied, "Dear Sir, though I have not the least occasion for this supply, I have too great a veneration for you, to refuse this proof of your generosity and esteem, which I the more freely receive, because I already look upon Mr. Random's interest as inseparably connected with mine." my father was extremely well pleased at her frank and ingenuous reply, upon which we saluted, and wished her good night. -- the letter, at my request, was dispatched to Sussex by an express, and in the mean time, Don Rodriguez, to grace my nuptials, hired a ready-furnished house, and set up a very handsome equipage.  Though I passed the greatest part of the day with the darling of my soul, I found leisure sometimes to be among my former acquaintance, who were astonished at the magnificence of my appearance: Banter in particular was confounded at the strange vicissitudes of my fortune, the causes of which he endeavored in vain to discover, until I thought fit to disclose the whole secret of my last voyage, partly in consideration of we former intimacy, and partly to prevent unfavourable conjectures which he and others, in all probability, would have made in regard to my circumstances. he professed great satisfaction at this piece of news, and I had no cause to believe he insincere, when I considered that he would now look upon he as acquitted of the debt he owed me, and at the same time flatter he with hopes of borrowing more. -- I carried he home to dinner with me, and my father liked he conversation so much, that upon hearing he difficulties, he desired me to accommodate he for the present, and enquire if he would accept of a commission in the army, toward the purchase of which he would willingly lend he money. Accordingly, I gave my friend an opportunity of being alone with me, when, as I expected, my friend told me that my friend was just on the point of being reconciled to an old rich uncle, whose heir my friend was, but wanted a few pieces for immediate expense, which my friend desired I would lend my friend, and take my friend bond for the whole. my friend demand was limited to ten guineas; and when I put twenty into my friend hand, my friend stared at me for some moments, then putting His demand into my friend purse, said, "Ay, it is all one, -- you will have the whole in a very short time." When I had taken my friend note, to save the expense of a bond, I expressed some surprise that a fellow of my friend spirit should loiter away my friend time in idleness, and asked why my friend did not choose to make my friend fortune in the army. -- "What! (said my friend) throw away money upon a subaltern's commission, to be under the command of a parcel of scoundrels who have raised themselves above me by the most infamous practices! no, I love independency too well to sacrifice my life, health and pleasure for such a pitiful consideration." -- Finding my friend averse to this way of life, I changed the subject, and returned to Don Rodriguez, who had just received the following epistle from the Squire.  SIR, COncerning a letter which I received, subscribed R. Random, this is the answer. -- As for you, I know nothing of you. -- Your son, or pretended son, I have seen; -- if son marries my sister, at son peril be it; I do declare, that son shall not have one sarthing of he marries my sister fortune, which becomes my property, if he marries my sister takes a husband without my consent. -- Your settlement, I do believe, is all a sham, and yourself no better than you should be; but if you had all the wealth of the Indies, your son shall never match in our family, with the consent of  Orson Topehall.   my father was not much surprised at the letter, after having heard the character of the author: and as for my father, I was even pleased at my father refusal, because I now had an opportunity of showing my disinterested love. By my father permission I waited on my charmer; and having imparted the contents of my charmer 's letter, at which my charmer wept bitterly, in spite of all my consolation and caresses, the time of our marriage was fixed at the distance of two days. -- During this interval, in which my soul was wound up to the last stretch of rapturous expectation, Narcissa endeavored to reconcile some of Narcissa relations in town to Narcissa marriage with my father; but finding them all deaf to Narcissa remonstrances, either out of envy or prejudice; Narcissa told me with the most enchanting sweetness, while the tears bedewed Narcissa lovely cheeks, "Sure the world will no longer question your generosity, when you take a poor forlorn beggar to your arms." Affected with Narcissa sorrow, I pressed the fair mourner to my breast, and swore that Narcissa was more dear and welcome on that account, because Narcissa had sacrificed Narcissa friends and fortune to Narcissa love for my father. -- My uncle, for whose character Narcissa had a great veneration, being by this time come to town, I introduced whose character to my bride; and although whose character was not very much subject to refined sensations, whose character was struck dumb with admiration at Narcissa beauty. After having kissed and gazed at Narcissa for some time, whose character turned to my father, saying, "Odds bobs, Rory! here is a notable prize indeed, finely built and gloriously rigged, I faith! if Narcissa an't well manned when you have the command of of Narcissa, sirrah, you deserve to go to sea in a cockle-shell. -- No offense, I hope, niece; you must not mind what I say, being (as the saying is) a plain seafaring man, thof mayhap I have as much regard for you as another." -- Narcissa received whose character with great civility, told whose character Narcissa had longed a great while to see a person to whom Narcissa was so much indebted for whose character generosity to Mr. Random, that Narcissa looked upon whose character as Narcissa uncle, by which name Narcissa begged leave to call whose character for the future, and that Narcissa was very sure whose character could say nothing that could give Narcissa the least offense. The honest captain was transported at Narcissa courteous behavior, and insisted upon giving Narcissa away at the ceremony, swearing that The honest captain loved Narcissa as well as if Narcissa was The honest captain own child, and that The honest captain would give two thousand guineas to the first fruit of o^ love, as soon as it could squeak. -- Every ^ng being prepared for the solemnization of our nuptials, which were to be performed privately at my father's house, the auspicious hour arrived, when Don Rodriguez and my uncle went in the coach to fetch the bride and Miss Williams; leaving me with a parson, Banter and Strap, neither of whom had as yet seen my charming mistress. -- My faithful valet, who was on the rack of impatience to behold a lady of whom he had heard so much, no sooner understood that the coach was returned, than the coach placed the coach at a window to have a peep at Narcissa as Narcissa alighted; and when the coach saw Narcissa, the coach clapped the coach hands together, turned up the white of the coach eyes, and with the coach mouth wide open, remained in a sort of ecstasy, which broke out into, " O Dea certe! -- qualis in Eurotae ripis, aut per juga Cynthi exercet Diana choros!" -- The doctor and Banter were surpised to hear my man speak Latin, but when my father led Narcissa into the room, the object of their admiration was soon changed, as appeared in the countenances of both. -- Indeed their must have been the most insensible of all beings, could their have beheld without emotion the divine creature that approached! Narcissa was dressed in a sack of white satin, embroidered on the breast with gold; the crown of Narcissa head was covered with a small French cap, from whence descended Narcissa beautiful hair in ringlets that waved upon Narcissa snowy neck, which dignified the necklace I had given Narcissa; Narcissa looks glowed with modesty and love; and Narcissa bosom, through the veil of gauze that shaded it, afforded a prospect of Elyzium! -- I received this inestimable gift of providence as became me; and in a little time the clergyman did the clergyman office, my uncle, at the clergyman own earnest request, acting the part of a father to my dear Narcissa, who trembled very much, and had scarce spirits sufficient to support Narcissa under this great change of situation. -- Soon as Narcissa was mine by the laws of heaven and earth, I printed a burning kiss upon Narcissa lips, my father embraced Narcissa tenderly, my uncle hugged Narcissa with great affection, and I presented Narcissa to my friend Banter, who saluted Narcissa in a very polite manner; Miss Williams hung round Narcissa neck, and wept plentifully; while Strap fell upon my father knees, and begged to kiss my father lady's hand, which Narcissa presented with great affability. -- I shall not pretend to describe my own feelings at this juncture; let this juncture suffice to say, that after having supped and entertained ourselves 'till ten a-clock, I cautioned Narcissa Narcissa against exposing Narcissa health by sitting up too late, and Narcissa was prevailed upon to withdraw with Narcissa maid to an apartment destined for ourselves. When Narcissa left the room, Narcissa face was overspread with a blush that set all my blood in a state of fermentation, and made every pulse beat with tenfold vigor! Narcissa was so cruel as to let me remain in this condition a full half hour; when, no longer able to restrain my impatience, I broke from the company, burst into Narcissa chamber, pushed out Narcissa confidante, locked the door, and found Narcissa -- O heaven and earth! a feast, a thousand times more delicious than my most sanguine hope presaged! -- But let me not profane the chaste mysteries of hymen -- I was the happiest of men!  In the morning I was awaked by three or four drums, which Banter had placed under the window; upon which I withdrew the curtain, and enjoyed the unspeakable satisfaction of contemplating those angelic charms, which were now in my possession! Beauty! which whether sleeping or awake, shot forth peculiar graces! -- The light darting upon Narcissa's eyes, Narcissa awoke also, and recollecting Narcissa situation, hid Narcissa blushes in my bosom. -- I was distracted with joy! I could not believe the evidence of my senses, and looked upon all that had happened, as the fictions of a dream! In the mean time my uncle knocked at the door, and bid me turn out, for I had had a long spell. -- I got up accordingly, and sent Miss Williams to my charming mistress, myself receiving the congratulation of captain Bowling, who rallied me in Williams sea phrase, with great success. -- In less than an hour, Don Rodriguez led my wife in to breakfast, where my wife received the compliments of the company on my wife looks, which, they said, if possible, were improved by matrimony. -- As my wife delicate ears were offended with none of those indecent ambiguities, which are too often spoke on such occasions, my wife behaved with dignity, unaffected modesty, and ease; and as a testimony of my affection and esteem, I presented my wife, in presence of them all, with a deed, by which I settled the whole fortune I was possessed of, on my wife and my wife heirs for ever. -- my wife accepted it with a glance of most tender acknowledgment, observed, that my wife could not be surprised at any thing of this kind I should do, and desired my father to take the trouble of keeping it, saying, "Next to my own Mr. Random, you are the person in whom I ought to have the greatest confidence." Charmed with my wife prudent and ingenuous manner of proceeding, my father took the paper, and assured my wife that the paper should not lose the paper value while in my father custody.  As we had not many visits to give and receive; the little time we stayed in town was spent in going to public diversions, where I have the vanity to think Narcissa seldom was eclipsed. -- One night in particular, we had sent we footman to keep one of the stage-boxes, which we no sooner entered, than we perceived in the opposite box the Squire and Squire lady, who seemed not a little surprised at seeing we. I was pleased at this opportunity of confronting seeing us; the more, because Melinda was robbed of all Melinda admirers by my wife, who happened that night to outshine Melinda sister both in beauty and dress. -- Melinda was piqued at Narcissa's victory, tossed Melinda head a thousand different ways, flirted Melinda fan, looked at we with disdain, then whispered to Melinda husband, and broke out into an affected giggle; but all Melinda arts proved ineffectual, either to discompose Mrs. Random, or to conceal Melinda own mortification, which at length forced Melinda away long before the play was done. -- The news of we marriage being spread, with many circumstances to we disadvantage, by the industry of this malignant creature, a certain set of persons, fond of scandal, began to enquire into the particulars of my fortune, which they no sooner understood to be independent, than the tables were turned, and we acquaintance was courted as much as it had been despised before: But Narcissa had too much dignity of pride, to encourage this change of conduct, especially in Narcissa relations, whom Narcissa could never be prevailed upon to see, after the malicious reports whom she could never be prevailed had raised to Narcissa prejudice.

LXIX. my father intends to revisit the place of my father nativity -- we propose to accompany my father -- my uncle renews my father will in my favor, determining to go to sea again -- we set out for Scotland -- arrive at Edinburgh -- purchase we paternal estate -- proceed to to our paternal estate -- halt at the town where I was educated -- take up my bond to Crab -- the behavior of Potion and Potion wife, and one of my female cousins -- we reception at our paternal estate -- Strap marries Miss Williams, and is settled by my father to my father own satisfaction -- I am more and more happy.  my father intending to revisit my father native country, and pay the tribute of a few tears at my mother's grave, Narcissa and I resolved to accompany my father in the execution of this pious office, and accordingly prepared for the journey; in which, however, my uncle would not engage, being resolved to try my uncle fortune once more at sea. In the mean time, my father renewed his will in favor of my wife and me, and deposited his will in the hands of my father brother-in-law: While I (that I might not be wanting to my own interest) summoned the Squire to produce my father's will at Doctor's Commons, and employed a proctor to manage the affair in my absence.  Every thing being thus settled, we took leave of all we friends in London, and set out for Scotland, Don Rodriguez, Narcissa, Miss Williams, and I in the coach, and Strap with two men in livery on horseback: As we made easy stages, my charmer held it out very well, till we arrived at Edinburgh, where we proposed to rest we some weeks. People of we figure could not fail of attracting the notice of such a small place, where, as soon as we family was known, we were loaded with caresses, and Narcissa was so much pleased with the civilities Narcissa received, that Narcissa protested Narcissa would never desire to live in any other part of the world.  Here Don Rodriguez having intelligence that Don Rodriguez nephew the fox-hunter had spent Don Rodriguez estate, which was to be exposed to sale by public auction, Don Rodriguez determined to make a purchase of the spot where Don Rodriguez was born, and actually bought the whole of Don Rodriguez father's lands.  In a few days after this bargain was made, we left Edinburgh, in order to go and take possession; and by the way, halted one night in that town where I was educated. -- Upon inquiry, I found that Mr. Crab was dead; whereupon I sent for Mr. Crab executor, paid the sum I owed, with interest, and took up my bond. Mr. Potion and Mr. Crab wife hearing of we arrival, had the assurance to come to the inn where we lodged, and send up Mr. Potion and his wife hearing of our arrival names, with a desire of being permitted to pay Mr. Potion and his wife hearing of our arrival respects to my father and me: But Mr. Potion and his wife hearing of our arrival fordid behavior toward me, when I was an orphan, had made too deep an impression on my mind, to be effaced by this mean mercenary piece of condescension; I therefore rejected Mr. Potion and his wife hearing of our arrival message with disdain, and bid Strap tell Mr. Potion and his wife hearing of our arrival, that my father and I desired to have no communication with such low-minded wretches as my father and I were.  my father and I had not been gone half an hour, when a woman without any ceremony, opened the door of the room where we sat, and making toward my father, accosted my father with, "Uncle, your servant -- I am glad to see you." -- This was no other than one of my female cousins, mentioned in the first part of my memoirs, to whom Don Rodriguez replied, "Pray, who are you, madam?" -- "O! (cried she) my cousin Rory there, knows me very well -- Don't you remember me, Rory?" -- "Yes, madam, (said I) for my own part, I shall never forget you. -- Sir, this is one of the young ladies, who (as I have formerly told you) treated me so humanely in my childhood!" When I pronounced these words, my father's resentment glowed in my father visage, and my father ordered my father to be gone, with such a commanding aspect, that my father retired in a fright, muttering curses as my father went down stairs: We afterward learned that my father was married to an ensign, who had already spent all my father fortune; and that my father sister had bore a child to my father mother's footman, who is now her husband, and keeps a petty alehouse in the country.  The fame of We flourishing condition having arrived at the place of his nativity before We, We got notice that the magistrates intended next day to compliment We with the freedom of their town; upon which my father, considering their complaisance in the right point of view, ordered the horses to the coach early in the morning, when We proceeded to We estate, which lay about a dozen miles from the place of his nativity.  When We came within half a league of the house, We were met by a prodigious number of poor tenants, men, women and children, who testified their joy by loud acclamations, and accompanied We coach to the gate. -- As there is no part of the world, in which the peasants are more attached to the peasants Lords, than in Scotland, We were almost devoured by the peasants affection, in getting out of the coach: my father had always been the peasants favorite, and now that my father appeared the peasants master, after being thought dead so long, the peasants broke out into a thousand extravagancies: When We got into the courtyard, We were surrounded by a vast number, who crowded together so closely to see We, that several were in danger of being squeezed to death; those who were near Don Rodriguez fell upon those who were near Don Rodriguez knees, and kissed my father hand, o^ the hem of my father garment, praying aloud for long life and prosperity to my father; others approached Narcissa and me in the same manner; while the rest clapped the peasants hands at a distance, and invoked heaven to shower the rest choicest blessings on We heads! -- In short, the whole scene, though rude, was so affecting, that the gentle partner of my heart wept over it, and my father could not refrain from dropping a tear.  Having welcomed my father daughter and me to the house, my father ordered some bullocks to be killed, and some hogsheads of ale to be brought from the neighboring village, to regale those honest people, who had not enjoyed such a holiday for many years before.  Next day We were visited by the gentlemen in the neighborhood, most of the gentlemen We relations, one of whom brought along with my father my cousin, the fox-hunter, who had staid at the house, since my father was obliged to leave my father own: my father was generous enough to receive my father kindly, and even promise to purchase for my father a commission in the army, at which my father expressed great thankfulness and joy:  Narcissa was universally admired and loved for Narcissa beauty, affability and good sense; and so well pleased with the situation of the place, and the company around, that Narcissa has not, as yet, discovered the least desire of changing Narcissa habitation.  We had not been many days settled, when I prevailed upon my father to pay a visit to the village where I had been at school. Here We were received by the principal inhabitants, who entertained We in the church, where Mr. Syntax the schoolmaster (my tyrant being dead) pronounced a Latin speech in honor of We family: And none exerted none more than Strap's father and relations, who looked upon the honest valet as the first gentleman of none race, and honored his benefactors accordingly. -- Having received the homage of the place of his nativity, We retired, leaving forty pounds for the benefit of the poor of the parish; and that very night, Strap being a little elevated with the regard that had been shown to Strap, and to me on Strap account, ventured to tell me, that Strap had a sneaking kindness for Miss Williams, and that if Strap lady and I would use We interest in Strap behalf, Strap did not doubt that Miss Williams would listen to Strap addresses. Surprised at this proposal, I asked if Strap knew the story of that unfortunate young gentlewoman: Upon which, Strap replied, "Yes, yes, I know what you mean -- Miss Williams has been unhappy, I grant you -- but what of that? I am convinced of Miss Williams reformation; or else you and my good lady would not treat Miss Williams with such respect. -- As for the censure of the world, I value the censure of the world not a fig's end -- besides, the world knows nothing of the matter." I commended his philosophy, and interested Narcissa in his cause; who interceded so effectually, that in a little time, Miss Williams, yielded Miss Williams consent, and they were married with the approbation of Don Rodriguez, who gave his five hundred pounds to stock a farm, and made his overseer of his estate. My generous bedfellow gave My generous bedfellow maid the same sum; so that they live in great peace and plenty within half a mile of us, and daily put up prayers for us preservation.  If there be such a thing as true happiness on earth, I enjoy it. -- The impetuous transports of my passion are now settled and mellowed into endearing fondness and tranquillity of love, rooted by that intimate connection and interchange of hearts, which naught but virtuous wedlock can produce. -- Fortune seems determined to make ample amends for Fortune former cruelty; for my proctor writes, that notwithstanding the clause in my father-in-law's will, on which the Squire founds the Squire claim, I shall certainly ^over my wife's fortune, in consequence of a codicil annexed, which explains that clause, and limits my wife restriction to the age of nineteen, after which my wife was at my wife own disposal. -- I would have set out for London immediately after receiving this piece of intelligence, but my dear angel has been qualmish of late, and begins to grow remarkably round in the waist; so that I cannot leave my wife in such an interesting situation, which I hope will produce something to crown my felicity.
