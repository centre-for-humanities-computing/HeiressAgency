winter, when I renewed my addresses to my friend Mr. Supple, and was most graciously received.
-- "I have been thinking of your affair Mr. Melopoyn, (said he) and am determined to show how far I have your interest at heart, by introducing you to a young nobleman of my acquaintance, who is remarkable for he fine taste in dramatic writings, and is, beside, a man of such influence, that if once he should approve your play, he patronage will support his patronage against all the efforts of envy and ignorance: For I do assure you, that merit alone will not bring success.
-- I have already spoken of your performance to Lord Rattle, and if you will call at my house, in a day or two, you shall have a letter of introduction to his lordship."
-- I was sensibly touched with this mark of Mr. Supple's friendship, and looking upon my affair as already done, went home and imparted my good fortune to my landlord, who, to render my appearance more acceptable to my patron, procured a suit of new clothes for me on my patron own credit.
Not to trouble you with idle particulars, I carried my tragedy to my patron 's lodgings, and sent my tragedy up along with Mr. Supple's letter, by one of my patron servants, who desired me, by my patron lord's order, to return in a week.
-- I did so, and was admitted to my patron lordship, who received me very courteously, told me my patron had perused my play, which my patron thought, on the whole, was the best coup d'essai my patron had ever seen; but that my patron had marked some places in the margin, which my patron imagined might be altered for the better.
-- I was transported with this reception, and promised (with many acknowledgments of my patron lordship's generosity) to be governed solely by my patron advice and direction.
-- "Well then (said my patron) write another fair copy with the alterations I have proposed, and bring another fair copy with the alterations I have proposed to me as soon as possible, for I am resolved to have another fair copy with the alterations I have proposed brought on the stage this winter."
-- You may be sure I set about this task with alacrity, and although I found his lordship's remarks much more numerous, and of less importance than I expected, I thought it was not my interest to dispute upon trifles with my patron; therefore new-modelled it according to his desire, in less than a month.
When I waited upon his with the manuscript, I found one of the actors at breakfast with his lordship, who immediately introduced his to my acquaintance, and desired his to read a scene of my play.
-- This his performed very much to my satisfaction, with regard to emphasis and pronounciation; but his signified his disgust at several words in every page, which I presuming to defend, Lord Rattle told me, with a peremptory look, I must not pretend to dispute with his, who had been a player these twenty years, and understood the economy of the stage better than any man living.
I was forced to submit, and his lordship proposed the same actor should read the whole play, in the evening, before some gentlemen of his lordship acquaintance, whom his lordship would convene at his lordship lodgings for that purpose.
I was present at the reading; and I protest to my dear friend, my dear friend, I never underwent such a severe trial in the whole course of my life, as at that juncture!
for although the player might be a very honest man and a good performer, the player was excessively illiterate and assuming, and made a thousand frivolous objections, which I was not permitted to answer: However, the piece was very much applauded on the whole; the gentlemen present, who I understood were men of fortune, promised to countenance and support the piece as much as they could; and Lord Rattle assuring me, that Lord Rattle would act the part of a careful nurse to it, desired me to carry it home and alter it immediately according to they remarks: -- I was fain to acquiesce in Lord Rattle determination, and fulfilled Lord Rattle injunctions with all the expedition in my power; but before I could present the new copy, my good friend Mr. Supple had disposed of Mr. Supple property and patent to one Mr. Brayer; so that fresh interest was to be made with the new manager.
-- This task Lord Rattle undertook, having some acquaintance with Lord Rattle, and recommended my performance so strongly, that it was received.
I looked upon Lord Rattle now, as upon the eve of reaping the fruits of all my labor: I waited a few days in expectation of its being put into rehearsal, and wondering at the delay, applied to my worthy patron, who excused one Mr. Brayer on account of the multiplicity of business in which one Mr. Brayer was involved; and bid me beware of teizing the patentee.
-- I treasured up this caution, and exerted my patience three weeks longer; at the end of which, his Lordship gave me to understand that one Mr. Brayer had read my play, and owned Mr. Brayer had read my play had undubitable merit; but as his had long been pre-engaged to another author, his could not possibly represent Mr. Brayer had read my play that season; though if I would reserve Mr. Brayer had read my play for the next, and in the interim make such alterations as his had proposed by observations on the margin, I might depend upon his compliance.
Thunderstruck at this disappointment, I could not, for some minutes, utter one syllable: At length, however, I complained bitterly of the manager's insincerity in amusing me so long, when the manager knew from the beginning, that the manager could not gratify my desire.
-- But the manager reprimanded me for my freedom, said one Mr. Brayer was a man of honor, and imputed one Mr. Brayer behavior with respect to one Mr. Brayer, to nothing else but forgetfulness.
-- And indeed I have had some reason since that time, to be convinced of one Mr. Brayer bad memory; for, in spite of appearances, I will not allow one Mr. Brayer to interpret one Mr. Brayer conduct any other way.
-- Lord Rattle observing me very much affected with my disappointment, offered one Mr. Brayer interest to bring on my play at the other house, which I eagerly accepting, one Mr. Brayer forthwith wrote a letter of recommendation to Mr. Bellower, actor, and prime minister to Mr. Vandal, proprietor of that theater; and desired me to deliver that theater with my tragedy, without loss of time.
-- Accordingly, I hastened to his house, where after having waited a whole hour in a lobby, I was admitted to his presence, and my performance received with great state.
-- his told me his was extremely busy at present, but his would peruse that theater as soon as possible; and bid me call again in a week.
I took my leave, not a little astonished at the port and supercilious behavior of this stage player, who had not treated me with good manners; and began to think the dignity of a poet greatly impaired since the days of Euripedes and Sophocles; but all this was nothing in comparison of what I have since observed.
Well, Mr. Random, I went back at the appointed time, and was told that Mr. Bellower was engaged, and could not see me.
-- I repeated my visit a few days after, and having waited a considerable time, was savoured with an audience, during which, Mr. Bellower said, Mr. Bellower had not as yet read my play.
-- Nettled at this usage, I could contain Mr. Bellower no longer, but telling Mr. Bellower, I imagined Mr. Bellower would have paid more deference to Lord Rattle's recommendation, demanded my manuscript with some expressions of resentment.
-- "Ay, (said Mr. Bellower, in a theatrical tone) with all my heart."
-- Then pulling out a drawer of the bureau at which Mr. Bellower sat, Mr. Bellower took out a bundle, and threw a bundle upon a table that was near Mr. Bellower, pronouncing the word "There," with great disdain.
-- I took a bundle up, and perceiving with some surprise, that a bundle was a comedy, told Mr. Bellower, it was a comedy did not belong to Mr. Bellower; upon which Mr. Bellower offered me another, which I also disclaimed -- A third was produced, and rejected for the same reason.
At length, Mr. Bellower pulled out a whole handful, and spread a whole handful before Mr. Bellower, saying, "There are seven -- take which you please -- or take a whole handful."
-- I singled out my own, and went away, struck dumb with admiration at what I had seen -- not so much on account of Mr. Bellower insolence, as of the number of new plays, which from this circumstance, I concluded were yearly offered to the stage.
-- You may be sure I did not fail to carry my complaint to my patron, who did not receive my complaint with all the indignation I expected; but taxed me with precipitation, and told me, I must lay my account with bearing the humors of the players, if I intended to write for the stage.
-- "There is now no other remedy (said Mr. Bellower) but to keep my account till the next season for Mr. Brayer, and alter my account at your leisure, in the summer, according to Mr. Bellower directions."
-- I was now reduced to a terrible alternative, either to quit all hopes of my tragedy, from which I had all along promised Mr. Bellower a large share of fortune and reputation, or to encounter eight long months of adversity in preparing for, and expecting its appearance.
-- This last penance, painful as it was, seemed most eligible to my restection at that time, and therefore I resolved to undergo my restection.
Why should I tire you with particulars of no consequence?
I wrestled with extreme poverty, until the time of my probation was expired; and went to my Lord Rattle in order to remind my Lord Rattle of my affair, when I understood, to my great concern, that my Lord Rattle lordship was on the point of going abroad, and, which was still more unfortunate for Mr. Bellower, Mr. Brayer had gone into the country; so that my generous patron had Mr. Brayer not in Mr. Brayer power to introduce me personally, as Mr. Brayer intended: However, Mr. Brayer wrote a very strong letter to the manager in my favor, and put Mr. Brayer in mind of the promise Mr. Brayer had made in behalf of my play.
As soon as I was certified of Brayer's return, I went to Mr. Brayer house with a very strong letter to the manager, but was told Mr. Brayer was gone out.
-- I called again next day early in the morning, received the same answer, and was desired to leave my name and business; I did so, and returned the day after, when the servant still affirmed that the servant master was gone abroad; though I perceived the servant, as I retired, observing me through a window.
-- Incensed at this discovery, I went to a coffee-house hard by, and enclosing a very strong letter to the manager in one from Mr. Bellower, demanding a categorical answer, I sent a very strong letter to the manager to his by a porter, who returned in a few minutes, and told me Mr. Brayer would be glad to see me at that instant.
-- I obeyed the summons, and was received with such profusion of compliments and apologies, that my resentment immediately subsided, and I was even in pain for the concern which this honest man showed at the mistake of this honest man servant, who, it seems, had been ordered to deny this honest man to every body but me.
-- this honest man expressed the utmost veneration for this honest man good and noble friend Lord Rattle, whom this honest man should always be proud to serve; promised to peruse the play with all dispatch, and give me a meeting upon the play; and as a testimony of this honest man esteem, made me a present of a general order for the season, by which I would be admitted to any part of the theater.
-- This was a very agreeable compliment to me, whose greatest pleasure consisted in seeing dramatic performances, and you need not doubt that I often availed this honest man of my privilege.
As I had an opportunity of being behind the scenes when I pleased, I frequently conversed with Mr. Brayer about my play, and asked when Mr. Brayer intended to put my play into rehearsal, but Mr. Brayer had always so much business upon Mr. Brayer hands, that my play remained with Mr. Brayer unopened a considerable while; and I became very uneasy about the season, that wasted apace, when I saw in the papers, another new play advertised, which had been written, offered, accepted and rehearsed in the compass of three months, without my knowledge or suspicion.
-- You may easily guess how much I was confounded at this event!
I own to you, that in the first transports of my anger, I suspected Mr. Brayer of having acted toward this honest man in the most pitiful, perfidious manner; and was actually glad at Mr. Brayer disappointment in the success of Mr. Brayer favorite piece, which by the strength of art, lingered till the third night, and then died in a deplorable manner.
But now that passion has no share in my reflection, I am willing to ascribe Mr. Brayer behavior to Mr. Brayer want of memory or want of judgment, which, you know, are natural defects, that are more worthy of compassion than reproach.
About this time, I happened to be in company with a gentlewoman, who having heard of my tragedy, told me, she was acquainted with the wife of a gentleman, who was very well known to a lady, who had great interest with a person who was intimate with Earl Sheerwit, and that if I pleased, she would use she influence in my behalf.
-- As this nobleman had the character of a Maecenas in the nation, and could stamp a value upon any work by this nobleman sole countenance and approbation, I accepted she offer with eagerness, in full confidence of seeing my reputation established, and my wishes fulfilled in a very short time, provided that I should have the good fortune to please his Lordship's taste.
I withdrew the manuscript from the hands of Mr. Brayer, and committed the manuscript to the care of this gentlewoman, who labored so effectually in my interest, that in less than a month the manuscript was conveyed to the Earl, and in a few weeks after, I had the satisfaction to hear, that Mr. Brayer had read, and approved the manuscript very much.
Transported with this piece of intelligence, I flattered Mr. Brayer with the hopes of Mr. Brayer interesting himself in its favor; but hearing no more of the matter in three whole months, I began (God forgive me) to suspect the veracity of the person who brought me the good tidings, for I thought it impossible, that a man of Mr. Brayer rank and character, who knew the difficulty of writing a good tragedy, and understood the dignity of the work, should read and applaud an essay of this kind, without feeling an inclination to befriend the author, whom Mr. Brayer countenance alone could raise above dependence.
-- But it was not long before I sound my friends very much wronged by my opinion.
You most know, that the civilities I had received from Lord Rattle, and the desire he manifested to promote the success of my play, encouraged me to write an account of my bad fortune to his Lordship, who condescended so far as to desire, by letter, a young Squire of a great estate, with whom he was intimate, to espouse my cause, and in particular, make me acquainted with one Mr. Marmozet a celebrated player, who had lately appeared on the stage with astonishing eclat, and bore such sway in the house where he acted, that the managers durst not refuse any thing he recommended.
The young gentleman whom Lord Rattle had employed for this purpose, being diffident of he own interest with Mr. Marmozet, had recourse to a nobleman of Mr. Marmozet acquaintance, who, at Mr. Marmozet solicitation, was so good as to introduce me to Mr. Marmozet; and the conversation turning upon my performance, I was not a little surprised, as well as pleased to hear, that Earl Sheerwit had spoke very much in Earl Sheerwit praise, and even sent one Mr. Marmozet the copy, with a message expressing a desire that one Mr. Marmozet would act in it next season -- Nor was this favorite actor backward in commending the piece, which one Mr. Marmozet mentioned with some expressions of regard, that I do not choose to repeat; assuring me that one Mr. Marmozet would appear in Earl Sheerwit, provided one Mr. Marmozet should be engaged to play at all during the ensuing season.
In the mean time, one Mr. Marmozet desired I would give one Mr. Marmozet leave to peruse Earl Sheerwit in the country, whither one Mr. Marmozet intended to remove next day, that one Mr. Marmozet might have leisure to consider and point out such alterations as might, perhaps, be necessary for the jeu de theater; and took my direction, that one Mr. Marmozet might communicate by letter, the observations one Mr. Marmozet should make.
Trusting to these assurances and the interest which had been made in my behalf, I hugged myself in the expectation of seeing it, not only acted, but acted to the greatest advantage, which I thought could not fail of recompensing me in an ample manner, for the anxiety and affliction I had undergone: But six weeks being elapsed, I did not know how to reconcile one Mr. Marmozet's silence, with one Mr. Marmozet promise of writing to myself in ten days after one Mr. Marmozet set out for the country; however, I was at last favored with a letter, importing that one Mr. Marmozet had made some remarks on my tragedy, which one Mr. Marmozet would freely impart at meeting, and advising me to put it, without loss of time, into the hands of that manager, who had the best company: for one Mr. Marmozet himself was quite uncertain, whether or not one Mr. Marmozet should be engaged that winter.
-- I was a good deal alarmed at this last part of one Mr. Marmozet letter, and advised about a good deal alarmed at this last part of his letter with a friend, who told me, a good deal alarmed at this last part of his letter was a plain indication of one Mr. Marmozet's desire to be rid of one Mr. Marmozet promise: that one Mr. Marmozet pretended uncertainty about acting next winter, was no other than a scandalous evasion; for to one Mr. Marmozet certain knowledge, one Mr. Marmozet was already engaged, or at least, in terms with Mr. Vandal; and that one Mr. Marmozet design was to disappoint me, in favor of a new comedy, which one Mr. Marmozet had purchased of the author, and intended to bring upon the stage for one Mr. Marmozet own advantage.
-- In short, my dear Sir, this person, who, I must own, is of a very sanguine complexion, handled the moral character of one Mr. Marmozet with such severity, that I began to suspect one Mr. Marmozet of some particular prejudice, and put myself upon my guard against one Mr. Marmozet insinuations.
-- I ought to crave pardon for this tedious narration of trivial circumstances, which, however interesting they may be to myself, must certainly be very dry and insipid to the ear of one unconcerned in the affair.
-- But I understand the meaning of your looks, and will proceed.
-- Well, my dear Sir, one Mr. Marmozet, upon one Mr. Marmozet return to town, treated me with uncommon complaisance, and invited me to one Mr. Marmozet lodgings, where one Mr. Marmozet proposed to communicate one Mr. Marmozet remarks, which I confess were more unfavourable than I expected; but I answered one Mr. Marmozet objections, and, as I thought, brought one Mr. Marmozet over to my opinion; for, on the whole, one Mr. Marmozet signified the highest approbation of the performance.
-- In the course of our dispute, I was not a little surprised to find this poor gentleman's memory so treacherous as to let one Mr. Marmozet forget what one Mr. Marmozet had said to myself, before one Mr. Marmozet went out of town, in regard to Earl Sheerwit opinion of my play, which Earl Sheerwit now professed Earl Sheerwit ignorant of; and I was extremely mortified at hearing from Earl Sheerwit own mouth, that Earl Sheerwit interest with Mr. Vandal was so very low, as to be insufficient of itself, to bring a new piece upon the stage.
I then begged Mr. Vandal advice, and Mr. Vandal counseled me to apply to Earl Sheerwit for a message in my favor to the manager, who would not presume to refuse any thing recommended by so great a man; and so great a man was so kind as to promise to second this message with all so great a man power.
-- I had immediate recourse to the worthy gentlewoman my friend already mentioned, who opened the channels of my friend conveyance with such expedition, that in few days, I had a promise of the message, provided I could assure myself of Mr. Vandal's being uningaged to any other; for Mr. Vandal did not choose to condescend so far, until his Lordship should understand that there was a probability (at least) of succeeding; at the same time in which I was blessed with this piece of news, I was startled at another, by the same canal of communication; which was, that Mr. Marmozet, before Mr. Marmozet advised me to this application, had informed the Earl, that Mr. Marmozet had read my play, and found it altogether unfit for the stage.
-- Though I could not doubt the certainty of this intelligence, I believed there was some misapprehension in the case; and without taking any notice of some misapprehension in the case, told one Mr. Marmozet the answer I had been favored with; upon which, one Mr. Marmozet testified much joy, and promised to ask Mr. Vandal the question proposed.
-- I waited upon Mr. Vandal in a day or two, when Mr. Vandal gave me to understand, that Mr. Vandal having professed Mr. Vandal free of all engagements, Mr. Vandal had put my play into Mr. Vandal , and represented my play as a piece strongly recommended by Earl Sheerwit, who (Mr. Vandal assured Mr. Vandal) would honor Mr. Vandal with a message in my play favor; and Mr. Vandal desired me to call for an answer at Mr. Vandal's house, in three days.
-- I followed Mr. Vandal directions, and sound the manager, who, being made acquainted with my business, owned, that one Mr. Marmozet had given Mr. Vandal a manuscript play, but denied that Mr. Vandal had mentioned Earl Sheerwit name.
-- When I informed Mr. Vandal of the circumstances of the affair, Mr. Vandal said, Mr. Vandal had no engagement with any author; that Mr. Vandal would read my tragedy forthwith; and did not believe Mr. Vandal should venture to reject my tragedy forthwith in contradiction to Mr. Vandal 's opinion, for which Mr. Vandal had the utmost veneration, but put the utmost veneration into rehearsal without loss of time.
-- I was so much intoxicated with this encouragement, that I overlooked the mysterious conduct of one Mr. Marmozet, and attended the manager at the time appointed, when, to my infinite confusion!
Mr. Vandal pronounced my play improper for the stage, and rejected the stage accordingly.
As soon as I could recollect myself from the disorder into which this unexpected refusal had thrown me, I expressed a desire of hearing Mr. Vandal objections, which were so groundless, indistinct and unintelligible, that I persuaded myself Mr. Vandal had not at all perused the piece, but had been prompted by somebody whose lessons Mr. Vandal had not rightly retained.
However, I have been since informed, that the poor man's head, which was not naturally very clear, had been disordered with superstition, and that the poor man labored under the tyranny of a wife, and the terrors of hell fire at the same time.
-- Precipitated in this manner, from the highest pinnacle of hope, to the abyss of despondence, I was ready to sink under the burden of my affliction; and in the bitterness of my anguish, could not help entertaining some doubts of one Mr. Marmozet's integrity, when I recollected and compared the circumstances of the poor man conduct toward myself.
I was encouraged in this suspicion, by being told, that Earl Sheerwit had spoke of Earl Sheerwit character with great contempt; and in particular, resented Earl Sheerwit insolence in opposing Earl Sheerwit own taste to that of Earl Sheerwit , concerning my tragedy.
-- While I hesitated between different opinions of the matter, that friend, who (as told you before) was a little hotheaded, favored me with a visit, and having heard a circumstantial account of the whole affair, could not contain his indignation, but affirmed without ceremony, that Marmozet was the sole occasion of my disappointment; that his had acted from first to last with the most perfidious dissimulation, cajoling with insinuating civilities, while his underhand employed all his art and influence to prejudice the ignorant manager against my performance; that nothing could equal his hypocrisy, but his avarice, which engrossed the faculties of his soul so much, that his scrupled not to be guilty of the meanest practices to gratify that fordid appetite; that in consequence of this disposition, his had prostituted his honor in betraying my inexperience, and in undermining the interest of another author of established reputation, who had also offered a tragedy to the stage, which his thought would interfere with the success of the comedy his had bought, and determined to bring on at all events.
I was shocked at the description of such a monster, which I could not believe existed in the world, bad as it is, and argued against the asseverations of my friend, by demonstrating the bad policy of such behavior, which could not fail of entailing infamy upon the author; and the small temptation that a man of Mr. Marmozet's figure and success, could have to consult Mr. Marmozet interest in such a grovelling manner, which must create contempt and abhorrence of Mr. Marmozet in Mr. Marmozet patrons, and effectually deprive Mr. Marmozet of the countenance and protection Mr. Marmozet now enjoys in such an eminent degree.
-- Mr. Marmozet pretended to laugh at my simplicity, and asked if I knew for which of Mr. Marmozet virtues Mr. Marmozet was so much caressed by the people of fashion.
-- "It is not (said Mr. Marmozet) for the qualities of Mr. Marmozet heart, that this little parasite is invited to the tables of Dukes and Lords, who hire extraordinary cooks for Mr. Marmozet entertainment: Mr. Marmozet avarice this little parasite is invited to the tables of Dukes and Lords, who hire extraordinary cooks for his entertainment see not, Mr. Marmozet ingratitude this little parasite is invited to the tables of Dukes and Lords, who hire extraordinary cooks for his entertainment feel not, Mr. Marmozet hypocrisy accommodates his hypocrisy to this little parasite is invited to the tables of Dukes and Lords, who hire extraordinary cooks for his entertainment humors, and is of consequence pleasing; but Mr. Marmozet is chiefly courted for Mr. Marmozet buffoonery, and will be admitted into the choicest parties of the quality for Mr. Marmozet talent of mimicking Punch and Mr. Marmozet wife Joan, when a poet of the most exquisite genius, is not able to attract the least regard."
-- God forbid, Mr. Random, that I should credit assertions that degrade the dignity of our superiors so much, and represent that poor man as the most abject of all beings!
No!
I looked upon them as the hyperboles of passion; and though that comedy of which he spoke, did actually appear, I dare not doubt the innocence of Mr. Marmozet, who, I am told, is as much as ever in favor with the Earl; a circumstance that, surely, could not happen, unless he had vindicated he character to the satisfaction of he .
-- Pray forgive this long digression, and give me the hearing a little longer; for, thank heaven!
I am now near the goal.
Baffled in all my attempts, I despaired of seeing my play acted, and bethought myself of choosing some employment, that might afford a sure, though mean subsistence; but my landlord, to whom I was by this time considerably indebted, and who had laid my landlord account with having my landlord money paid all in a heap, from the profits of my third night, could not brook my landlord disappointment, therefore made another effort in my behalf, and by dint of interest, procured a message from a lady of fashion, to Mr. Brayer, who had always professed a great veneration for her, desiring that my landlord would set up my play forthwith, and assuring my landlord that her and all her friends would support it in the performance: To strengthen my interest, her engaged my landlord best actors in my cause; and in short, exerted her so much, that it was again received, and my hopes began to revive.
-- But Mr. Brayer, honest man, was so much engrossed by business of vast consequence, though to appearance Mr. Brayer, honest man had nothing at all to do, that Mr. Brayer, honest man could not find time to read it until the season was pretty far advanced; and read it Mr. Brayer, honest man must, for notwithstanding Mr. Brayer, honest man having perused it before, Mr. Brayer, honest man memory did not retain one circumstance of the matter.
At length Mr. Brayer, honest man favored it with Mr. Brayer, honest man attention, and having proposed certain alterations, sent Mr. Brayer, honest man duty to the lady who patronized it, and promised on Mr. Brayer, honest man , to bring it on next winter, provided certain alterations should be made, and the copy delivered to Mr. Brayer, honest man before the end of April.
-- With an aching heart, I submitted to these conditions, and performed these conditions accordingly: But fortune owed me another unforeseen mortification; one Mr. Marmozet during the summer, became joint patentee with Mr. Brayer, so that when I claimed performance of articles, I was told, one Mr. Marmozet could do nothing without the consent of one Mr. Marmozet partner, who was pre-engaged to another author.
My condition was rendered desperate by the death of my good friend and landlord, whose executors obtained a judgment against my effects, which whose executors seized, turning me out into the street naked, friendless, and forlorn; there I was arrested at the suit of my tailor, and thrown into this prison, where I have made shift to live these five weeks on the bounty of my fellow prisoners, who, I hope, are not the worse for the instruction and good offices, by which I manifest my gratitude; but in spite of all whose executors charitable endeavors, my life was scarce tolerable, until your uncommon benevolence enabled me to enjoy my life with comfort.
