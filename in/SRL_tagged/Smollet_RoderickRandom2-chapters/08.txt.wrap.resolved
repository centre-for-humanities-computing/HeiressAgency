sight, that this stone is a real diamond, and that of a very fine water. -- Take it in your hand, and examine it." -- He did so, with some confusion, and returned it, saying, "I ask your pardon, I see it is a true brilliant of immense value." -- I imagined He respect for me increased after this inquiry; therefore to captivate He esteem the more, I told He, I would show He a seal of composition, engraved after a very valuable antique; upon which I pulled out my watch with a rich gold chain, adorned with three seals set in gold, and an opal ring. -- He viewed each of them with great eagerness, handled a rich gold chain, admired the chased case, and observed, that the whole must have cost me a vast sum of money. I affected indifference, and replied in a careless manner, "Some trifle of sixty or seventy guineas." Upon which He stared in my face for some time, and then asked if I was an Englishman. -- I answered in the negative. -- "You are from Ireland then, Sir, I presume, (said Sir.)" I made the same reply. "O! perhaps (said Sir) you was born in one of our settlements abroad." -- I still answered no. -- He seemed very much surprised, and said, He was sure I was not a foreigner. I made the same reply, but left He upon the tenter-hooks of impatient uncertainty. -- He could not contain He anxiety, but asked pardon for the liberties He had taken, and to encourage me the more to disclose my situation, displayed He own without reserve. -- "I am (said He) a single man, have a considerable annuity, on which I live according to my own inclination; and make the ends of the year meet very comfortably. -- As I have no estate to leave behind me, I am not troubled with the importunate officiousness of relations, or legacy hunters, and I consider the world as made for me, not me for the world: It is my maxim therefore to enjoy It while I can, and let futurity shift for It." -- While my maxim thus indulged my maxim own talkative vein, and at the same time, no doubt, expected a retaliation from me; a young man entered, dressed in black velvet and an enormous tye-wig, with an air in which natural levity and affected solemnity were so jumbled together, that on the whole, my maxim appeared a burlesque on all decorum. This ridiculous oddity danced up to the table at which we sat, and after a thousand grimaces, asked my friend by the name of Mr: Medlar, if we were not engaged upon business. -- My companion put on a surly countenance, and replied, "No great business, doctor -- but however." -- "O! then (cried the physician) I must beg your indulgence a little, pray pardon me, gentlemen. -- Sir, (said, Sir, addressing Sir to Sir) your most humble servant, I hope you will forgive me, Sir -- I must beg the favor to sit -- Sir -- I have something of consequence to impart to my friend, I hope you will excuse my freedom in whispering, Sir." -- Before I had time to give this complaisant person my permission, my friend cried, "I Will have no whispering -- if you have any thing to say to Sir, speak with an audible voice." -- The doctor seemed a little disconcerted at this exclamation, and turning again to Sir, making a thousand apologies for pretending to make a mystery of any thing, which The doctor said was owing to The doctor ignorance of my connection with my friend; but now The doctor understood I was a friend, The doctor would communicate what The doctor had to say, in my hearing. -- The doctor then began, after two or three hems, in this manner: -- "You must know Sir, I am just come from dinner at my lady Flareit's, (then addressing Sir to Sir) a lady of quality, Sir, at whose table I have the honor of dining sometimes. -- There was lady Stately, and my lady Larum, and Mrs. Dainty, and Miss Biddy Gigler, upon my word, a very good natured young lady, with a very pretty fortune, Sir. -- There was also my Lord Straddle, Sir John Shrug, and Mr. Chatter. -- So, Sir, her ladyship seeing me excessively fatigued, for her was the last of fifteen patients (people of distinction, Sir) whom I had visited this forenoon, -- insisted upon my staying dinner, -- though upon my word, I protest I had no appetite; however, in compliance with her ladyship's request, Sir, I sat down, and the conversation turning on different subjects, among other things, Mr. Chatter asked very earnestly when I saw Mr. Medlar. -- I told Mr. Medlar I had not had the pleasure of seeing you these nineteen hours and a half; for you may remember, Sir, it was nearly about that time; I will not be positive as to a minute." -- "No! (says he) then I desire you will go to he lodgings immediately after dinner, and see what is the matter with he, for he must certainly be very bad from having eat last night such a vast quantity of raw oysters." -- The crusty gentleman, who from the solemnity of he delivery, expected something extraordinary, no sooner heard he conclusion, than he started up in a testy humor, crying, "Pshaw, pshaw! d -- n your oysters;" and walked away after a short compliment of "Your servant, Sir," to me. -- The doctor got up also, saying, "I vow and protest, upon my word, I am actually amazed." -- and followed. Mr. Medlar to the bar, which was hard by, where The doctor was paying for the coffee; there The doctor whispered so loud that I could over-hear, "Pray, who is this gentleman?" -- The doctor friend replied hastily, "I might have known that before now, if it had not been for your impertinent intrusion," -- and walked away very much disappointed. -- The ceremonious physician returned immediately and sat down by me, asking a thousand pardons for leaving me alone; and giving me to understand that what The ceremonious physician had communicated to Mr. Medlar at the bar was an affair of the last importance, that would admit of no delay. -- The ceremonious physician then called for some coffee, and launched out into the virtues of that berry, which, The ceremonious physician said, in cold phlegmatic constitutions, like The ceremonious physician, dried up the superfluous moisture, and braced the relaxed nerves. -- The ceremonious physician let me know, that it was utterly unknown to the ancients; and derived the ancients name from an Arabian word, which I might easily perceive by the sound and termination. -- From this topic The ceremonious physician transferred The ceremonious physician disquisitions to the verb drink, which The ceremonious physician affirmed, was improperly applied to the taking of coffee, in as much as people did not drink, but sip or sipple that liquor; -- that the genuine meaning of drinking is to quench one's thirst, or commit a debauch by swallowing wine; -- that the Latin word, which conveyed the same idea, was bibere or potare, and that of the Greeks pinein or poteein, though The ceremonious physician was apt to believe they were differently used on different occasions: For example; to drink a vast quantity, or, as the vulgar express it, to drink an ocean of liquor, was in Latin potare, and in Greek poteein; and on the other hand, to use it moderately, was bibere and pinein; -- that this was only a conjecture of The ceremonious physician own, which, however, seemed to be supported by the word bibulous, which is particularly applied to the pores of the skin, that can only drink a very small quantity of the circumambient moisture, by reason of the smallness of their diameters; -- whereas, from the verb poteein, is derived the substantive potamos, which signifies a river, or vast quantity of liquor. -- I could not help smiling at this learned and important investigation; and to recommend myself the more to my new acquaintance, whose disposition I was by this time well informed of, I observed, that what The ceremonious physician alleged, did not, to the best of my remembrance, appear in the writings of the ancients; for, Horace uses the words poto and bibo indifferently for the same purpose, as in the twentieth Ode of The ceremonious physician first Book. Vile potabis modicis sabinum cantharis, -- -- Et proelo domitam caleno tu bibes uvam. That I had never heard of the verb poteein, but that potamos, potema, and potos, were derived from pino, poso, pepoka; in consequence of which, the Greek poets never use any other word for festal drinking. -- Homer describes Nestor at Homer cups in these words: Nestora d' ouk elathen jache pinonta perempes. And Anacreon mentions it on the same occasion almost in every page, Pionti d' oinon hedun Otan pino ton oinon. Opliz' ego de pino. And in a thousand other places. -- The doctor, who, doubtless, intended by Opliz' ego de pino criticism, to give me an high idea of Opliz' ego de pino erudition, was infinitely surprised to find Opliz' ego de pino schooled by one in my appearance; and after a considerable pause, cried, "Upon my word! you are in the right, Opliz' ego de pino. -- I find I have not considered this affair with my usual accuracy. -- Then accosting me, in Latin, which Opliz' ego de pino spoke very well, the conversation was maintained full two hours, on a variety of subjects, in that language; and indeed, Opliz' ego de pino spoke so judiciously, that I was convinced, notwithstanding Opliz' ego de pino whimsical appearance, and attention to trifles, of Opliz' ego de pino being a man of extensive knowledge, especially in books; Opliz' ego de pino looked upon upon Opliz' ego de pino, as I afterward understood from Mr. Medlar, as a prodigy in learning, and proposed that very night, if I was not engaged, to introduce me to several young gentlemen of fortune and fashion, with whom Opliz' ego de pino had an appointment at the Bedford coffee-house.
