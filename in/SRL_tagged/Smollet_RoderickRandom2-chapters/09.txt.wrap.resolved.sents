where I saw a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most of whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity.
Among the rest, stood a groupe of a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most of whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity around the fire, whom I immediately knew to be the very persons who had the night before, by a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most of whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity laughing, alarmed my suspicion of the lady who had put herself under my protection.
-- a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most of whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity no sooner perceived me enter with Dr. Wagtail (for that was my companion's name) than a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most of whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity tittered and whispered one to another; and I was not a little surprised to find that a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most of whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity were the gentlemen to whose acquaintance whose acquaintance designed to recommend me; for when whose acquaintance observed a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most of whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity together, whose acquaintance told me who a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most of whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity were, and desired to know by what name whose acquaintance should introduce me.
I satisfied whose acquaintance in that particular, and whose acquaintance advanced with great gravity, saying, "Gentlemen, your most obedient -- give me leave to introduce my friend Mr. Random, to your society."
Then turning to Sir, "Mr. Random, this is Mr. Bragwell -- Mr. Banter, Sir -- Mr. Chatter -- my friend Mr. Slyboot, and Mr. Ranter, Sir."
-- I saluted each of them in order, and when I came to take Mr. Slyboot by the hand, I perceived Mr. Slyboot thrust Mr. Slyboot tongue in Mr. Slyboot cheek, to the no small entertainment of the company; but I did not think proper to take any notice of it, on this occasion.
-- Mr. Ranter too, (who I afterward learned was a player) displayed his talents, by mimicking my air, features and voice, while his returned my compliment: -- This I should not have been so sensible of, had I not seen his behave in the same manner, to my friend Wagtail, when his made up to them at first.
-- But for once I let his enjoy the fruits of his dexterity without question or control, resolved however, to chastize his insolence at a more convenient opportunity.
-- Mr. Slyboot guessing I was a stranger, asked if I had been lately in France; and when I answered in the affirmative, enquired if I had seen the Luxemburg gallery: I told Mr. Slyboot, I had considered it more than once, with great attention: Upon this a conversation ensued, in which I discovered Mr. Slyboot to be a painter.
-- While we were discoursing upon the particular pieces of this famous collection, I overheard Banter ask Dr. Wagtail, where Mr. Slyboot had picked up this Mr. Random.
-- To which question the physician answered, "Upon my word, a mighty pretty sort of a gentleman -- a man of fortune, Sir -- Sir has made the grand tour -- and seen the best company in Europe, Sir."
-- "What, the physician told you so?
I suppose, (said the other) I take the physician to be neither more nor less than a French valet de chamber."
-- "Oh!
barbarous, barbarous!
(cried the doctor) this is actually, upon my word, altogether unaccountable.
-- I know all his family perfectly well, Sir -- his Is of the Randoms in the north -- a very ancient house, Sir, and a distant relation of mine."
-- I was extremely nettled at the conjecture of Mr. Banter, and began to entertain a very indifferent opinion of my company in general; but as I might possibly, by their means, acquire a more extensive and agreeable acquaintance, I determined to bear these little mortifications as long as I could, without injuring the dignity of my character.
-- After having talked for some time on the weather, plays, politics, and other coffee-house subjects, it was proposed that we should spend the evening at a noted tavern in the neighborhood, whither we repaired in a body.
-- Having taken possession of a room, called for French wine, and bespoke supper, the glass went about pretty freely, and the characters of my associates opened upon me more and more.
-- the glass soon appeared that the doctor was entertained as a butt for the painter and player to exercise the painter and player wit upon, for the diversion of my company.
Mr. Ranter began the game, by asking Mr. Ranter what was good for a hoarseness, lowness of spirits and indigestion, Mr. Ranter being troubled with all these complaints to a very great degree.
-- Wagtail immediately undertook to explain the nature of Mr. Ranter case, and in a very prolix manner, harrangued upon prognostics, diagnostics, symptomatics, therapeutics, inanition, and repletion; then calculated the force of the stomach and lungs in the force of the stomach and lungs respective operations; ascribed the player's malady to a disorder in these organs, proceeding from hard drinking and vociferation, and prescribed a course of stomachics, with abstinence from venery, wine, and loud speaking, laughing, singing, coughing, sneezing or hollowing.
-- "Pah, pah, (cried Mr. Ranter, interrupting Mr. Ranter) the remedy is worse than the disease -- I wish I knew where to find some tinder-water."
-- "Tinder-water!
(said the doctor) upon my word I don't apprehend you, Mr.
Ranter."
-- "Water extracted from tinder (replied the other) an universal specific for all distempers incident to man.
-- It was invented by a learned German monk, who, for a valuable consideration, imparted the secret to Paracelsus."
-- "Pardon me (cried the painter) It was first used by Solomon, as appears by a Greek manuscript, in Solomon own handwriting, lately found at the foot of mount Lebanon, by a peasant who was digging for potatoes."
-- "Well, (said Wagtail) in all my vast reading, I never met with such a preparation!
neither did I know till this minute, that Solomon understood Greek, or that potatoes grew in Palestine."
-- Here Banter interposed, saying, Solomon was surprised that doctor Wagtail should make the least doubt of Solomon's understanding Greek, when doctor Wagtail is represented to us as the wisest and best educated prince in the world; and as for potatoes, the wisest and best educated prince in the world were transplanted thither from Ireland, in the time of the Crusades, by some knights of that country.
-- "I profess (said doctor Wagtail) there is nothing more likely -- I would actually give a vast sum for a sight of that manuscript, which must be inestimable -- and if I understood the process, would set about the process immediately."
-- The player assured him, the process was very simple -- that him must cram a hundred weight of dry tinder into a glass retort, and distilling a hundred weight of dry tinder by the force of animal heat, a hundred weight of dry tinder would yield half a scruple of insipid water, one drop of which is a full dose.
-- "Upon my integrity!
(exclaimed the credulous doctor) this is very amazing and extraordinary!
that a caput mortuum shall yield any water at all -- I must own, I have always been an enemy to specifics, which I thought inconsistent with the nature of the animal economy; but certainly the authority of Solomon is not to be questioned.
-- I wonder where I shall find a glass retort large enough to contain such a vast quantity of tinder, the consumption of which must undoubtedly raise the price of paper -- or where shall I find animal heat sufficient, even to warm such a mass."
-- Slyboot informed Slyboot, that Slyboot might have a retort blown for Slyboot as big as a church, and that the easiest method of raising the vapor by animal heat, would be to place it in the middle of an infirmary for feverish patients, who might lie upon matrasses around, and in contact with it.
-- Slyboot had no sooner pronounced these words, than Wagtail exclaimed in a rapture, "An admirable expedient, as I hope to be saved!
I will positively put it in practice."
-- This simplicity of the physician furnished excellent diversion for the company, who in their turns, sneered at Slyboot in ironical compliments, which Slyboot vanity swallowed as the genuine sentiments of their hearts.
-- Mr. Chatter, impatient of so long a silence, now broke out, and entertained us with a catalogue of all the people who danced at the last Hampstead assembly, with a most circumstantial account of the dress and ornaments of each, from the lappets of the ladies to the shoe-buckles of the men; concluding with telling Bragwell, that his mistress Me'linda was there and seemed to miss his; and soliciting his company at the next occasion of that kind.
-- "No, no, damme (said Bragwell) I have something else to mind than dangling after a parcel of giddy-headed girls; -- besides, you know my temper is so unruly, that I am apt to involve myself in scrapes, when a woman is concerned.
-- The last time I was there, I had an affair with Tom Trippet."
-- "O!
I remember that (cried Banter) you lugged out before the ladies; and I commend you for so doing, because you had an opportunity of showing your manhood, without running any risk."
-- "Risk!
(said the other with a fierce countenance) d -- n my blood!
I fear no risks.
-- I a'n't afraid of lugging out against any man that wears a head, damme!
it is well known I have drawn blood more than once, and lost some too; but what does that signify?"
-- The player begged this champion to employ this champion as this champion second the next time this champion intended to kill, for this champion wanted to see a man die of a stab, that this champion might know how to act such a part the more naturally on the stage.
-- "Die!
(replied the hero) No, by G -- d!
I know better things than to incur the verdict of a Middlesex jury -- I should look upon my fencing-master to be an ignorant son of a b -- ch, if my fencing-master had not taught me to prick any part of my antagonist's body, that I please to disable."
-- "Oho!
(cried Slyboot) if that be the case, I have a favor to ask: You must know I am employed to paint a Jesus on the cross; and my purpose is to represent Jesus at that point of time, when the spear is thrust into the spear side.
-- Now I should be glad you would, in my presence, pink some impertinent fellow into convulsions, without endangering some impertinent fellow life, that I may have an opportunity of taking a good clever agony from nature: -- The doctor will direct you where to enter, and how far to go; but pray let it be as near the left side as possible."
-- Wagtail, who took this proposal seriously, observed, that this proposal would be a very difficult matter to penetrate into the left side of the thorax, without hurting the heart, and of consequence killing the patient; but the patient believed it was possible for a man of a very nice hand, and exact knowledge of anatomy, to wound the diaphragma somewhere about the skirts, which might induce a singultus, without being attended with death; -- that the patient was ready to demonstrate the insertion of that muscle to Mr. Bragwell; but desired to have no concern with the experiment, which might essentially prejudice the patient reputation in case of a miscarriage.
-- Mr. Bragwell was as much imposed upon by the painter's waggery as the doctor, and declined engaging in an affair with Tom Trippet, saying, the patient had a very great regard for Mr. Slyboot, but had laid a very great regard for Mr. Slyboot down as a maxim, never to fight except when the patient honor was engaged.
-- A thousand jokes of this kind were passed; the wine circulated, supper was served in, we eat heartily, returned to the bottle, Mr. Bragwell became noisy and troublesome, Banter grew more and more severe, Mr. Ranter rehearsed, Mr. Slyboot made faces at the whole company, I sung French catches, and Chatter kissed me with great affection; while the doctor with a woeful countenance, sat silent like a disciple of Pythagoras.
-- At length, it was proposed by Mr. Bragwell, that we should scour the hundreds, sweat the constable, maul the watch, and then reel soberly to bed.
While we deliberated upon this expedition, the waiter came into the room, and asked for doctor Wagtail; when the waiter understood the waiter was present, the waiter told the waiter, there was a lady below to enquire for the waiter; at which the physician started from the physician melancholy contemplation, and with a look of extreme confusion, assured the whole company, the physician could not possibly be the person wanted, for the physician had no connection with any lady whatever; and bid the drawer tell a lady so.
-- "For shame!
(cried Banter) would you be so impolite as to refuse a lady the hearing?
perhaps a lady comes for a consultation.
-- It must be some extraordinary affair that brings a lady to a tavern at this time o'night.
Mr. Ranter, pray do the doctor's baise-mains to a lady, and squire a lady hither."
-- The player immediately staggered out, and returned, leading in with much ceremony, a tall strapping wench, whose appearance proclaimed a lady condition.
We received a lady with the utmost solemnity, and with a good deal of entreaty a lady was persuaded to sit, when a profound silence ensued, during which a lady fixed a lady eyes, with a disconsolate look, upon the doctor, who was utterly confounded at a lady behavior, and returned a lady melancholy sour-fold; at length, after a good many piteous sighs, a lady wiped her eyes, and accosted him thus: "What!
not one word of comfort?
Will nothing soften that stony heart of thine?
Not all my tears!
not all my affliction!
Not the inevitable ruin thou have brought upon a lady!
Where are thy vows, thou faithless perjured man?
-- Not the inevitable ruin thou?
-- no conscience -- no remorse for thy perfidious conduct toward a lady!
-- answer me, will thou at last do me justice, or must I have recourse to heaven and hell for my revenge!"
-- If doctor Wagtail was amazed before a lady spoke, what must doctor Wagtail confusion be on hearing this address.
doctor Wagtail natural paleness changed into a ghastly clay color, her eyes rolled, doctor Wagtail lip trembled, and doctor Wagtail answered in an accent not to be described; -- "Upon my word, honor, and salvation!
madam, you are actually mistaken in my person, -- I have a most particular veneration for your sex, madam, and am actually incapable of injuring any lady in the smallest degree, madam, -- besides, madam, to the best of my recollection, I never had the honor of seeing you before, as I hope to be saved, madam!"
" -- How, traitor!
(cried she) do thou disown me then?
-- Mistaken!
no, -- too well I know that fair bewitching face!
too well I know that false enchanting tongue!
alas!
gentlemen, since the villain compels me, by the villain unkindness, to expose myself and the villain, know, that this betrayer, under the specious pretense of honorable addresses, won my heart, and taking advantage of the villain conquest, robbed me of my virgin treasure, and afterward abandoned me to my fate!
-- I am now four months gone with child by child, turned out of doors by my relations, and left a prey to misery and want!
Yes, thou Barbarian (said thou Barbarian (, turning to Wagtail) thou tiger, thou Succubus!
too well thou know my situation -- but I will tear out thy faithless heart, and deliver the world from such a monster."
-- So saying, thou Barbarian ( sprung forward at the doctor, who, with incredible agility, jumped over the table and got behind Bragwell, while the rest of us endeavored to appease the furious heroine -- Although every body in the company affected the utmost surprise, I could easily perceive it was a scheme concerted among every body in the company affected the utmost surprise, to produce diversion at the doctor's expense; and being under no concern about the consequence, I entered into the confederacy, and enjoyed the distress of Wagtail, who with tears in his eyes, begged the protection of the company, declaring his as innocent of the crime laid to his charge, as the foetus in utero; and hinting at the same time, that nature had not put that nature in his power to be guilty of such a trespass -- "Nature!
(cried a lady,) there was no nature in the case -- his abused me by the help of charms and spells; else how is it possible, that any woman could have listened to the addresses of such a scarecrow?
-- Were these owlish eyes made for ogling; that carrion complexion to be admired; or that mouth like a horse-shoe to be kissed?
No, no, you owe your success to your philtres, to your drugs and incantations; and not to your natural talents, which are in every respect mean and contemptible" -- The doctor now thought The doctor had got an opportunity of vindicating The doctor effectually; and desired the complainant to compose the complainant but for half an hour, in which The doctor undertook to prove the absurdity of believing in the power of incantations, which were only idle dreams of ignorance and superstition.
-- The doctor accordingly pronounced a very learned discourse upon the nature of ideas, the powers and independance of the mind, the properties of stimulating medicines, the difference between a proneness to venery, which many simples would create, and a passion limited to one object, which can only be the result of sense and reflection; and concluded with a pathetic remonstrance, setting forth The doctor unhappiness of being persecuted with the resentment of a lady whom The doctor had never injured, nor even seen before that occasion, and whose faculties were, in all likelihood, so much impaired by a lady whom he had never injured misfortunes, that an innocent person was in danger of being ruined by a lady whom he had never injured disorder.
-- The doctor had no sooner finished The doctor harrangue, than the forlorn princess began the forlorn princess lamentations afresh, and cautioned the company against The doctor eloquence, which, the forlorn princess said, was able to bias the most impartial bench in christendom.
-- Banter advised The doctor to espouse the forlorn princess immediately, as the only means to salve The doctor reputation, and offered to accompany The doctor to the Fleet for that purpose; but Mr. Slyboot proposed that a father should be purchased for child, and a comfortable alimony settled on the mother.
Mr. Ranter promised to adopt the infant gratis.
Wagtail was ready to worship Wagtail for Wagtail generosity; and though Wagtail persisted in protesting Wagtail innocence, condescended to every thing rather than Wagtail unblemished character should be called in question.
-- a lady rejected the expedient, and insisted on matrimony.
Mr. Bragwell took up the cudgels for the doctor, and undertook to rid Mr. Bragwell of Mr. Bragwell importunity, for half a guinea; upon which Wagtail, with great eagerness, pulled out Mr. Bragwell purse and put his purse into the hand of Mr. Bragwell friend, who taking half a piece out of his purse, gave half a piece to the plaintiff, and bid Mr. Bragwell thank God for Mr. Bragwell good fortune.
When Mr. Bragwell had received this bounty, Mr. Bragwell affected to weep, and begged, since the physician had renounced Mr. Bragwell, the physician would at least vouchsafe Mr. Bragwell a parting kiss; this the physician was prevailed upon to grant, with great reluctance, and went up, with the physician usual solemnity, to salute Mr. Bragwell; Mr. Bragwell laid hold of the physician cheek with Mr. Bragwell teeth and held fast, while the physician roared with anguish, to the unspeakable diversion of all present.
When Mr. Bragwell thought proper to release the physician, Mr. Bragwell dropped a low courtesy to the company, and quitted the room, leaving the doctor in the utmost horror, not so much on account of the pain, as the apprehension of the consequence of the bite; for by this time, the physician was convinced of Mr. Bragwell being mad.
Banter prescribed the actual cautery, and put the poker in the fire to be heated, in order to sear the place.
-- The player was of opinion that Mr. Bragwell should scoop out the part affected with the point of Mr. Bragwell sword; but the painter prevented both these dreadful operations, by recommending a balsam the painter had in the painter pocket, which never failed to cure the bite of a mad dog: With these words, the painter pulled out a small bladder of black paint, with which the painter instantly anointed not only the sore, but the greatest part of the patient's face, and left the greatest part of the patient's face in a frightful condition.
-- In short, the poor creature was so harrassed with fear and vexation, that I pitied the painter extremely, and sent the painter home in a chair, contrary to the inclination of every body present.
This freedom of mine, gave umbrage to Bragwell, who testified his displeasure, by swearing a few threats, without making any application; which was no sooner perceived by Slyboot, who sat by his, than with a view of promoting a quarrel, his whispered to his, that his thought Mr. Bragwell used me very ill; but every man was the best judge of every man own affairs.
-- I answered aloud, that I would neither suffer Mr. Bragwell nor every man to use me ill with impunity; and that I stood in no need of every man counsel in regard to the regulation of my conduct.
-- every man thought proper to ask a thousand pardons, and assure me, every man meant no offense; while Mr. Bragwell feigned every man asleep, that every man might not be obliged to take notice of what passed.
-- But the player, who had more animal spirits, and less prudence than Slyboot, unwilling to let the affair rest, where every man had dropped it, jogged Mr. Bragwell, and told Mr. Bragwell softly, that I called Mr. Bragwell names, and threatened to cudgel Mr. Bragwell.
-- This I understood by Mr. Bragwell starting up and crying, "Blood and wounds!
you lie -- No man durst treat me so ignominiously, -- Mr. Random, did you call me names, and threaten to drub me?"
I denied the imputation, and proposed to punish the scoundrel, who endeavored to foment disturbance in the company; Mr. Bragwell signified Mr. Bragwell approbation, and drew his sword; I did the same, and accosted the actor in these words, "Lookee, Mr. Banter, I know you possess all the mimickry and mischievous qualities of an ape, because I have observed you put them all in practice more than once tonight, on me and others; now I want to see if you resemble one in nimbleness also; therefore I desire you to leap over his sword without hesitation;" so saying, I held his sword parallel to the horizon, at the distance of about three feet from the floor, and called, "Once -- twice -- thrice, and away;" -- but instead of complying with my command, Mr. Bragwell snatched Mr. Bragwell hat and hanger, and assuming the looks, swagger, and phrase of Pistol, burst out in the following exclamation, "Ha!
must I then perform inglorious prank, of Sylvan ape in mountain forest caught!
Death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days, and lay my hand in fury's lap -- Have we not Hiren here?"
-- This buffoonery did not answer This buffoonery expectation, for by this time the company was bent on seeing This buffoonery in a new character.
Mr. Banter desired me to hold his sword a foot or two higher, that Mr. Banter might have the better opportunity of exerting Mr. Banter.
-- the painter told Mr. Banter, if Mr. Banter performed well, Mr. Banter would recommend Mr. Banter as a vaulter to the proprietors of Sadler's Wells; and Mr. Bragwell crying, "Leap for the king," applied the point of the king to the player's posteriors, with such success, that the king sprung over in a trice, and finding the door unguarded, vanished in a twinkling; glad, no doubt, of having paid the king share of the reckoning so easily.
It being now near two a-clock in the morning, we discharged the bill, and sallied out into the street.
-- the painter slunk away without taking the painter leave.
-- Billy Chatter being unable to speak or stand, was sent to a Bagnio; and Banter and I accompanied Mr. Bragwell to Moll King's coffee-house, where after he had kicked half a dozen of hungry whores, we left he asleep on a bench, and directed we course toward Charing Cross, near which place both he and I lodged.
The natural dryness of my companion being overcome by liquor, he honored me by the way with many compliments and professions of friendship, for which I made suitable acknowledgments, and told he, I thought myself happy in having, by my behavior, removed the unfavourable opinion he entertained of myself at first sight.
-- he was surprised at this declaration, and begged me to explain myself: Upon which I mentioned what I had overheard he say of myself to Wagtail, in the coffee-house.
-- he laughed, and made an apology for he , assuring me, that my appearance had very much prepossessed he in my favor; and what he said, was only intended as a joke on the doctor's solemnity.
-- I was highly pleased at being undeceived in this particular, and not a little proud of the good opinion of this wit, who shook me by the hand at parting, and promised to meet me next day at the ordinary.
CHAP.
XLVII.
Strap communicates to myself a conquest he had made on a chandler's widow -- finds he miserably mistaken -- I go to the opera -- admire Melinda -- am cautioned by Banter -- go to the assembly at Hampstead -- dance with that young lady -- receive an insolent message from Bragwell, whose mettle is soon cooled -- am in favor with my mistress, whom I visit next day; and am bubbled out of eighteen guineas at cards -- Strap triumphs at my success, but is astonished at my expense -- Banter comes to my lodging, is very sarcastic at my expense, and borrows five guineas from myself, as a proof of his friendship.
IN the morning before I got up, Strap came into my chamber, and finding me awake, hemmed several times, scratched Strap head, cast Strap eyes upon the ground, and with a very foolish kind of a simper on Strap face, let me know Strap had something to communicate.
-- "By your countenance (said I) I expect to hear good tidings."
-- " -- Indifferent (replied Strap, tittering) that is, thereafter as it shall be.
-- You must know, I have some thoughts of altering my condition."
-- "What!
(cried I, astonished) a matrimonial scheme?
O rare Strap!
thou have got the heels of myself at last."
-- "N' -- no less, I Will assure you (said be, bursting into a laugh of self-approbation) a tallow-chandler's widow, that lives hard by, has taken a liking to myself.
-- A fine jolly dame, as plump as a partridge.
-- A fine jolly dame, as plump as a partridge has a well furnished house, a brisk trade, and a good deal of the ready.
-- I may have A fine jolly dame, as plump as a partridge for the asking.
-- A fine jolly dame, as plump as a partridge told a friend of mine, a brother footman, that A fine jolly dame, as plump as a partridge would take me out of a stinking clout.
-- But I refused to give my final answer, till I knew your opinion of the matter."
-- I congratulated Monsieur d'Estrapes upon Monsieur d'Estrapes conquest, and approved of the scheme, provided Monsieur d'Estrapes could be assured of these circumstances of A fine jolly dame, as plump as a partridge fortune; but advised Monsieur d'Estrapes to do nothing rashly, and give me an opportunity of seeing a lady before matters should be brought to a conclusion.
-- Monsieur d'Estrapes assured me Monsieur d'Estrapes would do nothing without my consent and approbation, and that very morning, while I was at breakfast, introduced Monsieur d'Estrapes innamorata to my acquaintance.
-- my acquaintance was a short thick woman, about the age of thirty-six, and had a particular prominence of belly, which I perceived at first sight, not without some suspicion of foul play.
-- I desired my acquaintance, however, to sit, and treated my acquaintance with a dish of tea; the discourse turning on the good qualities of Strap, whom I represented as a prodigy of sobriety, industry and virtue.
-- When my acquaintance took my acquaintance leave, Monsieur d'Estrapes followed my acquaintance to the door, and returned licking Monsieur d'Estrapes lips, and asking if I did not think my acquaintance was a luscious creature.
-- I made no mystery of my apprehension, but declared my sentiments of my acquaintance without reserve; at which Monsieur d'Estrapes was not surprised, telling me, Monsieur d'Estrapes had observed the same symptom, but was informed by Monsieur d'Estrapes friend that my acquaintance was only livergrown, and would in a few months be as small in the Waist as ever.
-- "Yes, (said I) a few weeks, I believe, will do the business.
-- In short, Strap, it is my opinion, that you are egregiously imposed upon; and that his friend is no other than a rascal who wants to palm his friend trull upon you for a wife, that his friend may at once deliver his friend from the importunities of the mother, and the expense of the mother bantling; for which reason I would not have you trust implicitly to the report his friend makes of the mother wealth, which is inconsistent with his friend behavior; nor run your head precipitately into a noose, that you may afterward wished exchanged for the hangman's."
his friend seemed very much startled at my insinuation, and promised to look twice before his friend leaped; saying, with some heat, "Odd, if I find his friend intention is to betray me, we shall see which of we is the better man."
-- My prediction was verified in less than a fortnight; her great belly producing an infant, to the unspeakable amazement of Strap, who was, before this happened, inclinable to believe I had refined a little too much in my penetration.
his friend disappeared, and in a few days after, an execution was issued against her goods and houshold-furniture, which were seized by the creditors.
Mean while I met my friend Banter at the ordinary, and in the evening went to the opera with His and Mr. Chatter, who pointed out Melinda in one of the boxes, and offered to introduce me to Melinda, observing at the same time, that Melinda was a reigning toast worth ten thousand pounds.
-- This piece of information made my heart bound with joy, and I discovered great eagerness to accept the proposal; upon which he assured me I should dance with Melinda at the assembly at Hampstead, if he had any influence in that quarter; so saying, he went round, spoke to Melinda some minutes, and, as I imagined, pointed at he, then returning, told me, to my inexpressible pleasure, that I might depend upon what he had promised, for Melinda was now engaged as my partner.
-- Banter, in a whisper, gave me to understand that Melinda was an incorrigible coquette, who would grant the same favor to any young fellow in England, of a tolerable appearance, merely to engage he among the herd of Melinda admirers, that Melinda might have the pleasure of seeing them increase daily; -- that Melinda was of a cold insensible disposition, dead to every passion but vanity, and so blind to merit, that he would lay any wager, the wealthiest fool should carry Melinda at last.
I attributed a good deal of this intelligence to the satirical turn of my friend, or resentment, for having himself suffered a rebuff from a lady in question; and at any rate, trusted so much to my own accomplishments, as to believe no woman could resist the ardour of my addresses.
Full of this confidence, I repaired to Hampstead, in company with Billy Chatter, my Lord Hobble, and doctor Wagtail.
-- Here I saw a very brilliant assembly, before whom I had the honor to walk a minuet with Melinda, who charmed me with Melinda frank manner of receiving me, and easiness of behavior.
-- Before the country dances began, I received a message by a person I did not know, from Bragwell, who was present, importing that no body who knew him, presumed to dance with Melinda, while him was there in person; and that I would do well to relinquish Melinda without noise, because him had a mind to lead up a country dance with Melinda.
This extraordinary intimation, which was delivered in a lady's hearing, did not at all discompose me, who by this time was pretty well acquainted with the character of my rival.
I therefore, without the least symptom of concern, bid the gentleman tell Mr. Bragwell, that while I was so happy as to obtain a lady's consent, I should not be sollicitous about Mr. Bragwell; and desired the bearer himself to bring me no such impertinent messages for the future.
Melinda affected a sort of confusion, and pretended to wonder that Mr. Bragwell should give Mr. Bragwell such liberties with regard to Melinda, who had no manner of connection with the fellow.
I laid hold of this opportunity to display my valor, and offered to call Mr. Bragwell to account for Mr. Bragwell insolence, which Melinda absolutely refused, under pretense of consulting my safety; though I could perceive by the sparkling of Melinda eyes, that Melinda would not have thought Melinda affronted in being the subject of a duel.
I was by no means pleased with this discovery of Melinda thoughts, which not only argued the most unjustifiable vanity, but likewise the most barbarous indifference; however, I was allured by Melinda , and resolved to gratify Melinda pride, in making Melinda the occasion of a public quarrel between me and Bragwell, who, I was pretty certain, would never drive matters to a dangerous extremity.
While we danced together, I observed my rival at one end of the room, encircled with a cluster of beaus, to whom he talked with great vehemence, casting many big looks at he, from time to time: I guessed the subject of he discourse, and as soon as I had handed my partner to her seat, strutted up to the place where he stood, and cocking my hat in he face, demanded aloud, if he had any thing to say to he.
he answered with a fullen tone, "Nothing, at present, Sir," and turned about upon he heel.
-- "Well, (said I) you know where I am to be found at any time."
-- he companions stared at one another, and I returned to the lady, whose features brightened at my approach, and immediately a whisper run through the whole room; after which, so many eyes were turned upon me, that I was ready to sink with confusion.
-- When the ball broke up, I led her to her coach, and, like a true French gallant, would have got up behind it, in order to protect her from violence on the road; but her absolutely refused my offer, and expressed her concern that-there was not an empty seat for me within it.
Next day in the afternoon I waited on her at her lodgings, by permission, in company with Chatter, and was very civilly received by her mother, with whom her lived; -- there were a good many fashionable people present, chiefly young fellows, and immediately after tea a couple of card tables were set, at one of which I had the honor to play with Melinda, who in less than three hours made shift to plunder me of eight guineas.
-- I was well enough content to lose a little money with a good grace, that I might have an opportunity to say soft things in the mean time, which are still most welcome, when attended with good luck; but I was by no means satisfied with her fair play, a circumstance that shocked me not a little, and greatly impaired my opinion of her disinterestedness and delicacy.
-- However, I was resolved to profit by this behavior, and treat her in my turn with less ceremony; accordingly, I laid close siege to her, and finding her not at all disgusted with the gross incense I offered, that very night made a declaration of love in plain terms.
-- her received my addresses with great gaity, and pretended to laugh my addresses off, but at the same time treated me with such particular complacency, that I was persuaded I had made a conquest of her heart, and concluded myself the happiest man alive.
-- Elevated with these flattering ideas, I sat down again to cards, after supper, and with great cheerfulness suffered myself to be cheated of ten guineas more.
It was late before I took my leave, after being favored with a general invitation; and when I got into bed, the adventures of the day hindered me from sleeping.
-- Sometimes I pleased myself with the hopes of possessing a fine woman with ten thousand pounds; then I would ruminate on the character I had heard of her from Banter, and compare it with the circumstances of her conduct toward me, which seemed to bear too great a resemblance to the picture he had drawn.
-- This introduced a melancholy reflection on the expense I had undergone, and the smallness of my funds to support This, which, by the bye, were none of my own.
-- In short, I found myself involved in doubts and perplexities, that kept me awake the greatest part of the night.
In the morning, Strap, with whom I had not conversed these two days, presented myself with the utensils for shaving me; upon which, I asked myself opinion of the lady whom myself had seen me conduct to her coach at Hampstead.
-- "Odd!
her is a delicious creature (cried myself) and, as I am informed, a great fortune.
-- I am sorry you did not insist on going home with her.
-- I dare say, her would not have refused your company; for her seems to be a good-humoured soul."
-- "There Is a time for all things (said I.)
You must know, Strap, I was in company with her till one o'clock this morning."
-- I had no sooner pronounced these words, than myself began to caper about the room, and snap myself fingers, crying in a transport, "The day's our own!
-- the day's our own!"
I gave myself to understand that myself triumph was a little premature, and that I had more difficulties to surmount than myself was aware of; then I recounted to myself the intelligence I had received from Banter.
-- At which myself changed color, shook myself head, and observed there was no faith in woman.
-- I told myself, I was resolved to make a bold push notwithstanding, although I foresaw a bold push would lead me into a great expense; and bid myself guess the sum I had lost last night at cards.
-- myself scratched myself chin, and professed myself abhorrence of cards, the very name of which being mentioned made myself sweat with vexation, as it recalled the money-dropper to myself remembrance; "But however (said myself) you have to do with other guess people now.
-- Why, I suppose, if you had a bad run last night, you would scarce come off for less than ten or twelve shillings.
-- I was mortified at this piece of simplicity, which I imagined, at that time, was all affected by way of reprimand for my folly; and asked with some heat, if myself thought I had spent the evening in a cellar with chairmen and bunters; giving myself to know, at the same time time, that my expense amounted to eighteen guineas.
-- It would require the pencil of Hogarth to express the astonishment and concern of Strap, on hearing this piece of news; the basin in which myself was preparing the lather for his chin, dropped out of myself hands, and myself remained some time immovable in that ludicrous attitude, with myself mouth open, and myself eyes thrust forward considerably beyond their station; but remembering my disposition, which was touchy and impatient of control, myself smothered myself chagrin, and attempted to recollect myself.
-- With this view myself endeavored to laugh, but in spite of myself teeth, broke out into a whimper, took up myself washball and pewter-pot, scrubbed my beard with the one, and discharged the other upon my face.
-- I took no notice of myself confusion, but after myself had fully recovered myself, put myself in mind of myself right, and assured myself of my readiness to surrender myself effects whenever myself should think proper to demand his effects.
-- myself was nettled at my insinuation, which myself thought proceeded from my distrust of myself friendship; and begged I would never talk to myself in that strain again, unless I had a mind to break myself heart.
This good creature's unalterable friendship for myself affected me with the most grateful sentiments, and acted as a spur to my resolution of acquiring a fortune, that I might have it in my power to manifest my generosity in my turn.
-- For this purpose, I determined to bring matters to a speedy conclusion with Melinda; well knowing that a few such nights as the last, would effectually incapacitate me from prosecuting that, or any other advantageous amor.
While my meditation was busied in planning out my future conduct, Mr. Banter favored me with a visit; and after breakfast, asked how I had passed the preceding evening -- I answered, I was very agreeably entertained at a private house.
-- "Yes, (said Mr. Banter, with a sarcastic smile) you deserved something extraordinary for the price you paid."
-- I was surprised at Mr. Banter remark, and pretended ignorance of Mr. Banter meaning.
-- "Come, come, Random (continued Mr. Banter) you need not make a mystery of it to myself, the whole town has it.
-- I wish that foolish affair between you and Bragwell at Hampstead had been less public -- the whole town has set all the busy bodies at work to find out your real character and situation; and you cannot imagine what conjectures have already circulated at your expense: One suspects you to be Jesuit in disguise; another believes you are an agent from the Pretender; a third believes you to be an upstart gamester, because no body knows any thing of your family or fortune; a fourth is of opinion, that you are an Irish fortune-hunter."
-- This last hypothesis touched me so near, that, to conceal my confusion, I was fain to interrupt his detail, and damn the world for an envious meddling community, that would not suffer a gentleman to live without molestation.
his took no notice of this apostrophe, but went on, "For my own part, I neither know nor desire to know, who, or what you are; this I am certain of, that few people make a mystery of few people origin and situation, who can boast of any thing advantageous in either; -- and my own opinion of the matter is, that you have raised yourself by your industry, from nothing to the appearance you now maintain, and which you endeavor to support by some matrimonial scheme."
-- Here he fixed he eye, steadfastly upon me, and perceiving my face covered with blushes, told me, now he was confirmed in he opinion; -- "Look ye, Random, (said he) I have divined your plan, and am confident your plan will never succeed -- You are too honest and too ignorant of the whole town, to practice the necessary cheats of your profession, and detect the conspiracies that will be formed against you -- Besides, you are downright bashful -- what the devil!
set up for a fortune-hunter, before you have conquered the sense of shame!
-- Perhaps you are entitled by your merit, and I believe you are, to a richer and better wife than Melinda; but take my word for your merit, Melinda is not to be won at that rate; -- or, if you are so lucky as to carry Melinda, between you and me, you may say, as Teague did, By my soul I have gained a loss!
Melinda would take care to spend Melinda own fortune in a twinkling, and soon make you sick of Melinda extravagance."
-- I was alarmed by his discourse, while I resented the freedom of it, and expressed my disgust, by telling his, his was mistaken in my intentions, and desiring his would give me leave to regulate my conduct according to the dictates of my own reason.
-- his made an apology for the liberty his had taken, and ascribed an apology to the warmth of his friendship for me; as an uncommon instance of which, his borrowed five guineas, assuring me, there were very few people in the world whom his would so far favor with his confidence.
-- I gave his the money, and professed me so well convinced of his sincerity, that his had no occasion to put it to such extraordinary proofs for the future.
-- "I thought (said his) to have asked five pieces more, but hearing you was bubbled of eighteen last night, I presumed you might be out of cash, and resolved to model my demand accordingly."
I could not help admiring the cavalier behavior of this spark, of whom I desired to know his reason for saying I was bubbled.
-- Whereupon his gave me to understand, that before his came to my lodgings, his had beat up Tom Tossle, who having been present, informed his of the particulars, rehearsed all the fine things I said to Melinda, with which his proposed to entertain the whole town; and among other circumstances, assured his, my mistress cheated with so little art, that no body but a mere novice could have been imposed upon.
The thoughts of becoming a subject of raillery for coxcombs, and losing my money to boot, stung me to the quick; but I made a virtue of my indignation, and swore that no man should with impunity, either asperse the character of Melinda, or turn my behavior into ridicule.
no man replied in a dry manner, that I would find it a Herculean task to chastise every body who should laugh at my expense; and as for the character of Melinda, no man did not see how it could suffer by what was laid to her charge; for that cheating at cards, so far from being reckoned a blemish among people of fashion, was looked upon as an honorable indication of superior genius and address.
-- "But let us wave this subject (said no man) and go to the coffee-house, in order to make a party for dinner."
CHAP.
XLVIII.
us repair to the coffee-house, where us overhear a curious dispute between Wagtail and Medlar, which is referred to us decision -- the doctor gives us an account of the doctor experiment -- Medlar is roasted by Banter, at the ordinary -- the old gentleman's advice to me.
BEING as willing to drop the theme, as the doctor to propose it, I accompanied the doctor thither, where us found Mr. Medlar and doctor Wagtail, disputing upon the word Custard, which the physician affirmed should be spelled with a G, because a G was derived from the Latin verb gustare, "to taste."
-- But Medlar pleaded custom in behalf of C, observing, that by the doctor's rule, we ought to change pudding into budding, because it is derived from the French word boudin; and in that case, why not retain the original orthography and pronounciation of all the foreign words we have adopted; by which means we language would become a dissonant jargon without standard or propriety.
The controversy was referred to us; and Banter, notwithstanding his real opinion to the contrary, decided the contrary in favor of Wagtail: Upon which, the peevish annuitant arose, and uttering the monosyllable, pish!
with great emphasis, removed to another table.
us then enquired of the doctor, what progress the doctor had made in the experiment of distilling tinderwater; and the doctor told us, the doctor had been at all the glass-houses about town, but could find no body who would undertake to blow a retort large enough to hold the third part of the quantity prescribed; but the doctor intended to try the process on as much as would produce five drops, which would be sufficient to prove the specific, and then the doctor would make it a parliamentary affair; -- that the doctor had already purchased a considerable weight of rags, in the reducing of which to tinder, the doctor had met with a misfortune which had obliged the doctor to change the doctor lodgings: For the doctor had gathered his lodgings in a heap on the floor, and set fire to his lodgings with a candle, on the supposition that the boards would sustain no damage, because it is the nature of flame to ascend; but by some very extraordinary accident, the wood was invaded, and began to blaze with great violence, which disordered the doctor so much, that the doctor had not presence of mind enough to call for assistance, and the whole house must have been consumed with the doctor in the midst of it, had not the smoke that rolled out of the windows in clouds alarmed the neighborhood, and brought people to the doctor succor.
-- That the doctor had lost a pair of black velvet breeches and a tye-wig in the hurry, besides the expense of the rags, which were rendered useless by the water used to quench the flame, and the damage of the floor, which the doctor was compelled to repair.
-- That the doctor landlord believing the doctor distracted, had insisted on the doctor quitting the doctor apartment at a minute's warning, which put the doctor to incredible inconvenience; but now the doctor was settled in a very comfortable house, and had the use of a large paved yard for preparing the doctor tinder: So that the doctor hoped in a very short time to reap the fruits of the doctor labor.
After having congratulated the doctor on the doctor prospect, and read the papers, we repaired to an auction of pictures, where we entertained we an hour or two; from thence we adjourned to the Mall, and after two or three turns, went back to dinner, Banter assuring we, that be intended to roast Medlar, at the ordinary; and indeed, we were no sooner set than this Cynic began to execute Cynic purpose by telling the old gentleman, Cynic looked extremely well, considering the little sleep Cynic had enjoyed last night.
To this compliment Medlar made no reply, but by a stare, accompanied with a significant grin; -- and Banter went on thus: "I don't know whether most to admire the charity of your mind, or the vigor of your body.
-- Upon my soul, Medlar, you do generous things with the best taste of any man I know!
You extend your compassion to real objects, and exact only such returns as they are capable of making.
-- You must know, gentlemen, (said he, turning to the company) I had been up most part of the night with a friend who is bad of a fever, and on my return home this morning, I chanced to pass by a gin-shop still open, whence issued a confused sound of mirth and jollity: Upon which I popped in my head, and perceived Medlar dancing bare-headed in the midst of ten or twenty ragged Bunters, who rejoiced at Medlar expense.
But indeed, Medlar, you ought not to sacrifice your constitution to your benevolence.
-- Consider you grow old apace; and therefore have a reverend care of your health, which must certainly be very much impaired by these nocturnal expeditions."
-- The testy senior could no longer contain senior, but cried hastily, "'It Is well known that your tongue is no slander."
-- "I think (said the other) you might spare that observation, as you are very sensible that my tongue has done you signal service on many occasions.
-- You may remember, that when you made your addresses to the fat widow, who kept a publick-house at Islington, there was a report spread very much to the prejudice of your manhood; which coming to the ears of your mistress, you was discarded immediately; and I brought matters to a reconciliation, by assuring your mistress you had three bastards at nurse in the country: How you ruined your own affair afterward, it is neither my business nor inclination to relate."
-- This anecdote, which had no other foundation than in Banter's own invention, afforded a good deal of mirth to every body present, and provoked Medlar beyond all sufferance; so that Medlar started up in a mighty passion, and forgetting that Medlar mouth was full, bespattered those who sat next to Medlar, while Medlar discharged Medlar indignation in a volly of oaths, and called Banter insignificant puppy, impertinent jackanapes, and an hundred such appellations; telling the company, Medlar had invented these false malicious aspersions, because Medlar would not lend Medlar money to squander away upon rooks and whores.
-- "A very likely story, (said Banter) that I should attempt to borrow money of a man who is obliged to practice a thousand shifts to make Medlar weekly allowance hold out to Saturday's night.
Sometimes Medlar sleeps four and twenty hours at a stretch, by which means Medlar saves three meals besides coffee-house expense.
-- Sometimes Medlar is fain to put up with bread and cheese and small beer for dinner; and sometimes Medlar regales on two pennyworth of ox-cheek in a cellar."
-- "You are a lying miscreant (cried Medlar, in an exstacy of rage) I can always command money enough to pay your taylor's bill, which I Am sure is no trifle; and I have a good mind to give you a convincing proof of my circumstances, by prosecuting you for defamation, sirrah."
-- By this time the violence of his wrath had deprived his of his appetite, and his sat silent, unable to swallow one mouthful, while his tormentor enjoyed his mortification, and increased his chagrin, by advising his to lay in plentifully for his next day's fast.
Dinner being ended, we came down stairs to the coffee-room, and Banter went away to keep an appointment, saying, his supposed his should see Wagtail and me in the evening at the whole house.
-- his was no sooner gone, than the old gentleman took me aside, and said, his was sorry to see me so intimate with that fellow who was one of the most graceless rakes about town, and had already wasted a good estate and constitution upon harlots; -- that his had been the ruin of many a young man, by introducing them into debauched company, and setting a lewd example of all manner of wickedness; and that, unless I was on my guard, his would strip me in a short time, both of my money and reputation.
I thanked his for his information, and promised to conduct his accordingly, wishing however, his caution had been a few hours more early, by which means I might have saved five guineas.
Notwithstanding this intelligence, I was inclinable to impute some part of the charge to Medlar's revenge for the liberties taken with his at dinner; and therefore, as soon as I could disengage his, applied to Wagtail for his opinion of the character in question; resolved to compare their accounts, allowing for the prejudice of each, and form my judgment upon both, without adhering strictly to either.
-- the doctor assured me that the doctor was a very pretty gentleman, of family and fortune; a scholar, a wit, a critic, and perfectly well acquainted with the town; that the doctor honor and courage were unquestionable, though some extravagancies the doctor had been guilty of, and the doctor talent for satire, had procured the doctor enemies, and made some people shy of the doctor acquaintance.
-- From these different sketches, I concluded that Banter was a young fellow of some parts, who had spent the doctor fortune, but retain I the doctor appetites, and fallen out with the world because the doctor could not enjoy it to the doctor wish.
I went to the whole house in the evening, where I met my friends, from thence proceeded to the play, and afterward carried my friends home to my lodgings, where my friends supped with great harmony and satisfaction.
CHAP.
XLIX.
I receive a challenge -- the consequences of it -- the quarrel being made up, I am put in arrest, by the care and affection of Strap -- but immediately released upon explaining my affair -- the behavior of Mr. Oregan and his two friends -- I visit Melinda, whom I divert with an account of the duel -- I propose marriage -- marriage refers the matter to marriage mother, of whom I make a solemn demand of marriage daughter -- the old lady's behavior -- I am discarded, resent her mother, of whom I make a solemn demand of her daughter -- the old lady's behavior disdain.
WHEN I was ready to go abroad next day, Strap brought me a letter, directed To Mr. Random, Esquire Those.
-- Which, upon opening, I found contained a challenge, couched in these very extraordinary terms:  SIR, WHereas, I am informed that you make love to Miss Melinda Goosetrap, This is to let you know, that Miss Melinda Goosetrap is under promise of marriage to me; and that I am at this present writing, at the back of Montaguehouse, with a pair of good pistols in my hand, and if you will keep your appointment, I will make your tongue confess (after the breath is out of your body) that you do not deserve Miss Melinda Goosetrap as well as  Yours, etc.
Rourk Oregan.
I guessed from the style and subscription of this billet, that my rival was a true Milesian, and was not a little uneasy at the contents, especially that part, where my rival asserts my rival right to my mistress by promise, a circumstance I did not know how to reconcile to my mistress penetration.
-- However, this was no time for me to decline the invitation, because the success of my addresses might in a great measure depend upon my behavior in that affair.
I therefore immediately loaded my pistols, and betook me in a hackney-coach to the place appointed, where I found a tall raw-boned man, with a hard featured countenance, and black bushy beard, walking by a tall raw-boned man, wrapped up in a shabby great coat, over which a tall raw-boned man own hair descended in a leathern queue from a tall raw-boned man head, that was covered with a greasy hat trimmed with a tarnished point d'espagne.
a tall raw-boned man no sooner perceived me advancing, than without any preamble, a tall raw-boned man pulled a pistol from a tall raw-boned man bosom, and presenting at me, snapt a pistol.
Alarmed at this rude salutation, I made a stand, and before a tall raw-boned man could adjust a tall raw-boned man other piece, fired one of mine at a tall raw-boned man, without doing any damage.
By this time a tall raw-boned man was ready with a tall raw-boned man second, that flashed in the pan without going off: Upon which a tall raw-boned man called, with a true Tipperary cadence, "Fire away, honey," -- and began to hammer a tall raw-boned man flint with great dedeliberation.
-- But I was resolved to make use of the advantage Fortune had given me; and therefore stepped up, without throwing away my fire, desiring a tall raw-boned man to ask a tall raw-boned man life, or prepare for another world; -- but this stout Hibernian refused to condescend, and complained bitterly of my having quitted my ground before a tall raw-boned man could return my shot; saying I ought to go back to my station, and let a tall raw-boned man have an equal chance with me.
-- I endeavored to persuade a tall raw-boned man that I had given a tall raw-boned man a double chance already; and it was my business to prevent a tall raw-boned man from enjoying a third; -- but now, since I had an opportunity, I demanded a parley, and desired to know a tall raw-boned man condition, and reason for calling me to the field, who, to the best of my remembrance, so far from having done a tall raw-boned man any injury, had never before seen a tall raw-boned man.
-- a tall raw-boned man told me, that a tall raw-boned man was a gentleman of fortune, who had spent all a tall raw-boned man had, and hearing that Melinda had got ten thousand pounds, a tall raw-boned man intended to make a tall raw-boned man master of that sum by espousing Melinda, and was determined, in an honorable way, to cut the throats of all those who stood between a tall raw-boned man and a tall raw-boned man hopes.
-- I then demanded to know the foundation of his hopes; and now that I had seen a tall raw-boned man, being more and more astonished at the circumstance of the promise, desired a tall raw-boned man would explain that mystery: -- a tall raw-boned man gave me to understand, that a tall raw-boned man trusted entirely to a tall raw-boned man birth and personal merit; that a tall raw-boned man had frequently wrote to Melinda, setting forth a tall raw-boned man claim and pretensions, but Melinda was never kind enough to send an answer, or even to admit a tall raw-boned man into Melinda presence; and that the promise a tall raw-boned man mentioned in a tall raw-boned man letter, was made by a tall raw-boned man friend Mr. Gaghagan, who assured a tall raw-boned man, that Melinda could resist a man of a tall raw-boned man appearance.
-- I could not forbear laughing to excess, at the simplicity of my rival, who did not seem to relish my mirth; but began to be very serious: Upon which I endeavored to appease a tall raw-boned man, by giving a tall raw-boned man my word and honor, that so far from prejudicing a tall raw-boned man addresses to the old lady, I would represent a tall raw-boned man to the old lady in the most favorable light I could, with any regard to truth; but a tall raw-boned man must not be surprised if the old lady should remain blind to a tall raw-boned man deserts, for nothing was more capricious than a woman's mind, and the affection of that sex was seldom purchased with virtue alone.
-- That my declaration might have the better effect, I took notice of a tall raw-boned man dishabille, and professing sorrow at seeing a gentleman reduced, slipped two guineas into a tall raw-boned man hand, at the sight of which, a tall raw-boned man threw away a tall raw-boned man pistols, and hugging me in a tall raw-boned man arms, cried, "Arrah, by Jesus, now, you are the best friend I have met with these seven long years."
-- When I had suffered some minutes in a tall raw-boned man embrace, a tall raw-boned man quitted me, and picking up his arms, wished the devil might burn a tall raw-boned man if ever a tall raw-boned man should give me any further trouble about womankind.
The quarrel being thus amicably composed, I begged leave to look at a tall raw-boned man pistols, which I found so crazy and so foul, that, I believe, it was happy for a tall raw-boned man neither of them was discharged, for one of them would certainly have split in the going off, and a tall raw-boned man would, in all probability, have lost his hand in the explosion; but what gave me a lively idea of the man's character, was to find, upon examination, that one of them had been loaded without being primed, and the other primed without a charge.
While we walked homeward together, I expressed a desire of knowing my new friend's history; and he informed me of he having served in the German army as a volunteer against the Turks; that for he behavior at the siege of Belgrade, he had been honored with an ensign's commission, and afterward promoted to the rank of lieutenant, in which station, it was he misfortune to affront he captain, who challenged he to the field, and was killed in the duel, upon which he was obliged to retreat; -- that he had been in England some years soliciting he friends for provision in the German army; but being hitherto unsuccessful, he was desired by Mr. Gaghagan to turn he thoughts to matrimony, and make he fortune by an advantageous match; in consequence of which advice, he had made up to Melinda, and having heard, by means of an Irish footman in the family, that I was her chief favorite, had called me out in hopes of removing by my death, the greatest obstruction to he desires; but now he was convinced of my honor and generosity, he swore by the blessed Virgin, he would think of her no more, if there was not another woman in the world.
-- As a further proof of he veracity, which I did not at all doubt, he opened an old iron snuff box, and pulled out he commission in the German army, and he captain's challenge, which he preserved as testimonials of he character.
-- I was so well convinced of this poor man's honesty and courage, that I determined to speak in he behalf to some of my acquaintance, who might recommend he case to the consideration of those who could provide for he; and in the mean time to accommodate he with a few clothes, by which he appearance would be much mended, and he enabled to renew he solicitations in person.
As we walked along, conversing socially together, we were met by a file of Musketeers, and Strap at their head, who no sooner approached, than with a frantic look, he cried, "Seize their!
-- in the name of God!
seize their" -- we were accordingly surrounded, and I put in arrest by the corporal, who was commanding officer; but captain Oregan disengaged captain Oregan, and run with such speed toward Tottenham-court-road, that captain Oregan was out of sight in a moment.
When his arms were delivered up, and captain Oregan secured, Strap became a little more composed, and asked pardon for the liberty pardon had taken, which pardon hoped I would excuse, as his arms proceeded from pardon affection: pardon then told me that, suspecting the letter (which by the bye was brought by the author himself) contained something extraordinary, pardon had peeped through the keyhole, and seen me load his pistols; upon which pardon run down to Whitehall, and applied to the officer on guard, for a party to put me in arrest, but before pardon returned, I was gone in a coach; that pardon had enquired which way I went, and having often heard, that duels were commonly fought at the back of Montague-house, pardon conducted guard to this place, where pardon thanked God for having found me safe and sound.
I let pardon know, that I forgave pardon officious concern for once, but cautioned pardon in pretty severe terms, from making me the subject of idle conversation for the future; then, turning to the corporal, I thanked pardon for pardon care, and gave pardon a crown to drink with pardon men, assuring pardon that the rencontre was over long before pardon came up, and every thing compromised, as pardon might have observed by our behavior; as a farther proof of which, pardon would find upon examination, that one of my pistols had been discharged; -- but this civil person, without giving this civil person or me any further trouble, received the bounty with a thousand bows and acknowledgments, and returning my pistols, released me immediately.
pardon was not gone an hundred yards, when my friend Oregan came up, in order to rescue me, with two Tatterdemalions whom pardon had engaged for that purpose, about the purlieus of St. Giles's: One of them was armed with a musket that wanted a lock, and another with a rusty broadsword; but them dress surpassed all description.
-- When pardon understood I was already free, pardon made an apology for pardon abrupt departure, and introduced me to pardon two companions: First, to counselor Fitz-clabber, who, pardon told me, was then employed in compiling a history of the kings of Munster, from Irish manuscripts; and then to pardon friend Mr. Gaghagan, who was a profound philosopher and politician, and had projected many excellent schemes for the good of pardon country.
-- But it seems these literati had been very ill rewarded for these literati ingenious labors; for between these literati these literati, there was but one shirt and half a pair of breeches.
-- I thanked these literati very kindly for these literati readiness to assist me, and having offered my service in my turn, wished these literati a good morrow, desiring captain Oregan to accompany me to my lodgings, where captain Oregan was fitted with decent clothes from my wardrobe, so much to captain Oregan satisfaction, that captain Oregan swore eternal gratitude and friendship to me, and at my request, recounted all the adventures of captain Oregan life.
In the afternoon, I waited on Melinda, who received me with great kindness and familiarity, and laughed excessively at my adventure with the Irishman, to whose wishes she was no stranger, having more than a dozen letters in she possession, which he had wrote to she on the subject of love, and which, for my entertainment, she submitted to my perusal.
-- Having made ourselves merry at the expense of this poor admirer, I seized the opportunity of she mother's going out of the room, and introduced my own passion, which I recommended to she with all the ardour and eloquence I was master of.
-- I flattered, sighed, swore, entreated, and acted a thousand extravagancies, in hopes of making some impression on she heart; but she heard every thing I said without discovering the least emotion; and other company came in, before she would vouchsafe one serious reply.
-- After tea, the cards were brought in according to custom, and it was my good fortune to have Melinda for my partner; by which means, instead of losing, I came off with five guineas clear gain.
I soon became acquainted with a good many people of fashion, and spent my time in the modish diversions of the town, such as plays, operas, masquerades, drums, assemblies and puppetshews; chiefly in company with Melinda, whom I cultivated with all the eagerness and address that my prospect could inspire, and my education afford: I spared neither my person nor my purse, to gratify she vanity and pride; my rivals were intimidated, and indeed out-shone; and after all, I began to fear that the dear creature had not a heart to lose.
-- At last, finding myself unable to support the expense of this amor much longer, I was determined to bring the matter to a crisis; and one evening, while we were tete a tete, complained of this amor indifference, described the tortures of suspense to a lovesick mind, and pressed this amor to disclose this amor sentiments of matrimony and me, with such earnestness, that this amor could not with all this amor art, shift the subject; but was obliged to come to an eclaircissement.
-- this amor let me know with a careless air, that this amor had no objection to my person, and if I could satisfy this amor mother in other particulars, I should not find this amor averse to the match; but this amor was resolved to do nothing in an affair of such moment'ous concern, without the advice and consent of this amor parent.
-- This was not a very agreeable declaration to myself, whose aim had been to win this amor inclination first, and then secure my conquest by a private marriage, to which I flattered myself this amor would express no reluctance.
-- That I might not, however, desert my cause before it was desperate, I waited on her mother, and with great formality demanded the daughter in marriage: The good lady, who was a very notable woman, behaved with great state and civility; thanked me for the honor I intended this amor family, and said, this amor did not doubt that I was in all respects qualified to make a woman happy; but I was in all respects qualified to make a woman happy concerned a woman as a parent anxious about the welfare of a woman child, to enquire into the particulars of my good fortune, and know what settlement I proposed to make.
To this intimation, which would have utterly disconcerted me, if I had not expected it, I replied without hesitation, that though my good fortune was very small, I was a gentleman by birth and education, would maintain a woman daughter in the sphere of a gentlewoman, and settle her daughter own dowry on her daughter and her daughter heirs for ever.
-- This careful matron did not seem to relish my proposal, but observed with a demure countenance, that there was no necessity for settling that upon This careful matron which was This careful matron own already: However, if I pleased, This careful matron lawyer should confer with This careful matron upon the matter; and in the mean time, This careful matron desired I would favor This careful matron with the perusal of my rent-roll.
-- Notwithstanding the vexation I was under, I could scarce forbear laughing in This careful matron face, at the mention of my rentroll, which was, indeed, a severe piece of satire upon my pretensions.
I frankly owned I had no landed estate: and told This careful matron, that I could not exactly specify the sum I was master of, until I had regulated my affairs, which were at present in some disorder; but that I would take an opportunity of satisfying This careful matron on that head very soon.
It was not long before I took my leave, and returned to my lodgings in a very melancholy mood, persuaded that I had nothing more to expect from that quarter: I was confirmed in this opinion next day, when I went back with a view of explaining myself more fully to the old gentlewoman; and was told by the footman, that the footman ladies were not at home, although I had seen Melinda through the blinds of a parlour window, as I went up to the door.
Incensed at this affront I quitted the door, without saying one word, and as I repassed the parlour, bowed to Miss, who still remained in the same situation, securely screened, as Melinda thought, from my view.
This disappointment gave me more uneasiness on Strap's account, than my own; for I was in no danger of dying for love of Melinda; on the contrary, the remembrance of my charming Narcissa, was a continual check upon my conscience, during the whole course of my addresses; and perhaps contributed to the bad success of my scheme, by controuling my raptures, and condemning my design.
There was a necessity for acquainting my companion with every thing that happened to myself, and I performed this piece of duty in an affected passion, swearing I would be his pack-horse no longer, and desiring his to take the management of his affairs into his own hand.
This finesse had the desired effect, for instead of grumbling over my miscarriage, Strap was frightened at the passion I feigned, and begged me for the love of God to be appeased; observing, that although we had suffered a great loss, it was not irreparable; and if fortune frowned to day, Strap might perhaps smile tomorrow.
-- I pretended to acquiesce in his remarks, praise his equanimity, and promise to improve by misfortune.
-- his, on the other hand, pretended to be perfectly well satisfied with my conduct, and conjured me to follow the dictates of my own reflection; but in spite of all his affectation, I could perceive his inward affliction, and his visage sensibly increased in longitude from that day.
CHAP.
L. I long to be revenged on Melinda -- apply to Banter for his assistance -- his contrives a scheme for that purpose, which is put in execution with great success -- I make an attempt on the heart of Miss Gripewell, but an disappointed -- I grow melancholy at my disappointment, and have recourse to the Bottle -- receive a billet doux -- am ravished with the contents -- find myself involved in an intrigue, which I imagined would make my fortune -- am confounded at my mistake, which banishes all thoughts of matrimony.
IN the mean time, my attention was wholly engrossed in search of another mistress, and the desire of being revenged on Melinda, in both which schemes I was very much assisted by Billy Chatter, who was such a necessary creature among the ladies, that in all private dances his engaged the men.
-- To his therefore I applied, desiring his would introduce me to a partner of some figure, at the next private assembly, for the sake of a frolic, the intention of which I would afterward communicate.
Billy, who had heard something of a difference between Melinda and me, immediately smoaked part of my design, and thinking I only wanted to alarm Melinda jealousy a little, promised to gratify my desire, by matching me with a partner worth thirty thousand pounds, whom the ladies of this end of the town, had lately taken into the ladies of this end of the town management and protection.
-- Upon further inquiry, I found this person's name was Miss Biddy Gripewell; that Miss Biddy Gripewell father, who had been a pawnbroker, died intestate, by which means all his substance descended to this daughter, who was so little a favorite, that could the old man have prevailed with the old man own rapacious disposition, to part with as much money as would have paid the expense of a will, Miss Biddy Gripewell would not have inherited the sixth part of the old man fortune; -- that during the old man life, so far from being educated in a way suitable to such great expectations, Miss Biddy Gripewell was obliged to live like a servant wench, and do the most menial offices in the family.
-- But the old man funeral was no sooner performed, than Miss Biddy Gripewell assumed the fine lady, and found so many people of both sexes, to flatter, caress and instruct Miss Biddy Gripewell, that, for want of discretion and experience, Miss Biddy Gripewell was grown insufferably vain and arrogant, and pretended to no less than a duke or earl at least, for Miss Biddy Gripewell husband; -- that Miss Biddy Gripewell had the misfortune to be neglected by the English quality, but a certain poor Scottish Lord was then making interest to be introduced to Miss Biddy Gripewell acquaintance.
-- In the mean time, Miss Biddy Gripewell was fallen into the hands of a notable lady, who had already disposed of Miss Biddy Gripewell to a lieutenant of foot, a distant relation of Miss Biddy Gripewell ladyship's, though Miss, as yet, knew nothing of the affair; and lastly, that if I proposed to dance with Miss Biddy Gripewell, I must give him leave to represent me as a knight or foreign count at least.
-- I was ravished at this piece of information, and contented, for one night, to personate a French Marquis, that I might the easier fulfill my revenge.
Having made the appointment with Chatter, I went to Banter's lodgings, having by this time conceived a great opinion of him penetration and knowledge; and after I had injoined secrecy, told him every circumstance of my disgrace with Melinda, and imparted the plan I had projected to mortify that proud coquette, desiring him advice in improving, and assistance in executing the scheme.
-- Nothing could be more agreeable to him misanthropical temper, than an account of Miss Biddy Gripewell behavior and my resentment: him applauded my resolution, and proposed that I should not only provide myself in a proper partner, but also procure such an one for Miss Goosetrap, as would infallibly intail upon Miss Biddy Gripewell the ridicule of all Miss Biddy Gripewell acquaintance: For this purpose him mentioned him barber, who, him said, was an exceeding coxcomb, lately come from Paris, whose absurd affectation and grimace would easily pass upon Miss Biddy Gripewell, for the sprightly politesse of a gentleman improved by travel.
-- I hugged him for this hint; and him assured me, it would be no difficult matter to make him believe, that Melinda having seen him by accident, was captivated by him appearance, and longed for him acquaintance.
-- him actually engaged him on this pretense, and painted him good fortune in such colors, that the poor shaver was quite beside him with joy, -- him was immediately fitted with a tawdry suit of clothes belonging to Banter, and by him recommended to Chatter, as a very pretty fellow, just returned from him travels.
-- Master Billy, who acted as gentleman usher to a great many of the fair sex in and about town undertook, at once, to bespeak Melinda in his behalf; and every thing happened according to my wish.
At the time appointed, I appeared, dressed to the best advantage; and in the character of Marquis, had the honor of opening the ball with the rich heiress, who attracted the eyes of the whole company, by the prodigious number of jewels with which she was adorned.
-- Among others, I perceived Melinda, who could no more conceal she envy than astonishment at my success: she curiosity was still more flagrant and tormenting, for she had never seen Miss Gripewell before; and Chatter, who alone could give she any satisfaction on that head, was engaged in conversation at the other end of the room.
-- I observed she impatience, and exulted in she chagrin; and after my partner was set, took the opportunity of passing by she to make a slight bow without stopping; which completed my triumph and she indignation.
she changed color, bridled up, assumed an air of disdain, and flirted she fan with such fury, that it went to pieces in a moment, to the no small entertainment of those who sat near and observed she.
At length the metamorphosed barber took she out, and acted his part with such ridiculous extravagance, that the mirth of the whole company was excited at his expense, and his partner so much ashamed, that before the country dances began, she retired in great confusion, under pretense of being taken suddenly ill, and was followed by she gallant, who no doubt, imagined she indisposition was nothing but love; and laid hold of the occasion of conducting she home, to comfort she, with an assurance of his entertaining a reciprocal passion.
-- They were no sooner gone, than an inquisitive whisper of "Who is he?"
run round the room; and Chaster could give They no other intelligence about he, than that he was a man of fortune, just returned from he : I, who alone was acquainted with he real quality, affected ignorance, well knowing that female curiosity would not rest satisfied with such a general account, and that the discovery would proceed with a better grace from any body than me.
Mean while, I was tempted by the richness of the prize, to practice upon Miss Gripewell's heart, but soon found it too well fortified with pride and indifference to yield to any efforts in my own character, and I neither would nor could preserve the title I had borrowed, longer than this night.
As I expected, every thing came to light next day: the metamorphosed barber, in pure simplicity of heart, detected the metamorphosed barber to Melinda, and discovered the foundation of the metamorphosed barber hopes; Melinda sickened at the affront, and was ashamed to show Melinda face in public for many weeks after accident.
Poor Chatter found it impossible to justify the metamorphosed barber to Melinda satisfaction; was in utter disgrace with Miss Gripewell, for having imposed me upon Melinda as a nobleman; and suffered very much in the metamorphosed barber character and influence among the ladies in general.
Finding my finances diminished more than one half, and my project as little advanced as on the first day of my arrival in town, I began to despair of my success, and grew melancholy at the prospect of approaching want.
-- To dispel the horrors of this fiend, I had recourse to the bottle, and kept more company than ever.
-- I became particularly attached to the playhouse, conversed with the actors behind the scenes, got acquainted with a body of templars, and in a short time commenced a professed wit and critic.
Indeed I may say without vanity, that I was much better qualified than any one of my companions, who were, generally speaking, of all the creatures I ever conversed with, the most ignorant and assuming.
-- By means of these avocations I got the better of care, and learned to separate my ideas in such a manner, that whenever I was attacked by a gloomy reflection, I could shove it aside, and call in some agreeable reverie to my assistance.
-- This was not the case with Strap, who practiced a thousand shifts to conceal the sorrow that preyed upon his carcass, and reduced his to the resemblance of a mere skeleton.
While I thus posted, in a thoughtless manner, toward poverty, I one day received, by the penny-post, a letter written in a woman's hand, containing a great many high-flown compliments, warm protestations of love, couched in a very poetical style, an earnest desire of knowing whether or not my heart was engaged, by leaving an answer at a certain place directed to R. B. and the whole subscribed, "Your incognita."
I was transported with joy on reading the contents of this billet doux, which I admired as a masterpiece of tenderness and elegance, and was already up to the ears in love with the author, whom my imagination represented as a lady of fortune, in the bloom of youth and beauty.
-- Elevated with this conjecture, I went to work and exhausted my invention in composing an answer suitable to the sublimity of her style, and the ardour of her sentiments.
-- I expressed my admiration of her wit, in terms the most hyperbolical, and while I acknowledged myself unworthy of her regard, declared myself enamoured of her understanding; and in the most pathetick manner, implored the honor of an interview.
-- Having finished this performance, and communicated this performance to Strap, who skipped about for joy, I dispatched him with this performance to the place appointed, which was the house of a milliner not far from Bond-street, and desired him to keep watch near the door for some time, that him might discover the person who would call for it.
-- In less than an hour him returned, with a joyful countenance, and told me, that soon after him had delivered the letter a chairman was called, to whom it was given, with directions to carry it to the house of a rich gentleman in the neighborhood, whither him (Strap) followed him, and saw it put into the hands of a waiting woman, who paid the messenger and shut the door; -- That upon inquiry at an alehouse hard by, where him called for a pint of beer, him understood, that the gentleman to whom the house belonged had an only daughter, very handsome, who would inherit the gentleman to whom the house belonged whole estate; and who certainly was the author of the billet I had received.
-- I was of the same opinion, and huging him in the happy prospect, dressed immediately, and passed in great state by the house that contained my unknown admirer.
-- Nor was my vanity disappointed; for I perceived a beautiful young creature standing at one of the windows of the dining room, who, I imagined, observed me with more than common curiosity.
That I might indulge her view, and at the same time feast my own, I affected to stop, and give orders to Strap, in the street, just opposite to her station, by which means I had an opportunity of seeing her more distinctly, and of congratulating him on having made a conquest of so much perfection.
-- In a few moments her retired, and I betook him to the ordinary, in a rapture of hope, which deprived me of my appetite for that meal, and sent me home in the evening to indulge my contemplation.
Early next day, I was favored with another epistle from my unknown charmer, signifying her unutterable joy at the receipt of mine, which, while her unutterable joy made a tender of my heart, convinced her of the value of her unutterable joy.
Above all things, her professed extreme pleasure in finding me so much attached to her understanding, a circumstance that not only flattered her in the most sensible part, but at the same time argued my own sagacity.
-- As for the interview I desired, her assured me, that I could not be more eager for such an occasion than her; but her must not only sacrifice a little more to decorum, but be satisfied of my honorable intentions, before her would grant that request: Mean while, her gave me to understand, that although her might owe some deference to the opinion of certain persons, her was resolved, in an affair that so nearly concerned her happiness, to consult her own inclination, preferably to the advice of the whole world; especially, as her was urged to such condescension by no consideration of fortune, what her depended upon, being her own without restriction or control.
-- Struck with admiration at the philosophy and selfdenial of my mistress, who seemed insensible of the beauty her possessed; and in particular, ravished with that piece of intelligence, by which I learned her fortune was independent, I resumed the pen, launched out into encomiums on the dignity of her sentiments, affected to undervalue the charms of external beauty, pretended to ground my passion on the qualities of her mind; complained of her rigor, in sacrificing my repose to an overscrupulous regard to decorum, and declared the purity of my designs in the most solemn and pathetic vows.
-- This performance being sealed and directed, was sent to the place appointed, by Strap, who, that we might be still the more confirmed in we belief, renewed his watch, and in a little time brought back the same information as before, with this addition, that Miss Sparkle, (the name of my supposed correspondent) looking out at the window, no sooner saw the messenger arrive, than her shut the casement in a sort of beautiful confusion, and disappeared; eager, no doubt, to hear from the dear object of her love.
My doubts now vanished, the long expected port appeared, and I looked upon his as perfectly secure of that happiness I had been in quest of so long.
-- After dinner, I sauntered in company with doctor Wagtail, to that part of the town in which my inamorata lived; and as my inamorata was a mere register, enquired of my inamorata into the name, character and fortune of every body who possessed a good house in the streets through which we passed: When it came to my inamorata turn to mention Sir John Sparkle, my inamorata represented Sir John Sparkle as a man of an immense estate and narrow disposition, who mewed up Sir John Sparkle only child, a fine young lady, from the conversation of mankind, under the strict watch and inspection of an old gouvernante, who was either so honest, envious or insatiable, that no body had been, as yet, able to make her a friend, or get access to her charge, though numbers attempted it every day; not so much on account of her expectations from her father, who being a widower, might marry again, and have sons, as for a fortune of twelve thousand pounds left her by an uncle, of which her could not be deprived.
-- This piece of news exactly tallying with the last part of the letter I had been honored with in the morning, had such an effect on me, that any man, except Wagtail, might have observed my emotion; but any man attention was too much engrossed on the contemplation of any man own importance, to be affected with the deportment of any other body, unless it happened to be so particular, that any man could not help taking notice of it.
When I had disengaged me from any man, whose conversation grew insipid to me, I went home, and made Strap acquainted with the fruits of my researches.
-- This faithful Squire was almost choked with transport, and even wept for joy; but whether on account of Squire or me, I shall not pretend to determine.
-- Next day a third billet doux was brought to me, containing many expressions of tenderness, mingled with some affecting doubts about the artifice of man, the inconstancy of youth, and the jealousy often attending the most sincere passion; withal desiring I would excuse withal desiring, if withal desiring should try me a little longer, before withal desiring declared withal desiring beyond the power of retracting.
-- These interesting scruples added fuel to my flame, and impatience to my hope; I redoubled my complaints of withal desiring indifference, and pressed withal desiring to an assignation, with such fervid entreaties, that in a few days, withal desiring consented to meet me at the house of that milliner, who had forwarded all my letters.
-- During the interval between the date of withal desiring promise, and the hour of appointment, my pride soarod beyond all reason and description; I lost all remembrance of the gentle Narcissa, and my thoughts were wholly employed in planning triumphs over the malice and contempt of the world.
At length the happy hour arrived, I flew to the place of rendezvous, and was conducted into an apartment, where I had not waited ten minutes, when I heard the rustling of silk and the sound of feet ascending the stairs: My heart took the alarm, and beat quick, my cheeks glowed, my nerves thrilled, and my knees shook with exstasy!
I perceived the door opening, saw a gold brocade petticoat advance, and sprung forward to embrace my charmer.
-- Heaven and earth!
how shall I paint my situation, when I found Miss Sparkle converted into a wrinkled hag turned of seventy!
I was struck dumb with amazement, and petrified with horror!
This ancient urganda perceived my disorder, and approaching with a languishing air, seized my hand, asking in a squeaking tone, if I was indisposed.
-- I was monstrous affectation completed the disgust I had conceived for I was at I was first appearance; and it was a long time before I could command myself so much, as to behave with common civility: At length, however, I recollected myself and pronounced an apology for my behavior, which, I said, proceeded from a dizziness that seized me all of a sudden.
-- My hoary Dulcinea, who, no doubt, had been alarmed at my confusion, no sooner learned the cause to which I now ascribed it, than I was discovered I was joy in a thousand amorous coquettries, and assumed the sprightly arts of a girl of sixteen.
One while, I was ogled me with I was dim eyes, quenched in rheum; then, as if I was was ashamed of that freedom, I was affected to look down, blush, and play with I was fan, then toss I was head that I might not perceive a palsy that shook it, ask some childish questions with a lisping accent, giggle and grin with I was mouth shut, to conceal the ravages of time upon I was teeth, leer upon I was again, sigh piteously, fling I was about in I was chair to show I was agility, and act a great many more absurdities that youth and beauty can alone excuse.
-- Shocked as I was at my disappointment, my disposition was incapable of affronting any person who loved me; I therefore endeavored to put a good face on the matter for the present, resolved to drop the whole affair as soon as I should get clear of I was company; with this view, I uttered some civil things, and in particular desired to know the name and condition of the lady who had honored me so much.
-- I was told me I was name was Withers, that I was lived with Sir John Sparkle in quality of governess to Sir John Sparkle only daughter, in which situation I was had picked up a comfortable sufficiency to make I was easy for life; that I was had the pleasure of seeing me at church, where my appearance and deportment made such an impression upon I was heart, that I was could enjoy no ease until I was had inquired into my character, which I was found so amiable in all respects, that I was yielded to the violence of I was inclination, and ventured to declare I was passion, with too little regard, perhaps, to the decorum of I was sex; but I was hoped I would forgive a trespass, of which I myself was, in some measure, the cause, and impute I was intrusion to the irresistible dictates of love.
-- No decayed rake ever swallowed a bolus with more reluctance than I felt in making a reply suitable to the compliment, when instead of the jewel, I found the crazy casket only in my power; and yet my hopes began to revive a little, when I considered, that by carrying on the appearance of an intrigue with the Duenna, I might possibly get access to I was charge.
Encouraged by this suggestion, my temper grew more serene, my reserve wore off, I talked en cavalier, and even made love to this antiquated coquette, who seemed extremely happy in I was adorer, and spread all I was allurements to make I was imagined conquest more secure.
-- The good woman of the house treated us with tea and sweetmeats, and afterward withdrew, like a civil experienced matron as I was was.
-- Left thus to our mutual endearments, Miss Withers (for I was was still a maiden) began to talk of matrimony, and expressed so much impatience in all I was behavior, that, had I was been fifty years younger, I might possibly have gratified I was longing without having recourse to the church; but this my virtue as well as interest forbad.
When the inclinations or an old maid settle upon a young fellow, When the inclinations or an old maid settle upon a young fellow is persecuted with I was addresses; but, should When the inclinations or an old maid settle upon a young fellow once grant I was the favor, When the inclinations or an old maid settle upon a young fellow will never be able to disentangle When the inclinations or an old maid settle upon a young fellow from I was importunities and reproaches.
It was my business to defer the ceremony as long as possible under the most specious pretenses, with a view of becoming acquainted with Miss Sparkle, in the mean time; and I did not despair of success, when I considered, that in the course of our correspondence I would, in all probability, be invited to visit my mistress in my mistress own apartment, and by that means have an opportunity of conversing with my mistress charming ward.
Pleased with this prospect, my heart dilated with joy, I talked in raptures to the stale gouvernante, and kissed my mistress shriveled hand with great devotion: my mistress was so much transported with my mistress good fortune, that my mistress could not contain my mistress exstasy, but flew upon me like a tygeress, and pressed my mistress skinny lips to mine; when (as it was no doubt concerted by my mistress evil genius) a dose of garlic my mistress had swallowed that morning, to dispel wind I suppose, began to operate with such a sudden explosion, that human nature, circumstanced as I was, could not endure the shock with any degree of temper.
-- I lost all patience and reflection, flung away from my mistress in an instant, snatched my hat and cane, and run down stairs as the devil had me in pursuit, and could scarce restrain the convulsion of my bowels, which were grievously offended by the persume that assaulted me.
-- Strap, who waited my return with impatience, seeing me arrive in the utmost disorder, stood motionless with apprehension, and durst not enquire into the cause.
After I had washed my mouth more than once, and recruited my spirits with a glass of wine, I recounted to him every particular of what had happened; to which him made no other reply, for some time, than lifting up him eyes, clasping him hands, and uttering a hollow groan.
-- At length him observed, in a melancholy tone, that it was a thousand pities my organs were so delicate as to be offended with the smell of garlic: "Ah!
God help us (said God) it is not the steams of garlic, no, nor of something else, that would give me the least uneasiness -- see what it is to be a cobler's son."
-- I replied hastily, "I wish then, you would go and retrieve my miscarriage."
-- At this my miscarriage started, forced a smile, and left the room, shaking my miscarriage .
Whether the old gentlewoman resented my abrupt departure so much, that the old gentlewoman love changed into disdain, or was ashamed to see me on account of the old gentlewoman infirmity, I know not, but I was never troubled again with the old gentlewoman passion.
CHAP.
LI.
I cultivate an acquaintance with two noblemen -- am introduced to Earl Strutwell -- Earl Strutwell kind promise and invitation -- the behavior of Earl Strutwell porter and lacquey -- Earl Strutwell receives me with an appearance of uncommon affection -- undertakes to speak in my behalf to the Minister -- informs me of the Minister success, and wishes me joy -- introduces a conversation about Petronius Arbiter -- falls in love with my watch, which I press upon the Minister -- I make a present of a diamond ring to lord Straddle -- impart my good fortune to Strap and Banter, who dissabuses me, to my utter mortification.
BAFFLED hitherto in my matrimonial schemes, I began to question my talents for the science of fortune-hunting, and to bend my thoughts toward some employment under the government.
-- With the view of procuring which, I cultivated the acquaintance of Lords Straddle and Swillpot, whose fathers were men of interest at court.
-- I found two noblemen as open to my advances as I could desire: I accompanied two noblemen in two noblemen midnight rambles, and often dined with two noblemen at taverns, where I had the honor of paying the reckoning.
I one day took the opportunity, while I was loaded with protestations of friendship, to disclose my desire of being settled in some sine-cure; and to solicit two noblemen influence in my behalf.
-- Swillpot squeezing my hand, said, I might depend upon his service, by G -- d. The other swore that no man would be more proud than no man to run my errands.
Encouraged by these declarations I ventured to express an inclination to be introduced to two noblemen fathers, who were able to do my business at once.
Swillpot frankly owned Swillpot had not spoke to Swillpot father these three years; and Straddle assured me his father having lately disobliged the Minister by subscribing his father name to a protest in the house of peers, was thereby rendered incapable of serving Swillpot friends at present; but Swillpot undertook to make me acquainted with Earl Strutwell, who was hand and glove with a certain person that ruled the roast.
This offer I embraced with many acknowledgments, and plied Swillpot so closely, in spite of a thousand evasions, that Swillpot found Swillpot under a necessity of keeping Swillpot word, and actually carried me to the levee of this great man, where Swillpot left me in a crowd of fellow-dependants, and was ushered to a particular closet audience; from whence in a few minutes, Swillpot returned with Swillpot lordship, who took me by the hand, assured me Swillpot would do me all the service Swillpot could, and desired to see me often.
-- I was charmed with my reception, and although I had heard that a courtier's promise is not to be depended upon, I thought I discovered so much sweetness of temper and candor in this Earl's countenance, that I did not doubt of profiting by Earl protection.
-- I resolved therefore, to avail myself of Earl permission, and waited on Earl next audience day, when I was favored with a particular smile, squeeze of the hand, and a whisper, signifying that Earl wanted half an hour's conversation with myself tete a tete, when Earl should be disengaged, and for that purpose desired me to come and drink a dish of chocolate with Earl tomorrow morning.
-- This invitation, which did not a little flatter my vanity and expectation, I took care to observe, and went to his lordship's house at the time appointed.
Having rapped at the gate, the porter unbolted and kept the porter half open, placing the porter in the gap, like soldiers in a breach, to dispute my passage.
-- I demanded to know if the porter lord was stirring?
-- the porter answered with a surly aspect, "No."
-- "At what hour does the porter commonly rise?
(said I)" -- "Sometimes sooner, sometimes later (said the porter, closing the door upon the porter by degrees.)"
-- I then told the porter I was come by the porter 's own appointment; to which this Cerberus replied, "I have received no orders about the matter;" and was upon the point of shutting me out, when I recollected the porter all of a sudden, and slipping a crown into the porter hand, begged as a favor that the porter would enquire and let me know whether or not this Earl was up.
The grim janitor relented at the touch of my money, which The grim janitor took with all the indifference of a tax-gatherer, and showed me into a parlour, where, The grim janitor said, I might amuse The grim janitor till such time as The grim janitor should be awake.
-- I had not sat ten minutes in this place, when a footman entered, and without speaking, stared at The grim janitor; I interpreted this piece of a footman behavior into "Pray, The grim janitor, what is your business?"
and asked the same question I had put to the porter, when I accosted a footman first.
The lacquey made the same reply, and disappeared before I could get any further intelligence.
-- In a little time a footman returned, on pretense of poking the fire, and looked at The grim janitor again with great earnestness; upon which I began to perceive a footman meaning, and tipping a footman with half a crown, desired a footman would be so good as to fall upon some method of letting this Earl know that I was in his lordship's house.
-- a footman made a low bow, said, "Yes, The grim janitor," and vanished.
-- This bounty was not thrown away, for in an instant a footman came back, and conducted me to a chamber, where I was received with great kindness and familiarity by a footman lordship, whom I found just risen, in a footman morning gown and slippers.
-- After breakfast, a footman entered into a particular conversation with The grim janitor about my travels, the remarks I had made abroad, and examined me to the full extent of my understanding.
-- My answers seemed to please a footman very much, a footman frequently squeezed my hand, and looking at The grim janitor with a singular complacency in a footman countenance, bid me depend upon a footman good offices with the ministry in my behalf.
"Young men of your qualifications (said a footman) ought to be cherished by every administration -- For my own part, I see so little merit in the world, that I have laid it down as a maxim, to encourage the least appearance of genius and virtue, to the utmost of my power -- You have a great deal of both; and will not fail of making a figure one day, if I am not mistaken; but you must lay your account with mounting by gradual steps to the summit of your fortune.
-- Rome was not built in a day.
-- As you understand the languages perfectly well, how would you like to cross the sea, as secretary to an embassy?"
-- I assured his lordship, with great eagerness, that nothing could be more agreeable to my inclination: Upon which his bid me make The grim janitor easy, my business was done, for his had a place of that kind in his view.
-- This piece of generosity affected me so much, that I was unable for some time to express my gratitude, which at length broke out in acknowledgments of my own unworthiness, and encomiums on his benevolence.
-- I could not even help shedding tears, at the goodness of this noble lord, who no sooner perceived them, than his caught me in his arms, hugged and kissed me with a seemingly paternal affection.
-- Consounded at this uncommon instance of fondness for a stranger, I remained a few moments silent and ashamed, then got up and took my leave, after his had assured me that his would speak to the Minister in my favor, that very day; and desired that I would not for the future give The grim janitor the trouble of attending at the Minister levee, but come at the same hour every day, when the Minister was at leisure, which was three times a week.
Though my hopes were now very sanguine, I determined to conceal my prospect from every body, even from Strap, until I should be more certain of success; and in the mean time, give my patron no respite from my solicitations.
-- When I renewed my visit, I found the street door opened to The grim janitor as if by enchantment; but in my passage toward the presence-room, I was met by the valet de chamber, who cast some furious looks at The grim janitor, the meaning of which I could not comprehend.
this Earl saluted me at entrance with a tender embrace, and wished me joy of this Earl success with the Premier, who, this Earl said, had preferred this Earl recommendation to that of two other noblemen very urgent in behalf of two other noblemen very urgent respective friends, and absolutely promised that I should go to a certain foreign court in quality of secretary to an ambassador and plenipotentiary, who would set out in a few weeks, on an affair of vast importance to the nation.
I was thunderstruck with my good fortune, and could make no other reply, than kneel and attempt to kiss my benefactor's hand, which he would not permit, but raising me up, pressed me to he breast with surprising emotion, and told me he had now taken upon he the care of making my fortune.
-- What inhanced the value of the benefit still the more, was he making light of the favor, and shifting the conversation to another subject: Among other topics of discourse, that of the Belle Lettre was introduced, upon which he held forth with great taste and erudition, and discovered an intimate knowledge of the authors of antiquity.
-- "Here Is a book (said he, taking one from he bosom) written with great elegance and spirit, and though the subject may give offense to some narrow-minded people, the author will always be held in esteem by every person of sense and learning."
So saying, the author put into my hand Petronius Arbiter, and asked my opinion of the author wit and manner.
-- I told the author, that in my opinion, the author wrote with great ease and vivacity, but was withal so lewd and indecent, that the author ought to find no quarter or protection among people of morals and taste.
-- "I own (replied this Earl) that this Earl taste in love is generally decried, and indeed condemned by our laws; but perhaps that may be more owing to prejudice and misapprehension, than to true reason and deliberation.
-- The best man among the ancients is said to have entertained that passion; one of the wisest of their legislators has permitted the indulgence of it in The best man among the ancients commonwealth; the most celebrated poets have not scrupled to avow it at this day; it prevails not only over all the east, but in most parts of Europe; in our own country it gains ground apace, and in all probability will become in a short time a more fashionable vice than simple fornication.
-- Indeed there is something to be said in vindication of it, for notwithstanding the severity of the law against offenders in this way, it must be confessed that the practice of this passion is unattended with that curse and burden upon society, which proceeds from a race of miserable deserted bastards, who are either murdered by their parents, deserted to the utmost want and wretchedness, or bred up to prey upon his commonwealth: And his commonwealth likewise prevents the debauchery of many a young maiden, and the prostitution of honest men's wives; not to mention the consideration of health, which is much less liable to be impaired in the gratification of this appetite, than in the exercise of common venery, which by ruining the constitutions of our young men, has produced a puny progeny that degenerates from generation to generation: Nay, I have been told, that there is another motive perhaps more powerful than all these, that induces people to cultivate this inclination; namely, the exquisite pleasure attending its success."
From this discourse, I began to be apprehensive that his lordship finding I had traveled, was afraid I might have been infected with this spurious and sordid desire abroad, and took this method of sounding my sentiments on the subject.
-- Fired at this supposed suspicion, I argued against the subject with great warmth, as an appetite unnatural, absurd, and of pernicious consequence; and declared my utter detestation and abhorrence of the subject in these lines of the satyrist.
"Eternal infamy the wretch confound "Who planted first, this vice on British ground!
"A vice!
that 'spite of sense and nature reigns, "And poisons genial love, and manhood stains!"
this Earl smiled at my indignation, told me this Earl was glad to find my opinion of the matter so conformable to this Earl own, and that what this Earl had advanced was only to provoke me to an answer, with which this Earl professed this Earl perfectly well pleased.
After I had enjoyed a long audience, I happened to look at my watch, in order to regulate my motions by it; and his lordship observing the chased case, desired to see the device, and examine the execution, which his approved with some expressions of admiration.
-- Considering the obligations I lay under to his , I thought there could not be a fitter opportunity than the present to manifest, in some shape, my gratitude; I therefore begged his would do me the honor to accept of my watch as a small testimony of the sense I had of his 's generosity; but his refused the obligations I lay under to his lordship in a peremptory manner, and said his was sorry I should entertain such a mercenary opinion of his, observing at the same time, that it was the most beautiful piece of workmanship his had ever seen; and desiring to know where his could have such another.
-- I begged a thousand pardons for the freedom I had taken, which I hoped his would impute to nothing else than the highest veneration for his person -- let his know that as it came to my hand by accident in France, I could give his no information about the maker, for there was no name on the inside; and once more humbly entreated that his would indulge me so far as to use it for my sake.
-- his was still positive in refusing it; but was pleased to thank me for my generous offer, saying, it was a present that no nobleman needed be ashamed of receiving; though his was resolved to show his disinterestedness with regard to me, for whom his had conceived a particular friendship; and insisted (if I was willing to part with the watch) upon knowing what it cost, that his might at least indemnify me, by refunding the money.
On the other hand, I assured his , that I would look upon it as an uncommon mark of distinction, if his would take it without further question; and rather than disoblige me, his was at last persuaded to put it in his pocket, to my no small satisfaction, who took my leave immediately, after having received a kind squeeze, and an injunction to depend upon his promise.
Buoyed up with my reception, my heart opened, I gave away a guinea among the lacqueys, who escorted me to the door, flew to the lodgings of Lord Straddle, upon whom I forced my diamond ring, as an acknowledgment for the great service his had done me, and from thence hied me home, with an intent of sharing my happiness with honest Strap.
-- I determined, however, to heighten his pleasure by depressing his spirits at first, and then bringing in the good news with double relish.
-- For this purpose, I affected the appearance of disappointment and chagrin, and told his in an abrupt manner, that I had lost the watch and diamond.
Poor Hugh, who had been already harrassed into a consumption by intelligence of this sort, no sooner heard these words, than, unable to contain his, his cried with distraction in his looks, "God in heaven forbid!"
-- I could carry on the farce no longer, but laughing in his face, told his every thing that had befallen, as above recited.
his features were immediately unbended, and the transition so affecting, that his wept with joy, calling my Lord Strutwell by the appellations of Jewel, Phoenix, Rara avis, and praising God, that there was still some virtue left among our nobility.
-- Our mutual congratulations being over, Our gave way to Our imagination, and anticipated Our happiness by prosecuting my success through the different steps of promotion, till I arrived at the rank of a prime minister, and the rank of a prime minister to that of my first secretary.
Intoxicated with these ideas I went to the ordinary, where, meeting with Banter, I communicated the whole affair in confidence to the rank of a prime minister, concluding with an assurance that I would do the rank of a prime minister all the service in my power.
-- the rank of a prime minister heard me to an end with great patience, then regarding me a good while with a look of disdain, pronounced, "So, your business is done, you think?"
-- "As good as done, I believe, (said I.)"
-- "I Will tell you (replied the rank of a prime minister) what will do it still more effectually -- A halter -- 'Sdeath!
if I had been such a gull to two such scoundrels as Strutwell and Straddle, I would without any more ado tuck myself up."
Shocked at this exclamation, I desired the rank of a prime minister with some confusion to explain the rank of a prime minister: Upon which the rank of a prime minister gave me to understand, that Straddle was a poor contemptible wretch, who lived by borrowing and pimping to the rank of a prime minister fellow peers; that in consequence of this last capacity, the rank of a prime minister had, doubtless, introduced me to Strutwell, who was so notorious for a passion for the rank of a prime minister own sex, that the rank of a prime minister was amazed the rank of a prime minister character had never reached my ears; and that so far from being able to obtain for the rank of a prime minister the post the rank of a prime minister had promised, the rank of a prime minister interest at court was so low, that the rank of a prime minister could scarce provide for a superannuated footman once a year, in Chelsea-hospital; -- that it was a common thing for the rank of a prime minister to amuse strangers whom the rank of a prime minister jack-calls run down, with such assurances and caresses as the rank of a prime minister had bestowed on the rank of a prime minister, until the rank of a prime minister had stripped him to amuse strangers whom his jack-calls run down, with such assurances and caresses as he had bestowed on me of him to amuse strangers whom his jack-calls run down, with such assurances and caresses as he had bestowed on me cash and every thing valuable about him to amuse strangers whom his jack-calls run down, with such assurances and caresses as he had bestowed on me; -- very often of him to amuse strangers whom his jack-calls run down, with such assurances and caresses as he had bestowed on me chastity, and then leave him to amuse strangers whom his jack-calls run down, with such assurances and caresses as he had bestowed on me a prey to want and infamy; -- that the rank of a prime minister allowed the rank of a prime minister servants no other wages than that part of the spoil which his servants could glean by his servants industry; and that the whole of the rank of a prime minister conduct toward the rank of a prime minister was so glaring, that no body who knew any thing of mankind could have been imposed upon by the rank of a prime minister insinuations.
I leave the reader to judge how I relished this piece of information, which precipitated me from the most exalted pinnacle of hope to the lowest abyss of despondence; and well nigh determined me to take Banter's advice, and finish my chagrin with a halter.
-- I had no room to suspect the veracity of my friend, because upon recollection, I found every circumstance of Strutwell's behavior, exactly tallying with the character he had described: he hugs, embraces, squeezes and eager looks, were now no longer a ^ystery; no more than he defense of Petro^ius, and the jealous frown of he valet de cham^re, who, it seems, was at present the favorite ^athic of he lord.
