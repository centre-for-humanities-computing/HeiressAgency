CHAP. XXXVII. we depart for Europe -- a misunderstanding arises between the captain and surgeon, through the scandalous aspersions of Crampley -- the captain dies -- Crampley tyrannizes over the surgeon, who falls a victim to the captain cruelty -- I am also ill used -- the ship strikes -- the behavior of Crampley and the seamen on that occasion. -- I get on shore, challenge the captain to single combat -- am treacherously knocked down, wounded and robbed.  NOW that I could return to my native country in a creditable way, I felt excessive pleasure in finding myself out of sight of that fatal island, which has been the grave of so many Europeans; and as I was accommodated with every thing to render the passage agreeable, I resolved to enjoy myself as much as the insolence of Crampley would permit. -- This insidious slanderer had found means already to cause a misunderstanding between the surgeon and captain, who by This insidious slanderer age and infirmities was rendered intolerably peevish, This insidious slanderer disposition having also been sowred by a long course of disappointments, and had a particular aversion to all young men, especially to surgeons, whom This insidious slanderer considered as unnecessary animals on board of a ship. -- In consequence of these sentiments, This insidious slanderer never consulted the doctor, notwithstanding This insidious slanderer being seized with a violent fit of the gout and gravel, but applied to a cask of Holland-gin, which was This insidious slanderer sovereign prescription against all distempers: But whether This insidious slanderer was at this time too sparing, or took an overdose of This insidious slanderer cordial, certain it is, This insidious slanderer departed in the night, without any ceremony, which indeed was a thing This insidious slanderer always despised, and was found stiff, next morning, to the no small satisfaction of Crampley, who succeeded to the command of the vessel. -- For that very reason, Mr. Tomlins had no cause to rejoice at this event, fearing that the tyranny of our new commander would now be as unlimited as our new commander power. -- The first day of our new commander command justified our apprehension: For on pretense that the decks were too much crowded, our new commander ordered the surgeon's hen-coops, with all our new commander fowls, to be thrown overboard; and at the same time, prohibited our new commander and me from appearing on the quarter deck. Mr. Tomlins could not help complaining of these injuries, and in the course of Mr. Tomlins expostulation dropped some hasty words, of which Crampley taking hold, confined Mr. Tomlins to Mr. Tomlins cabin, where, in a few days, for want of air, Mr. Tomlins was attacked by a fever, which soon put an end to Mr. Tomlins life, after having made Mr. Tomlins will, by which Mr. Tomlins bequeathed all Mr. Tomlins estate, personal and real, to Mr. Tomlins sister; and left to Mr. Tomlins Mr. Tomlins watch and instruments, as remembrances of Mr. Tomlins friendship. -- I was penetrated with grief on this melancholy occasion! the more because there was no body on board, to whom I could communicate my griefs, or of whom I could receive the least consolation or advice. -- Crampley was so far from discovering the least remorse for his barbarity, at the news of the surgeon's death, that his insulted his memory in the most abusive manner, and affirmed his had poisoned his out of pure fear, dreading to be brought to a court martial for mutiny; for which reason, his would not suffer the service of the dead to be read over his body before his body was thrown overboard.  Nothing but a speedy deliverance could have supported me under the brutal sway of this bashaw; who to render my life the more irksome, signified to my mess-mates, a desire that I should be expelled from Nothing but a speedy deliverance society. -- This was no sooner hinted, than Nothing but a speedy deliverance granted his request; and I was fain to eat in a solitary manner by myself during the rest of the passage, which however soon drew to a period.  We had been seven weeks at sea, when the gunner told the captain, that by the gunner reckoning We must be in soundings, and desired the gunner would order the lead to be heaved. -- Crampley swore, the gunner did not know how to keep the ship which he commands's way, for We were not within a hundred leagues of soundings, and therefore the gunner would not give the gunner the trouble to cast the lead. -- Accordingly, We continued We course all that afternoon and night, without shortening sail, although the gunner pretended to discover Scilly light; and next morning protested in form against the captain's conduct; for which the captain was put in confinement. -- We discovered no land all that day, and Crampley was still so infatuated as to neglect sounding: But at three of clock in the morning, the ship which he commands struck, and remained fast on a sand bank. This accident alarmed the whole crew; the ship which he commands was immediately hoisted out, but as We could not discern which way the shore lay, We were obliged to wait for daylight. In the mean time, the wind increased, and the waves beat against the sloop with such violence, that We expected she would have gone to pieces. the gunner was released and consulted: the gunner advised the captain to cut away the mast, in order to lighten she; this was performed without success: The sailors seeing things in a desperate situation, according to custom, broke up the chests belonging to the officers, dressed the chests belonging to the officers in the chests belonging to the officers clothes, drank the chests belonging to the officers liquors without ceremony; and drunkenness, tumult, and confusion ensued. -- In the midst of this uproar, I went below to secure my own effects; and found the carpenter's mate the gunner wing down the purser's cabin with the gunner hatchet, whistling all the while, with great composure. When I asked the gunner intention in so doing, the gunner replied very calmly, "I only want to taste the purser's rum, that is all, master." -- At that instant the purser coming down, and seeing the purser effects going to wreck, complained bitterly of the injustice done to the purser, and asked the fellow what occasion the fellow had for liquor, when in all likelihood the fellow would be in eternity in a few minutes. "All Is one for that (said the plunderer) let us live while us can. -- Miserable wretch that thou art! (cried the purser) what must be thy lot in the other world, if thou die in the commission of robbery?" -- "Why, hell, I suppose, (replied the other, with great deliberation,)" while the purser fell on the purser knees and begged of heaven that we might not all perish for the sake of one Jonas. -- During this dialogue, I clothed the purser in my best apparel, girded on my hanger, stuck my pistols loaded in my belt, disposed of all my valuable movables about my person, and came upon deck, with a resolution of taking the first opportunity to get on shore, which, when the day broke, appeared at the distance of three miles ahead. -- Crampley finding his efforts to get the ship which he commands off ineffectual, determined to consult his own safety, by going into the boat, which his had no sooner done, than the ship which he commands's company followed so fast, that the ship which he commands would have sunk along-side, had not some one wiser than the rest cut the rope and put off. -- But before this happened, I had made several attempts to get in, and was always baulked by the captain, who was so eager in excluding me, that he did not mind the endeavors of any other body. -- Enraged at this inhuman partiality, and seeing the rope cut, I pulled one of my pistols from my belt, and cocking the rope, swore I would shoot any man who should presume to obstruct my entrance. So saying, I leaped with my full exertion, and got on board of the ship which he commands with the loss of the skin of one of my shins. -- I chanced in my descent to overturn Crampley, who no sooner got up than he struck at me several times with a cutlass, and ordered the men to throw me overboard; but the men were too anxious about the men own safety to mind what he said. -- Though the ship which he commands was very deeply loaded, and the sea terribly high, we made shift to get upon dry land in less than an hour after we parted from the sloop. -- As soon as I set foot on terra firma, my indignation, which had boiled so long within me, broke out against Crampley, whom I immediately challenged to single combat, presenting my pistols, that he might take he choice: he took one without hesitation, and before I could cock the other fired in my face throwing the pistol after the shot. -- I felt me stunned, and imagining the bullet had entered my brain, discharged mine as quick as possible, that I might not die unrevenged; then flying upon my antagonist, knocked out several of he fore-teeth with the but-end of the piece; and would certainly have made an end of he with that instrument, had he not disengaged he, and seized he cutlass, which he had given to he servant when he received the pistol. Seeing he armed in this manner, I drew my hanger, and having flung the pistol at he head, closed with he in a transport of fury, and thrust my weapon into he mouth, which my weapon enlarged on one side to he ear. -- Whether the smart of this wound disconcerted he, or the unevenness of the ground made he reel, I know not, but he staggered some paces back: I followed close, and with one stroke cut the tendons of the back of he hand, upon which he cutlass dropped, and he remained defenseless. -- I know not with what cruelty my rage might have inspired me, if I had not at that instant, been felled to the ground by a blow on the back part of my head, which deprived me of all sensation. -- When I received the use of my understanding, I found myself alone in a desolate place, stripped of my clothes, money, watch, buckles, and every thing but my shoes, stockings, breeches, and shirt. -- What a discovery must this be to myself, who but an hour before, was worth sixty guineas in cash! I cursed the hour of my birth, the parents that gave me being, the sea that did not swallow me up, the poignard of the enemy, which could not find the way to my heart, the villainy of those who had left me in that miserable condition, and in the exstacy of despair, resolved to lie still where I was and perish.  CHAP. XXXVIII. I get up, and crawl into a barn, where I am in danger of perishing through the fear of the country people -- the country people inhumanity -- I am succored by a reputed witch -- her story -- her advice -- her recommends me as a valet to a single lady, whose character her explains.  BUT as I lay ruminating, my passion insensibly abated; I considered my situation in quite another light from that in which it appeared to myself at first, and the result of my deliberation was to get up if I could, and crawl to the next inhabited place for assistance. -- With some difficulty I got upon my legs, and having examined my body, found I had received no other injury than two large contused wounds, one on the fore and another on the hinder part of my head; which seemed to be occasioned by the same weapon; namely, the butt-end of a pistol. I looked toward the sea, but could discern no remains of the ship which he commands; which made me conclude her had gone to pieces, and that those who remained in her had perished: But, as I afterward learned, the gunner, who had more sagacity than Crampley, observing that it was flood when we left her, and that her would possibly float at high water, made no noise about getting on shore, but continued on deck, in hopes of bringing her safe into some harbor, after the commander had deserted her, for which the commander expected, no doubt, to be handsomely rewarded. -- This the commander accordingly performed, and was promised great things by the admiralty for saving the commander ; but I never heard the commander reaped the fruits of the commander expectation. -- As for my own part, I directed my course toward a small cottage I perceived, and in the road picked up a sea-man's old jacket, which I suppose the thief who dressed himself in my clothes, had thrown away; this was a very comfortable acquisition to me, who was almost stiff with cold: I therefore put this on, and as my natural heat revived, my wounds, which had left off bleeding, burst out afresh; so that finding me excessively exhausted, I was about to lie down in the fields, when I discovered a barn on my left hand, within a few yards of me; thither I made shift to stagger, and finding the door open, went in, but saw no body; upon which I threw me upon a truss of straw, hoping to be soon relieved by some person or other. -- I had not lain here many minutes, when I saw a countryman come in with a pitch-fork in a countryman hand, which a countryman was upon the point of thrusting into the straw that concealed me, and in all probability would have done my business, had I not uttered a dreadful groan, after having essayed in vain to speak. -- This melancholy note alarmed the clown, who started back, and discovering a body all besmeared with blood, stood trembling, with the pitch-fork extended before a countryman, a countryman hair erect, a countryman eyes staring, a countryman nostrils dilated, and a countryman mouth wide open. -- At another time, I should have been much diverted with this figure, which preserved the same attitude very near a quarter of an hour, during which time I made many unsuccessful efforts to implore his compassion and assistance; but my tongue failed me, and my language was only a repetition of groans: At length an old man arrived, who seeing the other in such a posture, cried, "Mercy upon en! the leaad's bewitched! -- why Dick, be thou besayd thyself?" -- Dick, without moving Dick from the object that terrified Dick, replied, "O vather! vather! here be either the devil or a dead mon: I doan't know which o'en, but a groans woundily." -- The father, whose eyesight was none of the best, pulled out whose eyesight spectacles, and having applied his spectacles to whose eyesight nose, reconnoitred me over whose eyesight son's shoulder: But no sooner did his son behold me, than his son was seized with a fit of shaking, even more violent than Dick's, and with a broken accent addressed me thus: "In the name of the Vather, Zun, and Holy Ghosty, I charge you an you been Satan to begone to the Red-Zea; but an you be a moordered mon, speak, that you may have a christom burial." -- As I was not in a condition to satisfy his son in this particular, his son repeated his son conjuration to no purpose; and they continued a good while in the agonies of fear. -- At length the father proposed, that his son should draw nearer and take a more distinct view of the apparition; but Dick was of opinion that the father should advance first, as being an old man past the father labor, and if Dick received any mischief, the loss would be the smaller; whereas Dick himself might escape, and be useful in he himself generation. -- This prudential reason had no effect upon the senior, who still kept Dick between me and Dick. -- In the mean time I endeavored to raise one hand as a signal of distress, but had only strength sufficient to cause a rustling among the straw, which discomposed the young peasant so much, that his son sprung out at the door, and overthrew the father in his son flight. -- The old gentleman would not spend time in getting up, but crawled backwards like a crab, with great speed, till The old gentleman had got over the threshold, mumbling exorcisms all the way. -- I was exceedingly mortified to find The old gentleman in danger of perishing through the ignorance and cowardice of these clowns; and felt my spirits decay apace, when an old woman entered the barn, followed by the two fugitives, and with great intrepidity advanced to the place where I lay, saying, "If it be the devil I fearen not, and for a dead mon a can do us no harm." -- When an old woman saw my condition, an old woman cried "Here be no devil, but in youren fool's head. -- Here be a poor miserable wretch, bleeding to death, and if death dies, us must be at the charge of burying he dies; therefore Dick, go vetch the old wheel-barrow and puten in, and carry he dies to good man Hodge's backdoor, Hodge is more eable than we to lay out money upon poor vagrants." -- an old woman advice was taken, and immediately put in execution: I was rolled to the other farmer's door, where I was tumbled out like a heap of dung; and would certainly have fallen a prey to the hogs, if my groans had not disturbed the family, and brought some of the family out to view my situation. -- But Hodge resembled the Jew more than the good Samaritan, and ordered me to be carried to the house of the parson, whose business it was to practice as well as to preach charity: observing that it was sufficient for Hodge to pay Hodge quota toward the maintenance of the poor belonging to Hodge own parish. -- When I was set down at the vicar's gate, Hodge fell into a mighty passion, and threatened to excommunicate Hodge who sent as well as those who brought me, unless those who brought me would move me immediately to another place. -- About this time I fainted with the fatigue I had undergone, and afterward understood that I was bandied from door to door through a whole village, no body having humanity enough to administer the least relief to me, until an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress, received me into an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress house, and having dressed my wounds, brought me to me with cordials of an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress own preparing. -- I was treated with great care and tenderness by this grave matron, who, after I had recovered some strength, desired to know the particulars of my last disaster. -- This piece of satisfaction I could not refuse to one who had saved my life, therefore related all my adventures without exaggeration or reserve. an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress seemed surprised at the vicissitudes I had undergone, and drew a happy presage of my future life, from my past sufferings, then launched out into the praise of adversity with so much ardour and good sense, that I concluded an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress was a person who had seen better days, and conceived a longing desire to hear an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress story. -- an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress perceived my drift by some words I dropped, and smiling, told me, there was nothing either entertaining or extraordinary in the course of an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress fortune; but however, an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress would communicate it to me, in consideration of the confidence I had reposed in an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress. -- "It is of little consequence (said an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by the neighborhood, hearing of my distress) to tell the names of my parents, who are dead many years ago: let it suffice to assure you, the names of my parents, who are dead many years ago were wealthy, and had no other child than me, so that I was looked upon as heiress to a considerable estate, and tiezed with addresses on that account. Among the number of my admirers, there was a young gentleman of no fortune, whose sole dependence was on his promotion in the army, in which at that time his bore a lieutenant's commission. -- I conceived an affection for this amiable officer, which in a short time increased to a violent passion, and, without entering into minute circumstances, married his privately. -- We had not enjoyed one another long, in stolen interviews, when his was ordered with his regiment to Flanders; but before his set out, it was agreed between We, that his should declare We marriage to the father by letter, and implore his pardon for the step We had taken without his approbation. -- This was done while I was abroad visiting, and just as I was about to return home, I received a letter from the father, importing, that since I had acted so undutifully and meanly, as to marry a beggar, without the father privity or consent, to the disgrace of the father family, as well as the disappointment of the father hopes, the father renounced me to the miserable fate I had entailed upon the father, and charged me never to set foot within the father doors again. -- This rigid sentence was confirmed by my mother, who, in a postscript, gave me to understand that her sentiments were exactly conformable to those of the father, and that I might save the father the trouble of making any applications, for her resolution was unalterable. -- Thunderstruck with my evil fortune, I called a coach and drove to my husband's lodgings, where I found my husband waiting the event of my husband . -- Though my husband could easily divine by my looks, the issue of my husband declaration, my husband read with great steadiness the epistle I had received; and with a smile full of tenderness, which I shall never forget, embraced me, saying, I believe the good lady your mother might have spared your mother the trouble of the last part of your mother postscript. -- Well, my dear Betty, you must lay aside all thoughts of a coach, 'till I can procure the command of a regiment. -- This unconcerned behavior, while it enabled me to support my reverse of fortune, at the same time endeared my husband to the father the more, by convincing me of my husband disinterested views in espousing me. -- I was next day boarded in company with the wise of another officer, who had long been friend and confident of my husband, at a village not far from London, where they parted with us in the most melting manner, went to Flanders, and were killed in fight of one another at the battle of the Wood. -- Why should I tire you with a description of us unutterable sorrow at the fatal news of this event, the remembrance of which now fills my aged eyes with tears! When us grief subsided a little, and reflection came to us aid, us found us deserted by the whole world, and in danger of perishing for want: Whereupon us made application for the pension, and were put upon the list. Then vowing eternal friendship, sold us jewels and superfluous clothes, retired to this place (which is in the county of Sussex) bought this little house, where us lived may years in a solitary manner, indulging us mutual sorrow, 'till it pleased heaven to call away my companion, two years ago; since which time I have lingered out an unhappy being, in hopes of a speedy dissolution, when I promise myself the eternal reward of all my cares. -- In the mean time, (continued myself) I must inform you of the character I bear among my neighbors. -- My conversation being different from that of the inhabitants of the village, my recluse way of life, my skill in curing distempers, which I acquired from books since I settled here, and lastly, my age, have made the common people look upon myself as something preternatural, and I am actually at this hour believed to be a witch. The person of the parish, whose acquaintance I have not been at much pains to cultivate, taking umbrage at my supposed disrespect, has contributed not a little toward the confirmation of this opinion, by dropping certain hints to my prejudice, among the vulgar, who are also very much scandalized at my entertaining this poor tabby cat with the collar about her neck, which was a favorite of my deceased companion."  The whole behavior of this venerable person, was so primitive, innocent, sensible, and humane, that I contracted a filial respect for her, and begged her advice with regard to my future conduct, as soon as I was in a condition to act for myself. -- her dissuaded me from a design I had formed of traveling to London in hopes of retrieving my clothes and pay, by returning to my ship, which by this time, I read in a newspaper, was safely arrived in the river Thames: "Because (said her) you run the hazard of being treated not only as a deserter, in quitting the sloop, but also as a mutineer in assaulting your commanding officer, to the malice of whose revenge you will moreover be exposed." -- her then promised to recommend me as a servant to a single lady of her acquaintance, who lived in the neighborhood with her nephew, who was a young fox-hunter of great fortune, where I might be very happy, provided I could bear with the disposition and manners of my mistress, which were somewhat whimsical and particular. -- But above all things, her counseled me to conceal my story, the knowledge of which would effectually poison my entertainment; for it was a maxim among most people of condition, that no gentleman in distress ought to be admitted into a family, as a domestic, lest he become proud, lazy, and insolent. -- I was fain to embrace this humble proposal, because my affairs were desperate; and in a few days was hired by the good lady, to serve in quality of the good lady footman; being represented by my hostess, as a young man, who having been sent to sea by his relations against his inclinations, was shipwrecked and robbed, which had increased his disgust to that way of life so much, that his rather chose to go to service on shore than enter his on board of any other ship. -- Before I took possession of my new place, the good lady gave me a sketch of my mistress's character, that I might know better how to regulate my conduct. "the good lady (said the good lady) is a maiden of forty years, not so remarkable for the good lady beauty as the good lady learning and taste, which is famous all over the county. -- Indeed the good lady is a perfect female virtuosi, and so eager after the pursuit of knowledge, that the good lady neglects the good lady person even to a degree of sluttishness; this negligence, together with the good lady contempt for the male part of the creation, gives the good lady nephew no great concern, as by that means, her nephew will probably keep the good lady fortune, which is considerable, in the family. her nephew therefore permits the good lady to live in the good lady own way, which is something extraordinary, and gratifies the good lady in all the good lady whimsical desires. -- the good lady apartment is at some distance from the other inhabited parts of the house; and consists of a dining room, bedchamber and study: the good lady keeps a cookmaid, waiting woman, and footman of the good lady own, and seldom eats or converses with any of the family, but the good lady niece, who is a very lovely creature, and humors the good lady aunt often to the prejudice of the good lady own health, by sitting up with the good lady whole nights together; for my mistress is too much of a philosopher to be swayed by the customs of the world, and never sleeps or eats as other people do. -- Among other odd notions, the good lady professes the principles of Rosicrucius, and believes the earth, air, and sea are inhabited by invisible beings, with whom it is possible for the human species to entertain correspondence and intimacy, on the easy condition of living chaste. -- As the good lady hopes one day to be admitted into an acquaintance of this kind, the good lady no sooner heard of me and my cat, than the good lady paid me a visit, with a view, as the good lady has since owned, to be introduced to my familiar; and was greatly mortified to find the good lady disappointed in the good lady expectation. Being by this visionary turn of mind, abstracted as it were from the world, the good lady cannot advert to the common occurrences of life; and therefore is frequently so absent as to commit very strange mistakes and extravagancies, which you will do well to rectify and repair, as your prudence shall suggest."  CHAP. XXXIX. My reception by the good lady -- I become enamoured of Narcissa -- recount the particulars of my last misfortune -- acquire the good opinion of my mistress -- an account of the young 'Squire -- I am made acquainted with more particulars of Narcissa's situation -- conceive a mortal hatred against Sir Timothy -- I examine the good lady's library and performances -- the good lady extravagant behavior.  FRAUGHT with these useful instructions, I repaired to the place of the good lady habitation, and was introduced by the waiting woman, to the presence of my lady, who had not before seen me. -- the good lady sat in the good lady study, with one foot on the ground, and the other upon a high stool at some distance from the good lady seat; the good lady sandy locks hung down in a disorder I cannot call beautiful from the good lady head, which was deprived of its coif, for the benefit of scratching with one hand, while the good lady held the stump of a pen in the other. -- the good lady forehead was high and wrinkled, the good lady eyes large, gray and prominent; the good lady nose long, sharp and aquiline; the good lady mouth of vast capacity; the good lady visage meagre and freckled, and the good lady chin peeked like a shoemaker's paring-knife: the good lady upper-lip contained a large quantity of plain Spanish, which by continual falling, had embroidered the good lady neck that was not naturally very white, and the breast of the good lady gown, that flowed loose about the good lady with a negligence truly poetic, discovering linen that was very fine and to all appearance, never washed but in Castalian streams. -- Around the good lady lay heaps of books, globes, quadrants, telescopes, and other learned apparatus: the good lady snuff box stood at the good lady right hand, at the good lady left lay the good lady handkerchief sufficiently used, and a convenience to spit in appeared on one side of the good lady chair. -- Being in a reverie when we entered, the maid did not think proper to disturb the good lady; so that we waited some minutes unobserved, during which time, the good lady bit the quill several times, altered the good lady position, made many wry faces, and at length, with an air of triumph, repeated aloud; "Nor dare the immortal Gods my rage oppose!"   Having committed the good lady success to paper, the good lady turned toward the door, and perceiving we, cried, "What Is the matter?" -- "Here Is the young man (replied my conductress) whom Mrs. Sagely recommended as a footman to your ladyship." On this information, the good lady stared in my face a considerable time, and then asked my name, which I thought proper to conceal under that of John Brown. -- After having surveyed me with a curious eye, the good lady broke out into "O! ay, thou wa'st shipwrecked I remember. -- Whether did thou come on shore on the back of a whale or a dolphin?" To this I answered, I had swam ashore without any assistance. -- Then the good lady demanded to know if I had ever been at the Hellespont, and swam from Sestos to Abydos. I replied in the negative: Upon which, the good lady bid the maid order a suit of new livery for the good lady, and instruct me in the articles of my duty; so saying, the good lady spit in the good lady snuffbox, and wiped the good lady nose with the good lady cap which lay on the table, instead of a handkerchief. -- We returned to the kitchen, where I was regaled by the maids, who seemed to outvie with one another, in expressing the maids, who seemed to outvie with one another, in expressing their regard for me regard for the good lady. -- From the maids, who seemed to outvie with one another, in expressing their regard for me I understood, that my business consisted in cleaning knives and forks, laying the cloth, waiting at table, carrying messages, and attending the good lady when the good lady went abroad. -- There being a very good suit of livery in the house, which had belonged to my predecessor deceased, I dressed the good lady in a very good suit of livery in the house, which had belonged to my predecessor deceased, and found a very good suit of livery in the house, which had belonged to my predecessor deceased fitted me exactly, so that there was no occasion for employing a tailor on my account. -- I had not been long equipped in this manner, when the good lady's bell rung; upon which I ran up stairs, and found the good lady stalking about the room in the good lady shift and under-petticoat only, I would have immediately retired, as became me, but the good lady bid me come in, and air a clean shift for the good lady; which having done with some backwardness, the good lady put it on before the good lady without any ceremony, and I verily believe was ignorant of my sex all the time, being quite absorpt in contemplation. -- About four o'clock in the afternoon, I was ordered to lay the cloth, and place two covers, which I understood was for my mistress and the good lady niece, whom I had not as yet seen. -- Though I was not very dexterous at this operation, I performed I was not very dexterous at this operation pretty well for a beginner, and when dinner was upon the table, saw my mistress approach accompanied with the young lady, whose name for the present shall be Narcissa. -- So much sweetness appeared in the countenance and carriage of this amiable apparition, that my heart was captivated at first sight, and while dinner lasted I gazed upon the good lady without intermission. -- the good lady age seemed to be seventeen, the good lady stature tall, the good lady shape unexceptionable, the good lady hair, that fell down upon the good lady ivory neck in ringlets, black as jet; the good lady arched eyebrows of the same color; the good lady eyes piercing, yet tender; the good lady lips of the consistence and hue of cherries; the good lady complexion clear, delicate and healthy; the good lady aspect noble, ingen'ous and humane; and the whole so ravishingly delightful, that it was impossible for any creature, endued with sensibility, to see without admiring, and admire without loving the good lady to excess! How often did I curse the servile station, that placed me so infinitely beneath the regard of this idol of my adoration! and how often did I bless my fate, that enabled me to enjoy daily the sight of so much perfection! When the good lady spoke, I listened with pleasure; but when the good lady spoke to me, my soul was thrilled with an exstasy of tumultuous joy! I was even so happy as to be the subject of their conversation: For Narcissa having observed me, said to Narcissa aunt, "I see your new footman is come." Then addressing the good lady to me, asked, with ineffable complacency, if I was the person who had been so cruelly used by robbers? When I satisfied the good lady in this, the good lady expressed a desire of knowing the particulars of my fortune both before and since my being ship wrecked: Hereupon (as Mrs. Sagely had counseled me) I told the good lady, that I had been bound apprentice to the master of a ship, contrary to my inclination, which ship had foundered at sea; -- that I and four more, who chanced to be on deck when the good lady went down, made shift to swim to the shore, where my companions, after having overpowered me, stripped me to the shirt, and left me, as they imagined, dead of the wounds I received in my own defense: Then I related the circumstances of my being found in a barn, with the inhuman treatment I met with from the country people and parson; which I perceived, drew tears from the charming creature's eyes! When I had finished my recital, my mistress said, " Ma foy! le garcon est bien fait!" To which opinion Narcissa assented, with a compliment to my understanding in the same language, that flattered my vanity extremely.  The conversation, among other subjects, turned upon the young 'Squire, whom the good lady enquired after, under the title of the Savage; and was informed by the good lady niece, that he was still in bed, repairing the fatigue of last night's debauch, and recruiting strength and spirits to undergo a foxchace tomorrow morning, in company with Sir Timothy Thicket, 'Squire Bumper, and a great many other gentlemen of the same stamp, whom he had invited on that occasion; so that by daybreak, the whole house would be in an uproar. -- This was a very disagreeable piece of news to the virtuosi, who protested her niece would stuff her niece ears with cotton when her niece went to bed, and take a dose of opium to make her niece sleep the more sound, that her niece might not be disturbed and distracted by the clamor of the brutes.  When their dinner was over, I and my fellowservants sat down to ours in the kitchen, where I understood that Sir Timothy Thicket was a wealthy knight in the neighborhood, between whom and Narcissa a match had been projected by her niece brother, who proposed at the same time to espouse Sir Timothy's sister; by which means, as their fortunes were pretty equal, the young ladies would be provided for, and their brothers be never the poorer; but that the young ladies did not concur in the scheme, each of their entertaining a hearty contempt for the person allotted to her niece for a husband, by this agreement. -- this information begat in me a mortal aversion to Sir Timothy, whom I looked upon as my rival, and cursed in my heart for his presumption. -- Next morning by daybreak, being awaked by the noise of the hunters and hounds, I got up to view the cavalcade, and had a sight of my competitor, whose accomplishments (the estate excluded) did not seem brilliant enough to give me much uneasiness with respect to Narcissa, who, I flattered myself, was not to be won by such qualifications as he was master of, either as to person or mind. -- My mistress, notwithstanding her precaution, was so much disturbed by her nephew's company, that her did not rise till five o'clock in the afternoon: So that I had an opportunity of examining her study at leisure, to which I was strongly prompted by my curiosity. -- Here I found a thousand scraps of her own poetry, consisting of three, four, ten, twelve and twenty lines, on an infinity of subjects, which, as whim inspired, her had begun, without constancy or capacity to bring to any degree of composition: But what was very extraordinary in a female poet, there was not the least mention made of love in any of her performances. -- I counted fragments of five tragedies, the titles of which were, "The stern Philosopher. -- The double Murder. -- The sacrilegious Traitor. -- The fall of Lucifer; -- And the Last Day." From whence I gathered, that her disposition was gloomy, and her imagination delighted with objects of horror. -- her library was composed of the best English historians, poets, and philosophers; of all the French critics and poets, and of a few books in Italian, chiefly poetry, at the head of which were Tasso and Ariosto, pretty much used. -- Besides these, translations of the classicks into French, but not one book in Greek or Latin; a circumstance that discovered her ignorance of these languages. -- After having taken a full view of this collection, I retired, and at the usual time was preparing to lay the cloth, when I was told by the maid that her was still in bed, and had been so affected with the notes of the hounds in the morning, that her actually believed her a hare beset with the hunters; and begged a few greens to munch for her breakfast. -- When I testified my surprise at this unaccountable imagination, her let me know that her was very much subject to whims of this nature; sometimes fancying her an animal, sometimes a piece of furniture, during which conceited transformations, it was very dangerous to come near her, especially when her represented a beast; for that lately, in the character of a cat, her had flown at her and scratched her face in a terrible manner; -- that some months ago, her prophesied the general conflagration was at hand, and nothing would be able to quench the general conflagration, but her water, which therefore her kept so long that her life was in danger; and her must needs have died of the retention, had they not found an expedient to make her evacuate by kindling a bonfire under her chamber window, and persuading her that the house was in flames; upon which, with great deliberation, her bid they bring all the tubs and vessels they could find, to be filled, for the preservation of the house, into one of which her immediately discharged the cause of her distemper. -- I was also informed, that nothing contributed so much to the recovery of her reason, as music, which was always administered on these occasions by Narcissa, who played perfectly well on the harpsicord, and to whom her (the maid) was just then going to intimate her 's disorder. -- her was no sooner gone, than I was summoned by the bell to the good lady's chamber, where I found her sitting squat on her hams, on the floor, in the manner of puss when her listens to the cries of her pursuers. -- When I appeared, her started up with an alarmed look, and sprung to the other side of the room to avoid me, whom, without doubt, her mistook for a beagle thirsting after her life. -- Perceiving her extreme confusion, I retired, and on the staircase met Narcissa coming up, to whom I imparted the situation of my mistress: her said not a word, but smiling with unspeakable grace, went into her aunt's apartment, and in a little time my ears were ravished with the effects of her skill. -- her accompanied the instrument with a voice so sweet and melodious, that I did not wonder at the surprising change the instrument produced on the spirits of my mistress, which were soon composed to peace and sober reflection.  About seven o'clock the hunters arrived, with the skins of two foxes and one badger, carried before the hunters as trophies of the hunters success; and when the hunters were about to sit down to dinner (or supper) Sir Timothy Thicket desired that Narcissa would honor the table with Sir Timothy Thicket presence: But this, notwithstanding Sir Timothy Thicket brother's threats and entreaties, Sir Timothy Thicket refused, on pretense of attending Sir Timothy Thicket aunt, who was indisposed; so that I enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing my rival mortified: But this disappointment made no great impression on him, who consoled my rival with the bottle, of which the whole company became so enamoured, that after a most horrid uproar of laughing, singing, swearing, dancing, and fighting, they were all carried to bed in a state of utter oblivion. -- My duty being altogether detached from the 'Squire and My duty family, I led a pretty easy and comfortable life, drinking daily intoxicating draughts of love from the charms of Narcissa, which brightened on my contemplation, every day, more and more. -- Inglorious as my station was, I became blind to my own unworthiness, and even conceived hopes of one day enjoying this amiable creature, whose affability greatly encouraged these presumptuous thoughts.  CHAP. XL. She is surprised at my learning -- communicates She performances to me -- I impart some of mine to She -- am mortified at She faint praise -- Narcissa approves of my production -- I gain an involuntary conquest over the cook-wench and dairymaid -- their mutual resentment and insinuations -- the jealousy of their lovers.  DURING this season of love and tranquillity, my muse, which had lain dormant so long, awoke, and produced several small performances on the subject of my flame: But as it concerned me nearly to remain undiscovered in my real character and sentiments, I was under a necessity of mortifying my desire of praise, by confining my works to my own perusal and applause. -- In the mean time I strove to insinuate me into the good opinion of both ladies; and succeeded so well, by my diligence and dutiful behavior, that in a little time, I was at least a favorite servant; and frequently enjoyed the pleasure of hearing me mentioned in French and Italian, with some degree of warmth and surprise, by the dear object of all my wishes, as a person who had so much of the gentleman in my appearance and discourse, that the gentleman could not for the gentleman soul treat me like a common lacquey. -- My prudence and modesty were not long proof against these bewitching compliments. One day, while I waited at dinner, the conversation turned upon a knotty passage of Tasso's Gierusalem, which, it seems, had puzzled them both: After a great many unsatisfactory conjectures, my mistress taking the book out of my mistress pocket, turned up the place in question, and read the sentence over and over without success; at length, despairing of finding the author's meaning, my mistress turned to me, saying, "Come-hither, Bruno, let us see what fortune will do for us; I will interpret to thee what goes before and what follows this obscure paragraph, the particular words of which I will also explain, that thou may, by comparing one with another, guess the sense of that which perplexes us." -- I was too vain to let slip this opportunity of displaying my talents, therefore, without hesitation, read and explained the whole of that which had disconcerted them, to the utter astonishment of both. -- Narcissa's face and lovely neck were overspread with blushes, from whence I drew a favorable omen, while her aunt, after having stared at me a good while with a look of amazement, exclaimed, "In the name of heaven! Who art thou?" -- I told her I had picked up a smattering of Italian, during a voyage up the Straits. -- At this her shook her head, and observed, that no smatterer could read as I had done. -- her then desired to know if I understood French, to which I answering in the affirmative: her asked if I was acquainted with the Latin and Greek; I replied, "A little." -- "Oho! (continued her) and with philosophy and mathematics, I suppose?" -- I owned, I knew something of each. -- Whereupon her repeated her stare and interrogation. -- I began to repent my vanity, and in order to repair the fault I had committed, said, it was not to be wondered at if I had a tolerable education, because learning was so cheap in my country, that every peasant was a scholar; but I hoped her ladyship would think my understanding no exception to my character. -- her was pleased to answer, "No, no, God forbid." -- But during the rest of the time they sat at table, they behaved with remarkable reserve.  This alteration gave me much uneasiness; and I passed the night without sleep, in melancholy reflections on the vanity of young men, which prompts they to commit so many foolish actions, contrary to they own sober judgment. -- Next day, however, instead of profiting by this selfcondemnation, I yielded still more to the dictates of the principle I had endeavored to chastize, and if fortune had not befriended me more than prudence could expect, I should have been treated with the contempt I deserved. -- After breakfast, my lady, who was a true author, bid me follow her into the study, where her expressed her thus: "Since you are so learned, you cannot be void of taste; therefore I am to desire your opinion of a small performance in poetry, which I lately composed. -- You must know, I have planned a tragedy, the subject of which shall be the murder of a prince before the altar, where he is busy at he devotions. -- After the deed is perpetrated, the regicide will harrangue the people, with the bloody dagger in the character hand; and I have already composed a speech, which I think will suit the character extremely. -- Here it is." -- Then taking up a scrape of paper, her read with violent emphasis and gesture, as follows: "Thus have I sent the simple king to hell, "Without or coffin, shroud, or passing bell: -- "To me, what are divine and human laws? "I court no sanction but my own applause! "Rapes, robb'ries, treasons yield my soul delight; "And human carnage gratifies my sight: "I drag the parent by the hoary hair, "And toss the sprawling infant on my spear, "While the fond mother's cries regale mine ear. "I fight, I vanquish, murder friends and foes; "Nor dare the immortal gods my rage oppose."   Though I did great violence to my understanding in praising this unnatural rhapsody, I nevertheless extolled great violence as a production that of great violence deserved immortal fame; and beseeched her ladyship to bless the world with the fruits of those uncommon talents heaven had bestowed upon her ladyship. -- her smiled with a look of self-complacency, and encouraged by the incense I had offered, communicated all her poetical works, which I applauded one by one, with as little candor as I had shown at first. -- Satiated with my flattery, which I hope my situation justified, her could not in conscience refuse me an opportunity of shining in my turn; and therefore, after a compliment to my nice discernment and taste, observed, that doubtless I must have produced something in that way myself, which her desired to see. -- This was a temptation I could by no means resist. -- I owned that while I was at college, I wrote some small detached pieces, at the desire of a friend who was in love; and at a friend who was in love request, repeated the following verses, which indeed my love for Narcissa had inspired. On Celia playing on the harpsicord and singing.
