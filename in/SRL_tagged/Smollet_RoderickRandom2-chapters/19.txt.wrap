and hearing that he lived in a flourishing condition, upon the estate lest to him by his wife's father, who had been dead some years, I took horse immediately, with the consent of Don Rodriguez, who had heard me mention him with great regard, and in a few hours reached the place of his habitation.  I should much wrong the delicacy of Mr. Thomson's sentiments, to say barely he was glad to see me: He felt all that the most sensible and disinterested friendship could feel on this occasion, introduced me to his wife, a very amiable young lady, who had already blessed him with two fine children; and being as yet ignorant of my circumstances, frankly offered me the assistance of his purse and interest. I thanked him for his generous intention, and made him acquainted with my situation, on which he congratulated me with great joy, and after I had staid with him a whole day and night, accompanied me back to Kingston, to wait upon my father, whom he invited to his house: Don Rodriguez complied with his request, and having been handsomely entertained during the space of a week, returned extremely well satisfied with the behavior of my friend and his lady, to whom at parting, he presented a valuable diamond ring, as a token of his esteem. During the course of my conversation with Mr. Thomson, he let me know, that his and my old commander captain Oakhum was dead some months, and that immediately after his death, a discovery had been made of some valuable effects that he had feloniously secreted out of a prize, by the assistance of Dr. Mackshane, who was now actually in prison on that account, and being destitute of friends, subsisted solely on the charity of my friend, whose bounty he had implored in the most abject manner, after having been the barbarous occasion of driving him to that terrible extremity on board of the Thunder, which we have formerly related. -- Whatsoever this wretch might have been guilty of, I applauded Mr. Thomson's generosity toward him in his distress, which wrought so much upon me also, that I sent him ten pistoles, in such a private manner, that he could never know his benefactor.  While my father and I were caressed among the gentlemen on shore, captain Bowling had wrote to his owners, by the packet, which sailed a few days after our arrival, signifying his prosperous voyage hitherto, and desiring them to ensure his ship and cargo homeward bound; after which he applied himself so heartily to the loading his ship, that with the assistance of Mr. Thomson, she was full in less than six weeks. This kind gentleman likewise procured for Don Rodriguez, bills upon London for the greatest part of his gold and silver, by which means it was secured against the risk of the seas and the enemy; and before we sailed, supplied us with such large quantities of all kinds of stock, that not only we, but the whole ships company, fared sumptuously during the voyage.  Every thing being ready, we took our leave of our kind entertainers, and going on board at Port Royal, set sail for England on the first day of June. -- We beat up to windward, with fine easy weather; and one night, believing ourselves near Cape Tiberoon, lay to, with an intention to wood and water next morning in the bay: While we remained in this situation, a sailor having drank more new rum than he could carry, staggered overboard, and notwithstanding all the means that could be used to preserve him, went to the bottom and disappeared. About two hours after this melancholy accident happened, as I enjoyed a cool air on the quarter deck, I heard a voice rising, as it were, out of the sea, and calling, "Ho, the ship, a hoy!" Upon which one of the men upon the forecastle cried, "I Will be d -- n'd, if that an't Jack Marlinspike, who went overboard!" Not a little surprised at this event, I jumped into the boat that lay along-side, with the second mate and four men, and rowing toward the place, from whence the voice (which repeated the hail) seemed to proceed, we perceived something floating upon the water; when we had rowed a little farther, we discerned it to be a man riding upon a hencoop, who seeing us approach, pronounced with a hoarse voice, "D -- n your bloods! why did you not answer when I hailed?" Our mate, who was a veritable seaman, hearing this salute, said, "By G -- d, my lads, this is none of our man -- This is the devil -- pull away for the ship." The fellows obeyed his command, without question, and were already some fathoms on our return, when I insisted on their taking up the poor creature, and prevailed upon them to go back to the wreck, which when we came near the second time, and signified our intention, we received an answer of, "Avast, avast -- what ship, brother?" Being satisfied in this particular, he cried, "D -- n the ship, I was in hopes it had been my own -- where are you bound?" We gratified his curiosity in this too; upon which he suffered himself to be taken on board, and after being comforted with a dram, told us, he belonged to the Vesuvio man of war, upon a cruize off the island of Hispaniola; that he had fallen overboard about four and twenty hours ago, and the ship being under sail, they did not choose to bring to, but tossed a hen-coop overboard for his convenience, upon which he was in good hopes of reaching the Cape next morning; howsomever, he was as well content to be aboard us, because he did not doubt that we should meet his ship; and if he had gone ashore in the bay, he might have been taken prisoner by the French. -- My uncle and father were very much diverted with the account of this fellow's unconcerned behavior; and in two days, meeting with the Vesuvio, as he expected, he was sent him on board of her according to his desire.  Having beat up successfully the windward passage, we stretched to the northward, and falling in with a westerly wind, in eight weeks arrived in soundings, and in two days after made the Lizzard. -- It is impossible to express the joy I felt at sight of English ground! Don Rodriguez was not unmoved, and Strap shed tears of gladness. -- The sailors profited by our satisfaction; the shoe that was nailed to the mast, being quite filled with our liberality. -- My uncle resolved to run up into the Downs at once, but the wind shifting when we were abreast of the isle of Wight, he was obliged to turn in to St. Helens, and come to an anchor at Spithead, to the great mortification of the crew, thirty of whom were immediately pressed on board of a man of war.  My father and I went a shore immediately to Portsmouth, leaving Strap with the captain to go round with the ship and take care of our effects; and I discovered so much impatience to see my charming Narcissa, that my father permitted me to ride across the country to her brother's house; while he should hire a post-chaise for London, where he would wait for me at a place to which I directed him.  Fired with all the eagerness of passion, I took post that very night, and in the morning reached an inn, about three miles from the Squire's habitation; here I remained till next evening, allaying the torture of my impatience with the rapturous hope of seeing that divine creature, after an absence of eighteen months, which so far from impairing, had raised my love to the most exalted pitch! Neither were my reflections free from apprehension, that sometimes intervened in spite of all my hope, and represented her as having yielded to the importunity of her brother, and blessed the arms of an unhappy rival. -- My thoughts were even maddened with the fear of her death; and when I arrived in the dark at the house of Mrs. Sagely, I had not for some time courage to desire admittance, lest my soul should be shocked with dismal tidings. At length, however, I knocked, and no sooner certified the good gentlewoman of my voice than she opened the door, and received me with a most affectionate embrace, that brought tears into her aged eyes: "For heaven's sake! dear mother (cried I) tell me, how is Narcissa? is she the same that I left her?" She blessed my ears with saying, "She is as beautiful, in as good health, and as much yours as ever." -- Transported at this assurance, I begged to know if I could not see her that very night; when this sage matron gave me to understand that my mistress was in London, and that things were strangely altered in the Squire's house since my departure; that he had been married a whole year to Melinda, who at first found means to wean his attention so much from Narcissa, that he became quite careless of that lovely sister, comforting himself with the clause in his father's will, by which she would forfeit her fortune, if she should marry without his consent; -- that my mistress being but indifferently treated by her sister-in-law, had made use of her freedom some months ago, and gone to town, where she was lodged with Miss Williams, in expectation of my arrival; and had been pestered with the addresses of Lord Quiverwit, who finding her heart engaged, had fallen upon a great many shifts, to persuade her that I was dead: but finding all his artifices unsuccessful, and despairing of gaining her affection, he had consoled himself for her indifference, by marrying another lady some weeks ago, who had already lest him on account of some family uneasiness. -- Besides this interesting information, she told me, that there was not a great deal of harmony between Melinda and the Squire, who was so much disgusted at the number of gallants who continued to hover about her even after marriage, that he hurried her down into the country much against her inclination, where their mutual animosities had risen to such a height, that they preserved no decency before company or servants, but abused one another in the grossest terms.  This good old gentlewoman, to give me a convincing proof of my dear Narcissa's unalterable love, gratified me with a sight of the last letter she had favored her with, in which I was mentioned with so much honor, tenderness and concern, that my soul was fired with impatience, and I determined to ride all night, that I might have it the sooner in my power to make her happy. -- Mrs. Sagely perceiving my eagerness, and her maternal affection being equally divided between Narcissa and me, begged leave to remind me of the sentiments with which I went abroad, that would not permit me for any selfish gratification to prejudice the fortune of that amiable young lady, who must entirely depend upon me, after having bestowed herself in marriage. I thanked her for her kind concern, and as briefly as possible described my flourishing situation, which afforded this humane person infinite wonder and satisfaction. I told her, that now I had an opportunity to manifest my gratitude for the obligations I owed, I would endeavor to make her old age comfortable and easy; as a step to which, I proposed she should come and live with Narcissa and me. -- This venerable gentlewoman was so much affected with my words, that the tears run down her ancient cheeks; she thanked heaven that I had not belied the presages she had made, on her first acquaintance with me; acknowledging my generosity, as she called it, in the most elegant and pathetick expressions; but declined my proposal, on account of her attachment to the dear melancholy cottage where she had so peacefully consumed her solitary widowhood. Finding her immovable on this subject, I insisted on her accepting a present of thirty guineas, and took my leave, resolving to accommodate her with the same sum annually, for the more comfortable support of the infirmities of age.  Having rode all night, I found myself at Canterbury in the morning, where I alighted to procure fresh horses; and as I walked into the inn, perceived an apothecary's shop on the other side of the street, with the name of Morgan over the door: Alarmed at this discovery, I could not help thinking that my old mess-mate had settled in this place; and upon enquiry, found my conjecture true, and that he was married lately to a widow of that city, by whom he had got three thousand pounds. Rejoiced at this intelligence, I went to his shop as soon as it was open, and found my friend behind the counter, busy in preparing a glyster. I saluted him at entrance, with "Your servant, Mr. Morgan." -- Upon which he looked at me, and replying, "Your most humble servant, goot Sir;"rubbed his ingredients in the mortar, without any emotion. "What! (said I) Morgan, have you forgot your old mess-mate?" At these words, he looked up again, and starting, cried, "As Got is my -- sure it cannot -- yes by my salfation, I pelieve it is my tear frient Mr. Rantom." -- He was no sooner convinced of my identity, than he threw down the pestle, overset the mortar, and jumping over the board, swept up the contents with his clothes, flew about my neck, hugged me affectionately, and daubed me all over with turpentine and the yolks of eggs, which he had been mixing when I came in. -- Our mutual congratulations being over, he told me, that he found himself a widower upon his return from the West Indies; that he had got interest to be appointed surgeon of a man of war, in which capacity he had served some years, until he married an apothecary's widow, with whom he now enjoyed a pretty good sum of money, peace and quiet, and an indifferent good trade. -- He was very desirous of hearing my adventures, which I assured him I had not time to relate, but told him in general, my circumstances were very good, and that I hoped to see him when I should not be in such a hurry as at present. -- He insisted however on my staying breakfast, and introduced me to his wife, who seemed to be a decent sensible woman, pretty well stricken in years. In the course of our conversation, he showed the sleeve-buttons I had exchanged with him at our parting in the West Indies, and was not a little proud to see that I had preserved his with the same care. When I informed him of Mackshane's condition, he seemed at first to exult over his distress; but after a little recollection, he said, "Well, he has paid for his malice, I forgife him, and may Got forgife him likewise." He expressed great concern for the soul of captain Oakhum, which he believed was now gnashing its teeth: but it was some time before I could convince him of Thomson's being alive, at whose good fortune nevertheless he was extremely glad.  Having renewed our protestations of friendship, I bid the honest Welchman and his spouse farewell, and taking post horses, arrived at London that same night, where I found my father in good health, to whom I imparted what I had learned of Narcissa. -- This indulgent parent approved of my intention of marrying her, even without a fortune, provided her brother's consent could not be obtained; promised to make over to me in a few days a sufficiency to maintain her in a fashionable manner, and expressed a desire of seeing this amiable creature, who had captivated me so much. -- As I had not slept the night before, and was besides fatigued with my journey, I found myself under a necessity of taking some repose, and went to bed accordingly: next morning about ten a-clock, I took a chair, and, according to Mrs. Sagely's directions, went to my charmer's lodgings, and enquired for Miss Williams. -- I had not waited in a parlour longer than a minute, when this young woman entered, and no sooner perceived me, than she shrieked and run backward; I got between her and the door, and clasping her in my arms, brought her to herself by an embrace. "Good heaven (cried she) Mr. Random is it you indeed! my mistress will run distracted with joy." -- I told her, it was from an apprehension that my sudden appearance would have some bad effect on my dear Narcissa, that I had desired to see her first, in order to concert some method of acquainting her mistress gradually with my arrival. She approved of my conduct, and after having yielded to the suggestions of her own friendship, in asking if my voyage had been successful, charged herself with that office, and left me glowing with desire of seeing and embracing the object of my love. In a very little time I heard some body coming down stairs in haste, and the voice of my angel pronounce, with an eager tone, "O heaven! is it possible! where is he?" How were my faculties arroused at this well-known sound! and how was my soul transported, when she broke in upon my view, in all the bloom of ripened beauty! Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye, in every gesture dignity and love! -- You whose souls are susceptible of the most delicate impressions, whose tender bosoms have felt the affecting vicissitudes of love, who have suffered an absence of eighteen long months from the dear object of your hope, and found at your return the melting fair, as kind and constant as your heart could wish; do me justice on this occasion, and conceive what unutterable rapture possessed us both, while we flew into one another arms! This was no time for speech, -- locked in a mutual embrace, we continued some minutes in a silent trance of joy! -- When I thus encircled all that my soul held dear, -- while I hung over her beauties, -- beheld her eyes sparkle, and every feature flush with virtuous fondness; when I saw her enchanting bosom heave with undissembled rapture, and knew myself the happy cause -- Heavens! what was my situation! -- I am tempted to commit my paper to the flames, and to renounce my pen for ever, because its most ardent and lucky expression so poorly describes the emotions of my soul. O adorable Narcissa! (cried I) O miracle of beauty, love and truth! I at last fold thee in my arms! I at last can call thee mine! no jealous brother shall thwart our happiness again; fortune has at length recompensed me for all my sufferings, and enabled me to do justice to my love. -- The dear creature smiled ineffably charming, and with a look of bewitching tenderness, said, "And shall we never part again?" "Never! (I replied) thou wondrous pattern of all earthly perfection! never, until death shall divide us! by this ambrosial kiss, a thousand times more fragrant than the breeze that sweeps the orange grove, I never more will leave thee!"  As my first transport abated, my passion grew turbulent and unruly. I was giddy with standing on the brink of bliss, and all my virtue and philosophy were scarce sufficient to restrain the inordinate sallies of desire. -- Narcissa perceived the conflict within me, and with her usual dignity of prudence, called off my imagination from the object in view, and with eager expressions of interested curiosity, desired to know the particulars of my voyage. -- In this I gratified her inclination, bringing my story down to the present hour. She was infinitely surprised at the circumstances of my finding my father, which brought tears into her lovely eyes. She was transported at hearing that he approved my flame, discovered a longing desire of being introduced to him, congratulated herself and me upon my good fortune, and observed that this great and unexpected stroke of fate seemed to have been brought about by the immediate direction of providence. -- Having entertained ourselves some hours with the genuine effusions of our souls, I obtained her consent to complete my happiness as soon as my father should judge it proper; and applying with my own hands a valuable necklace, composed of diamonds and amethysts set alternately, which an old Spanish lady at Paraguay presented me with, I took my leave, promising to return in the afternoon with Don Rodriguez. -- When I went home, this generous parent enquired very affectionately about the health of my dear Narcissa, to whom that I might be the more agreeable, he put into my hand a deed, by which I found myself in possession of fifteen thousand pounds, exclusive of the profits of my own merchandise, which amounted to three thousand more. -- After dinner I accompanied him to the lodging of my mistress, who being dressed for the occasion, made a most dazzling appearance. I could perceive him struck with her figure, which I really think was the most beautiful that ever was created under the sun. He embraced her tenderly, and told her, he was proud of having a son who had spirit to attempt, and qualifications to engage, the affections of such a fine lady. -- She blushed at this compliment, and with eyes full of the softest languishment turned upon me, said, she would have been unworthy of Mr. Random's attention, had she been blind to his extraordinary merit. -- I made no other answer than a low bow. My father sighing, pronounced, "Such once was my Charlotte!" while the tear rushed into his eye, and the tender heart of Narcissa manifested itself in two precious drops of sympathy, which, but for his presence, I would have kissed away. Without repeating the particulars of our conversation, I shall only observe, that Don Rodriguez was as much charmed with her good-sense, as with her appearance; and she was no less pleased with his understanding and polite address. -- It was determined that he should write to the Squire signifying his approbation of my passion for his sister, and offering a settlement which he should have no reason to reject; and that, if he should refuse the proposal, we would crown our mutual wishes without any farther regard to his will.  CHAP. LXVIII. My father makes a present to Narcissa -- the letter is dispatched to her brother -- I appear among my acquaintance -- Banter's behavior -- the Squire refuses his consent -- my uncle comes to town -- approves of my choice -- I am married -- we meet the Squire and his lady at the play -- our acquaintance is courted.  AFTER having spent the evening to the satisfaction of all present, my father addressed himself thus to Narcissa, "Madam, give me leave to consider you hereafter as my daughter, in which capacity I insist upon your accepting this first instance of my paternal duty and affection." With these words, he put into her hand a bank-note for 500 l. which she no sooner examined, than with a low curtesy she replied, "Dear Sir, though I have not the least occasion for this supply, I have too great a veneration for you, to refuse this proof of your generosity and esteem, which I the more freely receive, because I already look upon Mr. Random's interest as inseparably connected with mine." He was extremely well pleased at her frank and ingenuous reply, upon which we saluted, and wished her good night. -- The letter, at my request, was dispatched to Sussex by an express, and in the mean time, Don Rodriguez, to grace my nuptials, hired a ready-furnished house, and set up a very handsome equipage.  Though I passed the greatest part of the day with the darling of my soul, I found leisure sometimes to be among my former acquaintance, who were astonished at the magnificence of my appearance: Banter in particular was confounded at the strange vicissitudes of my fortune, the causes of which he endeavored in vain to discover, until I thought fit to disclose the whole secret of my last voyage, partly in consideration of our former intimacy, and partly to prevent unfavourable conjectures which he and others, in all probability, would have made in regard to my circumstances. He professed great satisfaction at this piece of news, and I had no cause to believe him insincere, when I considered that he would now look upon himself as acquitted of the debt he owed me, and at the same time flatter himself with hopes of borrowing more. -- I carried him home to dinner with me, and my father liked his conversation so much, that upon hearing his difficulties, he desired me to accommodate him for the present, and enquire if he would accept of a commission in the army, toward the purchase of which he would willingly lend him money. Accordingly, I gave my friend an opportunity of being alone with me, when, as I expected, he told me that he was just on the point of being reconciled to an old rich uncle, whose heir he was, but wanted a few pieces for immediate expense, which he desired I would lend him, and take his bond for the whole. His demand was limited to ten guineas; and when I put twenty into his hand, he stared at me for some moments, then putting it into his purse, said, "Ay, it is all one, -- you will have the whole in a very short time." When I had taken his note, to save the expense of a bond, I expressed some surprise that a fellow of his spirit should loiter away his time in idleness, and asked why he did not choose to make his fortune in the army. -- "What! (said he) throw away money upon a subaltern's commission, to be under the command of a parcel of scoundrels who have raised themselves above me by the most infamous practices! no, I love independency too well to sacrifice my life, health and pleasure for such a pitiful consideration." -- Finding him averse to this way of life, I changed the subject, and returned to Don Rodriguez, who had just received the following epistle from the Squire.  SIR, COncerning a letter which I received, subscribed R. Random, this is the answer. -- As for you, I know nothing of you. -- Your son, or pretended son, I have seen; -- if he marries my sister, at his peril be it; I do declare, that he shall not have one sarthing of her fortune, which becomes my property, if she takes a husband without my consent. -- Your settlement, I do believe, is all a sham, and yourself no better than you should be; but if you had all the wealth of the Indies, your son shall never match in our family, with the consent of  Orson Topehall.   My father was not much surprised at this polite letter, after having heard the character of the author: and as for me, I was even pleased at his refusal, because I now had an opportunity of showing my disinterested love. By his permission I waited on my charmer; and having imparted the contents of her brother's letter, at which she wept bitterly, in spite of all my consolation and caresses, the time of our marriage was fixed at the distance of two days. -- During this interval, in which my soul was wound up to the last stretch of rapturous expectation, Narcissa endeavored to reconcile some of her relations in town to her marriage with me; but finding them all deaf to her remonstrances, either out of envy or prejudice; she told me with the most enchanting sweetness, while the tears bedewed her lovely cheeks, "Sure the world will no longer question your generosity, when you take a poor forlorn beggar to your arms." Affected with her sorrow, I pressed the fair mourner to my breast, and swore that she was more dear and welcome on that account, because she had sacrificed her friends and fortune to her love for me. -- My uncle, for whose character she had a great veneration, being by this time come to town, I introduced him to my bride; and although he was not very much subject to refined sensations, he was struck dumb with admiration at her beauty. After having kissed and gazed at her for some time, he turned to me, saying, "Odds bobs, Rory! here is a notable prize indeed, finely built and gloriously rigged, I faith! if she an't well manned when you have the command of of her, sirrah, you deserve to go to sea in a cockle-shell. -- No offense, I hope, niece; you must not mind what I say, being (as the saying is) a plain seafaring man, thof mayhap I have as much regard for you as another." -- She received him with great civility, told him she had longed a great while to see a person to whom she was so much indebted for his generosity to Mr. Random, that she looked upon him as her uncle, by which name she begged leave to call him for the future, and that she was very sure he could say nothing that could give her the least offense. The honest captain was transported at her courteous behavior, and insisted upon giving her away at the ceremony, swearing that he loved her as well as if she was his own child, and that he would give two thousand guineas to the first fruit of o^ love, as soon as it could squeak. -- Every ^ng being prepared for the solemnization of our nuptials, which were to be performed privately at my father's house, the auspicious hour arrived, when Don Rodriguez and my uncle went in the coach to fetch the bride and Miss Williams; leaving me with a parson, Banter and Strap, neither of whom had as yet seen my charming mistress. -- My faithful valet, who was on the rack of impatience to behold a lady of whom he had heard so much, no sooner understood that the coach was returned, than he placed himself at a window to have a peep at her as she alighted; and when he saw her, he clapped his hands together, turned up the white of his eyes, and with his mouth wide open, remained in a sort of ecstasy, which broke out into, " O Dea certe! -- qualis in Eurotae ripis, aut per juga Cynthi exercet Diana choros!" -- The doctor and Banter were surpised to hear my man speak Latin, but when my father led Narcissa into the room, the object of their admiration was soon changed, as appeared in the countenances of both. -- Indeed they must have been the most insensible of all beings, could they have beheld without emotion the divine creature that approached! She was dressed in a sack of white satin, embroidered on the breast with gold; the crown of her head was covered with a small French cap, from whence descended her beautiful hair in ringlets that waved upon her snowy neck, which dignified the necklace I had given her; her looks glowed with modesty and love; and her bosom, through the veil of gauze that shaded it, afforded a prospect of Elyzium! -- I received this inestimable gift of providence as became me; and in a little time the clergyman did his office, my uncle, at his own earnest request, acting the part of a father to my dear Narcissa, who trembled very much, and had scarce spirits sufficient to support her under this great change of situation. -- Soon as she was mine by the laws of heaven and earth, I printed a burning kiss upon her lips, my father embraced her tenderly, my uncle hugged her with great affection, and I presented her to my friend Banter, who saluted her in a very polite manner; Miss Williams hung round her neck, and wept plentifully; while Strap fell upon his knees, and begged to kiss his lady's hand, which she presented with great affability. -- I shall not pretend to describe my own feelings at this juncture; let it suffice to say, that after having supped and entertained ourselves 'till ten a-clock, I cautioned my Narcissa against exposing her health by sitting up too late, and she was prevailed upon to withdraw with her maid to an apartment destined for us. When she left the room, her face was overspread with a blush that set all my blood in a state of fermentation, and made every pulse beat with tenfold vigor! She was so cruel as to let me remain in this condition a full half hour; when, no longer able to restrain my impatience, I broke from the company, burst into her chamber, pushed out her confidante, locked the door, and found her -- O heaven and earth! a feast, a thousand times more delicious than my most sanguine hope presaged! -- But let me not profane the chaste mysteries of hymen -- I was the happiest of men!  In the morning I was awaked by three or four drums, which Banter had placed under the window; upon which I withdrew the curtain, and enjoyed the unspeakable satisfaction of contemplating those angelic charms, which were now in my possession! Beauty! which whether sleeping or awake, shot forth peculiar graces! -- The light darting upon my Narcissa's eyes, she awoke also, and recollecting her situation, hid her blushes in my bosom. -- I was distracted with joy! I could not believe the evidence of my senses, and looked upon all that had happened, as the fictions of a dream! In the mean time my uncle knocked at the door, and bid me turn out, for I had had a long spell. -- I got up accordingly, and sent Miss Williams to her mistress, myself receiving the congratulation of captain Bowling, who rallied me in his sea phrase, with great success. -- In less than an hour, Don Rodriguez led my wife in to breakfast, where she received the compliments of the company on her looks, which, they said, if possible, were improved by matrimony. -- As her delicate ears were offended with none of those indecent ambiguities, which are too often spoke on such occasions, she behaved with dignity, unaffected modesty, and ease; and as a testimony of my affection and esteem, I presented her, in presence of them all, with a deed, by which I settled the whole fortune I was possessed of, on her and her heirs for ever. -- She accepted it with a glance of most tender acknowledgment, observed, that she could not be surprised at any thing of this kind I should do, and desired my father to take the trouble of keeping it, saying, "Next to my own Mr. Random, you are the person in whom I ought to have the greatest confidence." Charmed with her prudent and ingenuous manner of proceeding, he took the paper, and assured her that it should not lose its value while in his custody.  As we had not many visits to give and receive; the little time we stayed in town was spent in going to public diversions, where I have the vanity to think Narcissa seldom was eclipsed. -- One night in particular, we had sent our footman to keep one of the stage-boxes, which we no sooner entered, than we perceived in the opposite box the Squire and his lady, who seemed not a little surprised at seeing us. I was pleased at this opportunity of confronting them; the more, because Melinda was robbed of all her admirers by my wife, who happened that night to outshine her sister both in beauty and dress. -- She was piqued at Narcissa's victory, tossed her head a thousand different ways, flirted her fan, looked at us with disdain, then whispered to her husband, and broke out into an affected giggle; but all her arts proved ineffectual, either to discompose Mrs. Random, or to conceal her own mortification, which at length forced her away long before the play was done. -- The news of our marriage being spread, with many circumstances to our disadvantage, by the industry of this malignant creature, a certain set of persons, fond of scandal, began to enquire into the particulars of my fortune, which they no sooner understood to be independent, than the tables were turned, and our acquaintance was courted as much as it had been despised before: But Narcissa had too much dignity of pride, to encourage this change of conduct, especially in her relations, whom she could never be prevailed upon to see, after the malicious reports they had raised to her prejudice.  CHAP. LXIX. My father intends to revisit the place of his nativity -- we propose to accompany him -- my uncle renews his will in my favor, determining to go to sea again -- we set out for Scotland -- arrive at Edinburgh -- purchase our paternal estate -- proceed to to it -- halt at the town where I was educated -- take up my bond to Crab -- the behavior of Potion and his wife, and one of my female cousins -- our reception at the estate -- Strap marries Miss Williams, and is settled by my father to his own satisfaction -- I am more and more happy.  MY father intending to revisit his native country, and pay the tribute of a few tears at my mother's grave, Narcissa and I resolved to accompany him in the execution of this pious office, and accordingly prepared for the journey; in which, however, my uncle would not engage, being resolved to try his fortune once more at sea. In the mean time, he renewed his will in favor of my wife and me, and deposited it in the hands of his brother-in-law: While I (that I might not be wanting to my own interest) summoned the Squire to produce his father's will at Doctor's Commons, and employed a proctor to manage the affair in my absence.  Every thing being thus settled, we took leave of all our friends in London, and set out for Scotland, Don Rodriguez, Narcissa, Miss Williams, and I in the coach, and Strap with two men in livery on horseback: As we made easy stages, my charmer held it out very well, till we arrived at Edinburgh, where we proposed to rest ourselves some weeks. People of our figure could not fail of attracting the notice of such a small place, where, as soon as our family was known, we were loaded with caresses, and Narcissa was so much pleased with the civilities she received, that she protested she would never desire to live in any other part of the world.  Here Don Rodriguez having intelligence that his nephew the fox-hunter had spent his estate, which was to be exposed to sale by public auction, he determined to make a purchase of the spot where he was born, and actually bought the whole of his father's lands.  In a few days after this bargain was made, we left Edinburgh, in order to go and take possession; and by the way, halted one night in that town where I was educated. -- Upon inquiry, I found that Mr. Crab was dead; whereupon I sent for his executor, paid the sum I owed, with interest, and took up my bond. Mr. Potion and his wife hearing of our arrival, had the assurance to come to the inn where we lodged, and send up their names, with a desire of being permitted to pay their respects to my father and me: But their fordid behavior toward me, when I was an orphan, had made too deep an impression on my mind, to be effaced by this mean mercenary piece of condescension; I therefore rejected their message with disdain, and bid Strap tell them, that my father and I desired to have no communication with such low-minded wretches as they were.  They had not been gone half an hour, when a woman without any ceremony, opened the door of the room where we sat, and making toward my father, accosted him with, "Uncle, your servant -- I am glad to see you." -- This was no other than one of my female cousins, mentioned in the first part of my memoirs, to whom Don Rodriguez replied, "Pray, who are you, madam?" -- "O! (cried she) my cousin Rory there, knows me very well -- Don't you remember me, Rory?" -- "Yes, madam, (said I) for my own part, I shall never forget you. -- Sir, this is one of the young ladies, who (as I have formerly told you) treated me so humanely in my childhood!" When I pronounced these words, my father's resentment glowed in his visage, and he ordered her to be gone, with such a commanding aspect, that she retired in a fright, muttering curses as she went down stairs: We afterward learned that she was married to an ensign, who had already spent all her fortune; and that her sister had bore a child to her mother's footman, who is now her husband, and keeps a petty alehouse in the country.  The fame of our flourishing condition having arrived at this place before us, we got notice that the magistrates intended next day to compliment us with the freedom of their town; upon which my father, considering their complaisance in the right point of view, ordered the horses to the coach early in the morning, when we proceeded to our estate, which lay about a dozen miles from this place.  When we came within half a league of the house, we were met by a prodigious number of poor tenants, men, women and children, who testified their joy by loud acclamations, and accompanied our coach to the gate. -- As there is no part of the world, in which the peasants are more attached to their Lords, than in Scotland, we were almost devoured by their affection, in getting out of the coach: My father had always been their favorite, and now that he appeared their master, after being thought dead so long, their joy broke out into a thousand extravagancies: When we got into the courtyard, we were surrounded by a vast number, who crowded together so closely to see us, that several were in danger of being squeezed to death; those who were near Don Rodriguez fell upon their knees, and kissed his hand, o^ the hem of his garment, praying aloud for long life and prosperity to him; others approached Narcissa and me in the same manner; while the rest clapped their hands at a distance, and invoked heaven to shower its choicest blessings on our heads! -- In short, the whole scene, though rude, was so affecting, that the gentle partner of my heart wept over it, and my father himself could not refrain from dropping a tear.  Having welcomed his daughter and me to his house, he ordered some bullocks to be killed, and some hogsheads of ale to be brought from the neighboring village, to regale those honest people, who had not enjoyed such a holiday for many years before.  Next day we were visited by the gentlemen in the neighborhood, most of them our relations, one of whom brought along with him my cousin, the fox-hunter, who had staid at his house, since he was obliged to leave his own: My father was generous enough to receive him kindly, and even promise to purchase for him a commission in the army, at which he expressed great thankfulness and joy:  My charming Narcissa was universally admired and loved for her beauty, affability and good sense; and so well pleased with the situation of the place, and the company around, that she has not, as yet, discovered the least desire of changing her habitation.  We had not been many days settled, when I prevailed upon my father to pay a visit to the village where I had been at school. Here we were received by the principal inhabitants, who entertained us in the church, where Mr. Syntax the schoolmaster (my tyrant being dead) pronounced a Latin speech in honor of our family: And none exerted themselves more than Strap's father and relations, who looked upon the honest valet as the first gentleman of their race, and honored his benefactors accordingly. -- Having received the homage of this place, we retired, leaving forty pounds for the benefit of the poor of the parish; and that very night, Strap being a little elevated with the regard that had been shown to him, and to me on his account, ventured to tell me, that he had a sneaking kindness for Miss Williams, and that if his lady and I would use our interest in his behalf, he did not doubt that she would listen to his addresses. Surprised at this proposal, I asked if he knew the story of that unfortunate young gentlewoman: Upon which, he replied, "Yes, yes, I know what you mean -- she has been unhappy, I grant you -- but what of that? I am convinced of her reformation; or else you and my good lady would not treat her with such respect. -- As for the censure of the world, I value it not a fig's end -- besides, the world knows nothing of the matter." I commended his philosophy, and interested Narcissa in his cause; who interceded so effectually, that in a little time, Miss Williams, yielded her consent, and they were married with the approbation of Don Rodriguez, who gave him five hundred pounds to stock a farm, and made him overseer of his estate. My generous bedfellow gave her maid the same sum; so that they live in great peace and plenty within half a mile of us, and daily put up prayers for our preservation.  If there be such a thing as true happiness on earth, I enjoy it. -- The impetuous transports of my passion are now settled and mellowed into endearing fondness and tranquillity of love, rooted by that intimate connection and interchange of hearts, which naught but virtuous wedlock can produce. -- Fortune seems determined to make ample amends for her former cruelty; for my proctor writes, that notwithstanding the clause in my father-in-law's will, on which the Squire founds his claim, I shall certainly ^over my wife's fortune, in consequence of a codicil annexed, which explains that clause, and limits her restriction to the age of nineteen, after which she was at her own disposal. -- I would have set out for London immediately after receiving this piece of intelligence, but my dear angel has been qualmish of late, and begins to grow remarkably round in the waist; so that I cannot leave her in such an interesting situation, which I hope will produce something to crown my felicity.  FINIS.
