of the progress I had made in the affection of her mistress, and blessed me with an account of that dear creature's conversation with her, after she had retired the night before from our company. -- I could scarce believe her information, when she recounted her expressions in my favor, so much more warm and passionate were they than my most sanguine hopes had presaged; and was particularly pleased to hear that she approved of my behavior to her brother, after she withdrew. -- Transported at the news of my happiness, I presented my ring to the messenger, as a testimony of my gratitude and satisfaction; but she was above such mercenary considerations, and refused my compliment with some resentment, saying, she was not a little mortified to see my opinion of her so low and contemptible. -- I did myself a piece of justice by explaining my behavior on this head, and to convince her of my esteem, promised to be ruled by her directions in the prosecution of the whole affair, which I had so much at heart, that the repose of my life depended upon the consequence.  As I fervently wished for another interview, where I might pour out the effusions of my love, without danger of being interrupted, and perhaps reap some endearing return from the queen of my desires, I implored her advice and assistance in promoting this event; -- but she gave me to understand, that Narcissa would make no precipitate compliances of this kind, and that I would do well to cultivate her brother's acquaintance, in the course of which, I would not want opportunities of removing that reserve, which my mistress thought herself obliged to maintain during the infancy of our correspondence. -- In the mean time, she promised to tell her lady that I had endeavored by presents and persuasions, to prevail upon her, (Miss Williams) to deliver a letter from me, which she had refused to charge herself with, until she should know Narcissa's sentiments of the matter; and said, by these means she did not doubt of being able to open a literary communication between us, which could not fail of introducing more intimate connexions.  I approved of her counsel, and our appointment being renewed for next day, left her with an intent of falling upon some method of being reconciled to the Squire, who, I supposed, would be offended with the trick we had put upon him. -- With this view, I consulted Freeman, who from his knowledge of the Fox-hunter's disposition, assured me there was no other method of pacifying him, than that of sacrificing ourselves for one night, to an equal match with him in drinking: This I found myself necessitated to comply with, for the interest of my passion, and therefore determined to commit the debauch at my own lodgings, that I might run no risk of being discovered by Narcissa, in a state of brutal degeneracy. -- Mr. Freeman, who was to be of the party, went, at my desire, to the Squire in order to engage him, while I took care to furnish myself for his reception. -- My invitation was accepted, my guests honored me with their company in the evening, when Bruin gave me to understand that he had drank many tuns of wine in his life, but was never served such a trick as I had played upon him the night before. I promised to atone for my trespass, and having ordered to every man his bottle, began the contest with a bumper to the health of Narcissa. -- The toasts circulated with great devotion, the liquor began to operate, our mirth grew noisy, and as Freeman and I had the advantage of drinking small French claret, the savage was effectually tamed before our senses were in the least affected, and carried home in a kind of apoplexy of drunkenness.  I was next morning, as usual, savoured with a visit from my kind and punctual confidante, who telling me, she was permitted to receive my letters for her mistress; I took up the pen immediately, and following the first dictates of my passion, wrote as follows:  DEAR. MADAM, WERE it possible for the powers of utterance, to reveal the soft emotions of my soul; the fond anxiety, the glowing hopes, and chilling fears that rule my breast by turns; I should need no other witness than this paper, to evince the purity and ardour of that flame your charms have kindled in my heart. But alas! expression wrongs my love! I am inspired with conceptions that no language can convey! Your beauty fills me with wonder! your understanding with ravishment, and your goodness with adoration! I am transported with desire, distracted with doubts, and tortured with impatience! Suffer me then, lovely arbitress of my fate, to approach you in person, to breathe in soft murmurs my passion to your car, to offer the sacrifice of a heart overflowing with the most genuine and disinterested love; to gaze with exstasy on the divine object of my wishes, to hear the music of her enchanting tongue! to rejoice in her smiles of approbation, and banish the most intolerable suspense from the bosom of  Your enraptured R -- R --.   Having finished this effusion, I committed it to the care of my faithful friend, with an injunction to second my entreaty with all her eloquence and influence; and in the mean time went to dress, with an intention of visiting Mrs. Snapper and Miss, whom I had utterly neglected and indeed almost forgot, since my dear Narcissa had resumed the empire of my soul. The old gentlewoman received me very kindly, and Miss affected a frankness and gaiety, which, however, I could easily perceive was forced and dissembled; among other things, she pretended to joke me upon my passion for Narcissa, which she averred was no secret, and asked if I intended to dance with her at the next assembly. -- I was a good deal concerned to find myself become the town-talk on this subject, lest the Squire, having notice of my inclinations, should disapprove of them, and by breaking off all correspondence with me, deprive me of the opportunities I now enjoyed. -- But I resolved to use the interest I had with him, while it lasted; and that very night, meeting him occasionally, asked his permission to solicit her company at the ball, which he very readily granted, to my inexpressible satisfaction.  Having been kept awake the greatest part of the night, by a thousand delightful reveries that took possession of my fancy, I got up betimes, and flying to the place of rendezvous, had in a little time the pleasure of seeing Miss Williams approach with a smile on her countenance, which I interpreted into a good omen. Neither was I mistaken in my presage: She presented me with a letter from the idol of my soul, which, after having kissed it with great devotion, I opened with the utmost eagerness, and was blessed with her approbation in these terms.  SIR, TO say I look upon you with indifference, would be a piece of dissimulation which, I think, no decorum requires, and no custom can justify. As my heart never felt an impression that my tongue was ashamed to declare, I will not scruple to own myself pleased with your passion, confident of your integrity, and so well convinced of my own discretion, that I should not hesitate in granting you the interview you desire, were I not overawed by the prying curiosity of a malicious world, the censure of which might be fatally prejudicial to the reputation of  Your NARCISSA.   No Anchorite in the exstasy of devotion, ever adored a relic with more fervor than that with which I kissed this inimitable proof of my charmer's candor, generosity and affection! I read it over an hundred times; was ravished with her confession in the beginning; but the subscription of YOUR NARCISSA, yielded me such delight as I had never felt before! My happiness was still increased by Miss Williams, who blessed me with a repetition of her lady's tender expressions in my favor, when she received and read my letter. -- In short, I had all the reason in the world to believe that this gentle creature's bosom was possessed by a passion for me, as warm, though perhaps not so impetuous, as mine for her.  I informed my friend of the Squire's consent, with regard to my dancing with Narcissa at the ball, and desired her to tell her mistress, that I would do myself the honor of visiting her in the afternoon, in consequence of his permission, when I hoped to find her as indulgent as her brother had been complaisant in that particular. -- Miss Williams expressed a good deal of joy, at hearing I was so much in favor with the fox-hunter, and ventured to assure me, that my visit would be very agreeable to my mistress, the rather because Bruin was engaged to dine abroad. -- This was a circumstance, which I scarce need say, pleased me. -- I went immediately to the long-room, where I found him, and affecting to know nothing of his engagement, told him, I would do myself the pleasure to wait upon him in the afternoon, and to present his sister with a ticket for the ball. -- He shook me by the hand, according to custom, and giving me to understand that he was to dine abroad, desired me to go and drink tea with Narcissa notwithstanding, and promised to prepare her for my visit in the mean time.  Every thing succeeding thus to my wish, I waited with incredible patience for the time, which no sooner arrived, than I hastened to the scene, which my fancy had pre-occupied long before. -- I was introduced accordingly, to the dear enchantress, whom I found accompanied by Miss Williams, who, on pretense of ordering tea, retired at my approach. -- This favorable accident, which alarmed my whole soul, disordered her also. -- I found myself actuated by an irresistible impulse, I advanced to her with eagerness and awe; and profiting by the confusion that prevailed over her, clasped the fair angel in my arms, and imprinted a glowing kiss upon her lips, more soft and fragrant than the dewy rosebud just bursting from the stem! Her face was in an instant covered with blushes, her eyes sparkled with resentment; I threw myself at her feet, and implored her pardon. -- Her love became advocate in my cause; her look softened into forgiveness, she raised me up, and chid me with so much sweetness of displeasure, that I was tempted to repeat the offense, had not the coming of a servant with the tea-board, prevented my presumption. -- While we were subject to be interrupted or overheard, we conversed about the approaching ball, at which she promised to grace me as a partner; but when the equipage was removed, and we were left alone, I resumed the more interesting theme, and expressed myself with such transport and agitation, that my mistress, fearing I would commit some extravagance, rung the bell for her maid, whom she detained in the room, as a check upon my vivacity. -- I was not sorry for this precaution, because I could unbosom myself without reserve, before Miss Williams, who was the confidante of us both. -- I therefore gave a loose to the inspirations of my passion, which operated so successfully upon the tender affections of Narcissa, that she laid aside the restraint she had hitherto wore, and blessed me with the most melting declaration of her mutual flame! -- It was impossible for me to forbear taking the advantage of this endearing condescension. -- She now gently yielded to my embrace, while I encircling all that I held dear, within my arms, tasted in advance, the joys of that paradise I hoped in a little time wholly to possess! -- We spent the afternoon in all the exstacy of hope that the most fervent love exchanged by mutual vows could inspire; and Miss Williams was so much affected with our chaste caresses, which recalled the sad remembrance of what she was, that her eyes were filled with tears.  The evening being pretty far advanced, I forced myself from the dear object of my flame, who indulged me in a tender embrace at parting; and repairing to my lodgings, communicated to my friend Strap every circumstance of my happiness, which filled him with so much pleasure, that it run over at his eyes; and he prayed heartily, that no envious devil might, as formerly, dash the cup of blessing from my lip. -- When I reflected on what had happened, and especially on the unreserved protestations of Narcissa's love, I could not help being amazed at her omitting to enquire into the particular circumstances of the life and fortune of one whom she had favored with her affection, and I began to be a little anxious about the situation of her finances; well knowing that I should do an irreparable injury to the person my soul held most dear, if I should espouse her, without being enabled to support her in the rank which was certainly her due. -- I had heard indeed, while I served her aunt, that her father had left her a considerable sum; and that every body believed she would inherit the greatest part of her kinswoman's dowry, but I did not know how far she might be restricted by the old gentleman's will, in the enjoyment of what he left her; and I was too well informed of the virtuosi's late conduct, to think my mistress could have any expectations from that quarter. -- I confided, however, in the good sense and delicacy of my charmer, who, I was sure, would not consent to unite her fate with mine, before she had fully considered and provided for the consequence.  The Ball-night being arrived, I dressed myself in a suit I had reserved for some grand occasion; and having drank tea with Narcissa and her brother, conducted my angel to the scene, where she in a moment eclipsed all her female competitors for beauty, and attracted the admiration of the whole assembly. -- My heart dilated with pride on this occasion, and my triumph rejected all bounds, when, after we had danced together, a certain nobleman, remarkable for his figure and influence in the beau monde, came up, and in the hearing of all present, honored us with a very particular compliment, upon our accomplishments and appearance; -- but this transport was soon checked, when I perceived his lordship attach himself with great assiduity to my mistress; and say some warm things, which I thought, savoured too much of passion. -- It was then I began to feel the pangs of jealousy -- I dreaded the power and address of my rival -- I sickened at his discourse; when she opened her lips to answer, my heart died within me -- when she smiled, I felt the pains of the damned! -- I was enraged at his presumption; I cursed her complaisance! when he quitted her and went to the other side of the room. -- Narcissa suspecting nothing of the rage that inflamed me, put some questions to me, as soon as he was gone, to which I made no other reply than a grim look, which too well denoted the agitation of my breast, and surprised her not a little. -- She no sooner observed my emotion, than she changed color, and asked what ailed me; but before I could make answer, her brother pulling me by the sleeve, bid me take notice of a lady who sat fronting us, whom I immediately, to my vast astonishment, distinguished to be Melinda, accompanied by her mother and an elderly gentleman, whom I did not know. -- "Wounds! Mr. Randan, (cried the Squire) is she not a delicate piece of stuff? -- 'Sdeath! I have a good mind -- if I thought she was a single person." -- Notwithstanding the perplexity I was in, I had reflection enough to foresee that my passion might suffer greatly by the presence of this lady, who in all probability would revenge herself upon me for having formerly disgraced her, by spreading reports to my prejudice. -- I was therefore alarmed at these symptoms of the Squire's admiration; and for some time did not know what reply to make, when he asked my opinion of her beauty: At length I came to a determination, and told him that her name was Melinda, that she had a fortune of ten thousand pounds, and was said to be under promise of marriage to a certain lord, who deferred his nuptials, until he should be of age, which would happen in a few months: -- I thought this piece of intelligence, which I had myself invented, would have hindered him effectually from entertaining any further thoughts of her; but I was egregiously mistaken: The fox-hunter had too much self-sufficiency to despair of success with any competitor on earth. He therefore made light of her engagement, saying, with a smile of self-approbation, "Mayhap she will change her mind -- what signifies his being a Lord? -- I think myself as good a man as ever a Lord in christendom; and I Will see if a commoner worth three thousand a year will not serve her turn." -- This determination startled me not a little; I knew he would soon discover the contrary of what I advanced, and as I believed he would find her ear open to his addresses, did not doubt of meeting with every obstacle in my amor, that her malice could invent, and her influence with him execute. -- This reflection increased my chagrin -- My vexation was evident -- Narcissa insisted on going home immediately; and as I led her to the door, her noble admirer, with a look full of languishment, ditected to her a profound bow, which stung me to the soul. -- Before she went into the chair, she asked, with an appearance of concern, what was the matter with me? and I could pronounce no more than, "By heaven! I Am distracted!"  CHAP. LVIII. Tortured with jealousy, I go home and abuse Strap -- receive a message from Narcissa, in consequence of which, I hasten to her apartment, where her endearing assurances banish all my doubts and apprehensions -- in my retreat I discover somebody in the dark, whom, suspecting to be a spy, I resolve to kill: but, to my great surprise, am convinced of his being no other than Strap -- Melinda slanders me -- I become acquainted with Lord Quiverwit, who endeavors to sound me, with regard to Narcissa -- the Squire is introduced to his lordship, and grows cold toward me -- I learn from my confidante, that this nobleman professes honorable love to my mistress, who continues faithful to me, notwithstanding the scandalous reports she has heard to my prejudice -- I am mortified with an assurance that her whole fortune depends upon the pleasure of her brother -- Mr. Freeman condoles me on the decline of my character, which I vindicate so much to his satisfaction, that he undertakes to combat same in my behalf.  HAVING uttered this exclamation, at which she sighed, I went home in the condition of a frantic Bedlamite; and finding the fire in my apartment almost extinguished, vented my fury upon poor Strap, whose ear I pinched with such violence, that he roared hideously with pain, and when I quitted my hold looked so foolishly aghast, that no unconcerned spectator could have seen him, without been seized with an immoderate fit of laughter. -- It it true, I was soon sensible of the injury I had done, and asked pardon for the outrage I had committed; upon which my faithful valet, shaking his head, said, "I forgive you, and may God forgive you." -- But he could not help shedding some tears at my unkindness. I felt unspeakable remorse for what I had done, cursed my own ingratitude, and considered his tears as a reproach that my soul, in her present disturbance, could not bear. -- It set all my passions into a new ferment, I swore horrible oaths without meaning or application, I foamed at the mouth, kicked the chairs about the room, and played abundance of mad pranks that frightened my friend almost out of his senses. -- At length my transport subsided, I became melancholy, and wept insensibly.  During this state of dejection, I was surprised with the appearance of Miss Williams, whom Strap, blubbering all the while, had conducted into the chamber without giving me previous notice of her approach: -- She was extremely affected with my condition, which she had learned from him, begged me to moderate my passion, suspend my conjectures, and follow her to Narcissa, who desired to see me forthwith. -- That dear name operated upon me like a charm! I started up, and without opening my lips, was conducted into her apartment through the garden, which we entered by a private door. -- I found the adorable creature in tears! I was melted at the fight -- we continued silent for some time -- my heart was too full to speak -- her snowy bosom heaved with fond resentment; at last she sobbing cried, "What have I done to disoblige you?" -- My heart was pierced with the tender question! I drew near with the utmost reverence of affection! I fell upon my knees before her, and kissing her hand, exclaimed, "O! thou art all goodness and perfection! I am undone by my want of merit! I am unworthy to possess thy charms, which heaven has destined for the arms of some more favored being." -- She guessed the cause of my disquiet, upbraided me gently for my suspicion, and gave me such flattering assurances of her eternal fidelity, that all my doubts and fears forsook me, and peace and satisfaction reigned within my breast.  At midnight I left the kind nymph to her repose, and being let out by Miss Williams, at the garden gate by which I entered, began to explore my way homeward in the dark, when I heard at my back a noise like that of a baboon when he mows and chatters. I turned instantly, and perceiving something black, concluded I was discovered by some spy, employed to watch for that purpose: Arroused at this conjecture, by which the reputation of the virtuous Narcissa appeared in jeopardy, I drew my sword, and would have sacrificed him to her same, had not the voice of Strap restrained my arm: It was with great difficulty he could pronounce, "D -- d -- d -- do! mum -- um -- um -- murder me, if you please!" Such an effect had the cold upon his jaws, that his teeth rattled like a pair of castanets -- Pleased to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his consternation, and asked what brought him thither? Upon which he gave me to understand, that his concern for me had induced him to dodge me to that place, where the same reason had detained him till now; and he frankly owned, that in spite of the esteem he had for Miss Williams, he began to be very uneasy about me, considering the disposition in which I went abroad; and if I had staid much longer, would have certainly alarmed the neighborhood in my behalf. -- The knowledge of this his intention confounded me! I represented to him the mischievous consequences that would have attended such a rash action, and cautioning him severely against any such design for the future, concluded my admonition with an assurance, that in case he should ever act so madly, I would, without hesitation put him to death. -- "Have a little patience (cried he, in a lamentable tone) your displeasure will do the business, without your committing murder." -- I was touched with this reproach; and as soon as we got home, made it my business to appease him, by explaining the cause of that transport, during which I had used him so unworthily.  Next day when I went into the long room, I observed several whispers circulate all of a sudden; and did not doubt that Melinda had been busy with my character; but I consoled myself with the love of Narcissa, upon which I rested with the most perfect confidence, and going up to the rowly-powly table, won a few pieces from my suspected rival, who with an easy politeness, entered into conversation with me, and desiring my company to the coffee-house, treated me with tea and chocolate. -- I remembered Strutwell, and guarded against his insinuating behavior; nor was my suspicion wrong placed; he artfully turned the discourse upon Narcissa, and endeavored, by hinting at an intrigue he pretended to be engaged in elsewhere, to learn what connection there was between her and me. -- But all his finesse was ineffectual; I was convinced of his dissimulation, and gave such general answers to his inquiries, that he was forced to drop the subject and talk of something else.  While we conversed in this manner, the savage came in, with another gentleman, who introduced him to his lordship; and he was received with such peculiar marks of distinction, that I was persuaded the courtier intended to use him in some shape or another; and thence I conceived an unlucky omen. -- But I had more cause to be dismayed the following day, when I saw the Squire in company with Melinda and her mother, who honored me with several disdainful glances; and when I afterward threw myself in his way, instead of the cordial shake of the hand, returned my salute with a cold repetition of "Servant, servant," which he pronounced with such indifference, or rather contempt, that if he had not been Narcissa's brother I should have affronted him in public.  These occurrences disturbed me not a little, I foresaw the brooding storm, and armed myself with resolution for the occasion; but Narcissa being at stake, I was far from being resigned. -- I could have renounced every other comfort of life with some degree of fortitude; but the prospect of losing her, disabled all my philosophy, and tortured my soul into madness.  Miss Williams found me, next morning, full of anxious tumult, which did not abate, when she told me, that my Lord Quiverwit, having professed honorable intentions, had been introduced to my lovely Mistress by her brother, who had at the same time, from the information of Melinda, spoke of me as an Irish fortune-hunter, without either birth or estate to recommend me; who supported myself in the appearance of a gentleman by sharping, and other infamous practices; and who was of such an obscure origin, that I did not even know my own extraction. -- Though I expected all this, I could not hear it with temper, especially as truth was so blended with falsehood in the assertion, that it would be almost impossible to separate the one from the other in my vindication. -- But I said nothing on this head, being impatient to know how Narcissa had been affected with the discovery. -- That generous creature, far from believing these imputations, was no sooner withdrawn with her confidante, than she inveighed with great warmth against the malevolence of the world, to which only she ascribed the whole of what had been said to my disadvantage; and calling every circumstance of my behavior to her, into review before her, found every thing so polite, honorable and disinterested, that she could not harbor the least doubt of my being the gentleman I appeared to be. -- "I have indeed (said she) purposely forbore to ask the particulars of his life, lest the recapitulation of some misfortunes, which he has undergone, should give him pain: And as to the article of his fortune, I own myself equally afraid of inquiring into it, and of discovering the situation of my own, lest we should find ourselves both unhappy in the explanation; for alas! my provision is conditional, and depends entirely on my marrying with my brother's consent."  Thunderstruck with this intelligence, the light forsook my eyes, the color vanished from my cheeks, and I remained in a state of universal trepidation! -- My female friend perceiving my disorder, encouraged me with assurances of Narcissa's constancy, and the hope of some accident favorable to our love; and as a further consolation let me know, that she had acquaint^d my mistress with the out-lines of my life; and that although she was no stranger to the present low state of my finances, her love and esteem were rather increased than diminished by the knowledge of my circumstances. -- I was greatly comforted by this assurance, which saved me a world of confusion and anxiety: For I must have imparted my situation one day to Narcissa; and this I could not have done without shame and disorder.  As I did not doubt that by this time, the scandalous aspersions of Melinda were diffused all over the town, I resolved to collect my whole strength of assurance, to brow-beat the efforts of her malice, and to publish her adventure with the Frenchified barber, by way of reprisal. -- In the mean time, having promised to be at the garden gate about midnight, Miss Williams took her leave, bidding me repose myself entirely on the affection of my dear Narcissa, which was as perfect as inviolable. -- Before I went abroad I was visited by Freeman, who came on purpose to acquaint me with the infamous stories, that were raised at my expense; I heard them with great temper, and in my turn informed him of every thing that had happened between Melinda and me; and among other things entertained him with the story of the barber, letting him know what share his friend Banter had in that affair: He was convinced of the injury my reputation had suffered, and no longer doubting the source from whence this deluge of slander had flowed upon me, undertook to undeceive the town in my behalf, and roll the stream back upon its origin; but in the mean time cautioned me from appearing in public while the prepossession was strong against me, lest I should meet with some affront that might have bad consequences.  CHAP. LIX. I receive an extraordinary message at the door of the long room, which I however enter, and affront the Squire, who threatens to take the law of me -- I rebuke Melinda for her malice -- She weeps with vexation -- Lord Quiverwit is severe upon me -- I retort his sarcasm -- am received with the utmost tenderness by Narcissa, who desires to hear the story of my life -- we vow eternal constancy to one another -- I retire -- am waked by a messenger, who brings a challenge from Quiverwit, whom I meet, engage, and vanquish.
