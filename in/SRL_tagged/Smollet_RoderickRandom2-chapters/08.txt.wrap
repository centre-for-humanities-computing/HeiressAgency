sight, that this stone is a real diamond, and that of a very fine water. -- Take it in your hand, and examine it." -- He did so, with some confusion, and returned it, saying, "I ask your pardon, I see it is a true brilliant of immense value." -- I imagined his respect for me increased after this inquiry; therefore to captivate his esteem the more, I told him, I would show him a seal of composition, engraved after a very valuable antique; upon which I pulled out my watch with a rich gold chain, adorned with three seals set in gold, and an opal ring. -- He viewed each of them with great eagerness, handled the chain, admired the chased case, and observed, that the whole must have cost me a vast sum of money. I affected indifference, and replied in a careless manner, "Some trifle of sixty or seventy guineas." Upon which he stared in my face for some time, and then asked if I was an Englishman. -- I answered in the negative. -- "You are from Ireland then, Sir, I presume, (said he.)" I made the same reply. "O! perhaps (said he) you was born in one of our settlements abroad." -- I still answered no. -- He seemed very much surprised, and said, he was sure I was not a foreigner. I made no reply, but left him upon the tenter-hooks of impatient uncertainty. -- He could not contain his anxiety, but asked pardon for the liberties he had taken, and to encourage me the more to disclose my situation, displayed his own without reserve. -- "I am (said he) a single man, have a considerable annuity, on which I live according to my own inclination; and make the ends of the year meet very comfortably. -- As I have no estate to leave behind me, I am not troubled with the importunate officiousness of relations, or legacy hunters, and I consider the world as made for me, not me for the world: It is my maxim therefore to enjoy it while I can, and let futurity shift for itself." -- While he thus indulged his own talkative vein, and at the same time, no doubt, expected a retaliation from me; a young man entered, dressed in black velvet and an enormous tye-wig, with an air in which natural levity and affected solemnity were so jumbled together, that on the whole, he appeared a burlesque on all decorum. This ridiculous oddity danced up to the table at which we sat, and after a thousand grimaces, asked my friend by the name of Mr: Medlar, if we were not engaged upon business. -- My companion put on a surly countenance, and replied, "No great business, doctor -- but however." -- "O! then (cried the physician) I must beg your indulgence a little, pray pardon me, gentlemen. -- Sir, (said, he, addressing himself to me) your most humble servant, I hope you will forgive me, Sir -- I must beg the favor to sit -- Sir -- Sir -- I have something of consequence to impart to my friend Mr. Medlar -- Sir, I hope you will excuse my freedom in whispering, Sir." -- Before I had time to give this complaisant person my permission, Mr. Medlar cried, "I Will have no whispering -- if you have any thing to say to me, speak with an audible voice." -- The doctor seemed a little disconcerted at this exclamation, and turning again to me, making a thousand apologies for pretending to make a mystery of any thing, which he said was owing to his ignorance of my connection with Mr. Medlar; but now he understood I was a friend, he would communicate what he had to say, in my hearing. -- He then began, after two or three hems, in this manner: -- "You must know Sir, I am just come from dinner at my lady Flareit's, (then addressing himself to me) a lady of quality, Sir, at whose table I have the honor of dining sometimes. -- There was lady Stately, and my lady Larum, and Mrs. Dainty, and Miss Biddy Gigler, upon my word, a very good natured young lady, with a very pretty fortune, Sir. -- There was also my Lord Straddle, Sir John Shrug, and master Billy Chatter, who is actually a very facetious young gentleman. -- So, Sir, her ladyship seeing me excessively fatigued, for she was the last of fifteen patients (people of distinction, Sir) whom I had visited this forenoon, -- insisted upon my staying dinner, -- though upon my word, I protest I had no appetite; however, in compliance with her ladyship's request, Sir, I sat down, and the conversation turning on different subjects, among other things, Mr. Chatter asked very earnestly when I saw Mr. Medlar. -- I told him I had not had the pleasure of seeing you these nineteen hours and a half; for you may remember, Sir, it was nearly about that time; I will not be positive as to a minute." -- "No! (says he) then I desire you will go to his lodgings immediately after dinner, and see what is the matter with him, for he must certainly be very bad from having eat last night such a vast quantity of raw oysters." -- The crusty gentleman, who from the solemnity of his delivery, expected something extraordinary, no sooner heard his conclusion, than he started up in a testy humor, crying, "Pshaw, pshaw! d -- n your oysters;" and walked away after a short compliment of "Your servant, Sir," to me. -- The doctor got up also, saying, "I vow and protest, upon my word, I am actually amazed." -- and followed. Mr. Medlar to the bar, which was hard by, where he was paying for the coffee; there he whispered so loud that I could over-hear, "Pray, who is this gentleman?" -- His friend replied hastily, "I might have known that before now, if it had not been for your impertinent intrusion," -- and walked away very much disappointed. -- The ceremonious physician returned immediately and sat down by me, asking a thousand pardons for leaving me alone; and giving me to understand that what he had communicated to Mr. Medlar at the bar was an affair of the last importance, that would admit of no delay. -- He then called for some coffee, and launched out into the virtues of that berry, which, he said, in cold phlegmatic constitutions, like his, dried up the superfluous moisture, and braced the relaxed nerves. -- He let me know, that it was utterly unknown to the ancients; and derived its name from an Arabian word, which I might easily perceive by the sound and termination. -- From this topic he transferred his disquisitions to the verb drink, which he affirmed, was improperly applied to the taking of coffee, in as much as people did not drink, but sip or sipple that liquor; -- that the genuine meaning of drinking is to quench one's thirst, or commit a debauch by swallowing wine; -- that the Latin word, which conveyed the same idea, was bibere or potare, and that of the Greeks pinein or poteein, though he was apt to believe they were differently used on different occasions: For example; to drink a vast quantity, or, as the vulgar express it, to drink an ocean of liquor, was in Latin potare, and in Greek poteein; and on the other hand, to use it moderately, was bibere and pinein; -- that this was only a conjecture of his own, which, however, seemed to be supported by the word bibulous, which is particularly applied to the pores of the skin, that can only drink a very small quantity of the circumambient moisture, by reason of the smallness of their diameters; -- whereas, from the verb poteein, is derived the substantive potamos, which signifies a river, or vast quantity of liquor. -- I could not help smiling at this learned and important investigation; and to recommend myself the more to my new acquaintance, whose disposition I was by this time well informed of, I observed, that what he alleged, did not, to the best of my remembrance, appear in the writings of the ancients; for, Horace uses the words poto and bibo indifferently for the same purpose, as in the twentieth Ode of his first Book. Vile potabis modicis sabinum cantharis, -- -- Et proelo domitam caleno tu bibes uvam. That I had never heard of the verb poteein, but that potamos, potema, and potos, were derived from pino, poso, pepoka; in consequence of which, the Greek poets never use any other word for festal drinking. -- Homer describes Nestor at his cups in these words: Nestora d' ouk elathen jache pinonta perempes. And Anacreon mentions it on the same occasion almost in every page, Pionti d' oinon hedun Otan pino ton oinon. Opliz' ego de pino. And in a thousand other places. -- The doctor, who, doubtless, intended by his criticism, to give me an high idea of his erudition, was infinitely surprised to find himself schooled by one in my appearance; and after a considerable pause, cried, "Upon my word! you are in the right, Sir. -- I find I have not considered this affair with my usual accuracy. -- Then accosting me, in Latin, which he spoke very well, the conversation was maintained full two hours, on a variety of subjects, in that language; and indeed, he spoke so judiciously, that I was convinced, notwithstanding his whimsical appearance, and attention to trifles, of his being a man of extensive knowledge, especially in books; he looked upon upon me, as I afterward understood from Mr. Medlar, as a prodigy in learning, and proposed that very night, if I was not engaged, to introduce me to several young gentlemen of fortune and fashion, with whom he had an appointment at the Bedford coffee-house.
