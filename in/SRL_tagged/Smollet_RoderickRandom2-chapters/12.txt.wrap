not permit me to follow; for he no sooner left me, in order to do justice to my character among his friends and acquaintance, than I sallied out, and went directly to the long-room. -- I was met at the door by a servant, who presented to me a billet without a subscription, importing that my presence was disagreeable to the company, and desiring I would take the hint without further disturbance, and bestow myself elsewhere for the future. -- This peremptory message filled me with indignation. -- I followed the fellow who delivered it, and seizing him by the collar, in presence of all the company, threatened to put him instantly to death, if he did not discover the scoundrel who had charged him with such an impudent commission, that I might punish him as he deserved. -- The messenger, affrighted at my menaces and furious looks, fell upon his knees, and told me, that the gentleman who ordered him to deliver the letter was no other than Narcissa's brother, who at that time stood at the other end of the room, talking to Melinda. -- I went up to him immediately, and in the hearing of his inamorata, accosted him in these words: "Lookee, Squire, was it not for one consideration that protects you from my resentment, I would cane you where you stand, for having had the presumption to send me this scurrilous intimation," which I tore to pieces and threw in his face; at the same time dartingan angry regard at his mistress, and telling her, I was sorry she had put it out of my power to compliment her upon her invention, but at the expense of her good nature and veracity. -- Her admirer, whose courage never rose but in proportion to the wine he had swallowed, instead of resenting my address in what is called an honorable way, threatened to prosecute me for an assault, and took witnesses accordingly; while she, piqued at his pusilanimous behavior, and enraged at the sarcasm I had uttered against her, endeavored to make her quarrel a public cause, and wept aloud with spite and vexation. -- The tears of a lady could not fail of attracting the notice and concern of the spectators, to whom she complained of my rudeness, with great bitterness, saying, If she was a man I durst not use her so. -- The greatest part of the gentlemen, already prejudiced against me, were offended at the liberty I had taken, as appeared from their looks; though none of them signified their disgust any other way, except my Lord Quiverwit, who ventured to say with a sneer, that I was in the right to establish my own character, of which he had now no longer any doubt. -- Nettled at this severe equivoque, which raised a laugh at my expense, I replied with some warmth, "I am proud of having in that particular got the start of your lordship." -- He made no answer to my repartee, but with a contemptuous smile, walked off, leaving me in a very disagreeable situation. -- In vain did I make up to several people of my acquaintance, whose conversation, I hoped, would banish my confusion; every body shunned me like a person infected, and I should not have been able to bear my disgrace, had not the idea of the ever faithful and fond Narcissa come to my relief. -- I quitted the scene of my mortification, and sauntering about the town, happened to wake from my contemplation, when I found myself just opposite to a toy-shop, which I entered, and purchased a ring set with a ruby in the form of a heart, surrounded by diamond sparks, for which I paid ten guineas, intending it for a present to the charmer of my soul.  I was introduced, at the hour appointed, to this divine creature, who, notwithstanding what she had heard to my disadvantage, received me with the utmost confidence and tenderness; and having been informed of the general sketches of my life, by Miss Williams, expressed a desire of knowing the particular circumstances, which I related with great candor, omitting however, some things which I concluded altogether improper for her ear, and which the reader's reflection will easily suggest. -- As my story was little else than a recital of misfortunes, the tear of sympathy ceased not to trickle from her enchanting eyes, during the whole of the narration, which when I had finished, she recompensed me for my trouble, with the most endearing protestations of eternal love. -- She bewailed her restricted condition, as it was the means of retarding my happiness; told me, that Lord Quiverwit, by her brother's permission, had been to drink tea with her that very afternoon, and actually proposed marriage; and seeing me extremely affected with this piece of information, offered to give me a convincing proof of her affection, by espousing me in private, and leaving the rest to fate. -- I was penetrated with this instance of her regard, but that I might not be outdone in generosity, resisted the bewitching temptation, in consideration of her honor and interest; at the same time, presented my ring as a pledge of my inviolable attachment, and on my knees, implored heaven to shower its curses on my head, if ever my heart should entertain one thought unworthy of the passion that I then avowed. -- She received my token, gave me in return her picture in miniature, exquisitely drawn and set in gold; and in the same posture called heaven to witness and to judge her flame. -- Our vows thus reciprocally breathed, a confidence of hope ensued, and our mutual fondness becoming as intimate as innocence would allow, I grew insensible of the progress of time, and it was morning before I could tear myself from this darling of my soul! -- My good angel foresaw what would happen, and prompted me to indulge myself on this occasion, in consideration of the fatal absence I was doomed to suffer.  I went to bed immediately on my return to my lodging, and having slept about two hours, was waked by Strap, who, in great confusion, told me, there was a footman below with a letter for me, which he would deliver to no body but myself. -- Alarmed at this piece of news, I desired my friend to show him up to my chamber, and received a letter from him, which, he said, required an immediate answer: Upon which I opened it, and read  SIR, WHEN any man injures my honor, let the difference of rank between us be ever so great, I am contented to wave the privilege of my quality, and seek reparation from him on equal terms. -- The insolence of your reply to me yesterday, in the longroom, I might have overlooked, had not your presumptive emulation in a much more interesting affair, and a discovery which I made this morning, concurred in persuading me to chastise your audacity with my sword. -- If you therefore, have spirit enough to support the character you assume, you will not fail to follow the bearer immediately to a convenient place, where you shall be met by  Quiverwit.   Whether I was enervated by the love and favor of Narcissa, or awed by the superior station of my antagonist, I know not, but I never had less inclination to fight than at this time: However, finding there was a necessity for vindicating the reputation of my mistress, as well as for asserting my own honor, I forthwith rose, and dressing in a hurry, put on my sword, bid Strap attend me, and set out with my conductor, cursing my bad fortune all the way, for having been observed in my return from my angel -- So I interpreted his lordship discovery. -- When I came within sight of my rival, his lacquey told me, he had orders to stop; upon which, I commanded Strap to halt also, while I walked forward; resolved, if possible, to come to an explanation with my challenger, before we should come to battle. -- Nor was an opportunity wanting; for I no sooner approached, than he asked with a stern countenance, what business I had in Mr. Tophall's garden, so early in the morning: -- "I don't know, my Lord, (said I) how to answer a question put to me with such a magisterial haughtiness. -- If your lordship will please to expostulate calmly, you will have no cause to repent of your condescension -- Otherwise, I am not to be intimidated into any confession." -- "There Is no room for denial (answered he) I saw you come out with my own eyes." -- "Did any other person see me?" (said I.) -- "I neither know nor care (said he) I want no other evidence than that of my own senses." -- Pleased to hear that the suspicion was confined to him alone, I endeavored to appease his jealousy, by owning an intrigue with the waiting-maid; but he had too much discernment to be so easily imposed upon, and told me there was only one way to convince him of the truth of what I alleged; which was no other than renouncing all claim to Narcissa upon oath, and promising upon honor, never to speak to her for the future. -- Exasperated at this proposal, I unsheathed my sword, saying, "Heavens! what title have you, or any man on earth, to impose such terms on me!" He did the same, and making toward me with a contracted brow, said I was a villain, and had dishonored Narcissa. -- "He Is a scandalous villain (I replied, in a transport of fury) who brands me with that imputation! She is a thousand times more chaste than the mother who bore you; and I will assert her honor with my heart's blood!" -- So saying, I rushed upon him with more eagerness than address, and endeavoring to get within his point, received a wound in my neck, which redoubled my rage. -- He excelled me in temper as well as in skill, by which means he parried my thrusts with great calmness, until I had almost exhausted my spirits; and when he perceived me beginning to flag, attacked me fiercely in his turn. -- Finding himself however better opposed than he expected, he resolved to follow his long, and close with me; accordingly, his sword entered my waistcoat, on the side of the breast bone, and running up between my shirt and skin, appeared over my left shoulder: I imagined that his weapon had perforated my lungs, and of consequence, that the wound was mortal; therefore determined not to die unrevenged, I seized his shell, which was close to my breast, before he could disintangle his point, and keeping it fast with my left hand, shortened my own sword with my right, intending to run him through the heart; but he received the thrust in the left arm, which penetrated up to the shoulder blade. -- Disappointed in this expectation, and afraid still that death would frustrate my revenge, I grappled with him, and being much the stronger, threw him upon the ground, where I wrested his sword out of his hand, and so great was my confusion, instead of turning the point upon him, struck out three of his fore-teeth with the hilt. -- In the mean time, our servants seeing us fall, run up to separate and assist us; but before their approach, I was upon my feet, and had discovered, that my supposed mortal wound was only a slight scratch. The knowledge of my own safety, disarmed me of a good deal of my resentment, and I began to enquire with some concern into the situation of my antagonist, who remained on the ground bleeding plentifully at his mouth and arm. -- I helped his footman to raise him, and having bound up his wound with my handkerchief, assured him it was not dangerous; I likewise restored his sword, and offered to support him to his own house. -- He thanked me, with an air of sullen dignity; and whispering to me, that I should hear from him soon, went away, leaning on his servant's shoulder.  I was surprised at this promise, which I construed into a threat, and resolved, if ever he should call me out again, to use whatever advantage fortune might give me over him, in another manner. -- In the mean time, I had leisure to take notice of Strap, who seemed quite stupefied with horror; and (after having recovered him from his exstasy, with an assurance that I had received no damage) to explain the nature of this affair as we walked homeward. -- By that time I had got into my apartment, I found the wound in my neck stiff and uneasy, and a good deal of clotted blood run down upon my shirt: Upon which I pulled off my coat and waistcoat, and unbuttoned my collar, that I might dress it with more ease. -- My friend no sooner perceived my shirt quite dyed with blood, than imagining I had got at least twenty dreadful wounds, he cried, "O Jesus!" and fell flat on the floor. -- I stopped the bleeding with a little dry lint, and applying a plaster over it, cleaned myself from the gore, shifted and dressed, while he lay senseless at my feet; so that when he recovered, and saw me perfectly well, he could scarce believe his own eyes. -- Now that the danger was past, I was very well pleased with what had happened, which I did not doubt, would soon become known, and consequently dignify my character not a little in this place. -- I was also proud of having shown myself, in some shape, worthy of the love of Narcissa, who, I was persuaded, would not think the worse of me for what I had done.  CHAP. LX. I am visited by Freeman, with whom I appear in public, and am carressed -- I am sent for by Lord Quiverwit, whose presence I quit in a passion -- Narcissa is carried off by her brother -- I intend to pursue him, and am dissuaded by my friend -- I engage in play, and lose all my money -- set out for London -- try my fortune at the gaming-table, without success -- receive a letter from Narcissa -- bilk my tailor.  WHILE I entertained myself with these reflections, the news of this duel being communicated by some unknown channel, spread all over the town. -- I was visited by Freeman, who testified his surprise at finding me, having been told, that Lord Quiverwit being dead of his wounds, I had absconded, in order to avoid the cognizance of the law. I asked if people guessed the occasion of the quarrel; and understanding it was attributed to his lordship's resentment of my reply in the Long-room, confirmed that conjecture, glad to find Narcissa unsuspected. -- My friend, after I had assured him that my antagonist was in no danger, wished me joy of the event, than which, he said, nothing could happen more opportunely to support the idea he had given of my character, to his friends, among whom he had been very assiduous in my behalf.  On the strength of this assurance, I went with him to the coffee-house, where I was saluted by a great many of those very persons, who shunned me the preceding day. -- And I found every body making merry with the story of Melinda's French gallant. -- While I remained in this place, I received a message from Lord Quiverwit, desiring, if I was not engaged, to see me at his house.  Thither I immediately repaired, and was conducted to an apartment where I was received by his lordship in bed. -- Being lest by ourselves, he thanked me in very polite terms, for having used the advantage fortune had given me over him, with such moderation; and asked pardon for any offense his resentment might have prompted him to commit. -- "I would willingly, (said he) make you my friend; but as it is impossible for me to divest myself of my passion for Narcissa, I am too well convinced of your sentiments, to think we shall ever agree on that subject. I took the liberty, therefore, of sending for you, in order to own heartily, that I cannot help opposing your success with that young lady; though at the same time, I promise to regulate my opposition by the dictates of justice and honor: This, however, I think proper to advertise you of, that she has no independent fortune, and if you should even succeed in your addresses, you would have the mortification to see her reduced to indigence, unless you have wherewithal to support her -- And I am credibly informed of your incapacity that way. -- Nay, I will confess, that, urged by this consideration, I have actually sent notice to her brother, of the progress I suspect you have made in her affection, and desired him to take his precautions accordingly." -- Alarmed and provoked at this information, I told his lordship, that I did not see how he could reconcile that piece of conduct with his profession of open dealing, and flung away from him in a passion.  As I walked homeward, in hopes of hearing from my mistress as usual by means of Miss Williams, I was surprised with the waving of a handkerchief, from the window of a coach and six that passed by me at full speed; and upon further observation, I saw a servant on horseback riding after it, who, I knew by his livery, belonged to the Squire. -- Thunderstruck with this discovery, the knowledge of my misfortune rushed all at once upon my reflection! I guessed immediately that the signal was made by the dear hand of Narcissa, who being hurried away in consequence of Lord Quiverwit's message to her brother, had no other method of relating her distress, and imploring my assistance. -- Frantic with this conjecture, I run to my lodging, snatched my pistols, and ordered Strap to get posthorses, with such incoherence of speech and disorder, that the poor valet, terrified with the suspicion of another duel, instead of providing what I desired, went forthwith to Freeman, who being informed of my behavior, came straight to my apartment, and conjured me so pathetically to acquaint him with the cause of my uneasiness, that I could not refuse to tell him my happiness was fled with Narcissa, and that I must retrieve her or perish. He represented the madness of such an undertaking, and endeavored to divert me from it with great strength of friendship and reason: But all his arguments would have been ineffectual, had he not put me in mind of the dependence I ought to have on the love of Narcissa, and attachment of her maid, which could not fail of finding opportunities enough to advertise me of their situation; and at the same time, demonstrated the injury my charmer's reputation must suffer from my precipitate retreat. I was convinced and composed by these considerations: I appeared in public with an air of tranquillity, was well received by the best company in town, and my misfortune taking air, condoled accordingly; while I had the satisfaction of seeing Melinda so universally discountenanced, that she was fain to return to London, in order to avoid the scoffs and censure of the ladies at Bath. -- But though the hope of hearing from the darling of my soul supported my spirits a little while, I began to be very uneasy, when at the end of several weeks, I found that expectation disappointed. -- In short, melancholy and despondence took possession of my soul; and repining at that providence, which by acting the stepmother toward me, kept me from the fruition of my wishes, I determined, in a fit of despair, to risk all I had at the gaming table, with a view of acquiring a fortune sufficient to render me independent for life; or of plunging myself into such a state of misery, as would effectually crush every ambitious hope that now tortured my imagination.  Actuated by this fatal resolution, I engaged in play, and after some turns of fortune, found myself, at the end of three days, worth a thousand pounds; but it was not my intention to stop there, for which cause I kept Strap ignorant of my success, and continued my career, until I was reduced to five guineas, which I would have hazarded also, had I not been ashamed to fall from a bett of two hundred pounds to such a petty sum.  Having thus executed my scheme, I went home, amazed to find myself so much at ease, and informed my friend Strap of my mischance, with such calmness, that he imagining I joked, affected to receive the tidings with great equanimity. -- But both he and I found ourselves mistaken very soon. -- I had misinterpreted my own stupidity into deliberate resignation, and he had reason to believe me in earnest, when he saw me next morning agitated with the most violent despair, which he endeavored to alleviate with all the consolation in his power.  In one of my lucid intervals, however, I charged him to take a place in the stage coach for London; and in the mean time, paid my debts in Bath, which amounted to thirty shillings only. -- Without taking leave of my friends I embarked, Strap having the good fortune to find a return horse, and arrived in town, without having met with any thing remarkable on the road; save that, while we crossed Bagshot Heath, I was seized with a sort of inclination to retrieve my fortune, by laying passengers under contribution, in some such place. -- My thoughts were so circumstanced at this time, that I should have digested the crime of robbery, so righteously had I concerted my plan, and ventured my life in the execution, had I not been deterred by reflecting upon the infamy that attends detection.  The apartment I formerly lived in being unengaged, I took possession of it, and next day went in quest of Banter, who received me with open arms, in expectation of having his bond discharged to his liking: But when he understood what had happened, his countenance changed of a sudden; and he told me, with a dryness of displeasure peculiar to himself, that if he was in my place, he would put it out of fortune's power to play him such another trick, and be avenged of his own indiscretion at once. -- When I desired him to explain his meaning, he pointed to his neck, raised himself on his tip-toes, and was going away without any further ceremony, when I put him in mind of my indigence, and demanded the five guineas I had formerly lent him. "Five guineas! (cried he) Zounds! had you acted with common prudence you might have had twenty thousand in your pocket by this time. -- I depended upon five hundred from you, as much as if I had had notes for it in the bank; and by all the rules of equity, you are indebted to me for that sum." -- I was neither pleased nor convinced by this computation, and insisted on my right with such determined obstinacy, that he was fain to alter his tone, and appease my clamor, by assuring me, that he was not master of five shillings. -- Society in distress, generally promotes good understanding among people; from being a dun, I descended to be a client, and asked his advice about repairing my losses. -- He counseled me to have recourse again to the gaming table, where I had succeeded so well before, and to put myself in a condition, by selling my watch. -- I followed his directions, and having accommodated him with a few pieces, went to the place, where I lost every shilling.  I returned to my lodgings full of desperate resolution, and having made Strap acquainted with my fate, ordered him to pawn my sword immediately, that I might be enabled to make another effort. -- This affectionate creature no sooner understood my purpose, than seized with insuppressible sorrow at the prospect of my misery, he burst into tears, and asked what I proposed to do after the small sum he could raise on the sword should be spent: "On my own account (said he) I am quite unconcerned; for while God spares me health and these ten fingers, I can earn a comfortable subsistence any where; but what must become of you, who have less humility to stoop, and more appetites to gratify." -- Here I interrupted him, by saying, with a gloomy aspect, I could never want a resource while I had a loaded pistol in possession. -- Stupefied with horror, at this dreadful insinuation, he stood mute for some time, and then broke out into "God of his infinite mercy enable you to withstand that temptation of the devil! -- consider your immortal soul -- there is no repentance in the grave! -- O Lord! that ever it should come to this -- Are we not enjoined to resign ourselves to the will of heaven? -- where is your patience? -- Durum patientia frango -- you are but a young man -- there may be many good things in store for you -- accidit in puncto, quid non speratur in anno -- remember your uncle, Mr. Bowling; perhaps he is now on his voyage homeward, pleasing himself with the hopes of finding and relieving you -- nay, peradventure he is already arrived, the ship was expected about this time." -- A ray of hope shot athwart the darkness of my soul, at this suggestion; I thanked my friend for his seasonable recollection, and after having promised to take no resolution till his return, dismissed him to Wapping for intelligence.  In his absence I was visited by Banter, who being informed of my bad luck at play, told me, that fortune would probably be one day weary of persecuting me, "In the mean time, (said he) here is a letter for you, which I received just now enclosed in one from Freeman." -- I snatched it with eagerness, and knowing the superscription to be of Narcissa's handwriting, kissed it with transport, and having opened it, read  IT is with great difficulty, that I have stolen from the observation of those spies who are set over me, this opportunity of telling you, that I was suddenly carried away from Bath, by my brother, who was informed of our correspondence by Lord Quiverwit, whom, I since understand, you have wounded in a duel on my account. -- As I am fully convinced of your honor and love, I hope I shall never hear of such desperate proofs of either for the future. -- I am so strictly watched, that it will be impossible for you to see me, until my brother's suspicion shall abate, or heaven contrive some other unforeseen event in our behalf. -- In the mean time, you may depend on the constancy and affection of  Your own NARCISSA. P. S. Miss Williams, who is my fellow prisoner, desires to be remembered to you -- We are both in good health, and only in pain for you, especially, as it will be impracticable for you to convey any message or letter to the place of our confinement -- for which reason, pray desist from the attempt, that by miscarrying must prolong our captivity.  N --.     This kind letter afforded me great consolation: I communicated it to Banter, and at the same time, showed him her picture: He approved her beauty and good sense, and could not help owning, that my neglect of Miss Snapper was excusable, when such a fine creature engrossed my attention.  I began to be reconciled to my fate, and imagined, that if I could contrive means of subsisting until my uncle should arrive, in case he was not already at home, that he would enable me to do something effectual in behalf of my love and fortune -- I therefore consulted Banter about a present supply, who no sooner understood that I had credit with a tailor, than he advised me to take off two or three suits of rich clothes and convert them into cash, by selling them at half price to a salesman in Monmouth-street. -- I was a little startled at his proposal, which I thought savoured a little of fraud; but he rendered it palatable, by observing, that in a few months, I might be in a condition to do every body justice; and in the mean time, I was acquitted by the honesty of my intention -- I suffered myself to be persuaded by his salvo, by which my necessity, rather than my judgment, was convinced; and when I found there were no accounts of the ship in which my uncle embarked, actually put the scheme in practice, and raised by it, five and twenty guineas, paying him for his advice with the odd five.  CHAP. LXI. I am arrested -- carried to the Marshalsea -- find my old acquaintance beau Jackson in that jail -- he informs me of his adventures -- Strap arrives, and with difficulty is comforted -- Jackson introduces me to a poet -- I admire his conversation and capacity -- am deeply affected with my misfortune -- Strap hires himself as a journeyman-barber.  BUT this expedient was in a few weeks attended with a consequence I did not foresee: a player having purchased one of the suits which were exposed to sale, appeared in it on the stage one night, while my tailor unfortunately happened to be present. -- He knew it immediately, and enquiring minutely into the affair, discovered my whole contrivance: upon which he came to my lodgings, and telling me that he was very much straitened for want of money, presented his bill, which amounted to 50 l. -- Surprised at this unexpected address, I affected to treat him cavalierly, swore some oaths, asked if he doubted my honor, and, telling him I should take care who I dealt with for the future, bid him come again in three days. -- He obeyed me punctually, demanded his money, and finding himself amused with bare promises, arrested me that very day in the street. -- I was not much shocked at this adventure, which, indeed, rescued me from a horrible suspense in which I had lived since his first visit. I refused to go to a spunging-house, where I had heard there was nothing but the most flagrant imposition; and a coach being called, I was carried to the Marshalsea, attended by a bailiff and his follower, who were very much disappointed and chagrined at my resolution.  The turnkey guessing, from my appearance, that I had got money in my pocket, received me with the repetition of the Latin word depone, and gave me to understand, that I must pay beforehand for the apartment I should choose to dwell in. -- s desired to see his conveniences, and hired a small, paultry bedchamber, for a crown a week, which, in any other place, would not have let at eighteen-pence. -- Having taken possession of this dismal habitation, I sent for Strap, and my thoughts were busied in collecting matter of consolation to that faithful squire, when somebody knocked at my door, which I no sooner opened, than a young fellow entered, in very shabby clothes and mavelous foul linen. After a low bow, he called me by my name, and asked if I had forgot him. His voice assisted me in recollecting this person, whom I soon recognized to be my old acquaintance beau Jackson, of whom mention is made in the first part of my memoirs. -- I saluted him, expressed my satisfaction at finding him alive, and condoled with him on his present situation; which, however, did not seem to affect him much, for he laughed very heartily at the occasion of our meeting so unexpectedly in this place. After our mutual compliments were over, I enquired about his amor with the lady of fortune, which seemed to be so near an happy conclusion when I had the pleasure of seeing him last: and after an immoderate fit of laughter, he gave me to understand, that he had been egregiously bit in that affair. -- "You must know, (said she) that a few days after our adventure with the bawd and her b -- ches, I found means to be married to that same fine lady you speak of, and passed the night with her at her lodgings, so much to her satisfaction, that early in the morning, after a good deal of sniveling and sobbing, she owned, that so far from being an heiress of a great fortune, she was no other than a common woman of the town, who had decoyed me into matrimony, in order to enjoy the privilege of a semme couverte; and that, unless I made my escape immediately, I should be arrested for a debt of her contracting, by bailiffs employed and instructed for that purpose. -- Startled at this intimation, I got up in a twinkling, and taking leave of my spouse with several hearty damns, got safe into the verge of the court; where I kept snug, until I was appointed surgeon's mate of a man of war at Portsmouth; for which place I set out on a Sunday, went on board of my ship, in which I sailed to the Straits, where I had the good fortune to be made surgeon of a sloop that came home in a few months after, and was put out of commission: whereupon I came to London, imagining myself forgotten and freed from my wife and her creditors; but had not been in town a week before I was arrested for a debt here is, amounting to 20 l. and brought to this place, where I have been fixed by another action since that time. -- However, you know my disposition; I defy care and anxiety; and being on the half-pay list, make shift to live here tolerably easy." -- I congratulated him on his philosophy, and remembering that I was in his debt, repaid the money he formerly lent me, which, I believe, was far from being unseasonable. I then enquired about the economy of the place, which he explained to my satisfaction; and after we had agreed to mess together, he was just going to give orders for dinner when Strap arrived.  I never in my life saw sorrow so extravagantly expressed in any countenance, as in that of my honest friend, which was, indeed, particularly adapted by nature for such impressions. -- Being left by ourselves, I communicated to him my disaster, and endeavored to console him with the same arguments he had formerly used to me, withal representing the fair chance I had of being relieved, in a short time, by Mr. Bowling. -- But his grief was unutterable; he seemed to give attention without listening, and wrung his hands in silence; so that I was in a fair way of being infected with his behavior, when Jackson returned, and perceiving the deference I paid to Strap, although in a footman's habit, distributed his crumbs of comfort with such mirth, jollity and unconcern, that the features of the distressed squire relaxed by degrees, he recovered the use of speech, and begun to be a little more reconciled to this lamentable event. -- We dined together on beiled beef and greens, brought from a cook's shop in the neighborhood: and although this meal was served up in a manner little corresponding with the sphere of life in which I had lately lived, I made a virtue of necessity, eat with good appetite, and treated my friends with a bottle of wine, which had the desired effect, of increasing the good humor of my fellow-prisoner, and exhilarating the spirits of Strap, who now talked of my misfortune en Cavalier.  After dinner Jackson lest us to our private affairs; when I desired my friend to pack up all our things, and carry them to some cheap lodging he should choose for himself in the neighborhood of the Marshalsea, after he had discharged my lodging, for which I gave him money. -- I likewise recommended to him the keeping my misfortune secret, and saying to my landlord, or any other who should enquire for me, that I was gone into the country for a few weeks: at the same time I laid strong injunctions upon him to call every second day upon Banter, in case he should receive any letters for me from Narcissa, by the canal of Freeman; and by all means to leave a direction for himself, at my uncle's lodgings in Wapping, by which I might be found when my kinsman should arrive.  When he departed to execute these orders, (which, by the bye, were punctually performed that very night) I found myself so little seasoned to my situation, that I dreaded reflection, and sought shelter from it in the company of the beau, who, promising to regale me with a lecture upon taste, conducted me to the common side, where I saw a number of naked miserable wretches assembled together. -- We had not been here many minutes, when a figure appeared, wrapped in a dirty rug, tied about his loins with two pieces of list, of different colors, knotted together; having a black bushy beard, and his head covered with a huge mass of brown periwig, which seemed to have been ravished from the crown of some scare crow. -- This apparition, stalking in with great solemnity, made a profound bow to the audience, who signified their approbation by a general response of "How do you do, doctor?" He then turned toward us, and honored Jackson with a particular salutation: upon which my friend, in a formal manner, introduced him to me, by the name of Mr. Melopoyn. -- This ceremony being over, he advanced into the middle of the congregation, which crowded around him, and hemming three times, to my utter astonishment, pronounced with great significance of voice and gesture, a very elegant and ingenious discourse upon the difference between genius and taste, illustrating his assertions with apt quotations from the best authors, ancient as well as modern. When he had finished his harangue, which lasted a full hour, he bowed again to the spectators; not one of whom (I was informed) understood so much as a sentence of what he uttered.
