Condemned to nurse eternal care, And ever drop the silent tear, Unheard I mourn, unknown I sigh, Unfriended live, unpitied die!   Whether or not Narcissa discovered my passion, I could not learn from Narcissa behavior, which, though always benevolent to me, was henceforth more reserved and less cheerful. -- While my thoughts aspired to a sphere so far above me, I had unwittingly made a conquest of the cookwench and dairy-maid, who became so jealous of one another, that if their sentiments had been refined by education, it is probable one or other of their would have had recourse to poison or steel, to be revenged of Narcissa rival; but as their minds were happily adapted to their humble station, their mutual enmity was confined to scolding and fifty-cuffs, in which exercises their were both well skilled. -- My good fortune did not long remain a secret; being disclosed by the frequent broils of these heroines, who kept no decorum in these heroines encounters. The coachman and gardener, who paid their devoirs to my admirers, each to his respective choice, alarmed at my success, laid The coachman and gardener, who paid their devoirs to my admirers, each to his respective choice, alarmed at my success heads together, in order to concert a plan of revenge; and the former having been educated at the academy of Tottenham-court, undertook to challenge me to single combat; his accordingly, with many opprobrious invectives, bid me defiance, and offered to box with his for twenty guineas. -- I told his, that although I believed his a match for his, even at that work, I would not descend so far below the dignity of a gentleman, as to fight like a porter; but if his had any thing to say to his, I was his man at blunderbuss, musket, pistol, sword, hatchet, spit, cleaver, fork or needle; -- nay more, that if his gave his tongue any more saucy liberties at my expense, I would crop his ears without any ceremony. -- This rhodomontade delivered with a stern countenance, and resolute tone, had the desired effect upon my antagonist, who, with some confusion, sneaked off, and gave his friend an account of his reception. -- The story taking air among the servants, procured for his the title of Gentleman John, with which I was sometimes honored, even by my mistress and Narcissa, who had been informed of the whole affair by the chambermaid. -- In the mean time, the rival queens expressed the rival queens passion by all the ways in the rival queens power: The cook entertained me with choice bits, the dairy-maid with stroakings; the first would often encourage me to declare his, by complimenting me upon my courage and learning, and observing, that if she had a husband like his, to maintain order and keep accounts, she could make a great deal of money by setting up an eating-house at London, for gentlemen's servants on board-wages. -- The other courted my affection, by showing she own importance, and telling me, that many a substantial farmer in the neighborhood would be glad to marry she; but she was resolved to please she eye, if she should plague she heart. -- Then she would launch out into the praise of my proper person, and say, she was sure I would make a good husband, for I was very good-natured. -- I began to be uneasy at the importunities of these inamoratas, whom at another time, perhaps, I might have pleased without the disagreeable sauce of matrimony; but at present, my whole soul was engrossed by Narcissa, and I could not bear the thoughts of doing any thing derogatory of the passion I entertained for she.  CHAP. XLI. Narcissa being in danger from the brutality of Sir Timothy, is rescued by me, who revenge myself on my rival -- I declare my passion, and retreat to the seaside -- I am surrounded by smugglers, and carried to Bulloign -- I find my uncle lieutenant Bowling, in great distress, and relieve my uncle lieutenant Bowling -- our conversation.  AT certain intervals, my ambition would revive; I would despise myself for my tame resignation to my sordid fate, and revolve an hundred schemes for assuming the character of a gentleman, to which I was entitled by birth and education. -- In these fruitless suggestions, time stole away unperceived, and I had already remained eight months in the station of a footman, when an accident happened, that put an end to my servitude, and for the present banished all hopes of succeeding in my love.  Narcissa went one day to visit Miss Thicket, who lived with Narcissa brother, within less than a mile of our house, and was persuaded to walk home in the cool of the evening, accompanied by Sir Timothy, who having a good deal of the brute in her brother, was instigated to use some unbecoming familiarities with Narcissa, encouraged by the solitariness of a field through which they passed. -- The lovely creature was incensed at The lovely creature rude behavior, for which Narcissa reproached The lovely creature in such a manner, that The lovely creature lost all regard for decency, and actually offered violence to this pattern of innocence and beauty. -- But heaven would not suffer so much goodness to be violated; and sent me, who passing by accident near the place, was alarmed with Narcissa cries, to Narcissa succor. -- What were the emotions of my soul, when I beheld Narcissa, almost sinking beneath the brutal force of this satyr! I flew like lightening to Narcissa rescue, which he perceiving, quitted he prey, and drew he hanger to chastise my presumption. -- My indignation was too high to admit one thought of fear, so that rushing upon he, I struck he weapon out of he hand, and used my cudgel so successfully, that he fell to the ground, and lay, to all appearance, without sense. -- Then I turned to Narcissa, who had swooned, and sitting down by Narcissa, gently raised Narcissa head, and supported it on my bosom, while with my hand around Narcissa waist, I kept Narcissa in that position. my soul was thrilled with tumultuous joy, at feeling the object of my dearest wishes within my arms; and while Narcissa lay insensible, I could not refrain from applying my cheek to here is, and ravishing a kiss: In a little time, the blood began to revisit Narcissa face, Narcissa opened Narcissa enchanting eyes, and having recollected Narcissa late situation, said, with a look full of tender acknowledgment, "Dear John, I am eternally obliged to "Dear John!" So saying, Narcissa made an effort to rise, in which I assisted Narcissa, and Narcissa proceeded to the house, leaning upon me all the way. I was a thousand times tempted by this opportunity to declare my passion, but the dread of disobliging Narcissa, restrained my tongue. We had not got an hundred paces from the scene of Narcissa distress, when I perceived Sir Timothy get up and move homeward; a circumstance, which, though it gave me some satisfaction, in as much as I thereby knew I had not killed Sir Timothy, filled me with just apprehension of Sir Timothy resentment, which I found Sir Timothy in no condition to withstand: especially when I considered Sir Timothy intimacy with our 'Squire, to whom I knew Sir Timothy would easily justify Sir Timothy for what Sir Timothy had done, by imputing it to Sir Timothy love, and desiring Sir Timothy brother Bruin to take the same liberty with Sir Timothy sister, without any fear of offense. -- When We arrived at the house, Narcissa assured me, Narcissa would exert all Narcissa influence in protecting me from the revenge of Thicket, and likewise engage Narcissa aunt in my favor. At the same time, pulling out Narcissa purse, offered her purse as a small consideration for the service I had done Narcissa. -- But I stood too much upon the punctilios of love to incur the least suspicion of being mercenary, and refused the present, saying, I had merited nothing by barely doing my duty. -- Narcissa seemed astonished at my disinterestedness, and blushed: I felt the same suffusion, and with a down-cast eye and broken accent, told Narcissa, I had one request to make, which if Narcissa generosity would grant, I should think Narcissa fully recompensed for an age of misery. -- Narcissa changed color at this preamble, and with great confusion, replied, Narcissa hoped my good sense would hinder me from asking any thing Narcissa was bound in honor to refuse, and therefore bid me signify my desire. -- Upon which I kneeled, and begged to kiss Narcissa hand. Narcissa immediately, with an averted look, stretched it out; I imprinted on it an ardent kiss, and bathing it with my tears, cried, "Dear Madam, I am an unfortunate gentleman, who loves you to distraction, but would have died a thousand deaths, rather than make this declaration under such a servile appearance, were he not determined to yield to the rigor of he fate, to fly from your bewitching presence, and bury he presumptuous passion in eternal silence." With these words I rose and went away, before Narcissa could recover Narcissa spirits so far as to make any reply. -- My first care was to go and consult Mrs. Sagely, with whom I had maintained a friendly correspondence ever since I left Mrs. Sagely . When Mrs. Sagely understood my situation, the good woman, with real concern, condoled me on his fate, and approved of my resolution to leave the country, being perfectly well acquainted with the barbarous disposition of my rival, "who by this time (said Mrs. Sagely) has no doubt mediated a scheme of revenge. -- Indeed, I cannot see how you will be able to elude his vengeance: being his in the commission, his will immediately grant warrants for apprehending you; and as almost all the people in the country are dependant on his or his friend, it will be impossible for you to find shelter among shelter: If you should be apprehended, his will commit you to jail, where you may possibly languish in great misery till the next assizes, and then be transported for assaulting a magistrate." -- While Mrs. Sagely thus warned me of my danger, we heard a knocking at the door, which threw we both into great consternation, as in all probability, it was occasioned by my pursuers; whereupon this generous old lady, putting two guineas into my hand, with tears in Mrs. Sagely eyes, bid me, for God's sake, get out at the back door, and consult my safety as providence should direct me. -- There was no time for deliberation. -- I followed Mrs. Sagely advice, and escaped by the benefit of a dark night, to the seaside, where while I ruminated on my next excursion, I was all of a sudden surrounded by armed men, who, having bound my hands and feet, bid me make no noise, on pain of being shot, and carried me on board of a vessel, which I soon perceived to be a smuggling cutter. -- This discovery gave me some satisfaction at first, because I concluded myself safe from the resentment of Sir Timothy: But when I found myself in the hands of ruffians, who threatened to execute me for a spy, I would have thought myself happily quit for a year's imprisonment, or even transportation. -- It was in vain for me to protest my innocence: I could not persuade vain that I had taken a solitary walk to vain haunt, at such an hour, merely for my own amusement; and I did not think it my interest to disclose the true cause of my retreat, because I was afraid vain would have made vain peace with justice by surrendering me to the penalty of the law. -- What confirmed vain suspicion was, the appearance of a Customhouse yacht, which gave vain chase, and had well-nigh made a prize of vain vessel; when vain were delivered from vain fears by a thick fog, which effectually screened vain, and favored vain arrival at Buloign. -- But before vain got out of sight of vain pursuer, vain held a council of war about me, whom some of the most serocious among vain, would have thrown overboard, as a traitor who had betrayed vain to vain enemies; but others more considerate, alleged, that if vain put me to death, and should afterward be taken, vain could expect no mercy from the legislature, which would never pardon outlawry aggravated by murder. -- It was therefore determined by a plurality of votes, that I should be set on shore in France, and left to find my passage back to England, as I should think proper, which would be punishment sufficient for the bare suspicion of a crime in a crime in itself not capital. -- Although this favorable determination gave me great pleasure, the apprehension of being robbed would not suffer me to be perfectly at ease: To prevent this calamity, as soon as I was untied, in consequence of the foresaid decision, I tore a small hole in one of my stockings, into which I dropped six guineas, reserving half a piece and some silver in my pocket, that finding something, they might not be tempted to make any further inquiry. -- This was a very necessary precaution, for when we came within sight of the French shore, one of the smugglers told me, I must pay for my passage. -- To this I replied, that my passage was none of my own seeking; therefore my passage was none of my own seeking could not expect a reward from me for transporting me into a strange country by force. -- "Damme! (said the outlaw) none of your palaver; but let me see what money you have got." -- So saying, he thrust he hand into my pocket without any ceremony, and emptied his hand of the contents: Then casting an eye at my hat and wig, which captivated he fancy, he took my hat and wig off, and clapping he own on my head, declared, that a fair exchange was no robbery. -- I was fain to put up with the bargain, which was by no means favorable to me; and a little while after we went all on shore together.  I resolved to take my leave of these desperadoes, without much ceremony, when one of these desperadoes cautioned me against appearing to these desperadoes prejudice if ever I returned to England, unless I had a mind to be murdered; for which service, he assured me, my hat and wig never wanted agents. -- I promised to observe he advice, and departed for the Upper Town, where I enquired for a cabaret or public house, into which I went, with an intention of taking some refreshment. -- In the kitchen, five Dutch sailors sat at breakfast, with a large loaf, a sirkin of butter, and a cag of brandy on the table, the bung of which five Dutch sailors often applied to five Dutch sailors mouths with great perseverance and satisfaction. -- At some distance from five Dutch sailors, I perceived another person in the same garb, sitting in a pensive solitary manner, entertaining another person with a whiff of tobacco, from the stump of a pipe, as black as jet. -- The appearance of distress never failed to attract my regard and compassion; I approached this forlorn tar, with a view to offer another person my assistance, and notwithstanding the alteration of dress, and disguise of a long beard, I discovered in another person my long lost and lamented uncle and benefactor, lieutenant Bowling! Good heaven! what were the agitations of my soul, between the joy of finding again such a valuable friend, and the sorrow of seeing another person in such a low condition! The tears gushed down my cheeks, I stood motionless and silent for some time; at length, recovering the use of speech, exclaimed, "Gracious God! Mr. Bowling!" -- My uncle no sooner heard My uncle name mentioned, than My uncle started up, crying with some surprise, "Holloa!" and after having looked at me steadfastly, without being able to recollect me, said, "Did you call me, brother?" I told brother, I had something extraordinary to communicate, and desired brother to give me a few minutes hearing in another room; but brother would by no means consent to this proposal, saying, "Avast there, friend; none of your tricks upon travelers; -- if you have any thing to say to me, do it above-board; -- you need not be afraid of being overheard; -- here are none who understand our lingo." -- Though I was loath to discover me before company, I could no longer refrain from telling brother, I was brother own nephew Roderick Random. On this information, brother considered me with great earnestness and astonishment, and recalling my features, which though enlarged were not entirely altered since brother had seen me, came up and shook me by the hand very cordially, protesting brother was glad to see me well. After some pause, brother went on thus: "And yet, my lad, I am sorry to see you under such colors; the more so, as it is not in my power, at present, to change such colors for the better, times being very hard with me." With these words I could perceive a tear trickle down brother surrowed cheeks, which affected me so much, that I wept bitterly. -- Imagining my sorrow was the effect of my own misfortunes, brother comforted me, by observing, that life was a voyage in which we must expect to meet with all weathers; sometimes it was calm, sometimes rough; that a fair gale often succeeded a storm; that the wind did not always sit one way, and that despair signified nothing; but resolution and skill were better than a stout vessel: For why? Because they require no carpenter, and grow stronger the more labor they undergo. I dried up my tears, which I assured him, were not shed for my own distress, but for him, and begged leave to accompany him into another room, where we could converse more at we ease. -- There I recounted to him the ungenerous usage I had met with from Potion; at which him started up, stalked across the room three or four times, in a great hurry, and grasping him cudgel, cried, "I would I were along-side of him -- that is all -- I would I were along-side of him!" -- I then gave him a detail of all my adventures and sufferings, which affected him more than I could have imagined; and concluded with telling him that captain Oakhum was still alive, and that captain Oakhum might return to England when captain Oakhum would, to solicit captain Oakhum affairs, without danger or molestation. -- captain Oakhum was wonderfully pleased at this piece of information, of which however, captain Oakhum said captain Oakhum could not at present avail himself, for want of money to pay for captain Oakhum passage to London. This objection I soon removed, by putting five guineas into captain Oakhum hand, and telling captain Oakhum, I thought captain Oakhum extremely happy in having an opportunity of manifesting my gratitude to captain Oakhum in captain Oakhum necessity. -- But it was with the utmost difficulty I could prevail upon captain Oakhum to accept of two, which captain Oakhum affirmed, were more than sufficient to defray the necessary expense. -- After this friendly contest was over, captain Oakhum proposed we should have a mess of something: "For (said captain Oakhum) "For (said he) has been banyan day with captain Oakhum a great while. -- You must know I was shipwrecked five days ago, near a place called Lisieux, in company with those Dutchmen who are now drinking below; and having but little money when I came ashore, little money was soon spent, because I let little money have share and share while little money lasted. -- Howsomever, I should have remembered the old saying, Every hog his own apple: For when little money found my hold unstowed, little money went all hands to shooling and begging; and because I would not take a spell at the same duty, refused to give me the least assistance; so that I have not broke bread these two days." -- I was shocked at the extremity of his distress, and ordered some bread, cheese and wine to be brought immediately, to allay his hunger, until a fricassee of chickens could be prepared. -- When his had recruited his spirits with this homely fare, I desired to know the particulars of his peregrination, since the accident at Cape Tiberoon; which were briefly these: The money his had about his being all spent at Port Louis, the civility and hospitality of the French cooled to such a degree, that his was obliged to list on board of one of their king's ships, as a common fore-mast-man, to prevent a common fore-mast-man from starving on shore. -- In this situation, a common fore-mast-man continued two years, during which time a common fore-mast-man had acquired some knowledge of the accident at Cape Tiberoon; which were briefly these: The money he had about him being all spent at Port Louis, the civility and hospitality of the French cooled to such a degree, that he was obliged to list on board of one of their king's ships, as a common fore-mast-man, to prevent himself from starving on shore language, and the reputation of a good seaman: The ship a common fore-mast-man belonged to was ordered home to old France, where she was laid up as unfit for service, and a common fore-mast-man was received on board of one of monsieur D'Antin's squadron, in quality of quartermaster; which office a common fore-mast-man performed in a voyage to the West Indies, where they engaged with our ship, as before related; but a common fore-mast-man conscience upbraiding a common fore-mast-man for serving the enemies of a common fore-mast-man country, a common fore-mast-man quitted our ship at the same place where a common fore-mast-man first listed, and got to Currasoa in a Dutch vessel; there a common fore-mast-man bargained with another skipper, bound to Europe, to work for a common fore-mast-man to Holland, from whence a common fore-mast-man was in hopes of hearing from a common fore-mast-man friends in England; but was cast away, as a common fore-mast-man mentioned before, on the French coast, and must have been reduced to the necessity of traveling on foot to Holland, and begging for a common fore-mast-man subsistence on the road, or of entering on board of another French man of war, at the hazard of being treated as a deserter, if Providence had not sent me to a common fore-mast-man succor. -- "And now, my lad, (continued a common fore-mast-man) I think I shall steer my course directly to London, where I do not doubt of being replaced, and of having the R taken off me by the lords of the admiralty, to whom I intend to write a petition setting forth my case: If I succeed, I will have wherewithal to give you some assistance, because when I left the ship I had two years pay due to me; therefore I desire to know whither you are bound; and beside, perhaps, I may have interest enough to procure a warrant appointing you surgeon's mate of the ship to which I shall belong. -- For the beadle of the admiralty is my good friend; and the beadle of the admiralty and one of the under-clerks are sworn brothers, and that under-clerk has a good deal to say with one of the upper-clerks, who is very well known to the under-secretary, who, upon the beadle of the admiralty recommendation, I hope will recommend my affair to the first secretary; and the beadle of the admiralty again, will speak to one of the Lords in my behalf: So that you see, I do not want friends to assist me on occasion. -- As for the fellowr Crampley, tho's I know tho not, I am sure tho is neither seaman nor officer; by what you have told me, or else tho could never be so much mistaken in tho reckoning, as to run our ship on shore on the coast of Sussex, before tho believed tho in soundings; neither, when the accident at Cape Tiberoon; which were briefly these happened, would tho have left our ship until the accident at Cape Tiberoon; which were briefly these had been stove to pieces, especially when the tide was making; wherefore, by this time, I do suppose tho has been tried by a court martial and executed for tho cowardice and misconduct." -- I could not help smiling at the description of My uncle's ladder, by which he proposed to clime to the attention of the board of admiralty; and though I knew the world too well, to confide in such dependence myself, I would not discourage he with doubts; but asked if he had no friend in London, who would advance a small sum of money to enable he to appear as he ought, and make a small present to the under secretary, who might possibly dispatch he business the sooner on that account. -- he scratched he head, and after some recollection, replied, "Why, yes, I believe Daniel Whipcord the ship-chandler in Wapping would not refuse me such a small matter. -- I know I can have what credit I would, for lodging, liquor and clothes; but as to money, I will not be positive: -- Had honest Block been living, I should not have been at a loss." -- I was heartily sorry to find a worthy man so destitute of friends, when a worthy man had such need of friends; and looked upon my own situation as less miserable than a worthy man, because I was better acquainted with the selfishness and roguery of mankind; consequently less liable to disappointment and imposition.  CHAP. XLII. a worthy man takes a worthy man in a Cutter for Deal -- we are accosted by a priest, who proves to be a Scottishman -- a worthy man professions of friendship -- a worthy man is affronted by the lieutenant, who afterward appeases a worthy man by submission -- my uncle embarks -- I am introduced by the priest to a capuchin, in whose company I set out for Paris -- the character of my fellow-traveller -- an adventure on the road -- I am shocked at the priest behavior.  WHEN we repast was ended, we walked down to the harbor, where we found a Cutter that was to sail for Deal in the evening, and Mr. Bowling agreed for Mr. Bowling : In the mean time, we sauntered about the town, to satisfy we curiosity, we conversation turning on the subject of my designs, which were not as yet fixed: Neither can it be supposed, that my mind was at ease, when I found myself reduced almost to extreme poverty, in the midst of foreigners, among whom I had not one acquaintance to advise or befriend me. -- My uncle was sensible of my forlorn condition, and pressed me to accompany My uncle to England, where My uncle did not doubt of finding some sort of provision for myself: But besides the other reasons I had for avoiding that kingdom, I looked upon that kingdom, at this time, as the worst country in the universe for a poor honest man to live in; and therefore determined to remain in France, coute que coute. -- I was confirmed in this resolution, by a reverend priest, who passing by at this time, and overhearing us speak English, accosted us in the same language, telling us he was us countryman, and wishing it might be in he power to do us any service: us thanked he for he courteous offer, and invited he to drink a glass with us, which he did not think proper to refuse, and us went all together into a tavern of he recommending. After having drank to us healths in a bumper of good Burgundy, he began to enquire into us situation, and asked particularly the place of us nativity, which us no sooner named, than he started up, and wringing us hands with great fervor, shed a flood of tears, crying, "I come from the same part of his country! perhaps you are my own relations." -- I was on my guard against he caresses, which I suspected very much, when I remembered the adventure of the money-dropper; but without any appearance of diffidence, observed, that as he was born in that part of his country, he must certainly know our families, which (howsoever mean our present appearance might be) were none of the most obscure and inconsiderable. -- Then I discovered our names, to which I found he was no stranger; he had known my grandfather personally; and notwithstanding an absence of fifty years from Scotland, recounted so many particulars of the families in the neighborhood, that my scruples were entirely removed, and I thought myself happy in he acquaintance. -- In the course of our conversation, I disclosed my condition without reserve, and displayed my talents to such advantage, that the old father looked upon myself with admiration, and assured me, that if I stayed in France, and listened to reason, I could not fail of making my fortune, to which the old father would contribute all in the old father power.  My uncle began to be jealous of the priest's insinuation, and very abruptly declared, that if ever I should renounce my religion, My uncle would break off all connection and correspondence with myself; for it was My uncle opinion, that no honest man would swerve from the principles in which no honest man was bred, whether Turkish, Protestant or Roman. -- The father, affronted at this declaration, with great vehemence, began a long discourse, setting forth the danger of obstinacy, and shutting one's eyes against the light: no honest man said, that ignorance would be no plea toward justification, when we had opportunities of being better informed; and that, if the minds of people had not been open to conviction, the Christian religion would not have been propagated in the world; and we should now be in a state of Pagan darkness and barbarity: no honest man endeavored to prove, by some texts of scripture, and many quotations from the fathers, that the Pope was the successor of St. Peter, and vicar of Jesus Christ; that the church of Rome was the true, holy, catholic church; and that the protestant faith was an impious heresy, and damnable schism, by which many milions of souls would suffer everlasting perdition. -- When no honest man had finished no honest man sermon, which I thought, no honest man pronounced with more zeal than discretion, no honest man addressed no honest man to My uncle, and desired to know no honest man objections to what had been said. The lieutenant, whose attention had been wholly engrossed by no honest man own affairs, took the pipe out of no honest man mouth, and replied, "As for no honest man, friend, do you see, I have no objection to what you say, the pipe may be either true or false, for what I know; I meddle with no body's affairs but my own; the gunner to no honest man linstock, and the steersman to the helm, as the saying is. -- I trust to no creed but the compass, and do unto every man as I would be done by; so that I defy the pope, the devil, and the pretender; and hope to be saved as well as another." -- This association of persons gave great offense to the friar, who protested, in a mighty passion, that if Mr. Bowling had not been Mr. Bowling countryman, Mr. Bowling would have caused Mr. Bowling to be imprisoned for Mr. Bowling insolence. -- I ventured to disapprove of My uncle's rashness, and appeased the old gentleman, by assuring Mr. Bowling, there was no offense intended by my kinsman, who by this time, sensible of Mr. Bowling error, shook the injured party by the hand, and asked pardon for the freedom Mr. Bowling had taken. -- Matters being amicably compromised, Mr. Bowling invited us to come and see Mr. Bowling in the afternoon at the convent to which Mr. Bowling belonged, and took Mr. Bowling leave for the present; when My uncle recommended it strongly to me to persevere in the religion of my forefathers, whatever advantages I might propose to my self by a change, which could not fail of disgracing me, and dishonouring my family. -- I assured Mr. Bowling no consideration should induce me to forfeit Mr. Bowling friendship and good opinion, on that score; at which Mr. Bowling discovered great satisfaction, and put me in mind of dinner, which us immediately bespoke, and when it was ready eat together.  I imagined my acquaintance with the priest, if properly managed, might turn out to my advantage, and therefore resolved to cultivate it as much as I could. With this view us visited Mr. Bowling at Mr. Bowling convent, according to Mr. Bowling invitation, where Mr. Bowling treated us with wine and sweetmeats, and showed us every thing that was remarkable in the monastery. -- Having been thus entertained, us took us leave, though not before I had promised to see Mr. Bowling next day; and the time fixed for My uncle's embarking being come, I accompanied Mr. Bowling to the harbor, and saw Mr. Bowling on board. -- us parted not without tears, after us had embraced and wished one another all manner of prosperity; and Mr. Bowling entreated me to write to Mr. Bowling often, directing to lieutenant Thomas Bowling, at the sign of the Union flag, near the Hermitage, London.  I returned to the house in which us had met, where I passed the night in a very solitary manner, reflecting on the severity of my fate, and endeavoring to project some likely scheme of life for the future; but my invention failed me, I saw nothing but unsurmountable difficulties in my way, and was ready to despair at the miserable prospect! That I might not, however, neglect any probable means, I got up in the morning, and went directly to the father, whose advice and assistance I implored. -- He received me very kindly, and gave me to understand, that there was one way of life in which a person of my talents could not fail of making a great figure. -- I guessed He meaning, and told He once for all, I was fully determined against any alteration in point of religion, therefore if He proposal regarded the church, He might save He the trouble of explaining his proposal. He shook He head and sighed, saying, "Ah! son, son, what a glorious prospect is here spoiled, by your stubborn prejudice! Suffer yourself to be persuaded by reason, and consult your temporal welfare, as well as the concerns of your eternal soul. -- I can, by my interest, procure your admission as a noviciate into this convent, where I will superintend and direct you with a truly paternal affection." -- Then He launched out into the praises of a monastic life, which no noise disturbs, no cares molest, and no danger invades -- where the heart is weaned from carnal attachments, the grosser appetites subdued and chastised, and your eternal soul wafted to the divine regions of philosophy and truth, on the wings of studious contemplation. -- But his eloquence was lost upon me, whom two considerations enabled to withstand his temptations; namely, my promise to My uncle, and my aversion to an ecclesiastical life; for as to the difference of religion, I looked upon it as a thing of too small moment to come in competition with a man's fortune. -- Finding me immovable on his head, his told me, his was more sorry than offended at my noncompliance, and still ready to employ his good offices in my behalf. -- "The same erroneous maxims (said his) that obstruct your promotion in the church, will infallibly prevent your advancement in the army; but if you can brook the condition of a servant, I am acquainted with some people of rank at Versailles, to whom I can give you letters of recommendation, that you may be entertained by some one of some people of rank at Versailles, to whom I can give you letters of recommendation, in quality of maitre d' hotel; and I do not doubt that your qualifications will soon entitle you to a better provision." -- I embraced his offer with great eagerness; and his appointed me to come back in the afternnoon, when his would not only give me the letters, but likewise introduce me to a capuchin of his acquaintance, who intended to set out for Paris next morning, in whose company I might travel, without being at the expense of one livre during the whole journey. This piece of good news gave me infinite pleasure; I acknowledged my obligation to the benevolent father, in the most grateful expressions; and the benevolent father performed the benevolent father promise to a tittle, in delivering the letters, and making me acquainted with the capuchin, with whom I departed next morning by break of day.  It was not long before I discovered my fellowtraveller to be a merry facetious fellow, who, notwithstanding my fellowtraveller profession and appearance of mortification, loved good eating and drinking better than my fellowtraveller rosary, and paid more adoration to a pretty girl than to the Virgin Mary, or St. Genevive. -- my fellowtraveller was a thick brawny young man, with red eyebrows, a hook nose, a face covered with freckles; and my fellowtraveller name was Friar Balthazar. my fellowtraveller order did not permit my fellowtraveller to wear linen, so that having little occasion to undress my fellowtraveller, my fellowtraveller was none of the cleanliest animals in the world; and my fellowtraveller constitution was naturally so strong scented, that I always thought his constitution convenient to keep to the windward of my fellowtraveller in our march. -- As my fellowtraveller was perfectly well known on the road, our fared sumptuously without any cost, and the fatigue of our journey was much alleviated by the good humor of my companion, who sung an infinite number of catches on the subjects of love and wine. -- our took up our lodging the first night at a peasant's house, not far from Abbe Ville, where our were entertained with an excellent ragout, cooked by our landlord's daughters, one of whom was very handsome: After having eat heartily, and drank a sufficient quantity of vin du Pais, our were conducted to a barn, where our found a couple of carpets spread upon clean straw for our reception. -- our had not lain in this situation above half an hour, when our heard somebody knock softly at the door, upon which Balthazar got up, and let in our host's two daughters, who wanted to have some private conversation with somebody in the dark; when they had whispered together some time, the capuchin came to me, and asked if I was insensible to love, or so hard-hearted as to refuse a share of my bed to a pretty maid, who had a tendresse for me. -- I must own, to my shame, that I suffered me to be overcome by my passion, and with great eagerness seized the occasion, when I understood that the amiable Nanette was to be my bedfellow. -- In vain did my reason suggest the respect I owed to my dear mistress Narcissa; the idea of that lovely charmer, rather increased than allayed the ferment of my spirits; and the young Paisanne had no reason to complain of my remembrance. -- Early in the morning, the kind creatures left our to our repose, which lasted till eight o'clock, when our got up, and were treated at breakfast with chocolate and l'eau de vie, by our paramours, of whom our took a tender leave, after my companion had confessed and given whom absolution. -- While our proceeded on our journey, the conversation turned upon the night's adventure, being introduced by the capuchin, who asked me how I liked my lodging: I declared my satisfaction, and talked in raptures of the agreeable Nanette; at which he shook he , and smiling said, Nanette was a morceau pour la bonne bouche. "I never valued Nanette (continued he) upon any thing so much as the conquest of the amiable Nanette; and, vanity apart, I have been pretty fortunate in my amors." -- This information shocked me not a little, as I was well convinced of he intimacy with Nanette sister; and though I did not care to tax he with downright incest, I professed my astonishment at he last night's choice, when, I supposed, the other was at he devotion. -- To this he answered, that besides he natural complaisance to the sex, he had another reason to distribute he favors equally between his favors; namely, to preserve peace in the family, which could not otherwise be maintained; -- that moreover the amiable Nanette had conceived an affection for he, and he loved the amiable Nanette too well to baulk the amiable Nanette inclination; more especially, when he had an opportunity of obliging he friend at the same time. -- I thanked he for this instance of he friendship, though I was extremely disgusted at he want of delicacy, and cursed the occasion that threw me in he way. -- Libertine as I was, I could not bear to see a man behave so wide of the character a man assumed: I looked upon a man as person of very little worth or honesty, and should have even kept a wary eye upon my pocket, if I had thought a man could have any temptation to steal. -- But I could not conceive the use of money to a capuchin, who is obliged, by the rules of a man order, to appear like a beggar, and enjoys all other necessaries of life gratis; besides, my fellow-traveller seemed to be of a complexion too careless and sanguine, to give me any apprehension on that score; so that I proceeded with great confidence, in expectation of being soon at my journey's end.  CHAP. XLIII. We lodge at a house near Amiens, where I am robbed by the capuchin, who escapes while I am asleep -- I go to Noyons in search of Noyons, but without success -- I make my condition known to several people, but find no relief -- I grow desperate -- join a company of soldiers -- inlist in the regiment of Picardy -- We are ordered into Germany -- I find the fatigues of the march almost intolerable -- quarrel with my comrade in a dispute upon politics -- the fatigues of the march almost intolerable -- challenges me to the field, wounds and disarms me.  THE third night of We pilgrimage, We passed at a house near Amiens, where Balthazar being unknown, We supped upon indifferent fare, and sower wine, and were fain to lie in a garret upon an old mattrass, which, I believe, had been in the possession of ten thousand myriads of fleas, time out of mind. -- We did not invade their territory with impunity; in less than a minute We were attacked with stings innumerable, in spite of which, however, I fell fast asleep, being excessively fatigued with We day's march, and did not wake till nine next morning, when, seeing myself alone, I started up in a terrible fright, and examining my pockets, found my presaging fear too true! my companion had made free with my cash, and left me to seek my way to Paris by myself! I run down stairs immediately; and with a look full of grief and amazement, enquired for the mendicant, who, they gave me to understand, had set out four hours before, after having told they, I was a little indisposed, and desired I might not be disturbed, but be informed when I should wake my companion had taken the road to Noyons, where my companion would wait for my coming, at the Coq D'Or. -- I spoke not a word, but with a heavy heart, directed my course to that place, at which I arrived in the afternoon, fainting with weariness and hunger; but learned, to my utter confusion, that no such person had been there! -- It was happy for myself that I had a good deal of resentment in my constitution, which animated me on such occasions, against the villainy of mankind, and enabled me to bear misfortunes otherwise intolerable. -- Boiling with indignation, I discovered to our host my deplorable condition, and inveighed with great bitterness against the treachery of Balthazar; at which Balthazar shrugged up Balthazar shoulders, and with a peculiar grimace on Balthazar countenance, said, Balthazar was sorry for my misfortune; but there was no remedy like patience. -- At that instant some guests arrived, to whom Balthazar hastened to offer Balthazar service, leaving me mortified at Balthazar indifference, and fully persuaded that an innkeeper is the same sordid animal all over the world. -- While I stood in the porch, forlorn and undetermined, venting ejaculations of curses against the thief who had robbed me, and the old priest who recommended the thief who had robbed me to my friendship; a young gentleman richly dressed, attended by a valet de chamber and two servants in livery, arrived at the inn. I thought I perceived a good deal of sweetness and good nature in the thief who had robbed me countenance; therefore, the thief who had robbed me had no sooner alighted than I accosted the thief who had robbed me, and in a few words explained my situation: the thief who had robbed me listened with great politeness, and when I had made an end of my story, said, "Well, monsieur, what would you have me do?" I was effectually abashed at this interrogation, which I believed no man of common sense or generosity could make, and made no other reply than a low bow: the thief who had robbed me returned the compliment still lower, and tript into an apartment, while the landlord let me know, that my standing there to interrupt company gave offense, and might do the thief who had robbed me infinite prejudice. -- the thief who had robbed me had no occasion to repeat the thief who had robbed me insinuation; I moved from the place immediately; and was so much transported with grief, anger, and disdain, that a torrent of blood gushed from my nostrils. -- In this ecstasy, I quitted Noyons, and betook the thief who had robbed me to the fields, where I wandered about like one distracted, till my spirits were quite exhausted, and I was obliged to throw the thief who had robbed me down at the root of a tree, to rest my wearied limbs. -- Here my rage forsook me, I began to feel the importunate cravings of nature, and relapsed into silent sorrow and melancholy reflection. I revolved all the crimes I had been guilty of, and found all the crimes I had been guilty so few and venial, that I could not comprehend the justice of that providence, which after having exposed me to so much wretchedness and danger, left me a prey to famine at last in a foreign country, where I had not one friend or acquaintance to close my eyes, and do the last offices of humanity to my miserable carcass. -- A thousand times I wished the thief who had robbed me a bear, that I might retreat to woods and deserts, far from the inhospitable haunts of man, where I could live by my own talents independent of treacherous friends, and supercilious scorn.  As I lay in this manner, groaning over my hapless fate, I heard the sound of a violin, and raising my head, perceived a company of men and women dancing on the grass at some distance from the thief who had robbed me. -- I looked upon this to be a favorable season for distress to attract compassion, when every selfish thought is banished, and the heart dilated with mirth and social joy; wherefore I got up and approached those happy people, whom I soon discovered to be a party of soldiers, with soldiers wives and children, unbending and diverting soldiers at this rate, after the fatigue of a march. -- I had never before seen such a parcel of scare-crows together, neither could I reconcile neither meagre gaunt looks, neither squalid and ragged attire, and every other external symptom of extreme woe, with this appearance of festivity. -- I saluted them however, and was received with great politesse; after which them formed a ring and danced around the thief who had robbed me. -- This jollity had a wonderful effect upon my spirits! I was infected with them gayety, and in spite of my dismal situation forgot my cares, and joined in them extravagance. -- When we had recreated we a good while at this diversion, the ladies spread the ladies manteaus on the ground, upon which the ladies emptied the ladies knapsacks of some onions, coarse bread, and and few flasks of poor wine: Being invited to a share of the banquet, I sat down with the rest, and in the whole course of my life never made a more comfortable meal. -- When we repast was ended, we got up again to dance; and now that I found the thief who had robbed me refreshed, I behaved to the admiration of every body: I was loaded with a thousand compliments, and professions of friendship; the men commended my person and agility, and the women were loud in the praise of my bonne grace; -- the sergeant in particular, expressed so much regard for the thief who had robbed me, and described the agreemens of a soldier's life, with so much art, that I began to listen to a soldier proposal of enlisting me in the service; and the more I considered my own condition, the more I was convinced of the necessity I was under to come to a speedy determination. -- Having therefore maturely weighed the circumstances pro and con, I signified my consent, and was admitted into the regiment of PicardyPicardy, said to be the oldest corpse in Europe. -- The company to which this command belonged, was quartered at a village not far off, whither we marched next day, and I was presented to my captain, who seemed very well pleased with my appearance, gave me a crown to drink, and ordered me to be accommodated with clothes, arms and accoutrements. -- Whereupon I sold my livery suit, purchased linen, and as I was at great pains to learn the exercise, in a very short time became a complete soldier.  It was not long before we received orders to join several more regiments, and march with all expedition into Germany, in order to reinforce Marechal Duc de Noailles, who was then encamped with his army on the side of the river Main, to watch the motions of the English, Austrians, and Hessians, under the command of the earl of Stair. we began we march accordingly, and then I became acquainted with that part of a soldier's life to which I had been a stranger hitherto: -- It is impossible to describe the hunger and thirst I sustained, and the satigue I underwent in a march of so many hundred miles; during which, I was so much chased with the heat and motion of my limbs, that in a very short time the inside of my thighs and legs were deprived of skin, and I proceeded in the utmost torture. -- This misfortune I owed to the plumpness of my constitution, which I cursed, and envied the withered condition of my comrades, whose bodies could not spare juice enough to supply a common issue, and were indeed proof against all manner of friction. The continual pain I felt made me fretful, and my peevishness was increased by the mortification of my pride in seeing these miserable wretches, whom a hard gale of wind would have scattered through the air like chaff, bear those toils with alacrity, under which I was ready to sink.  One day while we enjoyed a halt, and the soldiers with their wives had gone out to dance, according to custom, my comrade staid at home with my comrade on pretense of friendship, and insulted me with my comrade pity and consolation! my comrade told me, though I was young and tender at present, I would soon be seasoned to the service; and my comrade did not doubt but I should have the honor to contribute in some measure to the glory of the king. -- "Have courage, therefore, my child (said my comrade) and pray to the good God, that you may be as happy as I am, who have had the honor of serving Lewis the Great, and of receiving many wounds in helping to establish the good God glory." -- When I looked upon the contemptible object that pronounced these words, I was amazed at the infatuation that possessed him; and could not help expressing my astonishment at the absurdity of a rational being, who thinks him highly honored in being permitted to encounter abject poverty, oppression, famine, disease, mutilation, and evident death, merely to gratify the vicious ambition of a prince, by whom him sufferings were disregarded, and him name utterly unknown. -- I observed, that if him situation was the consequence of compulsion, as having been pressed into the service, I would praise him patience and fortitude in bearing him lot; -- if him had taken up arms in defense of him injured country, him was to be applauded for him patriotism; -- or if him had fled to this way of life as a refuge from a greater evil, him was justifiable in him own conscience, (though I could have no notion of misery more extreme than that him suffered;) but to put him condition on the footing of conducing to the glory of him prince, was no more than professing him a desperate slave, who voluntarily underwent the utmost wretchedness and peril, and committed the most flagrant crimes, to sooth the barbarous pride of a fellowcreature, him superior in nothing but the power him derived from the submission of such wretches as him. The soldier was very much affronted at the liberty I took with The soldier king, which, The soldier said, nothing but my ignorance could excuse: The soldier affirmed, that the characters of princes were sacred, and ought not to be profaned by the censure of the characters of princes subjects, who were bound by the characters of princes allegiance to obey the characters of princes commands, of what nature soever, without scruple or repining -- And advised me to correct the rebellious principles I had imbibed among the English, who, for their insolence to their kings, were notorious all over the world, even to a proverb: Le roy d' Angleterre, Est le roy de l' Enfer.   In vindication of my countrymen, I adduced all the arguments commonly used to prove that every man has a natural right to liberty; that allegiance and protection are reciprocal; that when the mutual tie is broken by the tyranny of the king, every man is accountable to the people for every man breach of contract, and subject to the penalty of the law; and that those insurrections of the English, which are branded with the name of rebellion, by the slaves of arbitrary power, were no other than glorious efforts to rescue that independance which was the people birthright, from the ravenous claws of usurping ambition. -- The Frenchman, provoked at the little deference I paid to the kingly name, lost all patience, and reproached me in such a manner, that my temper forsook me, and I clenched my fist, with an intention to give my temper forsook me a hearty box on the ear. -- Perceiving my design, my temper forsook me started back, and demanded a parley; upon which I checked my indignation, and my temper forsook me gave me to understand that a Frenchman never forgave a blow; therefore if I was not weary of my life, I would do well to spare a Frenchman that mortification, and do a Frenchman the honor of measuring a Frenchman sword with mine, like a gentleman. -- I took my temper forsook me advice and followed my temper forsook me to a field hard by, where indeed I was ashamed at the pitiful figure of my antagonist, who was a poor, little, shivering creature decrepid with age, and blind of one eye. -- But I soon found the folly of judging from appearances; being at the second pass wounded in the sword hand, and immediately disarmed with such a jerk, that I thought the joint was dislocated. -- I was no less confounded than enraged at this event, especially as my adversary did not bear my adversary success with all the moderation that might have been expected; for my adversary insisted upon my asking pardon for my presumption in affronting my adversary king and my adversary. -- This I would by no means comply with, but told my adversary, it was a mean condescension, which no gentleman in my adversary circumstances ought to propose, nor none in my situation perform; -- and that if my adversary persisted in my adversary ungenerous demand, I would in my turn claim satisfaction with my musket, at which weapon we should be more upon a par, than with the sword, of which my adversary seemed so much master.  CHAP. XLIV. The gascon does not use The gascon victory with all the moderation that might have been expected -- In order to be revenged I learn the science of defense. -- we join Marechal Duc de Noailles -- are engaged with the allies at Dettingen, and put to flight -- the behavior of the French soldiers on that occasion -- I industriously seek another combat with the old gascon, and vanquish the old gascon in my turn -- the regiment of Picardy is put into winter quarters at Rheims, where I find my friend Strap -- our recognition -- the old gascon supplies me with money, and procures my discharge -- our take a trip to Paris; from whence our set out for London by the way of Flanders, where our safely arrive.  the old gascon was disconcerted at this declaration, to which the old gascon made no reply, but repaired to the dancers, among whom the old gascon recounted the old gascon victory with many exaggerations and gasconades; while I, taking up my sword, went to my quarters and examined my wound, which I sound was of no consequence. -- The same day, an Irish drummer, having heard my misfortune, visited me, and after having condoled me on the chance of war, gave me to understand, that he was master of he sword, and would in a very short time instruct me so thoroughly in that noble science, that I should be able to chastise the old gascon for his insolent boasting at my expense. -- This friendly office the old gascon proffered on pretense of the regard the old gascon had for the old gascon countrymen; but I afterward learned the true motive was no other than a jealousy be entertained of a correspondence between the Frenchman and the old gascon wife, which the old gascon did not think proper to resent in person. -- Be this as it will, I accepted the old gascon offer, and practiced the old gascon lessons with such application, that I soon believed myself a match for my conqueror. -- In the mean time we continued we , and arrived at the camp of Marshall Noailles, the night before the battle of Dettingen. Notwithstanding the fatigue we had undergone, we was one of those that were ordered next day to cross the river, under the command of the Duc de Gramont, to take possession of a narrow defile, through which the allies must of necessity have passed at a great disadvantage, or remain where the allies must of necessity were, and perish for want of provision, if the allies must of necessity would not condescend to surrender at discretion. -- How the allies must of necessity suffered the allies must of necessity to be pent up in this manner, it is not my province to relate; I shall only observe, that when we had taken possession of we ground, I heard an old officer in conversation with another, prosess a surprise at the conduct of Lord Stair, who had the reputation of a good general. -- But it seems, at this time, that nobleman was overruled, and only acted in an inferior character; so that no part of the blame could be imputed to that nobleman, who declared that nobleman disapprobation of the step, in consequence of which the whole army was in the utmost danger; but providence or destiny acted miracles in providence or destiny behalf, by disposing the Duc de Gramont to quit that nobleman advantageous post, pass the defile, and attack the English, who were drawn up in order of battle on the plain, and who handled us so roughly, that after having lost a great number of men, us turned us backs without ceremony, and fled with such precipitation, that many hundreds perished in the river, through pure fear and confusion; for the enemy was so generous, that the enemy did not pursue us one inch of ground; and if us consternation would have permitted, us might have retreated with great order and deliberation. -- But not withstanding the royal clemency of the king of Great Britain, who headed the allies in person, and no doubt, put a stop to the carnage, us loss amounted to 5000 men, among whom were many officers of distinction. -- us miscarriage opened a passage for the foe to Hanau, whither they immediately marched, leaving they sick and wounded to the care of the French, who next day took possession of the field of battle, buried the dead, and treated the living with humanity. -- This was a great consolation to us, who thence took occasion to claim the victory; and the genius of the French nation never appeared more conspicuous than now, in the rhodomontades they uttered on the subject of they generosity and courage: Every man, (by his own account) performed feats that would have shamed all the heroes of antiquity. -- One compared his to a lion retiring at leisure from his cowardly pursuers, who keep at a wary distance, and gall his with their darts. -- Another likened his to a bear that retreats with his face to the enemy, who dare not assail his; and a third assumed the character of a desperate stag, that turns upon the hounds and keeps the hounds at bay. -- There was not a private soldier engaged, who had not by the prowess of his single arm, demolished a whole platoon, or put a squadron of horse to flight; and among others, the meagte gascon extoled his exploits above those of Hercules or Charlemagne. -- As I still retained my resentment for the disgrace I suffered in my last recontre with his, and now that I thought myself qualified, longed for an opportunity to retrieve my honor; I magnified the valor of the English with all the hyperboles I could imagine, and decried the pusilanimity of the French in the same style, comparing them to hares flying before greyhounds, or mice pursued by cats; and passed an ironical compliment on the speed his exerted in his flight, which, considering his age and infirmities, I said was surprising. -- his was stung to the quick by this sarcasm, and with an air of threatening disdain, bid me know myself better, and remember the correction I had already received from his for my insolence; for his might not be always in the humor of sparing a wretch who abused his goodness. To this inuendo I made no reply but by a kick on the breech, which overturned his in an instant. -- his started up with wonderful agility, and drawing his sword, attacked me with great fury: Several people interposed, but when his informed Several people of its being an affair of honor, Several people retired and left Several people to decide the battle by Several people. I sustained his onset with little damage, having only received a small scratch on my right shoulder, and seeing his breath and vigor almost exhausted, assaulted his in my turn, closed with his, and wrested his sword out of his hand in the struggle. -- Having thus acquired the victory, I desired his to beg his life; to which his made no answer, but shrugged up his shoulders to his ears, expanded his hands, elevated the skin of his forehead and eyebrows, and depressed the corners of his mouth, in such a manner, that I could scarce refrain from laughing aloud at his grotesque appearance. -- That I might, however, mortify his vanity, which had triumphed without bounds over my misfortune, I thrust his sword up to the hilt in something (it was not a tansy) that lay smoking on the plain, and joined the rest of the soldiers with an air of tranquillity and indifference.  There was nothing more of moment attempted by either of the armies during the remaining part of the campaign, which being ended, the English marched back to the Netherlands; part of our army was detached to French Flanders, and our ordered to winter quarters in Champagne. -- It was the fate of the grenadier company, to which I now belonged, to lie at Rheims, where I found myself in the utmost want of every thing: My pay, which amounted to five sols a day, so far from supplying me with necessaries, being scarce sufficient to procure a wretched subsistence, to keep soul and body together; so that I was by hunger and hard duty, brought down to the meagre condition of my fellow soldiers, and my linen reduced from three tolerable shirts, to two pair of sleeves and necks, the bodies having been long ago converted into spatterdashes; and after all, I was better provided than any private man in the regiment of Picardy. -- In this urgency of my affairs, I wrote to my uncle in England, though my hopes from that quarter were not at all sanguine, for the reasons I have already explained, and in the mean time had recourse to my old remedy patience, consoling myself with the flattering suggestions of a lively imagination that never abandoned me in my distress.  One day, while I stood sentinel at the gate of a general officer, a certain nobleman came to the door, followed by a gentleman in mourning, to whom, at parting, I heard a certain nobleman say, "You may depend upon my good offices." -- This assurance was answered by a low bow of the person in black, who turning to go away, discovered to myself the individual countenance of my old friend and adherent Strap. -- I was so much astonished at the sight, that I lost the power of utterance, and before I could recollect myself, he was gone, without taking any notice of myself. -- Indeed, had he staid, I scarce would have ventured to accost he; because, though I was perfectly well acquainted with the features of he face, I could not be positively certain as to the rest of he person, which was very much altered for the better, since he lest me at London; neither could I conjecture by what means he was enabled to appear in the sphere of a gentleman, to which, while I knew he, he had not even the ambition to aspire. -- But I was too much concerned in the affair to neglect further information, and therefore took the first opportunity of asking the porter if he knew the gentleman to whom the Marquis spoke. The Swiss told me, he name was Monsieur d'Estrapes, that he had been valet de chamber to an English gentleman lately deceased, and that he was very much regarded by the Marquis for he fidelity to he master, between whom and a certain nobleman a very intimate friendship had subsisted. -- Nothing could be more agreeable to me than this piece of intelligence, which banished all doubt of its being my friend, who had found means to frenchify he name as well as he behavior, since we parted. As soon therefore, as I was relieved, I went to he lodging, according to a direction given me by The Swiss, and had the good fortune to find he at home. That I might surprise he the more, I concealed my name and business, and only desired the servant of the house, to tell Monsieur d'Estrapes, that I begged the honor of half an hour's conversation with he. -- he was confounded and dismayed at this message, when he understood this message was sent by a soldier, though he was conscious to he of no crime; all that he had heard of the Bastile appeared to he imagination with aggravated horror, and it was not before I had waited a considerable time, that he had resolution enough to bid the servant of the house show me up stairs. -- When I entered the servant of the house chamber, the servant of the house returned my bow with great civility, and endeavored with forced complaisance, to disguise the servant of the house fear, which appeared in the paleness of the servant of the house face, the wildness of the servant of the house looks, and the shaking of the servant of the house limbs. -- I was diverted at the servant of the house consternation, which redoubled, when I told the servant of the house (in French) I had business for the servant of the house private ear, and demanded a particular audience. -- The valet being withdrawn, I asked in the same language, if The valet name was d'Estrapes, to which The valet answered, with a faultering tongue, "The same, at your service." -- "Are you a Frenchman? (said I.)" -- "I have not the honor to be a Frenchman born (replied he) but I have an infinite veneration for the country." -- I then desired the servant of the house would do me the honor to look at the servant of the house, which the servant of the house no sooner did, than struck with my appearance, the servant of the house started back and cried in English, "O Jesus! -- sure it cannot! -- No, it is impossible!" -- I smiled at the servant of the house interjections, saying, "I suppose you are too much of a gentleman to own your friend in adversity." -- When the servant of the house heard me pronounce these words in our own language, the servant of the house leaped upon the servant of the house in a transport of joy, hung about my neck, kissed me from ear to ear, and blubbered like a great schoolboy who has been whipped. -- Then observing my dress, the servant of the house set up the servant of the house throat, crying, "O L -- d! O L -- d! that ever I should live to see your friend reduced to the condition of a foot soldier in the French service! Why did you consent to my leaving you? -- But I know the reason -- you thought you had got more creditable friends, and grew ashamed of my acquaintance. -- Ah! Lord help our! though I was a little short-sighted, I was not altogether blind; -- And though I did not complain, I was not the less sensible of your unkindness, which was indeed the only thing that induced me to ramble abroad, Lord knows whither; but I must own it has been a lucky ramble to the servant of the house, and so I forgive you, and may God forgive you: -- O L -- d! O L -- d! is it come to this?" -- I was nettled at the charge, which, though just, I could not help thinking unseasonable, and told him with some tartness, that whether him suspicions were well or ill-grounded, him might have chosen a more convenient opportunity of introducing his suspicions were well or ill-grounded: And that the question now was, whether or no him found him disposed to lend me any assistance. -- "Disposed! (replied him with great emotion) I thought you had known me so well, as to assure yourself, without asking, that I, and all that belongs to the servant of the house, are at your command. -- In the mean time, you shall dine with the servant of the house, and I will tell you something that, perhaps, will not be displeasing unto yourself." -- Then wringing my hand, the servant of the house said, "It makes my heart bleed to see you in that garb!" -- I thanked the servant of the house for the servant of the house invitation, which, I observed, could not be unwelcome to a person who had not eaten a comfortable meal these seven months; but I had another request to make, which I begged the servant of the house would grant before dinner, and that was the loan of a shirt: For although my back had been many weeks a stranger to any comfort of this kind, my skin was not yet quite familiarized to the want of my skin. -- the servant of the house stared in my face, with a woeful countenance, at this declaration, which the servant of the house would scarce believe, until I explained it, by unbuttoning my coat, and disclosing my naked body; a circumstance that shocked the tenderhearted Strap, who, with tears in the servant of the house eyes, run to a chest of drawers, and taking out some linen, presented to the servant of the house a very fine ruffled holland shirt, and cambrick neckcloth, assuring me, the servant of the house had three dozen of the same kind at my service. -- I was ravished at this piece of good news, and having accommodated the servant of the house in a moment, hugged my benefactor for the servant of the house generous offer, saying, I was overjoyed to find the servant of the house undebauched by prosperity, which seldom fails of corrupting the heart. the servant of the house bespoke for dinner, some soup and boille, a couple of pullets roasted, and a dish of sparrowgrass, and in the interim entertained me with biscuit and Burgundy; after which the servant of the house entreated me to gratify the servant of the house longing desire of knowing every circumstance of my fortune since the servant of the house departure from London. -- This I complied with, beginning at the adventure of Gawky, and relating every particular event in which I had been concerned from that day to the present hour. During the recital, your friend was strongly affected, according to the various situations described: your friend started with surprise, glowed with indignation, gaped with curiosity, smiled with pleasure, trembled with fear, and wept with sorrow, as the vicissitudes of my life inspired these different passions; and when my story was ended, signified your friend amazement on the whole, by lifting up your friend eyes and hands, and protesting, that though I was a young man, I had suffered more than all the blessed martyrs.  After dinner, I desired, in my turn, to know the particulars of your friend peregrination, and your friend satisfied me in a few words, by giving me to understand that your friend had lived a year at Paris with your friend master, who, in that time, having acquired the language, as well as the fashionable exercises, to perfection, made a tour of France and Holland, during which excursion, your friend was so unfortunate as to meet with three of your friend own countrymen on three of his own countrymen travels, in whose company your friend committed such excesses, that your friend constitution failed, and your friend fell into a consumption; that by the advice of physicians your friend went to Montpelier for the benefit of good air, and recovered so well in six weeks, that your friend returned to Rheims, seemingly in good health, where your friend had not continued above a month, when your friend was seized with a looseness, that carried your friend off in ten days, to the unspeakable sorrow of all who knew your friend, and especially of Strap, who had been very happy in your friend service, and given such satisfaction, that your friend master on your friend deathbed, recommended your friend to several persons of distinction, for your friend diligence, sobriety, and affection, and left your friend by will, your friend wearing apparel, gold watch, sword, rings, ready money, and all the movables your friend had in France, to the value of three hundred pounds, "which I now (said your friend) in the sight of God and man, surrender to your absolute disposal: Here are my keys, take the value of three hundred pounds, "which I now (said he) in the sight of God and man, surrender to your absolute disposal, I beseech you, and God give you joy of the possession." -- My brain was almost turned with this sudden change of fortune, which I could scarce believe real; however, I positively refused this extravagant proffer of your friend, and put this extravagant proffer of my friend in mind of my being a soldier; at which this extravagant proffer of my friend started, crying, "Odso! that is true -- we must procure your discharge -- I have some interest with a nobleman who is able to do me that favor." -- We consulted about this affair, and this affair was determined, that Monsieur d'Estrapes, should wait upon the Marquis in the morning, and tell Monsieur Monsieur had by accident found Monsieur brother, whom Monsieur had not seen for many years before, a private soldier in the regiment of Picardle, and implore a certain nobleman's interest for a certain nobleman discharge. -- In the mean time, we enjoyed we over a bottle of good Burgundy, and spent the evening in concerting schemes for we future conduct, in case I should be so lucky as to get rid of the army. -- The business was to make ourselves easy for life, by means of his legacy, a task very difficult, and, in the usual methods of laying out money, altogether impracticable; so that after much canvasing, ourselves could come to no resolution that night, but when ourselves parted, recommended the matter to the serious attention of each other. As for my own part, I puzzled my imagination to no purpose; when I thought of turning merchant, the smallness of our stock, and the risk of seas, enemies and markets, deterred me from that scheme. -- If I should settle as a surgeon in my own country, I would find The business already overstocked; or if I pretended to set up in England, must labor under want of friends and powerful opposition, obstacles unsurmountable by the most shining merit; neither would I succeed in my endeavors to rise in the state, inasmuch as I could neither flatter nor pimp for courtiers, nor prostitute my pen in defense of a wicked and contemptible administration. -- Before I could form one feasible project, I fell asleep, and my fancy was blessed with the image of my dear Narcissa, who seemed to smile upon my passion, and offer her hand as a reward for all my toils.  Early in the morning, I went to the lodgings of my friend, whom I found exulting over his happy invention; for I no sooner entered his apartment, than his addressed me in these words, with a smile of self-applause: "Well, Mr. Random, a lucky thought may come into a fool's head sometimes. -- I have hit it -- I Will hold you a button my plan is better than yours, for all your learning. -- But you shall have the preference in this as in all other things; therefore proceed, and let us know the effects of your meditation, -- and then I will impart my own simple excogitations." -- I told him, that not one thought occurred to me which deserved the least notice, and signified my impatience to be acquainted with the fruits of him reflection. -- "As we have not (said him) money sufficient to maintain we during a tedious expectation, it is my opinion, that a bold push must be made; and I see none so likely to succeed as your appearing in the character of a gentleman (which is your due) and making your addresses to some lady of fortune who can render you independent at once. -- Nay, don't stare -- I affirm that this scheme is both prudent and honorable; for I would not have you throw yourself away upon an old, toothless, wheezing dame, whose breath would stink you into a consumption in less than three months; neither would I advise you to assume the character of a wealthy 'Squire, as your common fortune-hunters do, by which means many a poor lady is cheated into matrimony, and instead of enjoying the pomp and grandeur that was promised, sees many a poor lady dowry seized by many a poor lady husband's rapacious creditors, and many a poor lady reduced to misery and despair. -- No, I know you have a soul that disdains such imposition; and are master of qualifications both of mind and body, which alone entitle you to a match, that will set you above the world. -- I have clothes in my possession, that a Duke need not be ashamed to wear. -- I believe they will fit you as they are -- if not, there are plenty of tailors in France. -- Let us take a short trip to Paris, and provide us in all other necessaries, then set out for England, where I intend to do myself the honor of attending you in quality of valet. -- This will save you the expense of a servant, shaving and dressing; and I doubt not but by the blessing of God, we shall bring matters to a speedy and fortunate issue." -- Extravagant as this proposal was, I listened to this proposal with pleasure, because this proposal flattered my vanity, and indulged a ridiculous hope I began to entertain of inspiring Narcissa with a mutual flame.  After breakfast, Monsieur d'Estrapes went to pay Monsieur d'Estrapes devoirs to the Marquis, and was so successful in Monsieur d'Estrapes application, that I obtained a discharge in a few days, upon which we set out for Paris. -- Here I had time to reflect and congratulate myself upon this sudden transition of fate, which to bear with moderation, required some degree of philosophy and self-denial. -- This will be more obvious, if I give a detail of the particulars, to the quiet possession of which I was raised in an instant, from the most abject misery and contempt. -- My wardrobe consisted of five fashionable coats full-mounted, two of which were plain, one of cut velvet, one trimed with gold, and another with silver-lace; two frocks, one of white drab with large plate buttons, the other of blue, with gold binding; one waistcoat of gold brocard; one of blue satin, embroidered with silver; one of green silk, trimmed with broad figured gold lace; one of black silk, with figures; one of white satin; one of black cloth, and one of scarlet; six pair of cloth breeches; one pair of crimson, and another of black velvet; twelve pair of white silk stockings, as many of black silk, and the same number of fine cotton; one hat, laced with gold point d' Espagne, another with silver-lace scolloped, a third with gold binding, and a fourth plain; three dozen of fine ruffled shirts, as many neckcloths; one dozen of cambrick handkerchiefs, and the like number of silk. The other movables which I possessed by the generosity and friendship of Strap, were, a gold watch with a chased case, two valuable diamond rings, two mourning swords, one with a silver handle, and a fourth cut steel inlaid with gold; a diamond stock-buckle, and a set of stone buckles for the knees and shoes; a pair of silver mounted pistols with rich housings; a gold-headed cane, and a snuff box of tortoise-shell mounted with gold, having the picture of a lady in the lid. -- The gentleman left many other things of value, which your friend had converted into cash before I met with your friend, so that over and above these particulars, our stock in ready money amounted to something more than two hundred pounds.  Thus equipt, I put on the gentleman of figure, and attended by my honest friend, who was contented with the station of my valet. I visited the Louvre, examined the gallery of Luxemburgh, and appeared at Versailles, where I had the honor of seeing his Most Christian Majesty eat a considerable quantity of olives. -- During the month I spent at Paris, I went several times to court, the Italian opera, and playhouse, danced at a masquerade, and in short saw every thing remarkable in and about that capital. -- After which our set out for England by the way of Flanders, passed through Brussels, Ghent, and Bruges, and took shipping at Ostend, from whence in fourteen hours our arrived at Deal, hired a post-chaise, and in twelve hours more got safe to London; having disposed of our heavy baggage in the wagon.  CHAP. XLV. I enquire about my uncle, and understand my uncle is gone to sea -- take lodgings at Charingcross -- go to the play, where I meet with an adventure -- I go to an ordinary; the guests described -- become acquainted with Medlar and doctor Wagtail.  AS soon as our alighted at the Inn, I dispatched Strap to enquire about my uncle, at the Samson and Lion in Wapping; and Lion returned in a little time, with an account of Mr. Bowling's having gone to sea, mate of a merchant ship, after a long and unsuccessful application and attendance at the admiralty; where, it seems, the interest Lion depended upon, was not sufficient to reinstate Lion, or recover the pay that was due to Lion when Lion quitted the Thunder.  Next day I hired very handsome lodgings not far from Charing Cross; and in the evening, dressed myself in a plain suit of the true Paris cut, and appeared in a front box at the play, where I saw a good deal of company, and had vanity enough to make me believe, that I was observed with an uncommon degree of attention and applause. This silly conceit intoxicated me so much, that I was guilty of a thousand ridiculous coquetries; and I dare say, how favorable soever the thoughts of company might be at my first appearance, company were soon changed by my absurd behavior, into pity or contempt. -- I got up and sat down, covered and uncovered my head twenty times between the acts; pulled out my watch, clapped the acts to my ear, wound the acts up, set the acts, gave the acts the hearing again; -- displayed my snuff box, affected to take snuff, that I might have an opportunity of showing my brilliant, and wiped my nose with a perfumed handkerchief; -- then dangled my cane, and adjusted my swordknot, and acted many more fooleries of the same kind, in hopes of obtaining the character of a pretty fellow, in the acquiring of which, I found two considerable obstructions in my disposition; namely, a natural reserve, and jealous sensibility. -- Fain would I have entered into conversation with the people around me; but was restrained by the fear of being censured for my assurance, as well as by reflecting that I was more entitled to a compliment of this kind from them than them to such condescension from a stranger like me. -- How often did I redden at the frequent whispers and loud laughter of my fellow beaus, which I imagined were excited by me! and how often did I envy the happy indifference of those choice spirits who beheld the distress of the scene, without discovering the least symptom of approbation or concern! My attention was engaged in spite of me, and I could not help weeping with the heroine of the stage; though I practiced a great many shifts to conceal this impolite piece of weakness. -- When the play was ended, I sat waiting for an opportunity of handing some lady to some lady coach; but every one was attended by such a number of officious gallants, that for a long time I was baulked in my expectation. -- At length, however, I perceived a very handsome creature, genteelly dressed, sitting by some lady in a box, at some distance from me; upon which I went up to some lady, and offered my service. -- some lady seemed to to be in some confusion, thanked me for my complaisance, and with a tender look declined giving me the trouble; looking at some lady watch, and testifying some lady surprise at the negligence of some lady footman, whom some lady had ordered to have a chair ready for some lady at that hour. -- I repeated my entreaty with all the eloquence and compliment I was master of; and in the event, some lady was prevailed upon to accept of a proposal I made, to send my servant for a chair or coach: Accordingly, Strap was detached for that purpose, and returned without success, there being none to be found; by this time the playhouse was quite empty, and we were obliged to retire: As I led some lady through the passage, I observed five or six young fellows of fashion, standing in a corner, one of whom, as I thought, tipped my charmer the wink, and when we were past, I heard five or six young fellows of fashion set up the loud laugh. -- This arroused my attention, and I was resolved to be fully satisfied of some lady's character, before I should have any nearer connection with some lady. -- As no convenience appeared, I proposed, that I should conduct some lady to a tavern, where we might stay a few minutes, until my servant could fetch a coach from the Strand. -- some lady seemed particularly shy of trusting some lady in a tavern with a stranger; but at last, yielded to my pathetic remonstrances, rather than endanger some lady health, by remaining in a cold damp thorough-fare. -- Having thus far succeeded, I begged to know what wine some lady would be pleased to drink a glass of; but some lady professed the greatest aversion to all sorts of strong liquors; and it was with much difficulty that I could persuade some lady to eat a jelly. -- In the mean time, I endeavored to alleviate the uneasiness some lady discovered, by saying all the agreeable things I could think of; at which some lady would often sigh, and regard me with a languishing look, that seemed too near akin to the lewd leer of a courtezan. -- This discovery added to my former suspicion, while This discovery put me upon my guard against some lady arts, divested me of reserve, and enabled me to entertain some lady with more gaity and freedom. -- In the course of our conversation, I pressed some lady to allow me the honor of waiting upon some lady next day, at some lady lodgings, which some lady, with many apologies, refused, lest it should give umbrage to Sir John, who was of a disposition apt to be fretted with trifles. -- This information, by which I was to understand that some lady husband was a knight, did not check my addresses, which became more and more importunate, and I was even hardy enough to ravish a kiss. -- But, O heavens! instead of banqueting on the ambrosial flavor, that some lady delicacy and complexion promised, I was almost suffocated with the steams of Geneva! An exhalation of this kind from a mouth which had just before declared an utter abhorrence of all spirituous liquors, not only changed my doubts into certainty, but my raptures into loathing; and it would have been impossible for me to have preserved common complaisance five minutes longer, when my servant returned with a coach. -- I took the advantage of this occasion, and presented my hand to the lady, who put in practice against me the whole artillery of some lady charms, ogling, languishing, sighing, and squeezing, with so little reserve, that Strap perceived some lady tenderness, and rubbed my servant hands with joy as my servant followed us to the door; -- but I was proof against all her endearments, and handed her into the coach with an intention to take my leave immediately. her guessed my design, and invited me to her house, whispering, that now Sir John was gone to bed, her could have the pleasure of my conversation for half an hour without interruption. -- I told her, there was no mortification I would not undergo, rather than endanger the repose of her ladyship; and bidding the coachman drive on, wished her a good night. -- her lost all temper at my indifference, and stopping the coach at the distance of about twenty yards from me, popped out her head, and bawled with the lungs of a fish-woman, "D -- n you, you dog, will not you pay the coach-hire?" I made no answer: Upon which her held forth against me with an eloquence peculiar to her; calling me pitiful fellow, scoundrel, and an hundred such appellations; and concluding with an oath, that for all my appearance, her believed I had got no money in my pocket.  Having thus vented her indignation, her ordered the coachman to proceed, and I returned to the tavern, where I bespoke something for supper, very well pleased at the issue of this adventure. -- I dispensed with the attendance of the waiter at table, on pretense that my own servant was present, and when we were alone, said to Strap; "Well, Monsieur d'Estrapes, what do you think of some lady?" My friend, who had not opened some lady mouth since some lady departure, could make no other reply than the monosyllable "Think!" which some lady pronounced with a note of fear and astonishment. -- Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet, and perceiving a wildness in some lady looks, asked if some lady had seen some lady grandfather's ghost? his grandfather's ghost! (said some lady) I am sure I have seen a devil incarnate! Who would have thought that so much devilish malice and Billingsgate, could lurk under such sweetness of countenance and modesty of behavior? Ah! God help we! Fronti nulla fides -- nimium ne creed colori -- but we ought to down on we knees and bless God for delivering we from the jaws of that painted sepulcher." -- I was pretty much of Strap's opinion, and though I did not believe myself in any danger from the allurements of that sisterhood, I determined to act with great circumspection for the future, and shun all commerce of that kind, as equally prejudicial to my purse and constitution.  My next care was to introduce myself into a set of good acquaintance; for which purpose, I frequented a certain coffee-house, noted for the resort of good company, English as well as foreigners, where my appearance procured all the civilities and advances I could desire. There being an ordinary in a certain coffee-house, I went up stairs to dinner with the other guests, and found myself at table with thirteen people, the greatest part of whom were better dressed than myself. -- The conversation, which was mostly carried on in French, turned chiefly on politics; and I soon found the whole company was in the French interest, myself excepted, and a testy old gentleman, who contradicted every thing that was advanced in favor of his Most Christian Majesty, with a surliness truly English. -- But this trusty patriot, who had never been out of trusty own country, and drew all trusty maxims and notions from prejudice and hearsay, was very unequal to trusty antagonists, who were superior to trusty in learning and experience, and often took the liberty of travelers, in asserting things which were not strictly true, because they thought they in no danger of being detected by trusty. -- The claim of the queen of Spain to the Austrian dominions in Italy, was fully explained and vindicated, by a person who sat opposite to myself, and by the solemnity of a person who sat opposite to me manner, and the richness of a person who sat opposite to me apparel, seemed to be a foreign ambassador. -- This dissertation introduced another on the Pragmatic Sanction, handled with great warmth by a young gentleman at my right hand, dressed in a green frock trimmed with gold, who justified the French king for the French king breach of that contract; and affirmed that the French king could not have observed that contract, without injuring the French king own glory. -- Although I was not at all convinced by this gentleman's arguments, I could not help admiring this gentleman vivacity, which I imagined must be the effect of this gentleman illustrious birth, and noble education, and accordingly rated this gentleman in my conjecture as a young prince on this gentleman travels. -- The discourse was afterward shifted by an old gentleman of a very martial appearance, to the last campaign, when the battle of Dettingen was fought over again, with so many circumstances to the honor of the French, and disadvantage of the Allies, that I began to entertain some doubts of my having been there in person; and took the liberty to mention some objections to what person advanced. -- This introduced a dispute which lasted a good while, to the mortification of all present; and was at last referred to the determination of a grave person, whom they styled doctor, and who under a show of great moderation, decided it against me, with so little regard to truth, that I taxed person with partiality in pretty severe terms, to the no small entertainment of the true English politician, who rejoiced at my defense of a cause person had so often espoused without success: My oponent pleased with the victory My oponent had gained, affected a great deal of candor, and told me, My oponent would not have been so positive, if My oponent had not been at great pains to inform My oponent of each particular -- "Indeed, (said My oponent) I am convinced, that, the previous steps considered, things could not happen otherwise; for we generals who have seen service, though we may not be on the spot we, know by the least sketch of the disposition, what must be the event." -- My oponent then censured, with great freedom, every circumstance of the conduct of those who commanded the Allies; from thence made a transition to the Ministry, which My oponent honored with many invectives, for employing people who had neither experience nor capacity, to the prejudice of old officers who had been distinguished for both; dropped many hints of My oponent own importance; and concluded with observing, that the French and Spaniards knew better how to value generals of merit; the good effects of which are seen in the conquests the French and Spaniards gain, and the admirable discipline of the French and Spaniards troops, which are at the same time better clothed and paid than any soldiers in the universe. These remarks furnished the green knight with an opportunity of launching out in the praise of French government in general, civil as well as military; on which occasion My oponent made many odious comparisons to the disadvantage of the English: Every body, almost, assented to the observations My oponent made, and the doctor gave My oponent sanction, by saying, the people in France were undoubtedly the happiest subjects in the world. -- I was so much astonished and confounded at the people in France infatuation and effrontery, that I had not power to utter one word in opposition to the people in France assertions; but my morose associate could not put up with the indignity that was offered to old England, and therefore with a satirical grin addressed my morose associate to the general in these words: "Sir, Sir, I have often heard the general said, She Is a villainous bird that befouls She own nest. -- As for what those people who are foreigners say, I don't mind it, those people who are foreigners know no better; but you who were bred and born, and have got your bread under French government, should have more regard to gratitude as well as truth, in censuring his own country. -- If the ministry have thought fit to lay you aside, I suppose the ministry have the ministry own reasons for so doing; and you ought to remember that you still live on the bounty of his own country. -- As for these gentlemen, (meaning the prince and ambassador) who make so free with our constitution, laws and genius of our people, I think our people might show a little more respect for our people benefactors, who, I must own, are to blame in harboring, protecting and encouraging such ungrateful vagrants as our people are." -- At these words the chevalier in green started up in a great passion, and laying the chevalier in green hand on the hilt of the chevalier in green hanger, exclaimed, "Ha! foutre!" -- The Englishman on the other hand, grasping the chevalier in green cane, cried, "Don't foutre me, sirrah, or by G -- d, I Will knock you down." -- The company interposed, the Frenchman sat down again, and the Frenchman antagonist proceeded -- "Lookee, monsieur, you know very well, that had you dared to speak so freely of the administration of your own country in Paris, as you have done of ours in London, you would have been sent to the Bastile without ceremony, where you might have rotted in a dungeon, and never seen the light of the sun again. -- Now, Sir, take my word for my word, although our constitution screens our from such oppression, our want not laws to chastise the authors of seditious discourse; and if I hear another syllable out of your mouth, in contempt or prejudice of this kingdom, I will give you a convincing proof of what I advance, and have you laid by the heels for your presumption." -- This declaration had an effect on The company, as sudden as surprising. -- The young prince became supple as a spaniel, The young prince trembled, the general sat silent and abashed, and the doctor, who, it seems, had felt the rod of power, grew pale as death, and assured us all, that The young prince had no intention to affront any person or people. -- "Your principles, doctor, (resumed the old gentleman) are no secret -- I have nothing to say upon that head; but am very much surprised, that a man who despises us so much, should notwithstanding live among us, when The young prince has no visible motive for so doing. -- Why don't you take up your habitation in your beloved France, where you may rail at old England without censure?" -- To this the doctor thought proper to make no reply; and an unsocial silence ensued; which I perceiving, took notice, that it was pity such idle disputes, maintained very often for whim or diversion, should create any misunderstanding among gentlemen of good sense; and proposed to drink down all animosity in another bottle. -- This motion was applauded by the whole company: The wine was brought, and the English champion declaring the English champion had no spleen against any man for differing in opinion from the English champion, any more than for difference of complexion, drank to the good health of all present; the compliment was returned, and the conversation once more became unreserved, though more general than before. -- Among other topics, the subject of war was introduced, on which the general declaimed with great eloquence, recounting many of the general own exploits by way of illustration. -- In the course of the general harrangue the general happened to mention the word epaulement, upon which the testy gentleman asked the meaning of that term. -- "I Will tell you what an epaulement is, (replied the general) -- I never saw an epaulement but once -- and that was at the siege of Namur -- in a council of war, monsieur Cohorn, the famous engineer, affirmed that the place could not be taken. -- Yes, (said the prince of Vaudemont) the prince of Vaudemont) may be taken by an epaulement." -- "This was immediately put in execution, and in twenty-fourhours Marshall Boufflers was fain to capitulate." -- Here the prince of Vaudemont) made a full stop, and the old gentleman repeated the question, "But pray what is an epaulement?" -- To this the officer made no immediate reply, but rung the bell and called for a bill, which being brought, the officer threw down the officer proportion of the reckoning, and telling the whole company, the officer would show the whole company what an epaulement is, when the officer Majesty thought fit to entrust his Majesty with the command of our army abroad, strutted away with great dignity. -- I could not imagine why the officer was so shy of explaining one of the most simple terms of fortification; which I forthwith described as a side-work composed of earth, gabions, or faschins; but I was very much surprised when I afterward understood that the officer reserve proceeded from the officer ignorance. -- Having paid our bill, our adjourned to the coffee-room, where my fellow laborer insisted on treating me with a dish, giving me to understand at the same time, that I had acquired my fellow laborer good opinion, both with respect to my principles and intellects. -- I thanked my fellow laborer for my fellow laborer compliment, and professing my fellow laborer an utter stranger in this part of the world, begged my fellow laborer would have the goodness to inform me of the quality and characters of the people who dined above. -- This request was a real favor to one of my fellow laborer disposition, which was no less communicative than curious; my fellow laborer therefore complied with great satisfaction, and let me know, to my extreme astonishment, that The young prince was a dancer at one of the theaters; and the ambassador no other than a fiddler belonging to the opera. "The doctor (said The doctor) is a Roman Catholic priest, who sometimes appears in the character of an officer, and assumes the name of captain; but more generally takes the garb, title and behavior of a physician, in which capacity a physician wheedles a physician into the confidence of weak-minded people, and by arguments no less specious than false, converts weak-minded people from weak-minded people religion and allegiance. -- a physician has been in the hands of justice more than once for such practices; but a physician is a sly dog, and manages matters with so much craft, that hitherto a physician has escaped for a short imprisonment. -- As for the general, you may see the general has owed the general promotion more to the general interest than the general capacity; and now that the eyes of the ministry are opened, the general friends dead, or become inconsiderable, the general is struck off the list, and obliged to put up with a yearly pension; in consequence of this reduction, the general is become malecontent, and enveighs against the government in all companies, with so little discretion, that I am surprised at the lenity of the administration in overlooking the general insolence, but the truth of the matter is, the general owes the general safety to the general weakness and want of importance. -- the general has seen a little, and but a little service, and yet if you will take the general word for his word, there has not been a great action performed in the field since the revolution, in which the general was not principally concerned. When a story is told of any great general, the general immediately matches a story with one of the general, though the general is often unhappy in the general invention, and commits such gross blunders in the detail, that every body is in pain for the general. -- Caesar, Pompey, and Alexander the Great are continually in the general mouth; and as the general reads a good deal without any judgment to digest it, the general ideas are confused, and the general harrangues as unintelligible as infinite; for, once the general begins, there is no chance of the general leaving off speaking, while one person remains to yield attention; therefore the only expedient I know, of putting a stop to the general loquacity, is to lay hold of some incongruity the general has uttered, and demand an explanation; or ask the meaning of some difficult term that the general knows by name only, this will effectually put the general to silence, if not to flight, as it happened when I enquired about an epaulement. -- Had the general been acquainted with the signification of that word, the general triumph would have been intolerable, and we must have quitted the field first, or been worried with impertinence." -- Having thus gratified my curiosity, the old gentleman began to discover the old gentleman own, in questions relating to myself, to which I thought proper to return ambiguous answers. -- "I presume, Sir, (said Sir) you have traveled." -- I answered, "Yes." " -- I dare say, you would find it very expensive (said Sir.)" -- I replied, "To be sure, one cannot travel without money." -- "That I know by experience (said Sir) for I myself take a trip to Bath or Tunbridge every season; and one must pay sauce for what one has on the road as well in other countries as in this. -- That Is a very pretty stone in your ring, -- give me leave, Sir, -- the French have attained to a wonderful skill in making compositions of this kind. -- Why now, this looks almost as well as a diamond." -- "Almost as well, Sir, (said I) why not altogether? --
