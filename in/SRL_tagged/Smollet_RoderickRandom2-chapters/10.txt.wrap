with great indignation, for having thrown away upon rascals, that which, had it been converted into ready money, would have supported the rank of a gentleman for some months, and enabled me, at the same time, to oblige my friends. -- Stupefied as I was, I could easily divine the source of his concern, but sneaked away in a solitary manner, without yielding the least answer to his expostulations; and began to deliberate with myself, in what manner I should attempt to retrieve the movables I had so foolishly lost. -- I would have thought it no robbery to take them again by force, could I have done it without any danger of being detected; but as I could have no such opportunity, I resolved to work by finesse, and go immediately to the lodgings of Straddle, where I was so fortunate as to find him. -- "My Lord, (said I) I have just now recollected, that the diamond I had the honor of presenting to you, is loosened a little in the socket, and there is a young fellow just arrived from Paris, who is reckoned the best jeweller in Europe; I knew him in France, and if your lordship will give me leave, will carry the ring to him to be set to rights." -- His lordship was not to be caught in this snare -- he thanked me for my offer, and let me know, that having himself observed the defect, he had already sent it to his own jeweller to be mended. -- And indeed, by this time, I believe it was in the jeweller's hands, though not in order to be mended, for it stood in need of no alteration.  Baulked in this piece of politics, I cursed my simplicity; but resolved to play a surer game with the Earl, which I had thus devised. -- I did not doubt of being admitted into familiar conversation with him, as before, and hoped by some means, to get the watch into my hand, then on pretense of winding or playing with it, drop it on the floor, which in all probability would disorder the work so as to stop its motion: This event would furnish me with an opportunity of insisting upon carrying it away in order to be repaired; and had this happened, I should have been in no hurry to bring it back. -- What pity it was I could not find an occasion of putting this fine scheme in execution! When I went to renew my visit to his lordship, my access to the parlour was as free as ever; but after I had waited some time, the valet de chamber came in with his Lord's compliments, and a desire to see me tomorrow at his levee, being at present so much indisposed that he could not see company. -- I interpreted this message into a bad omen, and came away muttering curses against his lordship's politeness, and ready to go to loggerheads with myself for being so egregiously duped. -- But that I might have some satisfaction for the loss I had sustained, I besieged him closely at his levee, and persecuted him with my solicitations; not without faint hopes indeed, of reaping something more from my industry, than the bare pleasure of making him uneasy; though I could never obtain another private hearing, during the whole course of my attendance; neither had I resolution enough, to undeceive Strap, whose looks in a little time, were so whetted with impatience, that whenever I came home, his eyes devoured me, as it were, with eagerness of attention.  At length, however, finding myself reduced to my last guinea, I was compelled to disclose my necessity, though I endeavored to sweeten the discovery by rehearsing to him the daily assurances I received from my patron. -- But these promises were not of efficacy sufficient to support the spirits of my friend, who no sooner understood the lowness of my finances, than uttering a dreadful groan, he exclaimed, "In the name of God, what shall we do?" -- In order to comfort him, I said that many of my acquaintance, who were in a worse condition than we, supported, notwithstanding, the character and appearance of gentlemen; and advising him to thank God that we had as yet incurred no debt, proposed he should pawn my sword of steel inlaid with gold, and trust to my discretion for the rest. This expedient was wormwood and gall to poor Strap, who, in spite of his invincible affection for me, still retained notions of economy and expense suitable to the narrowness of his education; nevertheless he complied with my request, and raised seven pieces on the sword in a twinkling. -- This supply, inconsiderable as it was, made me as happy for the present, as if I had had five hundred pounds in bank; for by this time I was so well skilled in procrastinating every troublesome reflection, that the prospect of want seldom affected me very much, let it be ever so near. -- And now indeed it was nearer than I imagined; for my landlord having occasion for money, put me in mind of my being indebted to him five guineas in lodging; and telling me he had a sum to make up, begged I would excuse his importunity and discharge the debt. Though I could ill spare so much cash; my pride took the resolution of disbursing it, which I did in a cavalier manner, after he had written a discharge, telling him with an air of scorn and resentment, I saw he was resolved that I should not be long in his books; while Strap, who stood by, and knew my circumstances, wrung his hands in secret, gnawed his nether lip, and turned yellow with despair. -- Whatever appearance of indifference my vanity enabled me to put on, I was thunderstruck with this demand, which I had no sooner satisfied, than I hastened into company, with a view of beguiling my cares with conversation, or of drowning them in wine.  After dinner, a party was accordingly made in the coffee-house, from whence we adjourned to the tavern, where instead of sharing the mirth of the company, I was as much chagrined at their good humor as a damned soul in hell would be at a glimpse of heaven. -- In vain did I swallow bumper after bumper! the wine had lost its effect upon me, and so far from raising my dejected spirits, could not even lay me asleep. -- Banter, who was the only intimate I had (Strap excepted) perceived my anxiety, and when we broke up, reproached me with pusilanimity, for being cast down at any disappointment that such a rascal as Strutwell could be the occasion of. -- I told him I did not at all see how Strutwell's being a rascal alleviated my misfortune; and gave him to understand that my present grief did not so much proceed from that disappointment, as from the low ebb of my fortune, which was sunk to something less than two guineas. -- At this declaration, he cried, "Pshaw! is that all?" and assured me, there were a thousand ways of living in town without fortune, he himself having subsisted many years entirely by his wit. -- I expressed an eager desire of being acquainted with some of these methods, and he, without further expostulation, bid me follow him. -- He conducted me to a house under the piazzas in Convent Garden, which we entered, and having delivered our swords to a grim fellow who demanded them at the foot of the staircase, ascended to the second story, where I saw multitudes of people standing round two gaming tables, loaded in a manner, with gold and silver. -- My conductor let me know that this was the house of a worthy Scotch Lord, who availing himself of the privilege of his peerage, had set up public gaming tables, from the profits of which he drew a comfortable livelihood. -- He then explained the difference between the sitters and the betters; characterized the first as old rooks, and the last as bubbles; and advised me to try my fortune at the silver table by betting a crown at a time. -- Before I would venture any thing, I considered the company more particularly, and there appeared such a groupe of villainous faces, that I was struck with horror and astonishment at the sight! I signified my surprise to Banter, who whispered in my ear, that the bulk of those present were composed of sharpers, highwaymen, and apprentices, who having embezzled their master's cash, made a desperate push in this place, to make up their deficiencies. -- This account did not encourage me to hazard any part of my small pittance; but at length being teized by the importunities of my friend, who assured me there was no danger of being ill used, people being hired by the owner to see justice done to every body; I began by risquing one shilling, and in less than an hour, my winning amounted to thirty. -- Convinced by this time of the fairness of the game, and animated with success, there was no need of further persuasion to continue the play: I lent Banter (who seldom had any money in his pocket) a guinea, which he carried to the gold table and lost in a moment. -- He would have borrowed another, but finding me deaf to his arguments, went away in a pet. -- Mean while my gain advanced to six pieces, and my desire of more increased in proportion; so that I moved to the higher table, where I laid half a guinea on every throw, and fortune still favoring me, I became a sitter, in which capacity I remained until it was broad day; when I found myself, after many vicissitudes, one hundred and fifty guineas in pocket.  Thinking it now high time to retire with my booty, I asked if any body would take my place, and made a motion to rise; upon which an old gascon, who sat opposite to me, and of whom I had won a little money, started up with fury in his looks, crying, " Restez foutre, restez, il faut donner moi mon ravanchio!" At the same time, a Jew who sat near the other, insinuated that I was more beholden to art than fortune, for what I had got; that he had observed me wipe the table very often, and that some of the divisions seemed to be greasy. This intimation produced a great deal of clamor against me, especially among the losers, who threatened with many oaths and imprecations to take me up by a warrant as a a sharper, unless I would compromise the affair by refunding the greatest part of my winning. -- Though I was far from being easy under this accusation, I relied upon my innocence, threatened in my turn to prosecute the Jew for defamation, and boldly offered to submit my cause to the examination of any justice in Westminster; but they knew themselves too well to put their characters on that issue, and finding I was not to be intimidated into any concession, dropped their plea, and made way for me to withdraw. -- I would not however, stir from the table until the Israelite had retracted what he said to my disadvantage, and asked pardon before the whole assembly.  As I marched out with my prize, I happened to tread upon the toes of a tall raw-boned fellow, with a hooked nose, fierce eyes, black thick eyebrows, a pig-tail wig of the same color, and a formidable hat pulled over his forehead, who stood gnawing his fingers in the crowd, and no sooner felt the application of my shoe-heel, than he roared out in a tremendous voice, "Blood and wounds! you son of a whore, what is that for?" -- I asked pardon with a great deal of submission, and protested I had no intention of hurting him; but the more I humbled myself the more he stormed, and insisted upon gentlemany satisfaction, at the same time provoking me with scandalous names that I could not put up with; so that I gave a loose to my passion, returned his Billingsgate, and challenged him to follow me down to the piazzas. -- His indignation cooling as mine warmed, he refused my invitation, saying, he would choose his own time, and returned toward the table muttering threats, which I neither dreaded nor distinctly heard; but descending with great deliberation, received my sword from the doorkeeper, whom I gratified with a guinea according to the custom of the place, and went home in a rapture of joy.  My faithful valet, who had sat up all night in the utmost uneasiness on my account, let me in with his face beslubbered with tears, and followed me to my chamber, where he stood silent like a condemned criminal, in expectation of hearing that every shilling was spent. -- I guessed the situation of his thoughts, and assuming a sullen look, bid him fetch me some water to wash. -- He replied, without lifting his eyes from the ground, "In my simple conjecture, you have more occasion for rest, not having (I suppose) slept these four and twenty hours." -- "Bring me some water," (said I in a peremptory tone;) upon which he sneaked away shrugging his shoulders. Before he returned I had spread my whole stock on the table in the most ostentatious manner; so that when it first saluted his view, he stood like one intranced, and having rubbed his eyes more than once, to assure himself of his being awake, broke out into, "Lord have mercy upon us, what a vast treasure is here!" -- "'It Is all our own, Strap, (said I) take what is necessary, and redeem the sword immediately." He advanced toward the table, stopped short by the way, looked at the money and me by turns, and with a wildness in his countenance, produced from joy checked by distrust, cried, "I dare say, it is honestly come by." To remove his scruples, I made him acquainted with the whole story of my success, on hearing of which, he danced about the room, in an exstacy, "God be praised! -- a white stone! -- God be praised! -- a white stone!" So that I was afraid the sudden change of fortune had disordered his intellects, and that he was run mad with joy. -- Extremely concerned at this event, I attempted to reason him out of his frenzy, but to no purpose; for, without regarding what I said, he continued to frisk up and down, and repeat his rhapsody of "God be praised! a white stone!" At last, I rose in the utmost consternation, and laying violent hands upon him put a stop to his extravagance, by fixing him down to a settee that was in the room. -- This constraint banished his delirium; he started as if just awoke, and terrified at my behavior, cried, "What is the matter?" When he learned the cause of my apprehension, he was ashamed of his transports, and told me, that in mentioning the white stone, he alluded to the Dies fasti of the Romans, albo lapide notati.  Having no inclination to sleep, I secured my cash, dressed, and was just going abroad, when the servant of the house told me, there was a gentlewoman at the door, who wanted to speak with me. -- Surprised at this information, I bid Strap show her up, and in less than a minute saw a young woman of a shabby decayed appearance enter my room. After half a dozen court'sies, she began to sob, and told me her name was Gawkey; upon which I immediately recollected the features of Miss Lavement, who had been the first occasion of my misfortunes. -- Though I had all the reason in the world, to resent her treacherous usage of me, I was moved at her distress, and professing my sorrow at seeing her so reduced, desired her to sit, and enquired into the particulars of her situation. -- She fell upon her knees, and implored my forgivenness for the injuries she had done me, protesting before God, that she was forced against her inclination, into that hellish conspiracy which had almost deprived me of my life, by the entreaties of her husband, who having been afterward renounced by his father on account of his marriage with her, and unable to support a family on his pay, lest his wife at her father's house, and went with the regiment to Germany, where he was broke for misbehaviour at the battle of Dettingen; since which time she had heard no tidings of him. She then gave me to understand with many symptoms of penitence, that it was her misfortune to bear a child four months after marriage, by which her parents were so incensed, that she was turned out of doors with the infant, that died soon after; and had hitherto subsisted in a miserable indigent manner, on the extorted charity of a few friends, who were now quite tired of giving; that not knowing where or how to support herself one day longer, she had fled for succor even to me, who of all mankind had the least cause to assist her, relying upon the generosity of my disposition, which, she hoped, would be pleased with this opportunity of avenging itself in the noblest manner, on the wretch who had wronged me. -- I was very much affected with her discourse, and having no cause to suspect the sincerity of her repentance, raised her up, freely pardoned all she had done against me, and promised to befriend her as much as lay in my power.  Since my last arrival in London, I had made no advances to the apothecary, imagining it would be impossible for me to make my innocence appear, so unhappily was my accusation circumstanced: Strap indeed had labored to justify me to the schoolmaster; but so far from succeeding in his attempt, Mr. Concordance dropped all correspondence with him, because he refused to quit his connection with me. -- Things being in this situation, I thought a fairer opportunity of vindicating my character could not offer, than that which now presented itself; -- therefore stipulated with Mrs. Gawkey, that before I yielded her the least assistance, she should do me the justice to clear my reputation, by explaining upon oath before a Magistrate, the whole of the conspiracy, as it had been executed against me. -- When she had given me this satisfaction, I presented her with five guineas, a sum so much above her expectation, that she could scarce believe the evidence of her senses, and was ready to worship me for my benevolence. -- The declaration signed with her own hand, I sent to her father, who, upon recollecting and comparing the circumstances of my charge, was convinced of my integrity, and waited on me next day, in company with his friend the schoolmaster, to whom he had communicated my vindication. -- After mutual salutation, Monsieur Lavement began a long apology for the unjust treatment I had received; but I saved him a good deal of breath, by interrupting his harrangue, and assuring him, that so far from entertaining any resentment against him, I thought myself obliged to his lenity, which allowed me to escape, after such strong presumptions of guilt appeared against me. Mr. Concordance thinking it now his turn to speak, observed, that Mr. Random had too much candor and sagacity to be disobliged at their conduct, which, all things considered, could not have been otherwise, with any honesty of intention. "Indeed (said he) if the plot had been unravelled to us by any supernatural intelligence; if it had been whispered by a genie, communicated by a dream, or revealed by an angel from on high, we should have been to blame in crediting ocular demonstration; -- but as we were left in the mist of mortality, it cannot be expected we should be incapable of imposition. -- I do assure you, Mr. Random, no man on earth is more pleased than I am at this triumph of your character; and as the news of your misfortune panged me to the very intrails, this manifestation of your innocence makes my midrif quiver with joy." -- I thanked him for his concern, desired them to undeceive those of their acquaintance who judged harshly of me, and having treated them with a glass of wine, represented to Lavement the deplorable condition of his daughter, and pleaded her cause so effectually, that he consented to settle a small annuity on her for life; but could not be persuaded to take her home, because her mother was so much incensed that she would never see her.  CHAP. LIII. I purchase new clothes -- reprimand Strutwell and Straddle -- Banter proposes another matrimonial scheme -- I accept of his terms -- set out for Bath in a stagecoach, with the young lady and her mother -- the behavior of an officer and lawyer, our fellow-travellers, described -- a smart dialogue between my mistress and the captain.  HAVING finished this affair to my satisfaction, I found myself perfectly at ease, and looking upon the gaming-table as a certain resource for a gentleman in want, became more gay than ever. -- Although my clothes were almost as good as new, I grew ashamed of wearing them, because I thought every body, by this time, had got an inventory of my wardrobe. -- For which reason, I disposed of a good part of my apparel to a salesman in Monmouth-street, for half the value, and bought two new suits with the money. I likewise purchased a plain gold watch, despairing of recovering that which I had so foolishly given to Strutwell, whom, notwithstanding, I still continued to visit at his levee, until the ambassador he had mentioned, set out with a secretary of his own choosing. -- I thought myself then at liberty to expostulate with his lordship, whom I treated with great freedom in a letter, for amusing me with vain hopes, when he neither had the power nor inclination to provide for me. -- Nor was I less reserved with Straddle, whom I in person reproached for misrepresenting to me the character of Strutwell, which I did not scruple to aver was infamous in every respect. -- He seemed very much enraged at my freedom, talked a great deal about his quality and honor, and began to make some comparisons which I thought so injurious to mine, that I demanded an explanation with great warmth; and he was mean enough to equivocate, and condescend in such a manner, that I left him with a hearty contempt of his behavior.  About this time, Banter, who had observed a surprising and sudden alteration in my appearance and disposition, began to enquire very minutely into the cause; and as I did not think fit to let him know the true state of the affair, lest he might make free with my purse, on the strength of having proposed the scheme that filled it, I told him that I had received a small supply from a relation in the country, who at the same time had promised to use all his interest (which was not small) in soliciting some post for me that would make me easy for life. -- "If that be the case (said Banter) perhaps you will not care to mortify yourself a little, in making your fortune another way. -- I have a relation who is to set out for Bath next week, with an only daughter, who being sickly and decrepid, intends to drink the waters for the recovery of her health. -- Her father, who was a rich Turkey merchant, died about a year ago, and left her with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, under the sole management of her mother, who is my kinswoman. -- I would have put in for the plate myself, but there is a breach at present between the old woman and me. -- You must know, that some time ago I borrowed a small sum of her, and promised, it seems, to pay it before a certain time; but being disappointed in my expectation of money from the country, the day clapsed, without my being able to take up my note; upon which she wrote a peremptory letter, threatening to arrest me, if I did not pay the debt immediately: Nettled at this precise behavior, I sent a damned severe answer, which enraged her so much, that she actually took out a writ against me. -- Whereupon, finding the thing grow serious, I got a friend to advance the money for me, discharged the debt, went to her house, and abused her for unfriendly dealing. -- She was provoked by my reproaches, and scolded in her turn. The little deformed urchin joined her mother with such virulence and volubility of tongue, that I was fain to make my retreat, after having been honored with a great many scandalous epithets, which gave me plainly to understand that I had nothing to hope from the esteem of the one, or the affection of the other. -- As they are both utter strangers to life, it is a thousand to one that the girl shall be picked up by some scoundrel or other at Bath, if I don't provide for her otherwise. -- You are a well-looking sellow, Random, and can behave as demurely as a quaker. -- Now if you will give me an obligation for five hundred pounds, to be paid six months after your marriage, I will put you in a method of carrying her in spite of all opposition."  This proposal was too advantageous for me, to be refused: The writing was immediately drawn and executed; and Banter giving me notice of the time when, and the stage-coach in which they were to set out, I bespoke a place in the same convenience; and having hired a horse for Strap, who was charmed with the project, set out accordingly.  As we embarked before day, I had not the pleasure for some time of seeing Miss Snapper (that was the name of my mistress) nor even of perceiving the number and sex of my fellowtravellers, although I guessed that the coach was full, by the difficulty I found in seating myself. -- The first five minutes passed in a general silence, when all of a sudden, the coach heeling to one side, a boisterous voice pronounced, "To the right and left, cover your flanks, damme!" I easily discovered by the tone and matter of this exclamation, that it was uttered by a son of Mars; neither was it hard to conceive the profession of another person, who sat opposite to me, and observed, that we ought to have been well satisfied of the security, before we entered upon the premises. -- These two sallies had not the desired effect: We continued a good while as mute as before, till at length, the gentleman of the sword, impatient of longer silence, made a second effort, by swearing, he had got into a meeting of quakers. -- "I believe so too, (said a shrill female voice, at my left hand) for the spirit of solly begins to move." -- "Out with it then, madam," (replied the soldier.) -- "You seem to have no occasion for a midwife," (cried the lady.) -- "D -- n my blood! (exclaimed the other) a man cannot talk to a woman, but she immediately thinks of a midwife." -- "True, Sir, (said she) I long to be delivered." " -- What! of a mouse, madam?" (said he.) -- "No, Sir, (said she) of a fool." -- "Are you far gone with fool?" (said he.) -- "Little more than two miles," (said she.) -- "By Gad, you're a wit, madam!" (cried the officer) -- "I wish I could with any justice return the compliment," (said the lady.) -- "Zounds! I have done," (said he.) -- "Your bolt is soon shot, according to the proverb," (said she.) -- The warrior's powder was quite spent; the lawyer advised him to drop the prosecution, and a grave matron, who sat on the left hand of the victorious wit, told her, she must not let her tongue run so fast among strangers. -- This reprimand softened with the appellation of child, convinced me that the satirical lady was no other than Miss Snapper, and resolved to regulate my conduct accordingly. The champion finding himself so smartly handled, changed his battery, and began to expatiate on his own exploits. -- "You talk of shot, madam, (said he) damme! I have both given and received some shot in my time -- I was wounded in the shoulder by a pistol ball at Dettingen, where -- I say nothing -- but by G -- d! if it had not been for me -- all is one for that -- I despise boasting, G -- d d -- me!" -- So saying, he whistled one part and hummed another of Black Joke; then addressing himself to the lawyer, went on thus, "Wouldn't you think it damned hard, after having, at the risk of your life, recovered the standard of a regiment, that had been lost, to receive no preferment for your pains! I don't choose to name no names, sink me! but howsomever, this I will refer, by G -- d, and that is this, a musqueteer of the French guards, having taken a standard from a certain cornet of a certain regiment, damme! was retreating with his prize as fast as his horse's heels could carry him, damme! Upon which, I snatched up a firelock that belonged to a dead man, damme! and shot his horse under him, d -- n my blood! The fellow got upon his feet and began to repose me, upon which I charged my bayonet breast high, and run him through the body, by G -- d! -- One of his comrades coming to his assistance, shot me in the shoulder, as I told you before; and another gave me a confusion on the head with the butt end of his carbine; but damme, that did not signify -- I killed one, put the other to flight, and taking up the standard carried it off very deliberately -- But the best joke of all was, the son of a b -- ch of a cornet who had surrendered it in a cowardly manner, seeing it in my possession, demanded it from me, in the front of the line." -- "D -- n my blood (sa^^ he) where did you find my standard?" (says he.) -- "D -- n my blood (said I) where (said I) did you lose it?" (said I.) -- "That Is nothing to you (says he) it is my standard (says he) and by G -- d I Will have it." (says he.) -- "D -- n -- ti -- n seize me (says I) if you shall (says I) till I have first delivered it to the General (says I;) and accordingly I went to the head quarters, after the battle, and delivered it to my Lord Stair, who promised to do for me, but I am no more than a poor lieutenant still, d -- n my blood."  Having vented this repetition of expletives, the lawyer owned he had not been requited according to his deserts; observed, that the labourer is always worthy of his hire, and asked if the promise was made before witnesses, because in that case the law would compel the General to perform it; -- but understanding that the promise was performed during a tete a tete, over a bottle, without being restricted to time or terms, he pronounced it not valid in law, proceeded to enquire into the particulars of the battle, and affirmed, that although the English had drawn themselves into a praemunire at first, the French managed their cause so lamely in the course of the dispute, that they would have been utterly nonsuited, had they not obtained a noli-prosequi. -- In spite of these enlivening touches, the conversation was like to suffer another long interruption; when the lieutenant, unwilling to conceal any of his accomplishments that could be displayed in his present situation, offered to regale the company with a song; and interpreting our silence into a desire of hearing, began to warble a fashionable air, the first stanza of which be pronounced thus: "Would task the moon-ty'd hair, "To yon flagrant beau repair; "Where waving with the poppling vow "The bantling fine will shelter you, etc."   The sense of the rest he perverted as he went on, with such surprising facility, that I could not help thinking he had been at some pains to burlesque the performance. -- Miss Snapper ascribed it to the true cause, namely ignorance; and when he asked her how she relished his music, answered, that in her opinion, the music and the words were much of a piece. -- "O! d -- n my blood! (said he) I take that as a high compliment; for every body allows the words are damnable fine." -- "They may be so, (replied the lady) for ought I know, but they are above my comprehension." -- "I an't obliged to find you comprehension, madam, curse me!" (cried he.) -- "No, nor to speak sense neither," (said she.) -- "D -- n my heart (said he) I Will speak what I please." -- Here the lawyer interposed, by telling him there were some things he must not speak. -- And upon being defied to give an instance, mentioned Treason and Defamation. -- "As for the king, (cried the soldier) God bless him -- I eat his bread, and have lost blood in his cause, therefore I have nothing to say to him -- but by G -- d, I dare say any thing to any other man." -- "No, (said the lawyer) you dare not call me rogue." -- "Damme, for what?" said the other. -- "Because (replied the counselor) I should have a good action against you, and recover." -- "Well, well, (cried the officer) if I dare not call you rogue, I dare think you one, damme! -- This stroke of wit he accompanied with a loud laugh of selfapprobation, which unluckily did not affect the audience, but effectually silenced his antagonist, who did not open his mouth for the space of an hour thereafter, except to clear his pipes with three hemms, which, however, produced nothing.  CHAP. LIVE. Day breaking, I have the pleasure of viewing the person of Miss Snapper, whom I had not seen before -- the soldier is witty upon me -- is offended, talks much of his valor -- is reprimanded by a grave gentlewoman -- we are alarmed with the cry of highwaymen -- I get out of the coach, and stand on my defense -- they ride off without having attacked us -- I pursue them -- one of them is thrown from his horse and taken -- I return to the coach -- am complimented by miss Snapper -- the captain's behavior on this occasion -- the prude reproaches me in a soliloquy -- I upbraid her in the same manner -- the behavior of Mrs. Snapper at breakfast, disobliges me -- the lawyer is witty upon the officer, who threatens him.  IN the mean time, day breaking in upon us, discovered to one another, the faces of their fellow-travellers; and I had the good fortune to find my mistress not quite so deformed nor disagreeable as she had been represented to me. -- Her head, indeed, bore some resemblance to a hatchet, the edge being represented by her face; but she had a certain delicacy in her complexion, and a great deal of vivacity in her eyes, which were very large and black; and though the protuberance of her breast, when considered alone, seemed to drag her forwards, it was easy to perceive an equivalent on her back which balanced the other, and kept her body in equilibrio. -- On the whole, I thought I should have great reason to congratulate myself, if it should be my fate to possess twenty thousand pounds encumbered with such a wife. -- I began therefore to deliberate about the most probable means of acquiring the conquest, and was so much engrossed by this idea, that I scarce took any notice of the rest of the people in the coach, but revolved my prospect in silence; while the conversation was maintained as before, by the object of my hopes, the son of Mars, and the barrister, who by this time had recollected himself, and talked in terms as much as ever. -- At length a dispute happened, which ended in a wager, to be determined by me, who was so much absorpt in contemplation, that I neither heard the reference nor the question which was put to me by each in his turn; affronted at my supposed contempt, the soldier with great vociferation, swore, I was either dumb or deaf, if not both, and that I looked as if I could not say Boh to a goose. -- Arroused at this observation, I fixed my eyes upon him, and pronounced with emphasis, the interjection Boh! Upon which he cocked his hat in a fierce manner and cried, "Damme, Sir, what do you mean by that?" -- Had I intended to answer him, which by the bye, was not my design, I should have been anticipated by Miss, who told him, my meaning was to show, that I could cry boh! to a goose; and laughed very heartily at my laconic reproof. -- Her explanation and mirth did not help to appease his wrath, which broke out in several martial insinuations, such as -- "I do not understand such freedoms, damme! -- D -- n my blood! I Am a gentleman, and bear the king's commission. -- 'Sblood! some people deserve to have their noses pulled for their impertinence." -- I thought to have checked these ejaculations by a frown; because he had talked so much of his valor, that I had long ago rated him an ass with a lion's skin; but so far from answering my expectation, that he took umbrage at the contraction of my brows, swore he did not value my sulky look a fig's end, and protested he feared no man breathing. -- Miss Snapper said, she was very glad to find herself in company with a man of so much courage, who she did not doubt, would protect us all from the attempts of highwaymen, during our journey. -- "Make yourself perfectly easy on that head, madam, (replied the officer) I have got a pair of pistols (here they are) which I took from a horse officer at the battle of Dettingen -- they are double loaded, and if any highwayman in England robbs you of the value of a pin, while I have the honor of being in your company, d -- n my heart." -- When he had expressed himself in this manner, a prim gentlewoman, who had sat silent hitherto, opened her mouth, and said, she wondered how any man could be so rude as to pull out such weapons before ladies. -- "Damme, madam, (cried the champion) if you are so much afraid at sight of a pistol, how do you propose to stand fire if there should be occasion?" -- She let him know, that if she thought he could be so unmannerly as to use firearms in her presence, whatever might be the occasion, she would get out of the coach immediately, and walk to the next village, where she might procure a convenience to herself. -- Before he could make any answer, my Dulcinea interposed, and observed, that so far from being offended at a gentleman's using his arms in his own defense, she thought herself very lucky in being along with one by whose valor she stood a good chance of saving herself from being rifled. -- The prude cast a disdainful look at Miss, and said, that people who have but little to lose, are sometimes the most solicitous about preserving it. -- The old lady was affronted at this inuendo, and took notice, that people ought to be very well informed before they speak slightingly of other people's fortune, lest they discover their own envy, and make themselves ridiculous. -- The daughter declared, that she did not pretend to vie with any body in point of riches; and if the lady who insisted upon nonresistance, would promise to indemnify us all for the loss we should sustain; she should be one of the first to persuade the captain to submission, in case we should be attacked. -- To this proposal, reasonable as it was, the reserved lady made no other reply, than a scornful glance and a toss of her head. -- I was very well pleased with the spirit of my mistress; and even wished for an opportunity of distinguishing my courage under her eye, which I believed, could not fail of prepossessing her in my favor; when all of a sudden, Strap rode up to the coach door, and told us in a great fright, that two men on horseback were crossing the heath (for by this time we had passed Hounslow) and made directly toward us. This piece of information was no sooner delivered, than Mrs. Snapper began scream, her daughter grew pale, the other lady pulled out her purse to be in readiness, the lawyer's teeth chattered, while he pronounced, "'It Is no matter -- we'll sue the county and recover." -- The captain gave evident signs of confusion; and I, after having commanded the coachman to stop, opened the door, jumped out, and invited the warrior to follow me. -- But finding him backward and astonished, I took his pistols, and giving them to Strap, who had by this time alighted, and trembled very much, I mounted on horseback; and taking my own, (which I could better depend upon) from the holsters, cocked them both, and faced the robbers, who were now very near us. -- Seeing me ready to oppose them on horseback, and another man armed a-foot, they made a halt at some distance to reconnoitre us, and after having rode round us twice, myself still facing about as they rode, went off the same way they came, at a hand gallop. -- A gentleman's servant coming up with a horse at the same time, I offered him a crown to assist me in pursuing them, which he no sooner accepted, than I armed him with the officer's pistols, and we galloped after the thieves, who trusting to the swiftness of their horses, stopped, till we came within shot of them, and then firing at us, put their nags to the full speed. -- We followed them as fast as our beasts could carry us, but not being so well mounted as they, our efforts would have been to little purpose, had not the horse of one of them stumbled and thrown his rider with such violence over his head, that he lay senseless, when we came up, and was taken without the least opposition, while his comrade consulted his own safety in flight, without regarding the distress of his friend. We scarce had time to make ourselves masters of his arms, and tie his hands together, before he recovered his senses; when learning his situation, he affected surprise, demanded to know by what authority we used a gentleman in that manner, and had the impudence to threaten us with a prosecution for robbery. -- In the mean time we perceived Strap coming up with a crowd of people, armed with different kinds of weapons; and among the rest a farmer, who no sooner perceived the thief, whom we had secured, than he cried with great emotion, "There Is the fellow who robbed me an hour ago, of twenty pounds, in a canvas bag." -- He was immediately searched, and the money found exactly as it had been described: Upon which, we committed him to the charge of the countryman, who guarded him to the town of Hounslow, which it seems the farmer had alarmed; and having satisfied the footman for his trouble according to promise, returned with Strap to the coach, where I found the captain and lawyer busy in administering smelling bottles and cordials to the grave lady, who had gone into a fit at the noise of the firing.  When I had taken my seat, Miss Snapper, who from the coach had seen every thing that happened, made me a compliment on my behavior, and said, she was glad to see me returned, without having received any injury; her mother too owned herself obliged to my resolution; and the lawyer told me, that I was entitled by act of parliament to a reward of forty pounds, for having apprehended a highwayman. -- The soldier observed, with a countenance in which impudence and shame struggling, produced some disorder, that if I had not been in such a damned hurry to get out of the coach, he would have secured the rogues effectually, without all this bustle and loss of time, by a scheme which my heat and precipitation ruined. -- "For my own part, (continued he) I am always extremely cool on these occasions." -- "So it appeared, by your trembling" (said the young lady.) -- "Death and damnation (cried he) your sex protects you, madam; if any man on earth durst tell me so much, I Would send him to hell, d -- n my heart! in an instant." -- So saying, he fixed his eyes on me, and asked if I had seen him tremble. -- I answered without hesitation, "Yes." -- "Damme, Sir, (said he) do you doubt my courage?" -- I replied, "Very much." -- This declaration quite disconcerted him. -- He looked blank, and pronounced with a faultering voice, "O! it is very well -- d -- n my blood! I shall find a time." -- I signified my contempt of him, by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath during the whole journey.  The precise lady, having recruited her spirits by the help of some strong waters, began a soliloquy, in which she wondered that any man, who pretended to maintain the character of a gentleman, could, for the sake of a little paultry coin, throw persons of honor into such quandaries as might endanger their lives; and professed her surprise, that women were not ashamed to commend such brutality. At the same time vowing, that for the future she would never set foot in a stage-coach, if a private convenience could be had for love or money.  Nettled at her remarks, I took the same method of conveying my sentiments, and wondered in my turn, that any woman of common sense, should be so unreasonable as to expect that people who had neither acquaintance nor connection with her, would tamely allow themselves to be robbed and mal-treated, merely to indulge her capricious humor. I likewise confessed my astonishment at her insolence and ingratitude in taxing a person with brutality, who deserved her approbation and acknowledgment; and vowed, that if ever we should be assaulted again, I would leave her to the mercy of the spoiler, that she might know the value of my protection.  This person of honor did not think fit to carry on the altercation any further, but seemed to chew the cud of her resentment, with the crestfallen captain, while I entered into discourse with my charmer, who was the more pleased with my conversation, as she had conceived a very indifferent opinion of my intellects from my former silence. I should have had cause to be equally satisfied with the sprightliness of her genius, could she have curbed her imagination with judgment; but she labored under such a profusion of talk, that I dreaded her unruly tongue, and felt by anticipation the horrors of an eternal clack! However, when I considered on the other hand, the joys attending the possession of twenty thousand pounds, I forgot her imperfections, seized occasion by the fore-lock, and endeavored to insinuate myself into her affection. -- The careful mother kept a strict watch over her, and though she could not help behaving civilly to me, took frequent opportunities of discouraging our communication, by reprimanding her for being so free with strangers, and telling her she must learn to speak less, and think more. -- A bridged of the use of speech, we conversed with our eyes, and I found the young lady very eloquent in this kind of discourse. In short, I had reason to believe, that she was sick of the old gentlewoman's tuition, and that I should find it no difficult matter to supersede her authority.  When we arrived at the place where we were to breakfast, I alighted and helped my mistress out of the coach, as well as her mother, who called for a private room, to which they withdrew, in order to eat by themselves. -- As they retired together, I perceived that Miss had got more twists from nature, than I had before observed, being bent sideways into the figure of an S, so that her progression very much resembled that of a crab. -- The prude also chose the captain for her mess-mate, and ordered breakfast for two only to be brought into another separate room; while the lawyer and I, deserted by the rest of the company, were fain to put up with one another. I was a good deal chagrined at the stately reserve of Mrs. Snapper, who I thought did not use me with all the complaisance I deserved; and my companion declared, that he had been a traveller these twenty years, and never knew the stage-coach rules so much infringed before. As for the honorable gentlewoman, I could not conceive the meaning of her attachment to the lieutenant; and asked the lawyer if he knew for which of the soldier's virtues she admired him? The counselor facetiously replied, "I suppose the lady knows him to be an able conveyancer, and wants him to make a settlement intail." -- I could not help laughing at the archness of the barrister, who entertained me during breakfast, with a great deal of wit of the same kind, at the expense of our fellow-travellers; and among other things said, he was sorry to find the young lady saddled with such encumbrances.  When we had made an end of our repast, and paid our reckoning, we went into the coach, took our places, and bribed the driver with sixpence, to revenge us on the rest of his fare, by hurrying them away in the midst of their meal. -- This he performed to our satisfaction, after he had disturbed their enjoyment with his importunate clamor. -- The mother and daughter obeyed the summons first, and coming to the coach-door, were obliged to desire the coachman's assistance to get in, because the lawyer and I had agreed to show our resentment by our neglect. -- They were no sooner seated, than the captain appeared as much heated as if he had been pursued a dozen of miles by an enemy; and immediately after him came the lady, not without some marks of disorder. -- Having helped her up, he entered himself, growling a few oaths against the coachman for his impertment interruption; and the lawyer comforted him, by saying, that if he had suffered a nisi prius through the obstinacy of the defendant, he would have an opportunity to join issue at the next stage. This last expression gave offense to the grave gentlewoman, who told him, if she was a man, she would make him repent of such obscenity, and thanked God she had never been in such company before. -- At this insinuation, the captain thought himself under a necessity of espousing the lady's cause; and accordingly threatened to cut the lawyer's ears out of his head, if he should give his tongue any such liberties for the future. -- The poor counselor begged pardon, and universal silence ensued.  CHAP. LV. I resolve to ingratiate myself with the mother, and am favored by accident -- the precise lady finds her husband, and quits the coach -- the captain is disappointed of his dinner -- we arrive at Bath -- I accompany Miss Snapper to the long room, where she is attacked by beau N -- h, and turns the laugh against him -- I make love to her, and receive a check -- I squire her to an assembly, where I am blessed with a sight of my dear Narcissa, which discomposes me so much, that Miss Snapper observing my disorder, is at pains to discover the cause -- is picqued at the occasion, and in our way home, pays me a sarcastic compliment -- I am met by Miss Williams, who is maid and confidante of Narcissa -- she acquaints me with her lady's regard for me while under the disguise of a servant, and describes the transports of Narcissa on seeing me at the assembly, in the character of a gentleman -- I am surprised with an account of her aunt's marriage, and make an appointment to meet Miss Williams next day.  DURING this unsocial interval, my pride and interest maintained a severe conflict, on the subject of Miss Snapper, whom the one represented as unworthy of my notice, and the other proposed as the object of my whole attention: The advantages and disadvantages attending such a match, were opposed to one another by my imagination; and at length, my judgment gave it so much in favor of the first, that I resolved to prosecute my scheme, with all the address in my power. -- I thought I perceived some concern in her countenance, occasioned by my silence, which she no doubt imputed to my disgust at her mother's behavior; and as I believed the old woman could not fail of ascribing my muteness to the same motive, I determined to continue that sullen conduct toward her, and fall upon some other method of manifesting my esteem for the daughter; nor was it difficult for me to make her acquainted with my sentiments by the expression of my looks, which I modelled into the characters of humility and love; and which were answered by her with all the sympathy and approbation I could desire. But when I began to consider, that without further opportunities of improving my success, all the progress I had hitherto made could not much avail, and that such opportunities could not be enjoyed without the mother's permission; I concluded it would be requisite to vanquish her coldness and suspicion by my assiduities and respectful behavior on the road; and she would in all likelihood invite me to visit her at Bath, where I did not fear of being able to cultivate her acquaintance as much as would be necessary to the accomplishment of my purpose. -- And indeed accident furnished me with an opportunity of obliging her so much, that she could not with any appearance of good manners, forbear to gratify my inclination.  When we arrived at our dining-place, we found all the eatables in the inn bespoke by a certain nobleman, who had got the start of us; and in all likelihood, my mistress and her mother must have dined with Duke Humphrey, had I not exerted myself in their behalf, and bribed the landlord with a glass of wine to curtail his lordship's entertainment of a couple of fowls and some bacon, which I sent with my compliments to the ladies; they accepted my treat with a great many thanks, and desired I would favor them with my company at dinner, where I amused the old gentlewoman so successfully, by maintaining a seemingly disinterested ease, in the midst of my civility, that she signified a desire of being better acquainted, and hoped I would be so kind as to see her sometimes at Bath. -- While I enjoyed myself in this manner, the precise lady had the good fortune to meet with her husband, who was no other than gentleman, or in other words, valet de chamber to the very nobleman, whose coach stood at the door. Proud of the interest she had in the house, she affected to show her power by introducing the captain to her spouse, as a person who had treated her with great civility; upon which he was invited to a share of their dinner; while the poor lawyer, finding himself utterly abandoned, made application to me, and was, through my intercession, admitted into our company. -- Having satisfied our appetites, and made ourselves very merry at the expense of the person of honor, the civil captain, and complaisant husband, I did myself the pleasure of discharging the bill by stealth, for which I received a great many apologies and acknowledgments from my guests, and we reimbarked at the first warning. -- The officer was obliged, at last, to appease his hunger with a luncheon of bread and cheese, and a pint bottle of brandy, which he dispatched in the coach, cursing the inappetence of his lordship, who had ordered dinner to be put back a whole hour.  Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey, which was ended about twelve a-clock, when I waited on the ladies to the house of a relation, in which they intended to lodge, and passing that night at the inn, took lodgings next morning for myself.  The forenoon was spent in visiting every thing that was worth seeing in the place, which I did in company with a gentleman to whom Banter had given me a letter of introduction; and in the afternoon I waited on the ladies, and found Miss a good deal indisposed with the fatigues of the journey. -- As they foresaw they would have occasion for a male acquaintance to squire them at all public places, I was received with great cordiality, and had the mother's permission to conduct them next day to the long room, which we no sooner entered, than the eyes of every body present were turned upon us; and when we had suffered the martyrdom of their looks for some time, a whisper circulated at our expense, which was accompanied with many contemptuous smiles, and tittering observations, to my utter shame and confusion. -- I did not so much conduct as follow my charge to a place where she seated her mother and herself with astonishing composure, notwithstanding the unmannerly behavior of the whole company, which seemed to be assumed merely to put her out of countenance. -- The celebrated Mr. N -- h, who commonly attends in this place, as master of the ceremonies, perceiving the disposition of the assembly, took upon himself the task of gratifying their ill nature still further, by exposing my mistress to the edge of his wit. -- With this view he approached us, with many bows and grimaces, and after having welcomed Miss Snapper to the place, asked her, in the hearing of all present, if she could inform him of the name of Tobit's dog. -- I was so much incensed at his insolence, that I should certainly have kicked him where he stood, without ceremony, had not the young lady prevented the effects of my indignation, by replying with the utmost vivacity, "His name was N -- sh, and an impudent dog he was." This repartee, so unexpected and just, raised such an universal laugh at the aggressor, that all his assurance was insufficient to support him under their derision; so that after he had endeavored to compose himself, by taking snuff, and forcing a smile, he was obliged to sneak off in a very ludicrous attitude; while my Dulcinea was applauded to the skies, for the brilliancy of her wit, and her acquaintance immediately courted by the best people of both sexes in the room. -- This event, with which I was infinitely pleased at first, did not fail of alarming me, upon further reflection, when I considered that the more she was caressed by persons of distinction, the more her pride would be inflamed, and consequently, the obstacles to my success multiplied and enlarged. -- Nor were my presaging fears untrue -- That very night I perceived her a little intoxicated with the incense she had received, and though she still behaved with a particular civility to me, I foresaw that as soon as her fortune should be known, she would be surrounded with a swarm of admirers, some one of whom might possibly, by excelling me in point of wealth, or in the arts of flattery and scandal, supplant me in her esteem, and find means to make the mother of his party. -- I resolved therefore to lose no time, and being invited to spend the evening with them, found an opportunity, in spite of the old gentlewoman's vigilance, to explain the meaning of my glances in the coach, by paying homage to her wit, and professing myself enamoured of her person. -- She blushed at my declaration, and in a favorable manner disapproved of the liberty I had taken, putting me in mind of our being strangers to one another, and desiring I would not be the means of interrupting our acquaintance, by any such unseasonable strokes of gallantry for the future. -- My ardour was effectually checked by this reprimand, which was, however, delivered in such a gentle manner, that I had no cause to be disobliged; and the arrival of her mother relieved me from a dilemma in which I should not have known how to demean myself a minute longer. -- Neither could I resume the easiness of carriage with which I came in, my mistress acted on the reserve, and the conversation beginning to flag, the old lady introduced her kinswoman of the house, and proposed a hand at whist.  While we amused ourselves at this diversion, I understood from the gentlewoman, that there was to be an assembly next night, at which I begged to have the honor of dancing with Miss. She thanked me for the favor I intended her, assured me, she never did dance, but signified a desire of seeing the company; upon which I offered my service, and was accepted; not a little proud of being exempted from appearing with her, in a situation, that, notwithstanding my profession to the contrary, was not at all agreeable to my inclination.  Having supped, and continued the game, till such time as the successive yawns of the mother warned me to begone, I took my leave, and went home, where I made Strap very happy with an account of my progress. -- Next day I put on my gayest apparel, and went to drink tea at Mrs. Snapper's, according to appointment, when I found, to my inexpressible satisfaction, that she was laid up with the toothache, and that Miss was to be entrusted to my care. -- Accordingly, we set out for the ball-room, pretty early in the evening, and took possession of a commodious place, where we had not sat longer than a quarter of an hour, when a gentleman dressed in a green frock came in, leading a young lady, whom I immediately discovered to be the adorable Narcissa! Good heaven! what were the thrillings of my soul at that instant! my reflection was overwhelmed with a torrent of agitation! my heart throbbed with surprising violence! a sudden mist overspread my eyes! my ears were invaded with a dreadful sound! I panted for want of breath, and in short, was for some moments intranced! -- This first tumult subsiding, a crowd of flattering ideas rushed upon my imagination: Every thing that was soft, sensible, and engaging in the character of that dear creature, recurred to my remembrance, and every favorable circumstance of my own qualifications appeared in all the aggravation of self-conceit, to heighten my expectation! -- Neither was this transport of long duration: The dread of her being already disposed of, intervened, and over-cast my enchanting reverie! My presaging apprehension represented her encircled in the arms of some happy rival, and of consequence for ever lost to me! I was stung with this suggestion, and believing the person who conducted her, to be the husband of this amiable young lady, already devoted him to my fury, and stood up to mark him for my vengeance; when I recollected, to my unspeakable joy, her brother the foxhunter, in the person of her gallant. -- Undeceived so much to my satisfaction in this particular, I gazed in a frenzy of delight, on the irresistible charms of his sister, who no sooner distinguished me in the crowd, than her evident confusion afforded a happy omen to my flame. -- At sight of me she started, the roses instantly vanished from her polished cheeks, and returned in a moment with a double glow that overspread her lovely neck, while her enchanting bosom heaved with strong emotion. -- I hailed these favorable symptoms, and lying in wait for her looks, did homage with my eyes. -- She seemed to approve my declaration, by the complacency of her aspect; and I was so transported with the discovery, that more than once, I was on the point of making up to her, and disclosing the throbbings of my heart in person, had not that profound veneration which her presence always inspired, restrained the unseasonable impulse. -- My whole powers being engrossed in this manner, it may be easily imagined how ill I entertained Miss Snapper, on whom I could not now turn my eyes, without making comparisons very little to her advantage. -- It was not even in my power to return distinct answers to the questions she asked from time to time, so that she could not help observing my absence of behavior; and having a turn, for observation, watched my glances, and tracing them to the divine object, discovered the cause of my disorder. -- That she might, however, be convinced of the truth of her conjecture, she began to interrogate me with regard to Narcissa, and notwithstanding all my endeavors to disguise my sentiments, perceived my attachment by my confusion. -- Upon which, she assumed a stateliness of behavior, and sat silent during the remaining part of the entertainment. -- At any other time I should have been prodigiously alarmed at her suspicion, but at that instant, I was elevated by my passion above every other consideration. -- The mistress of my soul having retired with her brother, I discovered so much uneasiness at my situation, that Miss Snapper proposed to go home; and while I conducted her to a chair, told me she had too great a regard for me to keep me any longer in torment. -- I feigned ignorance of her meaning, and having seen her safely at her lodgings, took my leave, and went home in an exstasy; where I disclosed every thing that had happened to my confident and humble servant Strap, who did not relish the accident so well as I expected; and observed, that a bird in hand is worth two in the bush. -- "But however (said he) you know best -- you know best." -- Next day as I went to the Bath, in hopes of seeing or hearing some tidings of my fair enslaver, I was met by a gentlewoman, who having looked hard at me, cried, "O Christ! Mr. Random!" Surprised at this exclamation, I examined the countenance of the person who spoke, and immediately recognized my old sweetheart and fellow-sufferer Miss Williams.  I was mightily pleased to find this unfortunate woman under such a decent appearance, professed my joy at seeing her well, and desired to know where I should have the pleasure of her conversation. She was as heartily rejoiced at the apparent easiness of my fortune, and gave me to know that she, as yet, had no habitation that she could properly call her own; but would wait on me at any place I would please to appoint -- Understanding that she was disengaged for the present, I showed her the way to my own lodgings, where, after a very affectionate salutation, she informed me of her being very happy in the service of a young lady, to whom she was recommended by a former mistress deceased, into whose family she had introduced herself by the honest deceit she had concerted, while she lived with me in the garret at London -- She then expressed a vehement desire to be acquainted with the vicissitudes of my life since we parted, and ascribed her curiosity to the concern she had for my interest -- I forthwith gratified her request, and when I described my situation in Sussex, perceived her to attend to my story with particular eagerness. She interrupted me when I had finished that period, with "good God! is it possible," -- and then begged I would be so good as to continue my relation; which I did as briefly as I could, burning with impatience to know the cause of her surprise, about which I had already formed a very interesting conjecture -- Having therefore brought my adventures down to the present day, she seemed very much affected with the different circumstances of my fortune; and saying with a smile, she believed my distresses were now at a period, proceeded to inform me, that the lady whom she served was no other than the charming Narcissa, who had honored her with her confidence for some time, -- that in consequence of that trust, she had often repeated the story of John Brown, with great admiration and regard; that she loved to dwell upon the particulars of his character, and did not scruple to own a tender approbation of his flame -- I became delirious with this piece of intelligence, strained Miss Williams in my embrace, called her the angel of my happiness, and acted such extravagancies, that she would have been convinced of my sincerity, had not my honor been clear enough to her before -- As soon as I was in a condition to yield attention, she described the present situation of her mistress, who had no sooner come home the night before, than she closeted her, and in a rapture of joy, gave her to know that she had seen me at the ball, where I appeared in the character which she always thought my due, with such advantage of transformation, that unless my image had been engraven on her heart, it would have been impossible to know me for the person who had worn her aunt's livery; -- that by the language of my eyes, she was assured of the continuance of my passion for her, and consequently of my being unengaged to any other; and that though she did not doubt, I would speedily fall upon some method of being introduced, she was so impatient to hear of me, that she (Miss Williams) had been sent abroad this very morning, on purpose to learn tidings of the name and character I at present bore. -- My bosom had been hitherto a stranger to such a flood of joy as now rushed upon it: My faculties were overborn by the tide: It was some time, before I could open my mouth; and much longer 'ere I could utter a coherent sentence -- At length, I servently requested her to lead me immediately to the object of my adoration: but she resisted my importunity, and explained the danger of such premature conduct -- "How favorable soever (said she) my lady's inclination toward you may be, this you may depend upon, that she will not commit the smallest trespass on decorum, either in disclosing her own, or in receiving a declaration of your passion: and although the great veneration I have for you, has prompted me to reveal what she communicated to me in confidence, I know so well the seveverity of her sentiments with respect to the punctilios of her sex, that, if she should learn the least surmise of it, she would not only dismiss me as a wretch unworthy of her benevolence, but also for ever shun the efforts of your love" -- I assented to the justness of her remonstrance, and desired she would assist me with her advice and direction: upon which, it was concerted between us, that for the present, I should be contented with her telling Narcissa that in the course of her inquiries, she could only learn my name: and that if in a day or two, I could fall upon no other method of being made acquainted, she would deliver a letter from me, on pretense of consulting her happiness; and say that I met her in the streets, and bribed her to that piece of service. -- Matters being thus adjusted, I kept my old acquaintance to breakfast, and learned from her conversation, that my rival Sir Timothy had drunk himself into an apoplexy, of which he died five months ago, that the savage was still unmarried, and that his aunt had been seized with a whim which he little expected, and chosen the schoolmaster of the parish for her lord and husband: but matrimony not agreeing with her constitution, she had been hectic and dropsical a good while, and was now at Bath in order to drink the waters for the recovery of her health; that her niece had accompanied her thither at her request, and attended her with the same affection as before, notwithstanding the faux pas she had committed: and that her nephew who had been exasperated at the loss of her fortune, did not give his attendance out of good will, but purely to have an eye on his sister, lest she should likewise throw herself away, without his consent or approbation. -- Having enjoyed ourselves in this manner, and made an assignation to meet next day at a certain place, Miss Williams took her leave; and Strap's looks being very inquisitive about the nature of the communication subsisting between us, I made him acquainted with the whole affair, to his great astonishment and satisfaction.  CHAP. LVI. I become acquainted with Narcissa's brother who invites me to his house -- where I am introduced to that adorable creature -- after dinner, the squire retires to take his nap -- Freeman, guessing the situation of my thoughts, withdraws likewise on pretense of business -- I declare my passion for Narcissa -- am well received -- charmed with her conversation -- the squire detains us to supper -- I elude his design by a stratagem, and get home sober.  IN the afternoon, I drank tea at the house of Mr. Freeman, to whom I had been recommended by Banter; where I had not sat five minutes, 'till the fox-hunter came in, and by his familiar behavior, appeared to be intimate with my friend -- I was, at first, under some concern, lest he should recollect my features; but when I found myself introduced to him as a gentleman from London, without being discovered, I blessed the opportunity that brought me into his company; hoping, that in the course of our acquaintance, he would invite me to his house -- nor were my hopes frustrated, for as we spent the evening together, he grew extremely fond of my conversation, asked a great many childish questions about France and foreign parts; and seemed so highly entertained with my answers, that in his cups, he shook me often by the hand, pronounced me an honest fellow, and in fine, desired our company at dinner next day, in his own house. -- My imagination was so much employed in anticipating the happiness I was to enjoy next day, that I slept very little that night; but getting up early in the morning, went to the place appointed, where I met my she-friend, and imparted to her my success with the squire -- She was very much pleased at the occasion, which (she said) could not fail of being agreeable to Narcissa, who in spite of her passion for me, had mentioned some scruples relating to my true situation and character, which the delicacy of her sentiments suggested, and which she believed I would find it necessary to remove, though she did not know how. -- I was a good deal startled at this insinuation, because I foresaw the difficulty I should find in barely doing myself justice; for although it never was my intention to impose myself upon any woman, much less on Narcissa, as a man of fortune, I laid claim to the character of a gentleman, by birth, education and behavior; and yet (so unlucky had the circumstances of my life fallen out) I should find it a very hard matter to make good my pretensions even to these, especially to the last, which was the most essential -- Miss Williams was as sensible as I, of this my disadvantage; but comforted me with observing, that when once a woman has bestowed her affections on a man, she cannot help judging of him in all respects, with a partiality easily influenced in his favor; -- she remarked that although some situations of my life had been low, yet none of them had been infamous; that my indigence had been the crime not of me, but of fortune; and that the miseries I had undergone, by improving the faculties both of mind and body, qualified me the more for any dignified station; and would of consequence, recommend me to the good graces of any sensible woman; -- she therefore advised me to be always open and unreserved to the inquiries of my mistress, without unnecessarily betraying the meanest occurrences of my fate; and trust to the strength of her love and reflection, for the rest. -- The sentiments of this sensible young woman on this, as well as on almost every other subject, perfectly agreed with mine; I thanked her for the care she took of my interests, and promising to behave myself according to her direction, we parted, after she had assured me, that I might depend upon her best offices with her mistress, and that she would front time to time, communicate to me such intelligence as she could procure, relating to my flame. -- Having dressed myself to the best advantage, I waited for the time of dinner with the most fearful impatience; and as the hour drew nigh, my heart beat with such increased velocity, and my spirits contracted such disorder, that I began to suspect my resolution, and even to wish myself disengaged: -- At last Mr. Freeman called at my lodgings, in his way, and I accompanied him to the house where all my happiness was deposited. -- We were very kindly received by the squire, who sat smoking his pipe in a parlour, and asked if we chose to drink any thing before dinner; though I never had more occasion for a cordial, I was ashamed to accept his offer, which was also refused by my friend. We sat down (however) and entered into conversation, which lasted half an hour, so that I had time to recollect myself; and (so capricious were my thoughts) even to hope that Narcissa would not appear -- when all of a sudden, a servant coming in, gave us notice that dinner was upon the table -- and my perturbation returned with such violence, that I could scarce conceal it from the company as I ascended the staircase. -- When I entered the dining room, the first object that saluted my ravished eyes, was the divine Narcissa, blushing like Aurora, adorned with all the graces that meekness, innocence and beauty can diffuse! I was seized with a giddiness, my knees tottered, and I scarce had strength enough to perform the ceremony of salutation, when her brother slapping me upon the shoulder, cried "Measter Randan, that there is my sister." I approached her with eagerness and fear; but in the moment of our embrace, my soul was agonized with rapture! -- It was a lucky circumstance for us both, that my entertainer was not endued with an uncommon stock of penetration; for our mutual confusion was so manifest, that Mr. Freeman perceived it, and as we went home together, congratulated me on my good fortune. -- But so far was Bruin from entertaining the least suspicion, that he encouraged me to begin a conversation with my mistress in a language unknown to him, by telling her, that he had brought a gentleman (meaning me) who could jabber with her in French and other foreign lingos, as fast as she pleased: then turning to me, said, "Odds bobs! I wish you would hold discourse with her, in your French or Italiano; and tell me if she understands it as well as she would be thought to do -- there is her aunt and she will chatter together whole days in it, and I cannot have a mouthful of English for love or money." I consulted the looks of my amiable mistress, and sound her averse to his proposal, which indeed she declined with a sweetness of denial peculiar to herself, as a piece of disrespect to that part of the company which did not understand the language in question. As I had the happiness of sitting opposite to her, I feasted my eyes much more than my palate, which she tempted in vain with the most delicious bits carved by her fair hand, and recommended by her persuasive tongue; -- but all my other appetites were swallowed up in the immensity of my love, which I fed by gazing incessantly on the delightful object. -- Dinner was scarce ended, when the squire became very drousy, and after several dreadful yawns, got up, stretched himself, took two or three turns across the room, begged we would allow him to take a short nap, and having laid a strong injunction on his sister to detain us 'till his return, went to his repose without any further ceremony. -- He had not been gone many minutes, when Freeman guessing the situation of my heart, and thinking he could not do me a greater favor, than to leave me alone with Narcissa, pretended to recollect himself all of a sudden, and starting up, begged the lady's pardon for half an hour, having luckily remembered an engagement of some consequence, that he must perform at that instant, -- so saying, he went away, promising to be back in time enough for tea; leaving my mistress and me in great confusion. -- Now that I enjoyed an opportunity of disclosing the pantings of my soul, I had not power to use it -- I studied many pathetic declarations, but when I attempted to give them utterance, my tongue denied its office; and she sat silent, with a downcast look full of anxious alarm, her bosom heaving with expectation of some great event -- At length, I endeavored to put an end to this solemn pause, and began with "It is very surprising, Madam -- here the sound dying away, I made a full stop -- while Narcissa starting, blushed, and with a timid accent, answered, "Sir? -- Confounded at this note of interrogation, I pronounced with the most sheepish bashfulness, "Madam!" to which she replied, "I beg pardon -- I thought you had spoke to me." -- Another pause ensued -- I made another effort, and though my voice faultered very much at the beginning, made shift to express myself in this manner: -- "I say, Madam, it is very surprising that love should act so inconsistent with itself, as to deprive its votaries of the use of their faculties, when they have most occasion for them. Since the happy occasion of being alone with you presented itself, I have made many unsuccessful attempts to declare a passion for the loveliest of her sex -- a passion which took possession of my soul, while my cruel fate compelled me to wear a servile disguise so unsuitable to my birth, sentiments, and let me add, my deserts; yet favorable in one respect, as it furnished me with opportunities of seeing and adoring your perfections -- Yes, Madam, it was then your dear idea entered my bosom, where it has lived unimpaired in the midst of numberless cares, and animated me against a thousand dangers and calamities!" -- While I spoke thus, she concealed her face with her fan; and when I ceased, recovering herself from the most beautiful confusion, told me, that she thought herself very much obliged by my favorable opinion of her; and that she was very sorry to hear I had been unfortunate -- Encouraged by this gentle reply, I proceeded, owned myself sufficiently recompensed by her kind compassion for what I had undergone, and declared that the future happiness of my life depended solely upon her. -- "Sir, (said she) I should be very ungrateful, if after the signal protection you once afforded me, I could refuse to contribute toward your happiness, in any reasonable condescension." -- Transported at this acknowledgment, I threw myself at her feet, and begged she would regard my passion with a favorable eye: She was alarmed at my behavior, entreated me to rise lest her brother should discover me in that posture, and to spare her, for the present, upon a subject for which she was altogether unprepared. -- Upon this, I rose, assuring her I would rather die than disobey her; but in the mean time begged her to consider how precious the minutes of this opportunity were, and what restraint I put upon my inclination, in sacrificing them to her desire. -- She smiled with unspeakable sweetness, and said, there would be no want of opportunities, provided I could maintain the good opinion her brother had conceived of me; and I, enchanted with her charms, seized her hand, which I well nigh devoured with kisses -- But she checked my boldness with a severity of countenance; and desired I would not so far forget myself or her, as to endanger the esteem she had for me; -- she reminded me of our being almost strangers to one another, and of the necessity there was, for her knowing me better, before she could take any resolution in my favor; and, in short, mingled so much good sense and complacency in her reproof, that I became as much enamoured of her understanding, as I had been before of her beauty, and asked pardon for my presumption with the utmost reverence of conviction -- She forgave my offense with her usual affability; and sealed my pardon with a look so full of bewitching tenderness, that for some minutes, my senses were lost in exstasy! I afterward endeavored to regulate my behavior according to her desire, and turn the conversation upon a more indifferent subject; but her presence was an unsurmountable obstacle to my design; while I behold so much excellence, I found it impossible to call my attention from the contemplation of it! I gazed with unutterable fondness! I grew mad with admiration! -- "My condition is unsupportable (cried I) I am distracted with passion! why are you so exquisitely fair? -- Why are you so enchantingly good? -- Why has nature dignified you with charms so much above the standard of woman; and, wretch that I am, how dares my unworthiness aspire to the enjoyment of such perfection!"  She was startled at my ravings, reasoned down my transport, and by her irresistible eloquence, soothed my soul into a state of tranquil felicity; but lest I might suffer a relapse, industriously promoted other subjects to entertain my imagination -- she chid me for having omitted to inquire about her aunt, who (she assured me) in the midst of all her absence of temper, and detachment from common affairs, often talked of me with uncommon warmth. -- I professed my veneration for the good lady, excused my omission, by imputing it to the violence of my love, which engrossed my whole soul, and desired to know the present situation of her health. -- Upon which, the amiable Narcissa repeated what I had heard before, of her marriage, with all the tenderness for her reputation that the subject would admit of; told me, she lived with her husband, hard by, and was so much afflicted with a dropsy, and wasted by a consumption, that she had small hopes of her recovery. -- Having expressed my sorrow for her distemper, I questioned her about my good friend Mrs. Sagely, who I learned (to my great satisfaction) was still in good health, and by the encomiums she bestowed upon me after I was gone, confirmed the favorable impression, my behavior at parting had made on Narcissa's heart -- This circumstance introduced an inquiry into the conduct of Sir Timothy Thicket, who (she informed me) had found means to incense her brother so much against me, that she found it impossible to undeceive him; but on the contrary, suffered very much in her own character, by his scandalous insinuations -- that the whole parish was alarmed, and actually in pursuit of me; so that she had been in the utmost consternation upon my account, well knowing how little my own innocence and her testimony would have weighed with the ignorance, prejudice and brutality of those, who must have judged me, had I been apprehended -- that Sir Timothy being seized with a fit of the apoplexy, from which with great difficulty he was recovered, began to be apprehensive of death, and to prepare himself accordingly for that great event; as a step to which, he sent for her brother, owned with great contrition, the brutal design he had upon her, and of consequence acquitted me of the assault, robbery and correspondence with her, which he had laid to my charge, after which confession he lived about a month in a languishing condition, and was carried off by a second assault.  Every word that this dear creature spoke, rivetted the chains with which she held me enslaved! My mischievous fancy began to work, and the tempest of my passion to wake again; when the return of Freeman destroyed the tempting opportunity, and enabled me to quell the rising tumult. -- A little while after, the Squire staggered into the room, rubbing his eyes, and called for his tea, which he drank out of a small bowl, qualified with brandy; we sipped some in the ordinary way: Narcissa left us in order to visit her aunt, and when Freeman and I proposed to take our leave, the fox-hunter insisted on our spending the evening at his house with such obstinacy of affection, that we were obliged to comply. -- For my own part, I should have been glad of the invitation, by which, in all likelihood, I would be blessed with his sister's company, had I not been afraid of risking her esteem, by entering into a debauch of drinking with him, which, from the knowledge of his character, I foresaw would happen; but there was no remedy -- I was forced to rely upon the strength of my constitution, which I hoped would resist intoxication longer than the Squire's; and to trust to the goodnature and discretion of my mistress for the rest.  Our entertainer resolving to begin by times, ordered the table to be furnished with liquor and glasses immediately after tea, but we absolutely refused to set in for drinking so soon; and prevailed upon him to pass away an hour or two at whist, in which we engaged as soon as Narcissa returned. -- The savage and I happened to be partners at first, and as my thoughts were wholly employed on a more interesting game, I played so ill that he lost all patience, swore bitterly, and threatened to call for wine if they would not grant him another associate. -- This desire was gratified, and Narcissa and I were of a side; he won for the same reason that made him lose before; I was satisfied, my lovely partner did not repine, and the time slipped away very agreeably, until we were told that supper was served in another room.  The Squire was enraged to find the evening so unprofitably spent, and wrecked his vengeance on the cards, which he tore, and committed to the flames with many execrations; threatening to make us redeem our loss with a large glass and a quick circulation; and indeed we had no sooner supped, and my charmer withdrawn, than he began to put his threats in execution. Three bottles of port (for he drank no other sort of wine) were placed before us, with as many water glasses, which were immediately filled to the brim, after his example, by each out of his respective allowance, and emptied in a trice, to the best in christendom. -- Though I swallowed this, and the next as fast as the glass could be replenished, without hesitation or show of reluctance, I perceived that my brain would not be able to bear many bumpers of this sort; and dreading the perseverance of a champion who began with such vigor, I determined to make up for the deficiency of my strength by a stratagem, which I actually put in practice when the second course of bottles was called for. -- The wine being strong and heady, I was already a good deal discomposed by the dispatch we had made, Freeman's eyes began to reel, and Bruin himself was elevated into a song, which he uttered with great vociferation. -- When I therefore saw the second round brought in, I assumed a gay air, entertained him with a French catch on the subject of drinking, which, though he did not understand it, delighted him highly, and telling him that your choice spirits at Paris never troubled themselves with glasses, asked if he had not a bowl or cup in the house that would contain a whole quart of wine. -- "Odds niggers! (cried he) I have a silver caudle-cup that holds just the quantity, for all the world -- fetch it hither, Numps." -- The vessel being produced, I bid him decant his bottle into it, which having done, I nodded in a very deliberate manner, and said, "Pledge you." -- He stared at me for some time, and crying, "What! all at one pull, measter Randan?" -- I answered, "At one pull! Sir, you are no milk-sop -- we shall do you justice." -- "Shall you? (said he, shaking me by the hand) odd then, I Will see it out, an't were a mile to the bottom -- Here Is to our better acquaintance, measter Randan." So saying, he applied it to his lips, and emptied it in a breath. -- I knew the effect of it would be almost instantaneous; therefore, taking the cup, I began to discharge my bottle into it, telling him he was now qualified to drink with the Cham of Tartary. -- I had no sooner pronounced these words, than he took umbrage at them, and after several attempts to spit, made shift to stutter out, "A f -- f -- t for your Chams of T -- Tartary! I am a f -- f -- freeborn Englishman, worth th -- three thousand a year, and v -- value no man, damme!" -- then dropping his jaw, and fixing his eyes, he hick up'd aloud, and fell upon the floor as mute as a flounder. -- Mr. Freeman, heartily rejoiced at his deseat, assisted me in carrying him to bed, where we left him to the care of his servants, and went home to our respective habitations, congratulating one another on our good fortune.
