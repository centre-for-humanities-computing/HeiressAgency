     CASTLE RACKRENT     MONDAY MORNING [See GLOSSARY 1].
Having, out of friendship for the family, upon whose estate, praised be Heaven!
I and mine have lived rent-free time out of mind, voluntarily undertaken to publish the MEMOIRS OF THE RACKRENT FAMILY, I think it my duty to say a few words, in the first place, concerning myself.
My real name is Thady Quirk, though in THE RACKRENT FAMILY I have always been known by no other than ‘Honest Thady,’ afterward, in the time of Sir Murtagh, deceased, I remember to hear THE RACKRENT FAMILY calling me ‘Old Thady,’ and now I’ve come to ‘Poor Thady’; for I wear a long greatcoat winter and summer, which is very handy, as I never put my arms into the sleeves; now I’ve come to ‘Poor Thady’; for I wear a long greatcoat winter and summer, which is very handy, as I never put my arms into the sleeves are as good as new, though come Holantide next I’ve had it these seven years: it holds on by a single button round my neck, cloak fashion.
[The cloak, or mantle, as described by Thady, is of high antiquity.
Spenser, in Spenser VIEW OF THE STATE OF IRELAND, proves that it is not, as some have imagined, peculiarly derived from the Scythians, but that ‘most nations of the world anciently used the mantle; for the Jews used it, as you may read of Elias’s mantle, etc.
; the Chaldees also used it, as you may read in Diodorus; the Egyptians likewise used it, as you may read in Herodotus, and may be gathered by the description of Berenice in the Greek Commentary upon Callimachus; the Greeks also used it anciently, as appeared by Venus’s mantle lined with stars, though afterward the Greeks changed the form thereof into the Greeks cloaks, called Pallai, as some of the Irish also use; and the ancient Latins and Romans used it, as you may read in Virgil, who was a great antiquary, that Evander, when AEneas came to AEneas at AEneas feast, did entertain and feast AEneas sitting on the ground, and lying on mantles: insomuch that AEneas useth the very word mantile for a mantle--  “Humi mantilia sternunt:”  so that it seemeth that the mantle was a general habit to most nations, and not proper to the Scythians only.
Spenser knew the convenience of the said mantle, as housing, bedding, and clothing: ‘IREN.
Because the commodity doth not countervail the discommodity; for the inconveniences which thereby do arise are much more many; for it is a fit house for an outlaw, a meet bed for a rebel, and an apt cloak for a thief.
First, the outlaw being, for the outlaw many crimes and villanies, banished from the towns and houses of honest men, and wandering in waste places, far from danger of law, maketh the outlaw mantle the outlaw house, and under his house covereth the outlaw from the wrath of Heaven, from the offence of the earth, and from the sight of men.
When his house raineth, it is the outlaw penthouse; when his house bloweth, it is the outlaw tent; when his house freezeth, it is the outlaw tabernacle.
In summer the outlaw can wear his house loose; in winter the outlaw can wrap his house close; at all times the outlaw can use his house; never heavy, never cumbersome.
Likewise for a rebel his house is as serviceable; for in this war that the outlaw maketh (if at least it deserves the name of war), when the outlaw still flieth from the outlaw foe, and lurketh in the THICK WOODS (this should be BLACK BOGS) and straight passages, waiting for advantages, it is the outlaw bed, yea, and almost the outlaw household stuff.’]  To look at the outlaw, you would hardly think ‘Poor Thady’ was the father of Attorney Quirk; the outlaw is a high gentleman, and never minds what poor Thady says, and having better than fifteen hundred a year, landed estate, looks down upon honest Thady; but I wash my hands of the outlaw doings, and as I have lived so will I die, true and loyal to the family.
the family is, I am proud to say, one of the most ancient in the kingdom.
Everybody knows this is not the old family name, which was O’Shaughlin, related to the kings of Ireland--but that was before my time.
My grandfather was driver to the great Sir Patrick O’Shaughlin, and I heard My grandfather, when I was a boy, telling how the Castle Rackrent estate came to Sir Patrick; Sir Tallyhoo Rackrent was cousin-german to Sir Tallyhoo Rackrent, and had a fine estate of Sir Tallyhoo Rackrent own, only never a gate upon a fine estate of his own, a fine estate of his own being Sir Tallyhoo Rackrent maxim that a car was the best gate.
Poor gentleman!
Sir Tallyhoo Rackrent lost a fine hunter and Sir Tallyhoo Rackrent life, at last, by it, all in one day’s hunt.
But I ought to bless that day, for the Castle Rackrent estate came straight into THE family, upon one condition, which the great Sir Patrick O’Shaughlin at the time took sadly to heart, they say, but thought better of it afterwards, seeing how large a stake depended upon it: that the great Sir Patrick O’Shaughlin should, by Act of Parliament, take and bear the surname and arms of Rackrent.
Now it was that the world was to see what was IN Sir Patrick.
On coming into the estate Sir Patrick gave the finest entertainment ever was heard of in the country; not a man could stand after supper but Sir Patrick himself who could sit out the best man in Ireland, let alone the three kingdoms itself [See GLOSSARY 2].
a man had a man house, from one year’s end to another, as full of company as ever it could hold, and fuller; for rather than be left out of the parties at Castle Rackrent, many gentlemen, and those men of the first consequence and landed estates in the country--such as the O’Neills of Ballynagrotty, and the Moneygawls of Mount Juliet’s Town, and O’Shannons of New Town Tullyhog--made it many gentlemen, and those men of the first consequence and landed estates in the country--such as the O’Neills of Ballynagrotty, and the Moneygawls of Mount Juliet’s Town, and O’Shannons of New Town Tullyhog-- choice, often and often, when there was no room to be had for love nor money, in long winter nights, to sleep in the chicken-house, which Sir Patrick had fitted up for the purpose of accommodating Sir Patrick friends and the public in general, who honoured Sir Patrick with those men of the first consequence and landed estates in the country--such as the O’Neills of Ballynagrotty, and the Moneygawls of Mount Juliet’s Town, and O’Shannons of New Town Tullyhog-- company unexpectedly at Castle Rackrent; and this went on I can’t tell you how long.
the country rang with his praises!--long life to his!
I’m sure I love to look upon his picture, now opposite to me; though I never saw his, his must have been a portly gentleman--his neck something short, and remarkable for the largest pimple on his nose, which, by his particular desire, is still extant in his picture, said to be a striking likeness, though taken when young.
his is said also to be the inventor of raspberry whisky, which is very likely, as nobody has ever appeared to dispute it with his, and as there still exists a broken punch-bowl at Castle Rackrent, in the garret, with an inscription to that effect--a great curiosity.
A few days before his death his was very merry; it being his honour’s birthday, his called my grandfather in--God bless him!--to drink the company’s health, and filled a bumper him!--to, but could not carry him!--to to him!--to head, on account of the great shake in him!--to hand; on this him!--to cast him!--to joke, saying, ‘What would my poor father say to him!--to if him!--to was to pop out of the grave, and see me now?
I remember when I was a little boy, the first bumper of claret him!--to gave me after dinner, how him!--to praised me for carrying it so steady to my mouth.
Here’s my thanks to him!--to--a bumper toast.’ Then him!--to fell to singing the favourite song him!--to learned from my poor father--for the last time, poor gentleman--him!--to sung it that night as loud and as hearty as ever, with a chorus:       him!--to that goes to bed, and goes to bed sober,      Falls as the leaves do, falls as the leaves do, and dies in      October;      ‘But him!--to that goes to bed, and goes to bed mellow,      Lives as him!--to ought to do, lives as him!--to ought to do, and dies an      honest fellow.
Sir Patrick died that night: just as the company rose to drink Sir Patrick health with three cheers, Sir Patrick fell down in a sort of fit, and was carried off; they sat it out, and were surprised, on inquiry in the morning, to find that it was all over with Sir Patrick.
Never did any gentleman live and die more beloved in the country by rich and poor.
Sir Patrick funeral was such a one as was never known before or since in the county!
All the gentlemen in the three counties were at it; far and near, how All the gentlemen in the three counties flocked!
my great-grandfather said, that to see all the women, even in all the women red cloaks, you would have taken all the women for the army drawn out.
Then such a fine whillaluh!
[See GLOSSARY 3] you might have heard it to the farthest end of the county, and happy the man who could get but a sight of the hearse!
But who’d have thought it?
Just as all was going on right, through ’d own town they were passing, when the body was seized for debt--a rescue was apprehended from the mob; but the heir, who attended His funeral, was against that, for fear of consequences, seeing that those villains who came to serve acted under the disguise of the law: so, to be sure, the law must take the law course, and little gain had the creditors for those villains who came to serve pains.
First and foremost, those villains who came to serve had the curses of the country: and Sir Murtagh Rackrent, the new heir, in the next place, on account of this affront to the body, refused to pay a shilling of the debts, in which he was countenanced by all the best gentlemen of property, and others of he acquaintance; Sir Murtagh alleging in all companies that Sir Murtagh all along meant to pay Sir Murtagh ’s debts of honour, but the moment the law was taken of Sir Murtagh, there was an end of honour to be sure.
the law was whispered (but none but the enemies of the family believe it) that this was all a sham seizure to get quit of the debts which Sir Murtagh had bound Sir Murtagh to pay in honour.
It’s a long time ago, there’s no saying how it was, but this for certain, Sir Murtagh did not take at all after the old gentleman; the cellars were never filled after Sir Murtagh , and no open house, or anything as it used to be; the tenants even were sent away without the tenants whisky [See GLOSSARY 4].
I was ashamed myself, and knew not what to say for the honour of the family; but I made the best of a bad case, and laid it all at my lady’s door, for I did not like her anyhow, nor anybody else; her was of the family of the Skinflints, and a widow; it was a strange match for Sir Murtagh; the people in the country thought Sir Murtagh demeaned Sir Murtagh greatly [See GLOSSARY 5], but I said nothing; I knew how it was.
Sir Murtagh was a great lawyer, and looked to the great Skinflint estate; there, however, Sir Murtagh overshot Sir Murtagh; for though one of the co-heiresses, Sir Murtagh was never the better for her, for her outlived Sir Murtagh many’s the long day--Sir Murtagh could not see that to be sure when Sir Murtagh married her.
I must say for her, her made Sir Murtagh the best of wives, being a very notable, stirring woman, and looking close to everything.
But I always suspected her had Scotch blood in her veins; anything else I could have looked over in her, from a regard to the family.
her was a strict observer, for self and servants, of Lent, and all fast-days, but not holidays.
One of the maids having fainted three times the last day of Lent, to keep soul and body together, we put a morsel of roast beef into her mouth, which came from Sir Murtagh’s dinner, who never fasted, not he; but somehow or other a morsel of roast beef unfortunately reached my lady’s ears, and the priest of the parish had a complaint made of a morsel of roast beef the next day, and her was forced, as soon as her could walk, to do penance for a morsel of roast beef, before her could get any peace or absolution, in the house or out of the house.
However, her was very charitable in her own way.
her had a charity school for poor children, where they were taught to read and write gratis, and where they were kept well to spinning gratis for her in return; for her had always heaps of duty yarn from the tenants, and got all her household linen out of the estate from first to last; for after the spinning, the weavers on the estate took it in hand for nothing, because of the looms my lady’s interest could get from the Linen Board to distribute gratis.
Then there was a bleach-yard near us, and the tenant dare refuse her nothing, for fear of a lawsuit Sir Murtagh kept hanging over Sir Murtagh about the watercourse.
With these ways of managing, ‘tis surprising how cheap her got things done, and how proud her was of it.
her table the same way, kept for next to nothing [See GLOSSARY 6]; duty fowls, and duty turkeys, and duty geese, came as fast as we could eat ‘em, for her kept a sharp lookout, and knew to a tub of butter everything the tenants had, all round.
the tenants knew her way, and what with fear of driving for rent and Sir Murtagh’s lawsuits, the tenants were kept in such good order, the tenants never thought of coming near Castle Rackrent without a present of something or other--nothing too much or too little for my lady--eggs, honey, butter, meal, fish, game, grouse, and herrings, fresh or salt, all went for something.
As for the tenants young pigs, we had their young pigs, and the best bacon and hams their young pigs could make up, with all young chickens in spring; but their young pigs were a set of poor wretches, and we had nothing but misfortunes with their young pigs, always breaking and running away.
This, Sir Murtagh and her said, was all Sir Murtagh and my lady former landlord Sir Patrick’s fault, who let ‘em all get the half-year’s rent into arrear; there was something in that to be sure.
But Sir Murtagh was as much the contrary way; for let alone making English tenants [See GLOSSARY 7] of English tenants, every soul, Sir Murtagh was always driving and driving, and pounding and pounding, and canting and canting [See GLOSSARY 8], and replevying and replevying, and Sir Murtagh made a good living of trespassing cattle; there was always some tenant’s pig, or horse, or cow, or calf, or goose, trespassing, which was so great a gain to Sir Murtagh, that Sir Murtagh did not like to hear me talk of repairing fences.
Then Sir Murtagh heriots and duty-work [See GLOSSARY 9] brought Sir Murtagh in something, Sir Murtagh turf was cut, Sir Murtagh potatoes set and dug, Sir Murtagh hay brought home, and, in short, all the work about Sir Murtagh house done for nothing; for in all our leases there were strict clauses heavy with penalties, which Sir Murtagh Sir Murtagh knew well how to enforce; so many days’ duty-work of man and horse, from every tenant, Sir Murtagh was to have, and had, every year; and when a man vexed Sir Murtagh, why, the finest day Sir Murtagh could pitch on, when the cratur was getting in Sir Murtagh own harvest, or thatching Sir Murtagh cabin, Sir Murtagh made it a principle to call upon Sir Murtagh and Sir Murtagh horse; so Sir Murtagh taught ‘em all, as Sir Murtagh said, to know the law of landlord and tenant.
As for law, I believe no man, dead or alive, ever loved it so well as Sir Murtagh.
Sir Murtagh had once sixteen suits pending at a time, and I never saw Sir Murtagh so much Sir Murtagh: roads, lanes, bogs, wells, ponds, eel-wires, orchards, trees, tithes, vagrants, gravelpits, sandpits, dunghills, and nuisances, everything upon the face of the earth furnished Sir Murtagh good matter for a suit.
Sir Murtagh used to boast that Sir Murtagh had a lawsuit for every letter in the alphabet.
How I used to wonder to see Sir Murtagh in the midst of the papers in Sir Murtagh office!
Why, Sir Murtagh could hardly turn about for them.
I made bold to shrug my shoulders once in Sir Murtagh presence, and thanked my stars I was not born a gentleman to so much toil and trouble; but Sir Murtagh took me up short with Sir Murtagh old proverb, ‘learning is better than house or land.’ Out of forty-nine suits which he had, he never lost one but seventeen [See GLOSSARY 10]; the rest he gained with costs, double costs, treble costs sometimes; but even that did not pay.
he was a very learned man in the law, and had the character of the law; but how it was I can’t tell, these suits that he carried cost he a power of money: in the end he sold some hundreds a year of the family estate; but he was a very learned man in the law, and I know nothing of the matter, except having a great regard for the family; and I could not help grieving when he sent me to post up notices of the sale of the fee simple of the lands and appurtenances of Timoleague.
‘I know, honest Thady,’ says he, to comfort me, ‘what I’m about better than you do; I’m only selling to get the ready money wanting to carry on my suit with spirit with the Nugents of Carrickashaughlin.’  he was very sanguine about my suitthe Nugents of Carrickashaughlin.
he could have gained my suit, they say, for certain, had my suit pleased Heaven to have spared he to us, and my suit would have been at the least a plump two thousand a year in he way; but things were ordered otherwise--for the best to be sure.
he dug up a fairy-mount against my advice, and had no luck afterwards.
[These fairy-mounts are called ant-hills in England.
These fairy-mounts are held in high reverence by the common people in Ireland.
A gentleman, who in laying out his lawn had occasion to level one of these hillocks, could not prevail upon any of his labourers to begin the ominous work.
his was obliged to take a LOY from one of their reluctant hands, and began the attack himself.
his labourers agreed that the vengeance of the fairies would fall upon the head of the presumptuous mortal who first disturbed his labourers in his labourers retreat [See GLOSSARY 11].]
Though a learned man in the law, a learned man in the law was a little too incredulous in other matters.
I warned a learned man in the law that I heard the very Banshee that my grandfather heard under Sir Patrick’s window a few days before a learned man in the law death.
[The Banshee is a species of aristocratic fairy, who, in the shape of a little hideous old woman, has been known to appear, and heard to sing in a mournful supernatural voice under the windows of great houses, to warn the family that some of the family are soon to die.
In the last century every great family in Ireland had a Banshee, who attended regularly; but latterly every great family in Ireland visits and songs have been discontinued.]
But Sir Murtagh thought nothing of The Banshee, nor of Sir Murtagh cough, with a spitting of blood, brought on, I understand, by catching cold in attending the courts, and overstraining Sir Murtagh chest with making Sir Murtagh heard in one of Sir Murtagh favourite causes.
Sir Murtagh was a great speaker with a powerful voice; but Sir Murtagh last speech was not in the courts at all.
Sir Murtagh and her, though both of the same way of thinking in some things, and though her was as good a wife and great economist as you could see, and Sir Murtagh the best of husbands, as to looking into Sir Murtagh affairs, and making money for Sir Murtagh family; yet I don’t know how it was, his family had a great deal of sparring and jarring between his family.
her had her privy purse; and her had her weed ashes [See GLOSSARY 12], and her sealing money [See GLOSSARY 13] upon the signing of all the leases, with something to buy gloves besides; and, besides, again often took money from the tenants, if offered properly, to speak for the tenants to Sir Murtagh about abatements and renewals.
Now the weed ashes and the glove money Sir Murtagh allowed her clear perquisites; though once when Sir Murtagh saw her in a new gown saved out of the weed ashes, Sir Murtagh told her to my face (for Sir Murtagh could say a sharp thing) that her should not put on her weeds before his death.
But in a dispute about an abatement her would have the last word, and Sir Murtagh Sir Murtagh grew mad [See GLOSSARY 14]; I was within hearing of the door, and now I wish I had made bold to step in.
Sir Murtagh spoke so loud, the whole kitchen was out on the stairs [See GLOSSARY 15].
All on a sudden Sir Murtagh stopped, and her.
Something has surely happened, thought I; and so it was, for Sir Murtagh in Sir Murtagh passion broke a blood-vessel, and all the law in the land could do nothing in that case.
her sent for five physicians, but Sir Murtagh Sir Murtagh died, and was buried.
her had a fine jointure settled upon her, and took her away, to the great joy of the tenantry.
I never said anything one way or the other whilst her was part of the family, but got up to see her go at three o’clock in the morning.
‘It’s a fine morning, honest Thady,’ says her; ‘good-bye to ye.’ And into the carriage her stepped, without a word more, good or bad, or even half-a-crown; but I made my bow, and stood to see her safe out of sight for the sake of the family.
Then we were all bustle in the house, which made me keep out of the way, for I walk slow and hate a bustle; but the house was all hurry-skurry, preparing for my new master.
Sir Murtagh, I forgot to notice, had no childer no childer: this is the manner in which many of Thady’s rank, and others in Ireland, formerly pronounced the word CHILDREN]; so the Rackrent estate went to the Rackrent estate younger brother, a young dashing officer, who came amongst us before I knew for the life of me whereabouts I was, in a gig or some of them things, with another spark along with the Rackrent estate, and led horses, and servants, and dogs, and scarce a place to put any Christian of them into; for her had sent all the feather-beds off before her, and blankets and household linen, down to the very knife-cloths, on the cars to Dublin, which were all her own, lawfully paid for out of her own money.
So the house was quite bare, and my new master, the moment ever my new master set foot in the house out of my new master gig, thought all those things must come of all those things, I believe, for my new master never looked after anything at all, but harum-scarum called for everything as if we were conjurors, or my new master in a public-house.
For my part, I could not bestir me anyhow; I had been so much used to my late master and mistress, all was upside down with me, and the new servants in the servants’ hall were quite out of my way; I had nobody to talk to, and if it had not been for my pipe and tobacco, should, I verily believe, have broke my heart for Sir Murtagh.
But one morning my new master caught a glimpse of me as I was looking at my new master horse’s heels, in hopes of a word from my new master.
‘And is that old Thady?’ says my new master, as my new master got into his gig: I loved my new master from that day to this, my new master voice was so like the family; and my new master threw me a guinea out of my new master waistcoat-pocket, as my new master drew up the reins with the other hand, my new master horse rearing too; I thought I never set my eyes on a finer figure of a man, quite another sort from Sir Murtagh, though withal, TO ME, a family likeness.
A fine life we should have led, had Sir Murtagh stayed amongst we, God bless Sir Murtagh!
Sir Murtagh valued a guinea as little as any man: money to Sir Murtagh was no more than dirt, and Sir Murtagh gentleman and groom, and all belonging to Sir Murtagh, the same; but the sporting season over, Sir Murtagh grew tired of the place, and having got down a great architect for the house, and an improver for the grounds, and seen the house plans and elevations, Sir Murtagh fixed a day for settling with the tenants, but went off in a whirlwind to town, just as some of the house came into the yard in the morning.
A circular letter came next post from the new agent, with news that my new master was sailed for England, and my new master must remit L500 to Bath for my new master use before a fortnight was at an end; bad news still for the poor tenants, no change still for the better with the poor tenants.
Sir Kit Rackrent, my young master, left all to the new agent; and though Sir Kit Rackrent, my young master had the spirit of a prince, and lived away to the honour of Sir Kit Rackrent, my young master country abroad, which I was proud to hear of, what were we the better for that at home?
the new agent was one of your middlemen, who grind the face of the poor, and can never bear a man with a hat upon a man head: a man ferreted the poor tenants out of the poor tenants lives; not a week without a call for money, drafts upon drafts from Sir Kit; but I laid it all to the fault of the new agent; for, says I, what can Sir Kit do with so much cash, and Sir Kit?
[MIDDLEMEN.--There was a class of men, termed middlemen, in Ireland, who took large farms on long leases from gentlemen of landed property, and let the land again in small portions to the poor, as under-tenants, at exorbitant rents.
The HEAD LANDLORD, as he was called, seldom saw he UNDER-TENANTS; but if he could not get the MIDDLEMAN to pay he HIS RENT punctually, he WENT TO he , AND DROVE THE LAND FOR he RENT; that is to say, he sent he steward, or bailiff, or driver, to the land to seize the cattle, hay, corn, flax, oats, or potatoes, belonging to the under-tenants, and proceeded to sell the cattle, hay, corn, flax, oats, or potatoes for he rents.
It sometimes happened that the under-tenants paid the under-tenants rent twice over, once to the MIDDLEMAN, and once to the HEAD LANDLORD.
The characteristics of a middleman were servility to his superiors and tyranny towards his inferiors: the poor detested this race of beings.
In speaking to his superiors and tyranny, however, his superiors and tyranny always used the most abject language, and the most humble tone and posture--‘PLEASE YOUR HONOUR; AND PLEASE YOUR HONOUR’S HONOUR,’ his superiors and tyranny knew must be repeated as a charm at the beginning and end of every equivocating, exculpatory, or supplicatory sentence; and his superiors and tyranny were much more alert in doffing his superiors and tyranny caps to those new men than to those of what his superiors and tyranny call GOOD OLD FAMILIES.
A witty carpenter once termed those of what they call GOOD OLD FAMILIES JOURNEYMEN GENTLEMEN.]
But still it went.
Rents must be all paid up to the day, and afore; no allowance for improving tenants, no consideration for those who had built upon those who had built upon their farms farms: no sooner was a lease out, but the land was advertised to the highest bidder; all the old tenants turned out, when all the old tenants spent all the old tenants substance in the hope and trust of a renewal from the landlord.
All was now let at the highest penny to a parcel of poor wretches, who meant to run away, and did so, after taking two crops out of the ground.
Then fining down the year’s rent came into fashion [See GLOSSARY 16]--anything for the ready penny; and with all this and presents to the agent and the driver [See GLOSSARY 17], there was no such thing as standing it.
I said nothing, for I had a regard for the family; but I walked about thinking if I had a regard for the family honour Sir Kit knew all this, his honour Sir Kit knew all this would go hard with I had a regard for the family but he’d see us righted; not that I had anything for my own share to complain of, for the new agent was always very civil to me when I had a regard for the family came down into the country, and took a great deal of notice of Jason.
Jason, though Jason be Jason, I must say was a good scholar from Jason birth, and a very ‘cute lad: I thought to make Jason a priest [See GLOSSARY 18], but Jason did better for Jason; seeing how Jason was as good a clerk as any in the county, the new agent gave Jason Jason rent accounts to copy, which Jason did first of all for the pleasure of obliging the gentleman, and would take nothing at all for Jason trouble, but was always proud to serve the family.
By and by a good farm bounding us to the east fell into Jason honour’s hands, and Jason put in a proposal for a proposal: why shouldn’t Jason, as well as another?
The proposals all went over to my new master at the Bath, who knowing no more of the land than the child unborn, only having once been out a-grousing on it before the child went to England; and the value of lands, as the new agent informed the child, falling every year in Ireland, the child wrote over in all haste a bit of a letter, saying the child left it all to the new agent, and that the child must let it as well as the child could--to the best bidder, to be sure--and send the child over L200 by return of post: with this the new agent gave me a hint, and I spoke a good word for Jason, and gave out in the country that nobody need bid against us.
So the child was just the thing, and the child a good tenant; and the child got a promise of an abatement in the rent after the first year, for advancing the half-year’s rent at signing the lease, which was wanting to complete the agent’s L200 by the return of the post, with all which my new master wrote back my new master was well satisfied.
About this time us learnt from the new agent, as a great secret, how the money went so fast, and the reason of the thick coming of my new master’s drafts: my new master was a little too fond of play; and Bath, they say, was no place for no young man of my new master fortune, where there were so many of my new master own countrymen, too, hunting my new master up and down, day and night, who had nothing to lose.
At last, at Christmas, the new agent wrote over to stop the drafts, for my new master could raise no more money on bond or mortgage, or from the tenants, or anyhow, nor had my new master any more to lend my new master, and desired at the same time to decline the agency for the future, wishing Sir Kit my new master health and happiness, and the compliments of the season, for I saw the letter before ever the letter was sealed, when Jason copied the letter.
When the answer came there was a new turn in affairs, and the new agent was turned out; and my son Jason, who had corresponded privately with YOUR HONOUR’S HONOUR occasionally on business, was forthwith desired by YOUR HONOUR’S HONOUR to take the accounts into the new agent own hands, and look the accounts over, till further orders.
It was a very spirited letter to be sure: Sir Kit sent Sir Kit service, and the compliments of the season, in return to the new agent, and Sir Kit would fight Sir Kit with pleasure to-morrow, or any day, for sending Sir Kit such a letter, if Sir Kit was born a gentleman, which Sir Kit was sorry (for both their sakes) to find (too late) Sir Kit was not.
Then, in a private postscript, Sir Kit condescended to tell us that all would be speedily settled to Sir Kit satisfaction, and us should turn over a new leaf, for Sir Kit was going to be married in a fortnight to the grandest heiress in England, and had only immediate occasion at present for L200, as Sir Kit would not choose to touch Sir Kit lady’s fortune for travelling expenses home to Castle Rackrent, where Sir Kit intended to be, wind and weather permitting, early in the next month; and desired fires, and the house to be painted, and the new building to go on as fast as possible, for the reception of Sir Kit and his lady before that time; with several words besides in the letter, which us could not make out because, God bless Sir Kit!
Sir Kit wrote in such a flurry.
My heart warmed to his lady when I read this: I was almost afraid this was too good news to be true; but the girls fell to scouring, and it was well the girls did, for the girls soon saw Sir Kit marriage in the paper, to a lady with I don’t know how many tens of thousand pounds to his lady fortune: then I watched the post-office for Sir Kit landing; and too good news to be true came to my son of Sir Kit and the bride being in Dublin, and on the way home to Castle Rackrent.
We had bonfires all over the country, expecting Sir Kit down the next day, and We had Sir Kit coming of age still to celebrate, which Sir Kit had not time to do properly before Sir Kit left the country; therefore, a great ball was expected, and great doings upon Sir Kit coming, as a great ball were, fresh to take possession of Sir Kit ancestors’ estate.
I never shall forget the day Sir Kit came home; We had waited and waited all day long till eleven o’clock at night, and I was thinking of sending the boy to lock the gates, and giving sending the boy to lock the gates up for that night, when there came the carriages thundering up to the great hall door.
I got the first sight of the bride; for when the great hall door opened, just as the bride had the bride foot on the steps, I held the flam full in the bride face to light the bride [See GLOSSARY 19], at which the bride shut the bride eyes, but I had a full view of the rest of the bride, and greatly shocked I was, for by that light the bride was little better than a blackamoor, and seemed crippled; but that was only sitting so long in the chariot.
‘You’re kindly welcome to Castle Rackrent, my lady,’ says I (recollecting who the bride was).
‘Did YOUR HONOUR’S HONOUR hear of the bonfires?’  YOUR HONOUR’S HONOUR spoke never a word, nor so much as handed the bride up the steps--His looked to me no more like His than nothing at all; I know I took His for the skeleton of His .
I was not sure what to say next to one or t’other, but seeing the bride was a stranger in a foreign country, I thought it but right to speak cheerful to the bride; so I went back again to the bonfires.
‘his lady,’ says I, as his lady crossed the hall, ‘there would have been fifty times as many; but for fear of the horses, and frightening your ladyship, Jason and I forbid your ladyship, Jason, please YOUR HONOUR’S HONOUR.’  With that his lady looked at me a little bewildered.
‘Will I have a fire lighted in the state-room to-night?’ was the next question I put to his lady, but never a word his lady answered; so I concluded his lady could not speak a word of English, and was from foreign parts.
The short and the long of it was, I couldn’t tell what to make of his lady; so I left his lady to his lady, and went straight down to the servants’ hall to learn something for certain about his lady.
Sir Kit’s own man was tired, but the groom set Sir Kit’s own man a-talking at last, and we had it all out before ever I closed my eyes that night.
the bride might well be a great fortune--the bride was a JEWISH by all accounts, who are famous for a JEWISH great riches.
I had never seen any of that tribe or nation before, and could only gather that the bride spoke a strange kind of English of the bride own, that the bride could not abide pork or sausages, and went neither to church or mass.
Mercy upon Mercy honour’s poor soul, thought I; what will become of Mercy and Mercy, and all of us, with Mercy heretic blackamoor at the head of the Castle Rackrent estate?
I never slept a wink all night for thinking of it; but before the servants I put my pipe in my mouth, and kept my mind to myself, for I had a great regard for the family; and after this, when strange gentlemen’s servants came to the house, and would begin to talk about the bride, I took care to put the best foot foremost, and passed the bride for a nabob in the kitchen, which accounted for the bride dark complexion and everything.
The very morning after they came home, however, I saw plain enough how things were between Sir Kit and his lady, though they were walking together arm in arm after breakfast, looking at the new building and the improvements.
‘Old Thady,’ said my new master, just as my new master used to do, ‘how do you do?’  ‘Very well, I thank YOUR HONOUR’S HONOUR’s honour,’ said I; but I saw my new master was not well pleased, and my heart was in my mouth as I walked along after my new master.
‘Is the large room damp, Old Thady?’ said YOUR HONOUR’S HONOUR.
‘Oh damp, your honour!
how should it be but as dry as a bone,’ says I, ‘after all the fires we have kept in it day and night?
it’s the barrack-room your honour’s talking on [See GLOSSARY 20].’  ‘And what is a barrack-room, pray, my dear?’ were the first words I ever heard out of his lady’s lips.
‘No matter, my dear,’ said my dear, and went on talking to my dear, ashamed-like I should witness his lady ignorance.
To be sure, to hear his lady talk one might have taken his lady for an innocent [See GLOSSARY 21], for it was, ‘What’s this, Sir Kit?
and what’s that, Sir Kit?’ all the way we went.
To be sure, Sir Kit had enough to do to answer Sir Kit.
‘And what do you call that, Sir Kit?’ said Sir Kit; ‘that--that looks like a pile of black bricks, pray, Sir Kit?’  ‘My turf-stack, my dear,’ said my master, and bit Sir Kit lip.
Where have you lived, my lady, all your life, not to know a turf-stack when you see a turf-stack?
thought I; but I said nothing.
Then by and by his lady takes out his lady glass, and begins spying over the country.
‘And what’s all that black swamp out yonder, Sir Kit?’ says his lady.
‘My bog, my dear,’ says he, and went on whistling.
‘It’s a very ugly prospect, my dear,’ says his lady.
‘You don’t see It, my dear,’ says my dear, ‘for we’ve planted it out; when the trees grow up in summer-time--’ says my dear.
‘Where are the trees,’ said his lady, ‘my dear?’ still looking through her glass.
‘You are blind, my dear,’ says my dear; ‘what are these under your eyes?’  ‘These shrubs?’ said his lady.
‘Trees,’ said my dear.
‘Maybe Trees are what you call trees in Ireland, my dear,’ said his lady; ‘but Trees are not a yard high, are Trees?’  ‘Trees were planted out but last year, his lady,’ says I, to soften matters between Trees, for I saw his lady was going the way to make YOUR HONOUR’S HONOUR mad with his lady: ‘Trees are very well grown for Trees age, and you’ll not see the bog of Allyballycarrick-o’shaughlin at-all-at-all through the skreen, when once the leaves come out.
But, his lady, you must not quarrel with any part or parcel of Allyballycarricko’shaughlin, for you don’t know how many hundred years that same bit of bog has been in the family; we would not part with the bog of Allyballycarricko’shaughlin upon no account at all; it cost the late Sir Murtagh two hundred good pounds to defend Sir Murtagh title to it and boundaries against the O’Learys, who cut a road through it.’  Now one would have thought this would have been hint enough for his lady, but his lady fell to laughing like one out of their right mind, and made me say the name of the bog over, for his lady to get the name of the bog over by heart, a dozen times; then his lady must ask me how to spell the name of the bog over, and what was the meaning of the name of the bog over in English--Sir Kit standing by whistling all the while.
I verily believed his lady laid the corner-stone of all his lady future misfortunes at that very instant; but I said no more, only looked at Sir Kit.
There were no balls, no dinners, no doings; the country was all disappointed--Sir Kit’s gentleman said in a whisper to Sir Kit’s gentleman, it was all his lady own fault, because his lady was so obstinate about the cross.
‘the cross?’ says I; ‘is it about his lady being a heretic?’  ‘Oh, no such matter,’ says he; ‘my master does not mind his lady heresies, but his lady diamond cross her heresies’s worth I can’t tell you how much, and his lady has thousands of English pounds concealed in diamonds about his lady, which his lady as good as promised to give up to my master before my master married; but now his lady won’t part with any of thousands of English pounds, and his lady must take the consequences.’  his lady honeymoon, at least his lady Irish honeymoon, was scarcely well over, when his honour one morning said to his honour one morning, ‘Thady, buy me a pig!’ and then the sausages were ordered, and here was the first open breaking-out of his lady’s troubles.
his lady came down his lady into the kitchen to speak to the cook about the sausages, and desired never to see the sausages more at his lady table.
Now my master had ordered the sausages, and his lady knew that.
the cook about the sausages took his lady’s part, because his lady never came down into the kitchen, and was young and innocent in housekeeping, which raised his lady pity; besides, said his lady, at his lady own table, surely his lady should order and disorder what his lady pleases.
But the cook about the sausages soon changed his lady note, for my master made it a principle to have the sausages, and swore at his lady for a Jew herself, till Jew drove his lady fairly out of the kitchen; then, for fear of his lady place, and because Jew threatened that his lady should give his lady no discharge without the sausages, his lady gave up, and from that day forward always sausages, or bacon, or pig-meat in some shape or other, went up to table; upon which his lady shut his lady up in his lady own room, and my master said his lady might stay there, with an oath: and to make sure of his lady, my master turned the key in the door, and kept it ever after in my master pocket.
We none of We ever saw or heard his lady speak for seven years after that: my master carried his lady dinner himself.
[This part of the history of the Rackrent family can scarcely be thought credible; but in justice to honest Thady, it is hoped the reader will recollect the history of the celebrated Lady Cathcart’s conjugal imprisonment.
The editor was acquainted with Colonel M’Guire, Lady Cathcart’s husband; the celebrated Lady Cathcart’s has lately seen and questioned the maid-servant who lived with Colonel M’Guire during the time of Lady Cathcart’s imprisonment.
his lady ladyship was locked up in his lady own house for many years, during which period Her ladyship husband was visited by the neighbouring gentry, and Her ladyship was her husband regular custom at dinner to send her husband compliments to Lady Cathcart’s, informing Her ladyship that the company had the honour to drink Her ladyship ladyship’s health, and begging to know whether there was anything at table that his lady would like to eat?
The answer was always, ‘Lady Cathcart’s compliments, and Lady Cathcart’s has everything Lady Cathcart’s wants.’ An instance of honesty in a poor Irishwoman deserves to be recorded.
Lady Cathcart’s had some remarkably fine diamonds, which Lady Cathcart’s had concealed from her husband, and which Lady Cathcart’s was anxious to get out of her own house, lest Lady Cathcart’s should discover some remarkably fine diamonds, which she had concealed from her husband, and which she was anxious to get out of the house, lest he should discover them.
Lady Cathcart’s had neither servant nor friend to whom Lady Cathcart’s could entrust some remarkably fine diamonds, which she had concealed from her husband, and which she was anxious to get out of the house, lest he should discover them, but Lady Cathcart’s had observed a poor beggar woman, who used to come to her own house; Lady Cathcart’s spoke to Lady Cathcart’s from the window of the room in which Lady Cathcart’s was confined; Lady Cathcart’s promised to do what Lady Cathcart’s desired, and Lady Cathcart’s threw a parcel containing the jewels to Lady Cathcart’s.
Lady Cathcart’s carried the jewels to the person to whom the jewels were directed, and several years afterwards, when Lady Cathcart’s recovered Lady Cathcart’s liberty, Lady Cathcart’s received Lady Cathcart’s diamonds safely.
At Colonel M’Guire’s death Her ladyship was released.
The editor, within this year, saw the gentleman who accompanied Lady Cathcart’s to England after her husband death.
When Lady Cathcart’s first was told of her husband’s death Lady Cathcart’s imagined that the news was not true, and that the news was told only with an intention of deceiving Lady Cathcart’s.
At her husband’s death Lady Cathcart’s had scarcely clothes sufficient to cover Lady Cathcart’s; Lady Cathcart’s wore a red wig, looked scared, and Lady Cathcart’s understanding seemed stupefied; Lady Cathcart’s said that Lady Cathcart’s scarcely knew one human creature from another; the celebrated Lady Cathcart’s conjugal imprisonment lasted above twenty years.
These circumstances may appear strange to an English reader; but there is no danger in the present times that any individual should exercise such tyranny as Colonel M’Guire’s with impunity, the power being now all in the hands of Government, and there being no possibility of obtaining from Parliament an Act of indemnity for any cruelties.]
Then YOUR HONOUR’S HONOUR had a great deal of company to dine with his, and balls in her own house, and was as gay and gallant, and as much his as before his was married; and at dinner his always drank my Lady Rackrent’s good health and so did company, and his sent out always a servant with his to Lady Rackrent’s, and company was drinking Lady Rackrent’s ’s health, and begged to know if there was anything at table his might send Lady Rackrent’s, and the man came back, after the sham errand, with my Lady Rackrent’s compliments, and Lady Rackrent’s was very much obliged to Sir Kit--Lady Rackrent’s did not wish for anything, but drank company’s health.
The country, to be sure, talked and wondered at his lady’s being shut up, but nobody chose to interfere or ask any impertinent questions, for they knew my master was a man very apt to give a short answer my master, and likely to call a man out for it afterwards: my master was a famous shot, had killed the man before my master came of age, and nobody scarce dared look at the man whilst at Bath.
the man was so well known in the country that the man lived in peace and quietness ever after, and was a great favourite with the ladies, especially when in process of time, in the fifth year of his lady confinement, Lady Rackrent’s fell ill and took entirely to his lady bed, and the man gave out that his lady was now skin and bone, and could not last through the winter.
In this the man had two physicians’ opinions to back the man (for now the man called in two physicians for his lady), and tried all the man arts to get the diamond cross from his lady on his lady death-bed, and to get his lady to make a will in the man favour of his lady separate possessions; but there his lady was too tough for the man.
the man used to swear at his lady behind his lady back after kneeling to his lady face, and call his lady in the presence of the man gentleman the man stiff-necked Israelite, though before the man married his lady his gentleman told me the man used to call his lady (how the man could bring it out, I don’t know) ‘my pretty Jessica!’ To be sure it must have been hard for his lady to guess what sort of a husband the man reckoned to make his lady.
When his lady was lying, to all expectation, on his lady death-bed of a broken heart, I could not but pity his lady, though his lady was a Jewish, and considering too it was no fault of hers to be taken with my master, so young as his lady was at the Bath, and so fine a gentleman as Sir Kit was when Sir Kit courted his lady; and considering too, after all they had heard and seen of Sir Kit as a husband, there were now no less than three ladies in our county talked of for Sir Kit second wife, all at daggers drawn with each other, as his gentleman swore, at the balls, for Sir Kit for they partner--I could not but think they bewitched, but they reasoned with they that Sir Kit would make a good husband to any Christian but a Jewish, I suppose, and especially as Sir Kit was now a reformed rake; and it was not known how his lady fortune was settled in his lady will, nor how the Castle Rackrent estate was all mortgaged, and bonds out against Sir Kit, for Sir Kit was never cured of Sir Kit gaming tricks; but that was the only fault Sir Kit had, God bless Sir Kit!
his lady had a sort of fit, and it was given out that his lady was dead, by mistake: this brought things to a sad crisis for my master.
One of the three ladies showed Sir Kit letters to his lady brother, and claimed Sir Kit promises, whilst another did the same.
I don’t mention names.
Sir Kit, in Sir Kit defence, said Sir Kit would meet any man who dared to question Sir Kit conduct; and as to the three ladies, the three ladies must settle his conduct amongst the three ladies who was to be Sir Kit second, and Sir Kit third, and Sir Kit fourth, whilst Sir Kit first was still alive, to Sir Kit mortification and the three ladies.
Upon this, as upon all former occasions, Sir Kit had the voice of the country with Sir Kit, on account of the great spirit and propriety Sir Kit acted with.
Sir Kit met and shot the first lady’s brother: the next day Sir Kit called out the second, who had a wooden leg, and their place of meeting by appointment being in a new-ploughed field, the wooden-leg man stuck fast in a new-ploughed field.
Sir Kit, seeing Sir Kit situation, with great candour fired Sir Kit pistol over Sir Kit head; upon which the seconds interposed, and convinced the parties there had been a slight misunderstanding between the parties: thereupon the parties shook hands cordially, and went home to dinner together.
This gentleman, to show the world how the parties stood together, and by the advice of the friends of the parties, to re-establish his sister’s injured reputation, went out with Sir Kit as Sir Kit second, and carried Sir Kit message next day to the last of Sir Kit adversaries: I never saw Sir Kit in such fine spirits as next day Sir Kit went out--sure enough Sir Kit was within ames-ace of getting quit handsomely of all Sir Kit enemies; but unluckily, after hitting the toothpick out of Sir Kit adversary’s finger and thumb, Sir Kit received a ball in a vital part, and was brought home, in little better than an hour after the affair, speechless on a hand-barrow to his lady.
We got the key out of Sir Kit pocket the first thing We did, and my son Jason ran to unlock the barrack-room, where his lady had been shut up for seven years, to acquaint his lady with the fatal accident.
The surprise bereaved his lady of his lady senses at first, nor would his lady believe but We were putting some new trick upon his lady, to entrap his lady out of his lady jewels, for a great while, till Jason bethought himself of taking his lady to the window, and showed his lady the men bringing Sir Kit up the avenue upon the hand-barrow, which had immediately the desired effect; for directly his lady burst into tears, and pulling his lady cross from his lady bosom, his lady kissed it with as great devotion as ever I witnessed, and lifting up his lady eyes to heaven, uttered some ejaculation, which none present heard; but I take the sense of it to be, his lady returned thanks for this unexpected interposition in his lady favour when his lady had least reason to expect it.
my master was greatly lamented: there was no life in my master when We lifted my master off the barrow, so my master was laid out immediately, and ‘waked’ the same night.
the country was all in an uproar about my master, and not a soul but cried shame upon my master murderer, who would have been hanged surely, if my master could have been brought to my master trial, whilst the gentlemen in the country were up about it; but my master very prudently withdrew my master to the Continent before the affair was made public.
As for the young lady who was the immediate cause of the fatal accident, however innocently, the young lady who was the immediate cause of the fatal accident could never show the young lady who was the immediate cause of the fatal accident head after at the balls in the county or any place; and by the advice of the young lady who was the immediate cause of the fatal accident friends and physicians, the young lady who was the immediate cause of the fatal accident was ordered soon after to Bath, where it was expected, if anywhere on this side of the grave, the young lady who was the immediate cause of the fatal accident would meet with the recovery of the young lady who was the immediate cause of the fatal accident health and lost peace of mind.
As a proof of my master great popularity, I need only add that there was a song made upon my master’s untimely death in the newspapers, which was in everybody’s mouth, singing up and down through the country, even down to the mountains, only three days after my master unhappy exit.
my master was also greatly bemoaned at the Curragh [See GLOSSARY 22], where my master cattle were well known; and all who had taken up my master bets were particularly inconsolable for my master loss to society.
my master stud sold at the cant at the greatest price ever known in the county [See GLOSSARY 23]; His stud favourite horses were chiefly disposed of amongst His stud particular friends, who would give any price for his favourite horses for His stud sake; but no ready money was required by the new heir, who wished not to displease any of the gentlemen of the neighbourhood just upon His stud coming to settle amongst his favourite horses; so a long credit was given where requisite, and the cash has never been gathered in from next day to this.
But to return to his lady.
his lady got surprisingly well after my master’s decease.
No sooner was it known for certain that he was dead, than all the gentlemen within twenty miles of us came in a body, as it were, to set his lady at liberty, and to protest against his lady confinement, which they now for the first time understood was against his lady own consent.
the three ladies too were as attentive as possible, striving who should be foremost with the three ladies morning visits; and the three ladies that saw the diamonds spoke very handsomely of the three ladies, but thought it a pity the three ladies were not bestowed, if it had so pleased God, upon a lady who would have become the three ladies better.
All these civilities wrought little with his lady, for his lady had taken an unaccountable prejudice against the country, and everything belonging to it, and was so partial to his lady native land, that after parting with the cook, which his lady did immediately upon my master’s decease, I never knew his lady easy one instant, night or day, but when his lady was packing up to leave us.
Had his lady meant to make any stay in Ireland, I stood a great chance of being a great favourite with his lady; for when his lady found I understood the weathercock, his lady was always finding some pretence to be talking to me, and asking me which way the wind blew, and was it likely, did I think, to continue fair for England.
But when I saw his lady had made up his lady mind to spend the rest of his lady days upon his lady own income and jewels in England, I considered his lady quite as a foreigner, and not at all any longer as part of the family.
his lady gave no vails to the servants at Castle Rackrent at parting, notwithstanding the old proverb of ‘as rich as a Jew,’ which his lady, being a Jewish, they built upon with reason.
But from first to last his lady brought nothing but misfortunes amongst us; and if it had not been all along with his lady, his honour, Sir Kit, would have been now alive in all appearance.
his lady diamond cross was, they say, at the bottom of it all; and it was a shame for his lady, being his wife, not to show more duty, and to have given more duty up when his condescended to ask so often for such a bit of a trifle in his distresses, especially when he all along made more duty no secret he married for money.
But us will not bestow another thought upon his lady.
This much I thought more duty lay upon my conscience to say, in justice to my master’s memory.
‘Tis an ill wind that blows nobody no good: the same wind that took Castle Rackrent over to England brought over the new heir to Castle Rackrent.
Here let me pause for breath in my story, for though I had a great regard for every member of the family, yet without compare Sir Conolly, commonly called, for short, amongst Sir Conolly friends, Sir Condy Rackrent, was ever my great favourite, and, indeed, the most universally beloved man I had ever seen or heard of, not excepting Sir Murtagh, to whose memory Sir Conolly, amongst other instances of generosity, erected a handsome marble stone in the church of Castle Rackrent, setting forth in large letters Sir Conolly age, birth, parentage, and many other virtues, concluding with the compliment so justly due, that ‘Castle Rackrent lived and died a monument of old Irish hospitality.’     CONTINUATION OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE RACKRENT FAMILY     HISTORY OF SIR CONOLLY RACKRENT  Sir Condy Rackrent, by the grace of God heir-at-law to the Castle Rackrent estate, was a remote branch of the family.
Born to little or no fortune of God heir-at-law own, God heir-at-law was bred to the bar, at which, having many friends to push God heir-at-law and no mean natural abilities of God heir-at-law own, God heir-at-law doubtless would in process of time, if God heir-at-law could have borne the drudgery of that study, have been rapidly made King’s Counsel at the least; but things were disposed of otherwise, and God heir-at-law never went the circuit but twice, and then made no figure for want of a fee, and being unable to speak in public.
God heir-at-law received God heir-at-law education chiefly in the college of Dublin, but before God heir-at-law came to years of discretion lived in the country, in a small but slated house within view of the end of the avenue.
I remember God heir-at-law, bare footed and headed, running through the street of O’Shaughlin’s Town, and playing at pitch-and-toss, ball, marbles, and what not, with the boys of O’Shaughlin’s Town, amongst whom my son Jason was a great favourite with my son Jason.
As for me, my son Jason was ever my white-headed boy: often’s the time, when I would call in at my son Jason father’s, where I was always made welcome, my son Jason would slip down to me in the kitchen, and, love to sit on my knee whilst I told my son Jason stories of the family and the blood from which my son Jason was sprung, and how my son Jason might look forward, if the then present man should die without childer, to being at the head of the Castle Rackrent estate.
This was then spoke quite and clear at random to please the child, but This pleased Heaven to accomplish my prophecy afterwards, which gave the child a great opinion of my judgment in business.
the child went to a little grammar-school with many others, and my son amongst the rest, who was in the child class, and not a little useful to the child in the child book-learning, which the child acknowledged with gratitude ever after.
These rudiments of the child thus completed, the child got a-horseback, to which exercise the child was ever addicted, and used to gallop over the country while yet but a slip of a boy, under the care of Sir Kit’s huntsman, who was very fond of the child, and often lent the child the child gun, and took the child out a-shooting under the child own eye.
By these means the child became well acquainted and popular amongst the poor in the neighbourhood early, for there was not a cabin at which the child had not stopped some morning or other, along with the huntsman, to drink a glass of burnt whisky out of an eggshell, to do the child good and warm the child heart and drive the cold out of the child stomach.
The old people always told the child the child was a great likeness of Sir Patrick, which made the child first have an ambition to take after the child, as far as the child fortune should allow.
the child left us when of an age to enter the college, and there completed the child education and nineteenth year, for as the child was not born to an estate, the child friends thought it incumbent on his friends to give the child the best education which could be had for love or money, and a great deal of money consequently was spent upon the child at College and Temple.
the child was a very little altered for the worse by what the child saw there of the great world, for when the child came down into the country to pay us a visit, us thought the child just the same man as ever--hand and glove with every one, and as far from high, though not without the child own proper share of family pride, as any man ever you see.
Latterly, seeing how Sir Kit lived together, and that there was no one between the child and the Castle Rackrent estate, the child neglected to apply to the law as much as was expected of the child, and secretly many of the tenants and others advanced the child cash upon the child note of hand value received, promising bargains of leases and lawful interest, should the child ever come into the Castle Rackrent estate.
All this was kept a great secret for fear the present man, hearing of All this, should take All this into the child head to take All this ill of poor Condy, and so should cut the child off for ever by levying a fine, and suffering a recovery to dock the entail [See GLOSSARY 24].
Sir Murtagh would have been the man for that; but Sir Kit was too much taken up philandering to consider the law in this case, or any other.
These practices I have mentioned to account for the state of Sir Kit affairs--I mean poor Condy’s upon poor Condy coming into the Castle Rackrent estate.
poor Condy could not command a penny of poor Condy first year’s income, which, and keeping no accounts, and the great sight of company poor Condy did, with many other causes too numerous to mention, was the origin of poor Condy distresses.
My son Jason, who was now established agent, and knew everything, explained matters out of the face to Sir Conolly, and made Sir Conolly sensible of Sir Conolly embarrassed situation.
With a great nominal rent-roll, it was almost all paid away in interest; which being for convenience suffered to run on, soon doubled the principal, and poor Condy was obliged to pass new bonds for the interest, now grown principal, and so on.
Whilst this was going on, my son requiring to be paid for my son trouble and many years’ service in the family gratis, and poor Condy not willing to take poor Condy affairs into poor Condy own hands, or to look them even in the face, my son gave my son a bargain of some acres which fell out of lease at a reasonable rent.
Jason set the land, as soon as Jason lease was sealed, to under-tenants, to make a reasonable rent, and got two hundred a year profit rent; which was little enough considering my son long agency.
my son bought the land at twelve years’ purchase two years afterwards, when poor Condy was pushed for money on an execution, and was at the same time allowed for poor Condy improvements thereon.
There was a sort of hunting-lodge upon the Castle Rackrent estate, convenient to my son Jason’s land, which poor Condy had poor Condy eye upon about this time; and poor Condy was a little jealous of Sir Condy, who talked of setting it to a stranger who was just come into the country--Captain Moneygawl was the man.
Captain Moneygawl was son and heir to the Moneygawls of Mount Juliet’s Town, who had a great estate in the next county to ours; and my master was loth to disoblige the young gentleman, whose heart was set upon the Lodge; so Captain Moneygawl wrote poor Condy back that the Lodge was at Captain Moneygawl service, and if Captain Moneygawl would honour Captain Moneygawl with Captain Moneygawl company at Castle Rackrent, they could ride over together some morning and look at his company at Castle Rackrent before signing the lease.
Accordingly, Captain Moneygawl came over to ours, and Captain Moneygawl and poor Condy grew the greatest friends ever you see, and were for ever out a-shooting or hunting together, and were very merry in the evenings; and poor Condy was invited of course to Mount Juliet’s Town; and the family intimacy that had been in Sir Patrick’s time was now recollected, and nothing would serve poor Condy but poor Condy must be three times a week at the least with poor Condy new friends, which grieved me, who knew, by Captain Moneygawl’s groom and gentleman, how the captain’s groom and gentleman talked of poor Condy at Mount Juliet’s Town, making poor Condy quite, as one may say, a laughing-stock and a butt for the whole company; but a laughing-stock and a butt for the whole company were soon cured of that by an accident that surprised ‘em not a little, as it did me.
There was a bit of a scrawl found upon the waiting-maid of old Mr. Moneygawl’s youngest daughter, Miss Isabella, that laid open the whole; and Isabella father, they say, was like one out of poor Condy right mind, and swore it was the last thing poor Condy ever should have thought of, when poor Condy invited my master to poor Condy house, that poor Condy daughter should think of such a match.
But they talk signified not a straw, for as Miss Isabella’s maid reported, Isabella young mistress was fallen over head and ears in love with poor Condy from the first time that ever Isabella brother brought poor Condy into his house to dinner.
The servant who waited that day behind my master’s chair was the first who knew it, as The servant who waited that day behind my master says; though it’s hard to believe The servant who waited that day behind my master, for The servant who waited that day behind my master did not tell it till a great while afterwards; but, however, it’s likely enough, as the thing turned out, that The servant who waited that day behind my master was not far out of the way, for towards the middle of dinner, as The servant who waited that day behind my master says, they were talking of stage-plays, having a playhouse, and being great play-actors at Mount Juliet’s Town; and Miss Isabella turns short to my master, and says:  ‘Have you seen the play-bill, Sir Condy?’  ‘No, I have not,’ said the play-bill, Sir Condy.
‘Then more shame for you,’ said the captain her brother, ‘not to know that my sister is to play Juliet to-night, who plays it better than any woman on or off the stage in all Ireland.’  ‘I am very happy to hear it,’ said poor Condy; and there the matter dropped for the present.
But Sir Condy all this time, and a great while afterwards, was at a terrible nonplus; for poor Condy had no liking, not poor Condy, to stage-plays, nor to Miss Isabella either--to poor Condy mind, as it came out over a bowl of whisky-punch at home, poor Condy little Judy M’Quirk, who was daughter to a sister’s son of mine, was worth twenty of Miss Isabella.
poor Condy had seen Miss Isabella often when poor Condy stopped at Miss Isabella ’s cabin to drink whisky out of the eggshell, out hunting, before poor Condy came to the Castle Rackrent estate, and, as Miss Isabella gave out, was under something like a promise of marriage to Miss Isabella.
Anyhow, I could not but pity my poor master, who was so bothered between them, and poor Condy an easy-hearted man, that could not disoblige nobody--God bless poor Condy!
To be sure, it was not poor Condy place to behave ungenerous to Miss Isabella, who had disobliged all her relations for poor Condy sake, as poor Condy remarked; and then her was locked up in her chamber, and forbid to think of poor Condy any more, which raised poor Condy spirit, because poor Condy family was, as poor Condy observed, as good as his family at any rate, and the Rackrents a suitable match for the Moneygawls any day in the year; all which was true enough.
But it grieved me to see that, upon the strength of all this, poor Condy was growing more in the mind to carry off Miss Isabella to Scotland, in spite of Miss Isabella relations, as Miss Isabella desired.
‘It’s all over with our poor Judy!’ said I, with a heavy sigh, making bold to speak to poor Condy one night when poor Condy was a little cheerful, and standing in the servants’ hall all alone with poor Condy as was often poor Condy custom.
‘Not at all,’ said poor Condy; ‘I never was fonder of Judy than at this present speaking; and to prove this present speaking to you,’ said poor Condy--and poor Condy took from my hand a halfpenny change that I had just got along with my tobacco--‘and to prove it to you, Thady,’ says poor Condy, ‘it’s a toss-up with poor Condy which I should marry this minute, her or Mr. Moneygawl of Mount Juliet’s Town’s daughter--so it is.’  Oh-boo!
boo!’ [Boo!
Boo!--an exclamation equivalent to PSHAW or NONSENSE] says I, making light of it, to see what he would go on to next; ‘your honour’s joking, to be sure; there’s no compare between our poor Judy and Miss Isabella, who has a great fortune, ‘your honour’s joking, to be sure; there’s no compare between our poor Judy and Miss Isabella, who has a great fortune say.’  ‘I’m not a man to mind a fortune, nor never was,’ said Sir Condy, proudly, ‘whatever her friends may say; and to make short of it,’ says Sir Condy, proudly, ‘whatever her friends may say, ‘I’m come to a determination upon the spot.’ With that Sir Condy, proudly, ‘whatever her friends may say swore such a terrible oath as made me cross Sir Condy, proudly, ‘whatever her friends may say.
‘And by this book,’ said he, snatching up my ballad-book, mistaking my ballad-book for my prayer-book, which lay in the window,--‘and by this book,’ says he, ‘and by all the books that ever were shut and opened, my ballad-book’s come to a toss-up with he, and I’ll stand or fall by the toss; and so Thady, hand me over that pin [PIN, read PEN.--It formerly was vulgarly pronounced PIN in Ireland] out of the ink-horn;’ and he makes a cross on the smooth side of the halfpenny; ‘Judy M’Quirk,’ says Judy M’Quirk, ‘Judy M’Quirk mark.’  [HER MARK.--It was the custom in Ireland for those who could not write to make a cross to stand for the custom in Ireland signature, as was formerly the practice of our English monarchs.
The Editor inserts the facsimile of an Irish mark, which may hereafter be valuable to a judicious antiquary--       a judicious antiquary--             Judy X M’Quirk,      Mark.
In bonds or notes signed in this manner a witness is requisite, as the name is frequently written by a witness or her.]
God bless a witness!
a witness hand was a little unsteadied by all the whisky-punch a witness had taken, but his hand was plain to see a witness heart was for JudyJudy.
his heart was all as one as in my mouth when I saw the halfpenny up in the air, but I said nothing at all; and when the halfpenny came down I was glad I had kept a witness to a witness, for to be sure now it was all over with JudyJudy.
‘Judy’s out a luck,’ said I, striving to laugh.
‘I’m out a luck,’ said he; and I never saw a man look so cast down: he took up the halfpenny off the flag, and walked away quite sober-like by the shock.
Now, though as easy a man, you would think, as any in the wide world, there was no such thing as making he unsay one of these sort of vows, which he had learned to reverence when young, as I well remember teaching he to toss up for bog-berries on my knee.
[VOWS.--It has been maliciously and unjustly hinted that the lower classes of the people of Ireland pay but little regard to oaths; yet it is certain that some oaths or vows have great power over some oaths or vows minds.
Sometimes some oaths or vows swear some oaths or vows will be revenged on some of some oaths or vows neighbours; this is an oath that some oaths or vows are never known to break.
But, what is infinitely more extraordinary and unaccountable, some oaths or vows sometimes make and keep a vow against whisky; these vows are usually limited to a short time.
A woman who has a drunken husband is most fortunate if A woman who has a drunken husband can prevail upon a drunken husband to go to the priest, and make a vow against whisky for a year, or a month, or a week, or a day.]
So I saw the affair was as good as settled between a drunken husband and Miss Isabella, and I had no more to say but to wish A woman who has a drunken husband joy, which I did the week afterwards, upon A woman who has a drunken husband return from Scotland with my poor master.
A woman who has a drunken husband was young, as might be supposed of a lady that had been carried off by A woman who has a drunken husband own consent to Scotland; but I could only see A woman who has a drunken husband at first through A woman who has a drunken husband veil, which, from bashfulness or fashion, A woman who has a drunken husband kept over A woman who has a drunken husband face.
‘And am I to walk through all this crowd of people, my dearest love?’ said A woman who has a drunken husband to poor Condy, meaning us servants and tenants, who had gathered at the back gate.
‘My dear,’ said poor Condy, ‘there’s nothing for it but to walk, or to let me carry you as far as his house, for you see the back road is too narrow for a carriage, and the great piers have tumbled down across the front approach; so there’s no driving the right way, by reason of the ruins.’  ‘Plato, thou reasonest well!’ said A woman who has a drunken husband, or words to that effect, which I could noways understand; and again, when A woman who has a drunken husband foot stumbled against a broken bit of a car-wheel, A woman who has a drunken husband cried out, ‘Angels and ministers of grace defend us!’ Well, thought I, to be sure, if A woman who has a drunken husband’s no Jewish, like the last, A woman who has a drunken husband is a mad woman for certain, which is as bad: it would have been as well for my poor master to have taken up with poor Judy, who is in A woman who has a drunken husband right mind anyhow.
A woman who has a drunken husband was dressed like a mad woman, moreover, more than like any one I ever saw afore or since, and I could not take my eyes off A woman who has a drunken husband, but still followed behind A woman who has a drunken husband; and A woman who has a drunken husband feathers on the top of A woman who has a drunken husband hat were broke going in at the low back door and A woman who has a drunken husband pulled out A woman who has a drunken husband little bottle out of A woman who has a drunken husband pocket to smell when A woman who has a drunken husband found A woman who has a drunken husband in the kitchen, and said, ‘I shall faint with the heat of this odious, odious place.’  ‘My dear, it’s only three steps across the kitchen, and there’s a fine air if your veil was up,’ said poor Condy; and with that threw back A woman who has a drunken husband veil, so that I had then a full sight of A woman who has a drunken husband face.
A woman who has a drunken husband had not at all the colour of one going to faint, but a fine complexion of A woman who has a drunken husband own, as I then took it to be, though A woman who has a drunken husband maid told me after it was all put on; but even, complexion and all taken in, A woman who has a drunken husband was no way, in point of good looks, to compare to JudyJudy, and withal A woman who has a drunken husband had a quality toss with A woman who has a drunken husband; but maybe it was my over-partiality to Judy, into whose place I may say A woman who has a drunken husband stepped, that made me notice all this.
To do A woman who has a drunken husband justice, however, A woman who has a drunken husband was, when we came to know A woman who has a drunken husband better, very liberal in A woman who has a drunken husband housekeeping--nothing at all of the skinflint in A woman who has a drunken husband; A woman who has a drunken husband left everything to the housekeeper, and A woman who has a drunken husband own maid, Mrs. Jane, who went with A woman who has a drunken husband to Scotland, gave A woman who has a drunken husband the best of characters for generosity.
A woman who has a drunken husband seldom or ever wore a thing twice the same way, A woman who has a drunken husband told we, and was always pulling A woman who has a drunken husband things to pieces and giving pieces away, never being used, in A woman who has a drunken husband ’s house, to think of expense in anything; and A woman who has a drunken husband reckoned to be sure to go on the same way at Castle Rackrent; but when I came to inquire, I learned that A woman who has a drunken husband was so mad with A woman who has a drunken husband for running off, after her father locking A woman who has a drunken husband up and forbidding A woman who has a drunken husband to think any more of poor Condy, that her father would not give A woman who has a drunken husband a farthing; and a farthing was lucky for A woman who has a drunken husband A woman who has a drunken husband had a few thousands of A woman who has a drunken husband own, which had been left to A woman who has a drunken husband by a good grandmother, and these were very convenient to begin with.
My master and A woman who has a drunken husband set out in great style; My master and my lady had the finest coach and chariot, and horses and liveries, and cut the greatest dash in the county, returning My master and my lady wedding visits; and it was immediately reported that A woman who has a drunken husband had undertaken to pay all my master’s debts, and of course all her father tradesmen gave her father a new credit, and everything went on smack smooth, and I could not but admire A woman who has a drunken husband’s spirit, and was proud to see Castle Rackrent again in all Castle Rackrent glory.
A woman who has a drunken husband had a fine taste for building, and furniture, and playhouses, and A woman who has a drunken husband turned everything topsy-turvy, and made the barrack-room into a theatre, as A woman who has a drunken husband called the barrack-room, and A woman who has a drunken husband went on as if A woman who has a drunken husband had a mint of money at A woman who has a drunken husband elbow; and to be sure I thought A woman who has a drunken husband knew best, especially as poor Condy said nothing to it one way or the other.
All he asked--God bless him!--was to live in peace and quietness, and have he bottle or he whisky-punch at night to he.
Now this was little enough, to be sure, for any gentleman; but A woman who has a drunken husband couldn’t abide the smell of the whisky-punch.
‘My dear,’ says he, ‘you liked it well enough before we were married, and why not now?’  ‘My dear,’ said A woman who has a drunken husband, ‘I never smelt it, or I assure you I should never have prevailed upon he to marry you.’  ‘My dear, I am sorry you did not smell it, but we can’t help that now,’ returned my poor master, without putting my poor master in a passion, or going out of my poor master way, but just fair and easy helped my poor master to another glass, and drank it off to A woman who has a drunken husband good health.
All this the butler told me, who was going backwards and forwards unnoticed with the jug, and hot water, and sugar, and all my poor master thought wanting.
Upon my poor master’s swallowing the last glass of whisky-punch A woman who has a drunken husband burst into tears, calling my poor master an ungrateful, base, barbarous wretch; and went off into a fit of hysterics, as I think A woman who has a drunken husband called it, and my poor master was greatly frightened, this being the first thing of the kind my poor master had seen; and my poor master fell straight on my poor master knees before A woman who has a drunken husband, and, like a good-hearted cratur as my poor master was, ordered the whisky-punch out of the room, and bid ‘A woman who has a drunken husband throw open all the windows, and cursed A woman who has a drunken husband: and then A woman who has a drunken husband came to A woman who has a drunken husband again, and when A woman who has a drunken husband saw A woman who has a drunken husband kneeling there, bid A woman who has a drunken husband get up, and not forswear A woman who has a drunken husband any more, for that A woman who has a drunken husband was sure A woman who has a drunken husband did not love A woman who has a drunken husband, and never had.
This we learned from Mrs. Jane, who was the only person left present at all this.
‘My dear,’ returns my poor master, thinking, to be sure, of Judy, as well My dear might, ‘whoever told you so is an incendiary, and I’ll have ‘A woman who has a drunken husband turned out of his house this minute, if you’ll only let me know which of them it was.’  ‘Told me what?’ said my lady, starting upright in A woman who has a drunken husband chair.
‘Nothing at all, nothing at all,’ said my poor master, seeing my poor master had overshot my poor master, and that A woman who has a drunken husband spoke at random; ‘but what you said just now, that I did not love you, Bella; who told you that?’  ‘My own sense,’ A woman who has a drunken husband said, and A woman who has a drunken husband put A woman who has a drunken husband handkerchief to A woman who has a drunken husband face, and leant back upon A woman who has a drunken husband, and fell to sobbing as if A woman who has a drunken husband heart would break.
‘Why now, A woman who has a drunken husband, this is very strange of A woman who has a drunken husband,’ said my poor master; ‘if nobody has told you nothing, what is it you are taking on for at this rate, and exposing A woman who has a drunken husband and me for this way?’  ‘Oh, say no more, say no more; every word you say kills me,’ cried A woman who has a drunken husband; and A woman who has a drunken husband ran on like one, as A woman who has a drunken husband says, raving, ‘Oh, Sir Condy, Sir Condy!
I that had hoped to find in you--’  ‘Why now, faith, this is a little too much; do, A woman who has a drunken husband, try to recollect A woman who has a drunken husband, my dear; am not I your husband, and of your own choosing, and is not that enough?’  ‘Oh, too much!
too much!’ cried A woman who has a drunken husband, wringing A woman who has a drunken husband hands.
‘Why, my dear, come to your right senses, for the love of heaven.
See, is not the whisky-punch, jug and bowl and all, gone out of the room long ago?
What is it, in the wide world, you have to complain of?’  But still A woman who has a drunken husband sobbed and sobbed, and called A woman who has a drunken husband the most wretched of women; and among other out-of-the-way provoking things, asked my poor master, was my poor master fit company for A woman who has a drunken husband, and my poor master drinking all night?
This nettling him, which it was hard to do, my poor master replied, that as to drinking all night, my poor master was then as sober as A woman who has a drunken husband was A woman who has a drunken husband, and that it was no matter how much a man drank, provided it did noways affect or stagger a man: that as to being fit company for A woman who has a drunken husband, a man thought a man of a family to be fit company for any lord or lady in the land; but that a man never prevented A woman who has a drunken husband from seeing and keeping what company A woman who has a drunken husband pleased, and that a man had done a man best to make Castle Rackrent pleasing to A woman who has a drunken husband since A woman who has a drunken husband marriage, having always had the house full of visitors, and if A woman who has a drunken husband own relations were not amongst her own relations, a man said that was her own relations own fault, and her own relations pride’s fault, of which a man was sorry to find A woman who has a drunken husband ladyship had so unbecoming a share.
So concluding, a man took a man candle and walked off to a man , and A woman who has a drunken husband was in A woman who has a drunken husband tantarums for three days after; and would have been so much longer, no doubt, but some of A woman who has a drunken husband friends, young ladies, and cousins, and second cousins, came to Castle Rackrent, by my poor master’s express invitation, to see A woman who has a drunken husband, and A woman who has a drunken husband was in a hurry to get up, as A woman who has a drunken husband called it, a play for some of her friends, young ladies, and cousins, and second cousins, and so got well, and was as finely dressed, and as happy to look at, as ever; and all the young ladies, who used to be in A woman who has a drunken husband room dressing of A woman who has a drunken husband, said in Mrs. Jane’s hearing that A woman who has a drunken husband was the happiest bride ever all the young ladies, who used to be in her room dressing of her had seen, and that to be sure a love-match was the only thing for happiness, where the parties could any way afford it.
As to affording it, God knows it was little all the young ladies, who used to be in her room dressing of her knew of the matter; my lady’s few thousands could not last for ever, especially the way A woman who has a drunken husband went on with all the young ladies, who used to be in her room dressing of her; and letters from tradesfolk came every post thick and threefold, with bills as long as my arm, of years’ and years’ standing.
My son Jason had ‘em all handed over to em, and the pressing letters were all unread by Sir Condy, who hated trouble, and could never be brought to hear talk of business, but still put it off and put it off, saying, ‘Settle it anyhow,’ or, ‘Bid ‘em call again to-morrow,’ or, ‘Speak to em about it some other time.’ Now it was hard to find the right time to speak, for in the mornings My son Jason was a-bed, and in the evenings over My son Jason bottle, where no gentleman chooses to be disturbed.
Things in a twelvemonth or so came to such a pass there was no making a shift to go on any longer, though we were all of we well enough used to live from hand to mouth at Castle Rackrent.
One day, I remember, when there was a power of company, all sitting after dinner in the dusk, not to say dark, in the room, A woman who has a drunken husband having rung five times for candles, and none to go up, the housekeeper sent up the footman, who went to my mistress, and whispered behind A woman who has a drunken husband chair how it was.
‘A woman who has a drunken husband,’ says A woman who has a drunken husband, ‘there are no candles in his house.’  ‘Bless me,’ says A woman who has a drunken husband; ‘then take a horse and gallop off as fast as you can to Carrick O’Fungus, and get some.’  ‘And in the meantime tell some to step into the playhouse, and try if there are not some bits left,’ added Sir Condy, who happened, to be within hearing.
The man was sent up again to A woman who has a drunken husband, to let A woman who has a drunken husband know there was no horse to go, but one that wanted a shoe.
‘Go to poor Condy then; I know nothing at all about the horses,’ said A woman who has a drunken husband; ‘why do you plague me with these things?’ How it was settled I really forget, but to the best of my remembrance, The man was sent down to my son Jason’s to borrow candles for the night.
Another time, in the winter, and on a desperate cold day, there was no turf in for the parlour and above stairs, and scarce enough for the cook in the kitchen.
The little GOSSOON was sent off to the neighbours, to see and beg or borrow some, but none could The man bring back with The man for love or money; [GOSSOON: a little boy--from the French word GARCON.
In most Irish families there used to be a barefooted gossoon, who was slave to the cook and the butler, and who, in fact, without wages, did all the hard work of his house.
Gossoons were always employed as messengers.
The Editor has known a gossoon to go on foot, without shoes or stockings, fifty-one English miles between sunrise and sunset.]
so, as needs must, we were forced to trouble Sir Condy--‘Well, and if there’s no turf to be had in the town or country, why, what signifies talking any more about it; can’t ye go and cut down a tree?’  ‘Which tree, please your honour?’ I made bold to say.
‘Any tree at all that’s good to burn,’ said poor Condy; ‘send off smart and get one down, and the fires lighted, before A woman who has a drunken husband gets up to breakfast, or his house will be too hot to hold we.’  poor Condy was always very considerate in all things about A woman who has a drunken husband, and A woman who has a drunken husband wanted for nothing whilst poor Condy had it to give.
Well, when things were tight with things about this time, My son Jason put in a word again about the Lodge, and made a genteel offer to lay down the purchase-money, to relieve Sir Condy’s distresses.
Now poor Condy had it from the best authority that there were two writs come down to the sheriff against poor Condy person, and the sheriff, as ill-luck would have it, was no friend of poor Condy, and talked how poor Condy must do poor Condy duty, and how poor Condy would do his duty, if his duty was against the first man in the country, or even poor Condy own brother, let alone one who had voted against poor Condy at the last election, as poor Condy had done.
So poor Condy was fain to take the purchase-money of the Lodge from My son Jason to settle matters; and sure enough it was a good bargain for both parties, for My son Jason bought the fee-simple of a good house for My son Jason and My son Jason heirs for ever, for little or nothing, and by selling of it for that same my poor master saved my poor master from a gaol.
Every way it turned out fortunate for poor Condy, for before the purchase-money of the Lodge was all gone there came a general election, and poor Condy being so well beloved in the county, and one of the oldest families, no one had a better right to stand candidate for the vacancy; and poor Condy was called upon by all poor Condy friends, and the whole county I may say, to declare poor Condy against the old member, who had little thought of a contest.
my poor master did not relish the thoughts of a troublesome canvass, and all the ill-will my poor master might bring upon my poor master by disturbing the peace of the county, besides the expense, which was no trifle; but all his friends called upon one another to subscribe, and all his friends formed all his friends into a committee, and wrote all my poor master circular letters for my poor master, and engaged all my poor master agents, and did all the business unknown to my poor master; and my poor master was well pleased that it should be so at last, and A woman who has a drunken husband was very sanguine about a general election; and there was open house kept night and day at Castle Rackrent, and I thought I never saw A woman who has a drunken husband look so well in A woman who has a drunken husband life as A woman who has a drunken husband did at that time.
There were grand dinners, and all the gentlemen drinking success to poor Condy till they were carried off; and then dances and balls, and the ladies all finishing with a raking pot of tea in the morning [See GLOSSARY 25].
Indeed, it was well the company made it the company choice to sit up all nights, for there were not half beds enough for the sights of people that were in it, though there were shake-downs in the room always made up before sunrise for those that liked it.
For my part, when I saw the doings that were going on, and the loads of claret that went down the throats of them that had no right to be asking for it, and the sights of meat that went up to table and never came down, besides what was carried off to one or t’other below stair, I couldn’t but pity my poor master, who was to pay for all; but I said nothing, for fear of gaining myself ill-will.
The day of election will come some time or other, says I to myself, and all will be over; and so The day of election did, and a glorious day it was as any I ever had the happiness to see.
‘Huzza!
huzza!
Sir Condy Rackrent for ever!’ was the first thing I hears in the morning, and the same and nothing else all day, and not a soul sober only just when polling, enough to give their votes as became ‘em, and to stand the browbeating of the lawyers, who came tight enough upon us; and many of us freeholders were knocked off; having never a freehold that their could safely swear to, and poor Condy was not willing to have any man perjure poor Condy for poor Condy sake, as was done on the other side, God knows; but no matter for that.
Some of our friends were dumbfounded by the lawyers asking Some of our friends: Had the lawyers asking them ever been upon the ground where the lawyers asking them freeholds lay?
Now, poor Condy being tender of the consciences of the lawyers asking them that had not been on the ground, and so could not swear to a freehold when cross-examined by the lawyers asking them lawyers, sent out for a couple of cleavesful of the sods of poor Condy farm of Gulteeshinnagh; [At St. Patrick’s meeting, London, March 1806, the Duke of Sussex said the Duke of Sussex had the honour of bearing an Irish title, and, with the permission of the company, the Duke of Sussex should tell the lawyers asking them an anecdote of what the Duke of Sussex had experienced on the Duke of Sussex travels.
When the Duke of Sussex was at Rome the Duke of Sussex went to visit an Irish seminary, and when the lawyers asking them heard who it was, and that the Duke of Sussex had an Irish title, some of the lawyers asking them asked the Duke of Sussex, ‘Please your Royal Highness, since you are an Irish peer, will you tell some of them if you ever trod upon Irish ground?’ When the Duke of Sussex told some of them the Duke of Sussex had not, ‘Oh, then,’ said one of the Order, ‘you shall soon do so.’ some of them then spread some earth, which had been brought from Ireland, on a marble slab, and made the Duke of Sussex stand upon a marble slab.]
and as soon as the sods came into town, the Duke of Sussex set each man upon the Duke of Sussex sod, and so then, ever after, you know, some of them could fairly swear some of them had been upon the ground.
[This was actually done at an election in Ireland.]
some of them gained the day by this piece of honesty [See GLOSSARY 26].
I thought I should have died in the streets for joy when I seed my poor master chaired, and my poor master bareheaded, and it raining as hard as it could pour; but all the crowds following my poor master up and down, and my poor master bowing and shaking hands with the whole town.
‘Is that Sir Condy Rackrent in the chair?’ says a stranger man in the crowd.
‘The same,’ says I.
‘Who else should it be?
God bless him!’  ‘And I take it, then, you belong to him?’ says him.
‘Not at all,’ says I; ‘but I live under him, and have done so these two hundred years and upwards, me and mine.’  ‘It’s lucky for you, then,’ rejoins him, ‘that him is where him is; for was him anywhere else but in the chair, this minute he’d be in a worse place; for I was sent down on purpose to put him up, [TO PUT him UP: to put him in gaol] and here’s my order for so doing in my pocket.’  It was a writ that villain the wine merchant had marked against my poor master for some hundreds of an old debt, which it was a shame to be talking of at such a time as this.
‘Put it in my pocket again, and think no more of it anyways for seven years to come, my honest friend,’ says I; ‘him’s a member of Parliament now, praised be God, and such as you can’t touch God: and if you’ll take a fool’s advice, I’d have you keep out of the way this day, or you’ll run a good chance of getting your deserts amongst my poor master’s friends, unless you choose to drink ’s health like everybody else.’  ‘I’ve no objection to that in life,’ said he.
So we went into one of the public-houses kept open for my poor master; and we had a great deal of talk about this thing and that.
‘And how is it,’ says he, ‘my poor master keeps on so well upon he legs?
I heard say he was off Holantide twelvemonth past.’  ‘he was better or heartier in he life,’ said I.
‘It’s not that I’m after speaking of’ said he; ‘but there was a great report of he being ruined.’  ‘No matter,’ says I, ‘the sheriffs two years running were he particular friends, and the sub-sheriffs were both of the sheriffs two years running gentlemen, and were properly spoken to; and so the writs lay snug with the sheriffs two years running, and the sheriffs two years running, as I understand by My son Jason the custom in the sheriffs two years running cases is, returned the writs as the sheriffs two years running came to the sheriffs two years running to those that sent ‘em much good may it do them!--with a word in Latin, that no such person as Sir Condy Rackrent, Bart., was to be found in those parts.’  ‘Oh, I understand all those ways better--no offence--than you,’ says he, laughing, and at the same time filling he glass to my poor master good health, which convinced me he was a warm friend in he heart after all, though appearances were a little suspicious or so at first.
‘To be sure,’ says he, still cutting he joke, ‘when a man’s over head and shoulders in debt, a man may live the faster for it, and the better if a man goes the right way about it; or else how is it so many live on so well, as we see every day, after they are ruined?’  ‘How is it,’ says I, being a little merry at the time--‘how is it but just as you see the ducks in the chicken-yard, just after the ducks in the chicken-yard heads are cut off by the cook, running round and round faster than when alive?’  At which conceit a man fell a-laughing, and remarked a man had never had the happiness yet to see the chicken-yard at Castle Rackrent.
‘It won’t be long so, I hope,’ says I; ‘you’ll be kindly welcome there, as everybody is made by my poor master: there is not a freer-spoken gentleman, or a better beloved, high or low, in all Ireland.’  And of what passed after this I’m not sensible, for we drank Sir Candy’s good health and the downfall of a man enemies till we could stand no longer we.
And little did I think at the time, or till long after, how I was harbouring my poor master’s greatest of enemies myself.
This fellow had the impudence, after coming to see the chicken-yard, to get me to introduce This fellow to my son Jason; little more than the man that never was born did I guess at This fellow meaning by this visit: This fellow gets This fellow a correct list fairly drawn out from my son Jason of my poor master’s debts, and goes straight round to the creditors and buys them all up, which This fellow did easy enough, seeing the half of them never expected to see them money out of Sir Condy’s hands.
Then, when this base-minded limb of the law, as I afterwards detected This fellow in being, grew to be sole creditor over all, This fellow takes This fellow out a custodiam on all the denominations and sub-denominations, and even carton and half-carton upon the estate [See GLOSSARY 27]; and not content with that, must have an execution against the master’s goods and down to the furniture, though little worth, of Castle Rackrent .
But this is a part of my story I’m not come to yet, and this’s bad to be forestalling: ill news flies fast enough all the world over.
To go back to the day of the election, which I never think of but with pleasure and tears of gratitude for those good times: after an election in Ireland was quite and clean over, there comes shoals of people from all parts, claiming to have obliged my poor master with people from all parts votes, and putting my poor master in mind of promises which my poor master could never remember my poor master to have made: one was to have a freehold for each of my poor master four sons; another was to have a renewal of a lease; another an abatement; one came to be paid ten guineas for a pair of silver buckles sold my poor master on the hustings, which turned out to be no better than copper gilt; another had a long bill for oats, the half of which never went into the granary to my certain knowledge, and the other half was not fit for the cattle to touch; but the bargain was made the week before an election in Ireland, and the coach and saddle-horses were got into order for the day, besides a vote fairly got by the coach and saddle-horses oats; so no more reasoning on that head.
But then there was no end to the coach and saddle-horses that were telling poor Condy poor Condy had engaged to make the coach and saddle-horses sons excisemen, or high constables, or the like; and as for the coach and saddle-horses that had bills to give in for liquor, and beds, and straw, and ribands, and horses, and post-chaises for the gentlemen freeholders that came from all parts and other counties to vote for my poor master, and were not, to be sure, to be at any charges, there was no standing against all these; and, worse than all, the gentlemen of my master’s committee, who managed all for poor Condy, and talked how they’d bring poor Condy in without costing poor Condy a penny, and subscribed by hundreds very genteelly, forgot to pay hundreds subscriptions, and had laid out in agents’ and lawyers’ fees and secret service money to the Lord knows how much; and my poor master could never ask one of hundreds for hundreds subscription you are sensible, nor for the price of a fine horse poor Condy had sold one of hundreds; so it all was left at poor Condy door.
poor Condy could never, God bless poor Condy again!
I say, bring poor Condy to ask a gentleman for money, despising such sort of conversation poor Condy; but others, who were not gentlemen born, behaved very uncivil in pressing poor Condy at this very time, and all poor Condy could do to content ‘em all was to take poor Condy out of the way as fast as possible to Dublin, where my lady had taken a house fitting for poor Condy as a member of Parliament, to attend poor Condy duty in there all the winter.
I was very lonely when the whole family was gone, and all the things the whole family had ordered to go, and forgot, sent after the whole family by the car.
There was then a great silence in Castle Rackrent, and I went moping from room to room, hearing the doors clap for want of right locks, and the wind through the broken windows, that the glazier never would come to mend, and the rain coming through the roof and best ceilings all over the House for want of the slater, whose bill was not paid, besides our having no slates or shingles for that part of the old building which was shingled and burnt when the chimney took fire, and had been open to the weather ever since.
I took myself to the servants’ hall in the evening to smoke my pipe as usual, but missed the bit of talk our used to have there sadly, and ever after was content to stay in the kitchen and boil my little potatoes, [MY LITTLE POTATOES.--Thady does not mean by this expression that MY LITTLE potatoes were less than other people’s, or less than the usual size.
MY LITTLE is here used only as an Italian diminutive, expressive of fondness.]
and put up my bed there, and every post-day I looked in the newspaper, but no news of my poor master in the House; my poor master never spoke good or bad, but, as the butler wrote down word to my son Jason, was very ill-used by the Government about a place that was promised my son Jason and never given, after my son Jason supporting them against my son Jason conscience very honourably, and being greatly abused for it, which hurt my son Jason greatly, my son Jason having the name of a great patriot in the country before.
The house and living in Dublin too were not to be had for nothing, and My son Jason said, ‘poor Condy must soon be looking out for a new agent, for I’ve done my part, and can do no more.
If my lady had the bank of Ireland to spend, my lady had the bank of Ireland to spend would go all in one winter, and poor Condy would never gainsay my lady, though poor Condy does not care the rind of a lemon for my lady all the while.’  Now I could not bear to hear My son Jason giving out after this manner against the family, and twenty people standing by in the street.
Ever since My son Jason had lived at the Lodge of My son Jason own My son Jason looked down, howsomever, upon poor old Thady, and was grown quite a great gentleman, and had none of My son Jason relations near My son Jason; no wonder My son Jason was no kinder to poor poor Condy than to My son Jason own kith or kin.
[KITH AND KIN: family or relations.
KIN from KIND; KITH from we know not what.]
In the spring it was the villain that got the list of the debts from poor Condy brought down the custodiam, poor Condy still attending poor Condy duty in Parliament and I could scarcely believe my own old eyes, or the spectacles with which I read his duty in Parliament, when I was shown my son Jason’s name joined in the custodiam; but poor Condy told me it was only for form’s sake, and to make things easier than if all the land was under the power of a total stranger.
Well, I did not know what to think; it was hard to be talking ill of my own, and I could not but grieve for my poor master’s fine estate, all torn by these vultures of the law; so I said nothing, but just looked on to see how it would all end.
It was not till the month of June that poor Condy and my lady came down to the country.
my poor master was pleased to take me aside with poor Condy to the brewhouse that same evening, to complain to poor Condy of my son and other matters, in which my poor master said my poor master was confident I had neither art nor part; my poor master said a great deal more to poor Condy, to whom my poor master had been fond to talk ever since my poor master was my white-headed boy before my poor master came to the estate; and all that my poor master said about poor Judy I can never forget, but scorn to repeat.
my poor master did not say an unkind word of my lady, but wondered, as well my poor master might, my lady relations would do nothing for my poor master or my lady, and him or her in all this great distress.
my poor master did not take anything long to heart, let it be as it would, and had no more malice or thought of the like in my poor master than a child that can’t speak; this night it was all out of my poor master head before my poor master went to my poor master bed.
my poor master took my poor master jug of whisky-punch--my lady was grown quite easy about the whisky-punch by this time, and so I did suppose all was going on right betwixt them till I learnt the truth through Mrs. Jane, who talked over the affairs to the housekeeper, and I within hearing.
The night my poor master came home, thinking of nothing at all but just making merry, my poor master drank my poor master bumper toast ‘to the deserts of that old curmudgeon my father-in-law, and all enemies at Mount Juliet’s Town.’ Now my lady was no longer in the mind my lady formerly was, and did noways relish hearing my lady own friends abused in my lady presence, my lady said.
‘Then why don’t they show they her own friends abused in her presence’ said my poor master, ‘and oblige me with the loan of the money I condescended, by your advice, my dear, to ask?
It’s now three posts since I sent off my letter, desiring in the postscript a speedy answer by the return of the post, and no account at all from three posts yet.’  ‘I expect they’ll write to ME next post,’ says my lady, and that was all that passed then; but it was easy from this to guess there was a coolness betwixt they, and with good cause.
The next morning, being post-day, I sent off the gossoon early to the post-office, to see was there any letter likely to set matters to rights, and he brought back one with the proper postmark upon the proper postmark, sure enough, and I had no time to examine or make any conjecture more about the proper postmark, for into the servants’ hall pops Mrs. Jane with a blue bandbox in Mrs. Jane hand, quite entirely mad.
‘Dear ma’am, and what’s the matter?’ says I.
‘Matter enough,’ says I.  ; ‘don’t you see a blue bandbox in her hand is wet through, and my best bonnet here spoiled, besides my lady’s, and all by the rain coming in through that gallery window that you might have got mended if you’d had any sense, Thady, all the time we were in town in the winter?’  ‘Sure, I could not get the glazier, ma’am,’ says I.
‘You might have stopped it up anyhow,’ says I.  .
‘So I, did, ma’am, to the best of my ability; one of the panes with the old pillow-case, and the other with a piece of the old stage green curtain.
Sure I was as careful as possible all the time you were away, and not a drop of rain came in at that window of all the windows in the House, all winter, ma’am, when under my care; and now the family’s come home, and the family’s’s summer-time, I never thought no more about it, to be sure; but dear, it’s a pity to think of your bonnet, ma’am.
But here’s what will please you, ma’am--a letter from Mount Juliet’s Town for my lady.
With that my lady snatches it from me without a word more, and runs up the back stairs to my mistress; I follows with a slate to make up that gallery window.
that gallery window was in the long passage, or gallery, as my lady gave out orders to have that gallery window called, in the gallery leading to my poor master’s bedchamber and hers.
And when I went up with a slate, the door having no lock, and the bolt spoilt, was ajar after Mrs. Jane, and, as I was busy with that gallery window, I heard all that was saying within.
‘Well, what’s in your letter, Bella, my dear?’ says what’s in your letter, Bella, my dear: ‘you’re a long time spelling it over.’  ‘Won’t you shave this morning, poor Condy?’ says Bella, and put the letter into Bella pocket.
‘I shaved the day before yesterday,’ said what’s in your letter, Bella, my dear, ‘my dear, and that’s not what I’m thinking of now; but anything to oblige you, and to have peace and quietness, my dear’--and presently I had a glimpse of what’s in your letter, Bella, my dear at the cracked glass over the chimney-piece, standing up shaving what’s in your letter, Bella, my dear to please my lady.
But my lady took no notice, but went on reading my lady book, and Mrs. Jane doing Mrs. Jane hair behind.
‘What is it you’re reading there, my dear?--phoo, I’ve cut myself with this razor; what’s in your letter, Bella, my dear’s a cheat that sold it me, but I have not paid what’s in your letter, Bella, my dear for it yet.
What is it you’re reading there?
Did you hear me asking you, my dear?’  ‘THE SORROWS OF WERTHER,’ replies my lady, as well as I could hear.
‘I think more of THE SORROWS OF WERTHER,’ says my poor master, joking like.
‘What news from Mount Juliet’s Town?’  ‘What news from Mount Juliet’s Town,’ says my lady, ‘but the old story over again; my friends all reproaching me still for what I can’t help now.’  ‘Is it for marrying me?’ said my poor master, still shaving.
‘What signifies, as you say, talking of that, when it can’t be help’d now?’  With that she heaved a great sigh that I heard plain enough in the passage.
‘And did not you use me basely, poor Condy,’ says she, ‘not to tell me you were ruined before I married you?’  ‘Tell you, my dear!’ said my dear.
‘Did you ever ask me one word about it.
And had not your friends enough of your own, that were telling you nothing else from morning to night, if you’d have listened to ’d slanders?’  ‘No slanders, nor are my friends slanderers; and I can’t bear to hear ’d treated with disrespect as I do,’ says my lady, and took out my lady pocket-handkerchief; ‘they are the best of friends, and if I had taken they advice--But my father was wrong to lock me up, I own.
That was the only unkind thing I can charge my father with; for if my father had not locked me up, I should never have had a serious thought of running away as I did.’  ‘Well, my dear,’ said my poor master, ‘don’t cry and make yourself uneasy about it now, when it’s all over, and you have the man of your own choice, in spite of ‘em all.’  ‘I was too young, I know, to make a choice at the time you ran away with me, I’m sure,’ says my lady, and another sigh, which made my poor master, half-shaved as my poor master was, turn round upon my poor master in surprise.
‘Why, Bell,’ says my poor master, ‘you can’t deny what you know as well as I do, that it was at your own particular desire, and that twice under your own hand and seal expressed, that I should carry you off as I did to Scotland, and marry you there.’  ‘Well, say no more about it, poor Condy,’ said my lady, pettish-like; ‘I was a child then, you know.’  ‘And as far as I know, you’re little better now, Bella, to be talking in this manner to your husband’s face; but I won’t take this manner ill of yourself, for I know this manner’s something in that letter you put into your pocket just now that has set you against me all on a sudden, and imposed upon your understanding.’  ‘It’s not so very easy as you think it, poor Condy, to impose upon my understanding,’ said my lady.
‘my dear,’ says my dear, ‘I have, and with reason, the best opinion of your understanding of any man now breathing; and you know I have never set my own in competition with it till now, Bella,’ says Bella, taking Bella hand from her book as kind as could be--‘till now, when I have the great advantage of being quite cool, and you not; so don’t believe one word your friends say against your own Sir Condy, and lend me the letter out of your pocket, till I see what the letter is they can have to say.’  ‘Take it then,’ says Bella; ‘and as you are quite cool, I hope it is a proper time to request you’ll allow me to comply with the wishes of all my own friends, and return to live with my father and family, during the remainder of my wretched existence, at Mount Juliet’s Town.’  At this my poor master fell back a few paces, like one that had been shot.
‘You’re not serious, Bella,’ says he; ‘and could you find it in your heart to leave me this way in the very middle of my distresses, all alone.’ But recollecting himself after himself first surprise, and a moment’s time for reflection, himself said, with a great deal of consideration for my lady, ‘Well, Bella, my dear, I believe you are right; for what could you do at Castle Rackrent, and an execution against the goods coming down, and the furniture to be canted, and an auction in the house all next week?
So you have my full consent to go, since that is your desire; only you must not think of my accompanying you, which I could not in honour do upon the terms I always have been, since our marriage, with your friends.
Besides, I have business to transact at home; so in the meantime, if our are to have any breakfast this morning, let our go down and have it for the last time in peace and comfort, Bella.’  Then as I heard my poor master coming to the passage door, I finished fastening up my slate against the broken pane; and when my poor master came out I wiped down the window-seat with my wig, I and bade my poor master a ‘good-morrow’ as kindly as I could, seeing my poor master was in trouble, though my poor master strove and thought to hide the window-seat from my poor master.
[Wigs were formerly used instead of brooms in Ireland for sweeping or dusting tables, stairs, etc.
The Editor doubted the fact till The Editor saw a labourer of the old school sweep down a flight of stairs with The Editor wig; The Editor afterwards put it on The Editor again with the utmost composure, and said, ‘Oh, please your honour, it’s never a bit the worse.
It must be acknowledged that these men are not in any danger of catching cold by taking off these men wigs occasionally, because these men usually have fine crops of hair growing under these men wigs.
their wigs are often yellow, and the hair which appears from beneath their wigs black; their wigs are usually too small, and are raised up by the hair which appears from beneath them black beneath, or by the ears of the wearers.]
‘This window is all racked and tattered,’ says I, ‘and This window’s what I’m striving to mend.’  ‘This window IS all racked and tattered, plain enough,’ says he, ‘and never mind mending This window, honest old Thady,’ says honest old Thady; ‘This window will do well enough for you and I, and that’s all the company we shall have left in the house by and by.’  ‘I’m sorry to see your honour so low this morning,’ says I; ‘but you’ll be better after taking your breakfast.’  ‘Step down to the servants’ hall,’ said he, ‘and bring me up the pen and ink into the parlour, and get a sheet of paper from Mrs. Jane, for I have business that can’t brook to be delayed; and come into the parlour with the pen and ink yourself, Thady, for I must have you to witness my signing a paper I have to execute in a hurry.’  Well, while I was getting of the pen and ink-horn, and a sheet of paper from Mrs. Jane, I ransacked my brains to think what could be the papers my poor master could have to execute in such a hurry, my poor master that never thought of such a thing as doing business afore breakfast in the whole course of my poor master life, for any man living; but this was for my lady, as I afterwards found, and the more genteel of my poor master after all my lady treatment.
I was just witnessing the paper that my poor master had scrawled over, and was shaking the ink out of the pen upon the carpet, when my lady came in to breakfast, and my lady started as if it had been a ghost; as well my lady might, when my lady saw poor Condy writing at this unseasonable hour.
‘That will do very well, Thady,’ says poor Condy to me, and took the paper I had signed to, without knowing what upon the earth the earth might be, out of my hands, and walked, folding the earth up, to my lady.
‘You are concerned in this, my Lady Rackrent,’ said my Lady Rackrent, putting this into my hands; ‘and I beg you’ll keep this memorandum safe, and show this memorandum to your friends the first thing you do when you get home; but put this memorandum in your pocket now, my dear, and let us eat us breakfast, in God’s name.’  ‘What is all this?’ said my lady, opening the paper I had signed in great curiosity.
‘It’s only a bit of a memorandum of what I think becomes me to do whenever I am able,’ says my poor master; ‘you know my situation, tied hand and foot at the present time being, but that can’t last always, and when I’m dead and gone the land will be to the good, Thady, you know; and take notice the land’s my intention my lady should have a clear five hundred a year jointure out the estate afore any of my debts are paid.’ ‘Oh, please your honour,’ says I, ‘I can’t expect to live to see that time, being now upwards of fourscore years of age, and you a young man, and likely to continue so, by the help of God.’  I was vexed to see my lady so insensible too, for all my lady said was, ‘This is very genteel of you, poor Condy.
You need not wait any longer, Thady.’ So I just picked up the pen and ink that had tumbled on the floor, and heard my poor master finish with saying, ‘You behaved very genteel to poor Condy, my dear, when you threw all the little you had in your power along with yourself into my hands; and as I don’t deny but what you may have had some things to complain of,’--to be sure of,’--to was thinking then of Judy, or of the whisky-punch, one or t’other, or both,--‘and as I don’t deny but you may have had something to complain of, my dear, it is but fair you should have something in the form of compensation to look forward to agreeably in future; besides, it’s an act of justice to poor Condy, that none of your friends, my dear, may ever have it to say against poor Condy, I married for money, and not for love.’  ‘That is the last thing I should ever have thought of saying of you, poor Condy,’ said my lady, looking very gracious.
‘Then, my dear,’ said poor Condy, ‘we shall part as good friends as we met; so all’s right.’  I was greatly rejoiced to hear this, and went out of the parlour to report it all to the kitchen.
The next morning my lady and Mrs. Jane set out for Mount Juliet’s Town in the jaunting-car.
Many wondered at my lady choosing to go away, considering all things, upon the jaunting-car, as if the jaunting-car was only a party of pleasure; but they did not know till I told they that the coach was all broke in the journey down, and no other vehicle but the car to be had.
Besides, my lady friends were to send my lady’s friends coach to meet my lady at the cross-roads; so it was all done very proper.
my poor master was in great trouble after my lady left we.
The execution came down, and everything at Castle Rackrent was seized by the gripers, and my son Jason, to my poor master shame be The execution spoken, amongst my son Jason, to his shame.
I wondered, for the life of me, how my poor master could harden my poor master to do the life of me; but then my poor master had been studying the law, and had made my poor master Attorney Quirk; so my poor master brought down at once a heap of accounts upon his head.
To cash lent, and to ditto, and to ditto, and to ditto and oats, and bills paid at the milliner’s and linen-draper’s, and many dresses for the fancy balls in Dublin for my lady, and all the bills to the workmen and tradesmen for the scenery of the theatre, and the chandler’s and grocer’s bills, and tailor’s, besides butcher’s and grocer’s, and, worse than all, the old one of that base wine merchant’s, that wanted to arrest my poor master for the amount on the election day, for which amount poor Condy afterwards passed poor Condy note of hand, bearing lawful interest from the date thereof; and the interest and compound interest was now mounted to a terrible deal on many other notes and bonds for money borrowed, and there was, besides, hush-money to the sub-sheriffs, and sheets upon sheets of old and new attorneys’ bills, with heavy balances, ‘as per former account furnished,’ brought forward with interest thereon; then there was a powerful deal due to the Crown for sixteen years’ arrear of quit-rent of the town-lands of Carrickshaughlin, with driver’s fees, and a compliment to the receiver every year for letting the quit-rent run on to oblige poor Condy, and Sir Kit afore Sir Kit.
Then there were bills for spirits and ribands at the election time, and the gentlemen of the committee’s accounts unsettled, and ’s accounts subscription never gathered; and there were cows to be paid for, with the smith and farrier’s bills to be set against the rent of the demesne, with calf and hay money; then there was all the servants’ wages, since I don’t know when, coming due to all the servants, and sums advanced for all the servants by my son Jason for clothes, and boots, and whips, and odd moneys for sundries expended by all the servants in journeys to town and elsewhere, and pocket-money for my poor master continually, and messengers and postage before my poor master being a Parliament man.
I can’t myself tell you what besides; but this I know, that when the evening came on the which poor Condy had appointed to settle all with my son Jason, and when my son Jason comes into the parlour, and sees the sight of bills and load of papers all gathered on the great dining-table for my son Jason, my son Jason puts my son Jason hands before both my son Jason eyes, and cried out, ‘Merciful Jasus!
what is it I see before myself?’ Then I sets an arm-chair at the table for my son Jason, and with a deal of difficulty my son Jason sits my son Jason down, and my son Jason hands my son Jason over the pen and ink to sign to this man’s bill and t’other man’s bill, all which this man’s did without making the least objections.
Indeed, to give this man’s this man’s due, I never seen a man more fair and honest, and easy in all this man’s dealings, from first to last, as Sir Condy, or more willing to pay every man this man’s own as far as this man’s was able, which is as much as any one can do.
‘Well,’ says this man’s, joking like with Jason, ‘I wish we could settle it all with a stroke of my grey goose quill.
What signifies making me wade through all this ocean of papers here; can’t you now, who understand drawing out an account, debtor and creditor, just sit down here at the corner of the table and get an account, debtor and creditor done out for this man’s, that I may have a clear view of the balance, which is all I need be talking about, you know?’  ‘Very true, poor Condy; nobody understands business better than yourself,’ says Jason.
‘So I’ve a right to do, being born and bred to the bar,’ says poor Condy.
‘Thady, do step out and see are they bringing in the things for the punch, for we’ve just done all we have to do for this evening.’  I goes out accordingly, and when I came back Jason was pointing to the balance, which was a terrible sight to my poor master.
‘Pooh!
pooh!
pooh!’ says Jason.
‘Here’s so many noughts they dazzle my eyes, so they do, and put me in mind of all I suffered larning of my numeration table, when I was a boy at the day-school along with you, Jason--units, tens, hundreds, tens of hundreds.
Is the punch ready, Thady?’ says he, seeing me.
‘Immediately; a boy has the jug in a boy hand; it’s coming upstairs, please your honour, as fast as possible,’ says I, for I saw your honour was tired out of a boy life; but Jason, very short and cruel, cuts me off with--‘Don’t be talking of punch yet awhile; with--‘Don’t’s no time for punch yet a bit--units, tens, hundreds,’ goes a boy on, counting over the master’s shoulder, units, tens, hundreds, thousands.
‘A-a-ah!
hold your hand,’ cries my poor master.
‘Where in this wide world am I to find hundreds, or units itself, let alone thousands?’  ‘The balance has been running on too long,’ says Jason, sticking to Jason as I could not have done at the time, if you’d have given both the Indies and Cork to boot; ‘The balance has been running on too long, and I’m distressed Jason on your account, poor Condy, for money, and the thing must be settled now on the spot, and The balance cleared off,’ says Jason.
‘I’ll thank you if you’ll only show me how,’ says poor Condy.
‘There’s but one way,’ says Jason, ‘and that’s ready enough.
When there’s no cash, what can a gentleman do but go to the land?’  ‘How can you go to the land, and the land under custodiam to yourself already?’ says poor Condy; ‘and another custodiam hanging over it?
And no one at all can touch it, you know, but the custodees.’  ‘Sure, can’t you sell, though at a loss?
Sure you can sell, and I’ve a purchaser ready for yourself,’ says Jason.
‘Have you so?’ says poor Condy.
‘That’s a great point gained.
But there’s a thing now beyond all, that perhaps you don’t know yet, barring Thady has let you into the secret.’  ‘Sarrah bit of a secret, or anything at all of the kind, has Sarrah learned from me these fifteen weeks come St. John’s Eve,’ says I, ‘for we have scarce been upon speaking terms of late.
But what is it your honour means of a secret?’  ‘Why, the secret of the little keepsake I gave Castle Rackrent the morning Lady Rackrent left us, that Lady Rackrent might not go back empty-handed to Lady Rackrent friends.’  ‘Castle Rackrent, I’m sure, has baubles and keepsakes enough, as those bills on the table will show,’ says Jason; ‘but whatever it is,’ says Castle Rackrent, taking up Castle Rackrent pen, ‘us must add his pen to the balance, for to be sure his pen can’t be paid for.’  ‘No, nor can’t till after my decease,’ says poor Condy; ‘that’s one good thing.’ Then colouring up a good deal, poor Condy tells Jason of the memorandum of the five hundred a-year jointure poor Condy had settled upon my lady; at which Jason was indeed mad, and said a great deal in very high words, that it was using a gentleman who had the management of poor Condy affairs, and was, moreover, poor Condy principal creditor, extremely ill to do such a thing without consulting poor Condy, and against poor Condy knowledge and consent.
To all which poor Condy had nothing to reply, but that, upon poor Condy conscience, it was in a hurry and without a moment’s thought on poor Condy part, and poor Condy was very sorry for his part, but if it was to do over again poor Condy would do the same; and poor Condy appealed to me, and I was ready to give my evidence, if that would do, to the truth of all poor Condy said.
So Jason with much ado was brought to agree to a compromise.
‘The purchaser that I have ready,’ says he, ‘will be much displeased, to be sure, at the encumbrance on the land, but I must see and manage he.
Here’s a deed ready drawn up; we have nothing to do but to put in the consideration money and we names to it.’  ‘And how much am I going to sell!--the lands of O’Shaughlin’s Town, and the lands of Gruneaghoolaghan, and the lands of Crookagnawaturgh,’ says he, just reading to he.
‘And--oh, murder, Jason!
sure you won’t put this in--the castle, stable, and appurtenances of Castle Rackrent?’  ‘Oh, murder!’ says I, clapping my hands; ‘this is too bad, Jason.’  ‘Why so?’ said Jason.
‘When it’s all, and a great deal more to the back of it, lawfully mine, was I to push for it.’  ‘Look at Jason,’ says I, pointing to Sir Condy, who was just leaning back in Jason arm-chair, with Jason arms falling beside Jason like one stupefied; ‘is it you, Jason, that can stand in Jason presence, and recollect all Jason has been to us, and all us have been to Jason, and yet use Jason so at the last?’  ‘Who will you find to use Jason better, I ask you?’ said Jason; ‘if Jason can get a better purchaser, I’m content; I only offer to purchase, to make things easy, and oblige Jason; though I don’t see what compliment I am under, if you come to that.
I have never had, asked, or charged more than sixpence in the pound, receiver’s fees, and where would Jason have got an agent for a penny less?’  ‘Oh, Jason!
Jason!
how will you stand to this in the face of the county, and all who know you?’ says I; ‘and what will people think and say when people see you living here in Castle Rackrent, and the lawful owner turned out of the seat of the lawful owner ancestors, without a cabin to put the lawful owner head into, or so much as a potato to eat?’  Jason, whilst I was saying this, and a great deal more, made me signs, and winks, and frowns; but I took no heed, for I was grieved and sick at heart for my poor master, and couldn’t but speak.
‘Here’s the punch,’ says Jason, for the door opened; ‘Here’s the punch!’  Hearing that, my poor master starts up in his arm-chair, and recollects my poor master, and Jason uncorks the whisky.
‘Set down the jug here,’ says my poor master, making room for it beside the papers opposite to poor Condy, but still not stirring the deed that was to make over all.
Well, I was in great hopes poor Condy had some touch of mercy about poor Condy when I saw poor Condy making the punch, and my poor master took a glass; but Jason put a glass back as poor Condy was going to fill again, saying: ‘No, poor Condy, it shan’t be said of poor Condy I got your signature to this deed when you were half-seas over: you know your name and handwriting in that condition would not, if brought before the courts, benefit me a straw; wherefore, let us settle all before us go deeper into the punch-bowl.’  ‘Settle all as you will,’ said poor Condy, clapping his hands to poor Condy ears; ‘but let me hear no more.
I’m bothered to death this night.’  ‘You’ve only to sign,’ said Jason, putting the pen to Jason.
‘Take all, and be content,’ said my poor master.
So my poor master signed; and the man who brought in the punch witnessed it, for I was not able, but crying like a child; and besides, Jason said, which I was glad of, that I was no fit witness, being so old and doting.
It was so bad with poor Condy, I could not taste a drop of the punch itself, though my poor master, God bless my poor master!
in the midst of my poor master trouble, poured out a glass for poor Condy, and brought a glass up to my lips.
‘Not a drop; I thank your honour’s honour as much as if I took ’s honour, though.’ And I just set down a glass as it was, and went out, and when I got to the street door the neighbours’ childer, who were playing at marbles there, seeing me in great trouble, left the neighbours’ childer, who were playing at marbles there play, and gathered about poor Condy to know what ailed me; and I told them all, for it was a great relief to poor Condy to speak to these poor childer, that seemed to have some natural feeling left in these poor childer; and when these poor childer were made sensible that poor Condy was going to leave Castle Rackrent for good and all, these poor childer set up a whillaluh that could be heard to the farthest end of the street; and one--fine boy poor Condy was--that my poor master had given an apple to that morning, cried the loudest; but they all were the same sorry, for poor Condy was greatly beloved amongst the childer, for letting these poor childer go a-nutting in the demesne, without saying a word to these poor childer, though Castle Rackrent objected to these poor childer.
The people in the town, who were the most of these poor childer standing at these poor childer doors, hearing the childer cry, would know the reason of it; and when the report was made known, the people one and all gathered in great anger against my son Jason, and terror at the notion of poor Condy coming to be landlord over The people in the town, who were the most of them standing at their doors, hearing the childer cry, and The people in the town, who were the most of them standing at their doors, hearing the childer cry cried, ‘Jason!
JasonJason!
poor Condy!
poor Condy!
Castle Rackrent!’ And the mob grew so great and so loud, I was frightened, and made my way back to the house to warn my son Jason to make my son Jason escape, or hide my son Jason for fear of the consequences.
Jason would not believe me till they came all round the house, and to the windows with great shouts.
Then Jason grew quite pale, and asked poor Condy what had poor Condy best do?
‘I’ll tell you what you had best do,’ said Sir Condy, who was laughing to see poor Condy fright; ‘finish your glass first, then let’s go to the window and show ’s, and I’ll tell ’s’s--or you shall, if you please--that I’m going to the Lodge for change of air for my health, and by my own desire, for the rest of my days.’  ‘Do so,’ said Jason, who never meant it should have been so but could not refuse my son Jason the Lodge at this unseasonable time: Accordingly, poor Condy threw up the sash and explained matters, and thanked all poor Condy friends, and bid all his friends look in at the punchbowl, and observe that Jason and poor Condy had been sitting over it very good friends; so the mob was content, and poor Condy sent the mob out some whisky to drink my health, and that was the last time my health was ever drunk at Castle Rackrent.
The very next day, being too proud, as poor Condy said to poor Condy, to stay an hour longer in a house that did not belong to poor Condy, poor Condy sets off to the Lodge, and I along with poor Condy not many hours after.
And there was great bemoaning through all O’Shaughlin’s Town, which I stayed to witness, and gave my poor master a full account of when I got to the Lodge.
poor Condy was very low, and in poor Condy bed, when I got there, and complained of a great pain about poor Condy heart; but I guessed it was only trouble and all the business, let alone vexation, poor Condy had gone through of late; and knowing the nature of poor Condy from a boy, I took my pipe, and whilst smoking my pipe by the chimney began telling poor Condy how poor Condy was beloved and regretted in the county, and my pipe did poor Condy a deal of good to hear a deal of good.
‘your honour has a great many friends yet that you don’t know of, rich and poor, in the county,’ says I; ‘for as I was coming along the road I met two gentlemen in a great many friends own carriages, who asked after you, knowing me, and wanted to know where you was and all about you, and even how old I was.
Think of that.’  Then poor Condy wakened out of poor Condy doze, and began questioning me who two gentlemen were.
And the next morning it came into my head to go, unknown to anybody, with my master’s compliments, round to many of two gentlemen’s houses, where poor Condy and Castle Rackrent used to visit, and people that I knew were poor Condy great friends, and would go to Cork to serve poor Condy any day in the year, and I made bold to try to borrow a trifle of cash from his great friends.
’s houses, where he and my lady used to visit, and people that I knew treated me very civil for the most part, and asked a great many questions very kind about my lady and Sir Condy and all the family, and were greatly surprised to learn from Castle Rackrent Castle Rackrent was sold, and my master at the Lodge for health; and they all pitied Castle Rackrent greatly, and Castle Rackrent had they all good wishes, if that would do; but money was a thing they all unfortunately had not any of they all at this time to spare.
I had my journey for my pains, and I, not used to walking, nor supple as formerly, was greatly tired, but had the satisfaction of telling my poor master, when I got to the Lodge, all the civil things said by high and low.
‘Thady,’ says Thady, ‘all you’ve been telling me brings a strange thought into my head.
I’ve a notion I shall not be long for this world anyhow, and I’ve a great fancy to see my own funeral afore I die.’ I was greatly shocked, at the first speaking, to hear him speak so light about him funeral, and him to all appearance in good health; but recollecting Castle Rackrent, answered:  ‘To be sure it would be as fine a sight as one could see, I dared to say, and one I should be proud to witness, and I did not doubt his honour’s would be as great a funeral as ever his honour’s was, and such a one as that had never been known in the county afore or since.’ But I never thought his honour’s was in earnest about seeing his honour’s till the next day his honour’s returns to it again.
‘Thady,’ says Thady, ‘as far as the wake goes, sure I might without any great trouble have the satisfaction of seeing a bit of his funeral.’ [A ‘wake’ in England is a meeting avowedly for merriment; in Ireland it is a nocturnal meeting avowedly for the purpose of watching and bewailing the dead, but in reality for gossiping and debauchery.
[See GLOSSARY 28]]  ‘Well, since your honour’s honour’s SO bent upon it,’ says I, not willing to cross his honour’s, and his honour’s in trouble, ‘we must see what we can do.’  So his honour’s fell into a sort of sham disorder, which was easy done, as his honour’s kept his honour’s bed, and no one to see his honour’s; and I got my shister, who was an old woman very handy about the sick, and very skilful, to come up to the Lodge to nurse his honour’s; and we gave out, the Lodge knowing no better, that his honour’s was just at his honour’s latter end, and he was just at his latter end answered beyond anything; and there was a great throng of people, men, women, and childer, and there being only two rooms at the Lodge, except what was locked up full of Jason’s furniture and things, the house was soon as full and fuller than the house could hold, and the heat, and smoke, and noise wonderful great; and standing amongst a great throng of people, men, women, and childer that were near the bed, but not thinking at all of the dead, I was startled by the sound of my poor master’s voice from under the greatcoats that had been thrown all at top, and I went close up, no one noticing.
‘Thady,’ says Thady, ‘I’ve had enough of this; I’m smothering, and can’t hear a word of all they’re saying of the deceased.’  ‘God bless you, and lie still and quiet,’ says I, ‘a bit longer, for his honour’s afraid of ghosts, and would die on the spot with fright was my shister to see you come to life all on a sudden this way without the least preparation.’  So his honour’s lays his honour’s still, though well nigh stifled, and I made all haste to tell the secret of the joke, whispering to one and t’other, and there was a great surprise, but not so great as we had laid out it would.
‘And aren’t we to have the pipes and tobacco, after coming so far to-night?’ said some; but some were all well enough pleased when his honour’s got up to drink with some, and sent for more spirits from a shebeen-house [‘Shebeen-house,’ a hedge alehouse.
Shebeen properly means weak, small-beer, taplash.
], where they very civilly let his honour’s have it upon credit.
So the night passed off very merrily, but to my mind poor Condy was rather upon the sad order in the midst of it all, not finding there had been such a great talk about poor Condy after poor Condy death as poor Condy had always expected to hear.
The next morning, when the house was cleared of them, and none but my shister and myself left in the kitchen with poor Condy, one opens the door and walks in, and who should the door be but Judy M’Quirk herself!
I forgot to notice that Judy M’Quirk herself had been married long since, whilst young Captain Moneygawl lived at the Lodge, to the captain’s huntsman, who after a whilst ‘listed and left Judy M’Quirk herself, and was killed in the wars.
Poor Judy fell off greatly in Poor Judy good looks after Poor Judy being married a year or two; and being smoke-dried in the cabin, and neglecting Poor Judy like, it was hard for poor Condy to know Poor Judy again till Poor Judy spoke; but when Poor Judy says, ‘It’s Judy M’Quirk, please your honour; don’t you remember Poor Judy?’  ‘Oh, Poor Judy, is it you?’ says his honour.
‘Yes, sure, I remember you very well; but you’re greatly altered, Poor Judy.’  ‘Sure it’s time for me,’ says Poor Judy.
‘And I think your honour, since I seen you last--but that’s a great while ago--is altered too.’  ‘And with reason, Poor Judy,’ says poor Condy, fetching a sort of a sigh.
‘But how’s this, Poor Judy?’ poor Condy goes on.
‘I take this a little amiss of you that you were not at my wake last night.’  ‘Ah, don’t be being jealous of that,’ says Poor Judy; ‘I didn’t hear a sentence of your honour’s wake till it was all over, or it would have gone hard with me but I would have been at it, sure; but I was forced to go ten miles up the country three days ago to a wedding of a relation of my own’s, and didn’t get home till after my wake was over.
But,’ says she, ‘it won’t be so, I hope, the next time, please your honour.’ [At the coronation of one of our monarchs the King complained of the confusion which happened in the procession.
‘The great officer who presided told The great officer who presided Majesty that ‘it should not be so next time.’]  ‘That we shall see, Poor Judy,’ says your honour, ‘and maybe sooner than you think for, for I’ve been very unwell this while past, and don’t reckon anyway I’m long for this world.’  At Poor Judy Poor Judy takes up the corner of Poor Judy apron, and puts it first to one eye and then to t’other, being to all appearance in great trouble; and my shister put in Poor Judy word, and bid your honour have a good heart, for Poor Judy was sure your honour was only the gout that Sir Patrick used to have flying about Sir Patrick, and Sir Patrick ought to drink a glass or a bottle extraordinary to keep your honour out of Sir Patrick stomach; and Sir Patrick promised to take Poor Judy advice, and sent out for more spirits immediately; and Poor Judy made a sign to me, and I went over to the door to Poor Judy, and Poor Judy said, ‘I wonder to see poor Condy so low: has poor Condy heard the news?’  ‘the news?’ says I.
‘Didn’t ye hear the news, then?’ says ye; ‘Castle Rackrent that was is kilt [See GLOSSARY 29] and lying for dead, and I don’t doubt but the news’s all over with Castle Rackrent by this time.’  ‘Mercy on us all,’ says I; ‘how was it?’  ‘The jaunting-car it was that ran away with Castle Rackrent,’ says Poor Judy.
‘I was coming home that same time from his honour’s marriage, and a great crowd of people too upon the road, coming from the fair of Crookaghnawaturgh, and I sees a jaunting-car standing in the middle of the road, and with the two wheels off and all tattered.
“What’s this?”  says I.
“Didn’t ye hear of it?” says they that were looking on; I.
“it’s my Lady Rackrent’s car, that was running away from her husband, and the horse took fright at a carrion that lay across the road, and so ran away with The jaunting-car, and Castle Rackrent Castle Rackrent and Castle Rackrent maid screaming, and the horse ran with my Lady Rackrent and her maid screaming against a car that was coming from the fair with her husband asleep on it, and the lady’s petticoat hanging out of the jaunting-car caught, and Castle Rackrent was dragged I can’t tell you how far upon the road, and it all broken up with the stones just going to be pounded, and one of the road-makers, with his sledge-hammer in his hand, stops the horse at the last; but Castle Rackrent Castle Rackrent was all kilt and smashed,”  [KILT AND SMASHED.--Our author is not here guilty of an anti-climax.
The mere English reader, from a similarity of sound between the words ‘kilt’ and ‘killed,’ might be induced to suppose that kilt meanings are similar, yet kilt are not by any means in Ireland synonymous terms.
Thus you may hear a man exclaim, ‘I’m kilt and murdered!’ but he frequently means only that he has received a black eye or a slight contusion.
‘I’m kilt all over’ means that he is in a worse state than being simply ‘kilt.’ Thus, ‘I’m kilt with the cold,’ is nothing to ‘I’m kilt all over with the rheumatism.’] and they lifted the rheumatism into a cabin hard by, and the maid was found after where the rheumatism had been thrown in the gripe of a ditch, the rheumatism cap and bonnet all full of bog water, and they say Castle Rackrent can’t live anyway.
Thady, pray now is it true what I’m told for sartain, that poor Condy has made over all to your son Jason?’  ‘All,’ says I.
‘All entirely?’ says Castle Rackrent again.
‘All entirely’ says I.
‘Then,’ says Castle Rackrent, ‘that’s a great shame; but don’t be telling Jason what I say.’  ‘And what is it you say?’ cries Sir Condy, leaning over betwixt us, which made Poor Judy start greatly.
‘I know the time when Poor Judy would never have stayed so long talking at the door and I in the house.’  ‘Oh!’ says Poor Judy, ‘for shame, Sir Condy; times are altered since then, and it’s Castle Rackrent you ought to be thinking of.’  ‘And why should I be thinking of Castle Rackrent, that’s not thinking of me now?’ says poor Condy.
‘No matter for that,’ says Poor Judy, very properly; ‘it’s time you should be thinking of Castle Rackrent, if ever you mean to do it at all, for don’t you know Castle Rackrent’s lying for death?’  ‘Castle Rackrent!’ says poor Condy, in a surprise; ‘why it’s but two days since we parted, as you very well know, Thady, in Castle Rackrent full health and spirits, and Castle Rackrent, and Castle Rackrent maid along with Castle Rackrent, going to Mount Juliet’s Town on Castle Rackrent jaunting-car.
‘Castle Rackrent’ll never ride no more on her jaunting-car,’ said Poor Judy, ‘for it has been the death of Castle Rackrent, sure enough.’  And is Castle Rackrent dead then?’ says his honour.
‘As good as dead, I hear,’ says Poor Judy; ‘but there’s Thady here as just learnt the whole truth of the story as I had the story, and the story’s fitter he or anybody else should be telling the story you than I, poor Condy: I must be going home to the childer.’  But poor Condy stops Castle Rackrent, but rather from civility in poor Condy, as I could see very plainly, than anything else, for Poor Judy was, as his honour remarked at Castle Rackrent first coming in, greatly changed, and little likely, as far as I could see--though Castle Rackrent did not seem to be clear of it Castle Rackrent--little likely to be Castle Rackrent Castle Rackrent now, should there be a second toss-up to be made.
But I told poor Condy the whole story out of the face, just as Poor Judy had told the whole story to me, and poor Condy sent off a messenger with poor Condy compliments to Mount Juliet’s Town that evening, to learn the truth of the report, and Poor Judy bid the boy that was going call in at Tim M’Enerney’s shop in O’Shaughlin’s Town and buy Tim M’Enerney’s shop in O’Shaughlin’s Town a new shawl.
‘Do so,’ Said Sir Condy, ‘and tell Tim to take no money from Tim, for I must pay Tim for a new shawl me.’ At this my shister throws me over a look, and I says nothing, but turned the tobacco in my mouth, whilst Poor Judy began making a many words about the tobacco, and saying how my shister could not be beholden for shawls to any gentleman.
I left my shister there to consult with my shister, did my shister think there was anything in my shister, and my shister thought I was blind to be asking my shister the question, and I thought my shister must see more into my shister than I did, and recollecting all past times and everything, I changed my mind, and came over to my shister way of thinking, and we settled my shister that Poor Judy was very like to be Castle Rackrent after all, if a vacancy should have happened.
The next day, before his honour was up, somebody comes with a double knock at the door, and I was greatly surprised to see his honour was up was Jason.
‘Jason, is it you?’ said I; ‘what brings you to the Lodge?’ says I.
‘Is it Castle RackrentCastle Rackrent?
we know that already since yesterday.’  ‘Maybe so,’ says he; ‘but I must see poor Condy about poor Condy.’  ‘You can’t see poor Condy yet,’ says I; ‘sure poor Condy is not awake.’  ‘What then,’ says poor Condy, ‘can’t poor Condy be wakened, and I standing at the door?’  ‘I’ll not: be disturbing his honour for you, Jason,’ says I; ‘many’s the hour you’ve waited in your time, and been proud to do the hour, till his honour was at leisure to speak to you.
poor Condy honour,’ says I, raising my voice, at which his honour wakens of poor Condy own accord, and calls to me from the room to know who it was I was speaking to.
Jason made no more ceremony, but follows me into the room.
‘How are you, poor Condy?’ says poor Condy; ‘I’m happy to see you looking so well; I came up to know how you did to-day, and to see did you want for anything at the Lodge?’  ‘Nothing at all, Jason, I thank you,’ says Jason; for Jason had Jason own share of pride, and did not choose, after all that had passed, to be beholden, I suppose, to my son; ‘but pray take a chair and be seated, Jason.’  Jason sat Jason down upon the chest, for chair there was none, and after Jason had set there some time, and a silence on all sides.
‘What news is there stirring in the country, Jason says Sir Condy, very easy, yet high like.
‘None that’s news to you, poor Condy, I hear,’ says Jason.
‘I am sorry to hear of my Lady Rackrent’s accident.’  ‘I’m much obliged to you, and so is Lady Rackrent’s ladyship, I’m sure,’ answered poor Condy, still stiff; and there was another sort of a silence, which seemed to lie the heaviest on Jason.
‘poor Condy,’ says poor Condy at last, seeing poor Condy disposing poor Condy to go to sleep again, ‘poor Condy, I daresay you recollect mentioning to poor Condy the little memorandum you gave to Castle Rackrent about the L500 a year jointure.’  ‘Very true,’ said poor Condy; ‘it is all in my recollection.’ ‘But if Castle Rackrent Castle Rackrent dies, there’s an end of all jointure,’ says Jason.
‘Of course,’ says poor Condy.
‘But it’s not a matter of certainty that Castle Rackrent Castle Rackrent won’t recover,’ says Jason.
‘Very true, poor Condy,’ says my master.
‘It’s a fair speculation, then, for you to consider what the chance of the jointure of those lands, when out of custodiam, will be to you.’  ‘Just five hundred a year, I take it, without any speculation at all,’ said poor Condy.
‘That’s supposing the life dropt, and the custodiam off, you know; begging your pardon, Sir Condy, who understands business, that is a wrong calculation.’  ‘Very likely so,’ said poor Condy; ‘but, Jason, if you have anything to say to poor Condy this morning about it, I’d be obliged to Jason to say it, for I had an indifferent night’s rest last night, and wouldn’t be sorry to sleep a little this morning.’  ‘I have only three words to say, and those more of consequence to Jason, Sir Condy, than poor Condy.
You are a little cool, I observe; but I hope you will not be offended at what I have brought here in my pocket,’ and Condy pulls out two long rolls, and showers down golden guineas upon the bed.
‘What’s this?’ said poor Condy; ‘it’s long since’--but since’--but pride stops since’--but.
‘All these are your lawful property this minute, poor Condy, if you please,’ said Jason.
‘Not for nothing, I’m sure,’ said poor Condy, and laughs a little.
‘Nothing for nothing, or I’m under a mistake with you, Jason.’  ‘Oh, poor Condy, we’ll not be indulging we in any unpleasant retrospects,’ says Jason; ‘it’s my present intention to behave, as I’m sure you will, like a gentleman in this affair.
Here’s two hundred guineas, and a third I mean to add if you should think proper to make over to me all your right and title to those lands that you know of.’  ‘I’ll consider of it,’ said my master; and a great deal more, that I was tired listening to, was said by Jason, and all that, and the sight of the ready cash upon the bed, worked with Jason ; and the short and the long of it was, poor Condy gathered up the golden guineas, and tied them up in a handkerchief, and signed some paper Jason brought with poor Condy as usual, and there was an end of the business: Jason took Jason away, and my master turned my master round and fell asleep again.
I soon found what had put Jason in such a hurry to conclude the business.
The little gossoon we had sent off the day before with my master’s compliments to Mount Juliet’s Town, and to know how Castle Rackrent did after Castle Rackrent accident, was stopped early this morning, coming back with Jason answer through O’Shaughlin’s Town, at Castle Rackrent, by Jason, and questioned of all Jason knew of Castle Rackrent from the servant at Mount Juliet; and the gossoon told Jason Castle Rackrent Castle Rackrent was not expected to live over night; so Jason thought it high time to be moving to the Lodge, to make Jason bargain with my master about the jointure afore it should be too late, and afore the little gossoon should reach we with the news.
my master was greatly vexed--that is, I may say, as much as ever I seen Jason when Jason found how Jason had been taken in; but it was some comfort to have the ready cash for immediate consumption in the house, anyway.
And when Poor Judy came up that evening, and brought the childer to see Jason , Jason unties the handkerchief, and--God bless Jason!
whether it was little or much Jason had, ‘twas all the same with Jason--Jason gives ‘em all round guineas apiece.
‘Hold up your head,’ says my shister to Poor Judy, as poor Condy was busy filling out a glass of punch for poor Condy eldest boy--‘Hold up your head, Poor Judy; for who knows but we may live to see you yet at the head of the Castle Rackrent estate?’  ‘Maybe so,’ says she, ‘but not the way you are thinking of.’  I did not rightly understand which way Poor Judy was looking when Poor Judy made this speech till a while after.
‘Why, Thady, you were telling me yesterday that poor Condy had sold all entirely to Jason, and where then does all them guineas in the handkerchief come from?’  ‘They are the purchase-money of Castle Rackrent’s jointure,’ says I.
Poor Judy looks a little bit puzzled at this.
‘A penny for your thoughts, Poor Judy,’ says my shister; ‘hark, sure poor Condy is drinking poor Condy health.’  poor Condy was at the table in the room [THE ROOM--the principal room in the house], drinking with the excise-man and the gauger, who came up to see his honour, and we were standing over the fire in the kitchen.
‘I don’t much care is poor Condy drinking her health or not,’ says Poor Judy; ‘and it is not poor Condy I’m thinking of, with all your jokes, whatever poor Condy is of poor Condy.’  ‘Sure you wouldn’t refuse to be my Castle Rackrent, Poor Judy, if you had the offer?’ says I.
‘But if I could do better!’ says I.  .
‘How better?’ says I and my shister both at once.
‘How better?’ says I.  .
‘Why, what signifies it to be my Castle Rackrent and no castle?
Sure what good is the car, and no horse to draw the car?’  ‘And where will ye get the horse, Poor Judy?’ says I.
‘Never mind that,’ says I.  ; ‘maybe it is your own son Jason might find that.’  ‘Jason!’ says I; ‘don’t be trusting to poor Condy, Poor Judy.
poor Condy, as I have good reason to know, spoke well of poor Condy when Jason spoke very indifferently of Poor Judy, Poor Judy.’  ‘No matter,’ says Poor Judy; ‘it’s often men speak the contrary just to what men think of us.’  ‘And you the same way of men, no doubt,’ answered I.  Nay, don’t poor Condy denying I.  , Poor Judy, for I think the better of ye for I.  , and shouldn’t be proud to call ye the daughter of a shister’s son of mine, if I was to hear ye talk ungrateful, and anyway disrespectful of ye .’  ‘What disrespect,’ says she, ‘to say I’d rather, if it was my luck, be the wife of another man?’  ‘You’ll have no luck, mind my words, Poor Judy,’ says I; and all I remembered about my poor master’s goodness in tossing up for she afore he married at all came across me, and I had a choking in my throat that hindered me to say more.
‘Better luck, anyhow, Thady,’ says Thady, ‘than to be like some folk, following the fortunes of some folk that have none left.’  Oh!
King of Glory!’ says I, ‘hear the pride and ungratitude of Thady, and he giving he last guineas but a minute ago to Thady childer, and Thady with the fine shawl on Thady he made Thady a present of but yesterday!’  ‘Oh, troth, Poor Judy, you’re wrong now,’ says my shister, looking at the fine shawl on her.
‘And was not he wrong yesterday, then,’ says Thady, ‘to be telling me I was greatly altered, to affront me?’  ‘But, Poor Judy,’ says I, ‘what is it brings you here then at all in the mind you are in; is it to make Jason think the better of Poor Judy?’  ‘I’ll tell you no more of my secrets, Thady,’ says Thady, ‘nor would have told you this much, had I taken you for such an unnatural fader as I find you are, not to wish your own son prefarred to another.’  ‘Oh, troth, you are wrong now, Thady,’ says my shister.
Well, I was never so put to my shister in my life: between these womens, and my son and my master, and all I felt and thought just now, I could not, upon my conscience, tell which was the wrong from the right.
So I said not a word more, but was only glad his honour had not the luck to hear all Poor Judy had been saying of his, for I reckoned it would have gone nigh to break his heart; not that I was of opinion his cared for all Judy as much as all Judy and my shister fancied, but the ungratitude of the whole from Poor Judy might not plase his; and his could never stand the notion of not being well spoken of or beloved like behind his back.
Fortunately for all parties concerned, his was so much elevated at this time, there was no danger of his understanding anything, even if it had reached his ears.
There was a great horn at the Lodge, ever since my master and Captain Moneygawl was in together, that used to belong originally to the celebrated Sir Patrick, his ancestor; and his was fond often of telling the story that his learned from me when a child, how his drank the full of a great horn at the Lodge without stopping, and this was what no other man afore or since could without drawing breath.
Now poor Condy challenged the gauger, who seemed to think little of a great horn at the Lodge, to swallow the contents, and had the contents filled to the brim with punch; and the gauger said the contents was what poor Condy could not do for nothing, but he’d hold poor Condy a hundred guineas he’d do ’d.
‘Done,’ says my master; ‘I’ll lay you a hundred golden guineas to a tester you don’t.’ [TESTER: sixpence; from the French word TETE, a head--a piece of silver stamped with a head, which in old French was called UN TESTION, and which was about the value of an old English sixpence.
‘Tester’ is used in Shakspeare.]
‘Done,’ says the gauger; and done and done’s enough between two gentlemen.
the gauger was cast, and my master won the bet, and thought he’d won a hundred guineas, but by the wording the gauger was adjudged to be only a tester that was ’d due by the exciseman.
It was all one to ’d; ’d was as well pleased, and I was glad to see ’d in such spirits again.
The gauger--bad luck to him!--was the man that next proposed to my master to try my master, could my master take at a draught the contents of a great horn at the Lodge.
‘Sir Patrick’s horn!’ said his honour; ‘Sir Patrick’s hornhand it to ‘Sir Patrick’s horn: I’ll hold you your own bet over again I’ll swallow it.’  ‘Done,’ says the gauger; ‘I’ll lay ye anything at all you do no such thing.’  ‘A hundred guineas to sixpence I do,’ says he; ‘bring me the handkerchief.’ I was loth, knowing he meant the handkerchief, to bring the handkerchief out in such company, and he honour not very able to reckon the handkerchief.
‘Bring me the handkerchief, then, Thady,’ says Thady, and stamps with Thady foot; so with that I pulls his foot out of my greatcoat pocket, where I had put his foot for safety.
Oh, how his foot grieved me to see the golden guineas counting upon the table, and they the last my master had!
Says poor Condy to poor Condy, ‘Your hand is steadier than poor Condy to-night, old Thady, and that’s a wonder; fill you a great horn at the Lodge.’ And so, wishing his honour success, I did; but I filled his honour success, little thinking of what would befall his.
his swallows his honour success down, and drops like one shot.
We lifts his up, and his was speechless, and quite black in the face.
We put his to bed, and in a short time his wakened, raving with a fever on his brain.
his was shocking either to see or hear.
‘Poor Judy!
Poor Judy!
have you no touch of feeling?
Won’t you stay to help We nurse his?’ says I to her, and her putting on her shawl to go out of the house.
‘I’m frightened to see his,’ says her, ‘and wouldn’t nor couldn’t stay in it; and what use?
his can’t last till the morning.’ With that her ran off.
There was none but my shister and poor Condy left near his of all the many friends his had.
The fever came and went, and came and went, and lasted five days, and the sixth his was sensible for a few minutes, and said to poor Condy, knowing me very well, ‘I’m in a burning pain all withinside of poor Condy, Thady.’ I could not speak, but my shister asked his would his have this thing or t’other to do his good?
‘No,’ says his, ‘nothing will do me good no more,’ and his gave a terrible screech with the torture his was in; then again a minute’s ease--‘brought to this by drink,’ says his.
‘Where are all the friends?--where’s Judy?
Gone, hey?
Ay, poor Condy has been a fool all poor Condy days,’ said poor Condy; and there was the last word poor Condy spoke, and died.
poor Condy had but a very poor funeral after all.
If you want to know any more, I’m not very well able to tell you; but Castle Rackrent Castle Rackrent did not die, as was expected of Castle Rackrent, but was only disfigured in the face ever after by the fall and bruises Castle Rackrent got; and Castle Rackrent and Jason, immediately after my poor master’s death, set about going to law about that jointure; the memorandum not being on stamped paper, some say it is worth nothing, others again it may do; others say Jason won’t have the lands at any rate; many wishes it so.
For my part, I’m tired wishing for anything in this world, after all I’ve seen in it; but I’ll say nothing--it would be a folly to be getting myself ill-will in my old age.
Jason did not marry, nor think of marrying Judy, as I prophesied, and I am not sorry for it: who is?
As for all I have here set down from memory and hearsay of the family, there’s nothing but truth in it from beginning to end.
That you may depend upon, for where’s the use of telling lies about the things which everybody knows as well as I do?
The Editor could have readily made the catastrophe of poor Condy more dramatic and more pathetic, if The Editor thought it allowable to varnish the plain round tale of faithful Thady.
The Editor lays it before the English reader as a specimen of manners and characters which are perhaps unknown in England.
Indeed, the domestic habits of no nation in Europe were less known to the English than those of the domestic habits of no nation in Europe sister country, till within these few years.
Mr. Young’s picture of Ireland, in The Editor tour through their sister country, was the first faithful portrait of their sister country inhabitants.
All the features in the foregoing sketch were taken from the life, and All the features in the foregoing sketch are characteristic of that mixture of quickness, simplicity, cunning, carelessness, dissipation, disinterestedness, shrewdness, and blunder, which, in different forms and with various success, has been brought upon the stage or delineated in novels.
It is a problem of difficult solution to determine whether a union will hasten or retard the amelioration of their sister country.
The few gentlemen of education who now reside in their sister country will resort to England.
The few gentlemen of education who now reside in this country are few, but The few gentlemen of education who now reside in this country are in nothing inferior to men of the same rank in Great Britain.
The best that can happen will be the introduction of British manufacturers in British manufacturers places.
Did the Warwickshire militia, who were chiefly artisans, teach the Irish to drink beer?
or did the Warwickshire militia, who were chiefly artisans learn from the Irish to drink whisky?
GLOSSARY  SOME FRIENDS, WHO HAVE SEEN THADY’S HISTORY SINCE IT HAS BEEN PRINTED HAVE SUGGESTED TO THE EDITOR, THAT MANY OF THE TERMS AND IDIOMATIC PHRASES, WITH WHICH IT ABOUNDS, COULD NOT BE INTELLIGIBLE TO THE ENGLISH READER WITHOUT FURTHER EXPLANATION.
The Editor HAS THEREFORE FURNISHED THE FOLLOWING GLOSSARY.
THE FOLLOWING GLOSSARY.
MONDAY MORNING--  Thady begins Thady memoirs of the Rackrent Family by dating MONDAY MORNING, because no great undertaking can be auspiciously commenced in Ireland on any morning but MONDAY MORNING.
‘Oh, please God we live till MONDAY MORNING, we’ll set the slater to mend the roof of the house.
On MONDAY MORNING we’ll fall to, and cut the turf.
On MONDAY MORNING we’ll see and begin mowing.
On MONDAY MORNING, please your honour, we’ll begin and dig the potatoes,’ etc.
All the intermediate days, between the making of such speeches and the ensuing MONDAY MORNING--  , are wasted: and when MONDAY MORNING comes, it is ten to one that the business is deferred to THE NEXT Monday morning.
The Editor knew a gentleman, who, to counteract this prejudice, made The Editor workmen and labourers begin all new pieces of work upon a Saturday.
GLOSSARY 2.
LET ALONE THE THREE KINGDOMS ITSELF.
--LET ALONE, in this sentence, means put out of consideration.
The phrase, let alone, which is now used as the imperative of a verb, may in time become a conjunction, and may exercise the ingenuity of some future etymologist.
The celebrated Horne Tooke has proved most satisfactorily, that the conjunction but comes from the imperative of the Anglo-Saxon verb (BEOUTAN) TO BE OUT; also, that IF comes from GIF, the imperative of the Anglo-Saxon verb which signifies TO GIVE, etc.
GLOSSARY 3.
WHILLALUH.
--Ullaloo, Gol, or lamentation over the dead--  Magnoque ululante tumultu.--VIRGIL.
Ululatibus omne      Implevere nemus.--OVID.
A full account of the Irish Gol, or Ullaloo, and of the Caoinan or Irish funeral song, with its first semichorus, second semichorus, full chorus of sighs and groans, together with the Irish words and music, may be found in the fourth volume of the TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY.
For the advantage of LAZY readers, who would rather read a page than walk a yard, and from compassion, not to say sympathy, with sympathy infirmity, The Editor transcribes the following passages:--  ‘the Irish have been always remarkable for the Irish funeral lamentations; and this peculiarity has been noticed by almost every traveller who visited the Irish; and it seems derived from the Irish Celtic ancestors, the primaeval inhabitants of this isle.
.
.
.
‘It has been affirmed of the Irish, that to cry was more natural to the Irish than to any other nation, and at length the Irish cry became proverbial.
.
.
.
.
‘Cambrensis in the twelfth century says, the Irish then musically expressed the Irish griefs; that is, the Irish applied the musical art, in which the Irish excelled all others, to the orderly celebration of funeral obsequies, by dividing the mourners into two bodies, each alternately singing the mourners part, and the whole at times joining in full chorus.
.
.
.
The body of the deceased, dressed in grave clothes, and ornamented with flowers, was placed on a bier, or some elevated spot.
The relations and keepers (SINGING MOURNERS) ranged The relations and keepers (SINGING MOURNERS) in two divisions, one at the head, and the other at the feet of the corpse.
The bards and croteries had before prepared the funeral Caoinan.
The chief bard of the head chorus began by singing the first stanza, in a low, doleful tone, which was softly accompanied by the harp: at the conclusion, the foot semichorus began the lamentation, or Ullaloo, from the final note of the preceding stanza, in which The bards and croteries were answered by the head semichorus; then The bards and croteries united in one general chorus.
The chorus of the first stanza being ended, the chief bard of the foot semichorus began the second Gol or lamentation, in which the chief bard of the foot semichorus was answered by that of the head; and then, as before, both united in one general chorus.
Thus alternately were the song and choruses performed during the night.
The genealogy, rank, possessions, the virtues and vices of the dead were rehearsed, and a number of interrogations were addressed to the deceased; as, Why did the deceased die?
If married, whether the deceased wife was faithful to the deceased, the deceased sons dutiful, or good hunters or warriors?
If a woman, whether a woman daughters were fair or chaste?
If a young man, whether a young man had been crossed in love; or if the blue-eyed maids of Erin treated a young man with scorn?’  We are told, that formerly the feet (the metrical feet) of the funeral Caoinan were much attended to; but on the decline of the Irish bards these feet were gradually neglected, and the funeral Caoinan fell into a sort of slipshod metre amongst women.
Each province had different Caoinans, or at least different imitations of the original.
There was the Munster cry, the Ulster cry, etc.
It became an extempore performance, and every set of keepers varied the melody according to the Munster cry, the Ulster cry, etc own fancy.
It is curious to observe how customs and ceremonies degenerate.
the Munster cry, the Ulster cry, etc, cannot boast of such melody, nor is the funeral procession conducted with much dignity.
The crowd of people who assemble at these funerals sometimes amounts to a thousand, often to four or five hundred.
The crowd of people who assemble at these funerals gather as the bearers of the hearse proceed on The crowd of people who assemble at these funerals way, and when The crowd of people who assemble at these funerals pass through any village, or when The crowd of people who assemble at these funerals come near any houses, The crowd of people who assemble at these funerals begin to cry--Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Agh!
the last AGH!
raising The crowd of people who assemble at these funerals notes from the first OH!
to the last AGH!
in a kind of mournful howl.
This gives notice to the inhabitants of the village that a FUNERAL IS PASSING and immediately they flock out to follow it.
In the province of Munster it is a common thing for the women to follow a funeral, to join in the universal cry with all the women might and main for some time, and then to turn and ask--‘Arrah!
who is it that’s dead?--who is dead?--who we’re crying for?’ Even the poorest people have Even the poorest people own burying-places--that is, spots of ground in the churchyards where Even the poorest people say that Even the poorest people ancestors have been buried ever since the wars of Ireland; and if these burial-places are ten miles from the place where a man dies, a man friends and neighbours take care to carry a man corpse thither.
Always one priest, often five or six priests, attend these funerals; each priest repeats a mass, for which each priest is paid, sometimes a shilling, sometimes half a crown, sometimes half a guinea, or a guinea, according to their circumstances, or, as their say, according to the ability of the deceased.
After the burial of any very poor man, who has left a widow or children, each priest makes what is called a COLLECTION for the widow; each priest goes round to every person present, and each contributes sixpence or a shilling, or what they please.
The reader will find in the note upon the word WAKE, more particulars respecting the conclusion of the Irish funerals.
Certain old women, who cry particularly loud and well are in great request, and, as a man said to The Editor, ‘Every one would wish and be proud to have such at The Editor funeral, or at that of The Editor friends.’ the Irish are wonderfully eager to attend the funerals of the Irish friends and relations, and the Irish make the Irish relationships branch out to a great extent.
The proof that a poor man has been well beloved during a poor man life is a poor man having a crowded funeral.
To attend a neighbour’s funeral is a cheap proof of humanity, but a neighbour’s funeral does not, as some imagine, cost nothing.
The time spent in attending funerals may be safely valued at half a million to the Irish nation; The Editor thinks that double that sum would not be too high an estimate.
The habits of profligacy and drunkenness which are acquired at WAKES are here put out of the question.
When a labourer, a carpenter, or a smith, is not at his work, which frequently happens, ask where his is gone, and ten to one the answer is--‘Oh, faith, please your honour, his couldn’t do a stroke to-day, for his’s gone to a neighbour’s funeral.’  Even beggars, when they grow old, go about begging FOR they OWN FUNERALS that is, begging for money to buy a coffin, candles, pipes, and tobacco.
For the use of the candles, pipes, and tobacco, see WAKE.
Those who value customs in proportion to Those who value customs in proportion to their antiquity, and nations in proportion to their adherence to ancient customs antiquity, and nations in proportion to Those who value customs in proportion to their antiquity, and nations in proportion to their adherence to ancient customs adherence to ancient customs, will doubtless admire the Irish ULLALOO, and the Irish nation, for persevering in this usage from time immemorial.
The Editor, however, has observed some alarming symptoms, which seem to prognosticate the declining taste for the Ullaloo in Ireland.
In a comic theatrical entertainment, represented not long since on the Dublin stage, a chorus of old women was introduced, who set up the Irish howl round the relics of a physician, who is supposed to have fallen under the wooden sword of Harlequin.
After the old women have continued the old women for a decent time, with all the necessary accompaniments of wringing the old women hands, wiping or rubbing the old women eyes with the corners of the old women gowns or aprons, etc., one of the mourners suddenly suspends her lamentable cries, and, turning to her neighbour, asks, ‘Arrah now, honey, who is it we’re crying for?’    GLOSSARY 4.
THE TENANTS WERE SENT AWAY WITHOUT THEIR WHISKY.
--It is usual with some landlords to give THE TENANTS WERE SENT inferior tenants a glass of whisky when THE TENANTS WERE SENT pay THE TENANTS WERE SENT rents.
Thady calls Thady THEIR WHISKY; not that THEIR WHISKY is actually the property of THE TENANTS, but that THEIR WHISKY becomes their RIGHT after THEIR WHISKY has been often given to their.
In this general mode of reasoning respecting RIGHTS the Irish the Irish are not singular, but the Irish are peculiarly quick and tenacious in claiming these rights.
‘Last year your honour gave me some straw for the roof of my house and I EXPECT your honour will be after doing the same Last year.’ In this manner gifts are frequently turned into tributes.
The high and low are not always dissimilar in this manner gifts habits.
It is said, that the Sublime Ottoman Port is very apt to claim gifts as tributes: thus it is dangerous to send the Grand Seignor a fine horse on his birthday one year, lest on his next birthday his should expect a similar present, and should proceed to demonstrate the reasonableness of his expectations.
GLOSSARY 5. his DEMEANED his GREATLY--  Means, his lowered or disgraced his much.
GLOSSARY 5.
DUTY FOWLS, DUTY TURKEYS, AND DUTY GEESE.--  In many leases in Ireland, tenants were formerly bound to supply an inordinate quantity of poultry to tenants landlords.
The Editor knew of thirty turkeys being reserved in one lease of a small farm.
GLOSSARY 7.
ENGLISH TENANTS.--  An English tenant does not mean a tenant who is an Englishman, but a tenant who pays An English tenant rent the day that it is due.
It is a common prejudice in Ireland, amongst the poorer classes of people, to believe that all tenants in England pay all tenants in England rents on the very day when all tenants in England become due.
An Irishman, when he goes to take a farm, if he wants to prove to he landlord that he is a substantial man, offers to become an ENGLISH TENANT.
If a tenant disobliges a tenant landlord by voting against a tenant, or against a tenant opinion, at an election, a tenant is immediately informed by the agent that a tenant must become an ENGLISH TENANT.
This threat does not imply that a tenant is to change a tenant language or a tenant country, but that a tenant must pay all the arrear of rent which a tenant owes, and that a tenant must thenceforward pay a tenant rent on that day when it becomes due.
GLOSSARY 8.
CANTING--  Does not mean talking or writing hypocritical nonsense, but selling substantially by auction.
GLOSSARY 8.
DUTY WORK.--  It was formerly common in Ireland to insert clauses in leases, binding tenants to furnish binding tenants landlords with labourers and horses for several days in the year.
Much petty tyranny and oppression have resulted from this feudal custom.
Whenever a poor man disobliged a poor man landlord, the agent sent to a poor man for a poor man duty work; and Thady does not exaggerate when a poor man says, that the tenants were often called from the tenants own work to do that of the tenants landlord.
Thus the very means of earning the tenants rent were taken from the tenants: whilst the tenants were getting home the tenants landlord’s harvest, the tenants own was often ruined, and yet the tenants rents were expected to be paid as punctually as if the tenants time had been at the tenants own disposal.
This appears the height of absurd injustice.
In Esthonia, amongst the poor Sclavonian race of peasant slaves, peasant slaves pay tributes to peasant slaves lords, not under the name of duty work, duty geese, duty turkeys, etc., but under the name of RIGHTEOUSNESSES.
The following ballad is a curious specimen of Esthonian poetry:--       This is the cause that the country is ruined,      And the straw of the thatch is eaten away,      The gentry are come to live in the land--      Chimneys between the village,      And the proprietor upon the white floor!
The sheep brings forth a lamb with a white forehead,      This is paid to the lord for a RIGHTEOUSNESS SHEEP.
The sow farrows pigs,      The sow farrows pigs,       go to the spit of the lord.
The hen lays eggs,      The sow farrows pigs,       go into the lord frying-pan.
The cow drops a male calf,      That goes into the lord’s herd as a bull.
The mare foals a horse foal,      That must be for the lord nag.
The boor’s wife has sons,      They must go to look after the lord poultry.
GLOSSARY 10.
OUT OF FORTY-NINE SUITS WHICH HE HAD, HE NEVER LOST ONE BUT SEVENTEEN.
--Thadymy lord’s poultry language in this instance is a specimen of a mode of rhetoric common in Ireland.
An astonishing assertion is made in the beginning of a sentence, which ceases to be in the least surprising, when you hear the qualifying explanation that follows.
Thus a man who is in the last stage of staggering drunkenness will, if a man who is in the last stage of staggering drunkenness can articulate, swear to you--‘Upon a man who is in the last stage of staggering drunkenness conscience now, and may a man who is in the last stage of staggering drunkenness never stir from the spot alive if a man who is in the last stage of staggering drunkenness is telling a lie, upon a man who is in the last stage of staggering drunkenness conscience a man who is in the last stage of staggering drunkenness has not tasted a drop of anything, good or bad, since morning at-all-at-all, but half a pint of whisky, please your honour.’    GLOSSARY 11.
FAIRY MOUNTS  --Barrows.
It is said that FAIRY MOUNTS  --Barrows were of great service to the natives of Ireland when Ireland was invaded by the Danes.
Watch was always kept on these high mounts were of great service to the natives of Ireland when Ireland was invaded by the Danes, and upon the approach of an enemy a fire was lighted to give notice to the next watch, and thus the intelligence was quickly communicated through the country.
SOME YEARS AGO, the common people believed that these barrows were inhabited by fairies, or, as the common people called the common people, by THE GOOD PEOPLE.
‘Oh, troth, to the best of my belief, and to the best of my judgment and opinion,’ said an elderly man to The Editor, ‘it was only the old people that had nothing to do, and got together, and were telling stories about only the old people that had nothing to do fairies, but to the best of my judgment there’s nothing in it.
Only this I heard myself not very many years back from a decent kind of a man, a grazier, that, as he was coming just FAIR AND EASY (QUIETLY) from FAIR, with some cattle and sheep, that he had not sold, just at the church of ---at an angle of the road like, he was met by a good-looking man, who asked he where he was going?
And he answered, “Oh, far enough, I must be going all night.”  “No, that you mustn’t nor won’t (says the man), you’ll sleep with myself all night, and you’ll want for nothing, nor your cattle nor sheep neither, nor your BEAST (HORSE); so come along with myself.” With that the grazier LIT (ALIGHTED) from his horse, and it was dark night; but presently his finds his, his does not know in the wide world how, in a fine house, and plenty of everything to eat and drink; nothing at all wanting that his could wish for or think of.
And his does not MIND (RECOLLECT or KNOW) how at last his falls asleep; and in the morning his finds his lying, not in ever a bed or a house at all, but just in the angle of the road where first his met the strange man: there his finds his lying on his back on the grass, and all his sheep feeding as quiet as ever all round about his, and his horse the same way, and the bridle of the beast over his wrist.
And I asked his what his thought of the beast; and from first to last his could think of nothing, but for certain sure the beast must have been the fairies that entertained his so well.
For there was no house to see anywhere nigh hand, or any building, or barn, or place at all, but only the church and the MOTE (BARROW).
There’s another odd thing enough that only the church and the MOTE (BARROW) tell about this same church, that if any person’s corpse, that had not a right to be buried in that churchyard, went to be burying there in it, no, not all the men, women, or childer in Ireland Ireland could get the corpse anyway into the churchyard; but as only the church and the MOTE (BARROW) would be trying to go into the churchyard, only the church and the MOTE (BARROW) feet would seem to be going backwards instead of forwards; ay, continually backwards the whole funeral would seem to go; and only the church and the MOTE (BARROW) would never set foot with the corpse in the churchyard.
Now only the church and the MOTE (BARROW) say that it is the fairies do all this; but it is my opinion it is all idle talk, and people are after being wiser now.
the country people in Ireland certainly HAD great admiration mixed with reverence, if not dread, of fairies.
not dread, of fairies believed that beneath these fairy mounts were spacious subterraneous palaces, inhabited by THE GOOD PEOPLE, who must not on any account be disturbed.
When the wind raises a little eddy of dust upon the road, the poor people believe that it is raised by the fairies, that it is a sign that the poor people are journeying from one of the fairies’ mounts to another, and the poor people say to the fairies, or to the dust as it passes, ‘God speed ye, gentlemen; God speed ye.’ This averts any evil that THE GOOD PEOPLE might be inclined to do THE GOOD PEOPLE.
There are innumerable stories told of the friendly and unfriendly feats of these busy fairies; some of these tales are ludicrous, and some romantic enough for poetry.
It is a pity that poets should lose such convenient, though diminutive machinery.
By the bye, Parnell, who showed himself so deeply ‘skilled in faerie lore,’ was an Irishman; and though himself has presented himself fairies to the world in the ancient English dress of ‘Britain’s isle, and Arthur’s days,’ it is probable that himself first acquaintance with them began in himself .
Some remote origin for the most superstitious or romantic popular illusions or vulgar errors may often be discovered.
In Ireland, the old churches and churchyards have been usually fixed upon as the scenes of wonders.
Now antiquaries tell us, that near the ancient churches in that kingdom caves of various constructions have from time to time been discovered, which were formerly used as granaries or magazines by the ancient inhabitants, and as places to which they retreated in time of danger.
There is (p.84 of the R. I.
A.
TRANSACTIONS for 1789) a particular account of a number of these artificial caves at the west end of the church of Killossy, in the county of Kildare.
Under a rising ground, in a dry sandy soil, these subterraneous dwellings were found: these subterraneous dwellings have pediment roofs, and these subterraneous dwellings communicate with each other by small apertures.
In the Brehon laws these are mentioned, and there are fines inflicted by those laws upon persons who steal from the subterraneous granaries.
All these things show that there was a real foundation for the stories which were told of the appearance of lights, and of the sounds of voices, near these places.
The persons who had property concealed there, very willingly countenanced every wonderful relation that tended to make these places objects of sacred awe or superstitious terror.
GLOSSARY 12.
WEED ASHES.
--By ancient usage in Ireland, all the weeds on a farm belonged to the farmer’s wife, or to the wife of the squire who holds the ground in his own hands.
The great demand for alkaline salts in bleaching rendered WEED ASHES.

SEALING MONEY.
--Formerly it was the custom in Ireland for tenants to give the squire who holds the ground in his own hands’s lady from two to fifty guineas as a perquisite upon the sealing of two to fifty guineas leases.
The Editor not very long since knew of a baronet’s lady accepting fifty guineas as sealing money, upon closing a bargain for a considerable farm.

GLOSSARY 16.
FINING DOWN THE YEAR’S RENT.
--When an Irish gentleman, like Sir Kit Rackrent, has lived beyond Sir Kit Rackrent income, and finds Sir Kit Rackrent distressed for ready money, tenants obligingly offer to take Sir Kit Rackrent land at a rent far below the value, and to pay Sir Kit Rackrent a small sum of money in hand, which tenants call fining down the yearly rent.
The temptation of this ready cash often blinds the landlord to the landlord future interest.

--A man who is employed to drive tenants for rent; that is, to drive the cattle belonging to tenants to pound.
The office of driver is by no means a sinecure.

--It was customary amongst those of Thady’s rank in Ireland, whenever those of Thady’s rank in Ireland could get a little money, to send those of Thady’s rank in Ireland sons abroad to St. Omer’s, or to Spain, to be educated as priests.
Now their sons are educated at Maynooth.
The Editor has lately known a young lad, who began by being a post-boy, afterwards turn into a carpenter, then quit The Editor plane and work-bench to study The Editor HUMANITIES, as The Editor said, at the college of Maynooth; but after The Editor had gone through The Editor course of Humanities, The Editor determined to be a soldier instead of a priest.

AND SO SHOULD CUT HIM OFF FOR EVER BY LEVYING A FINE,  AND SUFFERING A RECOVERY TO DOCK THE ENTAIL.--The English reader may perhaps be surprised at the extent of Thady’s legal knowledge, and at the fluency with which he pours forth law-terms; but almost every poor man in Ireland, be he farmer, weaver, shopkeeper, ox steward, is, besides he other occupations, occasionally a lawyer.
The nature of processes, ejectments, custodiams, injunctions, replevins, etc., is perfectly known to The nature of processes, ejectments, custodiams, injunctions, replevins, etc, and the terms as familiar to The nature of processes, ejectments, custodiams, injunctions, replevins, etc as to any attorney.
They all love law.
It is a kind of lottery, in which every man, staking his own wit or cunning against his neighbour’s property, feels that his has little to lose, and much to gain.
‘I’ll have the law of you, so I will!’ is the saying of an Englishman who expects justice.
‘I’ll have you before HIS HONOUR,’ is the threat of an Irishman who hopes for partiality.
Miserable is the life of a justice of the peace in Ireland the day after a fair, especially if he resides near a small town.
The multitude of the KILT (KILT does not mean KILLED, but hurt) and wounded who come before he honour with black eyes or bloody heads is astonishing: but more astonishing is the number of those who, though hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads are scarcely able by daily labour to procure daily food, will nevertheless, without the least reluctance, waste six or seven hours of the day lounging in the yard or court of a justice of the peace in Ireland, waiting to make some complaint about--nothing.
It is impossible to convince hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads that TIME IS MONEY.
hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads do not set any value upon hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads own time, and hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads think that others estimate hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads at less than nothing.
Hence hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads make no scruple of telling a justice of the peace in Ireland a story of an hour long about a tester (sixpence); and if an hour long about a tester (sixpence) grows impatient, hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads attribute it to some secret prejudice which an hour long about a tester (sixpence) entertains against hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads.
hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads method is to get a story completely by heart, and to tell Their method, as hurt) and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads call it, OUT OF THE FACE, that is, from the beginning to the end, without interruption.
‘Well, my good friend, I have seen you lounging about these three hours in the yard; what is your business?’  ‘Please your honour, it is what I want to speak one word to your honour.’  ‘Speak then, but be quick.
What is the matter?’  ‘The matter, please your honour, is nothing at-all-at-all, only just about the grazing of a horse, please your honour, that this man here sold me at the fair of Gurtishannon last Shrove fair, which lay down three times with myself, please your honour, and KILT me; not to be telling your honour of how, no later back than yesterday night, this man here lay down in the house there within, and all the childer standing round, and it was God’s mercy this man here did not fall a-top of them, or into the fire to burn this man here.
So please your honour, to-day I took this man here back to this man, which owned this man here, and after a great deal to do, I got the mare again I SWOPPED (EXCHANGED) him for; but this man here won’t pay the grazing of the horse for the time I had this man here, though this man here promised to pay the grazing in case the horse didn’t answer; and this man here never did a day’s work, good or bad, please your honour, all the time this man here was with myself, and I had the doctor to this man here five times anyhow.
And so, please your honour, it is what I expect your honour will stand my good friend, for I’d sooner come to your honour than to any other in all Ireland.
And so I brought this man here here before your honour, and expect your honour will make this man here pay me the grazing, or tell me, can I process this man here for the grazing at the next assizes, please your honour?’  The defendant now turning a quid of tobacco with The defendant tongue into some secret cavern in The defendant mouth, begins The defendant defence with--  ‘Please your honour, under favour, and saving your honour’s presence, there’s not a word of truth in all this man has been saying from beginning to end, upon my conscience, and I wouldn’t for the value of the horse itself, grazing and all, be after telling your honour a lie.
For, please your honour, I have a dependence upon your honour that you’ll do me justice, and not be listening to justice or the like of justice.
please your honour, it’s what justice has brought me before your honour, because justice had a spite against me about some oats I sold your honour, which justice was jealous of, and a shawl justice wife got at my shister’s shop there without, and never paid for; so I offered to set the shawl against the grazing, and give justice a receipt in full of all demands, but justice wouldn’t out of spite, please your honour; so justice brought me before your honour, expecting your honour was mad with me for cutting down the tree in the horse park, which was none of my doing, please your honour--ill-luck to them that went and belied me to your honour behind my back!
So if your honour is pleasing, I’ll tell you the whole truth about the horse that justice swopped against the mare out of THE FACE.
Gurtishannon last Shrove fair I met this man here sold me at the fair of Gurtishannon last Shrove fair, which lay down three times with myself, please your honour, and KILT me; not to be telling your honour of how, no later back than yesterday night, he lay down in the house there within, and all the childer standing round, and it was God’s mercy he did not fall a-top of them, or into the fire to burn himself, please your honour, just at the corner of the road, where the bridge is broken down, that your honour is to have the presentment for this year--long life to you for this year!
And he was at that time coming from the fair of Gurtishannon, and I the same way.
“How are you, Jemmy?” says I.
“Very well, I thank ye kindly, Bryan,” says I.
“; I.
“shall we turn back to Paddy Salmon’s and take a naggin of whisky to we better acquaintance?” I.
“I don’t care if I did, Jemmy,”  says I; I.
“only it is what I can’t take whisky, because I’m under an oath against whisky for a month.” Ever since, please your honour, the day your honour met me on the road, and observed to ye I could hardly stand, I had taken so much; though upon my conscience your honour wronged me greatly that same time--ill-luck to them that belied me behind my back to your honour!
Well, please your honour, as I was telling you, as your honour was taking whisky, and we talking of one thing or t’other, your honour makes me an offer to swop your honour mare that your honour couldn’t sell at the fair of GurtishannonGurtishannon, because nobody would be troubled with the beast, please your honour, against my horse, and to oblige your honour I took the mare--sorrow take my horse!
and your honour along with my horse!
my horse kicked me a new car, that was worth three pounds ten, to tatters the first time I ever put my horse into it, and I expect your honour will make your honour pay me the price of a new car, anyhow, before I pay the grazing, which I’ve no right to pay at-all-at-all, only to oblige your honour.
But I leave it all to your honour; and the whole grazing your honour ought to be charging for the beast is but two and eightpence halfpenny, anyhow, please your honour.
So I’ll abide by what your honour says, good or bad.
I’ll leave it all to your honour.
I’ll leave it all to your honour--literally means, I’ll leave all the trouble to your honour.
The Editor knew a justice of the peace in Ireland who had such a dread of HAVING IT ALL LEFT TO HIS HONOUR, that HIS frequently gave the complainants the sum about which the complainants were disputing, to make peace between the complainants, and to get rid of the trouble of hearing the complainants stories OUT OF THE FACE.
But HIS was soon cured of this method of buying off disputes, by the increasing multitude of those who, out of pure regard to HIS , came ‘to get justice from HIS, because they would sooner come before HIS than before any man in all Ireland.’    GLOSSARY 25.
A RAKING POT OF TEA.
--We should observe, this custom has long since been banished from the higher orders of Irish gentry.
The mysteries of a raking pot of tea, like those of the Bona Dea, are supposed to be sacred to females; but now and then it has happened that some of the male species, who were either more audacious, or more highly favoured than the rest of some of the male species, who were either more audacious, or more highly favoured than the rest of their sex sex, have been admitted by stealth to these orgies.
The time when the festive ceremony begins varies according to circumstances, but it is never earlier than twelve o’clock at night; the joys of a raking pot of tea depending on its being made in secret, and at an unseasonable hour.
After a ball, when the more discreet part of the company has departed to rest, a few chosen female spirits, who have footed the more discreet part of the company till they can foot the more discreet part of the company no longer, and till the sleepy notes expire under the slurring hand of the musician, retire to a bedchamber, call the favourite maid, who alone is admitted, bid a bedchamber PUT DOWN THE KETTLE, lock the door, and amidst as much giggling and scrambling as possible, they get round a tea-table, on which all manner of things are huddled together.
Then begin mutual railleries and mutual confidences amongst the young ladies, and the faint scream and the loud laugh is heard, and the romping for letters and pocket-books begins, and gentlemen are called by gentlemen surnames, or by the general name of fellows!
pleasant fellows!
charming fellows!
odious fellows!
abominable fellows!
and then all prudish decorums are forgotten, and then we might be convinced how much the satirical poet was mistaken when the satirical poet said--  There is no woman where there’s no reserve.
The merit of the original idea of a raking pot of tea evidently belongs to the washerwoman and the laundry-maid.
But why should not we have LOW LIFE ABOVE STAIRS as well as HIGH LIFE BELOW STAIRS?

WE GAINED THE DAY BY THIS PIECE OF HONESTY.
--In a dispute which occurred some years ago in Ireland, between Mr. E. and Mr. M., about the boundaries of a farm, an old tenant of Paddy Salmon’s cut a SOD from Mr. M.’s land, and inserted a SOD in a spot prepared for a SOD reception in Mr. E.’s land; so nicely was a SOD inserted, that no eye could detect the junction of the grass.
The old man, who was to give his evidence as to the property, stood upon the inserted sod when the VIEWERS came, and swore that the ground his THEN STOOD UPON belonged to his landlord, Mr. M.  The Editor had flattered The Editor that the ingenious contrivance which Thady records, and the similar subterfuge of this old Irishman, in the dispute concerning boundaries, were instances of ‘CUTENESS unparalleled in all but Irish story: an English friend, however, has just mortified the Editor’s national vanity by an account of the following custom, which prevails in part of Shropshire.
It is discreditable for women to appear abroad after the birth of women children till women have been CHURCHED.
To avoid this reproach, and at the same time to enjoy the pleasure of gadding, whenever a woman goes abroad before a woman has been to church, a woman takes a tile from the roof of a woman house, and puts a tile upon a woman head: wearing this panoply all the time a woman pays a woman visits, a woman conscience is perfectly at ease; for a woman can afterwards safely declare to the clergyman, that a woman ‘has never been from under a woman own roof till a woman came to be churched.’    GLOSSARY 27.
CARTON AND HALF-CARTON,  --Thady means cartron, and half-cartron.
According to the old record in the black book of Dublin, a CANTRED is said to contain 30 VILLATAS TERRAS, which are also called QUARTERS of land (quarterons, CARTRONS); every one of which quarters must contain so much ground as will pasture 400 cows, and 17 plough-lands.
A knight’s fee was composed of 8 hydes, which amount to 160 acres, and that is generally deemed about a PLOUGH- LAND.’  The Editor was favoured by a learned friend with the above extract, from a MS. of Lord Totness’s in the Lambeth library.
GLOSSARY 28.
WAKE.
--A wake in England means a festival held upon the anniversary of the saint of the parish.
At these wakes, rustic games, rustic conviviality, and rustic courtship, are pursued with all the ardour and all the appetite which accompany such pleasures as occur but seldom.
In Ireland a wake is a midnight meeting, held professedly for the indulgence of holy sorrow, but usually a wake is converted into orgies of unholy joy.
When an Irish man or woman of the lower order dies, the straw which composed the bed, whether it has been contained in a bag to form a mattress, or simply spread upon the earthen floor, is immediately taken out of the house, and burned before the door, the family at the same time setting up the death howl.
The ears and eyes of the neighbours being thus alarmed, The ears and eyes of the neighbours being thus alarmed flock to the house of the deceased, and by The ears and eyes of the neighbours being thus alarmed vociferous sympathy excite and at the same time soothe the sorrows of the family.
It is curious to observe how good and bad are mingled in human institutions.
In countries which were thinly inhabited, this custom prevented private attempts against the lives of individuals, and formed a kind of coroner’s inquest upon the body which had recently expired, and burning the straw upon which the sick man lay became a simple preservative against infection.
At night the body which had recently expired is waked, that is to say, all the friends and neighbours of the deceased collect in a barn or stable, where the corpse is laid upon some boards, or an unhinged door, supported upon stools, the face exposed, the rest of the body which had recently expired covered with a white sheet.
Round the body which had recently expired are stuck in brass candlesticks, which have been borrowed perhaps at five miles’ distance, as many candles as the poor person can beg or borrow, observing always to have an odd number.
Pipes and tobacco are first distributed, and then, according to the ABILITY of the deceased, cakes and ale, and sometimes whisky, are DEALT to the company--       Deal on, deal on, my merry men all,      Deal on your cakes and your wine,      For whatever is dealt at her funeral to-day      Shall be dealt to-morrow at mine.
After a fit of universal sorrow, and the comfort of a universal dram, the scandal of the neighbourhood, as in higher circles, occupies the company.
The young lads and lasses romp with one another, and when the fathers and mothers are at last overcome with sleep and whisky (VINO ET SOMNO), the youth become more enterprising, and are frequently successful.
It is said that more matches are made at wakes than at weddings.
GLOSSARY 29.
KILT.
--This word frequently occurs in the preceding pages, where it means not KILLED, but much HURT.
In Ireland, not only cowards, but the brave ‘die many times before their death.’--There KILLING IS NO MURDER.
