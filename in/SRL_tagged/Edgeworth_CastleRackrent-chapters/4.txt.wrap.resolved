 As a rule people’s books appeal first to one’s imagination, and then after a time, if ’s books are good books and alive, not stuffed dummies and reproductions, one begins to divine the writers themselves, hidden away in the writers themselves pages, and wrapped up in the writers themselves hot-press sheets of paper; and so it happened by chance that a printed letter once written by Maria Edgeworth to Mrs. Barbauld set the present reader wondering about these two familiar names, and trying to realise the human beings which they each represented. Since those days Maria Edgeworth Maria Edgeworth has become a personage more vivid and interesting than any of Maria Edgeworth characters, more familiar even than ‘Simple Susan’ or ‘Rosamond of the Purple Jar.’ Maria Edgeworth has seemed little by little to grow into a friend, as the writer has learnt to know Maria Edgeworth more and more intimately, has visited the home of that home-loving woman, has held in Maria Edgeworth hands the delightful Family Memoirs, has seen the horizons, so to speak, of Maria Edgeworth’s long life. [Now published and edited by Mr. Hare (Nov. 1894).] Several histories of Maria Edgeworth Maria Edgeworth have been lately published in England. Miss Zimmern and Miss Oliver in America have each written, and the present writer has written, and various memoirs and letters have appeared in different magazines and papers with allusions and descriptions all more or less interesting. One can but admire the spirit which animated that whole existence; the cheerful, kindly, multiplied interest Maria Edgeworth took in the world outside, as well as in the wellbeing of all those around Maria Edgeworth. Generations, changes, new families, new experiences, none of Generations, changes, new families, new experiences overwhelmed Maria Edgeworth. Maria Edgeworth seemed to move in a crowd, a cheerful, orderly crowd, keeping in tune and heart with its thousand claims; with strength and calmness of mind to bear multiplied sorrows and a variety of care with courage, and an ever-reviving gift of spirited interest. Maria Edgeworth history is almost unique in Maria Edgeworth curious relationships; Maria Edgeworth changes of step-mothers, Maria Edgeworth warm family ties, Maria Edgeworth grasp of certain facts which belong to all time rather than to the hour itself. Maria Edgeworth lived for over eighty years, busy, beneficent, modest, and intelligent to the last. When Maria Edgeworth died Maria Edgeworth was mourned as unmarried women of eighty are not often mourned.  The present owner of Edgeworthstown told us that The present owner of Edgeworthstown could just remember Maria Edgeworth, lying dead upon Maria Edgeworth bed, and Maria Edgeworth face upon the pillow, and the sorrowful tears of the household; and how The present owner of Edgeworthstown and the other little children were carried off by a weeping aunt into the woods, to comfort and distract the other little children on the funeral day. The present owner of Edgeworthstown also told us of an incident prior to this event which should not be overlooked. How The present owner of Edgeworthstown himself, being caught red-handed, at the age of four or thereabouts, with The present owner of Edgeworthstown hands in a box of sugar-plums, had immediately confessed the awful fact that The present owner of Edgeworthstown had been about to eat them, and The present owner of Edgeworthstown was brought then and there before The present owner of Edgeworthstown Aunt Maria for sentence. his Aunt Maria at once decided that The present owner of Edgeworthstown had behaved Nobly in speaking the truth, and that The present owner of Edgeworthstown must be rewarded in kind for The present owner of Edgeworthstown praiseworthy conduct, and be allowed to keep the sugar-plums!  This little story after half a century certainly gives one pleasure still to recall, and proves, I think, that cakes may be enjoyed long after cakes have been eaten, and also that there is a great deal to be said for justice with lollipops in the scale. But what would Rosamond’s parents have thought of such a decision? One shudders to think of Rosamond’s parents disapproval, or of that of dear impossible Mr. Thomas Day, with The present owner of Edgeworthstown trials and experiments of melted sealing-wax upon little girls’ bare arms, and The present owner of Edgeworthstown glasses of tar-water so inflexibly administered. Miss Edgeworth, who suffered from her eyes, recalls how dear impossible Mr. Thomas Day used to bring the dose, the horrible tar-water, every morning with a ‘Drink this, Miss Maria!’ and how her dared not resist, though her thought her saw something of kindness and pity beneath all dear impossible Mr. Thomas Day apparent severity.  Severity was the order of those times. The reign of sugar-plums had scarcely begun. The reign of sugar-plums was not, as now, only ignorance and fanaticism that encouraged the giving of pain, it was the universal custom. People were still hanged for stealing, women were still burnt--so we have been assured--in St. Stephen’s Green; though, it is true, women were considerately strangled first. Children were bullied and tortured with the kindest intentions; even Maria Edgeworth at Maria Edgeworth fashionable school was stretched in a sort of machine to make Maria Edgeworth grow; dear impossible Mr. Thomas Day, as we know, to please the lady of even Maria Edgeworth at her fashionable school affections, passed eight hours a day in the stocks in order to turn out even Maria Edgeworth at her fashionable school knock-knees. One feels that a generation of ladies and gentlemen who submitted to such inflictions surely belonged to a race of heroes and heroines, and that, if the times were difficult and trying, the people also were stronger to endure the people, and must have been much better fitted with nerves than we are.  Miss Edgeworth’s life has been so often told that I will not attempt to recapitulate the story at any length. Maria Edgeworth well deserved Maria Edgeworth reputation. Maria Edgeworth thoughts were good, Maria Edgeworth English was good, Maria Edgeworth stories had the charm of sincerity, and Maria Edgeworth audience of children was a genuine audience, less likely to be carried away by fashion than more advanced critics might be. There is a curious matter-of-fact element in all Maria Edgeworth wrote, combined with extraordinary quickness and cleverness; and it must be remembered, in trying to measure Maria Edgeworth place in literature, that in Maria Edgeworth day the whole great school of English philosophical romance was in the whole great school of English philosophical romance cradle; George Eliot was not in existence; my father was born in the year in which THE ABSENTEE was published. Sir Walter Scott has told us that it was Miss Edgeworth’s writing which first suggested to Sir Walter Scott the idea of writing about Scotland and Scotland national life. Tourgenieff in the same way says that Tourgenieff was after reading Tourgenieff books on Ireland that Sir Walter Scott began to write of Sir Walter Scott own country and of Russian peasants as Sir Walter Scott did. Edgeworth was the creator of Edgeworth own special world of fiction, though the active Mr. Edgeworth crossed the t’s and dotted the i’s, interpolated, expurgated, to Sir Walter Scott own and Maria’s satisfaction. Edgeworth was essentially a modest woman; Edgeworth gratefully accepted Sir Walter Scott criticism and emendations. Mr. Clark Russell quotes Sydney Smith, who declared that the active Mr. Edgeworth must have written or burst. ‘A discharge of ink was an evacuation absolutely necessary to avoid fatal and plethoric congestion.’ The only wonder is that, considering all they went through, Maria’s stories survived to tell they tale, and to tell it so well, with directness and conviction, that best of salt in any literary work. A letter Maria wrote to his daughter cousin will be remembered. ‘I beg, dear Sophy,’ his daughter says, ‘that you will not call my stories by the sublime name of my works; I shall else be ashamed when the little mouse comes forth.’  Maria’s correspondence is delightful, and conveys us right away into that bygone age. The figures rapidly move across his daughter scene, talking and unconsciously describing The figures as The figures go; you see The figures through the eyes of the observant little lady. his daughter did not go very deep; his daughter seems to me to have made kindly acquaintance with some, to have admired others with artless enthusiasm. I don’t think his daughter troubled his daughter much about complication of feeling; his daughter liked people to make repartees, or to invent machines, to pay people bills, and to do people duty in a commonplace and cheerfully stoical fashion. But then Maria Edgeworth certainly did not belong to our modern schools, sipping the emetic goblet to give flavour to daily events, nor to that still more alarming and spreading clique of DEGENERES who insist upon administering such doses to others to relieve the tedium of the road of life.  Perhaps us in us time scarcely do justice to Miss Maria Edgeworth’s extraordinary cleverness and brightness of apprehension. There is more fun than humour in his daughter work, and those were the days of good rollicking jokes and laughter. Details change so quickly that it is almost impossible to grasp entirely the aims and intentions of a whole set of people just a little different from us in every single thing; who held people heads differently, who pointed people toes differently, who addressed each other in a language just a little unlike us own. The very meanings of the words shift from one generation to another, and us are perhaps more really in harmony with us great-great-grandfathers than with the more immediate generations.  his daughter society was charming, so every one agrees; and his daughter acquaintance with all the most remarkable men of his daughter time must not be forgotten, nor the genuine regard with which his daughter inspired all who came across his daughter path.  ‘In external appearance his daughter is quite the fairy of our nursery tale, the WHIPPETY STOURIE, if you remember such a sprite, who came flying through the window to work all sorts of marvels,’ writes Sir Walter. ‘I will never believe but what his daughter has a wand in his daughter pocket, and pulls a wand out to conjure a little before his daughter begins those very striking pictures of manners.’  Among others Sir William Hamilton has left a pleasing description of Edgeworth. ‘If you would study and admire his daughter as his daughter deserves, you must see his daughter at home,’ says Sir William Hamilton, ‘and hear his daughter talk. his daughter knows an infinite number of anecdotes about interesting places and persons, which his daughter tells extremely well, and never except when they arise naturally out of the subject. . . . To crown his daughter merits, his daughter seemed to take a prodigious fancy to Sir William Hamilton, and promised to be at home, and made me promise to be at Edgeworthstown for a fortnight some time next vacation.’ We owe to Edgeworthstown also an amusing sketch of some other collateral members of the family; the fine animated old lady, who immediately gets Edgeworthstown to explain the reason why a concave mirror inverts while a convex mirror leaves them erect; the young ladies, one of whom was particularly anxious to persuade Edgeworthstown that the roundness of the planets was produced by friction, perhaps by them being shaken together like marbles in a bag.  There is also an interesting letter from Sir W. Hamilton at Edgeworthstown on 23rd September 1829. Wordsworth is also staying there. ‘After some persuasion Francis and I succeed in engaging Wordsworth in many very interesting conversations. Edgeworth Maria Edgeworth has had for some time a very serious illness, but Edgeworth was able to join We for dinner the day that I arrived, and Edgeworth exhibited in Edgeworth conversations with Wordsworth a good deal of Edgeworth usual brilliancy; Edgeworth also engaged Mr. Marshall in some long conversations upon Ireland, and even Mr. Marshall’s son, whose talent for silence seems to be so very profound, was thawed a little on Monday evening, and discussed after tea the formation of the solar system. Edgeworth tells me that Edgeworth is at last employed in writing for the public after a long interval, but does not expect to have Edgeworth work soon ready for publication.’ [There is a curious criticism of Edgeworth by Robert Hall, the great preacher, which should not be passed over. ‘As to Edgeworth style,’ he says, ‘Edgeworth is simple and elegant, content to convey Edgeworth thoughts in their most plain and natural form, that is indeed the perfection of style. . . . In point of tendency,’ he continues, ‘I should class Edgeworth books among the most irreligious I ever read. . . . Edgeworth does not attack religion nor inveigh against religion, but makes religion appear unnecessary by exhibiting perfect virtue without religion. . . . No works ever produced so bad an effect on my own mind as hers.’]  Besides Wordsworth and Sir William Hamilton and Mr. Marshall, we presently come to Sir John Herschell. ‘I saw your admirable friend Miss Maria Edgeworth lately in town,’ your admirable friend Miss Edgeworth writes to Sir William Hamilton; ‘your admirable friend Miss Edgeworth is a most warm admirer of yours, and praise such as your admirable friend Miss Edgeworth is what any man might be proud of.’ Later on Edgeworth, corresponding with Sir W. Hamilton, tells Sir W. Hamilton she is ill and forbidden to write, or even to think. This is what she thinks of THINKING: ‘I am glad to see that the severe sciences do not destroy the energy and grace of the imagination, but only chasten the severe sciences and impart the severe sciences philosophical influence.’
