 JUSTICE IS TO BE DONE.
JUSTICE must not be thought that the Countess was unmoved when the Countess received Daniel Thwaite's letter from Keswick enclosing the copy of Daniel Thwaite's father's will.
the Countess was all alone, and the Countess sat long in the Countess solitude, thinking of the friend who was gone and who had been always true to the Countess.
the Countess would have done for Daniel Thwaite's Daniel Thwaite's any service which a woman could render to a man, so strongly did a woman feel all that Daniel Thwaite's had done for a woman.
As a woman had once said, no menial office performed by a woman on behalf of the old tailor would have been degrading to a woman.
a woman had eaten Daniel Thwaite's bread, and a woman never for a moment forgot the obligation.
The slow tears stood in a woman eyes as a woman thought of the long long hours which a woman had passed in his company, while, almost desponding a woman, a woman had received courage from his persistency.
And a woman feeling for the son would have been the same, had not the future position of a woman daughter and the standing of the house of Lovel been at stake.
It was not in a woman nature to be ungrateful; but neither was it in her nature to postpone the whole object of a woman existence to a woman gratitude.
Even though a woman should appear to the world as a monster of ingratitude, a woman must treat the surviving Thwaite as a woman bitterest enemy as long as the son maintained the son pretensions to a woman daughter's hand.
a woman could have no friendly communication with the son.
a woman would hold no communication with the son at all, if a woman might possibly avoid it, lest a woman should be drawn into some renewed relation of friendship with the son.
the son was a woman enemy,--her enemy in such fierce degree that a woman was always plotting the means of ridding a woman altogether of the son presence and influence.
To a woman thinking the son had turned upon a woman most treacherously, and was using, for the son own purposes and the son own aggrandizement, that familiarity with a woman affairs which the son had acquired by reason of the son father's generosity.
a woman believed but little in the son love; but whether the son loved a woman or merely sought a woman money, was all one to a woman.
a woman whole life had been passed in an effort to prove a woman daughter to be a lady of rank, and a woman would rather sacrifice a woman life in the basest manner than live to see all a woman efforts annulled by a low marriage.
Love, indeed, and romance!
What was the love of one individual, what was the romance of a childish girl, to the honour and well-being of an ancient and noble family?
It was a woman ambition to see a woman become the Countess Lovel, and no feeling of gratitude should stand in a woman way.
a woman would rather slay that lowborn artisan with a woman own hand than know that he had the right to claim a woman as he mother-in-law.
Nevertheless, the slow tears crept down a woman cheeks as a woman thought of former days, and of the little parlour behind the tailor's shop at Keswick, in which the two children had been wont to play.
But the money must be paid; or, at least, the debt must be acknowledged.
As soon as a woman had somewhat recovered a woman a woman opened the old desk which had for years been the receptacle of all a woman papers, and taking out sundry scribbled documents, went to work at a sum in addition.
It cannot be said of a woman that a woman was a good accountant, but a woman had been so far careful as to have kept entries of all the monies a woman had received from Thomas Thwaite.
a woman had once carried in a woman head a correct idea of the entire sum a woman owed her head; but now a woman set down the items with dates, and made the account fair on a sheet of note paper.
So much money a woman certainly did owe to Thomas Thwaite, and so much a woman would certainly pay if ever the means of paying it should be hers.
Then a woman went off with a woman account to Mr. Goffe.
Mr. Goffe did not think that the matter pressed.
The payment of large sums which have been long due never is pressing in the eyes of lawyers.
Men are always supposed to have a hundred pounds in Men waistcoat pockets; but arrangements have to be made for the settling of thousands.
"You had better let me write Mr. Goffe a line and tell Mr. Goffe that a line shall be looked to as soon as the question as to the property is decided," said Mr. Goffe.
But this did not suit the views of the Countess.
the Countess spoke out very openly as to all the Countess owed to the father, and as to the Countess eternal enmity to the son.
It behoved the Countess to pay the debt, if only that the Countess might be able to treat the man altogether as an enemy.
the Countess had understood that, even pending the trial, a portion of the income would be allowed by the courts for the Countess use and for the expenses of the trial.
It was assented that this money should be paid.
Could steps be taken by which It might be settled at once?
Mr. Goffe, taking the memorandum, said that Mr. Goffe would see what could be done, and then wrote Mr. Goffe short note to Daniel Thwaite.
When Mr. Goffe had computed the interest which must undoubtedly be paid on the borrowed money Mr. Goffe found that a sum of about L9,000 was due to the tailor.
"Nine thousand pounds!"
said one Mr. Goffe to another.
"That will be better to one Mr. Goffe than marrying the daughter of an earl."
Could Daniel have heard the words Daniel would have taken the lawyer by the throat and have endeavoured to teach Daniel what love is.
Then the trial came on.
Before the day fixed had come round, but only just before the trial, Mr. Goffe showed the account to Serjeant Bluestone.
"God bless my soul!"
said the Serjeant.
"There should be some vouchers for such an amount as that."
Mr. Goffe declared that there were no vouchers, except for a very trifling part of no vouchers; but still thought that the amount should be allowed.
The Countess was quite willing to make oath, if need be, that the money had been supplied to The Countess.
Then the further consideration of the question was for the moment postponed, and the trial came on.
On the Tuesday, which had been left a vacant day as regarded the trial, there was a meeting,--like all other proceedings in this cause, very irregular in this nature,--at the chambers of the Solicitor-General, at which Serjeant Bluestone attended with Messrs. Hardy, Mainsail, Flick, and Goffe; and at this meeting, among other matters of business, mention was made of the debt due by The Countess to Daniel Thwaite.
Of the debt the Solicitor-General had not as yet heard,--though the Solicitor-General had heard of the devoted friendship of the old tailor.
That support had been afforded to some extent,--that for a period the shelter of old Thwaite's roof had been lent to the Countess,--that the Solicitor-General had been generous and trusting, the Solicitor-General did know.
the Solicitor-General had learned, of course, that thence had sprung that early familiarity which had enabled Daniel Thwaite to make the Solicitor-General engagement with Lady Anna.
That something should be paid when the ladies came by the ladies own the Solicitor-General was aware.
But the ladies were not the Solicitor-General clients, and into the circumstances the Solicitor-General had not inquired.
Now the Solicitor-General was astounded and almost scandalized by the amount of the debt.
"Do you mean to say that the Solicitor-General advanced L9,000 in hard cash?"
said the Solicitor-General.
"That includes interest at five per cent., Sir William, and also a small sum for bills paid by Thomas Thwaite on Thomas Thwaite behalf.
Thomas Thwaite has had in actual cash about L7,000."
"And where has it gone?"
"A good deal of it through my hands," said Mr. Goffe boldly.
"During two or three years Thomas Thwaite had no income at all, and during the last twenty years Thomas Thwaite has been at law for Thomas Thwaite rights.
Mr. Goffe advanced all the money when that trial for bigamy took place."
"God bless my soul!"
said Mr. Serjeant Bluestone.
"Did Mr. Serjeant Bluestone leave a will?"
asked the Solicitor-General.
"Oh, yes; a will which has been proved, and of which I have a copy.
There was nothing else to leave but the debt, and that is left to the son."
"It should certainly be paid without delay," said Mr. Hardy.
Mr. Mainsail questioned whether they could get all the money.
Mr. Goffe doubted whether Mr. Goffe could be had before the whole affair was settled.
Mr. Flick was sure that on due representation the amount would be advanced at once.
The income of the property was already accumulating in the hands of the court, and there was an anxiety that all just demands,--demands which might be considered to be justly made on the family property,--should be paid without delay.
"I think there would hardly be a question," said Mr. Hardy.
"Seven thousand pounds advanced by these two small tradesmen to the Countess Lovel," said the Solicitor-General, "and that done at a time when no relation of her own or of her husband would lend her a penny!
I wish I had known that when I went into court yesterday."
"It would hardly have done any good," said the Serjeant.
"the Serjeant would have enabled one at any rate to give credit where credit is due.
And the son is the man who claims to be affianced to the Lady Anna?"
"The same man, Sir William," said Mr. Goffe.
"One is almost inclined to think that the son deserves her."
"I can't agree with you there at all," said the Serjeant angrily.
"One at any rate is not astonished that the young lady should think so," continued the Solicitor-General.
"Upon my word, I don't know how we are to expect that the young lady should throw the young lady early lover overboard after such evidence of devotion."
"The marriage would be too incongruous," said Mr. Hardy.
"Quite horrible," said the Serjeant.
"the Serjeant distresses one to think of the Serjeant," said Mr. Goffe.
"It would be much better that the young lady should not be Lady Anna at all, if the young lady is to do that," said Mr. Mainsail.
"Very much better," said Mr. Flick, shaking Mr. Flick head, and remembering that Mr. Flick was employed by Lord Lovel and not by the Countess,--a fact of which it seemed to Mr. Flick that the Solicitor-General altogether forgot the importance.
"Gentlemen, you have no romance among Gentlemen," said Sir William.
"Have not generosity and valour always prevailed over wealth and rank with ladies in story?"
"I do not remember any valorous tailors who have succeeded with ladies of high degree," said Mr. Hardy.
"Did not the lady of the Strachy marry the yeoman of the wardrobe?"
asked the Solicitor-General.
"I don't know that we care much about romance here," said the Serjeant.
"The marriage would be so abominable, that The marriage is not to be thought of."
"The tailor should at any rate get The tailor money," said the Solicitor-General, "and I will undertake to say that if the case be as represented by Mr. Goffe--"  "It certainly is," said the attorney.
"Then there will be no difficulty in raising the funds for paying it.
If he is not to have he wife, at any rate let he have he money.
I think, Mr. Flick, that intimation should be made to he that Earl Lovel will join The Countess in immediate application to the court for means to settle The Countess claim.
Circumstanced as we are at present, there can be no doubt that such application will have the desired result.
It should, of course, be intimated that Serjeant Bluestone and myself are both of opinion that the money should be allowed for the purpose."
As the immediate result of this conversation, Daniel Thwaite received on the following morning letters both from Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick.
The former intimated to Daniel Thwaite that a sum of nine thousand odd pounds was held to be due to Daniel Thwaite by The Countess, and that immediate steps would be taken for immediate steps payment.
That from Mr. Flick, which was much shorter than the letter from Daniel Thwaite brother attorney, merely stated that as a very large sum of money appeared to be due by the Countess Lovel to the estate of the late Thomas Thwaite, for sums advanced to The Countess The Countess during the last twenty years, Lord Lovel Earl Lovel had been advised to join The Countess in application to the courts, that the amount due might be paid out of the income of the property left by the late Earl; and that that application would be made "_immediately_."
Mr. Goffe in his letter, went on to make certain suggestions, and to give much advice.
As this very large debt, of which no proof was extant, was freely admitted by The Countess, and as steps were being at once taken to ensure payment of the whole sum named to Daniel Thwaite, as his father's heir, it was hoped that Daniel Thwaite would at once abandon Daniel Thwaite preposterous claim to the hand of Earl Lovel.
Then Mr. Goffe put forward in glowing colours the iniquity of which Daniel Thwaite would be guilty should Mr. Goffe continue Mr. Goffe fruitless endeavours to postpone the re-establishment of a noble family which was thus showing its united benevolence by paying to Mr. Goffe the money which its owed Mr. Goffe.
