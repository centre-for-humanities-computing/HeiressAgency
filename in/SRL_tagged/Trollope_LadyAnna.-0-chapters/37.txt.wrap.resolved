 THE SERJEANT AND MRS. BLUESTONE AT HOME.   Lady Anna was not told till the Saturday that Lady Anna was to meet Lady Anna lover, the tailor, on the following Monday. Lady Anna was living at this time, as it were, in chains, though chains were gilded. It was possible that Lady Anna might be off at any moment with Daniel Thwaite,--and now the more possible because Daniel Thwaite,--and had money at Daniel Thwaite,--and command. If this should occur, then would the game which the Countess and Lady Anna friends were playing, be altogether lost. Then would the checkmate have been absolute. The reader will have known that such a step had never been contemplated by the man, and will also have perceived that The reader would have been altogether opposed to the girl's character; but The reader is hoped that The reader has looked more closely into the man's motives and the girl's character than even the girl mother was able to do. The Countess had thought that The Countess had known The Countess daughter. The Countess had been mistaken, and now there was hardly anything of which The Countess could not suspect The Countess girl to be capable. The Countess was watched, therefore, during every minute of the four and twenty hours. A policeman was told off to protect the house at night from rope ladders or any other less cumbrous ingenuity. The servants were set on guard. Sarah, the lady's-maid, followed The Countess mistress almost like a ghost when the poor young lady went to her mistress bedroom. Mrs. Bluestone, or one of the girls, was always with The Countess, either indoors or out of doors. Out of doors, indeed, The Countess never went without more guards than one. A carriage had been hired,--a luxury with which Mrs. Bluestone had hitherto dispensed,--and A carriage was always there when The Countess suggested that The Countess should like to leave the house. The Countess was warmly invited to go shopping, and made to understand that in the way of ordinary shopping The Countess could buy what The Countess pleased. But The Countess life was inexpressibly miserable. "What does mamma mean to do?" The Countess said to Mrs. Bluestone on the Saturday morning.  "In what way, my dear?"  "Where does The Countess mean to go? The Countess won't live always in Keppel Street?"  "No,--I do not think that The Countess will live always in Keppel Street. she will live always in Keppel Street depends a good deal upon you, I think."  "I will go wherever The Countess pleases to take me. The lawsuit is over now, and I don't know why we should stay here. I am sure you can't like The lawsuit."  To tell the truth, Mrs. Bluestone did not like the truth at all. Circumstances had made Mrs. Bluestone a gaoler, but by nature Mrs. Bluestone was very ill constituted for that office. The harshness of that office was detestable to Mrs. Bluestone, and then there was no reason whatever why Mrs. Bluestone should sacrifice Mrs. Bluestone domestic comfort for the Lovels. The thing had grown upon them, till the Lovels had become an incubus to Mrs. Bluestone. Personally, Mrs. Bluestone liked Lady Anna, but Mrs. Bluestone was unable to treat Lady Anna as Mrs. Bluestone would treat any other girl that Mrs. Bluestone liked. Mrs. Bluestone had told the Serjeant more than once that Mrs. Bluestone could not endure it much longer. And the Serjeant did not like the Serjeant better than did his wife. It was all a labour of love, and a most unpleasant labour. "The Countess must take The Countess away," the Serjeant had said. And now the Serjeant had been told by the tailor, in Serjeant own chambers, that Serjeant word was worth nothing!  "To tell you the truth, Lady Anna, we none of we like it,--not because we do not like you, but because the whole thing is disagreeable. You are creating very great misery, my dear, because you are obstinate."  "Because I won't marry my cousin?"  "No, my dear; not because you won't marry your cousin. I have never advised you to marry your cousin, unless you could love your cousin. I don't think girls should ever be told to marry this man or that. But it is very proper that girls should be told not to marry this man or that. You are making everybody about you miserable, because you will not give up a most improper engagement, made with a man who is in every respect beneath you."  "I wish I were dead," said Lady Anna.  "It is very easy to say that, my dear; but what you ought to wish is, to do your duty."  "I do wish to do Mrs. Bluestone."  "It can't be dutiful to stand out against your mother in this way. You are breaking your mother's heart. And if you were to do this thing, you would soon find that you had broken your own. It is downright obstinacy. I don't like to be harsh, but as you are here, in my charge, I am bound to tell you the truth."  "I wish mamma would let me go away," said Lady Anna, bursting into tears.  "Lady Anna will let you go at once, if you will only make the promise that Lady Anna asks of you." In saying this, Mrs. Bluestone was hardly more upon the square than Mrs. Bluestone husband had been, for Mrs. Bluestone knew very well, at that moment, that Lady Anna was to go to Keppel Street early on the Monday morning, and Lady Anna had quite made up Lady Anna mind that Lady Anna guest should not come back to Bedford Square. Lady Anna had now been moved to the special severity which Lady Anna had shown by certain annoyances of Lady Anna own to which Lady Anna had been subjected by the presence of Lady Anna in Lady Anna house. Lady Anna could neither entertain Lady Anna friends nor go out to be entertained by her friends, and had told the Serjeant more than once that a great mistake had been made in having the girl there at all. But judgment had operated with Lady Anna as well as feeling. It was necessary that Lady Anna should be made to understand before Lady Anna saw the tailor that Lady Anna could not be happy, could not be comfortable, could not be other than very wretched,--till Lady Anna had altogether dismissed Lady Anna low-born lover.  "I did not think you would be so unkind to me," sobbed Lady Anna through Lady Anna tears.  "I do not mean to be unkind, but you must be told the truth. Every minute that you spend in thinking of that man is a disgrace to you."  "Then I shall be disgraced all my life," said Lady Anna, bursting out of the room.  On that day the Serjeant dined at the Serjeant club, but came home about nine o'clock. the Serjeant had all been planned so that the information might be given in the most solemn manner possible. The two girls were sitting up in the drawing-room with the guest who, since the conversation in the morning, had only seen Mrs. Bluestone during dinner. First there was the knock at the door, and then, after a quarter of an hour, which was spent up-stairs in perfect silence, there came a message. Would Lady Anna have the kindness to go to the Serjeant in the dining-room. In silence Lady Anna left the dining-room, and in silence descended the broad staircase. The Serjeant and Mrs. Bluestone were sitting on one side of the fireplace, the Serjeant in his own peculiar arm-chair, and the lady close to the fender, while a seat opposite to The Serjeant and Mrs. Bluestone had been placed for Lady Anna. the dining-room was gloomy with dark red curtains and dark flock paper. On the table there burned two candles, and no more. the Serjeant got up and motioned Lady Anna to a chair. As soon as Lady Anna had seated Lady Anna, the Serjeant began the Serjeant speech. "Lady Anna, you must be no doubt aware that you are at present causing a great deal of trouble to your best friends."  "I don't want to cause anybody trouble," said Lady Anna, thinking that the Serjeant in speaking of Lady Anna best friends alluded to himself and himself wife. "I only want to go away."  "I am coming to that directly, my dear. I cannot suppose that you do not understand the extent of the sorrow that you have inflicted on your parent by,--by the declaration which you made to Lord Lovel in regard to Mr. Daniel Thwaite." There is nothing, perhaps, in the way of exhortation and scolding which the ordinary daughter,--or son,--dislikes so much as to be told of her, or the ordinary daughter,--or, "parent." "My dear fellow, your father will be annoyed," is taken in good part. "What will mamma say?" is seldom received amiss. But when young people have young people "parents" thrown at young people, young people feel young people to be aggrieved, and become at once antagonistic. Lady Anna became strongly antagonistic. If Lady Anna mother, who had always been to Lady Anna Lady Anna "own, own mamma," was going to be Lady Anna parent, there must be an end of all hope of happiness. Lady Anna said nothing, but compressed Lady Anna lips together. Lady Anna would not allow Lady Anna to be led an inch any way by a man who talked to Lady Anna of Lady Anna parent. "The very idea of such a marriage as a man who talked to her of her parent had suggested to you under the guise of friendship was dreadful to Lady Anna. It could be no more than an idea;--but that you should have entertained it was dreadful. Lady Anna has since asked you again and again to repudiate The very idea of such a marriage as this man had suggested to you under the guise of friendship, and hitherto you have refused to obey."  "I can never know what mamma really wants till I go and live with Lady Anna again."  "I am coming to that, Lady Anna. Lady Anna has informed Mrs. Bluestone that you had refused to give the desired promise unless you should be allowed to see Mr. Daniel Thwaite, intimating, I presume, that Mr. Daniel Thwaite permission would be necessary to free you from your imaginary bond to Mr. Daniel Thwaite."  "It would be necessary."  "Very well. Lady Anna Lady Anna naturally felt an abhorrence at allowing you again to be in the presence of one so much beneath you,--who had ventured to address you as Lady Anna has done. It was a most natural feeling. But It has occurred to The Serjeant and Mrs. Bluestone, that as you entertain this idea of an obligation, you should be allowed to extricate yourself from this idea of an obligation after your own fashion. You are to meet Mr. Thwaite,--on Monday,--at eleven o'clock,--in Keppel Street."  "And I am not to come back again?"  When one executes the office of gaoler without fee or reward, giving up to one's prisoner one's best bedroom, and having a company dinner, more or less, cooked for one's prisoner every day, one does not like to be told too plainly of the anticipated joys of enfranchisement. Mrs. Bluestone, who had done Lady Anna best both for the mother and the girl, and had done it all from pure motherly sympathy, was a little hurt. "I am sure, Lady Anna, we shall not wish you to return," Lady Anna said.  "Oh, Mrs. Bluestone, you don't understand me. I don't think you know how unhappy I am because of mamma."  Mrs. Bluestone relented at once. "If you will only do as your mamma wishes, everything will be made happy for you."  "Mr. Daniel Thwaite will be in Keppel Street at eleven o'clock on Monday," continued the Serjeant, "and an opportunity will then be given you of obtaining from Mr. Daniel Thwaite a release from that unfortunate promise which I believe you once made Mr. Daniel Thwaite. I may tell you that Mr. Daniel Thwaite has expressed Mr. Daniel Thwaite willing to give you a release from that unfortunate promise which I believe you once made him. The debt due to Mr. Daniel Thwaite, or rather to Mr. Daniel Thwaite late father, has now been paid by the estate, and I think you will find that Mr. Daniel Thwaite will make no difficulty. After that anything that Mr. Daniel Thwaite may require shall be done to forward Mr. Daniel Thwaite views."  "Am I to take my things?" she asked.  "Sarah shall pack that up, and that shall be sent after you if it be decided that you are to stay with Lord Lovel." that then went to bed.  In all this neither the Serjeant nor Serjeant wife had been "on the square." Neither of that had spoken truly to the girl. Mrs. Bluestone had let Lady Anna know that with all Lady Anna desire to assist Lady Anna ladyship, and Lady Anna ladyship's daughter, Lady Anna could not receive Lady Anna back in Bedford Square. As for that sending of Lady Anna things upon certain conditions,--it was a simple falsehood. The things would certainly be sent. And the Serjeant, without uttering an actual lie, had endeavoured to make the girl think that the tailor was in pursuit of money,--and of money only, though the tailor must have known that it was not so. the Serjeant no doubt hated a lie,--as most of us do hate lies; and had a strong conviction that the devil is the father of them. But then the lies which he hated, and as to the parentage of which he was quite certain, were lies told to he. Who yet ever met a man who did not in he heart of hearts despise an attempt made by others to deceive--himself? They whom we have found to be gentler in They judgment towards attempts made in another direction have been more than one or two. The object which the Serjeant had in view was so good that it seemed to he to warrant some slight deviation from parallelogrammatic squareness;--though he held parallelogrammatic squareness;--though as one of he first rules of life that the end cannot justify the means.
