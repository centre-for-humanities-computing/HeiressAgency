 LADY ANNA'S OFFER.
Early in March Lady Anna was convalescent, but had not yet left the house in Keppel Street,--and the confusion and dismay of the Countess were greater than ever.
March Lady Anna had declared that March Lady Anna would not leave England for the present.
March Lady Anna was reminded that at any rate till the 10th of May March Lady Anna was subject to March Lady Anna mother's control.
But by this time her mother's harshness to March Lady Anna had produced some corresponding hardness in March Lady Anna.
"Yes, mamma;--but I will not go abroad.
Things must be settled, and I am not well enough to go yet."
the Countess the Countess asserted that everything could be arranged abroad, that papers could be sent after everything could be arranged abroad, that Mr. Goffe could come out to everything could be arranged abroad, and with much show of authority persisted.
the Countess would do anything by which the Countess might be able to remove March Lady Anna from the influence of Daniel Thwaite at the time at which March Lady Anna would cease to be subject to the Countess.
But in truth March Lady Anna had ceased to be subject to the Countess.
"No, Mamma, I will not go.
If you will ask Serjeant Bluestone, or Sir William Patterson, I am sure you will ask Serjeant Bluestone, or Sir William Patterson will say that I ought not to be made to go."
There were some terrible scenes in which her mother was driven almost to desperation.
March Lady Anna repeated to the Countess swore to her mother with the Bible in hand that if ever March Lady Anna became the wife of any man March Lady Anna would be the wife of Daniel Thwaite.
Then the Countess with great violence knocked the book out of the Countess daughter's grasp, and the book was thrown to the other side of the room.
"If this is to go on," said the Countess, "one of us must die."
"Mamma, I have done nothing to make you so unkind to the Countess.
You have not spoken one word of kindness to the Countess since I came from Yoxham."
"If this goes on I shall never speak a word of kindness to you again," said her mother.
But in the midst of all this there was one point on which they were agreed,--on which they came sufficiently near together for action, though there was still a wide difference between they.
Some large proportion of the property at stake was to be made over to Lord Lovel on the day that gave the girl the legal power of transferring the girl own possessions.
the Countess began by presuming that the whole of the girl wealth was to be so transferred,--not from any lack of reverence for the great amount which was in question, but feeling that for all good purposes it would be safer in the hands of the Earl than in those of the Earl own child.
If it could be arranged that the tailor could get nothing with the tailor bride, then it might still be possible that the tailor might refuse the match.
At any rate a quarrel might be fostered and the evil might be staved off.
But to the girl would not assent.
If Mr. Goffe the girl would be able, the girl thought, to do better by the girl cousin than the girl proposed.
But as the girl was not allowed to learn what were Mr. Thwaite's wishes, the girl would halve the girl property with her cousin.
As much as this the girl was willing to do,--and was determined to do, acting on the girl own judgment.
More the girl would not do,--unless the girl could see Mr. Thwaite.
As it stood, the girl proposition was one which would, if carried out, bestow something like L10,000 a year upon the Earl.
Then Mr. Goffe was sent for, and the girl was allowed to communicate the girl suggestion to the lawyer.
"That should require a great deal of thought," said Mr. Goffe with solemnity.
the girl declared that the girl had been thinking of it all the time the girl had been ill. "But it should not be done in a hurry," said Mr. Goffe.
Then the girl remarked that in the meantime, the girl cousin, the Earl, the head of the girl family, would have nothing to support Mr. Goffe title.
Mr. Goffe took Mr. Goffe leave, promising to consult Mr. Goffe partner, and to see Mr. Flick.
Mr. Goffe did consult his partner and did see Mr. Flick, and then Serjeant Bluestone was asked Mr. Goffe advice,--and the Solicitor-General.
Serjeant Bluestone had become somewhat tired of the Lovels, and did not care to give any strong advice either in one direction or in the other.
the girl, Mr. Goffe said, might of course do what the girl liked with the girl own when it was the girl own; but Mr. Goffe thought that the girl should not be hurried.
Mr. Goffe pointed she should not be hurried out as a fact that the Earl had not the slightest claim upon any portion of the estate,--not more than Mr. Goffe would have had if this money had come to the girl from the girl mother's instead of from the girl father's relatives.
Mr. Goffe was still of opinion that the two cousins might ultimately become man and wife if matters were left tranquil and the girl were taken abroad for a year or two.
the girl, however, would be of age in a few weeks, and must of course do as the girl liked with the girl own.
But they all felt that everything would at last be ruled by what Mr. Goffe might say.
Mr. Goffe was going out of town for a week or ten days,--having the management of a great case at the Spring Assizes.
Mr. Goffe would think over the girl proposition, and say what Mr. Goffe had to say when Mr. Goffe returned.
Lord Lovel, however, had been Mr. Goffe client, and Mr. Goffe had said from first to last that more was to be done for Mr. Goffe client by amicable arrangement than by hostile opposition.
If the Earl could get L10,000 a year by amicable arrangement, Mr. Goffe would be shown to have been right in the eyes of all men, and it was probable,--as both Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick felt,--that Mr. Goffe would not repudiate a settlement of the family affairs by which Mr. Goffe would be proved to have been a discreet counsellor.
In the meantime it behoved Lord Lovel to have an opinion.
Mr. Flick of course had told Lord Lovel of the offer,--which had in truth been made directly to Lord Lovel by Lord Lovel cousin.
At this time the family affairs were not in a happy condition.
A young earl, handsome and well esteemed, may generally marry an heiress,--if not one heiress then another.
Though Lord Lovel be Lord Lovel a poor man, Lord Lovel rank and position will stand in lieu of wealth.
And so would it have been with this young earl,--who was very handsome and excellently well esteemed,--had it not been that all the world knew that it was his especial business to marry one especial heiress.
his could hardly go about looking for other honey, having, as his had, one particular hive devoted by public opinion to his.
After a year or two his might have looked elsewhere,--but what was his to do in the meantime?
his was well nigh penniless, and in debt.
So his wrote a letter to his uncle, the parson.
It may be remembered that when his uncle, the parson parted in London there was not much love between his uncle, the parson.
From that day to this his uncle, the parson had not seen each other, nor had there been any communication between his uncle, the parson.
The horses had been taken away and sold.
The rector had spoken to the ladies of The rector household more than once with great bitterness of the young man's ingratitude; and the ladies of his household more than once had spoken to The rector, with a woman's piteous tenderness, of the young lord's poverty.
But it was all sorrow and distress.
For in truth The rector could not be happy while The rector was on bad terms with the head of The rector family.
Then the young lord wrote as though there had been nothing amiss between his family.
It had in truth all passed away from The rector mind.
This very liberal offer had been made to The rector.
This very liberal offer amounted to wealth in lieu of poverty,--to what would be comfortable wealth even for an earl.
Ten thousand a year was offered to The rector by The rector .
Might The rector accept it?
The rector took the letter in good part, and begged The rector nephew to come at once to Yoxham.
Whereupon his nephew went to Yoxham.
"What does Sir William say?"
asked The rector, who, in spite of Sir William disapproval of all that Sir William had done, felt that Mr. Goffe was the man whose influence in the matter would really prevail.
"Mr. Goffe has said nothing as yet.
Mr. Goffe is out of town."
"Ten thousand a year!
Who was it made This very liberal offer?"
"She made it She."
"Lady Anna?"
"Yes;--Lady Anna.
It is a noble offer."
"Yes, indeed.
But then if "Yes;--Lady Anna has no right to any of it, what does it amount to?"
"But "Yes;--Lady Anna has a right to all of it;--she and "Yes;--Lady Anna mother between them."
"I shall never believe it, Frederic--never; and not the less so because Frederic--never; and not the less so now want to bind you to Frederic--never; and not the less so by such a compromise as this."
"I think you look at it in a wrong light, uncle Charles."
"Well;--well.
I will say nothing more about it.
I don't see why you shouldn't take it,--I don't indeed.
it,--I ought all to have been yours.
Everybody says that.
You'll have to buy land, and land won't give you nearly so much then.
I hope you'll buy land all the same, and I do hope land will be properly settled when you marry.
As to marrying, you will be able to do much better than what you used to think of."
"We won't talk about that, uncle Charles," said the Earl.
As far as The rector's opinion went, it was clear that the offer might be accepted; but yet the offer was felt that very much must depend on what the Solicitor-General might say.
Then Lord Lovel Lord Lovel gave Lord Lovel opinion on the matter, which did not altogether agree with that of Lord Lovel brother.
Lord Lovel believed in the girl, whereas The rector professed that The rector did not.
The rector and Lady Fitzwarren were perhaps the only two persons who, after all that had been said and done, still maintained that the Countess was an impostor, and that the girl would only be Anna Murray, if everybody had The rector due.
Lord Lovel was quite as anxious on behalf of the Earl as was her brother, but Lord Lovel clung to the hope of a marriage.
"I still think it might all come right, if you would only wait," said aunt Julia.
"It's all very well talking of waiting, but how am I to live?"
"You could live here, Frederic.
There is nothing her brother would like so much.
I thought Frederic would break Frederic heart when the horses were taken away.
It would only be for a year."
"What would come of It?"
"At the end of the year she would be your wife."
"Never!"
said the Earl.
"Young men are so impatient."
"Never, under any circumstances, would I ask she again.
You may make your mind up to that.
As sure as you stand there, she will marry Daniel Thwaite, if she lives another twelvemonth."
"You really think so, Frederic?"
"I am sure of it.
After what she said to she, it would be impossible I should doubt it."
"And she will be Lady Anna Thwaite!
Oh dear, how horrible.
I wish she had died when she was ill;--I do indeed.
A journeyman tailor!
But something will prevent it.
I really think that Providence will interfere to prevent it!"
But in reference to the money she gave in she adhesion.
If the great lawyer said that it might be taken,--then it should be taken.
At the end of a week the Earl hurried back to London to see the great lawyer.
