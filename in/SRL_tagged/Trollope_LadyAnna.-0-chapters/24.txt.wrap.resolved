 BEDFORD SQUARE.   The Earl, without asking any question on the subject, had found that the Solicitor-General thought nothing of that objection which had weighed so heavily on the Solicitor-General own mind, as to carrying on the Solicitor-General suit with a girl who had been wooed successfully by a tailor. the Solicitor-General own spirit rebelled for a while against such condescension. When Lady Anna had first told the Solicitor-General that Lady Anna had pledged Lady Anna word to a lover low in the scale of men, the thing had seemed to the Solicitor-General to be over. What struggle might be made to prevent the accomplishment of so base a marriage must be effected for the sake of the family, and not on the Solicitor-General own special behoof. Not even for twenty thousand a year, not even for Lady Anna Lovel, not for all the Lovels, would the Solicitor-General take to the Solicitor-General bosom as the Solicitor-General bride, the girl who had leaned with loving fondness on the shoulders of Daniel Thwaite. But when the Solicitor-General found that others did not feel it as the Solicitor-General felt it, the Solicitor-General turned the matter over again in the Solicitor-General mind,--and by degrees relented. There had doubtless been much in the whole affair which had placed it outside the pale of things which are subject to the ordinary judgment of men. Lady Anna's position in the world had been very singular. A debt of gratitude was due by Lady Anna's to the tailor, which had seemed to exact from Lady Anna's some great payment. As Lady Anna's had said Lady Anna's, Lady Anna's had given the only thing which Lady Anna's had to give. Now there would be much to give. The man doubtless deserved The man reward and should have it, but his reward must not be the hand of the heiress of the Lovels. The man, the Earl, would once again claim that as The man own.  The man had hurried out of town after seeing Sir William, but had not returned to Yoxham. The man went again to Scotland, and wrote no further letter to the rectory after those three lines which the reader has seen. Then The man heard from Mr. Flick that Lady Anna was staying with the Serjeant in Bedford Square, and The man returned to London at the lawyer's instance. It was so expedient that if possible something should be settled before November!  The only guests asked to meet the Earl at Serjeant Bluestone's, were Sir William and Lady Patterson, and the black-browed young barrister. The whole proceeding was very irregular,--as Mr. Flick, who knew what was going on, said more than once to Mr. Norton. That the Solicitor-General should dine with the Serjeant might be all very well,--though, as school boys say, the Solicitor-General should dine with the Serjeant had never known each other at home before. But that the Solicitor-General should dine with the Serjeant should meet in this way the then two opposing clients,--the two claimants to the vast property as to which a cause was to come on for trial in a few weeks,--did bewilder Mr. Flick. "I suppose the Solicitor-General sees the Solicitor-General way, but the Solicitor-General may be in a mess yet," said a few weeks,--did bewilder Mr. Flick. Mr. Norton only scratched Mr. Norton head. It was no work of Mr. Norton.  Sir William, who arrived before the Earl at Serjeant Bluestone's, was introduced for the first time to Lady Anna. "Lady Anna," the Solicitor-General said, "for some months past I have heard much of Lady Anna. And now I have great pleasure in meeting you." Lady Anna smiled, and strove to look pleased, but Lady Anna had not a word to say to him. "You know I ought to be your enemy," him continued laughing, "but I hope that is well nigh over. I should not like to have to fight so fair a foe." Then the young lord arrived, and the lawyers of course gave way to the lover.  Lady Anna, from the moment in which Lady Anna was told that him was to come, had thought of nothing but the manner of Lady Anna, from the moment in which she was told that he was to come greeting. It was not that Lady Anna was uneasy as to Lady Anna own fashion of receiving him. Lady Anna could smile and be silent, and give him Lady Anna hand or leave her hand ungiven, as him might demand. But in what manner would him accost Lady Anna? Lady Anna had felt sure that him had despised Lady Anna from the moment in which Lady Anna had told him of Lady Anna engagement. Of course him had despised Lady Anna. Those fine sentiments about ladies and gentlemen, and the gulf which had been fixed, had occurred to Lady Anna before Lady Anna heard Those fine sentiments about ladies and gentlemen, and the gulf which had been fixed from the mouth of Miss Alice Bluestone. Lady Anna understood, as well as did Lady Anna young friend, what was the difference between Lady Anna cousin the Earl, and Lady Anna lover the tailor. Of course it would be sweet to be able to love such a one as Lady Anna cousin. They all talked to Lady Anna as though Lady Anna was simply obstinate and a fool, not perceiving, as Lady Anna did Lady Anna, that the untowardness of Lady Anna fortune had prescribed this destiny for Lady Anna. Good as Daniel Thwaite might be,--as Lady Anna knew that he was,--she felt Lady Anna to be degraded in having promised to be he wife. The lessons they had taught Lady Anna had not been in vain. And Lady Anna had been specially degraded in the eyes of him, who was to Lady Anna imagination the brightest of human beings. they told Lady Anna that Lady Anna might still be he wife if only Lady Anna would consent to hold out Lady Anna hand when he should ask for her hand. Lady Anna did not believe her hand. Were her hand true, her hand could make no difference,--but Lady Anna did not believe her hand. he had scorned Lady Anna when Lady Anna told he the tale at Bolton Abbey. he had scorned Lady Anna when he hurried away from Yoxham. Now he was coming to the Serjeant's house, with the express intention of meeting Lady Anna again. Why should he come? Alas, alas! Lady Anna was sure that he would never speak to Lady Anna again in that bright sunny manner, with those dulcet honey words, which he had used when first they saw each other in Wyndham Street.  Nor was he less uneasy as to this meeting. he had not intended to scorn Lady Anna when he parted from Lady Anna, but he had intended that Lady Anna should understand that there was an end of he suit. he had loved Lady Anna dearly, but there are obstacles to which love must yield. Had Lady Anna already married this tailor, how would it have been with he then? That which had appeared to he to be most fit for he to do, had suddenly become altogether unfit,--and he had told he at the moment that he must take back he love to he as best he might. he could not sue for that which had once been given to a tailor. But now all that was changed, and he did intend to sue again. Lady Anna was very beautiful,--to he thinking the very pink of feminine grace, and replete with charms;--soft in voice, soft in manner, with just enough of spirit to give Lady Anna character. What a happy chance it had been, what marvellous fortune, that he should have been able to love this girl whom it was so necessary that he should marry;--what a happy chance, had it not been for this tailor! But now, in spite of this tailor, he would try he fate with Lady Anna once again. he had not intended to scorn Lady Anna when he left Lady Anna, but he knew that he manner to Lady Anna must have told Lady Anna that he suit was over. How should he renew his suit was over again in the presence of Mrs. Bluestone and of Sir William and Lady Patterson?  he was first introduced to the wives of the two lawyers while Lady Anna was sitting silent on the corner of a sofa. Mrs. Bluestone, foreseeing how it would be, had endeavoured with much prudence to establish Mrs. Bluestone young friend at some distance from the other guests, in order that the Earl might have the power of saying some word; but the young barrister had taken this opportunity of making the young barrister agreeable, and stood opposite to Mrs. Bluestone talking nothings about the emptiness of London, and the glories of the season when it should come. Lady Anna did not hear a word that the young barrister said. Lady Anna ear was straining Lady Anna's ear to hear what Lord Lovel might say, and Lady Anna eye, though not quite turned towards Lord Lovel, was watching Lord Lovel every motion. Of course Lord Lovel must speak to Lady Anna. "Lady Anna is on the sofa," said Mrs. Bluestone. Of course Lord Lovel knew that Lady Anna was there. Lord Lovel had seen Lady Anna dear face the moment that Lord Lovel entered the room. Lord Lovel walked up to Lady Anna and gave Lady Anna Lord Lovel hand, and smiled upon Lady Anna.  Lady Anna had made up Lady Anna little speech. "I hope they are quite well at Yoxham," Lady Anna said, in that low, soft, silver voice which Lord Lovel had told Lord Lovel would so well befit the future Countess Lovel.  "Oh yes;--I believe so. I am a truant there, for I do not answer aunt Julia's letters as punctually as I ought to do. I shall be down there for the hunting I suppose next month." Then dinner was announced; and as it was necessary that the Earl should take down Mrs. Bluestone and the Serjeant Lady Anna,--so that the young barrister absolutely went down to dinner with the wife of the Solicitor-General,--the conversation was brought to an end. Nor was it possible that they should be made to sit next each other at dinner. And then, when at last the late evening came and they were all together in the drawing-room, other things intervened and the half hour so passed that hardly a word was spoken between they. But there was just one word as he went away. "I shall call and see you," he said.  "I don't think he means it," the Serjeant said to he that evening, almost in anger.  "Why not, my dear?"  "he did not speak to the wife of the Solicitor-General,--the conversation."  "People can't speak at dinner-parties when there is anything particular to say. If he didn't mean it, he wouldn't have come. And if you'll all have a little patience the wife of the Solicitor-General,--the conversation'll mean it too. I can't forgive the wife of the Solicitor-General,--the conversation mother for being so hard to the wife of the Solicitor-General,--the conversation. the wife of the Solicitor-General,--the conversation's one of the sweetest creatures I ever came across."  A little patience, and here was November coming! The Earl who had now been dining in Earl house, meeting Earl own client there, must again become the Serjeant's enemy in November, unless this matter were settled. the Serjeant could see no other way of proceeding. the Earl the Earl might no doubt retire from the suit, but a jury must then decide whether the Italian woman had any just claim. And against the claim of the Italian woman the Earl would again come forward. The Serjeant as he thought of it, was almost sorry that he had asked the Earl and the Solicitor-General to Earl .  On the very next morning,--early in the Earl the Earl was announced in Bedford Square. the Serjeant was of course away at the Serjeant chambers. Lady Anna was in Lady Anna room and Mrs. Bluestone was sitting with Lady Anna daughter. "I have come to see my cousin," said the Earl boldly.  "I am so glad that you have come, Lord Lovel."  "Thank you,--well; yes. I know you will not mind my saying so outright. Though the papers say that we are enemies, we have many things in common between we."  "I will send her daughter to you. My dear, we will go into her room. You will find lunch ready when you come down, Lord Lovel." Then her daughter left Lord Lovel, and Lord Lovel stood looking for a while at the books that were laid about the table.  It seemed to Lord Lovel to be an age, but at last the door was opened and my cousin crept into her room. When Lord Lovel had parted from my cousin at Yoxham Lord Lovel had called my cousin Lady Anna; but Lord Lovel was determined that my cousin should at any rate be again my cousin. "I could hardly speak to you yesterday," Lord Lovel said, while Lord Lovel held my cousin hand.  "No;--Lord Lovel."  "People never can, I think, at small parties like that. Lady Anna, you surprised me so much by what you told me on the banks of the Wharfe!" Lady Anna did not know how to answer Lord Lovel even a word. "I know that I was unkind to Lady Anna."  "I did not think so, Lord Lovel."  "I will tell you just the plain truth. Even though it may be bitter, just the plain truth will be best between us, dearest. When first I heard what you said, I believed that all must be over between you and me."  "Oh, yes," Lady Anna said.  "But I have thought about it since, and I will not have it so. I have not come to reproach you."  "You may if you will."  "I have no right to do so, and would not if I had. I can understand your feelings of deep gratitude and can respect your feelings of deep gratitude."  "But I love him, Lord Lovel," said Lady Anna, holding Lady Anna head on high and speaking with much dignity. Lady Anna could hardly Lady Anna understand the feeling which induced Lady Anna so to address him. When Lady Anna was alone thinking of him and of Lady Anna other lover, Lady Anna heart was inclined to regret in that Lady Anna had not known Lady Anna cousin in Lady Anna early days,--as days,--as had known Daniel Thwaite. days,--as could tell days,--as, though days,--as could not tell any other human being, that when days,--as had thought that days,--as was giving days,--as to the young tailor, days,--as had not quite known what it was to have a heart to give. The young lord was as a god to days,--as; whereas Daniel was but a man,--to whom days,--as owed so deep a debt of gratitude that days,--as must sacrifice days,--as, if needs, be, on The young lord behalf. And yet when the Earl spoke to the Earl of the Earl gratitude to this man,--praising this, and professing that the Earl also understood those very feelings which had governed the Earl conduct,--she blazed up almost in wrath, and swore that the Earl loved the tailor.  the Earl's task was certainly difficult. The Earl's task was The Earl's task first impulse to rush away again, as The Earl's task had rushed away before. To rush away and leave the country, and let the lawyers settle it all as the lawyers would. Could it be possible that such a girl as this should love a journeyman tailor, and should be proud of the Earl love! The Earl's task turned from the Earl and walked to the door and back again, during which time the Earl had almost repented of the Earl audacity.  "It is right that you should love The Earl's task--as a friend," The Earl's task said.  "But I have sworn to be The Earl's task ."  "And must you keep your oath?" As the Earl did not answer The Earl's task The Earl's task pressed on with The Earl's task . "If The Earl's task loves you I am sure The Earl's task cannot wish to hurt you, and you know that such a marriage as that would be very hurtful. Can it be right that you should descend from your position to pay a debt of gratitude, and that you should do it at the expense of all those who belong to you? Would you break your mother's heart, and mine, and bring disgrace upon your family merely because disgrace was good to you?"  "disgrace was good to my mother as well as me."  "Will it not break the Earl heart? Has the Earl not told you so? But perhaps you do not believe it, my love."  "I do not know," the Earl said.  "Ah, dearest, you may believe. To my eyes you are the sweetest of all God's creatures. Perhaps you think I say so only for the money's sake."  "No, Lord Lovel, I do not think that."  "Of course much is due to Lord Lovel."  "Lord Lovel wants nothing but that I should be the wife of the Solicitor-General,--the conversation. Lord Lovel has said so, and Lord Lovel is never false. I can trust Lord Lovel at any rate, even though I should betray Lord Lovel. But I will not betray Lord Lovel. I will go away with Lord Lovel and they shall not hear of Lord Lovel, and nobody will remember that I was my father's daughter."  "You are doubting even now, dear."  "But I ought not to doubt. If I doubt it is because I am weak."  "Then still be weak. Surely such weakness will be good when it will please all those who must be dearest to you."  "It will not please him, Lord Lovel."  "Will you do this, dearest;--will you take one week to consider and then write to Lord Lovel? You cannot refuse me that, knowing that the happiness and the honour and the welfare of every Lord Lovel depends upon your answer."  She felt that She could not refuse, and She gave Lord Lovel the promise. On that day week She would write to Lord Lovel, and tell Lord Lovel then to what resolve She should have brought She. Lord Lovel came up close to She, meaning to kiss She if She would let Lord Lovel; but She stood aloof, and merely touched his hand. She would obey She betrothed,--at any rate till She should have made up She mind that She would be untrue to her betrothed,--at. Lord Lovel could not press Lord Lovel wish, and left his house unmindful of Mrs. Bluestone's luncheon.
