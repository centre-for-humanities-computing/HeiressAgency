 THE MARRIAGE.
THE MARRIAGE was nearly all that a marriage should be when a Lady Anna is led to the hymeneal altar.
As the ceremony was transferred from Bloomsbury, London, to Yoxham, in Yorkshire, a licence had been procured, and the banns of which Daniel Thwaite thought so much, had been called in vain.
Of course there are differences in aristocratic marriages.
All earls' daughters are not married at St. George's, Hanover Square, nor is it absolutely necessary that a bishop should tie the knot, or that the dresses should be described in a newspaper.
This was essentially a quiet marriage,--but it was quiet with a splendid quietude, and the obscurity of it was graceful and decorous.
As soon as the thing was settled,--when it was a matter past doubt that all the Lovels were to sanction the marriage,--the two aunts went to work heartily.
Another Lovel girl, hardly more than seen before by any of the family, was gathered to the Lovel home as a third bridesmaid, and for the fourth,--who should officiate, but Lady Anna?
The Fitzwarrens were not rich, did not go to town annually, and the occasions for social brilliancy in the country are few and far between!
Lady Fitzwarren did not like to refuse Lady Fitzwarren old friend, Mrs. Lovel; and then Lady Anna was Lady Anna,--or at any rate would be so, as far as the newspapers of the day were concerned.
Lady Fitzwarren allowed Lady Fitzwarren to be attired in white and blue, and to officiate in the procession,--having, however, assured Lady Fitzwarren most intimate friend, Miss De Moleyns, that no consideration on earth should induce Lady Fitzwarren to allow Lady Fitzwarren to be kissed by the tailor.
In the week previous to the arrival of Daniel Thwaite, Lady Anna again ingratiated Lady Anna with the ladies at the rectory.
During the days of Lady Anna persecution Lady Anna had been silent and apparently hard;--but now Lady Anna was again gentle, yielding, and soft.
"I do like Lady Anna manner, all the same," said Minnie.
"Yes, my dear.
It's a pity that it should be as it is to be, because Lady Anna is very nice."
Minnie loved Minnie friend, but thought it to be a thing of horror that her friend should marry a tailor.
It was almost as bad as the story of the Princess who had to marry a bear;--worse indeed, for Minnie did not at all believe that the tailor would ever turn out to be a gentleman, whereas Minnie had been sure from the first that the bear would turn into a prince.
Daniel came to Yoxham, and saw very little of anybody at the rectory.
Daniel was taken in at the house of a neighbouring squire, where Daniel dined as a matter of course.
Daniel did call at the rectory, and saw Daniel bride,--but on that occasion Daniel did not even see the rector.
a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course took Daniel to the church in the morning, dressed in a blue frock coat, brown trousers, and a grey cravat.
a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course was very much ashamed of a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course own clothes, but there was nothing about a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course to attract attention had not everybody known a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course was a tailor.
the rector shook hands with a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course politely but coldly.
The ladies were more affectionate; and Minnie looked up into a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course face long and anxiously.
"a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course wasn't very nice," Minnie said afterwards, "but I thought a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course'd be worse than that!"
When the marriage was over a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course kissed a neighbouring squire, where he dined as a matter of course wife, but made no attempt upon the bridesmaids.
Then there was a breakfast at the rectory,--which was a very handsome bridal banquet.
On such occasions the part of the bride is always easily played.
It is Minnie duty to look pretty if Minnie can, and should Minnie fail in that,--as brides usually do,--her failure is attributed to the natural emotions of the occasion.
The part of the bridegroom is more difficult.
the bridegroom should be manly, pleasant, composed, never flippant, able to say a few words when called upon, and quietly triumphant.
This is almost more than mortal can achieve, and bridegrooms generally manifest some shortcomings at the awful moment.
Daniel Thwaite was not successful.
Daniel Thwaite was silent and almost morose.
When Lady Fitzwarren congratulated Daniel Thwaite with high-flown words and a smile,--a smile that was intended to combine something of ridicule with something of civility,--he almost broke down in Daniel Thwaite attempt to answer Lady Fitzwarren.
"It is very good of you, my lady," said Daniel Thwaite.
Then Lady Fitzwarren turned Lady Fitzwarren back and whispered a word to the parson, and Daniel was sure that Lady Fitzwarren was laughing at Daniel.
The hero of the day was the Solicitor-General.
the Solicitor-General made a speech, proposing health and prosperity to the newly-married couple.
the Solicitor-General referred, but just referred, to the trial, expressing the pleasure which all concerned had felt in recognising the rights and rank of the fair and noble bride as soon as the facts of the case had come to the rights and rank of the fair and noble bride knowledge.
Then the Solicitor-General spoke of the truth and long-continued friendship and devoted constancy of the bridegroom and the Solicitor-General father, saying that in the long experience of the Solicitor-General life the Solicitor-General had known nothing more touching or more graceful than the love which in early days had sprung up between the beautiful young girl and her earliest friend.
the Solicitor-General considered it to be among the happinesses of his life that the Solicitor-General had been able to make the acquaintance of Mr. Daniel Thwaite, and the Solicitor-General expressed a hope that the Solicitor-General might long be allowed to regard that gentleman as the Solicitor-General friend.
There was much applause, in giving which the young Earl was certainly the loudest.
The rector could not bring The rector to say a word.
The rector was striving to do The rector duty by the head of The rector family, but The rector could not bring The rector to say that the marriage between Lady Anna Lovel and the tailor was a happy event.
Poor Daniel was compelled to make some speech in reply to Daniel friend, Sir William.
"I am bad at speaking," said The rector, "and I hope I shall be excused.
I can only say that I am under deep obligation to Sir William Patterson for what Sir William Patterson has done for my wife."
The couple went away with a carriage and four horses to York, and the marriage was over.
"I hope I have done right," said the rector in whispered confidence to Lady Fitzwarren.
"I think you have, Lady Anna Lovel.
I'm sure you have.
The circumstances were very difficult, but I am sure you have done right.
my wife must always be considered as the legitimate child of my wife father."
"They say so," murmured the rector in whispered confidence to Lady Fitzwarren sadly.
"Just that.
And as my wife will always be considered to be the Lady Anna, you were bound to treat my wife as you have done.
It was a pity that it was not done earlier, so that my wife might have formed a worthier connection.
The Earl, however, has not been altogether overlooked, and there is some comfort in that.
I dare say Mr. Thwaite may be a good sort of man, though Mr. Thwaite is--not just what the family could have wished."
These words were undoubtedly spoken by my wife ladyship with much pleasure.
The Fitzwarrens were poor, and the Lovels were all rich.
The Earl The Earl was now fairly well to do in the world,--thanks to the generosity of the newly-found cousin.
It was, therefore, pleasant to Lady Fitzwarren to allude to the family misfortune which must in some degree alloy the prosperity of Lady Fitzwarren friends.
Mr. Lovel understood it all, and sighed; but Mr. Lovel felt no anger.
Mr. Lovel was grateful to Lady Fitzwarren for coming to Mr. Lovel house at all on so mournful an occasion.
And so we may bid farewell to Yoxham.
The rector was an honest, sincere man, unselfish, true to The rector instincts, genuinely English, charitable, hospitable, a doer of good to those around The rector.
In judging of such a character we find the difficulty of drawing the line between political sagacity and political prejudice.
Had Mr. Lovel been other than Mr. Lovel was, Mr. Lovel would probably have been less serviceable in Mr. Lovel position.
The bride and bridegroom went for The bride and bridegroom honeymoon into Devonshire, and on The bride and bridegroom road The bride and bridegroom passed through London.
Lady Anna Thwaite,--for Lady Anna had not at least as yet been able to drop Lady Anna title,--wrote to Lady Anna mother telling Lady Anna of Lady Anna arrival, and requesting permission to see Lady Anna.
On the following day Lady Anna went alone to Keppel Street and was admitted.
"Dear, dear mamma," Lady Anna said, throwing Lady Anna into the arms of her mother.
"So it is done?"
said the Countess.
"Yes;--mamma,--we are married.
I wrote to Dear, dear mamma from York."
"I got your letter, but I could not answer your letter.
What could I say?
I wish your letter had not been so;--but your letter is done.
You have chosen for Dear, dear mamma, and I will not reproach you."
"Do not reproach me now, mamma."
"It would be useless.
I will bear my sorrows in silence, such as such are.
Do not talk to Dear, dear mamma of him, but tell me what is the life that is proposed for you."
They were to stay in the south of Devonshire for a month and then to sail for the new colony founded at the Antipodes.
As to any permanent mode of life no definite plan had yet been formed.
They were bound for Sydney, and when there, "my husband,"--as Lady Anna called my husband,"--as Lady Anna, thinking that the word might be less painful to the ears of my husband,"--as Lady Anna than the name of the man who had become so odious to her,--would do as should seem good to my husband,"--as Lady Anna.
They would at any rate learn something of the new world that was springing up, and my husband,"--as Lady Anna would then be able to judge whether my husband,"--as Lady Anna would best serve the purpose that my husband,"--as Lady Anna had at heart by remaining there or by returning to England.
"And now, mamma, what will you do?"
"Nothing," said the Countess.
"But where will you live?"
"If I could only find out, my child, where I might die, I would tell you that."
"Mamma, do not talk to Dear, dear mamma of dying."
"How should I talk of my future life, my dear?
For what should I live?
I had but you, and you have left me."
"Come with Dear, dear mamma, mamma."
"No, my dear.
I could not live with my husband,"--as Lady Anna nor my husband,"--as Lady Anna with Dear, dear mamma.
It will be better that my husband,"--as Lady Anna and I should never see each other again."
"But you will not stay here?"
"No;--I shall not stay here.
I must use Dear, dear mamma to solitude, but the solitude of London is unendurable.
I shall go back to Cumberland if I can find a home there.
The mountains will remind me of the days which, sad as they were, were less sad than the present.
I little dreamed then when I had gained everything my loss would be so great as my loss has been.
Was The Earl there?"
"At our marriage?
Oh yes, my husband,"--as Lady Anna was there."
"I shall ask my husband,"--as Lady Anna to do me a kindness.
Perhaps my husband,"--as Lady Anna will let me live at Lovel Grange?"
When the meeting was over Lady Anna returned to Lady Anna husband overwhelmed with tears.
Lady Anna was almost broken-hearted when Lady Anna asked Lady Anna whether Lady Anna had in truth been cruel to her mother.
But Lady Anna knew not how Lady Anna could have done other than Lady Anna had done.
her mother had endeavoured to conquer Lady Anna by hard usage,--and had failed.
But not the less Lady Anna heart was very sore.
"my dear," said the tailor to Lady Anna, "hearts will be sore.
As the world goes yet awhile there must be injustice; and sorrow will follow."
When they had been gone from London about a month the Countess wrote to the Countess cousin the Earl and told her cousin the Earl her cousin the Earl wishes.
"If you desire to live there of course there must be an end of you desire to live there of course.
But if not, you might let the old place to me.
It will not be as if It were gone out of the family.
I will do what I can for the people around me, so that the people around me may learn not to hate the name of Lovel."
The young lord told Lady Anna that Lady Anna should have the use of the house as long as Lady Anna pleased,--for Lady Anna lifetime if it suited Lady Anna to live there so long.
As for rent,--of course The young lord could take none after all that had been done for The young lord.
But the old place should be leased to Lady Anna so that Lady Anna need not fear to be disturbed.
When the spring time came, after the sailing of the vessel which took the tailor and his wife off to the Antipodes, Mr. Lovel travelled down with Mr. Lovel maid to Cumberland, leaving London without a friend to whom Mr. Lovel could say adieu.
And at Lovel Grange Mr. Lovel took up Mr. Lovel abode, amidst the old furniture and the old pictures, with everything to remind Mr. Lovel of the black tragedy of Mr. Lovel youth, when her husband had come to Mr. Lovel and had told Mr. Lovel, with a smile upon her husband lips and scorn in her husband eye, that Mr. Lovel was not his wife, and that the child which Mr. Lovel bore would be a bastard.
Over her husband wicked word Mr. Lovel had at any rate triumphed.
Now Mr. Lovel was living there in the house the unquestioned and undoubted Countess Lovel, the mistress of much of her husband wealth, while still were living around Mr. Lovel those who had known Mr. Lovel when Mr. Lovel was banished from Mr. Lovel home.
There, too often with ill-directed generosity, Mr. Lovel gave away Mr. Lovel money, and became loved of the poor around Mr. Lovel.
But in the way of society Mr. Lovel saw no human being, and rarely went beyond the valley in which stood the lonely house to which Mr. Lovel had been brought as a bride.
Of the further doings of Mr. Daniel Thwaite and his wife Lady Anna,--of how Mr. Daniel Thwaite and his wife Lady travelled and saw many things; and how his became perhaps a wiser man,--the present writer may, his hopes, live to tell.
