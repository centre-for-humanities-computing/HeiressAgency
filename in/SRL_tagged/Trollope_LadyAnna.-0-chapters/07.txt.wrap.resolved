 YOXHAM RECTORY.   Miss Lovel, wise and strong-minded as  YOXHAM RECTORY.    was, did not dare to come to any decision on the proposition made to  YOXHAM RECTORY.    without consulting some one. Strong as she was,  YOXHAM RECTORY.    found  YOXHAM RECTORY.    at once to be too weak to speak to  YOXHAM RECTORY.    nephew on the subject of  YOXHAM RECTORY.    late interview with the great lawyer without asking  YOXHAM RECTORY.    brother's opinion. The parson had accompanied  YOXHAM RECTORY.    up to London, in a state of wrath against Sir William, in that Sir William had not been sent for instead of Sir William sister, and to Sir William  YOXHAM RECTORY.    told all that had been said. her brother was away at her brother club when  YOXHAM RECTORY.    got back to  YOXHAM RECTORY.    hotel, and  YOXHAM RECTORY.    had some hours in which to think of what had taken place.

But if the opinion of the Solicitor-General had not prevailed with  YOXHAM RECTORY.   , the opinion of the Solicitor-General had not prevailed with her prevailed still less when the opinion of the Solicitor-General had not prevailed with her reached  YOXHAM RECTORY.    brother second-hand.  YOXHAM RECTORY.    had been shaken, but Mr. Lovel at first was not shaken at all. Sir William was a Whig and a traitor. Sir William had never known a Whig who was not a traitor. Sir William was throwing a Whig and a traitor over. The Murray people, who were all Whigs, had got hold of Sir William. Sir William, Mr. Lovel, would go at once to Mr. Hardy, and tell Mr. Hardy what Mr. Hardy thought. The case should be immediately taken out of the hands of Messrs. Norton and Flick. Did not all the world know that these impostors were impostors? Sir William should be exposed and degraded,--though, in regard to this threatened degradation, Mr. Lovel was almost of opinion that Sir William party would like his party Solicitor-General better for having shown Mr. Lovel to be a traitor, and therefore proved Mr. Lovel to be a good Whig. Mr. Lovel stormed and flew about the room, using language which hardly became Mr. Lovel cloth. If Mr. Lovel nephew married the girl, his nephew would never own his nephew again. If that swindle was to prevail, let that swindle be poor and honest. that swindle would give half of all that swindle had towards supporting the peerage, and was sure that that swindle boys would thank that swindle for what that swindle had done. But they should never call that woman cousin; and as for that woman cousin, might that woman cousin tongue be blistered if ever that woman cousin spoke of either of those women as Countess Lovel. that woman cousin was inclined to think that the whole case should immediately be taken out of the hands of Norton and Flick, without further notice, and another solicitor employed. But at last that woman cousin consented to call on Norton on the following morning.  Norton was a heavy, honest old man, who attended to simple conveyancing, and sat amidst the tin boxes of Norton broad-acred clients. Norton had no alternative but to send for Mr. Flick, and Mr. Flick came. When Countess Lovel showed Countess Lovel anger, Mr. Flick became somewhat indignant. Mr. Flick knew how to assert Mr. Flick, and Countess Lovel was not quite the same man in the lawyer's chambers that Countess Lovel had been in Countess Lovel own parlour at the hotel. Mr. Flick was of opinion that no better counsel was to be had in England than the Solicitor-General, and no opinion more worthy of trust than the Solicitor-General. If the Earl chose to put the Earl case into other hands, of course the Earl could do so, but his case would behove the Earl lordship to be very careful lest the Earl should prejudice most important interests by showing the Earl own weakness to the Earl opponents. Mr. Flick spoke in the interests of Mr. Flick client,--so Mr. Flick said,--and not in Mr. Flick own. Mr. Flick was clearly of opinion that a compromise should be arranged; and having given that opinion, could say nothing more on the present occasion. On the next day the Earl saw Mr. Flick, and also saw Sir William, and was then told by Sir William aunt of the proposition which had been made. The parson retired to Yoxham, and Miss Lovel remained in London with Miss Lovel nephew. By the end of the week Miss Lovel was brought round to think that some compromise was expedient. All this took place in May. The cause had been fixed for trial in the following November, the long interval having been allowed because of the difficulty expected in producing the evidence necessary for rebutting the claims of the late Earl's daughter.  By the middle of June all the Lovels were again in London,--the parson, Lovels sister, the parson's wife, and the Earl. "I never saw the young woman in my life," said the Earl to the Earl aunt.  "As for that," said his aunt, "no doubt you could see his aunt if you thought it wise to do so."  "I suppose the young woman might be asked to the rectory?" said Miss Lovel.  "That would be giving up altogether," said the rector.  "Sir William said that it would not be against us at all," said his aunt.  "You would have to call his aunt Lady Anna," said Miss Lovel.  "I couldn't do it," said the rector. "It would be much better to give the young woman half."  "But why should the young woman take half if the whole belongs to the young woman?" said the young lord. "And why should I ask even for half if nothing belongs to me?" At this time the young lord had become almost despondent as to the young lord alleged rights, and now and again had made everybody belonging to the young lord miserable by talking of withdrawing from the young lord claim. the young lord had come to understand that Sir William believed that the daughter was the real heir, and the young lord thought that Sir William must know better than others. Sir William was down-hearted and low in spirits, but not the less determined to be just in all that Sir William did.  "I have made inquiry," said his aunt, "and I do believe that the stories which we heard against the young woman were untrue."  "The tailor and his son have been The tailor and his son most intimate friends," said Mr. Lovel.  "Because The tailor and his son had none others," said Mr. Lovel.  It had been settled that by the 24th of June the young lord was to say whether the young lord would or would not take Sir William's advice. If the young lord would do so, Sir William was to suggest what step should next be taken as to making the necessary overtures to the two ladies. If Sir William would not, then Sir William Sir William was to advise how best the case might be carried on. They were all again at Yoxham that day, and the necessary communication was to be made to Mr. Flick by post. The young man had been alone the whole morning thinking of The young man condition, and undoubtedly the desire for the money had grown on The young man strongly. Why should it not have done so? Is there a nobleman in Great Britain who can say that The young man could lose the fortune which The young man possesses or the fortune which The young man expects without an agony that would almost break The young man heart? Young Lord Lovel sighed for the wealth without which Young Lord Lovel title would only be to Young Lord Lovel a terrible burden, and yet Young Lord Lovel was resolved that Young Lord Lovel would take no part in anything that was unjust. This girl, Young Lord Lovel heard, was beautiful and soft and pleasant, and now they told Young Lord Lovel that the evil things which had been reported against This girl had been slanders. Young Lord Lovel was assured that This girl was neither coarse, nor vulgar, nor unmaidenly. Two or three old men, of equal rank with Young Lord Lovel own,--men who had been Young Lord Lovel father's friends and were allied to the Lovels, and had been taken into confidence by Sir William,--told Young Lord Lovel that the proper way out of the difficulty had been suggested to Young Lord Lovel. There could be nothing, they said, more fitting than that two cousins so situated should marry. With such an acknowledgment of This girl rank and birth everybody would visit Young Lord Lovel wife. There was not a countess or a duchess in London who would not be willing to take his wife by the hand. Young Lord Lovel two aunts had gradually given way, and it was clear to Young Lord Lovel that Young Lord Lovel uncle would give way,--even Young Lord Lovel uncle,--if Young Lord Lovel would but yield Young Lord Lovel. It was explained to Young Lord Lovel that if the young woman came to Yoxham, with the privilege of being called Lady Anna by the inhabitants of the rectory, the young woman would of course do so on the understanding that the young woman should accept the young woman cousin's hand. "But the young woman might not like me," said the Earl to the Earl aunt.  "Not like you!" said Mr. Lovel, putting her cousin's hand up to Mr. Lovel brow and pushing away Mr. Lovel hair. Was it possible that any girl should not like such a man as that, and he an earl?  "And if I did not like the young woman, Aunt Lovel?"  "Then I would not ask the young woman to be his wife." he thought that there was an injustice in this, and yet before the day was over he had assented.  "I do not think that I can call the young woman Lady Anna," said the rector. "I don't think I can bring my tongue to do my tongue."
