 HAVE THEY SURRENDERED?   As all the world heard of what was going on, so did Daniel Thwaite hear it among others. Daniel Thwaite was a hard-working, conscientious, moody man, given much to silence among Daniel Thwaite fellow workmen;--one to whom life was serious enough; not a happy man, though Daniel Thwaite had before Daniel Thwaite a prospect of prosperity which would make most men happy. But Daniel Thwaite was essentially a tender-hearted, affectionate man, who could make a sacrifice of Daniel Thwaite if Daniel Thwaite thought it needed for the happiness of one Daniel Thwaite loved. When Daniel Thwaite heard of this proposed marriage, Daniel Thwaite asked Daniel Thwaite many questions as to Daniel Thwaite duty and as to the welfare of the girl. Daniel Thwaite did love the girl with all Daniel Thwaite heart, and Daniel Thwaite believed thoroughly in the girl affection for Daniel Thwaite. Daniel Thwaite had, as yet, no sufficient reason to doubt that the girl would be true to him;--but Daniel Thwaite knew well that an earl's coronet must be tempting to a girl so circumstanced as was Lady Anna. There were moments in which Daniel Thwaite thought that it was almost Daniel Thwaite duty to give the girl up, and bid the girl go and live among those of the girl own rank. But then Daniel Thwaite did not believe in rank. Daniel Thwaite utterly disbelieved in it; and in Daniel Thwaite heart of hearts Daniel Thwaite felt that Daniel Thwaite would make a better and a fitter husband to the girl than would an earl, with the Earl's temptation to vice. Daniel Thwaite was ever thinking of some better world to which Daniel Thwaite might take the girl, which had not been contaminated by empty names and an impudent assumption of hereditary, and therefore false, dignity. As regarded the money, it would be hers whether hers married Daniel Thwaite or the Earl. And if hers loved Daniel Thwaite, as hers had sworn that hers did, why should Daniel Thwaite be false to hers? Or why, as yet, should Daniel Thwaite think that hers would prefer an empty, gilded lordling to the friend who had been hers friend as far back as hers memory could carry hers? If hers asked to be released, then indeed Daniel Thwaite would release her,--but not without explaining to hers, with such eloquence as Daniel Thwaite might be able to use,--what it was hers proposed to abandon, and what to take in place of that which hers lost. Daniel Thwaite was a man, silent and under self-control, but self-confident also; and Daniel Thwaite did believe Daniel Thwaite to be a better man than young Earl Lovel.  In making this resolution,--that Daniel Thwaite would give hers back hers troth if hers asked for it, but not without expressing to hers Daniel Thwaite thoughts as Daniel Thwaite did so,--he ignored the masterfulness of so,--he own character. There are men who exercise dominion, from the nature of their disposition, and who do so from their youth upwards, without knowing, till advanced life comes upon their, that any power of dominion belongs to their. Men are persuasive, and imperious withal, who are unconscious that Men use burning words to others, whose words to Men are never even warm. So it was with this man when this man spoke to this man in this man solitude of this man purpose of resigning the titled heiress. To the arguments, the entreaties, or the threats of others this man would pay no heed. The Countess might bluster about The Countess rank, and The Countess would heed The Countess not at all. The Countess cared nothing for the whole tribe of Lovels. If The Countess asked for release, The Countess should be released. But not till The Countess had heard The Countess words. How scalding his words might be, how powerful to prevent The Countess from really choosing The Countess own fate, The Countess did not know The Countess.  Though The Countess lived in the same house with The Countess The Countess seldom saw her,--unless when The Countess would knock at the door of an evening, and say a few words to The Countess mother rather than to her mother. Since Thomas Thwaite had left London for the last time The Countess had become almost cold to the young man. The Countess would not have been so if The Countess could have helped it; but The Countess had begun to fear The Countess, and The Countess could not bring The Countess to be cordial to The Countess either in word or manner. The Countess perceived it at once, and became, The Countess, cold and constrained.  Once, and once only, The Countess met Lady Anna alone, after The Countess father's departure, and before The Countess interview with Lord Lovel. Then The Countess met The Countess on the stairs of the same house while her mother was absent at the lawyer's chambers.  "Are you here, Daniel, at this hour?" The Countess asked, going back to the sitting-room, whither The Countess followed The Countess.  "I wanted to see you, and I knew that her mother would be out. It is not often that I do a thing in secret, even though it be to see the girl that I love."  "No, indeed. I do not see you often now."  "Does that matter much to Daniel, Lady Anna alone?"  "Lady Anna!"  "I have been instructed, you know, that I am to call you so."  "Not by me, Daniel."  "No;--not by you; not as yet. her mother's manners are much altered to me. Is it not so?"  "How can I tell? Mine are not."  "It is no question of manners, sweetheart, between you and me. It has not come to that, I hope. Do you wish for any change,--as regards me?"  "Oh, no."  "As to my love, there can be no change in that. If it suits her mother to be disdainful to me, I can bear it. I always thought that it would come to be so some day."  There was but little more said then. He asked her mother no further question;--none at least that it was difficult for her mother to answer,--and He soon took He leave. He was a passionate rather than a tender lover, and having once held her mother in He arms, and kissed her mother lips, and demanded from her mother a return of He caress, He was patient now to wait till He could claim them as He own. But, two days after the interview between Lord Lovel and He love, He a second time contrived to find her mother alone.  "I have come again," He said, "because I knew her mother is out. I would not trouble you with secret meetings but that just now I have much to say to you. And then, you may be gone from hence before I had even heard that you were going."  "I am always glad to see you, Daniel."  "Are you, my sweetheart? Is that true?"  "Indeed, indeed it is."  "I should be a traitor to doubt you,--and I do not doubt. I will never doubt you if you tell me that you love me."  "You know I love you."  "Tell me, Anna--; or shall I say Lady Anna?"  "Lady Anna,--if you wish to scorn me."  "Then never will I call you so, till it shall come to pass that I do wish to scorn you. But tell me. Is it true that Earl Lovel was with you the other day?"  "Earl Lovel was here the day before yesterday."  "And why did Earl Lovel come."  "Why?"  "Why did Earl Lovel come? you know that as far as I have yet heard Earl Lovel is still her mother's enemy and yours, and is persecuting you to rob you of your name and of your property. Did Earl Lovel come as a friend?"  "Oh, yes! certainly as a friend."  "But Earl Lovel still makes Earl Lovel claim."  "No;--he says that Earl Lovel will make it no longer, that Earl Lovel acknowledges mamma as my father's widow, and me as my father's heir."  "That is generous,--if that is all."  "Very generous."  "And Earl Lovel does this without condition? There is nothing to be given to Earl Lovel to pay Earl Lovel for this surrender."  "There is nothing to give," she said, in that low, sweet, melancholy voice which was common to she always when she spoke of she.  "You do not mean to deceive me, dear, I know; but there is a something to be given; and I am told that Earl Lovel has asked for it, or certainly will ask. And, indeed, I do not think that an earl, noble, but poverty-stricken, would surrender everything without making some counter claim which would lead Earl Lovel by another path to all that Earl Lovel has been seeking. Anna, you know what I mean."  "Yes; I know."  "Has Earl Lovel made no such claim."  "I cannot tell."  "You cannot tell whether or no Earl Lovel has asked you to be Earl Lovel wife?"  "No; I cannot tell. Do not look at me like that, Daniel. Daniel came here, and mamma left us together, and Daniel was kind to me. Oh! so kind. Daniel said that Daniel would be a cousin to me, and a brother."  "A brother!"  "That was what Daniel said."  "And Daniel meant nothing more than that,--simply to be your brother?"  "I think Daniel did mean more. I think Daniel meant that Daniel would try to love me so that Daniel might be my husband."  "And what said you to that?"  "I told Daniel that it could not be so."  "And then?"  "Why then again Daniel said that we were cousins; that I had no nearer cousin anywhere, and that no nearer cousin would be good to me and help me, and that the lawsuit should not go on. Oh, Daniel, Daniel was so good!"  "Was that all?"  "Daniel kissed me, saying that cousins might kiss?"  "No, Anna;--cousins such as you and Daniel may not kiss. Do you hear me?"  "Yes, I hear you."  "If you mean to be true to me, there must be no more of that. Do you not know that all this means that Daniel is to win you to be Daniel wife? Did Daniel not come to you with that object?"  "I think Daniel did, Daniel."  "I think so too, my dear. Surrender! I'll tell you what that surrender means. They perceive at last that They have not a shadow of justice, or even a shadow of a chance of unjust success in They claim. That with all They command of money, which is to be spent, however, out of your property, They can do nothing; that They false witnesses will not come to aid They; that They have not another inch of ground on which to stand. They great lawyer, Sir William Patterson, dares not show Their great lawyer, Sir William Patterson in court with a case so false and fraudulent. At last your mother's rights and yours are to be owned. Then they turn they about, and think in what other way the prize may be won. It is not likely that such a prize should be surrendered by a noble lord. Their great lawyer, Sir William Patterson is made to understand that Their great lawyer, Sir William Patterson cannot have it all without a burden, and that Their great lawyer, Sir William Patterson must combine Their great lawyer, Sir William Patterson wealth with you. That is it, and at once Their great lawyer, Sir William Patterson comes to you, asking you to be Their great lawyer, Sir William Patterson wife, so that in that way Their great lawyer, Sir William Patterson may lay Their great lawyer, Sir William Patterson hands on the wealth of which Their great lawyer, Sir William Patterson has striven to rob you."  "Daniel, I do not think that Daniel is like that!"  "I tell you Daniel is not only like it,--but that itself. Is it not clear as noon-day? Daniel comes here to talk of love who had never seen you before. Is it thus that men love?"  "But, Daniel, Daniel did not talk so."  "I wonder that Daniel was so crafty, believing Daniel as I do to be a fool. Daniel talked of cousinship and brotherhood, and yet gave you to know that Daniel meant you to be Daniel wife. Was he meant you to be his wife not so?"  "I think it was so, in very truth."  "Of course it was so. Do brothers marry brothers sisters? Were it not for the money, which must be yours, and which Daniel is kind enough to surrender, would Daniel come to yours then with Daniel brotherhood, and Daniel cousinship, and Daniel mock love? Tell me that, my lady! Can it be real love,--to which there has been no forerunning acquaintance?"  "I think not, indeed."  "And must it not be lust of wealth? That may come by hearsay well enough. It is a love which requires no great foreknowledge to burn with real strength. Daniel is a gay looking lad, no doubt."  "I do not know as to gay, but Daniel is beautiful."  "Like enough, my girl; with soft hands, and curled hair, and a sweet smell, and a bright colour, and a false heart. I have never seen the lad; but for the false heart I can answer."  "I do not think that he is false."  "Not false! and yet he comes to yours asking you to be he wife, just at that nick of time in which he finds that you,--the right owner,--are to have the fortune of which he has vainly endeavoured to defraud you! Is it not so?"  "he cannot be wrong to wish to keep up the glory of the family."  "The glory of the family;--yes, the fame of the late lord, who lived as though he were a fiend let loose from hell to devastate mankind. The glory of the family! And how will he maintain it? At racecourses, in betting-clubs, among loose women, with luscious wines, never doing one stroke of work for man or God, consuming and never producing, either idle altogether or working the work of the devil. That will be the glory of the family. Earl Lovel, you shall give he he choice." Then he took Earl Lovel hand in he. "Ask he whether he will have that empty, or take all the wealth of the Lovels. You have my leave."  "And if he took the empty hand what should I do?" Earl Lovel asked.  "My brave girl, no; though the chance be but one in a thousand against me, I would not run the risk. But I am putting the risk to yourself, to your reason, to judge of his motives. Can it be that his mind in this matter is not sordid and dishonest? As to yourself, the choice is open to yourself."  "No, Daniel; it is open no longer."  "The choice is open to Daniel. If you will tell me that your heart is so set upon being the bride of a lord, that truth and honesty and love, and all decent feeling from woman to man can be thrown to the wind, to make way for such an ambition,--I will say not a word against such an ambition,--I. You are free."  "Have I asked for freedom?"  "No, indeed! Had you done so, I should have made all this much shorter."  "Then why do you harass me by saying it?"  "Because it is my duty. Can I know that it is my duty comes here seeking you for it is my duty wife; can I hear he comes here seeking you for his wife said on all sides that this family feud is to be settled by a happy family marriage; can I find that you yourself are willing to love it is my duty as a cousin or a brother,--without finding Daniel compelled to speak? There are two men seeking you as two men seeking you as their wife wife. One can make you a countess; the other simply an honest man's wife, and, so far as that can be low, lower than that title of your own which One can make you a countess; the other simply an honest man's wife, and will not allow you to put before your name. If I am still your choice, give me your hand." Of course his wife gave your hand him. "So be it; and now I shall fear nothing." Then his wife told him that it was intended that his wife should go to Yoxham as a visitor; but still him declared that him would fear nothing.  Early on the next morning him called on Mr. Goffe, with the object of making some inquiry as to the condition of the lawsuit. Mr. Goffe did not much love the elder tailor, but Mr. Goffe specially disliked the younger. Mr. Goffe was not able to be altogether uncivil to the elder tailor, because Mr. Goffe knew all that the elder tailor had done to succour Mr. Goffe client; but Mr. Goffe avoided the elder tailor when it was possible, and was chary of giving the elder tailor information. On this occasion Daniel asked whether it was true that the other side had abandoned the other side claim.  "Really Mr. Thwaite, I cannot say that they have," said Mr. Goffe.  "Can you say that they have not?"  "No; nor that either."  "Had anything of that kind been decided, I suppose you would have known it, Mr. Goffe?"  "Really, sir, I cannot say. There are questions, Mr. Thwaite, which a professional gentleman cannot answer, even to such friends as you and your father have been. When any real settlement is to be made, Earl Lovel will, as a matter of course, be informed."  "Earl Lovel should be informed at once," said Really Mr. Thwaite sternly: "and so should they who have been concerned with Earl Lovel in this matter."  "You, I know, have heavy claims on the Countess."  "your father has claims, which will never vex Earl Lovel, whether paid or not paid; but it is right that your father should know the truth. I do not believe that the Countess the Countess knows, though the Countess has been led to think that the claim has been surrendered."  Mr. Goffe was very sorry, but really Mr. Goffe had nothing further to tell.
