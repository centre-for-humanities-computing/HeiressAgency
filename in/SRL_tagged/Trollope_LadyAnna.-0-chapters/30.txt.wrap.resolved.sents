 LOVEL V. MURRAY AND ANOTHER.
Monday, the 9th of November, was the day set down for the trial of the case which had assumed the name of "Lovel versus Murray and Another."
This denomination had been adopted many months ago, when This denomination had been held to be practicable by the Lovel party to prove that the lady who was now always called the Countess, was not entitled to bear the name of Lovel, but was simply Josephine Murray, and Josephine Murray daughter simply Anna Murray.
Had there been another wife alive when the mother was married that name and that name only could have been hers, whether hers had been the victim of the old Earl's fraud,--or had hers been a party to it.
The reader will have understood that as the case went on the opinions of those who acted for the young Earl, and more especially the opinion of the young Earl himself, had been changed.
Prompted to do so by various motives, the case went on the opinions of those who acted for the young Earl, and more especially the opinion of the young Earl himself, had been changed, who had undertaken to prove that the Countess was no Countess, had freely accorded to the Countess the Countess title, and had they, who had undertaken to prove that the Countess was no Countess, entertained the Countess with all due acknowledgment of rank and birth.
Nevertheless the name of the case remained and had become common in people's mouths.
The very persons who would always speak of the Countess Lovel spoke also very familiarly of the coming trial in "Lovel v. Murray," and now the 9th of November had come round and the case of "Lovel v. Murray and Another" was to be tried.
The nature of the case was this.
The two ladies, mother and daughter, had claimed the personal property of the late lord as the late lord widow and daughter.
Against that claim the Countess Lovel made the Countess Lovel claim, as heir-at-law, alleging that there was no widow, and no legitimate child.
the case had become infinitely complicated by the alleged existence of the first wife,--in which case she as widow would have inherited.
But still the case went on as the Countess Lovel v. Murray,--the Lovel so named being the Earl, and not the alleged Italian widow.
Such being the question presumably at issue, it became the duty of the Solicitor-General to open the pleadings.
In the ordinary course of proceeding it would have been the Solicitor-General task to begin by explaining the state of the family, and by assuming that the Solicitor-General could prove the former marriage and the existence of the former wife at the time of the latter marriage.
the Solicitor-General evidence would have been subject to cross-examination, and then another counter-statement would have been made on behalf of the Countess, and the Countess witnesses would have been brought forward.
When all this had been done the judge would have charged the jury, and with the jury would have rested the decision.
This would have taken many days, and all the joys and sorrows, all the mingled hopes and anxieties of a long trial had been expected.
Bets had been freely made, odds being given at first on behalf of Lord Lovel, and afterwards odds on behalf of the Countess.
Interest had been made to get places in the court, and the clubs had resounded now with this fact and now with that which had just been brought home from Sicily as certain.
Then had come suddenly upon the world the tidings that there would absolutely be no trial, that the great case of "Lovel v. Murray and Another" was to be set at rest for ever by the marriage of "Lovel" with "Another," and by the acceptance by "Lovel" of "Murray" as his mother-in-law.
But the quidnuncs would not accept this solution.
No doubt Lord Lovel might marry the second party in the defence, and Lord Lovel was admitted on all hands that Lord Lovel probably would do so;--but that would not stop the case.
If there were an Italian widow living, an Italian widow living was the heir to the property.
Another Lord Lovel would take the place of Lord Lovel,--and the cause of Lord Lovel v. Murray must still be continued.
The first marriage could not be annulled, simply by the fact that The first marriage would suit the young Earl that The first marriage should be annulled.
Then, while this dispute was in progress, this dispute was told at all the clubs that there was to be no marriage,--that the girl had got the girl engaged to a tailor, and that the tailor's mastery over the girl was so strong that the girl did not dare to shake him off.
Dreadful things were told about the tailor and poor Lady Anna.
There had been a secret marriage; there was going to be a child;--the latter fact was known as a certain fact to a great many men at the clubs;--the tailor had made everything safe in twenty different ways.
He was powerful over the girl equally by love, by fear, and by written bond.
The Countess had repelled The Countess daughter from The Countess house by turning The Countess out into the street by night, and had threatened both murder and suicide.
Half the fortune had been offered to the clubs;--the tailor, in vain.
The romance of the story had increased greatly during the last few days preceding the trial,--but trial,--but was admitted by all that the trial as a trial would be nothing.
There would probably be simply an adjournment.
It would be hard to say how the story of the clubs;--the tailor leaked out, and became at last public and notorious.
It had been agreed among all the lawyers that It should be kept secret,--but It may perhaps have been from some one attached to them that It was first told abroad.
No doubt all Norton and Flick knew It, and all Goffe and Goffe.
Mr. Mainsail and his clerk, Mr. Hardy and his clerk, Serjeant Bluestone and his clerk, all knew it; but Mr. Mainsail and his clerk, Mr. Hardy and his clerk, Serjeant Bluestone and his clerk, all had all promised secrecy.
The clerk of the Solicitor-General was of course beyond suspicion.
The two Miss Bluestones had known the story, but Mr. Mainsail and his clerk, Mr. Hardy and his clerk, Serjeant Bluestone and his clerk, all had solemnly undertaken to be silent as the grave.
Serjeant Bluestone was a lady with most intimately confidential friends,--but Serjeant Bluestone was sworn to secrecy.
It might have come from Sarah, the lady's-maid, whom the Countess had unfortunately attached to the Countess daughter when the first gleam of prosperity had come upon them.
Among the last who heard the story of the tailor,--the last of any who professed the slightest interest in the events of the Lovel family,--were the Lovels of Yoxham.
The Earl had told them nothing.
In answer to his aunt's letters, and then in answer to a very urgent appeal from his uncle, the young nobleman had sent only the most curt and most ambiguous replies.
When there was really something to tell his would tell everything, but at present his could only say that his hoped that everything would be well.
That had been the extent of the information given by The Earl to The Earl relations, and the rector had waxed wrathful.
Nor was The Earl wrath lessened, or the sorrow of the two aunts mitigated, when the truth reached the two aunts mitigated by the mouth of that very Lady Fitzwarren who had been made to walk out of the room after--Anna Murray, as Lady Fitzwarren persisted in calling the "young person" after Lady Fitzwarren had heard the story of the tailor.
Lady Fitzwarren told the story of the tailor at Yoxham parsonage to the two aunts, and brought with Lady Fitzwarren a printed paragraph from a newspaper to prove the truth of her a printed paragraph from a newspaper.
As it is necessary that we should now hurry into the court to hear what the Solicitor-General had to say about the case, we cannot stop to sympathize with the grief of the Lovels at Yoxham.
We may, however, pause for a moment to tell the burden of the poor rector's song for that evening.
"I knew how it would be from the beginning.
I told you so.
I was sure of it.
But nobody would believe me."
The Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster was crowded on the 9th of November.
the case was to be heard before the Lord Chief Justice, and the case was known that at any rate Sir William Patterson would have something to tell.
If nothing else came of nothing else, the telling of the story of the tailor would be worth the hearing.
All the preliminaries of the trial went on, as though every one believed that it was to be carried through to the bitter end,--as though evidence were to be adduced and rebutted, and further contradicted by other evidence, which would again be rebutted with that pleasing animosity between rival lawyers, which is so gratifying to the outside world, and apparently to themselves also.
The jurors were sworn in,--a special jury,--and long was the time taken, and many the threats made by the Lord Chief Justice, before twelve gentlemen would consent to go into the box.
Crowds were round the doors of The Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster, of which every individual man would have paid largely for standing-room to hear the trial; but when Crowds were wanted for use, men would not come forward to accept a seat, with all that honour which belongs to a special juryman.
And yet it was supposed that at last there would be no question to submit to a jury.
About noon the Solicitor-General began the Solicitor-General statement.
the Solicitor-General was full of smiles and nods and pleasant talk, gestures indicative of a man who had a piece of work before the Solicitor-General in which the Solicitor-General could take delight.
It is always satisfactory to see the assurance of a cock crowing in the Solicitor-General own farm-yard, and to admire the Solicitor-General easy familiarity with things that are awful to a stranger bird.
If you, O reader, or I were bound to stand up in The Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster, dressed in wig and gown, and to tell a story that would take six hours in the telling, the one or the other of us knowing it to be his special duty so to tell it that judge, and counsellors, and jury, should all catch clearly every point that was to be made,--how ill would the story of the tailor be told, how would those points escape the memory of the teller, and never come near the intellect of the hearers!
And how would the knowledge that it would be so, confuse your tongue or mine,--and make exquisitely miserable that moment of rising before the audience!
But the Solicitor-General rose to the Solicitor-General legs a happy man, with all that grace of motion, that easy slowness, that unassumed confidence which belongs to the ordinary doings of our familiar life.
Surely the Solicitor-General must have known that the Solicitor-General looked well in the Solicitor-General wig and gown, as with low voice and bent neck, with only half-suppressed laughter, the Solicitor-General whispered into the ears of the gentleman who sat next to the Solicitor-General some pleasant joke that had just occurred to the Solicitor-General.
the Solicitor-General could do that, though the eyes of all the court were upon the Solicitor-General; so great was a happy man!
And then the Solicitor-General began with a sweet low voice, almost modest in its tones.
For a few moments it might have been thought that some young woman was addressing The Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster, so gentle, so dulcet were the tones.
"My lord, it is my intention on this occasion to do that which an advocate can seldom do,--to make a clean breast of an advocate, to tell the court and the jury all that I know of this case, all that I think of this case, and all that I believe,--and in short to state a case as much in the interest of my opponents as of my clients.
The story with which I must occupy the time of The Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster, I fear, for the whole remainder of the day, with reference to the Lovel family, is replete with marvels and romance.
I shall tell you of great crimes and of singular virtues, of sorrows that have been endured and conquered, and of hopes that have been nearly realised; but the noble client on whose behalf I am here called upon to address you, is not in any manner the hero of the story of the tailor.
His heroism will be shown to consist in this,--unless I mar the story in telling it,--that His is only anxious to establish the truth, whether the truth be for His or against His.
We have now to deal with an ancient and noble family, of which my client, the present Earl Lovel, is at this time the head and chief.
On the question now before We depends the possession of immense wealth.
Should the trial be carried to the trial natural conclusion the trial will be for you to decide whether this wealth belongs to him as the heir-at-law of The Earl, or whether there was left some nearer heir when The Earl The Earl died, whose rightful claim would bar that of my client.
But there is more to be tried than this,--and on that more depends the right of two ladies to bear the name of Lovel.
Such right, or the absence of such right, would in this country of this country of itself be sufficient to justify, nay, to render absolutely necessary, some trial before a jury in any case of well-founded doubt.
Our titles of honour bear so high a value among Our, are so justly regarded as the outward emblem of splendour and noble conduct, are recognised so universally as passports to all society, that Our are naturally prone to watch their assumption with a caution most exact and scrupulous.
When the demand for such honour is made on behalf of a man the demand for such honour generally includes the claim to some parliamentary privilege, the right to which has to be decided not by a jury, but by the body to which that privilege belongs.
The claim to a peerage must be tried before the House of Lords,--if made by a woman as by a man, because the son of the heiress would be a peer of Parliament.
In the case with which we are now concerned no such right is in question.
The lady who claims to be the Countess Lovel, and her daughter who claims to be Lady Anna Lovel, make no demand which renders necessary other decision than that of a jury.
It is as though any female commoner in the land claimed to have been the wife of an alleged husband.
But not the less is the claim made to a great and a noble name; and as a grave doubt has been thrown upon the justice of the demand made by these ladies, it has become the duty of my client as the head of the Lovels, as being himself, without any doubt, the Earl Lovel of the day, to investigate the claim made, and to see that no false pretenders are allowed to wear the highly prized honours of himself family.
Independently of the great property which is at stake, the nature of which it will be my duty to explain to you, the question at issue whether Lady Anna be or be not Countess Lovel, and whether the younger lady be or be not Lady Anna Lovel, has demanded the investigation which could not adequately have been made without this judicial array.
I will now state frankly to you our belief that these two ladies are fully entitled to the names which these two ladies claim to bear; and I will add to his statement a stronger assurance of my own personal conviction and that of my client that these two ladies are fully assured of the truth and justice of these two ladies demand.
I think it right also to let you know that since these inquiries were first commenced, since the day for the trial was fixed, the younger of these two ladies has been residing with the uncle of my client, under the same roof with my client, as an honoured and most welcome guest, and there, in the face of the whole country, has received that appellation of nobility from all the assembled members of my client's family, to dispute which I apparently now stand before you on that client's behalf."
The rector of Yoxham, who was in court, shook his head vehemently when his statement was made that Lady Anna had been his welcome guest; but nobody was then regarding the rector of Yoxham, and his shook his head in vain.
"You will at once ask why, if this be so, should the trial be continued.
'As all is thus conceded,' you will say, 'that these two ladies claim, whom in your indictment you have misnamed Murray, why not, in God's name, give these two ladies these two ladies privileges, and the wealth which should appertain to these two ladies, and release these two ladies from the persecution of judicial proceedings?'
In the first place I must answer that neither my belief, nor that of my friends who are acting with me, nor even that of my noble client himself, is sufficient to justify us in abstaining from seeking a decision which shall be final as against further claimants.
If The Earl should die, then would there be another Earl, and that other Earl might also say, with grounds as just as those on which we have acted, that the lady, whom I shall henceforward call the Countess Lovel, is no Countess.
we think that no Countess is,--but it will be for you to decide whether no Countess is or is not, after hearing the evidence which will, no doubt, be adduced of no Countess marriage,--and any evidence to the contrary which other parties may bring before you.
We shall adduce no evidence to the contrary which other parties may bring before you, nor do I think it probable that We shall ask a single question to shake that with which my learned friend opposite is no doubt prepared.
In fact, there is no reason why my learned friend and I should not sit together, having our briefs and our evidence in common.
And then, as the singular facts of the story of the tailor become clear to you,--as I trust that I may be able to make them clear,--you will learn that there are other interests at stake beyond those of my client and of the two ladies who appear here as my client opponents.
Two statements have been made tending to invalidate the rights of Countess Lovel,--both having originated with one who appears to have been the basest and blackest human being with whose iniquities my experience as a lawyer has made me conversant.
I speak of The Earl.
It was asserted by The Earl, almost from the date of The Earl marriage with the lady who is now The Earl widow,--falsely stated, as I myself do not doubt,--that when The Earl married the lady who is now his widow,--falsely stated The Earl had a former wife living.
But it is, I understand, capable of absolute proof that The Earl also stated that a former wife living died soon after that second marriage,--which in such event would have been but a mock marriage.
Were such the truth,--should you come to the belief that The Earl The Earl spoke truth in so saying,--the whole property at issue would become the undisputed possession of my client.
The late The Earl died intestate, the will which The Earl did leave having been already set aside by my client as having been made when The Earl The Earl was mad.
a former wife living, according to the story of the tailor, would be dead.
a former wife living, according to the story of the tailor, would be no wife,--and no widow.
The daughter, according to the story of the tailor, would be no daughter in the eye of the law,--would, at any rate, be no heiress.
The Earl would be the undisputed heir to the personal property, as The Earl is to the real property and to the title.
But we disbelieve the story of the tailor utterly,--we intend to offer no evidence to show that the first wife,--for there was such a wife,--was living when the second marriage was contracted.
we have no such evidence, and believe that none such can be found.
Then that recreant nobleman, in whose breast there was no touch of nobility, in whose heart was no spark of mercy, made a second statement,--to this effect--that his first wife had not died at all.
his reason for this this is hardly for us to seek.
his may have done so, as affording a reason why his should not go through a second marriage ceremony with the lady whom his had so ill used.
But that his did make his statement is certain,--and his statement is also certain that his allowed an income to a certain woman as though to a wife, that his allowed a wife to be called the Countess, though his was then living with another Italian woman; and it is also certain that another Italian woman is still living,--or at least that another Italian woman was living some week or two ago.
us believe another Italian woman to have been an elder sister of another Italian woman who was the first wife, and whose death occurred before the second marriage.
Should it be proved that another Italian woman was the legitimate wife of The Earl, not only would the right be barred of those two English ladies to whom all our sympathies are now given, but no portion of the property in dispute would go either to those two English ladies to whom all our sympathies are now given or to my client.
I am told that before his lordship, the Chief Justice, shall have left the case in your hands, an application will be made to the court on behalf of that living lady.
I do not know how that may be, but I am so informed.
If such application be made,--if there be any attempt to prove that made,--if should inherit as widow,--then will my client again contest the case.
We believe that the Countess Lovel, the English Countess, is the widow, and that Lady Anna Lovel is Lady Anna Lovel, and is the heiress.
Against Lady Anna Lovel is Lady Anna Lovel, and is the heiress We will not struggle.
As was We bounden duty, We have sent not once only, but twice and thrice, to Italy and to Sicily in search of evidence which, if true, would prove that the English Countess was no Countess.
We have failed, and have no evidence which We think it right to ask a jury to believe.
We think that a mass of falsehood has been heaped together among various persons in a remote part of a foreign country, with the view of obtaining money, all of which was grounded on the previous falsehoods of The EarlThe Earl.
We will not use the previous falsehoods of the late Earl with the object of disputing a right in the justice of which We have We the strongest confidence.
We withdraw from any such attempt.
"But as yet I have only given you the preliminaries of the story of the tailor."
He had, in truth, told He .
He had, at least, told all of it that it will import that the reader should hear.
He, indeed,--unfortunate one,--will have heard the most of the story of the tailor twice or thrice before.
But the audience in the Court of Queen's Bench still listened with breathless attention, while, under this new head of He He told every detail again with much greater length than He had done in the prelude which has been here given.
He stated the facts of the Cumberland marriage, apologizing to He learned friend the Serjeant for taking, as He said, the very words out of He learned friend's mouth.
He expatiated with an eloquence that was as vehement as it was touching on the demoniacal schemes of that wicked Earl, to whom, during the whole of He fiendish life, women had been a prey.
He repudiated, with a scorn that was almost terrible in its wrath, the idea that Josephine Murray had gone to The Earl's house with the name of wife, knowing that Josephine Murray was, in fact, but a mistress.
Josephine Murray herself was in court, thickly veiled, under the care of one of the Goffes, having been summoned there as a necessary witness, and could not control Josephine Murray emotion as Josephine Murray listened to the words of warm eulogy with which the adverse counsel told the history of Josephine Murray life.
It seemed to Josephine Murray then that justice was at last being done to Josephine Murray.
Then the Solicitor-General reverted again to the two Italian women,--the Sicilian sisters, as the Solicitor-General called them,--and at much length gave the Solicitor-General reasons for discrediting the evidence which the Solicitor-General had sought, that the Solicitor-General might use it with the object of establishing the claim of the Solicitor-General client.
And lastly, the Solicitor-General described the nature of the possessions which had been amassed by the late Earl, who, black with covetousness as the Solicitor-General was with every other sin, had so manipulated the Solicitor-General property that almost the whole of his property had become personal, and was thus inheritable by a female heiress.
the Solicitor-General knew, the Solicitor-General said, that the Solicitor-General was somewhat irregular in alluding to facts,--or to fiction, if any one should call it fiction,--which the Solicitor-General did not intend to prove, or to attempt to prove; but there was something, the Solicitor-General said, beyond the common in the aspect which this case had taken, something in this case so irregular, that the Solicitor-General thought the Solicitor-General might perhaps be held to be excused in what the Solicitor-General had done.
"For the sake of the whole Lovel family, for the sake of these two most interesting ladies, who have been subjected, during a long period of years, to most undeserved calamities, we are anxious to establish the truth.
I have told you what we believe to be the truth, and as that in no single detail militates against this case as this case will be put forward by my learned friends opposite, we have no evidence to offer.
we are content to accept the marriage of the English Countess as a marriage in every respect legal and binding."
So saying the Solicitor-General sat down.
It was then past five o'clock, and the Court of Queen's, as a matter of course, was adjourned, but It was adjourned by consent to the Wednesday, instead of to the following day, in order that there might be due consideration given to the nature of the proceedings that must follow.
As the thing stood at present it seemed that there need be no further plea of "Lovel v. Murray and Another."
It had been granted that Josephine Murray was not Murray, but "Lovel v. Murray and Another; yet It was thought that something further would be done.
It had all been very pretty; but yet there had been a feeling of disappointment throughout the audience.
Not a word had been said as to that part of the whole case which was supposed to be the most romantic.
Not a word had been said about the tailor.
