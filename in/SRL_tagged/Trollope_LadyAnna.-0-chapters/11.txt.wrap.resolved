 THE FIRST INTERVIEW.   For some days after the intimation of Lady Anna mother's purpose, Lady Anna kept Lady Anna bed. Lady Anna begged that Lady Anna might not see a doctor. Lady Anna had a headache,--nothing but a headache. But it was quite impossible that Lady Anna should ever marry Earl Lovel. This Lady Anna said whenever her mother would revert to that subject,--"I have not seen subject,--"I, mamma; I do not know subject,--"I. I am sure it would be impossible." Then, when at last Lady Anna was induced to dress Lady Anna, Lady Anna was still unwilling to be forced to undergo the interview to which Lady Anna had acknowledged that Lady Anna must be subjected. At last Lady Anna consented to spend a day in Bedford Square; to dine there, and to be brought home in the evening. The Countess was at this time not very full of trust in the Serjeant, having learned that The Countess was opposed to the marriage scheme, but The Countess was glad that The Countess daughter should be induced to go out, even to the Serjeant's house, as after that visit Lady Anna could have no ground on which to oppose the meeting which was to be arranged. The Countess could hardly plead that The Countess was too ill to see The Countess cousin when The Countess had dined with Mrs. Bluestone.  During this time many plans had been proposed for the meeting which was to be arranged. The Solicitor-General, discussing the matter with the young lord, had thought it best that The Countess should at once be asked down to Yoxham,--as the Lady Anna; and the young lord would have been quite satisfied with such an arrangement. the young lord could have gone about the young lord obligatory wooing among the young lord own friends, in the house to which the young lord had been accustomed, with much more ease than in a London lodging. But the young lord uncle, who had corresponded on the subject with Mr. Hardy, still objected. "We should be giving up everything," the young lord said, "if We were once to call The CountessThe Countess. Where should We be then if they didn't hit it off together? I don't believe, and I never shall believe, that The Countess is really Lady Anna Lovel." The Solicitor-General, when The Solicitor-General heard of this objection, shook The Solicitor-General head, finding The Solicitor-General almost provoked to anger. What asses were these people not to understand that The Solicitor-General could see further into the matter than these people could do, and that these people best way out of these people difficulty would be frankly to open these people arms to the heiress! Should these people continue to be pig-headed and prejudiced, everything would soon be gone.  Then The Solicitor-General had a scheme for inviting the girl to The Solicitor-General own house, and to a scheme for inviting the girl to his own house The Solicitor-General obtained The Solicitor-General wife's consent. But here The Solicitor-General courage failed The Solicitor-General; or, it might be fairer to say, that The Solicitor-General prudence prevailed. The Solicitor-General was very anxious, intensely eager, so to arrange this great family dispute that all should be benefited,--believing, nay feeling positively certain that all concerned in the matter were honest; but The Solicitor-General must not go so far as to do The Solicitor-General an absolute and grievous damage, should it at last turn out that The Solicitor-General was wrong in any of The Solicitor-General surmises. So that plan was abandoned.  There was nothing left for that plan but that the young Earl should the young Earl face the difficulty, and be introduced to the girl at the lodging in Wyndham Street. But, as a prelude to this, a meeting was arranged at Mr. Flick's chambers between the Countess and her proposed son-in-law. That the young Earl should go to the young Earl own attorney's chambers was all in rule. While the young Earl was there the Countess came,--which was not in rule, and almost induced the Serjeant to declare, when the young Earl heard it, that the young Earl would have nothing more to do with the case. "My lord," said the Countess came,--which, "I am glad to meet you, and I hope that we may be friends." The young man was less collected, and stammered out a few words that were intended to be civil.  "It is a pity that you should have conflicting interests," said his own attorney.  "I hope it need not continue to be so," said the Countess came,--which. "My heart, Lord Lovel, is all in the welfare of we joint family. we will begrudge you nothing if you will not begrudge we the names which are we own, and without which we cannot live honourably before the world." Then some other few words were muttered, and the Earl promised to come to Wyndham Street at a certain hour. Not a word was then said about the marriage. the Countess came,--which, with all the Countess came,--which resolution and all the Countess came,--which courage, did not find the Countess came,--which able in set terms to ask The young man to marry the Countess came,--which daughter.  "the Countess came,--which is a very handsome woman," said My lord to the attorney, when the Countess came,--which the Countess came,--which had left them.  "Yes, indeed."  "And like a lady."  "Quite like a lady. a lady was of a good family."  "I suppose a lady certainly was the late Earl's wife, Mr. Flick?"  "Who can say, My lord? That is just the question. The Solicitor-General thinks that a lady would prove a lady right, and I do not know that I have ever found The Solicitor-General to be wrong when The Solicitor-General has had a steadfast opinion."  "Why should we not give it up to a lady at once?"  "I couldn't recommend that, My lord. Why should we give that up? The interests at stake are very great. I couldn't for a moment think of suggesting to you to give that up."  "I want nothing, Mr. Flick, that does not belong to me."  "Just so. But then perhaps it does belong to you. we can never be sure. No doubt the safest way will be for you to contract an alliance with a lady. Of course we should give you to contract an alliance with this lady up then, but the settlements would make the property all right." The young Earl did not quite like you to contract an alliance with this lady. The young Earl would rather have commenced The young Earl wooing after the girl had been established in the girl own right, and when the girl would have had no obligation on the girl to accept The young Earl. But The young Earl had consented, and it was too late for The young Earl now to recede. it had been already arranged that The young Earl should call in Wyndham Street at noon on the following day, in order that The young Earl might be introduced to The young Earl cousin.  On that evening The young Earl sat late with The young Earl daughter, purposing that on the morrow nothing should be said before the interview calculated to disturb the girl's mind. But as they sat together through the twilight and into the darkness of night, close by the open window, through which the heavily laden air of the metropolis came to they, hot with all the heat of a London July day, very many words were spoken by The young Earl. "It will be for you, to-morrow, to make or to mar all that I have been doing since the day on which you were born."  "Oh! mamma, that is so terrible a thing to say!"  "But terrible things must be said if they are true. It is so. It is for you to decide whether we shall triumph, or be utterly and for ever crushed."  "I cannot understand it. Why should we be crushed? He would not wish to marry me if this fortune were not mine. He is not coming, mamma, because He loves me."  "You say that because you do not understand. Do you suppose that my name will be allowed to me if you should refuse your cousin's suit? If so, you are very much mistaken. The fight will go on, and as we have not money, we shall certainly go to the wall at last. Why should you not love him? There is no one else that you care for."  "No, mamma," mamma said slowly.  "Then, what more can you want?"  "I do not know him, mamma."  "But you will know him. According to that, mamma would ever get married. Is it not a great thing that you should be asked to assume and to enjoy the rank which has belonged to your mother, but which mamma has never been able to enjoy?"  "I do not think, mamma, that I care much about rank."  "Anna!" your mother's mind as your mother heard this flew off to the young tailor. Had misery so great as this overtaken mamma after all?  "I mean that I don't care so much about it. it has never done us any good."  "But if it is a thing that is your own, that you are born to, you must bear it, whether it be in sorrow or in joy; whether it be a blessing or a curse. If it be yours, you cannot fling it be yours away from yours. You may disgrace it be yours, but you must still have it be yours. Though you were to throw yours away upon a chimney-sweeper, you must still be Lady Anna, the daughter of Earl Lovel."  "I needn't call yours so."  "Others must call you so. It is your name, and you cannot be rid of It. It is yours of right, as my name has been mine of right; and not to assert it, not to live up to it, not to be proud of it, would argue incredible baseness. 'Noblesse oblige.' You have heard that motto, and know what that motto means. And then would you throw away from yours in some childish phantasy all that I have been struggling to win for yours during my whole life? Have you ever thought of what my life has been, The Countess?"  "Yes, mamma."  "Would you have the heart to disappoint me, now that the victory is won;--now that the victory may be made our own by your help? And what is it that I am asking you to do? If this man were bad,--if this man were such a one as your father, if this man were bad,--if drunken, cruel, ill-conditioned, or even heavy, foolish, or deformed; had you been told stories to set you against this man, as that this man had been false with other women, I could understand he had been false with other women. In that case our would at any rate find out the truth before our went on. But of this man our hear that this man is good, and pleasant; an excellent young man, who has endeared this man to all who know this man. Such a one that all the girls of this man own standing in the world would give all the girls of his own standing in the world eyes to win this man."  "Let some girl win him then who cares for him."  "But him wishes to win you, dearest."  "Not because him loves me. How can him love me when him never saw me? How can I love him when I never saw him?"  "him wishes to win you because him has heard what you are, and because him knows that by doing so him can set things right which for many years have been wrong."  "It is because him would get all this money."  "You would both get it. him desires nothing unfair. Whatever him takes from you, so much him will give. And it is not only for this generation. Is it nothing to you that the chiefs of your own family who shall come after you shall be able to hold your own family heads up among other British peers? Would you not wish that your own son should come to be Earl Lovel, with wealth sufficient to support the dignity?"  "I don't think it would make your own son happy, mamma."  "There is something more in this, The Countess, than I can understand. You used not to be so. When we talked of these things in past years you used not to be indifferent."  "I was not asked then to--to--marry a man I did not care for."  "There is something else, The Countess."  "No, mamma."  "If there be nothing else you will learn to care for your own son. You will see your own son to-morrow, and will be left alone with your own son. I will sit with you for a time, and then I will leave you. All that I ask of you is to receive your own son to-morrow without any prejudice against your own son. You must remember how much depends on you, and that you are not as other girls are." After that The Countess was allowed to go to The Countess bed, and to weep in solitude over the wretchedness of The Countess condition. It was not only that The Countess loved Daniel Thwaite with all Daniel Thwaite heart,--loved Daniel Thwaite with a love that had grown with every year of The Countess growth;--but that The Countess feared Daniel Thwaite also. Daniel Thwaite had become The Countess master; and even could The Countess have brought The Countess to be false, The Countess would have lacked the courage to declare The Countess falsehood to the man to whom The Countess had vowed The Countess love.  On the following morning The Countess did not come down to breakfast, and The young Earl began to fear that The young Earl would be unable to induce The young Earl girl to rise in time to receive their visitor. But the poor child had resolved to receive Daniel Thwaite's visit, and contemplated no such escape as that. At eleven o'clock The Countess slowly dressed The Countess, and before twelve crept down into the one sitting-room which they occupied. The young Earl The young Earl glanced round at The Countess, anxious to see that The young Earl was looking The young Earl best. Certain instructions had been given as to The young Earl dress, and the garniture of The young Earl hair, and the disposal of The young Earl ribbons. All these had been fairly well obeyed; but there was a fixed, determined hardness in The young Earl face which made The young Earl mother fear that the Earl the Earl might be dismayed. her mother knew that her mother had never looked like that before.  Punctually at twelve the Earl the Earl was announced. The young Earl The young Earl received The young Earl very pleasantly, and with great composure. The young Earl shook hands with The young Earl as though hands had known each other all hands lives, and then introduced The young Earl to her daughter with a sweet smile. "I hope you will acknowledge The young Earl as your far-away cousin, my lord. Blood, Blood say, is thicker than water; and, if so, you two ought to be friends."  "I am sure I hope we may be," said the Earl.  "I hope so too,--my lord," said the girl, as the girl left the girl hand quite motionless in his.  "we heard of you down in Cumberland," said The young Earl. "It is long since I have seen the old place, but I shall never forget the old place. There is not a bush among the mountains there that I shall not remember,--ay, into the next world, if aught of we memories are left to we."  "I love the mountains there; but the house is very gloomy."  "Gloomy indeed. If you found it sad, what must it have been to The young Earl? I hope that I may tell you some day of all that I suffered there. There are things to tell of which I have never yet spoken to human being. She, poor child, has been too young and too tender to be troubled by such a tale. I sometimes think that no tragedy ever written, no story of horrors ever told, can have exceeded in description the things which I endured in that one year of my married life." Then She went on at length, not telling the details of that terrible year, but speaking generally of the hardships of my married life. "I have never wondered, Lord Lovel, that you and your nearest relations should have questioned my position. A bad man had surrounded me with such art in A bad man wickedness, that it has been almost beyond my strength to rid A bad man of A bad man toils." All this She had planned beforehand, having resolved that She would rush into the midst of things at once, and if possible enlist A bad man sympathies on She side.  "I hope it may be over now," A bad man said.  "Yes," She replied, rising slowly from She seat, "I hope it may be over now." The moment had come in which She had to play the most difficult stroke of She whole game, and much might depend on the way in which She played it. She could not leave The moment had come in which she had to play the most difficult stroke of her whole game together, walking abruptly out of the one sitting-room which they occupied, without giving some excuse for so unusual a proceeding. "Indeed, I hope it may be over now, both for us and for you, Lord Lovel. A bad man, in leaving behind such cause of quarrel, has injured you almost as deeply as us. I pray God that you and that the girl may so look into each other's hearts and trust each other's purposes, that you may be able to set right the ill which your predecessor did. If so, the family of Lovel for centuries to come may be able to bless your names." Then with slow steps She left the one sitting-room which they occupied.  The Countess had spoken one word, and that was all. It certainly was not for The Countess now to speak. The Countess sat leaning on the table, with The Countess eyes fixed upon the ground, not daring to look at the man who had been brought to The Countess as The Countess future husband. A single glance The Countess had taken as he entered the one sitting-room which they occupied, and The Countess had seen at once that he was fair and handsome, that he still had that sweet winsome boyishness of face which makes a girl feel that a girl need not fear a man,--that he has something of a girl own weakness, and need not be treated as one who is wise, grand, or heroic. And a girl saw too in one glance how different he was from Daniel Thwaite, the man to whom a girl had absolutely given herself;--and a girl understood at the moment something of the charm of luxurious softness and aristocratic luxury. Daniel Thwaite was swarthy, hard-handed, blackbearded,--with a noble fire in Daniel Thwaite eyes, but with an innate coarseness about Daniel Thwaite mouth which betokened roughness as well as strength. Had it been otherwise with a girl than it was, a girl might, a girl thought, have found it easy enough to love the Earl. As it was, there was nothing for a girl to do but to wait and answer the Earl as best a girl might.  "The Countess," the Earl said.  "My lord!"  "Will it not be well that we should be friends?"  "Oh,--friends;--yes, my lord."  "I will tell you all and everything;--that is, about the Earl. I was brought up to believe that you and your mother were just--impostors."  "My lord!"  , we are not impostors."  "No;--I believe it. I am sure you are not. Mistakes have been made, but No;--I has not been of my doing. As a boy, what could I believe but what I was told? I know now that you are and always have been as you have called yourself. If nothing else comes of nothing else, I will at any rate say so much. The estate which your father left is no doubt yourself. If I could hinder nothing else, there should be no more law."  "Thank you, My lord!"  ."  "your mother says that your mother has suffered much. I am sure your mother has suffered. I trust that all that is over now. I have come here to-day more to say that on my own behalf than anything else." A shadow of a shade of disappointment, the slightest semblance of a cloud, passed across your mother heart as your mother heard this. But it was well. your mother could not have married him, even if him had wished it, and now, as it seemed, that difficulty was over. your mother mother and those lawyers had been mistaken, and it was well that him should tell your mother so at once.  "It is very good of you, My lord!"  ."  "I would not have you think of me that I could come to you hoping that you would promise me your love before I had shown you whether I had loved you or not."  "No, My lord!"  ." your mother hardly understood My lord!"   now,--whether My lord!"   intended to propose My lord!"   as a suitor for your mother hand or not.  "You, The Countess, are your father's heir. I am your cousin, Earl Lovel, as poor a peer as there is in England. your cousin, Earl Lovel, as poor a peer tell me that we should marry because you are rich and I am an earl."  "So your cousin, Earl Lovel, as poor a peer tell me;--but that will not make it right."  "I would not have it so, even if I dared to think that you would agree to it."  "Oh, no, My lord!"  ; nor would I."  "But if you could learn to love me--"  "No, my lord;--no."  "Do not answer me yet, my cousin. If I swore that I loved you,--loved you so soon after seeing you,--and loved you, too, knowing you to be so wealthy an heiress--"  "Ah, do not talk of that."  "Well;--not of that. But if I said that I loved you, you would not believe me."  "It would not be true, My lord!"  ."  "But I know that I shall love you. You will let me try? You are very lovely, and your cousin, Earl Lovel, as poor a peer tell me you are sweet-humoured. I can believe well that you are sweet and pleasant. You will let me try to love you, The Countess?"  "No, my lord."  "Must it be so, so soon?"  "Yes, my lord."  "Why that? Is it because we are strangers to each other? That may be cured;--if not quickly, as I would have it cured, slowly and by degrees; slowly as you can wish, if only I may come where you shall be. You have said that we may be friends."  "Oh yes,--friends, I hope."  "Friends at least. we are born cousins."  "Yes, my lord."  "Cannot you call me by my name? Cousins, you know, do so. And remember this, you will have and can have my cousin. I am bound at least to be a brother to Cousins."  "Oh, be my brother!"  "That,--or more than that. I would fain be more than that. But I will be that, at least. As I came to Cousins, before I saw you, I felt that whenever we knew each other I could not be less to Cousins than that. If I am your friend, I must be your best friend,--as being, though poor, the head of your family. The Lovels should at least love each other; and cousins may love, even though cousins should not love enough to be man and wife."  "I will love you so always."  "Enough to be my wife?"  "Enough to be your dear cousin,--your loving sister."  "So it shall be,--unless it can be more. I would not ask you for more now. I would not wish you to give more now. But think of me, and ask Cousins whether you can dare to give Cousins to me altogether."  "I cannot dare, My lord!"  ."  "You would not call your brother, lord. my name is Frederic. But Anna, dear Anna,"--and then Frederic took Anna, dear Anna,"--and unresisting hand,--"you shall not be asked for more now. But cousins, new-found cousins, who love each other, and will stand by each other for help and aid against the next world, may surely kiss,--as would a brother and a sister. You will not grudge me a kiss." Then my wife put up my wife cheek innocently, and he kissed her cheek gently,--hardly with a lover's kiss. "I will leave you now," he said, still holding my wife hand. "But tell your mother thus:--that your mother shall no longer be troubled by lawyers at the suit of your mother cousin Frederic. your mother is to me Lord Lovel, and your mother shall be treated by me with the honour suited to your mother rank." And so me left the house without seeing The young Earl again.
