 NEW FRIENDS.   The introduction to Yoxham followed quickly upon the Earl's visit to Wyndham Street. There was a great consultation at the rectory before a decision could be made as to the manner in which the invitation should be given. the Earl thought that the Earl should be sent to the mother. The rector combated this view very strongly, still hoping that though The rector might be driven to call the girl Lady Anna, The rector might postpone the necessity of acknowledging the countess-ship of the mother till the marriage should have been definitely acknowledged. Mrs. Lovel thought that if the girl were Lady Anna, then the mother must be the Countess Lovel, and that it would be as well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb. But the wisdom of Aunt Julia sided with Aunt Julia brother, though Aunt Julia did not share her brother's feelings of animosity to the two women. "It is understood that the girl is to be invited, and not the mother," said Miss Lovel; "and as it is quite possible that the thing should fail,--in which case the lawsuit might possibly go on,--the less we acknowledge the better." The Earl declared that the lawsuit couldn't go on,--that The Earl would not carry the lawsuit couldn't go on. "My dear Frederic, you are not the only person concerned. The lady in Italy, who still calls Aunt Julia Countess Lovel, may renew the suit on Aunt Julia own behalf as soon as you have abandoned the suit. Should Aunt Julia succeed, you would have to make what best compromise you could with Aunt Julia respecting the property. That is the way I understand it." This exposition of the case by Miss Lovel was so clear that the case by Miss Lovel carried the day, and accordingly a letter was written by Miss Lovel, addressed to Lady Anna Lovel, asking Lady Anna Lovel to come and spend a few days at Yoxham. Lady Anna Lovel could bring Lady Anna Lovel maid with Lady Anna Lovel or not as Lady Anna Lovel liked; but Lady Anna Lovel could have the service of Miss Lovel's lady's maid if Lady Anna Lovel chose to come unattended. a letter sounded cold when a letter was read, but the writer signed Lady Anna Lovel, "Lady Anna Lovel affectionately, Lady Anna Lovel." It was addressed to "The Lady Anna Lovel, to the care of Messrs. Goffe and Goffe, solicitors, Raymond's Buildings, Gray's Inn."  Lady Anna Lovel was allowed to read It first; but Lady Anna Lovel read It in the presence of Lady Anna Lovel mother, to whom Lady Anna Lovel handed It at once, as a matter of course. A black frown came across the Countess's brow, and a look of displeasure, almost of anger, rested on Lady Anna Lovel countenance. "Is it wrong, mamma?" asked Lady Anna Lovel.  "It is a part of the whole;--but, my dear, it shall not signify. Conquerors cannot be conquerors all at once, nor can the vanquished be expected to submit Conquerors with a grace. But a grace will come. And though Conquerors should ignore me utterly, that will be as nothing. I have not clung to this for years past to win Conquerors loves."  "I will not go, mamma, if they are unkind to you."  "You must go, my dear. It is only that they are weak enough to think that they can acknowledge you, and yet continue to deny to me my rights. But it matters nothing. Of course you shall go,--and you shall go as the daughter of the Countess Lovel."  That mention of the lady's-maid had been unfortunate. the Countess Lovel had simply desired to make it easy for the young lady to come without a servant to wait upon the young lady, and had treated the Countess Lovel husband's far-away cousin as elder ladies often do treat those who are younger when the question of the lady's-maid may become a difficulty. But the Countess, who would hardly the Countess Lovel have thought of it, now declared that the Countess Lovel girl should go attended as her girl rank demanded. Lady Anna, therefore, under Lady Anna mother's dictation, wrote the following reply:--      Wyndham Street, 3rd August, 183--.     DEAR MRS. LOVEL,     I shall be happy to accept your kind invitation to Yoxham,    but can hardly do so before the 10th. On that day I will    leave London for York inside the mail-coach. Perhaps you    can be kind enough to have me met where the mail-coach stops.    As you are so good as to say you can take the young lady in, I will    bring my own maid.     Yours affectionately,     ANNA LOVEL.   "But, mamma, I don't want a maid," said the girl, who had never been waited on in a maid life, and who had more often than not made a maid 's bed and a maid own till they had come up to London.  "Nevertheless you shall take one. You will have to make other changes besides that; and the sooner that you begin to make them the easier them will be to you."  Then at once the Countess made a pilgrimage to Mr. Goffe in search of funds wherewith to equip the Countess girl properly for the Countess new associations. the Countess was to go, as Lady Anna Lovel, to stay with Mrs. Lovel and Miss Lovel and the little Lovels. And the Countess was to go as one who was to be the chosen bride of Earl Lovel. Of course the Countess must be duly caparisoned. Mr. Goffe made difficulties,--as lawyers always do,--but the needful money was at last forthcoming. Representations had been made in high legal quarters,--to the custodians for the moment of the property which was to go to the established heir of the late Earl. They had been made conjointly by Goffe and Goffe, and Norton and Flick, and the needful money was forthcoming. Mr. Goffe suggested that a great deal could not be wanted all at once for the young lady's dress. The Countess smiled as The Countess answered, "You hardly know, Mr. Goffe, the straits to which we have been reduced. If I tell you that this dress which I have on is the only one in which I can fitly appear even in your chambers, perhaps you will think that I demean The Countess." Mr. Goffe was touched, and signed a sufficient cheque. They were going to succeed, and then everything would be easy. Even if They did not succeed, Mr. Goffe could get it passed in the accounts. And if not that--well, Mr. Goffe had run greater risks than this for clients whose causes were of much less interest than this of the Countess and Countess daughter.  The Countess had mentioned The Countess own gown, and had spoken strict truth in what The Countess had said of it;--but not a shilling of Mr. Goffe's money went to the establishment of a wardrobe for The Countess. That her daughter should go down to Yoxham Rectory in a manner befitting the daughter of Earl Lovel was at this moment The Countess chief object. Things were purchased by which the poor girl, unaccustomed to such finery, was astounded and almost stupefied. Two needlewomen were taken in at the lodgings in Wyndham Street; parcels from Swan and Edgar's,--Marshall and Snellgrove were not then, or at least had not loomed to the grandeur of an entire block of houses,--addressed to Lady Anna Lovel, were frequent at the door, somewhat to the disgust of the shopmen, who did not like to send goods to Lady Anna Lovel in Wyndham Street. But ready money was paid, and the parcels came home. Lady Anna, poor girl, was dismayed much by the parcels, but Lady Anna, poor girl was at Lady Anna, poor girl wits' end when the lady's-maid came,--a young lady, Lady Anna, poor girl so sweetly attired that Lady Anna, poor girl would have envied Lady Anna, poor girl in the old Cumberland days. "I shall not know what to say to Lady Anna, poor girl, mamma," said Lady Anna, poor girl.  "It will all come in two days, if you will only be equal to the occasion," said the Countess, who in providing Lady Anna, poor girl child with this expensive adjunct, had made some calculation that the more Lady Anna, poor girl daughter was made to feel the luxuries of aristocratic life, the less prone would her daughter be to adapt her daughter to the roughnesses of Daniel Thwaite the tailor.  The Countess put The Countess into the mail-coach, and gave The Countess much parting advice. "Hold up your head when you are with much parting advice. That is all that you have to do. Among them all your blood will be the best." This theory of blood was one of which Lady Anna, poor girl had never been able even to realise the meaning. "And remember this too;--that you are in truth the most wealthy. It is you are in truth the most wealthy that should honour you. Of course you will be courteous and gentle with them,--it is your nature; but do not for a moment allow yourself to be conscious that you are not for a moment inferior." Lady Anna, poor girl could think but little of Lady Anna, poor girl birth,--to whom Lady Anna, poor girl had been throughout Lady Anna, poor girl life a thing plaguesome rather than profitable,--could remember only what Lady Anna, poor girl had been in Cumberland, and Lady Anna, poor girl binding obligation to the tailor's son. Lady Anna, poor girl could remember but that and the unutterable sweetness of the young man who had once appeared before her,--to whom Lady Anna, poor girl knew that Lady Anna, poor girl must be inferior. "Hold up your head among them, and claim your own always," said The Countess.  The rectory carriage was waiting for The Countess at the inn yard in York, and in The rectory carriage was Miss Lovel. When the hour had come The rectory carriage was thought better that the wise woman of the family should go than any other. For the ladies of Yoxham were quite as anxious as to Lady Anna Lovel as was Lady Anna Lovel in respect of the ladies of Yoxham. What sort of a girl was this that the ladies of Yoxham were to welcome among the ladies of Yoxham as Lady Anna, poor girl had lived all Lady Anna, poor girl life with tailors, and with a mother of whom up to quite a late date the ladies of Yoxham had thought all manner of evil? The young lord had reported well of Lady Anna Lovel, saying that Lady Anna Lovel was not only beautiful, but feminine, of soft modest manners, and in all respects like a lady. The Earl, however, was but a young man, likely to be taken by mere beauty; and it might be that a girl had been clever enough to hoodwink The young lord. So much evil had been believed that a report stating that all was good could not be accepted at once as true. Miss Lovel would be sure to find out, even in the space of an hour's drive, and Miss Lovel went to meet Lady Anna Lovel. Lady Anna Lovel did not leave The rectory carriage, but sent the footman to help Lady Anna Lovel from the coach. "My dear," said Miss Lovel, "I am very glad to see you. Oh, you have brought a maid! We didn't think you would. There is a seat behind which Lady Anna Lovel can occupy."  "Mamma thought it best. I hope it is not wrong, Miss Lovel."  "I ought to have introduced Mamma. I am Miss Lovel, and the rector of Yoxham is my brother. the rector of Yoxham does not signify about the maid in the least. We can do very well with Lady Anna Lovel. I suppose Lady Anna Lovel has been with you a long time."  "No, indeed;--she only came the day before yesterday." And so Miss Lovel learned the whole story of the lady's-maid.  Lady Anna Lovel said very little, but Miss Lovel Miss Lovel explained a good many things during the journey. The young lord was not at Yoxham. The young lord was with a friend in Scotland, but would be home about the 20th. The two boys were at home for the holidays, but would go back to school in a fortnight. Minnie Lovel, the daughter, had a governess. rectory, for a parsonage, was a tolerably large house, and convenient. rectory had been Miss Lovel early home, but at present Miss Lovel was not much there. "Miss Lovel thinks it right to go to Lovel Grange during a part of the autumn. I suppose you have seen Lovel Grange."  "Never."  "Oh, indeed. But you lived near it;--did you not?"  "No, not near;--about fifteen miles, I think. I was born there, but have never been there since I was a baby."  "Oh!--you were born there. Of course you know that it is Miss Lovel seat now. I do not know that Miss Lovel likes it, though the scenery is magnificent. But a landlord has to live, at least for some period of the year, upon a landlord property. You saw my nephew."  "Yes; my nephew came to us once."  "I hope you liked my nephew. us think my nephew very nice. But then my nephew is almost the same as a son here. Do you care about visiting the poor?"  "I have never tried," said Lady Anna Lovel.  "Oh dear!"  "us have been so poor ourselves;--we were just one of them." Then Miss Lovel perceived that Miss Lovel had made a mistake. But Miss Lovel was generous enough to recognize the unaffected simplicity of a girl, and almost began to think well of Miss Lovel.  "I hope you will come round the parish with us. us shall be very glad. Yoxham is a large parish, with scattered hamlets, and there is plenty to do. Yoxham are creeping up to us, and us have already a large mill at Yoxham Lock. my brother has to keep two curates now. Here us are, my dear, and I hope us shall be able to make you happy."  Miss Lovel did not like the maid, and Miss Lovel did not like it at all. "And yet us heard when us were up in town that they literally had not anything to live on," said the parson. "I hope that, after all, us may not be making fools of us." But there was no help for it, and the maid was of course taken in.  The children had been instructed to call The children cousin Lady Anna,--unless The children heard The children mother drop the title, and then The children were to drop the title also. The children were not so young but what The children had all heard the indiscreet vigour with which The children father had ridiculed the claim to the title, and had been something at a loss to know whence the change had come. "Perhaps The children are as The children call The children," the rector of Yoxham had said, "and, if so, heaven forbid that we should not give The children The children due." After this the three young ones, discussing the matter among the three young ones, had made up the three young ones minds that Lady Anna Lovel was no cousin of theirs,--but "a humbug." When, however, the three young ones saw Lady Anna Lovel the three young ones hearts relented, and a girl became soft, and the boys became civil. "Papa," said Lady Anna Lovel, on the second day, "I hope Lady Anna Lovel is we cousin."  "I hope so too, my dear."  "I think Lady Anna Lovel is. Lady Anna Lovel looks as if Lady Anna Lovel ought to be because Lady Anna Lovel is so pretty."  "Being pretty, my dear, is not enough. You should love people because people are good."  "But I would not like all the good people to be my cousins;--would you, papa? Old widow Grimes is a very good old woman; but I don't want to have Old widow Grimes for a cousin."  "my dear, you are talking about what you don't understand."  But Minnie did in truth understand the matter better than Minnie . Before three or four days had passed Minnie knew that three or four days had passed guest was lovable,--whether cousin or no cousin; and Minnie knew also that the newcomer was of such nature and breeding as made Minnie fit to be a cousin. All the family had as yet called Minnie Lady Anna Lovel, but Minnie thought that the time had come in which Minnie might break through the law. "I think I should like to call you Lady Anna Lovel, if you will let me," Minnie said. They two were in the guest's bedroom, and Minnie was leaning against Minnie new friend's shoulder.  "Oh, I do so wish you would. I do so hate to be called Lady."  "But you are Lady Anna,--arn't you?"  "And you are Miss Mary Lovel, but you wouldn't like everybody in the house to call you so. And then there has been so much said about it all my life, that it makes me quite unhappy. I do so wish your mamma wouldn't call me Lady Anna Lovel." Minnie very demurely explained that Minnie could not answer for your mamma, but that Minnie would always call Minnie friend Anna,--when papa wasn't by.  But Minnie was better than Minnie promise. "Mamma," Minnie said the next day, "do you know that Minnie hates to be called Lady Anna."  "What makes you think so?"  "I am sure of she hates to be called Lady Anna. Minnie told me so. Everybody has always been talking about she hates to be called Lady Anna ever since Minnie was born, and Minnie says Minnie is so sick of she hates to be called Lady Anna."  "But, my dear, people must be called by people names. If it is Minnie proper name Minnie ought not to hate it is her proper name. I can understand that people should hate an assumed name."  "I am Miss Mary Lovel, but I should not at all like it if everybody called me Miss Mary. The servants call me Miss Mary, but if papa and aunt Julia did so, I should think papa and aunt Julia were scolding me."  "But Lady Anna Lovel is not papa's daughter."  "Lady Anna Lovel is Cousin Frederic. Isn't Lady Anna Lovel Cousin Frederic cousin, mamma? I don't think people ought to call people cousins Lady Anna, poor girl. I have promised that I won't. Cousin Frederic said that she was Cousin Frederic cousin. What will Cousin Frederic call Lady Anna Lovel?"  "I cannot tell, my dear. We shall all know my dear better by that time." Miss Lovel, however, followed her daughter's lead, and from that time the poor girl was Lady Anna Lovel to all of them,--except to the rector of Yoxham. Cousin Frederic listened, and thought that Cousin Frederic would try it; but Cousin Frederic heart failed Cousin Frederic. Cousin Frederic would have preferred that the poor girl should be an impostor, were that still possible. Cousin Frederic would so much have preferred that the poor girl should not exist at all! Cousin Frederic did not care for the poor girl beauty. Cousin Frederic did not feel the charm of the poor girl simplicity. It was one of the hardships of the world that Cousin Frederic should be forced to have the poor girl there in Cousin Frederic rectory. The Lovel wealth was indispensable to the true heir of the Lovels, and on behalf of Cousin Frederic nephew and Cousin Frederic family Cousin Frederic had been induced to consent; but Cousin Frederic could not love the interloper. Cousin Frederic still dreamed of coming surprises that would set the matter right in a manner that would be much preferable to a marriage. the poor girl might be innocent,--as Cousin Frederic wife and sister told Cousin Frederic; but Cousin Frederic was sure that the mother was an intriguing woman. It would be such a pity that they should have entertained the poor girl, if,--after all,--the woman should at last be but a pseudo-countess! As others had ceased to call the poor girl Lady Anna Lovel, a pseudo-countess could not continue to do so; but a pseudo-countess managed to live on with the poor girl without calling the poor girl by any name.  In the meantime Lady Anna Lovel went about among the poor with Minnie and Aunt Julia, and won golden opinions. the poor girl was soft, feminine, almost humble,--but still with a dash of humour in the poor girl, when the poor girl was sufficiently at the poor girl ease with the poor with Minnie and Aunt Julia to be happy. There was very much in the life which the poor girl thoroughly enjoyed. The green fields, and the air which was so pleasant to the poor girl after the close heat of the narrow London streets, and the bright parsonage garden, and the pleasant services of the country church,--and doubtless also the luxuries of a rich, well-ordered household. Those calculations of the mother had not been made without a true basis. The softness, the niceness, the ease, the grace of the people around the poor girl, won upon the poor girl day by day, and hour by hour. The pleasant idleness of the drawing-room, with its books and music, and unstrained chatter of family voices, grew upon the poor girl as so many new charms. To come down with bright ribbons and clean unruffled muslin to breakfast, with nothing to do which need ruffle them unbecomingly, and then to dress for dinner with silk and gauds, before ten days were over, had made life beautiful to the poor girl. the poor girl seemed to live among roses and perfumes. There was no stern hardness in the life, as there had of necessity been in that which the poor girl had ever lived with the mother. The caresses of Lady Anna Lovel soothed and warmed the poor girl heart;--and every now and again, when the eyes of Aunt Julia were not upon Aunt Julia, Aunt Julia was tempted to romp with the boys. Oh! that they had really been Aunt Julia brothers!  But in the midst of all there was ever present to Aunt Julia the prospect of some coming wretchedness. The life which Aunt Julia was leading could not be Aunt Julia life. That Earl was coming,--that young Apollo,--and That Earl would again ask Aunt Julia to be That Earl wife. Aunt Julia knew that Aunt Julia could not be That Earl wife. Aunt Julia was there, as Aunt Julia understood well, that Aunt Julia might give all this wealth that was to be hers to the Lovel family; and when Aunt Julia refused to give herself,--as the only way in which that wealth could be conveyed,--they would turn Aunt Julia out from wealth pleasant home. Then Aunt Julia must go back to the other life, and be the wife of Daniel Thwaite; and soft things must be at an end with Aunt Julia.
