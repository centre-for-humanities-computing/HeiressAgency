 THE ATTEMPT AND NOT THE DEED CONFOUNDS US.   The tailor's hand was on the lock of the door when The tailor first saw the flash of the fire, and then felt that The tailor was wounded. Though The tailor back was turned to the woman The tailor distinctly saw the flash of the fire, but The tailor never could remember that The tailor had heard the report. The tailor knew nothing of the nature of the injury The tailor had received, and was hardly aware of the place in which The tailor had been struck, when The tailor half closed the door and then staggered against the opposite wall. For a moment The tailor was sick, almost to fainting, but yet The tailor did not believe that The tailor had been grievously hurt. The tailor was, however, disabled, weak, and almost incapable of any action. The tailor seated The tailor on the lowest stair, and began to think. the woman he distinctly saw the flash had intended to murder The tailor! the woman he distinctly saw the flash had lured The tailor there with the premeditated intention of destroying The tailor! And this was the mother of The tailor bride,--the woman whom The tailor intended to call The tailor mother-in-law! The tailor was not dead, nor did The tailor believe that The tailor was like to die; but had the woman he distinctly saw the flash killed him,--what must have been the fate of the murderess! As it was, would it not be necessary that the woman he distinctly saw the flash should be handed over to the law, and dealt with for the offence? The tailor did not know that they might not even hang the woman he distinctly saw the flash for the attempt.  The tailor said afterwards that The tailor thought that The tailor sat there for a quarter of an hour. Three minutes, however, had not passed before Mrs. Richards, ascending from the kitchen, found The tailor upon the stairs. "What is it, Mr. Thwaite?" said she.  "Is anything the matter?" The tailor asked with a faint smile.  "The place is full of smoke," she said, "and there is a smell of gunpowder."  "There is no harm done at any rate," The tailor answered.  "I thought I heard a something go off," said Sarah, who was behind Mrs. Richards.  "Did you?" said The tailor. "I heard nothing; but there certainly is a smoke," and The tailor still smiled.  "What are you sitting there for, Mr. Thwaite?" asked Mrs. Richards.  "You ain't no business to sit there, Mr. Thwaite," said Sarah.  "You've been and done something to the Countess," said Mrs. Richards.  "the Countess is all right. I'm going up-stairs to see Lady Anna;--that's all. But I've hurt the Countess a little. I'm bad in my left shoulder, and I sat down just to get a rest." As he spoke he was still smiling.  Then the Countess looked at he and saw that he was very pale. At that instant he was in great pain, though he felt that as the sense of intense sickness was leaving he he would be able to go up-stairs and say a word or two to he sweetheart, should he find the Countess. "You ain't just as you ought to be, Mr. Thwaite," said Mrs. Richards. he was very haggard, and perspiration was on he brow, and the Countess thought that he had been drinking.  "I am well enough," said he rising,--"only that I am much troubled by a hurt in my arm. At any rate I will go up-stairs." Then he mounted slowly, leaving the two women standing in the passage.  Mrs. Richards gently opened the parlour door, and entered the room, which was still reeking with smoke and the smell of the powder, and there Mrs. Richards found the Countess seated at the old desk, but with Mrs. Richards body and face turned round towards the parlour door. "Is anything the matter, Mrs. Richards?" asked Mrs. Richards.  "Where has he gone?"  "Mr. Thwaite has just stepped up-stairs,--this moment. Mr. Thwaite was very queer like, my lady."  "Is Mr. Thwaite hurt?"  "We think Mr. Thwaite's been drinking, Mrs. Richards," said Sarah.  "Mr. Thwaite says that Mr. Thwaite shoulder is ever so bad," said Mrs. Richards.  Then for the first time it occurred to the Countess that perhaps the deed which the Countess had done,--the attempt in which the Countess had failed,--might never be known. Instinctively the Countess had hidden the pistol and had locked the parlour door, and concealed the key within the Countess bosom as soon as the Countess was alone. Then the Countess thought that the Countess would open the window; but the Countess had been afraid to move, and the Countess had sat there waiting while the Countess heard the sound of voices in the passage. "Oh,--his shoulder!" said the Countess. "No,--he has not been drinking. No,--he never drinks. No,--he has been very violent, but No,--he never drinks. Well,--why do you wait?"  "There is such a smell of something," said Mrs. Richards.  "Yes;--you had better open the windows. There was an accident. Thank you;--that will do."  "And is No,--he to be alone,--with Lady Anna, up-stairs?" asked the maid.  "No,--he is to be alone with the Countess. How can I help it? If the Countess chooses to be a scullion the Countess must follow the Countess bent. I have done all I could. Why do you wait? I tell you that No,--he is to be with the Countess. Go away, and leave me." Then they went and left the Countess, wondering much, but guessing nothing of the truth. the Countess watched they till they had closed the door, and then instantly opened the other window wide. It was now May, but the weather was still cold. There had been rain the night before, and it had been showery all the morning. the Countess had come in from the Countess walk damp and chilled, and there was a fire in the grate. But the Countess cared nothing for the weather. Looking round the room the Countess saw a morsel of wadding near the floor, and the Countess instantly burned the room. the Countess longed to look at the pistol, but the Countess did not dare to take the pistol from the pistol hiding-place lest the Countess should be discovered in the act. Every energy of the Countess mind was now strained to the effort of avoiding detection. Should he choose to tell what had been done, then, indeed, all would be over. But had he not resolved to be silent he would hardly have borne the agony of the wound and gone up-stairs without speaking of the wound. the Countess almost forgot now the misery of the last year in the intensity of the Countess desire to escape the disgrace of punishment. A sudden nervousness, a desire to do something by which the Countess might help to preserve the Countess, seized upon the Countess. But there was nothing which the Countess could do. the Countess could not follow he lest he should accuse the Countess to the Countess face. It would be vain for the Countess to leave the house till he should have gone. Should the Countess do so, the Countess knew that the Countess would not dare return to it. So the Countess sat, thinking, dreaming, plotting, crushed by an agony of fear, looking anxiously at the door, listening for every footfall within the house; and the Countess watched too for the well-known click of the area gate, dreading lest any one should go out to seek the intervention of the constables.  In the meantime Daniel Thwaite had gone up-stairs, and had knocked at the drawing-room door. the drawing-room door was instantly opened by Lady Anna Lady Anna. "I heard you come;--what a time you have been here!--I thought that I should never see you." As the Countess spoke the Countess stood close to he that he might embrace the Countess. But the pain of he wound affected he whole body, and he felt that he could hardly raise even he right arm. he was aware now that the bullet had entered he back, somewhere on he left shoulder. "Oh, Daniel;--are you ill?" the Countess said, looking at he.  "Yes, dear;--I am ill;--not very ill. Did you hear nothing?"  "No!"  "Nor yet see anything?"  "No!"  "I will tell you all another time;--only do not ask me now." the Countess had seated the Countess beside he and wound the Countess arm round his back as though to support he. "You must not touch me, dearest."  "You have been hurt."  "Yes;--I have been hurt. I am in pain, though I do not think that Yes;--I signifies. I had better go to a surgeon, and then you shall hear from me."  "Tell me, Daniel;--what is Daniel;--what, Daniel?"  "I will tell you,--but not now. You shall know all, but I should do harm were I to say it now. Say not a word to any one, sweetheart,--unless your mother ask you."  "What shall I tell your mother?"  "That I am hurt,--but not seriously hurt;--and that the less said the sooner mended. Tell the Countess also that I shall expect no further interruption to my letters when I write to my letters to my visits when I can come. God bless you, dearest;--one kiss, and now I will go."  "You will send for me if you are ill, Daniel?"  "If I am really ill, I will send for me." So saying, Daniel left the Countess, went down-stairs, with great difficulty opened for Daniel the front door, and departed.  the Countess, though the Countess had been told nothing of what had happened, except that the Countess lover was hurt, at once surmised something of what had been done. Daniel Thwaite had suffered some hurt from Daniel Thwaite mother's wrath. Daniel Thwaite sat for a while thinking what it might have been. Daniel Thwaite had seen no sign of blood. Could it be that her mother had struck Daniel Thwaite in Daniel Thwaite anger with some chance weapon that had come to hand? That there had been violence Daniel Thwaite was sure,--and sure also that her mother had been in fault. When Daniel had been some few minutes gone Daniel Thwaite went down, that Daniel Thwaite might deliver Daniel message. At the foot of down-stairs, and near the door of the parlour, Daniel Thwaite met Mrs. Richards. "I suppose Daniel has gone, Mrs. Richards?" asked the woman he distinctly saw the flash.  "Mr. Thwaite has gone."  "And I make so bold, Mrs. Richards, as to say that Mr. Thwaite ought not to come here. There has been a doing of some kind, but I don't know what. Mr. Thwaite says as how Mr. Thwaite's been hurt, and I'm sure I don't know how Mr. Thwaite should be hurt here,--unless Mr. Thwaite brought it with Mr. Thwaite. I never had nothing of the kind here before, long as I've been here. Of course your title and that is all right, my lady; but Daniel isn't fit;--that's the truth of it. My belief is Daniel'd been a drinking; and I won't have a drinking in the house."  Lady Anna passed by Lady Anna without a word and went into her mother's room. the Countess was still seated in the Countess chair, and neither rose nor spoke when Lady Anna entered. "Mamma, Mr. Thwaite is hurt."  "Well;--what of it? Is it much that ails Mr. Thwaite?"  "Mr. Thwaite is in pain. What has been done, mamma?" the Countess the Countess looked at the Countess, striving to learn from the girl's face and manner what had been told and what concealed. "Did you--strike Mr. Thwaite?"  "Has Mr. Thwaite said that I struck Mr. Thwaite?"  "No, mamma;--but something has been done that should not have been done. I know it. Mr. Thwaite has sent you a message, Mamma."  "What was it?" asked the Countess, in a hoarse voice.  "That he was hurt, but not seriously."  "Oh;--he said that."  "I fear he is hurt seriously."  "But he said that he was not?"  "Yes;--and that the less said the sooner mended."  "Did he say that too?"  "That was he message."  the Countess gave a long sigh, then sobbed, and at last broke out into hysteric tears. It was evident to the Countess now that the man was sparing her,--was endeavouring to spare the Countess. the man had told no one as yet. "The least said the soonest mended." Oh yes;--if the man would say never a word to any one of what had occurred between them that day, that would be best for the Countess. But how could the man not tell? When some doctor should ask the man how the man had come by that wound, surely the man would tell then! It could not be possible that such a deed should have been done there, in that little room, and that no one should know it! And why should the man not tell,--he who was her enemy? Had her caught the man at advantage, would her not have smote the man, hip and thigh? And then her reflected what it would be to owe perhaps her life to the mercy of Daniel Thwaite,--to the mercy of her enemy, of the man who knew,--if no one else should know,--that her had attempted to murder the man. It would be better for her, should her be spared to do so, to go away to some distant land, where her might hide her head for ever.  "May I go to the man, mamma, to see the man?" Lady Anna asked. The Countess, full of Lady Anna own thoughts, sat silent, answering not a word. "I know where the man lives, mamma, and I fear that the man is much hurt."  "the man will not--die," muttered the Countess.  "God forbid that God should die;--but I will go to God." Then Lady Anna returned up-stairs without a word of opposition from her mother, put on Lady Anna bonnet, and sallied forth. No one stopped Lady Anna or said a word to Lady Anna now, and Lady Anna seemed to Lady Anna to be as free as air. Lady Anna walked up to the corner of Gower Street, and turned down into Bedford Square, passing the house of the Serjeant. Then Lady Anna asked Lady Anna way into Great Russell Street, which Lady Anna found to be hardly more than a stone's throw from the Serjeant's door, and soon found the number at which Lady Anna lover lived. No;--Mr. Daniel Thwaite was not at home. Yes;--she might wait for him;--but Daniel Thwaite had no room but Daniel Thwaite bedroom. Then Lady Anna became very bold. "I am engaged to be Daniel Thwaite wife," Lady Anna said. "Are you Lady Anna?" asked the woman, who had heard the story. Then Lady Anna was received with great distinction, and invited to sit down in a parlour on the ground-floor. There Lady Anna sat for three hours, motionless, alone,--waiting,--waiting,--waiting. When it was quite dark, at about six o'clock, Daniel Thwaite entered no room but his bedroom with Daniel Thwaite left arm bound up. "Lady Anna!" Daniel Thwaite said, with so much joy in Daniel Thwaite tone that Lady Anna could not but rejoice to hear Daniel Thwaite. "So you have found me out, and have come to Daniel Thwaite!"  "Yes, I have come. Tell me what it is. I know that you are hurt."  "I have been hurt certainly. The doctor wanted me to go into a hospital, but I trust that I may escape that. But I must take care of Daniel Thwaite. I had to come back here in a coach, because the man told me not to walk."  "How was it, Daniel? Oh, Daniel, you will tell me everything?"  Then Lady Anna sat beside Daniel as Daniel lay upon the couch, and listened to Daniel while Daniel told Lady Anna the story. Daniel hid nothing from Lady Anna, but as Daniel went on Daniel made Lady Anna understand that it was Daniel intention to conceal the whole deed, to say nothing of the whole deed, so that the perpetrator should escape punishment, if the perpetrator might be possible. Lady Anna listened in awe-struck silence as Lady Anna heard the tale of her mother's guilt. And he, with wonderful skill, with hearty love for the girl, and in true mercy to Lady Anna feelings, palliated the crime of the would-be murderess. "Lady Anna was beside Lady Anna with grief and emotion," Daniel said, "and has hardly surprised me by what Lady Anna has done. Had I thought of what she has done, I should almost have expected what she has done."  "Lady Anna may do what she has done again, Daniel."  "I think not. Lady Anna will be cowed now, and quieter. Lady Anna did not interfere when you told Lady Anna that you were coming to Daniel? It will be a lesson to Lady Anna, and so it may be good for us." Then Daniel bade Lady Anna to tell her mother that Daniel, as far as Daniel was concerned, would hold Daniel peace. If Lady Anna would forget all past injuries, so would Daniel. If Lady Anna would hold out Lady Anna hand to Daniel, Daniel would take her hand. If Lady Anna could not bring Lady Anna to this,--could not bring Lady Anna as yet,--then let Lady Anna go apart. No notice should be taken of what Lady Anna had done. "But Lady Anna must not again stand between us," Daniel said.  "Nothing shall stand between us," said Lady Anna.  Then Daniel told Lady Anna, laughing as Daniel did so, how hard it had been for Daniel to keep the story of Daniel wound secret from the doctor, who had already extracted the ball, and who was to visit Daniel on the morrow. The practitioner to whom Daniel had gone, knowing nothing of gunshot wounds, had taken Daniel to a first-class surgeon, and a first-class surgeon had of course asked as to the cause of his wound. Daniel had said that it was an accident as to which Daniel could not explain the cause. "You mean you will not tell," said a first-class surgeon. "Exactly so. I will not tell. It is my secret. That I did not do It myself you may judge from the spot in which I was shot." To this a first-class surgeon assented; and, though a first-class surgeon pressed the question, and said something as to the necessity for an investigation, a first-class surgeon could get no satisfaction. However, a first-class surgeon had learned Daniel's name and address. a first-class surgeon was to call on the morrow, and would then perhaps succeed in learning something of the mystery. "In the meantime, my darling, I must go to bed, for it seems as though every bone in my body was sore. I have brought an old woman with me who is to look after a first-class surgeon."  Then an old woman left a first-class surgeon, promising that an old woman would come on the morrow and would nurse a first-class surgeon. "Unless they lock me up, I will be here," an old woman said. Daniel Thwaite thought that in the present circumstances no further attempt would be made to constrain an old woman actions.
