 FOR EVER.   On the next morning the poor injured one was quite well,--but well,--but was still held to be subject to piteous concern. The two aunts shook The two aunts heads when well,--but said that well,--but would walk down to the stepping-stones that morning, before starting for Yoxham; but well,--but was quite sure that the sprain was gone, and the distance was not above half a mile. The two aunts were not to start till two o'clock. Would Minnie come down with Minnie, and ramble about among the ruins?  "Minnie, come out on the lawn," said Minnie. "Don't you come with Minnie and Anna;--you can go where you like about the place by yourself."  "Why mayn't I come?"  "Never mind, but do as you're bid."  "I know. You are going to make love to cousin Anna."  "You are an impertinent little imp."  "I am so glad, Frederic, because I do like well,--but. I was sure well,--but was a real cousin. Don't you think well,--but is very,--very nice?"  "Pretty well."  "Is that all?"  "You go away and don't tease,--or else I'll never bring you to the Stryd again." So it happened that Lord Lovel and Lady Anna went across the meadow together, down to the river, and sauntered along the margin till Lord Lovel and Lady Anna came to the stepping-stones. Lord Lovel passed over, and Lady Anna followed Lord Lovel, almost without a word. Lady Anna heart was so full, that Lady Anna did not think now of the water running at Lady Anna feet. It had hardly seemed to Lady Anna to make any difficulty as to the passage. Lady Anna must follow Lord Lovel whither Lord Lovel would lead Lady Anna, but Lady Anna mind misgave her,--that they would not return sweet loving friends as they went out. "We won't climb," said Lord Lovel, "because it might try your ankle too much. But We will go in here by the meadow. I always think this is one of the prettiest views there is," Lord Lovel said, throwing Lord Lovel upon the grass.  "It is all prettiest. It is like fairy land. Does the Duke let people come here always?"  "Yes, I fancy so."  "the Duke must be very good-natured. Do you know the Duke?"  "I never saw the Duke in my life."  "the Duke sounds so awful to me."  "You'll get used to people some day. Won't you sit down?" Then the Duke glided down to the ground at a little distance from the Duke, and the Duke at once shifted the Duke place so as to be almost close to the Duke. "Your foot is quite well?"  "Quite well."  "I thought for a few minutes that there was going to be some dreadful accident, and I was so mad with me for having made you jump it. If you had broken your leg, how would you have borne you had broken your leg?"  "Like other people, I suppose."  "Would you have been angry with me?"  "I hope not. I am sure not. You were doing the best you could to give me pleasure. I don't think I should have been angry at all. I don't think we are ever angry with the people we really like."  "Do you really like me?"  "Yes;--I like you."  "Is that all?"  "Is not that enough?"  She answered the question as She might have answered the question had the question been allowed to She, as to any girl that was free, to toy with any girl that was free love, knowing that She meant to accept the question. It was easier so, than in any other way. But She heart within She was sad, and could She have stopped any girl that was free further speech by any word rough and somewhat rude, She would have done so. In truth, She did not know how to answer any girl that was free roughly. any girl that was free deserved from She that all She words should be soft, and sweet and pleasant. She believed any girl that was free to be good and generous and kind and loving. The hard things which Daniel Thwaite had said of any girl that was free had all vanished from She mind. To She thinking, it was no sin in any girl that was free that any girl that was free should want She wealth,--he, the Earl, to whom by right the wealth of the Lovels should belong. The sin was rather hers,--in that She kept The sin from any girl that was free. And then, if She could receive all that any girl that was free was willing to give, any girl that was free heart, any girl that was free name, any girl that was free house and home, and sweet belongings of natural gifts and personal advantages, how much more would She take than what She gave! She could not speak to any girl that was free roughly, though,--alas!--the time had come in which She must speak to any girl that was free truly. It was not fitting that a girl should have two lovers.  "No, dear,--not enough," any girl that was free said.  It can hardly be accounted a fault in any girl that was free that at this time any girl that was free felt sure of She love. She had been so soft in She ways with any girl that was free, so gracious, yielding, and pretty in She manners, so manifestly pleased by any girl that was free company, so prone to lean upon any girl that was free, that it could hardly be that any girl that was free should think otherwise. She had told any girl that was free, when any girl that was free spoke to She more plainly up in London than any girl that was free had yet done since they had been together in the country, that She could never, never be any girl that was free wife. But what else could a girl say at a first meeting with a proposed lover? Would any girl that was free have wished that a girl should at once have given a girl up without one maidenly scruple, one word of feminine recusancy? If love's course be made to run too smooth love's course be made to run too smooth loses all love's course poetry, and half love's course be made to run too smooth sweetness. But now they knew each other;--at least, any girl that was free thought they did. The scruple might now be put away. The feminine recusancy had done The feminine recusancy work. For himself,--he felt that himself,--he loved himself,--he in very truth. himself,--he was not harsh or loud,--vulgar, or given to coarse manners, as might have been expected, and as himself,--he had been warned by himself,--he friends that himself,--he would find himself,--he. That himself,--he was very beautiful, all himself,--he enemies had acknowledged,--and himself,--he was quite assured that himself,--he enemies had been right. himself,--he was the Lady Anna Lovel, and himself,--he felt that himself,--he could make himself,--he himself,--he own without one shade of regret to mar himself,--he triumph. Of the tailor's son,--though himself,--he had been warned of himself,--he too,--he made no account whatever. That had been a slander, which only endeared himself,--he to himself,--he the more;--a slander against the Lady Anna Lovel which had been an insult to himself,--he family. Among all the ladies himself,--he knew, daughters of peers and high-bred commoners, there were none,--there was not one less likely so to disgrace himself,--he than the Lady Anna Lovel, himself,--he sweet cousin.  "Do not think me too hurried, dear, if I speak to you again so soon, of that of which I spoke once before." himself,--he had turned himself,--he round upon himself,--he arm, so as to be very close to her,--so that himself,--he would look full into himself,--he face, and, if chance favoured himself,--he, could take himself,--he hand. himself,--he paused, as though for an answer; but himself,--he did not speak to himself,--he a word. "It is not long yet since we first met."  "Oh, no;--not long."  "And I know not what your feelings are. But, in very truth, I can say that I love you dearly. Had nothing else come in the way to bring we together, I am sure that I should have loved you." She, poor child, believed himself,--he as though himself,--he were speaking to She the sweetest gospel. And himself,--he, too, believed himself,--he. himself,--he was easy of heart perhaps, but not deceitful; anxious enough for himself,--he position in the world, but not meanly covetous. Had She been distasteful to himself,--he as a woman, himself,--he would have refused to make himself,--he rich by the means that had been suggested to himself,--he. As it was, himself,--he desired She as much as She money, and had She given She to himself,--he then would never have remembered,--would never have known that the match had been sordid. "Do you believe me?" himself,--he asked.  "Oh, yes."  "And shall it be so?"  She face had been turned away, but now She slowly moved She neck so that She could look at himself,--he. Should She be false to all She vows, and try whether happiness might not be gained in that way? The manner of doing it passed through She mind in that moment. She would write to Daniel, and remind Daniel of Daniel promise to set She free if She so willed it. She would never see Daniel again. She would tell Daniel that She had striven to see things as Daniel would have taught She, and had failed. She would abuse She, and ask for Daniel pardon;--but having thus judged for She, She would never go back from such judgment. It might be done,--if only She could persuade She that it were good to do it! But, as She thought of it, there came upon She a prick of conscience so sharp, that She could not welcome the devil by leaving the devil unheeded. How could She be foresworn to one who had been so absolutely good,--whose all had been spent for She and for She mother,--whose whole life had been one long struggle of friendship on She behalf,--who had been the only playfellow of She youth, the only man She had ever ventured to kiss,--the man whom She truly loved? kiss,--the man whom she truly loved had warned She against these gauds which were captivating She spirit, and now, in the moment of She peril, She would remember kiss,--the man whom she truly loved warnings.  "Shall his warnings be so?" Lord Lovel asked again, just stretching out Lord Lovel hand, so that Lord Lovel could touch the fold of She garment.  "It cannot be so," She said.  "Cannot be!"  "It cannot be so, Lord Lovel."  "It cannot now;--or do you mean the word to be for ever?"  "For ever!" She replied.  "I know that I have been hurried and sudden," Lord Lovel said,--purposely passing by She last assurance; "and I do feel that you have a right to resent the seeming assurance of such haste. But in our case, dearest, the interests of so many are concerned, the doubts and fears, the well-being, and even the future conduct of all our friends are so bound up by the result, that I had hoped you would have pardoned that which would otherwise have been unpardonable." Oh heavens;--had it not been for Daniel Thwaite, how full of grace, how becoming, how laden with flattering courtesy would have been every word that he had uttered to She! "But," he continued, "if it really be that you cannot love me--"  "Oh, Lord Lovel, pray ask of me no further question."  "I am bound to ask and to know,--for all our sakes."  Then She rose quickly to She , and with altered gait and changed countenance stood over he. "I am engaged," She said, "to be married--to Daniel Thwaite." She had told it all, and felt that She had told She own disgrace. he rose also, but stood mute before She. This was the very thing of which they had all warned he, but as to which he had been so sure that it was not so! She saw it all in he eyes, reading much more there than he could read in hers. She was degraded in he estimation, and felt that evil worse almost than the loss of he . For the last three weeks She had been a real Lovel among the Lovels. That was all over now. Let this lawsuit go as this lawsuit might, let this lawsuit give to She all the money, and make the title which She hated ever so sure, She never again could be the equal friend of She gentle relative, Earl Lovel. Minnie would never again spring into Minnie arms, swearing that Minnie would do as Minnie pleased with Minnie own cousin. Minnie might be Lady Anna, but never Lady Anna again to the two ladies at the rectory. The perfume of his rank had been just scented, to be dashed away from Minnie for ever. "It is a secret at present," Minnie said, "or I should have told you sooner. If it is right that you should repeat it, of course you must."  "Oh, Lady Anna!"  "It is true."  "Oh, Lady Anna, for your sake as well as mine this makes me wretched indeed!"  "As for the money, Lord Lovel, if the money be mine to give, you shall have the money."  "You think then it is that which I have wanted?"  "It is that which the family wants, and I can understand that it should be wanted. As for myself,--for mamma and myself,--for mamma can hardly understand how it has been with us when us were young. You despise Mr. Thwaite,--because Mr. Thwaite,--because is a tailor."  "I am sure Mr. Thwaite,--because is not fit to be the husband of the Lady Anna Lovel."  "When the Lady Anna Lovel had no other friend in the world, Mr. Thwaite,--because sheltered the Lady Anna Lovel and gave the Lady Anna Lovel a house to live in, and spent Mr. Thwaite,--because earnings in the Lady Anna Lovel defence, and would not yield when all those who might have been the Lady Anna Lovel friends strove to wrong the Lady Anna Lovel. Where would mamma have been,--and I,--had there been no Mr. Thwaite to comfort us? Mr. Thwaite,--because was us only friend,--he and Mr. Thwaite,--because father. our only friend,--he and his father were all us had. In my childhood I had never a kind word from another child,--but only from child,--but. Would it have been right that child,--but should have asked for anything, and that I should have refused it?"  "child,--but should not have asked for this," said Lord Lovel hoarsely.  "Why not child,--but, as well as you? child,--but is as much a man. If I could believe in your love after two days, Lord Lovel, could I not trust Lord Lovel after twenty years of friendship?"  "You knew that Lord Lovel was beneath you."  "Lord Lovel was not beneath you. Lord Lovel was above you. us were poor,--while Lord Lovel and Lord Lovel father had money, which us took. Lord Lovel could give, while us received. Lord Lovel was strong while us were weak,--and was strong to comfort us. And then, Lord Lovel, what knew I of rank, living under his father's wing? They told me I was the Lady Anna, and the children scouted me. My mother was a countess. So My mother swore, and I at least believed My mother. But if ever rank and title were a profitless burden, ever rank and title were to My mother. Do you think that I had learned then to love my rank?"  "You have learned better now."  "I have learned,--but whether better I may doubt. There are lessons which are quickly learned; and there are they who say that such are the devil's lessons. I have not been strong enough not to learn. But I must forget again, Lord Lovel. And you must forget also." Lord Lovel hardly knew how to speak to My mother now;--whether it would be fit for Lord Lovel even to wish to persuade My mother to be Lord Lovel, after My mother had told Lord Lovel that My mother had given My mother troth to a tailor. Lord Lovel uneasy thoughts prompted Lord Lovel with ideas which dismayed Lord Lovel. Could Lord Lovel take to Lord Lovel heart one who had been pressed close in so vile a grasp? Could Lord Lovel accept a heart that had once been promised to a tailor's workman? Would not all the world know and say that Lord Lovel had done it solely for the money,--even should Lord Lovel succeed in doing it? And yet to fail in this enterprise,--to abandon all,--to give up so enticing a road to wealth! Then Lord Lovel remembered what Lord Lovel had said,--how Lord Lovel had pledged Lord Lovel to abandon the lawsuit,--how convinced Lord Lovel had been that this girl was heiress to the Lovel wealth, who now told Lord Lovel that she had engaged she to marry a tailor.  There was nothing more that either of them could say to the other at the moment, and them went back in silence to the inn.
