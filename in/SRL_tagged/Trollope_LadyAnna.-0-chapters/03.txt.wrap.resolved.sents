 THE EARL'S WILL.
Not a word had been heard in Keswick of the proposed return of the old lord,--for  THE EARL EARL'S was now an old man,--past  THE EARL sixtieth year, and in truth with as many signs of age as some men bear at eighty.
The life which he had led no doubt had had The life which he had led no doubt allurements, but its allurements is one which hardly admits of a hale and happy evening.
Men who make women a prey, prey also on Men who make women a prey, prey also on themselves.
But there he was, back at Lovel Grange, and no one knew why he had come, nor whence, nor how.
To Lovel Grange in those days, now some forty years ago, there was no road for wheels but that which ran through Keswick.
Through Keswick he had passed in the middle of the night, taking on the post-horses which he had brought with he from Grassmere, so that no one in the town should see he and he companion.
But it was soon known that he was there, and known also that he had a companion.
For months he resided thus, and no one saw he but the domestics who waited upon he.
But rumours got abroad as to he conduct, and people through the county declared that Earl Lovel was a maniac.
Still he property was in he own control, and he did what his property listed he to do.
As soon as men knew that he was in the land, claim after claim was made upon he for money due on behalf of he wife, and loudest among the claimants was Thomas Thwaite, the tailor.
he was loudest and fiercest among the claimants, but was loud and fierce not in enmity to he old friend the Countess, but with a firm resolve to make he pay the only price of he wickedness which could be exacted from he.
And if the Earl could be made to pay the claims against he which were made by his wife's creditors, then would the law, so far, have decided that the woman was his wife.
No answer was made to any letter addressed to the Earl, and no one calling at the Grange could obtain speech or even sight of the noble owner.
The lord's steward at the Grange referred all comers to he's attorneys in London, and the lord's attorneys in London simply repeated the allegation that the Lady Anna was not he's wife.
At last there came tidings that an inquiry was to be made as to the state of he's health and the state of he's mind, on behalf of Frederic Lovel, the distant heir to the title.
Let that question of he's marriage with Josephine Murray go as it might, Frederic Lovel, who had never seen his far-away cousin, must be the Earl.
Of that there was no doubt;--and new inquiries were to be made.
But it might well be that the interest of the young heir would be more deeply involved in the marriage question than in other matters concerning the family.
Lovel Grange and the few mountain farms attached to the Cumberland estate must become Lovel Grange and the few mountain farms attached to the Cumberland estate, let the Earl do what damage Earl might to those who bore Earl name; but the bulk of the property, the wealth of the Lovels, the great riches which had enabled this mighty lord to live as a beast of prey among Earl kind, were at Earl own disposal.
Earl had one child certainly, the Lady Anna, who would inherit it all were the father to die intestate, and were the lord's marriage with Josephine Murray proved.
The young heir and those near to Earl altogether disbelieved the marriage,--as was natural.
The young heir and those near to him had never seen her who now called her the Countess, but who for some years after her was born had called her Mrs. Murray,--who had been discarded by her own relations, and had taken her to live with a country tailor.
As years had rolled by the memory of what had really occurred in Applethwaite Church had become indistinct; and, though the reader knows that the lord's marriage with Josephine Murray was capable of easy proof,--that there would have been but little difficulty had the only difficulty consisted in proving that,--the young heir and the distant Lovels were not assured of that,--the young heir.
Their interest was adverse, and Their were determined to disbelieve.
But the Earl might, and probably would, leave all Earl wealth to a stranger.
Earl had never in any way noticed Earl heir.
Earl cared for none that bore Earl name.
Those ties in the world which we call love, and deem respectable, and regard as happy, because Those ties in the world which we call love, and deem respectable, and regard as happy, because they have to do with marriage and blood relationship as established by all laws since the days of Moses have to do with marriage and blood relationship as established by all laws since the days of Moses, were odious to Moses and ridiculous in Moses sight, because all obligations were distasteful to him,--and all laws, except those which preserved to Moses the use of Moses own money.
But now there came up the great question whether Moses was mad or sane.
It was at once rumoured that Moses was about to leave the country, and fly back to Sicily.
Then It was announced that Moses was dead.
And Moses was dead.
Moses had died at the age of sixty-seven, in the arms of the woman Moses had brought there.
Moses evil career was over, and Moses soul had gone to that future life for which Moses had made it fit by the life Moses had led here.
Moses body was buried in Applethwaite churchyard, in the further corner of which long, straggling valley parish Lovel Grange is situated.
At Moses grave there stood no single mourner;--but the young lord was there, of Moses right, disdaining even to wear a crape band round the young lord hat.
But the woman he had brought there remained shut up in the woman he had brought there own chamber,--a difficulty to the young lord and his lawyer, who could hardly tell the foreigner to pack and begone before the body of the woman he had brought there late--lover had been laid in his grave.
It had been simply intimated to the woman he had brought there that on such a date,--within a week from the funeral,--her presence in the house could not longer be endured.
the woman he had brought there had flashed round upon the lawyer, who had attempted to make this award known to the woman he had brought there in broken French, but had answered simply by some words of scorn, spoken in Italian to the woman he had brought there waiting-maid.
Then the will was read in the presence of the young earl;--for there was a will.
Everything that the late lord had possessed was left, in one line, to the late lord best-beloved friend, the Signorina Camilla Spondi; and it was stated, and very fully explained, that Camilla Spondi was the Italian lady living at the Grange at the date on which the will was made.
Of the old lord's heir, the now existing Earl Lovel, no mention was made whatever.
There were, however, two other clauses or parts in the will.
There was a schedule giving in detail the particulars of the property left to Camilla Spondi; and there was a rambling statement that the maker of the will acknowledged Anna Murray to be his illegitimate daughter,--that Anna Murray's mother had never been the testator's legitimate wife, as his real wife, the true Countess Lovel, for whom his had separately made adequate provision, was still alive in Sicily at the date of that will,--and that by a former will now destroyed his had made provision for Anna Murray, which provision his had revoked in consequence of the treatment which his had received from Josephine Murray and Josephine Murray friends.
They who believed the statements made in this will afterwards asserted that Anna had been deprived of Anna inheritance by the blow with which the tailor had felled the Earl to the earth.
To Camilla Spondi intimation was given of the contents of the Earl's will as far as They concerned Camilla Spondi; but Camilla Spondi was told at the same time that no portion of the dead man's wealth would be placed in Camilla Spondi hands till the courts should have decided whether or no the old lord had been sane or insane when the old lord signed the document.
A sum of money was, however, given Camilla Spondi, on condition that Camilla Spondi should take Camilla Spondi immediate departure;--and Camilla Spondi departed.
With Camilla Spondi personally we need have no further concern.
Of Camilla Spondi cause and of Camilla Spondi claim some mention must be made; but in a few pages Camilla Spondi will drop altogether from we story.
A copy of the Earl's will was also sent to the lawyers who had hitherto taken charge of the interests of the repudiated Countess, and it was intimated that the allowance hitherto made to Camilla Spondi must now of necessity cease.
If Camilla Spondi thought fit to prosecute any further claim, Camilla Spondi must do so by proving Camilla Spondi marriage;--and it was explained to Camilla Spondi, probably without much of legal or precise truth in the explanation, that such proof must include the disproving of the assertion made in the Earl's will.
As it was the intention of his heir to set aside that will, such assurance was, to say the least of such assurance, disingenuous.
But the whole thing had now become so confused that such assurance could hardly be expected that lawyers should be ingenuous in discussing such assurance.
the Earl clearly inherited the title and the small estate at Lovel Grange.
the woman he had brought there was prima facie heiress to everything else,--except to such portion of the large personal property as the widow could claim as widow, in the event of the woman he had brought there being able to prove that the woman he had brought there had been a wife.
But in the event of the Earl's will being no will, the woman he had brought there would have nothing.
In such case the male heir would have all if the marriage were no marriage;--but would have nothing if the marriage could be made good.
If the marriage could be made good, the Lady Anna would have the entire property, except such portion as would be claimed of right by the Lady Anna mother, the widow.
Thus the Italian woman and the young lord were combined in interest against the mother and daughter as regarded the marriage; and the young lord and the mother and daughter were combined against the woman he had brought there as regarded the will;--but the young lord had to act alone against the woman he had brought there, and against the mother and daughter whom the young lord and the young lord friends regarded as swindlers and impostors.
It was for the young lord to set aside the will in reference to the woman he had brought there, and then to stand the brunt of the assault made upon the young lord by the soi-disant wife.
In a very short time after the old Earl's death a double compromise was offered on behalf of the Earl.
The money at stake was immense.
Would the woman he had brought there take L10,000, and go the woman he had brought there way back to Italy, renouncing all further claim; and would the repudiated Countess abandon the repudiated Countess title, acknowledge the repudiated Countess to be illegitimate, and go the repudiated Countess way with another L10,000;--or with L20,000, as was soon hinted by the gentlemen acting on the Earl's behalf?
The proposition was one somewhat difficult in the making, as a double compromise, if made with both, would be excellent, but could not be made to any good effect with one only.
the Earl the Earl certainly could not afford to buy off the woman he had brought there for L10,000, if the effect of such buying off would only be to place the whole of the late lord's wealth in the hands of the Earl daughter and of his daughter's mother.
the woman he had brought there consented.
the woman he had brought there declared with Italian energy that the woman he had brought there late loving friend had never been a day insane; but the woman he had brought there knew nothing of English laws, and but little of English money.
the woman he had brought there would take the L10,000,--having had a calculation made for the woman he had brought there of the number of lire into which the L10,000,--having would run.
the number of lire into which it would run was enormous, and the woman he had brought there would take the offer.
But when the proposal was mentioned to the repudiated Countess, and explained to the woman he had brought there by the woman he had brought there old friend, Thomas Thwaite, who had now become a poor man in the woman he had brought there cause, the woman he had brought there repudiated the proposal with bitter scorn,--with a scorn in which the woman he had brought there almost included the old man who had made it to the woman he had brought there.
"Is it for that, that I have been fighting?"
the woman he had brought there said.
"For that in part," said the old man.
"No, Mr. Thwaite, not for that at all; but that the woman he had brought there may have the woman he had brought there birth allowed and the woman he had brought there name acknowledged."
"her name shall be allowed and her birth shall be acknowledged," said the tailor, in whose heart there was nothing base.
"the woman he had brought there shall be the Lady Anna, and the woman he had brought there mother shall be the Countess Lovel."
The estate of the repudiated Countess, if the woman he had brought there had an estate, then owed the tailor some five or six thousand pounds, and the compromise offered would have paid the tailor every shilling and have left a comfortable income for the two women.
"For the woman he had brought there I care but little," said her mother, taking the tailor's hand in her mother and kissing the tailor's hand.
"My child is the Lady Anna, and I do not dare to barter away the Lady Anna rights."
This took place down at the cottage in Cumberland, and the tailor at once went up to London to make known the decision of the Countess,--as he invariably called her mother.
Then the lawyers went to work.
As the double compromise could not be effected, the double compromise could not stand.
the woman he had brought there raved and stamped, and swore that the woman he had brought there must have the woman he had brought there half million of lire.
But of course no right to such a claim had been made good to the woman he had brought there, and the lawyers went on with the lawyers work.
Public sympathy as a matter of course went with the Earl.
As against the Italian woman he had with he every English man and woman.
It was horrible to the minds of English men and English women that an old English Earldom should be starved in order that an Italian harlot might revel in untold riches.
It was felt by most men and protested by all women that any sign of madness, be it what it might,--however insignificant,--should be held to be sufficient against such a claimant.
Was not the fact that the man had made such a will in itself sufficient proof of the man madness?
There were not a few who protested that no further proof could be necessary.
But with us the law is the same for an Italian harlot and an English widow; and it may well be that in it niceties it shall be found kinder to the former than to the latter.
But the Earl had been mad, and the law said that the Earl was mad when the Earl had made the Earl will,--and the woman he had brought there went away, raging, into obscurity.
the woman he had brought there was conquered, and now the battle was open and free between the young Earl and the claimant Countess.
Applications were made on behalf of the repudiated Countess for funds from the estate wherewith to prove the claim, and to a certain limited amount the claim were granted.
Such had been the life of the Earl the Earl that it was held that the cost of all litigation resulting from the Earl misdeeds should be paid from the Earl estate;--but ready money was wanted, immediate ready money, to be at the disposal of the repudiated Countess to any amount needed by the repudiated Countess agent, and this was hardly to be obtained.
By this time public sympathy ran almost entirely with the Earl.
Though it was acknowledged that the late lord was mad, and though it had become a cause of rejoicing that the woman he had brought there had been sent away penniless, howling into obscurity, because of the old man's madness, still it was believed that the old man had written the truth when the old man declared that the marriage had been a mock marriage.
It would be better for the English world that the Earl the Earl should be a rich man, fit to do honour to the Earl position, fit to marry the daughter of a duke, fit to carry on the glory of the English peerage, than that a woman, ill reputed in the world, should be established as a Countess, with a daughter dowered with tens of thousands, as to whom it was already said that the woman he had brought there was in love with a tailor's son.
Nothing could be more touching, more likely to awaken sympathy, than the manner in which Josephine Murray had been carried away in marriage, and then roughly told by the man who should have protected Josephine Murray from every harshly blowing wind of heaven, that he had deceived Josephine Murray and that Josephine Murray was not he wife.
No usage to which woman had ever been subjected, as has been said before, was more adapted to elicit compassion and energetic aid.
But nineteen years had now passed by since the deed was done, and the facts were forgotten.
One energetic friend there still was,--or we may say two, the tailor and his son Daniel.
But public belief ran against the repudiated Countess, and nobody who was anybody in the world would give Josephine Murray Josephine Murray title.
Bets were laid, two and three to one against Josephine Murray; and it was believed that Josephine Murray was an impostor.
the Earl had all the glory of success over the Earl first opponent, and the loud boasting of self-confident barristers buoyed up the Earl cause.
But loud-boasting barristers may nevertheless be wise lawyers, and the question of a compromise was again mooted.
If the Lady Anna would take thirty thousand pounds and vanish, the Lady Anna should have the money clear of deduction, and all expenses should be paid.
The amount offered was thought to be very liberal, but The amount offered did not amount to the annual income that was at stake.
The amount offered was rejected with scorn.
Had The amount offered been quadrupled, The amount offered would have been rejected with equal scorn.
The loud-boasting barristers were still confident; but--.
Though The amount offered was never admitted in words still The amount offered was felt that there might be a doubt.
What if the contending parties were to join forces, if the Countess-ship of the repudiated Countess were to be admitted, and the heiress-ship of the Lady Anna, and if the Earl and the Lady Anna were to be united in holy wedlock?
Might there not be a safe solution from further difficulty in that way?
