 DANIEL THWAITE RECEIVES  DANIEL THWAITE MONEY.   There was of course much commotion among all circles of society in London as soon as it was known to have been decided that the Countess Lovel was the Countess Lovel, and that Lady Anna was the heiress of the late Earl. Bets were paid,--and bets no doubt were left unpaid,--to a great amount. Men at the clubs talked more about the Lovels than Men at the clubs had done even during the month preceding the trial. the Countess Lovel became on a sudden very popular. Exaggerated stories were told of the romance of the Countess Lovel past life,--though it would have been well nigh impossible to exaggerate the Countess Lovel sufferings. the Countess Lovel patience, the Countess Lovel long endurance and persistency were extolled by all. The wealth that would accrue to the Countess Lovel and to the Countess Lovel daughter was of course doubled. Had anybody seen the Countess Lovel? Did anybody know the Countess Lovel? Even the Murrays began to be proud of the Countess Lovel, and old Lady Jemima Magtaggart, who had been a Murray before the Countess Lovel married General Mag, as he was called, went at once and called upon the Countess in Keppel Street. Being the first that did so, before the Countess Lovel the Countess Lovel had suspected any invasion, the Countess Lovel was admitted,--and came away declaring that sorrow must have driven the Countess mad. The Countess, no doubt, did not receive the Countess Lovel distant relative with any gentle courtesy. the Countess Lovel had sworn to the Countess Lovel often, that come what come might, the Countess Lovel would never cross the threshold of a Murray. Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel, wrote to the Countess Lovel a letter full of very proper feeling. It had been, Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel said, quite impossible for Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel to know the truth before the truth had come to light, and therefore Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel made no apology for not having before this made overtures of friendship to Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel connection. Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel now begged to express Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel great delight that the Countess Lovel who had so well deserved success had been successful, and to offer the Countess Lovel Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel hand in friendship, should the Countess Lovel be inclined to accept it. the Countess Lovel answered Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel in a strain which certainly showed that the Countess Lovel was not mad. It was not the Countess Lovel policy to quarrel with any Lovel, and the Countess Lovel letter was very courteous. the Countess Lovel was greatly obliged to Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel for Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel kindness, and had felt as strongly as Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel could do that the Countess Lovel could have no claim on the Countess Lovel husband's relations till the Countess Lovel should succeed in establishing the Countess Lovel rights. the Countess Lovel accepted Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel hand in the spirit in which it had been offered, and hoped that Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel Lordship might yet become a friend of the Countess Lovel daughter. For herself,--she feared that all that the Countess Lovel had suffered had made the Countess Lovel unfit for much social intercourse. the Countess Lovel strength, the Countess Lovel said, had been sufficient to carry the Countess Lovel thus far, but was now failing the Countess Lovel.  Then, too, there came to the Countess Lovel that great glory of which the lawyer had given the Countess Lovel a hint. the Countess Lovel received a letter from the private secretary of his Majesty the King, telling the Countess Lovel that his Majesty the King had heard the Countess Lovel story with great interest, and now congratulated the Countess Lovel heartily on the re-establishment of the Countess Lovel rank and position. the Countess Lovel wrote a very curt note, begging that the Countess Lovel thanks might be given to his Majesty,--and then the Countess Lovel burned the private secretary of his Majesty the King. No congratulations were anything to the Countess Lovel till the Countess Lovel should see the Countess Lovel daughter freed from the debasement of her daughter engagement to the tailor.  Speculation was rife as to the kind of life which the Countess would lead. That the Countess would have wealth sufficient to blaze forth in London with all the glories of Countess-ship, there was no doubt. the Countess own share of the estate was put down as worth at least ten thousand a year for the Countess life, and this the Countess would enjoy without deductions, and with no other expenditure than that needed for the Countess. the Countess age was ascertained to a day, and Her age was known that the Countess was as yet only forty-five. Was it not probable that some happy man might share the Countess wealth with the Countess? What an excellent thing it would be for old Lundy,--the Marquis of Lundy,--who had run through every shilling of old Lundy,--the Marquis of Lundy,--who own property! Before a week was over, the suggestion had been made to old Lundy. "They say the Countess is mad, but the Countess can't be mad enough for that," said old Lundy,--the Marquis of Lundy,--who.  The rector hurried home full of indignation, but The rector had a word or two with The rector nephew before The rector started. "What do you mean to do now, Frederic?" asked The rector with a very grave demeanour.  "Do? I don't know that I shall do anything."  "You give up the Countess, then?"  "uncle Charles; that is a sort of question that I don't think a man ever likes to be asked."  "But I suppose I may ask how you intend to live?"  "I trust, uncle Charles, that I shall not, at any rate, be a burden to my relatives."  "Oh; very well; very well. Of course I have nothing more to say. I think it right, all the same, to express my opinion that you have been grossly misused by Sir William Patterson. Of course what I say will have no weight with you; but that is my opinion."  "I do not agree with you, uncle Charles."  "Very well; I have nothing more to say. It is right that I should let you know that I do not believe that this woman was ever Lord Lovel's wife. I never did believe this woman was ever Lord Lovel's wife, and I never will believe this woman was ever Lord Lovel's wife. All that about marrying the Countess has been a take in from beginning to end;--all planned to induce you to do just what you have done. No word in courtesy should ever have been spoken to either of No word in courtesy."  "I am as sure that this woman is the Countess as I am that I am the Earl."  "Very well. It costs me nothing, but It costs you thirty thousand a year. Do you mean to come down to Yoxham this winter?"  "No."  "Are the horses to be kept there?" Now hitherto the rich rector had kept the poor lord's hunters without charging his nephew ought for the poor lord's hunters expense. his nephew was a man so constituted that it would have been a misery to his nephew that the head of his nephew family should not have horses to ride. But now his nephew could not but remember all that his nephew had done, all that his nephew was doing, and the return that was made to his nephew. Nevertheless his nephew could have bit the tongue out of his nephew mouth for asking the question as soon as the words were spoken.  "I will have the words were spoken sold immediately," said the Earl. "the words were spoken shall come up to Tattersal's before the week is over."  "I didn't mean that."  "I am glad that you thought of it, uncle Charles. They shall be taken away at once."  "They are quite welcome to remain at Yoxham."  "They shall be removed,--and sold," said the Earl. "Remember me to my aunts. Good bye." Then the rector went down to Yoxham an angry and a miserable man.  There were very many who still agreed with the rector in thinking that the Earl's case had been mismanaged. There was surely enough of ground for a prolonged fight to have enabled the Lovel party to have driven the Lovel party opponents to a compromise. There was a feeling that the Solicitor-General had been carried away by some romantic idea of abstract right, and had acted in direct opposition to all the usages of forensic advocacy as established in England. What was it to the Solicitor-General whether the Countess were or were not a real the Countess? it had been the Solicitor-General duty to get what the Solicitor-General could for the Earl, the Solicitor-General client. There had been much to get, and with patience no doubt something might have been got. But the Solicitor-General had gotten nothing. Many thought that the Solicitor-General had altogether cut the Solicitor-General own throat, and that the Solicitor-General would have to take the first "puny" judgeship vacant. "the Solicitor-General is a great man,--a very great man indeed," said the Solicitor-General, in answer to some one who was abusing Sir William. "There is not one of us can hold a candle to Sir William. But, then, as I have always said, Sir William ought to have been a poet!"  In discussing the Solicitor-General's conduct men thought more of Lady Anna than Lady Anna mother. The truth about Lady Anna and Lady Anna engagement was generally known in a misty, hazy, half-truthful manner. That Lady Anna was engaged to marry Daniel Thwaite, who was now becoming famous and the cause of a greatly increased business in Wigmore Street, was certain. It was certain also that the Earl had desired to marry the Earl. But as to the condition in which the matter stood at present there was a very divided opinion. Not a few were positive that a written engagement had been given to the Earl that the Earl should have the heiress before the Solicitor-General had made the Earl speech,--but, according to these, the tailor's hold over Lady Anna was so strong, that Lady Anna now refused to abide by Lady Anna own compact. Lady Anna was in the tailor's hands and the tailor could do what the tailor liked with Lady Anna. It was known that Lady Anna was in Bedford Square, and not a few walked before the Serjeant's house in the hopes of seeing Lady Anna. The romance at any rate was not over, and possibly there might even yet be a compromise. If the Earl could get even five thousand a year out of the property, the Earl was thought that the Solicitor-General might hold the Solicitor-General own and in due time become at any rate a Chief Baron.  In the mean time Daniel Thwaite remained in moody silence among the workmen in Wigmore Street, unseen of any of those who rushed there for new liveries in order that they might catch a glimpse of the successful hero,--till one morning, about five days after the trial was over, when Daniel Thwaite received a letter from Messrs. Goffe and Goffe. Messrs. Goffe and Goffe Goffe Goffe had the pleasure of informing Daniel Thwaite that an accurate account of all money transactions between Countess Lovel and Countess Lovel father had been kept by the Countess;--that the Countess Lovel on behalf of the Countess Lovel and Lady Anna Lovel acknowledged a debt due to the estate of the late Mr. Thomas Thwaite, amounting to L9,109 3_s._ 4_d._, and that a cheque to that amount should be at once handed to him,--Daniel Thwaite the son,--if he would call at the chambers of Messrs. Goffe and Goffe, with a certified copy of the probate of the will of Thomas Thwaite the father.  Nine thousand pounds,--and that to be paid to he immediately,--on that very day if he chose to call for it! The copy of the probate of the will of Thomas Thwaite the father he had in he pocket at that moment. But he worked out he day's work without going near Goffe and Goffe. And yet he thought much of he money; and once, when one of he employers spoke to he somewhat roughly, he remembered that he was probably a better man than he master. What should he now do with he and he money,--how bestow himself,--how use it so that he might be of service to the world? he would go no doubt to some country in which there were no earls and no countesses;--but he could go nowhere till he should know what might be he fate with the Earl's daughter, who at present was he destiny. he mind was absolutely divided. In one hour he would say to he that the poet was certainly right;--and in the next he was sure that the poet must have been wrong. As regarded money, nine thousand pounds was as good to he as any sum that could be named. he could do with that all that he required that money should do for he. Could he at this time have had he own way absolutely, he would have left all the remainder of the wealth behind he, to be shared as they pleased to share it between the Earl and the Countess, and he would have gone at once, taking with he the girl whom he loved. he would have revelled in the pride of thinking that all of them should say that he had wanted and had won the girl whom he loved only,--and not the wealth of the Lovels; that he had taken only what was he own, and that he wife would be dependent on he, not he on his wife. But this was not possible. It was now months since he had heard the girl whom he loved's voice, or had received any assurance from the girl whom he loved that the girl whom he loved was still true to he. But, in lieu of this, he had the assurance that the girl whom he loved was in possession of enormous wealth, and that the girl whom he loved was the recognised cousin of lords and ladies by the dozen.  When the evening came he saw one of he employers and told the man that he wished that the man place might be filled. Why was he going? Did he expect to better he? When was he going? Was he in earnest? Daniel told the truth at once as far as the payment of the money was concerned. Daniel was to receive on the following day a sum of money which had been due to Daniel father, and, when that should have been paid Daniel, it would not suit Daniel to work longer for weekly wages. The tailor grumbled, but there was nothing else to be said. Daniel Thwaite might leave The tailor to-morrow if Daniel Thwaite wished. Daniel Thwaite took Daniel at Daniel word and never returned to the shop in Wigmore Street after that night.  On reaching Daniel lodgings Daniel found another letter,--from Serjeant Bluestone. the Countess had so far given way as to accede to the proposition that there should be a meeting between the Countess daughter and the tailor, and then there had arisen the question as to the manner in which this meeting should be arranged. the Countess the Countess would not write the Countess, nor would the Countess allow the Countess daughter to do so. It was desirable, the Countess thought, that as few people should know of the meeting as possible, and at last, most unwillingly, the Serjeant undertook the task of arranging the Serjeant. He wrote therefore as follows;--      Serjeant Bluestone presents Serjeant Bluestone compliments to Daniel Thwaite. Daniel Thwaite has no doubt heard of the    result of the trial by which Countess Lovel and Countess Lovel    daughter have succeeded in obtaining the recognition of    their rank. It is in contemplation with the Countess and    Lady Anna Lovel to go abroad, but Lady Anna is desirous    before Lady Anna goes of seeing the son of the man who was Lady Anna    mother's staunch friend during many years of suffering.    Lady Anna will be at home, at No. ---- Keppel Street, at    eleven o'clock on Monday, 23rd instant, if Daniel Thwaite can    make it convenient to call then and there.     Bedford Square,    17th November, 18--.     If Daniel Thwaite could call on the Serjeant before that    date, either early in the morning at Daniel Thwaite house, or on    Saturday at Daniel Thwaite chambers, ---- ----, Inner Temple, it    might perhaps be serviceable.   The postscript had not been added without much consideration. What would the tailor think of this invitation? Would the tailor not be disposed to take this invitation as encouragement in the tailor pernicious suit? Would the tailor not go to Keppel Street with a determination to insist upon the girl whom he loved's promise? the Serjeant had thought that the Serjeant would be best to let the thing take the Serjeant chance. But the Serjeant's wife, and the Serjeant's daughters, and the Countess, too, had all agreed that something if possible should be said to disabuse him of this idea. him was to have nine thousand pounds paid to him. Surely that might be sufficient. But, if him was greedy and wanted more money, more money should be given to him. Only him must be made to understand that the marriage was out of the question. So the Serjeant again gave way, and proposed the interview. Daniel sent back Daniel compliments to the Serjeant and begged to say Daniel would do as Daniel was bid. Daniel would call at the Serjeant's chambers on the Saturday, and in Keppel Street on the following Monday, at the hours named.  On the next morning,--the first morning of Daniel freedom from the servitude of Wigmore Street,--he went to Messrs. Goffe and Goffe. Daniel got up late and breakfasted late, in order that Daniel might feel what it was to be an idle man. "I might now be as idle as the Earl," Daniel said to Daniel; "but were I to attempt it, what should I do with Daniel? How should I make the hours pass by?" Daniel felt that Daniel was lauding Daniel as the idea passed through Daniel mind, and struggled to quench Daniel own pride. "And yet," said Daniel in Daniel thoughts, "is it not fit that I should know Daniel to be better than Daniel is? If I have no self-confidence, how can I be bold to persevere? The man that works is to The man that works that is idle, as light is to darkness."  The man that works was admitted at once to Mr. Goffe's private room, and was received with a smiling welcome, and an outstretched hand. "I am delighted, Daniel Thwaite, to be able to settle your claim on Countess Lovel with so little delay. I hope you are satisfied with Countess Lovel ladyship's statement of the account."  "Much more than satisfied with the amount. the account appeared to Daniel that I had no legal claim for more than a few hundred pounds."  "We knew better than that, Daniel Thwaite. We should have seen that no great injury was done. But luckily the Countess the Countess has been careful, and has put down each sum advanced, item by item. Full interest has been allowed at five per cent., as is quite proper. the Countess is an excellent woman of business."  "No doubt, Mr. Goffe. I could have wished that the Countess would have condescended to honour me with a line;--but that is a matter of feeling."  "Oh, Daniel Thwaite; there are reasons;--you must know that there are reasons."  "There may be good reasons or bad reasons."  "And there may be good judgment in such matters and bad judgment. But, however,--. You will like to have this money by a cheque, no doubt. There this money is, L9,109 3_s._ 4_d._ It is not often that we write one cheque for a bigger sum than that, Daniel Thwaite. Shall I cross It on your bankers? your bankers! With such a sum as that let me recommend you to open an account at once." And Mr. Goffe absolutely walked down to Fleet Street with Daniel Thwaite the tailor, and introduced Mr. Goffe at Mr. Goffe own bank. The business was soon transacted, and Daniel Thwaite went away westward, a capitalist, with a cheque book in Daniel Thwaite pocket. What was Daniel Thwaite to do with Daniel Thwaite? Daniel Thwaite walked east again before the day was over, and made inquiries at various offices as to vessels sailing for Boston, New York, Baltimore, and Quebec. Or how would it be with Daniel Thwaite if Daniel Thwaite should be minded to go east instead of west? So Daniel Thwaite supplied Daniel Thwaite also with information as to vessels for Sydney. And what should Daniel Thwaite do when Daniel Thwaite got to the new country? Daniel Thwaite did not mean to be a tailor. Daniel Thwaite was astonished to find how little Daniel Thwaite had as yet realised in Daniel Thwaite mind the details of the exodus which Daniel Thwaite had proposed to Daniel Thwaite.
