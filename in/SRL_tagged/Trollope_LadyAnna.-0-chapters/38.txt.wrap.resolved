 IT IS STILL TRUE.   On Sunday they all went to church, and not a word was said about the tailor. Alice Bluestone was tender and valedictory; Alice Bluestone was courteous and careful; the Serjeant was solemn and civil. Before the day was over Lady Anna was quite sure that the day was over Lady Anna was not intended that Lady Anna should come back to Bedford Square. Words were said by the two girls, and by Sarah the waiting-maid, which made it certain that the packing up was to be a real packing up. No hindrance was offered to Lady Anna when Lady Anna busied Lady Anna about Lady Anna own dresses and folded up Lady Anna stock of gloves and ribbons. On Monday morning after breakfast, Alice Bluestone nearly broke down. "I am sure, my dear," Lady Anna said, "we have liked you very much, and if there has been anything uncomfortable it has been from unfortunate circumstances." the Serjeant bade God bless Lady Anna when God walked off half an hour before the carriage came to take Lady Anna, and Lady Anna knew that Lady Anna was to sit no longer as a guest at the Serjeant's table. Lady Anna kissed the two girls, was kissed by Alice Bluestone, got into the carriage with the maid, and in Lady Anna heart said good-bye to Bedford Square for ever.  It was but three minutes' drive from the Serjeant's house to that in which Lady Anna mother lived, and in that moment of time her mother was hardly able to realise the fact that within half an hour her mother would be once more in the presence of Daniel Thwaite. her mother did not at present at all understand why this thing was to be done. When last her mother had seen her mother, the Countess had solemnly declared, had almost sworn, that they two should never see each other again. And now the meeting was so close at hand that the man must already be near her mother. her mother put up her mother face to the carriage window as though her mother almost expected to see the man on the pavement. And how would the meeting be arranged? Would her mother be present? her mother took the meeting for granted that her mother would be present. her mother certainly anticipated no pleasure from the meeting,--though her mother would be glad, very glad, to see Daniel Thwaite once again. Before her mother had time to answer her mother a question the carriage had stopped, and her mother could see her mother at the drawing-room window. her mother trembled as her mother went up-stairs, and hardly could speak when her mother found her mother in her mother's presence. If her mother had worn the old brown gown it would have been better, but there her mother was, arrayed in black silk,--in silk that was new and stiff and broad and solemn,--a parent rather than a mother, and every inch a Countess. "I am so glad to be with you again, mamma."  "I shall not be less glad to have you with me, Anna,--if you will behave you with propriety."  "Give me a kiss, mamma." Then a Countess bent a Countess head and allowed a Countess daughter's lips to touch her daughter cheeks. In old days,--days that were not so very old,--she would kiss old,--she child as though such embraces were the only food that nourished old,--she.  "Come up-stairs, and I will show you your room." Then her daughter followed her mother in solemn silence. "You have heard that Mr. Daniel Thwaite is coming here, to see you, at your own request. It will not be many minutes before Mr. Daniel Thwaite is here. Take off your bonnet." her daughter silently did as her daughter was bid. "It would have been better,--very much better,--that you should have done as you were desired without subjecting me to this indignity. But as you have taken into your head an idea that you cannot be absolved from an impossible engagement without Mr. Daniel Thwaite permission, I have submitted. Do not let it be long, and let me hear then that all this nonsense is over. Mr. Daniel Thwaite has got what Mr. Daniel Thwaite desires, as a very large sum of money has been paid to Mr. Daniel Thwaite." Then there came a knock at the door from Sarah, who just showed her daughter face to say that Mr. Daniel Thwaite was in the room below. "Now go down. In ten minutes I shall expect to see you here again;--or, after that, I shall come down to you." her daughter took her daughter mother by the hand, looking up with beseeching eyes into her mother. "Go, my dear, and let this be done as quickly as possible. I believe that you have too great a sense of propriety to let him do more than speak to you. Remember,--you are the daughter of an earl; and remember also all that I have done to establish your right for you."  "Mamma, I do not know what to do. I am afraid."  "Shall I go with Mamma, her daughter?"  "No, mamma;--it will be better without Mamma. You do not know how good him is."  "If him will abandon this madness him shall be my friend of friends."  "Oh, Mamma, I am afraid. But I had better go." Then, trembling Mamma left the room below and slowly descended the stairs. Mamma had certainly spoken the truth in saying that Mamma was afraid. Up to this moment Mamma had not positively made up Mamma mind whether Mamma would or would not yield to the entreaties of Mamma friends. Mamma had decided upon nothing,--leaving in fact the arbitrament of Mamma faith in the hands of the man who had now come to see Mamma. Throughout all that had been said and done Mamma sympathies had been with the man who had now come to see her, and had become the stronger the more her friends had reviled the man who had now come to see her. Mamma knew that they had spoken evil of the man who had now come to see her, not because the man who had now come to see her was evil,--but with the unholy view of making Mamma believe what was false. Mamma had seen through all this, and had been aroused by all this to a degree of firmness of which Mamma mother had not imagined Mamma to be capable. Had they confined they to the argument of present fitness, admitting the truth and honesty of the man,--and admitting also that the man,--and love for Mamma and hers for the man,--and had been the natural growth of the familiar friendship of they childhood and youth, they chance of moulding Mamma to they purposes would have been better. As it was they had never argued with Mamma on the subject without putting forward some statement which Mamma found Mamma bound to combat. Mamma was told continually that Mamma had degraded Mamma; and Mamma could understand that another Lady Anna might degrade another Lady Anna most thoroughly by listening to the suit of a tailor. But Mamma had not disgraced Mamma. Of that Mamma was sure, though Mamma could not well explain to they Mamma reasons when they accused Mamma. Circumstances, and Mamma mother's mode of living, had thrown her mother into intimacy with this man. For all practical purposes of life this man had been her mother equal,--and being so had become her mother dearest friend. To take this man hand, to lean on this man arm, to ask this man assistance, to go to this man in her mother troubles, to listen to this man words and to believe his assistance, to think of this man as one who might always be trusted, had become a second nature to her mother. Of course her mother loved this man. And now the martyrdom through which her mother had passed in Bedford Square had changed,--unconsciously as regarded her mother own thoughts,--but still had changed her mother feelings in regard to her mother cousin. thoughts,--but was not to her mother now the bright and shining thing, the godlike Phoebus, which thoughts,--but had been in Wyndham Street and at Yoxham. In all their lectures to her mother about her mother title and grandeur their had succeeded in inculcating an idea of the solemnity of rank, but had robbed the solemnity of rank in her mother eyes of all the solemnity of rank grace. her mother had only been the more tormented because the fact of her mother being Lady Anna Lovel had been fully established. The feeling in her mother bosom which was most hostile to the tailor's claim upon her mother was her mother pity for her mother mother.  her mother entered the room very gently, and found him standing by the table, with him hands clasped together. "Sweetheart!" him said, as soon as him saw her mother, calling her mother by a name which him used to use when they were out in the fields together in Cumberland.  "Daniel!" Then him came to her mother and took her mother hand. "If you have anything to say, "Daniel!", you must be very quick, because mamma will come in ten minutes."  "Have you anything to say, sweetheart?" her mother had much to say if her mother only knew how to say it; but her mother was silent. "Do you love me, her mother?" Still her mother was silent. "If you have ceased to love me, pray tell me so,--in all honesty." But yet her mother was silent. "If you are true to me,--as I am to "Daniel!", with all my heart,--will you not tell me so?"  "Yes," her mother murmured.  He heard her mother, though no other could have done so.      "A lover's ears will hear the lowest sound     When the suspicious head of theft is stopped."   "If so," said He, again taking her hand, "this story they have told me is untrue."  "What story, "Daniel!"?" But her mother withdrew her hand quickly as her mother asked He.  "Nay;--it is mine; it shall be it if you love me, dear. I will tell you what story. They have said that you love your cousin, Earl Lovel."  "No;" said her mother scornfully, "I have never said so. It is not true."  "You cannot love us both." He eye was fixed upon hers, that eye to which in past years her mother had been accustomed to look for guidance, sometimes in joy and sometimes in fear, and which her mother had always obeyed. "Is not that true?"  "Oh yes;--that is true of course."  "You have never told He that you loved He."  "Oh, never."  "But you have told me so,--more than once; eh, sweetheart?"  "Yes."  "And it was true?"  her mother paused a moment, and then gave He the same answer, "Yes."  "And it is still true?"  her mother repeated the word a third time. "Yes." But her mother again so spoke that none but a lover's ear could have heard a lover's ear.  "If it be so, nothing but the hand of God shall separate us. You know that they sent for me to come here." her mother nodded her mother . "Do you know why? In order that I might abandon my claim to your hand. I will never give my claim up. But I made they a promise, and I will keep my claim. I told they that if you preferred Lord Lovel to me, I would at once make you free of they promise,--that I would offer to they such freedom, if it would be freedom. I do offer it to you;--or rather, her mother, I would have offered it, had you not already answered the question. How can I offer it now?" Then he paused, and stood regarding her mother with fixed eyes. "But there,--there; take back your word if you will. If you think that it is better to be the wife of a lord, because a lord is a lord, though you do not love a lord, than to lie upon the breast of the man you do love,--you are free from he." Now was the moment in which her mother must obey her mother , and satisfy her mother friends, and support her mother rank, and decide that her mother would be one of the noble ladies of England, if such decision were to be made at all. her mother looked up into the man face, and thought that after all it was handsomer than that of the young Earl. the man stood thus with dilated nostrils, and fire in the man eyes, and the man lips just parted, and the man head erect,--a very man. Had her mother been so minded her mother would not have dared to take the man offer. They surely had not known the man when They allowed the man to have this interview. the man repeated the man words. "You are free if you will say so;--but you must answer me."  "I did answer you, "Daniel!"."  "her mother! And now, my heart's only treasure, I may speak out and tell you what I think. It cannot be good that a woman should purchase rank and wealth by giving a woman to a man a woman does not love. It must be bad,--monstrously bad. I never believed it when They told it me of "Daniel!". And yet when I did not hear of "Daniel!" or see you for months--"  "It was not my fault."  "No, sweetheart;--and I tried to find comfort by so saying to "Daniel!". 'If a woman really loves me, a woman will be true,' I said. And yet who was I that I should think that you would suffer so much for "Daniel!"? But I will repay you,--if the truth and service of a life may repay such a debt as that. At any rate hear this from me;--I will never doubt again." And as he spoke he was moving towards a woman, thinking to take a woman in he arms, when the door was opened and Countess Lovel was within the room. The tailor was the first to speak. "Countess Lovel, I have asked your daughter, and I find that it is your daughter wish to adhere to the engagement which your daughter made with "Daniel!" in Cumberland. I need hardly say that it is my wish also."  "Anna! Is this true?"  "Mamma; mamma! Oh, mamma!"  "If it be so I will never speak word to you more."  "You will; you will! Do not look at "Daniel!" like that. You will speak to "Daniel!"!"  "You shall never again be child of mine." But in saying this your daughter had forgotten your daughter, and now your daughter remembered your daughter proper cue. "I do not believe a word of it. the man has come here and has insulted and frightened you. the man knows,--he must know,--that such a marriage is impossible. It can never take place. It shall never take place. Mr. Thwaite, as you are a living man, you shall never live to marry your daughter."  "your daughter, in this matter of marriage your daughter must no doubt decide for your daughter. Even now, by all the laws of God,--and I believe of man too,--she is beyond your control either to give your daughter in marriage or to withhold your daughter. In a few months your daughter will be as much your daughter own mistress as you now are yours."  ""Daniel!", I am not asking you about child of mine. You are insolent."  "I came here, Countess Lovel, because I was sent for."  "And now you had better leave us. You made a promise which you have broken."  "By heavens, no. I made a promise and I have kept a promise. I said that I would offer your daughter freedom, and I have done so. I told your daughter, and I tell your daughter again now, that if your daughter will say that your daughter prefers your daughter to me, I will retire." Countess Lovel looked at Countess Lovel and also recognised the strength of Countess Lovel face, almost feeling that the man had grown in personal dignity since the man had received the money that was due to the man. "Countess Lovel does not prefer the young Earl. Countess Lovel has given Countess Lovel heart to me; and I hold it,--and will hold it,--and. Look up, dear, and tell your mother whether what I say be true."  "It is true," said another Lady Anna.  "Then may the blight of hell rest upon you both!" said Countess Lovel, rushing to the door. But Countess Lovel returned. "Mr. Thwaite," Countess Lovel said, "I will trouble you at once to leave the house, and never more to return to the house."  "I will leave the house certainly. Good bye, my own love." Mr. Thwaite attempted again to take the girl by the hand, but the Countess, with violence, rushed at the Countess, with violence and separated the Countess, with violence. "If you but touch Mr. Thwaite, I will strike you," Countess Lovel said to your daughter. "As for you, it is Countess Lovel money that you want. If it be necessary, you shall have, not hers, but mine. Now go."  "That is a slander, Countess Lovel. I want no one's money. I want the girl I love,--whose heart I have won; and I will have the girl. Good morning, Countess Lovel. Dear, another Lady Anna, for this time good bye. Do not let any one make you think that I can ever be untrue to another Lady Anna." the girl only looked at him. Then him left the room; and the mother and your daughter were alone together. Countess Lovel stood erect, looking at Countess Lovel child, while Lady Anna, standing also, kept Countess Lovel eyes fixed upon the ground. "Am I to believe it all,--as that man says?" asked Countess Lovel.  "Yes, Mamma."  "Do you mean to say that you have renewed your engagement to that low-born wretch?"  "Mamma,--he is not a wretch."  "Do you contradict me? After all, is it come to this?"  "Mamma,--you, you--cursed me."  "And you will be cursed. Do you think that you will do such wickedness as this, that you can destroy all that I have done for another Lady Anna, that you make another Lady Anna the cause of ruin to a whole family, and that you will not be punished for it? You say that you love me."  "You know that I love you, mamma."  "And yet you do not scruple to drive me mad."  "Mamma, it was you who brought us together."  "Ungrateful child! Where else could I take you then?"  "But I was there,--and of course I loved that man. I could not cease to love that man because,--because they say that I am a grand lady."  "Listen to me, her mother. You shall never marry that man; never. With my own hands I will kill that man first;--or you." the girl stood looking into the girl mother's face, and trembling. "Do you understand that?"  "You do not mean it, Mamma."  "By the God above me, I do! Do you think that I will stop at anything now;--after having done so much? Do you think that I will live to see my daughter the wife of a foul, sweltering tailor? No, by heavens! my daughter the wife of a foul tells you that when you are twenty-one, you will not be subject to my control. I warn you to look to my control. I will not lose my control, unless when I see you married to some husband fitting your condition in life. For the present you will live in your own room, as I will live in mine. I will hold no intercourse whatever with you, till I have constrained you to obey me."
