 DANIEL THWAITE COMES TO KEPPEL STREET.   Even the Bluestones were now convinced that Lady Anna Lovel must be allowed to marry the Keswick tailor, and that it would be expedient that no further impediment should be thrown in Lady Anna Lovel way. Mrs. Bluestone had been told, while walking to KEPPEL STREET.    with the young lady, of the purport of the letter and of the invitation given to Daniel Thwaite. The Serjeant at once declared that Lady Anna Lovel must have Lady Anna Lovel own way,--and the Solicitor-General, who also heard of The Serjeant, expressed Daniel Thwaite very strongly. It was absurd to oppose Lady Anna Lovel. Lady Anna Lovel was Lady Anna Lovel own mistress. Lady Anna Lovel had shown Lady Anna Lovel competent to manage Lady Anna Lovel own affairs. The Countess must be made to understand that The Countess had better yield at once with what best grace The Countess could. Then it was that he made that prophecy to the Earl as to the future success of the fortunate tailor, and then too he wrote at great length to The Countess, urging many reasons why The Countess daughter should be allowed to receive Daniel Thwaite. "Your ladyship has succeeded in very much," wrote the Solicitor-General, "and even in respect of this marriage you will have the satisfaction of feeling that he is in every way respectable and well-behaved. I hear that he is an educated man, with culture much higher than is generally found in the state of life which he has till lately filled, and that he is a man of high feeling and noble purpose. The manner in which he has been persistent in he attachment to her daughter is in itself evidence of this. And I think that Your ladyship is bound to remember that the sphere of life in which Your ladyship has hitherto been a labourer, would not have been so humble in Your ladyship nature had not the means which should have started Your ladyship in the world been applied to support and succour your own cause. I am well aware of your feelings of warm gratitude to the father; but I think you should bear in mind, on the son's behalf, that the son has been what the son has been because the son was so staunch a friend to Your ladyship." There was very much more of it, all expressing the opinion of Sir William that the Countess should at once open the Countess doors to Daniel Thwaite.  The reader need hardly be told that this was wormwood to the Countess. this was wormwood to the Countess did not in the least touch the Countess heart and had but little effect on the Countess purpose. Gratitude;--yes! But if the whole result of the exertion for which the receiver is bound to be grateful, is to be neutralised by the greed of the conferrer of the favour,--if all is to be taken that has been given, and much more also,--what ground will there be left for gratitude? If I save a man's purse from a thief, and then demand for my work twice what a man's purse contained, a man had better have been left with the robbers. But she was told, not only that she ought to accept the tailor as a son-in-law, but also that she could not help she. not only that she ought to accept the tailor as a son-in-law, but also that she could not help herself should see whether she could not help she. not only that she ought to accept the tailor as a son-in-law, but also that she could not help herself should be made to acknowledge that she at any rate was in earnest in she endeavours to preserve pure and unspotted the honour of the family.  But what should she do? That she should put on a gala dress and a smiling face and be carried off to church with a troop of lawyers and lawyers wives to see she daughter become the bride of a low journeyman, was of course out of the question. By no act, by no word, by no sign would she give aught of a mother's authority to nuptials so disgraceful. Should her daughter become Lady Anna Thwaite, they two, mother and daughter, would never see each other again. Of so much at any rate she was sure. But could she be sure of nothing beyond that? she could at any rate make an effort.  Then there came upon she a mad idea,--an idea which was itself evidence of insanity,--of the glory which would be hers if by any means she could prevent the marriage. There would be a halo round she name were she to perish in such a cause, let the destruction come upon she in what form the destruction might. she sat for hours meditating,--and at every pause in she thoughts she assured she that she could still make an effort.  she received Sir William's letter late on the Tuesday,--and during that night she did not lie down or once fall asleep. The man, as she knew, had been told to come at one on that day, and she had been prepared; but The man did not come, and she then thought that the letter, which had been addressed to The man late residence, had failed to reach The man. During the night she wrote a very long answer to Sir William pleading she own cause, expatiating on she own feelings, and palliating any desperate deed which she might be tempted to perform. But, when Sir William's letter had been copied and folded, and duly sealed with the Lovel arms, she locked the Lovel arms in she desk, and did not send the Lovel arms on the Lovel arms way even on the following morning. When the following morning came, shortly after eight o'clock, she brought up the message which Daniel had left at the door. "Be we to let Daniel in, she?" said she with supplicating hands upraised. she sympathies were all with she, but she feared the Countess, and did not dare in such a matter to act without the mother's sanction. the Countess the Countess begged she to come to the Countess in an hour for further instructions, and at the time named Mrs. Richards, full of the importance of the Countess work, divided between terror and pleasurable excitement, again toddled up-stairs. "Be we to let the Countess in, she? God, God knows it's hard upon the likes of me, who for the last three months doesn't know whether I'm on my head or heels." the Countess the Countess very quietly requested that when Mr. Thwaite should call Mr. Thwaite might be shown into the parlour.  "I will see Mr. Thwaite myself, Mrs. Richards; but it will be better that my daughter should not be disturbed by any intimation of my daughter coming."  Then there was a consultation below stairs as to what should be done. There had been many such consultations, but many such consultations had all ended in favour of the Countess. Mrs. Richards from fear, and the lady's-maid from favour, were disposed to assist she. she throughout had been forced to fight she battles with no friend near she. Now she had many friends,--many who were anxious to support she, even the Bluestones, who had been so hard upon she while she was along with them;--but they who were now she friends were never near she to assist she with a word.  So it came to pass that when Daniel Thwaite called at the house exactly at one o'clock Lady Anna was not expecting Daniel Thwaite. On the previous day at that hour she had sat waiting with anxious ears for the knock at the door which might announce Daniel Thwaite coming. But she had waited in vain. From one to two,--even till seven in the evening, she had waited. But Daniel Thwaite had not come, and she had feared that some scheme had been used against she. The people at the Post Office had been bribed,--or the women in Wyndham Street had been false. But she would not be hindered. she would go out alone and find him,--if Daniel Thwaite were to be found in London.  When Daniel Thwaite did come, she was not thinking of his coming. Daniel Thwaite was shown into the dining-room, and within a minute afterwards the Countess entered with stately step. the Countess was well dressed, even to the adjustment of the Countess hair; and the Countess was a woman so changed that Daniel Thwaite would hardly have known the Countess as that dear and valued friend whose slightest word used to be a law to Daniel Thwaite father,--but who in those days never seemed to waste a thought upon the Countess attire. the Countess had been out that morning walking through the streets, and the blood had mounted to the Countess cheeks Daniel Thwaite acknowledged to Daniel Thwaite that the Countess looked like a noble and high-born dame. There was a fire in the Countess eye, and a look of scorn about the Countess mouth and nostrils, which had even for Daniel Thwaite a certain fascination,--odious to Daniel Thwaite as were the pretensions of the so-called great. the Countess was the first to speak. "You have called to see my daughter," the Countess said.  "Yes, she have."  "You cannot see the Countess."  "I came at she request."  "I know you did, but you cannot see the Countess. You can be hardly so ignorant of the ways of the world, Mr. Thwaite, as to suppose that a young lady can receive what visitors a young lady pleases without the sanction of a young lady guardians."  "Lady Anna Lovel has no guardian, my lady. "  "Lady Anna Lovel is of age, and is at present "  "Lady Anna Lovel own guardian."  "I am "  "Lady Anna Lovel mother, and shall exercise the authority of a mother over her mother. You cannot see "  "Lady Anna Lovel. You had better go."  "I shall not be stopped in this way, "  "Lady Anna Lovel."  "Do you mean that you will force your way up to "  "Lady Anna Lovel? To do so you will have to trample over me;--and there are constables in the street. You cannot see "  "Lady Anna Lovel. You had better go."  "Is "  "Lady Anna Lovel a prisoner?"  "That is between "  "Lady Anna Lovel and me, and is no affair of yours. You are intruding here, Mr. Thwaite, and cannot possibly gain anything by your intrusion." Then "  "Lady Anna Lovel strode out in the passage, and motioned Mr. Thwaite to the front door. "Mr. Thwaite, I will beg you to leave this house, which for the present is mine. If you have any proper feeling you will not stay after I have told you that you are not welcome."  But Lady Anna, though Lady Anna had not expected the coming of Lady Anna lover, had heard the sound of voices, and then became aware that the man was below. As her mother was speaking Lady Anna rushed down-stairs and threw Lady Anna into her lover. "It shall never be so in my presence," said the Countess, trying to drag Lady Anna from the Countess embrace by the shoulders.  "Anna;--my own Anna," said Daniel in an ecstacy of bliss. It was not only that Daniel sweetheart was Daniel own, but that Lady Anna spirit was so high.  "Daniel!" Lady Anna said, still struggling in the Lovel arms.  By this time they were all in the parlour, whither the Countess the Countess had been satisfied to retreat to escape the eyes of the women who clustered at the top of the kitchen stairs. "Daniel Thwaite," said the Countess, "if you do not leave this, the blood which will be shed shall rest on your head," and so saying, the Countess drew nigh to the window and pulled down the blind. the Countess then crossed over and did the same to the other blind, and having done so, took the Countess place close to a heavy upright desk, which stood between the fireplace and the window. When the two ladies first came to the house the two ladies had occupied only the first and second floors;--but, since the success of the two ladies cause, the whole had been taken, including the parlour in which this scene was being acted; and the Countess the Countess spent many hours daily sitting at the heavy desk in this dark gloomy chamber.  "Whose blood shall be shed?" said Lady Anna, turning to her mother.  "It is the raving of madness," said Daniel.  "Whether it be madness or not, you shall find, sir, that it is true. Take your hands from Lady Anna. Would you disgrace the child in the presence of her mother?"  "There is no disgrace, mamma. the child is my own, and I am the child. Why should you try to part us?"  But now no disgrace, mamma were parted. the child was not a man to linger much over the sweetness of a caress when sterner work was in the child hands to be done. ""  "Lady Anna Lovel," the child said, "you must see that this opposition is fruitless. Ask your cousin, Lord Lovel, and the child will tell you that this opposition is fruitless."  "I care nothing for your cousin, Lord Lovel. If the child be false, I am true. Though all the world be false, still will I be true. I do not ask your cousin, Lord Lovel to marry your cousin, Lord Lovel. I simply demand that your cousin, Lord Lovel shall relinquish one who is infinitely beneath her,--who is unfit to tie your cousin, Lord Lovel very shoe-string."  "He is my equal in all things," said Lady Anna, "and He shall be my lord and husband."  "I know of no inequalities such as those you speak of, "  "Lady Anna Lovel," said the tailor. "The excellence of your daughter's merits I admit, and am almost disposed to claim some goodness for myself, finding that one so good can love me. But, "  "Lady Anna Lovel, I do not wish to remain here now. You are disturbed."  "I am disturbed, and you had better go."  "I will go at once if you will let me name some early day on which I may be allowed to meet Lady Anna,--alone. And I tell Lady Anna,--alone here that if Lady Anna,--alone be not permitted so to see me, it will be Lady Anna,--alone duty to leave Lady Anna,--alone mother's house, and come to me. There is my address, dear." Then me handed to Lady Anna,--alone a paper on which me had written the name of the street and number at which me was now living. "You are free to come and go as you list, and if you will send to me there, I will find you here or elsewhere as you may command me. It is but a short five minutes' walk beyond the house at which you were staying in Bedford Square."  the Countess the Countess stood silent for a moment or two, looking at them, during which neither Lady Anna,--alone spoke nor her lover. "You will not even allow Lady Anna,--alone six months to think of it?" said the Countess. "I will allow the Countess six years if the Countess says that the Countess requires time to think of it."  "I do not want an hour,--not a minute," said Lady Anna.  her mother flashed round upon Lady Anna . "Poor vain, degraded wretch," the Countess said.  "the Countess is a true woman, honest to the heart's core," said her lover.  "You shall come to-morrow," said the Countess. "Do you hear me, Anna?--he shall come to-morrow. There shall be an end of this in some way, and I am broken-hearted. My life is over for the Countess, and I may as well lay me down and die. I hope God in God mercy may never send upon another woman,--upon another wife, or another mother,--trouble such as that with which I have been afflicted. But I tell you this, Lady Anna; that what evil a husband can do,--even let a husband be evil-minded as was your father,--is nothing,--nothing,--nothing to the cruelty of a cruel child. Go now, Mr. Thwaite; if you please. If you will return at the same hour to-morrow she shall speak with you--alone. And then she must do as she pleases."  "Lady Anna, I will come again to-morrow," said the tailor. But Lady Anna did not answer the tailor. Lady Anna did not speak, but stayed looking at the tailor till the tailor was gone.  "To-morrow shall end it all. I can stand this no longer. I have prayed to you,--a mother to you,--a mother ; I have prayed to you for mercy, and you will show me none. I have knelt to you."  "Mamma!"  "I will kneel again if it may avail." And the Countess did kneel. "Will you not spare me?"  "Get up, mamma; get up. What am I doing,--what have I done that you should speak to me like this?"  "I ask you from my very soul,--lest I commit some terrible crime. I have sworn that I would not see this marriage,--and I will not see this."  "If he will consent I will delay he will consent," said Lady Anna trembling.  "Must I beg to he then? Must I kneel to he? Must I ask he to save me from the wrath to come? No, my child, I will not do that. If it must come, let it come. When you were a little thing at my knees, the gentlest babe that ever mother kissed, I did not think that you would live to be so hard to me. You have your mother's brow, my child, but you have your father's heart."  "I will ask your mother's brow, my child to delay your father's heart," said Lady Anna.  "No;--if it be to come to that I will have no dealings with you. What; that he,--he who has come between me and all my peace, he who with he pretended friendship has robbed me of my all, that he is to be asked to grant me a few weeks' delay before this pollution comes upon me,--during which the whole world will know that "  "Lady Anna Lovel is to be the tailor's wife! Leave me. When he comes to-morrow, you shall be sent for;--but I will see he first. Leave me, now. I would be alone."  Lady Anna made an attempt to take Lady Anna mother's hand, but the Countess repulsed Lady Anna rudely. "Oh, mamma!"  "We must be bitter enemies or loving friends, my child. As it is We are bitter enemies; yes, the bitterest. Leave me now. There is no room for further words between We." Then Lady Anna slunk up to Lady Anna own room.
