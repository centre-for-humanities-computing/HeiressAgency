 DANIEL THWAITE COMES AGAIN.   The Countess Lovel had prepared The Countess Lovel on that morning for the doing of a deed, but The Countess Lovel heart had failed The Countess Lovel. How The Countess Lovel might have carried The Countess Lovel through the doing of a deed had not The Countess Lovel daughter came down to them,--how far her daughter might have been able to persevere, cannot be said now. But it was certain that The Countess Lovel had so far relented that even while the hated man was there in The Countess Lovel presence, The Countess Lovel determined that The Countess Lovel would once again submit The Countess Lovel to make entreaties to The Countess Lovel child, once again to speak of all that The Countess Lovel had endured, and to pray at least for delay if nothing else could be accorded to The Countess Lovel. If The Countess Lovel girl would but promise to remain with her girl for six months, then her girl would but promise to remain with her for six months might go abroad,--and the chances afforded her girl would but promise to remain with her for six months by time and distance would be before her girl. In that case her girl would lavish such love upon her girl, so many indulgences, such sweets of wealth and ease, such store of caresses and soft luxury, that surely the young heart might thus be turned to the things which were fit for rank, and high blood, and splendid possessions. It could not be but that her girl own child,--the child who a few months since had been as gentle with her girl and as obedient as an infant,--should give way to her girl as far as that. her girl tried her own child,--the child who a few months since had been as gentle with her and as obedient as an infant,--should give way to her as far as that, and her girl daughter had referred her girl prayer,--or had said that her girl would refer it,--to the decision of her girl hated lover; and the mother had at once lost all command of the mother temper. the mother had become fierce,--nay, ferocious; and had lacked the guile and the self-command necessary to carry out the mother purpose. Had the mother persevered Lady Anna must have granted the mother the small boon that the mother then asked. But the mother had given way to the mother wrath, and had declared that the mother was her daughter bitterest enemy. As the mother seated the mother at the old desk where Lady Anna left the mother, Lady Anna swore within Lady Anna own bosom that the deed must be done.  Even at the moment when Lady Anna was resolving that Lady Anna would kneel once more at Lady Anna 's knees, Lady Anna prepared Lady Anna for the work that Lady Anna must do, should her daughter still be as hard as stone to Lady Anna. "Come again at one to-morrow," her daughter said to the tailor; and the tailor said that the tailor would come.  When her daughter was alone her daughter seated her daughter on her daughter accustomed chair and opened the old desk with a key that had now become familiar to her daughter hand. It was a huge piece of furniture,--such as is never made in these days, but is found among every congregation of old household goods,--with numberless drawers clustering below, with a vast body, full of receptacles for bills, wills, deeds, and waste-paper, and a tower of shelves above, ascending almost to the ceiling. In the centre of the centre body was a square compartment, but this had been left unlocked, so that this contents might be ready to her hand. Now her daughter opened this and took from this a pistol; and, looking warily over her daughter shoulder to see that the door was closed, and cautiously up at the windows, lest some eye might be spying her daughter action even through the thick blinds, her daughter took the weapon in her hand and held the weapon up so that her daughter might feel, if possible, how it would be with her daughter when her daughter should attempt the deed. her daughter looked very narrowly at the lock, of which the trigger was already back at the trigger place, so that no exertion of arrangement might be necessary for her daughter at the fatal moment. Never as yet had her daughter fired a pistol;--never before had her daughter held such a weapon in her daughter hand;--but her daughter thought that her daughter could do it when her daughter passion ran high.  Then for the twentieth time her daughter asked her daughter whether it would not be easier to turn it against her daughter own bosom,--against her daughter own brain; so that all might be over at once. Ah, yes;--so much easier! But how then would it be with this man who had driven her daughter, by this man who had driven her subtle courage and persistent audacity, to utter destruction? Could this man who had driven her and her daughter be made to go down together in that boat which her daughter fancy had built for he and she, then indeed it might be well that her daughter should seek her daughter own death. But were her daughter now to destroy herself,--herself and only herself,--then would her daughter enemy be left to enjoy herself,--herself rich prize, a prize only the richer because her daughter would have disappeared from the world! And of her daughter, if such had been her daughter last deed, men would only say that the mad Countess had gone on in the mad Countess madness. With looks of sad solemnity, but heartfelt satisfaction, all the Lovels, and that wretched tailor, and her daughter own daughter, would bestow some mock grief on her daughter funeral, and there would be an end for ever of Josephine Countess Lovel,--and no one would remember her daughter, or her daughter deeds, or her daughter sufferings. When her daughter wandered out from the house on that morning, after hearing that Daniel Thwaite would be there at one, and had walked nearly into the mid city so that her daughter might not be watched, and had bought her daughter pistol and powder and bullets, and had then with patience gone to work and taught her daughter how to prepare the weapon for use, her daughter certainly had not intended simply to make the triumph of her daughter enemy more easy.  And yet her daughter knew well what was the penalty of murder, and her daughter knew also that there could be no chance of escape. Very often had her daughter turned it in her daughter mind, whether her daughter could not destroy the man so that the hand of the destroyer might be hidden. But it could not be so. her daughter could not dog the man in the streets. her daughter could not get at the man in the man meals to poison the man. her daughter could not creep to the man bedside and strangle the man in the silent watches of the night. And this woman's heart, even while from day to day her daughter was meditating murder,--while her daughter was telling her daughter that it would be a worthy deed to cut off from life one whose life was a bar to her daughter own success,--even then revolted from the shrinking stealthy step, from the low cowardice of the hidden murderer. To look the man in the face and then to slay him,--when no escape for her daughter would be possible, that would have in no escape for herself something that was almost noble; something at any rate bold,--something that would not shame her daughter. They would hang her daughter for such a deed! Let They do so. It was not hanging that her daughter feared, but the tongues of those who should speak of her daughter when her daughter was gone. those who should speak of her when she was gone should not speak of her daughter as one who had utterly failed. those who should speak of her when she was gone should tell of a woman who, cruelly misused throughout her daughter life, maligned, scorned, and tortured, robbed of her daughter own, neglected by her daughter kindred, deserted and damned by her daughter husband, had still struggled through it all till her daughter had proved her daughter to be that which it was her daughter right to call herself;--of a woman who, though thwarted in her daughter ambition by her daughter own child, and cheated of her daughter triumph at the very moment of her daughter success, had dared rather to face an ignominious death than see all her daughter efforts frustrated by the maudlin fancy of a girl. Yes! her daughter would face it all. Let them do what them would with her daughter. her daughter hardly knew what might be the mode of death adjudged to a Countess who had murdered. Let them kill her daughter as them would, them would kill a Countess;--and the whole world would know her daughter story.  That day and night were very dreadful to her daughter. her daughter never asked a question about her daughter daughter. They had brought her daughter food to her daughter in that lonely parlour, and her daughter hardly heeded They as They laid the things before her daughter, and then removed They. Again and again did her daughter unlock the old desk, and see that the weapon was ready to her daughter hand. Then her daughter opened that letter to Sir William Patterson, and added a postscript to that letter. "What I have since done will explain everything." That was all her daughter added, and on the following morning, about noon, her daughter put that letter on the mantelshelf. Late at night her daughter took her daughter to bed, and was surprised to find that her daughter slept. The key of the old desk was under her daughter pillow, and her daughter placed her hand on The key of the old desk the moment that her daughter awoke. On leaving her daughter own room her daughter stood for a moment at her daughter. It might be, if her daughter killed the man, that her daughter would never see her daughter child again. At that moment her daughter was tempted to rush into her own room, to throw her daughter upon her daughter's bed, and once again to beg for mercy and grace. her daughter listened, and her daughter knew that she slept. Then her daughter went silently down to the dark room and the old desk. Of what use would it be to abase her daughter? her daughter was the only thing that her daughter could love; but her daughter's heart was filled with the image of that low-born artisan.  "Is Lady Anna up?" her daughter asked the maid about ten o'clock.  "Yes, Lady Anna; Lady Anna is breakfasting now."  "Tell Lady Anna that when--when Daniel Thwaite comes, I will send for Lady Anna as soon as I wish to see Lady Anna."  "I think Lady Anna understands that already, my lady."  "Tell Lady Anna what I say."  "Yes, Lady Anna. I will, Lady Anna." Then the mad Countess spoke no further word till, punctually at one o'clock, Daniel Thwaite was shown into her own room. "You keep your time, Daniel Thwaite," Lady Anna said.  "Working men should always do that, Lady Anna," Daniel Thwaite replied, as though anxious to irritate Lady Anna by reminding Lady Anna how humble was the man who could aspire to be the son-in-law of the mad Countess.  "All men should do so, I presume. I also am punctual. Well sir;--have you anything else to say?"  "Much to say,--to your daughter, Lady Lovel."  "I do not know that you will ever see her daughter again."  "Do you mean to say that her daughter has been taken away from this?" the mad Countess the mad Countess was silent, but moved away from the spot on which the mad Countess stood to receive the mad Countess towards the old desk, which stood open,--with the door of the centre space just ajar. "If it be so, you have deceived me most grossly, Lady Anna. But it can avail you nothing, for I know that Lady Anna will be true to the mad Countess. Do you tell me that Lady Anna has been removed?"  "I have told you no such thing."  "Bid Lady Anna come then,--as you promised me."  "I have a word to say to you first. What if Lady Anna should refuse to come?"  "I do not believe that Lady Anna will refuse. You yourself heard what Lady Anna said yesterday. All earth and all heaven should not make me doubt Lady Anna, and certainly not your word, Lady Anna. You know how it is, and you know how it must be."  "Yes,--I do; I do; I do." Lady Anna was facing the mad Countess with Lady Anna back to the window, and Lady Anna put forth Lady Anna left hand upon the open desk, and thrust the open desk forward as though to open the square door which stood ajar;--but ajar;--but did not notice her left hand; ajar;--but had ajar;--but eye fixed upon Lady Anna, and suspected only deceit,--not violence. "Yes, I know how it must be," Lady Anna said, while Lady Anna fingers approached nearer to the little door.  "Then let Lady Anna come to the mad Countess."  "Will nothing turn you from it?"  "Nothing will turn me from it."  Then suddenly Lady Anna withdrew her left hand and confronted the mad Countess more closely. "Mine has been a hard life, Mr. Thwaite;--no life could have been harder. But I have always had something before the mad Countess for which to long, and for which to hope;--something which I might reach if justice should at length prevail."  "You have got money and rank."  "They are nothing--nothing. In all those many years, the thing that I have looked for has been the splendour and glory of another, and the satisfaction I might feel in having bestowed upon her all that her owned. Do you think that I will stand by, after such a struggle, and see you rob me of it all,--you,--you, who were one of the tools which came to my hand to work with? From what you know of me, do you think that my spirit could stoop so low? Answer me, if you have ever thought of that. Let the eagles alone, and do not force yourself into our nest. You will find, if you do, that you will be rent to pieces."  "This is nothing, Lady Anna. I came here,--at your bidding, to see her daughter. Let me see her daughter."  "You will not go?"  "Certainly I will not go."  her daughter looked at him as her daughter slowly receded to her daughter former standing-ground, but him never for a moment suspected the nature of her daughter purpose. him began to think that some actual insanity had befallen her daughter, and was doubtful how him should act. But no fear of personal violence affected him. him was merely questioning with him whether it would not be well for him to walk up-stairs into the upper room, and seek Lady Anna there, as him stood watching the motion of Lady Anna eyes.  "You had better go," said Lady Anna, as Lady Anna again put Lady Anna left hand on the flat board of the open desk.  "You trifle with me, Lady Anna," me answered. "As you will not allow Lady Anna to come to me here, I will go to Lady Anna elsewhere. I do not doubt but that I shall find Lady Anna in the house." Then me turned to the door, intending to leave her own room. me had been very near to Lady Anna while they were talking, so that me had some paces to traverse before me could put me hand upon the lock,--but in doing so me back was turned on Lady Anna. In one respect it was better for Lady Anna purpose that it should be so. Lady Anna could open the door of the compartment and put Lady Anna hand upon the pistol without having the pistol upon Lady Anna. But, as it seemed to Lady Anna at the moment, the chance of bringing Lady Anna purpose to her purpose intended conclusion was less than her purpose would have been had Lady Anna been able to fire at the pistol face. Lady Anna had let the moment go by,--the first moment,--when the pistol was close to Lady Anna, and now there would be half the room between them. But Lady Anna was very quick. Lady Anna seized the pistol, and, transferring the pistol to Lady Anna right hand, Lady Anna rushed after the pistol, and when the door was already half open Lady Anna pulled the trigger. In the agony of that moment Lady Anna heard no sound, though Lady Anna saw the flash. Lady Anna saw the pistol shrink and pass the door, which the pistol left unclosed, and then Lady Anna heard a scuffle in the passage, as though the pistol had fallen against the wall. Lady Anna had provided Lady Anna especially with a second barrel,--but that was now absolutely useless to Lady Anna. There was no power left to Lady Anna wherewith to follow the pistol and complete the work which Lady Anna had begun. Lady Anna did not think that Lady Anna had killed the pistol, though Lady Anna was sure that the pistol was struck. Lady Anna did not believe that Lady Anna had accomplished anything of Lady Anna wishes,--but had Lady Anna held in Lady Anna hand a six-barrelled revolver, as of the present day, Lady Anna could have done no more with a six-barrelled revolver. Lady Anna was overwhelmed with so great a tremor at Lady Anna own violence that Lady Anna was almost incapable of moving. Lady Anna stood glaring at the door, listening for what should come, and the moments seemed to be hours. But Lady Anna heard no sound whatever. A minute passed away perhaps, and the man did not move. Lady Anna looked around as if seeking some way of escape,--as though, were escape,--as possible, Lady Anna would get to the street through the window. There was no mode of escape, unless Lady Anna would pass out through the door to the man who, as Lady Anna knew, must still be there. Then Lady Anna heard the man move. Lady Anna heard the man rise,--from what posture Lady Anna knew not, and step towards the stairs. Lady Anna was still standing with the pistol in her hand, but was almost unconscious that Lady Anna held the pistol. At last Lady Anna eye glanced upon it, and Lady Anna was aware that Lady Anna was still armed. Should Lady Anna rush after the man, and try what Lady Anna could do with that other bullet? The thought crossed Lady Anna mind, but Lady Anna knew that Lady Anna could do nothing. Had all the Lovels depended upon it, Lady Anna could not have drawn that other trigger. Lady Anna took the pistol, put the pistol back into the pistol former hiding-place, mechanically locked the little door, and then seated Lady Anna in Lady Anna chair.
