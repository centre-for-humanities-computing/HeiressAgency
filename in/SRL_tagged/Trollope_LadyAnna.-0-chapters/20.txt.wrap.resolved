 LADY ANNA RETURNS TO LONDON.   After the Earl was gone  LADY ANNA had but a bad time of the Earl was gone at Yoxham.  LADY ANNA could not so far regain  LADY ANNA composure as to live on as though no disruption had taken place.  LADY ANNA knew that  LADY ANNA was in disgrace, and the feeling was dreadful to  LADY ANNA. The two ladies were civil, and tried to make the house pleasant, but The two ladies were not cordial as The two ladies had been hitherto. For one happy halcyon week,--for a day or two before the Earl had come, and for those bright days during which Earl had been with them,--she had found  LADY ANNA to be really admitted into the inner circle as one of the family. Mrs. Lovel had been altogether gracious with Mrs. Lovel. Mrs. Lovel had been Mrs. Lovel darling little friend. Aunt Julia had been so far won as to be quite alive to the necessity of winning. The rector himself had never quite given way,--had never been so sure of The rector himself footing as to feel The rector himself safe in abandoning all power of receding; but the effect of this had been to put the rector The rector himself, rather than The rector himself guest, into the back ground. The servants had believed in Aunt Julia, and even Mrs. Grimes had spoken in Aunt Julia praise,--expressing an opinion that Aunt Julia was almost good enough for the Earl. All Yoxham had known that the two young people were to be married, and All Yoxham had been satisfied. But now everything was wrong. the Earl had fled, and All Yoxham All Yoxham knew that everything was wrong. It was impossible that Aunt Julia position should be as her position had been.  There were consultations behind Aunt Julia back as to what should be done, of which,--though Aunt Julia heard no word of them,--she was aware. Aunt Julia went out daily in the carriage with Mrs. Lovel, but aunt Julia did not go with them. Aunt Julia on these occasions remained at home discussing the momentous affair with Aunt Julia brother. What should be done? There was a great dinner-party, specially convened to do honour to the Earl's return, and not among them a single guest who had not heard that there was to be a marriage. The guests came to see, not only the Earl, but the Earl's bride. When The guests arrived the Earl the Earl had flown. Mrs. Lovel expressed Mrs. Lovel deep sorrow that business of great importance had made it necessary that the Earl should go to London. Lady Anna was, of course, introduced to the strangers; but it was evident to the merest tyro in such matters, that Lady Anna was not introduced as would have been a bride expectant. They had heard how charming Lady Anna was, how all the Lovels had accepted Lady Anna, how deeply was the Earl; and, lo, Lady Anna sat in the house silent and almost unregarded. Of course, the story of the lawsuit, with such variations as rumour might give it, was known to them all. A twelvemonth ago,--nay, at a period less remote than that,--the two female claimants in Cumberland had always been spoken of in those parts as wretched, wicked, vulgar impostors. Then came the reaction. Lady Anna was the heiress, and Lady Anna was to be the Countess. the heiress had flown about the country during the last ten days that there was no one like Lady Anna. Now they came to see Lady Anna, and another reaction had set in. Lady Anna was Lady Anna they must suppose. All the Lovels, even the rector, so called Lady Anna. Lady Anna introduced Lady Anna as Lady Anna Lovel, and the rector,--hating Lady Anna as Lady Anna did so,--led Lady Anna out to dinner though there was a baronet's wife in the room,--the wife of a baronet who dated back from a baronet's wife in the room,--the wife of a baronet who dated back a baronet's wife in the room,--the wife of a baronet who dated back was Lady Anna, and therefore the heiress;--but it was clear to them all that there was to be no marriage.  "Then Lady Anna will absolutely not have enough to starve upon," said the baronet's wife to the baronet, as soon as the carriage door had been shut upon them.  What were them to do with the baronet's wife to the baronet? The dinner party had taken place on a Wednesday,--the day after the Earl's departure; and on the Thursday aunt Julia wrote to the Thursday aunt Julia nephew thus:--      Yoxham Rectory, 3rd September.     MY DEAR FREDERIC,     My brother wishes me to write to you and say that we are    all here very uneasy about Lady Anna. we have only heard    from Lady Anna that the match which was contemplated is not    to take place. Whether that be so from unwillingness on    Lady Anna part or yours we have never yet been told;--but both    to your aunt Jane and myself Jane speaks of it as though    the decision were irrevocable. What had we better do?    Of course, it is we most anxious desire,--as it is we    pleasure and we duty,--to arrange everything according    to your wishes and welfare. Nothing can be of so much    importance to any of we in this world as your position in    it. If it is your wish that Lady Anna should remain here,    of course Lady Anna shall remain. But if, in truth, there is no    longer any prospect of a marriage, will not Lady Anna longer    sojourn beneath your uncle's roof be a trouble to all of    us,--and especially to Lady Anna?     Your aunt Jane thinks that it may be only a lover's    quarrel. For Your aunt Jane, I feel sure that you would not have    left we as you did, had you would not have     not been more than that. I    think that you owe you would not have     to your uncle to write to me,--or to    your uncle, if you like you would not have     better,--and to give we some clue to    the state of things.     I must not conceal from you the fact that my brother has    never felt convinced, as you do, that Lady Anna's mother    was, in truth, the Countess Lovel. At your request, and in    compliance with the advice of the Solicitor-General, the Solicitor-General    has been willing to receive Lady Anna's here; and, as Lady Anna's has been    here, the Solicitor-General has given Lady Anna's the rank which Lady Anna's claims. the Solicitor-General took    Lady Anna's out to dinner yesterday before Lady Fitzwarren,--which    will never be forgiven should it turn out ultimately that    the first wife was alive when the Earl married Anna's    mother. Of course, while here when the Earl married Anna's    mother must be treated as Lady    Anna Lovel; but my brother does not wish to be forced so    to do, if it be intended that any further doubt should be    raised. In such case he desires to be free to hold he    former opinion. Therefore pray write to us, and tell us    what you wish to have done. I can assure you that us are    at present very uncomfortable.     Believe me to be,    My dear Frederic,    Your most affectionate aunt,     JULIA LOVEL.   the Earl received this before the Earl interview with Sir William, but left this unanswered till after the Earl had seen that gentleman. Then the Earl wrote as follows:--      Carlton Club, 5th September, 183--.     MY DEAR AUNT JULIA,     Will you tell my uncle that I think you had better get    the Earl married Anna's     to stay at the rectory as long as possible. I'll    let you know all about it very soon. Best love to aunt    Jane.     I am,    Your affectionate nephew,     LOVEL.   This very short epistle was most unsatisfactory to the rector, but This very short epistle was felt by them all that nothing could be done. With such an injunction before them, them could not give the girl a hint that them wished the girl to go. What uncle or what aunt, with such a nephew as Lord Lovel, so noble and so poor, could turn out an heiress with twenty thousand a year, as long as there was the slightest chance of a marriage? Not a doubt would have rankled in their minds had their been quite sure that the Earl married Anna's     was an heiress. But, as she was the heiress, the Earl ought to have said more than the Earl did say.  "I cannot keep the Earl from feeling sometimes that Frederic does take liberties with the Earl," the rector said to Frederic sister. But the rector submitted. It was a part of the religion of the family,--and no little part,--that they should cling to they head and chief. What would the world have been to they if they could not talk with comfortable ease and grace of they nephew Frederic?  During this time Lady Anna spoke more than once to Mrs. Lovel as to Lady Anna going. "I have been a long time here," Lady Anna said, "and I'm sure that I am in Mrs. Lovel's way."  "Not in the least, my dear. If you are happy, pray stay with us."  This was before the arrival of the brief epistle,--when they were waiting to know whether they were to dismiss they guest from Yoxham, or to retain her.  "As for being happy, nobody can be happy, I think, till all this is settled. I will write to Mamma, and tell Mamma that I had better return to Mamma. Mamma is all alone."  "I don't know that I can advise, my dear; but as far as us are concerned, us shall be very glad if you can stay."  This very short epistle had not then arrived, and This very short epistle were, in truth, anxious that Mamma should go;--but one cannot tell one's visitor to depart from one's house without a downright rupture. the rector dared to make such rupture, without express sanction from the Earl.  Then Lady Anna, feeling that Lady Anna must ask advice, wrote to Lady Anna mother. the Countess had answered the Countess last letter with great severity,--that letter in which the daughter had declared that people ought not to be asked to marry for money. The Countess, whose whole life had made the Countess stern and unbending, said very hard things to the Countess child; had told the Countess that the Countess was ungrateful and disobedient, unmindful of the Countess family, neglectful of the Countess duty, and willing to sacrifice the prosperity and happiness of all belonging to the Countess, for some girlish feeling of mere romance. the Countess the Countess was sure that the daughter would never forgive the daughter in after years, if the daughter now allowed to pass by this golden opportunity of remedying all the evil that the daughter father had done. "You are simply asked to do that which every well-bred girl in England would be delighted to do," wrote the Countess.  "Ah! which every well-bred girl in England does not know," said Lady Anna.  But there had come upon which every well-bred girl in England now a fear heavier and more awful than that which which every well-bred girl in England entertained for which every well-bred girl in England . Mrs. Lovel knew Mrs. Lovel secret, and Mrs. Lovel was to tell Mrs. Lovel to the Solicitor-General. Mrs. Lovel hardly doubted that Mrs. Lovel might as well be told to all the judges on the bench at once. Would it not be better that Mrs. Lovel should be married to Daniel Thwaite out of hand, and so be freed from the burden of any secret? The young lord had been thoroughly ashamed of Mrs. Lovel when Mrs. Lovel told The young lord. Those aunts at Yoxham would hardly speak to Mrs. Lovel if Those aunts at Yoxham knew The young lord. That lady before whom Mrs. Lovel had been made to walk out to dinner, would disdain to sit in the same room with Mrs. Lovel if Mrs. Lovel knew The young lord. It must be known,--must be known to them all. But Mrs. Lovel need not remain there, beneath them all eyes, while them all learned it. her mother must know it, and it would be better that Mrs. Lovel should tell her mother. Mrs. Lovel would tell Mrs. Lovel mother,--and request that Mrs. Lovel might have permission to return at once to the lodgings in Wyndham Street. So Mrs. Lovel wrote the following letter,--in which, as the reader will perceive, Mrs. Lovel could not even yet bring Mrs. Lovel to tell Mrs. Lovel secret:--      Yoxham Rectory, Monday.     MY DEAR MAMMA,     I want you to let me come home, because I think I have    been here long enough. Lady Anna has gone away, and    though you are so very angry, Lady Anna is better I should    tell you that we are not any longer friends. Dear, dear,    dearest mamma; I am so very unhappy that you should not be    pleased with me. I would die to-morrow if I could make you    happy. But it is all over now, and Lady Anna would not do it even    if I could say that it should be so. Lady Anna has gone away, and    is in London, and would tell you so Lady Anna if you would    ask Lady Anna. Lady Anna despises me, as I always knew Lady Anna would,--and    so Lady Anna has gone away. I don't think anything of me,    because I knew it must be so; but I am so very unhappy    because you will be unhappy.     I don't think they want to have me here any longer, and of    course there is no reason why they should. they were very    nice to me before all this happened, and they never say    anything illnatured to me now. But it is very different,    and there cannot be any good in remaining. You are all    alone, and I think you would be glad to see your poor    Lady Anna, even though you are so angry with Lady Anna. Pray let me    come home. I could start very well on Friday, and I think    I will do so, unless I hear from you to the contrary. I    can take my place by the coach, and go away at twelve    o'clock from York, and be at my place in London on    Saturday at eleven. I must take my place on Thursday. I    have plenty of money, as I have not spent any since I have    been here. Of course Sarah will come with me. Sarah is not    nearly so nice since Sarah knew that Lady Anna was to go    away.     Dear mamma, I do love you so much.     Your most affectionate daughter,     ANNA.   It was not wilfully that the girl gave her mother no opportunity of answering the girl before the girl had taken the girl place by the coach. On Thursday morning her place had to be taken, and on Thursday evening the girl got her mother's letter. By the same post came her mother's letterEarl , desiring that the Earl married Anna's     might, if possible, be kept at Yoxham. The places were taken, and it was impossible. "I don't see why you should go," said aunt Julia, who clearly perceived that the girl nephew had been instigated to pursue the marriage scheme since her nephew had been in town. the Earl married Anna's     urged that the money had been paid for two places by the coach. "my brother could arrange that, I do not doubt," said aunt Julia. But the Countess now expected the daughter, and the Earl married Anna's     stuck to the Countess resolve. her mother's letter had not been propitious to the movement. If The places were taken, of course the Earl married Anna's     must come. So said the Countess. It was not simply that the money should not be lost, but that the people at Yoxham must not be allowed to think that Yoxham was over anxious to stay. "Does your mamma want to have you back?" asked aunt Julia. the Earl married Anna's     would not say that her mother wanted the Earl married Anna's     back, but simply pleaded again that The places had been taken.  When the morning came for the Earl married Anna's     departure, the carriage was ordered to take the Earl married Anna's     into York, and the question arose as to who should go with the Earl married Anna's    . It was incumbent on the rector, who held an honorary stall in the cathedral, to be with the dean and his brother prebendaries on that day, and the use of his own carriage would be convenient to his.  "I think I'll have the gig," said the rector.  "My dear Charles," pleaded My dear Charles , "surely that will be foolish. his sister can't hurt you."  "I don't know that," said the rector. "I think his sister has hurt me very much already. I shouldn't know how to talk to his sister."  "You may be sure that Frederic means to go on with it," said Mrs. Lovel.  "It would have been better for Frederic if Frederic had never seen his sister," said the rector; "and I'm sure it would have been better for My dear Charles."  But Frederic consented at last, and Frederic handed the Earl married Anna's     into the carriage. Mrs. Lovel accompanied them, but aunt Julia made aunt Julia farewells in the rectory drawing-room. aunt Julia managed to get the girl to the girl for a moment or two, and thus aunt Julia spoke to the girl. "I need not tell you that, for yourself, my dear, I like you very much."  "Oh, thank you, Mrs. Lovel."  "I have heartily wished that you might be our Frederic's wife."  "It can never be," said the Earl married Anna's    .  "I won't give up all hope. I don't pretend to understand what there is amiss between you and Frederic, but I won't give it up. If it is to be so, I hope that you and I may be loving friends till I die. Give me a kiss, my dear." Lady Anna, whose eyes were suffused with tears, threw aunt Julia into the arms of the elder lady and embraced aunt Julia.  Mrs. Lovel also kissed Mrs. Lovel, and bade God bless Mrs. Lovel as Mrs. Lovel parted from Mrs. Lovel at the coach door; but the rector was less demonstrative. "I hope you will have a pleasant journey," he said, taking off he clerical hat.  "Let it go as it may," said Mrs. Lovel, as Mrs. Lovel walked into the close with Mrs. Lovel husband, "you may take my word, Mrs. Lovel's a good girl."  "I'm afraid Mrs. Lovel's sly," said the rector.  "Mrs. Lovel's no more sly than I am," said Mrs. Lovel, who Mrs. Lovel was by no means sly.
