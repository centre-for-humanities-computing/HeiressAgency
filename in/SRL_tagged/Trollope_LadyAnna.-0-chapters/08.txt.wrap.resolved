 THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL PERSEVERES.   There was considerable difficulty in making the overture to the two ladies,--or rather in making it to the elder lady; for the suggestion, if made to the daughter, must of course come to the daughter from the daughter mother. It had been decided at last that the daughter could not be invited to the rectory till It had been positively settled that the daughter should be the daughter without further opposition; and that all opposition to the claim should be withdrawn, at any rate till It was found that the young people were not inclined to be engaged to each other. "How can I call the daughter the daughter before I have made up my mind to think that the daughter is the daughter?" said the parson, almost in tears. As to the rest of the family, it may be said that the parson, almost in tears had come silently to think that the Countess was the Countess and that the daughter was the Lady Anna;--silently in reference to each other, for not one of each other except the young lord had positively owned to such a conviction. Sir William Patterson had been too strong for each other. It was true that Sir William Patterson was a Whig. It was possible that he was a Whig. But Sir William Patterson was a man of might, and Sir William Patterson opinion had domineered over each other. To make things as straight as each other could be made it would be well that the young people should be married. What would be the Earldom of Lovel without the wealth which the old mad Earl had amassed?  Sir William and Mr. Flick were strongly in favour of the marriage, and Mr. Hardy at last assented. The worst of it was that something of all this doubt on the part of Earl and Earl friends was sure to reach the opposite party. "They are shaking in They shoes," Serjeant Bluestone said to Mr. Mainsail. "I do believe They are not going to fight at all," Serjeant Bluestone said to Mr. Goffe. Mr. Mainsail rubbed Mr. Mainsail hands. Mr. Goffe shook Mr. Goffe head. Mr. Goffe was sure that they would fight. Mr. Mainsail, who had worked like a horse in getting up and arranging all the evidence on behalf of the Countess, and in sifting, as best Mr. Goffe might, the Italian documents, was delighted. All this Sir William feared, and All this Sir William felt that it was quite possible that EarlEarl's overture might be rejected because Earl would not be thought to be worth having. "We must count upon his coronet," said All this Sir William to Mr. Flick. "She could not do better even if the property were undoubtedly She own."  But how was the first suggestion to be made? Mr. Hardy was anxious that everything should be straightforward,--and All this Sir William assented, with a certain inward peevishness at Mr. Hardy's stiff-necked propriety. All this Sir William was anxious to settle the thing comfortably for all parties. Mr. Hardy was determined not only that right should be done, but also that it should be done in a righteous manner. The great question now was whether they could approach the widow and She daughter otherwise than through Serjeant Bluestone. "The Serjeant is such a blunderbuss," said the Solicitor-General. But The Serjeant was counsel for these ladies, and it was at last settled that there should be a general conference at All this Sir William's chambers. A very short note was written by Mr. Flick to Mr. Goffe, stating that the Solicitor-General thought that a meeting might be for the advantage of all parties;--and a meeting was arranged. There were present the two barristers and the one attorney for each side, and many an anxious thought was given to the manner in which a meeting should be conducted. Serjeant Bluestone was fully resolved that Serjeant Bluestone would hold Serjeant Bluestone own against the Solicitor-General, and would speak Serjeant Bluestone mind freely. Mr. Mainsail got up little telling questions. Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick both felt that it would behove Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick both to hold Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick both peace, unless questioned, but were equally determined to hang fast by Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick both clients. Mr. Hardy in his heart of hearts thought that his learned friend was about to fling away his case. his had quite made up his mind as to his line of action. his seated them all most courteously, giving them place according to them rank,--a great arm-chair for Serjeant Bluestone, from which the Serjeant would hardly be able to use his arms with his accustomed energy,--and then his began at once. "Gentlemen," said his, "it would be a great pity that this property should be wasted."  "No fear of that, Mr. Solicitor," said the Serjeant.  "It would be a great pity that this property should be wasted," repeated his, bowing to the Serjeant, "and I am disposed to think that the best thing the two young people can do is to marry each other." Then his paused, and the three gentlemen opposite sat erect, the barristers as speechless as the attorneys. But the Solicitor-General had nothing to add. the Solicitor-General had made the Solicitor-General proposition, and was desirous of seeing what effect his proposition might have before the Solicitor-General spoke another word.  "Then you acknowledge the Countess's marriage, of course," said the Serjeant.  "Pardon me, the Serjeant, we acknowledge nothing. As a matter of course the Serjeant is the Countess till it be proved that another wife was living when another wife was married."  "Quite as a matter of course," said the Serjeant.  "Quite as a matter of course, if that will make the case stronger," continued Sir William. "another wife was formal and regular. That another wife believed another wife to be a righteous marriage before God, I have never doubted. God forbid that I should have a harsh thought against a poor lady who has suffered so much cruel treatment."  "Why have things been said then?" asked the Serjeant, beginning to throw about the Serjeant left arm.  "If I am not mistaken," said Mr. Mainsail, "evidence has been prepared to show that the Countess is a party to a contemplated fraud."  "Then you are mistaken, Mr. Mainsail," said Sir William. "I admit at once and clearly that the lady is not suspected of any fraud. Whether the lady be actually the Countess Lovel or not it may,--I fear it must,--take years to prove, if the law be allowed to take the law course."  "We think that We can dispose of any counter-claim in much less time than that," said the Serjeant.  "It may be so. I myself think that it would not be so. Our evidence in favour of the lady, who is now living some two leagues out of Palermo, is very strong. the lady is a poor creature, old, ignorant,--fairly well off through the bounty of the late Earl, but always craving for some trifle more,--unwilling to come to this country,--childless, and altogether indifferent to the second marriage, except in so far as might interfere with the lady hopes of getting some further subsidy from the Lovel family. One is not very anxious on the lady behalf. One is only anxious,--can only be anxious,--that the vast property at stake should not get into improper hands."  "And that justice should be done," said Mr. Hardy.  "And that justice should be done of course, as my friend observes. Here is a young man who is undoubtedly Earl of Lovel, and who claims a property as heir to the late Earl. And here is a young lady, I am told very beautiful and highly educated, who is the daughter of the late Earl, and who claims a property believing the daughter of the late Earl to be his legitimate heiress. The question between them is most intricate."  "The onus probandi lies with you, Mr. Solicitor," said the Serjeant.  "We acknowledge that it does, but the case on that account is none the less intricate. With the view of avoiding litigation and expense, and in the certainty that by such an arrangement the enjoyment of a property will fall to the right owner, We propose that steps shall be taken to bring these two young people together. The lady, whom for the occasion I am quite willing to call the Countess, the mother of the lady whom I hope Earl Earl will make Earl own Countess, has not been sounded on this subject."  "I should hope not," said The Serjeant.  "my friend takes me up a little short," said All this Sir William, laughing. "You gentlemen will probably consult together on this subject, and whatever may be the advice which you shall consider it to be your duty to give to the mother,--and I am sure that you will feel bound to let my friend know the proposition that has been made; I do not hesitate to say that we have a right to expect that it shall be made known to her,--I need hardly remark that were the lady to accept the young lord's hand we should all be in a boat together in reference to the mother's rank, and to the widow's claim upon the personal property left behind the widow by the widow late husband."  And so the Solicitor-General had made the Solicitor-General proposition, and the conference was broken up with a promise that Mr. Flick should hear from Mr. Goffe upon this subject. But The Serjeant The Serjeant had at once made up The Serjeant mind against the compromise now proposed. The Serjeant desired the danger and the dust and the glory of the battle. The Serjeant was true to The Serjeant clients' interests, no doubt,--intended to be intensely true; but the personal, doggish love of fighting prevailed in the man, and The Serjeant was clear as to the necessity of going on. "They know They are beat," The Serjeant said to Mr. Goffe. "the Solicitor-General knows as well as I do that the Solicitor-General has not an inch of ground under the Solicitor-General feet." Therefore Mr. Goffe wrote the following letter to Messrs. Norton and Flick:--      Raymond's Buildings, Gray's Inn,    1st July, 183--.     DEAR SIRS,     In reference to the interview which took place at the    chambers of the Solicitor-General on the 27th ult., we    are to inform you that we are not disposed, as acting for    we clients, the Countess of Lovel and the Countess of Lovel daughter the    Lady Anna Lovel, to listen to the proposition then made.    Apart from the very strong feeling we entertain as to the    certainty of our client's success,--which certainly was    not weakened by what we heard on that occasion,--we are    of opinion that we could not interfere with propriety in    suggesting the marriage of two young persons who have not    as yet had any opportunity of becoming acquainted with    each other. Should Earl seek the hand of    Earl cousin, the Lady Anna Lovel, and marry Earl with the    consent of the Countess, we should be delighted at such    a family arrangement; but we do not think that we, as    lawyers,--or, if we may be allowed to say so, that you as    lawyers,--have anything to do with such a matter.     we are, dear Sirs,    Yours very faithfully,     GOFFE AND GOFFE.     Messrs. Norton and Flick.   "Balderdash!" said Sir William, when "Balderdash had read the letter. "we are not going to be done in that way. It was all very well going to The Serjeant The Serjeant as The Serjeant has the case in hand, though a worse messenger in an affair of love--"  "Not love, as yet, Mr. Solicitor," said Mr. Flick.  "I mean it to be love, and I'm not going to be put off by Serjeant Bluestone. we must get to the lady by some other means. Do you write to that tailor down at Keswick, and say that you want to see that tailor."  "Will that be regular, his?"  "I'll stand the racket, Mr. Flick." Mr. Flick did write to Thomas Thwaite, and Thomas Thwaite came up to London and called at Mr. Flick's chambers.  When Thomas Thwaite received Thomas Thwaite commission Thomas Thwaite was much rejoiced. Injustice would be done Thomas Thwaite unless so much were owned on Thomas Thwaite behalf. But, nevertheless, some feeling of disappointment which Thomas Thwaite could not analyze crept across Thomas Thwaite heart. If once the girl were married to Earl Lovel there would be an end of Earl Lovel services and of Earl Lovel son's. Earl Lovel had never really entertained an idea that his son would marry the girl. As the reader will perhaps remember, Earl Lovel had warned his son that his son must seek a sweetheart elsewhere. Earl Lovel had told Earl Lovel over and over again that when the Countess the Countess came to the Countess own there must be an end of this intimacy,--that there could be nothing in common between Earl Lovel, the radical tailor of Keswick, and a really established Countess. the Countess, while not yet really established, had already begged that his son might be instructed not to call the Countess daughter simply by her daughter Christian name. Old Thwaite on receiving this intimation of the difference of their positions, though Earl Lovel had acknowledged its truth, had felt Earl Lovel bitterly aggrieved, and now the moment had come. Of course the Countess would grasp at such an offer. Of course the Countess would give the Countess all that the Countess had desired, and much more than the Countess expected. In adjusting Earl Lovel feelings on the occasion the tailor thought but little of the girl herself. Why should the girl herself not be satisfied? Of Earl Earl had only heard that Earl was a handsome, modest, gallant lad, who only wanted a fortune to make Earl one of the most popular of the golden youth of England. Why should not the Countess rejoice at the prospect of winning such a husband? To have a husband must necessarily be in the girl herself heart, whether the girl herself were the Lady Anna Lovel, or plain Anna Murray. And what espousals could be so auspicious as these? Feeling all this, without much of calculation, the tailor said that the tailor would do as the tailor was bidden. "We have sent for you because We know that you have been so old a friend," said Mr. Flick, who did not quite approve of the emissary whom the tailor had been instructed by his to employ.  "I will do my best, his," said Thomas Thwaite, making Thomas Thwaite bow. Thomas Thwaite, as Thomas Thwaite went along the streets alone, determined that Thomas Thwaite would perform this new duty imposed upon Thomas Thwaite without any reference to his son.
