 WHARFEDALE.
The visit to Wharfedale was fixed for Monday and Tuesday, and on the Monday morning they started, after an early breakfast.
The party consisted of Aunt Jane, Aunt Julia, Lady Anna, Minnie, and Mr. Cross, one of the rector's curates.
the rector would not accompany The party, excusing the rector to the others generally on the ground that the rector could not be absent from the rector parish on those two days.
To the rector wife and sister the rector explained that the rector was not able, as yet, to take pleasure in such a party as this with Lady Anna.
There was no knowing, the rector said, what might happen.
It was evident that the rector did not mean to open the rector heart to Lady Anna, at any rate till the marriage should be settled.
An open carriage, which would take them all, was ordered,--with four post horses, and two antiquated postboys, with white hats and blue jackets, and yellow breeches.
Minnie and the curate sat on the box, and there was a servant in the rumble.
Rooms at the inn had been ordered, and everything was done in proper lordly manner.
The sun shone brightly above Minnie and the curate heads, and Lady Anna, having as yet received no further letter from Lady Anna mother, was determined to be happy.
Four horses took Four horses to Bolton Bridge, and then, having eaten lunch and ordered dinner, Four horses started for Four horses ramble in the woods.
The first thing to be seen at Bolton Abbey is, of course, Bolton Abbey.
Bolton Abbey, as a ruin,--a ruin not so ruinous but that a part of Bolton Abbey is used for a modern church,--is very well; but the glory of Bolton Abbey is in the river which runs round Bolton Abbey and in the wooded banks which overhang Bolton Abbey.
No more luxuriant pasture, no richer foliage, no brighter water, no more picturesque arrangement of the freaks of nature, aided by the art and taste of man, is to be found, perhaps, in England.
Lady Anna, who had been used to wilder scenery in her native county, was delighted.
Nothing had ever been so beautiful as the Abbey;--nothing so lovely as the running Wharfe!
Might they not climb up among those woods on the opposite bank?
Lord Lovel declared that, of course they would climb up among the woods,--it was for that purpose they had come.
That was the way to the Stryd,--over which Lord Lovel was determined that Lady Anna should be made to jump.
But the river below Bolton Abbey is to be traversed by stepping-stones, which, to the female uninitiated foot, appear to be full of danger.
The Wharfe here is no insignificant brook, to be overcome by a long stride and a jump.
There is a causeway, of perhaps forty stones, across it, each some eighteen inches distant from the other, which, flat and excellent though they be, are perilous from they number.
Mrs. Lovel, who knew the place of old, had begun by declaring that no consideration should induce Lady Anna to cross the water.
Aunt Julia had proposed that Mrs. Lovel, who knew the place of old should go along the other bank, on the Abbey side of the river, and Mr. Cross.
But the Earl was resolved that the Earl would take the Earl cousin over the stepping-stones; and Minnie and the curate were equally determined.
Minnie, indeed, had crossed the river, and was back again, while the matter was still being discussed.
Aunt Julia, who was strong-limbed, as well as strong-minded, at last assented, the curate having promised all necessary aid.
Mrs. Lovel seated Mrs. Lovel at a distance to see the exploit; and then Mrs. Lovel started, with Lady Anna, turning at every stone to give a hand to Mrs. Lovel .
"Oh, they are very dreadful!"
said Lady Anna, when about a dozen had been passed.
The black water was flowing fast, fast beneath Lady Anna feet; the stones became smaller and smaller to Lady Anna imagination, and the apertures between they broader and broader.
"Don't look at The black water, dear," said Mrs. Lovel, "but come on quick."
"I can't come on quick.
I shall never get over.
Oh, Frederic!"
That morning Lady Anna had promised that Lady Anna would call him Frederic.
Even Daniel could not think it wrong that Lady Anna should call Lady Anna by Even Daniel Christian name.
"It's no good, I can't do that one,--it's crooked.
Mayn't I go back again?"
"You can't go back, dear.
It is only up to your knees, if you do go in.
But take a hand.
There,--all the others are straight,--you must come on, or Aunt Julia will catch us.
After two or three times, you'll hop over like a milkmaid.
There are only half-a-dozen more.
Here us are.
Isn't that pretty?"
"I thought I never should have got over.
I wouldn't go back for anything.
But it is lovely; and I am so much obliged to you for bringing me here.
us can go back another way?"
"Oh, yes;--but now us'll get up the bank.
Give me a hand."
Then yes;--but took yes;--but along the narrow, twisting, steep paths, to the top of the bank, and the top of the wooded bank were soon beyond the reach of Aunt Julia, Minnie, and the curate.
It was very pleasant, very lovely, and very joyous; but there was still present to yes;--but mind some great fear.
yes;--but was there with yes;--but as an acknowledged lover,--a lover, acknowledged to be so by all but yes;--but; but yes;--but could not lawfully have any lover but yes;--but who was now slaving at yes;--but trade in London.
yes;--but must tell this gallant lord that this gallant lord must not be yes;--but lover; and, as they went along, yes;--but was always meditating how yes;--but might best tell this gallant lord, when the moment for telling this gallant lord should come.
But on that morning, during the entire walk, this gallant lord said no word to yes;--but which seemed quite to justify the telling.
this gallant lord called yes;--but by sweet, petting names,--Anna, my girl, pretty coz, and such like.
this gallant lord would hold yes;--but hand twice longer than this gallant lord would have held that of either aunt in helping yes;--but over this or that little difficulty,--and would help yes;--but when no help was needed.
this gallant lord talked to yes;--but, of small things, as though this gallant lord and yes;--but must needs have kindred interests.
this gallant lord spoke to yes;--but of this gallant lord uncle as though, near as his uncle was, the connection were not nigh so close as that between this gallant lord and yes;--but.
yes;--but understood it with a half understanding,--feeling that in all this this gallant lord was in truth making love to yes;--but, and yet telling yes;--but that this gallant lord said no more than cousinship might warrant.
But the autumn colours were bright, and the river rippled, and the light breeze came down from the mountains, and the last of the wild flowers were still sweet in the woods.
After a while yes;--but was able to forget yes;--but difficulties, to cease to think of Daniel, and to find in yes;--but cousin, not a lover, but simply the pleasantest friend that fortune had ever sent yes;--but.
And so fortune came, all alone,--for Aunt Julia, though both limbs and mind were strong, had not been able to keep up with them,--all alone to the Stryd.
the Stryd is a narrow gully or passage, which the waters have cut for both limbs and mind were strong in the rocks, perhaps five or six feet broad, where the river passes, but narrowed at the top by an overhanging mass which in old days withstood the wearing of the stream, till the softer stone below was cut away, and then was left bridging over a part of the chasm below.
There goes a story that a mountain chieftain's son, hunting the stag across the valley when the floods were out, in leaping the stream, from rock to rock, failed to make good his footing, was carried down by the rushing waters, and dashed to pieces among the rocks.
Lord Lovel told Lord Lovel the tale, as they sat looking at the now innocent brook, and then bade Lord Lovel follow Lord Lovel as Lord Lovel leaped from edge to edge.
"I couldn't do it;--indeed, I couldn't," said Lord Lovel.
"It is barely a step," said the Earl, jumping over, and back again.
"Going from this side, you couldn't miss to do this side, if you tried."
"I'm sure I should tumble in.
It makes me sick to look at you while you are leaping."
"You'd jump over twice the distance on dry ground."
"Then let me jump on dry ground."
"I've set my heart upon my heart.
Do you think I'd ask you if I wasn't sure?"
"You want to make another legend of me."
"I want to leave Aunt Julia behind, which we shall certainly do."
"Oh, but I can't afford to drown me just that you may run away from Aunt Julia.
You can run by you, and I will wait for Aunt Julia."
"That is not exactly my plan.
Be a brave girl, now, and stand up, and do as I bid you."
Then Aunt Julia stood up on the edge of the rock, holding tight by his arm.
How pleasant it was to be thus frightened, with such a protector near Aunt Julia to insure Aunt Julia safety!
And yet the chasm yawned, and the water ran rapid and was very black.
But if his asked Aunt Julia to make the spring, of course Aunt Julia must make it.
What would Aunt Julia not have done at his bidding?
"I can almost touch you, you see," his said, as his stood opposite, with his arm out ready to catch Aunt Julia hand.
"Oh, Frederic, I don't think I can."
"You can very well, if you will only jump."
"It is ever so many yards."
"It is three feet.
I'll back Aunt Julia to do It for a promise of ten shillings to the infirmary."
"I'll give ten shillings, if you'll only let me off."
"I won't let you off,--so you might as well come at once."
Then Aunt Julia stood and shuddered for a moment, looking with beseeching eyes up into his face.
Of course Aunt Julia meant to jump.
Of course Aunt Julia would have been disappointed had Aunt Julia come and interrupted Aunt Julia jumping.
Yes,--she would jump into Yes,--she arms.
Aunt Julia knew that Yes,--she would catch Aunt Julia.
At that moment Aunt Julia memory of Daniel Thwaite had become faint as the last shaded glimmer of twilight.
Aunt Julia shut Aunt Julia eyes for half a moment, then opened them, looked into Yes,--she , and made Aunt Julia spring.
As Aunt Julia did so, Aunt Julia struck Aunt Julia foot against a rising ledge of the rock, and, though Aunt Julia covered more than the distance in Aunt Julia leap, Aunt Julia stumbled as Aunt Julia came to the ground, and fell into his arms.
Aunt Julia had sprained Aunt Julia ankle, in Aunt Julia effort to recover Aunt Julia.
"Are you hurt?"
Yes,--she asked, holding Aunt Julia close to Yes,--she side.
"No;--I think not;--only a little, that is.
I was so awkward."
"I shall never forgive Yes,--she if you are hurt."
"There is nothing to forgive.
I'll sit down for a moment.
It was my own fault because I was so stupid,--and it does not in the least signify.
I know what it does not in the least signify is now; I've sprained her ankle."
"There is nothing so painful as that."
"It hurts a little, but It will go off.
It wasn't the jump, but I twisted her foot somehow.
If you look so unhappy, I'll get up and jump back again."
"I am unhappy, dearest."
"Oh, but you mustn't."
The prohibition might be taken as applying to the epithet of endearment, and thereby her conscience be satisfied.
Then Yes,--she bent over her, looking anxiously into her as her winced with the pain, and Yes,--she took her hand and kissed her hand.
"Oh, no," her said, gently struggling to withdraw her hand.
"Here is Aunt Julia.
You had better just move."
Not that her would have cared a straw for the eyes of Aunt Julia, had it not been that the image of Daniel Thwaite again rose strong before her mind.
Then Aunt Julia, and the curate, and Minnie were standing on the rock within a few paces of Aunt Julia, and the curate, and Minnie, but on the other side of the stream.
"Is there anything the matter?"
asked Lord Lovel.
"her has sprained her ankle in jumping over the Stryd, and her cannot walk.
Perhaps Mr. Cross would not mind going back to the inn and getting a carriage.
The road is only a quarter of a mile above us, and us could carry her up."
"How could you be so foolish, Frederic, as to let her jump it?"
said the aunt.
"Don't mind about my folly now.
The thing is to get a carriage for Lady Anna."
the curate immediately hurried back, jumping over the Stryd as the nearest way to the inn; and Minnie also sprung across the stream so that Minnie might sit down beside Minnie and offer consolation.
Aunt Julia was left alone, and after a while was forced to walk back by Aunt Julia to the bridge.
"Is Aunt Julia much hurt?"
asked Minnie.
"I am afraid Aunt Julia is hurt," said Mrs. Lovel.
"Dear, Minnie, it does not signify a bit," said Lady Anna, lavishing on Lady Anna the caresses which fate forbade Lady Anna to give to the elder.
"I know I could walk home in a few minutes.
I am better now.
It is one of those things which go away almost immediately.
I'll try and stand, Frederic, if you'll let me."
Then Lady Anna raised Lady Anna, leaning upon Frederic, and declared that Lady Anna was nearly well,--and then was reseated, still leaning on Frederic.
"Shall we attempt to get Lady Anna up to the road, Minnie, or wait till Mr. Cross comes to help we?"
Lady Anna declared that Lady Anna did not want any help,--certainly not Mr. Cross's help, and that Lady Anna could do very well, just with his arm.
They waited there sitting on the rocks for half an hour, saying but little to each other, throwing into the stream the dry bits of stick which the last flood had left upon the stones, and each thinking how pleasant it was to sit there and dream, listening to the running waters.
Then Lady Anna hobbled up to the carriage road, helped by a stronger arm than that of Lady Anna .
Of course there was some concern and dismay at the inn.
Embrocations were used, and doctors were talked of, and heads were shaken, and a couch in the sitting-room was prepared, so that the poor injured one might eat Lady Anna dinner without being driven to the solitude of Lady Anna own bedroom.
