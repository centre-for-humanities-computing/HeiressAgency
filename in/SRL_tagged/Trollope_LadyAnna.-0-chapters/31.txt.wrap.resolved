 DANIEL THWAITE ALONE.   There were two persons in the court who heard the statement of the Solicitor-General with equal interest,--and perhaps with equal disapprobation,--whose motives and ideas on the subject were exactly opposite. These two were the Rev. Mr. Lovel, the uncle of the plaintiff, and Daniel Thwaite, the tailor, whose whole life had been passed in furthering the cause of the defendants. The parson, from the moment in which The parson had heard that the young lady whom The parson had entertained in The parson house had engaged the young lady whom he had entertained in his house to marry the tailor, had reverted to The parson old suspicions,--suspicions which, indeed, The parson had never altogether laid aside. It had been very grievous to The parson to prefer a doubtful Lady Anna to a most indubitable Lady Fitzwarren. The parson liked the old-established things,--things which had always been unsuspected, which were not only respectable but firm-rooted. For twenty years The parson had been certain that the Countess was a false countess; and the Countess, too, had lamented with deep inward lamentation over the loss of the wealth which ought to have gone to support the family earldom. It was monstrous to The parson that the property of one Earl Lovel should not appertain to the next Earl. the property of one Earl Lovel should not appertain to the next Earl would on the moment have had the laws with reference to the succession of personal property altered, with retrospective action, so that so great an iniquity should be impossible. When the case against the Countess was, as the case against the so-called Countess were, abandoned by the Solicitor-General, and the great interests at stake thrown up, the property of one Earl Lovel should not appertain to the next Earl would have put the conduct of the matter into other hands. Then had come upon the property of one Earl Lovel should not appertain to the next Earl the bitterness of having to entertain in the property of one Earl Lovel should not appertain to the next Earl own house the now almost undisputed,--though by the property of one Earl Lovel should not appertain to the next Earl still suspected,--heiress, on behalf of the property of one Earl Lovel should not appertain to the next Earl nephew, of a nephew who did not treat the property of one Earl Lovel should not appertain to the next Earl well. And now the heiress had shown what the heiress really was by declaring the heiress intention of marrying a tailor! When that became known, a tailor did hope that the Solicitor-General would change the Solicitor-General purpose and fight the cause.  The ladies of the family, the two aunts, had affected to disbelieve the paragraph which Lady Fitzwarren had shown The ladies of the family, the two aunts with so much triumph. The rector had declared that it was just the kind of thing that The rector had expected. Aunt Julia, speaking freely, had said that it was just the kind of thing which Aunt Julia, knowing the girl, could not believe. Then The rector had come up to town to hear the trial, and on the day preceding The rector had asked The rector as to the truth of the rumour which had reached a nephew who did not treat him well. "It is true," said The rector, knitting The rector brow, "but it had better not be talked about."  "Why not talked about? All the world knows it. it has been in the newspapers."  "Any one wishing to oblige me will not mention it," said the Earl. This was too bad. This could not be possible,--for the honour of all the Lovels This could not surely be possible,--that The rector was still seeking the hand of a young woman who had confessed that she was engaged to marry a journeyman tailor! And yet to The rector, the uncle,--to The rector who had not long since been in loco parentis to The rector would vouchsafe no further reply than that above given! The rector almost made The rector believe that, great as might be the sorrow caused by such disruption, it would become The rector duty to quarrel with the Head of The rector family!  The rector listened with most attentive ears to every word spoken by the Solicitor-General, and quarrelled with almost every word. Would not any one have imagined that this advocate had been paid to plead the cause, not of the Earl, but of the Countess? As regarded the interests of the Earl, everything was surrendered. Appeal was made for the sympathies of all the court,--and, through the newspapers, for the sympathies of all England,--not on behalf of the Earl who was being defrauded of the Earl rights, but on behalf of the young woman who had disgraced the name which Appeal pretended to call Appeal own,--and whose only refuge from that disgrace must be in the fact that to that name Appeal had no righteous claim! Even when this apostate barrister came to a recapitulation of the property at stake, and explained the cause of this apostate barrister being vested, not in land as is now the case with the bulk of the possessions of noble lords,--but in shares and funds and ventures of commercial speculation here and there, after the fashion of tradesmen,--he said not a word to stir up in the minds of the jury a feeling of the injury which had been done to the Earl. "Only that I am told that he has a wife of he own I should think that he meant to marry one of the women himself," said the indignant rector in the letter which he wrote to he sister Julia.  And the tailor was as indignant as the rector. he was summoned as a witness and was therefore bound to attend,--at the loss of he day's work. When he reached the court, which he did long before the judge had taken he seat, he found it to be almost impossible to effect an entrance. he gave he name to some officer about the place, but learned that his name was altogether unknown. he showed he subpoena and was told that he must wait till he was called. "Where must I wait?" asked the angry radical. "Anywhere," said the man in authority; "but you can't force your way in here." Then he remembered that no one had as yet paid so dearly for this struggle, no one had suffered so much, no one had been so instrumental in bringing the truth to light, as he, and this was the way in which he was treated! Had there been any justice in those concerned a seat would have been provided for he in the court, even though he attendance had not been required. There were hundreds there, brought thither by simple curiosity, to whom priority of entrance into the court had been accorded by favour, because the court were wealthy, or because the court were men of rank, or because the court had friends high in office. All his wealth had been expended in this case; it was his who had been the most constant friend of this Countess; but for his and his father there might probably have been no question of a trial at this day. And yet his was allowed to beg for admittance, and to be shoved out of court because his had no friends. "the court is a public court, and is open to the public," his said, as his thrust his shoulders forward with a resolution that his would effect an entrance. Then his was taken in hand by two constables and pushed back through the doorway,--to the great detriment of the apple-woman who sat there in those days.  But by pluck and resolution his succeeded in making good some inch of standing room within the court before the Solicitor-General began the Solicitor-General statement, and the Solicitor-General was able to hear every word that was said. his statement was not more pleasing to the Solicitor-General than to the rector of Yoxham. the Solicitor-General first quarrel was with the assertion that titles of nobility are in England the outward emblem of noble conduct. No words that might have been uttered could have been more directly antagonistic to the Solicitor-General feelings and political creed. It had been the accident of the Solicitor-General life that the Solicitor-General should have been concerned with ladies who were noble by marriage and birth, and that it had become a duty to the Solicitor-General to help to claim on their behalf empty names which were in their odious to the Solicitor-General. It had been the woman's right to be acknowledged as the wife of the man who had disowned the woman, and the girl's right to be known as the man who had disowned her legitimate daughter. Therefore had the man who had disowned her been concerned. But the man who had disowned her had declared to the man who had disowned her, from the man who had disowned her first crude conception of an opinion on the subject, that it would be hard to touch pitch and not be defiled. The lords of whom the man who had disowned her heard were, or were believed by the man who had disowned her to be, bloated with luxury, were both rich and idle, were gamblers, debauchers of other men's wives, deniers of all rights of citizenship, drones who were positively authorised to eat the honey collected by the working bees. With the man who had disowned her half-knowledge, the man who had disowned her ill-gotten and ill-digested information, with the man who had disowned her reading which had all been on one side, the man who had disowned her had been unable as yet to catch a glimpse of the fact that from the ranks of the nobility are taken the greater proportion of the hardworking servants of the State. the man who had disowned her eyes saw merely the power, the privileges, the titles, the ribbons, and the money;--and the man who had disowned her hated a lord. When therefore the Solicitor-General spoke of the recognised virtue of titles in England, the tailor uttered words of scorn to the tailor stranger neighbour. "And yet the tailor calls the tailor a Liberal, and voted for the Reform Bill," the tailor said. "In course the tailor did," replied the stranger; "that was the way of the tailor party." "There isn't an honest man among them all," said the tailor to the tailor. This was at the beginning of the speech, and the tailor listened on through five long hours, not losing a word of the argument, not missing a single point made in favour of the Countess and her daughter. It became clear to the tailor at any rate that her daughter would inherit the money. When the Solicitor-General came to speak of the nature of the evidence collected in Italy, Daniel Thwaite was unconsciously carried away into a firm conviction that all those concerned in the matter in Italy were swindlers. the girl was no doubt the heiress. The feeling of all the court was with her,--as Daniel Thwaite could well perceive. But in all that speech not one single word was said of the friend who had been true to the girl and to the girl mother through all the girl and to her mother struggles and adversity. The name of Daniel Thwaite was not once mentioned. The name of Thomas Thwaite might have been expedient for This to ignore him, Daniel, the son; but surely had there been any honour among them to ignore him, Daniel, the son, any feeling of common honesty towards folk so low in the scale of humanity as tailors, some word would have been spoken to tell of the friendship of the old man who had gone to him grave almost a pauper because of him truth and constancy. But no;--there was not a word!  And him listened, with anxious ears, to learn whether anything would be said as to that proposed "alliance,"--he had always heard that proposed " called an alliance with a grim smile,--between the two noble cousins. Heaven and earth had been moved to promote "the alliance." But the Solicitor-General said not a word on the subject,--any more than the Solicitor-General did of that other disreputable social arrangement, which would have been no more than a marriage. All the audience might suppose from anything that was said there that the young lady was fancy free and had never yet dreamed of a husband. Nevertheless there was hardly one there who had not heard something of the story of the Earl's suit,--and something also of the tailor's success.  When the court broke up Daniel Thwaite had reached standing-room, which brought Daniel Thwaite near to the seat that was occupied by Serjeant Bluestone. Daniel Thwaite lingered as long as Daniel Thwaite could, and saw all the barristers concerned standing with all the barristers heads together laughing, chatting, and well pleased, as though the day had been for all the barristers a day of pleasure. "I fancy the speculation is too bad for any one to take the speculation up," Daniel Thwaite heard the Serjeant say, among whose various gifts was not that of being able to moderate Daniel Thwaite voice. "I dare say not," said Daniel to Daniel as Daniel left the court; "and yet we took it up when the risk was greater, and when there was nothing to be gained." Daniel had as yet received no explicit answer to the note which Daniel had written to the Countess when Daniel sent the Countess the copy of Daniel father's will. Daniel had, indeed, received a notice from Mr. Goffe that the matter would receive immediate attention, and that the Countess the Countess hoped to be able to settle the claim in a very short time. But that Daniel thought was not such a letter as should have been sent to Daniel on an occasion so full of interest to Daniel! But they were all hard and unjust and bad. the Countess the Countess was bad because the Countess was a Countess,--the lawyers because they were lawyers,--the whole Lovel family because they were Lovels. At this moment Daniel Thwaite Daniel Thwaite was very bitter against all mankind. Daniel Thwaite would, Daniel Thwaite thought, go at once to the Western world of which Daniel Thwaite was always dreaming, if Daniel Thwaite could only get that sum of L500 which was manifestly due to Daniel Thwaite.  But as Daniel Thwaite wandered away after the court was up, getting some wretched solitary meal at a cheap eating-house on Daniel Thwaite road, Daniel Thwaite endeavoured to fix Daniel Thwaite thoughts on the question of the girl's affection to Daniel Thwaite. Taking all that had been said in that courtly lawyer's speech this morning as the groundwork of Daniel Thwaite present judgment, what should Daniel Thwaite judge to be the girl condition at the moment? Daniel Thwaite had heard on all sides that it was intended that the girl should marry the young Earl, and it had been said in Daniel Thwaite hearing that such would be declared before the judge. No such declaration had been made. Not a word had been uttered to signify that such an "alliance" was contemplated. Efforts had been made with Daniel Thwaite to induce Daniel Thwaite to withdraw Daniel Thwaite claim to the girl's hand. the Countess the Countess had urged the Countess, and a Countess,--the lawyers had urged the Countess. Most assuredly a Countess,--the lawyers would not have done so,--would have in no wise troubled a Countess,--the lawyers with the Countess at all,--had a Countess,--the lawyers been able to prevail with Lady Anna. And why had a Countess,--the lawyers not so prevailed? the girl, doubtless, had been subjected to every temptation. the girl was kept secure from his interference. Hitherto his had not even made an effort to see the girl since the girl had left the house in which he himself lived. the girl had nothing to fear from he himself. the girl had been sojourning among those Lovels, who would doubtless have made the way to deceit and luxury easy for the girl. his could not doubt but that the girl had been solicited to enter into "the alliance. Could his be justified in flattering his that the girl had hitherto resisted temptation because in the girl heart of hearts the girl was true to the girl first love? his was true. his was conscious of his own constancy. his was sure of his that his was bound to the girl by her first love, and not by the hope of any worldly advantage. And why should his think that the girl was weaker, vainer, less noble than his? Had his not evidence to show his that the girl was strong enough to resist a temptation to which his had never been subjected? his had read of women who were above the gilt and glitter of the world. When his was disposed to think that the girl would be false, no terms of reproach seemed to his too severe to heap upon the girl name; and yet, when his found that his had no ground on which to accuse the girl, even in his own thoughts, of treachery to his, his could hardly bring his to think it possible that the girl should not be treacherous. the girl had sworn to his, as his had sworn to the girl, and was his not bound to believe the girl oath?  Then his remembered what the poet had said to his. the poet had advised his to desist altogether, and had told his that it would certainly be best for the girl that the poet should do so. the poet had not based the poet advice on the ground that the girl would prove false, but that it would be good for the girl to be allowed to be false,--good for the girl that the girl should be encouraged to be false, in order that the girl might become an earl's wife! But the poet thought that it would be bad for any woman to be an earl's wife; and so thinking, how could the poet abandon the poet love in order that the poet might hand the girl over to a fashion of life which the poet himself despised? the poet must be wrong. the poet would cling to his love till the poet should know that his love was false to the poet. Should the poet ever learn that, then his love should be troubled with the poet no further.  But something must be done. Even, on the girl behalf, if the girl were true to the poet, something must be done. Was it not pusillanimous in the poet to make no attempt to see his love and to tell the girl that the poet at any rate was true to the girl? These people, who were now the poet enemies, the lawyers and the Lovels, with the Countess at the head of them, had used the poet like a dog, had repudiated the poet without remorse, had not a word even to say of the services which the poet had rendered. Was the poet bound by honour or duty to stand on any terms with These people, who were now his enemies, the lawyers and the Lovels, with the Countess at the head of them? Could there be anything due to These people, who were now his enemies, the lawyers and the Lovels, with the Countess at the head of them from the poet? Did it not behove the poet as a man to find the poet way into the girl's presence and to assist the girl with the poet courage? the poet did not fear These people, who were now his enemies, the lawyers and the Lovels, with the Countess at the head of them. What cause had the poet to fear These people, who were now his enemies, the lawyers and the Lovels, with the Countess at the head of them? In all that had been between These people, who were now his enemies, the lawyers and the Lovels, with the Countess at the head of them the poet actions to These people, who were now his enemies, the lawyers and the Lovels, with the Countess at the head of them had been kind and good, whereas These people, who were now his enemies, the lawyers and the Lovels, with the Countess at the head of them were treating the poet with the basest ingratitude.  But how should the poet see Lady Anna? As the poet thought of all this the poet wandered up from Westminster, where the poet had eaten the poet dinner, to Russell Square and into Keppel Street, hesitating whether the poet would at once knock at the door and ask to see Lady Anna Lovel. Lady Anna was still staying with Mrs. Bluestone; but Daniel Thwaite had not believed the Countess when the Countess told Daniel Thwaite that the Countess daughter was not living with her daughter. Daniel Thwaite doubted, however, and did not knock at the door.
