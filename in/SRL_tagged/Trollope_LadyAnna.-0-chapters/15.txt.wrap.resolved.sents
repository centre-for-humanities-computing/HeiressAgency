 THE EARL ARRIVES.
At the end of a fortnight the boys had gone back to school, and Lord Lovel was to reach the rectory in time for dinner that evening.
There was a little stir throughout the rectory, as an earl is The Earl though The Earl be in The Earl uncle's house, and rank will sway even aunts and cousins.
The parson at present was a much richer man than the peer;--but the peer was at the head of all the Lovels, and then The parson at present was expected that a much richer man than the peer;--but the peer was at the head of all the Lovels poverty would quickly be made to disappear.
All that Lord Lovel money which had been invested in bank shares, Indian railways, Russian funds, Devon consols, and coal mines, was to become his,--if not in one way, then in another.
The Earl was to be a topping man, and the rectory cook was ordered to do The Earl best.
The big bedroom had been made ready, and The parson at present looked at The parson at present '99 port and The parson at present '16 Margaux.
In those days men drank port, and champagne at country houses was not yet a necessity.
To give the rector of Yoxham The parson at present due it must be said of The parson at present that The parson at present would have done The parson at present very best for the head of The parson at present family had there been no large fortune within the young lord's grasp.
The Lovels had ever been true to The Lovels, with the exception of that late wretched Earl,--the Lady Anna's father.
But if the rector and Earl,--the Lady Anna's father wife were alive to the importance of the expected arrival, what must have been the state of Lady Anna's!
the rector and his wife had met but once before, and during that meeting the rector and his wife had been alone together.
There had grown up, Lady Anna's knew not how, during those few minutes, a heavenly sweetness between the rector and his wife.
The parson at present had talked to Lady Anna's with a voice that had been to Lady Anna's ears as the voice of a god,--it had been so sweet and full of music!
The parson at present had caressed her,--but with a caress so gentle and pure that it had been to Lady Anna's void of all taint of evil.
It had perplexed Lady Anna's for a moment,--but had left no sense of wrong behind a moment,--but.
The parson at present had told Lady Anna's that The parson at present loved her,--that The parson at present would love Lady Anna's dearly; but had not scared Lady Anna's in so telling Lady Anna's, though Lady Anna's knew Lady Anna's could never give The parson at present back such love as that of which The parson at present spoke to Lady Anna's.
There had been a charm in it, of which Lady Anna's delighted to dream,--fancying that Lady Anna's could remember it for ever, as a green island in Lady Anna's life; but could so best remember it if Lady Anna's were assured that Lady Anna's should never see The parson at present more.
But now Lady Anna's was to see The parson at present again, and the charm must be renewed,--or else the dream dispelled for ever.
Alas!
it must be the latter.
Lady Anna's knew that the charm must be dispelled.
But there was a doubt on Lady Anna's own mind whether it would not be dispelled without any effort on Lady Anna's part.
It would vanish at once if he were to greet Lady Anna's as the Lovels had greeted Lady Anna's on Lady Anna's first coming.
Lady Anna's could partly understand that the manner of their meeting in London had thrust upon he a necessity for flattering tenderness with which he might well dispense when he met Lady Anna's among he family.
Had he really loved her,--had he meant to love her,--he would hardly have been absent so long after Lady Anna's coming.
Lady Anna's had been glad that he had been absent,--so Lady Anna's assured herself,--because there could never be any love between them.
Daniel Thwaite had told Lady Anna's that the brotherly love which had been offered was false love,--must be false,--was no love at all.
Do brothers marry sisters; and had not this man already told Lady Anna's that this man wished to make Lady Anna's this man wife?
And then there must never be another kiss.
Daniel Thwaite had told her his wife that; and Daniel Thwaite was, not only her lover, but her master also.
This was the rule by which her would certainly hold.
her would be true to Daniel Thwaite.
And yet her looked for the lord's coming, as one looks for the rising of the sun of an early morning,--watching for that which shall make all the day beautiful.
And he came.
The rector and he wife, and Aunt Julia and Minnie, all went out into the hall to meet he, and Anna was left alone in the library, where The rector and his wife, and Aunt Julia and Minnie, all were wont to congregate before dinner.
It was already past seven, and every one was dressed.
A quarter of an hour was to be allowed to the lord, and the lord was to be hurried up at once to the lord bedroom.
Anna would not see the lord till the lord came down ready, and all hurried, to lead the lord aunt to the dining-room.
Anna heard the scuffle in the hall.
There were kisses;--and a big kiss from Minnie to Anna much-prized Cousin Fred; and a loud welcome from the full-mouthed rector.
"And where is the lord asked.
They were the first words the lord spoke, and Anna heard They, ah!
so plainly.
It was the same voice,--sweet, genial, and manly; sweet to Anna beyond all sweetness that Anna could conceive.
"You shall see Anna when you come down from dressing," said Mrs. Lovel,--in a low voice, but still audible to the solitary girl.
"I will see Anna before I go up to dress," said the lord, walking through I go up to dress, and in through the open door to the library.
"So, here you are.
I am so glad to see you!
I had sworn to go into Scotland before the time was fixed for your coming,--before I had met you,--and I could not escape.
Have you thought ill of your because I have not been here to welcome you sooner?"
"No,--my lord."
"There are horrible penalties for anybody who calls me the lord in this house;--are there not, Aunt Jane?
But I see my uncle wants my uncle dinner."
"I'll take you up-stairs, her much-prized Cousin Fred," said Minnie, who was still holding my uncle cousin's hand.
"I am coming.
I will only say that I would sooner see you here than in any house in England."
Then my uncle went, and during the few minutes that my uncle spent in dressing little or nothing was spoke in the library.
The parson in my uncle heart was not pleased by the enthusiasm with which the young man greeted this new cousin; and yet, why should the young man not be enthusiastic if The parson in his heart was intended that they should be man and wife?
"Now, Lady Anna," said the rector, as my uncle offered Lady Anna my uncle arm to lead Lady Anna out to dinner.
It was but a mild corrective to the warmth of my uncle nephew.
the lord lingered a moment with the lord aunt in the library.
"Have you not got beyond that with Lady Anna yet?"
the lord asked.
"Your uncle is more old fashioned than you are, Fred.
Things did not go so quick when Your uncle was young."
In the evening Your uncle came and lounged on a double-seated ottoman behind Lady Anna, and Lady Anna soon found Lady Anna answering a string of questions.
Had Lady Anna been happy at Yoxham?
Did Lady Anna like the place?
What had Lady Anna been doing?
"Then you know Mrs. Grimes already?"
Lady Anna laughed as Lady Anna said that Lady Anna did know Mrs. Grimes.
"The lion of Yoxham is Mrs. Grimes.
Mrs. Grimes is supposed to have all the misfortunes and all the virtues to which humanity is subject.
And how do you and Minnie get on?
Minnie is my prime minister.
The boys, I suppose, teased you out of your life?"
"I did like The boys so much!
I never knew a boy till I saw The boys, Lord Lovel."
"The boys take care to make The boys known, at any rate.
But The boys are nice, good-humoured lads,--taking after The boys mother.
Don't tell The boys father I said so.
Do you think it pretty about here?"
"Beautifully pretty."
"Just about Yoxham,--because there is so much wood.
But this is not the beautiful part of Yorkshire, you know.
I wonder whether we could make an expedition to Wharfedale and Bolton Abbey.
You would say that the Wharfe was pretty.
we'll try and plan the Wharfe was pretty.
we should have to sleep out one night; but that would make it all the jollier.
There isn't a better inn in England than the Devonshire arms;--and I don't think a pleasanter spot.
Aunt Jane,--couldn't we go for one night to Bolton Abbey?"
"It is very far, Frederic."
"Thirty miles or so;--that ought to be nothing in Yorkshire.
we'll manage Yorkshire.
we could get post-horses from York, and the carriage would take us all.
My uncle, you must know, is very chary about the carriage horses, thinking that the corn of idleness,--which is destructive to young men and women,--is very good for cattle.
But we'll manage it, and you shall jump over the Stryd."
Then Frederic told her the story how the youth was drowned--and how the monks moaned; and Frederic got away to other legends, to the white doe of Rylston, and Landseer's picture of Bolton Abbey in olden times.
her had heard nothing before of these things,--or indeed of such things, and the hearing these things,--or indeed of such things was very sweet to her.
The parson, who was still displeased, went to sleep.
Minnie had been sent to bed, and Aunt Julia and Aunt Jane every now and again put in a word.
It was resolved before the evening was over that the visit should be made to Bolton Abbey.
Of course, his nephew ought to have opportunities of making love to the girl his nephew was doomed to marry.
"Good night, dearest," his nephew said when the girl he was doomed to marry went to bed.
the girl he was doomed to marry was sure that the last word had been so spoken, and that no ear but the girl he was doomed to marry own had heard the last word.
the girl he was doomed to marry could not tell his nephew that such word should not be spoken; and yet the girl he was doomed to marry felt that the last word would be almost as offensive as the kiss to Daniel Thwaite.
the girl he was doomed to marry must contrive some means of telling his nephew that the girl he was doomed to marry could not, would not, must not be his nephew dearest.
the girl he was doomed to marry had now received two letters from the girl he was doomed to marry mother since the girl he was doomed to marry had been at Yoxham, and in each of two letters there were laid down for the girl he was doomed to marry plain instructions as to the girl he was doomed to marry conduct.
It was now the middle of August, and It was incumbent upon the girl he was doomed to marry to allow matters so to arrange matters, that the marriage might be declared to be a settled thing when the case should come on in November.
Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick had met each other, and everything was now understood by the two parties of lawyers.
If the Earl and Lady Anna were then engaged with the mutual consent of all interested,--and so engaged that a day could be fixed for the wedding,--then, when the case was opened in court, would the Solicitor-General declare that it was the intention of Lord Lovel to make no further opposition to the claims of the Countess and Lord Lovel daughter, and it would only remain for Serjeant Bluestone to put in the necessary proofs of the Cumberland marriage and of the baptism of Lady Anna.
the Solicitor-General would at the same time state to the court that an alliance had been arranged between these distant cousins, and that in that way everything would be settled.
But,--and in this clause of her instructions the Countess was most urgent,--this could not be done unless the Cumberland marriage were positively settled.
Mr. Flick had been very urgent in pointing out to Mr. Goffe that in truth their evidence was very strong to prove that when the Earl married the now so-called Countess, Mr. Goffe first wife was still living, though their gave no credit to the woman who now called his first wife the Countess.
But, in either case,--whether the Countess were now alive or now dead,--the daughter would be illegitimate, and the second marriage void, if the Countess surmise on this head should prove to be well founded.
But the Italian party could of the Italian party do nothing, and the second marriage would set everything right.
But the evidence must be brought into court and further sifted, unless the second marriage were a settled thing by November.
All this the Countess the Countess explained at great length in the Countess letters, calling upon the Countess daughter to save her daughter, her daughter mother, and the family.
Anna answered the first epistle,--or rather, wrote another in return to it;--but Anna said nothing of Anna noble lover, except that Lord Lovel had not as yet come to Yoxham.
Anna confined Anna to simple details of Anna daily life, and a prayer that Anna dear mother might be happy.
The second letter from the Countess was severe in The second letter from the Countess tone,--asking why no promise had been made, no assurance given,--no allusion made to the only subject that could now be of interest.
Anna implored Anna child to tell Anna that Anna was disposed to listen to the Earl's suit.
The second letter from the Countess was in Anna pocket when the Earl arrived, and Anna took The second letter from the Countess out and read The second letter from the Countess again after the Earl had whispered in Anna ear that word so painfully sweet.
Anna proposed to answer The second letter from the Countess before breakfast on the following morning.
At Yoxham rectory Yoxham rectory breakfasted at ten, and Anna was always up at least before eight.
Anna determined as Anna laid Anna down that Anna would think of it all night.
It might be best, Anna believed, to tell her mother the whole truth,--that Anna had already promised everything to Daniel Thwaite, and that Anna could not go back from Anna word.
Then Anna began to build castles in the air,--castles which Anna declared to Anna must ever be in the air,--of which Lord Lovel, and not Daniel Thwaite, was the hero, owner, and master.
Anna assured Anna that Anna was not picturing to Anna any prospect of a really possible life, but was simply dreaming of an impossible Elysium.
How many people would Anna make happy, were Anna able to let that young Phoebus know in one half-uttered word,--or with a single silent glance,--that Anna would in truth be that young Phoebus dearest.
It could not be so.
Anna was well aware of that.
But surely Anna might dream of it.
All the cares of that careful, careworn mother would then be at an end.
How delightful would it be to Anna to welcome that sorrowful one to Anna own bright home, and to give joy where joy had never yet been known!
How all the lawyers would praise Anna, and tell Anna that Anna had saved a noble family from ruin.
Anna already began to have feelings about the family to which Anna had been a stranger before Anna had come among the Lovels.
And if it really would make him happy, that young Phoebus, how glorious would that be!
How fit him was to be made happy!
Daniel had said that Daniel was sordid, false, fraudulent, and a fool;--but Daniel did not, could not, understand the nature of the Lovels.
And then Anna herself;--how would it be with Anna?
Anna had given Anna heart to Daniel Thwaite, and Anna had but one heart to give.
Had it not been for that, it would have been very sweet to love that young curled darling.
There were two sorts of life, and now Anna had had an insight into each.
Daniel had told Anna that this soft, luxurious life was thoroughly bad.
Daniel could not have known when saying so, how much was done for this soft, luxurious life was thoroughly bad poor neighbours by such as even these Lovels.
It could not be wrong to be soft, and peaceful, and pretty, to enjoy sweet smells, to sit softly, and eat off delicately painted china plates,--as long as no one was defrauded, and many were comforted.
Daniel Thwaite, Daniel Thwaite believed, never went to church.
Here at Yoxham there were always morning prayers, and they went to church twice every Sunday.
Daniel Thwaite had found it very pleasant to go to church, and to be led along in the easy path of self-indulgent piety on which they all walked at Yoxham.
The church seats at Yoxham were broad, with soft cushions, and the hassocks were well stuffed.
Surely, Daniel Thwaite did not know everything.
As Daniel Thwaite thus built Daniel Thwaite castles in the air,--castles so impossible to be inhabited,--she fell asleep before Daniel Thwaite had resolved what letter Daniel Thwaite should write.
But in the morning Daniel Thwaite did write what letter.
It must be written,--and when the family were about the house, Daniel Thwaite would be too disturbed for so great an effort.
It ran as follows:--      Yoxham, Friday.
DEAREST MAMMA,     I am much obliged for your letter, which I got the    day before yesterday.
Lord Lovel came here yesterday,    or perhaps I might have answered Lord Lovel then.
Everybody    here seems to worship Lord Lovel almost, and Lord Lovel is so good to    everybody!
We are all to go on a visit to Bolton Abbey,    and sleep at an inn somewhere, and I am sure I shall like    it very much, for they say it is most beautiful.
If you    look at the map, it is nearly in a straight line between    here and Kendal, but only much nearer to York.
The day is    not fixed yet, but I believe The day will be very soon.
I shall be so glad if the lawsuit can be got over, for    your sake, dearest mamma.
I wish the lawsuit can be got over, for    your sake, dearest mamma could let you have    your title and your share of the money, and let Lord Lovelhave the rest, because Lord Lovel is head of the family.
That    would be fairest, and I can't see why     should not be so.
Your share would be quite enough for you and me.
I can't    say anything about what you speak of.
He has said nothing,    and I'm sure I hope He won't.
I don't think I could do it;    and I don't think the lawyers ought to want me to.
I think    it is very wrong of the lawyers to say so.
We are strangers, and    I feel almost sure that I could never be what He would    want.
I don't think people ought to marry for money.
Dearest mamma, pray do not be angry with Dearest.
If you are,    you will kill me.
I am very happy here, and nobody has    said anything about my going away.
Couldn't you ask    Serjeant Bluestone whether something couldn't be done to    divide the money, so that there might be no more law?
I am    sure He could if He liked, with Mr. Goffe and the other    men.
Dearest mamma, I am,    Your most affectionate Daughter,     ANNA LOVEL.
When the moment came, and the pen was in her hand, her had not the courage to mention the name of Daniel Thwaite.
her knew that the fearful story must be told, but at the moment her comforted herself,--or tried to comfort herself,--by remembering that Daniel had enjoined that their engagement must yet for a while be kept secret.
