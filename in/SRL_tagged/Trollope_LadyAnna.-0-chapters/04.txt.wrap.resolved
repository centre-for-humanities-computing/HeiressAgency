 LADY ANNA.   The idea of this further compromise, of this something more than compromise, of this half acknowledgment of their own weakness, came from Mr. Flick. When Mr. Flick mentioned it to Sir William Patterson, the great barrister, who was at that time Solicitor-General and leading counsel on behalf of Lord Lovel, Sir William Patterson stood aghast and was dismayed. Sir William Patterson intended to make mince-meat of the Countess. It was said of Sir William Patterson that Sir William Patterson intended to cross-examine the the Countess off to cross-examine the Countess legs, right out of to cross-examine the Countess claim, and almost into to cross-examine the Countess grave. Sir William Patterson certainly did believe to cross-examine the Countess to be an impostor, who had not thought to cross-examine the Countess to be entitled to to cross-examine the Countess name when to cross-examine the Countess first assumed it.  "I should be sorry, Mr. Flick, to be driven to think that anything of that kind could be expedient."  "It would make sure of the fortune to the family," said Mr. Flick.  "And what about our friend, the Countess?"  "Let to cross-examine the Countess call to cross-examine the Countess Countess Lovel, Sir William. That will break no bones. As to the formality of to cross-examine the Countess own marriage, there can be no doubt about that."  "our can prove by Grogram that Grogram was told that another wife was living," said Sir William. Grogram was an old butler who had been in the old Earl's service for thirty years.  "I believe our can, Sir William. It is quite clear that our shall never get another wife to come over and face an English jury. It is of no use blinking It. The gentleman whom our have sent over doubts The gentleman whom we have sent over altogether. That there was a marriage is certain, but there was a marriage fears that The gentleman whom we have sent over is not the old Countess. There were two sisters, and it may be that this was the other sister."  Sir William was a good deal dismayed, but Sir William recovered Sir William. The stakes were so high that The stakes was quite possible that the gentleman who had been sent over might have been induced to open Sir William eyes to the possibility of such personation by overtures from the other side. Sir William was of opinion that Mr. Flick himself should go to Sicily. Sir William was not sure that Sir William, Sir William, her Majesty's Solicitor-General, would not make the journey in person. he, Sir William, her Majesty's Solicitor-General, would not make the journey in person was by no means disposed to give way. "They tell me that the girl is no better than the girl should be," he, Sir William, her Majesty's Solicitor-General, would not make the journey in person said to Mr. Flick himself.  "I don't think so bad as that of the girl," said Mr. Flick himself.  "Is the girl a lady,--or anything like a lady?"  "I am told a lady is very beautiful."  "I dare say;--and so was a lady mother before a lady. I never saw a handsomer woman of her mother age than our friend the Countess. But I could not recommend the young lord to marry an underbred, bad girl, and a bastard who claims to be the young lord cousin,--and support my proposition merely on the ground of her mother looks."  "Thirty-five thousand a year, Sir William!" pleaded the attorney.  "I hope we can get the thirty-five thousand a year for we client without paying so dear for our client."  It had been presumed that the real Countess, the original Countess, the Italian lady whom the Earl had married in early life, would be brought over, with properly attested documentary evidence in her pocket, to prove that her was the existing Countess, and that any other Countess must be either an impostor or a deluded dupe. No doubt the Earl had declared, when first informing Josephine Murray that the Earl was not the Earl wife, that the Earl real wife had died during the few months which had intervened since the Earl mock marriage; but it was acknowledged on all sides, that the Earl had been a villain and a liar. It was no part of the duty of the young Earl, or of those who acted for the Earl, to defend the character of the Earl. To wash that blackamoor white, or even to make the character of the old Earl whity-brown, was not necessary to anybody. No one was now concerned to account for the character of the old Earl crooked courses. But if No one could be shown that the character of the old Earl had married the lady in Italy,--as to which there was no doubt,--and that the Lady Anna was still alive, or that the Lady Anna had been alive when the second marriage took place, then the Lady Anna could not inherit the property which had been freed from the grasp of the Italian mistress. But it seemed that the Lady Anna, if the Lady Anna lived, could not be made to come. Mr. Flick did go to Sicily, and came back renewing Mr. Flick advice to Sir William that Lord Lovel should be advised to marry the Lady Anna.  At this time the Countess, with the Countess daughter, had moved their residence from Keswick up to London, and was living in very humble lodgings in a small street turning out of the New Road, near the Yorkshire Stingo. Old Thomas Thwaite had accompanied their from Cumberland, but the rooms had been taken for their by Old Thomas Thwaite son, Daniel Thwaite, who was at this time foreman to a somewhat celebrated tailor who carried on foreman business in Wigmore Street; and foreman, Daniel Thwaite, had a bedroom in the house in which the Countess the Countess lodged. The arrangement was not a wise one, as reports had already been spread abroad as to the partiality of the Lady Anna for the young tailor. But how should the Lady Anna not have been partial both to the father and to the son, feeling as the Lady Anna did that the father and to the son were the only two men who befriended the Lady Anna cause and the Lady Anna mother's? As to the Countess, the Lady Anna, perhaps, alone of all those who interested all those who interested themselves in her daughter in the Lady Anna daughter's cause, had heard no word of these insinuations against the Lady Anna child. To the Lady Anna both Thomas and Daniel Thwaite were dear friends, to repay whom for both Thomas and Daniel Thwaite exertions with lavish generosity,--should the means to do so ever come within the Lady Anna reach,--was one of the dreams of reach,--was existence. But reach,--was was an ambitious woman, thinking much of reach,--was rank, thinking much even of the blood of reach,--was own ancestors, constantly urgent with reach,--was in teaching reach,--was the duties and privileges of wealth and rank. For the Countess never doubted that the Countess would at last attain success. That the Lady Anna should throw the Lady Anna away upon Daniel Thwaite did not occur to the Lady Anna as a possibility. the Lady Anna had not even dreamed that Daniel Thwaite would aspire to the Lady Anna 's hand. And yet every shop-boy and every shop-girl in Keswick had been so saying for the last twelvemonth, and rumours which had hitherto been confined to Keswick and Keswick neighbourhood, were now common in London. For the case was becoming one of the celebrated causes of the age, and all the world was talking of the Countess and Countess . No momentary suspicion had crossed the mind of the Countess till after their arrival in London; and then when No momentary suspicion did touch the Lady Anna it was not love that the Lady Anna suspected,--but rather an unbecoming familiarity which the Lady Anna attributed to the Lady Anna child's ignorance of the great life which awaited the Lady Anna. "My dear," the Lady Anna said one day when Daniel Thwaite had left them, "you should be less free in your manner with that young man."  "What do you mean, mamma?" said the daughter, blushing.  "You had better call that young man Daniel Thwaite."  "But I have called that young man Daniel ever since I was born."  "that young man always calls you the Lady Anna."  "Sometimes that young man does, mamma."  "I never heard that young man call you anything else," said the Countess, almost with indignation. "It is all very well for the old man, because the old man is an old man and has done so much for us."  "So has Daniel;--quite as much, mamma. Daniel;--quite as much, mamma have both done everything."  "True; Daniel;--quite as much, mamma have both been warm friends; and if ever I forget Daniel;--quite as much, mamma may God forget me. I trust that we may both live to show Daniel;--quite as much, mamma that Daniel;--quite as much, mamma are not forgotten. But it is not fitting that there should exist between you and that young man the intimacy of equal positions. You are not and cannot be that young man equal. that young man has been born to be a tailor, and you are the daughter and heiress of an Earl."  These last words were spoken in a tone that was almost awful to the Lady Anna. the Lady Anna had heard so much of the Lady Anna father's rank and the Lady Anna father's wealth,--rank and wealth which were always to be hers, but which had never as yet reached the Lady Anna, which had been a perpetual trouble to the Lady Anna, and a crushing weight upon the Lady Anna young life, that the Lady Anna had almost learned to hate the title and the claim. Of course it was a part of the religion of the Lady Anna life that the Lady Anna had been duly married to her father. It was beyond a doubt to the Lady Anna that such was the case. But the constant battling for denied rights, the assumption of a position which could not be attained, the use of titles which were simply ridiculous in themselves as connected with the kind of life which the Lady Anna was obliged to lead,--these things had all become odious to the Lady Anna. the Lady Anna lacked the ambition which gave the Lady Anna mother strength, and would gladly have become Anna Murray or Anna Lovel, with a girl's ordinary privilege of loving the Lady Anna lover, had such an easy life been possible to the Lady Anna.  In person the Lady Anna was very lovely, less tall and robust than the Lady Anna had been, but with a sweeter, softer face. the Lady Anna hair was less dark, and the Lady Anna eyes were neither blue nor bold. But they were bright and soft and very eloquent, and when laden with tears would have softened the heart,--almost of her father. the Lady Anna was as yet less powerful than the Lady Anna , both in body and mind, but probably better calculated to make a happy home for a husband and children. the Lady Anna was affectionate, self-denying, and feminine. Had that offer of compromise for thirty, twenty, or for ten thousand pounds been made to the Lady Anna, the Lady Anna would have accepted that offer of compromise willingly,--caring little for the Lady Anna name, little even for fame, so that the Lady Anna might have been happy and quiet, and at liberty to think of a lover as are other girls. In the Lady Anna present condition, how could the Lady Anna have any happy love? the Lady Anna was the Lady Anna Lovel, heir to a ducal fortune,--but the Lady Anna lived in small close lodgings in Wyndham Street, New Road. the Lady Anna did not believe in the good time coming as did the Lady Anna . Their enemy was an undoubted Earl, undoubtedly owner of Lovel Grange of which the Lady Anna had heard all the Lady Anna life. Would it not be better to take what the young lord chose to give Their and to be at rest? But the Lady Anna did not dare to express such thoughts to the Lady Anna . the Lady Anna would have crushed the Lady Anna with a look.  "I have told Old Thomas Thwaite," her mother said to her daughter, "what we were saying this morning."  "About his son?"  "Yes,--about his son."  "Oh, mamma!"  "I was bound to do so."  "And what did his son say, mamma?"  "his son did not like it, and told me that his son did not like it;--but his son admitted that it was true. his son admitted that his son was no fitting intimate for Lady Anna Lovel."  "What should we have done without his son?"  "Badly indeed; but that cannot change his son duty, or we. his son is helping we to struggle for that which is we own; but his son would mar his son generosity if his son put a taint on that which his son is endeavouring to restore to we."  "Put a taint, mamma!"  "Yes;--a taint would rest upon your rank if you as Lady Anna Lovel were familiar with Daniel Thwaite as with an equal. Daniel Thwaite understands it, and will speak to Daniel Thwaite."  "Mamma, Daniel will be very angry."  "Then will the father be very unreasonable;--but, the Lady Anna, I will not have you call the father Daniel any more."
