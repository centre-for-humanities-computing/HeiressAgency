 LADY ANNA'S RECEPTION.   The Countess went into the City to meet The Countess daughter at the Saracen's Head, whither the York coach used to run, and received her daughter almost in silence. "Oh, mamma, dear mamma," said her daughter, "I am so glad to be back with her daughter again." Sarah, the lady's-maid, was there, useless, officious, and long-eared. The Countess The Countess said almost nothing; The Countess submitted to be kissed, and The Countess asked after the luggage. At that time The Countess had heard the whole story about Daniel Thwaite.  The Solicitor-General had disregarded altogether The Solicitor-General client's injunctions as to secrecy. The Solicitor-General had felt that in a matter of so great importance it behoved The Solicitor-General to look to The Solicitor-General client's interests, rather than The Solicitor-General client's instructions. This promise of a marriage with the tailor's son must be annihilated. On behalf of the whole Lovel family it was the tailor's son duty, as the tailor's son thought, to see that this should be effected, if possible,--and as quickly as possible. This was his duty, not only as a lawyer employed in a particular case, but as a man who would be bound to prevent any great evil which his saw looming in the future. In his view of the case the marriage of Lady Anna Lovel, with a colossal fortune, to Daniel Thwaite the tailor, would be a grievous injury to the social world of his country,--and it was one of those evils which may probably be intercepted by due and discreet precautions. No doubt the tailor wanted money. the tailor was entitled to some considerable reward for all that the tailor had done and all that the tailor had suffered in the cause. But his could not his propose some considerable reward for all that he had done and all that he had suffered in the cause. his could not chaffer for terms with the tailor. his could not be seen in that matter. But having heard the secret from the Earl, his thought that his could get the work done. So his sent for Mr. Flick, the attorney, and told Mr. Flick all that his knew. "Gone and engaged herself to the tailor!" said Mr. Flick, holding up both Mr. Flick hands. Then his took Lady Anna's part. After all, such an engagement was not,--as he thought,--unnatural. It had been made while herself was very young, when herself knew no other man of herself own age in life, when herself was greatly indebted to this man, when herself had had no opportunity of measuring a young tailor against a young lord. herself had done it probably in gratitude;--so said Sir William;--and now clung to it from good faith rather than affection. Neither was he severe upon the tailor. he was a man especially given to make excuses for poor weak, erring, unlearned mortals, ignorant of the law,--unless when a witness attempted to be impervious;--and now he made excuses for Daniel Thwaite. Daniel Thwaite might have done so much worse than Daniel Thwaite was doing. There seemed already to be a noble reliance on Daniel Thwaite in Daniel Thwaite conduct. Lord Lovel thought that there had been no correspondence while the young lady had been at Yoxham. There might have been, but had not been, a clandestine marriage. Other reasons Lord Lovel gave why Daniel Thwaite should not be regarded as altogether villanous. But, nevertheless, the tailor must not be allowed to carry off the prize. the prize was too great for the tailor. What must be done? Sir William condescended to ask Mr. Flick what Sir William thought ought to be done. "No doubt we should be very much guided by you, Sir William," said Mr. Flick.  "One thing is, I think, plain, Mr. Flick. You must see the Countess and tell the Countess, or get Mr. Goffe to do so. It is clear that the Countess has been kept in the dark between them. At present them are all living together in the same house. the Countess had better leave the place and go elsewhere. them should be kept apart, and the Countess, if necessary, should be carried abroad."  "I take it there is a difficulty about money, Mr. Solicitor."  "There ought to be none,--and I will take it upon you to say that there need be none. It is a case in which the court will willingly allow money out of the income of the property. The thing is so large that there should be no grudging of money for needful purposes. Seeing what prima facie claims these ladies have, these ladies are bound to allow these ladies to live decently, in accordance with these ladies alleged rank, till the case is settled. No doubt the Countess is the heiress."  "You feel quite sure, Sir William?"  "I do;--though, as I have said before, it is a case of feeling sure, and not being sure. Had the Countess been really the widow, somebody would have brought the case forward more loudly."  "But if the Countess was the wife?"  "You would have found the case out when you were there. Somebody from the country would have come to us with evidence, knowing how much us could afford to pay for the case. Mind you, the matter has been tried before, in another shape. The old Earl was indicted for bigamy and acquitted. us are bound to regard the Countess, and us are bound to regard the Countess and the Countess mother conjointly as co-heiresses, in different degrees, to all the personal property which The old Earl left behind The old Earl. us can't with safety take any other view. There will still be difficulties in their way;--and very serious difficulties, were the Countess to marry this tailor; but, between you and me, this tailor would eventually get the money. Perhaps, Mr. Flick, you had better see this tailor. You would know how to get at this tailor views without compromising anybody. But, in the first place, let The old Earl know everything. After what has been done, you won't have any difficulty in meeting Mr. Goffe."  Mr. Flick had no difficulty in seeing Mr. Goffe,--though Mr. Goffe,--though felt that there would be very much difficulty in seeing Mr. Daniel Thwaite. Mr. Goffe,--though did tell Mr. Goffe the story of the wicked tailor,--by no means making those excuses which the Solicitor-General had made for the man's presumptuous covetousness. "I knew the trouble we should have with the man," said Mr. Goffe, who had always disliked the Thwaites. Then Mr. Flick went on to say that Mr. Goffe had better tell the Countess,--and Mr. Goffe on this point agreed with Mr. Goffe adversary. Two or three days after that, but subsequently to the date of the last letter which the mother had written to the mother daughter, Lady Lovel was told that Lady Anna was engaged to marry Mr. Daniel Thwaite.  Lady Anna had suspected how it might be; Lady Anna heart had for the last month been heavy with the dread of this great calamity; Lady Anna had made Lady Anna plans with the view of keeping the two apart; Lady Anna had asked Lady Anna daughter questions founded on this very fear;--and yet Lady Anna could not for a while be brought to believe a while. How did Mr. Goffe know? Mr. Goffe had heard Mr. Goffe from Mr. Flick, who had heard Mr. Goffe from Sir William Patterson; to whom the tale had been told by Lady Lovel. "And who told Lady Lovel?" said the Countess flashing up in anger.  "No doubt Lady Anna did so," said the attorney. But in spite of Lady Anna indignation Lady Anna could retain Lady Anna doubts. the attorney, however, was certain. "There could be no hope but that it was so." Lady Anna still pretended not to believe it was so, though fully intending to take all due precautions in the matter. Since Mr. Goffe thought that it would be prudent, Lady Anna would remove to other lodgings. Lady Anna would think of that plan of going abroad. Lady Anna would be on Lady Anna guard, Lady Anna said. But Lady Anna would not admit it to be possible that Lady Anna Lovel, the daughter of Lady Lovel, Lady Anna daughter, should have so far disgraced Lady Anna.  But Lady Anna did believe it. Lady Anna heart had in truth told Lady Anna that it was true at the first word the lawyer had spoken to Lady Anna. How blind Lady Anna must have been not to have known it was true at the first word the lawyer had spoken to her! How grossly stupid not to have understood those asseverations from the girl, that the marriage with Lady Anna cousin was impossible! Lady Anna child had not only deceived Lady Anna, but had possessed cunning enough to maintain Lady Anna deception. It must have been going on for at least the last twelvemonth, and Lady Anna, the while, had been kept in the dark by the manoeuvres of a simple girl! And then Lady Anna thought of the depth of the degradation which was prepared for Lady Anna. Had Lady Anna passed twenty years of unintermittent combat for this,--that when all had been done, when at last success was won, when the rank and wealth of Her child had been made positively secure before the world, when Lady Anna was about to see the unquestioned coronet of a the Countess placed upon Lady Anna child's brow,--all should be destroyed through a passion so mean as this! Would it not have been better to have died in poverty and obscurity,--while there were yet doubts,--before any assured disgrace had rested on Lady Anna? But, oh! to have proved that Lady Anna was a Countess, and Lady Anna child the heiress of an Earl, in order that Lady Lovel might become the wife of Daniel Thwaite, the tailor!  Lady Anna made many resolutions; but the first was this, that Lady Anna would never smile upon the Countess again till this baseness should have been abandoned. Lady Anna loved Lady Anna as only mothers do love. More devoted than the pelican, Lady Anna would have given Lady Anna heart's blood,--had given all Lady Anna life,--not only to nurture, but to aggrandize Her child. The establishment of Lady Anna own position, Lady Anna own honour, Lady Anna own name, was to Lady Anna but the incidental result of Lady Anna daughter's emblazonment in the world. The child which Lady Anna had borne to Earl Lovel, and which the father had stigmatised as a bastard, should by Lady Anna means be known as the Lady Anna, the heiress of that father's wealth,--the wealthiest, the fairest, the most noble of England's daughters. Then there had come the sweet idea that this high-born heiress of the Lovels, should Lady Anna become Countess Lovel, and the mother had risen higher in Lady Anna delighted pride. It had all been for Her child! Had Lady Anna not loved as a mother, and with all a mother's tenderness? And for what?  Lady Anna would love still, but Lady Anna would never again be tender till her daughter should have repudiated Lady Anna base,--her monstrous engagement. Lady Anna bound up all Lady Anna faculties to harshness, and a stern resolution. her daughter had been deceitful, and her daughter would now be ruthless. There might be suffering, but had not her daughter suffered? There might be sorrow, but had not her daughter sorrowed? There might be a contest, but had not her daughter ever been contesting? Sooner than that the tailor should reap the fruit of her daughter labours,--labours which had been commenced when her daughter first gave her daughter in marriage to that dark, dreadful man,--sooner than that her daughter should make ignoble the blood which it had cost her daughter so much to ennoble, her daughter would do deeds which should make even the wickedness of her daughter husband child's play in the world's esteem. It was in this mood of mind that her daughter went to meet her daughter at the Saracen's Head.  her daughter had taken fresh lodgings very suddenly,--in Keppel Street, near Russell Square, a long way from Wyndham Street. her daughter had asked Mr. Goffe to recommend her daughter a place, and Mr. Goffe had sent her daughter to an old lady with whom Mr. Goffe himself had lodged in he himself bachelor's days. Keppel Street cannot be called fashionable, and Russell Square is not much affected by the nobility. Nevertheless the house was superior in all qualifications to that which her daughter was now leaving, and the rent was considerably higher. But the affairs of the Countess in regard to money were in the ascendant; and Mr. Goffe did not scruple to take for her daughter a "genteel" suite of drawing-rooms,--two rooms with folding-doors, that is,--with the bedrooms above, first-class lodging-house attendance, and a garret for the lady's-maid. "And then it will be quite close to Mrs. Bluestone," said Mr. Goffe, who knew of that intimacy.  The drive in a glass coach home from the coach-yard to Keppel Street was horrible to Lady Anna. Not a word was spoken, as Sarah, the lady's-maid, sat with them in the carriage. Once or twice the poor girl tried to get hold of twice the poor girl mother's hand, in order that twice the poor girl might entice something of a caress. But the Countess the Countess would admit of no such softness, and at last withdrew the Countess hand roughly. "Oh mamma!" said Lady Anna, unable to suppress Lady Anna dismay. But the Countess the Countess said never a word. Sarah, the lady's-maid, began to think that there must be a second lover. "Is Keppel Street?" said Lady Anna when the coach stopped.  "No, my dear;--this is not Wyndham Street. I have taken another abode. This is where we are to live. If you will get out I will follow you, and Sarah will look to the luggage." Then her daughter entered the house, and met the Countessher daughter. her daughter at once felt that her daughter had been removed from contact with Daniel Thwaite, and was sure that her mother knew her daughter story. "That is your room," said her mother. "You had better get your things off. Are you tired?"  "Oh! so tired!" and Lady Anna burst into tears.  "What will you have?"  "Oh, nothing! I think I will go to bed, mamma. Why are you unkind to me? Do tell me. Anything is better than that you should be unkind."  "Anna,--have not you been unkind to me?"  "Never, mamma;--never. I have never meant to be unkind. I love you better than all the world. I have never been unkind. But, you;--Oh, mamma, if you look at me like that, I shall die."  "Is it true that you have promised that you would be the wife of Mr. Daniel Thwaite?"  "Mamma!"  "Is it true? I will be open with you;--Oh, mamma. Mr. Goffe tells me that you have refused Lady Lovel, telling Lady Lovel that you must do so because you were engaged to Mr. Daniel Thwaite. Is that true?"  "Yes, mamma;--it is true."  "And you have given your word to that man?"  "I have, mamma."  "And yet you told me that there was no one else when I spoke to you;--Oh, mamma of Lady Lovel? You lied to me?" the Countess sat confounded, astounded, without power of utterance. the Countess had travelled from York to London, inside one of those awful vehicles of which we used to be so proud when we talked of we stage coaches. the Countess was thoroughly weary and worn out. the Countess had not breakfasted that morning, and was sick and ill at ease, not only in heart, but in body also. Of course it was so. her mother knew that it was so. But this was no time for fond compassion. It would be better, far better that the Countess should die than that the Countess should not be compelled to abandon this grovelling abasement. "Then you lied to me?" repeated the Countess still standing over the Countess.  "Oh, mamma, you mean to kill me."  "I would sooner die here, at your feet, this moment, and know that you must follow me within an hour, than see you married to such a one as that. You shall never marry the Countess. Though I went into court me and swore that I was that lord's mistress,--that I knew it when I went to him,--that you were born a brat beyond the law, that I had lived a life of perjury, I would prevent such greater disgrace as this. this shall never be. I will take you away where he shall never hear of you. As to the money, the money shall go to the winds, so that he shall never touch the money. Do you think that it is you that he cares for? he has heard of all this wealth,--and you are but the bait upon he hook to catch it."  "You do not know he, mamma."  "Will you tell me of he, that I do not know he; impudent slut! Did I not know he before you were born? Have I not known he through? Will you give me your word of honour that you will never see he again?" Lady Anna tried to think, but Lady Anna mind would not act for Lady Anna. Everything was turning round, and Lady Anna became giddy and threw Lady Anna on the bed. "Answer me, Lady Anna. Will you give me your word of honour that you will never see he again?"  Lady Anna might still have said yes. Lady Anna felt that enough of speech was left to Lady Anna for so small an effort,--and Lady Anna knew that if Lady Anna did so the agony of the moment would pass away from Lady Anna. With that one word spoken her mother would be kind to Lady Anna, and would wait upon Lady Anna; would bring Lady Anna tea, and would sit by Lady Anna bedside, and caress Lady Anna. But Lady Anna too was a Lovel, and Lady Anna was, moreover, the daughter of Lady Anna who once had been Josephine Murray.  "I cannot say that, mamma," Lady Anna said, "because I have promised."  her mother dashed from the room, and Lady Anna was left alone upon the bed.
