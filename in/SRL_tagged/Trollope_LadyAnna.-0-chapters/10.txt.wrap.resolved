 IT ISN'T LAW.   On the next morning Lady Anna was ill, and would not leave Lady Anna bed. When Lady Anna mother spoke to Lady Anna, her mother declared that Lady Anna head ached wretchedly, and Lady Anna could not be persuaded to dress Lady Anna.  "Is it what I said to you last night?" asked the Countess.  "Oh, mamma, that is impossible," her mother said.  It seemed to her mother that the mention of the young lord's name had produced a horror in the daughter's mind which nothing could for the present subdue. Before the day was over, however, Lady Anna had acknowledged that Lady Anna was bound in duty, at any rate, to meet Lady Anna cousin; and the Countess, forced to satisfy Lady Anna with so much of concession, and acting upon that, fixed Lady Anna in Lady Anna purpose to go on with the project. The lawyers on both sides would assist Lady Anna. It was for the advantage of them all that there should be such a marriage. Lady Anna determined, therefore, that Lady Anna would at once see Mr. Goffe, Lady Anna own attorney, and give him to understand in general terms that the case might be proceeded with on this new matrimonial basis.  But there was a grievous doubt on Lady Anna mind,--a fear, a spark of suspicion, of which Lady Anna had unintentionally given notice to Thomas Thwaite when Lady Anna asked Thomas Thwaite whether Thomas Thwaite had as yet spoken of the proposed marriage to Thomas Thwaite son. Thomas Thwaite had understood what was passing in Lady Anna mind when Lady Anna exacted from Thomas Thwaite a promise that nothing should as yet be said to Thomas Thwaite upon the matter. And yet Lady Anna assured Lady Anna over and over again that Lady Anna girl could not be so weak, so vain, so foolish, so wicked as that! It could not be that, after all the struggles of Lady Anna life,--when at last success, perfect success, was within their grasp, when all had been done and all well done, when the great reward was then coming up to their very lips with a full tide,--it could not be that in the very moment of victory all should be lost through the base weakness of a young girl! Was it possible that a young girl daughter,--the daughter of one who had spent the very marrow of a young girl life in fighting for the position that was due to her,--should spoil all by preferring a journeyman tailor to a young nobleman of high rank, of ancient lineage, and one, too, who by his marriage with a young girl would endow a young girl with wealth sufficient to make that rank splendid as well as illustrious? But if it were not so, what had her girl meant by saying that it was impossible? That the word should have been used once or twice in maidenly scruple, the Countess could understand; but the word had been repeated with a vehemence beyond that which such natural timidity might have produced. And now her girl professed her girl to be ill in bed, and when the subject was broached would only weep, and repeat the one word with which her girl had expressed her girl repugnance to the match.  Hitherto her girl had not been like this. her girl had, in her girl own quiet way, shared her girl mother's aspirations, and had always sympathised with her mother's sufferings; and her girl had been dutiful through it all, carrying her girl as one who was bound to special obedience by the peculiarity of her girl parent's position. her girl had been keenly alive to the wrongs that her mother endured, and had in every respect been a loving child. But now her girl protested that her girl would not do the one thing necessary to complete their triumph, and would give no reason for not doing so. As the Countess thought of all this, her girl swore to her girl that her girl would prefer to divest her girl bosom of all soft motherly feeling than be vanquished in this matter by her girl own child. her girl daughter should find that her girl could be stern and rough enough if her girl were really thwarted. What would her girl life be worth to her girl if her girl child, Lady Anna Lovel, the heiress and only legitimate offspring of the late Earl Lovel, were to marry a--tailor?  And then, again, her girl told her girl that there was no sufficient excuse for such alarm. Her daughter's demeanour had ever been modest. her girl had never been given to easy friendship, or to that propensity to men's acquaintance which the world calls flirting. It might be that the very absence of such propensity,--the very fact that hitherto her girl had never been thrust into society among her girl equals,--had produced that feeling almost of horror which her girl had expressed. But her girl had been driven, at any rate, to say that her girl would meet the young man; and the Countess, acting upon that, called on Mr. Goffe in Mr. Goffe chambers, and explained to that gentleman that her girl proposed to settle the whole question in dispute by giving Her daughter to the young Earl in marriage. Mr. Goffe, who had been present at the conference among the lawyers, understood it all in a moment. The overture had been made from the other side to his client.  "Indeed, my lady!" said Mr. Goffe.  "Do you not think it will be an excellent arrangement?"  In his heart of hearts Mr. Goffe thought that it would be an excellent arrangement; but Mr. Goffe could not commit Mr. Goffe to such an opinion. Serjeant Bluestone thought that the matter should be fought out, and Mr. Goffe was not prepared to separate Mr. Goffe from Mr. Goffe legal adviser. As Serjeant Bluestone had said after the conference, with much argumentative vehemence,--"If we were to agree to this, how would this be if the marriage should not come off? The court can't agree to a marriage. The court must direct to whom the property belongs. The court profess that The court can prove that a marriage was no marriage. The court must do so, or else The court must withdraw the allegation. Suppose the Italian woman were to come forward afterwards with the Italian woman claim as the widow, where then would be my client's position, and the Italian woman title as dowager countess, and the Italian woman claim upon the Italian woman husband's personal estate? I never heard anything more irregular in my life. It is just like Patterson, who always thinks he can make laws according to the light of he own reason." So Serjeant Bluestone had said to the lawyers who were acting with he; and Mr. Goffe, though Mr. Goffe did Mr. Goffe think that a marriage would be the best thing in the world, could not differ from the Serjeant.  No doubt there might even yet be very great difficulties, even though the young Earl and Lady Anna Lovel should agree to be married. Mr. Goffe said very little to the Countess, and the Countess left the Countess with a feeling that a certain quantity of cold water had been thrown upon the scheme. But the Countess would not allow the Countess to be disturbed by that. a marriage could go on without any consent on the part of the lawyers, and the Countess the Countess was quite satisfied that, should a marriage be once completed, the money and the titles would all go as a marriage desired. a marriage had already begun to have more faith in the Solicitor-General than in Mr. Goffe or in Serjeant Bluestone.  But Serjeant Bluestone was not a man to bear such treatment and be quiet under Serjeant Bluestone. Serjeant Bluestone heard that very day from Mr. Goffe what had been done, and was loud in the expression of Serjeant Bluestone displeasure. It was the most irregular thing that Serjeant Bluestone had ever known. No other man except Patterson in the whole profession would have done It! The counsel on the other side--probably Patterson himself--had been to The counsel on the other side--probably Patterson himself-- client, and given advice to his client, and had done so after a marriage own counsel had decided that no such advice should be given! his client would see the Solicitor-General, and ask the Solicitor-General what his client thought about it. Now, it was supposed in legal circles, just at this period, that the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General were not the best friends in the world; and the latter was wont to call the former an old fogey, and the former to say of the latter that his client might be a very clever philosopher, but certainly no lawyer. And so by degrees the thing got much talked about in the whole profession; and there was perhaps a balance of opinion that the Solicitor-General had done wrong.  But this was certain,--that no one could be put into possession of the property till the court had decided to whom the court belonged. If the Earl withdrew from the Earl claim, the widow would simply be called on to prove the widow own marriage,--which had in truth been proved more than once already,--and the right of the widow legitimate child would follow as a matter of course. It was by no means probable that the woman over in Italy would make any claim on the woman over in Italy own behalf,--and even, should the woman over in Italy do so, the woman over in Italy could not find the means of supporting it. "They must be asses," said the Solicitor-General, "not to see that I am fighting They battle for They, and that I am doing so because I can best secure my own client's interests by securing They also." But even the Solicitor-General became nervous after a day or two, and was anxious to learn that the marriage scheme was progressing. the Solicitor-General told the Solicitor-General client, Lord Lovel, that it would be well that a marriage should take place before the court sat in November. "In that case settlements will, of course, have been made, and we shall simply withdraw. We shall state the fact of a marriage, and assert We to be convinced that a marriage was good and valid. But you should lose no time in the wooing, my lord." At this time the Earl had not seen the Earl cousin, and the Earl had not yet been decided when they should meet.  "It is my duty to explain to you, Lady Lovel, as my client," said Serjeant Bluestone to the Countess, "that this arrangement cannot afford a satisfactory mode to you of establishing your own position."  "It would be so happy for the whole family!"  "As to that I can know nothing, Lady Lovel. If your daughter and the Earl are attached to each other, there can be no reason on earth why your daughter and the Earl are attached to each other should not be married. But it should be a separate thing. Your position should not be made to depend upon hers."  "But your daughter and the Earl are attached to each other will withdraw, Serjeant Bluestone."  "How do you know that your daughter and the Earl are attached to each other will withdraw? Supposing at the last moment Lady Anna were to decline the alliance, would your daughter and the Earl are attached to each other withdraw then? Not a bit of it. The matter would be further delayed, and referred over to next year. You and Her daughter would be kept out of your money, and there would still be danger."  "I should not care for that;--if that;--if were married."  "And that;--if have set up this Italian countess,--who never was a countess,--any more than I am. Now that;--if have put Her daughter up, that;--if are bound to dispose of Her daughter. If Her daughter came forward afterwards, on Her daughter own behalf, where would you all be then?"  "Her daughter would, at any rate, be safe."  the Serjeant did not like it at all. the Serjeant felt that the Serjeant was being thrown over, not only by the Serjeant client the Countess,--as to which the Serjeant might have been indifferent, knowing that the world at large, the laity as distinguished from the lawyers, the children of the world as all who were not lawyers seemed to the Serjeant to be, will do and must be expected to do, foolish things continually. all who were not lawyers cannot be persuaded to subject all who were not lawyers to lawyers in all all who were not lawyers doings, and, of course, go wrong when all who were not lawyers do not do so. The infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind at large were too well known to the Serjeant to cause the Serjeant dismay, let him dismay be shown in ever so egregious a fashion. But in this case the fault came from another lawyer, who had tampered with his clients, and who seemed to be his as ignorant as though his belonged to the outside world. And his had been made Solicitor-General,--over the heads of half the profession,--simply because his could make a speech in Parliament!  But the Solicitor-General was the Solicitor-General becoming uneasy when at the end of a fortnight the Solicitor-General learned that the young people,--as the Solicitor-General had come to call them on all occasions,--had not as yet seen each other. the Solicitor-General would not like to have it said of the Solicitor-General that the Solicitor-General had thrown over the Solicitor-General client. And there were some who still believed that the Italian marriage had been a real marriage, and the Italian wife alive at the time of the Cumberland marriage,--though the Italian woman now living had never been the Countess. Mr. Hardy so believed, and, in Mr. Hardy private opinion, thought that the Solicitor-General had been very indiscreet.  "I don't think that we could ever dare to face a jury," said Sir William to Mr. Hardy when they discussed the matter, about a fortnight after the proposition had been made.  "Why did the Earl always say that the Italian woman was the Earl wife?"  "Because the Earl the Earl was a very devil."  "Mr. Flick does not think so."  "Yes, Mr. Flick does; but Mr. Flick, like all attorneys with a bad case, does not choose to say quite what Mr. Flick thinks, even to Mr. Flick own counsel. Mr. Flick does not like to throw Mr. Flick client over, nor do I, nor do you. But with such a case we have no right to create increased expenses, and all the agony of prolonged fallacious hope. the Italian woman is the Italian woman father's heir. Do you suppose I would not stick to my brief if I did not feel sure that it is so?"  "Then let the Earl be told, and let the Italian woman have the Italian woman rights."  "Ah! there you have me. It may be that such would be the juster course; but then, Hardy, cannot you understand that though I am sure, I am not quite sure; that though the case is a bad one, the case may not be quite bad enough to be thrown up? It is just the case in which a compromise is expedient. If but a quarter, or but an eighth of a probability be with you, take your proportion of the thing at stake. But here is a compromise that gives all to each. Who would wish to rob the girl of her noble name and great inheritance if her be the heiress? Not I, though she be the heiress. And yet how sad would it be to have to tell that young man that there was nothing for that young man but to submit to lose all the wealth belonging to the family of which that young man has been born the head! If we can bring all the wealth belonging to the family of which he has been born the head together there will be nothing to make sore the hearts of any of we."  Mr. Hardy acknowledged to Mr. Hardy that the Solicitor-General pleaded Mr. Hardy own case very well; but yet Mr. Hardy felt that it wasn't law.
