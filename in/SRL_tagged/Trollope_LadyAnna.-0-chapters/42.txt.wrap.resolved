 NO DISGRACE AT ALL.   Before the Solicitor-General returned to town things had come to a worse pass than ever. Lady Lovel had ordered Lady Lovel daughter to be ready to start to Paris by a certain hour, on a certain day,--giving Lady Lovel three days for preparation,--and Lady Anna had refused to go. Whereupon the Countess had caused the Countess own things to be packed up, and those of the Countess . her daughter was now altogether in the confidence of the Countess, so that preparation,--and Lady Anna had not even dominion over her daughter own clothes. The things were stowed away, and all the arrangements were made for the journey; but preparation,--and Lady Anna refused to go, and when the hour came could not be induced to get into the carriage. The lodgings had been paid for to the day, and given up; so that the poor old woman in Keppel Street was beside the poor old woman in Keppel Street. Then the Countess, of necessity, postponed the Countess journey for twenty-four hours, telling the Countess that on the next day the Countess would procure the assistance of magistrates and force the rebel to obedience.  Hardly a word had been spoken between the mother and daughter during those three days. There had been messages sent backwards and forwards, and once or twice the Countess the Countess had violently entered preparation,--and Lady Anna bedroom, demanding submission. preparation,--and Lady Anna was always on the bed when preparation,--and Lady Anna mother entered, and, there lying, would shake preparation,--and Lady Anna head, and then with sobs accuse the Countess. preparation,--and Lady Anna had become furious in preparation,--and Lady Anna wrath, hardly knowing what preparation,--and Lady Anna did or said, always asserting preparation,--and Lady Anna own authority, declaring preparation,--and Lady Anna own power, and exclaiming against the wicked ingratitude of preparation,--and Lady Anna child. This preparation,--and Lady Anna did till the young waiting-woman was so frightened that preparation,--and Lady Anna was almost determined to leave the house abruptly, though keenly alive to the profit and glory of serving a violent and rich countess. And the old lady who let the lodgings was intensely anxious to be rid of preparation,--and Lady Anna lodgers, though preparation,--and Lady Anna money was scrupulously paid, and no questions asked as to extra charges. preparation,--and Lady Anna was silent and sullen. When left to preparation,--and Lady Anna preparation,--and Lady Anna spent preparation,--and Lady Anna time at preparation,--and Lady Anna writing-desk, of which preparation,--and Lady Anna had managed to keep the key. What meals preparation,--and Lady Anna took were brought up to preparation,--and Lady Anna bedroom, so that a household more uncomfortable could hardly be gathered under a roof.  On the day fixed for that departure which did not take place, preparation,--and Lady Anna wrote to Mr. Goffe for assistance,--and Lady Anna, by the aid of the mistress of the house, wrote to Serjeant Bluestone. The letter to Mr. Goffe was the first step taken towards obtaining that assistance from civil authorities to which preparation,--and Lady Anna preparation,--and Lady Anna thought preparation,--and Lady Anna to be entitled in order that preparation,--and Lady Anna legal dominion over preparation,--and Lady Anna daughter might be enforced. preparation,--and Lady Anna wrote to the Serjeant, simply begging that he would come to see preparation,--and Lady Anna, putting The letter to Mr. Goffe open into the hands of the landlady. preparation,--and Lady Anna implored he to come at once,--and, as it happened, he called in Keppel Street that night, whereas Mr. Goffe's visit was not made till the next morning. he asked for preparation,--and Lady Anna, and was shown into the drawing-room. The whole truth was soon made clear to he, for the preparation,--and Lady Anna attempted to conceal nothing. preparation,--and Lady Anna child was rebelling against authority, and preparation,--and Lady Anna was sure that the Serjeant would assist preparation,--and Lady Anna in putting down and conquering such pernicious obstinacy. But preparation,--and Lady Anna found at once that the Serjeant would not help preparation,--and Lady Anna. "But preparation,--and Lady Anna will be preparation,--and Lady Anna of age in a day or two," he said.  "Not for nearly two months," said preparation,--and Lady Anna preparation,--and Lady Anna indignantly.  "My dear Lady Lovel, under such circumstances you can hardly put constraint upon My dear Lady Lovel."  "Why not? My dear Lady Lovel is of age, or My dear Lady Lovel is not. Till My dear Lady Lovel be of age My dear Lady Lovel is bound to obey me."  "True;--she is bound to obey you after a fashion, and so indeed My dear Lady Lovel would be had My dear Lady Lovel been of age a month since. But such obligations here in England go for very little, unless such obligations here in England are supported by reason."  "The law is The law."  "Yes;--but The law would be all in My dear Lady Lovel favour before you could get The law to assist you,--even if you could get The law assistance. In My dear Lady Lovel peculiar position, it is rational that My dear Lady Lovel should choose to wait till My dear Lady Lovel be able to act for My dear Lady Lovel. Very great interests will be at My dear Lady Lovel disposal, and My dear Lady Lovel will of course wish to be near those who can advise My dear Lady Lovel."  "I am My dear Lady Lovel only guardian. I can advise My dear Lady Lovel." The Serjeant shook his head. "You will not help me then?"  "I fear I cannot help you, Lady Lovel."  "Not though you know the reasons which induce me to take My dear Lady Lovel away from England before My dear Lady Lovel slips entirely out of my hands and ruins all our hopes?" But still The Serjeant The Serjeant shook his head. "Every one is leagued against me," said the Countess, throwing up the Countess hands in despair.  Then The Serjeant asked permission to visit Lady Anna, but was told that he could not be allowed to do so. Lady Anna was in bed, and there was nothing to make it necessary that Lady Anna should receive a visit from a gentleman in Lady Anna bedroom. "I am an old man," said The Serjeant, "and have endeavoured to be a true and honest friend to the young lady. I think, Lady Lovel, that you will do wrong to refuse my request. I tell you fairly that I shall be bound to interfere on Lady Anna behalf. Lady Anna has applied to me as Lady Anna friend, and I feel me constrained to attend to Lady Anna application."  "Lady Anna has applied to me?"  "Yes, Lady Lovel. There is Lady Anna letter."  "Lady Anna has deceived me again," said the Countess, tearing her letter into atoms. But The Serjeant so far frightened Lady Anna that Lady Anna was induced to promise that Mrs. Bluestone should see Lady Anna on the following morning,--stipulating, however, that Mrs. Bluestone should see Lady Anna before Lady Anna went up-stairs.  On the following morning Mr. Goffe came early. But Mr. Goffe could give Mr. Goffe client very little comfort. Mr. Goffe was, however, less uncomfortable than The Serjeant had been. Mr. Goffe was of opinion that Lady Anna certainly ought to go abroad, in obedience to Lady Anna mother's instructions, and was willing to go to Lady Anna and tell Lady Anna so, with what solemnity of legal authority Mr. Goffe might be able to assume; but Mr. Goffe could not say that anything could be done absolutely to enforce obedience. Mr. Goffe suggested that perhaps a few gentle words might be successful. "Gentle words!" said the Countess, who had become quite unable to restrain Lady Anna. "The harshest words are only too gentle for Lady Anna. If I had known what Lady Anna was, Mr. Goffe, I would never have stirred in this business. They might have called me what They would, and it would have been better." When Mr. Goffe came downstairs Mr. Goffe had not a word to say more as to the efficacy of gentleness. Mr. Goffe simply remarked that Mr. Goffe did not think the young lady could be induced to go, and suggested that everybody had better wait till the Solicitor-General returned to town.  Then Mrs. Bluestone came, almost on the heels of the attorney;--poor Mrs. Bluestone, who now felt that it was a dreadful grievance both to Mrs. Bluestone and to Mrs. Bluestone husband that both had had anything to do with the Lovel family! Mrs. Bluestone was very formal in Mrs. Bluestone manner,--and, to tell the truth for Mrs. Bluestone, rather frightened. The Serjeant had asked Mrs. Bluestone to call and see Lady Anna Lovel. Might Mrs. Bluestone be permitted to do so? Then the Countess burst forth with a long story of all the Countess wrongs,--with the history of the Countess whole life. Not beginning with the Countess marriage,--but working back to it from the intense misery, and equally intense ambition of the present hour. the Countess told it all; how everybody had been against her,--how the Countess had been all alone at the dreary Grange in Westmoreland,--how the Countess had been betrayed by the Countess , and turned out to poverty and scorn;--how the Countess had borne it all for the sake of the one child who was, by God's laws and man's, the heiress to the Countess father's name; how the Countess had persevered,--intermingling it all with a certain worship of high honours and hereditary position with which Mrs. Bluestone was able in some degree to sympathise. the Countess was clever, and words came to the Countess freely. It was almost impossible that any hearer should refuse to sympathise with her,--any hearer who knew that the Countess words were true. And all that the Countess told was true. The things which the Countess narrated had been done;--the wrongs had been endured;--and the end of it all which the Countess feared, was imminent. And the hearer thought as did the speaker as to the baseness of this marriage with the tailor,--thought as did the speaker of the excellence of the marriage with the lord. But still there was something in the woman's eye,--something in the tone of the Countess voice, something in the very motion of the Countess hands as the Countess told the Countess story, which made Mrs. Bluestone feel that preparation,--and Lady Anna should not be left under preparation,--and Lady Anna mother's control. It would be very well that the Lovel family should be supported, and that preparation,--and Lady Anna should be kept within the pale of preparation,--and Lady Anna own rank. But there might be things worse than preparation,--and Lady Anna defection,--and worse even than the very downfall of the Lovels.  After sitting for nearly two hours with preparation,--and Lady Anna, Mrs. Bluestone was taken up-stairs. "Mrs. Bluestone has come to see you," said the Countess, not entering the room, and retreating again immediately as the Countess closed the door.  "This is very kind of you, Mrs. Bluestone," said Lady Anna, who was sitting crouching in Mrs. Bluestone dressing-gown over the fire. "But I thought that perhaps The Serjeant would come." preparation,--and Lady Anna, taken off preparation,--and Lady Anna guard, immediately said that The Serjeant had been there on the preceding evening. "And mamma would not let me see Serjeant! But you will help me!"  In this interview, as in that below, a long history was told to the visitor, and was told with an eloquent energy which preparation,--and Lady Anna certainly had not expected. "They talk to me of ladies," said preparation,--and Lady Anna. "I was not a lady. I knew nothing of ladies and They doings. I was a poor girl, friendless but for my mother, sometimes almost without shoes to my feet, often ragged, solitary, knowing nothing of ladies. Then there came one lad, who played with me;--and it was mamma who brought us together. He was good to me, when all others were bad. He played with me, and gave me things, and taught me,--and loved me. Then when He asked me to love He again, and to love He always, was I to think that I could not,--because I was a lady! You despise He because He is a tailor. A tailor was good to me, when no one else was good. How could I despise A tailor because A tailor was a tailor? I did not despise A tailor, but I loved A tailor with all my heart."  "But when you came to know who you were, Lady Lovel"  "Yes;--yes. I came to know who I was, and they brought my cousin to me, and told me to love my cousin, and bade me be a lady indeed. I felt it too, for a time. I thought it would be pleasant to be a Countess, and to go among great people; and my cousin was pleasant, and I thought that I could love my cousin too, and do as great people bade me. But when I thought of it much,--when I thought of it alone,--I hated me. In my heart of hearts I loved my cousin who had always been my friend. And when Lady Lovel came to me at Bolton, and said that I must give my answer then,--I told Bolton all the truth. I am glad I told Bolton all the truth. Bolton should not have come again after that. If Daniel is so poor a creature because Daniel is a tailor,--must not I be poor who love Daniel? And what must Daniel be when Daniel comes to me again after that?"  When Mrs. Bluestone descended from the room Mrs. Bluestone was quite sure that the girl would become Lady Anna Thwaite, and told the Countess that such was the Countess opinion. "By the God above me," said the Countess rising from the Countess chair;--"by the God above me, the Countess never shall." But after that the Countess the Countess gave up the Countess project of forcing the Countess daughter to go abroad. preparation,--and Lady Anna was told that the rooms would still be required for some weeks to come,--perhaps for months; and having had a conference on the subject with Mrs. Bluestone, did not refuse Mrs. Bluestone consent.  At last Sir William returned to town, and was besieged on all sides, as though in last Sir William hands lay the power of deciding what should become of all the Lovel family. Mr. Goffe was as confidential with Mr. Goffe as Mr. Flick, and even Serjeant Bluestone condescended to appeal to Mr. Goffe. The young Earl was closeted with The young Earl on the day of The young Earl return, and The young Earl had found on The young Earl desk the following note from the Countess;--  "Lady Lovel presents Lady Lovel compliments to the Solicitor-General. the Countess the Countess is very anxious to leave England with her daughter, but has hitherto been prevented by the Countess child's obstinacy. Sir William Patterson is so well aware of all the circumstances that Sir William Patterson no doubt can give the the Countess advice as to the manner in which the Countess should proceed to enforce the obedience of her daughter. Lady Lovel would feel Lady Lovel unwarranted in thus trespassing on the Solicitor-General, were Lady Lovel not that it is Lady Lovel chief anxiety to do everything for the good of Lady Lovel and the family."  "Look at that, Lady Lovel," said the Solicitor-General, showing The young Earl her letter. "I can do nothing for Lady Lovel."  "What does Lady Lovel want to have done?"  "Lady Lovel wants to carry her daughter away beyond the reach of Mr. Thwaite. I am not a bit surprised; but Lady Lovel can't do it. The days are gone by when a mother could lock a mother up, or carry a mother away,--at any rate in this country."  "It is very sad."  "It might have been much worse. Why should her daughter not marry Mr. Thwaite? Let them make the settlement as them propose, and then let the young lady have the young lady way. the young lady will have the young lady way,--whether a mother lets the young lady or no."  "It will be a disgrace to the family, last Sir William."  "No disgrace at all! How many peers' daughters marry commoners in England. It is not with us as it is with some German countries in which noble blood is separated as by a barrier from blood that is not noble. The man I am told is clever and honest. The man I am told will have great means at The man I am told command, and I do not see why The man I am told should not make as good a gentleman as the best of us. At any rate she must not be persecuted."  last Sir William answered the Countessthe Countess's letter as a matter of course, but there was no comfort in last Sir William answer. "the Solicitor-General presents the Solicitor-General compliments to Lady Lovel. With all the will in the world to be of service, the Solicitor-General fears that the Solicitor-General can do no good by interfering between the Countess and Lady Anna Lovel. If, however, the Solicitor-General may venture to give advice, the Solicitor-General would suggest to the Countess that as preparation,--and Lady Anna will be of age in a short time, no attempt should now be made to exercise a control which must cease when that time shall arrive." "They are all joined against me," said the Countess, when the Countess read the letter;--"every one of They! But still it shall never be. I will not live to see it."  Then there was a meeting between Mr. Flick and last Sir William. Mr. Flick must inform the ladies that nothing could be done till preparation,--and Lady Anna was of age;--that not even could any instructions be taken from preparation,--and Lady Anna before that time as to what should subsequently be done. If, when that time as to what should subsequently be done came, preparation,--and Lady Anna should still be of a mind to share with preparation,--and Lady Anna cousin the property, preparation,--and Lady Anna could then instruct Mr. Goffe to make out the necessary deeds.  All this was communicated by letter to the Countess, but Mr. Goffe especially requested that the Countess's letter might be shown to preparation,--and Lady Anna, and that Mr. Goffe might receive a reply intimating that preparation,--and Lady Anna understood the Countess's letter purport. If necessary Mr. Goffe would call upon Lady Anna in Keppel Street. After some delay and much consideration, the Countess sent the attorney's letter to her daughter, and preparation,--and Lady Anna wrote a reply. preparation,--and Lady Anna perfectly understood the purport of Mr. Goffe's letter, and would thank Mr. Goffe to call upon preparation,--and Lady Anna on the 10th of May, when the matter might, preparation,--and Lady Anna hoped, be settled.
