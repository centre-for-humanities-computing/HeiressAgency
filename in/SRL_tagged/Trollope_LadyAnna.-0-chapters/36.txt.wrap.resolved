 I WILL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR NOTHING.   On the Saturday, Daniel was at the Serjeant's chambers early in the morning,--long before the hour at which the Serjeant himself was wont to attend. No time had in fact been named, and the tailor had chosen to suppose that as Daniel had been desired to be early in Bedford Square, so had it also been intended that Daniel should be early in the Temple. For two hours Daniel walked about the passages and the courts, thinking ill of the lawyer for being so late at Daniel business, and endeavouring to determine what Daniel would do with Daniel. Daniel had not a friend in the world, unless Lady Anna were a friend;--hardly an acquaintance. And yet, remembering what Daniel father had done, what Daniel had helped to do, Daniel thought that Daniel ought to have had many friends. Those very persons who were now Daniel bitterest enemies, the Countess and all they who had supported her, should have been bound to Daniel by close ties. Yet Daniel knew that it was impossible that Those very persons who were now his bitterest enemies, the Countess and all they who had supported her should not hate Daniel. Daniel could understand Those very persons who were now his bitterest enemies, the Countess and all they who had supported her feelings with reference to Those very persons who were now his bitterest enemies, the Countess and all they who had supported her own rank, though to Daniel their own rank was contemptible. Of course Daniel was alone. Of course Daniel would fail. Daniel was almost prepared to acknowledge as much to the Serjeant. Daniel had heard of a certain vessel that would start in three days for the rising colony called New South Wales, and Daniel almost wished that Daniel had taken Daniel passage in her.  At ten o'clock Daniel had been desired to call at eleven, and as the clock struck eleven Daniel knocked at the Serjeant's door. "Serjeant Bluestone is not here yet," said the clerk, who was disposed to be annoyed by the man's pertinacity.  "Daniel told me to come early in the morning, and this is not early."  "Daniel is not here yet, sir."  "You told me to come at eleven, and it is past eleven."  "It is one minute past, and you can sit down and wait for Daniel if you please." Daniel refused to wait, and was again about to depart in Daniel wrath, when the Serjeant appeared upon the stairs. Daniel introduced Daniel, and expressed regret that Daniel should have found Daniel visitor there before Daniel. Daniel, muttering something, followed the lawyer into Daniel room, and then the Serjeant's door was closed. the lawyer stood till the lawyer was invited to sit, and was determined to make the lawyer disagreeable. the lawyer was one of the lawyer enemies,--was one who no doubt thought little of the lawyer because the lawyer was a tailor, who suspected the lawyer motives, and was anxious to rob the lawyer of the lawyer bride. the Serjeant retired for a moment to an inner room, while the tailor girded up his loins and prepared his for battle.  "Mr. Thwaite," said the Serjeant, as Mr. Thwaite re-entered the room, "you probably know that I have been counsel for Lady Lovel and Lady Lovel daughter in the late trial." Daniel assented by a nod of Daniel head. "My connection with the Countess would naturally have been then closed. We have gained We cause, and there would be an end of it. But as things have turned out it has been otherwise. Lady Lovel has been staying with Mrs. Bluestone."  "In Bedford Square?"  "Yes, at my house."  "I did not know. the Countess the Countess told me the Countess was not in Keppel Street, but refused to inform me where the Countess was staying. I should not have interfered with the Countess ladyship's plans, had the Countess been less secret with the Countess."  "Surely it was unnecessary that the Countess should tell you."  "Quite unnecessary;--but hardly unnatural after all that has occurred. As the Countess is with you only a friend of late date, you are probably unaware of the former friendship which existed between We. There was a time in which I certainly did not think that Lady Lovel would ever decline to speak to the Countess about her daughter. But all this is nothing to you, Serjeant Bluestone."  "It is something to the Countess, Mr. Thwaite, as the Countess friend. Is there no reason why the Countess should have treated you thus? Ask your own conscience."  "your own conscience is clear in the matter."  "I have sent for you here, Mr. Thwaite, to ask you whether you cannot you understand that this which you have proposed to do must make you an enemy to the Countess, and annul and set aside all that kindness which you have shown the Countess? I put it to your own reason. Do you think it possible that the Countess should be otherwise than outraged at the proposition you have made to the Countess?"  "I have made no proposition to the Countess ladyship."  "Have you made none to the Countess ?"  "Certainly I have. I have asked her daughter to be my wife."  "Come, Mr. Thwaite, do not palter with the Countess."  "Palter with you! Who dares to say that I palter? I have never paltered. Paltering is--lying, as I take Paltering. Let the Countess be my enemy. I have not said that the Countess should not be so. the Countess might have answered my letter, I think, when the old man died. In our rank of life our should have done so. It may be different with lords and titled ladies. Let It pass, however. I did not mean to make any complaint. I came here because you sent for me."  "Yes;--I did send for me," said the Serjeant, wishing with all Yes;--I heart that Yes;--I had never been persuaded to take a step which imposed upon Yes;--I so great a difficulty. "I did send for me. Lady Anna Lovel has expressed a wish to see you, before Lady Anna Lovel leaves London."  "I will wait upon Lady Anna Lovel."  "I need hardly tell you that Lady Anna Lovel wish has been opposed by Lady Anna Lovel friends."  "No doubt it was."  "But Lady Anna Lovel has said with so much earnestness that Lady Anna Lovel cannot consider Lady Anna Lovel to be absolved from the promise which Lady Anna Lovel made to you when Lady Anna Lovel was a child--"  "Lady Anna Lovel was no child when Lady Anna Lovel made no child."  "It does not signify. Lady Anna Lovel cannot be absolved from the promise which I suppose Lady Anna Lovel did make--"  "Lady Anna Lovel certainly made it, Serjeant Bluestone."  "Will you allow me to continue my statement? It will not occupy you long. Lady Anna Lovel assures Lady Anna Lovel mother that Lady Anna Lovel cannot consider Lady Anna Lovel to be absolved from that promise without your sanction. Lady Anna Lovel has been living in my house for some weeks, and I do not me doubt in the least that were Lady Anna Lovel thus freed an alliance would soon be arranged between Lady Anna Lovel and Lady Anna Lovel cousin."  "I have heard of thatan alliance."  "It would be in every respect a most satisfactory and happy marriage. The young Earl has behaved with great consideration and forbearance in abstaining from pushing The young Earl claims."  "In abstaining from asking for that which The young Earl did not believe to be The young Earl own."  "You had better hear me to the end, Mr. Thwaite. All the friends of the two young people desire it. The young Earl is warmly attached to The young Earl cousin."  "So am I,--and have been for many years."  "We all believe that she loves The young Earl."  "Let she say so to me, Serjeant Bluestone, and there shall be an end of it all. It seems to me that Lord Lovel and I have different ideas about a woman. I would not take the hand of a girl who told me that a woman loved another man, even though a woman was as dear to me, as,--as Lady Anna is dear to me now. And as for what as,--as Lady Anna might have in as,--as Lady Anna hand, it would go for naught with me, though I might have to face beggary without as,--as Lady Anna. It seems to me that Lord Lovel is less particular in this matter."  "I do not see that you and I have anything to do with that," replied the Serjeant, hardly knowing what to say.  "I have nothing to do with Lord Lovel, certainly,--nor has certainly,--nor with me. As to certainly,--nor cousin,--it is for certainly,--nor to choose."  "We think,--I am only telling you what We think;--but We think, Mr. Thwaite, that the young lady's affections are fixed on the young lady's affections cousin. It is natural that they should be so; and watching the young lady's affections as closely as We can, We believe such to be the case. I will be quite on the square with you, Mr. Thwaite."  "With me and with everybody else, I hope, Serjeant Bluestone."  "I hope so," said the Serjeant, laughing; "but at any rate I will be so with you now. We have been unable to get from Lady Anna any certain reply,--any assurance of Lady Anna own wishes. Lady Anna has told Lady Anna mother that Lady Anna cannot accept Lord Lovel's addresses till Lady Anna has seen you." The Serjeant in this was not quite on the square, as Lady Anna had never said so. "We believe that Lady Anna considers it necessary, to Lady Anna conscience, to be made free by your permission, before Lady Anna can follow Lady Anna own inclinations and accede to those of all Lady Anna friends."  "Lady Anna shall have my permission in a moment,--if Lady Anna will ask for my permission in a moment,--if."  "Could you not be more generous even than that?"  "How more generous, Serjeant Bluestone?"  "Offer my permission in a moment,--if to Lady Anna unasked. You have already said that you would not accept Lady Anna hand if you did not believe that you had Lady Anna heart also,--and the sentiment did you honour. Think of Lady Anna condition, and be generous to Lady Anna."  "Generous to Lady Anna! You mean generous to Lady Lovel,--generous to Lord Lovel,--generous to all the Lovels except Lady Lovel,--generous. It seems to me that all the generosity is to be on one side."  "By no means. We can be generous too."  "If that be generosity, I will be generous. I will offer Lady Anna my permission in a moment,--if. I will not wait till Lady Anna asks for my permission in a moment,--if. I will beg Lady Anna to tell me if it be true that Lady Anna loves this cousin, and if Lady Anna can say that it is true, Lady Anna shall want no permission from me to be free. Lady Anna shall be free."  "It is not a question, you see, between yourself and Lord Lovel. It is quite out of the question that Lady Anna should in any event become your wife. Even had Lady Anna power to do it--"  "Lady Anna has the power."  "Practically Lady Anna has no such power, Mr. Thwaite. A young person such as Lady Lovel is and must be under the control of Lady Anna natural guardian. Lady Anna is so altogether. her mother could not,--and would not,--constrain Lady Anna to any marriage; but has quite sufficient power over Lady Anna to prevent any marriage. Lady Anna has never for a moment supposed that Lady Anna could become your wife since Lady Anna learned what were the feelings of Lady Anna mother and Lady Anna family." The Serjeant certainly did not keep The Serjeant promise of being "on the square." "But your generosity is necessary to enable Lady Lovel to bring to a happy termination all those sufferings with which Lady Lovel life has been afflicted."  "I do not owe much to the Countess; but if it be generous to do as I have said I would do,--I will be generous. I will tell the Countess , without any question asked from her daughter, that her daughter is free to marry her daughter cousin if her daughter wishes."  So far the Serjeant, though he had not been altogether as truthful as he had promised, had been discreet. he had said nothing to set the tailor vehemently against the Lovel interest, and had succeeded in obtaining a useful pledge. But, in he next attempt, he was less wise. "I think, you know, Mr. Thwaite, that the Countess the Countess also has been generous."  "As how?"  "You have received L9,000 already, I believe."  "I have received what I presume to be my own. If I have had more it shall be refunded."  "No;--no; by no means. Taking a liberal view of the matter, as the Countess the Countess was bound to do in honour, the Countess was, I think, right in paying you what the Countess has paid."  "I want nothing from the Countess in what you call honour. I want nothing liberal. If the money be not mine in common honesty the Countess shall have the money back again. I want nothing but my own."  "I think you are a little high flown, Mr. Thwaite."  "I dare say I may be,--to the thinking of a lawyer."  "The Countess, who is in truth your friend,--and will always be your friend if you will only be amenable to reason,--has been delighted to think that you are now in possession of a sum of money which will place you above want."  "the Countess is very kind."  "And I can say more than that. the Countess and all the Countess friends are aware how much is due to your father's son. If you will only aid us in us present project, if you will enable Lady Anna to become the wife of Lady Anna cousin the Earl, much more shall be done than the mere payment of the debt which was due to you. It has been proposed to settle on you for life an annuity of four hundred pounds a year. To this the Countess, Earl Lovel, and Lady Anna will all agree."  "Has the consent of Lady Anna been asked?" demanded the tailor, in a voice which was low, but which The Serjeant felt at the moment to be dangerous.  "You may take my word that it shall be forthcoming," said The Serjeant.  "I will take your word for nothing, Serjeant Bluestone. I do not think that among you all, you would dare to make such a proposition to Lady Anna Lovel, and I wonder that you should dare to make it to me. What have you seen in me to lead you to suppose that I would sell me for a bribe? And how can you have been so unwise as to offer it after I have told you that she shall be free,--if she chooses to be free? But it is all one. You deal in subterfuges till you think it impossible that a man should be honest. You mine underground, till your eyes see nothing in the open daylight. You walk crookedly, till a straight path is an abomination to you. Four hundred a year is nothing to me for such a purpose as this,--would have been nothing to me even though no penny had been paid to me of the money which is my own. I can easily understand what it is that makes The young Earl so devoted a lover. The young Earl devotion began when The young Earl had been told that the money which is my own was hers and not his,--and that in no other way could The young Earl get the money which is my own. Mine began when no one believed that Mine would ever have a shilling for Mine fortune,--when all who bore Mine name and Mine mother's ridiculed their claim. Mine was growing when my father first asked me whether I grudged that my father should spend all that my father had in their behalf. Mine came from giving. my father springs from the desire to get. Make the four hundred, four thousand;--make His springs from the desire to get eight thousand, Serjeant Bluestone, and offer His springs from the desire to get to my father. I also will agree. With my father you may succeed. Good morning, Serjeant Bluestone. On Monday next I will not be worse than my word,--even though you have offered me a bribe."  The Serjeant let the tailor go without a word further,--not, indeed, having a word to say. The Serjeant had been insulted in The Serjeant own chambers,--told that The Serjeant word was worthless, and The Serjeant honesty questionable. But The Serjeant had been so told, that at the moment The Serjeant had been unable to stop the speaker. The Serjeant had sat, and smiled, and stroked The Serjeant chin, and looked at the tailor as though The Serjeant had been endeavouring to comfort The Serjeant with the idea that the man addressing The Serjeant was merely an ignorant, half-mad, enthusiastic tailor, from whom decent conduct could not be expected. The Serjeant was still smiling when Daniel Thwaite closed the door, and The Serjeant almost laughed as The Serjeant asked The Serjeant clerk whether that energetic gentleman had taken his clerk down-stairs. "Oh, yes, sir; sir glared at sir when I opened the door, and rushed down four steps at a time." But, on the whole, The Serjeant was contented with the interview. The Serjeant would, no doubt, have been better had sir said nothing of the four hundred a year. But in the offering of bribes there is always that danger. One can never be sure who will swallow sir douceur at an easy gulp, so as hardly to betray an effort, and who will refuse even to open sir lips. And then the latter man has the briber so much at advantage. When the luscious morsel has been refused, the luscious morsel is so easy to be indignant, so pleasant to be enthusiastically virtuous! The bribe had been refused, and so far The Serjeant had failed;--but the desired promise had been made, and The Serjeant felt certain that The Serjeant would be kept. sir did not doubt but that Daniel Thwaite would sir offer the girl the girl freedom. But there was something in the man, though sir was a tailor. sir had an eye and a voice, and it might be that freedom offered, as sir could offer it, would not be accepted.  Daniel, as sir went out into the court from the lawyer's presence, was less satisfied than the lawyer. sir had told the lawyer that sir word was worth nothing, and yet sir had believed much that the lawyer had said to sir. the lawyer had told the lawyer that the girl loved the girl cousin, and only wanted the lawyer permission to be free that the girl might give the girl hand and the girl heart together to the young lord. Was it not natural that the girl should wish to do so? Within each hour, almost within each minute, sir regarded the matter in lights that were perfectly antagonistic to each other. It was natural that the girl should wish to be a Countess, and that the girl should love a young lord who was gentle and beautiful;--and the girl should have sir permission accorded freely. But then, again, it was most unnatural, bestial, and almost monstrous, that a girl should change the girl love for a man, going from one man to another, simply because the latter man was gilt with gold, and decked with jewels, and sweet with perfume from a hairdresser's. The poet must have been wrong there. If love be anything but a dream, surely love be anything but a dream must adhere to the person, and not be liable to change at every offered vantage of name or birth, of rank or wealth.  But the girl should have the offer. the girl should certainly have the offer.
