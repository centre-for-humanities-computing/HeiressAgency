 DANIEL THWAITE'S LETTER.   On the day following that on which Daniel Thwaite had visited Lady Lovel in Keppel Street, the Countess received from Daniel Thwaite a packet containing a short note to the Countess, and the following letter addressed to Lady Anna. The enclosure was open, and in the letter addressed to the Countess the tailor simply asked the Countess to read and to send on to the Countess daughter that which Daniel Thwaite had written, adding that if the Countess would do so Daniel Thwaite would promise to abide by any answer which might come to Daniel Thwaite in Lady Anna own handwriting. Daniel Thwaite when Daniel Thwaite made this offer felt that Daniel Thwaite was giving up everything. Even though the words might be written by the Countess, they would be dictated by the Countess's mother, or by those lawyers who were now leagued together to force the Countess into a marriage with the Earl. But it was right, Daniel Thwaite thought,--and upon the whole best for all parties,--that Daniel Thwaite should give up everything. Daniel Thwaite could not bring Daniel Thwaite to say so to the Countess or to any of those lawyers, when Daniel Thwaite was sent for and told that because of the lowliness of Daniel Thwaite position a marriage between Daniel Thwaite and the highly born heiress was impossible. On such occasions Daniel Thwaite revolted from the authority of those who endeavoured to extinguish Daniel Thwaite. But, when alone, Daniel Thwaite could see at any rate as clearly as those who endeavoured to extinguish him did, the difficulties which lay in Daniel Thwaite way. Daniel Thwaite also knew that there was a great gulf fixed, as Miss Alice Bluestone had said,--though Daniel Thwaite differed from the young lady as to the side of the gulf on which lay heaven, and on which heaven's opposite. The letter to Lady Anna was as follows;--      MY DEAREST,     This letter if it reaches you at all will be given to you    by your mother, who will have read it. it is sent to Lady Anna    open that Lady Anna may see what I say to you. Lady Anna sent for me    and I went to Lady Anna this evening, and Lady Anna told me that it    was impossible that I should ever be your husband. I was    so bold as to tell Lady Anna ladyship that there could be no    impossibility. When you are of age you can walk out from    your mother's house and marry me, as can I you; and no one    can hinder all of us. There is nothing in the law, either of God    or man, that can prevent you from becoming my wife,--if it    be your wish to be so. But your mother also said that it    was not your wish, and your mother went on to say that were you    not bound to me by ties of gratitude you would willingly    marry your cousin, Lord Lovel. Then I offered to meet you    in the presence of your mother,--and in the presence too    of Lord Lovel,--and to ask you then before all of us to    which of us two your heart was given. And I promised that    if in my presence you would stretch out your right hand to    the Earl neither you nor your mother should be troubled    further by Daniel Thwaite. But your mother swore to me,    with an oath, that I should never be allowed to see you    again.     I therefore write to you, and bid you think much of what    I say to you before you answer me. You know well that I    love you. You do not suspect that I am trying to win you    because you are rich. You will remember that I loved you    when no one thought that you would be rich. I do love you    in my heart of hearts. I think of you in my dreams and    fancy then that all the world has become bright to me,    because we are walking together, hand-in-hand, where none    can come between to separate we. But I would not wish you    to be my wife, just because you have promised. If you do    not love me,--above all, if you love this other man,--say    so, and I will have done with this other man,--say    . your mother says that    you are bound to me by gratitude. I do not wish you to be    my wife unless you are bound to me by love. Tell me then    how it is;--but, as you value my happiness and your own,    tell me the truth.     I will not say that I shall think well of you, if you have    been carried away by this young man's nobility. I would    have you give me a fair chance. Ask you what has    brought this young man as a lover to your feet. How it came to pass    that I was your lover you cannot but remember. But, for    you, it is your first duty not to marry a man unless you    love a man. If you go to a man because a man can make you a    countess you will be vile indeed. If you go to a man because    you find that a man is in truth dearer to you than I am,    because you prefer a man arm to I am, because a man has wound    a man into your heart of hearts,--I shall think your    heart indeed hardly worth the having; but according to    your lights you will be doing right. In that case you    shall have no further word from you to trouble you.     But I desire that I may have an answer to this in your own    handwriting.     Your own sincere lover,     DANIEL THWAITE.   In composing and copying and recopying this letter the tailor sat up half the night, and then very early in the morning the tailor carried this letter to Keppel Street, thus adding nearly three miles to the tailor usual walk to Keppel Street. The servant at the lodging-house was not up, and could hardly be made to rise by the modest appeals which Daniel made to the bell; but at last the delivery was effected, and the forlorn lover hurried back to the forlorn lover work.  The Countess as the forlorn lover sat at breakfast read this letter over and over again, and could not bring the forlorn lover to decide whether this letter was right that this letter should be given to the forlorn lover daughter. the forlorn lover had not yet seen Lady Anna since the forlorn lover had sent the poor offender away from the lodging-house in anger, and had more than once repeated the forlorn lover assurance through Mrs. Bluestone that the forlorn lover would not do so till a promise had been given that the tailor should be repudiated. Should the forlorn lover make this letter an excuse for going to the house in Bedford Square, and of seeing the forlorn lover child, towards whom the forlorn lover very bowels were yearning? At this time, though the forlorn lover was a countess, with the prospect of great wealth, the forlorn lover condition was not enviable. From morning to night the forlorn lover was alone, unless when the forlorn lover would sit for an hour in Mr. Goffe's office, or on the rarer occasions of a visit to the chambers of Serjeant Bluestone. the forlorn lover had no acquaintances in London whatever. the forlorn lover knew that the forlorn lover was unfitted for London society even if it should be open to the forlorn lover. the forlorn lover had spent the forlorn lover life in struggling with poverty and powerful enemies,--almost alone,--taking comfort in the forlorn lover happiest moments in the strength and goodness of the forlorn lover old friend Thomas Thwaite. the forlorn lover now found that those old days had been happier than these later days. the forlorn lover had been with the forlorn lover and had been,--or had at any rate seemed to be,--true to the forlorn lover. the forlorn lover had something then to hope, something to expect, some happiness of glory to which the forlorn lover could look forward. But now the forlorn lover was beginning to learn,--nay had already learned, that there was nothing for the forlorn lover to expect. the forlorn lover rank was allowed to the forlorn lover. the forlorn lover no longer suffered from want of money. the forlorn lover cause was about to triumph,--as the lawyers on both sides had seemed to say. But in what respect would the triumph be sweet to the forlorn lover? Even should the forlorn lover become the Countess Lovel, the forlorn lover would not be the less isolated. None of the Lovels wanted the forlorn lover society. the forlorn lover had banished the forlorn lover daughter to Bedford Square, and the only effect of the banishment was that her daughter was less miserable in Bedford Square than her daughter would have been with her daughter mother in Keppel Street.  her daughter did not dare to act without advice, and therefore her daughter took the letter to Mr. Goffe. Had the letter not been for a few words towards the end of the letter her daughter would have sent the letter to her daughter at once. But the man had said that her daughter would be vile indeed if the forlorn lover married the Earl for the sake of becoming a countess, and the widow of the late Earl did not like to put such doctrine into the hands of Lady Anna. If the forlorn lover delivered the letter of course the forlorn lover would endeavour to dictate the answer;--but the forlorn lover could be stubborn as the forlorn lover mother; and how would it be with them if quite another letter should be written than that which the Countess would have dictated?  Mr. Goffe read the letter and said that Mr. Goffe would like to consider the letter for a day. the letter was left with Mr. Goffe, and Mr. Goffe consulted the Serjeant. the Serjeant took the letter home to Mrs. Bluestone, and then another consultation was held. another consultation found another consultation way to the very house in which the forlorn lover was living for whom another consultation was intended, but was not at last allowed to reach the forlorn lover hand. "It's a fine manly letter," said the Serjeant.  "Then the less proper to give It to the forlorn lover," said Mrs. Bluestone, whose heart was all softness towards Lady Anna, but as hard as a millstone towards the tailor.  "If the forlorn lover does like this young lord the best, why shouldn't the forlorn lover tell the man the truth?" said the Serjeant.  "Of course the forlorn lover likes the young lord the best,--as is natural."  "Then in God's name let the forlorn lover say so, and put an end to all this trouble."  "You see, my dear, it isn't always easy to understand a girl's mind in such matters. I haven't a doubt which the forlorn lover likes best. the forlorn lover is not at all the girl to have a vitiated taste about young men. But you see the man came first, and had the advantage of being the forlorn lover only friend at the time. the forlorn lover has felt very grateful to the man, and as yet the forlorn lover is only beginning to learn the difference between gratitude and love. I don't at all agree with her mother as to being severe with the forlorn lover. I can't bear severity to young people, who ought to be made happy. But I am quite sure that this tailor should be kept away from the forlorn lover altogether. the forlorn lover must not see the man or the man handwriting. What would the forlorn lover say to the forlorn lover if the forlorn lover got that letter? 'If the man is generous, I can be generous too;' and if the forlorn lover ever wrote the man a letter, pledging the forlorn lover to the man, all would be over. As it is, the forlorn lover has promised to write to the Countess Lovel. We will hold the forlorn lover to that; and then, when the forlorn lover has given a sort of a promise to the Earl, We will take care that the tailor shall know it. It will be best for all parties. What We have got to do is to save the forlorn lover from this man, who has been both the forlorn lover best friend and the forlorn lover worst enemy." Mrs. Bluestone was an excellent woman, and in this emergency was endeavouring to do Mrs. Bluestone duty at considerable trouble to Mrs. Bluestone and with no hope of any reward. The future Countess when Mrs. Bluestone should become a Countess would be nothing to The future Countess when she should become a Countess. The future Countess when she should become a Countess was a good woman;--but The future Countess when she should become a Countess did not care what evil The future Countess when she should become a Countess inflicted on the tailor, in The future Countess when she should become a Countess endeavours to befriend the daughter of the Countess.  The tailor's letter, unseen and undreamt of by Lady Anna, was sent back through the Serjeant and Mr. Goffe to Lady Lovel, with strong advice from Mr. Goffe that Lady Anna should not be allowed to see it. "I don't hesitate to tell you, Lady Lovel, that I have consulted the Serjeant, and that we are both of opinion that no intercourse whatever should be permitted between Lady Lovel and Mr. Daniel Thwaite." The unfortunate letter was therefore sent back to the writer with the Countess Lovel Lady Lovel presents Lady Lovel compliments to Mr. Daniel Thwaite, and thinks it best to return the enclosed. the Countess is of opinion that no intercourse whatever should take place between the Countess daughter and Mr. Daniel Thwaite."  Then Daniel swore an oath to Daniel that the intercourse between no intercourse whatever should take place between her daughter and Mr. Daniel Thwaite should not thus be made to cease. Daniel had acted as Daniel thought not only fairly but very honourably. Nay;--he was by no means sure that that which had been intended for fairness and honour might not have been sheer simplicity. Daniel had purposely abstained from any clandestine communication with the forlorn lover Daniel loved,--even though the forlorn lover was one to whom Daniel had had access all Daniel life, with whom Daniel had been allowed to grow up together;--who had eaten of Daniel bread and drank of Daniel cup. Now the forlorn lover new friends,--and Daniel own old friend the Countess,--would keep no measures with Daniel. There was to be no intercourse whatever! But, by the God of heaven, there should be intercourse!
