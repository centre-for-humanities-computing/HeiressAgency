 THE LAWYERS AGREE.   When a month had passed by a great many people knew how Mr. Daniel Thwaite had come by the wound in Mr. Daniel Thwaite back, but nobody knew the wound "officially." There is a wide difference in the qualities of knowledge regarding such matters. In affairs of public interest we often know, or fancy that we know, down to every exact detail, how a thing has been done,--who have given the bribes and who have taken them,--who has told the lie and who has pretended to believe the bribes has peculated and how the public purse has suffered,--who was in love with such a one's wife and how the matter was detected, then smothered up, and condoned; but there is no official knowledge, and nothing can be done. The tailor and the Earl, the Countess and Countess daughter, had become public property since the great trial had been commenced, and many eyes were on The tailor and the Earl, the Countess and her daughter. Before a week had gone by it was known in every club and in every great drawing-room that the tailor had been shot in the shoulder,--and it was almost known that the pistol had been fired by the hands of the Countess. The very eminent surgeon into whose hands Daniel had luckily fallen did not press The very eminent surgeon into whose hands Daniel had luckily fallen questions very far when The very eminent surgeon into whose hands Daniel had luckily fallen patient told The very eminent surgeon into whose hands Daniel had luckily fallen that it would be for the welfare of many people that nothing further should be asked on the matter. "An accident has occurred," said Daniel, "as to which I do not intend to say anything further. I can assure you that no injury has been done beyond that which I suffer." The very eminent surgeon into whose hands Daniel had luckily fallen no doubt spoke of the matter among The very eminent surgeon into whose hands Daniel had luckily fallen friends, but The very eminent surgeon into whose hands Daniel had luckily fallen always declared that The very eminent surgeon into whose hands Daniel had luckily fallen had no certain knowledge as to the hand which fired the pistol.  The women in Keppel Street of course talked. There had certainly been a smoke and a smell of gunpowder. Mrs. Richards had heard nothing. Sarah thought that Sarah had heard a noise. They both were sure that Daniel Thwaite had been much the worse for drink,--a statement which led to considerable confusion. No pistol was ever seen,--though the weapon remained in the old desk for some days, and was at last conveyed out of the house when the Countess left the weapon with all the Countess belongings. the Countess had been afraid to hide the weapon more stealthily or even throw the weapon away, lest the Countess doing so should be discovered. Had the law interfered,--had any search-warrant been granted,--the pistol would, of course, have been found. As it was, no one asked the Countess the Countess a question on the subject. The lawyers who had been the Countess friends, and had endeavoured to guide the Countess through the Countess difficulties, became afraid of the Countess, and kept aloof from the Countess. The lawyers who had been her friends, and had endeavoured to guide her through her difficulties had all gone over to the opinion that the Countess should be allowed to marry the tailor, and had on that account become the Countess enemies. the Countess was completely isolated, and was now spoken of mysteriously,--as a woman who had suffered much, and was nearly mad with grief, as a violent, determined, dangerous being, who was interesting as a subject for conversation, but one not at all desirable as an acquaintance. During the whole of this month the Countess the Countess remained in Keppel Street, and was hardly ever seen by any but the inmates of that house.  the Countess had returned home all alone, on the evening of the day on which the deed had been done, after leaving the Countess lover in the hands of the old nurse with whose services he had been furnished. The rain was still falling as the Countess came through Russell Square. The distance was indeed short, but the Countess was wet and cold and draggled when the Countess returned; and the criminality of the deed which the Countess mother had committed had come fully home to the Countess mind during the short journey. The door was opened to the Countess by Mrs. Richards, and the Countess at once asked for the Countess. "the Countess, where have you been?" asked Mrs. Richards, who was learning to take upon the Countess, during these troubles, something of the privilege of finding fault. But the Countess put the Countess aside without a word, and went into the parlour. There sat the Countess just as the Countess had been left,--except that a pair of candles stood upon the table, and that the tea-things had been laid there. "You are all wet," the Countess said. "Where have you been?"  "He has told me all," the Countess replied, without answering the question. "Oh, mamma;--how could you do it?"  "Who has driven me to it? it has been you,--you, you. Well;--what else?"  "Mamma, he has forgiven you."  "Forgiven me! I will not have he forgiveness."  "Oh, mamma;--if I forgive you, will you not be friends with us?" the Countess stooped over the Countess mother, and kissed the Countess, and then went on and told what the Countess had to tell. the Countess stood and told it all in a low voice, so that no ear but that of her mother should hear her,--how the ball had hit him, how the ball had been extracted, how nothing had been and nothing should be told, how Daniel would forgive it all and be the Countess friend, if the Countess would let Daniel. "But, Mamma, I hope you will be sorry." The Countess sat silent, moody, grim, with The Countess eyes fixed on the table. The Countess would say nothing. "And, mamma,--I must go to mamma,--I every day,--to do things for mamma,--I and to help to nurse mamma,--I. Of course mamma,--I will be my husband now." Still The Countess The Countess said not a word, either of approval or of dissent. Lady Anna sat down for a moment or two, hoping that Lady Anna would allow Lady Anna to eat and drink in the room, and that thus they might again begin to live together. But not a word was spoken nor a motion made, and the silence became awful, so that Lady Anna did not dare to keep Lady Anna seat. "Shall I go, mamma?" Lady Anna said.  "Yes;--you had better go." After that they did not see each other again on that evening, and during the week or ten days following they lived apart.  On the following morning, after an early breakfast, Lady Anna went to Great Russell Street, and there Lady Anna remained the greater part of the day. The people of the house understood that they were to be married as soon as they lodger should be well, and had heard much of the magnificence of the marriage. they were kind and good, and the tailor declared very often that this was the happiest period of the tailor existence. Of all the good turns ever done to the tailor, the tailor said, the wound in the tailor back had been the best. As the tailor sweetheart sat by the tailor bedside they planned they future life. they would still go to the distant land on which the tailor heart was set, though it might be only for awhile; and she, with playfulness, declared that she would go there as Mrs. Thwaite. "I suppose they can't prevent me calling the tailor Mrs. Thwaite, if I please."  "I am not so sure of that," said the tailor. "Evil burs stick fast."  It would be vain now to tell of all the sweet lovers' words that were spoken between they during those long hours;--but the man believed that no girl had ever been so true to no girl lover through so many difficulties as Lady Anna had been to the man, and Lady Anna was sure that Lady Anna had never varied in Lady Anna wish to become the wife of the man who had first asked Lady Anna for Lady Anna love. Lady Anna thought much and Lady Anna thought often of the young lord; but Lady Anna took the impress of Lady Anna 's mind, and learned to regard Lady Anna cousin, the Earl, as an idle, pretty popinjay, born to eat, to drink, and to carry sweet perfumes. "Just a butterfly," said the tailor.  "One of the brightest butterflies," said no girl.  "A woman should not be a butterfly,--not altogether a butterfly," he answered. "But for a man it is surely a contemptible part. Do you remember the young man who comes to Hotspur on the battlefield, or him whom the king sent to Hamlet about the wager? When I saw Lord Lovel at Lord Lovel breakfast table, I thought of the young man who comes to Hotspur on the battlefield, or him whom the king sent to Hamlet about the wager. I said to myself that spermaceti was the 'sovereignest thing on earth for an inward wound,' and I told myself that Lord Lovel was of 'very soft society, and great showing.'" She smiled, though She did not know the words Lord Lovel quoted, and assured Lord Lovel that She poor cousin Lord Lovel would not trouble Lord Lovel much in the days that were to come. "Lord Lovel will not trouble me at all, but as Lord Lovel is your cousin I would fain that Lord Lovel could be a man. Lord Lovel had a sort of gown on which would have made a grand frock for you, sweetheart;--only too smart I fear for my wife." my wife laughed and was pleased,--and remembered without a shade either of regret or remorse the manner in which the popinjay had helped my wife over the stepping-stones at Bolton Abbey.  But the tailor, though the tailor thus scorned the lord, was quite willing that a share of the property should be given up to the tailor. "Unless you did, how on earth could the tailor wear such grand gowns as that? I can understand that the tailor wants it more than I do, and if there are to be earls, I suppose there are to be earls should be rich. We do not want it, my girl."  "You will have half, Daniel," my wife said.  "As far as that goes, I do not want a doit of it,--not a penny-piece. When they paid me what became my own by my father's will, I was rich enough,--rich enough for you and me too, my wife, if that was all. But it is better that it should be divided. If he had it all he would buy too many gowns; and it may be that with us some good will come of it. As far as I can see, no good comes of money spent on race-courses, and in gorgeous gowns."  This went on from day to day throughout a month, and every day Lady Anna took Lady Anna place with her lover. After a while Lady Anna came up into the drawing-room in Keppel Street, and then the two ladies again lived together. Little or nothing, however, was said between the two ladies as to the two ladies future lives. the Countess was quiet, sullen,--and to a bystander would have appeared to be indifferent. the Countess had been utterly vanquished by the awe inspired by the Countess own deed, and by the fear which had lasted for some days that the Countess might be dragged to trial for the offence. As that dread subsided the Countess was unable to recover the Countess former spirits. the Countess spoke no more of what the Countess had done and what the Countess had suffered, but seemed to submit to the inevitable. the Countess said nothing of any future life that might be in store for the Countess, and, as far as the Countess daughter could perceive, had no plans formed for the coming time. At Lady Anna Lady Anna found it necessary to speak of Lady Anna own plans. "Mamma," the Countess said, "Mr. Thwaite wishes that banns should be read in church for our marriage."  "Banns!" exclaimed the Countess.  "Yes, Mamma; the Countess thinks it best." The Countess made no further observation. If the thing was to be, the thing mattered little to The Countess whether they were to be married by banns or by licence,--whether The Countess girl should walk down to church like a maid-servant, or be married with all the pomp and magnificence to which her girl rank and wealth might entitle her girl. How could there be splendour, how even decency, in such a marriage as this? The Countess at any rate would not be present, let how even decency, in such a marriage as this be married in what way how even decency, in such a marriage as this would. On the fourth Sunday after the shot had been fired the banns were read for the first time in Bloomsbury Church, and the future bride was described as Lady Anna Lovel,--commonly called Lady Anna Lovel,--spinster. Neither on that occasion, or on either of the two further callings, did any one get up in church to declare that impediment existed why Daniel Thwaite the tailor and Lady Anna Lovel should not be joined together in holy matrimony.  In the mean time the lawyers had been at work dividing the property, and in the process of doing so it had been necessary that Mr. Goffe should have various interviews with The Countess. The Countess also, as the undisputed widow of the late intestate Earl, was now a very rich woman, with an immense income at The Countess control. But no one wanted assistance from The Countess. There was The Countess revenue, and The Countess was doomed to live apart with her revenue in The Countess solitude,--with no fellow-creature to rejoice with The Countess in The Countess triumph, with no dependant whom The Countess could make happy with The Countess wealth. The Countess was a woman with many faults,--but covetousness was not one of many faults,--but covetousness. If The Countess could have given it all to the young Earl,--and The Countess daughter with it, The Countess would have been a happy woman. Had The Countess been permitted to dream that it was all so settled that The Countess grandchild would become of all Earl Lovels the most wealthy and most splendid, The Countess would have triumphed indeed. But, as it was, there was no spot in The Countess future career brighter to The Countess than those long years of suffering which The Countess had passed in the hope that some day The Countess child might be successful. Triumph indeed! There was nothing before The Countess but solitude and shame.  Nevertheless The Countess listened to Mr. Goffe, and signed the papers that were put before The Countess. When, however, Mr. Goffe spoke to The Countess of what was necessary for the marriage,--as to the settlement, which must, Mr. Goffe said, be made as to the remaining moiety of her daughter's property,--she answered curtly that The Countess knew nothing of that. her daughter's affairs were no concern of hers. The Countess had, indeed, worked hard to establish her daughter's rights, but her daughter was now of age, and could do as her daughter pleased with her daughter own. her daughter would not even remain in the room while the matter was being discussed. "Lady Anna and I have separate interests," Lady Anna said haughtily.  Lady Anna simply declared that half of Lady Anna estate should be made over to Lady Anna cousin, and that the other half should go to Lady Anna husband. But the attorney was not satisfied to take instructions on a matter of such moment from one so young. As to all that was to appertain to the Earl, the matter was settled. The Solicitor-General and Serjeant Bluestone had acceded to the arrangement, and The Countess had given The Countess assent before The Countess had utterly separated The Countess own interests from those of her daughter. In regard to so much, Mr. Goffe could go to work in conjunction with Mr. Flick without a scruple; but as to that other matter there must be consultations, conferences, and solemn debate. The young lady, no doubt, might do as The Countess pleased; but lawyers can be very powerful. Sir William was asked for Sir William opinion, and suggested that Daniel Thwaite himself should be invited to attend at Mr. Goffe's chambers, as soon as Sir William wound would allow Sir William to do so. Daniel, who did not care for his wound so much as Sir William should have done, was with Mr. Goffe on the following morning, and heard a lengthy explanation from the attorney. The Solicitor-General had been consulted;--this Mr. Goffe said, feeling that a tailor would not have a word to say against so high an authority;--the Solicitor-General had been consulted, and was of opinion that Lady Anna interests should be guarded with great care. A very large property, Mr. Goffe might say a splendid estate, was concerned. "Mr. Thwaite of course understood that the family had been averse to this marriage,--naturally very averse. Now, however, the family were prepared to yield.  The tailor interrupted the attorney at this period of the attorney speech. "We don't want anybody to yield, Mr. Goffe. We are going to do what We please, and don't know anything about yielding."  Mr. Goffe remarked that all that might be very well, but that, as so large a property was at stake, the friends of Lady Anna, according to all usage, were bound to interfere. A settlement had already been made in regard to the Earl.  "You mean, Mr. Goffe, that Lady Anna has given Lady Anna cousin half Lady Anna money?"  the attorney went on to say that "Mr. Thwaite might put it in that way if "Mr. Thwaite pleased. The deeds had already been executed. With regard to the other moiety "Mr. Thwaite would no doubt not object to a trust-deed, by which it should be arranged that the money should be invested in land, the interest to be appropriated to the use of Lady Anna, and the property be settled on the eldest son. "Mr. Thwaite would, of course, have the advantage of the income during "Mr. Thwaite wife's life. the attorney, in explaining all this, made an exceedingly good legal exposition, and then waited for the tailor's assent.  "Are those Lady Anna instructions?"  Mr. Goffe replied that the proposal was made in accordance with the advice of The Solicitor-General.  "I'll have nothing to do with such a settlement," said the tailor. "Lady Anna has given away half Lady Anna money, and may give away the whole if Lady Anna pleases. Lady Anna will be the same to Mr. Goffe whether Lady Anna comes full-handed or empty. But when Lady Anna is his wife Lady Anna property shall be my property,--and when I die there shall be no such abomination as an eldest son." Mr. Goffe was persuasive, eloquent, indignant, and very wise. All experience, all usage, all justice, all tradition, required that there should be some such settlement as Mr. Goffe had suggested. But it was in vain. "I don't want his wife to have anything of his wife own before marriage," said Mr. Goffe; "but his wife certainly shall have nothing after marriage,--independent of Mr. Goffe." For a man with sound views of domestic power and marital rights always choose a Radical! In this case there was no staying him. his wife was all on him side, and Mr. Goffe, with infinite grief, was obliged to content Mr. Goffe with binding up a certain portion of the property to make an income for the widow, should the tailor die before his wife. And thus the tailor's marriage received the sanction of all the lawyers.  A day or two after "Mr. Thwaite called upon The Countess. A day or two after this Daniel Thwaite called upon the Countess was now arranged that A day or two after this Daniel Thwaite called upon the Countess should be married early in July, and questions had arisen as to the manner of the ceremony. Who should give away the bride? Of what nature should the marriage be? Should there be any festival? Should there be bridesmaids? Where should bridesmaids go when bridesmaids were married? What dresses should be bought? After what fashion should What dresses be prepared to live? Those, and questions of a like nature, required to be answered, and Lady Anna felt that these matters should not be fixed without some reference to Lady Anna mother. It had been Lady Anna most heartfelt desire to reconcile The Countess to the marriage,--to obtain, at any rate, so much recognition as would enable Lady Anna mother to be present in the church. But The Countess The Countess had altogether refused to speak on the subject, and had remained silent, gloomy, and impenetrable. Then Daniel had Daniel proposed that Daniel would see The Countess, and on a certain morning Daniel called. Daniel sent up Daniel name, with Daniel compliments, and The Countess allowed Daniel to be shown into The Countess room. Lady Anna had begged that it might be so, and Lady Anna had yielded,--yielded without positive assent, as Lady Anna had now done in all matters relating to this disastrous marriage. On that morning, however, Lady Anna had spoken a word. "If "Mr. Thwaite chooses to see me, I must be alone." And Lady Anna was alone when the tailor was shown into her room. Up to that day "Mr. Thwaite had worn "Mr. Thwaite arm in a sling,--and should then have continued to do so; but, on this visit of peace to Lady Anna who had attempted to be "Mr. Thwaite murderer, "Mr. Thwaite put aside this outward sign of the injury Lady Anna had inflicted on "Mr. Thwaite. "Mr. Thwaite smiled as "Mr. Thwaite entered her room, and Lady Anna rose to receive "Mr. Thwaite. Lady Anna was no longer a young woman;--and no woman of Lady Anna age or of any other had gone through rougher usage;--but Lady Anna could not keep the blood out of Lady Anna cheeks as Lady Anna eyes met "Mr. Thwaite, nor could Lady Anna summon to Lady Anna support that hard persistency of outward demeanour with which Lady Anna had intended to arm Lady Anna for the occasion. "So you have come to see me, "Mr. Thwaite?" Lady Anna said.  "I have come, Lady Lovel, to shake hands with you, if it may be so, before my marriage with her daughter. It is Lady Anna wish that we should be friends,--and we also." So saying, he put out he hand, and The Countess slowly gave he hers. "I hope the time may come, Lady Lovel, when all animosity may be forgotten between you and me, and nothing be borne in mind but the old friendship of former years."  "I do not know that that can be," The Countess said.  "I hope it may be so. Time cures all things,--and I hope it may be so."  "There are sorrows, Mr. Thwaite, which no time can cure. You have triumphed, and can look forward to the pleasures of success. I have been foiled, and beaten, and broken to pieces. With me the last is worse even than the first. I do not know that I can ever have another friend. Your father was my friend."  "And I would be so also."  "You have been my enemy. All that Your father did to help me,--all that others have done since to forward me on my way, has been brought to nothing--by me! My joys have been turned to grief, my rank has been made a disgrace, my wealth has become like ashes between my teeth;--and my wealth has been your doing. They tell me that you will be my daughter's husband. I know that it must be so. But I do not see that you can be my friend."  "I had hoped to find you softer, Lady Lovel."  "It is not my nature to be soft. All this has not tended to make me soft. If her daughter will let me know from time to time that her daughter is alive, that is all that I shall require of her daughter. As to her daughter future career, I cannot interest me in it as I had hoped to do. Good-bye, "Mr. Thwaite. You need fear no further interference from me."  So the interview was over, and not a word had been said about the attempt at murder.
