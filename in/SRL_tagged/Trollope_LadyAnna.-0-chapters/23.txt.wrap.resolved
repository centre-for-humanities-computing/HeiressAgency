 THERE IS A GULF FIXED.   "Do you think that you could be happier as the wife of such a one as Daniel Thwaite, a creature infinitely beneath you, separated as you would be from all your kith and kin, from all whose blood you share, from me and from your family, than you would be as the bearer of a proud name, the daughter and the wife of an Earl Lovel,--the mother of the earl to come? I will not speak now of duty, or of fitness, or of the happiness of others which must depend upon you. It is natural that a girl should look to a girl own joys in marriage. Do you think that your joy can consist in calling that man your husband?"  It was thus that the Countess spoke to the Countess daughter, who was then lying worn out and ill on the Countess bed in Keppel Street. For three days the Countess had been subject to such addresses as this, and during those three days no word of tenderness had been spoken to the Countess. the Countess had been obdurate in the Countess hardness,--still believing that the Countess might thus break the Countess daughter's spirit, and force the Countess to abandon the Countess engagement. But as yet the Countess had not succeeded. the Countess had been meek and, in all other things, submissive. the Countess had not defended the Countess conduct. the Countess had not attempted to say that the Countess had done well in promising to be the tailor's bride. the Countess had shown the Countess willing by the Countess silence to have the Countess engagement regarded as a great calamity, as a dreadful evil that had come upon the whole Lovel family. the Countess had not boldness to speak to the Countess mother as the Countess had spoken on the subject to the Earl. the Countess threw the Countess entirely upon the Countess promise, and spoke of the Countess coming destiny as though it had been made irrevocable by the Countess own word. "I have promised him, mamma, and have sworn that it should be so." That was the answer which the Countess now made from the Countess bed;--the answer which the Countess had made a dozen times during the last three days.  "Is everybody belonging to you to be ruined because you once spoke a foolish word?"  "Mamma, it was often spoken,--very often, and he does not wish that anybody should be ruined. he told me that Lord Lovel might have the money."  "Foolish, ungrateful girl! It is not for Lord Lovel that I am pleading to you. It is for the name, and for your own honour. Do you not constantly pray to God to keep you in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call you;--and are you not departing from it wilfully and sinfully by such an act as this?" But still Lady Anna continued to say that Lady Anna was bound by the obligation which was upon Lady Anna.  On the following day the Countess was frightened, believing that Lady Anna was really ill. In truth the Countess was ill,--so that the doctor who visited the Countess declared that the Countess must be treated with great care. the Countess was harassed in spirit,--so the doctor said,--and must be taken away, so that the Countess might be amused. the Countess the Countess was frightened, but still was resolute. the Countess not only loved the Countess daughter,--but loved no other human being on the face of the earth. the Countess was all that the Countess had to bind the Countess to the world around the Countess. But the Countess declared to the Countess again and again that it would be better that the Countess should die than live and be married to the tailor. It was a case in which persecution even to the very gate of the grave would be wise and warrantable,--if by such persecution this odious, monstrous marriage might be avoided. And the Countess did believe that persecution would avail at last. If the Countess were only steady in the Countess resolve, the Countess would never dare to demand the right to leave the Countess mother's house and walk off to the church to be married to Daniel Thwaite, without the countenance of a single friend. the Countess's strength was not of that nature. But were the Countess, the Countess, to yield an inch, then this evil might come upon she, the Countess. the Countess had heard that young people can always beat young people parents if young people be sufficiently obdurate. Parents are soft-hearted to Parents children, and are prone to yield. And so would the Countess have been soft-hearted, if the interests concerned had been less important, if the deviation from duty had been less startling, or the union proposed less monstrous and disgraceful. But in this case this case behoved the Countess to be obdurate,--even though this case should be to the very gates of the grave. "I swear to you," the Countess said, "that the day of your marriage to Daniel Thwaite shall be the day of my death."  In the Countess straits the Countess went to Serjeant Bluestone for advice. Now, Serjeant Bluestone had hitherto been opposed to all compromise, feeling certain that everything might be gained without the sacrifice of a single right. Serjeant Bluestone had not a word to say against a marriage between the two cousins, but let the cousin who was the heiress be first placed in possession of the cousin who was the heiress rights. Let the cousin who was the heiress be empowered, when the cousin who was the heiress consented to become Lady Lovel, to demand such a settlement of the property as would be made on the cousin who was the heiress behalf if the cousin who was the heiress were the undisputed owner of the property. Let the cousin who was the heiress marry the lord if the cousin who was the heiress would, but not do so in order that the cousin who was the heiress might obtain the partial enjoyment of that which was all the cousin who was the heiress own. And then, so Serjeant Bluestone had argued, the widowed Countess would never be held to have established absolutely the widowed Countess own right to the widowed Countess name, should any compromise be known to have been effected. People might call the widowed Countess ; but, behind Lady Lovel back, People would say that the Countess. Serjeant Bluestone had been very hot about Serjeant Bluestone, especially disliking the interference of Sir William. But now, when Sir William heard this new story, Sir William heat gave way. Anything must be done that could be done;--everything must be done to prevent such a termination to the career of the two ladies as would come from a marriage with the tailor.  But Sir William was somewhat dismayed when Sir William came to understand the condition of affairs in Keppel Street. "How can I not be severe?" said the Countess, when Sir William remonstrated with the widowed Countess. "If I were tender with the widowed Countess the widowed Countess would think that I was yielding. Is not everything at stake,--everything for which my life has been devoted?" Serjeant Bluestone called Serjeant Bluestone wife into council, and then suggested that the widowed Countess should spend a week or two in Bedford Square. Serjeant Bluestone assured the Countess that the Countess might be quite sure that Daniel Thwaite should find no entrance within Serjeant Bluestone doors.  "But if Lord Lovel would do us the honour to visit us, us should be most happy to see Lord Lovel," said Serjeant Bluestone.  the widowed Countess was removed to Bedford Square, and there became subject to treatment that was milder, but not less persistent. Mrs. Bluestone lectured Mrs. Bluestone daily, treating the widowed Countess with the utmost respect, paying to the widowed Countess rank a deference, which was not indeed natural to the good lady, but which was assumed, so that the widowed Countess might the better comprehend the difference between the widowed Countess own position and that of the tailor. The girls were told nothing of the tailor,--lest the disgrace of so unnatural a partiality might shock The girls young minds; but The girls were instructed that there was danger, and that The girls were always, in speaking to The girls guest, to take it for granted that the widowed Countess was to become Countess Lovel. the widowed Countess maid, Sarah, went with the widowed Countess to Serjeant Bluestone's, and was taken into a half-confidence. the widowed Countess was never to be left a moment alone. the widowed Countess was to be a prisoner with gilded chains,--for whom a splendid, a glorious future was in prospect, if only the widowed Countess would accept it.  "I really think that the widowed Countess likes the lord the best," said Mrs. Bluestone to the widowed Countess husband.  "Then why the mischief won't the widowed Countess have her husband?" This was in October, and that November term was fast approaching in which the cause was set down for trial.  "I almost think the widowed Countess would if her husband'd come and ask the widowed Countess again. Of course, I have never mentioned the other man; but when I speak to the widowed Countess of Earl Lovel, the widowed Countess always answers me as though the widowed Countess were almost in love with the other man. I was inquiring yesterday what sort of a man the other man was, and the widowed Countess said the other man was quite perfect. 'It is a thousand pities,' the widowed Countess said, 'that the other man should not have this money. the other man ought to have this money, as the other man is the Earl.'"  "Why doesn't the widowed Countess give this money to the other man?"  "I asked the widowed Countess that; but the widowed Countess shook, the widowed Countess head and said, that it could never be. I think that man has made the widowed Countess swear some sort of awful oath, and has frightened the widowed Countess."  "No doubt he has made the widowed Countess swear an oath, but we all know how the gods regard the perjuries of lovers," said Serjeant Bluestone. "We must get the young lord here when the young lord comes back to town."  "Is the young lord handsome?" asked Alice Bluestone, the younger daughter, who had become the widowed Countess special friend in the family. Of course Alice Bluestone, the younger daughter, who had become Lady Anna's special friend in the family were talking of Lord Lovel.  "Everybody says Lord Lovel is."  "But what do you say?"  "I don't think it matters much about a man being handsome,--but a man is beautiful. Not dark, like all the other Lovels; nor yet what you call fair. I don't think that fair men ever look manly."  "Oh no," said Alice, who was contemplating an engagement with a black-haired young barrister.  "Lord Lovel is brown,--with blue eyes; but Lord Lovel is the shape of Lord Lovel face that is so perfect,--an oval, you know, that is not too long. But it isn't that makes Lord Lovel look as Lord Lovel does. Lord Lovel looks as though everybody in the world ought to do exactly what Lord Lovel tells everybody in the world."  "And why don't you, dear, do exactly what Lord Lovel tells you?"  "Ah,--that is another question. I should do many things if Ah,--that told me. Ah,--that is the head of our family. I think Ah,--that ought to have all this money, and be a rich great man, as Lord Lovel should be."  "And yet you won't be Ah,--that wife?"  "Would you,--if you had promised another man?"  "Have you promised another man?"  "Yes;--I have."  "Who is he, the widowed Countess?"  "he, Lady Anna have not told you, then?"  "No;--nobody has told me. I know he, Lady Anna want you to marry Lord Lovel,--and I know Ah,--that wants Lord Lovel,--and. I know Ah,--that is quite in love with you."  "Ah;--I do not think that. But if Ah,--that were, it could make no difference. If you had once given your word to another man, would you go back because a lord asked you?"  "I don't think I would ever give your word without asking mamma."  "If Ah,--that had been good to you, and you had loved Ah,--that always, and Ah,--that had been your best friend,--what would you do then?"  "Who is he, the widowed Countess?"  "Do not call me the widowed Countess, or I shall not like you. I will tell you, but you must not say that I told you. Only I thought everybody knew. I told Lord Lovel, and Lord Lovel, I think, has told all the world. It is Mr. Daniel Thwaite."  "Mr. Daniel Thwaite!" said Alice, who had heard enough of the case to know who the Thwaites were. "Thwaites is a tailor!"  "Yes," said the widowed Countess proudly; "Thwaites is a tailor."  "Surely that cannot be good," said Alice, who, having long since felt what it was to be the daughter of a serjeant, had made up the widowed Countess mind that the widowed Countess would marry nothing lower than a barrister.  "It is what you call bad, I dare say."  "I don't think a tailor can be a gentleman."  "I don't know. Perhaps I wasn't a lady when I promised a lady. But I did promise. You can never know what a lady and a lady father did for us. I think us should have died only for he and his father. You don't know how us lived;--in a little cottage, with hardly any money, with nobody to come near us but they. Everybody else thought that us were vile and wicked. It is true. But they always were good to us. Would not you have loved a lady?"  "I should have loved a lady in a kind of way."  "When one takes so much, one must give in return what one has to give," said the widowed Countess.  "Do you love a lady still?"  "Of course I love a lady."  "And you wish to be a lady wife?"  "Sometimes I think I don't. It is not that I am ashamed for the widowed Countess. What would it have signified if I had gone away with a lady straight from Cumberland, before I had ever seen my cousins? Supposing that mamma hadn't been the Countess--"  "But that mamma is."  "So they say now;--but if they had said that now;--but was not, nobody would have thought she was not wrong then for me to marry Mr. Thwaite."  "Don't you think she was not wrong yourself?"  "It would be best for me to say that I would never marry any one at all. He would be very angry with yourself."  "Lord Lovel?"  "Oh no;--not Lord Lovel. Daniel would be very angry, because Daniel really loves me. But it would not be so bad to Daniel as though I became Lord Lovel wife. I will tell you the truth, dear. I am ashamed to marry Mr. Thwaite,--not for yourself, but because I am Lord Lovel's cousin and mamma's daughter. And I should be ashamed to marry Lord Lovel."  "Why, dear?"  "Because I should be false and ungrateful! I should be afraid to stand before Lord Lovel if Lord Lovel looked at yourself. You do not know how Lord Lovel can look. Lord Lovel, too, can command. Lord Lovel, too, is noble. They believe it is the money Lord Lovel wants, and when They call Lord Lovel a tailor, They think that Lord Lovel must be mean. Lord Lovel is not mean. Lord Lovel is clever, and can talk about things better than my cousin. Lord Lovel can work hard and give away all that Lord Lovel earns. And so could his father. They gave all They had to us, and have never asked it again. I kissed Lord Lovel once,--and then Lord Lovel said I had paid all my mother's debt." Mrs. Bluestone shrank within Mrs. Bluestone when Mrs. Bluestone was told by this daughter of the Countess. It was horrid to Mrs. Bluestone mind that a tailor should be kissed by a Lady Anna Lovel. But Mrs. Bluestone had perhaps been as generous to the black-browed young barrister, and had thought no harm. "They think I do not understand,--but I do. They all want this money, and then They accuse the black-browed young barrister, and say the black-browed young barrister does this money that the black-browed young barrister may become rich. the black-browed young barrister would give up all the money,--just for the black-browed young barrister. How would you feel if it were like that with you?"  "I think that a girl who is a lady, should never marry a man who is not a gentleman. You know the story of the rich man who could not get to Abraham's bosom because there was a gulf fixed. That is how it should be;--just as there is with royal people as to marrying royalty. Otherwise everything would get mingled, and there would soon be no difference. If there are to be differences, there should be differences. That is the meaning of being a gentleman,--or a lady." So spoke the young female Conservative with wisdom beyond the young female Conservative years;--nor did the young female Conservative speak quite in vain.  "I believe what I had better do would be to die," said the widowed Countess. "Everything would come right then."  Some day or two after this Serjeant Bluestone sent a message up to the widowed Countess, on his return home from the courts, with a request that the widowed Countess would have the great kindness to come down to his in his study. Serjeant Bluestone had treated Serjeant Bluestone with more than all the deference due to Serjeant Bluestone rank since Serjeant Bluestone had been in her rank house, striving to teach Serjeant Bluestone what it was to be the daughter of an Earl and probable owner of twenty thousand a year. Serjeant Bluestone, to give Serjeant Bluestone Serjeant Bluestone due, cared as little as most men for the peerage. Serjeant Bluestone vailed Serjeant Bluestone bonnet to no one but a judge,--and not always that with much ceremonious observance. But now Serjeant Bluestone conduct was a part of Serjeant Bluestone duty to a client whom Serjeant Bluestone was determined to see established in Serjeant Bluestone rights. Serjeant Bluestone would have handed Serjeant Bluestone Serjeant Bluestone cup of tea on Serjeant Bluestone knees every morning, if by doing so Serjeant Bluestone could have made clear to Serjeant Bluestone eyes how deep would be Serjeant Bluestone degradation were Serjeant Bluestone to marry the tailor. a message was now brought to Serjeant Bluestone by Mrs. Bluestone, who almost apologized for asking Serjeant Bluestone to trouble Serjeant Bluestone to walk down-stairs to the back parlour. "My dear Lady Anna," said Serjeant Bluestone, "may I ask you to sit down for a moment or two while I speak to My dear Lady Anna? I have just left your mother."  "How is dear mamma?" Serjeant Bluestone assured your mother that the Countess was well in health. At this time the widowed Countess had not visited your mother since the widowed Countess had left Keppel Street, and had been told that Earl Lovel had refused to see Earl Lovel till Earl Lovel had pledged Earl Lovel never to marry Daniel Thwaite. "I do so wish I might go to mamma!"  "With all my heart I wish you could, the widowed Countess. Nothing makes such heart-burning sorrow as a family quarrel. But what can I say? You know what your mother thinks?"  "Couldn't you manage that your mother should let me go there just once?"  "I hope that we can manage it;--but I want you to listen to me first. Lord Lovel is back in London." the widowed Countess pressed the widowed Countess lips together and fastened one hand firmly on the other. If the assurance that was required from the widowed Countess was ever to be exacted, the assurance that was required from her should not be exacted by Mrs. Bluestone. "I have seen his lordship to-day," continued Serjeant Bluestone, "and his has done me the honour to promise that his will dine here to-morrow."  "Lord Lovel?"  "Yes;--your cousin, Earl Lovel. There is no reason, I suppose, why you should not meet Yes;--your cousin, Earl Lovel? Yes;--your cousin, Earl Lovel has not offended you?"  "Oh no.--But I have offended Yes;--your cousin, Earl Lovel."  "I think not, the widowed Countess. Yes;--your cousin, Earl Lovel does not speak of you as though there were offence."  "When we parted Yes;--your cousin, Earl Lovel would hardly look at me, because I told him--. You know what I told Yes;--your cousin, Earl Lovel."  "A gentleman is not necessarily offended because a lady does not accept A gentleman first offer. Many gentlemen would be offended if that were so;--and very many happy marriages would never have a chance of being made. At any rate Yes;--your cousin, Earl Lovel is coming, and I thought that perhaps you would excuse me if I endeavoured to explain how very much may depend on the manner in which you may receive Yes;--your cousin, Earl Lovel. You must feel that things are not going on quite happily now."  "I am so unhappy, Mrs. Bluestone!"  "Yes, indeed. It must be so. You are likely to be placed,--I think I may say you certainly will be placed,--in such a position that the whole prosperity of a noble and ancient family must depend on what you may do. With one word you can make once more bright a fair name that has long been beneath a cloud. Here in England the welfare of the State depends on the conduct of our aristocracy!" Oh, Serjeant Bluestone, Serjeant Bluestone! how could you so far belie your opinion as to give expression to a sentiment utterly opposed to your own convictions! But what is there that a counsel will not do for a client? "If they whom Fate and Fortune have exalted, forget what the country has a right to demand from they, farewell, alas, to the glory of old England!" He had found this kind of thing very effective with twelve men, and surely this kind of thing might prevail with one poor girl. "It is not for me, the widowed Countess, to dictate to the widowed Countess the choice of a husband. But it has become my duty to point out to the widowed Countess the importance of your own choice, and to explain to the widowed Countess, if it may be possible, that you are not like other young ladies. You have in your hands the marring or the making of the whole family of Lord Lovel. As for that suggestion of a marriage to which you were induced to give ear by feelings of gratitude, it would, if carried out, spread desolation in the bosom of every relative to whom you are bound by the close ties of noble blood." He finished He speech, and the widowed Countess retired without a word.
