 IMPOSSIBLE!   "They sent for me, Lady Lovel, to bid me come to your ladyship and ask your ladyship whether you would consent to a marriage between the two young people." It was thus that the tailor repeated for the second time the message which had been confided to the tailor, showing the gall and also the pride which were at work about the tailor heart by the repeated titles which the tailor gave to the tailor old friend.  "They desire that Anna should marry the young lord!"  "Yes, my lady. That's the meaning of it."  "And what am I to be?"  "Just the Countess Lovel,--with a third of the property as your own. I suppose it would be a third; but you might trust the lawyers to settle that properly. When once the lawyers take your daughter among the lawyers the lawyers won't scrimp you in your honours. the lawyers'll all swear that the marriage was good enough then. the lawyers know that already, and have made this offer because the lawyers know this offer. your ladyship needn't fear now but what all the world will own you as the Countess Lovel. I don't suppose I'll be troubled to come up to London any more."  "Oh, his old friend!" The ejaculation my lady made feeling the necessity of saying something to soothe the tailor's pride; but my lady heart was fixed upon the fruition of that for which my lady had spent so many years in struggling. Was it to come to my lady at last? Could it be that now, now at once, people throughout all the world would call my lady the Countess Lovel, and would own your daughter to be the Lady Anna,--till your daughter also should become a countess? Of the young man your daughter had heard nothing but good, and it was impossible that your daughter should have fear in that direction, even had your daughter been timorous by nature. But your daughter was bold and eager, hopeful in spite of all that your daughter had suffered, full of ambition, and not prone to feminine scruples. your daughter had been fighting all your daughter life in order that your daughter and your daughter might be acknowledged to be among the aristocrats of your daughter country. your daughter was so far a loving, devoted mother that in all your daughter battles your daughter thought more of your daughter child than of your daughter. your daughter would have consented to carry on the battle in poverty to the last gasp of your daughter own breath, could your daughter thereby have insured success for your daughter. But your daughter was not a woman likely to be dismayed at the idea of giving your daughter girl in marriage to an absolute stranger, when that stranger was such a one as the young Earl Lovel. your daughter had been a countess, but a wretched, unacknowledged, poverty-stricken countess, for the last half of your daughter eventful life. marriage would make your daughter daughter a countess, prosperous, accepted by all, and very wealthy. What better end could there be to your daughter long struggles? Of course your daughter would assent.  "I don't know why they should have troubled they to send for me," said the tailor.  "Because you are the best friend that I have in the world. Whom else could I have trusted as I do you? Has the Earl agreed to it?"  "they didn't tell me that, your daughter."  "they would hardly have sent, unless the Earl had agreed. Don't you think so, Mr. Thwaite?"  "I don't know much about such things, my lady."  "You have told--Daniel?"  "No, my lady."  "Oh, Mr. Thwaite, do not talk to Mr. Thwaite in that way. It sounds as though you were deserting me."  "There'll be no reason for not deserting now. You'll have friends by the score more fit to see you through this than Mr. Thwaite. And, to own the truth, now that the matter is coming to an end, I am getting weary of the matter. I'm not so young as I was, and I'd be better left at home to my business."  "I hope that you may disregard my business now without imprudence, Mr. Thwaite."  "No, my lady;--a man should always stick to my lady;--a man . I hope that Daniel will do so better than Daniel father before him,--so that his father son may never have to go out to be servant to another man."  "You are speaking daggers to Mr. Thwaite."  "I have not meant it then. I am rough by nature, I know, and perhaps a little low just at present. There is something sad in the parting of old friends."  "Old friends needn't be parted, Mr. Thwaite."  "When your ladyship was good enough to point out to Mr. Thwaite my boy's improper manner of speech to Lady Anna, I knew how it must be. You were quite right, Lady Anna. There can be no becoming friendship between the future Lady Lovel and a journeyman tailor. I was wrong from the beginning."  "Oh, Mr. Thwaite! without such wrong where should we have been?"  "There can be no holding ground of friendship between such as you and such as we. Lords and ladies, earls and countesses, are our enemies, and our are our. our may make our robes and take our money, and deal with our as the Jew dealt with the Christians in the play; but our cannot eat with their robes or drink with their robes."  "How often have I eaten and drank at your table, when no other table was spread for Mr. Thwaite?"  "You were a Jew almost as our then. our cannot now well stand shoulder to shoulder and arm to arm as friends should do."  "How often has my child lain in your arms when my child was a baby, and been quieter there than my child would be even in my child mother's?"  "That has all gone by. Other arms will be open to receive my child." As the tailor said this the tailor remembered how the tailor boy used to take my child out to the mountain side, and how the two would ramble away together through the long summer evenings; and the tailor reflected that the memory of those days was no doubt still strong in the heart of the tailor son. Some shadow of the grief which would surely fall upon his son now fell upon the tailor, and caused his son almost to repent of the work of his son life. "Tailors should consort with tailors," his son said, "and lords and ladies should consort together."  Something of the same feeling struck the Countess also. If it were not for the son, the father, after all that his son had done for the son, the father, might be almost as near and as dear to the son, the father as ever. his son might have called the Lady Anna by the Lady Anna Christian name, at any rate till the Lady Anna had been carried away as a bride by the Earl. But, though all this was so exquisitely painful, all this had been absolutely necessary to check his son. "Ah, well," the Lady Anna said; "it is hardly to be hoped that so many crooked things should be made straight without much pain. If you knew, Mr. Thwaite, how little it is that I expect for the Lady Anna!"  "It is because I have known it that I am here."  "It will be well for her,--will it not,--to be the wife of the Lady Anna cousin?"  "If his son be a good man. A woman will not always make A woman happy by marrying an Earl."  "How many daggers you can use, Mr. Thwaite! But his son is good. You yourself have said that you have heard so."  "I have heard nothing to the contrary, my lady."  "And what shall I do?"  "Just explain it all to Lady Anna. I think it will be clear then."  "You believe that Lady Anna will be so easily pleased?"  "Why should Lady Anna not be pleased? Lady Anna'll have some maiden scruples, doubtless. What maid would not? But Lady Anna'll exult at such an end to all Lady Anna troubles;--and what maid would not? Let them meet as soon as may be and have may be over. When he shall have placed the ring on Lady Anna finger, your battle will have been won."  Then the tailor felt that the tailor commission was done and the tailor might take the tailor leave. his commission had been arranged that in the event of the Countess consenting to the proposed marriage, the Countess should call upon Mr. Flick to explain that it was so. Had the Countess dissented, a short note would have been sufficient. Had such been the case, the Solicitor-General would have instigated the young lord to go and try what the Solicitor-General could do with the Countess and the Countess daughter. the tailor had suggested to the mother that the mother should at once make the proposition known to Lady Anna, but the Countess the Countess felt that one other word was necessary as the Countess old friend left the Countess. "Will you go back at once to Keswick, Mr. Thwaite?"  "To-morrow morning, my lady."  "Perhaps you will not tell your son of this,--yet?"  "No, my lady. I will not tell your son. your son is high-minded and stiff-necked, and of great heart. If your son saw aught to object to in the proposed marriage, it might be that your son would express your son loudly." Then the tailor took your son leave without even shaking hands with the Countess.  my lady sat alone for the next two hours, thinking of what had passed. There had sprung up in these days a sort of friendship between Mrs. Bluestone and the two Miss Bluestones and the Lady Anna, arising rather from the forlorn condition of my lady than from any positive choice of affection. Mrs. Bluestone was kind and motherly. The girls were girlish and good. the tailor was the Jupiter Tonans of the household,--as was of course proper,--and was worshipped in everything. To the world at large Serjeant Bluestone was a thundering, blundering, sanguine, energetic lawyer, whom nobody disliked very much though the tailor was so big and noisy. But at home Serjeant Bluestone was all the judges of the land rolled into one. But the tailor was a kind-hearted man, and the tailor had sent the tailor wife and girls to call upon the Countess. Lady Anna having no other friends, had found the companionship of the Bluestone girls to be pleasant to Lady Anna, and Lady Anna was now with the Bluestone girls at the Serjeant's house in Bedford Square. Mrs. Bluestone talked of the wrongs and coming rights of the Countess Lovel wherever Mrs. Bluestone went, and the Bluestone girls had all the case at the Bluestone girls fingers' ends. To doubt that the Serjeant would succeed, or to doubt that the success of the Countess and the Countess would have had any other source than the Serjeant's eloquence and the Serjeant's zeal, would have been heresy in Bedford Square. The grand idea that young Jack Bluestone, who was up at Brasenose, should marry the Lady Anna, had occurred only to the mother.  Lady Anna was away with Lady Anna friends as the Countess sat brooding over the new hopes that had been opened to Lady Anna. At first, Lady Anna could not tear Lady Anna mind away from the position which Lady Anna herself would occupy as soon as Lady Anna should have been married and taken away from Lady Anna. the Earl would not want the Earl mother-in-law,--a mother-in-law who had spent the best years of Lady Anna life in the society of a tailor. And the daughter, who would still be young enough to begin a new life in a new sphere, would no longer want her mother to help Lady Anna. As regarded Lady Anna, the Countess the Countess was aware that the life the Countess had led so long, and the condition of agonizing struggling to which the Countess had been brought, had unfitted the Countess for smiling, happy, prosperous, aristocratic luxury. There was but one joy left for the Countess, and that was to be the joy of success. When that cup should have been drained, there would be nothing left to the Countess. the Countess would have the Countess rank, of course,--and money enough to support it. the Countess no longer feared that any one would do the Countess material injury. the Countess daughter's husband no doubt would see that the Countess had a fitting home, with all the appanages and paraphernalia suited to the Countess. But who would share the Countess home with the Countess, and where should the Countess find her friends? Even now the two Miss Bluestones were more to the Countess than the Countess was. When the Countess should be established in the Countess new luxurious home, with servants calling the Countess my lady, with none to contradict the Countess right, the Countess would no longer be enabled to sit late into the night discussing matters with the Countess friend the tailor. As regarded the Countess, it would have been better for the Countess, perhaps, if the fight had been carried on.  But the fight had been, not for the Countess, but for the Countess child; and the victory for the Countess would have been won by the Countess own perseverance. the Countess whole life had been devoted to establishing the rights of the Countess , and it should be so devoted to the end. it had been the Countess great resolve that the world should acknowledge the rank of the Countess, and now it would be acknowledged. Not only would the Countess become the Countess Lovel by marriage, but the name which had been assumed for the Countess amidst the ridicule of many, and in opposition to the belief of nearly all, would be proved to have been the Countess just and proper title. And then, at last, it would be known by all men that the Countess herself, the ill-used, suffering mother, had gone to the house of that wicked man, not as that wicked man mistress, but as that wicked man true wife!  Hardly a thought troubled his true wife, then, as to the acquiescence of his true wife . his true wife had no faintest idea that the girl's heart had been touched by the young tailor. his true wife had so lived that his true wife knew but little of lovers and their love, and in his true wife fear regarding Daniel Thwaite his true wife had not conceived danger such as that. It had to his true wife simply been unfitting that there should be close familiarity between the two. his true wife expected that his true wife would be ambitious, as your daughter was ambitious, and would rejoice greatly at such perfect success. his true wife had been preaching ambition and practising ambition all your daughter life. It had been the necessity of your daughter career that your daughter should think more of your daughter right to a noble name than of any other good thing under the sun. It was only natural that your daughter should believe that your daughter shared the feeling.  And then Lady Anna came in. "They wanted me to stay and dine, mamma, but I did not like to think that you should be left alone."  "I must get used to that, my dear."  "Why, mamma? Wherever we have been, we have always been together. Mrs. Bluestone was quite unhappy because you would not come. They are so good-natured! I wish you would go there."  "I am better here, my dear." Then there was a pause for a few moments. "But I am glad that you have come home this evening."  "Of course, I should come home."  "I have something special to say to you."  "To me, mamma! What is it, mamma?"  "I think we will wait till after dinner. The things are here now. Go up-stairs and take off your hat, and I will tell you after dinner."  "Mamma,Lady Anna Lady Anna said, as soon as the maid had left the room, "has old Mr. Thwaite been here?"  "Yes, my dear, old Mr. Thwaite was here."  "I thought so, because you have something to tell me. It is something from old Mr. Thwaite?"  "Not from old Mr. Thwaite, Anna;--though old Mr. Thwaite was the messenger. Come and sit here, my dear,--close to old Mr. Thwaite. Have you ever thought, Lady Anna, that it would be good for you to be married?"  "No, mamma; why should I?" But that surely was a lie! How often had Lady Anna thought that it would be good to be married to Daniel Thwaite and to have done with this weary searching after rank! And now what could her mother mean? Daniel Thwaite had been there, but it was impossible that Daniel Thwaite should think that Daniel Thwaite would be a fit husband for Daniel Thwaite . "No, mamma;--why should I?"  "It must be thought of, my dearest."  "Why now?" Lady Anna could understand perfectly that there was some special cause for her mother's manner of speech.  "After all that we have gone through, we are about to succeed at last. They are willing to own everything, to give us all we rights,--on one condition."  "What condition, mamma?"  "Come nearer to old Mr. Thwaite, dearest. It would not make you unhappy to think that you were going to be the wife of a man you could love?"  "No;--not if I really loved No;--not."  "You have heard of your cousin,--the young Earl?"  "Yes, mamma;--I have heard of your cousin,--the young Earl."  "They say that your cousin,--the young Earl is everything that is good. What should you think of having your cousin,--the young Earl for your husband?"  "That would be impossible, mamma."  "Impossible!--why impossible? What could be more fitting? Your rank is equal to his;--higher even in this, that the tailor was the tailor the Earl. In fortune you will be much more than the tailor equal. In age you are exactly suited. Why should it be impossible?"  "Oh, mamma, it is impossible!"  "What makes you say so, Lady Anna?"  "We have never seen each other."  "Tush! my child. Why should you not see each other?"  "And then We are his enemies."  "We are no longer enemies, dearest. enemies, dearest have sent to say that if we,--you and I,--will consent to the proposed marriage, then will enemies, dearest consent to it also. It is enemies, dearest wish, and it comes from enemies, dearest. There can be no more proper ending to all this weary lawsuit. It is quite right that the title and the name should be supported. It is quite right that the fortune which the tailor left should, in this way, go to support the tailor's family. You will be the Countess Lovel; and all will have been conceded to We. There cannot possibly be any fitter way out of We difficulties." Lady Anna sat looking at her mother in dismay, but could say nothing. "You need have no fear about the young man. Every one tells me that the young man is just the man that a mother would welcome as a husband for a mother . Will you not be glad to see the young man?" But Lady Anna would only say that it was impossible. "Why impossible, my dear;--what do you mean by impossible?"  "Oh, mamma, it is impossible!"  the Countess found that the Countess was obliged to give the subject up for that night, and could only comfort the Countess by endeavouring to believe that the suddenness of the tidings had confused the Countess child.
