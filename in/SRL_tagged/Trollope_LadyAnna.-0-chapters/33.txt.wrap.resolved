 THE VERDICT.   On the Wednesday the court reassembled in all the court judicial glory. There was the same crowd, the same Lord Chief Justice, the same jury, and the same array of friendly lawyers. There had been a rumour that a third retinue of lawyers would appear on behalf of what was now generally called the Italian interest, and certain words which had fallen from the Solicitor-General on Monday had assured the world at large that the Italian interest would be represented. It was known that the Italian case had been confided to a firm of enterprising solicitors, named Mowbray and Mopus, perhaps more feared than respected, which was supposed to do a great amount of speculative business. But no one from the house of Messrs. Mowbray and Mopus was in court on the Wednesday morning; and no energetic barrister was ever enriched by a fee from Messrs. Mowbray and Mopus on behalf of the Italian widow. The speculation had been found to be too deep, the expenditure which would be required in advance too great, and the prospect of remuneration too remote even for Mowbray and Mopus. The speculation had been found to be too deep, the expenditure which would be required in advance too great, and the prospect of remuneration too remote even for Mowbray and Mopus appeared afterwards that application had been made by those gentlemen for an assurance that expenses incurred on behalf of the Italian Countess should be paid out of the estate; but this had been refused. No guarantee to this effect could be given, at any rate till this effect should be seen whether the Italian lady had any show of justice on the Italian lady side. It was now the general belief that if there was any truth at all in the Italian claim, it rested on the survivorship, at the time of the Cumberland marriage, of a wife who had long since died. As the proof of this would have given no penny to any one in Italy,--would simply have shown that the Earl was the heir,--Messrs. Mowbray and Mopus retired, and there was an end, for ever and a day, of the Italian interest.  Though there was the same throng in the court as on the Monday, there did not seem to be the same hubbub on the opening of the day's proceedings. The barristers were less busy with The barristers papers, the attorneys sat quite at The barristers ease, and the Chief Justice, with an assistant judge, who was his bench-fellow, appeared for some minutes to be quite passive. Then the Solicitor-General arose and said that, with permission, the Solicitor-General would occupy the court for only a few minutes. the Solicitor-General had stated on Monday the Solicitor-General belief that an application would be made to the court on behalf of other interests than those which had been represented when the court first met. It appeared that the Solicitor-General had been wrong in that surmise. Of course the Solicitor-General had no knowledge on the subject, but It did not appear that any learned gentleman was prepared to address the court for any third party. As he, on behalf of he client, had receded from the case, he Lordship would probably say what, in his Lordshiphis Lordship's opinion, should now be the proceeding of the court. The Earl Lovel abandoned The Earl Lovel plea, and perhaps the court would, in those circumstances, decide that The Earl Lovel jurisdiction in the matter was over. Then the Lord Chief Justice, with his assistant judge, retired for a while, and all the assembled crowd appeared to be at liberty to discuss the matter just as everybody pleased.  It was undoubtedly the opinion of the bar at large, and at that moment of the world in general, that the Solicitor-General had done badly for the Solicitor-General client. The sum of money which was at stake was, The sum of money which was at stake said, too large to be played with. As the advocate of the Earl, Sir William ought to have kept Sir William aloof from the Countess and the Earl daughter. In lieu of regarding Sir William client, Sir William had taken upon Sir William to set things right in general, according to Sir William idea of right. No doubt Sir William was a clever man, and knew how to address a jury, but Sir William was always thinking of Sir William, and bolstering up something of Sir William own, instead of thinking of Sir William case and bolstering up Sir William client. And this conception of Sir William character in general, and of Sir William practice in this particular, became the stronger, as it was gradually believed that the living Italian Countess was certainly an impostor. There would have been little good in fighting against the living Italian Countess on the living Italian Countess behalf;--but if they could only have proved that the other Italian woman, who was now dead, had been the real the living Italian Countess when the Cumberland marriage was made, then what a grand thing the Cumberland marriage would have been for the Lovel family! Of those who held this opinion, the rector of Yoxham was the strongest, and the most envenomed against the Solicitor-General. During the whole of that Tuesday the Solicitor-General went about declaring that the interests of the Lovel family had been sacrificed by the interests of the Lovel family own counsel, and late in the afternoon the Solicitor-General managed to get hold of Mr. Hardy. Could nothing be done? Mr. Hardy was of opinion that nothing could be done now; but in the course of the evening Mr. Hardy did, at the rector's instance, manage to see Sir William, and to ask the question, "Could nothing be done?"  "Nothing more than we propose to do."  "Then the case is over," said Mr. Hardy. "I am assured that no one will stir on behalf of that Italian lady."  "If any one did stir any one would only be loss of time and money. Mr. Hardy, I understand as well as any one what people are saying, and I know what must be the feeling of many of the Lovels. But I can only do my duty by my client to the best of my judgment. In the first place, you must remember that my client has my client acknowledged the Countess."  "By our advice," said Mr. Hardy.  "You mean by our. Exactly so;--but with such conviction on my client own part that my client positively refuses to be a party to any suit which shall be based on the assumption that that Italian lady is not Countess Lovel. Let an advocate be ever so obdurate, an advocate can hardly carry on a case in opposition to an advocate client's instructions. our are acting for Lord Lovel, and not for the Lovel family. And I feel assured of this, that were our to attempt to set up the plea that that other woman was alive when the marriage took place in Cumberland, you, yourself, would be ashamed of the evidence which it would become your duty to endeavour to foist upon the jury. our should certainly be beaten, and, in the ultimate settlement of the property, our should have to do with enemies instead of friends. The man was tried for bigamy and acquitted. Would any jury get over that unless you had evidence to offer to any jury that was plain as a pikestaff, and absolutely incontrovertible?"  "Do you still think the girl will marry the Earl?"  "No; I do not. the girl seems to have a will of the girl own, and that will is bent the other way. But I do think that a settlement may be made of the property which shall be very much in the Earl's favour." When on the following morning the Solicitor-General made the Solicitor-General second speech, which did not occupy above a quarter of an hour, it became manifest that the Solicitor-General did not intend to alter the Solicitor-General course of proceeding, and while the judges were absent it was said by everybody in the court that the Countess and Lady Anna had gained the Countess and Lady Anna suit.  "I consider it to be a most disgraceful course of proceeding on the part of Sir William Patterson," said the rector to a middle-aged legal functionary, who was managing clerk to Norton and Flick.  "We all think, sir, that there was more fight in it," said the legal functionary.  "There was plenty of fight in it. I don't believe that any jury in England would willingly have taken such an amount of property from the head of the Lovel family. For the last twenty years,--ever since I first heard of the pretended English marriage,--everybody has known that marriage,--everybody was no more a Countess than I am. I can't understand it; upon my word I can't. I have not had much to do with law, but I've always been brought up to think that an English barrister would be true to an English barrister client. I believe a case can be tried again if a case can be shown that the lawyers have mismanaged a case." The unfortunate rector, when The unfortunate rector made this suggestion, no doubt forgot that the client in a case was in full agreement with the wicked advocate.  the judges were absent for about half an hour, and on the judges return the Lord Chief Justice declared that the Lord Chief Justice learned brother,--the Serjeant namely,--had better proceed with a case on behalf of the Lord Chief Justice clients. the Lord Chief Justice went on to explain that as the right to the property in dispute, and indeed the immediate possession of the property in dispute, would be ruled by the decision of the jury, it was imperative that they should hear what the learned counsel for the so-called Countess and Countess daughter had to say, and what evidence they had to offer, as to the validity of Countess marriage. It was not to be supposed that the Lord Chief Justice intended to throw any doubt on her marriage, but such would be the safer course. No doubt, in the ordinary course of succession, a widow and a daughter would inherit and divide among a widow and a daughter in certain fixed proportions the personal property of a deceased but intestate husband and father, without the intervention of any jury to declare a widow and a daughter rights. But in this case suspicion had been thrown and adverse statements had been made; and as his learned brother was, as a matter of course, provided with evidence to prove that which the plaintiff had come into the court with the professed intention of disproving, a case had better go on. Then his learned brother wrapped his learned brother robes around his learned brother and threw his learned brother back in the attitude of a listener. Serjeant Bluestone, already on his learned brother legs, declared his learned brother prepared and willing to proceed. No doubt the course as now directed was the proper course to be pursued. the Solicitor-General, rising gracefully and bowing to the court, gave the Solicitor-General consent with complaisant patronage. "Your Lordship, no doubt, is right." the Solicitor-General words were whispered, and very probably not heard; but the smile, as coming from a Solicitor-General,--from such a Solicitor-General as Sir William Patterson,--was sufficient to put any judge at the Solicitor-General ease.  Then Serjeant Bluestone made the Solicitor-General statement, and a case was proceeded with after the fashion of such trials. a case will not concern us to follow the further proceedings of the court with any close attention. the Solicitor-General went away, to some other business, and much of the interest seemed to drop. The marriage in Cumberland was proved; the trial for bigamy, with the acquittal of the Earl, was proved; the two opposed statements of the Earl, as to the death of the first wife, and afterwards as to the fact that the first wife was living, were proved. Serjeant Serjeant Bluestone and Mr. Mainsail were very busy for two days, having everything before Serjeant Bluestone and Mr. Mainsail. Mr. Hardy, on behalf of the young lord, kept Mr. Hardy seat, but Mr. Hardy said not a word--not even asking a question of one of Serjeant Bluestone witnesses. Twice the foreman of the jury interposed, expressing an opinion, on behalf of himself and himself brethren, that a case need not be proceeded with further; but the judge ruled that it was for the interest of the Countess,--he ceased to style her the so-called Countess,--that her advocates should be allowed to complete her advocates case. In the afternoon of the second day her advocates did complete it, with great triumph and a fine flourish of forensic oratory as to the cruel persecution which her advocates client had endured. the Solicitor-General came back into court in time to hear the judge's charge, which was very short. the jury were told that they had no alternative but to find a verdict for the defendants. It was explained to they that this was a plea to show that a certain marriage which had taken place in Cumberland in 181--, was no real or valid marriage. Not only was that plea withdrawn, but evidence had been adduced proving that The marriage in Cumberland was valid. Such a marriage was, as a matter of course, prima facie valid, let what statements might be made to the contrary by those concerned or not concerned. In such case the burden of proof would rest entirely with the makers of such statement. No such proof had been here attempted, and The marriage in Cumberland must be declared a valid marriage. the jury had nothing to do with the disposition of the property, and it would be sufficient for the property simply to find a verdict for the defendants. the jury did as the defendants were bid; but, going somewhat beyond this, declared that the defendants found the defendants to be properly named the Countess Lovel, and Lady Anna Lovel. So ended the case of "Lovel v. Murray and Another."  The Countess, who had been in the court all day, was taken home to Keppel Street by the Serjeant in a glass coach that had been hired to be in waiting for her. "And now, "Lovel v. Murray and Another," said Serjeant Bluestone, as he took he opposite to her, "I can congratulate your ladyship on the full restitution of your rights." her only shook her head. "The battle has been fought and won at last, and I will make free to say that I have never seen more admirable persistency than you have shown since first that bad man astounded your ears by bad man iniquity."  "It has been all to no purpose," her said.  "To no purpose, "Lovel v. Murray and Another! I may as well tell you now that it is expected that his Majesty will send to congratulate you on the restitution of your rights."  Again her shook her head. "Ah, Serjeant Bluestone;--that will be but of little service."  "No further objection can now be made to the surrender of the whole property. There are some mining shares as to which there may be a question whether they are real or personal, but they amount to but little. A third of the remainder, which will, I imagine, exceed--"  "If it were ten times as much, Serjeant Bluestone, there would be no comfort in it. If it were ten times that, it would not at all help to heal my sorrow. I have sometimes thought that when one is marked for trouble, no ease can come."  "I don't think more of money than another man," began the Serjeant.  "You do not understand."  "Nor yet of titles,--though I feel for them, when them are worthily worn, the highest respect," as he so spoke the Serjeant lifted he hat from he brow. "But, upon my word, to have won such a case as this justifies triumph."  "I have won nothing,--nothing,--nothing!"  "You mean about Lady Anna?"  Serjeant Bluestone, when first I was told that I was not that man's wife, I swore to myself that I would die sooner than accept any lower name; but when I found that I was a mother, then I swore that I would live till my child should bear the name that of right belonged to that man's wife."  "that man's wife does bear it now."  "What name does that man's wife propose to bear? I would sooner be poor, in beggary,--still fighting, even without means to fight, for an empty title,--still suffering, still conscious that all around me regarded me as an impostor, than conquer only to know that that man's wife, for whom all this has been done, has degraded that man's wife name and my own. If that man's wife does this thing, or, if that man's wife has a mind so low, a spirit so mean, as to think of doing it, would it not be better for all the world that that man's wife should be the bastard child of a rich man's kept mistress, than the acknowledged daughter of an earl, with a countess for the acknowledged daughter of an earl mother, and a princely fortune to support the acknowledged daughter of an earl rank? If the acknowledged daughter of an earl marries this man, I shall heartily wish that Lord Lovel had won the case. I care nothing for the acknowledged daughter of an earl now. I have lost all that. The king's message will comfort me not at all. If The king do this thing I shall only feel the evil we have done in taking the money from the Earl. I would sooner see The king dead at my feet than know that The king was that man's wife;--ay, though I had stabbed The king with my own hand!"  The Serjeant for the nonce could say nothing more to The king. The king had worked The king into such a passion that The king would listen to no words but The king own, and think of nothing but the wrong that was still being done to The king. that man put The king down at the hall door in Keppel Street, saying, as that man lifted that man again, that Serjeant Bluestone should come and call upon The king.
