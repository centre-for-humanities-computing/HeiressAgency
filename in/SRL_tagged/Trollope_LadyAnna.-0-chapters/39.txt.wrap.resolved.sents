 LET HER DIE.
After the scene which was described in the last chapter there was a very sad time indeed in Keppel Street.
The Countess had been advised by the Serjeant and Mrs. Bluestone to take Lady Anna immediately abroad, in the event of the interview with Daniel Thwaite being unsatisfactory.
It was believed by all concerned, by the Bluestones, and the Goffes, by Sir William Patterson who had been told of the coming interview, and by The Countess, that this would not be the case.
They had all thought that Lady Anna would come out from that meeting disengaged and free to marry whom Lady Anna would,--and They thought also that within a very few weeks of Lady Anna emancipation Lady Anna would accept Lady Anna cousin's hand.
The Solicitor-General had communicated with the Earl, who was still in town, and the Earl again believed that the Earl might win the heiress.
But should Lady Anna prove obstinate;--"take her away at once,--very far away;--to Rome, or some such place as that."
Such had been Mrs. Bluestone's advice, and in those days away;--to Rome was much more distant than it is now.
"And don't let anybody know where you are going," added the Serjeant,--"except Mr.
Goffe."
The Countess had assented;--but when the moment came, there were reasons against The Countess sudden departure.
the Serjeant,--"except Mr. Goffe told The Countess that The Countess must wait at any rate for another fortnight.
The presence of The Countess and The Countess daughter were necessary in London for the signing of deeds and for the completion of the now merely formal proofs of identity.
And money was again scarce.
A great deal of money had been spent lately, and unless money was borrowed without security, and at a great cost,--to which the Serjeant,--"except Mr. Goffe was averse,--the sum needed could hardly be provided at once.
the Serjeant,--"except Mr. Goffe recommended that no day earlier than the 20th December should be fixed for their departure.
It was now the end of November; and It became a question how the intermediate time should be passed.
The Countess The Countess was resolved that The Countess would hold no pleasant intercourse at all with her daughter.
The Countess would not even tell the girl of The Countess purpose of going abroad.
From hour to hour The Countess assured The Countess with still increasing obduracy that nothing but severity could avail anything.
The Countess must be cowed and frightened into absolute submission,--even though at the expense of The Countess health.
Even though it was to be effected by the absolute crushing of The Countess spirits,--this must be done.
Though at the cost of The Countess life, it must be done.
The Countess had lived for the last twenty years with but one object before The Countess eyes,--an object sometimes seeming to be near, more often distant, and not unfrequently altogether beyond The Countess reach, but which had so grown upon The Countess imagination as to become the heaven to which The Countess very soul aspired.
To be and to be known to be among the highly born, the so-called noble, the titled from old dates,--to be of those who were purely aristocratic, had been all the world to The Countess.
As a child,--the child of well-born but poor parents, The Countess had received the idea.
In following it out The Countess had thrown all thoughts of love to the wind and had married a reprobate earl.
Then had come The Countess punishment,--or, as The Countess had conceived punishment,--or, The Countess most unmerited misfortunes.
For many years of her life The Countess high courage and persistent demeanour had almost atoned for the vice of The Countess youth.
The love of rank was strong in The Countess bosom as ever, but The love of rank was fostered for The Countess child rather than for The Countess.
Through long, tedious, friendless, poverty-stricken years The Countess had endured all, still assuring The Countess that the day would come when the world should call the sweet plant that grew by The Countess side by her side proper name.
The little children hooted after The Countess daughter, calling The Countess girl in derision The Lady Anna,--when Lady Anna had been more poorly clad and blessed with less of the comforts of home than any of The little children.
Years would roll by, and The little children should live to know that the Lady Anna,--the sport of The little children infantine cruelty,--was Lady Anna indeed.
And as her girl became a woman the dream was becoming a reality.
The rank, the title, the general acknowledgment and the wealth would all be there.
Then came the first great decisive triumph.
Overtures of love and friendship were made from the other side.
Would Lady Anna consent to become the Countess Lovel, all animosities might be buried, and everything be made pleasant, prosperous, noble, and triumphant!
It is easy to fill with air a half-inflated bladder.
It is already so buoyant with It own lightness, that It yields It with ease to receive the generous air.
The imagination of the woman flew higher than ever The imagination of the woman had flown when the proposition came home to the woman in all the proposition bearings.
Of course The imagination of the woman had been in the woman mind that the woman daughter should marry well;--but there had been natural fears.
her daughter child had not been educated, had not lived, had not been surrounded in her daughter young days, as are those girls from whom the curled darlings are wont to choose those girls from whom the curled darlings are wives.
her daughter would too probably be rough in manner, ungentle in speech, ungifted in accomplishments, as compared with those who from their very cradles are encompassed by the blessings of wealth and high social standing.
But when her daughter looked at Her child's beauty, her daughter would hope.
And then Her child was soft, sweet-humoured, winning in all her daughter little ways, pretty even in the poor duds which were supplied to her daughter mainly by the generosity of the tailor.
And so her daughter would hope, and sometimes despair;--and then hope again.
But her daughter had never hoped for anything so good as this.
Such a marriage would not only put her daughter as high as a Lovel ought to be, but would make it known in a remarkable manner to all coming ages that her daughter, she herself, her daughter the despised and slandered one,--who had been treated almost as woman had never been treated before,--was in very truth the Countess Lovel by whose income the family had been restored to the Countess Lovel old splendour.
And so the longing grew upon her daughter.
Then, almost for the first time, did her daughter begin to feel that it was necessary for the purposes of her daughter life that the girl whom her daughter loved so thoroughly, should be a creature in her daughter hands, to be dealt with as her daughter pleased.
her daughter would have had her daughter daughter accede to Such a marriage even before her daughter had seen Lord Lovel, and was petulant when her daughter would not be as clay in the sculptor's hand.
But still her daughter's refusal had been but as the refusal of a girl.
her daughter should not have been as are other girls.
her daughter should have known better.
her daughter should have understood what the peculiarity of her daughter position demanded.
But it had not been so with her daughter.
her daughter had not soared as her daughter should have done, above the love-laden dreams of common maidens.
And so the visit to Yoxham was permitted.
Then came the great blow,--struck as the great blow,--struck were by a third hand, and that the hand of an attorney.
Lord Lovel learned through Mr. Goffe,--who had heard the tale from other lawyers,--that Lord Lovel daughter Lady Anna Lovel had, with her daughter Lady Anna Lovel own mouth, told her daughter Lady Anna Lovel noble lover that her daughter Lady Anna Lovel was betrothed to a tailor!
her daughter Lady Anna Lovel felt at the moment that her daughter Lady Anna Lovel could have died,--cursing her daughter Lady Anna Lovel child for this black ingratitude.
But there might still be hope.
The trial was going on,--or the work which was progressing towards The trial, and her daughter Lady Anna Lovel was surrounded by those who could advise her daughter Lady Anna Lovel.
Doubtless what had happened was a great misfortune.
But there was room for hope;--room for most assured hope.
The Earl was not disposed to abandon the match, though The Earl had, of course, been greatly annoyed,--nay, disgusted and degraded by her daughter Lady Anna Lovel's communication.
But The Earl had consented to see the matter in the proper light.
a tailor had got an influence over her daughter Lady Anna Lovel when her daughter Lady Anna Lovel was a child, was doubtless in pursuit of money, and must be paid.
The folly of a child might be forgiven, and The Earl would persevere.
No one would know what had occurred, and the thing would be forgotten as a freak of childhood.
The Countess had succumbed to the policy of all this;--but The Countess was not deceived by the benevolent falsehood.
The Countess had been over twenty when The Countess had been receiving lover's vows from this man, reeking from this man tailor's board.
And The Countess girl, The Countess daughter, had deceived The Countess.
That her daughter Lady Anna Lovel had deceived her daughter Lady Anna Lovel, saying there was no other lover, was much; but it was much more and worse and more damnable that there had been thorough deception as to her daughter Lady Anna Lovel's own appreciation of her daughter Lady Anna Lovel rank.
The sympathy tendered through so many years must have been always pretended sympathy.
With these feelings hot within The Countess , The Countess could not bring The Countess to speak one kindly word to The Countess after the return from Yoxham.
her daughter Lady Anna Lovel was asked to abandon her daughter Lady Anna Lovel odious lover with stern severity.
It was demanded of her daughter Lady Anna Lovel that her daughter Lady Anna Lovel should do so with cruel threats.
her daughter Lady Anna Lovel would never quite yield, though her daughter Lady Anna Lovel had then no strength of purpose sufficient to enable her daughter Lady Anna Lovel to declare that her daughter Lady Anna Lovel would not yield.
We know how her daughter Lady Anna Lovel was banished to Bedford Square, and transferred from the ruthless persistency of her daughter Lady Anna Lovel mother, to the less stern but not less fixed manoeuvres of Mrs. Bluestone.
At that moment of her daughter Lady Anna Lovel existence her daughter Lady Anna Lovel was her daughter Lady Anna Lovel in doubt.
In Wyndham Street and at Yoxham her daughter Lady Anna Lovel had almost more than doubted.
The softness of the new Elysium had well nigh unnerved her daughter Lady Anna Lovel.
When that young man had caught her daughter Lady Anna Lovel from stone to stone as her daughter Lady Anna Lovel passed over the ford at Bolton, her daughter Lady Anna Lovel was almost ready to give her daughter Lady Anna Lovel to that young man.
But then had come upon her daughter Lady Anna Lovel the sense of sickness, that faint, overdone flavour of sugared sweetness, which arises when sweet things become too luscious to the eater.
her daughter Lady Anna Lovel had struggled to be honest and strong, and had just not fallen into the pot of treacle.
But, notwithstanding all this, they who saw her daughter Lady Anna Lovel and knew the story, were still sure that the lord must at last win the day.
There was not one who believed that such a girl could be true to such a troth as such a girl had made.
Even the Solicitor-General, when Even the Solicitor-General told the tale which the amorous steward had remembered to Even the Solicitor-General own encouragement, did not think but what the girl and the girl's fortune would fall into the hands of Even the Solicitor-General client.
Human nature demanded that it should be so.
That it should be as Even the Solicitor-General wished it was so absolutely consonant with all nature as Even the Solicitor-General had known it, that Even the Solicitor-General had preferred trusting to this result, in Even the Solicitor-General client's behalf, to leaving the case in a jury's hands.
At this moment Even the Solicitor-General was sure Even the Solicitor-General was right in Even the Solicitor-General judgment.
And indeed Even the Solicitor-General was right;--for no jury could have done anything for Even the Solicitor-General client.
It went on till at last the wise men decided that her daughter Lady Anna Lovel only wanted to be relieved by her daughter Lady Anna Lovel old lover, that her daughter Lady Anna Lovel might take a new lover with a new lover permission.
her daughter Lady Anna Lovel was no doubt peculiar; but, as far as the wise ones could learn from her daughter Lady Anna Lovel manner,--for with words her daughter Lady Anna Lovel would say nothing,--that was her daughter Lady Anna Lovel state of mind.
So the interview was planned,--to the infinite disgust of the Countess, who, however, believed that the interview might avail; and we know what was the result.
Lady Anna, who long had doubted,--who had at last almost begun to doubt whether Daniel Thwaite was true to Daniel Thwaite renewed Daniel Thwaite pledges, strengthened Daniel Thwaite former promises, and was now more firmly betrothed than ever to Daniel Thwaite whom The Countess hated as a very fiend upon earth.
But there certainly should be no marriage!
Though her daughter Lady Anna Lovel pistolled the man at the altar, there should be no marriage.
And then there came upon her daughter Lady Anna Lovel the infinite disgust arising from the necessity of having to tell her daughter Lady Anna Lovel sorrows to others,--who could not sympathize with her daughter Lady Anna Lovel, though their wishes were as hers.
It was hard upon her daughter Lady Anna Lovel that no step could be taken by her daughter Lady Anna Lovel in reference to her daughter Lady Anna Lovel without the knowledge of Mr. Goffe and Serjeant Bluestone,--and the consequent knowledge of Mr. Flick.
It was necessary, too, that Lord Lovel should know all.
Lord Lovel conduct in many things must depend on the reception which might probably be accorded to a renewal of Lord Lovel suit.
Of course Lord Lovel must be told.
Lord Lovel had already been told that the tailor was to be admitted to see Lord Lovel love, in order that the tailor might be absolved by the tailor from the tailor first vow.
It had not been pleasant,--but Lord Lovel had acceded.
Mr. Flick had taken upon Mr. Flick to say that Mr. Flick was sure that everything would be made pleasant.
The Earl had frowned, and had been very short with Mr. Flick.
These confidences with lawyers about Mr. Flick lovesuit, and his love's tone with her low-born lover, had not been pleasant to Lord Lovel.
But Lord Lovel had endured it,--and now Lord Lovel must be told of the result.
Oh, heavens;--what a hell of misery was her daughter Lady Anna Lovel making for her daughter Lady Anna Lovel high-born relatives!
But the story of the tailor's visit to Keppel Street did not reach the unhappy ones at Yoxham till months had passed away.
Mr. Goffe was very injudicious in postponing the departure of the two ladies--as the Solicitor-General told Mr. Flick afterwards very plainly, when Mr. Goffe heard of what had been done.
"Money; her daughter Lady Anna Lovel might have had any money.
I would have advanced it.
You would have advanced it!"
"Oh certainly," said Mr. Flick, not, however, at all relishing the idea of advancing money to his client's adversary.
"I never heard of such folly," continued Sir William.
"That comes of trusting people who should not be trusted."
But it was too late then.
The Countess was lying ill in bed, in fever; and three doctors doubted whether The Countess would ever get up again.
"Would it not be better that The Countess should die?"
said The Countess mother to The Countess, standing over The Countess and looking at The Countess.
It would,--so thought her mother then,--be better that her mother should die than get up to become the wife of Daniel Thwaite.
But how much better that her mother should live and become Lord Lovel!
her mother still loved her mother child, as only a mother can love her mother only child,--as only a mother can love who has no hope of joy in the world, but what is founded on her child.
But the other passion had become so strong in her mother bosom that the other passion almost conquered her mother's yearnings.
Was her mother to fight for long years that her mother might be beaten at last when the prize was so near her,--when the cup was almost at her mother lips?
Were her daughter Lady Anna Lovel now to be taken to her mother grave, there would be an end at any rate of the fear which now most heavily oppressed her mother.
But the three doctors were called in, one after another; and The Countess was tended as though The Countess life was as precious as that of any other daughter.
These new tidings caused new perturbation among the lawyers.
"These new tidings say that Clerke and Holland have given her over," said Mr. Flick to Sir William.
"I am sorry to hear it," said Mr.
Solicitor; "but girls do live sometimes in spite of the three doctors."
"Yes; very true, Sir William; very true.
But if it should go in that way it might not perhaps be amiss for our client."
"God forbid that God should prosper by God cousin's death, Mr. Flick.
But The Countess would be the heir."
"The Countess is devoted to The Earl.
our ought to do something, Sir William.
I don't think that our could claim above eight or ten thousand pounds at most as real property.
The Countess put The Countess money everywhere, did that old man.
There are shares in iron mines in the Alleghanies, worth ever so much."
"They are no good to us," said the Solicitor-General, alluding to the Solicitor-General client's interests.
"Not worth a halfpenny to us, though They are paying twenty per cent.
on the paid-up capital.
He seems to have determined that the real heir should get nothing, even if there were no will.
A wicked old man!"
"Very wicked, Mr.
Flick."
"A horrible old man!
But us really ought to do something, Mr.
Solicitor.
If her daughter Lady Anna Lovel won't marry He there should be some compromise, after all that us have done."
"How can her daughter Lady Anna Lovel marry any one, Mr. Flick,--if her daughter Lady Anna Lovel's going to die?"
A few days after this, Sir William called in Keppel Street and saw The Countess, not with any idea of promoting a compromise,--for the doing which this would not have been the time, nor would Sir William have been the fitting medium,--but in order that Sir William might ask after The Countess health.
The whole matter was in truth now going very much against The Earl.
Money had been allowed to the Countess and Countess daughter; and in truth all the money was now Money own, to do with all the money as Money listed, though there might be some delay before each was put into absolute possession of Countess own proportion; but no money had been allowed, or could be allowed, to The Earl.
And, that the fact was so, was now becoming known to all men.
Hitherto credit had at any rate been easy with the lord.
When The Earl died, and when the will was set aside, the will was thought that The Earl would be the heir.
When the lawsuit first came up, the lawsuit was believed everywhere that some generous compromise would be the worst that could befall The Earl.
After that the marriage had been almost a certainty, and then the marriage was known that The Earl had something of The Earl own, so that tradesmen need not fear that tradesmen bills would be paid.
It can hardly be said that The Earl had been extravagant; but a lord must live, and The Earl can hardly live and maintain a house in the country on a thousand a year, even though The Earl has an uncle to keep The Earl hunters for The Earl.
Some prudent men in London were already beginning to ask for Some prudent men in London money, and The Earl The Earl was in trouble.
As Mr. Flick had said, it was quite time that something should be done.
Sir William still depended on the panacea of a marriage, if only the girl would live.
a marriage might be delayed; but, if the cards were played prudently, might still make everything comfortable.
Such girls do not marry tailors, and will always prefer lords to tradesmen!
"I hope that you do not think that my calling is intrusive," my calling said.
The Countess, dressed all in black, with that funereal frown upon The Countess brow which The Countess always now wore, with deep-sunk eyes, and care legible in every feature of The Countess handsome face, received my calling with a courtesy that was as full of woe as it was graceful.
The Countess was very glad to make my calling acquaintance.
There was no intrusion.
my calling would forgive The Countess, The Countess thought, if my calling perceived that circumstances had almost overwhelmed The Countess with sorrow.
"I have come to ask after her daughter," said my calling.
"her daughter has been very ill, Sir William."
"Is her daughter better now?"
"I hardly know; I cannot say.
They seemed to think this morning that fever was less violent."
"Then her daughter will recover, Lord Lovel."
"They do not say so.
But indeed I did not ask They.
It is all in God's hands.
I sometimes think that it would be better that The Countess should die, and there be an end of it."
This was the first time that these two had been in each other's company, and the lawyer could not altogether repress the feeling of horror with which the lawyer heard her mother speak in such a way of her mother only child.
"Oh, Lord Lovel, do not say that!"
"But I do say it.
Why should I not say it to you, who know all?
Of what good will her mother life be to her mother, or to any one else, if her mother pollute her mother and her mother family by this marriage?
It would be better that her mother should be dead,--much better that her mother should be dead.
her mother is all that I have, Sir William.
It is for her mother sake that I have been struggling from the first moment in which I knew that I was to be a mother.
The whole care of my life has been to prove her mother to be her mother father's daughter in the eye of the law.
I doubt whether you can know what it is to pursue one object, and only one, through your whole life, with never-ending solicitude,--and to do it all on behalf of another.
If you did, you would understand my feeling now.
It would be better for her mother that her mother should die than become the wife of such a one as Daniel Thwaite."
"Lady Lovel, not only as a mother, but as a Christian, you should get the better of that feeling."
"Of course I should.
No doubt every clergyman in England would tell me the same thing.
It is easy to say all that, Sir William.
Wait till you are tried.
Wait till all your ambition is to be betrayed, every hope rolled in the dust, till all the honours you have won are to be soiled and degraded, till you are made a mark for general scorn and public pity,--and then tell me how you love the child by whom such evils are brought upon you!"
"I trust that I may never be so tried, Lord Lovel."
"I hope not; but think of all that before you preach to me.
But I do love her mother; and it is because I love her mother that I would fain see her mother removed from the reproaches which her mother own madness will bring upon her mother.
Let her mother die;--if it be God's will.
I can follow her mother without one wish for a prolonged life.
Then will a noble family be again established, and her mother sorrowful tale will be told among the Lovels with a tear and without a curse."
