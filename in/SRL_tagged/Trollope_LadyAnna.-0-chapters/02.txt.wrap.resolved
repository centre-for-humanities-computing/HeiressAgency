 THE EARLY HISTORY OF LADY LOVEL.   Women have often been hardly used by men, but perhaps no harder usage, no fiercer cruelty was ever experienced by a woman than that which fell to the lot of Josephine Murray from the hands of LADY LOVEL, to whom Josephine Murray was married in the parish church of Applethwaite,--a parish without a village, lying among the mountains of Cumberland,--on the 1st of June, 181--. That Josephine Murray marriage was valid according to all the forms of the Church, if LADY LOVEL were then capable of marrying, no one ever doubted; nor did the Earl ever allege that the Earl was not so. Lovel Grange is a small house, surrounded by a small domain,--small as being the residence of a rich nobleman, lying among the mountains which separate Cumberland from Westmoreland, about ten miles from Keswick, very lovely, from the brightness of Lovel Grange own green sward and the luxuriance of Lovel Grange wild woodland, from the contiguity of overhanging mountains, and from the beauty of Lovel Tarn, a small lake belonging to the property, studded with little islands, each of which is covered with Lovel Grange own thicket of hollies, birch, and dwarfed oaks. a small house, surrounded by a small domain,--small as being the residence of a rich nobleman, lying among the mountains which separate Cumberland from Westmoreland, about ten miles from Keswick, very lovely, from the brightness of its own green sward and the luxuriance of its wild woodland, from the contiguity of overhanging mountains, and from the beauty of Lovel Tarn, a small lake belonging to the property, studded with little islands, each of which is covered with its own thicket of hollies, birch, and dwarfed oaks is poor, ill built, with straggling passages and low rooms, and is a sombre, ill-omened looking place. When Josephine Murray was brought there as a bride Josephine Murray thought it to be very sombre and ill-omened; but Josephine Murray loved the lakes and mountains, and dreamed of some vague mysterious joy of life which was to come to Josephine Murray from the wildness of Josephine Murray domicile.  I fear that Josephine Murray had no other ground, firmer than this, on which to found Josephine Murray hopes of happiness. Josephine Murray could not have thought Lord Lovel to be a good man when Josephine Murray married Lord Lovel, and Lord Lovel can hardly be said that Josephine Murray loved Lord Lovel. Josephine Murray was then twenty-four years old, and Lord Lovel had counted double as many years. Josephine Murray was very beautiful, dark, with large, bold, blue eyes, with hair almost black, tall, well made, almost robust, a well-born, brave, ambitious woman, of whom it must be acknowledged that Josephine Murray thought it very much to be the wife of a lord. Though our story will be concerned much with Josephine Murray sufferings, the record of Josephine Murray bridal days may be very short. It is with struggles that came to Josephine Murray in after years that we shall be most concerned, and the reader, therefore, need be troubled with no long description of Josephine Murray as Josephine Murray was when Josephine Murray became the Countess Lovel. It is hoped that Josephine Murray wrongs may be thought worthy of sympathy,--and may be felt in some sort to atone for the ignoble motives of Josephine Murray marriage.  The Earl, when he found he bride, had been living almost in solitude for a twelvemonth. Among the neighbouring gentry in the lake country he kept no friendly relations. he property there was small, and he character was evil. he was an English earl, and as such known in some unfamiliar fashion to those who know all earls; but he was a man never seen in Parliament, who had spent the greater part of he manhood abroad, who had sold estates in other counties, converting unentailed acres into increased wealth, but wealth of a kind much less acceptable to the general English aristocrat than that which comes direct from land. Lovel Grange was Lovel Grange only remaining English property, and when in London Lovel Grange had rooms at an hotel. Lovel Grange never entertained, and Lovel Grange never accepted hospitality. It was known of Lovel Grange that Lovel Grange was very rich, and men said that Lovel Grange was mad. Such was Captain Murray.  Lovel Grange had found Josephine Murray near Keswick, living with Josephine Murray father in a pretty cottage looking down upon Derwentwater,--a thorough gentleman, for Captain Murray had come of the right Murrays;--and thence Captain Murray had carried Josephine Murray to Lovel Grange. Josephine Murray had brought with Josephine Murray no penny of fortune, and no settlement had been made on Josephine Murray. Josephine Murray father, who was then an old man, had mildly expostulated; but the ambition of the daughter had prevailed, and the marriage was accomplished. Josephine Murray was carried off as a bride. It will be unnecessary to relate what efforts had been made to take Josephine Murray away from her father's house without bridal honours; but it must be told that the Earl was a man who had never yet spared a woman in the Earl lust. It had been the rule, almost the creed of the Earl life, that woman was made to gratify the appetite of man, and that the Earl is but a poor creature who does not lay hold of the sweetness that is offered to the Earl. the Earl had so lived as to teach the Earl that those men who devote those men who devote themselves to their wives to those men who devote themselves to their wives wives, as a wife devotes a wife to a wife husband, are the poor lubberly clods of creation, who had lacked the power to reach the only purpose of living which could make life worth having. Women had been to the Earl a prey, as the fox is a prey to the huntsman and the salmon to the angler. But the Earl had acquired great skill in the Earl sport, and could pursue the Earl game with all the craft which experience will give. the Earl could look at a woman as though the Earl saw all heaven in a woman eyes, and could listen to a woman as though the music of the spheres was to be heard in a woman voice. Then the Earl could whisper words which, to many women, were as the music of the spheres, and the Earl could persevere, abandoning all other pleasures, devoting the Earl to the one wickedness with a perseverance which almost made success certain. But with a woman the Earl could be successful on no other terms than those which enabled a woman to walk out of the church with the Earl as Countess Lovel.  a woman had not lived with the Earl six months before the Earl told a woman that the marriage was no marriage, and that a woman was--the Earl mistress. There was an audacity about the man which threw aside all fear of the law, and which was impervious to threats and interference. the Earl assured a woman that the Earl loved a woman, and that a woman was welcome to live with the Earl; but that a woman was not the Earl wife, and that the child which a woman bore could not be the heir to the Earl title, and could claim no heirship to the Earl property. the Earl did love her,--having found a woman to be a woman of whose company the Earl had not tired in six months. the Earl was going back to Italy, and the Earl offered to take a woman with him,--but the Earl could not, the Earl said, permit the farce of a woman remaining at Lovel Grange and calling a woman the Countess Lovel. If a woman chose to go with the Earl to Palermo, where the Earl had a castle, and to remain with the Earl in the Earl yacht, a woman might for the present travel under the name of the Earl wife. But a woman must know that a woman was not his wife. a woman was only his mistress.  Of course a woman told a woman father. Of course a woman invoked every Murray in and out of Scotland. Of course there were many threats. A duel was fought up near London, in which the Countess Lovel consented to be shot at twice,--declaring that after that the Countess Lovel did not think that the circumstances of the case required that the Countess Lovel should be shot at any more. In the midst of this a daughter was born to a daughter and a daughter died,--during which time a daughter was still allowed to live at Lovel Grange. But what was it expedient that a daughter should do? He declared that He had a former wife when He married a former wife, and that therefore a former wife was not and could not be He wife. Should a former wife institute a prosecution against He for bigamy, thereby acknowledging that a former wife was a former wife no wife and that a former wife child was illegitimate? From such evidence as a former wife could get, a former wife believed that the Italian woman whom the Earl in former years had married had died before a former wife own marriage. the Earl in former years declared that the Countess, the real Countess, had not paid a former wife debt to nature, till some months after the little ceremony which had taken place in Applethwaite Church. In a moment of weakness a former wife fell at his feet and asked his to renew the little ceremony which had taken place in Applethwaite Church. his stooped over a former wife, kissed a former wife, and smiled. "My pretty child," his said, "why should I do that?" his never kissed a former wife again.  What should a former wife do? Before a former wife had decided, his was in his yacht sailing to Palermo;--sailing no doubt not alone. What should a former wife do? his had left a former wife an income,--sufficient for the cast-off mistress of an Earl,--some few hundreds a year, on condition that a former wife would quietly leave Lovel Grange, cease to call a former wife a Countess, and take a former wife and a former wife bairn,--whither a former wife would. Every abode of sin in London was open to a former wife for what Every abode of sin in London cared. But what should a former wife do? It seemed to a former wife to be incredible that so great a wrong should befall a former wife, and that Every abode of sin in London should escape from a former wife and be free from punishment,--unless a former wife chose to own the baseness of a former wife own position by prosecuting Every abode of sin in London for bigamy. The Murrays were not very generous in The Murrays succour, as Every abode of sin in London had been much blamed for giving Every abode of sin in London to one of whom all the world knew nothing but evil. One a woman had fired two shots on One Murray behalf, in answer to each one of which the Earl in former years had fired into the air; but beyond this The Murrays could do nothing. a former wife was haughty and proud, conscious that a former wife rank was greater than that of any of the Murrays with whom a former wife came in contact. But what should a former wife do?  the Earl in former years had been gone five years, sailing about the world the Earl in former years knew not where, when at last the Earl in former years determined to institute a prosecution for bigamy. During five years the Earl in former years was still living at Lovel Grange, with the Earl in former years , and the Courts of Law had allotted the Earl in former years some sum by way of alimony till the Earl in former years cause should be decided; but upon alimony the Earl in former years found alimony very difficult to lay the Earl in former years hands,--quite impossible to lay the Earl in former years hands upon the entirety of her hands. And then it came to pass that the Earl in former years was eaten up by lawyers and tradesmen, and fell into bad repute as asserting that claims made against the Earl in former years, should legally be made against the very man whom the Earl in former years was about to prosecute because the Earl in former years the very man whom she was about to prosecute . And this went on till further life at Lovel Grange became impossible to the Earl in former years.  In those days there was living in Keswick a certain Mr. Thomas Thwaite, a tailor, who by degrees had taken a strong part in denouncing the wrongs to which the Countess Lovel had been subjected. the Countess Lovel was a powerful, sturdy man, with good means for the Countess Lovel position, a well-known Radical in a county in which Radicals have never been popular, and in which fifty years ago they were much rarer than they are now. At this time Keswick and Keswick vicinities were beginning to be known as the abodes of poets, and Thomas Thwaite was acquainted with Southey and Wordsworth. Thomas Thwaite was an intelligent, up-standing, impulsive man, who thought well of Thomas Thwaite own position in the world, and who could speak Thomas Thwaite mind. Thomas Thwaite was tall, massive, and square; tender-hearted and very generous; and Thomas Thwaite hated the Earl in former years with all Thomas Thwaite heart. Once the two men had met since the story of the Countess's wrongs had become known, and the tailor had struck the Earl in former years to the ground. This had occurred as the Earl in former years was leaving Lovel Grange, and when the Earl in former years was starting on the Earl in former years long journey. The scene took place after the Earl in former years had parted from the Earl in former years Countess,--whom the Earl in former years never was to see again. the Earl in former years rose to his feet and rushed at the tailor; but the two were separated, and the Earl in former years thought it best to go on upon his long journey. Nothing further was done as to the blow, and many years rolled by before the Earl in former years came back to Cumberland.  It became impossible for the Countess and Countess daughter, the young Lady Anna as Countess was usually called, to remain at Lovel Grange, and the Countess and her daughter, the young Lady Anna were taken to the house of Thomas Thwaite, in Keswick, as a temporary residence. At this time the Countess was in debt, and already there were lawsuits as to the practicability of obtaining payment of those debts from the husband's estate. And as soon as it was determined that the prosecution for bigamy should be instituted, the confusion in this respect was increased. the Countess the Countess ceased to call the Countess a countess, as the Countess certainly would not be a countess should the Countess succeed in proving the Earl in former years to have been guilty. And had the Earl in former years been guilty of bigamy, the decree under which alimony was assigned to the Countess would become void. Should the Countess succeed, the Countess would be a penniless unmarried female with a daughter, the Countess would be unfathered and base, and he,--as far as the Countess could see,--would be beyond the reach of punishment. But, in truth, the Countess and the Countess friend the tailor were not in quest of success. the Countess and all the Countess friends believed that the Earl in former years had committed no such crime. But if the Earl in former years were acquitted, then would the Countess claim to be called the Countess Lovel, and to enjoy the appanages of the Countess rank, be substantiated. Or, at least, something would have been done towards substantiating those claims. But during this time the Countess called the Countess Mrs. Murray, and the little Lady Anna was called Anna Murray.  It added much to the hardship of the Countess's case that public sympathy in distant parts of the country,--up in London, and in southern counties, and even among a portion of the gentry in Cumberland and Westmoreland,--did not go with the Countess. the Countess had married without due care. Some men said,--and many women repeated the story,--that the Countess had known of the existence of the former wife, when the Countess had married the Earl in former years. the Countess had run into debt, and then repudiated the Countess debts. the Countess was now residing in the house of a low radical tailor, who had assaulted the man the Countess called the Countess husband; and the Countess was living under the Countess maiden name. Tales were told of the Countess which were utterly false,--as when it was said that the Countess drank. Others were reported which had in Others some grains of truth,--as that the Countess was violent, stiff-necked, and vindictive. Had Others said of the Countess that it had become the Countess one religion to assert the Countess daughter's right,--per fas aut nefas,--to assert it by right or wrong; to do justice to the Countess let what injustice might be done to the Countess or others,--then the truth would have been spoken.  the woman's case dragged the woman's case on slowly, and little Anna Murray was a child of nine years old when at last the Earl in former years was acquitted of the criminal charge which had been brought against the Earl in former years. During all this time the Earl in former years had been absent. Even had there been a wish to bring the Earl in former years personally into court, the law would have been powerless to reach the Earl in former years. But there was no such wish. no such wish had been found impossible to prove the former marriage, which had taken place in Sicily;--or if not impossible, at least no adequate proof was forthcoming. There was no real desire that there should be such proof. the Earl in former years's lawyers abstained, as far as The Earl's lawyers could abstain, from taking any steps in the matter. The Earl's lawyers spent what money was necessary, and the Attorney-General of the day defended the Attorney-General of the day. In doing so, the Attorney-General of the day declared that the Attorney-General of the day had nothing to do with the Earl in former years's treatment of the lady who now called the Earl in former years Mrs. Murray. the Attorney-General of the day knew nothing of the circumstances of that connection, and would not travel beyond the Attorney-General of the day brief. the Attorney-General of the day was there to defend the Countess Lovel on a charge of bigamy. This the Attorney-General of the day did successfully, and the Earl in former years the Earl in former years was acquitted. Then, in court, the counsel for the wife declared that the counsel for the wife client would again call the wife Lady Lovel.  But it was not so easy to induce other people to call the wife .  And now not only was the wife much hampered by money difficulties, but so also was the tailor. But Thomas Thwaite never for a moment slackened in Thomas Thwaite labours to make good the position of the woman whom Thomas Thwaite had determined to succour; and for another and a longer period of eight years the battle went on. the battle went on very slowly, as is the wont with such battles; and very little way was made. the world, as a rule, did not believe that the wife who now again called the wife the Countess Lovel was entitled to that name. The Murrays, the wife own people,--as far as The Murrays, her own people,--as were the wife own people,--had been taught to doubt the wife claim. If the wife were a countess why had the wife thrown the wife into the arms of an old tailor? Why did the wife let the wife daughter play with the tailor's child,--if, in truth, her daughter was the little Lady Anna? Why, above all things, was the name of the little Lady Anna allowed to be mentioned, as it was mentioned, in connection with that of Daniel Thwaite, the tailor's son?  During these eight weary years the little Lady Anna so the little Lady Anna shall be called,--lived in a small cottage about a mile from Keswick, on the road to Grassmere and Ambleside, which the little Lady Anna rented from quarter to quarter. the little Lady Anna still obtained a certain amount of alimony, which, however, was dribbled out to the little Lady Anna through various sieves, and which reached the little Lady Anna with protestations as to the impossibility of obtaining anything like the moderate sum which had been awarded to the little Lady Anna. And it came at last to be the case that the little Lady Anna hardly knew what the little Lady Anna was struggling to obtain. It was, of course, the little Lady Anna object that all the world should acknowledge the little Lady Anna to be the Countess Lovel, and her daughter to be the little Lady Anna. But all the world could not be made to do this by course of law. Nor could law make the little Lady Anna lord come home and live with the little Lady Anna, even such a cat and dog life as must in such case have been hers. the little Lady Anna money rights were all that the little Lady Anna could demand;--and the little Lady Anna found it to be impossible to get anybody to tell the little Lady Anna what were Her money rights. To be kept out of the poorhouse seemed to be all that the little Lady Anna could claim. But the old tailor was true to her,--swearing that the little Lady Anna should even yet become Countess Lovel in very truth.  Then, of a sudden, the little Lady Anna heard one Countess Lovel was again at Lovel Grange, living there with a strange woman.
