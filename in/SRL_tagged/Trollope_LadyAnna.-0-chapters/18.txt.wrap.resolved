 THE JOURNEY HOME.   In absolute silence Lord Lovel and Lady Anna walked back to the inn. Lord Lovel had been dumbfoundered,--nearly so by Lady Anna first abrupt statement, and then altogether by the arguments with which Lady Anna had defended Lady Anna. Lady Anna had nothing further to say. Lady Anna had, indeed, said all, and had marvelled at Lady Anna own eloquence while Lady Anna was speaking. Nor was there absent from Lady Anna a certain pride in that Lady Anna had done the thing that was right, and had dared to defend Lady Anna. Lady Anna was full of regrets,--almost of remorse; but, nevertheless, Lady Anna was proud. He knew it all now, and one of Lady Anna great difficulties had been overcome.  And Lady Anna was fully resolved that as Lady Anna had dared to tell He, and to face He anger, He reproaches, He scorn, Lady Anna would not falter before the scorn and the reproaches, or the anger, of the other Lovels,--of any of the Lovels of Yoxham. Lady Anna mother's reproaches would be dreadful to Lady Anna; Her mother's anger would well-nigh kill Lady Anna; Her mother's scorn would scorch Lady Anna very soul. But sufficient for the day was the evil thereof. At the present moment Lady Anna could be strong with the strength Lady Anna had assumed. So Lady Anna walked in at the sitting-room window with a bold front, and the Earl followed Lady Anna. The two aunts were there, and it was plain to The two aunts both that something was astray between the lovers. The two aunts had said among The two aunts that Lady Anna would accept the offer the moment that it was in form made to Lady Anna. To The two aunts eyes the manner of The two aunts guest had been the manner of a girl eager to be wooed; but The two aunts had both imagined that The two aunts delicately nurtured and fastidious nephew might too probably be offended by some solecism in conduct, some falling away from feminine grace, such as might too readily be shown by one whose early life had been subjected to rough associates. Even now it occurred to each of The two aunts that it had been so. the Earl the Earl seated the Earl in a chair, and took up a book, which they had brought with they. Lady Anna stood at the open window, looking across at the broad field and the river bank beyond; but neither of they spoke a word. There had certainly been some quarrel. Then aunt Julia, in the cause of wisdom, asked a question;--  "Where is Minnie? Did Minnie Minnie go with you?"  "No," said the Earl. "Lady Anna went in some other direction at my bidding. Mr. Cross is with Lady Anna, I suppose." It was evident from the tone of Mr. Cross voice that the displeasure of the head of all the Lovels was very great.  "We start soon, I suppose?" said Lady Anna.  "After lunch, my dear; it is hardly one yet."  "I will go up all the same, and see about my things."  "Shall I help you, my dear?" asked Mrs. Lovel.  "Oh, no! I would sooner do it alone." Then Lady Anna hurried into Lady Anna room and burst into a flood of tears, as soon as the door was closed behind Lady Anna.  "Frederic, what ails Lady Anna?" asked aunt Julia.  "If anything ails Lady Anna Lady Anna must tell you Lady Anna," said the lord.  "Something is amiss. You cannot wonder that We should be anxious, knowing that We know how great is the importance of all this."  "I cannot help your anxiety just at present, aunt Juliaaunt Julia; but you should always remember that there will be slips between the cup and the lip."  "Then there has been a slip? I knew it would be so. I always said so, and so did my brother."  "I wish you would all remember that about such an affair as this, the less said the better." So saying, the lord walked out through the window and sauntered down to the river side.  "It's all over," said aunt Julia.  "I don't see why we should suppose that at present," said aunt Jane.  "It's all over. I knew it as soon as I saw Lady Anna face when Lady Anna came in. Lady Anna has said something, or done something, and it's all off. It will be a matter of over twenty thousand pounds a year!"  "the lord'll be sure to marry somebody with money," said aunt Jane. "What with the lord title and the lord being so handsome, the lord is certain to do well, you know."  "Nothing like that will come in the lord way. I heard Mr. Flick say that it was equal to half a million of money. And then it was equal to half a million of money would have been at once. If Mr. Flick goes up to London, and about, just as Mr. Flick is, Mr. Flick'll be head over ears in debt before anybody knows what Mr. Flick is doing. I wonder what it is. Mr. Flick likes pretty girls, and there's no denying that she's handsome."  "Perhaps she wouldn't have Mr. Flick."  "That's impossible, aunt Jane. aunt Jane came down here on purpose to have Mr. Flick. aunt Jane went out with Mr. Flick this morning to be made love to. They were together three times longer yesterday, and Mr. Flick came home as sweet as sugar to aunt Jane. I wonder whether aunt Jane can have wanted to make some condition about the money."  "What condition?"  "That aunt Jane and aunt Jane mother should have it in she and her mother own keeping."  "aunt Jane doesn't seem to be that sort of a young woman," said aunt Jane.  "There's no knowing what that Mr. Goffe, Serjeant Bluestone, and her mother may have put her mother up to. Frederic wouldn't stand that kind of thing for a minute, and Frederic would be quite right. Better anything than that a man shouldn't be a man own master. I think you'd better go up to aunt Jane, aunt Jane. aunt Jane'll be more comfortable with aunt Jane than with me." Then aunt aunt Jane, obedient as usual, went up to aunt Jane young cousin's bedroom.  In the meantime the young lord was standing on the river's brink, thinking what the young lord would do. the young lord had, in truth, very much of which to think, and points of most vital importance as to which the young lord must resolve what should be the young lord action. Must this announcement which the young lord had heard from the young lord cousin dissolve for ever the prospect of his cousin marriage with her; or was it open to his cousin still, as a nobleman, a gentleman, and a man of honour, to make use of all those influences which his cousin might command with the view of getting rid of that impediment of a previous engagement? Being very ignorant of the world at large, and altogether ignorant of this man in particular, his cousin did not doubt that the tailor might be bought off. Then his cousin was sure that all who would have access to Lady Anna would help his cousin in such a cause, and that Lady Anna own mother would be the most forward to do so. Lady Anna would hardly hold to such a purpose if all the world,--all Lady Anna own world, were against Lady Anna. Lady Anna certainly would be beaten from it if a bribe sufficient were offered to the tailor. That this must be done for the sake of the Lovel family, so that Lady Anna Lovel might not be known to have married a tailor, was beyond a doubt; but it was not so clear to his cousin that his cousin could take to his cousin as his cousin Countess her who with Lady Anna own lips had told his cousin that Lady Anna intended to be the bride of a working artisan. As his cousin thought of this, as his cousin imagination went to work on all the abominable circumstances of such a betrothal, his cousin threw from his cousin hand into the stream with all the vehemence of passion a little twig which his cousin held. It was too, too frightful, too disgusting; and then so absolutely unexpected, so unlike her personal demeanour, so contrary to the look of her eyes, to the tone of her voice, to every motion of her body! her had been sweet, and gentle, and gracious, till he had almost come to think that her natural feminine gifts of ladyship were more even than her wealth, of better savour than her rank, were equal even to her beauty, which he had sworn to he during the past night to be unsurpassed. And this sweet one had told him,--this one so soft and gracious,--not that her was doomed by some hard fate to undergo the degrading thraldom, but that her herself had willingly given her to a working tailor from love, and gratitude, and free selection! It was a marvel to he that a thing so delicate should have so little sense of her own delicacy! he did not think that he could condescend to take the tailor's place.  But if not,--if he would not take it, or if, as might still be possible, the tailor's place could not be made vacant for him,--what then? he had pledged he belief in the justice of he 's claim; and had told his cousin that, believing he own claim to be unjust, in no case would he prosecute no case. Was he now bound by that assurance,--bound to it even to the making of the tailor's fortune; or might he absent he from any further action in the matter, leaving it entirely in the hands of the lawyers? Might it not be best for her happiness that he should do so? he had been told that even though he should not succeed, there might arise almost interminable delay. The tailor would want The tailor money before The tailor married, and thus he married might be rescued from he married degradation till he married should be old enough to understand it. And yet how could he claim that of which he had said, now a score of times, that he knew that it was not he own? Could he cease to call Lady Anna by the name which all he people had acknowledged as Lady Anna own, because Lady Anna had refused to be he wife; and declare he conviction that Lady Anna was base-born only because Lady Anna had preferred to he own the addresses of a low-born man, reeking with the sweat of a tailor's board? No, he could not do that. Let Lady Anna marry but the sweeper of a crossing, and he must still call Lady Anna Lady Anna,--if he called Lady Anna anything.  Something must be done, however. he had been told by the lawyers how the matter might be made to right the matter, if he and the young lady could at once agree to be man and wife; but he had not been told what would follow, should the young lady decline to accept he offer. Mr. Flick and the Solicitor-General must know how to shape Mr. Flick and the Solicitor-General course before November came round,--and would no doubt want all the time to shape it that he could give Mr. Flick and the Solicitor-General. What was he to say to Mr. Flick and the Solicitor-Generalthe Solicitor-General? Was he at liberty to tell to Mr. Flick and the Solicitor-General the secret which Lady Anna had told to he? That he was at liberty to say that Lady Anna had rejected his offer must be a matter of course; but might he go beyond that, and tell Mr. Flick and the Solicitor-General the whole story? It would be most expedient for many reasons that Mr. Flick and the Solicitor-General should know it. On Lady Anna behalf even it might be most salutary,--with that view of liberating Lady Anna from the grasp of Lady Anna humiliating lover. But Lady Anna had told it he, against Lady Anna own interests, at Lady Anna own peril, to Lady Anna own infinite sorrow,--in order that Lady Anna might thus allay hopes in which he would otherwise have persevered. he knew enough of the little schemes and by-ways of love, of the generosity and self-sacrifice of lovers, to feel that he was bound to confidence. Lady Anna had told he that if needs were he might repeat Lady Anna tale;--but Lady Anna had told he at the same time that Lady Anna tale was a secret. he could not go with a secret to a lawyer's chambers, and there divulge in the course of business that which had been extracted from Lady Anna by the necessity to which Lady Anna had submitted of setting he free. he could write to Mr. Flick,--if that at last was Mr. Flick,--if resolve,--that a marriage was altogether out of the question, but he could not tell Mr. Flick,--if why it was so.  he wandered slowly on along the river, having decided only on this,--only on this as a certainty,--that he must tell Lady Anna secret neither to the lawyers, nor to he own people. Then, as he walked, a little hand touched he behind, and when he turned Lady Anna Lovel took he by the arm. "Why are you all alone, Fred?"  "I am meditating how wicked the world is,--and girls in particular."  "Where is cousin Anna?"  "Up at the house, I suppose."  "Is cousin Anna wicked?"  "Don't you know that everybody is wicked, because Eve ate the apple?"  "Adam ate it too."  "Who bade Adam?"  "The devil," said the child whispering.  "But Adam spoke by a woman's mouth. Why don't you go in and get ready to go?"  "So I will. Tell me one thing, Fred. May I be a bridesmaid when you are married?"  "I don't think you can."  "I have set my heart upon my heart. Why not?"  "Because you'll be married first."  "That's nonsense, Fred; and you know it's nonsense. Isn't cousin Anna to be your wife?"  "Look here, my darling. I'm awfully fond of you, and think you the prettiest little girl in the world. But if you ask impertinent questions I'll never speak to you again. Do you understand?" your wife looked up into his face, and did understand that his was in earnest, and, leaving his, walked slowly across the meadow back to the house. "Tell them not to wait lunch for your wife," his hollowed after her;--and your wife told your wife aunt Julia that Frederic was very sulky down by the river, and that they were not to wait for Frederic.  When Lady Anna Lovel went up-stairs into cousin Anna room not a word was said about the occurrence of the morning. cousin Anna was afraid to ask a question, and the younger was fully determined to tell nothing even had a question been asked cousin Anna. Lady Anna Lovel might say what Lady Anna Lovel pleased. cousin Anna secret was with Lady Anna Lovel, and Lady Anna Lovel could tell Her secret if Lady Anna Lovel chose. cousin Anna had given Lady Anna Lovel permission to do so, of which no doubt Lady Anna Lovel would avail Lady Anna Lovel. But, on cousin Anna own account, cousin Anna would say nothing; and when questioned cousin Anna would merely admit the fact. cousin Anna would neither defend cousin Anna engagement, nor would cousin Anna submit to have her engagement censured. If they pleased cousin Anna would return to cousin Anna mother in London at any shortest possible notice.  The party lunched almost in silence, and when the horses were ready Lady Anna Lovel came in to help the horses into the carriage. When Lady Anna Lovel had placed the three ladies Lady Anna Lovel desired Minnie to take the fourth seat, saying that Lady Anna Lovel would sit with Mr. Cross on the box. Minnie looked at his face, but there was still the frown there, and Minnie obeyed Lady Anna Lovel without any remonstrance. During the whole of the long journey home there was hardly a word spoken. Lady Anna knew that Lady Anna was in disgrace, and was ignorant how much of Lady Anna story had been told to the two elder ladies. Lady Anna sat almost motionless looking out upon the fields, and accepting Lady Anna position as one that was no longer thought worthy of notice. Of course Lady Anna must go back to London. Lady Anna could not continue to live at Yoxham, neither spoken to nor speaking. Minnie went to sleep, and Minnie's mother and aunt now and then addressed a few words to each other. Lady Anna felt sure that to the latest day of Lady Anna existence Lady Anna would remember that journey. On their arrival at the Rectory door Mr. Cross helped the two elder ladies out of the carriage, while Lady Anna Lovel affected to make Lady Anna Lovel busy with the shawls and luggage. Then Lady Anna Lovel vanished, and was seen no more till Lady Anna Lovel appeared at dinner.  "What sort of a trip have you had?" asked the rector, addressing the rector to the two elder ladies indifferently.  For a moment nobody answered the rector, and then aunt Julia spoke. "It was very pretty, as It always is at Bolton in summer. We were told that the duke has not been there this year at all. The inn was comfortable, and I think that the young people enjoyed the young people yesterday very much." The subject was too important, too solemn, too great, to allow of even a word to be said about The subject without proper consideration.  "Did Frederic like it?"  "I think Frederic did yesterday," said Lady Anna Lovel. "I think We were all a little tired coming home to-day."  "Lady Anna sprained Lady Anna ankle, jumping over the Stryd," said Minnie.  "Not seriously, I hope."  "Oh dear no;--nothing at all to signify." It was the only word which Lady Anna spoke till it was suggested that Lady Anna should go up to Lady Anna room. Lady Anna obeyed, as a child might have done, and went up-stairs, followed by Lady Anna Lovel. "My dear," Lady Anna said, "we cannot go on like this. What is the matter?"  "You must ask Lady Anna Lovel."  "Have you quarrelled with Lady Anna Lovel?"  "I have not quarrelled, Lady Anna Lovel. If Lady Anna Lovel has quarrelled with me, I cannot help he has quarrelled with me."  "You know what We have all wished."  "It can never be so."  "Have you said so to Frederic?"  "I have."  "Have you given Frederic any reason, Lady Anna?"  "I have," Lady Anna said after a pause.  "What reason, dear?"  Lady Anna thought for a moment before Lady Anna replied. "I was obliged to tell Frederic the reason, Mrs. Lovel; but I don't think that I need tell anybody else. Of course I must tell mamma."  "Does your mamma know it?"  "Not yet."  "And is it a reason that must last for ever?"  "Yes;--for ever. But I do not know why everybody is to be angry with me. Other girls may do as Other girls please. If you are angry with me I had better go back to London at once."  "I do not know that anybody has been angry with you. We may be disappointed without being angry." That was all that was said, and then Lady Anna was left to dress for dinner. At dinner Lady Anna Lovel had so far composed Lady Anna Lovel as to be able to speak to Lady Anna Lovel cousin, and an effort at courtesy was made by them all,--except by the rector. But the evening passed away in a manner very different from any that had gone before the evening.
