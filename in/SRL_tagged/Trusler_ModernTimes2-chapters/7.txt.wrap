THE company I was to join was not the best equipped in the world; the manager had met with misfortunes. In removing from Winchester to Salisbury, the wagon conveying his wardrobe, scenery, etc. took fire from the dryness of the axle-trees, and destroyed his whole property. Property, in stage language, implies all the apparatus of the theater. and since this disaster, he had not been able to refit as before. He has come over to Salisbury for a piece of water, a clound or two, and a few odd things, and was upon his return to Winchester when he engaged me. He would have had me have made my appearance in tragedy; but, as farce was my forte, and as a player generally acquits himself best, in a part to which he has been accustomed, I determined to come out in the Mock Doctor, and as the character I had played of Dr. Savage, had furnished me with a dress, and his wardrobe was small, he the more readily consented. I soon made myself master of the part, and wished only for an opporunity of showing him what I could do. But the time was not come; for, though we had got to Winchester, which was to be our scene of action, the company had not met.  IN the interim we had a great deal to do; we had not only our theater to get ready, and sundry matters belonging to it to prepare, but we had an application to make to the mayor for leave to perform; and as he was a strange kind of man, our manager requested I would wait upon him for the purpose. He was an oilman by trade, as big round as one of his butts, had been exceedingly low bred, and was very proud of his office. When I entered his shop, he was serving a woman with a pennyworth of pickles, and was wrist-deep in the jar. On my telling him, I waited on him as mayor of the town; -- he put his dirty hand to my mouth, with a Hold friend, not a word till I Am in the Justice-room; so saying, having taken the money for his pickles, and wiped his hand on a filthy apron he had before him, he waddled into a back room, and desired me to follow him. When we were got into this place, which was something like a counting house, I began afresh: I have taken the liberty, Sir, -- but he again interrupted me with, Why friend, you're in a plaguey hurry. -- Let me get into my great chair first. -- I begged his worship's pardon, submitted to etiquette, and when he was fairly enthroned, I told him my business; that I was one of a company of players, just arrived at Winchester, and that as I understood he was mayor of the Corporation, I waited on him, to request his leave to perform. "Hark'ee, young man," says he, in a bellowing voice, though we civil Magistrates are mortal enemies to any thing that looks like an armed force; I Would rather dye'see, see a parcel of soldiers come into the town, than a parcel of playmen, to pick our pockets, and corrupt our wives and daughters, -- at the mention of these last words, his wife, who had been listening at the door, bolted into the room, and asked what business he was upon, that occasioned him to mention her. His worship immediately softened: his tone, and replied, Nothing, my dear, that concerns your; it is only a parcel of playmen that want to play their rig in the town, and I wont' let 'em. Not let 'em, Mr. Girkin! retorts she, and what is the matter you will not let 'em? If you want to be poplar you will let 'em, and there is nothing like being poplar, while one keeps shop But, do you know, my dear, returns his worship, what a world o'harm these player-volks does? A f -- t of the harm, says she, what is that to us? -- It will keep families up late, and we shall sell more candles, and oil on that account. Why, -- aye, to be sure, replies the mayor, the is something in that. -- What Is the hour, Mr. Playerman, you mean to show away? -- About half after six, I told him, and end about half after ten. "No," says he, that is too soon, shops are scarce shut by that time; make it seven and you shall have my consent; for the business of the day must be over, before I can suffer any may-games to take place. I told his worship we would obey his directions; and turning round to thank Mrs. Girkin for her seasonable interference; she gently slapped me on the shoulder, wished us success, and told me, if we played Alexander the Great the first night, she would certainly be there, for she loved Alexander to her life -- he was such a proper man. As I was going out at the door, his worship bawled out, -- Remember we sell oil and candles.  HAVING obtained permission to open our house, our next business was to find one to open; for since our manager's misfortune, a fresh company had taken possession of the town, and though these were playing at Southampton, it was not clear that we could have the use of their theater. On enquiry we found it as we expected, and had another place to prepare. This business delayed us some time, but it gave me an opportunity of learning a part or two to begin with, Alexander the Great exceeding the strength of our forces; for, when we mustered them on paper, we could not make a greater number, men, women, and children, than fifteen. It was settled, therefore, that the first piece got up should be Othello, or the Moor of Venice, and that I should take the part of the Moor. Having a tolerable good memory, I became perfect in it sooner than I expected, and our company dropped into town from different parts pretty nearly together. But our principal heroine had not made her appearance yet. Our manager told me, she belonged to a company in Buckinghamshire, and that he had some difficulty to engage her; however, he had happily succeeded and she would be his chief strength; for she was a very pretty woman and a good player both in tragedy and comedy, and had a very sweet pipe. She was to be my Desdemona.  WE soon procured a tolerable room and sufficiently large. It had been a carpenter's workshop, and was quickly fitted up for our purpose. As this lady sent us word that she could not join us till the week after we had proposed to open, we determined to commence without her, of course I had only to play in the after-piece, and had time to get up two or three more parts. As I was a new performer, it was proposed by our manager, that on the nights I and this new woman performed, the profits of the house should be divided into three parts, of which each of us should have one. This was a spur to my industry, and I was desirous to get up as many characters as I could. Among the rest were Romeo, Hamlet, Marplot, Archer, Benedict, and Bobadil.  THE entertainments given out for the first night were, the Journey to London, and the Mock Doctor; and though we designed to begin at seven, in compliment to the mayor, the house did not fill till near eight; and such was our misfortune, that we were obliged to study his worship's interest more than we intended, for we could not begin till the house was pretty nearly full, and sufficient money was taken at the door, to release our wardrobe from pawn. This circumstance I was not made acquainted with, till the house was opened. However, good luck stood our friend, we took eleven pounds presently, and that did the business. The clothes were brought in, and as our heads and legs were ready dressed, we had only to slip on the remainder. I was not in that predicament myself, being dressed in the character of Dr. Savage; yet I felt for the embarrassment of my friend the manager, and rejoiced with him at his delivery.  THE first night went off pretty well, no accident happening, but a piece of candle falling into the bushy part of Sir Francis's wig, which set fire to it; and Miss Jenny being almost pressed to death by Count Basset, who was beat down flat upon her, by the fall of a house, owing to the carelessness of one of the scene-shifters. The consequences, however, were no way fatal. The fire in Sir Francis's wig was soon extinguished, by my lady's wrapping up his head in her wet handkerchief; for having a cold, her nose had run profusely: and Miss Jenny gave us to understand, that there was no harm done to her, for as she lay on her back, the count's weight was not more than she could very well bear. It created a laugh in the house, and the audience departed in good humor.  It may be expected I should say something of myself, but modestry enjoins me to say no more, than, Dr. Savage being only a mock-doctor, I was equally at home both in one part and the other. Whether it was owing to me or the other performers, I will not pretend to determine; but the farce was so much liked, that we played nothing else for six successive nights, and the house was always full. It held seventeen pounds, and as the expenses were eleven, the manager put six in his pocket; but, not considering me yet as part of his establishment, out of these six he gave me one, and as we performed three times a week, I thought it a great deal of money.  FINDING we were likely to succeed, we enlarged our theater, and made it hold twenty-seven pounds; and we added an additional fiddle to our band, which before consisted only of two violins and a violincello; for we had it in contemplation to perform comic operas. Two of our company, indeed, could not sing, but we had a plan to make up the deficiency. Whenever they had a song to sing, they were to stand pretty near the side scenes, and a person without was to sing it for them: we, by a similar contrivance, performed the Beggar's Opera, and the manager found me exceedingly useful, as I could cut down a play to any number of characters. Now, there being more characters in this piece, than our small company could fill, I cut out all the whores and rogues but two of each sort, being persuaded, that in these wicked and expensive times, two rogues were enough to corrupt any man, and two whores sufficient to ruin him.  THE week following our new heroine joined us, and never was I more amazed in my life; for who should this young lady be, but Miss Biddy Slash'em, the daughter of Dr. Slash'em of Highgate, where I was first received on my journey toward London. It was on a Saturday evening that she arrived, an evening that we did not perform, and the manager, myself, and two or three of the principals, were regaling over a bowl of punch at a public house. The manager was called out, in order to introduce her, and on her entering the room, the instant she saw me, she flew into my arms with rapture, and the next moment, as in a paroxism of rage, she caught hold of my ears, and shook me, till I was obliged to bawl out for relief; then again, she almost smothered me with caresses, and next burst into a flood of tears. It is natural to conceive, that this inequality of conduct, this conflict of passions, this mixture of love and anger, must have been mysterious to all present but to me. I was conscious I had not treated her well, in omitting to correspond with her, and that for reasons the reader will by-and-by know. However, she soon recovered herself, apologized to the company for her behavior, said, I was the oldest acquaintance she had, and that her transports in seeing me, where she so little expected it, had totally confused her.  DIFFERENCES being adjusted, and matters of ceremony settled, our topics became general, rolled upon the state of the company, the success we had met with, and our plan of operations in future; and toward the close of the evening, the manager conceiving, as old acquaintance, we might wish to be left, together; when the bowl was out, he proposed retiring, and left us to ourselves.  WE were no sooner alone, but she burst into tears again, upbraided me with my cruel conduct, declared how much she loved me, and said she had suffered greatly on my account. I begged she would suspend her opinion of my conduct, till she had heard my story, which I would relate to her the first opportunity; but that is was too long, and too interesting, to enter into, at so late an hour in the evening. I asked her, if she was provided with a lodging, she replied, she was, and hoped I would breakfast with her in the morning; which having promised to do, I conducted her home, and lift her.
