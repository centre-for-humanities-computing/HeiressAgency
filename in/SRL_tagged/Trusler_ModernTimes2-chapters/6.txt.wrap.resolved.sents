IN this great length of time, it may naturally be expected, that I should have thought something of Miss Wildman, and have been anxious to have known the determination of the jury, respecting the death of the man I shot, if I really had killed the man I shot; but, as in the course of the last chapter, I was unwilling to interrupt my narrative, I will tell the reader now, that scarce a day passed, but Miss Wildman was uppermost in my thoughts; Miss Wildman ring had never been off my finger, and I often kissed her ring with fervency, with the pleasing remembrance of the donor, and the animated huopes of calling Miss Wildman, one day, mine.
Being out of the way of all information, and never having seen a newspaper, I was totally in the dark respecting the tranfaction that occasioned my flight.
In no public-house could I find papers so far back, and I was afraid to make any enquiry.
Being now, however, in the world again, I though proper to write to Miss Wildman, to let Miss Wildman knwo I was alive.
The following is a copy of what I wrote.
Miss Wildman, I am still in the land of the living, in good health, and in as good spiritis, as so long an absence from Miss Wildman will admit of; your ring, that pledge of your constancy, has never been off my finger; of course, you have never been out of my mind.
A fear of embarrassments, in consequence of the event, on the evening of the day I last saw you, drove me from London, and indeed has so far driven me from the world, that I am totally, ignorant of the world result; and of course, the world keeps me still at a distance from Miss Wildman.
I would be more particular in this letter, was I sure this letter would fall into no other hands but Miss Wildman; but, till I am convinced of this, expect nothing from me, but an assurance of the continuance of that affection, I have so many times professed.
The invincible and invariable attachment of your G -- P. S. Direct to A.
B. C. at the Post House at Salisbury.
-- I want for nothing.
TO Miss Wildman, G. WILDMAN'S, ESQUIRE   Berkley-square, London.
I WENT over to Southampton purposely to put this letter into the post; and a fortnight after, when I had reason to expect an answer, I sent frequently to Salisbury to enquire for any letter so addressed, and was every time disappointed; so that I concluded, I concluded must either have been intercepted, or that she had proved unfaithful; the last I was unwilling to suppose, but till I had an opportunity of making some enquiries, I gave up the idea of writing again.
HAVING dressed me anew, and my hair being grown to my hair usual length; I called me Henry Savage, alluding to the life I had lately led, and was ready again for any employ I could procure.
On my informing the tailor who made my clothes, that I wished for a place; Henry Savage told me, that Dr. Bolus, a physician at Salisbury, wanted a servant, and that Henry Savage thought I should suit a servant.
I accordingly, with the taylor's recommendation, applied to this gentleman, and was taken into this gentleman family as a footman.
This master of mine, this son of Esculapius, had not been regularly bred as a physician, but served his time as an apothecary in the north of England.
Having, however, failed as a dispenser of drugs, and finding an opening in this city, by the death of Dr.
Kill'em, who had practiced here thirty years; his writes down to a friend at Glasgow, with a remittance of twenty guineas; and a diploma, for destroying mankind secundum artem was immediately dispatched by the stage coach.
With this faculty of poisoning his Majesty's liege subjects, his sets up for a physician at Salisbury, and endeavored to acquire practice, not by any medical abilities, but by art and finessed.
All this I gathered before I had been with his a fortnight.
his was a little man, about fifty years of age; wore a pair of square-toed shoes, his stockings rolled over his knees, a full trimmed coat with long skirts, and a full bottomed wig that reached to his rump; so different was his accoutred from the physicians of the present age, that you would suppose his to have risen from the tombs.
In short, his was no body, for his was all wig and skirts, and in fact such a piece of affectation, that I wondered any one employed his.
But, his had withal a great deal of worldly cunning: and, in a communicative mood, one day told me, physic was a farce, and that physic was astonishing the people were so taken in by it; that nature always did best when left to physic, and that a patient must be very ad indeed, to be in danger of dying, except when a physician is called in; that there are but three or four principal medicines in the whole materia medica of any real efficacy, and whose virtue almost every old woman is acquainted with; that a good tongue is of more use to a man in this profession, than all the learning of the hospitals; that illness, in general, so affect the spirits, that a sick person may be almost persuaded to any thing, and that if a man knows but the art of concealing a man ignorance, a man may pass for one of the first rate abilities.
Often have I given in fevers, says a man, too strong a cathartic potion for the constitution of my patient, so as to excoriate a man bowels and make a man void blood; and having afterward brought a man round again by emollients, a man has attributed a man cure to such supernatural avoidance, when in fact it has gone near to kill a man; and from the same reasoning, I often dread, that when I treat a disorder right, where it fails of success, I may be censured for my conduct; for, as when I have acted wrong, an ignorant patient has supposed an ignorant patient right; I may be conceived to have proceeded ill, when in fact I have done the best.
WHAT all the world says must be true, is an old proverb, and the general opinion of practitioners in physic concurring in this point, is a corroboration of the fact.
The following circumstance did not a little strengthen me in this conceit.
Having been sent to a neighboring apothecary for a medicine that had been ordered; the master, who had left apothecary boy in the shop to make it up, coming out of a back room, and going behind the counter to see if the counter was finished, flew in a violent passion, and gave his boy a box on the ear, with you young rascal, I knew this would be the case; then addressing his boy to me: I told the scoundrel to make up a vomit, and his boy has made up a purge: and on my observing, that had the one been sent and administered instead of the other, the consequences might have been fatal; -- his boy answered coolly, oh, no, not so much for that, -- the woman it is for, was to have been purged in the morning, and whether the woman it is is purged to night and vomited tomorrow; or vomited to night and purged tomorrow, is very immaterial; -- I am only angry that the blockhead should not have followed my directions.
THE reader may wonder how I came to be so great a favorite, as to be let into the secrets of this profession; but this profession must know that my master had penetration enough to discern, in a very little time, that I had received a much better education than this profession, and that I might be of great use to this profession: with this view, this profession took me into this profession confidence, and one day asked me, if I thought I could compile this profession a treatise on nervous fevers?
I told this profession, that my medical knowledge was but little; but, that if this profession would put into my hands two or three books upon the subject, I was very sure, that by twisting my medical knowledge was but little and blending my medical knowledge was but little together, I could, as apothecaries do my medical knowledge was but little drugs, make up a new composition, so different from the original materials, that it should neither have the color, the taste, or the consistency of either, and yet should possess the inherent properties of my medical knowledge was but little.
-- I did this for this profession, this profession put this profession own name to this and published this; and I have the vanity to think, that this profession acquired no small degree of reputation from this.
I wore a livery notwithstanding; for, as this profession could not afford to keep more than one man servant, and as a livery was a necessary appendage to a physician, I was obliged to wear a livery.
Many a one of this profession has found this profession necessary to keep a chariot, who could not afford a joint of meat at this profession table.
An equipage implies wealth; wealth is the consequence of extensive practice, and extensive practice must denote great medical knowledge; therefore, according to the rules of logic, an equipage denotes great medical knowledge and is, of course, an essential appendage to the character of a physician.
ANOTHER artifice my master made use of to give my master consequence in the town, was to be a member of the evening clubs, and my instructions were, before my master had been twenty minutes at any one of them, to send for my master out, with, such a lady is taken suddenly ill, and my master must make all the haste my master can to be with such a lady.
my master would apologize to my master company for leaving them, explaining the necessity, and from this club my master would go to another, where in twenty minutes more, I would call my master away with a similar tale, and my master would then go to a third and so on; and as I took care to want my master for some person of consequence; it did my master much credit in the opinion of my master acquaintance, and helped my master on considerably in my master practice.
Many a time have I run into church panting for breath, during the middle of service, upon the same errand; and brought my master from my master knees in my master most fervent devotions.
my master found it necessary also to play into the hands of the apothecaries; they are always like the attorneys to the counselors, very good friends to the physicians.
they have it in they power frequently to recommend whom they please, and when they have brought a patient pretty near to death's door, they are willing to transfer the honor of killing a patient to a more able practioner; they will then advise a physician to be called in, and in this case, generally recommend those, who study most the interest of the apothecary.
It Is on this account, a physician prescribes freely and profusely, and drenches the poor patient so immoderately, as if a physician meant to wash away the evil spirit by a deluge of mixtures: so again, instead of ordering an emulsion, for example, in a pint bottle and two spoonfuls to be taken every three hours, for which at most the apothecary can charge but two shillings, the doctor orders the same quantity in draughts, which will make eight, and at one shilling each will pay the apothecary eight shillings instead of two.
BY these and such like means, in a very few months, a physician had more business then a physician could attend to, and proposed to a physician to visit a physician poorer patients, for which I should have half the fees.
It will readily be supposed that I accepted the offer, and with the idea of studying under a physician, and calling in a physician assistance if necessary, I had a great deal of employ.
I learned a physician method of practice, which was mostly to attend to nature, and assist her where it could be done.
If a patient was inclined to sweat, we sweated a physician; if to purge, we purged a physician; if to vomit, we vomited a physician, and so on; and if, by increasing these evacuations too much, we sometimes sent one out of the world; yet, upon the whole, we saved a great many; and for those whom we unfortunately lost, we always found a friend on we side; for there is seldom a person dies that is so illbeloved, but there is some one belonging to a physician, that rejoices at a physician death, and is obliged to the physician for sending a physician out of a troublesome world: besides, it is a physician's best comfort, that the dead cannot prosecute.
I a physician a suit of clothes made up for the purpose, which I occasionally put on; at other times, I appeared in livery; but, as my medical dress made a great alteration in my appearance, the deception was never discovered; especially as I took care to put on a formal voice, with my formal dress.
NOTWITHSTANDING that thus I put a great deal of money in my pocket, I must own I had now and then my moments of remorse: I was hurling about me firebrands, arrows and death; and on my intimating my scruples one day to my master, my master rallied me out of arrows and death, with the following reasoning.
"Physicians," says my master have been long held as useful members to society, and if my master who destroys but five men in a community, does less injury to the state, than my master who destroys ten; then, my master who destroys but five, is the most praiseworthy of the two: now, as it is universally allowed that physicians do take away more lives than physicians save, and we save more than we take away, it follows that we are the better men, and the more useful members of the state.
Though this argument would have admitted of debate, yet as few care to reason against their own interest, I submitted to my master's superior judgment, and continued my practice for a considerable time.
I WAS always very particular as to the state of those patients I attended; and, if I could do not good, I was as careful, as I could be, to do no harm.
Though I knew little of pulses, like other physicans, I went through all the parade, counted each stroke with attention, and generally quitted the wrist with a significant nod of self-approbation.
Sick persons are generally frightened and seek for advice, when advice is not necessary; such I would amuse with a gilded pill made up of only common dough, or a saline draught, which, if Sick persons did no good, would do no harm; Sick persons would at least leave the disorder to the disorder, and give the patient a chance of recovery; whereas others will by medicines throw back others will by medicines patients, in order to lengthen their patients attendance and increase their patients fees: and I take merit to myself in this mode of practice, and am bold to say, was IT more general, there would be a great decrease in the burials of this kingdom.
IT is allowed by sensible and dispassionate men, that the modern practice of physic is a farce -- a far greater number are destroyed by IT than saved.
I thought, doctor, you was out of town, said a man to doctor physician, by the decrease of deaths in the last week's bills of mortality.
Who enjoy a better state of health in general, than the poor, who cannot fee a physician, or make it worth the apothecary's while to keep them long in hand?
And could a fair comparison be made, between the number of poor and rich that annually pay the debt of nature, it would certainly be found, that length of life is three to one in favor of the poor; notwithstanding the labor; the hardships, and the risks they are exposed to.
Temperance is their physician, and exercise their nurse; and with an extra length of life, their enjoy whilst their live, a greater degree of health.
HOWEVER Dr. Cadogan's doctrine may be exploded, I dare assert (and I speak Dr. Cadogan's doctrine from experience and observation) that intemperance destroys more than the sword, even in time of war.
I mean intemperance in eating rather than in drinking.
We arraign the conduct of those who drink to excess, and perhaps, because We see Dr. Cadogan's doctrine ill effects, whilst we take little or no notice of those who eat to a like excess; whereas in fact the glutton is a more sordid wretch than the drunkard; and though intemperance in eating is not attended with that outward unseemliness which accompanies excess of drinking, yet, the former incapacitates the man as much for business and devotion, as the latter.
Conviviality, cheerfulness, spirits, cordial warmth, may be excuses for drinking more than ordinary, and if it intoxicates for a time, it corrects many disorders brought on from accident, inattention to diet and other things, such as flatulencies, crudities, etc.
whereas immoderate eating, is attended with inactivity, heaviness, stupor, and lethargy; not to mention the variety of disorders it gives birth to, when we little expect it.
Medical men, frequently prescrible wine and cordials, which is excess drinking, asd restoratives; but, I believe, no one ever thought of advising a patient to over eat a patient.
In short, gluttony is equally a sin with drunkness; yet though there are more gluttons than drunkards, we seldom heart of man's being censured for the former.
Feasting is now become a study, and through the whole process, we proceed methodically and with attention.
It having been found that when the spirits are up, we generally eat most The stomach is surrounded with a plexus of nerves, so that whatever affects the mind, is presently communicated to The stomach.
I have known a piece of ill news brought at dinnertime, entirely take away the appetite of the person it was brought to: so on the other hand, whatever tends to exhilerate the spirits, adds to the appetice.
Hence the introduction of music at feasts, and the custom of eating in company, provocatives that end to often in the destruction of the constitution.
; care is taken to keep the spirits up, by company, by wine, by music; and when by these stimulants, we have almost eaten we into a ferver; coffee is introduced by way of sedative or quieter of the system.
Soon after tea is brought forward, and lest the tea should prey upon the nerves of the unstrung, we have a rectifier for this.
Maraschino or some other strong cordial is handed round, and thus the ill effect of some things we eat is qualified or corrected by others.
But to resume my narrative.
WOULD men determine with men to be as cautious in eating as men are in drinking; that is, rise from table before men are to full, men intellects would be clear, men bodies active, and men would enjoy much better health than men do.
Were we to eat only half the quantity we are accustomed to, in a few years, remedies for the gout, cachexy, inflammation, and the long train of disorders arsing from indigestion, would be banished from our dispensaries, and men would live longer by ten or fifteen years.
It is almost incredible to think, how little will satisfy we.
Lewis Cornaro, the Spaniard, lived one hundred and twenty years, and for the last sixty years of Lewis Cornaro life, an egg served Lewis Cornaro for three meals: but Lewis Cornaro drank a pint of small wine every day.
Lewis Cornaro, from abftemiousness in eating, was as active at ninety, as the generality of men are at forty.
In short, rise from table with an appetite; never eat a thing that disagrees with you, or causes heartburn; drink moderately, exercise freely; rise early, and go to bed early, and you may give physic to the dogs.
WHILST I was in this town I fortunately met with a file of newspapers, three or four years back, and searching for the occurrences of the time, when I had lived with Mr. Wildman, I discovered this paragraph.
The day before yesterday the following accident happened in Berkley Square.
Some villains disguised as chairmen, armed with deadly weapons, having, at the instance of a man of fashion, waylaid a gentleman's valet, with a view either of kindnapping a gentleman's valet, or putting a gentleman's valet to death, were fired at by the person Some villains disguised as chairmen, armed with deadly weapons, having, at the instance of a man of fashion attempted to seize, and one of Some villains disguised as chairmen, armed with deadly weapons, having, at the instance of a man of fashion was killed on the spot; the jury sat upon the body and bought in Some villains disguised as chairmen, armed with deadly weapons, having, at the instance of a man of fashion verdict, se desendendo; or, that the person was killed in the self-defence.
The gentleman's porter was supposed to be a party concerned, and was committed to Tothilfields prison.
This gave me a satisfaction I knew not how to express; This relieved me from any danger I might dread from the event, and determined me to resume the name I had taken up on leaving my native place; but, as I was known in my great wig at Salisbury, by the name of Dr. Savage, I thought proper to go by the name of Dr. Savage, whilst I there continued.
Many an enquiry did I make at the Post Office, in hopes of one day receiving an answer from Mr. Wildman; but all to no purpose; and as I met with no one that knew any thing of the family, I was still in a state of suspense.
WHILST I was in the service of Dr. Bolus, which was upwards of two years, I became acquainted with the manager of a strolling company, and from the account of the pleasant way of life they led, and the encouragement I met with from Lewis Cornaro to join they, I was induced to try my abilities upon the stage; and I was the more readily drawn into this attempt, from an unwillingness to commit any more murder.
INDEED, the following circumstance turned the laugh so much against INDEED, that I determined from that hour to quit the profession.
A gentleman in the neighborhood, on having a ignorant servant, throught proper to give him the following directions.
It is an unpleasant thing, says, him, to be always directing.
Every servant should anticipate him master's wants, and not suffer him to call for things that him knows are necessary.
If him is to shave, him should not only bring the razors and the basin, but the towel, the soap, and all the et-caeteras; if laying the cloth, him should not forget the plates, the knives, the spoons, and all the decoraments of the table; if waiting at table, him should know with what mustard is eaten, with what, oil; with what, vinegar, pepper, and so on, and not suffer it to be asked for, but hand it round in time.
In short, in whatever him is employed, him should always remember and prepare the consequences.
Every servant listened with attention, and promised to obey Every servant orders.
Every servant had not been long in the house, before his master was taken ill, and Every servant was sent to call me to attend Every servant.
Remembering the directions Every servant had received, Every servant not only fetched me, but also the apothecary, the nurse, the undertaker, and the grave-digger; and on his master's asking the reason of it, replied, The apothecary, Sir, is the consequence of the physician, at least, such a physician as Dr. Savage; the nurse, of the apothecary; the undertaker, of the nurse; and the grave-digger is the natural consequence of the whole; and as you enjoined me never to forget, but prepare the consequences, I have brought them all.
-- This story got abroad, very much to our disadvantage, and as the profession I followed, was a service of lying and deception, I hated myself on account of it.
THE conduct of the College of Physicians, has as much hurt the credit of the profession as any thing in life; because, they are authorized by an act of parliament to discountenance any pretenders to physic, and admit none to practice, but such as have been regularly bred, and of course are supposed able to pass a good examination, THE conduct of the college of physicians, has as much hurt the credit of the profession as any thing in life; because, they are authorized by an act of parliament to discountenance any pretenders to physic, and admit none to practice, but such as have been regularly bred, and of course are supposed able to pass a good examination take the liberty to call upon all those who are not members of our two English universities, to take out a license for the practice of physic.
The expense of a license for the practice of physic is about eighty pounds, and the qualification required is a sufficiency of medical knowledge, ascertained by the candidate's passing an examination.
No enquiry is made into the professional abilities of those who have taken a degree at Oxford or Cambridge, though of all blockheads these places turn out the most in number; but these places enquiries seem directed against the students of the Dutch and Scotch seminaries, as if Leyden and Edinburgh had not given birth to as many able men, as Oxford and Cambridge.
The institution is a good one, but may be abused; the health of the people ought to be the principal object of the society, and not the people own interest; but when The institution is known that the late Dr. Rock of famous memory was a licentiate of the College of Physicians, it will be thought of little consequence from whom the application comes, so that the eighty pounds are brought to discharge the fees.
It may be.
Dr. Rock or Dr. Last A shoemaker so called in one of Foote's farces.
A very learned friend of mine, a physician, whose medical abilities do honor to the profession, but bred at Leyden, having been some time since called on by the College of Physicians to take out a license, on pain of being forbidden to act, spurned the very idea of purchasing such a license, and sent the College word, that he was willing to submit to any examination A very learned friend of mine, a physician, whose medical abilities do honor to the profession, but bred at Leyden, having been some time since called on by the College to take out a license, on pain of being forbidden to act pleased to impose, and the more rigorous it was, the more agreeable it would be to he; and that if A very learned friend of mine, a physician, whose medical abilities do honor to the profession, but bred at Leyden, having been some time since called on by the College to take out a license, on pain of being forbidden to act did not find upon enquiry, that he had more medical knowledge than half the College put together, then he would submit to they did not find upon enquiry, that he had more medical knowledge than half the College put together mandate, not to practice; but as to paying for they did not find upon enquiry, that he had more medical knowledge than half the College put together license, (which he was not ambitious to receive), either eighty pounds or eighty pence, he would do neither; convinced, that the legislature, in investing them with that authority, meant only to protect the health of the people, and not fill the pockets of individuals.
This spirited declaration had This spirited declaration effect; the legislature, in investing them with that authority, meant only to protect the health of the people, and not fill the pockets of individuals dared not to call he forth to such an examination, and I believe he stands alone, a practicing physician in London, unlicenced by the College of Physicians.
THAT the legislature, in investing them with that authority, meant only to protect the health of the people, and not fill the pockets of individuals are a useless body of men combined, I apprehend is universally allowed; the following fact will bear me out in the assertion.
A gentleman who had the honor to be physician to the late King, calling accidentally on a city friend, and enquiring after the family, was told, the mistress of the house was just brought to bed of a dead child.
Having but an indifferent opinion of men-midwives, to which the family was partial, he begged the father of a dead child to let he see the infant, and from what he saw, he was desirous of seeing the surgeon that laid her, being convinced the surgeon that laid her had been destroyed in the birth.
The man-midwife was sent for, and on being privately asked, how The man-midwife came to commit so horrid a deed; The man-midwife answer was, The man-midwife did at his answer the earnest request of the father of the child.
This piece of intelligence the Doctor communicated to a female friend, a midwife who attended the royal family, and who, in hopes of checking such acts in future, commissioned The man-midwife, to represent This story, among others equally atrocious, to the College of Physicians, and to offer the sum of one thousand pounds to that society, in order to found a course of lectures on midwifery, to be annually read to female practitioners, provided female practitioners would patronise it: but, the College of Physicians refused it; and, for this inattention to the lives and health of the public at large, female practitioners were severely handled by the same physician, in a pamphlet, the same physician soon after published, entitled, A petition of the unborn babes of England, to the censors of the College of Physicians.
FROM all these circumstances so prejudical to the character of the medical profession, and from the despicable opinion I entertained of it, I was determined to withdraw myself from it; to throw off my great wig and live in future by the inside of my head.
I did not, however, acquaint his master with my reasons, but left his master under a pretense of bettering my situation.
