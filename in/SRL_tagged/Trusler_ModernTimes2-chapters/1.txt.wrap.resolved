MISS Wildman having opened MISS Wildman so much to MISS Wildman maid respecting me, and which, MISS Wildman conceiving could said only with a view of my hearing it again, I took an opportunity one morning, when MISS Wildman came into Charlotte's room, to request MISS Wildman private ear for five minutes. With great and amiable goodnature, MISS Wildman sent her maid into MISS Wildman room to adjust MISS Wildman toilet, when I addressed MISS Wildman in the following manner. If it be not an act of the highest presumption, Madam, for one in my humble station in life, to declare an attachment to a young lady of your rank and fortune; if it be not an offense against propriety and duty, to solicit your attention to any tale of mine; I would venture to represent to you, that thought you see me here as your father's valet, I am a gentleman both by birth and education, and am not a great way removed from a very considerable landed property. There is an estate of four thousand pounds a year, in the family, and my hopes of one day inheriting it, are not wild and romantic. I mention this only to induce your favorable hearing. -- Mr. Gabriel, said -- Mr. Gabriel, interrupting me, from the time I first saw you, I was convinced, that, though wearing a livery, you had been bred to better expectations; -- but as you have been the preserver of my honor, and have risked your life in my defense, whether servant or master, you are equally entitled to my regard and gratitude. -- Talk not of gratitude! my dear Miss Wildman, exclaimed I; for my dear Miss Wildman sweet condescension gave me greater confidence, talk not of gratitude; what I did, was a duty due from my sex to yours, and if it merits your simple thanks, I am over-paid. My humble character in life will not suffer me to make advances, but should fortune, at any future period, put us nearer on an equality, may I hope for something more than your regard? -- I am of too selfish a nature, returns my dear Miss Wildman, not to acknowledge, that were I mistress of worlds, you have deserved them all. I have a heart, it is true, to give again, but what is my poor heart without my hand? That is at my father's disposal; was my father's disposal at my command, I would enter further into the subject. A thousand blessings on you, my dear Miss Wildman, for this generous declaration, cried I in rapture, taking Wildman hand, which Wildman readily gave me, let me extort but one declaration more, and, poor as I am, I shall be the happiest of men. Your good sense, Mr. Gabriel, returned Wildman, will, I am persuaded, prevent your urging me to say any thing I ought not to say: what I am mistress of, you may command; what I have not to give, you cannot expect. I have too high a veneration for you, my dear Miss Wildman, replied I, still holding Wildman by the hand, to urge the least impropriety: you have frankly confessed your heart is still at liberty, but the hand; I ask not the hand at present, but solicit only your heart, and that you will give me a chance, by time, of possessing the former; at least, that you will promise me not to bestow the one, where you cannot yield the other. This Wildman solemnly promised; "Wildman heart," Wildman said, I had won, and it was Wildman; Wildman had only to lament that Wildman could not give Wildman hand as readily. Charlotte that instant entering the room, Wildman left me, but said Wildman would take the first opportunity of seeing me again  Wildman kept Wildman word the next morning, and brought me an enamelled ring, of no great value in deed, otherwise than as a proof of having re-considered the matter, and thus ratifying Wildman determination. "Take, my dear Gabriel," says Wildman, this ring, as a pledge of my sincerity, that while you are living, as I have thought proper to present you my heart, no man else shall have my hand. -- I take it, my dear Miss Wildman, returned I, pressing it with her hand to my lips, as the best gift below, Heaven has to give; and if I prove unworthy of the best gift below, may I never know bliss hereafter. I call you the most generous of women, as the difference of my situation in life from yours, puts me at too great a distance to have any expectations. Situation, my dear Gabriel, replied Wildman, is an idle term. On the footing of nature, we are all equal, and if there are any circumstances in the eye of the world, that raise one person above another, or distinguish individuals, it is a greater share of moral virtue, or of mental or corporal endowments, given we by Providence and improved by art. You have to boast of these, and of course, are far before half the gentlemen I have the honor to know. In alliances for life, to secure a competency, without which happiness is merely ideal, it may be necessary to consult interest and pay some regard to fortune; but where there is sufficient property on one side to ensure that competency, to look for sufficient property on one side to ensure that competency on the other, is mercenary and covetous. My father is able to give me a fortune, adequate to my utmost wishes; and whenever the time shall come, that I am in possession of that, or you be in a situation not to want it, you shall command my hand, as you do now my heart.  THUS, in an endearing enjoyment of a reciprocity of affection, through the confidence of Charlotte, and the convenience of her room, did many days glide smoothly on. But after I had been in the family about six weeks; with a kind of terror in her countenance, her brought me the following letter, which her had received from Lord B.  Thou most cruel of women, I have been long at loss to account for your indifference, but the cause I am now acquainted with, that of having a rival among your father's servants. I have too much pride to acquaint her with the fact, but I shall watch the scoundrel's motions and remove her from you."  Your injured B --.   I SMILED at the threat and requested her to make her easy under the threat, for as fear was no part of my composition, I should be always upon my guard; but, if at any time, I was betrayed, by any of my fellow servants, and prevented a night from sleeping at home, her should hear immediately from me. her assured me, her alarm was not very great upon the occasion, as her conceived the letter to be a menace only; her greatest unhappiness was, that if any information had been given to him, through a suspicion of the servants, it might reach her father's ears, through the same channel, and occasion a great deal of unhappiness; for though no man was more warm in no man friendships, no one was more violent in no man resentments. Should such a thing take place, I told her, whether I was in the house, or out of the house, her had my consent to disown my consent, and if I was called upon, I would do the same.  her alarm, however, caused me many an unquiet moment. I had too good an opinion of Charlotte to think her would betray me, and I was not conscious my consent was known to any other part of the family. Lord B. might possibly have heard that I was taken into the house, and Lord B. jealousy might lead Lord B. to form a thousand conceptions, and Lord B. might fix on this, in order to mortify Miss Wildman's pride. However, from the tenor of the letter and from what I heard at Mrs. Duplex's, I was determined to be prepared for any violent attack, and therefore never went out afterward, but with a tuck cane and a brace of pistols loaded.  THE third day after Miss Wildman had shown me Lord B's letter, I was going out in the evening about six o'clock, in the month of October, and it was then just at the close of day; I had on a blue surtout-coat with a red cape, and plain hat with gilt button and loop; and scarce had the porter opened the outer door, but I heard a voice say, That Is the porter. At this, I rather drew back, and a man in a chairman's coat, ran up the steps toward me, and, with a tuck in a man in a chairman's coat hand, made an attempt to seize me; I struck a man in a chairman's coat upon the arm with my cane, and with my foot thrust a man in a chairman's coat down off the steps toward me; at that instant I saw two men more making up to me, armed with bludgeons, one had nearly reached me, on which I took out one of my pistols and fired my pistols, and as, I believe, killed a man in a chairman's coat on the spot. I then turned round, in order to take shelter within the house, and found that the porter tried all the porter could to shut the door against the porter; I overpowered the porter, however, with strength, forced my way in, bolted the door against me upon my enemy, and with the but end of my pistol, laid the porter flat upon the floor. All this took place in less time than I have been telling it. Finding me so far safe, I ran backwards toward the stables, pulled off my surtout coat that I might not be known, tore the button and loop from my hat, and made my escape into the Meuse, in which our stables stood. As soon as I found me at liberty, I pushed away to a neighboring stand of coaches, got into one and bid the coachman drive me toward St. Giles's church. When I was out of the reach of any pursuit, I began to consider what was proper to be done. Perfectly convinced from the porter's endeavoring to shut me out, that the porter must be a party concerned, I determined to write to my master, and beg the porter to stand my friend and least a warrant should be issued to apprehend me, to get off, the next morning, to some distance from London. When I was near the end of Oxford Road, I ordered the coachman to set me down, walked on about half a mile, went into a tavern and wrote a letter, of which the following is a copy:  SIR, I WILL not preface a letter, of which the following is a copy:  SIR with a letter, of which the following is a copy:  SIR cause; er'e this, you are too well acquainted with a letter, of which the following is a copy:  SIR, I am safe at present from any fear of danger or of being apprehended. From a declaration of Lord B's at Mrs. Duplex's, since I had the honor of being useful to Miss Wildman, that Wildman would take an opportunity to be revenged of me, and from some other circumstances, I have reason to believe, that Wildman waylaid me at your door; for, on my going out, a fellow, in a chairman's coat, with a tuck in Wildman hand, endeavored to lay hold of Wildman. I beat Wildman arm down with my cane, and with my foot thrust Wildman from the steps toward me; at this instant two more fellows with bludgeons endeavored to lay violent hands on me, the foremost I fired at and possibly may have killed, for I saw Wildman fall. Attempting to return into the house, John, your porter, did all Wildman could to prevent the house, by forcing the door against meme; I succeeded, however, contrary to Wildman wishes, and from a conviction that Wildman must, from such conduct, have been privy to the design against me, I knocked the scoundrel down with my pistol. If the scoundrel lived to rise again, you will probably, by having the scoundrel before a magistrate, come at the bottom of this dark affair; I trust you will do this dark affair, not only in justice to yourself and the world; but to your unfortunate, but respectful humble servant,  GABRIEL OUTCAST. P.S. Part of the fifty pounds you was pleased to give me, is in my trunk in my room, which I beg leave to commit to your disposal, having sufficient money for my present occasions.     I thought of writing to Miss Wildman, according to my promise; but, dropped it, lest my letter should have been intercepted by Miss Wildman ; and as I knew Miss Wildman would be made acquainted with my situation from what I had written to her father. I walked into the Strand with this letter and thence dispatched a chairman with the Strand to Berkley Square. This done, I found my mind at ease, went into a coffee-house, got me some refreshment reconnoitred the depth of my purse, which contained rather better than three guineas, and went out, about ten o'clock, in quest of a lodging; which, in order to elude all search, I determined should be in one of those houses, in the narrow part of St. Giles's, where vagrants are taken in at twopence a night. I soon found out such a lodging, and that my dress might create no suspicion, I turned my surtout coat wrong side outward, loosened the knees of my breeches, slouched my hat, rolled myself in the kennel, and affected to be in liquor. my surtout coat answered all the purposes I wished, and I was shown up to a bed, without sheets, where some poor wretch was already lain and fast sleep. I was no sooner in the room, than the man, who showed me up-stairs, asked me for twopence for my lodging, locked the door against me upon myself, and told me, when I rose and chose to be let out, to ring the bell. He left me no candle, and all the light I had was from a lamp on the staircase, that gave light within the room, by a little window over the door against me. I could not find out by light what kind of a person my bedfellow was, but I examined He clothes, and, by the best conjecture I could make, supposed He to be a laboring man. He breeches were leather, but exceedingly greasy, and neither strings nor buckles at the knees; He waistcoat had been scarlet, but His breeches had but one flap and four buttons, and He was originally what is called a thickset, but out at the elbows; He hat round, but grown brown with age, and He stockings blue worsted, but full of darns; they were, however, tolerably well mended and pretty clean. I tried on the coat and waistcoat and found they fitted me well enough. The reader will perhaps wonder at all this; but, when I tell He my design, He will wonder no longer. My plan was to rise before He waked and change clothes with He, that I might get into the country, in such disguise without fear of interruption. As I was not much disposed for sleep, I surveyed my room, and found the furniture consisted of a broken chair or two, a table with three legs, an old stove in the fireplace, with a shovel and poker chained to the chimney, perhaps, lest a lodger should be pleased to make free with the furniture; and lest we should carry away the blankets was the reason, I presume, of we being locked in. Bad as the bed was, I laid me down upon the bed, but could not get a wink of sleep; therefore, when I heard the watchman cry four, my companion being still snoring, I dressed myself in my companion , except my companion shoes, and instead of four pence half penny and a little tobacco which I found in my companion pocket, I left the poor devil half a crown, and flattered myself my companion would not be unhappy at the change; for though distressed at my own situation, I could not but feel for my companion. I next cut my hair short in the poll, with a knife, I had in his pocket, and pulled a knife over my forehead; and could I have seen myself, I have no doubt but I should have started at my own figure. When completely dressed, I rung the bell, and was let out, the chamberlain turning the key upon the man I had left asleep. The fellow said nothing to The fellow, nor I to The fellow, and I walked off as composed, as if I had nothing to trouble me.  It being rather a cold morning, I walked hastily toward Hyde-Park corner, without any thing about The fellow of value, except, my pistols, my cane, my buckles, my ring, my shirt and my pocket handkerchief, and about three pounds in money. I was presently overtaken by the Exeter coach, and got up into the basket.
