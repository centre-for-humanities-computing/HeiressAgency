OUR captain or ruler being the cleverst and best informed fellow of the whole gang, and having a genteel carriage, I was desirous of knowing OUR captain or ruler history; and one day when the party was upon the scout, and OUR captain or ruler left alone, at my request, OUR captain or ruler gave me the following account of OUR captain or ruler.  Who my mother was, I cannot say, but the person who called OUR captain or ruler my father, was a sheriff's officer, who got pretty snugly into life, by plundering the wretched, and preying upon the oppressed. When I was at an age to remember any thing concerning OUR captain or ruler, OUR captain or ruler had a woman lived with OUR captain or ruler who passed for my mother-in-law; but it is a doubt with OUR captain or ruler, whether every they were married. However, be that as it may, they lived together as man and wife. The common public room of our house, was a miserable dungeon, under ground, calculated to convey an idea of horror, that men who had lived tolerably in the world, and who on an action for debt, were unfortunate enough to fall into OUR captain or ruler hands, might loath the very sight of the place, and be glad to give OUR captain or ruler five shillings a week to be admitted into a better room. our had one upstairs, that would contain twenty perssons, and it was generally full at five shillings a head; this with half a guinea a week, for half a bed, and two shillings and sixpence a day from each, for a wretched breakfast and a worse dinner, put a considerable deal of money into my father's pocket: but this was not the only mode my father had of gaining money. Sheriff's officers give security always for Sheriff's officers trust, so that if Sheriff's officers serve a writ, and let the prisoner go at large, after the prisoner is once arrested, Sheriff's officers are liable to pay the debt: it is on this account they serve a writ, and let the prisoner go at large, after he is once arrested, they are liable to pay the debt will make fifty excuses rather than serve a writ in the presence of the attorney or the plaintiff; but when there is no prying eye upon they serve a writ, and let the prisoner go at large, after he is once arrested, they are liable to pay the debt conduct, they serve a writ, and let the prisoner go at large, after he is once arrested, they are liable to pay the debt will often, on receiving a present of a guinea or two, suffer they serve a writ, and let the prisoner go at large, after he is once arrested, they are liable to pay the debt prisoners to go and look for they serve a writ, and let the prisoner go at large, after he is once arrested, they are liable to pay the debt bail themselves; and should they serve a writ, and let the prisoner go at large, after he is once arrested, they are liable to pay the debt, when at liberty, not keep they serve a writ, and let the prisoner go at large, after he is once arrested, they are liable to pay the debt word, and attend the officer at the time appointed, the officer will tell the paintiff or the officer attorney, that the officer never was able to meet with the defendant. In this school, the receptacle of a variety of wretchedness, was I brought up till I was nineteen years old, and if I was born with any natural feelings, any natural feelings were here quite eradicated. I was taught to load an unhappy wretch with additional misery, and rob an unhappy wretch of every little degree of comfort an unhappy wretch might possess, in order to make an unhappy wretch pine for relief, which relief was never afforded but at an exorbitant price. We had a license for selling wine; but wine was so poor and so sour, that wine required something stronger always to qualify wine; and, if a prisoner wished to send out for brandy or strong beer, We always exacted as much for fetching wine, as the liquor was worth. I should have continued with my father, my father designing me to be one of my father followers, but my mother-in-law led me such a weary life, that one day when my father was out, I opened my father bureau, made free with about twenty pounds of my father ill-gotten wealth, and decamped; and of course, never durst see my father face again.  I HAD sense enough, with about twenty pounds of his ill-gotten wealth to equip myself with necessary clothes, and by an application to a register-office, got me a place; a character for which, cost me no less than a guinea. As a Sheriff's officer has always bail at hand, to give security to an action, at a price proportionable to the debt the prisoner is arrested for, so these keepers of register-offices, have always a housekeeper or two ready to give a character to those who want one, and are enabled to purchase it. The price of a written character is a crown; that of a verbal one, by one of these friends, a guinea. It was a guinea, however, well laid out, and I did not grudge It. It procured me a place at a tea-dealer's in Bond-street, to open and shut up shop, carray out parcels, and do other things. My master, from dealing with women of fashion, had acquired a smoothness of tongue sufficient to deceive the devil, and My master found the devil of great use to My master. If any woman came to My master shop in a coach, or on foot with a servant behind any woman, whether titled or not, any woman was always a lady, and during any woman stay, the word ladyship was seldom out of My master mouth. My master would stand all day dressed at My master shop door, when My master had no customers within, and bow to every carriage that passed; and whilst My master was at dinner, My master expected me to be dressed, and to bow for My master. Why didn't you bow to that coach, said My master to me, one day warmly? I told My master it was empty, -- what is that to the purpose you blockhead, returns My master? Always bow to a coronet full or empty. And My master profited by this plan; for My master had a world of business, and was supposed to be a monied man. I was in his shop one day, when a lady accustomed to drink twenty shilling tea, came in and asked to see some of a lady best Hyson. a lady showed a lady a cannister at eighteen shillings a pound. a lady took eighteen shillings a pound to the light, smelt eighteen shillings a pound, tasted eighteen shillings a pound, rubbed eighteen shillings a pound in the palm of a lady hand, smelt eighteen shillings a pound again, and enquired if a lady had no better; a lady assured her Ladyship, there was no better to be bounght, and perhaps a lady spoke the truth; for all tea-dealers mix all tea-dealers teas, as wine merchants adulterate wine merchants wine and spirits. wine merchants make Hyson of all prices, from ten shillings to eighteen, by mixing ten shillings with what is called Bloom, or common green; then again wine merchants dye ten shillings and scent ten shillings; a few drops of Bergamot, etc. thrown into a pound of Souchong, is sold for Cowslip, or a tea of a superior nature; and as I generally had a hand in these adulterations, I can take upon me to say, I believe the tea my master showed this lady, was as genuine as any this lady could have met with. But, it would not do; Better, says this lady, Mr. Congo, is certainly to be bought, for I drink better every day, though it is true I give more money for it. If you have no better, I am sorry for the trouble I have given you. On this lady leaving the shop, my master replied, if your ladyship does not object to price, I have a peculiar kind at thirty-six shillings a pound, which I defy the whole town to equal. Thirty-six shillings! exclaimed this lady, returning, I never heard of such a price, -- it must be a curiosity! -- Pray let me see it. my master then reached down another cannister of the same tea, and this lady, examining it with some attention, cries, this to be sure is considerably better; but the price amazes me. -- Why did not you show me this at first? Weigh me out two pounds, and if I like it, I will send for more. Thus did this lady pay thirty-six shillings a pound for tea, which this lady might have had for eighteen. But it is the way with these ladies; not knowing the value or price of commodities, these ladies are taken in by almost every tradesman these ladies deal with. So that with all the parade of prying, looking over, examining, enquiring, cheapening, and so on, these ladies will give fifty per cent more than other people. Knowing nothing beyond the line of life they are in, they rate the goodness of every thing by its price, and conceive a lowpriced article to be naught but trash. Goods within their knowledge, their will go far a-foot to purchase. City traders unused to deal with such persons, will not often take advantage of City traders ignorance. City traders will not ask fifteen shillings for a purse at a coach door, which City traders will sell for half the money to a customer on foot. There are some ladies shrewd enough to know this; and yet these, instead of going in some ladies shrewd enough to know this own carriage, will pay four shillings for a hackney coach, to save twopence a yard on a dozen yards of ribband. In a word, they owe all this to they pride, they vanity and parade; they will go a shopping as they call it, morning after morning, tumble over a great variety of goods, give a great deal of trouble, and not buy; and often when they do buy, they will not pay for years. Were persons of fortune to act consistently, they would soon find they account in it; but whilst they go on as they do, they must not be surprised at any thing they meet with.  I TOLD the captain, that I had not only heard that wine-merchants adulterated wine-merchants wines, but absolutely made wine-merchants.  THERE is not the least doubt of it, returns the captain; three fourths of the white wine drank in this kingdom, are compositions put together here, and made palatable by a liquor they call flavor; and as to Port, what is generally drank, is a mixture of malt-spirits, red wine and turnip-juice For the benefit of economical readers, the following are the proportions. Forty-eight gallons of liquor pressed from turnips, eight gallons of malt spirits, and eight gallons of good Port wine, colored with Cochineal and roughened with elder tops. Forty-eight gallons of liquor pressed from turnips, eight gallons of malt spirits, and eight gallons of good Port wine, colored with Cochineal and roughened with elder tops should stand two years in casks, and one in bottles. If rough cider is substituted for turnip-juice, and Coniac-brandy for malt spirits, the wine will be the better. ; -- for the whole kingdom of Portugal could not furnish half the quantity here consumed. But to return, says he, to my story.  I SHOULD have continued with Mr. Congo longer, but I happened one day, to let the cat out of the bag, by telling my master, inadvertently before the exciseman, who happened to be in the shop, that a bag of tea which he had stowed away in the cellar, was burst, and a good deal of the tea shed. For there is not a teadealer in town or country, but what smuggles more or less. They are to conceal no exciseable goods from the inspection of the exciseman, and this idle expression of mine, not only cost he a silencing fee of twenty guineas to steer clear of the Exchequer, but a silencing fee of twenty guineas lost me my place.  I APPLIED again to a register-office, and was next in the service of Mr. Porcelain, a chinaman in St. James's Street. my master, like my last, had little to do but with women of fashion, and gave me an opportunity of seeing a little more of women of fashion folly. my master had originally been a Welsh drover, was a man of low cunning, and where my master picked up my master knowledge in china, I know not, but my master was reckoned, a connoisseur, and became the standard of taste in this branch of trade. Possessed of the most beautiful and valuable collection in town, my master shop was the morning saunter of thoseladies whose fancy took that turn. my master mode of keeping up the most beautiful and valuable collection in town, was by culling the china closets of women of quality in a very artful and designing way. my master plan was to find out what ladies had the most beautiful and valuable collection in town, and whenever ladies came to his shop, my master gave ladies to understand, that my master took china in exchange, and possibly ladies might have a few odd articles, of little value to ladies, but which when assorted with other pieces, which my master might find amongst my master lumber, might be worth something. This generally procured my master access to the closet: besides, there are few collectors of china, but (like collectors of natural curiosities) are fond of displaying collectors of natural curiosities) collections before those who are esteemed virtuosos.  my master was one day in lady Betty Soft's closet, when a pair of old vases of uncommon beauty struck my master. But, my master was silent. Betty Soft's showed my master every thing in turn; and asked my master opinion of it. my master did not fail to praise most things of little value, and depreciate many of intrinsic worth; but declared my master had not seen upon the whole a more valuable collection any where, and that Betty Soft's Ladyship, showed Betty Soft's a woman of uncommon taste. There was nothing, my master said, throughout the closet, that arraigned that taste, but those vulgar vases in the corner, which my master would advise Betty Soft's ladyship to put upon the mantlepiece in Nursery. Nursery, says Betty Soft's, Mr. Porcelain? she, Mr. Porcelain will soon be of no value there, and she, Mr. Porcelain cost me a great deal of money. Then her ladyship was imposed on, returned her ladyship. You had better take she, Mr. Porcelain then, replied lady Betty, with these odd articles we have picked out. she, Mr. Porcelain were of little worth her ladyship said, by she, Mr. Porcelain but along with other things, her ladyship would allow replied lady Betty something for she, Mr. Porcelain. her ladyship accordingly took she, Mr. Porcelain away with her ladyship; and was no sooner gone, than replied lady Betty 's maid was rung for, and made acquainted with the business of the morning. Porcelain, the china-man, says replied lady Betty, has been here, and those vases, which you and others have so much admired, I find are trumpery things. Who told her ladyship so? replies her ladyship's maid. Porcelain himself; returns replied lady Betty, her ladyship's maid declared they were the most paltry things in nature, and a disgrace to my closet; and her ladyship's maid has taken they away. Taken they away! exclaims Bridget, sure, replied lady Betty, you would not suffer yourself to be cheated in that style; her ladyship's maid has under-valued them merely to get them into her ladyship's maid own clutches, and will sell them as great rarities. -- Aye! says replied lady Betty, then send Thomas after Thomas immediately, and let Thomas bring them back. Thomas was instantly dispatched, but Porcelain, on Thomas reaching home ordered me to carry them up to the top of the house; and on being told the man's errand, cried out, how very unfortunate! I had no sooner brought them and set them down upon my counter, but a gentleman, who came in at that instand, asked the price of that ordinary pair of vases, and I have sold them to Thomas for a song. Run, Will, says Thomas, to me, down that street, you may possibly overtake Thomas -- in a scarlet gold-laced waistcoat -- Thomas has not been out of his shop five minutes. I set off as Thomas ordered me -- but the vases were irrecoverable. And three months afterward, with some additional painted ornaments to disguise some additional painted ornaments, some additional painted ornaments added to Thomas stock of china, and were rated as antiques.  ON my smiling at the idea of Thomas painting it a-fresh, Thomas told me, it was a practice with Thomas. Thomas had been known to sell a whole service of white china painted and varnished over, for that which is burnt in, and when a dinner has been served up in a dinner, the steam of the dishes has obliterated the painting, and all the figures have vanished. Thomas used to survey Thomas customers from head to foot, and ask a price according to his customers appearance. What shall I give you, says a lady, one day, to Thomas for that set of white china? It was Chelsea, but as she took It for Dresden, Thomas asked a Dresden price, (twenty guineas) and a Dresden price was purchased. In a few weeks afterward, she friends infomed she a Dresden price was Chelsea. she accordingly flew to Thomas and wondered how Thomas could presume, to sell she that set of Chelsea for Dresden. I never sold it for Dresden, returns Thomas; her ladyship asked me, what I would have for that set of Dresden chinaDresden . I thought you had been a judge of china by your buying a judge of china up so. Had a judge of china been Dresden, a judge of china should not have gone for forty pieces. But, if her ladyship dislikes a judge of china, you are welcome to change a judge of china for any thing else. Disappointed, she looked round and fixed upon a couple of jars worth about ten pounds, which he valued at thirty; but, to make she ladyship amends, he would only take of she five guineas, besides that set of Chelsea china. The bargain was struck, the jars put into the coach, and she ladyship no sooner from the door, than he turned round to me, hugging he in he adroitness, with a 'By G-d, one of the jars is cracked.'  THIS puts me in mind of a story, I have some where met with. A cane-seller in London, sold a gentleman a cane for five guineas, and to a second, the same kind of cane for ten, telling he it was a unique, and there was not such another in this kingdom; these two happiening to meet, and the last upon an examination of the two canes, conceiving he imposed on, went to the person of whom he bought it, and rated he upon the subject; but he had sufficient address to reconcile he customer to the purchase; who implicitly believed what A cane-seller in London told he. It is a great misfortune, Sir, says he, that you are unacquainted with the great value of a cane for five guineas. I have been looking out for you every day, expecting you would have called to have thanked me for letting you into so good a purchase on such easy terms. I have examined the two canes, replied a gentleman, and see no difference. Difference! exclaimed A cane-seller in London, -- all the difference in the world -- the one I sold for five guineas, is merely jam- be; whereas yours is a jam- beau.  SUCH a man was my second master; and you may suppose, that under the roof of two such artful instructors, I must certainly have improved. I learned a good deal before I left home; but acquired a further degree of knowledge under Mr. Congo and Mr. Porcelain. I fell in so much with my master's natural disposition, that my master began to like me; but an accident here also deprived me of my place. Our shop was seldom kept open after five o'clock, so that I had a good deal of time upon my hands; -- some of my evenings I, used to spend at a spouting club in the neighborhood; where, though a very bad speaker, I got such a rage for declamation, that I was always repeating some passages or other, whenever I, had opportunity. When I spent my evenings at home, I used to entertain the maids with my theatrical abilities. One of the maids, Susan, a simple country wench, was mightily taken with my speeches. I have ranted away Hotspur, till Susan has, with Susan mouth open, been as stiff, and as motionless as a statue. But one evening, when I was in spirits, I gave spirits a few passages out of Alexander the Great, and I had worked Susan up to such a pitch, in the scene with Clytus, that when I was to kill Susan, in a paroxism of rage, I kicked down the table, forgetting that my master was overhead. This made such a clatter, that the bell was rung, and, Susan went up, scarce recovered from that frigidity of horror, my murderous tongue at first had thrown Susan into. What Is all that d -- mned racked below? says my master -- Nothing, Sir, says Susan, but Alexander has just killed Clyphus. If Alexander goes on in this way, returns my master, I shall have Alexander in one of Alexander fits, dealing death among china, and do me twenty pounds worth of mischief. -- Upon this I was discharged.  I GAVE Alexander to understand that i was quite entertained with Alexander manner of telling Alexander story, as his story fell in with my notions, that of making remarks on life as I passed along, and begged Alexander to proceed.  Alexander replied, from what Alexander could learn from Alexander acquaintance who were in the service of others, that tradesmen, show tradesmen worst goods and oldest patterns first, particularly silk-mercers, linen and woollen-drapers, haberdashers, and the like; that tradesmen have particular lights in tradesmen shops to give tradesmen a false appearance; that tradesmen pretend to examine the goods narrowly, to make the buyer suppose tradesmen would not deceive Alexander, ask more than the thing is worth to allow for abating, crib a little in the quantity or measure, and then reach tradesmen scales to weight the money tradesmen receive. In short, that there is not a trade or profession but what has a trade or profession mysteries and arts of defrauding; that men open men shops, set out men goods every morning to impose upon their goods customers, and cheerfully shut their customers up again at night, after having cheated all the day, like the woman who after talking all the scandal she can, wipes she and says she has done no harm.  SINCE then, continued he, as whatever is, is right, and these men with whom I had lived were doing so well in the world by a little artifice and finesse, I was unhappy I could not strike out into some way of life myself that would raise me above the situation of a servant. However, thought I, as there is a tide in the fortune of all men, I will wait with patience. Something may turn up unexpectedly.
