THE next morning I waited on Miss Slash'em at her lodgings, and found her neatly and elegantly dressed to receive me; she was grown tall and slender, and had a fire in her eye that I never observed before. I could not help telling her, that I thought she was grown very handsome, and that I was sorry to see her in no better situation than myself, reduced for bread, to join a strolling company of players. She in return told me, that her meeting with me, compensated for the rubs that she had met with, and they were not a few. She reminded me of having promised to recount my story, and I told it as faithfully as I have laid it before my readers, excepting my attachment, with the vows I had made to Miss Wildman, and an untruth or two I was obliged to tell, of having twice written to her an receiving no answer.  WHEN I came to that part of my story, respecting the accident at Mr. Wildman's door, she corroborated the paragraph I had read in the newspapers, and told me she had so far enquired, as to find, that the coroner's inquest had acquitted me, and that the porter, though committed to prison, as I did not appear against him, was discharged at the following sessions.  WHEN I had ended my story, which she observed, for the little time we had been separated, was the fullest of events she had ever heard of, she gave me here is in the following manner.  YOU must remember, my dear fellow, the critical situation you left me in: I concealed it as long as I could; but not hearing from you, and having no friend to apply to, I was under a necessity of discovering it to my mother, and making a friend of her. Hussy, says she, this comes of your hanging about the men. And though she rated me roundly for my misconduct, as I applied to her feelings, as a woman and my mother, she wished, if possible, to keep it secret from my father; but that was impracticable; he had too keen an eye, not to see a visible alteration in my person, and knew too much of the world, as he called it, to be hum-bugg'd. In short, it was known to him, three months before I lay in, and no poor devil, between father and mother, lived a more wretched life; upbraidings without number and all sorts of unkind treatment. In short, your cruel usage, added to theirs, so distressed me, that I was worn to a shadow; and had they not relaxed in their severity, near the time of my lying in, I believe I should have died. Indeed, I so frequently told them so, that they began to believe it: they on this consideration were less severe to me at the last, and I made shift to live through the trying time, having brought into the world a still-born boy. -- There appearing now to be no living witness of my shame, and my father not likely to be at any further expense, after I was recovered, he began to soften his brow, and to reconcile the matter to himself; but never could be brought to look upon me again with that pleasure and satisfaction he had formerly done. In short, the life I then led, determined me to quit it, whenever I had an opportunity, and this opportunity soon offered; for having a strolling company in the village, which I heard were removing, I wrote a note to the manager, who was a single man, and whom I had seen, to this effect.  SIR, A DAMSEL in distress stands in need of protection; she fancies, she has abilities for the stage, or for any thing; if you are inclined to try them, and have spirit enough to bring a ladder and carry her off secretly, you will find her at the one pair of stairs window of the red house, opposite the lamp post, No. 119, on the road to London, on Friday morning next, between three and four o'clock.   FOR, as you know my mother used to take the keys of the outer doors up into her room, I had no other way of escaping. I prepared every thing for my elopement, put up my clothes in a bundle, and on the appointed morning, being just break of day, I stole down to the window; and though I doubted of seeing the person I waited for, I no sooner opened the shutter, than I found my Ranger with a ladder ready, and with all the vivacity and spirit I could wish. He handed me out, and we got clear off. It was a fine morning, and we walked away for Hampstead, where he had provided me a retreat, having thrown the ladder over a hedge by the road side. Here he kept me a week, and lived with me till his company removed to St. Albans and we then followed.  YOUR good sense, my dear Gabriel, will forgive me this rash act. Could I have had your protection, I would have preferred it to that of all the men in the world; but as you had deserted me, and my life was wretched, from a persuasion that it could not be more so, I ventured upon the change. It was a bold enterprise, as I was then scarce nineteen. Mr. Rider, for that was my friend's name, was a tolerable good player, took a great deal of pains with me, and made me capable of earning my living before I had been three months with him; I came out at first, in very trisling parts; but, before we left St. Albans, I had played Juliet, Desdemona, and two or three other capital characters, and acquitted myself so well, that I began to think of standing upon my own bottom.  I HAD not been a great while at St. Albans, before my father found me out, and wrote to me. After condemning my conduct, and some few chidings, on that account, he proceeded to tell me, that if I would quit the way of life I was in, return home, and be useful about the house, that both he and my mother would receive me kindly: -- but I returned him for answer, that I was making great proficiency in the profession I had taken up, and had the vanity to think, that, in a little time, I should be at the top of it. I thanked him for his offer, but I would rather continue as I was; particularly as I could not be more disgraced than I had been, and as his circumstances were not so great, but he could dispense with a useless person about him. After this letter, he left me to myself, and I never was importuned again upon the subject. -- I have written to my mother once or twice since, not to ask any assistance, but merely to enquire after her and my father; but, as I never could obtain an answer, I wrote no more. All I know is, that, on enquiry from a person who was lately in the neighborhood, I find that they are both well, and that his school has very much increased.  I CONTINUED with Mr. Rider, upwards of three quarters of a year, when a circumstance happened that occasioned our separation. Whilst I was at St. Albans, a linen-draper's apprentice, a good-humoured lad, took a liking to me, and was ever behind the scenes, industriously attentive to please me; and as he was a generous youth, though without money, and would frequently present me with a muslin handkerchief or two, half a dozen pocket handkerchiefs, an apron and other necessary articles, I found it my interest to keep in with him. --  NOT enquiring, interrupted I, how he came by them?  NOT I, indeed, continued she, that was no part of my concern: I suppose he paid his master for them. -- They were acceptable to me, and I took them, and, when we removed to Hertford, this young man one Sunday, came over to see me, at a time when Mr. Rider was from home, and not being able toget him away, so soon as I wished, Mr. Rider returned, and entered the room unexpectedly at the moment the poor boy was squeezing my hand in raptures. Mr. Rider grew jealous from this hour, and was seldom after in a good humor. I told him, therefore, frankly, that I would continue no longer with him, but leave him and his company to themselves; I accordingly applied to the manager of the Buckingham theater, and as he wanted a woman in my cast of parts, I immediately joined his company, at a salary of four and twenty shillings a week; and he, being a musical man, taught me to sing; so that I am now a general player. Tragedy, comedy, opera, farce-nothing comes amiss miss to me.  AND have you, say I, continued with them till now?  WITH some little interruption, returned she, I have. I went on pretty smoothly for the first year; when an old quaker at Buckingham, who had more of the sinner in him than the saint, and was reputed to be very rich, invited himself to drink tea which me at my lodgings; I received him and he made me a formal proposal of taking me to live with him, with a Verily friend Slash'em, thou have a leering eye and a bewitching form, that stirs my whole frame: I have been, since I saw thee, in such an eternal figet, that I never shall be again composed, till thou condescendeth to make me happy. I gave him to understand, that, in the profession I was in, I earned a great deal of money; that if he took me out of it, I should be a considerable loser, for that I might find an unwillingness to return, and that, of course, I could not think of changing my situation, unless he would settle fifty pounds a year upon me, which he consented to, and I went home in a few days after to his house; -- you will scarce credit the assertion; but, it is nevertheless true, that quakers, notwithstanding their outward formality and stiffness, are as wanton as boys, and put on their formality only with their clothes. Mr. Broadbrim, the gentleman I lived with, was about sixty years of age, and very much respected among the brotherhood. I was dressed like one of them, and passed for his housekeeper, and might have continued long with him, had not the friends began to smoke him, as they called it, and found out who I was. Truly friend Broadbrim, said an old acquaintance to him one day, and which I overheard from the next room, thy housekeeper savoureth too much of the flesh, and betrayeth an impurity that becomes not thy age and outward sanctity. Ebenezer, said Mr. Broadbrim to him, Let not thy tongue outrun thy discretion. Flesh is sometimes necessary to cheer the spirits and comfort the outward man. I can discover by thy eyes, that thou also have thy wanton moments, and that though thy flesh be weak, thy spirit is willing. -- It was not always he could get off so well; in short, he was so laughed at by the young men, and jeered by the old, that he could not hold up against their ridicule, and having been threatened with an expulsion from the society, which he dreaded more than any thing, he told me, one day, unwilling as he was, he must part with me, but that the fifty pounds a year, I was welcome to keep; and if I did not expose him, he would be a friend to me whilst he lived. I accordingly quitted him and returned to the way of life I was in before; joining the Buckingham company again, at my former salary; but, as my own mistress, with the addition of fifty pounds a year regularly paid every half year. Our manager dying soon after, the company broke up and I am engaged here as you find me.  I TOOK the liberty to ask her some questions respecting the quakers; she replied, that, indeed, she did not know a great deal of them, having never conversed with any one of them till she became acquainted with Mr. Broadbrim; but that he had an universal acquaintance among the fraternity, and they were frequently at his house; that as far as she could judge, they were the greatest dissemblers in life, and that she believed though they professed more candor and more sincerity than the rest of the world, they at the same time had less of it; that she knew it was a custom among them to have false bills of parcels to show to their customers, by which they ascertained their profit to be very small, when, in fact, it was very large, and under a pretense of dealing for discount only, that discount was twenty-five or thirty per cent. I know the Birmingham manufacturers allow a discount of twenty-five per cent. upon their bills, for ready money, and if a retailer gets no more, he gets a great deal too much. But, as my opinion of Miss Slash'em's judgment was but indifferent, I ceased making any further enquiries.  SHE would fian have urged me to live in the same apartment with her; but, I excused myself, under the declaration of being the most inconstant fellow alive, and the most unsettled; that it was uncertain whether I continued in the profession I was in, one month or twelve; but that whilst I did, and that we were within reach of each other, I would see her, when she pleased, and where she pleased; and should always think myself happy when I had it in my power to be of use to her.  IT may appear strange that one upon the town as I was, should decline Biddy Slash'em's proposal, whose purse as well as person would have been at my command; but, the truth is, I hated a settled connection. I will be honest enough to own, that I frequently yielded to the bent of human nature, and if I had occasionally a child or two sworn to me unjustly, I compromised the matter with the parish where it was born on, the best terms I could, which seldom exceeded ten pounds and a treat to the Overseers of the poor. That ten pounds will not bring a child up till it is able to get its living, we all know; but, these guardians of the infant poor, are charitable enough to remove it from a sinful world, as soon as possible. At an entertainment I gave upon one of these occasions, the churchwarden intimated, when half-drunk, that ten pounds was a good price for a bastard child, as wrapping it up a night or two in a wet blanket, seldom failed of sending it to Heaven presently.
