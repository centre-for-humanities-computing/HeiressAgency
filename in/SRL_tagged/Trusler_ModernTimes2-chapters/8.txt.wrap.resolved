THE next morning I waited on Miss Slash'em at Miss Slash'em lodgings, and found Miss Slash'em neatly and elegantly dressed to receive me; Miss Slash'em was grown tall and slender, and had a fire in Miss Slash'em eye that I never observed before. I could not help telling Miss Slash'em, that I thought Miss Slash'em was grown very handsome, and that I was sorry to see Miss Slash'em in no better situation than Miss Slash'em, reduced for bread, to join a strolling company of players. Miss Slash'em in return told me, that Miss Slash'em meeting with Miss Slash'em, compensated for the rubs that Miss Slash'em had met with, and they were not a few. Miss Slash'em reminded me of having promised to recount my story, and I told my story as faithfully as I have laid my story before my readers, excepting my attachment, with the vows I had made to Miss Wildman, and an untruth or two I was obliged to tell, of having twice written to Miss Slash'em an receiving no answer.  WHEN I came to that part of my story, respecting the accident at Mr. Wildman's door, Miss Slash'em corroborated the paragraph I had read in the newspapers, and told me Miss Slash'em had so far enquired, as to find, that the coroner's inquest had acquitted me, and that the porter, though committed to prison, as I did not appear against prison, was discharged at the following sessions.  WHEN I had ended my story, which Miss Slash'em observed, for the little time we had been separated, was the fullest of events Miss Slash'em had ever heard of, Miss Slash'em gave me here is in the following manner.  YOU must remember, my dear fellow, the critical situation you left me in: I concealed it as long as I could; but not hearing from my dear fellow, and having no friend to apply to, I was under a necessity of discovering it to my mother, and making a friend of Miss Slash'em. Hussy, says Miss Slash'em, this comes of your hanging about the men. And though Miss Slash'em rated me roundly for my misconduct, as I applied to Miss Slash'em feelings, as a woman and my mother, Miss Slash'em wished, if possible, to keep it secret from my father; but that was impracticable; my father had too keen an eye, not to see a visible alteration in my person, and knew too much of the world, as my father called it, to be hum-bugg'd. In short, it was known to my father, three months before I lay in, and no poor devil, between father and mother, lived a more wretched life; upbraidings without number and all sorts of unkind treatment. In short, your cruel usage, added to three months before I lay in, and no poor devil, between father and mother, lived a more wretched life; upbraidings without number and all sorts of unkind treatment, so distressed me, that I was worn to a shadow; and had three months before I lay in, and no poor devil, between father and mother, lived a more wretched life; upbraidings without number and all sorts of unkind treatment not relaxed in three months before I lay in, and no poor devil, between father and mother, lived a more wretched life; upbraidings without number and all sorts of unkind treatment severity, near the time of my lying in, I believe I should have died. Indeed, I so frequently told three months before I lay in, and no poor devil, between father and mother, lived a more wretched life; upbraidings without number and all sorts of unkind treatment so, that three months before I lay in, and no poor devil, between father and mother, lived a more wretched life; upbraidings without number and all sorts of unkind treatment began to believe it: three months before I lay in, and no poor devil, between father and mother, lived a more wretched life; upbraidings without number and all sorts of unkind treatment on this consideration were less severe to me at the last, and I made shift to live through the trying time, having brought into the world a still-born boy. -- There appearing now to be no living witness of my shame, and my father not likely to be at any further expense, after I was recovered, my father began to soften my father brow, and to reconcile the matter to my father; but never could be brought to look upon me again with that pleasure and satisfaction my father had formerly done. In short, the life I then led, determined me to quit it, whenever I had an opportunity, and this opportunity soon offered; for having a strolling company in the village, which I heard were removing, I wrote a note to the manager, who was a single man, and whom I had seen, to this effect.  SIR, A DAMSEL in distress stands in need of protection; SIR, A DAMSEL in distress fancies, SIR, A DAMSEL in distress has abilities for the stage, or for any thing; if you are inclined to try you are, and have spirit enough to bring a ladder and carry SIR, A DAMSEL in distress off secretly, you will find SIR, A DAMSEL in distress at the one pair of stairs window of the red house, opposite the lamp post, No. 119, on the road to London, on Friday morning next, between three and four o'clock.   FOR, as you know my mother used to take the keys of the outer doors up into my mother room, I had no other way of escaping. I prepared every thing for my elopement, put up my clothes in a bundle, and on the appointed morning, being just break of day, I stole down to the window; and though I doubted of seeing the person I waited for, I no sooner opened the shutter, than I found my Ranger with a ladder ready, and with all the vivacity and spirit I could wish. the person I waited handed me out, and we got clear off. It was a fine morning, and we walked away for Hampstead, where the person I waited had provided me a retreat, having thrown the ladder over a hedge by the road side. Here the person I waited kept me a week, and lived with me till the person I waited company removed to St. Albans and we then followed.  YOUR good sense, my dear Gabriel, will forgive me this rash act. Could I have had your protection, I would have preferred this rash act to that of all the men in the world; but as you had deserted me, and my life was wretched, from a persuasion that it could not be more so, I ventured upon the change. It was a bold enterprise, as I was then scarce nineteen. Mr. Rider, for that was my friend's name, was a tolerable good player, took a great deal of pains with me, and made me capable of earning my living before I had been three months with Mr. Rider; I came out at first, in very trisling parts; but, before we left St. Albans, I had played Juliet, Desdemona, and two or three other capital characters, and acquitted me so well, that I began to think of standing upon my own bottom.  I HAD not been a great while at St. Albans, before my father found me out, and wrote to me. After condemning my conduct, and some few chidings, on that account, my father proceeded to tell me, that if I would quit the way of life I was in, return home, and be useful about the house, that both my father and my mother would receive me kindly: -- but I returned my father for answer, that I was making great proficiency in the profession I had taken up, and had the vanity to think, that, in a little time, I should be at the top of it. I thanked my father for my father offer, but I would rather continue as I was; particularly as I could not be more disgraced than I had been, and as my father circumstances were not so great, but my father could dispense with a useless person about my father. After this letter, my father left me to me, and I never was importuned again upon the subject. -- I have written to my mother once or twice since, not to ask any assistance, but merely to enquire after my mother and my father; but, as I never could obtain an answer, I wrote no more. All I know is, that, on enquiry from a person who was lately in the neighborhood, I find that they are both well, and that my father school has very much increased.  I CONTINUED with Mr. Rider, upwards of three quarters of a year, when a circumstance happened that occasioned our separation. Whilst I was at St. Albans, a linen-draper's apprentice, a good-humoured lad, took a liking to me, and was ever behind the scenes, industriously attentive to please me; and as my father was a generous youth, though without money, and would frequently present me with a muslin handkerchief or two, half a dozen pocket handkerchiefs, an apron and other necessary articles, I found it my interest to keep in with my father. --  NOT enquiring, interrupted I, how my father came by them?  NOT I, indeed, continued my mother, that was no part of my concern: I suppose my father paid my father master for them. -- them were acceptable to me, and I took them, and, when our removed to Hertford, this young man one Sunday, came over to see me, at a time when Mr. Rider was from home, and not being able toget Mr. Rider away, so soon as I wished, Mr. Rider returned, and entered the room unexpectedly at the moment the poor boy was squeezing my hand in raptures. Mr. Rider grew jealous from this hour, and was seldom after in a good humor. I told Mr. Rider, therefore, frankly, that I would continue no longer with Mr. Rider, but leave Mr. Rider and Mr. Rider company to him and his company; I accordingly applied to the manager of the Buckingham theater, and as Mr. Rider wanted a woman in my cast of parts, I immediately joined his company, at a salary of four and twenty shillings a week; and Mr. Rider, being a musical man, taught me to sing; so that I am now a general player. Tragedy, comedy, opera, farce-nothing comes amiss miss to me.  AND have you, say I, continued with Tragedy, comedy, opera, farce-nothing till now?  WITH some little interruption, returned a woman, I have. I went on pretty smoothly for the first year; when an old quaker at Buckingham, who had more of the sinner in him than the saint, and was reputed to be very rich, invited him to drink tea which me at my lodgings; I received him and him made me a formal proposal of taking me to live with him, with a Verily friend Slash'em, thou have a leering eye and a bewitching form, that stirs my whole frame: I have been, since I saw thee, in such an eternal figet, that I never shall be again composed, till thou condescendeth to make me happy. I gave him to understand, that, in the profession I was in, I earned a great deal of money; that if him took me out of it, I should be a considerable loser, for that I might find an unwillingness to return, and that, of course, I could not think of changing my situation, unless him would settle fifty pounds a year upon me, which him consented to, and I went home in a few days after to him house; -- you will scarce credit the assertion; but, it is nevertheless true, that quakers, notwithstanding their outward formality and stiffness, are as wanton as boys, and put on their formality only with their clothes. Mr. Broadbrim, the gentleman I lived with, was about sixty years of age, and very much respected among the brotherhood. I was dressed like one of the brotherhood, and passed for his housekeeper, and might have continued long with his, had not the friends began to smoke his, as the friends called it, and found out who I was. Truly friend Broadbrim, said an old acquaintance to his one day, and which I overheard from the next room, his housekeeper savoureth too much of the flesh, and betrayeth an impurity that becomes not thy age and outward sanctity. Ebenezer, said Broadbrim to Broadbrim, Let not thy tongue outrun thy discretion. Flesh is sometimes necessary to cheer the spirits and comfort the outward man. I can discover by thy eyes, that thou also have thy wanton moments, and that though thy flesh be weak, thy spirit is willing. -- It was not always thy could get off so well; in short, thy was so laughed at by the young men, and jeered by the old, that thy could not hold up against the young men ridicule, and having been threatened with an expulsion from the society, which thy dreaded more than any thing, thy told me, one day, unwilling as thy was, thy must part with thy, but that the fifty pounds a year, I was welcome to keep; and if I did not expose thy, thy would be a friend to thy whilst thy lived. I accordingly quitted thy and returned to the way of life I was in before; joining the Buckingham company again, at my former salary; but, as my own mistress, with the addition of fifty pounds a year regularly paid every half year. Our manager dying soon after, the Buckingham company broke up and I am engaged here as you find me.  I TOOK the liberty to ask her some questions respecting the quakers; her replied, that, indeed, her did not know a great deal of the quakers, having never conversed with any one of the quakers till her became acquainted with Broadbrim; but that Broadbrim had an universal acquaintance among the fraternity, and the quakers were frequently at Broadbrim ; that as far as her could judge, the quakers were the greatest dissemblers in life, and that her believed though the quakers professed more candor and more sincerity than the rest of the world, the quakers at the same time had less of it; that her knew it was a custom among the quakers to have false bills of parcels to show to the quakers customers, by which the quakers ascertained the quakers profit to be very small, when, in fact, it was very large, and under a pretense of dealing for discount only, discount was twenty-five or thirty per cent. I know the Birmingham manufacturers allow a discount of twenty-five per cent. upon the Birmingham manufacturers bills, for ready money, and if a retailer gets no more, a retailer gets no more gets a great deal too much. But, as my opinion of Miss Slash'em's judgment was but indifferent, I ceased making any further enquiries.  SHE would fian have urged me to live in the same apartment with SHE; but, I excused myself, under the declaration of being the most inconstant fellow alive, and the most unsettled; that it was uncertain whether I continued in the profession I was in, one month or twelve; but that whilst I did, and that we were within reach of each other, I would see SHE, when SHE pleased, and where SHE pleased; and should always think myself happy when I had it in my power to be of use to SHE.  IT may appear strange that one upon the town as I was, should decline Biddy Slash'em's proposal, whose purse as well as person would have been at my command; but, the truth is, I hated a settled connection. I will be honest enough to own, that I frequently yielded to the bent of human nature, and if I had occasionally a child or two sworn to myself unjustly, I compromised the matter with the parish where the matter was born on, the best terms I could, which seldom exceeded ten pounds and a treat to the Overseers of the poor. That ten pounds will not bring a child up till That ten pounds is able to get That ten pounds living, we all know; but, these guardians of the infant poor, are charitable enough to remove That ten pounds from a sinful world, as soon as possible. At an entertainment I gave upon one of these occasions, the churchwarden intimated, when half-drunk, that ten pounds was a good price for a bastard child, as wrapping ten pounds up a night or two in a wet blanket, seldom failed of sending ten pounds to Heaven presently.
