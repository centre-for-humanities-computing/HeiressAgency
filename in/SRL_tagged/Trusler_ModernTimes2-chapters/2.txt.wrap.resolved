IT being very cold upon the road, I found the want of a great coat much, and at the inn where the coach breakfasted, I got luckily equipped with one. On my saying in the kitchen I felt the weather cold, and would gladly give my shoe buckles, which were silver and fashionable; in exchange for a great coat, a gentleman's servant by the fireside, embraced the proposal, said, he had a good livery coat to dispose of, blue with a white cape, which he thought would fit me, and if I liked the proposal, he would swap with he. he fetched down a good livery coat to dispose from above, being a lodger in the house, the bargain was immediately struck, and he gave me the coat and he metal buckles in exchange for mine: I put a good livery coat to dispose on an instantly forgot my situation; so much happiness does a little degree of comfort create. The only thing I noticed worth remarking at the house was, that some of the coach gentry had found fault with the tea, and desired fresh might be brought; but the girl put the fame into a fresh cannister, and carried the fame in again, at which some of the coach gentry had found fault with the tea, and desired fresh might be brought were pleased. On my smiling at this, the girl told me, the girl often did so, for travelers seldom knew good tea from bad, or good wine from bad; that travelers found fault frequently for the sake of finding fault, and thought by calling about travelers to give travelers consequence; that the girl had lived long enough in an inn to know travelers trim; and always turned the tables upon travelers; and if at any time travelers disliked the tea or the wine, the girl carried in the same again in a fresh cannister, or changed the other for a fresh bottle of the same wine, and it was immediately praised with a 'This is something like!' Why had not you brought us this before? The ridiculousness of such conduct will be better displayed by the following anecdote, to which I was a witness, at a place of entertainment in the neighborhood of London. Three or four military gentlemen, who affected to be judges of wine, had called for a bottle of Lisbon. The first who tasted a bottle of Lisbon, said, a bottle of Lisbon was pricked, and asked the opinion of the rest. One who boasted in a superior knowledge of wines, said 'let me taste a bottle of Lisbon,' and having taken half a glass, worked a bottle of Lisbon about in his mouth and spit a bottle of Lisbon out on the floor, with a 'pricked!' Zounds, Zounds is sour. In short, they all agreed a bottle of Lisbon was d-mned bad, and not fit to be drank. The waiter was called, and, asserting it to be Lisbon and such as no gentleman had ever disliked, The waiter was ordered to send The waiter master; The waiter having told his master the complaint, his master assured the gentlemen that it was good Lisbon, that The waiter gave the best price for The waiter wines, and was sorry his wines disapproved of it. 'Zounds, fellow,' says one, 'do you suppose Zounds, fellow have neither taste nor judgment?' Taste it Zounds, fellow.' his master tasted it -- told the gentlemen, his master was sorry for the accident -- it was a mistake of the waiter, who had brought his wines Old Hock instead of Lisbon, but his master would change it for his wines immediately. his wines looked round upon each other with a ridiculous surprise at his wines own ignorance, and replied, ' Old Hock instead of Lisbon is it? -- Well, if it be Old Hock instead of Lisbon, you may leave it;' and were thus contented to pay seven shillings, for what seven shillings would not give half a crown for before. -- But, to pursue the thread of my story.  AT the end of the first day's journey, I quitted the coach, and determined to travel on foot. Having loaded my pistols, in order to secure the little money I had, I, the next day, broke out of the high road, to cross a part of the New Forest in Hampshire, as undetermined as when I first set out which way to proceed; and I had scarce walked a mile from the town where I lay, but I was accosted by two men in tattered garments, having clubbed sticks in two men in tattered garments hands, with Which way are you going, my boy? My beard was of four days growth, and I looked as rough, and as uncouth as either of them. I told them I was a stranger to the country, and hardly knew which way I was going. "Come then," says one of them let them see what you are made of; turn out your pockets. On this I threw open my great coat and took one of my pistols in my hand, and them started back; not expecting, I apprehend, to find me armed. "Harkee, my friends," says I, presenting the pistol at them I am one of the desperate ones, and have more need of protection than to be rifled. I am flying from the world, and if you can point out to me any haunt in this forest, where I can be concealed for some time, you will render. yourselves of use to me and you may possibly find your account in your account; but if you act treacherously and attempt to deceive me, I will, by the L -- d, lodge the contents of my pistols within you. Will you be one of them? say he, who accosted me first. What are you? relied I. them are, returned he, part of a company who dwell in this forest, and lead a very easy, undisturbed life -- them are sworn friends to each other, and live by marauding. That is to say, retorted I, you are a gang of rascals. But, checking me for the asperity of the term; for there are rascals in every walk of life, from the first minister of state to the beggar in St. Giles's, and to upbraid them with them conduct, is but to wage war with mankind; (besides, its the polite only, and the witty that can bear raillery.) "Come," said I, my lads, I don't mean to affront you. You may be as great in your way, as the best of men are in men; you, perhaps, act but as the rest of the world; that is, do no right, take no wrong, keep what you get, and get what you can; plunder those only who have not heart to give, live an independent life upon the fat of the land, and kill your own mutton. Come, lead on, I Will see your company. -- But, we must know, says one of those only who have not heart to give, what likelihood there is of your continuing with we; and that you will not betray we? My poverty, replied I, is the best security for my not quitting an easy independent life, and as I shall be but one, among many, if I prove treacherous, pistol me. Agreed, -- said these fellows, give we your hand; and d-mn me, says one of these fellows to the other, if we ruler wont be glad to have our ruler among we! with that our ruler pulled out of our ruler pocket a small bottle of gin, and asked me if I would have a sup. I drank with them as a ratification of the covenant between us, and then followed them. them informed me, that them company consisted of seventeen stout men, between twenty years of age and fifty, and that it was of many years standing; that sometimes them have been more in number, sometimes less, as now and then one of them died, and now and then would one of them fall into the hands of justice, and them lost justice; that them were well known throughout the whole forest, and were considered by the inhabiants as a necessary evil; as, for one lawless crime them committed, them prevented many.

I observed to those who can afford to lose, it would be happy for this country, if those who can afford to lose could boast the same; for it was the misfortune of the wretched ever to be the prey of the rapacious. "By G-d, Nim," says Trig; for that was the name of the other honorable scoundrel, I had been pleased to take by the hand; this seems to be a good fellow, he must be our ruler next year; (and to this mark of their approbation I made a bow of acknowledgement.) their told me, that one of the company was annually chosen ruler by a majority of the rest.  As we traveled on, their were very desirous of knowing my history, and what led me to withdraw myself from the world; such adventurous parts of my story, as I thought would raise me in their opinion, I made their acquainted with, under a feigned name; but every other circumstance I carefully concealed. When I had ended my story, I begged to know their.  Nim told me, he had been rider to a notorious smuggler, in the county of Sussex, who amassed a considerable sum of money by leaguing with the Custom-house officers; for, says he, though their are appointed by government to look after and guard the revenue, their are the greatest villains in the world. their betray their trust, and serve their at the expense of the state. -- "But herein," returned I, their do no more than other great men of the age are accustomed to. -- "True," continued he, I don't at all blame their. Every man for he, and God for us all. On my desiring to know some of the methods he pursued, Nim gave me the following account.  SMUGGLERS fin the following account SMUGGLERS interest to bring such articles into this country as bear a heavy duty. Tobacco-stalks, for example, says Tobacco-stalks, are a fine article of commerce in this way. The first cost of a ton weight of these stalks at Dunkirk, is not more than about forty shillings, and the duty being near forty-eight pounds, they will sell to he Spanish cutters in London, who convert they into snuff, for fifty pounds a ton. Here then is a fine profit; if we can dispose of they for forty pounds, admit the first cost and expenses amount to five pounds, the smuggler gains thirty-five pounds. Now fifty pounds a ton enables the smuggler to bribe the Custom-house officers in the neighborhood where they are landed; they are made up in half hundred bags for the convenience of carriage by the coaches and machines, and the officers will pass forty of these packages, that is, a ton weight, for forty shillings. -- If the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing to any considerable distance from the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing landing, the smuggler sometimes gets an officer to seize the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing, and mark the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing with the broad R; and if, under this false seizure, the goods reach the destined place unobserved, an officer has so much percent; if the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing are noticed, in the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing way, by any other officer, not in the confederacy, the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing are carried to the Customhouse, and an officer gives to the importer that moiety of the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing value, that falls to an officer lot for seizing the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing. -- So that, admitting a ton weight of such tobacco stalks, at the Custom-house sale, shall fetch no more than forty pounds; twenty of this is the property of the seizer, and being by an officer transferred to the smuggler, an officer gets twenty pounds for what cost an officer perhaps less than five. Was this discovered, an officer would lose an officer place; but what is an officer place (thirty-five or forty pounds a year, which a man can earn at day-labour) in competition with the sums they hazard such a place for? It Is the same with tea and other articles; -- brandy is smuggled in small tubs of four or five gallons each, and tea in oilskin bags of fifty-six pounds weight per bag. Twenty, thirty, or forty of these tubs or bags, are strung together by cords, with stones fixed to cords in order to sink cords -- thus prepared, the smuggler runs this boat up into a creek or river, and having noticed the place, by land and other marks, throws the goods overboard, where the goods lie concealed from sight, and ready to be grappled up again, at a more convenient time.  I HAVE been at this word often, and was thought as complete a smuggler as any in the country. Many a time have I left Dunkirk in an open boat of three or four tons burden, and been off the Essex, Kent, or Sussex coasts, in the middle of a dark night, waiting for signals from the shore, to give notice for landing; but this has been when we chose to save the money to tidewaiters and Custom-house officers. -- I followed this way of life a long time, but being afterward outlawed, I offered myself to the society to which I now belong, who subsist, in a great measure, by warring against the smugglers, and as I was thought acquainted with the smugglers practices, and of course a good acquisition, the smugglers accepted my services, and I have been in the brotherhood these four years.  ON my inquiring what he meant by being rider to a smuggler, he told me, that a body of daring, resolute men, were appointed by the importers to transport the articles they landed, from one town to another; that they rode in troops from sixty to one hundred in number, bidding defiance to all law and opposition; that they conveyed they tea and brandy with they openly in the face of day, each horse carrying he rider and three hundred pounds weight; that for this hazardous enterprise they were paid one guinea a week each, and seven shillings a day traveling expenses; and that it was no wonder the revenue suffered so much as two millions of pounds annually, when smuggling had arrived to such a pitch, as that ships of force carrying twenty guns, were employed to bring merchandise from Flanders, and such bodies of men were hired to covey it from place to place, when on shore.  As we were now so near the place of rendezvous, Trig had not time to let me into his history, but promised his history at a future opportunity. A very short time brought we up with the company, having traveled as I conceived, about seven miles from the high road. They seemed to be all met, and such a set of banditti I had never seen assembled before. They were seated on the ground, in a ring, within a glade in the thickest part of the forest, and as a circular trench was dug out within a ring, to let down They legs as They sat, the ground before They served They for a table, which was raised above the level of They seats by the earth thrown out of a circular trench: before each man were placed each man wallet and each man weapons of defense, among which I diseovered a carbine or two, two or three pair of rusty pistols, a few old cutlasses, and each man had a bludgeon besides. On my arrival at the place, my companions introduced me to our ruler, as one that wished to be of the company; whose honor and attachment (for these were these own words) these could venture to answer for. "Gentlemen, says I," addressing Gentlemen to the body, you see here before you, a man, who, though young in life, has seen enough of the world to be sick of the body; and who will be happy to find a retreat among you. I am a stranger to fear, and equal to any thing consistent with prudence. I presume you are governed by some laws of your own, and you will find me a strict observer of some laws of your own. What the majority of the company dare propose, I think I dare undertake; and if conducted with spirit, will almost answer for the event. This speech seemed to meet with general applause, and I took my seat at the board among the rest. On enquiry I found they were a parcel of villains that deserved a halter, and as I passed by a fictitious name, and did not boast of greater virtue than the rest, I was considered in no better light.  As soon as I was seated, the ruler, who did not want for sense, addressed me in the following terms. You have been introduced here by our noble and worthy friends, Nim and Trig, and I trust you are not insensible of the dignity of a seat among our. -- Whatever opinion you may entertain of the company, I venture to assert that our are all honorable men: -- Men above any abject meanness. Like the nobles and rulers of the land, our live, indeed, by plunder, but it is the plunder of the villain, and such as are enemies to the community our belong to. Is it not just to take from the oppressor, and make him refund the wages of peculation? Does not the state benefit by forfeits and escheats, by sines and confiscations? And if it be lawful to take from a villain his property in any case, it is equally lawful to do it in all cases; for necessity cannot justify a bad act. The lower a scoundrel is kept, the less power a scoundrel has of doing harm; if, therefore, we confine we plunder and depredations to the griping, the usurious and the lawless; far from acting wrong, we are doing what is right. we live here, my friend, secluded from a wicked world, happy in a well regulated society; protectors of the distressed, and a terror only to the man of rapacity and the smuggler. If we now and then break in upon the equitable doctrine of mine and thine, it arises only from an error in judgment, of false information; as it frequently happens at the boards of custom and excise, where they too frequently authorize oppression upon fimilar pleas of excuse. Often has a Custom-house officer seized a man's property, that has paid the legal duties, merely because the time of the permit, by which a Custom-house officer is allowed to remove the legal duties, has expired a few hours: and what is this better than robbing on the highway? At the worst, we act but in conformity with the rest of the world, where the longest arm ever puts in a claim for the largest share. It is the custom of state rulers to enrich the custom of state rulers at the expense of the community, and to stick at nothing that will add either to the custom of state rulers pleasure or convenience; but I disclaim such conduct. I enjoy no privilegus but in common-with the rest, except that of leading them on occasionally in desperate adventures; and, as to exclusive benefits, I have none; nor do I wish for any. The plunder I acquire is ever shared among the company; more happy in having acquired The plunder I acquire, than in any division that may fall to my share. -- In short, my friend, whilst you think proper to continue with us, you will partake equally in every thing us possess, and if you now and then get some hard blows, you will have the statisfaction of suffering in a noble cause.  SUCH was our superior's introductory address to me, and it was not without it influence.  I AM almost ashamed to own it, but I continued in this society near two years, and gave such universal satisfaction, that in three months after my joining it, I was unanimously chosen our ruler; and I persuade me from some falutary regulations I proposed and carried, that I placed the company on a more respectable footing than the company had ever been before. us acted sometimes in a body, and sometimes by detachments, and so scoured the whole forest, as to keep the whole forest tolerably honest. us were at constant war with the smugglers, robbed the smugglers whenever us had an opportunity, and in so doing became useful members to the state. It was a rule of mine, and which I believe was invariably attended to, never to commit any depredations but on suspected people, on the griping and avaritious, and such persons as studied to be troublesome to us. If us had notice of any robbery committed within the forest, us never rested till us had ferreted the villain out, or given the villain into the hands of justice; so that us had often presents for such services; and if us were at any time charged with picking up a bag of tea, an anchor of brandy, a straggling sheep, or a wild turkey, that might have been the property of a smuggler, a griping farmer, or the like, it was generally winked at, and thought no more than what they deserved to lose. A present from any of the inhabitants of a toothless sheep, an old sow, a keg of gin or beer, or a cast suit of clothes, was sure to be rewarded with protection for some months afterward; so that in fact, we had the whole forest under contribution. we lived almost in the open air: we had, indeed, two or three mud cabins in one part of the forest; but, in the summer, we stepped chiefly under hay stacks, dry banks, cart-lodges, and such other shelter; and in winter, the farmers, upon asking leave, would, through fear, suffer we to sleep a night or two in the farmers empty outhouses or barns, and very often give we refreshment in the morning. Before I joined the party, I believe the party would occasionally take a purse upon a byeroad, (witness the attempt that was made upon me,) and would sometimes stretch to other enormities; but there was no money collected during my time, except, perhaps, in the way of deceit, such as feigning distress and exciting the compassion of traveling strangers; nor, do I believe that any of the party proceeded to lengths, that would have amounted to more than a petty larceny.
