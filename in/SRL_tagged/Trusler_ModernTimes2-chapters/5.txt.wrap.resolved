WITH this fifty pounds I determined to set up for myself, accordingly I quitted my place, and hearing of an orphan young lady of seventeen years of age, who was heiress to a fortune of six thousand a year, one thousand of which she enjoyed durher minority, and who lived with an aunt at the west end of the town; I determined to make a bold push, and try if I could not carry she; with this view I equipped myself with a suit or two of genteel clothes, and passed for a gentleman. Having found out the house where she lived, I frequently walked under the window, with the hopes of seeing she, and, at last I saw one whom I took to be she, and she was as pretty, as she was rich. My next step was, if possible, to get access to she. For this purpose, I went to a public-house in the neighborhood, addressed myself to a chairman I there found, and made many enquiries respecting the family, particularly where the family visited, and where the family resided in the country: all this I learnt; this done, I contrived to get to the ear of some of the servants, which I likewise effected. The chairman to whom I first applied, told me, that the footman and coachman used a public-house in the neighborhood, and were generally there in an evening between tea-time and supper. At this hour I went, and was introduced to the footman and coachman used that house, and were generally there in an evening between tea-time and supper. I took the footman and coachman apart, gave the footman and coachman to understand I was a gentleman and a man of family and fortune; that accident had thrown me into the way of the footman and coachman young mistress and I wished to be better acquainted with his young mistress; and if the footman and coachman would assist me in so doing, I would endeavor to be the footman and coachman friend, and as an earnest of that friendship I tipped the footman and coachman half a guinea: the footman and coachman promised me all the assistance in the footman and coachman power, and told me, that both his young mistress and his young mistress aunt were to be at the play the next day, having a couple of box tickets for a benefit. This intelligence was every thing I could wish. I was at the theater the same night, procured admission into the same box, and had the happiness to be particularly noticed by his young mistress; for I set close by his young mistress side. When the play was over, I handed his young mistress to his young mistress carriage, and politely took my leave. The day following, I found out the footman and coachman again, and made enquiries respecting the lady's maid. the footman and coachman assured me, his young mistress was an open-hearted girl, and did not doubt, but his young mistress would favor my views. I wished very much to see his young mistress; and the footman and coachman promised to ask his young mistress to give me a meeting. An opportunity soon occurred for that purpose; the footman and coachman brought me word the next day, that the footman and coachman young mistress and her aunt, went out an airing every morning about twelve, and that if I would go to the house in his young mistress and her aunt absence, the footman and coachman had made his young mistress and her aunt porter acquainted with my wishes, and the footman and coachman would let Miss's maid know when I was there. I took the first opportunity of going, and saw the coach drive from the door. A tete-a-tete soon took place between me and the maid, whom I made also my friend by a present of five guineas. my friend promised to plead my cause with my friend young mistress, and did it effectually. An interview was appointed, and I was to meet my friend in Kensington Gardens. On the day fixed, my friend promised to be there with my friend maid, who, on my coming up, retired. I had now an opportunity of pressing my suit, and I did an opportunity of pressing my suit with as much warmth, as if I had been really in love. I told my friend a thousand lies so passionately, that the poor little credulous thing believed them all, and at parting promised to meet me again the first opportunity. The ice being now broken, through the means of this servant, we carried on a correspondence for near a month, when I was given to understand, that the family was retiring to the family seat in Hampshire."  THIS business was expensive, but thinking myself sure of my prize, I obtained goods upon credit, and pawned goods as soon as delivered; by this means, I was enabled to keep up appearances. I followed Miss into the country, where under a pretense of taking a walk, I had frequent opportunities of being with Miss, unnoticed by Miss aunt. The servants I took care to keep in my interest. Miss agreed at last to give me Miss hand, and her hand was proposed that we should set off for Scotland, and that Miss maid should accompany we. Having thus brought things to a crisis; and finding Miss was possessed of some very valuable diamonds, I advised Miss by all means to take those with Miss, as Miss could not think of returning home, and it was impossible to make a proper appearance without those: Miss acquiesced with this proposal, and the day was fixed for Miss elopement; but as the devil would have this proposal, and accident happened that overthrew all I had been about.  THERE being at the house I was at, an evening club, where the neighbors used to meet, smoke the neighbors pipes and fettle the affairs of administration; having been admitted among the neighbors, I passed my time rather agreeably than otherwise. One of the party was an elderly tradesman, lately married to a smart young woman, whom I had once or twice seen, and was much taken with; but an elderly tradesman, lately married to a smart young woman, whom I had once or twice seen, and was much taken was so much under petticoat government, that Miss used to fetch an elderly tradesman, lately married to a smart young woman, whom I had once or twice seen, and was much taken home at night at a regular hour. an elderly tradesman, lately married to a smart young woman, whom I had once or twice seen, and was much taken had been often rallied on this head, and was so greatly ashamed of this head, that, under a promise not to stay longer than eleven, Miss agreed to go to bed before an elderly tradesman, lately married to a smart young woman, whom I had once or twice seen, and was much taken. Like other babblers, who often lay open their own affairs unasked, and frequently to their prejudice; an elderly tradesman, lately married to a smart young woman, whom I had once or twice seen, and was much taken gave us to understand, Miss was too jealous to suffer the maid to fit up for an elderly tradesman, lately married to a smart young woman, whom I had once or twice seen, and was much taken, and that as the door would not unlock on the outside, the door was left upon the latch. On being asked whether Miss left a light. A light? Says he, no. -- us house is not so large, but I can find my way up into my room without a light; us lay but on the one pair of stairs, over the shop. I was determined he should one day pay dear for this communication, and concerted this communication with the rest of the company, to keep he from home beyond he usual hour, to see whether he wife would come the next night to fetch he. Accordingly, in the course of conversation, talking of the uxoriousness of husbands, I put my gentleman upon the metal, and offered to lay my gentleman a bet of two guineas, that my gentleman durst not stay out that night till half after twelve. From an opinion that my gentleman would be asleep, and not know the hour of my gentleman return, my gentleman took a bet of two guineas, and when the clock struck eleven, was exceeding good company. About twenty minutes after, I took a French leave, went over to my gentleman house, lifted the latch, and without much difficulty, found my way into the chamber over the shop. All was quiet, and the fair one asleep. Having undressed my gentleman at the stair head without the door, I stole into the room, and the reader may suppose I was not long before I was between the sheets. I had but little time, and was determined to make the best use of it. his wife soon waked and spoke to my gentleman, but found me not disposed to answer. However, whether his wife was able in the dark, to distinguish between his wife husband and me, or any way discovered the cheat, I know not; but this I know, his wife was as kind to my gentleman as I could wish. -- When I found his wife composed, I began to retire, but his wife soon missed me from the bed, and hearing me fumbling at the door, and I not answering his wife when his wife spoke, suspecting I suppose, some trick had been played his wife, his wife rose with great anger, seized me by the arm before I could get away, alarmed his house, and I was unfortunately discovered. I was however, suffered to dress my gentleman and return to my quarters.  THIS affair made a great noise in the village, and presently reached the mansion. The young lady I was to accompany to Scotland, took offense at my conduct; and I could never get to see The young lady I was to accompany to Scotland again. Other reasons might cooperate against my gentleman, but I could not learn what Other reasons were. I wrote one or two letters to The young lady I was to accompany to Scotland, but all to no purpose. The family presently left the country, and I heard of The young lady I was to accompany to Scotland no more: it was a fortunate event for The young lady I was to accompany to Scotland, but a d -- n'd unlucky one for my gentleman.  The injured husband determined to prosecute me for violating the honor of hs wife; but the lawyers could not well advise The injured husband how to proceed. Some proposed indicting me capitally for Burglary; lifting a latch and entering a dwelling house by night, if done with a felonious intent, being a species of that crime; but as hs wife was consenting to the act the wife was consenting to the act could not be felony, of course, not burglary. The same argument prevented The same argument being deemed a rape. Others were for indicting me for grand larcency or stealing privately from the person; but what did I steal? Nothing but hs wife consent. This not being any thing that could in fact be carried away, the idea of proceeding on that statute fell to the ground. Actions of trespass, seduction, etc. were then proposed; but the whole centered at last in a prosecution for crim. con.  BUT this being more than I could stand, I thought this better to decamp; and wishing, as you did, to hide myself for a while, I made a proposal to this company to join them, and them admitted me among them.  IN this savage state, though I could boast of few indulgencies, the life I led was orderly, and free from embarrassments. There was a strict discipline kept up among us, and a dread of being impeached kept the unruly in awe; for had an information been laid by any individual of the gang against his comrades, the neighboring magistrates would never have noticed the neighboring magistrates; whereas an impeachment by the whole gang of any individual, would have been sufficient to have called out a warrant against his; so much was this company considered as a necessary evil. At our general meetings, each of our, by turns, was the cook for the day, till the last year of my time, when our took in three young women among our, one of whom, by the general voice, as ruler, was to be sacred to myself, and the other two were in common among our. They all proved pregnant before I quitted this company, and though I did not continue long enough to see how They all got over the difficulty, I understood They all meant either to drop They all bastards in some distant parish, lay They all at the doors of some gentlemen's houses, or swear They all to persons that had been They all common disturbers. However, as I doubted the fidelity of my lady, I was not very uneasy about what became of my lady burden. An event happened that determined me to quit the connection, and when the connection took place I left my right in my lady to my successor.  INFORMATION had been given our, that in a part of the forest, concealed under ground, a body of smugglers had stowed a considerable quantity of brandy and other things; our found a body of smugglers out, and the booty consisted of 300 anchors of brandy, 200 half anchors of gin, and 25 bags of tea, containing 50 lb. each. This being lodged at a neighboring custom house, This was condemned and solf, and our part of the money amounted to 540 l. which, shared among eighteen was 30l. a man: thinking I should never meet with a better opportunity of equipping myself for a more respectable employ, when in possession of the cash, I took a French leave of my companions, and never have heard any thing of a French leave of my companions since.  It was in the summer time when I quitted the forest, and the first place I retired to was Lymington, where I staid long enough to get myself new dressed. It is almost inconceivable to think how I labored to reconcile my past conduct with what is equitable and right. I have often thought, that it is with diffioulty that men who have been brought up religiously, and with liberal notions, fall away from an honest course of life; I felt myself hurt at that I was just emerged from, and endeavored to convince myself, that I was not so bad, as the world may suppose me, from the account I have here given. I began with reflecting, that fear had driven me from one society, and that like a hunted animal I took shelter in the first place that offered: that I no sooner became a member of the company I have described, but I labored to reclaim them, and flatter myself that I in a great measure succeeded; from villains of the first denomination, I reduced them to scoundrels of the second, made them rather serviceable to the community than otherwise, and had them followed the example I pointed out by my own conduct, them might have separated and become honest men: I considered that unlike bad statesmen, bad citizens of every class, who are a scourge to all men, we only were a scourge to the obnoxious; and that if the necessities of a state can authorize and render eqitable the general plunder of our enemy, both by sea and land, we did no more, though in a narrower scale; we plundered only the enemies of the Customs, of the fair dealer, and of society. In a word, if I acted wrong, or an unequitable part in life, I took the first opportunity to relinquish it, and I wish every one could lay their hand upon their heart and say the same.  I will finish this chapter with a striking anecdote on the subject. A merchant of London was stopped on the highway by a man whom A merchant of London soon discovered to have been once A merchant of London servant. Instead of delivering A merchant of London purse as A merchant of London was ordered, A merchant of London began to reason with the robber. Good God, Thomas, could I have supposed that you woudl have taken to this course of life; you whom I always imagined strictly honest? -- Come, come, sir, replied the highwayman, bad an I am, I Am as honest as sir. Have not you employed your whole thoughts, time and fortune in fitting and sending out privateers to plunder the French, and other countries: and what is this but robbing on the high way? -- As different, says A merchant of London, as Light and day, for we have declared war against the French. If that be all the distinction, retorts the robber; I have declared war against all mankind. -- Therefore give me your money, or by God I Will blow your brains out. -- The only difference between you and me, said a pirate to Alexander the Great, who upbraided God with piracy, is, that I commit hostilities with a single ships, you with a whole fleet.
