IT being very cold upon the road, I found the want of a great coat much, and at the inn where the coach breakfasted, I got luckily equipped with one. On my saying in the kitchen I felt the weather cold, and would gladly give my shoe buckles, which were silver and fashionable; in exchange for a great coat, a gentleman's servant by the fireside, embraced the proposal, said, he had a good livery coat to dispose of, blue with a white cape, which he thought would fit me, and if I liked it, he would swap with me. He fetched down the coat from above, being a lodger in the house, the bargain was immediately struck, and he gave me the coat and his metal buckles in exchange for mine: I put it on an instantly forgot my situation; so much happiness does a little degree of comfort create. The only thing I noticed worth remarking at this house was, that some of the coach gentry had found fault with the tea, and desired fresh might be brought; but the girl put the fame into a fresh cannister, and carried it in again, at which they were pleased. On my smiling at this, she told me, she often did so, for travelers seldom knew good tea from bad, or good wine from bad; that they found fault frequently for the sake of finding fault, and thought by calling about them to give themselves consequence; that she had lived long enough in an inn to know their trim; and always turned the tables upon them; and if at any time they disliked the tea or the wine, she carried in the same again in a fresh cannister, or changed the other for a fresh bottle of the same wine, and it was immediately praised with a 'This is something like!' Why had not you brought us this before? The ridiculousness of such conduct will be better displayed by the following anecdote, to which I was a witness, at a place of entertainment in the neighborhood of London. Three or four military gentlemen, who affected to be judges of wine, had called for a bottle of Lisbon. The first who tasted it, said, it was pricked, and asked the opinion of the rest. One who boasted in a superior knowledge of wines, said 'let me taste it,' and having taken half a glass, worked it about in his mouth and spit it out on the floor, with a 'pricked!' Zounds, it is sour. In short, they all agreed it was d-mned bad, and not fit to be drank. The waiter was called, and, asserting it to be Lisbon and such as no gentleman had ever disliked, he was ordered to send his master; the waiter having told his master the complaint, the master assured the gentlemen that it was good Lisbon, that he gave the best price for his wines, and was sorry they disapproved of it. 'Zounds, fellow,' says one, 'do you suppose we have neither taste nor judgment?' Taste it yourself.' The master tasted it -- told the gentlemen, he was sorry for the accident -- it was a mistake of the waiter, who had brought them Old Hock instead of Lisbon, but he would change it for them immediately. They looked round upon each other with a ridiculous surprise at their own ignorance, and replied, ' Hock is it? -- Well, if it be Hock, you may leave it;' and were thus contented to pay seven shillings, for what they would not give half a crown for before. -- But, to pursue the thread of my story.  AT the end of the first day's journey, I quitted the coach, and determined to travel on foot. Having loaded my pistols, in order to secure the little money I had, I, the next day, broke out of the high road, to cross a part of the New Forest in Hampshire, as undetermined as when I first set out which way to proceed; and I had scarce walked a mile from the town where I lay, but I was accosted by two men in tattered garments, having clubbed sticks in their hands, with Which way are you going, my boy? My beard was of four days growth, and I looked as rough, and as uncouth as either of them. I told them I was a stranger to the country, and hardly knew which way I was going. "Come then," says one of them let us see what you are made of; turn out your pockets. On this I threw open my great coat and took one of my pistols in my hand, and they started back; not expecting, I apprehend, to find me armed. "Harkee, my friends," says I, presenting the pistol at them I am one of the desperate ones, and have more need of protection than to be rifled. I am flying from the world, and if you can point out to me any haunt in this forest, where I can be concealed for some time, you will render. yourselves of use to me and you may possibly find your account in it; but if you act treacherously and attempt to deceive me, I will, by the L -- d, lodge the contents of these pistols within you. Will you be one of us? say he, who accosted me first. What are you? relied I. We are, returned he, part of a company who dwell in this forest, and lead a very easy, undisturbed life -- we are sworn friends to each other, and live by marauding. That is to say, retorted I, you are a gang of rascals. But, checking myself for the asperity of the term; for there are rascals in every walk of life, from the first minister of state to the beggar in St. Giles's, and to upbraid them with their conduct, is but to wage war with mankind; (besides, its the polite only, and the witty that can bear raillery.) "Come," said I, my lads, I don't mean to affront you. You may be as great in your way, as the best of men are in theirs; you, perhaps, act but as the rest of the world; that is, do no right, take no wrong, keep what you get, and get what you can; plunder those only who have not heart to give, live an independent life upon the fat of the land, and kill your own mutton. Come, lead on, I Will see your company. -- But, we must know, says one of them, what likelihood there is of your continuing with us; and that you will not betray us? My poverty, replied I, is the best security for my not quitting an easy independent life, and as I shall be but one, among many, if I prove treacherous, pistol me. Agreed, -- said they, give us your hand; and d-mn me, says one of these fellows to the other, if our ruler wont be glad to have him among us! with that he pulled out of his pocket a small bottle of gin, and asked me if I would have a sup. I drank with them as a ratification of the covenant between us, and then followed them. They informed me, that their company consisted of seventeen stout men, between twenty years of age and fifty, and that it was of many years standing; that sometimes they have been more in number, sometimes less, as now and then one of them died, and now and then would one of them fall into the hands of justice, and they lost him; that they were well known throughout the whole forest, and were considered by the inhabiants as a necessary evil; as, for one lawless crime they committed, they prevented many. Not putting the greatest confidence in these my new friends, I made them rather walk before me, telling them, that as we became better acquainted, I, probably, should not be so mistrustful. They took what I said in good part; and told me, they thought we should reach their place of rendezvous by the hour of meeting, which was eleven o'clock. They led me through many intricate and bypath, and I observed, that though we passed several foresters, none took any more notice of us, than merely looking back upon us after we had passed them. One person we met, indeed, stopped and told us, his hen-roost had been robbed the night before, and asked the man, whose name was Nim, whether he had heard any thing of it; he assured him, he had not; for, I found, on conversing with them, that they suffered no plunder in the place, if they could help it, but what they committed themselves. "As for ourselves," says Nim, we act with generosity, and never take, but from those who can afford to lose. I observed to them, it would be happy for this country, if all men could boast the same; for it was the misfortune of the wretched ever to be the prey of the rapacious. "By G-d, Nim," says Trig; for that was the name of the other honorable scoundrel, I had been pleased to take by the hand; this seems to be a good fellow, he must be our ruler next year; (and to this mark of their approbation I made a bow of acknowledgement.) They told me, that one of the company was annually chosen ruler by a majority of the rest.  As we traveled on, they were very desirous of knowing my history, and what led me to withdraw myself from the world; such adventurous parts of my story, as I thought would raise me in their opinion, I made them acquainted with, under a feigned name; but every other circumstance I carefully concealed. When I had ended my own story, I begged to know theirs.  NIM told me, he had been rider to a notorious smuggler, in the county of Sussex, who amassed a considerable sum of money by leaguing with the Custom-house officers; for, says he, though these men are appointed by government to look after and guard the revenue, they are the greatest villains in the world. They betray their trust, and serve themselves at the expense of the state. -- "But herein," returned I, they do no more than other great men of the age are accustomed to. -- "True," continued he, I don't at all blame them. Every man for himself, and God for us all. On my desiring to know some of the methods he pursued, Nim gave me the following account.  SMUGGLERS fin it their interest to bring such articles into this country as bear a heavy duty. Tobacco-stalks, for example, says he, are a fine article of commerce in this way. The first cost of a ton weight of these stalks at Dunkirk, is not more than about forty shillings, and the duty being near forty-eight pounds, they will sell to he Spanish cutters in London, who convert them into snuff, for fifty pounds a ton. Here then is a fine profit; if we can dispose of them for forty pounds, admit the first cost and expenses amount to five pounds, the smuggler gains thirty-five pounds. Now this thirty-five pounds enables him to bribe the Custom-house officers in the neighborhood where they are landed; they are made up in half hundred bags for the convenience of carriage by the coaches and machines, and the officers will pass forty of these packages, that is, a ton weight, for forty shillings. -- If the importer wishes to smuggle in a larger quantity of stalks at a time, than one or two tons, and carry them to any considerable distance from their landing, he sometimes gets an officer to seize them, and mark them with the broad R; and if, under this false seizure, the goods reach the destined place unobserved, the officer has so much percent; if they are noticed, in their way, by any other officer, not in the confederacy, they are carried to the Customhouse, and the officer gives to the smuggling importer that moiety of their value, that falls to his lot for seizing them. -- So that, admitting a ton weight of such tobacco stalks, at the Custom-house sale, shall fetch no more than forty pounds; twenty of this is the property of the seizer, and being by him transferred to the smuggler, he gets twenty pounds for what cost him perhaps less than five. Was this discovered, the officer would lose his place; but what is his place (thirty-five or forty pounds a year, which a man can earn at day-labour) in competition with the sums they hazard such a place for? It Is the same with tea and other articles; -- brandy is smuggled in small tubs of four or five gallons each, and tea in oilskin bags of fifty-six pounds weight per bag. Twenty, thirty, or forty of these tubs or bags, are strung together by cords, with stones fixed to them in order to sink them -- thus prepared, the smuggler runs this boat up into a creek or river, and having noticed the place, by land and other marks, throws the goods overboard, where they lie concealed from sight, and ready to be grappled up again, at a more convenient time.  I HAVE been at this word often, and was thought as complete a smuggler as any in the country. Many a time have I left Dunkirk in an open boat of three or four tons burden, and been off the Essex, Kent, or Sussex coasts, in the middle of a dark night, waiting for signals from the shore, to give notice for landing; but this has been when we chose to save the money to tidewaiters and Custom-house officers. -- I followed this way of life a long time, but being afterward outlawed, I offered myself to the society to which I now belong, who subsist, in a great measure, by warring against the smugglers, and as I was thought acquainted with their practices, and of course a good acquisition, they accepted my services, and I have been in the brotherhood these four years.  ON my inquiring what he meant by being rider to a smuggler, he told me, that a body of daring, resolute men, were appointed by the importers to transport the articles they landed, from one town to another; that they rode in troops from sixty to one hundred in number, bidding defiance to all law and opposition; that they conveyed their tea and brandy with them openly in the face of day, each horse carrying his rider and three hundred pounds weight; that for this hazardous enterprise they were paid one guinea a week each, and seven shillings a day traveling expenses; and that it was no wonder the revenue suffered so much as two millions of pounds annually, when smuggling had arrived to such a pitch, as that ships of force carrying twenty guns, were employed to bring merchandise from Flanders, and such bodies of men were hired to covey it from place to place, when on shore.  As we were now so near the place of rendezvous, Trig had not time to let me into his history, but promised it at a future opportunity. A very short time brought us up with the company, having traveled as I conceived, about seven miles from the high road. They seemed to be all met, and such a set of banditti I had never seen assembled before. They were seated on the ground, in a ring, within a glade in the thickest part of the forest, and as a circular trench was dug out within this ring, to let down their legs as they sat, the ground before them served them for a table, which was raised above the level of their seats by the earth thrown out of the trench: before each man were placed his wallet and his weapons of defense, among which I diseovered a carbine or two, two or three pair of rusty pistols, a few old cutlasses, and each man had a bludgeon besides. On my arrival at this place, my companions introduced me to the ruler, as one that wished to be of the company; whose honor and attachment (for these were their own words) they could venture to answer for. "Gentlemen, says I," addressing myself to the body, you see here before you, a man, who, though young in life, has seen enough of the world to be sick of it; and who will be happy to find a retreat among you. I am a stranger to fear, and equal to any thing consistent with prudence. I presume you are governed by some laws of your own, and you will find me a strict observer of them. What the majority of this company dare propose, I think I dare undertake; and if conducted with spirit, will almost answer for the event. This speech seemed to meet with general applause, and I took my seat at the board among the rest. On enquiry I found they were a parcel of villains that deserved a halter, and as I passed by a fictitious name, and did not boast of greater virtue than the rest, I was considered in no better light.  As soon as I was seated, the ruler, who did not want for sense, addressed me in the following terms. You have been introduced here by our noble and worthy friends, Nim and Trig, and I trust you are not insensible of the dignity of a seat among us. -- Whatever opinion you may entertain of this company, I venture to assert that we are all honorable men: -- Men above any abject meanness. Like the nobles and rulers of the land, we live, indeed, by plunder, but it is the plunder of the villain, and such as are enemies to the community we belong to. Is it not just to take from the oppressor, and make him refund the wages of peculation? Does not the state benefit by forfeits and escheats, by sines and confiscations? And if it be lawful to take from a villain his property in any case, it is equally lawful to do it in all cases; for necessity cannot justify a bad act. The lower a scoundrel is kept, the less power he has of doing harm; if, therefore, we confine our plunder and depredations to the griping, the usurious and the lawless; far from acting wrong, we are doing what is right. We live here, my friend, secluded from a wicked world, happy in a well regulated society; protectors of the distressed, and a terror only to the man of rapacity and the smuggler. If we now and then break in upon the equitable doctrine of mine and thine, it arises only from an error in judgment, of false information; as it frequently happens at the boards of custom and excise, where they too frequently authorize oppression upon fimilar pleas of excuse. Often has a Custom-house officer seized a man's property, that has paid the legal duties, merely because the time of the permit, by which he is allowed to remove it, has expired a few hours: and what is this better than robbing on the highway? At the worst, we act but in conformity with the rest of the world, where the longest arm ever puts in a claim for the largest share. It is the custom of state rulers to enrich themselves at the expense of the community, and to stick at nothing that will add either to their pleasure or convenience; but I disclaim such conduct. I enjoy no privilegus but in common-with the rest, except that of leading them on occasionally in desperate adventures; and, as to exclusive benefits, I have none; nor do I wish for any. The plunder I acquire is ever shared among the company; more happy in having acquired it, than in any division that may fall to my share. -- In short, my friend, whilst you think proper to continue with us, you will partake equally in every thing we possess, and if you now and then get some hard blows, you will have the statisfaction of suffering in a noble cause.  SUCH was our superior's introductory address to me, and it was not without its influence.  I AM almost ashamed to own it, but I continued in this society near two years, and gave such universal satisfaction, that in three months after my joining it, I was unanimously chosen their ruler; and I persuade myself from some falutary regulations I proposed and carried, that I placed the company on a more respectable footing than it had ever been before. We acted sometimes in a body, and sometimes by detachments, and so scoured the whole forest, as to keep it tolerably honest. We were at constant war with the smugglers, robbed them whenever we had an opportunity, and in so doing became useful members to the state. It was a rule of mine, and which I believe was invariably attended to, never to commit any depredations but on suspected people, on the griping and avaritious, and such persons as studied to be troublesome to us. If we had notice of any robbery committed within the forest, we never rested till we had ferreted the villain out, or given him into the hands of justice; so that we had often presents for such services; and if we were at any time charged with picking up a bag of tea, an anchor of brandy, a straggling sheep, or a wild turkey, that might have been the property of a smuggler, a griping farmer, or the like, it was generally winked at, and thought no more than what they deserved to lose. A present from any of the inhabitants of a toothless sheep, an old sow, a keg of gin or beer, or a cast suit of clothes, was sure to be rewarded with protection for some months afterward; so that in fact, we had the whole forest under contribution. We lived almost in the open air: we had, indeed, two or three mud cabins in one part of the forest; but, in the summer, we stepped chiefly under hay stacks, dry banks, cart-lodges, and such other shelter; and in winter, the farmers, upon asking leave, would, through fear, suffer us to sleep a night or two in their empty outhouses or barns, and very often give us refreshment in the morning. Before I joined the party, I believe they would occasionally take a purse upon a byeroad, (witness the attempt that was made upon me,) and would sometimes stretch to other enormities; but there was no money collected during my time, except, perhaps, in the way of deceit, such as feigning distress and exciting the compassion of traveling strangers; nor, do I believe that any of the party proceeded to lengths, that would have amounted to more than a petty larceny.
