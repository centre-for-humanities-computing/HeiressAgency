THE day after I parted with Miss Slash'em, I got safe to Miss Slash'em uncle's house in Notts, and happy I was to see her uncle; nor did her uncle show less happiness in seeing me. It was now about three weeks since I left London, with a design of coming to this place; and I think, in so short a space of time, no one met with a greater variety of incidents. I related the story to her uncle; but not a word of her uncle niece. Ah, says her uncle, you see how kind and protecting the Almighty is; not a sparrow falls to the ground without her uncle observance! Lord S. is a very bad man; and I hope you will be able to bring the matter home to Lord S. That I certainly shall, says I; for the redress I shall look for, shall be a personal one. As a clergyman, and a very worthy one, Lord S. made use of every argument to dissuade me from such a step; but the injuries I had received were so great, that they had but little weight with me. I therefore turned the subject, and enquired whether Lord S. had received my letter. Lord S. told me Lord S. had, and by an express the day after it was written. So far those fellows who forced me on board the vessel, acted well. Lord S. gave me to understand, that my uncle had made a will, sometime before Lord S. died, and had left great part of Lord S. property to my cousins; but as Lord S. outlived my uncle had made a will, sometime before he died, and had left great part of his property to my cousins, the legacies were lapsed, and all the personals fell to me, with the entailed estate; that Lord S. having no relations to be found, and the executor Lord S. had appointed in Lord S. will, being also deceased, letters of administration were granted to Lord S. at Lord S. request, and Lord S. was ready to put me into possession immediately. I have, said Lord S., made many enquiries, for some years past, about you, but could het no satisfactory intelligence; however, since the death of your uncle, I have been more industrious in this business, and have found you out. What was necessary to be done in your absence, has been done; such as taking an inventory of the effects, and properly securing them; and I trust you will find every thing in as good order as circumstances admitted. With respect to your house in town, I wrote to your housekeeper, as you desired; directed your housekeeper to put the servants upon board wages, and when your housekeeper wanted any money, to apply to a friend of mine in London, whom I commissioned to supply your housekeeper.  AFTER thanking the vicar for his care, and the trouble his had taken, we went together to the mansion, when his gave me possession of all the keys. In your uncle's cabinet I found near five hundred pounds in bank notes and cash, and a memorandum, saying that his had twelve thousand pounds in the funds, and in what funds he had twelve thousand pounds in the funds lay. Having adjusted every thing for the present, visited the tenants, and left proper persons in the house, I presented Mr. Slash'em with a bank note of two hundred pounds, for the trouble I had given Mr. Slash'em, which Mr. Slash'em modestly refused; but which I insisted on Mr. Slash'em receiving, and further promised, that if it was ever in my power to be of use to Mr. Slash'em, I should neither forget it, nor omit it.  BEFORE I left Mr. Slash'em , Mr. Slash'em was very anxious to know how I had disposed of Mr. Slash'em since I left Mr. Slash'em part of the world; and considering Mr. Slash'em as my friend, I gave Mr. Slash'em a minute detail of every thing, except such parts as related to Mr. Slash'em niece, who, I found, had been entirely discarded by the family. Mr. Slash'em brother, the doctor, was, I learned, still at Hampstead, and doing very well.  THE Vicar was wonderfully entertained with my history, but disapproved much of some part of my conduct. However, THE Vicar presumed I had seen my error, and as now I was possessed of a good fortune, THE Vicar flattered THE Vicar, I should live a more regular life. my history, says THE Vicar, convinces me, that nothing is like giving a lad a good education; this will stick by THE Vicar when every thing else fails; enable THE Vicar to surmount every difficulty, and carry THE Vicar through life in spite of all opposition.  UPON examining the rental of my uncle's estate, I found the rental of my uncle's estate amount to a good four thousand three hundred pounds a year; which, with the interest of twelve thousand pounds in the stocks, the three hundred pounds a year I enjoyed from my wife, and my pension, etc. I had an income equal to near five thousand four hundred pounds a year.  I NOW set off for London, which I reached the next morning, and on my arrival at my own house, found every thing as I wished every thing. My servants, poor souls, were as glad to see me, as I was to see My servants, poor souls. I told My servants, poor souls how I had been trepanned, but not by whom; and that it was a chance of the highest improbability, that ever My servants, poor souls saw me again. My servants, poor souls said, the town was very silent then on the subject, for My servants, poor souls had heard nothing of the subject before. As to the lad that accompanied me to Finchly, I suppose My servants, poor souls sent the lad that accompanied me to Finchly aboard a man of war, for I never heard of the lad that accompanied me to Finchly afterward.  THE first visit I paid was to the Marquis of G. who received me very friendly, and to whom I related my story, and that I meant to call Lord S. to a very severe account for the lad that accompanied me to Finchly behavior. the lad that accompanied me to Finchly answer was, That business is already settled; Lord S. has done That business Lord S.. I requested an explanation. the lad that accompanied me to Finchly told me, that I was no sooner seized, but that Lord S. called upon the lad that accompanied me to Finchly, and boasted of what the lad that accompanied me to Finchly had done; said the lad that accompanied me to Finchly had you stopped under a fictitious warrant, and had transported you to Shetland; for that after disarming the lad that accompanied me to Finchly, as you had done, in the affair in Hyde Park, the lad that accompanied me to Finchly could never brook the idea of owing the lad that accompanied me to Finchly life to you, and of course, could never bear to see you again; and that news arriving of the vessel being cast away, and the crew saved, the lad that accompanied me to Finchly dreaded your return to town, and had accordingly put an end to the lad that accompanied me to Finchly existence with a pistol. The matter, continued the lad that accompanied me to Finchly, as the lad that accompanied me to Finchly is not missed, is not much talked of: The matter were better, therefore, to let The matter sleep, as reviving it will be of no use to you, and may hurt the feelings of his family; who, notwithstanding the faults of Lord S. is a very respectable one. As to his agents in this business, his agents in this business are wretches below your notice, could not possibly owe you any ill will, being villains that would be as ready, for a little money, to do as much for you as for his.  his lordship's arguments had HIS lordship's arguments due weight with you, and I determined to follow his advice. Though I execrated the conduct of Lord S. I dropped a tear at Lord S. fatal exit, and there the matter ended. How trifling a character is that of a man of fashion, and how convinced must a person be, that a character is a useless being in life, when a character considers that at a character death, a character leaves a world that will not miss a character!  THE marquis, among other things, told me, THE marquis Majesty had appointed THE marquis prime minister, and of all things, THE marquis should be happy if I would accept the secretaryship to the Treasury; that THE marquis was well acquainted with my abilities, and knew I should fill the office well; that THE marquis would open a borough for you, and I should be returned without trouble. I thanked THE marquis lordship for the honor THE marquis did me, and told THE marquis, that as I now stood single in life, and had no domestic concerns to take off my attention, I would accept the office cheerfully. Accordingly, I was soon after appointed, and returned for a ministerial borough: and the first satisfaction I derived from this employ, was having the office in my power to do a handsome thing by my friend the Vicar. THE marquis told me, about six months after I had been in office, that a rectory in the gift of the crown, and in the neighborhood of my estate in Nottinghamshire, of the yearly valuel of six hundred pounds a year and upwards, with a good house upon it, had fallen vacant, and that if I had any friend in that part of the world, whom I wished to serve, it should be at my disposal. I readily embraced the offer, thanked THE marquis for THE marquis politeness, and gave the offer to Mr. Slash'em, the offer being within distance, and tenable with the church THE marquis then held. This was the first good office of any magnitude, that I had ever in my power to perform; and if it be not vanity to say it, I will own, that it gave me a secret pleasure, and one so great, that I pined for an opportunity of doing a second. I am persuaded, that those who do good, will believe the truth of this assertion, and think there is more real gratification in giving than receiving. With a heart warmed by love and gratitude, my friend Slash'em waited on me to express my friend Slash'em acknowledgements for the service I had done my friend Slash'em, and I felt at the moment all the self-complacency, which a favor cheerfully and unexpectedly bestowed, and thankfully received, communicates to the feeling heart of the donor.
