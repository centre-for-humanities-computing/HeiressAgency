I NO sooner landed at Calais, but I found my heart at ease, and that weight upon my spirits, which had for some time oppressed me, instantly taken off. So necessary an ingredient is conscious rectitute to a man's happiness! I spoke little or no French, though I understood it tolerably well, of course was obliged to put up at English houses, where they were exceedingly extortionate. You no sooner arrive in Calais harbor, than the waiters from the different hotels or inns are ready to tear the clothes of your back, in order to prevail on you to go to the house to which they belong, and no sooner are you safely lodged within their house; but, they seem indifferent whether they see you after that time or not. I remember I put up at the Table Royal, and among other unreasonable charges, was thirty-six sols, or near nineteen pence of our money for reading an English newspaper, and on my remonstrating against the charge, they gave me to understand, that though I wore the appearance of a gentleman, I did not act like one. The comparative cheapness of wines and provisions in this part of the world, to what it is with us, leads English travelers to spend their money freely, and this seeming liberality, has spoiled the publicans upon all their roads; and where they will charge a native but one livre, that is, ten pence half penny, they will make an Englishman pay three. I was long enough abroad to find all this out, and therefore made a point of going to houses unaccustomed to receive the English; where if I did not dine according to our mode of eating, I had the satisfaction to have my dinner at one third of the price. Indeed, I found the disposition of taking an advantage of foreigners so general, that traveling in company with some German officers in the service of the French, they requested me to let them settle the bills as they passed, otherwise, very unreasonable charges would be made; this I cheerfully acquiesced with; but discovered I derived no advantage from their cautious conduct, for, I was sufficiently well acquainted with their money, to know, that in settling my quota of the sum expended, they took care to make me pay double what they did themselves, and of course they paid less than they would have done, had I not been of the party. It was a matter I found a difficulty of yielding to; but, as I did not care to enter into a dispute, in which I might come off the worst, I submitted for the little time I was with them to the imposition; and you will always find this the wiser step. In whatever part of the world you are, go as quietly through it as you can, and if you chance to stumble over a stone, don't quarrel with it, but pursue your way, and rejoice that it did not break your leg.  BEING abroad in a foreign country without recommendation, and without any intention of continuing long, I thought of little but looking about me and seeing what naturally presented itself to my view. I wandered from Dunkirk to Bruges, and from Bruges to Ghent; and being one Sunday morning at the chapel of the convent of the Rich Dames in that city, during high mass, I heard a shriek in the gallery among the nuns, which rather disturbed the ceremony for the moment; but as all was soon quiet again, I took no farther notice of it.  ABOUT nine o'clock in the evening, however, as I was sitting down to supper, at the St. Sebastian, in this town, the master of the hotel came into the room, and asked me if my name was not Outcast; if it was, a man below had a letter for me. The novelty of the circumstance, and a consciousness that I had no acquaintance that could know me in my present garb, for I was very smartly dressed, at first alarmed me; but as I had done no wrong, I had not much to dread. Having, therefore, ordered the person to be sent up stairs, I enquired from whom he came. If you are an English gentleman, replied he, and your name, Gabriel Outcast, that letter is for you; and if you will trouble yourself to look into it, you will soon learn from whence it comes. The messenger was a Fleming, but spoke English tolerably well. I broke open the seal, and the following were the contents in English.  SIR, THE writer of this letter is a female, in the year of her noviciate, at the convent of the Rich Dames. If your name be Gabriel Outcast, and from London, I am right in my address, and wish for an interview. Come to the grates of that convent, tomorrow at eleven; enquire for sister Agatha, pass for her kinsman, and you will see one probably whom you may wish to see.   ON reading this letter, I asked the man, who the person was that delivered that letter to him. He told me the porteress at the Rich Dames, and that his orders were, to go to every hotel in the city, till he found me; he had been at one or two, and he deemed himself fortunate in meeting with me as he did.  I CALLED for a pen and ink, and writ as follows.  THE letter from the female at the Rich Dames has luckily reached the person to whom it was addressed, and will be punctually attended to.  Nine o'clock. St. Sebastian's.  HAVING found Flanders, by all accounts that I had received, to be a country of intrigue, I concluded this to be a business of the same kind. However, I impatiently waited for the hour of assignation at the Rich Dames, and was there by the time the clock struck eleven. I enquired for sister Agatha, and was shown up into a parlour, where I had not been five minutes, before, I was, to my great astonishment, transported with the sight of my dear Miss Wildman, who seemed as much confused as myself, and was unable to utter a word. She put her hand through the grate, on which I imprinted a thousand kisses; and when I was able to speak, I told her, the happiness of meeting her where I so little expected to see her, totally overcame me. She said she was no less rejoiced on her part; that she had encountered a deal of trouble on my account; that she was anxious to know where I had been, and how I was circumstanced, and the reason she had never heard from me: in short, she wished to say a thousand things to me, which her situation prevented, but which she hoped I would give her some opportunity of doing. I showed her the ring, which, in her gracious moments, she had been pleased to give me, declared it had never been off my finger, and that for the many years I had lost sight of her, she had been ever in my thoughts. I fixed my eyes on her during these declarations, and saw the lovely tears trickle fast down her cheeks, and was sensible of all her emotions. She appeared as amiable in my eyes as ever; and if her monastic dress made any alteration in her form, it was that of rendering her far more lovely. I gave her to understand, that I was still a single man, and as much attached to her as ever, and that I dreaded to hear her story, lest the chapter of accidents should have placed her beyond my reach. When she had recovered herself, she told me she was not yet professed, of course not sequestered for life; that her endeavoring to search me out, was a test of the state of her mind; and that on a presumption she should find me as honorable as ever, she had written a few lines, which she would submit to my consideration, on my return to my lodgings: that the watchful eyes of the ladies in that house made it necessary she should not continue long at the grates; but that if I would excuse her leaving me so abruptly, she would be happy to give me a second meeting the next morning, at the same hour, and at the same place. Unwilling as I was to part with her, I was forced to submit. She, however, gave me her hand again to kiss, and I retired with my heart in my mouth, unable to utter another word.  I WAS no sooner without the walls of the convent, than I broke open the seal, and found the contents of her letter as follows:  MY DEAR GABRIEL, You cannot have forgotten our mutual vows of attachment. Though your heart may be estranged in the course of time from me, mine is as true as ever. Many an unhappy hour have I suffered, to preserve my vow inviolable, and many a distress have I experienced on your account. What could have prevented your writing to me as you promised? Or is it in the nature of men to trifle with us women? Having refused to marry a gentleman of my father's recommending, is the occasion of my being here, where had I not chanced to have seen you in the chapel on Sunday last, I should e're long have taken the veil; but, now all my former love is awakened, and all my fond expectations renewed. Guess my surprise at first seeing you where I did. -- I knew you instantly, and the surprise overcame me. I have unfortunately lost my mother, and by her death an estate of three hundred pounds a year devolves to me; but, my father withholds it from me, and it is by his injunctions that I am in this convent. Far from being inclined to a monastic life, I wish to be out of it, and if you are in any situation to maintain me, and will take me from it, I will throw myself under your protection, and wait the result of better fortune to befriend your distressed  ELIZA WILDMAN.   ENRAPTURED with the contents of this letter, I was impatient for a second interview. The next morning I saw her again, opened my whole heart to her, made her acquainted with my situation, and concerted means to get her off. I told her, if she would direct me how to act, I would implicitly follow her directions; that I would take the matrimonial vow the first opportunity that offered, according to the ritual of the Roman church, and would ratify it at the altar of our own, as soon as I set foot in England. We then entered on the mode of her escape, and the plan she pointed out was this. Here is, says she, in wax, an impression of the garden key, which was accidentally left in the door by some workmen, who are now within the convent, and which I found means to procure; get one made by it, and also such necessary articles of dress as I have set down in this paper, and when all things are prepared, I will meet you at the garden gate, an hour before matins on any morning you shall appoint. I approved her plan, and put it immediately into execution. A few days completed the whole, and having ordered a carriage to wait at the corner of the street adjoining the convent, about two o'clock one morning, according to appointment, when all was hushed and quiet, I met her at the garden gate, threw a long cloak and hood over her, locked the gate again, to prevent suspicion, and conducted her to the chaise, in which we made the best of our way to Lisle, a town in French Flanders, and out of the reach of the police of Brabant. We were got some miles from Ghent, before I could prevail on her to speak to me; at last, she looked round upon me, gave me her hand, and with a sigh exclaimed. -- How rashly, my dear Gabriel, do young women act! I fear you will yourself despise me for my conduct! I soon quieted her on that head, assured her it was the best proof of her affection she could give me, and that I trusted she would have no cause to repent it. -- We met with no interruption on the road, and by nine o'clock in the morning found ourselves at Lisle. As soon as we alighted at the Auberge, I sent for the mistress of the house, made her a confidante in the affair, and whilst my Eliza was dressing, desired a priest might be sent for, in order to discharge my conscience. An hour and a half did the business, her trunk was opened, and the maitresse d'hotel assisted at her toilette. The dress she had directed was a white lutestring with a pale yellow petticoat, and so fashionably was it made, so well put on, and her head so elegantly decorated, that I was more in love with her than ever. The whole family was present at the ceremony of our espousals, and I was blessed with the richest gift, in my opinion, which heaven had to give.  AFTER dinner we pursued our way to St. Omer's, where I took a lodging and spent two months in an uninterrupted state of happiness. As we heard nothing from Ghent, and was not enquired after; I apprehend it was never known what route we took.  HAVING given my Eliza a faithful detail of my adventures, which she acknowledged were the most extraordinary she had heard of, in so small a space of time; at my request one afternoon, she gave the following account of herself.
