IN consequence of the information I received, I prepared to set off for Nottinghamshire; but, as ill fortune too often chequers our good, an unexpected event happened, that overthrew all my measures. Having left London pretty early in the morning, with a view of getting to the end of my journey before night, I found myself on the edge of Finchley Common, about seven miles from town, at sun rise, when two men well mounted and armed, stopped my postillion; I had a loaded blunderbuss in the chaise, and would certainly have discharged the contents at them, had they not screened themselves from my vengeance, by getting so much before the lad, that had I fired I must inevitably have killed him. I looked out for my servant, who was likewise armed, but he was not within sight, and at this moment, two other men were behind the chaise, and swore, if I did not immediately throw out my blunderbuss and surrender, they would blow out my brains through my forehead, for they were not robbers, but King's officers. In this critical situation, I had no alternative; I complied with their injunctions, and asked them what they wanted. They gave me to understand, that they had a warrant to apprehend me, and that I must submit to go with them: that, if I was governable, they would use me well; but if I made any opposition, they should be obliged to bind me. I asked them by what authority they acted, and what was the cause of my being so seized; they produced a written paper, apparently a warrant, containing a charge of my having broken the peace, by challenging the Earl of S. and attempting to take away his life in Hyde Park. Scarce had they announced their business, but an empty post-chaise came up, into which they insisted upon my removing, having first searched me for firearms; I begged they would permit me to take my portmantua with me, which contained my necessaries, and suffer me to wait for my servant, who was behind. They told me, they had secured my servant before they overtook me, and that he was taken back to town; that my luggage, which was not more than a few shirts and a second coat, I might take with me, if I pleased, provided I would discharge the post-chaise in which I then was, send my blunderbuss home by the driver, and go quietly with them. In this I acquiesced, and a few minutes put me completely into their possession. One of the men got into the chaise with me, two rode before, and the other brought up the rear, leading the horse of him who was seated by me. I addressed myself to my new companion several times, with where are you going to carry me? This is not the way to town and the like, (for I found they had quitted the north road, and had got into one I was unacquainted with) but I could get nothing from him; so that I was obliged to abandon myself to my reflections, which were not the most pleasing I had experienced; for I conceived this (as I afterward found it) a second attempt of Lord S. to kidnap me, which fortunately for him, succeeded better than the first. I was hurried, as fast as the horses could go, across the country, and in about three horus arrived at the Thames side, a little below Grays in Essex, where my fellow traveller, with great composure, consigned me to the care of the master of a vessel lying off the shore, and then ready to sail. He now gave me to understand, that I was obliged to the lenity of Lord S. for the disposal he was a going to make of me; for that, if I had been carried before a magistrate, I should have had a much more disagreeable lodging, as Newgate in that case, would have been my place of residence for some time, and my exit would be at Tyburn; that, if I behaved well where I was going, his lordship would be always my friend; but that to live in the same land with me, he never could think of doing. I inquired the place the vessel was bound to, but could get no answer: finding therefore, that I was likely to be absent from home for some time, I requested leave to write a letter to a friend or two, to arrange my affairs, which my conductor consented to my doing, and promised they should be faithfully delivered, provided he saw the contents, and that they gave no information where I might be found. This being promised, I was suffered to go down into the cabin in company with this same man, and write my letters. The first I wrote was to Mr. Slash'em, the vicar, acknowledged the receipt of his, and to remove any doubt of its being sent, I told him, that as business of the highest importance obliged me to quit England for some time, and of course, would prevent my being with him as I intended, I requested and authorized him to take such measures, as he should think necessary to secure my property till my return, for which he should have my best thanks. I also desired him to take care of my house and property in town, having left it without giving my servants any directions, but that he would find my people obedient to his commands, as I had wrote home and ordered them so to be. -- The other letter I wrote, was to my housekeeper in town, enjoining her to follow Mr. Slash'em's directions, till she saw me. These letters my conductor was pleased to approve, and assured me, they should be carefully conveyed according to the addresses. I begged they might both be sent express, and he promised they should. -- I was now a little more at my ease, and flattered myself I should find some means of regaining my liberty. My conductor and his attendants shortly after took their leave, and wished me a good voyage, and we soon set sail. -- The vessel I was in, was a small one of about one hundred tons burden, and our ship's company consisted of a Jew, (not a cabin passenger) the master and five seamen. The vessel did not seem heavy laden, nor could I learn to what place she was bound. The captain appeared to be a plain man, and of few words, and those few he was master of, he seemed to withhold, for I could scarce get him to speak. -- I had reason, however, to believe, that he was appointed to carry me to some distant part, for I remarked, that in our passage down the river, he kept at some distance from shore, where any town was near, and was careful not to go too close to any vessel upon the river, lest I suppose, I might have been induced to call out for assistance. -- The tide served, and the wind blowing brisk, we were soon at the Nore, and wishing for some refreshment, I was presently accommodated with what, at sea, is thought a good dinner, (salt beef and biscuit) but which I found very little appetite for: however, I eat a few mouthfuls, drank a little rum and water, and laid me down upon the bed in the cabin, where, with the fatigue I fell fast asleep; my watch told me it was nine in the evening when I laid down, and when I awoke, it was five in the morning. My sleep was rather broken, from a bed I was unused to, and the troubles of the day, but, broken as it was, it calmed my mind and gave me relief. I had now time to think, and nothing to interrupt me; the captain with his men were busy upon deck, and the vessel seemed going very fast. On my ascending from the cabin, I found we were on the open sea, and out of sight of land. Asking the captain where we were, he said in the Channel, (which I afterward found was not true) and on my enquiring to what place he was bound, he replied to Nova Scotia. Having in my portmantua about fifty pounds in bank notes, and a diamond ring worth about as much, I determined to try the power of a bribe, and see whether I could not prevail on him to put me on shore somewhere in England. Accordingly, I requested the favor of a quarter of an hour's conversation with him, the first leisure he had. He soon indulged me with it, and when together, I made him acquainted with my situation, and the whole history of Lord S.'s behavior to Miss Wildman and to me, and endeavored to work upon his feelings, by representing the treachery of his employer, and the cruelty with which he treated me. Whether he believed me or not, I cannot say, but he listened with great attention, paused when I had done, and when I expected him to have joined issue with me, he rose from his seat and was going to leave me, with, if he is as bad-conditioned, messmate, as you say, d-m me if the same vessel should hold us; you may be happy you're shipped off for another country; I importuned him to stay, told him I was master of fifty pounds, and a ring worth as much more, that, if he would put me ashore in some part of England, or on board some vessel going there, both should be at his service; at which he grew warm -- a bribe! exclaimed he, did you ever know an English seaman run from his colors, or betray his cause for a bribe, d-m me, they shall never say that of Jack Hawser. Not betray a good cause, replied I, but there is merit surely, in overturning a bad one. Harkee, messmate -- that is the commodore's look out; my orders are to make for Nova Scotia, and there you go, my friend, unless we bulge in the passage. At this he left me, crying to the man at the helm, luff up my lad, and to the man forward, hoist the main top sail; and we'll make all the way we can. -- D-m me, here is a fine breeze.  I BEGAN now, to think of my poor Eliza and her little infant, and for the first time, found a satisfaction in reflecting they were out of the reach of being affected by my misfortunes. Whatever is, is best; so says philosophy: here she is right. Had my Eliza been living, she would not only have felt this accident severely, but I should have doubly felt it; have felt for her as well as for myself. She, however, thought I, is happy, and why should I be otherwise? My property is safe in Mr. Slash'em's care, and as I am in health, and stand alone in life, what matters it, whether I am going to Nottingham, or Nova Scotia? I have encountered many a difficulty, and overcome them all. -- Providence has hitherto protected me -- why should I distrust her now?  I WAS led once or twice, when the captain was below, to endeavor to bring over the sailors to my interest, but considering, that had I not succeeded, the captain might have rendered my situation far more disagreeable than it was, I thought it best to desist.  THE next day, an accident happened that extricated me from my difficulty. The vessel, owing to the carelessness of the steersman, struck upon a bank, and sprung a leak. All hands to the pump, or by G -- d, we are at the bottom, was the cry -- but, it was the cry of one of the foremast men: disagreeable as my situation was before, it was much worse now. We were supposed to be seven leagues from land, and the sea run too high, to think ourselves in any safety -- the vessel made water so fast, that the master despaired of saving her; however, he consoled himself in the idea of being insured more than she was worth, and determined to take to his boat. We may pump her to land, says one of the sailors, very well. Hold your jaw, says the Captain, or I Will unship some of your teeth; I shall get more by her sinking than her swimming, so let her sink and be d -- mned. Hoist out the boat, was the next cry, the command of the Captain. The boat was hoisted out, and being to small to take any part of our baggage, we were obliged to leave it behind; indeed, so frightened was I, having never been at sea before, that I thought little of my baggage; my attention was confined to my person. The Jew's heart, on the contrary, was fixed on his treasure, upon his traveling box, which he was careful to take into the boat with him; but the Captain, (after I and the five seamen were in) endeavoring to prevent it, and the Jew laboring to secure it, such was the struggle between them, that in coming down the ship's side, they both fell into the sea, and had very nearly overset the boat. The Captain was unfortunately sucked under the vessel and we saw him no more; but the Jew was presently discovered on the surface of the water. D -- mn my liver, Jack, says one of the seamen, if there is n't Moses in the bull-rushes; (for he had long loose hair, and his face, part appearing above water, with the hair floating around it, favored the idea; but my distress was too great to smile at it.) He Is within reach, catch hold of his poll. Jack caught him by the hair, and raising his chin above water; as soon as the Israelite could recover breath to speak, he cried out. Vare is my baux? Vare is my baux? This so exasperated the fellow who held him, that he quitted his hold, with a Bl -- st your eyes, you son of a bitch, look for your box and be d -- mn'd, and the poor wretch sunk, and we saw him no more. We were now less in number by two, than when we quitted the vessel, and having the day before us, and the weather not so windy as it was, we flattered ourselves, we should get safe to land. In about four hours we saw land, and it gave us spirits; and another hour put us on shore at a little village on the coast of Northumberland, not a great way south of Berwick. I now found, instead of steering for Nova Scotia, the vessel I was in, and which sunk before we were a league from it, was a lobster smack, bound for Shetland, where his lordship meant to have transported me, and where I should not have readily got away.  MY comrades glad to find themselves on land, made the best of their way to Newcastle, in order to ship themselves on board some of the colliers, whereas I took up my abode at a public house in the village, determining to wait till I could have remittances from London; for I had brought nothing ashore with me, of any value but may watch, which I converted into money to answer the present exigence. I might, indeed, have told my tale to some of the gentlemen in the neighborhood, and by that means got some pecuniary relief; but as I wished to sit quiet for a few days, to recover from my fatigue and anxiety of mind, I thought it best to lay myself under as few obligations as possible. Before the sailors left me, I made some enquiry whether they knew any thing of their Captain or his connexions; they told me not, that they were shipped merely for the voyage and were strangers to him, till a few days before I came on board. All the information I could get was, that they had lain at anchor, on the spot where I found them, two days waiting for may arrival.
