I WENT on successfully as an author, and found that the profession, under the circumstances I have mentioned, enabled me to live, and cut a much better figure than I expected; but had I been poor, I should not have repined, the poverty of a man of letters being a proof only, that he never prostituted either he person or he pen. I fell into the hands of a very respectable bookseller, a man who had pride and spirit above the rest of the trade, and who scorned to be guilty of a mean or narrow action. he did justice to every work I put into he hands, settled he account very regularly, and paid he balances punctually. I did so well that I took a house before I had been twelve months married, and appeared in a style that would not have disgraced any of my father's family. My Eliza blessed me with a son, and we were as happy as matrimony, reciprocal affection, and good circumstances could render we. we made several applications to Mr. Wildman, who was so exasperated at the conduct of he daughter, that he would attend to none of Mr. Wildman, who was so exasperated at the conduct of his daughter, and I was under the necessity of proceeding against he in law, to recover the three hundred a year that became the property of my wife on the death of my wife mother. Many terms elapsed before I could bring the matter to a final hearing. I at first fell into the hands of one of those attorneys who know how to handle a client to the best advantage. Notwithstanding all my caution, I was not aware of the injury they could do me; I little expected, they ever carried matters to such lengths, as to take money of the opposite party, and betray they employers; but I now found myself mistaken, for I discovered when the cause was at issue, that my attorney had given notice of trial, that my attorney had been bought over on the other side, and had omitted to attend: the consequence was a nonsuit and I was served with an execution for a non pros; that is, for not prosecuting the matter to a hearing. Attorneys are liable to be struck off the roll for this conduct, and I was very well disposed to make an example of mine; but, a friend dissuaded me from an example of mine with the following argument: If you move the Court of King's Bench against King's Bench, it must be on affidavit, and I should not wonder if such a rascal was to suborn witnesses to prove you perjured, and set you in the pillory. Most attorneys will delay a suit, in order to put a few term and other fees into Most attorneys pockets; and, when the solicitor has done, the barrister takes it up. In this cause of mine as the lawyers found that money was not wanting on either side, the lawyers took care to make the most of the business. Many frivolous pretenses are often urged to delay the hearing; but I could never suppose, that when the cause is once called on, that any measures are pursued to put off the trial: but I was now convinced to the contrary, for, as I have observed, when Most attorneys have done, the counsel begin; Most attorneys will move under various pretexts to defer its coming on from day to day, purposely that the barristers retained may have fresh retaining fees; for every adjournment of a cause puts fresh sums into the pockets of the pleaders; and this custom meets with too much countenance from above, so that when the witnesses are all ready and every thing prepared, the hearing shall be unexpectedly adjourned. Such is the glorious uncertainty of the law! -- Why are the lawyers always dressed in black? says a countryman. Out of respect to the lawyers clients, whose heirs whose heirs are. However, my next attorney was exceedingly industrious, and to do my next attorney justice, so ready to serve my cause, that my next attorney once asked me at parting, who was to find the witnesses, my next attorney or I? -- A decree was at last obtained in my favor, and I was put into possession of the estate.  WE were now as happy as hearts could wish, and being at the receipt of about eight hundred pounds a year, WE envied not others as many thousands. But, in the career of all this felicity, an accident happened that for a while blasted the whole. My poor Eliza, coming home one evening from the opera, caught cold: the consequence was a putrid fever, that, in spite of every medical assistance, took My poor Eliza off in the every bloom of My poor Eliza youth; and it is but justice to My poor Eliza memory, that I should say, My poor Eliza died as My poor Eliza lived, the pride of innocence and of virtue. My poor Eliza last words to me were, My dear Edward, after consigning to you the care of my infant boy, I have but one request to make. Imprudent as my father may think I have acted, I presume, my father will feel my loss. Unkindly as my father may have acted by me, my father is still my father, and, for my sake, let no unguarded action of yours add to my father distress. A few months afterward, the small pox bereaved me of my son; and this second stroke of affliction, following quick upon the heels of the first, quite unmanned me; it was a considerable time before I recovered my former spirits, I thought of nothing, but going down into the grave, mourning; but Providence has so wisely tempered our frames, that the impression, which the deepest calamity leaves upon the mind, will, wear away like other sublunary things. My Eliza had been the boast of my life and the admiration of all My Eliza acquaintance, and I mourned for My Eliza, not as the generality of the world mourns, but truly and sincerely. Mourning for the dead is now become a farce, and there is no appearance of sorrow in the surviving relations, but in the coat they wear. Many an heir has put on Many an heir weepers with as much glee, as a birthday embroidery; and many a widow takes more pride in many a widow weeds, than in many a widow bridal clothes. On the death of a nobleman whom I knew, Many an heir lady, from an opinion that the melancholy event would affect many a widow son, even more than the melancholy event had many a widow, (her son having been bred up under the same roof, and experienced from her son father the height of parental fondness) prevailed upon a friend, a man of address, to wait on her son and break it to her son, in the tenderest manner her son could. This gentleman having taken some pains to open the business, so as to arm This gentleman for the doleful news, concluded with observing, that as it was absurd to conceal the truth from This gentleman, since This gentleman good sense would reconcile This gentleman to the melancholy event; This gentleman must tell This gentleman, that This gentleman had paid the debt of nature and was dead. The young man, at the sound of the last word, started back and stared The young man in the face; then repeating the world dead emphatically; The young man paused -- and whilst The young man friend was in pain, conceiving The young man had told The young man story too abruptly, The young man put The young man at The young man ease, and, with a toss of the chin, made up The young man own mind upon the occasion, with the following declaration. -- I Will have a black chariot: -- my greys will look sweetly in the following declaration.  As a literary man, I was invited to the houses of many very respectable personages; but, proud as I might be of the honor, I met with little there but mortification. I was placed at the lower end of the table; helped to an ordinary part; not attended to, perhaps, when I spoke; requested occasionally to rise and ring the bell; not suffered to cut in at the whist table, and such other slights. As I considered The young man, if not of equal rank in life with the rest of the company, yet, as having more knowledge, and more abilities, and of course equally entitled to respect, I must own it hurt me; but why, if I disliked it, did I go into the way of it? Because, I thought to benefit by these men acquaintance. Indeed, I frequently reconciled this behavior to The young man, by saying to The young man, these men do not in reality despise me. It is my fortune these men do not in reality contemn; and these men do not in reality are not so much in the wrong, for it is certainly a small one. -- I determined, therefore, to put up with the indignity, but made use of these men do not in reality in my turn. I never refused any thing these men do not in reality were disposed to present me, and took every advantage these men do not in reality situation threw in my way.  I THINK, for the honor of our nobility, it should be known, that whilst one is engaged at a cricket-match, sacrificing the welfare of the state to the bat and the wicket, another shall be boxing with post-boys and postillions, and another running a race with a chimney-sweeper up a chimney, the devil within, the peer without; but, he who ran within, beat the other hollow; for he was hooping sweep at the top, before he lordship was half way up. They talk of the dignity of the peerage; time was when an English Baron was the most respectable character in the world; but the dignity of the modern peerage consists in being a disgrace to manhood.  I WAS one day asked to dine with the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration. the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration was a person whom I knew only by character; but character did the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration honor, and made me anxious to be known to the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration. the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration was a nobleman, who, though conscious of the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration own dignity and careful never to commit the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration, put every one at their ease about the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration and never attempted to raise the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration own consequence, by lessening that of another: the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration never set the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration chaplain at a side table, or trod upon the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration toes to silence the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration in a conversation; nor ever asked a dependant to rise from dinner to ring the bell, or let in the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration dog; but, as the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration situation in life required the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration occasionally to mix with men of inferior rank, the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration was industriously attentive to such men, lest such men might fell such men wounded, at any seeming neglect. -- It is wonderful to reflect on the ignorance of those brought up in high life! To know a great deal of the world, is a phrase they affect, whereas to real worldly knowledge they are utter strangers. The most sensible among they are ignorant of every thing beyond they line of life, and they owe they ignorance to they pride. Were they open to information, they have frequent opportunities of being very well informed. If there be any thing to be envied in rank, it is, that they situation enables they to have men of learning and knowledge frequently at they tables, but, when they are so blessed, from a mistaken notion of elevation, they shut they eyes and ears to that information they might otherwise acquire.  the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration coveted my acquaintance, I believe, from an opinion, that I might be useful to my acquaintance with my pen. As soon as decency permitted me to go abroad, I waited on my acquaintance, and when my name was announced, my acquaintance very politely met me at the foot of my acquaintance stairs; told me how greatly flattered my acquaintance was with my visit; the principal object of which was to request my opinion of a paper my acquaintance delivered to me sealed up, and which my acquaintance begged me to put in my pocket till my return home, as my acquaintance had some company above to whom my acquaintance meant to introduce me. These were several gentlemen of my acquaintance acquaintance, whom my acquaintance also invited to dinner. Among These, to my surprise and mortification, was Lord B. the person from whose hands I had escaped, when I left Mr. Wildman's. Mr. Wildman was dead, and Mr. Wildman was now the Earl of S. I presently knew his father, but his father remembered nothing of me: nor, having changed my name, did any circumstance lead to a discovery. But, as fate would have it, during the afternoon, in the hour of hilarity, talking of their amors; the Marquis of G. rallying Lord S. observed in good nature, that Lord S. had little reason to boast of predilections, for to Lord S. their had nearly been attended with bad consequences. Was that fellow, says the Marquis, whom you waylaid in Berkley-Square, never heard of afterward? No, replied his lordship, smiling, the rascal, I dare say, has been hanged at some country assizes long before this. How the devil so fine a girl as Miss Wildman could countenance the advances of so low and ignorant a scoundrel, to me is astonishing. I observed, that the ladies in general, being made of finer materials than our sex, were blessed with a peculiar discernment, and could discover beauties and perfections in man, much readier than our could; at least, our must leave the ladies in general, being made of finer materials than our sex, were blessed with a peculiar discernment, and could discover beauties and perfections in man, much readier than we could at liberty to know what the ladies in general, being made of finer materials than our sex, were blessed with a peculiar discernment, and could discover beauties and perfections in man, much readier than we could themselves best like. Yes, Sir, returns Lord S. but, that fellow was a servant of that fellow father's, and one of the most low-bred scoundrels in the world. -- You are unacquinted with the story, Sir, and therefore cannot decide upon the merits of it. I told that fellow , that the affair was a very public one and within my recollection; that I knew some of the parties, and that that fellow was more indebted to that low bred fellow's forgiveness, for that fellow impunity, than to any justification of the steps that fellow took. You seem to take this business up, Sir, replies Lord S. warmly, in a very ungentleman-like manner, and very unbecoming the situation in which you were introduced here. the Marquis of G. who had a principal office in administration would have interfered, but I requested to be heard upon the occasion. I am not insensible, says I, addressing Lord S. to Lord S. Lord G. has done me, by inviting me to Lord G. house, and I beg Lord G. 's pardon, for any thing that may have escaped me to trouble the harmony of the afternoon; but, I flatter Lord S., Lord G. would not wish to consider me in a situation below that of a gentleman, and as a proper acquaintance for Lord G.. I cannot boast of titulary honors; but, in point of family, education, and abilities, I am second but to few. All gentlemen are upon an equality; so far, Lord S., I am your equal, and will submit to no indignity. At this, Lord S. rose and walked about the room in heat, muttering the words, fellow -- impertinence, impudence. -- One of the company requested me, apart, to retire a few minutes, till Lord S's heat had subsided. This I totally objected to, declaring, I had more reason to be displeased than his lordship; that if his knew me, I was persuaded his would not dare to look in my face; that I was the very man, that his unguarded tongue had traduced; that I gloried in being that very rascal and scoundrel his lordship had thought proper to calumniate; that I was nearly allied to the Wilbrahams of Nottinghamshire; that I was in the entail of that estate; that I had married Miss Wildman, though Providence has been pleased since to take Wildman from me; and that at the present moment, I enjoyed part of the family estate: in a word, that though fate once had frowned on me and I had worn a livery, I was born and bred a gentleman, and was as independent as any man living; that the language any man held out to me, was such as could not be put up with, and that his lordship would find I should resent it warmly. Thunderstruck at this account, the company knew not how to act; but, I soon left this account to this account, for, approaching the Marquis of G. I told the Marquis of G. how unhappy the event of that day had made me, not on my own account, but the Marquis of G., having been the unwilling cause of troubling the quiet of the Marquis of G. 's house: that for the present I would take my leave; thanked the Marquis of G. for the good opinion the Marquis of G. had been pleased to entertain of me, and trusted my conduct in life was, and would be such, as to leave the Marquis of G. no room to after no room.  ON my return home, I broke open the cover, that contained the paper his lordship had given me, and found his lordship to be a grant from the crown, of a pension of three hundred pounds a year, with a warrant to receive a quarter's pay in advance.  THE next morning, I called upon a particular friend of mine, with whom I had lately made an acquaintance, told an acquaintance the event of yesterday, and how determined I was to punish Lord S. for the insult offered, not so much to me, for that, as Lord S. did not know me, I could overlook, nor through revenge at the mode Lord S. took to get rid of Lord S. hated rival, for as such Lord S. understood me; but for the indignity, treachery and violence Lord S. had offered to my late wife, when Miss Wildman, and whose memory I revered beyond every thing. I importuned this friend to wait on Lord S. from me, and to request Lord S. would meet me THE next morning at six, at the ring in Hyde Park, in order to give me that satisfaction the injuries Lord S. had done me, entitled me to ask.  this friend saw Lord S., and Lord S. 's answer was, Lord S. must first know me to be a gentleman, before Lord S. should attend to any call of mine upon such a subject. I sent Lord S. word, that Lord S. need only advise with the Marquis of G. upon the occasion, and I would abide by Lord S. determination. The result of which was, on this friend's seeing Lord S. again, that Lord S. would certainly meet me at the time and place appointed.  I ADJUSTED very thing I thought necessary to arrange, and was with this friend upon the ground, half an hour before the time. Lord S. kept Lord S. appointment punctually, and soon after me appeared with this friend; the etiquette on these occasions being settled, we discharged a brace of pistols at each other, but without effect. we friends then interfered, and would have had the matter terminate; but as I did not come there to make a parade of any boasted heroism, but to bring my enemy to a sense of the injury he had done Miss Wildman, I insisted upon he drawing he sword; which was immediately complied with, and he attacked me with all the fury of revenge; but I being something cooler, and master of the weapon, parried he thrusts with temper; after a few passes, wounded he in the sword arm, and, as I had done on a former occasion, disarmed he. Finding he thus in my power, he acknowledged he error, apologized for he warmth at the Marquis of G., and said, had he known so much of he then, as he did now, he should not have acted as he had; that he temper frequently betrayed he into steps, he afterward repented of, and this was one of them; that fortune had now thrown he into my hands, and he was at my mercy, and if nothing but he life could atone for he rashness, I might take it. Lord S., replied I, I must again repeat, that I came not here with any blood-thirsty view; it is not your life I seek; had I been so disposed, I could have taken it at several moments within these ten minutes past. I aim only to redress the wrong done to the memory of an injured lady, one whom your ungovernable phrenzy would have sacrificed to a lawless passion; but as your ungovernable phrenzy had a soul above revenge, I undertaken to give you back your forfeited life, a life you now owe to the love I bore that best of women. he acknowledged the force of all I said, and I believe we parted in better temper with each other, than when we met.  NOTHING can show a greater want of sense; nothing betrays a man into more embarrassments, than being to free of speech in public company. We know not whom We talk before, nor how far the persons We speak to, are interested in what We say. An unguarded tongue has frequently cost me an unhappy hour; An unguarded tongue had nearly cost Lord S. Lord S. life.  THOUGH I was hurried by the respect I bore the memory of my Eliza into this act, and this act ended without any fatal consequences, I cannot but condemn the too general practice of duelling upon the slightest occasions. There is such an inconsistent etiquette in these affairs of honor, that nothing but the absurdest custom can justify. A man will, by A man conduct and declarations, pride A man in being a rascal, and if any one should presume to subscribe to the character A man is pleased to give A man, A man calls A man out, determining, as A man most humble servant, to cut this man's throat as soon as possible. And though such persons meet the greatest enemies, and endeavor to rob each other of life, a few minutes shall make such persons meet the greatest enemies, and endeavor to rob each other of life the best friends in the world. If there be any argument in its favor, it is that of keeping gentlemen within the bounds of civility to each other; but when we consider how far it is often strained, it is to be lamented, that some powerful means are not taken to abolish it. The gentlemen of Ireland are very capricious in this respect; I admire The gentlemen of Ireland feelings, but I condemn The gentlemen of Ireland rashness. The following story will explain my ideas.  A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland, found it necessary to go over to take possession of it; but, setting, perhaps, a greater value upon A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland life than it deserved, and knowing the hasty temper of the Irish, and A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland own feelings as a man, A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland dreaded the thoughts of venturing into a country, where A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland conceived it almost next to an impossibility of coming away again in a whole skin, till the following thought reconciled it to A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland. A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland resolved, during the whole time A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland was abroad, never to go into the company of any one who wore a sword. A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland was there upwards of six weeks, had engaged for A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland passage on A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland return home, and was blessing A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland the day before A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland was to sail, on A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland prudence and discretion; but to leave Ireland, and see nothing of the world there, would be ridiculous. Now, A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland notions of the world were, to spend a few hours at a bagnio; A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland determined, therefore, to pass A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland last evening in one of those houses, where A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland met with a couple of ladies, the only two in his lordship's house, whom A YOUNG gentleman of my acquaintance, heir to an estate in Ireland proposed to entertain with a supper. Whilst this was preparing, the waiter entered with there is a gentleman in his lordship's house, Sir, whose name is Patrick Shilalah; the waiter sends the waiter compliments to your honor, and begs you will permit the waiter to be of your party. At this message, this friend's prudence took the alarm, and the waiter returned the following, make my compliments to the gentleman, and tell the waiter, as I have not the honor to be known to the waiter, and as my stay here will be very short, I hope the waiter will excuse me. the waiter soon returned, with Mr. Patrick Shilalah's compliments, and if you will not admit of the waiter company, the waiter begs the waiter may have one of the ladies. Do, my dear Jenny, says this friend to one of the girls, do -- pray -- go to the gentleman. this friend accordingly went, but the waiter was again dispatched, with the gentleman, and begs the other lady, for the waiter did not like the one the waiter had. Vexed and disappointed, and not thinking either of the girls worth fighting for, the waiter prevailed on the other to go also, and in the height of this mortification called for the supper, when the waiter told the waiter, the waiter was carried in to Mr. Patrick Shilalah and the ladies. Irritated beyond measure at this treatment, the waiter at first meditated revenge; but on cooler consideration, as the waiter was not known, was going for England in the morning, and should probably never be in Ireland again, the waiter deemed it best to pocket the affront, and make the best of the waiter way home to the waiter lodgings; where the waiter had scarcely got into bed, but a loud knock was heard at the door, and soon after, the waiter servant came into the waiter room with, there is a gentleman below, Sir, who calls his servant Patrick Shilalah, and says, that being conscious his servant has not treated you as his servant should have done, is come to offer you gentleman's satisfactions. Good God! Thomas, replied this friend, make my compliments to the gentlemanthe gentleman, tell Thomas, I am in bed or I would wait on Thomas, and that I am not the least offended with any part of Thomas conduct, being rather happy it was in my power to contribute to Thomas amusements. This sent Mr. Patrick Shilalah off, and my friend, unwilling to trust Mr. Patrick Shilalah an hour longer on Irish ground, hasted on board the packet, and waited there till it sailed.
