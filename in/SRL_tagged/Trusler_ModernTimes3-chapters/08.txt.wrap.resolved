BY the time I had been at this place a week, I had such remittances from my banker as I stood in need of, and had heard from home, that all things were well. I then equipped myself with those necessaries I wanted, namely, a few shirts and a suit of clothes, and prepared to set off once more, took a post chaise for Nottinghamshire. Though anxious to call the Earl of S. to account for the treatment I had received, I thought it most prudent to pay a visit to my friend the vicar; and the reader may believe me, when I say, that I found myself less eager to take this journey now, than I was, when I left London on the same occasion; my expectations were balked by the event I have related, and my spirits were not so much upon the wing; howerer, I set out and reached York the first night.  THE theater being there open, I went to the play, and who should I meet with in the same box, but Biddy Slash'em, dressed out with a profusion of diamonds, in company with an old gentleman, whom I supposed to be her keeper. her was overjoyed to see me, and introduced me to Mr. Dupe, the gentleman with her, as the son of her father's brother, whom her had before represented as a clergyman of the first character and fortune. Mr. Dupe received me very cordially, and, when the play was over, begged to have the honor of my company to supper, having a house in the town. I accompanied them home in them carriage, and was requested whilst I continued at York, to sleep there. This gave me an opportunity of passing an hour or two alone with Miss Slash'em, Mr. Dupe being accustomed to ride out every morning before breakfast, upon a hard trotting horse, for the cure of a gouty complaint Mr. Dupe had in Mr. Dupe stomach. The Jew Doctor and Blacksmith in London, having by The Jew Doctor and Blacksmith in London machine to create muscular exercise, made such a regimen fashionable. his machine, I am told, is merely a board (on which the patient stands, holding by an iron) with springs under his machine, worked by an handwinch which raises and lowers his machine so quick, that in a small space of time, his machine throws the person on his machine into a violent perspiration, and gives the person on it all the advantages of great exercise, without muscular exertion: a trotting horse will answer the same purpose, if the rider can undergo the fatigue. During Mr. Dupe's morning ride, I had the happiness of a tete-a-tete in Biddy's chamber, and found Biddy as attached to me as ever. I gave Biddy some little account of my adventures since we parted; and Biddy in return, related to me the sequel of here is.  WHEN you left we, my dear Gabriel, says Biddy, at Winchester, we were preparing to remove to the Devizes; there I continued about three weeks, when Mr. Dupe, the gentleman I live with, seeing me in one of my principal characters in my dear Gabriel way from Bath to London, took a liking to me, and made me proposals to live with my dear Gabriel. These proving acceptable, I took leave of the company, quitted my employ, and came away with my dear Gabriel. my dear Gabriel has settled two hundred pounds a year on me, loads me with presents, and says my dear Gabriel will marry me if I prove with child.  And you, no doubt, says I try every means you can for I prove with child. Well if ever you are, I prove with child will be within nine months of this time. -- Being fond of music and admiring my voice, continued my voice, my dear Gabriel has procured me the best masters; and ill as I sung at Winchester, I am now reckoned the first private singer in England. It has been the means of introducing me into the best company; for, so affectedly fond are persons of fashion of music, that they will sacrifice every thing to the rage of it. The gentry in this part of the country, readily overlook my situation, for the sake of my voice, and I visit and am visited by every body round me. Nay, I assure you I give me great airs upon these occasions, and find the more box I take upon me, the more I am thought of. I never pay a visit, till I have first received one; nor does Mr. Dupe expect me. The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister, did The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister the honor to drink tea with The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister yesterday. The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister wished me to sing, and I sung, but I obliged The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister during the time I sung, to sit down upon the ground? And why so? says I, oh! -- I always do that, continued she, in rooms not adapted for music; and when I sing at any other houses but my own, where The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister have not a music room, I insist upon the window curtains being taken down, the capet removed, and all the company's sitting down upon the floor but me; for nothing flattens the sound of a voice more than drapery furniture, and a number of persons half filling a room. And do The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister submit to this? replied I, Certainly The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister do, says she, and The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister must, or I would not sing. The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister would half strip The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister if I required it, rather than the world should fancy, The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister have not the greatest penchant for music. I know The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister visit and receive me, merely for my singing, and that though The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister bear with my oddities, The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister only laugh at me when gone; this determines me to laugh in my turn, and as Mr. Dupe will not suffer me to receive any persents, I am determined The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister shall pay for The Duchess of D. and the Countess of R. her sister folly one way or other. Though I smiled at the conceit, I could not but agree with she, that of all follies the tonish or fashionable ones, are the most absurd. I Will tell you an anecdote, my dear Biddy, returned I, that will confirm my assertion. Among the many people I have mixed with since I left you, is the lady of Sir Peter Puncheon, a Creole, from Jamaica. Sir Peter had been formerly in trade, had afterward turned planter, and acquired a good fortune. Sir Peter lady being a woman of dash and spirit, persuaded Sir Peter to leave Jamaica and settle in England. They accordingly sold all off and came, and not having a soul to introduce They into that company His lady coveted, His lady fell upon the following plan which succeeded beyond His lady expectations. Having a large house in London well situated, His lady called for the red book, Commonly called the Court Calendar. and from a list His lady there picked out, and other information, sent cards of invitation to a concert and a ball, to all the rout-going men and women of rank, to the number of some hundreds, and such was the rage for going to this woman's house, that many who by accident were not invited made interest for a card; so that on the evening appointed, there was such a throng of coaches and chairs, that all the adjoining streets were full. His lady procured a very intelligent servant, acquainted with their names, to announce their as their arrived, His lady standing on the top of the stairs, with His lady husband, to receive their. In the early part of the evening appointed when their dropped in but thinly, His lady had leisure to receive their properly; and expressed how proud His lady was of the honor their did His lady; but in a very little time, their poured in so thick upon His lady, that it required three men below to announce three men, and would have required a register to have remembered three men names. It was a task beyond His lady reach, and His lady could only introduce three men to her husband in the lump, with a Baronet, my dear; two more Lords; a Red ribband, and so on. -- From this scheme His lady immediately became a woman of the ton, and His lady house, from that time, was the fashionable resort of the first people in town. the first people in town admired His lady invention, whilst the first people in town laughed at His lady impudence; but the first people in town continued to visit His lady notwithstanding: for the time of persons of fashion hang so much upon the first people in town hands, and the first people in town enjoy so little of what the rational world calls social and domestic society, that the first people in town would run to h --, I believe, if the black gentleman would open the black gentleman with a concert, a ball, or a card party. By this means His lady was readily known and received in the great world, and very soon procured her husband to be created a Baronet. This brought the first people in town to court, and as people devoid of elegance, idly suppose that richness of dress depends upon profusion, or an extra quantity of expensive attire; instead of appearing in two laced lappets, lady Puncheon was determined to have four. lady Puncheon so fell out, however, that four lappets to a head dress being contrary to etiquette, lady Puncheon was refused admittance, 'till Sir Peter set the matter right, by taking out a pair scizars and cutting off two of the first people in town. But as the two Sir Peter cut off were on one side, lady Puncheon became the laugh and ridicule of the whole drawing room.  BIDDY was delighted with this story and vowed BIDDY would put this story in practice as soon as BIDDY got to London. Do, says I, BIDDY, and I Will be bound you will have company enough. Character and connection is out of the question. Open this woman's house, and the business is done.  MR. Mr. Dupe soon after returned from Mr. Dupe and found us in Mr. Dupe bed chamber. It a little disconcerted us; but Mr. Dupe quickly put us at us ease, with, so, BIDDY, you would show your cousin my knotted bed. Shaking Mr. Dupe head at BIDDY, and chucking BIDDY under the chin. Ah, you little rogue, you are determined I shall not lose any credit that you can give me. Then addressing Mr. Dupe to me. I knotted the greatest part of that fringe me, Mr. Whatd'ye-call 'em (I cannot think of your name) and I am not ashamed to own it; it is better than galloping a whole county over after a fox, injuring one's tenants and running the chance of breaking one's neck. Come, me, walk down and see my improvements. I thanked me for me politeness to me; but told me, I must be going, for that, I had engagements of the first importance that called me into Nottinghamshire. Well, me, says me, then I Will leave you together -- you may have some little affair to enter into, that requires privacy. I beg, BIDDY, you will show your cousin all the civility you can.  I now took my leave of Miss Slash'em, promising to see my leave of Miss Slash'em again as soon as my leave of Miss Slash'em came to London.
