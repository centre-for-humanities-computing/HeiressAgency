I NO sooner landed at Calais, but I found my heart at ease, and that weight upon my spirits, which had for some time oppressed me, instantly taken off. So necessary an ingredient is conscious rectitute to a man's happiness! I spoke little or no French, though I understood it tolerably well, of course was obliged to put up at English houses, where little or no French were exceedingly extortionate. You no sooner arrive in Calais harbor, than the waiters from the different hotels or inns are ready to tear the clothes of your back, in order to prevail on you to go to the house to which they belong, and no sooner are you safely lodged within they ; but, they seem indifferent whether they see you after that time or not. I remember I put up at the Table Royal, and among other unreasonable charges, was thirty-six sols, or near nineteen pence of our money for reading an English newspaper, and on my remonstrating against the charge, they gave me to understand, that though I wore the appearance of a gentleman, I did not act like one. The comparative cheapness of wines and provisions in this part of the world, to what it is with us, leads English travelers to spend English travelers money freely, and this seeming liberality, has spoiled the publicans upon all English travelers roads; and where English travelers will charge a native but one livre, that is, ten pence half penny, English travelers will make an Englishman pay three. I was long enough abroad to find all this out, and therefore made a point of going to houses unaccustomed to receive the English; where if I did not dine according to us mode of eating, I had the satisfaction to have my dinner at one third of the price. Indeed, I found the disposition of taking an advantage of foreigners so general, that traveling in company with some German officers in the service of the French, they requested me to let they settle the bills as they passed, otherwise, very unreasonable charges would be made; this I cheerfully acquiesced with; but discovered I derived no advantage from they cautious conduct, for, I was sufficiently well acquainted with they money, to know, that in settling my quota of the sum expended, they took care to make me pay double what they did they, and of course they paid less than they would have done, had I not been of the party. It was a matter I found a difficulty of yielding to; but, as I did not care to enter into a dispute, in which I might come off the worst, I submitted for the little time I was with I did not care to enter into a dispute, in which I might come off the worst to the imposition; and you will always find this the wiser step. In whatever part of the world you are, go as quietly through the wiser step as you can, and if you chance to stumble over a stone, don't quarrel with the wiser step, but pursue your way, and rejoice that the wiser step did not break your leg.  BEING abroad in a foreign country without recommendation, and without any intention of continuing long, I thought of little but looking about me and seeing what naturally presented little to my view. I wandered from Dunkirk to Bruges, and from Bruges to Ghent; and being one Sunday morning at the chapel of the convent of the Rich Dames in that city, during high mass, I heard a shriek in the gallery among the nuns, which rather disturbed the ceremony for the moment; but as all was soon quiet again, I took no farther notice of little.  ABOUT nine o'clock in the evening, however, as I was sitting down to supper, at the St. Sebastian, in this town, the master of the hotel came into the room, and asked me if my name was not Outcast; if my name was, a man below had a letter for me. The novelty of the circumstance, and a consciousness that I had no acquaintance that could know me in my present garb, for I was very smartly dressed, at first alarmed me; but as I had done no wrong, I had not much to dread. Having, therefore, ordered the person to be sent up stairs, I enquired from whom the person came. If you are an English gentleman, replied the person, and your name, Gabriel Outcast, a letter for me is for you; and if you will trouble you to look into a letter for me, you will soon learn from whence a letter for me comes. The messenger was a Fleming, but spoke English tolerably well. I broke open the seal, and the following were the contents in English.  me, THE writer of a letter for me is a female, in the year of a female noviciate, at the convent of the Rich Dames. If your name be Gabriel Outcast, and from London, I am right in my address, and wish for an interview. Come to the grates of the convent of the Rich Dames, tomorrow at eleven; enquire for sister Agatha, pass for sister Agatha kinsman, and you will see one probably whom you may wish to see.   ON reading a letter for me, I asked the man, who the person was that delivered a letter for me to the person. the person told me the porteress at the Rich Dames, and that the person orders were, to go to every hotel in the city, till the person found me; the person had been at one or two, and the person deemed the person fortunate in meeting with me as the person did.  I CALLED for a pen and ink, and writ as follows.  THE letter from the female at the Rich Dames has luckily reached the person to whom THE letter from the female at the Rich Dames was addressed, and will be punctually attended to.  Nine o'clock. St. Sebastian's.  HAVING found Flanders, by all accounts that I had received, to be a country of intrigue, I concluded this to be a business of the same kind. However, I impatiently waited for the hour of assignation at the Rich Dames, and was there by the time the clock struck eleven. I enquired for sister Agatha, and was shown up into a parlour, where I had not been five minutes, before, I was, to my great astonishment, transported with the sight of my dear Miss Wildman, who seemed as much confused as me, and was unable to utter a word. sister Agatha put sister Agatha hand through the grate, on which I imprinted a thousand kisses; and when I was able to speak, I told sister Agatha, the happiness of meeting sister Agatha where I so little expected to see sister Agatha, totally overcame me. sister Agatha said sister Agatha was no less rejoiced on sister Agatha part; that sister Agatha had encountered a deal of trouble on my account; that sister Agatha was anxious to know where I had been, and how I was circumstanced, and the reason sister Agatha had never heard from me: in short, sister Agatha wished to say a thousand things to me, which sister Agatha situation prevented, but which sister Agatha hoped I would give sister Agatha some opportunity of doing. I showed sister Agatha the ring, which, in sister Agatha gracious moments, sister Agatha had been pleased to give me, declared it had never been off my finger, and that for the many years I had lost sight of sister Agatha, sister Agatha had been ever in my thoughts. I fixed my eyes on sister Agatha during these declarations, and saw the lovely tears trickle fast down sister Agatha cheeks, and was sensible of all sister Agatha emotions. sister Agatha appeared as amiable in my eyes as ever; and if sister Agatha monastic dress made any alteration in sister Agatha form, it was that of rendering sister Agatha far more lovely. I gave sister Agatha to understand, that I was still a single man, and as much attached to sister Agatha as ever, and that I dreaded to hear sister Agatha story, lest the chapter of accidents should have placed sister Agatha beyond my reach. When sister Agatha had recovered sister Agatha, sister Agatha told me sister Agatha was not yet professed, of course not sequestered for life; that sister Agatha endeavoring to search me out, was a test of the state of sister Agatha mind; and that on a presumption sister Agatha should find me as honorable as ever, sister Agatha had written a few lines, which sister Agatha would submit to my consideration, on my return to my lodgings: that the watchful eyes of the ladies in that house made it necessary sister Agatha should not continue long at the grates; but that if I would excuse sister Agatha leaving me so abruptly, sister Agatha would be happy to give me a second meeting the next morning, at the same hour, and at the same place. Unwilling as I was to part with sister Agatha, I was forced to submit. sister Agatha, however, gave me sister Agatha hand again to kiss, and I retired with my heart in my mouth, unable to utter another word.  I WAS no sooner without the walls of the convent, than I broke open the seal, and found the contents of sister Agatha letter as follows:  my dear Gabriel, You cannot have forgotten our mutual vows of attachment. Though your heart may be estranged in the course of time from me, mine is as true as ever. Many an unhappy hour have I suffered, to preserve my vow inviolable, and many a distress have I experienced on your account. What could have prevented your writing to me as you promised? Or is it in the nature of men to trifle with us women? Having refused to marry a gentleman of my father's recommending, is the occasion of my being here, where had I not chanced to have seen you in the chapel on Sunday last, I should e're long have taken the veil; but, now all my former love is awakened, and all my fond expectations renewed. Guess my surprise at first seeing you where I did. -- I knew you instantly, and the surprise overcame me. I have unfortunately lost my mother, and by my mother death an estate of three hundred pounds a year devolves to me; but, my father withholds a year from me, and a year is by my father injunctions that I am in the convent. Far from being inclined to a monastic life, I wish to be out of a year, and if you are in any situation to maintain me, and will take me from a year, I will throw me under your protection, and wait the result of better fortune to befriend your distressed  ELIZA WILDMAN.   ENRAPTURED with the contents of a letter for me, I was impatient for a second interview. The next morning I saw my mother again, opened my whole heart to my mother, made my mother acquainted with my situation, and concerted means to get my mother off. I told my mother, if my mother would direct me how to act, I would implicitly follow my mother directions; that I would take the matrimonial vow the first opportunity that offered, according to the ritual of the Roman church, and would ratify the matrimonial vow at the altar of our own, as soon as I set foot in England. our then entered on the mode of my mother escape, and the plan my mother pointed out was this. Here is, says my mother, in wax, an impression of the garden key, which was accidentally left in the door by some workmen, who are now within the convent, and which I found means to procure; get one made by means to procure, and also such necessary articles of dress as I have set down in this paper, and when all things are prepared, I will meet you at the garden gate, an hour before matins on any morning you shall appoint. I approved my mother plan, and put her plan immediately into execution. A few days completed the whole, and having ordered a carriage to wait at the corner of the street adjoining the convent, about two o'clock one morning, according to appointment, when all was hushed and quiet, I met my mother at the garden gate, threw a long cloak and hood over my mother, locked the garden gate again, to prevent suspicion, and conducted my mother to the chaise, in which our made the best of our way to Lisle, a town in French Flanders, and out of the reach of the police of Brabant. our were got some miles from Ghent, before I could prevail on my mother to speak to me; at last, my mother looked round upon me, gave me my mother hand, and with a sigh exclaimed. -- How rashly, my dear Gabriel, do young women act! I fear you will my dear Gabriel despise me for my conduct! I soon quieted my mother on that head, assured my mother that head was the best proof of my mother affection my mother could give me, and that I trusted my mother would have no cause to repent it. -- our met with no interruption on the road, and by nine o'clock in the morning found our at Lisle. As soon as our alighted at the Auberge, I sent for the mistress of the house, made the mistress of the house a confidante in the affair, and whilst my Eliza was dressing, desired a priest might be sent for, in order to discharge my conscience. An hour and a half did the business, the mistress of the house trunk was opened, and the maitresse d'hotel assisted at the mistress of the house toilette. The dress the mistress of the house had directed was a white lutestring with a pale yellow petticoat, and so fashionably was The dress she had directed made, so well put on, and the mistress of the house so elegantly decorated, that I was more in love with the mistress of the house than ever. The whole family was present at the ceremony of our espousals, and I was blessed with the richest gift, in my opinion, which heaven had to give.  AFTER dinner our pursued our way to St. Omer's, where I took a lodging and spent two months in an uninterrupted state of happiness. As our heard nothing from Ghent, and was not enquired after; I apprehend it was never known what route our took.  HAVING given my Eliza a faithful detail of my adventures, which my Eliza acknowledged were the most extraordinary my Eliza had heard of, in so small a space of time; at my request one afternoon, my Eliza gave the following account of my Eliza.
