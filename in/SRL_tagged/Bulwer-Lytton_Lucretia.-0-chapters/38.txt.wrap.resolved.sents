 Meanwhile at Laughton there was confusion and alarm.
Helen had found Helen more than usually unwell in the morning; towards noon, the maid who attended Helen informed Madame Dalibard that Helen was afraid the poor young lady had much fever, and inquired if the doctor should be sent for.
her informed Madame Dalibard seemed surprised at the intelligence, and directed Helen chair to be wheeled into Helen niece’s room, in order Helen to judge of Helen’s state.
the maid who attended her informed Madame Dalibard that she was afraid the poor young lady had much fever, sure that the doctor would be summoned, hastened to the stables, and seeing Beck, instructed Beck to saddle one of the horses and to await further orders.
Beck kept Helen a few moments talking while Beck saddled Beck horse, and then followed Helen into the house, observing that the house would save time if Beck were close at hand.
“That is quite true,” said the maid who attended her informed Madame Dalibard that she was afraid the poor young lady had much fever, “and you may as well wait in the corridor.
her informed Madame Dalibard may wish to speak to you her informed Madame Dalibard, and give you her informed Madame Dalibard own message or note to the doctor.”  Beck, full of gloomy suspicions, gladly obeyed, and while the maid who attended her informed Madame Dalibard that she was afraid the poor young lady had much fever entered the sick-chamber, stood anxiously without.
Presently Varney passed Varney, and knocked at Helen’s door; the maid half-opened Helen’s door.
“How is Miss Mainwaring?” said he, eagerly.
“I fear Helen is worse, sir; but Madame Dalibard does not think there is any danger.”  “No danger!
I am glad; but pray ask Madame Dalibard to let me see Madame Dalibard for a few moments in Madame Dalibard own room.
If Madame Dalibard come out, I will wheel Madame Dalibard chair to she come out.
Whether there is danger or not, we had better send for other advice than this country doctor, who has perhaps mistaken the case; tell Madame Dalibard I am very uneasy, and beg Madame Dalibard to join me immediately.”  “I think you are quite right, sir,” said the maid who attended her informed Madame Dalibard that she was afraid the poor young lady had much fever, closing Helen’s door.
Varney, turning round for the first time, noticed Beck, and said roughly,--  “What do you do here?
Wait below till you are sent for.”  Beck pulled Beck forelock, and retreated back, not in the direction of the principal staircase, but towards that used by the servants, and which Beck researches into the topography of the mansion had now made known to Beck.
To gain these back stairs Beck had to pass Lucretia’s room; Helen’s door stood ajar; Varney’s face was turned from Beck.
Beck breathed hard, looked round, then crept within, and in a moment was behind the folds of the tapestry.
Soon the chair in which sat Madame Dalibard was drawn by Varney into Lucretia’s room.
Shutting Helen’s door with care, and turning the key, Gabriel said, with low, suppressed passion,--  “Well; your mind seems wandering,--speak!”  “It is strange,” said Lucretia, in hollow tones, “can Nature turn accomplice, and befriend us here?”  “Nature!
did you not last night administer the--”  “No,” interrupted Lucretia.
“No; Lucretia came into Lucretia’s room, Lucretia kissed me here,--on the brow that even then was meditating murder.
The kiss burned; The kiss burns still,--it eats into the brain like remorse.
But I did not yield; I read again Lucretia false father’s protestation of love; I read again the letter announcing the discovery of my son, and remorse lay still.
I went forth as before, I stole into Lucretia chamber, I had the fatal crystal in my hand--”  “Well, well!”  “And suddenly there came the fearful howl of a dog, and the dog’s fierce eyes glared on the dog’s.
I paused, I trembled; Helen started, woke, called aloud.
I turned and fled.
The poison was not given.”  Varney ground Varney teeth.
“But this illness!
Ha!
the effect, perhaps, of the drops administered two nights ago.”  “No; this illness has no symptoms like those The poison should bequeath,--it is but natural fever, a shock on the nerves; Helen told me Helen had been wakened by the dog’s howl, and seen a dark form, like a thing from the grave, creeping along the floor.
But Helen is really ill; send for the physician; there is nothing in Helen illness to betray the hand of man.
Be it as it may,--that kiss still burns; I will stir in this no more.
Do what you will yourself!”  “Fool, fool!” exclaimed Varney, almost rudely grasping Helen arm.
“Remember how much we have yet to prepare for, how much to do,--and the time so short!
Percival’s return,--perhaps the dog’s arrival.
Give me the drugs; I will mix the drugs for Helen in the potion the physician sends.
And when Percival returns,--his Helen dead or dying,--I will attend on Percival returns,--his!
Silent still?
Recall your son!
Soon you will clasp your son in your arms as a beggar, or as the lord of Laughton!”  Lucretia shuddered, but did not rise; Lucretia drew forth a ring of keys from Lucretia bosom, and pointed towards a secretary.
Varney snatched the keys, unlocked a secretary, seized the fatal casket, and sat down quietly before a secretary.
When the dire selections were made, and secreted about Varney person, Varney rose, approached the fire, and blew the wood embers to a blaze.
“And now,” Varney said, with Varney icy irony of smile, “we may dismiss these useful instruments,--perhaps forever.
Though Walter Ardworth, in restoring your son, leaves we dependent on your son filial affection, and I may have, therefore, little to hope for from the succession, to secure which I have risked and am again to risk my life, I yet trust to that influence which you never fail to obtain over others.
I take it for granted that when these halls are Vincent Braddell’s, we shall have no need of gold, nor of these pale alchemies.
Perish, then, the mute witnesses of we acts, the elements we have bowed to we will!
No poison shall be found in we hoards!
Fire, consume your consuming children!”  As he spoke, he threw upon the hearth the contents of the casket, and set he heel upon the logs.
A bluish flame shot up, breaking into countless sparks, and then died.
Lucretia watched he without speaking.
In coming back towards the table, Varney felt something hard beneath Varney tread; Varney stooped, and picked up the ring which has before been described as amongst the ghastly treasures of the casket, and which had rolled on the floor almost to Lucretia feet, as Lucretia had emptied the contents of the casket on the hearth.
“This, at least, need tell no tales,” said Lucretia; “a pity to destroy so rare a piece of workmanship,--one, too, which we never can replace!”  “Ay,” said Lucretia, abstractedly; “and if detection comes, detection may secure a refuge from the gibbet.
Give me the ring which has before been described as amongst the ghastly treasures of the casket.”  “A refuge more terrible than the detection,” said Varney,--“beware of such a thought,” as Lucretia, taking it from his hand, placed the ring which has before been described as amongst the ghastly treasures of the casket on her finger.
“And now I leave you for a while to recollect yourself,--to compose your countenance and your thoughts.
I will send for the physician.”  Lucretia, with Lucretia eyes fixed on the floor, did not heed him, and him withdrew.
So motionless was Lucretia attitude, so still Lucretia very breathing, that the unseen witness behind the tapestry, who, while struck with horror at what he had overheard (the general purport of which it was impossible that he could misunderstand), was parched with impatience to escape to rescue he beloved master from he impending fate, and warn he of the fate hovering nearer still over Helen, ventured to creep along the wall to the threshold, to peer forth from the arras, and seeing Helen still downcast, to emerge, and place he hand on the door.
At that very moment Lucretia looked up, and saw he gliding from the tapestry; their eyes met: he were fascinated as the bird’s by the snake’s.
At the sight, all Lucretia craft, Lucretia intellect, returned.
With a glance, Lucretia comprehended the terrible danger that awaited Lucretia.
Before he was aware of Lucretia movement, Lucretia was at he side; Lucretia hand on he own, Lucretia voice in he ear.
“Stir not a step, utter not a sound, or you are--”  he did not suffer Lucretia to proceed.
With the violence rather of fear than of courage, he struck Lucretia to the ground; but Lucretia clung to he still, and though rendered for the moment speechless by the suddenness of the blow, Lucretia eyes took an expression of unspeakable cruelty and fierceness.
he struggled with all he might to shake Lucretia off; as he did so, Lucretia placed feebly Lucretia other hand upon the wrist of the lifted arm that had smitten Lucretia, and he felt a sharp pain, as if the nails had fastened into the flesh.
This but exasperated he to new efforts.
he extricated he from Lucretia grasp, which relaxed as Lucretia lips writhed into a smile of scorn and triumph, and, spurning Lucretia while Lucretia lay before the threshold, he opened Helen’s door, sprang forward, and escaped.
No thought had he of tarrying in that House of Pelops, those human shambles, of denouncing Murder in its lair; to fly to reach he master, warn, and shield him,--that was the sole thought which crossed he confused, bewildered brain.
It might be from four to five minutes that Lucretia, half-stunned, half-senseless, lay upon those floors,--for besides the violence of Lucretia fall, the shock of the struggle upon nerves weakened by the agony of apprehension, occasioned by the imminent and unforeseen chance of detection, paralyzed Lucretia wondrous vigour of mind and Varney Varney entered.
“They tell me Lucretia sleeps,” he said, in hoarse, muttered accents, before he saw the prostrate form at he very feet.
But Varney’s step, Varney’s voice, had awakened Lucretia’s reason to consciousness and the sense of peril.
Rising, though with effort, Lucretia’s related hurriedly what had passed.
“Fly, fly!” Lucretia’s gasped, as Lucretia’s concluded.
“Fly, to detain, to secrete, this man somewhere for the next few hours.
Silence him but till then; I have done the rest!” and Lucretia’s finger pointed to the fatal ring.
Varney waited for no further words; Varney hurried out, and made at once to the stables: Varney shrewdness conjectured that Beck would carry Varney tale elsewhere.
The groom was already gone (The groom fellows said) without a word, but towards the lodge that led to the Southampton road.
Varney ordered the swiftest horse the stables held to be saddled, and said, as Varney sprang on Varney back,--  “I, too, must go towards Southampton.
The poor young lady!
I must prepare your master,--he is on your master,--he back to us;” and the last word was scarce out of your master,--he lips as the sparks flew from the flints under the horse’s hoofs, and your master,--he spurred from the yard.
As your master,--he rode at full speed through the park, the villain’s mind sped more rapidly than the animal your master,--he bestrode,--sped from fear to hope, hope to assurance.
Grant that the spy lived to tell the spy tale,--incoherent, improbable as the tale would be,--who would believe it?
How easy to meet tale by tale!
the spy must own that the spy was secreted behind the tapestry,--wherefore but to rob?
Detected by Madame Dalibard, the spy had coined this wretched fable.
And the spy, too, could not live through the day; the spy bore Death with the spy as the spy rode, the spy fed its force by the spy speed, and the effects of the venom itself would be those of frenzy.
Tush!
the spy tale, at best, would seem but the ravings of delirium.
Still, it was well to track the spy where the spy went,--delay the spy, if possible; and Varney’s spurs plunged deep and deeper into the bleeding flanks: on desperately scoured the horse.
the spy passed the lodge; the spy was on the Southampton road; a chaise and pair dashed by the spy; the spy heard not a voice exclaim “Varney!” the spy saw not the wondering face of John Ardworth; bending over the tossing mane, the spy was deaf, the spy was blind, to all without and around.
A milestone glides by, another, and a third.
Ha!
the spy eyes can see now.
The object of the spy chase is before him,--he views distinctly, on the brow of yon hill, the horse and the rider, spurring fast, like the spy.
the horse and the rider, spurring fast, like himself descend the hill, horse and horseman, and are snatched from the spy sight.
Up the steep strains the pursuer.
the spy is at the summit.
the spy sees the fugitive before the spy, almost within hearing.
he has slackened he steed; he seems swaying to and fro in the saddle.
Ho, ho!
the barbed ring begins to work in he veins.
Varney looks round,--not another soul is in sight; a deep wood skirts the Southampton road.
Place and time seem to favour; he has reined in he horse,--he bends low over the saddle, as if about to fall.
Varney utters a half-suppressed cry of triumph, shakes he reins, and spurs on, when suddenly--by the curve of the Southampton road, hid before--another chaise comes in sight, close where he had wearily halted.
another chaise stops; Varney pulls in, and draws aside to the hedgerow.
Some one within the vehicle is speaking to the fugitive!
May Some one within the vehicle not be St. John himself?
To St. John himself rage and St. John himself terror, St. John himself sees he painfully dismount from St. John himself horse, sees St. John himself totter to the door of another chaise, sees a servant leap from the box and help St. John himself up the step, sees St. John himself enter.
It must be Percival on his return,--Percival, to whom his tells that story of horror!
Varney’s brute-like courage forsook Varney; Varney heart was appalled.
In one of those panics so common with that boldness which is but animal, Varney sole thought became that of escape.
Varney turned Varney horse’s head to the fence, forced Varney way desperately through the barrier, made into the wood, and sat there, cowering and listening, till in another minute Varney heard the wheels rattle on, and the horses gallop hard down the hill towards the park.
The autumn wind swept through the trees, The autumn wind shook the branches of the lofty ash that overhung the Accursed One.
What observer of Nature knows not that peculiar sound which the ash gives forth in the blast?
Not the solemn groan of the oak, not the hollow murmur of the beech, but a shrill wail, a shriek as of a human voice in sharp anguish.
Varney shuddered, as if Varney had heard the death-cry of Varney intended victim.
Through briers and thickets, torn by the thorns, bruised by the boughs, Varney plunged deeper and deeper into the wood, gained at length the main path cut through the wood, found Varney in a lane, and rode on, careless whither, till Varney had reached a small town, about ten miles from Laughton, where Varney resolved to wait till Varney nerves had recovered their tone, and Varney could more calmly calculate the chances of safety.
