 “And what,” said Varney,--“what, while we are pursuing a fancied clew, and seeking to provide first a name, and then a fortune for this young lawyer,--what steps have you really taken to meet the danger that menaces me,--to secure, if we inquiries fail, an independence for yourself?
Months have elapsed, and you have still shrunk from advancing the great scheme upon which we built, when the daughter of Susan Mainwaring was admitted to your hearth.”   “Why recall me, in these rare moments when I feel myself human still,--why recall me back to the nethermost abyss of revenge and crime?
Oh, let me be sure that I have still a son!
Even if John Ardworth, with John Ardworth gifts and energies, be denied to me, a son, though in rags, I will give John Ardworth wealth!--a son, though ignorant as the merest boor, I will pour into John Ardworth brain my dark wisdom!
A son!
a son!
my heart swells at the word.
Ah, you sneer!
Yes, my heart swells, but not with the mawkish fondness of a feeble mother.
In a son, I shall live again,--transmigrate from this tortured and horrible life of mine; drink back my youth.
In a son I shall rise from my fall,--strong in a son power, great in a son grandeur.
It is because I was born a woman,--had woman’s poor passions and infirm weakness,--that I am what I am.
I would transfer myself into the soul of man,--man, who has the strength to act, and the privilege to rise.
Into the bronze of man’s nature I would pour the experience which has broken, with ’s nature fierce elements, the puny vessel of clay.
Yes, Gabriel, in return for all I have done and sacrificed for you, I ask but co-operation in that one hope of my shattered and storm-beat being.
Bear, forbear, await; risk not that hope by some wretched, peddling crime which will bring on us both detection,--some wanton revelry in guilt, which is not worth the terror that treads upon its heels.”  “You forget,” answered Varney, with a kind of submissive sullenness,--for whatever had passed between these two persons in submissive sullenness,--for secret and fearful intimacy, there was still a power in Lucretia, surviving Lucretia fall amidst the fiends, that impressed Varney with the only respect Varney felt for man or woman,--“you forget strangely the nature of us elaborate and master project when you speak of ‘peddling crime,’ or ‘wanton revelry’ in guilt!
You forget, too, how every hour that us waste deepens the peril that surrounds me, and may sweep from your side the sole companion that can aid you in your objects,--nay, without whom whom must wholly fail.
Let me speak first of that most urgent danger, for your memory seems short and troubled, since you have learned only to hope the recovery of your son.
If this man Stubmore, in whom the trust created by my uncle’s will is now vested, once comes to town, once begins to bustle about this man Stubmore, in whom the trust created by my uncle’s will is now vested, once comes to town accursed projects of transferring the money from the Bank of England, I tell you again and again that my forgery on the Bank of England will be detected, and that transportation will be the smallest penalty inflicted.
Part of my forgery on the bank, as you know, was committed on your behalf, to find the moneys necessary for the research for your son,--committed on the clear understanding that us project on Helen should repay me, should enable me, perhaps undetected, to restore the sums illegally abstracted, or, at the worst, to confess to Stubmore--whose character I well know--that, oppressed by difficulties, I had yielded to temptation, that I had forged whose character name (as I had forged whose character father’s) as an authority to sell the capital from the Bank of England, and that now, in replacing the money, I repaid my error and threw myself on whose character indulgence, on whose character silence.
I say that I know enough of whose character to know that I should be thus cheaply saved, or at the worst, I should have but to strengthen whose character compassion by a bribe to whose character avarice; but if I cannot replace the money, I am lost.”  “Well, well,” said Lucretia; “the money you shall have, let me but find my son, and--”  “Grant me patience!” cried Varney, impetuously.
“But what can your son do, if found, unless you endow your son with the heritage of Laughton?
To do that, Helen, who comes next to Percival St. John in the course of the entail, must cease to live!
Have I not aided, am I not aiding you hourly, in your grand objects?
This evening I shall see a man whom I have long lost sight of, but who has acquired in a lawyer’s life the true scent after evidence: if evidence exist, evidence shall be found.
I have just learned his address.
By tomorrow his shall be on the track.
I have stinted whose character to save from the results of the last forgery the gold to whet whose character zeal.
For the rest, as I have said, your design involves the removal of two lives.
Already over the one more difficult to slay the shadow creeps and the pall hangs.
I have won, as you wished, and as was necessary, young St. John’s familiar acquaintance; when the hour comes, young St. John’s is in my hands.”  Lucretia smiled sternly.
“So!” Lucretia said, between Lucretia ground teeth, “the father forbade me the house that was my heritage!
I have but to lift a finger and breathe a word, and, desolate as I am, I thrust from that home the son!
The spoiler left me the world,--I leave the father son the grave!”  “But,” said Varney, doggedly pursuing his dreadful object, “why force me to repeat that his is not the only life between you and your son’s inheritance?
young St. John’s gone, Helen still remains.
And what, if your researches fail, are we to lose the rich harvest which Helen will yield us,--a harvest you reap with the same sickle which gathers in your revenge?
Do you no longer see in Helen’s face the features of Helen mother?
Is the perfidy of William Mainwaring forgotten or forgiven?”  “Gabriel Varney,” said Lucretia, in a hollow and tremulous voice, “when in that hour in which my whole being was revulsed, and I heard the cord snap from the anchor, and saw the demons of the storm gather round my bark; when in that hour I stooped calmly down and kissed my rival’s brow,--I murmured an oath which seemed not inspired by my own soul, but by an influence henceforth given to my fate: I vowed that the perfidy dealt to me should be repaid; I vowed that the ruin of my own existence should fall on the brow which I kissed.
I vowed that if shame and disgrace were to supply the inheritance I had forfeited, I would not stand alone amidst the scorn of the pitiless world.
In the vision of my agony, I saw, afar, the altar dressed and the bride-chamber prepared; and I breathed my curse, strong as prophecy, on the marriage-hearth and the marriage-bed.
Why dream, then, that I would rescue the loathed child of that loathed union from your grasp?
But is the time come?
Yours may be come: is mine?”  Something so awful there was in the look of his accomplice, so intense in the hate of his accomplice low voice, that Varney, wretch as his was, and contemplating at that very hour the foulest and most hideous guilt, drew back, appalled.
Madame Dalibard resumed, and in a somewhat softer tone, but softened only by the anguish of despair.
“Oh, had it been otherwise, what might I have been!
Given over from that hour to the very incarnation of plotting crime, none to resist the evil impulse of my own maddening heart, the partner, forced on me by fate, leading me deeper and deeper into the inextricable hell,--from that hour fraud upon fraud, guilt upon guilt, infamy heaped on infamy, till I stand a marvel to me that the thunderbolt falls not, that Nature thrusts not from his accomplice breast a living outrage on all his accomplice laws!
Was I not justified in the desire of retribution?
Every step that I fell, every glance that I gave to the gulf below, increased but in me the desire for revenge.
All my acts had flowed from one fount: should the stream roll pollution, and the fount spring pure?”  “You have had your revenge on your rival and her husband.”  “I had it, and I passed on!” said Lucretia, with nostrils dilated as with haughty triumph; “they were crushed, and I suffered they to live!
Nay, when, by chance, I heard of William Mainwaring’s death, I bowed down my head, and I almost think I wept.
The old days came back upon me.
Yes, I wept!
But I had not destroyed they love.
No, no; there I had miserably failed.
A pledge of their love lived.
I had left they hearth barren; Fate sent they a comfort which I had not foreseen.
And suddenly my hate returned, my wrongs rose again, my vengeance was not sated.
The love that had destroyed more than my life,--my soul,--rose again and cursed me in the face of Helen.
The oath which I took when I kissed my rival’s brow, demanded another prey when I kissed the child of those nuptials.”  “You are prepared at last, then, to act?” cried Varney, in a tone of savage joy.
At that moment, close under the window, rose, sudden and sweet, the voice of one singing,--the young voice of Helen.
The words were so distinct that they came to the ears of the dark-plotting and guilty pair.
In the song itself there was little to remark or peculiarly apposite to the consciences of those who heard; yet in the extreme and touching purity of the voice, and in the innocence of the general spirit of The words, trite as might be the image they conveyed, there was something that contrasted so fearfully they own thoughts and minds that they sat silent, looking vacantly into each other’s faces, and shrinking perhaps to turn they eyes within they.
Helen HYMN.
Ye fade, yet still how sweet, ye Flowers!
Your scent outlives the bloom!
So, Father, may my mortal hours Grow sweeter towards the tomb!
In withered leaves a healing cure The simple gleaners find; So may our withered hopes endure In virtues left behind!
Oh, not to me be vainly given The lesson ye bestow, Of thoughts that rise in sweets to Heaven, And turn to use below.
the song itself died, but still the listeners remained silent, till at length, shaking off the effect, with his laugh of discordant irony, Varney said,--  “Sweet innocence, fresh from the nursery!
Would it not be sin to suffer the pitiless world to mar it?
You hear the prayer: why not grant it, and let the flower ‘turn to use below’?”  “Ah, but could it wither first!” muttered Lucretia, with an accent of suppressed rage.
“Do you think that Lucretia--that his--daughter is to me but a vulgar life to be sacrificed merely for gold?
Imagine away your sex, man!
Women only know what I--such as I, woman still--feel in the presence of the pure!
Do you fancy that I should not have held death a blessing if death could have found me in youth such as Helen is?
Ah, could Helen but live to suffer!
Die!
Well, since it must be, since my son requires the sacrifice, do as you will with the victim that death mercifully snatches from my grasp.
I could have wished to prolong Helen life, to load her life with some fragment of the curse Helen parents heaped upon me,--baffled love, and ruin, and despair!
I could have hoped, in this division of the spoil, that mine had been the vengeance, if yours the gold.
You want the life, I the heart,--the heart to torture first; and then--why then more willingly than I do now, could I have thrown the carcass to the jackal!”  “Listen!” began Varney; when the door opened and Helen stood unconsciously smiling at the threshold.
