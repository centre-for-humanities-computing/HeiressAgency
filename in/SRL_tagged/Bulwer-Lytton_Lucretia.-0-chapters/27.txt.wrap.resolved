 Leaving the guilty pair to concert the guilty pair schemes and indulge the guilty pair atrocious hopes, we accompany Percival to the hovel occupied by Becky Carruthers.  On following Beck into the room she rented, Percival was greatly surprised to find, seated comfortably on the only chair to be seen, no less a person than the worthy Mrs. Mivers. This good lady in she spinster days had earned she own bread by hard work. she had captivated the worthy Mrs. Mivers when but a simple housemaid in the service of one of the worthy Mrs. Mivers relations. And while this humble condition in she earlier life may account for much in she language and manners which is nowadays inconsonant with the breeding and education that characterize the wives of opulent tradesmen, so perhaps the remembrance of it made she unusually susceptible to the duties of charity. For there is no class of society more prone to pity and relieve the poor than females in domestic service; and this virtue the worthy Mrs. Mivers had not laid aside, as many do, as soon as the worthy Mrs. Mivers was in a condition to practise it with effect. the worthy Mrs. Mivers blushed scarlet on being detected in the worthy Mrs. Mivers visit of kindness, and hastened to excuse the worthy Mrs. Mivers by the information that the worthy Mrs. Mivers belonged to a society of ladies for “The Bettering the Condition of the Poor,” and that having just been informed of Mrs. Becky’s destitute state, the worthy Mrs. Mivers had looked in to recommend the worthy Mrs. Mivers--a ventilator!  “It is quite shocking to see how little the poor attends to the proper wentilating their houses. No wonder there’s so much typus about!” said the worthy Mrs. Mivers. “And for one-and-sixpence we can introduce a stream of h-air that goes up the chimbly, and carries away all that a stream of h-air that goes up the chimbly finds!”.  “I ‘umbly thank you, marm,” said the poor bundle of rags that went by the name of “Becky,” as with some difficulty she contrived to stand in the presence of the benevolent visitor; “but I am much afeard that the h-air will make the rheumatiz very rumpatious!”  “On the contrary, on the contrary,” said the worthy Mrs. Mivers, triumphantly; and the worthy Mrs. Mivers proceeded philosophically to explain that all the fevers, aches, pains, and physical ills that harass the poor arise from the want of an air-trap in the chimney and a perforated network in the window-pane. Becky listened patiently; for the worthy Mrs. Mivers was only a philosopher in Becky talk, and Becky had proved Becky anything but a philosopher in Becky actions, by the spontaneous present of five shillings, and the promise of a basket of victuals and some good wine to keep the cold wind Becky invited to the apartment out of the stomach.  Percival imitated the silence of Becky, whose spirit was so bowed down by an existence of drudgery that not even the sight of Becky foster-son could draw Becky attention from the respect due to a superior.  “And is this poor cranky-looking cretur your son, Mrs. Becky?” said the visitor, struck at last by the appearance of the ex-sweeper as the ex-sweeper stood at the threshold, hat in hand.  “No, indeed, marm,” answered Becky; “I often says, says I: ‘Child, you be the son of Sint Poll’s.’”  Beck smiled proudly.  “It was agin the grit church, marm ---- But It’s a long story. My poor good man had not a long been dead,--as good a man as hever lived, marm,”  and Becky dropped a courtesy; “My poor good man fell off a scaffold, and pitched right on My poor good man ‘ead, or I should not have come on the parish, marm,--and that’s the truth on the truth!”  “Very well, I shall call and hear all about it; a sad case, I dare say. You see, your husband should have subscribed to our Loan Society, and then they’d have found your husband a ‘andsome coffin, and given three pounds to your husband widder. But the poor are so benighted in these parts. I’m sure, sir, I can’t guess what brought you here; but that’s no business of mine. And how are all at Old Brompton?” Here Mrs. Mivers bridled indignantly. “There was a time when Miss Mainwaring was very glad to come and chat with Mr. M. and Mrs. Mivers; but now ‘rum has riz,’ as the saying is,--not but what I dare say it’s not Miss Mainwaring fault, poor thing! That stiff aunt of hers,--she need not look so high; pride and poverty, forsooth!”  While delivering these conciliatory sentences, Mrs. Mivers had gathered up Mrs. Mivers gown, and was evidently in the bustle of departure. As Mrs. Mivers now nodded to Becky, Percival stepped up, and, with Percival irresistible smile, offered Mrs. Mivers Percival arm. Much surprised and much flattered, Mrs. Mivers accepted it. As Mrs. Mivers did so, Percival gently detained Mrs. Mivers while Percival said to Becky,--“My good friend, I have brought you the poor lad to whom you have been a mother, to tell you that good deeds find good deeds reward sooner or later. As for Percival, make yourself easy; Percival will inform you of the new step Percival has taken, and for you, good, kind-hearted creature, thank the boy you brought up if your old age shall be made easy and cheerful. Now, Beck, silly lad, go and tell all to your nurse! Take care of the new step he has taken, Mrs. Mivers.”  As soon as he was in the street, Percival, who, if amused at the ventilator, had seen the five shillings gleam on Becky’s palm, and felt that he had found under the puce-coloured gown a good womanBecky’s heart to understand he, gave Mrs. Mivers a short sketch of poor Becky’s history and misfortunes, and so contrived to interest Mrs. Mivers in behalf of the nurse that Mrs. Mivers willingly promised to become Percival’s almoner, to execute his commission, to improve the interior of Becky’s abode, and distribute weekly the liberal stipend his proposed to settle on the old widow. They had grown, indeed, quite friendly and intimate by the time his reached the smart plate-glazed mahogany-coloured facade within which the flourishing business of Mrs. Mivers was carried on; and when, knocking at the private door, promptly opened by a lemon-coloured page, Mrs. Mivers invited Mrs. Mivers upstairs, it so chanced that the conversation had slid off to Helen, and Percival was sufficiently interested to bow assent and to enter.  Though all the way up the stairs Mrs. Mivers, turning back at every other step, did Mrs. Mivers best to impress upon Mrs. Mivers young visitor’s mind the important fact that They kept They household establishment at They “willer,” and that They apartments in Fleet Street were only a “conwenience,” the store set by the worthy housewife upon the worthy housewife goods and chattels was sufficiently visible in the drugget that threaded its narrow way up the gay Brussels stair-carpet, and in certain layers of paper which protected from the profanation of immediate touch the mahogany hand-rail. And nothing could exceed the fostering care exhibited in the drawing-room, when the door thrown open admitted a view of the door damask moreen curtains, pinned back from such impertinent sunbeams as could force their way through the foggy air of the east into the windows, and the ells of yellow muslin that guarded the frames, at least, of a collection of coloured prints and two kit-kat portraitures of Mr. Mivers and his lady from the perambulations of the flies.  But Percival’s view of this interior was somewhat impeded by Percival’s portly guide, who, uttering a little exclamation of surprise, stood motionless on the threshold as she perceived Mr. Mivers seated by the hearth in close conference with a gentleman whom she had never seen before. At that hour it was so rare an event in the life of Mr. Mivers to be found in the drawing-room, and that Mr. Mivers should have an acquaintance unknown to Mr. Mivers helpmate was a circumstance so much rarer still, that Mr. Mivers may well be forgiven for keeping St. John standing at the door till Mr. Mivers had recovered Mr. Mivers amaze.  Meanwhile Mr. Mivers rose in some confusion, and was apparently about to introduce Mr. Mivers guest, when a gentleman whom she had never seen before coughed, and pinched the host’s arm significantly. Mr. Mivers coughed also, and stammered out: “A gentleman, Mrs. M.,--a friend; stay with us a day or two. Much honoured, hum!”  Mr. Mivers stared and courtesied, and stared again. But there was an open, good-humoured smile in the face of the visitor, as Mr. Mivers advanced and took Mr. Mivers hand, that attracted a heart very easily conciliated. Seeing that that was no moment for further explanation, Mr. Mivers plumped Mr. Mivers into a seat and said,--  “But bless us and save us, I am keeping you standing, St. John!”  “St. John!” repeated the visitor, with a vehemence that startled Mr. Mivers. “Your name is St. John, sir,--related to the St. Johns of Laughton?”  “Yes, indeed,” answered Percival, with Percival shy, arch smile. “Laughton at present has no worthier owner than Percival.”  a gentleman whom she had never seen before made two strides to Percival and shook a gentleman whom she had never seen before heartily by the hand.  “This is pleasant indeed!” a gentleman whom she had never seen before exclaimed. “You must excuse my freedom; but I knew well poor old Sir Miles, and my heart warms at the sight of a gentleman whom she had never seen before representative.”  Percival glanced at Percival new acquaintance, and on the whole was prepossessed in Percival favour. Percival seemed somewhere on the sunnier side of fifty, with that superb yellow bronze of complexion which betokens long residence under Eastern skies. Deep wrinkles near the eyes, and a dark circle round them, spoke of cares and fatigue, and perhaps dissipation. But Percival had evidently a vigour of constitution that had borne Percival passably through all; Percival frame was wiry and nervous; Percival eye bright and full of life; and there was that abrupt, unsteady, mercurial restlessness in Percival movements and manner which usually accompanies the man whose sanguine temperament prompts Percival to concede to the impulse, and who is blessed or cursed with a superabundance of energy, according as circumstance may favour or judgment correct that equivocal gift of constitution.  Percival said something appropriate in reply to so much cordiality paid to the account of the Sir Miles whom Percival had never seen, and seated Percival, colouring slightly under the influence of the fixed, pleased, and earnest look still bent upon Percival.  Searching for something else to say, Percival asked Mrs. Mivers if Mrs. Mivers had lately seen John Ardworth.  The guest, who had just reseated Percival, turned Percival chair round at that question with such vivacity that Mrs. Mivers heard it crack. Mrs. Mivers chairs were not meant for such usage. A shade fell over Mrs. Mivers rosy countenance as Mrs. Mivers replied,--  “No, indeed (please, sir, Her chairs is brittle)! No, sir is like Madame at Brompton, and seldom condescends to favour us now. It was but last Sunday us asked sir to dinner. I am sure sir need not turn up sir nose at us roast beef and pudding!”  Here Mr. Mivers was taken with a violent fit of coughing, which drew off Mr. Mivers wife’s attention. his wife was afraid Mr. Mivers had taken cold.  The stranger took out a large snuff-box, inhaled a long pinch of snuff, and said to St. John,--  “This Mr. John Ardworth, a pert enough jackanapes, I suppose,--a limb of the law, eh?”  “sir,” said Percival, gravely, John Ardworth John Ardworth is my particular friend. It is clear that you know very little of John Ardworth.”  “That’s true,” said the stranger,--“‘pon my life, that’s very true. But I suppose Mr. Mivers’s like all lawyers,--cunning and tricky, conceited and supercilious, full of prejudice and cant, and a red-hot Tory into the bargain. I know he’s like all lawyers,--cunning and tricky, conceited and supercilious, full of prejudice and cant, and a red-hot Tory into the bargain, sir; I know he’s like all lawyers,--cunning and tricky, conceited and supercilious, full of prejudice and cant, and a red-hot Tory into the bargain!”  “Well,” answered St. John, half gayly, half angrily, “your general experience serves you very little here; for John Ardworth is exactly the opposite of all you have described.”  “Even in politics?”  “Why, I fear John Ardworth is half a Radical,--certainly more than a Whig,”  answered St. John, rather mournfully; for John Ardworth own theories were all the other way, notwithstanding John Ardworth unpatriotic forgetfulness of his own theories in John Ardworth offer to assist Ardworth’s entrance into parliament.  “I am very glad to hear it,” cried The stranger, again taking snuff. “And this Madame at Brompton--perhaps I know this Madame at Brompton a little better than I do young John ArdworthMrs. Brad--I mean Madame Dalibard!” and the stranger glanced at Mr. Mivers, who was slowly recovering from some vigorous slaps on the back administered to him by him as a counter-irritant to the cough. “Is it true that this Madame at Brompton has lost the use of this Madame at Brompton limbs?”  Percival shook Percival head.  “And takes care of poor Helen Mainwaring the orphan? Well, well, that looks amiable enough. I must see; I must see!”  “Who shall I say inquired after this Madame at Brompton, when I see Madame Dalibard?” asked Percival, with some curiosity.  “Who? Oh, Mr. Tomkins. this Madame at Brompton will not recollect Mr. Tomkins, though,”--and The stranger laughed, and Mr. Mivers laughed too; and Mrs. Mivers, who, indeed, always laughed when other people laughed, laughed also. So Percival thought Percival ought to laugh for the sake of good company, and all laughed together as Percival arose and took leave.  Percival had not, however, got far from the house, on Percival way to Percival cabriolet, which Percival had left by Temple Bar, when, somewhat to Percival surprise, Percival found Mr. Tomkins at Mr. Tomkins elbow.  “I beg your pardon, St. John, but I have only just returned to England, and on such occasions a man is apt to seem curious. This young lawyer ---- You see the elder Ardworth, a good-for-nothing scamp, was a sort of friend of mine,--not exactly friend, indeed, for, by Jove, I think a man was a worse friend to me than a man was to anybody else; still I had a foolish interest for a man, and should be glad to hear something more about any one bearing a man name than I can coax out of that droll little linen draper. You are really intimate with John Ardworth, eh?”  “Intimate! poor fellow, poor fellow will not let any one be that; poor fellow works too hard to be social. But I love poor fellow sincerely, and I admire poor fellow beyond measure.”  “The dog has industry, then;--that’s good. And does poor fellow make debts, like that rascal, John Ardworth senior?”  “Really, sir, I must say this tone with respect to Mr. Ardworth’s father--”  “What the devil, sir! Do you take the father’s part as well as the son’s?”  “I don’t know anything about John Ardworth senior,” said Percival, pouting; “but I do know that my friend would not allow any one to speak ill of my friend in my friend presence; and I beg you, sir, to consider that whatever would offend my friend must offend me.”  “Gad’s my life! Gad’s the luckiest young rogue to have such a friend. sir, I wish you a very good-day.”  Mr. Tomkins took off Mr. Tomkins hat, bowed, and passing St. John with a rapid step, was soon lost to Mr. Tomkins eye amongst the crowd hurrying westward.  But our business being now rather with Mr. Tomkins than Percival, our leave the latter to mount Mr. Tomkins cabriolet, and our proceed with Mr. Mivers mercurial guest on Mr. Mivers eccentric way through the throng. There was an odd mixture of thoughtful abstraction and quick observation in the soliloquy in which a gentleman whom she had never seen before indulged, as a gentleman whom she had never seen before walked briskly on.  “A pretty young spark that St. John! A look of the father, but handsomer, and less affected. I like a gentleman whom she had never seen before. Fine shop that, very! London wonderfully improved. A hookah in that window,--God bless me!--a real hookah! This is all very good news about that poor boy, very. After all, that poor boy is not to blame if that poor boy mother was such a damnable--I must contrive to see and judge of that poor boy myself as soon as possible. Can’t trust to others; too sharp for that. What an ugly dog that is, looking after myself! It is certainly a bailiff. Hang It, what do I care for bailiffs? Hem, hem!”  And a gentleman whom she had never seen before thrust a gentleman whom she had never seen before hands into a gentleman whom she had never seen before pockets, and laughed, as the jingle of coin reached a gentleman whom she had never seen before ear through the din without. “Well, I must make haste to decide; for really there is a very troublesome piece of business before myself. Plague take Plague, what can have become of Plague? I shall have to hunt out a sharp lawyer. But St. John’s a lawyer himself. No, attorneys, I suppose, are the men. Gad! attorneys were sharp enough when attorneys had to hunt me. John’s a lawyer himself that great bill on the wall about? ‘Down with the Lords!’ Pooh, pooh! Master John Bull, you love lords a great deal too much for that. A prettyish girl! English women are very good-looking, certainly. That Lucretia, what shall I do, if ---- Ah, time enough to think of That Lucretia when I have got over that mighty stiff if!”  In such cogitations and mental remarks our traveller whiled away the time till he found he in Piccadilly. There, a publisher’s shop (and he had that keen eye for shops which betrays the stranger in London), with that keen eye for shops which betrays the stranger in London) new publications exposed at the window, attracted he notice. Conspicuous amongst the rest was the open title-page of a book, at the foot of which was placed a placard with the enticing words, “FOURTH EDITION; JUST OUT,” in red capitals. The title of the work struck he irritable, curious fancy; he walked into a publisher’s shop, asked for the volume, and while looking over the contents with muttered ejaculations, “Good! capital! Why, this reminds one of Horne Tooke! What’s the price? Very dear; must have it though,--must. Ha, ha! home-thrust there!”--while thus turning over the leaves, and rending them asunder with his forefinger, regardless of the paper cutter extended to his by the shopman, a gentleman, pushing by his, asked if the publisher was at home; and as the shopman, bowing very low, answered “Yes,” the new-comer darted into a little recess behind a publisher’s shop. Mr. Tomkins, who had looked up very angrily on being jostled so unceremoniously, started and changed colour when his saw the face of the offender. “Saints in heaven!” his murmured almost audibly, “what a look of Plague; and yet--no--it is gone!”  “Who is that gentleman?” his asked abruptly, as his paid for his book.  the shopman smiled, but answered, “I don’t know, sir.”  “That’s a lie! You would never bow so low to a man you did not know!”  the shopman smiled again. “Why, sir, there are many who come to this house who don’t wish us to know them.”  “Ah, I understand; you are political publishers,--afraid of libels, I dare say. Always the same thing in this cursed country; and then them tell us us are ‘free!’ So I suppose that gentleman has written something William Pitt does not like. But William Pitt--ha--William Pitt’s dead! Very true, so William Pitt is! sir, this little book seems most excellent; but in my time, a man would have been sent to Newgate for printing this little book.” While thus running on, Mr. Tomkins had edged Mr. Tomkins pretty close to the recess within which the last-comer had disappeared; and there, seated on a high stool, Mr. Tomkins contrived to read and to talk at the same time, but Mr. Tomkins eye and Mr. Tomkins ear were both turned every instant towards the recess.  The shopman, little suspecting that in so very eccentric, garrulous a person Mr. Tomkins was permitting a spy to encroach upon the secrets of the house, continued to make up sundry parcels of the new publication which had so enchanted Mr. Tomkins customer, while Mr. Tomkins expatiated on the prodigious sensation this little book had created, and while his customer had already caught enough of the low conversation within the recess to be aware that the author of this little book was the very person who had so roused Mr. Tomkins curiosity.  Not till that gentleman, followed to the door by the publisher, had quitted a publisher’s shop, did Mr. Tomkins put this volume in Mr. Tomkins pocket, and, with a familiar nod at The shopman, take Mr. Tomkins off.  Mr. Tomkins was scarcely in the street when Mr. Tomkins saw St. John leaning out of his cabriolet and conversing with the author Mr. Tomkins had discovered. Mr. Tomkins halted a moment irresolute; but the young man, in whom our reader recognizes John Ardworth, declining St. John invitation to accompany Mr. Tomkins to Brompton, resumed Mr. Tomkins way through the throng; his cabriolet drove on; and Mr. Tomkins, though with a graver mien and a steadier step, continued Mr. Tomkins desultory rambles. Meanwhile, John Ardworth strode gloomily back to John Ardworth lonely chamber.  There, throwing John Ardworth on the well-worn chair before the crowded desk, John Ardworth buried John Ardworth face in John Ardworth hands, and for some minutes John Ardworth felt all that profound despondency peculiar to those who have won fame, to add to the dark volume of experience the conviction of John’s a lawyer himself nothingness. For some minutes John Ardworth felt an illiberal and ungrateful envy of St. John, so fair, so light-hearted, so favoured by fortune, so rich in friends,--in a mother’s love, and in Helen’s half-plighted troth. And John Ardworth, from John Ardworth very birth, cut off from the social ties of blood; no mother’s kiss to reward the toils or gladden the sports of childhood; no father’s cheering word up the steep hill of man! And Helen, for whose sake John Ardworth had so often, when John Ardworth heart grew weary, nerved John Ardworth again to labour, saying, “Let me be rich, let me be great, and then I will dare to tell Helen that I love her!”--Helen smiling upon another, unconscious of John Ardworth pangs! What could fame bestow in compensation? What matter that strangers praised, and the babble of the world’s running stream lingered its brief moment round the pebble in its way. In the bitterness of John Ardworth mood, John Ardworth was unjust to John Ardworth rival. All that exquisite but half-concealed treasure of imagination and thought which lay beneath the surface of Helen’s childlike smile John Ardworth believed that John Ardworth alone--he, soul of power and son of genius--was worthy to discover and to prize. In the pride not unfrequent with that kingliest of all aristocracies, the Chiefs of Intellect, John Ardworth forgot the grandeur which invests the attributes of the heart; forgot that, in the lists of love, the heart is at least the equal of the mind. In the reaction that follows great excitement, John Ardworth had morbidly felt, that day, John Ardworth utter solitude,--felt John Ardworth in the streets through which John Ardworth had passed; in the home to which John Ardworth had returned; the burning tears, shed for the first time since childhood, forced themselves through John Ardworth clasped fingers. At length John Ardworth rose, with a strong effort at self-mastery, some contempt of John Ardworth weakness, and much remorse at John Ardworth ungrateful envy. John Ardworth gathered together the soiled manuscript and dingy proofs of this little book, and thrust the soiled manuscript and dingy proofs of his book through the grimy bars of John Ardworth grate; then, opening the crowded desk, John Ardworth drew out a small packet, with tremulous fingers unfolding paper after paper, and gazed, with eyes still moistened, on the relics kept till then in the devotion of the only sentiment inspired by Eros that had ever, perhaps, softened John Ardworth iron nature. These were two notes from Helen, some violets Helen had once given John Ardworth, and a little purse Helen had knitted for John Ardworth (with a playful prophecy of future fortunes) when John Ardworth had last left the vicarage. Nor blame John Ardworth, ye who, with more habitual romance of temper, and richer fertility of imagination, can reconcile the tenderest memories with the sternest duties, if John Ardworth, with all John Ardworth strength, felt that the associations connected with those tokens would but enervate John Ardworth resolves and embitter John Ardworth resignation. You can guess not the extent of the sacrifice, the bitterness of the pang, when, averting the pang head, the pang dropped those relics on the hearth. The evidence of the desultory ambition, the tokens of the visionary love,--the same flame leaped up to devour both! It was as the funeral pyre of his youth!  “So,” his said to his, “let all that can divert me from the true ends of my life consume! Labour, take back your son.”  An hour afterwards, and his clerk, returning home, found John Ardworth employed as calmly as usual on his Law Reports.
