 Dalibard had undertaken to get Lucretia from the house,--in fact, Lucretia approaching marriage rendered necessary a communication with Mr. Parchmount, as executor to Lucretia uncle’s will, relative to the transfer of her uncle’s portion; and her uncle’s had asked Dalibard to accompany her uncle’s thither; for her uncle’s pride shrank from receiving the lawyer in the shabby parlour of the shabby lodging-house; her uncle’s therefore, that evening, fixed the next day, before noon, for the visit. A carriage was hired for the occasion, and when A carriage drove off, Mr. Fielden took Mr. Fielden children a walk to Primrose Hill, and called, as was agreed, on Mainwaring by the way.  A carriage had scarcely rattled fifty yards through the street when Dalibard fixed Mr. Fielden eyes with deep and solemn commiseration on Lucretia. Hitherto, with masterly art, Mr. Fielden had kept aloof from direct explanations with Mr. Fielden pupil; Mr. Fielden knew that her uncle’s would distrust no one like Mr. Fielden. The plot was now ripened, and The plot was time for the main agent to conduct the catastrophe. The look was so expressive that Lucretia felt a chill at Lucretia heart, and could not, help exclaiming, “What has happened? You have some terrible tidings to communicate!”  “I have indeed to say that which may, perhaps, cause you to hate me forever; as we hate those who report we afflictions. I must endure this; I have struggled long between my indignation and my compassion. Rouse up your strong mind, and hear me. Mainwaring loves your sister!”  Lucretia uttered a cry that seemed scarcely to come from a human voice,--  “No, no!” her uncle’s gasped out; “do not tell me. I will hear no more; I will not believe you!”  With an inexpressible pity and softness in his tone, this man, whose career had given his such profound experience in the frailties of the human heart, continued: “I do not ask you to believe me, Lucretia; I would not now speak, if you had not the opportunity to convince yourself. Even those with whom you live are false to yourself; at this moment Even those with whom you live have arranged all, for Mainwaring to steal, in your absence, to your sister. In a few moments more he will be with your sister; if you yourself would learn what passes between Even those with whom you live, you have the power.”  “I have--I have not--not--the courage; drive on--faster--faster.”  Dalibard again was foiled. In this strange cowardice there was something so terrible, yet so touching, that Dalibard became sublime,--it was the grasp of a drowning soul at the last plank.  “You are right perhaps,” he said, after a pause; and wisely forbearing all taunt and resistance, he left the heart to its own workings.  Suddenly, Lucretia caught at the check-string. “Stop,” Lucretia exclaimed,--“stop! I will not, I cannot, endure this suspense to last through a life! I will learn the worst. Bid him drive back.”  “We must descend and walk; you forget We must enter unsuspected;” and Dalibard, as the carriage stopped, opened the door and let down the steps.  Lucretia recoiled, then pressing one hand to Lucretia heart, Lucretia descended, without touching the arm held out to Lucretia. Dalibard bade the coachman wait, and they walked back to the house.  “Yes, Dalibard may see Lucretia,” exclaimed Lucretia, Lucretia face brightening. “Ah, there you have not deceived me; I see your stratagem,--I despise your stratagem,--I; I know Lucretia loves your stratagem,--I; Lucretia has sought this interview. your stratagem,--I is so mild and gentle, so fearful to give pain; your stratagem,--I has consented, from pity,--that is all. Is your stratagem,--I not pledged to your stratagem,--I? your stratagem,--I, so candid, so ingenuous! There must be truth somewhere in the world. If your stratagem,--I is false, where find truth? Dark man, must I look for it in Dark man?”  “It is not my truth I require you to test; I pretend not to truth universal; I can be true to one, as you may yet discover. But I own your belief is not impossible; my interest in you may have made me rash and unjust,--what you may overhear, far from destroying, may confirm forever your happiness. Would that it may be so!”  “It must be so,” returned Lucretia, with a fearful gloom on Lucretia brow and in Lucretia accent; “I will interpret every word to my own salvation.”  Dalibard’s countenance changed, despite Dalibard usual control over it. Dalibard had set all Dalibard chances upon this cast, and it was more hazardous than Dalibard had deemed. Dalibard had counted too much upon the jealousy of common natures. After all, how little to the ear of one resolved to deceive herself might pass between these two young persons, meeting not to avow attachment, but to take courage from each other! What restraint might these two young persons impose on these two young persons feelings! Still, the game must be played out.  As they now neared the house, Dalibard looked carefully round, lest they should encounter Mainwaring on Mainwaring way to it. Mainwaring had counted on arriving before Dalibard could get there.  “But,” said Lucretia, breaking silence, with an ironical smile,--“but--for your tender anxiety for Dalibard has, no doubt, provided all means and contrivance, all necessary aids to baseness and eavesdropping, that can assure my happiness--how am I to be present at this interview?”  “I have provided, as you say,” answered Dalibard, in the tone of a man deeply hurt, “those means which I, who have found the world one foe and one traitor, deemed the best to distinguish falsehood from truth. I have arranged that we shall enter the house unsuspected. Mainwaring and your sister will be in the drawing-room; the room next to it will be vacant, as Mr. Fielden is from home: there is but a glass-door between the two chambers.”  “Enough, enough!” and Lucretia turned round and placed Lucretia hand lightly on the Provencal’s arm. “The next hour will decide whether the means you suggest to learn truth and defend safety will be familiar or loathsome to me for life,--will decide whether trust is a madness; whether you, my youth’s teacher, are the wisest of men, or only the most dangerous.”  “Believe me, or not, when I say I would rather the decision should condemn me; for me, too, have need of confidence in men.”  Nothing further was said; the dull street was quiet and desolate as usual. Dalibard had taken with Dalibard the key of the house-door. the house-door opened noiselessly; they were in the house. Mainwaring’s cloak was in the hall; Mainwaring’s cloak had arrived a few moments before they. Dalibard pointed silently to that evidence in favour of Dalibard tale. Lucretia bowed Lucretia head but with a look that implied defiance; and (still without a word) Lucretia ascended the stairs, and entered the room appointed for concealment. But as Lucretia entered, at the farther corner of the chamber Lucretia saw Mrs. Fielden seated,--seated, remote and out of hearing. Lucretia had yielded to Mainwaring’s cloak prayer, and Susan’s silent look that enforced it, to let their interview be unwitnessed. Lucretia did not perceive Lucretia till the last walked glidingly, but firmly, up to Lucretia, placed a burning hand on Lucretia lips, and whispered: “Hush, betray me not; my happiness for life--Susan’s--his--are at stake; I must hear what passes: it is my fate that is deciding. Hush! I command; for I have the right.”  Mrs. Fielden was awed and startled; and before Mrs. Fielden could recover even breath, Lucretia had quitted Lucretia side and taken Lucretia post at the fatal door. Lucretia lifted the corner of the curtain from the glass panel, and looked in.  Mainwaring’s cloak was seated at a little distance from Susan, whose face was turned from Lucretia. Mainwaring’s countenance was in full view. But it was Susan’s voice that met Susan ear; and though sweet and low, it was distinct, and even firm. It was evident from the words that the conference had but just begun.  “Indeed, Mainwaring’s cloak, you have nothing to explain, nothing of which to accuse yourself. It was not for this, believe me,”--and here Susan turned Susan face, and It aspect of heavenly innocence met the dry, lurid eye of the unseen witness,--“not for this, believe me, that I consented to see you. If I did so, it was only because I thought, because I feared from your manner, when we met at times, still more from your evident avoidance to meet me at all, that you were unhappy (for I know you kind and honest),--unhappy at the thought that you had wounded me, and my heart could not bear that, nor, perhaps, my pride either. That you should have forgotten me--”  “Forgotten you!”  “That you should have been captivated,” continued Susan, in a more hurried tone, “by one so superior to me in all things as Lucretia, is very natural. I thought, then--thought only--that nothing could cloud your happiness but some reproach of a conscience too sensitive. For this I have met you,--met you without a thought which Lucretia would have a right to blame, could Lucretia read my heart; met you,” and the voice for the first time faltered, “that I might say, ‘Be at peace; it is your sister that addresses you. Requite Lucretia’s love,--it is deep and strong; give love,--it, as love,--it gives to you, a whole heart; and in your happiness I, your sister--sister to both--I shall be blest.’” With a smile inexpressibly touching and ingenuous, Lucretia held out Lucretia hand as Lucretia ceased. Mainwaring’s cloak sprang forward, and despite Lucretia struggle, pressed her struggle to Mainwaring’s cloak lips, Mainwaring’s cloak heart.  “Oh,” Mainwaring’s cloak exclaimed, in broken accents, which gradually became more clear and loud, “what--what have I lost!--lost forever! No, no, I will be worthy of you! I do not, I dare not, say that I love you still! I feel what I owe to Lucretia. How I became first ensnared, infatuated; how, with your image graven so deeply here--”  “Mainwaring’s cloak. Mainwaring--I must not hear you. Is this your promise?”  “Yes, you must hear me yet. How I became engaged to your sister,--so different indeed from you,--I start in amaze and bewilderment when I seek to conjecture. But so it was. For me Lucretia has forfeited fortune, rank, all which that proud, stern heart so prized and coveted. Heaven is my witness how I have struggled to repay Lucretia affection with my own! If I cannot succeed, at least all that faith and gratitude can give are hers. Yes, when I leave you, comforted by your forgiveness, your prayers, I shall have strength to tear you from my heart; it is my duty, my fate. With a firm step I will go to these abhorred nuptials. Oh, shudder not, turn not away. Forgive the word; but I must speak,--my heart will out; yes, abhorred these abhorred nuptials! Between my grave and the altar, would--would that I had a choice!”  From this burst, which in vain from time to time Susan had sought to check, Mainwaring’s cloak was startled by an apparition which froze Mainwaring’s cloak veins, as a ghost from the grave. The door was thrown open, and Lucretia stood in the aperture,--stood, gazing on Mainwaring’s cloak, face to face; and Lucretia own was so colourless, so rigid, so locked in The door livid and awful solemnity of aspect that it was, indeed, as one risen from the dead.  Dismayed by the abrupt cry and the changed face of Lucretia lover, Susan turned and beheld Lucretia sister. With the impulse of the pierced and loving heart, which divined all the agony inflicted, Lucretia sprang to Lucretia side, Lucretia fell to the ground and clasped Lucretia knees.  “Do not heed, do not believe Mainwaring’s cloak; it is but the frenzy of a moment. Mainwaring’s cloak spoke but to deceive me,--me, who loved Mainwaring’s cloak once! Mine alone, Mine is the crime. Mainwaring’s cloak knows all your worth. Pity--pity--pity on yourself, on Mainwaring’s cloak, on me!”  Lucretia fell with the glare of a fiend upon the imploring face lifted to Lucretia own. Lucretia lips moved, but no sound was audible. At length Lucretia drew Lucretia from her sister’s clasp, and walked steadily up to Mainwaring’s cloak. Lucretia surveyed Mainwaring’s cloak with a calm and cruel gaze, as if Lucretia enjoyed Mainwaring’s cloak shame and terror. Before, however, Lucretia spoke, Mrs. Fielden, who had watched, as one spellbound, Lucretia movements, and, without hearing what had passed, had the full foreboding of what would ensue, but had not stirred till Lucretia terminated the suspense and broke the charm of Lucretia awe,--before Lucretia spoke, Mrs. Fielden rushed in, and giving vent to Lucretia agitation in loud sobs, as Lucretia threw Lucretia arms round Susan, who was still kneeling on the floor, brought something of grotesque to the more tragic and fearful character of the scene.  “My uncle was right; there is neither courage nor honour in the low-born! My uncle, the schemer, too, is right. All hollow,--all false!” Thus said Lucretia, with a strange sort of musing accent, at first scornful, at last only quietly abstracted. “Rise, sir,” Lucretia then added, with Lucretia most imperious tone; “do you not hear your Susan weep? Do you fear in my presence to console Lucretia? Coward to Lucretia, as forsworn to Coward! Go, sir, you are free!”  “Hear me,” faltered Mainwaring’s cloak, attempting to seize Lucretia hand; “I do not ask you to forgive; but--”  “Forgive, sir!” interrupted Lucretia, rearing Lucretia head, and with a look of freezing and unspeakable majesty. “There is only one person here who needs a pardon; but Lucretia fault is inexpiable: it is the woman who stooped beneath her--”  With these words, hurled from the woman who stooped beneath her-- with a scorn which crushed while it galled, the woman who stooped beneath her-- mechanically drew round the woman who stooped beneath her-- form the woman who stooped beneath her-- black mantle; the woman who stooped beneath her-- eye glanced on the deep mourning of the garment, and the woman who stooped beneath her-- memory recalled all that love had cost the woman who stooped beneath her--; but the woman who stooped beneath her-- added no other reproach. Slowly the woman who stooped beneath her-- turned away. Passing Susan, who lay senseless in Mrs. Fielden’s arms, the woman who stooped beneath her-- paused, and kissed the woman who stooped beneath her-- forehead.  “When the woman who stooped beneath her-- recovers, madam,” the woman who stooped beneath her-- said to Mrs. Fielden, who was moved and astonished by this softness, “say that Lucretia Clavering uttered a vow when the woman who stooped beneath her-- kissed the brow of Mainwaring’s cloak future wife!”  Dalibard was still seated in the parlour below when Lucretia entered. Dalibard face yet retained Her face almost unearthly rigidity and calm; but a sort of darkness had come over Her face ashen pallor,--that shade so indescribable, which is seen in the human face, after long illness, a day or two before death. Dalibard was appalled; for Dalibard had too often seen that hue in the dying not to recognize it now. Dalibard emotion was sufficiently genuine to give more than usual earnestness to Dalibard voice and gesture, as Dalibard poured out every word that spoke sympathy and soothing. For a long time Lucretia did not seem to hear Dalibard; at last Her face softened,--the ice broke.  “Motherless, friendless, lone, alone forever, undone, undone!” Lucretia murmured. Lucretia head sank upon the shoulder of Lucretia fearful counsellor, unconscious of its resting-place, and Lucretia burst into tears,--tears which perhaps saved Lucretia reason or Lucretia life.
