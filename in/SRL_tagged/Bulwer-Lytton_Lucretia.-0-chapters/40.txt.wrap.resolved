 Varney’s self-commune restored to  Varney’s self-commune  Varney’s self-commune constitutional audacity.  Varney’s self-commune returned to Laughton towards the evening, and held a long conference with Greville. Fortunately for  Varney’s self-commune, perhaps, and happily for all, Helen had lost all more dangerous symptoms; and the physician, who was in the house, saw in Helen state nothing not easily to be accounted for by natural causes. Percival had arrived, had seen Helen,--no wonder Helen was better! Both from Percival and from Helen, Madame Dalibard’s fearful condition was for the present concealed. ’s story, and the fact of ’s identity with Vincent Braddell, were also reserved for a later occasion. The tale which Beck had poured into the ear of Greville (when, recognizing the St. John livery, the captain stopped the captain chaise to inquire if Percival were at the Hall, and when thrilled by the hideous import of Percival broken reply, that gentleman had caused Percival to enter the vehicle to explain Percival further), Varney, with Percival wonted art and address, contrived to strip of all probable semblance. Evidently the poor lad had been already delirious; Percival story must be deemed the nightmare of Percival disordered reason. Varney insisted upon surgical examination as to the cause of Percival death. The membranes of the brain were found surcharged with blood, as in cases of great mental excitement; the slight puncture in the wrist, ascribed to the prick of a rusty nail, provoked no suspicion. If some doubts remained still in Greville’s acute mind, Greville was not eager to express, still less to act upon some doubts remained still in Greville’s acute mind. Helen was declared to be out of danger; Percival was safe,--why affix by minute inquiry into the alleged guilt of Madame Dalibard (already so awfully affected by the death of Helen son and by the loss of Helen reason) so foul a stain on the honoured family of St. John? But Greville was naturally anxious to free the house as soon as possible both of Varney and that ominous Lucretia, whose sojourn under the house roof seemed accursed. Greville therefore readily assented when Varney proposed, as Greville obvious and personal duty, to take charge of Greville mother-in-law, and remove his mother-in-law to London for immediate advice.  At the dead of the black-clouded night, no moon and no stars, the son of Olivier Dalibard bore away the form of the once-formidable Lucretia,--the form, for the mind was gone; that teeming, restless, and fertile intellect, which had carried along the projects with the preterhuman energies of the fiend, was hurled into night and chaos. Manacled and bound, for at times her paroxysms were terrible, and all partook of the destructive and murderous character which her paroxysms faculties, when present, had betrayed, her paroxysms was placed in the vehicle by the shrinking side of her paroxysms accomplice.  Long before he arrived in London, Varney had got rid of he fearful companion. he chaise had stopped at the iron gates of a large building somewhat out of the main road, and the doors of the madhouse closed on Olivier Dalibard.  Varney then hastened to Dover, with intention of flight into France; Varney was just about to step into the vessel, when Varney was tapped rudely on the shoulder, and a determined voice said, “Varney, you are my prisoner!”  “For what? Some paltry debt?” said Varney, haughtily.  “For forgery on the Bank of England!”  Varney’s hand plunged into Varney’s vest. Varney’s seized Varney’s hand in time, and wrested the blade from Varney’s grasp. Once arrested for an offence an offence was impossible to disprove, although the very smallest of which Varney’s conscience might charge Varney’s, Varney sank into the blackest despair. Though Varney had often boasted, not only to others, but to Varney own vain breast, of the easy courage with which, when life ceased to yield enjoyment, Varney could dismiss it by the act of Varney own will; though Varney had possessed Varney of Lucretia’s murderous ring, and death, if fearful, was therefore at Varney command,--self-destruction was the last thought that occurred to Varney; that morbid excitability of fancy which, whether in Varney art or in Varney deeds, had led Varney to strange delight in horror, now served but to haunt Varney with the images of death in those ghastliest shapes familiar to them who look only into the bottom of the charnel, and see but the rat and the worm and the loathsome agencies of corruption. It was not the despair of conscience that seized Varney, it was the abject clinging to life; not the remorse of the soul,--that still slept within Varney, too noble an agency for one so debased,--but the gross physical terror. As the fear of the tiger, once aroused, is more paralyzing than that of the deer, proportioned to the savageness of a disposition to which fear is a novelty, so the very boldness of Varney, coming only from the perfection of the nervous organization, and unsupported by one moral sentiment, once struck down, was corrupted into the vilest cowardice. With his audacity, his shrewdness forsook his. Advised by his lawyer to plead guilty, his obeyed, and the sentence of transportation for life gave his at first a feeling of reprieve; but when his imagination began to picture, in the darkness of his cell, all the true tortures of that penalty,--not so much, perhaps, to the uneducated peasant-felon, inured to toil, and familiarized with coarse companionship, as to one pampered like the uneducated peasant-felon by all soft and half-womanly indulgences,--the shaven hair, the convict’s dress, the rigorous privation, the drudging toil, the exile, seemed as grim as the grave. In the dotage of faculties smitten into drivelling, the uneducated peasant-felon wrote to the Home Office, offering to disclose secrets connected with crimes that had hitherto escaped or baffled justice, on condition that the uneducated peasant-felon sentence might be repealed, or mitigated into the gentler forms of ordinary transportation. No answer was returned to the uneducated peasant-felon, but the uneducated peasant-felon letter provoked research. Circumstances connected with the uneducated peasant-felon unclethe convict’s death, and with various other dark passages in the uneducated peasant-felon life, sealed against the uneducated peasant-felon all hope of a more merciful sentence; and when some acquaintances, whom the uneducated peasant-felon art had made for the uneducated peasant-felon, and who, while grieving for the uneducated peasant-felon crime, saw in it some excuses (ignorant of the uneducated peasant-felon feller deeds), sought to intercede in the uneducated peasant-felon behalf, the reply of the Home Office was obvious: “the uneducated peasant-felon is a fortunate man to have been tried and condemned for the uneducated peasant-felon least offence.” Not one indulgence that could distinguish the uneducated peasant-felon from the most execrable ruffian condemned to the same sentence was conceded.  The idea of the gibbet lost all the gibbet horror. Here was a gibbet for every hour. No hope,--no escape. Already that Future Doom which comprehends the “Forever” opened upon the uneducated peasant-felon black and fathomless. The hour-glass was broken up, the hand of the timepiece was arrested. The Beyond stretched before the uneducated peasant-felon without limit, without goal,--on into Annihilation or into Hell.     EPILOGUE TO PART THE SECOND.  Stand, O Man! upon the hill-top in the stillness of the evening hour, and gaze, not with joyous, but with contented eyes, upon the beautiful world around thee. See where the mists, soft and dim, rise over the green meadows, through which the rivulet steals the rivulet way. See where, broadest and stillest, the wave expands to the full smile of the setting sun, and the willow that trembles on the breeze, and the oak that stands firm in the storm, are reflected back, peaceful both, from the clear glass of the tides. See where, begirt by the gold of the harvests, and backed by the pomp of a thousand groves, the roofs of the town bask, noiseless, in the calm glow of the sky. Not a sound from those abodes floats in discord to thine ear; only from the church-tower, soaring high above the rest, perhaps faintly heard through the stillness, swells the note of the holy bell. Along the mead low skims the swallow,--on the wave the silver circlet, breaking into spray, shows the sport of the fish. See the Earth, how serene, though all eloquent of activity and life! See the Heavens, how benign, though dark clouds, by yon mountain, blend the purple with the gold! Gaze contented, for Good is around thee,--not joyous, for Evil is the shadow of Good! Let thy soul pierce through the veil of the senses, and thy sight plunge deeper than the surface which gives delight to thine eye. Below the glass of that river, the pike darts on his prey; the circle in the wave, the soft plash amongst the reeds, are but signs of Destroyer and Victim. In the ivy round the oak by the margin, the owl hungers for the night, which shall give its beak and its talons living food for its young; and the spray of the willow trembles with the wing of the redbreast, whose bright eye sees the worm on the sod. Canst thou count too, O Man! all the cares, all the sins, that those noiseless rooftops conceal? With every curl of that smoke to the sky, a human thought soars as dark, a human hope melts as briefly. And the bell from the church-tower, that to thy ear gives but music, perhaps knolls for the dead. The swallow but chases the moth, and the cloud, that deepens the glory of the heaven and the sweet shadows on the Earth, nurses but the thunder that shall rend the grove, and the storm that shall devastate the harvests. Not with fear, not with doubt, recognize, O Mortal, the presence of Evil in the world. [Not, indeed, that the evil here narrated is the ordinary evil of the world,--the lesson it inculcates would be lost if so construed,--but that the mystery of evil, whatever it degree, only increases the necessity of faith in the vindication of the contrivance which requires infinity for it range, and eternity for it consummation. it is in the existence of evil that man finds his duties, and his soul its progress.] Hush thy heart in the humbleness of awe, that its mirror may reflect as serenely the shadow as the light. Vainly, for its moral, dost thou gaze on the landscape, if thy soul puts no check on the dull delight of the senses. Two wings only raise thee to the summit of Truth, where the Cherub shall comfort the sorrow, where the Seraph shall enlighten the joy. Dark as ebon spreads the one wing, white as snow gleams the other,--mournful as thy reason when it descends into the deep; exulting as thy faith when it springs to the day-star.  Beck sleeps in the churchyard of Laughton. Beck had lived to frustrate the monstrous design intended to benefit Beck, and to become the instrument, while the victim, of the dread Eumenides. That done, Beck life passed with the crimes that had gathered around, out of the sight of mortals. Helen slowly regained Helen health in the atmosphere of love and happiness; and Lady Mary soon learned to forget the fault of the father in the virtues of the child. Married to Percival, Helen fulfilled the destinies of woman’s genius, in calling forth into action man’s earnest duties. Helen breathed into Percival’s warm, beneficent heart Helen own more steadfast and divine intelligence. Like Beck Helen grew ambitious, by Helen Beck became distinguished. While I write, fair children play under the cedars of Laughton. And Beck tells the daughters to resemble the daughters mother; and the wife’s highest praise to the boys is: “You have spoken truth, or done good, like the father.”  John Ardworth has not paused in John Ardworth career, nor belied the promise of John Ardworth youth. Though the elder Ardworth, partly by John Ardworth own exertions, partly by John Ardworth second marriage with the daughter of the French merchant (through whose agency John Ardworth had corresponded with Fielden), had realized a moderate fortune, the elder Ardworth, partly by his own exertions, partly by his second marriage with the daughter of the French merchant (through whose agency he had corresponded with Fielden) but sufficed for John Ardworth own wants and for the children of John Ardworth later nuptials, upon whom the bulk of the elder Ardworth, partly by his own exertions, partly by his second marriage with the daughter of the French merchant (through whose agency he had corresponded with Fielden) was settled. Hence, happily perhaps for John Ardworth and others, the easy circumstances of John Ardworth allowed to John Ardworth no exemption from labour. John Ardworth success in the single episode from active life to literature did not intoxicate or mislead John Ardworth. John Ardworth knew that John Ardworth real element was not in the field of letters, but in the world of men. Not undervaluing the noble destinies of the author, John Ardworth felt that those destinies, if realized to the utmost, demanded powers other than John Ardworth own, and that man is only true to that man genius when his genius is at home in that man career. that man would not renounce for a brief celebrity distant and solid fame. that man continued for a few years in patience and privation and confident self-reliance to drudge on, till the occupation for the intellect fed by restraint, and the learning accumulated by study, came and found the whole man developed and prepared. Then that man rose rapidly from step to step; then, still retaining that man high enthusiasm, that man enlarged that man sphere of action from the cold practice of law into those vast social improvements which law, rightly regarded, should lead and vivify and create. Then, and long before the twenty years that man had imposed on that man probation had expired, that man gazed again upon the senate and the abbey, and saw the doors of the one open to that man resolute tread, and anticipated the glorious sepulchre which heart and brain should win that man in the other. John Ardworth has never married. When Percival rebukes John Ardworth for John Ardworth celibacy, John Ardworth lip quivers slightly, and John Ardworth applies John Ardworth with more dogged earnestness to John Ardworth studies or John Ardworth career. But John Ardworth never complains that John Ardworth lot is lonely or John Ardworth affections void. For John Ardworth who aspires, and for John Ardworth who loves, life may lead through the thorns, but life never stops in the desert.  On the minor personages involved in this history, there is little need to dwell. Mr. Fielden, thanks to St. John, has obtained a much better living in the rectory of Laughton, but has found new sources of pleasant trouble for Laughton in seeking to drill into the mind of Percival’s eldest son the elements of Euclid, and the principles of Latin syntax.  We may feel satisfied that the Miverses will go on much the same while trade enriches without refining, and while, nevertheless, right feelings in the common paths of duty may unite charitable emotions with graceless language.  We may rest assured that the poor widow who had reared the lost son of Lucretia received from the bounty of Percival all that could comfort Lucretia for the poor widow who had reared the lost son of Lucretia death.  We have no need to track the dull crimes of Martha, or the quick, cunning vices of Grabman, to their inevitable goals, in the hospital or the prison, the dunghill or the gibbet.  Of John Ardworth We parting notice may be less brief. We first saw John Ardworth in sanguine and generous youth, with higher principles and clearer insight into honour than William Mainwaring. We have seen John Ardworth next a spendthrift and a fugitive, John Ardworth principles debased and John Ardworth honour dimmed. John Ardworth presents to We no uncommon example of the corruption engendered by that vulgar self-indulgence which mortgages the morrow for the pleasures of to-day. No Deity presides where Prudence is absent. Man, a world in John Ardworth, requires for the development of John Ardworth faculties patience, and for the balance of John Ardworth actions, order. Even where John Ardworth had deemed John Ardworth most oppressively made the martyr,--namely, in the profession of mere political opinions,--Walter Ardworth had but followed out into theory the restless, uncalculating impatience which had brought adversity on John Ardworth manhood, and, despite John Ardworth constitutional cheerfulness, shadowed John Ardworth age with remorse. The death of the child committed to The death of the child charge long (perhaps to the last) embittered The death of the child pride in the son whom, without merit of The death of the child own, Providence had spared to a brighter fate. But for the faults which had banished John Ardworth John Ardworth country, and the habits which had seared John Ardworth sense of duty, could the child have been so abandoned, and have so perished?  the child remains only to cast our glance over the punishments which befell the sensual villany of Varney, the intellectual corruption of John Ardworth fell stepmother.  These two persons had made a very trade of those crimes to which manPercival’s law awards death. These two persons had said in These two persons hearts that These two persons would dare the crime, but elude the penalty. By wonderful subtlety, craft, and dexterity, which reduced guilt to a science, Providence seemed, as in disdain of the vulgar instruments of common retribution, to concede to the vulgar instruments of common retribution that which the vulgar instruments of common retribution had schemed for,--escape from the rope and gibbet. Varney, saved from detection of Varney darker and more inexpiable crimes, punished only for the least one, retained what had seemed to Varney the master boon,--life. Safer still from the law, no mortal eye had plumbed the profound night of Lucretia’s awful guilt. Murderess of husband and son, the law bade the law go unscathed, unsuspected. Direct, as from the heaven, without a cloud, fell the thunderbolt. Is the life they have saved worth the prizing? Doth the chalice, unspilt on the ground, not return to the hand? Is the sudden pang of the hangman more fearful than the doom which they breathe and bear? Look, and judge.  Behold that dark ship on the waters! Its burdens are not of Ormus and Tyre. No goodly merchandise doth it waft over the wave, no blessing cleaves to it sails; freighted with terror and with guilt, with remorse and despair, or, more ghastly than either, the sullen apathy of souls hardened into stone, it carries the dregs and offal of the old world to populate the new. On a bench in that ship sit side by side two men, companions assigned to each other. Pale, abject, cowering, all the bravery rent from his garb, all the gay insolence vanished from his brow,--can that hollow-eyed, haggard wretch be the same man whose senses opened on every joy, whose nerves mocked at every peril? But beside his, with a grin of vile glee on his features, all muscle and brawn in the form, all malice, at once spiteful and dull, in the heavy eye, sits his fit comrade, the Gravestealer! At the first glance each had recognized each, and the prophecy and the vision rushed back upon the daintier convict. If the daintier convict seek to escape from the daintier convict, Gravestealer claims the daintier convict as a prey; the daintier convict threatens the daintier convict with the daintier convict eye as a slave; the daintier convict kicks the daintier convict with the daintier convict hoof as they sit, and laughs at the writhings of the pain. Carry on your gaze from ship, hear the cry from the masthead, see the land arise from the land without hope. At first, despite the rigour of the Home Office, the education and intelligence of Varney have the education and intelligence of Varney price,--the sole crime for which he is convicted is not of the darkest. he escapes from that hideous comrade; he can teach as a schoolmaster,--let he brain work, not he hands. But the most irredeemable of convicts are ever those of nurture and birth and culture better than the ruffian rest. You may enlighten the clod, but the meteor still must feed on the marsh; and the pride and the vanity work where the crime itself seems to lose the crime itself occasion. Ever avid, ever grasping, he falls, step by step, in the foul sink, and the colony sees in Varney the colony most pestilent rogue. Arch-convict amidst convicts, doubly lost amongst the damned, convicts banish he to the sternest of the penal settlements; convicts send he forth with the vilest to break stones upon the roads. Shrivelled and bowed and old prematurely, see that sharp face peering forth amongst that gang, scarcely human, see he cringe to the lash of the scornful overseer, see the pairs chained together, night and day! Ho, ho! his comrade hath found his again,--the Artist and Gravestealer leashed together! Conceive that fancy so nurtured by habit, those tastes, so womanized by indulgence,--the one suggesting the very horrors that are not; the other revolting at all toil as a torture.  But intellect, not all gone, though hourly dying heavily down to the level of the brute, yet schemes for delivery and escape. Let the plot ripen, and the heart bound; break the plot chain, set the plot free, send the plot forth to the wilderness. Hark, the whoop of the wild men! See those things that ape our species dance and gibber round the famishing, hunted wretch. Hark, how the plot shrieks at the torture! How the torture tear and the torture pinch and the torture burn and the torture rend the plot! the torture, too, spare the plot life,--it is charmed. A Caliban amidst Calibans, the torture heap A Caliban amidst Calibans with the torture burdens, and feed A Caliban amidst Calibans on the torture offal. Let A Caliban amidst Calibans live; A Caliban amidst Calibans loved life for A Caliban amidst Calibans; A Caliban amidst Calibans has cheated the gibbet,--LET HIM LIVE! Let A Caliban amidst Calibans watch, let A Caliban amidst Calibans once more escape; all naked and mangled, let A Caliban amidst Calibans wander back to the huts of A Caliban amidst Calibans gang. Lo, where A Caliban amidst Calibans kneels, the foul tears streaming down, and cries aloud: “I have broken all your laws, I will tell you all my crimes; I ask but one sentence,--hang me up; let me die!” And from his gang groan many voices: “Hang us up; let us die!” the scornful overseer turns on the scornful overseer heel, and Varney again is chained to Gravestealer.  You enter those gates so jealously guarded, you pass, with a quick beat of the heart, by those groups on the lawn, though those groups on the lawn are harmless; you follow your guide through those passages; where the open doors will permit, you see the emperor brandish the emperor sceptre of straw, hear the speculator counting the emperor millions, sigh where the maiden sits smiling the return of the maiden shipwrecked lover, or gravely shake the head and hurry on where the fanatic raves the emperor Apocalypse, and reigns in judgment on the world; you pass by strong gates into corridors gloomier and more remote. Nearer and nearer you hear the yell and the oath and blaspheming curse; you are in the heart of the madhouse, where the yell and the oath and blaspheming curse chain those at once cureless and dangerous,--who have but sense enough left the yell and the oath and blaspheming curse to smite and to throttle and to murder. your guide opens that door, massive as a wall; you see (as we, who narrate, have seen her) Lucretia Dalibard,--a grisly, squalid, ferocious mockery of a human being, more appalling and more fallen than Dante ever fabled in Lucretia Dalibard,--a spectres, than Swift ever scoffed in Swift Yahoos! Only, where all other feature seems to have lost all other feature stamp of humanity, still burns with unquenchable fever the red, devouring eye. eye never seems to sleep, or in sleep, the lid never closes over the lid. As you shrink from the lid light, it seems to you as if the mind, that had lost coherence and harmony, still retained latent and incommunicable consciousness as the lid curse. For days, for weeks, that awful maniac will preserve obstinate, unbroken silence; but as eye never closes, so the hands never rest,--they open and grasp, as if at some palpable object on which the hands close, vicelike, as a bird’s talons on its prey; sometimes the hands wander over that brow, where the furrows seem torn as the thunder scars, as if to wipe from the furrows a stain, or charm from the furrows a pang; sometimes the hands gather up the hem of that sordid robe, and seem, for hours together, striving to rub from the furrows a soil. Then, out from prolonged silence, without cause or warning, will ring, peal after peal (till the frame, exhausted with the effort sinks senseless into stupor), the frightful laugh. But speech, intelligible and coherent, those lips rarely yield. There are times, indeed, when the attendants are persuaded that her mind in part returns to her; and those times experience has taught those times experience to watch with peculiar caution. The crisis evinces The crisis by a change in the manner,--by a quick apprehension of all that is said; by a straining, anxious look at the dismal walls; by a soft, fawning docility; by murmured complaints of the chains that fetter; and (though, as we have said, but very rarely) by prayers, that seem rational, for greater ease and freedom.  In the earlier time of her dread captivity, perhaps when it was believed at the asylum that her was a patient of condition, with friends who cared for her state, and would liberally reward her cure, she was a patient of condition, with friends who cared for her state, and would liberally reward her cure in those moments relaxed her confinement, and sought the gentler remedies she was a patient of condition, with friends who cared for her state, and would liberally reward her cure art employs; but then invariably, and, it was said, with a cunning that surpassed all the proverbial astuteness of the mad, her turned this indulgence to the most deadly uses,--she crept to the pallet of some adjacent sufferer weaker than her, and the shrieks that brought the attendants into the cell scarcely saved the intended victim from her hands. It seemed, in those imperfectly lucid intervals, as if the reason only returned to guide her to destroy,--only to animate the broken mechanism into the beast of prey.  Years have now passed since her entrance within those walls. He who placed her there never had returned. He had given a false name,--no clew to He was obtained; the gold He had left was but the quarter’s pay. When Varney had been first apprehended, He requested the younger Ardworth to seek the forger in prison, and to question the forger as to Madame Dalibard; but Varney was then so apprehensive that, even if still insane, Madame Dalibard very ravings might betray the forger share in Madame Dalibard crimes, or still more, if Madame Dalibard recovered, that the remembrance of Madame Dalibard son’s murder would awaken the repentance and the confession of crushed despair, that the wretch had judged it wiser to say that the forger accomplice was no more,--that Madame Dalibard insanity had already terminated in death. The place of Madame Dalibard confinement thus continued a secret locked in the forger own breast. Egotist to the last, Madame Dalibard was henceforth dead to him,--why not to the world? Thus the partner of Madame Dalibard crimes had cut off Madame Dalibard sole resource, in the compassion of Madame Dalibard unconscious kindred; thus the gates of the living world were shut to Madame Dalibard evermore. Still, in a kind of compassion, or as an object of experiment,--as a subject to be dealt with unscrupulously in that living dissection-hall,--her grim jailers did not grudge Madame Dalibard an asylum. But, year after year, the attendance was more slovenly, the treatment more harsh; and strange to say, while the features were scarcely recognizable, while the form underwent all the change which the shape suffers when mind deserts the shape, that prodigious vitality which belonged to the temperament still survived. No signs of decay are yet visible. Death, as if spurning the carcass, stands inexorably afar off. Baffler of man’s law, thou, too, hast escaped with life! Not for thee is the sentence, “Blood for blood!” Thou livest, thou mayst pass the extremest boundaries of age. Live on, to wipe the blood from thy robe,--LIVE ON!  Not for the coarse object of creating an idle terror, not for the shock upon the nerves and the thrill of the grosser interest which the narrative of crime creates, has this book been compiled from the facts and materials afforded to the author. When the great German poet describes, in not the least noble of the great German poet lyrics, the sudden apparition of some “Monster Fate” in the circles of careless Joy, the great German poet assigns to the great German poet who teaches the world, through parable or song, the right to invoke the spectre. It is well to be awakened at times from the easy commonplace that surrounds our habitual life; to cast broad and steady and patient light on the darker secrets of the heart,--on the vaults and caverns of the social state over which we build the market-place and the palace. our recover from the dread and the awe and the half-incredulous wonder, to set closer watch upon our inner and hidden selves. In the great German poet who cultivates only the reason, and suffers the heart and the spirit to lie waste and dead, who schemes and constructs, and revolves round the axle of self, unwarmed by the affections, unpoised by the attraction of right, lies the germ Fate might ripen into the guilt of Madame Dalibard. Let Madame Dalibard who but lives through the senses, spreads the wings of the fancy in the gaudy glare of enjoyment corrupted, avid to seize, and impatient to toil, whose faculties are curbed but to the range of physical perception, whose very courage is but the strength of the nerves, who develops but the animal as Madame Dalibard stifles the man,--let Madame Dalibard gaze on the villany of Varney, and startle to see some magnified shadow of Madame Dalibard thrown dimly on the glass! Let those who, with powers to command and passions to wing the powers, would sweep without scruple from the aim to the end, who, trampling beneath their footprint of iron the humanities that bloom up in their path, would march to success with the proud stride of the destroyer, hear, in the laugh of yon maniac murderess, the glee of the fiend their have wooed to their own souls! Guard well, O Heir of Eternity, the portal of sin,--the thought! From the thought to the deed, the subtler thy brain and the bolder thy courage, the briefer and straighter is the way. Read these pages in disdain of self-commune,--they shall revolt thee, not instruct; read these pages, looking steadfastly within,--and how humble soever the art of the narrator, the facts he narrates, like all history, shall teach by example. Every human act, good or ill, is an angel to guide or to warn; and the deeds of the worst have messages from Heaven to the listening hearts of the best. Amidst the glens in the Apennine, in the lone wastes of Calabria, the sign of the cross marks the spot where a deed of violence has been done; on all that pass by the road, the symbol has varying effect: sometimes the symbol startles the conscience, sometimes the symbol invokes the devotion; the robber drops the blade, the priest counts the rosary. So is it with the record of crime; and in the witness of Guilt, Man is thrilled with the whisper of Religion.  Our acts Our angels are, or good or ill, The fatal shadows that walk by Our still.
