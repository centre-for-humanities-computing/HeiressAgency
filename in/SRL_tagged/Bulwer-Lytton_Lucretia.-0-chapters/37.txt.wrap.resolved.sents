 Towards the afternoon of the following day, an elderly gentleman was seated in the coffee-room of an hotel at Southampton, engaged in writing a letter, while the waiter in attendance was employed on the wires that fettered the petulant spirit contained in a bottle of Schweppe’s soda-water.
There was something in the aspect of the old gentleman, and in the very tone of the old gentleman voice, that inspired respect, and the waiter in attendance had cleared the other tables of their latest newspapers to place before the waiter in attendance.
the waiter in attendance had only just arrived by the packet from Havre, and even the newspapers had not been to the waiter in attendance that primary attraction even the newspapers generally constitute to the Englishman returning to the Englishman bustling native land, which, somewhat to the waiter in attendance surprise, has contrived to go on tolerably well during the waiter in attendance absence.
We use We privilege of looking over the waiter in attendance shoulder while the waiter in attendance writes:--  Here I am, then, dear Lady Mary, at Southampton, and within an easy drive of the old Hall.
A file of Galignani’s journals, which I found on the road between Marseilles and Paris, informed me, under the head of “fashionable movements,” that Percival St. John, Esquire, was gone to his seat at Laughton.
According to my customary tactics of marching at once to his seat at Laughton, I therefore made direct for Havre, instead of crossing from Calais, and I suppose I shall find our young gentleman engaged in the slaughter of hares and partridges.
You see it is a good sign that his can leave London.
Keep up your spirits, my dear friend.
If Perce has been really duped and taken in,--as all you mothers are so apt to fancy,--rely upon an old soldier to defeat the enemy and expose the ruse.
But if, after all, the girl is such as he describes and believes,--innocent, artless, and worthy he affection,--oh, then I range he, with your own good heart, upon he side.
Never will I run the risk of unsettling a man’s whole character for life by wantonly interfering with his affections.
But there we are agreed.
In a few hours I shall be with we dear boy, and our dear boy whole heart will come out clear and candid as when his whole heart beat under our dear boy midshipman’s true-blue.
In a day or two I shall make ’s true-blue take me to town, to introduce me to the whole nest of them.
Then I shall report progress.
Adieu, till then!
Kind regards to your poor sister.
I think we shall have a mild winter.
Not one warning twinge as yet of the old rheumatism.
Ever your devoted old friend and preux chevalier,  H. GREVILLE.
The captain had completed The captain letter, sipped The captain soda-water, and was affixing to The captain communication The captain seal, when The captain heard the rattle of a post-chaise without.
Fancying it was the one The captain had ordered, The captain went to the open window which looked on the street; but a post-chaise contained travellers, only halting to change horses.
Somewhat to The captain surprise, and a little to The captain chagrin,--for The captain did not count on finding company at the Hall,--he heard one of the travellers in a post-chaise ask the distance to Laughton.
The countenance of the questioner was not familiar to Laughton.
But leaving The captain to question the landlord, without any satisfactory information, and to hasten a post-chaise, we accompany the travellers on the travellers way to Laughton.
There were but two,--the proper complement of a post-chaise,--and they were both of the ruder sex.
The elder of the two was a man of middle age, but whom the wear and tear of active life had evidently advanced towards the state called elderly.
But there was still abundant life in The captain quick, dark eye; and that mercurial youthfulness of character which in some happy constitutions seems to defy years and sorrow, evinced itself in a rapid play of countenance and as much gesticulation as the narrow confines of the vehicle and the position of a traveller will permit.
a man of middle age, far more grave in aspect and quiet in manner, leaned back in the corner with folded arms, and listened with respectful attention to a man of middle age companion.
“Certainly, a man of middle age is right,--great happiness in an English post-chaise properly driven; more exhilarating than a palanquin.
‘Post equitem sedet atra cura,’--true only of such scrubby hacks as old Horace could have known.
Black Care does not sit behind English posters, eh, my boy?” As he spoke this, the gentleman had twice let down the glass of the vehicle, and twice put the vehicle up again.
“Yet,” he resumed, without noticing the brief, good-humoured reply of he companion,--“yet this is an anxious business enough that we are about.
I don’t feel quite easy in my conscience.
Poor Braddell’s injunctions were very strict, and I disobey Poor Braddell’s injunctions.
It is on your responsibility, John!”  “I take it without hesitation.
All the motives for so stern a severance must have ceased, and is it not a sufficient punishment to find in that hoped-for son a--”  “Poor woman!” interrupted the elder gentleman, in whom we begin to recognize the soi-disant Mr. Tomkins; “true, indeed, too true.
How well I remember the impression Lucretia Clavering first produced on me; and to think of Lucretia Clavering now as a miserable cripple!
By Jove, you are right, sir!
Drive on, post-boy, quick, quick!”  There was a short silence.
the gentleman abruptly put the gentleman hand upon the gentleman companion’s arm.
“What consummate acuteness; what patient research you have shown!
What could I have done in this business without you?
How often had that garrulous Mrs. Mivers bored me with Becky Carruthers, and the coral, and St. Paul’s, and not a suspicion came across me,--a word was sufficient for you.
And then to track this unfeeling old Joplin from place to place till you find Becky Carruthers absolutely a servant under the very roof of Mrs. Braddell Becky Carruthers!
Wonderful!
Ah, boy, you will be an honour to the law and to your country.
And what a hard-hearted rascal you must think me to have deserted you so long.”  “My dear father,” said John Ardworth, tenderly, “your love now recompenses me for all.
And ought I not rather to rejoice not to have known the tale of a mother’s shame until I could half forget it on a father’s breast?”  “John,” said the elder Ardworth, with a choking voice, “I ought to wear sackcloth all my life for having given you such a mother.
When I think what I have suffered from the habit of carelessness in those confounded money-matters [‘irritamenta malorum,’ indeed!
), I have only one consolation,--that my patient, noble son is free from my vice.
You would not believe what a well-principled, honourable fellow I was at your age; and yet, how truly I said to my poor friend William Mainwaring one day at Laughton (I remember it now) ‘Trust me with anything else but half-a-guinea!’ Why, sir, it was that fault that threw me into low company,--that brought me in contact with my innkeeper’s daughter at Limerick.
I fell in love, and I married (for, with all my faults, I was never a seducer, John).
I did not own my marriage; why should I?--my relatives had cut me already.
You were born, and, hunted poor devil as I was, I forgot all by your cradle.
Then, in the midst of my troubles, that ungrateful woman deserted me; then I was led to believe that it was not my own son whom I had kissed and blessed.
Ah, but for that thought should I have left you as I did?
And even in infancy, you had the features only of your mother.
Then, when the death of the adulteress set me free, and years afterwards, in India, I married again and had new ties, my heart grew still harder to you.
I excused you by knowing that at least you were cared for, and trained to good by a better guide than I.
But when, by so strange a hazard, the very priest who had confessed your mother on your mother deathbed (your mother was a Catholic) came to India, and (for so strange a hazard, the very priest who had confessed your mother on her deathbed (she was a Catholic) had known me at Limerick) recognized my altered person, and obeying so strange a hazard, the very priest who had confessed your mother on her deathbed (she was a Catholic) penitent’s last injunctions, assured me that you were my son,--oh, John, then, believe me, I hastened back to England on the wings of remorse!
Love you, boy!
I have left at Madras three children, young and fair, by a woman now in heaven, who never wronged me, and, by my soul, John Ardworth, you are dearer to you than all!”  The father’s head drooped on The father son’s breast as ’s spoke; then, dashing away ’s tears, ’s resumed,--  “Ah, why would not Braddell permit me, as I proposed, to find for Braddell the same guardianship as that to which I intrusted my own?
But his son bigotry besotted his son; a clergyman of the High Church,--that was worse than an atheist.
I had no choice left to you but the roof of that she-hypocrite.
Yet I ought to have come to England when I heard of the child’s loss, braved duns and all; but I was money-making, money-making,--retribution for money-wasting; and--well, it’s no use repenting!
And--and there is the lodge, the park, the old trees!
Poor Sir Miles!”
