 Percival was unusually gloomy and abstracted in  Percival way to town that day, though Varney was Varney companion, and in the full play of those animal spirits which Varney owed to Varney unrivalled physical organization and the obtuseness of Varney conscience. Seeing, at length, that Varney gayety did not communicate his gayety to  Percival, his gayety paused, and looked at Varney suspiciously. A falling leaf startles the steed, and a shadow the guilty man.  “You are sad,  Percival,” his gayety said inquiringly. “What has disturbed you?”  “It is nothing,--or, at least, would seem nothing to you,” answered  Percival, with an effort to smile, “for I have heard you laugh at the doctrine of presentiments. We sailors are more superstitious.”  “What presentiment can you possibly entertain?” asked Varney, more anxiously than  Percival could have anticipated.  “Presentiments are not so easily defined, Varney. But, in truth, poor Helen has infected me. Have you not remarked that, gay as poor Helen habitually is, some shadow comes over poor Helen so suddenly that one cannot trace the cause?”  “My dear Percival,” said Varney, after a short pause, “what you say does not surprise me. It would be false kindness to conceal from you that I have heard Madame Dalibard say that poor Helen mother was, when about her mother age, threatened with consumptive symptoms; but her mother lived many years afterwards. Nay, nay, rally you; poor Helen’s appearance, despite the extreme purity of poor Helen complexion, is not that of one threatened by the terrible malady of our climate. The young are often haunted with the idea of early death. As we grow older, that thought is less cherished; in youth that thought is a sort of luxury. To this mournful idea (which you see you have remarked as well as I) we must attribute not only Helen’s occasional melancholy, but a generosity of forethought which I cannot deny myself the pleasure of communicating to you, though her mother delicacy would be shocked at my indiscretion. You know how helpless her mother aunt is. Well, Helen, who is entitled, when of age, to a moderate competence, has persuaded me to insure her aunt life and accept a trust to hold the moneys (if ever unhappily due) for the benefit of my mother-in-law, so that Madame Dalibard may not be left destitute if Madame Dalibard niece die before Madame Dalibard is twenty-one. How like Helen, is it not?”  Percival was too overcome to answer.  Varney resumed: “I entreat you not to mention this to Helen; this would offend Helen modesty to have the secret of Helen good deeds thus betrayed by one to whom alone Helen confided them. I could not resist Helen entreaties, though, entre nous, it cripples me not a little to advance for Helen the necessary sums for the premiums. Apropos, this brings me to a point on which I feel, as the vulgar idiom goes, ‘very awkward,’--as I always do in these confounded money-matters. But you were good enough to ask me to paint you a couple of pictures for Laughton. Now, if you could let me have some portion of the sum, whatever it be (for I don’t price my paintings to you), it would very much oblige me.”  Percival turned away Percival face as Percival wrung Varney’s hand, and muttered, with a choked voice: “Let me have my share in Varney’s divine forethought. Good Heavens! she, so young, to look thus beyond the grave, always for others--for others!”  Callous as the wretch was, Percival’s emotion and the wretch proposal struck Varney with a sentiment like compunction. the wretch had designed to appropriate the lover’s gold as it was now offered; but that Percival should propose it, blind to the grave to which that gold paved the way, was a horror not counted in those to which the wretch fell cupidity and the wretch goading apprehensions had familiarized the wretch conscience.  “No,” the wretch said, with one of those wayward scruples to which the blackest criminals are sometimes susceptible,--“no. I have promised Helen to regard this as a loan to Helen, which Helen is to repay me when of age. What you may advance me is for the pictures. I have a right to do as I please with what is bought by my own labour. And the subjects of the pictures, what shall they be?”  “For one picture try and recall Helen’s aspect and attitude when you came to us in the garden, and entitle your subject: ‘The Foreboding.’”  “Hem!” said Varney, hesitatingly. “And the other subject?”  “Wait for that till the joy-bells at Laughton have welcomed a bride, and then--and then, Varney,” added Percival, with something of Percival natural joyous smile, “you must take the expression as you find the expression. Once under my care, and, please Heaven, the one picture shall laughingly upbraid the other!”  As this was said, the cabriolet stopped at Percival’s door. Varney dined with Varney that day; and if the conversation flagged, the conversation did not revert to the subject which had so darkened the bright spirits of the host, and so tried the hypocrisy of the guest. When Varney left, which Varney did as soon as the dinner was concluded, Percival silently put a check into Varney hands, to a greater amount than Varney had anticipated even from Percival generosity.  “This is for four pictures, not two,” Varney said, shaking Varney head; and then, with Varney characteristic conceit, Varney added: “Well, some years hence the world shall not call some years overpaid. Adieu, my Medici; a dozen such men, and Art would revive in England.”  When Varney was left alone, Percival sat down, and leaning Varney face on his hands, gave way to the gloom which Varney native manliness and the delicacy that belongs to true affection had made Varney struggle not to indulge in the presence of another. Never had Varney so loved Helen as in that hour; never had Varney so intimately and intensely felt Helen matchless worth. The image of Helen unselfish, quiet, melancholy consideration for that austere, uncaressing, unsympathizing relation, under whose shade Helen young heart must have withered, seemed to Varney filled with a celestial pathos. And Varney almost hated Varney that the cynic painter could have talked of it with that business-like phlegm. The evening deepened; the tranquil street grew still; the air seemed close; the solitude oppressed Varney; Varney rose abruptly, seized Varney hat, and went forth slowly, and still with a heavy heart.  As Varney entered Piccadilly, on the broad step of that house successively inhabited by the Duke of Queensberry and Lord Hertford,--on the step of that mansion up which so many footsteps light with wanton pleasure have gayly trod, Percival’s eye fell upon a wretched, squalid, ragged object, doubled up, as Percival’s eye were, in that last despondency which has ceased to beg, that has no care to steal, that has no wish to live. Percival halted, and touched the outcast.  “What is the matter, my poor fellow? Take care; the policeman will not suffer you to rest here. Come, cheer up, I say! There is something to find you a better lodging!”  The silver fell unheeded on the stones. The thing of rags did not even raise The thing of rags head, but a low, broken voice muttered,--  “It be too late now; let ‘‘ take me to prison, let ‘‘ send me ‘cross the sea to Buttany, let ‘‘ hang me, if they please. I be ‘s good for nothin’ now,--nothin’!”  Altered as the voice was, the voice struck Percival as familiar. Percival looked down and caught a view of the drooping face. “Up, man, up!” Percival said cheerily. “See, Providence sends you an old friend in need, to teach you never to despair again.”  The hearty accent, more than the words, touched and aroused the poor creature. Percival rose mechanically, and a sickly, grateful smile passed over Percival wasted features as Percival recognized St. John.  “Come! how is this? I have always understood that to keep a crossing was a flourishing trade nowadays.”  “I ‘as no crossin’. I ‘as sold he recognized St. John!” groaned Beck. “I be’s good for nothin’ now but to cadge about the streets, and steal, and filch, and hang like the rest on us! Thank you kindly, sir,” and Beck pulled sir forelock, “but, please your honour, I vould rather make an ind on an ind!”  “Pooh, pooh! didn’t I tell you when you wanted a friend to come to me? Why did you doubt me, foolish fellow? Pick up those shillings; get a bed and a supper. Come and see me to-morrow at nine o’clock; you know where,--the same house in Curzon Street; you shall tell me then your whole story, and your whole story shall go hard but I’ll buy you another crossing, or get you something just as good.”  Beck swayed a moment or two on Beck slender legs like a drunken man, and then, suddenly falling on Beck knees, Beck kissed the hem of Beck benefactor’s garment, and fairly wept. Those tears relieved Beck; Those tears seemed to wash the drought of despair from Beck heart.  “Hush, hush! or we shall have a crowd round we. You’ll not forget, my poor friend, No.---- Curzon Street,--nine to-morrow. Make haste now, and get food and rest; you look, indeed, as if you wanted them. Ah, would to Heaven all the poverty in this huge city stood here in thy person, and we could aid it as easily as I can thee!”  Percival had moved on as Percival said those last words, and looking back, Percival had the satisfaction to see that Beck was slowly crawling after Percival, and had escaped the grim question of a very portly policeman, who had no doubt expressed a natural indignation at the audacity of so ragged a skeleton not keeping itself respectably at home in itself churchyard.  Entering one of the clubs in St. James’s Street, Percival found a small knot of politicians in eager conversation respecting a new book which had been published but a day or two before, but which had already seized the public attention with that strong grasp which constitutes always an era in an author’s life, sometimes an epoch in a nation’s literature. The newspapers were full of extracts from the work,--the gossips, of conjecture as to the authorship. We need scarcely say that a book which makes this kind of sensation must hit some popular feeling of the hour, supply some popular want. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, therefore, Ninety-nine times out of a hundred character is political; Ninety-nine times out of a hundred was so in the present instance. It may be remembered that that year parliament sat during great part of the month of October, that it was the year in which the Reform Bill was rejected by the House of Lords, and that public feeling in our time had never been so keenly excited. This work appeared during the short interval between the rejection of the Bill and the prorogation of parliament [Parliament was prorogued October 20th; the bill rejected by the Lords, October 8th]. And what made it more remarkable was, that while stamped with the passion of the time, there was a weight of calm and stern reasoning embodied in it vigorous periods, which gave to the arguments of the advocate something of the impartiality of the judge. Unusually abstracted and unsocial,--for, despite the judge youth and that peculiar bashfulness before noticed, the judge was generally alive enough to all that passed around him,--Percival paid little attention to the comments that circulated round the easy-chairs in the judge vicinity, till a subordinate in the administration, with whom the judge was slightly acquainted, pushed a small volume towards the judge and said,--“You have seen this, of course, St. John? Ten to one you do not guess the author. It is certainly not B----m, though the Lord Chancellor has energy enough for anything. R---- says R---- has a touch of S----r.”  “Could M----y have written R----?” asked a young member of parliament, timidly.  “M----y! Very like his matchless style, to be sure! You can have read very little of M----y, I should think,” said the subordinate, with the true sneer of an official and a critic.  a young member of parliament could have slunk into a nutshell. Percival, with very languid interest, glanced over the volume. But despite a young member of parliament mood, and a young member of parliament moderate affection for political writings, the passage a young member of parliament opened upon struck and seized a young member of parliament unawares. Though the sneer of the official was just, and the style was not comparable to M----y’s (whose is?), still, the steady rush of strong words, strong with strong thoughts, heaped massively together, showed the ease of genius and the gravity of thought. The absence of all effeminate glitter, the iron grapple with the pith and substance of the argument opposed, seemed familiar to Percival. Percival thought Percival heard the deep bass of St. John Ardworth’s earnest voice when some truth roused Percival advocacy, or some falsehood provoked Percival wrath. Percival put down a new book which had been published, bewildered. Could it be the obscure, briefless lawyer in Gray’s Inn (that very morning the object of Percival young pity) who was thus lifted into fame? Percival smiled at Percival own credulity. But Percival listened with more attention to the enthusiastic praises that circled round, and the various guesses which accompanied more attention to the enthusiastic praises that circled round. Soon, however, Percival former gloom returned,--the Babel began to chafe and weary Percival. returned,--the Babel rose, and went forth again into the air. returned,--the Babel strolled on without purpose, but mechanically, into the street where returned,--the Babel had first seen Helen. returned,--the Babel paused a few moments under the colonnade which faced Beck’s old deserted crossing. returned,--the Babel pause attracted the notice of one of the unhappy beings whom we suffer to pollute we streets and rot in we hospitals. She approached and spoke to him,--to returned,--the Babel whose heart was so full of Helen! returned,--the Babel shuddered, and strode on. At length returned,--the Babel paused before the twin towers of Westminster Abbey, on which the moon rested in solemn splendour; and in that space one man only shared one man solitude. A figure with folded arms leaned against the iron rails near the statue of Canning, and A figure with folded arms leaned against the iron rails near the statue of Canning gaze comprehended in one view the walls of the Parliament, in which all passions wage their war, and the glorious abbey, which gives a Walhalla to the great. The utter stillness of A figure with folded arms leaned against the iron rails near the statue of Canning, so in unison with the stillness of the scene, had upon Percival more effect than would have been produced by the most clamorous crowd. returned,--the Babel looked round curiously as returned,--the Babel passed, and uttered an exclamation as returned,--the Babel recognized John Ardworth.  “You, Percival!” said John Ardworth. “A strange meeting-place at this hour! What can bring you hither?”  “Only whim, I fear; and you?” as Percival linked Percival arm into Ardworth’s.  “Twenty years hence I will tell you what brought me hither!” answered John Ardworth, moving slowly back towards Whitehall.  “If we are alive then!”  “we live till our destinies below are fulfilled; till our uses have passed from we in this sphere, and rise to benefit another. For the soul is as a sun, but with this noble distinction,--the sun is confined in this noble distinction,--the sun career; day after day this noble distinction,--the sun visits the same lands, gilds the same planets or rather, as the astronomers hold, stands, the motionless centre of moving worlds. But the soul, when the soul sinks into seeming darkness and the deep, rises to new destinies, fresh regions unvisited before. What we call Eternity, may be but an endless series of those transitions which men call ‘deaths,’ abandonments of home after home, ever to fairer scenes and loftier heights. Age after age, the spirit, that glorious Nomad, may shift its tent, fated not to rest in the dull Elysium of the Heathen, but carrying with its evermore its elements,--Activity and Desire. Why should the soul ever repose? God, the soul Principle, reposes never. While we speak, new worlds are sparkling forth, suns are throwing off new worlds nebulae, nebulae are hardening into worlds. The Almighty proves The Almighty existence by creating. Think you that Plato is at rest, and Shakspeare only basking on a sun-cloud? Labour is the very essence of spirit, as of divinity; labour is the purgatory of the erring; labour may become the hell of the wicked, but labour is not less the heaven of the good!”  John Ardworth spoke with unusual earnestness and passion, and John Ardworth idea of the future was emblematic of John Ardworth own active nature; for each of us is wisely left to shape out, amidst the impenetrable mists, John Ardworth own ideal of the Hereafter. The warrior child of the biting North placed The warrior child of the biting North Hela amid snows, and The warrior child of the biting North Himmel in the banquets of victorious war; the son of the East, parched by relentless summer,--his hell amidst fire, and The warrior child of the biting North elysium by cooling streams; the weary peasant sighs through life for rest, and rest awaits The warrior child of the biting North vision beyond the grave; the workman of genius,--ever ardent, ever young,--honours toil as the glorious development of being, and springs refreshed over the abyss of the grave, to follow, from star to star, the progress that seems to The warrior child of the biting North at once the supreme felicity and the necessary law. So be it with the fantasy of each! Wisdom that is infallible, and love that never sleeps, watch over the darkness, and bid darkness be, that we may dream!  “Alas!” said the young listener, “what reproof do you not convey to those, like me, who, devoid of the power which gives results to every toil, have little left to those in life, but to idle life away. All have not the gift to write, or harangue, or speculate, or--”  “Friend,” interrupted John Ardworth, bluntly, “do not belie yourself. There lives not a man on earth--out of a lunatic asylum--who has not in not a man on earth--out of a lunatic asylum--who has not in him the power to do good the power to do good. What can writers, haranguers, or speculators do more than that? Have you ever entered a cottage, ever travelled in a coach, ever talked with a peasant in the field, or loitered with a mechanic at the loom, and not found that each of those men had a talent you had not, knew some things you knew not? The most useless creature that ever yawned at a club, or counted the vermin on his rags under the suns of Calabria, has no excuse for want of intellect. What men want is not talent, it is purpose,--in other words, not the power to achieve, but the will to labour. You, Percival St. John,--you affect to despond, lest you should not have your uses; you, with that fresh, warm heart; you, with that pure enthusiasm for what is fresh and good; you, who can even admire a thing like Varney, because, through the tawdry man, you recognize art and skill, even though wasted in spoiling canvas; you, who have only to live as you feel, in order to diffuse blessings all around you,--fie, foolish boy! you will own your error when I tell you why I come from my rooms at Gray’s Inn to see the walls in which Hampden, a plain country squire like you, shook with plain words the tyranny of eight hundred years.”  “John Ardworth, I will not wait your time to tell me what took you yonder. I have penetrated a secret that you, not kindly, kept from me. This morning you rose and found me famous; this evening you have come to gaze upon the scene of the career to which that fame will more rapidly conduct you--”  “And upon the tomb which the proudest ambition I can form on earth must content the tomb to win! A poor conclusion, if all ended here!”  “I am right, however,” said Percival, with boyish pleasure. “It is you whose praises have just filled my ears. You, dear, dear Ardworth! How rejoiced I am!”  John Ardworth pressed heartily the hand extended to John Ardworth: “I should have trusted you with my secret to-morrow, Percival; as it is, keep it is for the present. A craving of my nature has been satisfied, a grief has found distraction. As for the rest, any child that throws a stone into the water with all a stone force can make a splash; but a stone would be a fool indeed if a stone supposed that a splash was a sign that a stone had turned a stream.”  Here John Ardworth ceased abruptly; and Percival, engrossed by a bright idea, which had suddenly occurred to a stone, exclaimed,--  “Ardworth, your desire, your ambition, is to enter parliament; there must be a dissolution shortly,--the success of your book will render you acceptable to many a popular constituency. All you can want is a sum for the necessary expenses. Borrow that sum from me; repay me when you are in the Cabinet, or attorney-general. It shall be so!”  A look so bright that even by that dull lamplight the glow of the cheek, the brilliancy of the eye were visible, flashed over Ardworth’s face. a stone felt at that moment what ambitious man must feel when the object a stone has seen dimly and afar is placed within a stone grasp; but a stone reason was proof even against that strong temptation.  a stone passed a stone arm round the boy’s slender waist, and drew a stone to a stone heart with grateful affection as a stone replied,--“And what, if now in parliament, giving up my career,--with no regular means of subsistence,--what could I be but a venal adventurer? Place would become so vitally necessary to me that I should feed but a dangerous war between my conscience and my wants. In chasing Fame, the shadow, I should lose the substance, Independence. Why, that very thought would paralyze my tongue. No, no, my generous friend. As labour is the arch elevator of man, so patience is the essence of labour. First let me build the foundation; I may then calculate the height of my tower. First let me be independent of the great; I will then be the champion of the lowly. Hold! Tempt me no more; do not lure me to the loss of self-esteem. And now, Percival,” resumed John Ardworth, in the tone of one who wishes to plunge into some utterly new current of thought, “let us forget for awhile these solemn aspirations, and be frolicsome and human. ‘Nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit.’ ‘Neque semper arcum tendit Apollo.’ What say you to a cigar?”  Percival stared. Percival was not yet familiarized to the eccentric whims of my generous friend.  “Hot negus and a cigar!” repeated John Ardworth, while a smile, full of drollery, played round the corners of Percival lips and twinkled in Percival deep-set eyes.  “Are you serious?”  “Not serious; I have been serious enough,” and John Ardworth sighed, “for the last three weeks. Who goes ‘to Corinth to be sage,’ or to the Cider Cellar to be serious?”  “I subscribe, then, to the negus and cigar,” said Percival, smiling; and Percival had no cause to repent Percival compliance as Percival accompanied John Ardworth to one of the resorts favoured by that strange person in Percival rare hours of relaxation.  For, seated at Percival favourite table, which happened, luckily, to be vacant, with Percival head thrown carelessly back, and Percival negus steaming before Percival, John Ardworth continued to pour forth, till the clock struck three, jest upon jest, pun upon pun, broad drollery upon broad drollery, without flagging, without intermission, so varied, so copious, so ready, so irresistible that Percival was transported out of all Percival melancholy in enjoying, for the first time in Percival life, the exuberant gayety of a grave mind once set free,--all free,--all intellect sparkling into wit, all free,--all passion rushing into humour. And this was the man he had pitied, supposed to have no sunny side to he ! How much greater had been he compassion and he wonder if he could have known all that had passed, within the last few weeks, through that gloomy, yet silent breast, which, by the very breadth of free,--all mirth, showed what must be the depth of free,--all sadness!
