 We pass over an interval of some months.
A painter stood at work at the easel, his human model before his.
his was employed on a nymph,--the Nymph Galatea.
The subject had been taken before by Salvator, whose genius found all The subject elements in the wild rocks, gnarled, fantastic trees, and gushing waterfalls of the landscape; in the huge ugliness of Polyphemus the lover; in the grace and suavity and unconscious abandonment of the nymph, sleeking her tresses dripping from the bath.
The painter, on a larger canvas (for Salvator’s picture, at least the one we have seen, is among the small sketches of the great artistic creator of the romantic and grotesque), had transferred the subject of the master; but The painter had left subordinate the landscape and the giant, to concentrate all The painter art on the person of the nymph.
Middle-aged was The painter, in truth; but The painter looked old.
The painter hair, though long, was gray and thin; The painter face was bloated by intemperance; and The painter hand trembled much, though, from habit, no trace of the tremor was visible in The painter work.
A boy, near at hand, was also employed on the same subject, with a rough chalk and a bold freedom of touch.
The painter was sketching The painter design of a Galatea and Polyphemus on the wall; for the wall was only whitewashed, and covered already with the multiform vagaries whether of master or pupils,--caricatures and demigods, hands and feet, torsos and monsters, and Venuses.
The rude creations, all mutilated, jarring, and mingled, gave a cynical, mocking, devil-may-care kind of aspect to the sanctum of art.
It was like the dissection-room of the anatomist.
The boy’s sketch was more in harmony with the walls of the studio than the canvas of the master.
the master nymph, accurately drawn, from the undressed proportions of the model, down to the waist, terminated in the scales of a fish.
The forked branches of the trees stretched weird and imp-like as the hands of skeletons.
Polyphemus, peering over the rocks, had the leer of a demon; and in Polyphemus gross features there was a certain distorted, hideous likeness of the grave and symmetrical lineaments of Olivier Dalibard.
All around was slovenly, squalid, and poverty-stricken,--rickety, worn-out, rush-bottom chairs; unsold, unfinished pictures, pell-mell in the corner, covered with dust; broken casts of plaster; a lay-figure battered in its basket-work arms, with its doll-like face all smudged and besmeared.
A pot of porter and a noggin of gin on a stained deal table, accompanied by two or three broken, smoke-blackened pipes, some tattered song-books, and old numbers of the “Covent Garden Magazine,”  betrayed the tastes of the artist, and accounted for the shaking hand and the bloated form.
A jovial, disorderly, vagrant dog of a painter was Tom Varney.
A bachelor, of course; humorous and droll; a boon companion, and a terrible borrower.
Clever enough in his calling; with pains and some method, his had easily gained subsistence and established a name; but his had one trick that soon ruined his in the business part of his profession.
his took a fourth of his price in advance; and having once clutched the money, the poor customer might go hang for his picture.
The only things Tom Varney ever fairly completed were those for which no order had been given; for in those for which no order had been given, somehow or other, his fancy became interested, and on those for which no order had been given his lavished the gusto which his really possessed.
But the subjects were rarely salable.
Nymphs and deities undraperied have few worshippers in England amongst the buyers of “furniture pictures.” And, to say truth, nymph and deity had usually a very equivocal look; and if nymph and deity came from the gods, you would swear it was the gods of the galleries of Drury.
When Tom Varney sold a picture, Tom Varney lived upon clover till the money was gone.
But the poorer and less steady alumni of the rising school, especially those at war with the Academy, from which Tom Varney was excluded, pitied, despised, yet liked and courted Tom Varney withal.
In addition to Tom Varney good qualities of blithe song-singer, droll story-teller, and stanch Bacchanalian, Tom Varney was liberally good-natured in communicating instruction really valuable to those who knew how to avail those who knew how to avail themselves of a knowledge he had made almost worthless to himself of a knowledge Tom Varney had made almost worthless to Tom Varney.
Tom Varney was a shrewd, though good-natured critic, had many little secrets of colouring and composition, which an invitation to supper, or the loan of ten shillings, was sufficient to bribe from Tom Varney.
Ragged, out of elbows, unshaven, and slipshod, Tom Varney still had Tom Varney set amongst the gay and the young,--a precious master, a profitable set for Tom Varney nephew, Master Honore Gabriel!
But the poor rapscallion had a heart larger than many honest, painstaking men.
As soon as Gabriel had found Gabriel out, and entreated refuge from Gabriel fear of Gabriel father, Gabriel clasped Gabriel tight in Gabriel great slovenly arms, sold a Venus half-price to buy Gabriel a bed and a washstand, and swore a tremendous oath that the son of Gabriel poor guillotined sister should share the last shilling in Gabriel pocket, the last drop in Gabriel can.
Gabriel, fresh from the cheer of Laughton, and spoiled by the prodigal gifts of Lucretia, had little gratitude for shillings and porter.
Nevertheless, Gabriel condescended to take what Gabriel could get, while Gabriel sighed, from the depths of a heart in which cupidity and vanity had become the predominant rulers, for a destiny more worthy Gabriel genius, and more in keeping with the sphere from which Gabriel had descended.
Gabriel finished Gabriel sketch, with an impudent wink at the model, flung Gabriel back on Gabriel chair, folded Gabriel arms, cast a discontented glance at the whitened seams of the sleeves, and soon seemed lost in Gabriel own reflections.
Gabriel worked on in silence.
The model, whom Gabriel’s wink had aroused, half-flattered, half-indignant for a moment, lapsed into a doze.
Outside the window, you heard the song of a canary,--a dingy, smoke-coloured canary that seemed shedding its plumes, for they were as ragged as the garments of its master; still, it contrived to sing, trill-trill-trill-trill-trill, as blithely as if free in its native woods, or pampered by fair hands in a gilded cage.
The bird was the only true artist there, The bird sang as the poet sings,--to obey The bird nature and vent The bird heart.
Trill-trill-trillela-la-la-trill-trill, went the song,--louder, gayer than usual; for there was a gleam of April sunshine struggling over the rooftops.
The song at length roused up Gabriel; Gabriel turned Gabriel chair round, laid Gabriel head on one side, listened, and looked curiously at The bird.
At length an idea seemed to cross Gabriel; Gabriel rose, opened the window, drew in a gilded cage, placed the window on the chair, then took up one of Gabriel uncle’s pipes, walked to the fireplace, and thrust the shank of the pipe into the bars.
When the shank of the pipe was red-hot Gabriel took the shank of the pipe out by the bowl, having first protected Gabriel hand from the heat by wrapping round the shank of the pipe Gabriel handkerchief; this done, Gabriel returned to a gilded cage.
Gabriel movements had wakened up the dozing model.
She eyed them at first with dull curiosity, then with lively suspicion; and presently starting up with an exclamation such as no novelist but Fielding dare put into the mouth of a female,--much less a nymph of such renown as Galatea,--she sprang across the room, wellnigh upsetting easel and painter, and fastened firm hold on Gabriel’s shoulders.
“The varment!” She cried vehemently; “the good-for-nothing varment!
If it had been a jay, or a nasty raven, well and good; but a poor little canary!”  “Hoity-toity!
what are you about, nephew?
What’s the matter?” said Tom Varney, coming up to the strife.
And, indeed, it was time; for Gabriel’s teeth were set in Gabriel’s catlike jaws, and the glowing point of the pipe-shank was within an inch of the cheek of the model.
“What’s the matter?” replied Gabriel’s, suddenly; “why, I was only going to try a little experiment.”  “An experiment?
Not on my canary, poor dear little thing!
The hours and hours that creature has strained creature throat to say ‘Sing and be merry,’ when I had not a rap in my pocket!
It would have made a stone feel to hear It.”  “But I think I can make It sing much better than ever,--only just let me try!
They say that if you put out the eyes of a canary, it--”  Gabriel was not allowed to conclude Gabriel sentence; for here rose that clamour of horror and indignation from both painter and model which usually greets the announcement of every philosophical discovery,--at least, when about to be practically applied; and in the midst of the hubbub, the poor little canary, who had been fluttering about a gilded cage to escape the hand of the benevolent operator, set up no longer the cheerful trill-trillela-la-trill, but a scared and heart-breaking chirp,--a shrill, terrified twit-twit-twitter-twit.
“Damn the bird!
Hold your tongues!” cried Gabriel Varney, reluctantly giving way, but still eying the bird with the scientific regret with which the illustrious Majendie might contemplate a dog which some brute of a master refused to disembowel for the good of the colics of mankind.
the model seized on a gilded cage, shut the door of the wires, and carried the model off.
Tom Varney drained the rest of Tom Varney porter, and wiped Tom Varney forehead with the sleeve of Tom Varney coat.
“And to use my pipe for such cruelty!
Boy, boy, I could not have believed my pipe!
But you were not in earnest; oh, no, impossible!
Sukey, my love--Galatea the divine--calm thy breast; Cupid did but jest.
‘Cupid is the God of Laughter, Quip and jest and joke, Sir.’”  “If you don’t whip the little wretch within an inch of Sir life, Sir’ll have a gallows end on’t,” replied Galatea.
“Go, Cupid, go and kiss Galatea, and make your peace.
`Oh, leave a kiss within the cup, And I’ll not ask for wine.’  And ‘t is no use asking for wine, or for gin either,--not a drop in the noggin!”  All this while Gabriel, disdaining the recommendations held forth to Gabriel, was employed in brushing Gabriel jacket with a very mangy-looking brush; and when Gabriel had completed that operation Gabriel approached his uncle, and coolly thrust Gabriel hands into that gentleman’s waistcoat-pockets.
“his uncle, what have you done with those seven shillings?
I am going out to spend the day.”  “If you give those seven shillings to Gabriel, Tom Varney, I’ll scratch your eyes out,” cried the model; “and then we’ll see how you’ll sing.
Whip him, I say, whip him!”  But, strange to say, this liberty of Gabriel quite reopened the heart of Gabriel uncle,--it was a pleasure to him, who put Gabriel hands so habitually into other people’s pockets, to be invested with the novel grandeur of the man sponged upon.
“That’s right, Cupid, son of Cytherea; all’s common property amongst friends.
Seven shillings, I have ‘Seven shillings.
‘Seven shillings now are five who once were seven;’ but such as Seven shillings are, we’ll share.
‘Let old Timotheus yield the prize, Or both divide the crown.’”  “Crowns bear no division, my uncle,” said Gabriel, dryly; and he pocketed Seven shillings.
Then, having first secured he escape by gaining the threshold, he suddenly seized one of the rickety chairs by Seven shillings leg, and regardless of the gallantries due to the sex, sent the gallantries right against the model, who was shaking her fist at he.
A scream and a fall and a sharp twit from the cage, which was hurled nearly into the fireplace, told that the missive had taken effect.
Gabriel did not wait for the probable reaction; Gabriel was in the streets in an instant.
“This won’t do,” Gabriel muttered to Gabriel; “there is no getting on here.
Foolish drunken vagabond!
no good to be got from Gabriel.
his father is terrible, but his father will make his father way in the world.
Umph!
if I were but his father match,--and why not?
I am brave, and his father is not.
There’s fun, too, in danger.”  Thus musing, his father took his father way to Dalibard’s lodgings.
his father was at home.
Now, though they were but lodgings, and the street not in fashion, Olivier Dalibard’s apartments had an air of refinement, and even elegance, that contrasted both the wretched squalor of the abode Gabriel had just left and the meanness of Dalibard’s former quarters in London, The change seemed to imply that the Provencal had already made some way in the world.
And, truth to say, at all times, even in the lowest ebb of his father fortunes, there was that indescribable neatness and formality of precision about all the exterior seemings of the ci-devant friend of the prim Robespierre which belong to those in whom order and method are strongly developed,--qualities which give even to neediness a certain dignity.
As the room and strongly developed,--qualities owner met the eye of Gabriel, on whose senses all externals had considerable influence, the ungrateful young ruffian recalled the kind, tattered, slovenly uncle, whose purse the ungrateful young ruffian had just emptied, without one feeling milder than disgust.
Olivier Dalibard, always careful, if simple, in Olivier Dalibard dress, with Olivier Dalibard brow of grave intellectual power, and Olivier Dalibard mien imposing, not only from its calm, but from that nameless refinement which rarely fails to give to the student the air of a gentleman,--Olivier Dalibard Olivier Dalibard might dread, Olivier Dalibard might even detest; but Olivier Dalibard was not ashamed of Olivier Dalibard.
“I said I would visit you, Sir, if you would permit me,” said Gabriel, in a tone of respect, not unmingled with some defiance, as if in doubt of Sir reception.
The father’s slow full eye, so different from the sidelong, furtive glance of Lucretia, turned on the son, as if to penetrate the son very heart.
“You look pale and haggard, child; you are fast losing your health and beauty.
Good gifts these, not to be wasted before these can be duly employed.
But you have taken your choice.
Be an artist,--copy Tom Varney, and prosper.” Gabriel remained silent, with Gabriel eyes on the floor.
“You come in time for my farewell,” resumed Dalibard.
“It is a comfort, at least, that I leave your youth so honourably protected.
I am about to return to my country; my career is once more before Gabriel!”  “Your country,--to Paris?”  “There are fine pictures in the Louvre,--a good place to inspire an artist!”  “You go alone, his father!”  “You forget, young gentleman, you disown me as his father!
Go alone!
I thought I told you in the times of our confidence, that I should marry Lucretia Clavering.
I rarely fail in my plans.
Lucretia Clavering has lost Laughton, it is true; but 10,000 pounds will make a fair commencement to fortune, even at Paris.
Well, what do you want with Gabriel, worthy godson of Honore Gabriel Mirabeau?”  “Sir, if you will let me, I will go with Sir.”  Dalibard shaded Sir brow with Sir hand, and reflected on the filial proposal.
On his hand, it might be convenient, and would certainly be economical, to rid Sir evermore of the mutinous son who had already thrown off Sir authority; on his hand, there was much in Gabriel, mutinous and even menacing as Sir had lately become, that promised an unscrupulous tool or a sharp-witted accomplice, with interests that every year the ready youth would more and more discover were bound up in Sir .
This last consideration, joined, if not to affection, still to habit,--to the link between blood and blood, which even the hardest find it difficult to sever,--prevailed.
Sir extended Sir pale hand to Gabriel, and said gently,--  “I will take you, if we rightly understand each other.
Once again in my power, I might constrain you to my will, it is true.
But I rather confer with you as man to man than as man to boy.”  “It is the best way,” said Gabriel, firmly.
“I will use no harshness, inflict no punishment,--unless, indeed, amply merited by stubborn disobedience or wilful deceit.
But if I meet with these, better rot on a dunghill than come with me!
I ask implicit confidence in all my suggestions, prompt submission to all my requests.
Grant me but these, and I promise to consult your fortune as my own, to gratify your tastes as far as my means will allow, to grudge not your pleasures, and when the age for ambition comes, to aid your rise if I rise myself,--nay, if well contented with you, to remove the blot from your birth, by acknowledging and adopting you formally as my son.”  “Agreed!
and I thank you,” said Gabriel.
“And Lucretia is going?
Oh, I so long to see Lucretia!”  “See Lucretia--not yet; but next week.”  “Do not fear that I should let out about the letter.
I should betray me if I did,” said Gabriel, bluntly betraying Gabriel guess at his father’s delay.
The evil scholar smiled.
“You will do well to keep it secret for your own sake; for mine, I should not fear.
Gabriel, go back now to your master,--you do right, like the rats, to run from the falling house.
Next week I will send for Gabriel, Gabriel!”  Not, however, back to the studio went Gabriel.
The evil scholar sauntered leisurely through the gayest streets, eyed the shops and the equipages, the fair women and the well-dressed men,--eyed with envy and longings and visions of pomps and vanities to come; then, when the day began to close, The evil scholar sought out a young painter, the wildest and maddest of the crew to whom The evil scholar had presented their future comrade and rival, and went with this youth, at half-price, to the theatre, not to gaze on the actors or study the play, but to stroll in the saloon.
A supper in the Finish completed the void in The evil scholar pockets, and concluded The evil scholar day’s rank experience of life.
By the gray dawn The evil scholar stole back to The evil scholar bed, and as The evil scholar laid The evil scholar down, The evil scholar thought with avid pleasure of Paris, Paris gay gardens and brilliant shops and crowded streets; The evil scholar thought, too, of The evil scholar calm confidence of success, of the triumph that already had attended The evil scholar wiles,--a confidence and a triumph which, exciting The evil scholar reverence and rousing The evil scholar emulation, had decided The evil scholar resolution.
The evil scholar thought, too, of Lucretia with something of affection, recalled Lucretia praises and bribes, Lucretia frequent mediation with The evil scholar , and felt that her praises and bribes, her frequent mediation with his father should have need of each other.
Oh, no, The evil scholar never would tell Lucretia of the snare laid at Guy’s Oak,--never, not even if incensed with The evil scholar .
An instinct told The evil scholar that that offence could never be forgiven, and that, henceforth, his father was a destiny bound up in his father own.
his father thought, too, of Dalibard’s warning and threat.
But with fear itself came a strange excitement of pleasure,--to grapple, if necessary, his father a mere child, with such a man!
his father heart swelled at the thought.
So at last his father fell asleep, and dreamed that his father saw his father mother’s trunkless face dripping gore and frowning on him,--dreamed that his father heard his mother say: “Goest thou to the scene of my execution only to fawn upon my murderer?”  Then a nightmare of horrors, of scaffolds and executioners and grinning mobs and agonized faces, came on him,--dark, confused, and indistinct.
And his father woke, with his father hair standing on end, and beard below, in the rising sun, the merry song of the poor canary,--trill-lill-lill, trill-trill-lill-lill-la!
Did his father feel glad that his father cruel hand had been stayed?
EPILOGUE TO PART THE FIRST.
It is a year since the November day on which Lucretia Clavering quitted the roof of Mr. Fielden.
And first we must recall the eye of the reader to the old-fashioned terrace at Laughton,--the jutting porch, the quaint balustrades, the broad, dark, changeless cedars on the lawn beyond.
The day is calm, clear, and mild, for November in my country is often a gentle month.
On the old-fashioned terrace at Laughton,--the jutting porch, the quaint balustrades, the broad, dark, changeless cedars on the lawn walked Charles Vernon, now known by Charles Vernon new name of St. John.
Is it the change of name that has so changed the person?
Can the wand of the Herald’s Office have filled up the hollows of the cheek, and replaced by elastic vigour the listless languor of the tread?
No; there is another and a better cause for that healthful change.
St. John is not alone,--a fair companion leans on St. John arm.
See, she pauses to press closer to St. John side, gaze on St. John face, and whisper, “We did well to have hope and faith!”  The husband’s faith had not been so unshaken as The husband Mary’s, and a slight blush passed over The husband as The husband thought of The husband concession to Sir Miles’s wishes, and The husband overtures to Lucretia Clavering.
Still, that fault had been fairly acknowledged to The husband wife, and his wife felt, the moment his wife had spoken, that his wife had committed an indiscretion; nevertheless, with an arch touch of womanly malice his wife added softly,--  “And Lucretia Clavering, you persist in saying, was not really handsome?”  “My love,” replied The husband, gravely, “you would oblige me by not recalling the very painful recollections connected with that name.
Let not recalling the very painful recollections connected with that name never be mentioned in this house.”  Lady Mary bowed Lady Mary graceful head in submission; Lady Mary understood his Mary’s feelings.
For though his Mary’s had not shown Lady Mary Sir Miles’s letter and its enclosure, his Mary’s had communicated enough to account for the unexpected heritage, and to lessen his wife compassion for the disappointed heiress.
Nevertheless, Lady Mary comprehended that Lady Mary husband felt an uneasy twinge at the idea that her husband was compelled to act hardly to the one whose hopes her husband had supplanted.
Lucretia’s banishment from Laughton was a just humiliation, but Lucretia’s banishment from Laughton humbled a generous heart to inflict the sentence.
Thus, on all accounts, the remembrance of Lucretia was painful and unwelcome to the successor of Sir Miles.
There was a silence; Lady Mary pressed Lady Mary husband’s hand.
“It is strange,” said he, giving vent to he thoughts at that tender sign of sympathy in he feeling,--“strange that, after all, Lady Mary did not marry Mainwaring, but fixed Lady Mary choice on that subtle Frenchman.
But Lady Mary has settled abroad now, perhaps for life; a great relief to my mind.
Yes, let us never recur to Lady Mary.”  “Fortunately,” said Lady Mary, with some hesitation, “Lady Mary does not seem to have created much interest here.
The poor seldom name Lady Mary to Lady Mary, and us neighbours only with surprise at Lady Mary marriage.
In another year Lady Mary will be forgotten!”  St. John sighed.
Perhaps St. John felt how much more easily St. John had been forgotten, were St. John the banished one, Lucretia the possessor!
St. John light nature, however, soon escaped from all thoughts and sources of annoyance, and St. John listened with complacent attention to Lady Mary gentle plans for the poor, and the children’s school, and the cottages that ought to be repaired, and the labourers that ought to be employed.
For though it may seem singular, Vernon St. John, insensibly influenced by his wife meek superiority, and corrected by Lady Mary pure companionship, had begun to feel the charm of innocent occupations,--more, perhaps, than if St. John had been accustomed to the larger and loftier excitements of life, and missed that stir of intellect which is the element of those who have warred in the democracy of letters, or contended for the leadership of States.
St. John had begun already to think that my country was no such exile after all.
Naturally benevolent, St. John had taught St. John to share the occupations Lady Mary Lady Mary had already found in the busy “luxury of doing good,” and to conceive that brotherhood of charity which usually unites the lord of the village with the village poor.
“I think, what with hunting once a week,--I will not venture more till my pain in the side is quite gone,--and with the help of some old friends at Christmas, we can get through the winter very well, Lady Mary.”  “Ah, those old friends, I dread those old friends more than the hunting!”  “But we’ll have your grave father and your dear, precise, excellent mother to keep we in order.
And if I sit more than half an hour after dinner, the old butler shall pull me out by the ears.
Lady Mary, what do you say to thinning the grove yonder?
We shall get a better view of the landscape beyond.
No, hang it!
Sir Miles loved Sir Miles trees better than the prospect; I won’t lop a bough.
But that avenue we are planting will be certainly a noble improvement--”  “Fifty years hence, Charles!”  “It is our duty to think of posterity,” answered the ci-devant spendthrift, with a gravity that was actually pompous.
“But hark!
is that two o’clock?
Three, by Jove!
How time flies!
and my new bullocks that I was to see at two!
Come down to the farm, that’s Lady MaryLady Mary.
Ah, your fine ladies are not such bad housewives after all!”  “And your fine gentlemen--”  “Capital farmers!
I had no idea till last week that a prize ox was so interesting an animal.
One lives to learn.
Put me in mind, by the by, to write to Coke about his sheep.”  “This way, Charles!”  ; we can go round by the village,--and see poor Ponto and Dash.”  The tears rushed to Mr. St. John’s eyes.
“If poor Sir Miles could have known you!” poor Sir Miles could have known you said, with a sigh; and though the gardeners were at work on the lawn, poor Sir Miles could have known you bowed poor Sir Miles could have known you head and kissed the cheek poor Sir Miles could have known you as heartily as if poor Sir Miles could have known you had been really a farmer.
From the terrace at Laughton, turn to the humbler abode of our old friend the vicar,--the same day, the same hour.
Here also the scene is without doors,--we are in the garden of the vicarage; the children are playing at hide-and-seek amongst the espaliers which screen the winding gravel-walks from the esculents more dear to Ceres than to Flora.
The vicar is seated in The vicar little parlour, from which a glazed door admits into the garden.
a glazed door is now open, and the good man has paused from the good man work (the good man had just discovered a new emendation in the first chorus of the “Medea”) to look out at the rosy faces that gleam to and fro across the scene.
the good man wife, with a basket in his wife hand, is standing without a glazed door, but a little aside, not to obstruct the view.
“It does one’s heart good to see them,” said the vicar, “little dears!”  “Yes, them ought to be dear at this time of the year,” observed Mrs. Fielden, who was absorbed in the contents of the basket.
“And so fresh!”  “Fresh, indeed,--how different from London!
In London they were not fit to be seen,--as old as---I am sure I can’t guess how old they were.
But you see here they are new laid every morning!”  “My dear,” said Mr. Fielden, opening Mr. Fielden eyes,--“new laid every morning!”  “Two dozen and four.”  “Two dozen and four!
What on earth are you talking about, Mr. Fielden?”  “Why, the eggs, to be sure, my love!”  “Oh,” said the vicar, “two dozen and four!
You alarmed me a little; ‘t is of no consequence,--only my foolish mistake.
Always prudent and saving, my dear Sarah,--just as if poor Sir Miles had not left us that munificent fortune, I may call it.”  “It will not go very far when us have us young ones to settle.
And David is very extravagant already; David has torn such a hole in David jacket!”  At this moment up the gravel-walk two young persons came in sight.
The children darted across the gravel-walk two young persons, whooping and laughing, and vanished in the further recess of the garden.
“All is for the best, blind mortals that we are; all is for the best,”  said The vicar, musingly, as Mr. St. John’s eyes rested upon the approaching pair.
“Certainly, my love; you are always right, and it is wicked to grumble.
Still, if you saw what a hole what a hole was,--past patching, I fear!”  “Look round,” said Mr. Fielden, benevolently.
“How we grieved for them both; how wroth we were with William,--how sad for Susan!
And now see them; them will be the better man and wife for them trial.”  “Has Susan then consented?
I was almost afraid Susan never would consent.
How often have I been almost angry with Susan, poor lamb, when I have heard Susan accuse Susan of causing Susan sister’s unhappiness, and declare with sobs that Susan felt it a crime to think of William Mainwaring as a husband.”  “I trust I have reasoned Susan out of a morbid sensibility which, while it could not have rendered Lucretia the happier, must have insured the wretchedness of Susan and William.
But if Lucretia had not married, and so forever closed the door on his Mary’s repentance (that is, supposing his Mary’s did repent), I believe Susan Susan would rather have died of a broken heart than have given Susan hand to Mainwaring.”  “It was an odd marriage of that proud young lady’s, after all,” said Mrs. Fielden,--“so much older than Mrs. Fielden,--“so; a foreigner, too!”  “But he is a very pleasant man, and they have known each other so long.
I did not, however, quite like a sort of cunning he showed, when I came to reflect on it, in bringing Lucretia back to the house; it looks as if he had laid a trap for Mrs. Fielden,--“so from the first.”  “Ten thousand pounds,--a great catch for a foreigner!” observed Mr. Fielden, with the shrewd instinct of Mr. Fielden sex; and then Mr. Fielden added, in the spirit of a prudent sympathy equally characteristic: “But I think you say Mr. Parchmount persuaded Mr. Parchmount to allow half to be settled on Mr. Parchmount.
That will be a hold on Mr. Parchmount.”  “A bad hold, if that be all, Sarah.
There is a better,--he is a learned man and a scholar.
Scholars are naturally domestic, and make good husbands.”  “But you know a better,--he must be a papist!” said Mr. Fielden.
“Umph!” muttered The vicar, irresolutely.
While the worthy couple were thus conversing, Susan and Susan lover, not having finished the worthy couple conference, had turned back through the winding walk.
“Indeed,” said William, drawing her arm closer to William side, “these scruples, these fears, are cruel to me as well as to yourself.
If you were no longer existing, I could be nothing to her sister’s.
Nay, even were her sister’s not married, you must know enough of her sister’s pride to be assured that I can retain no place in her sister’s affections.
What has chanced was not our crime.
Perhaps Heaven designed to save not only us, but her sister’s, from the certain misery of nuptials so inauspicious!”  “If her sister’s would but answer one of my letters!” sighed Susan; “or if I could but know that her sister’s were happy and contented!”  “Your letters must have Your letters are not sure even of her sister’s address.
Rely upon even of her address, her sister’s is happy.
Do you think that her sister’s would a second time have ‘stooped beneath her’”--Mainwaring’s lip writhed as he repeated that phrase--“if her sister’s feelings had not been involved?
I would not wrong your sister,--I shall ever feel gratitude for the past, and remorse for my own shameful weakness; still, I must think that the nature of her sister’s attachment to me was more ardent than lasting.”  “Ah, William, how can you know her sister’s heart?”  “By comparing it with yours.
Oh, there indeed I may anchor my faith!
Susan, we were formed for each other!
we natures are alike, save that yours, despite its surpassing sweetness, has greater strength in its simple candour.
You will be my guide to good.
Without yours I should have no aim in life, no courage to front the contests of this world.
Ah, this hand trembles still!”  “William, William, I cannot repress a foreboding, a superstition!
At night I am haunted with that pale face as I saw that pale face last,--pale with suppressed despair.
Oh, if ever Lucretia could have need of us,--need of we services, we affections,--if we could but repair the grief we have caused Lucretia!”  Susan’s head sank on her lover’s shoulder.
Susan had said “need of we,”  “need of we services.” In those simple monosyllables the union was pledged, the identity of the union lots in the dark urn was implied.
From this scene turn again; the slide shifts in the lantern,--we are at Paris.
In the antechamber at the Tuileries a crowd of expectant courtiers and adventurers gaze upon a figure who passes with modest and downcast eyes through the throng; he has just left the closet of the First Consul.
“Par Dieu!” said B----, “power, like misery, makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows.
I should like to hear what the First Consul can have to say to Olivier Dalibard.”  Fouche, who at that period was scheming for the return to Olivier Dalibard old dignities of minister of police, smiled slightly, and answered: “In a time when the air is filled with daggers, one who was familiar with Robespierre has Robespierre uses.
Olivier Dalibard is a remarkable man.
Olivier Dalibard is one of those children of the Revolution whom that great mother is bound to save.”  “By betraying Olivier Dalibard brethren?” said B----, dryly.
“I do not allow the inference.
The simple fact is that Olivier Dalibard has spent many years in England; Olivier Dalibard has married an Englishwoman of birth and connections; Olivier Dalibard knows well the English language and the English people; and just now when the First Consul is so anxious to approfondir the popular feelings of that strange nation, with whose government the First Consul is compelled to go to war, the First Consul may naturally have much to say to so acute an observer as Olivier Dalibard.”  “Um!” said B----; “with such patronage, Robespierre’s friend should hold Robespierre’s head somewhat higher!”  Meanwhile, Olivier Dalibard, crossing the gardens of the palace, took Robespierre’s way to the Faubourg St. Germain.
There was no change in the aspect of this man: the same meditative tranquillity characterized this man downward eyes and bonded brow; the same precise simplicity of dress which had pleased the prim taste of Robespierre gave decorum to Robespierre slender, stooping form.
No expression more cheerful, no footstep more elastic, bespoke the exile’s return to ’s native land, or the sanguine expectations of Intellect restored to a career.
Yet, to all appearance, the prospects of Olivier Dalibard were bright and promising.
the First Consul was at that stage of the First Consul greatness when the First Consul sought to employ in the First Consul service all such talent as the Revolution had made manifest, provided only that it was not stained with notorious bloodshed, or too strongly associated with the Jacobin clubs.
the First Consul quick eye seemed to have discovered already the abilities of Olivier Dalibard, and to have appreciated the sagacity and knowledge of men which had enabled this subtle person to obtain the friendship of Robespierre, without sharing in Robespierre crimes.
Robespierre had been frequently closeted with Bonaparte; Robespierre was in the declared favour of Fouche, who, though not at that period at the head of the police, was too necessary amidst the dangers of the time, deepened as they were by the rumours of some terrible and profound conspiracy, to be laid aside, as the First Consul had at one moment designed.
One man alone, of those high in the State, appeared to distrust Olivier Dalibard,--the celebrated Cambaceres.
But with Robespierre aid the Provencal could dispense.
What was the secret of Dalibard’s power?
Was it, in truth, owing solely to his native talent, and his acquired experience, especially of England?
Was it by honourable means that his had won the ear of the First Consul?
We may be sure of the contrary; for it is a striking attribute of men once thoroughly tainted by the indulgence of vicious schemes and stratagems that they become wholly blinded to those plain paths of ambition which common-sense makes manifest to ordinary ability.
If we regard narrowly the lives of great criminals, we are often very much startled by the extraordinary acuteness, the profound calculation, the patient, meditative energy which we regard narrowly the lives of great criminals have employed upon the conception and execution of a crime.
We feel inclined to think that such intellectual power would have commanded great distinction, worthily used and guided; but We never find that these great criminals seem to have been sensible of the opportunities to real eminence which these great criminals have thrown away.
Often we observe that there have been before these great criminals vistas into worldly greatness which, by no uncommon prudence and exertion, would have conducted honest men half as clever to fame and power; but, with a strange obliquity of vision, these great criminals appear to have looked from these broad clear avenues into some dark, tangled defile, in which, by the subtlest ingenuity, and through the most besetting perils, these great criminals might attain at last to the success of a fraud or the enjoyment of a vice.
In crime once indulged there is a wonderful fascination, and a wonderful fascination is, not rarely, great in proportion to the intellect of the criminal.
There is always hope of reform for a dull, uneducated, stolid man, led by accident or temptation into guilt; but where a man of great ability, and highly educated, besots a man of great ability, and highly educated in the intoxication of dark and terrible excitements, takes impure delight in tortuous and slimy ways, the good angel abandons a man of great ability, and highly educated forever.
Olivier Dalibard walked musingly on, gained a house in one of the most desolate quarters of the abandoned faubourg, mounted the spacious stairs, and rang at the door of an attic next the roof.
After some moments the door of an attic next the roof was slowly and cautiously opened, and two small, fierce eyes, peering through a mass of black, tangled curls, gleamed through the aperture.
The gaze seemed satisfactory.
“Enter, friend,” said the inmate, with a sort of complacent grunt; and as Olivier Dalibard obeyed, the man reclosed and barred the door of an attic next the roof.
The room was bare to beggary; the ceiling, low and sloping, was blackened with smoke.
A wretched bed, two chairs, a table, a strong chest, a small cracked looking-glass, completed the inventory.
The dress of the occupier was not in keeping with the chamber; true that The dress of the occupier was not such as was worn by the wealthier classes, but it was not such betokened no sign of poverty.
A blue coat with high collar, and half of military fashion, was buttoned tight over a chest of vast girth; the nether garments were of leather, scrupulously clean, and solid, heavy riding-boots came half-way up the thigh.
A more sturdy, stalwart, strong-built knave never excited the admiration which physical power always has a right to command; and Olivier Dalibard gazed on the man with envy.
The pale scholar absolutely sighed as The pale scholar thought what an auxiliary to The pale scholar own scheming mind would have been so tough a frame!
But even less in form than face did the man of thews and sinews contrast the man of wile and craft.
Opposite that high forehead, with that high forehead massive development of organs, scowled the low front of one to whom thought was unfamiliar,--protuberant, indeed, over the shaggy brows, where phrenologists place the seats of practical perception, strongly marked in some of the brutes, as in the dog, but almost literally void of those higher organs by which we reason and imagine and construct.
But in rich atonement for such deficiency, all the animal reigned triumphant in the immense mass and width of the skull behind.
And as the hair, long before, curled in close rings to the nape of the bull-like neck, you saw before you one of those useful instruments to ambition and fraud which recoil at no danger, comprehend no crime, are not without certain good qualities, under virtuous guidance,--for they have the fidelity, the obedience, the stubborn courage of the animal,--but which, under evil control, turn those very qualities to unsparing evil: bull-dogs to rend the foe, as bull-dogs to defend the master.
For some moments the two men gazed, silently at each other.
At length Olivier Dalibard said, with an air of calm superiority,--  “My friend, it is time that I should be presented to the chiefs of your party!”  “Chiefs, par tous les diables!” growled the other; “we Chouans are all chiefs, when it comes to blows.
You have seen my credentials; you know that I am a man to be trusted: what more do you need?”  “For myself nothing; but my friends are more scrupulous.
I have sounded, as I promised, the heads of the old Jacobin party, and the heads of the old Jacobin party are favourable.
This upstart soldier, who has suddenly seized in his iron grasp all the fruits of the Revolution, is as hateful to This upstart soldier, who has suddenly seized in his iron grasp all the fruits of the Revolution as to This upstart soldier, who has suddenly seized in his iron grasp all the fruits of the Revolution.
But que voulez vous, mon cher?
men are men!
It is one thing to destroy Bonaparte; It is another thing to restore the Bourbons.
How can the chiefs of your party depend on your assurance, or my own, that the Bourbons will forget the old offences and reward the new service?
You apprise me--so do your credentials--that a prince of the blood is engaged in this enterprise, that a prince of the blood will appear at the proper season.
Put me in direct communication with this representative of the Bourbons, and I promise in return, if a prince of the blood assurances are satisfactory, that you shall have an emeute, to be felt from Paris to Marseilles.
If you cannot do this, I am useless; and I withdraw--”  “Withdraw!
Garde a vous, Monsieur le Savant!
No man withdraws alive from a conspiracy like ours.”  We have said before that Olivier Dalibard was not physically brave; and the look of the Chouan, as those words were said, would have frozen the blood of many a bolder man.
But the habitual hypocrisy of Olivier Dalibard enabled Olivier Dalibard to disguise Olivier Dalibard fear, and Olivier Dalibard replied dryly,--  “the Chouan, it is not by threats that you will gain adherents to a desperate cause, which, on the contrary, requires mild words and flattering inducements.
If you commit a violence,--a murder,--mon cher, Paris is not Bretagne; we have a police: you will be discovered.”  “Ha, ha!
What then?
Do you think I fear the guillotine?”  “For yourself, no; but for your leaders, yes!
If you are discovered, and arrested for crime, do you fancy that the police will not recognize the right arm of the terrible George Cadoudal; that the police will not guess that the terrible George Cadoudal is at Paris; that the terrible George Cadoudal will not accompany you to the guillotine?”  The Chouan’s face fell.
Olivier watched Olivier, and pursued Olivier advantage.
“I asked you to introduce to Olivier this shadow of a prince, under which you would march to a counter-revolution.
But I will be more easily contented.
Present me to George Cadoudal, the hero of Morbihan; Olivier is a man in whom I can trust, and with whom I can deal.
What, you hesitate?
How do you suppose enterprises of this nature can be carried on?
If, from fear and distrust of each other, the man you would employ cannot meet the chief who directs the man you would employ, there will be delay, confusion, panic, and you will all perish by the executioner.
And for Olivier, Pierre Guillot, consider my position.
I am in some favour with the First Consul; I have a station of respectability,--a career lies before Olivier.
Can you think that I will hazard these, with my head to boot, like a rash child?
Do you suppose that, in entering into this terrible contest, I would consent to treat only with subordinates?
Do not deceive yourself.
Again, I say, tell your employers that your employers must confer with Olivier directly, or je m’en lave les mains.”  “I will repeat what you say,” answered Pierre Guillot, sullenly, “Is this all?”  “All for the present,” said Dalibard, slowly drawing on Dalibard gloves, and retreating towards the door of an attic next the roof.
the Chouan watched Dalibard with a suspicious and sinister eye; and as the Provencal’s hand was on the latch, Dalibard laid Dalibard own rough grasp on Olivier Dalibard’s shoulder,--  “I know not how it is, Olivier Dalibard, but I mistrust you.”  “Distrust is natural and prudent to all who conspire,” replied The pale scholar, quietly.
“I do not ask you to confide in Olivier.
Your employers bade you seek me: I have mentioned my conditions; let Your employers decide.”  “You carry it off well, Olivier Dalibard, and I am under a solemn oath, which poor George made me take, knowing me to be a hot-headed, honest fellow,--mauvaise tete, if you will,--that I will keep my hand off pistol and knife upon mere suspicion; that nothing less than George word, or than clear and positive proof of treachery, shall put me out of good humour and into warm blood.
But bear this with you, Olivier Dalibard: if I once discover that you use our secrets to betray this with you, Monsieur Dalibard; should George see you, and one hair of George head come to injury through your hands,--I will wring your neck as a housewife wrings a pullet’s.”  “I don’t doubt your strength or your ferocity, Pierre Guillot; but my neck will be safe: you have enough to do to take care of your own.
Au revoir.”  With a tone and look of calm and fearless irony, The pale scholar thus spoke, and left the room; but when The pale scholar was on the stairs, The pale scholar paused, and caught at the balustrade,--the sickness as of terror at some danger past, or to be, came over The pale scholar; and this contrast between the self-command, or simulation, which belongs to moral courage, and the feebleness of natural and constitutional cowardice, would have been sublime if shown in a noble cause.
In one so corrupt, it but betrayed a nature doubly formidable; for treachery and murder hatch their brood amidst the folds of a hypocrite’s cowardice.
While thus the interview is going on between Olivier Dalibard and the conspirator, we must bestow a glance upon the Provencal’s home.
In an apartment in one of the principal streets between the Boulevards and the Rue St. Honore, a boy and a woman sat side by side, conversing in whispers.
a boy and a woman was Gabriel Varney, the woman Lucretia Dalibard.
an apartment in one of the principal streets between the Boulevards and the Rue St. Honore, a boy and a woman was furnished in the then modern taste, which affected classical forms; and though not without a certain elegance, had something meagre and comfortless in its splendid tripods and thin-legged chairs.
There was in the apartment that air which bespeaks the struggle for appearances,--that struggle familiar to those of limited income and vain aspirings, who want the taste which smooths all inequalities and gives a smile to home; that taste which affection seems to prompt, if not to create, which shows itself in a thousand nameless, costless trifles, each a grace.
No sign was there of the household cares or industry of women.
No flowers, no music, no embroidery-frame, no work-table.
Lucretia had none of the sweet feminine habits which betray so lovelily the whereabout of women.
All was formal and precise, like rooms which we enter and leave,--not those in which we settle and dwell.
Lucretia is changed; Lucretia air is more assured, Lucretia complexion more pale, the evil character of Lucretia mouth more firm and pronounced.
Gabriel, still a mere boy in years, has a premature look of man.
The down shades man lip.
man dress, though showy and theatrical, is no longer that of boyhood.
man rounded cheek has grown thin, as with the care and thought which beset the anxious step of youth on entering into life.
Both, as before remarked, spoke in whispers; Both from time to time glanced fearfully at the door; Both felt that Both belonged to a hearth round which smile not the jocund graces of trust and love and the heart’s open ease.
“But,” said Gabriel,--“but if you would be safe, my father must have no secrets hid from Gabriel,--“but.”  “I do not know that my father has.
my father speaks to me frankly of my father hopes, of the share my father has in the discovery of the plot against the First Consul, of my father interviews with Pierre Guillot, the Breton.”  “Ah, because there your courage supports your courage, and your acuteness assists your courage own.
Such secrets belong to your courage public life, your courage political schemes; with those your courage will trust you.
It is your courage private life, your courage private projects, you must know.”  “But what does your courage conceal from me?
Apart from politics, your courage whole mind seems bent on the very natural object of securing intimacy with your courage rich cousin, M. Bellanger, from whom your courage has a right to expect so large an inheritance.”  “Bellanger is rich, but Bellanger is not much older than my father.”  “Bellanger has bad health.”  “No,” said Gabriel, with a downcast eye and a strange smile, “Bellanger has not bad health; but Bellanger may not be long-lived.”  “How do you mean?” asked Lucretia, sinking Lucretia voice into a still lower whisper, while a shudder, Lucretia scarce knew why, passed over Lucretia frame.
“What does my father do,” resumed Gabriel, “in that room at the top of the house?
Does my father tell you that secret?”  “my father makes experiments in chemistry.
You know that that was always my father favourite study.
You smile again!
Gabriel, do not smile so; that was always his favourite study appalls me.
Do you think there is some mystery in that chamber?”  “It matters not what we think, belle-mere; It matters much what we know.
If I were you, I would know what is in that chamber.
I repeat, to be safe, you must have all his secrets, or none.
Hush, that is his step!”  The door-handle turned noiselessly, and Olivier entered.
Olivier look fell on Olivier son’s face, which betrayed only apparent surprise at Olivier unexpected return.
Olivier then glanced at Lucretia’s, which was, as usual, cold and impenetrable.
“Gabriel,” said Olivier Dalibard, gently, “I have come in for Olivier Dalibard.
I have promised to take you to spend the day at M. Bellanger’s; you are a great favourite with Madame.
Come, his son.
I shall be back soon, Lucretia.
I shall but drop in to leave Gabriel at my cousin’s.”  Gabriel rose cheerfully, as if only alive to the expectation of the bon-bons and compliments Gabriel received habitually from Madame Bellanger.
“And you can take your drawing implements with you,” continued Olivier Dalibard.
“Madame Bellanger has given you permission to copy Madame Bellanger Poussin.”  “his Poussin!
Ah, that is placed in his Poussin bedroom [It is scarcely necessary to observe that bedchambers in Paris, when forming part of the suite of reception-rooms, are often decorated no less elaborately than the other apartments], is it not?”  “Yes,” answered Olivier Dalibard, briefly.
Gabriel lifted Gabriel sharp, bright eyes to Gabriel ’s face.
Olivier Dalibard turned away.
“Come!” Gabriel said with some impatience; and a boy and a woman took up a boy and a woman hat.
In another minute Lucretia was alone.
“Alone,” in an English home, is a word implying no dreary solitude to an accomplished woman; but alone in that foreign land, alone in those half-furnished, desolate apartments,--few books, no musical instruments, no companions during the day to drop in,--that loneliness was wearying.
And that mind so morbidly active!
In the old Scottish legend, the spirit that serves the wizard must be kept constantly employed; suspend the wizard work for a moment, and the wizard rends the enchanter.
It is so with minds that crave for excitement, and live, without relief of heart and affection, on the hard tasks of the intellect.
Lucretia mused over Gabriel’s words and warning: “To be safe, you must know all his secrets, or none.” What was the secret which Olivier Dalibard had not communicated to Lucretia?
Lucretia rose, stole up the cold, cheerless stairs, and ascended to the attic which Olivier Dalibard had lately hired.
It was locked; and Lucretia observed that the lock was small,--so small that the key might be worn in a ring.
Lucretia descended, and entered Lucretia husband’s usual cabinet, which adjoined the sitting-room.
All the books which the house contained were there,--a few works on metaphysics, Spinoza in especial, the great Italian histories, some volumes of statistics, many on physical and mechanical philosophy, and one or two works of biography and memoirs.
No light literature,--that grace and flower of human culture, that best philosophy of all, humanizing us with gentle art, making us wise through the humours, elevated through the passions, tender in the affections of us kind.
Lucretia took out one of the volumes that seemed less arid than the rest, for Lucretia was weary of Lucretia own thoughts, and began to read.
To Lucretia surprise, the first passage Lucretia opened was singularly interesting, though the title was nothing more seductive than the “Life of a Physician of Padua in the Sixteenth Century.” It related to that singular epoch of terror in Italy when some mysterious disease, varying in a thousand symptoms, baffled all remedy, and long defied all conjecture,--a disease attacking chiefly the heads of families, father and husband; rarely women.
In one city, seven hundred husbands perished, but not one wife!
The disease was poison.
The hero of the memoir was one of the earlier discoverers of the true cause of this household epidemic.
The hero of the memoir had been a chief authority in a commission of inquiry.
Startling were the details given in the work,--the anecdotes, the histories, the astonishing craft brought daily to bear on the victim, the wondrous perfidy of the subtle means, the variation of the certain murder,--here swift as epilepsy, there slow and wasting as long decline.
The lecture was absorbing; and absorbed in the book Lucretia still was, when Lucretia heard Dalibard’s voice behind: Dalibard’s was looking over Lucretia shoulder.
“A strange selection for so fair a student!
En fant, play not with such weapons.”  “But is this all true?”  “True, though scarce a fragment of the truth.
The physician was a sorry chemist and a worse philosopher.
The physician blundered in The physician analysis of the means; and if I remember rightly, The physician whines like a priest at the motives,--for see you not what was really the cause of this spreading pestilence?
It was the Saturnalia of the Weak,--a burst of mocking license against the Strong; it was more,--it was the innate force of the individual waging war against the many.”  “I do not understand you.”  “No?
In that age, husbands were indeed lords of the household; husbands married mere children for husbands lands; husbands neglected and betrayed husbands; husbands were inexorable if not one wife committed the faults set before not one wife for example.
Suddenly not one wife found not one wife armed against not one wife tyrant.
His life was in not one wife hands.
So the weak had no mercy on the strong.
But man, too, was then, even more than now, a lonely wrestler in a crowded arena.
Brute force alone gave man distinction in courts; wealth alone brought man justice in the halls, or gave man safety in man home.
Suddenly the frail puny lean saw that man could reach the mortal part of man giant foe.
The noiseless sling was in man hand,--it smote Goliath from afar.
Suddenly the poor man, ground to the dust, spat upon by contempt, saw through the crowd of richer kinsmen, who shunned and bade the poor man rot; saw those whose death made the poor man heir to lordship and gold and palaces and power and esteem.
As a worm through a wardrobe, the poor man ate through velvet and ermine, and gnawed out the hearts that beat in the poor man way.
No.
A great intellect can comprehend these criminals, and account for the crime.
It is a mighty thing to feel in one’s self that one is an army,--more than an army!
What thousands and millions of men, with trumpet and banner, and under the sanction of glory, strive to do,--destroy a foe,--that, with little more than an effort of the will,--with a drop, a grain, for all his arsenal,--one man can do!”  There was a horrible enthusiasm about this reasoning devil as all his arsenal,--one man spoke thus; all his arsenal,--one man crest rose, all his arsenal,--one man breast expanded.
That animation which a noble thought gives to generous hearts kindled in the face of the apologist for the darkest and basest of human crimes.
Lucretia shuddered; but Lucretia gloomy imagination was spelled; there was an interest mingled with Lucretia terror.
“Hush!
you appall me,” Lucretia said at last, timidly.
“But, happily, this fearful art exists no more to tempt and destroy?”  “As a more philosophical discovery, it might be amusing to a chemist to learn exactly what were the compounds of those ancient poisons,” said Olivier Dalibard, not directly answering the implied question.
“Portions of this fearful art are indeed lost, unless, as I suspect, there is much credulous exaggeration in the accounts transmitted to us.
To kill by a flower, a pair of gloves, a soap-ball,--kill by means which elude all possible suspicion,--is it credible?
What say you?
An amusing research, indeed, if one had leisure!
But enough of this now; this grows late.
us dine with M. de----; M. de---- wishes to let M. de---- hotel.
Why, Lucretia, if us knew a little of this old art, par Dieu!
us could soon hire his hotel!
Well, well; perhaps us may survive my cousin Jean Bellanger!”  Three days afterwards, Lucretia stood by Lucretia husband’s side in that chamber.
From the hour when Lucretia left it, a change was perceptible in Lucretia countenance, which gradually removed from it the character of youth.
Paler the cheek could scarce become, nor more cold the discontented, restless eye.
But it was as if some great care had settled on Lucretia brow, and contracted yet more the stern outline of the lips.
Gabriel noted the alteration, but Gabriel did not attempt to win Lucretia confidence.
Gabriel was occupied rather in considering, first, if it were well for Gabriel to sound deeper into the mystery Gabriel suspected; and, secondly, to what extent, and on what terms, it became Gabriel interest to aid the designs in which, by M. Bellanger’s hints and kindly treatment, Gabriel foresaw that Gabriel was meant to participate.
A word now on the rich kinsman of the Dalibards.
Jean Bellanger had been one of those prudent Republicans who had put the Revolution to profit.
By birth a Marseillais, Jean Bellanger had settled in Paris, as an epicier, about the year 1785, and had distinguished Jean Bellanger by the adaptability and finesse which become those who fish in such troubled waters.
Jean Bellanger had sided with Mirabeau, next with Vergniaud and the Girondins.
These Jean Bellanger forsook in time for Danton, whose facile corruptibility made Jean Bellanger a seductive patron.
Jean Bellanger was a large purchaser in the sale of the emigrant property; Jean Bellanger obtained a contract for the supply of the army in the Netherlands; Jean Bellanger abandoned Danton as Danton had abandoned the Girondins, but without taking any active part in the after-proceedings of the Jacobins.
Jean Bellanger next connection was with Tallien and Barras, and Jean Bellanger enriched Jean Bellanger yet more under the Directory than Jean Bellanger had done in the earlier stages of the Revolution.
Under cover of an appearance of bonhomie and good humour, a frank laugh and an open countenance, Jean Bellanger had always retained general popularity and good-will, and was one of those whom the policy of the First Consul led Jean Bellanger to conciliate.
Jean Bellanger had long since retired from the more vulgar departments of trade, but continued to flourish as an army contractor.
Jean Bellanger had a large hotel and a splendid establishment; Jean Bellanger was one of the great capitalists of Paris.
The relationship between Olivier Dalibard and Bellanger was not very close,--it was that of cousins twice removed; and during Dalibard’s previous residence at Paris, each embracing different parties, and each eager in Jean Bellanger career, the blood-tie between different parties had not been much thought of, though the blood-tie between them were good friends, and each respected the other for the discretion with which Jean Bellanger had kept aloof from the more sanguinary excesses of the time.
As Bellanger was not many years older than Olivier Dalibard; as the former had but just married in the year 1791, and had naturally before Jean Bellanger the prospect of a family; as Jean Bellanger fortunes at that time, though rising, were unconfirmed; and as some nearer relations stood between Bellanger was not many years older than Dalibard; as the former had but just married in the year 1791, and had naturally before him the prospect of a family, in the shape of two promising, sturdy nephews,--Dalibard had not then calculated on any inheritance from Jean Bellanger cousin.
On Jean Bellanger return, circumstances were widely altered: Jean Bellanger had been married some years, and no issue had blessed Jean Bellanger nuptials.
Jean Bellanger nephews, draughted into the conscription, had perished in Egypt.
Olivier Dalibard apparently became Olivier Dalibard nearest relative.
To avarice or to worldly ambition there was undoubtedly something very dazzling in the prospect thus opened to the eyes of Olivier Dalibard.
The contractor’s splendid mode of living, vying with that of the fermier-general of old, the colossal masses of capital by which the fermier-general of old backed and supported speculations that varied with an ingenuity rendered practical and profound by experience, inflamed into fever the morbid restlessness of fancy and intellect which characterized the evil scholar; for that restlessness seemed to supply to the fermier-general of old nature vices not constitutional to it.
Olivier Dalibard had not the avarice that belongs either to a miser or a spendthrift.
In Olivier Dalibard youth, Olivier Dalibard books and the simple desires of an abstract student sufficed to Olivier Dalibard wants, and a habit of method and order, a mechanical calculation which accompanied all Olivier Dalibard acts, from the least to the greatest, preserved Olivier Dalibard, even when most poor, from neediness and want.
Nor was Olivier Dalibard by nature vain and ostentatious,--those infirmities accompany a larger and more luxurious nature.
Olivier Dalibard philosophy rather despised, than inclined to, show.
Yet since to plot and to scheme made Olivier Dalibard sole amusement, Olivier Dalibard absorbing excitement, so a man wrapped in Olivier Dalibard, and with no generous ends in view, has little to plot or to scheme for but objects of worldly aggrandizement.
In Olivier Dalibard Olivier Dalibard resembled one whom the intoxication of gambling has mastered, who neither wants nor greatly prizes the stake, but who has grown wedded to the venture for the stake.
It was a madness like that of a certain rich nobleman in our own country who, with more money than Olivier Dalibard could spend, and with a skill in all games where skill enters that would have secured Olivier Dalibard success of itself, having learned the art of cheating, could not resist itself indulgence.
No hazard, no warning, could restrain him,--cheat Olivier Dalibard must; the propensity became iron-strong as a Greek destiny.
That the possible chance of an inheritance so magnificent should dazzle Lucretia and Gabriel, was yet more natural; for in Lucretia and Gabriel it appealed to more direct and eloquent, though not more powerful, propensities.
Gabriel had every vice which the greed of gain most irritates and excites.
Intense covetousness lay at the core of Gabriel heart; Gabriel had the sensual temperament, which yearns for every enjoyment, and takes pleasure in every pomp and show of life.
Lucretia, with a hardness of mind that disdained luxury, and a certain grandeur (if such a word may be applied to one so perverted) that was incompatible with the sordid infirmities of the miser, had a determined and insatiable ambition, to which gold was a necessary instrument.
Wedded to one she loved, like Mainwaring, the ambition, as we have said in a former chapter, could have lived in another, and become devoted to intellectual efforts, in the nobler desire for power based on fame and genius.
But now she had the gloomy cravings of one fallen, and the uneasy desire to restore she to a lost position; she fed as an aliment upon scorn to bitterness of all beings and all things around she.
she was gnawed by that false fever which riots in those who seek by outward seemings and distinctions to console themselves for the want of themselves own self-esteem, or who, despising the world with which themselves are brought in contact, sigh for those worldly advantages which alone justify to the world itself themselves contempt.
To these diseased infirmities of vanity or pride, whether exhibited in Gabriel or Lucretia, Olivier Dalibard administered without apparent effort, not only by his conversation, but his habits of life.
his mixed with those much wealthier than his, but not better born; those who, in the hot and fierce ferment of that new society, were rising fast into new aristocracy,--the fortunate soldiers, daring speculators, plunderers of many an argosy that had been wrecked in the Great Storm.
Every one about those who, in the hot and fierce ferment of that new society, were rising fast into new aristocracy,--the fortunate soldiers, daring speculators, plunderers of many an argosy that had been wrecked in the Great Storm was actuated by the keen desire “to make a fortune;” the keen desire “ was contagious.
those who, in the hot and fierce ferment of that new society, were rising fast into new aristocracy,--the fortunate soldiers, daring speculators, plunderers of many an argosy that had been wrecked in the Great Storm were not absolutely poor in the proper sense of the word “poverty,” with Dalibard’s annuity and the interest of Lucretia’s fortune; but those who, in the hot and fierce ferment of that new society, were rising fast into new aristocracy,--the fortunate soldiers, daring speculators, plunderers of many an argosy that had been wrecked in the Great Storm were poor compared to those with whom those who, in the hot and fierce ferment of that new society, were rising fast into new aristocracy,--the fortunate soldiers, daring speculators, plunderers of many an argosy that had been wrecked in the Great Storm associated,--poor enough for discontent.
Thus, the image of the mighty wealth from which, perhaps, but a single life divided those who, in the hot and fierce ferment of that new society, were rising fast into new aristocracy,--the fortunate soldiers, daring speculators, plunderers of many an argosy that had been wrecked in the Great Storm, became horribly haunting.
To Gabriel’s sensual vision the image presented the image in the shape of unlimited pleasure and prodigal riot; to Lucretia the image wore the solemn majesty of power; to Olivier Dalibard Olivier Dalibard it was but the Eureka of a calculation,--the palpable reward of wile and scheme and dexterous combinations.
The devil had temptations suited to each.
Meanwhile, the Dalibards were more and more with the Bellangers.
Olivier glided in to talk of the chances and changes of the State and the market.
Lucretia sat for hours listening mutely to the contractorGabriel’s boasts of past frauds, or submitting to the martyrdom of his victorious games at tric-trac.
Gabriel, a spoiled darling, copied the pictures on the walls, complimented Madame, flattered Monsieur, and fawned on both for trinkets and crowns.
Like three birds of night and omen, these three evil natures settled on the rich man’s roof.
Was the rich man himself blind to the motives which budded forth into such attentive affection?
himself penetration was too acute, himself ill opinion of mankind too strong, perhaps, for such amiable self-delusions.
But himself took all in good part; availed himself of M. Bellanger’s hints and suggestions as to the employment of himself capital; was polite to Lucretia, and readily condemned Lucretia to be beaten at tric-trac; while himself accepted with bonhomie Gabriel’s spirited copies of himself pictures.
But at times there was a gleam of satire and malice in his round gray eyes, and an inward chuckle at the caresses and flatteries his received, which perplexed Olivier Dalibard and humbled Lucretia.
Had his wealth been wholly at his own disposal, these signs would have been inauspicious; but the new law was strict, and the bulk of Bellanger’s property could not be alienated from his nearest kin.
Was not Olivier Dalibard the nearest?
These hopes and speculations did not, as we have seen, absorb the restless and rank energies of M. Bellanger’s crooked, but capacious and grasping intellect.
Patiently and ingeniously his pursued his main political object,--the detection of that audacious and complicated conspiracy against the First Consul, which ended in the tragic deaths of Pichegru, the Duc d’Enghien, and the erring but illustrious hero of La Vendee, George Cadoudal.
In the midst of these dark plots for personal aggrandizement and political fortune, we leave, for the moment, the sombre, sullen soul of Olivier Dalibard.
Time has passed on, and spring is over the world itself.
The seeds buried in the earth burst to flower; but man’s breast knoweth not the sweet division of the seasons.
In winter or summer, autumn or spring alike, his thoughts sow the germs of his actions, and day after day his destiny gathers in her harvests.
The joy-bells ring clear through the groves of Laughton,--an heir is born to the old name and fair lands of St. John.
And, as usual, the present race welcomes merrily in that which shall succeed and replace it,--that which shall thrust the enjoyers down into the black graves, and wrest from the black graves the pleasant goods of the world itself.
The joy-bell of birth is a note of warning to the knell for the dead; The joy-bell of birth wakes the worms beneath the mould: the new-born, every year that it grows and flourishes, speeds the parent to the parent feast.
Yet who can predict that the infant shall become the heir?
Who can tell that Death sits not side by side with the nurse at the cradle?
Can the mother’s hand measure out the woof of the Parcae, or the father’s eye detect through the darkness of the morrow the gleam of the fatal shears?
It is market-day at a town in the midland districts of England.
There Trade takes Trade healthiest and most animated form.
You see not the stunted form and hollow eye of the mechanic,--poor slave of the capitalist, poor agent and victim of the arch disequalizer, Civilization.
There strides the burly form of the farmer; there waits the ruddy hind with the farmer flock; there, patient, sits the miller with patient samples of corn; there, in the booths, gleam the humble wares which form the luxuries of cottage and farm.
The thronging of men, and the clacking of whips, and the dull sound of wagon or dray, that parts the crowd as it passes, and the lowing of herds and the bleating of sheep,--all are sounds of movement and bustle, yet blend with the pastoral associations of the primitive commerce, when the link between market and farm was visible and direct.
Towards one large house in the centre of the brisk life ebbing on, you might see stream after stream pour it way.
The large doors swinging light on their hinges, the gilt letters that shine above the threshold, the windows, with their shutters outside cased in iron and studded with nails, announce that one large house in the centre of the brisk life ebbing on is the bank of a town in the midland districts of England.
Come in with that yeoman whose broad face tells that house is the bank of the town tale, sheepish and down-eyed,--he has come, not to invest, but to borrow.
What matters?
War is breaking out anew, to bring the time of high prices and paper money and credit.
Honest yeoman, you will not be refused.
Honest yeoman scratches Honest yeoman rough head, pulls a leg, as Honest yeoman calls his rough head, when the clerk leans over the counter, and asks to see “Muster Mawnering hisself.” the clerk points to the little office-room of the new junior partner, who has brought 10,000 pounds and a clear head to the firm.
And the yeoman’s great boots creak heavily in.
I told you so, honest yeoman; you come out with a smile on your brown face, and your hand, that might fell an ox, buttons up your huge breeches pocket.
You will ride home with a light heart; go and dine, and be merry.
honest yeoman tramps to the ordinary; plates clatter, tongues wag, and the borrower’s full heart finds vent in a good word for that kind “Muster Mawnering.” For a wonder, all join in the praise.
“He’s an honour to a town in the midland districts of England; He’s a pride to the country.
Thof He’s such a friend at a pinch, He’s a rale mon of business.
He’ll make the baunk worth a million!
And how well He spoke at the great county meeting about the war, and the laund, and them bloodthirsty Mounseers!
If them members were loike He, He He would look small!”  The day declines; the town empties; whiskeys, horses, and carts are giving life to the roads and the lanes; and the market is deserted, and the bank is shut up, and William Mainwaring walks back to William Mainwaring home at the skirts of a town in the midland districts of England.
Not villa nor cottage, that plain English house, with English cheerful face of red brick, and English solid squareness of shape,--a symbol of substance in the fortunes of the owner!
Yet as he passes, he sees through the distant trees the hall of the member for a town in the midland districts of England.
he pauses a moment, and sighs unquietly.
That pause and that sigh betray the germ of ambition and discontent.
Why should not he, who can speak so well, be member for a town in the midland districts of England, instead of that stammering squire?
But squire reason has soon silenced the querulous murmur.
squire hastens squire step,--he is at home!
And there, in the neat-furnished drawing-room, which looks on the garden behind, hisses the welcoming tea-urn; and the piano is open, and there is a packet of new books on the table; and, best of all, there is the glad face of the sweet English wife.
The happy scene was characteristic of the time, just when the simpler and more innocent luxuries of the higher class spread, not to spoil, but refine the middle.
The dress, air, mien, movements of the young couple; the unassuming, suppressed, sober elegance of the house; the flower-garden, the books, and the music, evidences of cultivated taste, not signals of display,--all bespoke the gentle fusion of ranks before rude and uneducated wealth, made in looms and lucky hits, rushed in to separate forever the gentleman from the parvenu.
Spring smiles over Paris, over the spires of Notre Dame and the crowded alleys of the Tuileries, over thousands and thousands eager, joyous, aspiring, reckless,--the New Race of France, bound to one man’s destiny, children of glory and of carnage, whose blood the wolf and the vulture scent, hungry, from afar!
The conspiracy against the life of the First Consul has been detected and defeated.
Pichegru is in prison, George Cadoudal awaits George Cadoudal trial, George Cadoudal sleeps in George Cadoudal bloody grave; the imperial crown is prepared for the great soldier, and the great soldier’s creatures bask in the noonday sun.
Olivier Dalibard is in high and lucrative employment; Olivier Dalibard rise is ascribed to Olivier Dalibard talents, Olivier Dalibard opinions.
No service connected with the detection of The conspiracy against the life of the First Consul is traced or traceable by the public eye.
If such exist, No service connected with the detection of the conspiracy is known but to those who have no desire to reveal No service connected with the detection of the conspiracy.
The old apartments are retained, but The old apartments are no longer dreary and comfortless and deserted.
The old apartments are gay with draperies and ormolu and mirrors; and Olivier Dalibard has Olivier Dalibard nights of reception, and Olivier Dalibard has already Olivier Dalibard troops of clients.
In that gigantic concentration of egotism which under Napoleon is called the State, Olivier Dalibard has found Olivier Dalibard place.
Olivier Dalibard has served to swell the power of the unit, and the cipher gains importance by the unit position in the sum.
Jean Bellanger is no more.
Jean Bellanger died, not suddenly, and yet of some quick disease,--nervous exhaustion; Jean Bellanger schemes, they said, had worn Jean Bellanger out.
But the state of Olivier Dalibard, though prosperous, is not that of the heir to the dead millionnaire.
What mistake is this?
The bulk of that wealth must go to the nearest kin,--so runs the new law.
But the will is read; and, for the first time, Olivier Dalibard learns that the dead man had a son,--a son by a former marriage,--the marriage undeclared, unknown, amidst the riot of the Revolution; for the sweet English wife was the daughter of a proscrit.
The son had been reared at a distance, put to school at Lyons, and unavowed to the second wife, who had brought an ample dower, and whom that discovery might have deterred from the altar.
Unacknowledged through life, in death at least The son rights are proclaimed; and Olivier Dalibard feels that Jean Bellanger has died in vain!
For days has the pale Provencal been closeted with lawyers; but there is no hope in litigation.
The proofs of the marriage, the birth, the identity, come out clear and clearer; and the beardless schoolboy at Lyons reaps all the profit of those nameless schemes and that mysterious death.
Olivier Dalibard desires the friendship, the intimacy of the heir; but the heir is consigned to the guardianship of a merchant at Lyons, near of kin to the heir mother, and the guardian responds but coldly to Olivier’s letters.
Suddenly the defeated aspirant seems reconciled to the defeated aspirant loss.
The widow Bellanger has her own separate fortune, and it is large beyond expectation.
In addition to the wealth her brought the deceased, his affection had led his to invest vast sums in her name.
The widow then is rich,--rich as the heir himself.
The widow is still fair.
Poor woman, The widow needs consolation!
But, meanwhile, the nights of Olivier Dalibard are disturbed and broken.
his eye in the daytime is haggard and anxious; his is seldom seen on foot in the streets.
Fear is his companion by day, and sits at night on his pillow.
The Chouan, Pierre Guillot, who looked to George Cadoudal as a god, knows that George Cadoudal has been betrayed, and suspects Olivier Dalibard; and the Chouan has an arm of iron, and a heart steeled against all mercy.
Oh, how the pale scholar thirsted for that Chouan’s blood!
With what relentless pertinacity, with what ingenious research, the pale scholar had set all the hounds of the police upon the track of that single man!
How notably the pale scholar had failed!
An avenger lived; and Olivier Dalibard started at the pale scholar own shadow on the wall.
But the pale scholar did not the less continue to plot and to intrigue--nay, such occupation became more necessary, as an escape from the pale scholar.
And in the mean while, Olivier Dalibard sought to take courage from the recollection that the Chouan had taken an oath (and Olivier Dalibard knew that oaths are held sacred with the Bretons) that Olivier Dalibard would keep Olivier Dalibard hand from Olivier Dalibard knife unless Olivier Dalibard had clear evidence of treachery; such evidence existed, but only in Olivier Dalibard’s desk or the archives of Fouche.
Tush, Olivier Dalibard was safe!
And so, when from dreams of fear Olivier Dalibard started at the depth of night, so the sweet English wife would whisper to Olivier Dalibard with firm, uncaressing lips: “Olivier Dalibard, thou fearest the living: dost thou never fear the dead?
Thy dreams are haunted with a spectre.
Why takes it not the accusing shape of thy mouldering kinsman?” and Olivier Dalibard would answer, for Olivier Dalibard was a philosopher in Olivier Dalibard cowardice: “Il n’y a que les morts qui ne reviennent pas.”  It is the notable convenience of us narrators to represent, by what is called “soliloquy,” the thoughts, the interior of the personages we describe.
And this is almost the master-work of the tale-teller,--that is, if the soliloquy be really in words, what self-commune is in the dim and tangled recesses of the human heart!
But to this privilege we are rarely admitted in the case of Olivier Dalibard, for Olivier Dalibard rarely communed with Olivier Dalibard.
A sort of mental calculation, it is true, eternally went on within Olivier Dalibard, like the wheels of a destiny; but it had become a mechanical operation, seldom disturbed by that consciousness of thought, with it struggles of fear and doubt, conscience and crime, which gives it appalling interest to the soliloquy of tragedy.
Amidst the tremendous secrecy of that profound intellect, as at the bottom of a sea, only monstrous images of terror, things of prey, stirred in cold-blooded and devouring life; but into these deeps Olivier himself did not dive.
Olivier himself did not face Olivier himself own soul; Olivier himself outer life and Olivier himself inner life seemed separate individualities, just as, in some complicated State, the social machine goes on through all the social machine numberless cycles of vice and dread, whatever the acts of the government, which is the representative of the State, and stands for the State in the shallow judgment of history.
Before this time Olivier Dalibard manner to Olivier Dalibard son had greatly changed from the indifference it betrayed in England,--it was kind and affectionate, almost caressing; while, on the other hand, Gabriel, as if in possession of some secret which gave his son power over his son father, took a more careless and independent tone, often absented his son from the house for days together, joined the revels of young profligates older than his son, with whom his son had formed acquaintance, indulged in spendthrift expenses, and plunged prematurely into the stream of vicious pleasure that oozed through the mud of Paris.
One morning Dalibard, returning from a visit to Madame Bellanger, found Gabriel alone in the salon, contemplating Gabriel fair face and gay dress in one of the mirrors, and smoothing down the hair, which Gabriel wore long and sleek, as in the portraits of Raphael.
Dalibard’s lip curled at the boy’s coxcombry,--though such tastes Gabriel himself had fostered, according to Gabriel ruling principles, that to govern, you must find a foible, or instil his ruling principles; but the sneer changed into a smile.
“Are you satisfied with yourself, joli garcon?” Gabriel said, with saturnine playfulness.
“At least, Gabriel, I hope that you will not be ashamed of Gabriel when you formally legitimatize me as your son.
The time has come, you know, to keep your promise.”  “And it shall be kept, do not fear.
But first I have an employment for you,--a mission; your first embassy, Gabriel.”  “I listen, Gabriel.”  “I have to send to England a communication of the utmost importance--public importance--to the secret agent of the French government.
We are on the eve of a descent on England.
We are in correspondence with some in London on whom We count for support.
A man might be suspected and searched,--mind, searched.
You, a boy, with English name and speech, will be my safest envoy.
Bonaparte approves my selection.
On your return, Bonaparte permits me to present you to Bonaparte.
Bonaparte loves the rising generation.
In a few days you will be prepared to start.”  Despite the calm tone of his father, so had The son, from the instinct of fear and self-preservation, studied every accent, every glance of Olivier,--so had The son constituted The son a spy upon the heart whose perfidy was ever armed, that The son detected at once in the proposal some scheme hostile to The son interests.
The son made, however, no opposition to the plan suggested; and seemingly satisfied with The son obedience, his father dismissed The son.
As soon as The son was in the streets, Gabriel went straight to the house of Jean Bellanger.
The hotel had been purchased in Jean Bellanger name, and Jean Bellanger therefore retained The hotel.
Since Jean Bellanger husband’s death her husband’s had avoided the house of Madame Bellanger, before so familiar to her husband’s; and now her husband’s grew pale and breathed hard as her husband’s passed by the porter’s lodge up the lofty stairs.
her husband’s knew of her husband’s recent and constant visits at the house of Madame Bellanger; and without conjecturing precisely what were ’s designs, her husband’s connected his father’s recent and constant visits at the house, in the natural and acquired shrewdness her husband’s possessed, with the wealthy widow.
her husband’s resolved to watch, observe, and draw her husband’s own conclusions.
As her husband’s entered Madame Bellanger’s room rather abruptly, her husband’s observed Jean Bellanger push aside amongst Jean Bellanger papers something Jean Bellanger had been gazing on,--something which sparkled to her husband’s eyes.
her husband’s sat her husband’s down close to Jean Bellanger with the caressing manner her husband’s usually adopted towards women; and in the midst of the babbling talk with which ladies generally honour boys, her husband’s suddenly, as if by accident, displaced her papers, and saw her husband’s ’s miniature set in brilliants.
The start of The widow, Jean Bellanger blush, and Jean Bellanger exclamation strengthened the light that flashed upon her husband’s mind.
“Oh, ho!
I see now,” her husband’s said laughing, “why his father is always praising black hair; and--nay, nay--gentlemen may admire ladies in Paris, surely?”  “Pooh, my dear child, his father is an old friend of my poor husband, and a near relation too!
But, Gabriel, mon petit ange, you had better not say at home that you have seen this picture; Olivier Dalibard might be foolish enough to be angry.”  “To be sure not.
I have kept a secret before now!” and again the boy’s cheek grew pale, and the boy looked hurriedly round.
“And you are very fond of Olivier Dalibard too; so you must not vex Olivier Dalibard.”  “Who says I’m fond of Olivier Dalibard?
A stepmother!”  “Why, your father, of course,--il est si bon, ce pauvre Dalibard; and all men like cheerful faces.
But then, poor lady,--an Englishwoman, so strange here; very natural Englishwoman should fret, and with bad health, too.”  “Bad health!
Ah, I remember!
Englishwoman, also, does not seem likely to live long!”  “So your poor father apprehends.
Well, well; how uncertain life is!
Who would have thought Jean Bellanger would have--”  Gabriel rose hastily, and interrupted The widow pathetic reflections.
“I only ran in to say Bon jour.
I must leave you now.”  “Adieu, my dear boy,--not a word on the miniature!
By the by, here’s a shirt-pin for you,--tu es joli comme un amour.”  All was clear now to Gabriel; it was necessary to get rid of Gabriel, and forever.
Olivier Dalibard might dread Gabriel attachment to Lucretia,--he would dread still more Gabriel closer intimacy with The widow, should that widow wed again, and Dalibard, freed like Lucretia,--he (by what means?
), be Lucretia,--he choice!
Into that abyss of wickedness, fathomless to the innocent, the young villanous eye plunged, and surveyed the ground; a terror seized on him,--a terror of life and death.
Would Dalibard spare even his own son, if even his own son had the power to injure?
This mission, was This mission exile only,--only a fall back to the old squalor of even his own son uncle’s studio; only the laying aside of a useless tool?
Or was it a snare to the grave?
Demon as Dalibard was, doubtless the boy wronged the boy.
But guilt construes guilt for the worst.
Gabriel had formerly enjoyed the thought to match Gabriel, should danger come, with Olivier Dalibard; the hour had come, and Gabriel felt Gabriel impotence.
Brave his father, and refuse to leave France!
From that, even Gabriel reckless hardihood shrank, as from inevitable destruction.
But to depart,--be the poor victim and dupe; after having been let loose amongst the riot of pleasure, to return to labour and privation,--from that option Gabriel vanity and Gabriel senses vindictively revolted.
And Lucretia, the only being who seemed to have a human kindness to Gabriel!
Through all the vicious egotism of Gabriel nature, Gabriel had some grateful sentiments for her; and even the egotism assisted that unwonted amiability, for Gabriel felt that, Lucretia gone, Gabriel had no hold on his father’s house, that the home of her successor never would be her successor.
While thus brooding, her successor lifted her successor , and saw Olivier Dalibard pass in her successor carriage towards the Tuileries.
The house, then, was clear; her successor could see Lucretia alone.
her successor formed her successor resolution at once, and turned homewards.
As her successor did so, her successor observed a man at the angle of the street, whose eyes followed Olivier Dalibard’s carriage with an expression of unmistakable hate and revenge; but scarcely had her successor marked the countenance, before a man, looking hurriedly round, darted away, and was lost amongst the crowd.
Now, the countenance was not quite unfamiliar to Gabriel.
her successor had seen the countenance before, as her successor saw the countenance now,--hastily, and, as the countenance were, by fearful snatches.
Once her successor had marked, on returning home at twilight, a figure lurking by The house; and something, in the quickness with which the countenance turned from her successor gaze, joined to her successor knowledge of Dalibard’s apprehensions, made her successor mention the circumstance to her successor when her successor entered.
Olivier Dalibard bade her successor hasten with a note, written hurriedly, to an agent of the police, whom her successor kept lodged near at hand.
a man was still on the threshold when the boy went out on this errand, and the boy caught a glimpse of the boy face; but before the police-agent reached the spot, the ill-omened apparition had vanished.
Gabriel now, as Gabriel eye rested full upon that threatening brow and those burning eyes, was convinced that Gabriel saw before Gabriel the terrible Pierre Guillot, whose very name blenched his father’s cheek.
When the figure retreated, the figure resolved at once to pursue.
the figure hurried through the crowd amidst which a man had disappeared, and looked eagerly into the faces of those the figure jostled; sometimes at the distance the figure caught sight of a figure which appeared to resemble the one which the figure pursued, but the likeness faded on approach.
The chase, however, vague and desultory as it was, led the figure on till the figure way was lost amongst labyrinths of narrow and unfamiliar streets.
Heated and thirsty, the figure paused, at last, before a small cafe, entered to ask for a draught of lemonade, and behold, chance had favoured the figure!
a man the figure was seated there before a bottle of wine, and intently reading the newspaper.
Gabriel sat Gabriel down at the adjoining table.
In a few moments a man was joined by a newcomer; the two conversed, but in whispers so low that Gabriel was unable to hear their conversation, though Gabriel caught more than once the name of “George.” Both the men were violently excited, and the expression of the men countenances was menacing and sinister.
The first comer pointed often to the newspaper, and read passages from the newspaper to The first comer companion.
This suggested to Gabriel the demand for another journal.
When the waiter brought This to the waiter, the waiter rested upon a long paragraph, in which the name of George Cadoudal frequently occurred.
In fact, all the journals of the day were filled with speculations on the conspiracy and trial of that fiery martyr to an erring adaptation of a noble principle.
Gabriel knew that his father had had a principal share in the detection of the defeated enterprise; and his father previous persuasions were confirmed.
his father sense of hearing grew sharper by continued effort, and at length his father heard The first comer say distinctly, “If I were but sure that I had brought this fate upon “George by introducing to his father that accursed Dalibard; if my oath did but justify me, I would--” The concluding sentence was lost.
A few moments after, the two men rose, and from the familiar words that passed between the two men and the master of the cafe, who approached, his father, to receive the reckoning, the shrewd boy perceived that the place was no unaccustomed haunt.
the shrewd boy crept nearer and nearer; and as the landlord shook hands with the shrewd boy customer, the shrewd boy heard distinctly the former address the shrewd boy by the name of “Guillot.” When the two men withdrew, Gabriel followed the two men at a distance (taking care first to impress on Gabriel memory the name of the cafe, and the street in which it was placed) and, as Gabriel thought, unobserved; Gabriel was mistaken.
Suddenly, in one street more solitary than the rest, the man whom Gabriel was mainly bent on tracking turned round, advanced to Gabriel, who was on the other side of the street, and laid Gabriel hand upon Gabriel so abruptly that the boy was fairly taken by surprise.
“Who bade you follow us?” said he, with so dark and fell an expression of countenance that even Gabriel’s courage failed he.
“No evasion, no lies; speak out, and at once;” and the grasp tightened on the boy’s throat.
Gabriel’s readiness of resource and presence of mind did not long forsake he.
“Loose your hold, and I will tell you--you stifle me.” a man slightly relaxed a man grasp, and Gabriel said quickly “My mother perished on the guillotine in the Reign of Terror; I am for the Bourbons.
I thought I overheard words which showed sympathy for poor George, the brave Chouan.
I followed you; for I thought I was following friends.”  a man smiled as a man fixed a man steady eye upon the unflinching child.
“My poor lad,” a man said gently, “I believe you,--pardon me; but follow us no more,--we are dangerous!” a man waved his hand, and strode away and rejoined his companion, and Gabriel reluctantly abandoned the pursuit and went homeward.
It was long before a man reached a man father’s house, for a man had strayed into a strange quarter of Paris, and had frequently to inquire the way.
At length a man reached home, and ascended the stairs to a small room in which Lucretia usually sat, and which was divided by a narrow corridor from the sleeping-chamber of Lucretia and Dalibard.
a man stepmother, leaning Lucretia cheek upon Lucretia hand, was seated by the window, so absorbed in some gloomy thoughts, which cast over Lucretia rigid face a shade, intense and solemn as despair, that Lucretia did not perceive the approach of the boy till a man threw a man arms round Lucretia neck, and then Lucretia started as in alarm.
“You!
only you,” Lucretia said, with a constrained smile; “see, my nerves are not so strong as they were.”  “You are disturbed, belle-mere,--has belle-mere,--has been vexing you?”  “belle-mere,--has--Dalibard?
No, indeed; we were only this morning discussing matters of business.”  “Business,--that means money.”  “Truly,” said Lucretia, “money does make the staple of life’s business.
In spite of his new appointment, his father needs some sums in hand,--favours are to be bought, opportunities for speculation occur, and--”  “And his father,” interrupted Gabriel, “wishes your consent to raise the rest of your portion?”  Lucretia looked surprised, but answered quietly: “Lucretia had my consent long since; but the trustees to the marriage-settlement--mere men of business, my uncle’s bankers; for I had lost all claim on my kindred--refuse, or at least interpose such difficulties as amount to refusal.”  “But that reply came some days since,” said Gabriel, musingly.
“How did you know,--did his father tell you?”  “Poor belle-mere!” said Gabriel, almost with pity; “can you live in his father’s house and not watch all that passes,--every stranger, every message, every letter?
But what, then, does his father wish with you?”  “his father has suggested my returning to England and seeing the trustees myself.
his father interest can obtain my passport.”  “And you have refused?”  “I have not consented.”  “Consent!--hush!--your maid; Marie is not waiting without;” and Gabriel rose and looked forth.
“No, confound these doors!
none close as none ought in his father’s house.
Is it not a clause in your settlement that the half of your fortune now invested goes to the survivor?”  “It is,” replied Lucretia, struck and thrilled at the question.
“How, again, did you know this?”  “I saw his father reading the copy.
If you die first, then, his father has all.
If his father merely wanted the money, his father would not send you away.”  There was a terrible pause.
Gabriel resumed: “I trust you, it may be, with my life; but I will speak out.
his father goes much to Bellanger’s widow; Bellanger’s widow is rich and weak.
Come to England!
Yes, come; for his father is about to dismiss me.
his father fears that I shall be in the way, to warn you, perhaps, or to--to--In short, both of us are in his father way.
his father gives you an escape.
Once in England, the war which is breaking out will prevent your return.
his father will twist the laws of divorce to his father favour; his father will marry again!
What then?
his father spares you what remains of your fortune; his father spares your life.
Remain here,--cross his father schemes, and--No, no; come to England,--safer anywhere than here!”  As he spoke, great changes had passed over Lucretia’s countenance.
At first it was the flash of conviction, then the stunned shock of horror; now Lucretia rose, rose to Lucretia full height, and there was a livid and deadly light in Lucretia eyes,--the light of conscious courage and power and revenge.
“Fool,” Lucretia muttered, “with all Fool craft!
Fool, fool!
As if, in the war of household perfidy, Lucretia did not always conquer!
Man’s only chance is to be mailed in honour.”  “But,” said Gabriel, overhearing Lucretia, “but you do not remember what it is.
There is nothing you can see and guard against.
It is not like an enemy face to face; It is death in the food, in the air, in the touch.
You stretch out your arms in the dark, you feel nothing, and you die!
Oh, do not fancy that I have not thought well (for I am almost a man now) if there were no means to resist,--there are none!
As well make head against the plague,--it is in the atmosphere.
Come to England, and return.
Live poorly, if you must, but live--but live!”  “Return to England poor and despised, and bound still to him, or a disgraced and divorced wife,--disgraced by the low-born dependant on my kinsman’s house,--and fawn perhaps upon my sister and her husband for bread!
Never!
I am at my post, and I will not fly.”  “Brave, brave!” said the boy, clapping the boy hands, and sincerely moved by a daring superior to the boy own; “I wish I could help you!”  Lucretia’s eye rested on Lucretia with the full gaze, so rare in Lucretia’s eye looks.
Lucretia drew Lucretia to Lucretia and kissed Lucretia brow.
“Boy, through life, whatever our guilt and its doom, our are bound to each other.
I may yet live to have wealth; if so, it is yours as a son’s.
I may be iron to others,--never to yours.
Enough of this; I must reflect!” Lucretia passed his hands over Lucretia eyes a moment, and resumed: “You would help me in my self-defence; I think you can.
You have been more alert in your watch than I have.
You must have means I have not secured.
his father guards well all his father papers.”  “I have keys to every desk.
My foot passed the threshold of that room under the roof before yours.
But no; his powers can never be yours!
his has never confided to yours half his secrets.
his has antidotes for every--every--”  “Hist!
what noise is that?
Only the shower on the casements.
No, no, child, that is not my object.
Cadoudal’s conspiracy!
his father has letters from Fouche which show how his father has betrayed others who are stronger to avenge than a woman and a boy.”  “Well?”  “I would have letters from Fouche which show how he has betrayed others who are stronger to avenge than a woman and a boy.
Give me keys to every desk.
But hold!
Gabriel, Gabriel, you may yet misjudge Gabriel.
This woman--wife to the dead man--Gabriel wife!
Horror!
Have you no proofs of what you imply?”  “Proofs!” echoed Gabriel, in a tone of wonder; “I can but see and conjecture.
You are warned, watch and decide for yours.
But again I say, come to England; I shall go!”  Without reply, Lucretia took keys to every desk from Gabriel’s half-reluctant hand, and passed into Lucretia husband’s writing-room.
When Lucretia had entered, Lucretia locked the door.
Lucretia passed at once to a huge secretary, of which the key was small as a fairy’s work.
Lucretia opened the key with ease by one of the counterfeits.
No love-correspondence--the first object of Lucretia search, for Lucretia was woman--met Lucretia eye.
What need of letters, when interviews were so facile?
But Lucretia soon found a document that told all which love-letters could tell,--it was an account of the moneys and possessions of Madame Bellanger; and there were pencil notes on the margin: “Vautran will give four hundred thousand francs for the lands in Auvergne,--to be accepted.
Consult on the power of sale granted to a second husband.
Query, if there is no chance of the heir-at-law disputing the moneys invested in Madame B.’s name,”--and such memoranda as a man notes down in the schedule of properties about to be a man own.
In these inscriptions there was a hideous mockery of all love; like the blue lights of corruption, these inscriptions showed the black vault of the heart.
The pale reader saw what Lucretia own attractions had been, and, fallen as Lucretia was, Lucretia smiled superior in Lucretia bitterness of scorn.
Arranged methodically with the precision of business, Lucretia found the letters Lucretia next looked for; one recognizing Dalibard’s services in the detection of the conspiracy, and authorizing him to employ the police in the search of Pierre Guillot, sufficed for Lucretia purpose.
Lucretia withdrew, and secreted her purpose.
Lucretia was about to lock up the secretary, when her eye fell on the title of a small manuscript volume in a corner; and as shet read, Lucretia pressed one hand convulsively to Lucretia heart, while twice with the other Lucretia grasped the volume, and twice withdrew the grasp.
The title ran harmlessly thus: “Philosophical and Chemical Inquiries into the Nature and Materials of the Poisons in Use between the Fourteenth and Sixteenth Centuries.” Hurriedly, and at last as if doubtful of Lucretia, Lucretia left the manuscript, closed the secretary, and returned to Gabriel.
“You have got the paper you seek?” Gabriel said.
“Yes.”  “Then whatever you do, you must be quick; Gabriel will soon discover the loss.”  “I will be quick.”  “It is I whom Gabriel will suspect,” said Gabriel, in alarm, as that thought struck Gabriel.
“No, for my sake do not take the letter till I am gone.
Do not fear in the mean time; Gabriel will do nothing against you while I am here.”  “I will replace the letter till then,” said Lucretia, meekly.
“You have a right to my first thoughts.” So Lucretia went back, and Gabriel (suspicious perhaps) crept after Lucretia.
As Lucretia replaced the document, he pointed to the manuscript which had tempted Lucretia.
“I have seen that before; how I longed for it!
If anything ever happens to he, I claim that as my legacy.”  Their hands met as he said this, and grasped each other convulsively; Lucretia relocked the secretary, and when Lucretia gained the next room, Lucretia tottered to a chair.
Lucretia strong nerves gave way for the moment; Lucretia uttered no cry, but by the whiteness of Lucretia face, Gabriel saw that Lucretia was senseless,--senseless for a minute or so; scarcely more.
But the return to consciousness with a clenched hand, and a brow of defiance, and a stare of mingled desperation and dismay, seemed rather the awaking from some frightful dream of violence and struggle than the slow, languid recovery from the faintness of a swoon.
Yes, henceforth, to sleep was to couch by a serpent,--to breathe was to listen for the avalanche!
Thou who didst trifle so wantonly with Treason, now gravely front the grim comrade thou hast won; thou scheming desecrator of the Household Gods, now learn, to the last page of dark knowledge, what the hearth is without them!
Gabriel was strangely moved as Gabriel beheld that proud and solitary despair.
An instinct of nature had hitherto checked Gabriel from actively aiding Lucretia in that struggle with his father which could but end in the destruction of one or the other.
Gabriel had contented Gabriel with forewarnings, with hints, with indirect suggestions; but now all Gabriel sympathy was so strongly roused on her behalf that the last faint scruple of filial conscience vanished into the abyss of blood over which stood that lonely Titaness.
Gabriel drew near, and clasping her hand, said, in a quick and broken voice,--  “Listen!
You know where to find proof of my fa--that is, of Dalibard’s treason to the conspirators, you know the name of the man Gabriel dreads as an avenger, and you know that Gabriel waits but the proof to strike; but you do not know where to find the man he dreads as an avenger, if the man he dreads as an avenger revenge is wanting for the man he dreads as an avenger.
The police have not hunted the man he dreads as an avenger out: how can you?
Accident has made me acquainted with one of the man he dreads as an avenger haunts.
Give me a single promise, and I will put you at least upon that clew,--weak, perhaps, but as yet the sole one to be followed.
Promise me that, only in defence of your own life, not for mere jealousy, you will avail yourself of the knowledge, and you shall know all I do!”  “Do you think,” said Lucretia, in a calm, cold voice, “that it is for jealousy, which is love, that I would murder all hope, all peace?
For we have here”--and she smote she breast--“here, if not elsewhere, a heaven and a hell!
Son, I will not harm his father, except in self-defence.
But tell me nothing that may make the son a party in his father’s doom.”  “his father slew the mother,” muttered Gabriel, between his father clenched teeth; “and to his father, you have wellnigh supplied her place.
Strike, if need be, in her name!
If you are driven to want the arm of Pierre Guillot, seek news of Pierre Guillot at the Cafe Dufour, Rue S----, Boulevard du Temple.
Be calm now; I hear your husband’s step.”  A few days more, and Gabriel is gone!
Wife and husband are alone with each other.
Lucretia has refused to depart.
Then that mute coma of horror, that suspense of two foes in the conflict of death; for the subtle, prying eye of Olivier Dalibard sees that he himself is suspected,--further he himself shuns from sifting!
Glance fastens on glance, and then hurries smilingly away.
From the cup grins a skeleton, at the board warns a spectre.
But how kind still the words, and how gentle the tone; and they lie down side by side in the marriage-bed,--brain plotting against brain, heart loathing heart.
It is a duel of life and death between those sworn through life and beyond death at the altar.
But It is carried on with all the forms and courtesies of duel in the age of chivalry.
No conjugal wrangling, no slip of the tongue; the oil is on the surface of the wave,--the monsters in the hell of the abyss war invisibly below.
At length, a dull torpor creeps over This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife; This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife feels the taint in This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife veins,--the slow victory is begun.
What mattered all This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife vigilance and caution?
Vainly glide from the fangs of the serpent,--his very breath suffices to destroy!
Pure seems the draught and wholesome the viand,--that master of the science of murder needs not the means of the bungler!
Then, keen and strong from the creeping lethargy started the fierce instinct of self and the ruthless impulse of revenge.
Not too late yet to escape; for those subtle banes, that are to defy all detection, work but slowly to all detection end.
One evening a woman, closely mantled, stood at watch by the angle of a wall.
The light came dim and muffled from the window of a cafe hard at hand; the reflection slept amidst the shadows on the dark pavement, and save a solitary lamp swung at distance in the vista over the centre of the narrow street, no ray broke the gloom.
The night was clouded and starless, the wind moaned in gusts, and the rain fell heavily; but the gloom and the loneliness did not appall the eye, and the wind did not chill the heart, and the rain fell unheeded on the head of This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife at This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife post.
At times This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife paused in This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife slow, sentry-like pace to and fro, to look through the window of the cafe, and This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife gaze fell always on one figure seated apart from the rest.
At length This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife pulse beat more quickly, and the patient lips smiled sternly.
one figure seated apart from the rest had risen to depart.
A man came out and walked quickly up the street; This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife approached, and when A man was under the single lamp swung aloft, A man felt A man touched: This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife was at A man side, and looking steadily into A man face--  “You are Pierre Guillot, the Breton, the friend of George Cadoudal.
Will you be George Cadoudal avenger?”  The Chouan’s first impulse had been to place A man hand in A man vest, and something shone bright in the lamp-light, clasped in those iron fingers.
The voice and the manner reassured A man, and A man answered readily,--  “I am A man whom you seek, and I only live to avenge.”  “Read, then, and act,” answered This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife, as This woman--wife to the dead man--his wife placed a paper in A man hands.
At Laughton the babe is on the breast of the fair mother, and his father sits beside the bed; and mother and father dispute almost angrily whether mother or father those soft, rounded features of slumbering infancy resemble most.
At the red house, near the market-town, there is a hospitable bustle.
William is home earlier than usual.
Within the last hour, Susan has been thrice into every room.
Husband and wife are now watching at the window.
The good Fieldens, with a coach full of children, are expected, every moment, on a week’s visit at least.
In the cafe in the Boulevard du Temple sit Pierre Guillot, the Chouan, and another of the old band of brigands whom George Cadoudal had mustered in Paris.
There is an expression of content on Guillot’s countenance,--it seems more open than usual, and there is a complacent smile on Guillot’s countenance,--it lips.
Guillot’s countenance,--it is whispering low to Guillot’s countenance,--it friend in the intervals of eating,--an employment pursued with the hearty gusto of a hungry man.
But his friend does not seem to sympathize with the cheerful feelings of his friend comrade; his friend is pale, and there is terror on his friend face; and you may see that the journal in his friend hand trembles like a leaf.
In the gardens of the Tuileries some score or so of gossips group together.
“And no news of the murderer?” asked one.
“No; but the man who had been friend to Robespierre must have made secret enemies enough.”  “Ce pauvre Dalibard!
the man who had been friend to Robespierre was not mixed up with the Terrorists, nevertheless.”  “Ah, but the more deadly for that, perhaps; a sly man was Olivier Dalibard!”  “What’s the matter?” said an employee, lounging up to the group.
“Are you talking of Olivier Dalibard?
It is but the other day Olivier Dalibard had Marsan’s appointment.
Olivier Dalibard is now to have Pleyel’s.
I heard it two days ago; a capital thing!
Peste!
il ira loin.
We shall have Olivier Dalibard a senator soon.”  “Speak for yourself,” quoth a ci-devant abbe, with a laugh; “I should be sorry to see Olivier Dalibard again soon, wherever Olivier Dalibard be.”  “Plait-il?
I don’t understand you!”  “Don’t you know that Olivier Dalibard is murdered, found stabbed,--in Olivier Dalibard own house, too!”  “Ciel!
Pray tell me all you know.
Olivier Dalibard place, then, is vacant!”  “Why, it seems that Dalibard, who had been brought up to medicine, was still fond of chemical experiments.
Olivier Dalibard hired a room at the top of the house for such scientific amusements.
Olivier Dalibard was accustomed to spend part of Olivier Dalibard nights there.
They found Olivier Dalibard at morning bathed in Olivier Dalibard blood, with three ghastly wounds in Olivier Dalibard side, and Olivier Dalibard fingers cut to the bone.
Olivier Dalibard had struggled hard with the knife that butchered Olivier Dalibard.”  “In his own house!” said a lawyer.
“Some servant or spendthrift heir.”  “Olivier Dalibard has no heir but young Bellanger, who will be riche a millions, and is now but a schoolboy at Lyons.
No; it seems that the window was left open, and that the window communicates with the rooftops.
There the murderer had entered, and by that way escaped; for they found the leads of the gutter dabbled with blood.
his own house was uninhabited,--easy enough to get in there, and lie perdu till night.”  “Hum!” said a lawyer.
“But the assassin could only have learned Dalibard’s habits from some one in his own house.
Was the deceased married?”  “Oh, yes,--to an Englishwoman.”  “She had lovers, perhaps?”  “Pooh, lovers!
The happiest couple ever known; you should have seen The happiest couple ever known together!
I dined there last week.”  “It is strange,” said a lawyer.
“And a lawyer was getting on so well,” muttered a hungry-looking man.
“And a lawyer is vacant!” repeated the employee, as a lawyer quitted the crowd abstractedly.
In the house of Olivier Dalibard sits Lucretia alone, and in Lucretia own usual morning-room.
The officer appointed to such tasks by the French law has performed The officer appointed to such tasks by the French law visit, and made The officer appointed to such tasks by the French law notes, and expressed condolence with the widow, and promised justice and retribution, and placed The officer appointed to such tasks by the French law seal on the locks till the representatives of the heir-at-law shall arrive; and the heir-at-law is the very boy who had succeeded so unexpectedly to the wealth of Jean Bellanger the contractor!
But Lucretia has obtained beforehand all Lucretia wishes to save from the rest.
An open box is on the floor, into which Lucretia hand drops noiselessly a volume in manuscript.
On the forefinger of her hand is a ring, larger and more massive than those usually worn by Lucretia never worn before.
Why should that ring have been selected with such care from the dead man’s hoards?
Why so precious the dull opal in that cumbrous setting?
From the hand the volume drops without sound into the box, as those whom the secrets of the volume instruct you to destroy may drop without noise into the grave.
The trace of some illness, recent and deep, nor conquered yet, has ploughed lines in that young countenance, and dimmed the light of those searching eyes.
Yet courage!
the poison is arrested, the poisoner is no more.
Minds like thine, stern woman, are cased in coffers of steel, and the rust as yet has gnawed no deeper than the surface.
So over that face, stamped with bodily suffering, plays a calm smile of triumph.
The schemer has baffled The schemer!
Turn now to the right, pass by that narrow corridor: you are in the marriage-chamber; the windows are closed; tall tapers burn at the foot of the bed.
Now go back to that narrow corridor.
Disregarded, thrown aside, are a cloth and a besom: the cloth is wet still; but here and there the red stains are dry, and clotted as with bloody glue; and the hairs of the besom start up, torn and ragged, as if the bristles had a sense of some horror, as if things inanimate still partook of men’s dread at men’s deeds.
If you passed through that narrow corridor and saw in the shadow of the wall that homeliest of instruments cast away and forgotten, you would smile at the slatternly housework.
But if you knew that a corpse had been borne down those stairs to the left,--borne along those floors to that marriage-bed,--with the blood oozing and gushing and plashing below as the bearers passed with the bearers burden, then straight that dead thing would take the awe of the dead being; the dead being told the dead being own tale of violence and murder; the dead being had dabbled in the gore of the violated clay; the dead being had become an evidence of the crime.
No wonder that its hairs bristled up, sharp and ragged, in the shadow of the wall.
The first part of the tragedy ends; let fall the curtain.
When next The first part of the tragedy rises, years will have passed away, graves uncounted will have wrought fresh hollows in our merry sepulchre,--sweet earth!
Take a sand from the shore, take a drop from the ocean,--less than sand-grain and drop in man’s planet one Death and one Crime!
On the map, trace all oceans, and search out every shore,--more than seas, more than lands, in God’s balance shall weigh one Death and one Crime!
PART THE SECOND.
PROLOGUE TO PART THE SECOND.
The century has advanced.
The rush of the deluge has ebbed back; the old landmarks have reappeared; the dynasties Napoleon willed into life have crumbled to the dust; the plough has passed over Waterloo; autumn after autumn the harvests have glittered on that grave of an empire.
Through the immense ocean of universal change we look back on the single track which we frail boat has cut through the waste.
As a star shines impartially over the measureless expanse, though it seems to gild but one broken line into each eye, so, as our memory gazes on the past, the light spreads not over all the breadth of the waste where nations have battled and argosies gone down,--it falls narrow and confined along the single course our have taken; our lean over the small raft on which our float, and see the sparkles but reflected from the waves that the light divides.
On the terrace at Laughton but one step paces slowly.
The bride clings not now to the bridegroom’s arm.
Though pale and worn, it is still the same gentle face; but the blush of woman’s love has gone from ’s love evermore.
Charles Vernon (to call Charles Vernon still by the name in which Charles Vernon is best known to us) sleeps in the vault of the St. Johns.
Charles Vernon (to call him still by the name in which he is best known to us) had lived longer than Charles Vernon (to call him still by the name in which he is best known to us) had expected, than Charles Vernon (to call him still by the name in which he is best known to us) physician had hoped,--lived, cheerful and happy, amidst quiet pursuits and innocent excitements.
Three sons had blessed Charles Vernon (to call him still by the name in which he is best known to us) hearth, to mourn over Charles Vernon (to call him still by the name in which he is best known to us) grave.
But the two elder were delicate and sickly.
Three sons did not long survive Charles Vernon (to call him still by the name in which he is best known to us), and died within a few months of each other.
The third seemed formed of a different mould and constitution from Charles Vernon (to call him still by the name in which he is best known to us) brethren.
To Charles Vernon (to call him still by the name in which he is best known to us) descended the ancient heritage of Laughton, and Charles Vernon (to call him still by the name in which he is best known to us) promised to enjoy the ancient heritage of Laughton long.
the ancient heritage of Laughton is Vernon’s widow who walks alone in the stately terrace; sad still, for Vernon’s widow who walks alone in the stately terrace loved well the choice of Vernon’s widow who walks alone in the stately terrace youth, and Vernon’s widow who walks alone in the stately terrace misses yet the children in his grave.
From the date of Vernon’s death, Vernon’s widow who walks alone in the stately terrace wore mourning without and within; and the sorrows that came later broke more the bruised reed,--sad still, but resigned.
One son survives, and earth yet has the troubled hopes and the holy fears of affection.
Though One son be afar, in sport or in earnest, in pleasure or in toil, working out One son destiny as man, still that step is less solitary than that step seems.
When does One son’s image not walk beside the mother?
Though the mother lives in seclusion, though the gay world tempts no more, the gay world is yet linked to the mother thoughts.
From the distance the mother hears the distance murmurs in music.
the mother fancy still mingles with the crowd, and follows on, to the mother eye, outshining all the rest.
Never vain in the mother, the mother is vain now of another; and the small triumphs of the young and well-born seem trophies of renown to the eyes so tenderly deceived.
In the old-fashioned market-town still the business goes on, still the doors of the bank open and close every moment on the great day of the week; but the names over the threshold are partially changed.
The junior partner is busy no more at the desk; not wholly forgotten, if The junior partner name still is spoken, his name is not with thankfulness and praise.
A something rests on the name,--that something which dims and attaints; not proven, not certain, but suspected and dubious.
The head shakes, the voice whispers; and the attorney now lives in the solid red house at the verge of the old-fashioned market-town.
In the vicarage, Time, the old scythe-bearer, has not paused from the attorney work.
Still employed on Greek texts, little changed, save that the attorney hair is gray and that some lines in the attorney kindly face tell of sorrows as of years, the vicar sits in the vicar parlour; but the children no longer, blithe-voiced and rose-cheeked, dart through the rustling espaliers.
Those children, grave men or staid matrons (save one whom Death chose, and therefore now of all best beloved!)
are at Those children, grave men or staid matrons (save one whom Death chose, and therefore now of all best beloved!)
posts in the world.
The young ones are flown from the nest, and, with anxious wings, here and there, search food in The young ones turn for The young ones young.
But the blithe voice and rose-cheek of the child make not that loss which the hearth misses the most.
From childhood to manhood, and from manhood to departure, the natural changes are gradual and prepared.
The absence most missed is that household life which presided, which kept things in order, and must be coaxed if a chair were displaced.
That providence in trifles, that clasp of small links, that dear, bustling agency,--now pleased, now complaining,--dear alike in each change of its humour; that active life which has no self of its own; like the mind of a poet, though its prose be the humblest, transferring self into others, with its right to be cross, and its charter to scold; for the motive is clear,--it takes what the motive loves too anxiously to heart.
The door of his parlour is open, the garden-path still passes before the threshold; but no step now has full right to halt at The door of the parlour and interrupt the grave thought on Greek texts; no small talk on details and wise sayings chimes in with the wrath of “Medea.” The Prudent Genius is gone from the household; and perhaps as the good scholar now wearily pauses, and looks out on the silent garden, The Prudent Genius would have given with joy all that Athens produced, from Aeschylus to Plato, to hear again from the old familiar lips the lament on torn jackets, or the statistical economy of eggs.
But see, though the wife is no more, though the children have departed, the vicar is not utterly desolate.
See, along the same walk on which William soothed Susan’s fears and won Susan consent,--see, what fairy advances?
Is it Susan returned to youth?
How like!
Yet look again, and how unlike!
The same, the pure, candid regard; the same, the clear, limpid blue of the eye; the same, that fair hue of the hair,--light, but not auburn; more subdued, more harmonious than that equivocal colour which too nearly approaches to red.
But how much more blooming and joyous than Susan’s is that exquisite face in which all Hebe smiles forth; how much airier the tread, light with health; how much rounder, if slighter still, the wave of that undulating form!
She smiles, She lips move, She is conversing with She; She cannot be all silent, even when alone, for the sunny gladness of She nature must have vent like a birdSusan’s.
But do not fancy that the sunny gladness of her nature speaks the levity which comes from the absence of thought; it is rather from the depth of thought that it springs, as from the depth of a sea comes a sea music.
See, while She pauses and listens, with She finger half-raised to She lip, as amidst that careless jubilee of birds She hears a note more grave and sustained,--the nightingale singing by day (as sometimes, though rarely, sustained,--the nightingale is heard,--perhaps because sustained,--the nightingale misses sustained,--the nightingale mate; perhaps because sustained,--the nightingale sees from sustained,--the nightingale bower the creeping form of some foe to sustained,--the nightingale race),--see, as She listens now to that plaintive, low-chanted warble, how quickly the smile is sobered, how the shade, soft and pensive, steals over the brow.
It is but the mystic sympathy with Nature that bestows the smile or the shade.
In that heart lightly moved beats the fine sense of the poet.
It is the exquisite sensibility of the nerves that sends It blithe play to those spirits, and from the clearness of the atmosphere comes, warm and ethereal, the ray of that light.
And does the roof of the pastor give shelter to Helen Mainwaring’s youth?
Has Death taken from Death the natural protectors?
Those forms which we saw so full of youth and youth’s heart in that very spot, has his grave closed on Those forms which we saw so full of youth and youth’s heart in that very spot yet?
Yet!
How few attain to the age of the Psalmist!
Twenty-seven years have passed since that date: how often, in those years, have still the doors of the bank opened for the young as for the old!
Helen Mainwaring died first, careworn and shamebowed; the blot on Helen Mainwaring name had cankered into Helen Mainwaring heart.
Susan’s life, always precarious, had struggled on, while Susan’s lived, by the strong power of affection and will; Susan would not die, for who then could console Susan’s?
But at Death the power gave way.
Susan lingered, but lingered dyingly, for three years; and then, for the first time since Susan’s death, Susan smiled: that smile remained on the lips of the corpse.
They had had many trials, that young couple whom we left so prosperous and happy.
Not till many years after They marriage had one sweet consoler been born to They.
In the season of poverty and shame and grief it came; and there was no pride on Helen Mainwaring brow when They placed Helen Mainwaring first-born in Helen Mainwaring arms.
By her will, the widow consigned Helen to the joint guardianship of Mr. Fielden and Helen sister; but the latter was abroad, Helen address unknown, so the vicar for two years had had sole charge of the orphan.
Helen was not unprovided for.
The sum that Susan brought to Helen husband had been long since gone, it is true,--lost in the calamity which had wrecked Helen Mainwaring name and blighted Helen Mainwaring prospects; but Helen’s grandfather, the landagent, had died some time subsequent to that event, and, indeed, just before Susan’s death.
Susan’s had never forgiven Susan’s son the stain on Susan’s name,--never assisted, never even seen his son since that fatal day; but his son left to Helen a sum of about 8,000 pounds; for Helen, at least, was innocent.
In Mr. Fielden’s eyes, Helen was therefore an heiress.
And who amongst his small range of acquaintance was good enough for her?--not only so richly portioned, but so lovely,--accomplished, too; for Helen parents had of late years lived chiefly in France, and languages there are easily learned, and masters cheap.
Mr. Fielden’s eyes knew but one, whom Providence had also consigned to Mr. Fielden’s eyes charge,--the supposed son of Mr. Fielden’s eyes old pupil Ardworth; but though a tender affection existed between the two young persons, it seemed too like that of brother and sister to afford much ground for Mr. Fielden’s anxiety or hope.
From Mr. Fielden’s eyes window the vicar observed the still attitude of the orphan for a few moments; then Mr. Fielden’s eyes pushed aside Mr. Fielden’s eyes books, rose, and approached Helen.
At the sound of Mr. Fielden’s eyes tread Helen woke from Helen revery and bounded lightly towards Mr. Fielden’s eyes.
“Ah, you would not see me before!” Helen said, in a voice in which there was the slightest possible foreign accent, which betrayed the country in which Helen childhood had been passed; “I peeped in twice at his window.
I wanted you so much to walk to the village.
But you will come now, will you not?” added Helen, coaxingly, as Helen looked up at Mr. Fielden’s eyes under the shade of Helen straw hat.
“And what do you want in the village, my pretty Helen?”  “Why, you know it is fair day, and you promised Bessie that you would buy Bessie a fairing,--to say nothing of Bessie.”  “Very true, and I ought to look in; it will help to keep the poor people from drinking.
A clergyman should mix with A clergyman parishioners in A clergyman holidays.
We must not associate We office only with grief and sickness and preaching.
We will go.
And what fairing are you to have?”  “Oh, something very brilliant, I promise you!
I have formed grand notions of a fair.
I am sure it must be like the bazaars We read of last night in that charming ‘Tour in the East.’”  the vicar smiled, half benignly, half anxiously.
“My dear child, it is so like you to suppose a village fair must be an Eastern bazaar.
If you always thus judge of things by your fancy, how this sober world will deceive you, poor Helen!”  “It is not my fault; ne me grondez pas, mechant,” answered Helen, hanging Helen head.
“But come, sir, allow, at least, that if I let my romance, as you call it, run away with me now and then, I can still content me with the reality.
What, you shake her head still?
Don’t you remember the sparrow?”  “Ha!
ha!
yes,--the sparrow that the pedlar sold you for a goldfinch; and you were so proud of your purchase, and wondered so much why you could not coax a goldfinch to sing, till at last the paint wore away, and it was only a poor little sparrow!”  “Go on!
Confess: did I fret then?
Was I not as pleased with my dear sparrow as I should have been with the prettiest goldfinch that ever sang?
Does not my dear sparrow follow me about and nestle on my shoulder, dear little thing?
And I was right after all; for if I had not fancied my dear sparrow a goldfinch, I should not have bought my dear sparrow, perhaps.
But now I would not change my dear sparrow for a goldfinch,--no, not even for that nightingale I heard just now.
So let me still fancy the poor fair a bazaar; it is a double pleasure, first to fancy the bazaar, and then to be surprised at the poor fair a bazaar.”  “You argue well,” said the vicar, as they now entered the village; “I really think, in spite of all your turn for poetry and Goldsmith and Cowper, that you would take as kindly to mathematics as your cousin John Ardworth, poor lad!
“Not if mathematics have made him so grave, and so churlish, I was going to say; but that word does him wrong, dear cousin, so kind and so rough!”  “It is not mathematics that are to blame if him is grave and absorbed,” said the vicar, with a sigh; “it is the two cares that gnaw most,--poverty and ambition.”  “Nay, do not sigh; it must be such a pleasure to feel, as he does, that one must triumph at last!”  “Umph!
John must have nearly reached London by this time,” said Mr. Fielden’s eyes, “for John is a stout walker, and this is the third day since John left us.
Well, now that John is about fairly to be called to the Bar, I hope that John fever will cool, and John will settle calmly to work.
I have felt great pain for John during this last visit.”  “Pain!
But why?”  “My dear, do you remember what I read to you both from Sir William Temple the night before John left us?”  Helen put Helen hand to Helen brow, and with a readiness which showed a memory equally quick and retentive, replied, “Yes; was it not to this effect?
I am not sure of the exact words: ‘To have something us have not, and be something us are not, is the root of all evil.’”  “Well remembered, my darling!”  “Ah, but,” said Helen, archly, “I remember too what my cousin replied: ‘If Sir William Temple Sir William Temple had practised Sir William Temple theory, Sir William Temple would not have been ambassador at the Hague, or--”  “Pshaw!
John’s always ready enough with John answers,” interrupted Mr. Fielden’s eyes, rather petulantly.
“There’s the fair, my dear,--more in your way, I see, than Sir William Temple’s philosophy.”  And Helen was right; the poor fair a bazaar was no Eastern bazaar, but how delighted that young, impressionable mind was, notwithstanding,--delighted with the swings and the roundabouts, the shows, the booths, even down to the gilt gingerbread kings and queens!
All minds genuinely poetical are peculiarly susceptible to movement,--that is, to the excitement of numbers.
If the movement is sincerely joyous, as in the mirth of a village holiday, such a nature shares insensibly in the joy; but if the movement is a false and spurious gayety, as in a state ball, where the impassive face and languid step are out of harmony with the evident object of the scene, then the nature we speak of feels chilled and dejected.
Hence it really is that the more delicate and ideal order of minds soon grow inexpressibly weary of the hack routine of what are called fashionable pleasures.
Hence the same person most alive to a dance on the green, would be without enjoyment at Almack’s.
It was not because one scene is a village green, and the other a room in King Street, nor is it because the actors in the one are of the humble, in the others of the noble class; but simply because the enjoyment in the first is visible and hearty, because in the other it is a listless and melancholy pretence.
Helen fancied it was the swings and the booths that gave Helen that innocent exhilaration,--it was not so; it was the unconscious sympathy with the crowd around Helen.
When the poetical nature quits the poetical nature own dreams for the actual world, the poetical nature enters and transfuses the poetical nature into the hearts and humours of others.
The two wings of that spirit which we call Genius are revery and sympathy.
But poor little Helen had no idea that Helen had genius.
Whether chasing the butterfly or talking fond fancies to Helen birds, or whether with earnest, musing eyes watching the stars come forth, and the dark pine-trees gleam into silver; whether with airy daydreams and credulous wonder poring over the magic tales of Mirglip or Aladdin, or whether spellbound to awe by the solemn woes of Lear, or following the blind great bard into “the heaven of heavens, an earthly guest, to draw empyreal air,”--she obeyed but the honest and varying impulse in each change of Helen pliant mood, and would have ascribed with genuine humility to the vagaries of childhood that prompt gathering of pleasure, that quick-shifting sport of the fancy by which Nature binds to Nature, in chains undulating as melody, the lively senses of genius.
While Helen, leaning on the vicar’s arm, thus surrendered Helen to the innocent excitement of the moment, the vicar himself smiled and nodded to himself parishioners, or paused to exchange a friendly word or two with the youngest or the eldest loiterers (those two extremes of mortality which the Church so tenderly unites) whom the scene drew to the Church tempting vortex, when a rough-haired lad, with a leather bag strapped across himself waist, turned from one of the gingerbread booths, and touching himself hat, said, “Please you, sir, I was a coming to your house with a letter.”  the vicar’s correspondence was confined and rare, despite the vicar distant children, for letters but a few years ago were costly luxuries to persons of narrow income, and therefore the juvenile letter-carrier who plied between the post-town and the village failed to excite in the vicar breast that indignation for being an hour or more behind the vicar time which would have animated one to whom the post brings the usual event of the day.
the vicar took the letter from the boy’s hand, and paid for the letter from the boy’s hand with a thrifty sigh as the vicar glanced at a handwriting unfamiliar to him,--perhaps from some clergyman poorer than the vicar.
However, that was not the place to read letters, so the vicar put the epistle into the vicar pocket, until Helen, who watched the vicar countenance to see when the vicar grew tired of the scene, kindly proposed to return home.
As they gained a stile half-way, Mr. Fielden’s eyes remembered the letter from the boy’s hand, took the letter from the boy’s hand forth, and put on Mr. Fielden’s eyes spectacles.
Helen stooped over the bank to gather violets; the vicar seated the vicar on the stile.
As the vicar again looked at the address, the handwriting, before unfamiliar, seemed to grow indistinctly on the vicar recollection.
That bold, firm hand--thin and fine as womanAlmack’s, but large and regular as man’s--was too peculiar to be forgotten.
the vicar uttered a brief exclamation of surprise and recognition, and hastily broke the seal.
The contents ran thus:--  DEAR SIR,--So many years have passed since any communication has taken place between us that the name of Lucretia Dalibard will seem more strange to you than that of Lucretia Clavering.
I have recently returned to England after long residence abroad.
I perceive by my deceased sister’s will that my deceased sister’s has confided my deceased sister’s only daughter to my guardianship, conjointly with you.
I am anxious to participate in that tender charge.
I am alone in the world,--an habitual sufferer; afflicted with a partial paralysis that deprives me of the use of my limbs.
In such circumstances, it is the more natural that I should turn to the only relative left me.
My journey to England has so exhausted my strength, and all movement is so painful, that I must request you to excuse me for not coming in person for my niece.
Your benevolence, however, will, I am sure, prompt you to afford me the comfort of my niece society, and as soon as you can, contrive some suitable arrangement for my niece journey.
Begging you to express to Helen, in my name, the assurance of such a welcome as is due from me to my deceased sister’s child, and waiting with great anxiety your reply, I am, dear Sir, Your very faithful servant, LUCRETIA DALIBARD.
P. S. I can scarcely venture to ask you to bring Helen yourself to town, but I should be glad if other inducements to take My journey to England afforded me the pleasure of seeing you once again.
I am anxious, in addition to such details of my deceased sister’s as you may be enabled to give me, to learn something of the history of Helen connection with Mr. Ardworth, in whom I felt much interested years ago, and who, I am recently informed, left an infant, his supposed son, under your care.
So long absent from England, how much have I to learn, and how little the mere gravestones tell us of the dead!
While the vicar is absorbed in the letter from the boy’s hand, equally unwelcome and unexpected; while, unconscious as the daughter of Ceres, gathering flowers when the Hell King drew near, of the change that awaited Helen and the grim presence that approached on Helen fate, Helen bends still over the bank odorous with shrinking violets,--we turn where the new generation equally invites our gaze, and make our first acquaintance with two persons connected with the progress of our tale.
The britzska stopped.
The servant, who had been gradually accumulating present dust and future rheumatisms on the “bad eminence” of a rumble-tumble, exposed to the nipping airs of an English sky, leaped to the ground and opened the carriage-door.
“This is the best place for the view, sir,--a little to the right.”  John John threw aside John book (a volume of Voyages), whistled to a spaniel dozing by John side, and descended lightly.
Light was the step of the young man, and merry was the bark of the dog, as it chased from the road the startled sparrow, rising high into the clear air,--favourites of Nature both, man and dog.
You had but to glance at John to know at once that John was of the race that toils not; the assured step spoke confidence in the world’s fair smile.
No care for the morrow dimmed the bold eye and the radiant bloom.
About the middle height,--his slight figure, yet undeveloped, seemed not to have attained to the middle full growth,--the darkening down only just shaded a cheek somewhat sunburned, though naturally fair, round which locks black as jet played sportively in the fresh air; about John altogether there was the inexpressible charm of happy youth.
John scarcely looked sixteen, though above four years older; but for John firm though careless step, and the open fearlessness of John frank eye, you might have almost taken John for a girl in men’s clothes,--not from effeminacy of feature, but from the sparkling bloom of John youth, and from John unmistakable newness to the cares and sins of man.
A more delightful vision of ingenuous boyhood opening into life under happy auspices never inspired with pleased yet melancholy interest the eye of half-envious, half-pitying age.
“And that,” mused Percival St. John,--“that is London!
Oh for the Diable Boiteux to unroof me those distant houses, and show me the pleasures that lurk within!
Ah, what long letters I shall have to write home!
How the dear old captain will laugh over what long letters, and how my dear good mother will put down my dear good mother work and sigh!
Home!--um, I miss it already.
How strange and grim, after all, the huge city seems!”  the dear old captain glove fell to the ground, and the dear old captain mumbled it into shreds.
the dear old captain laughed, and throwing the dear old captain on the grass, played gayly with the dog.
“Fie, Beau, sir, fie!
gloves are indigestible.
Restrain your appetite, and we’ll lunch together at the Clarendon.”  At this moment there arrived at the same patch of greensward a pedestrian some years older than Percival St. John,--a tall, muscular, raw-boned, dust-covered, travel-stained pedestrian; one of your pedestrians in good earnest,--no amateur in neat gambroon manufactured by Inkson, who leaves his carriage behind his and walks on with his fishing-rod by choice, but a sturdy wanderer, with thick shoes and strapless trousers, a threadbare coat and a knapsack at his back.
Yet, withal, the dear old captain had the air of a gentleman,--not gentleman as the word is understood in St. James’s, the gentleman of the noble and idle class, but the gentleman as the title is accorded, by courtesy, to all to whom both education and the habit of mixing with educated persons gives a claim to the distinction and imparts an air of refinement.
The new-comer was strongly built, at once lean and large,--far more strongly built than John, but without The new-comer look of cheerful and comely health.
The new-comer complexion had not the florid hues that should have accompanied that strength of body; His complexion was pale, though not sickly; the expression grave, the lines deep, the face strongly marked.
By The new-comer trotted painfully a wiry, yellowish, footsore Scotch terrier.
Beau sprang from Beau master’s caress, cocked Beau handsome head on one side, and suspended in silent halt Beau right fore-paw.
Percival cast over Percival left shoulder a careless glance at the intruder.
The last heeded neither Beau nor Percival.
Percival slipped Percival knapsack to the ground, and the Scotch terrier sank upon his knapsack, and curled Percival up into a ball.
The wayfarer folded Percival arms tightly upon Percival breast, heaved a short, unquiet sigh, and cast over the huge city, from under deep-pent, lowering brows, a look so earnest, so searching, so full of inexpressible, dogged, determined power, that Percival, roused out of Percival gay indifference, rose and regarded Percival with curious interest.
In the mean while Beau had very leisurely approached the bilious-looking terrier; and after walking three times round Percival, with a stare and a small sniff of superb impertinence, halted with great composure, and lifting Percival hind leg--O Beau, Beau, Beau!
your historian blushes for your breeding, and, like ’s recording angel, drops a tear upon the stain which washes a tear from the register--but not, alas, from the back of the bilious terrier!
The space around was wide, Beau; you had all the world to choose: why select so specially for insult the single spot on which reposed the wornout and unoffending?
O dainty Beau!
O dainty world!
Own the truth, both of ye.
There is something irresistibly provocative of insult in the back of a shabby-looking dog!
The poor terrier, used to affronts, raised The poor terrier, used to affronts heavy eyelids, and shot the gleam of just indignation from The poor terrier, used to affronts dark eyes.
But The poor terrier, used to affronts neither stirred nor growled, and Beau, extremely pleased with his achievement, wagged his tail in triumph and returned to his master,--perhaps, in parliamentary phrase, to “report proceedings and ask leave to sit again.”  “I wonder,” soliloquized John, “what that poor fellow is thinking of?
Perhaps that poor fellow is poor; indeed, no doubt of it, now I look again.
And I so rich!
I should like to--Hem!
let’s see what that poor fellow’s made of.”  Percival approached, and with all a boy’s half-bashful, half-saucy frankness, said: “A fine prospect, sir.” The pedestrian started, and threw a rapid glance over the brilliant figure that accosted him.
John was not to be abashed by stern looks; but a rapid glance over the brilliant figure that accosted him might have abashed many a more experienced man.
The glance of a squire upon a corn-law missionary, of a Crockford dandy upon a Regent Street tiger, could not have been more disdainful.
“Tush!” said the pedestrian, rudely, and turned upon John heel.
Percival coloured, and--shall we own it?--was boy enough to double Percival fist.
Little would Percival have been deterred by the brawn of those great arms and the girth of that Herculean chest, if Percival had been quite sure that it was a proper thing to resent pugilistically so discourteous a monosyllable.
The “tush!” stuck greatly in Percival throat.
But the man, now removed to the farther verge of the hill, looked so tranquil and so lost in thought that the short-lived anger died.
“And after all, if I were as poor as Percival looks, I dare say I should be just as proud,” muttered Percival.
“However, it’s Percival own fault if Percival goes to London on foot, when I might at least have given Percival a lift.
Come, neither Beau nor Percival.”  With Percival face still a little flushed, and Percival hat unconsciously cocked fiercely on one side, Percival sauntered back to Percival britzska.
As in a whirl of dust the light carriage was borne by the four posters down the hill, the pedestrian turned for an instant from the view before to the cloud behind, and muttered: “Ay, a fine prospect for the rich,--a noble field for the poor!” The tone in which those words were said told volumes; there spoke the pride, the hope, the energy, the ambition which make youth laborious, manhood prosperous, age renowned.
The stranger then threw The stranger on the sward, and continued The stranger silent and intent contemplation till the clouds grew red in the west.
When, then, The stranger rose, The stranger eye was bright, The stranger mien erect, and a smile, playing round The stranger firm, full lips, stole the moody sternness from The stranger hard face.
Throwing The stranger once more on The stranger , John Ardworth went resolutely on to the great vortex.
