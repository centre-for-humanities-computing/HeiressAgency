 Dalibard had undertaken to get Lucretia from the house,--in fact, her approaching marriage rendered necessary a communication with Mr. Parchmount, as executor to her uncle’s will, relative to the transfer of her portion; and she had asked Dalibard to accompany her thither; for her pride shrank from receiving the lawyer in the shabby parlour of the shabby lodging-house; she therefore, that evening, fixed the next day, before noon, for the visit. A carriage was hired for the occasion, and when it drove off, Mr. Fielden took his children a walk to Primrose Hill, and called, as was agreed, on Mainwaring by the way.  The carriage had scarcely rattled fifty yards through the street when Dalibard fixed his eyes with deep and solemn commiseration on Lucretia. Hitherto, with masterly art, he had kept aloof from direct explanations with his pupil; he knew that she would distrust no one like himself. The plot was now ripened, and it was time for the main agent to conduct the catastrophe. The look was so expressive that Lucretia felt a chill at her heart, and could not, help exclaiming, “What has happened? You have some terrible tidings to communicate!”  “I have indeed to say that which may, perhaps, cause you to hate me forever; as we hate those who report our afflictions. I must endure this; I have struggled long between my indignation and my compassion. Rouse up your strong mind, and hear me. Mainwaring loves your sister!”  Lucretia uttered a cry that seemed scarcely to come from a human voice,--  “No, no!” she gasped out; “do not tell me. I will hear no more; I will not believe you!”  With an inexpressible pity and softness in his tone, this man, whose career had given him such profound experience in the frailties of the human heart, continued: “I do not ask you to believe me, Lucretia; I would not now speak, if you had not the opportunity to convince yourself. Even those with whom you live are false to you; at this moment they have arranged all, for Mainwaring to steal, in your absence, to your sister. In a few moments more he will be with her; if you yourself would learn what passes between them, you have the power.”  “I have--I have not--not--the courage; drive on--faster--faster.”  Dalibard again was foiled. In this strange cowardice there was something so terrible, yet so touching, that it became sublime,--it was the grasp of a drowning soul at the last plank.  “You are right perhaps,” he said, after a pause; and wisely forbearing all taunt and resistance, he left the heart to its own workings.  Suddenly, Lucretia caught at the check-string. “Stop,” she exclaimed,--“stop! I will not, I cannot, endure this suspense to last through a life! I will learn the worst. Bid him drive back.”  “We must descend and walk; you forget we must enter unsuspected;” and Dalibard, as the carriage stopped, opened the door and let down the steps.  Lucretia recoiled, then pressing one hand to her heart, she descended, without touching the arm held out to her. Dalibard bade the coachman wait, and they walked back to the house.  “Yes, he may see her,” exclaimed Lucretia, her face brightening. “Ah, there you have not deceived me; I see your stratagem,--I despise it; I know she loves him; she has sought this interview. He is so mild and gentle, so fearful to give pain; he has consented, from pity,--that is all. Is he not pledged to me? He, so candid, so ingenuous! There must be truth somewhere in the world. If he is false, where find truth? Dark man, must I look for it in you,--you?”  “It is not my truth I require you to test; I pretend not to truth universal; I can be true to one, as you may yet discover. But I own your belief is not impossible; my interest in you may have made me rash and unjust,--what you may overhear, far from destroying, may confirm forever your happiness. Would that it may be so!”  “It must be so,” returned Lucretia, with a fearful gloom on her brow and in her accent; “I will interpret every word to my own salvation.”  Dalibard’s countenance changed, despite his usual control over it. He had set all his chances upon this cast, and it was more hazardous than he had deemed. He had counted too much upon the jealousy of common natures. After all, how little to the ear of one resolved to deceive herself might pass between these two young persons, meeting not to avow attachment, but to take courage from each other! What restraint might they impose on their feelings! Still, the game must be played out.  As they now neared the house, Dalibard looked carefully round, lest they should encounter Mainwaring on his way to it. He had counted on arriving before the young man could get there.  “But,” said Lucretia, breaking silence, with an ironical smile,--“but--for your tender anxiety for me has, no doubt, provided all means and contrivance, all necessary aids to baseness and eavesdropping, that can assure my happiness--how am I to be present at this interview?”  “I have provided, as you say,” answered Dalibard, in the tone of a man deeply hurt, “those means which I, who have found the world one foe and one traitor, deemed the best to distinguish falsehood from truth. I have arranged that we shall enter the house unsuspected. Mainwaring and your sister will be in the drawing-room; the room next to it will be vacant, as Mr. Fielden is from home: there is but a glass-door between the two chambers.”  “Enough, enough!” and Lucretia turned round and placed her hand lightly on the Provencal’s arm. “The next hour will decide whether the means you suggest to learn truth and defend safety will be familiar or loathsome to me for life,--will decide whether trust is a madness; whether you, my youth’s teacher, are the wisest of men, or only the most dangerous.”  “Believe me, or not, when I say I would rather the decision should condemn me; for I, too, have need of confidence in men.”  Nothing further was said; the dull street was quiet and desolate as usual. Dalibard had taken with him the key of the house-door. The door opened noiselessly; they were in the house. Mainwaring’s cloak was in the hall; he had arrived a few moments before them. Dalibard pointed silently to that evidence in favour of his tale. Lucretia bowed her head but with a look that implied defiance; and (still without a word) she ascended the stairs, and entered the room appointed for concealment. But as she entered, at the farther corner of the chamber she saw Mrs. Fielden seated,--seated, remote and out of hearing. The good-natured woman had yielded to Mainwaring’s prayer, and Susan’s silent look that enforced it, to let their interview be unwitnessed. She did not perceive Lucretia till the last walked glidingly, but firmly, up to her, placed a burning hand on her lips, and whispered: “Hush, betray me not; my happiness for life--Susan’s--his--are at stake; I must hear what passes: it is my fate that is deciding. Hush! I command; for I have the right.”  Mrs. Fielden was awed and startled; and before she could recover even breath, Lucretia had quitted her side and taken her post at the fatal door. She lifted the corner of the curtain from the glass panel, and looked in.  Mainwaring was seated at a little distance from Susan, whose face was turned from her. Mainwaring’s countenance was in full view. But it was Susan’s voice that met her ear; and though sweet and low, it was distinct, and even firm. It was evident from the words that the conference had but just begun.  “Indeed, Mr. Mainwaring, you have nothing to explain, nothing of which to accuse yourself. It was not for this, believe me,”--and here Susan turned her face, and its aspect of heavenly innocence met the dry, lurid eye of the unseen witness,--“not for this, believe me, that I consented to see you. If I did so, it was only because I thought, because I feared from your manner, when we met at times, still more from your evident avoidance to meet me at all, that you were unhappy (for I know you kind and honest),--unhappy at the thought that you had wounded me, and my heart could not bear that, nor, perhaps, my pride either. That you should have forgotten me--”  “Forgotten you!”  “That you should have been captivated,” continued Susan, in a more hurried tone, “by one so superior to me in all things as Lucretia, is very natural. I thought, then--thought only--that nothing could cloud your happiness but some reproach of a conscience too sensitive. For this I have met you,--met you without a thought which Lucretia would have a right to blame, could she read my heart; met you,” and the voice for the first time faltered, “that I might say, ‘Be at peace; it is your sister that addresses you. Requite Lucretia’s love,--it is deep and strong; give her, as she gives to you, a whole heart; and in your happiness I, your sister--sister to both--I shall be blest.’” With a smile inexpressibly touching and ingenuous, she held out her hand as she ceased. Mainwaring sprang forward, and despite her struggle, pressed it to his lips, his heart.  “Oh,” he exclaimed, in broken accents, which gradually became more clear and loud, “what--what have I lost!--lost forever! No, no, I will be worthy of you! I do not, I dare not, say that I love you still! I feel what I owe to Lucretia. How I became first ensnared, infatuated; how, with your image graven so deeply here--”  “Mainwaring--Mr. Mainwaring--I must not hear you. Is this your promise?”  “Yes, you must hear me yet. How I became engaged to your sister,--so different indeed from you,--I start in amaze and bewilderment when I seek to conjecture. But so it was. For me she has forfeited fortune, rank, all which that proud, stern heart so prized and coveted. Heaven is my witness how I have struggled to repay her affection with my own! If I cannot succeed, at least all that faith and gratitude can give are hers. Yes, when I leave you, comforted by your forgiveness, your prayers, I shall have strength to tear you from my heart; it is my duty, my fate. With a firm step I will go to these abhorred nuptials. Oh, shudder not, turn not away. Forgive the word; but I must speak,--my heart will out; yes, abhorred nuptials! Between my grave and the altar, would--would that I had a choice!”  From this burst, which in vain from time to time Susan had sought to check, Mainwaring was startled by an apparition which froze his veins, as a ghost from the grave. The door was thrown open, and Lucretia stood in the aperture,--stood, gazing on him, face to face; and her own was so colourless, so rigid, so locked in its livid and awful solemnity of aspect that it was, indeed, as one risen from the dead.  Dismayed by the abrupt cry and the changed face of her lover, Susan turned and beheld her sister. With the impulse of the pierced and loving heart, which divined all the agony inflicted, she sprang to Lucretia’s side, she fell to the ground and clasped her knees.  “Do not heed, do not believe him; it is but the frenzy of a moment. He spoke but to deceive me,--me, who loved him once! Mine alone, mine is the crime. He knows all your worth. Pity--pity--pity on yourself, on him, on me!”  Lucretia’s eyes fell with the glare of a fiend upon the imploring face lifted to her own. Her lips moved, but no sound was audible. At length she drew herself from her sister’s clasp, and walked steadily up to Mainwaring. She surveyed him with a calm and cruel gaze, as if she enjoyed his shame and terror. Before, however, she spoke, Mrs. Fielden, who had watched, as one spellbound, Lucretia’s movements, and, without hearing what had passed, had the full foreboding of what would ensue, but had not stirred till Lucretia herself terminated the suspense and broke the charm of her awe,--before she spoke, Mrs. Fielden rushed in, and giving vent to her agitation in loud sobs, as she threw her arms round Susan, who was still kneeling on the floor, brought something of grotesque to the more tragic and fearful character of the scene.  “My uncle was right; there is neither courage nor honour in the low-born! He, the schemer, too, is right. All hollow,--all false!” Thus said Lucretia, with a strange sort of musing accent, at first scornful, at last only quietly abstracted. “Rise, sir,” she then added, with her most imperious tone; “do you not hear your Susan weep? Do you fear in my presence to console her? Coward to her, as forsworn to me! Go, sir, you are free!”  “Hear me,” faltered Mainwaring, attempting to seize her hand; “I do not ask you to forgive; but--”  “Forgive, sir!” interrupted Lucretia, rearing her head, and with a look of freezing and unspeakable majesty. “There is only one person here who needs a pardon; but her fault is inexpiable: it is the woman who stooped beneath her--”  With these words, hurled from her with a scorn which crushed while it galled, she mechanically drew round her form her black mantle; her eye glanced on the deep mourning of the garment, and her memory recalled all that love had cost her; but she added no other reproach. Slowly she turned away. Passing Susan, who lay senseless in Mrs. Fielden’s arms, she paused, and kissed her forehead.  “When she recovers, madam,” she said to Mrs. Fielden, who was moved and astonished by this softness, “say that Lucretia Clavering uttered a vow when she kissed the brow of William Mainwaring’s future wife!”  Olivier Dalibard was still seated in the parlour below when Lucretia entered. Her face yet retained its almost unearthly rigidity and calm; but a sort of darkness had come over its ashen pallor,--that shade so indescribable, which is seen in the human face, after long illness, a day or two before death. Dalibard was appalled; for he had too often seen that hue in the dying not to recognize it now. His emotion was sufficiently genuine to give more than usual earnestness to his voice and gesture, as he poured out every word that spoke sympathy and soothing. For a long time Lucretia did not seem to hear him; at last her face softened,--the ice broke.  “Motherless, friendless, lone, alone forever, undone, undone!” she murmured. Her head sank upon the shoulder of her fearful counsellor, unconscious of its resting-place, and she burst into tears,--tears which perhaps saved her reason or her life.
