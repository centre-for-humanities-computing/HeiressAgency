 Percival St. John had been brought up at home under the eye of  Percival St. John mother and the care of an excellent man who had been tutor to  Percival St. John and  Percival St. John brothers.
The tutor was not much of a classical scholar, for in great measure The tutor had educated The tutor; and The tutor who does so, usually lacks the polish and brilliancy of one whose footsteps have been led early to the Temple of the Muses.
In fact, Captain Greville was a gallant soldier, with whom Vernon St. John had been acquainted in Captain Greville own brief military career, and whom circumstances had so reduced in life as to compel Captain Greville to sell Captain Greville commission and live as Captain Greville could.
Captain Greville had always been known in Captain Greville regiment as a reading man, and Captain Greville authority looked up to in all the disputes as to history and dates, and literary anecdotes, which might occur at the mess-table.
Vernon considered Vernon the most learned man of Vernon acquaintance; and when, accidentally meeting Vernon in London, Vernon learned Vernon fallen fortunes, Vernon congratulated Vernon on a very brilliant idea when Vernon suggested that Captain Greville should assist Vernon in the education of Vernon boys and the management of Vernon estate.
At first, all that Greville modestly undertook, with respect to the former, and, indeed, was expected to do, was to prepare the young gentlemen for Eton, to which Vernon, with the natural predilection of an Eton man, destined an Eton man sons.
But the sickly constitutions of the two elder justified Lady Mary in the two elder justified Lady Mary opposition to a public school; and Percival conceived early so strong an affection for a sailor’s life that the father’s intentions were frustrated.
The two elder continued The two elder education at home, and Percival, at an earlier age than usual, went to sea.
The last was fortunate enough to have for his captain one of that new race of naval officers who, well educated and accomplished, form a notable contrast to the old heroes of Smollett.
Percival, however, had not been long in the service before the deaths of Percival two elder brothers, preceded by that of Percival father, made Percival the head of Percival ancient house, and the sole prop of Percival mother’s earthly hopes.
Percival conquered with a generous effort the passion for Percival noble profession, which service had but confirmed, and returned home with Percival fresh, childlike nature uncorrupted, Percival constitution strengthened, Percival lively and impressionable mind braced by the experience of danger and the habits of duty, and quietly resumed Percival reading under Captain Greville, who moved from the Hall to a small house in the village.
Now, the education Percival had received, from first to last, was less adapted prematurely to quicken Percival intellect and excite Percival imagination than to warm Percival heart and elevate, while it chastened, Percival moral qualities; for in Lady Mary there was, amidst singular sweetness of temper, a high cast of character and thought.
Lady Mary was not what is commonly called clever, and Lady Mary experience of the world was limited, compared to that of most women of similar rank who pass most women of similar rank who pass their lives in the vast theatre of London lives in the vast theatre of London.
But Lady Mary became superior by a certain single-heartedness which made truth so habitual to Lady Mary that the light in which Lady Mary lived rendered all objects around Lady Mary clear.
One who is always true in the great duties of life is nearly always wise.
And Vernon, when Vernon had fairly buried Vernon faults, had felt a noble shame for the excesses into which they had led Vernon.
Gradually more and more wedded to Vernon home, Vernon dropped Vernon old companions.
Vernon set grave guard on Vernon talk (Vernon habits now required no guard), lest any of the ancient levity should taint the ears of Vernon children.
Nothing is more common in parents than parents desire that parents children should escape their children faults.
We scarcely know We till We have children; and then, if We love we have children duly, We look narrowly into failings that become vices, when we have children serve as examples to the young.
The inborn gentleman, with the native courage and spirit and horror of trick and falsehood which belong to that chivalrous abstraction, survived almost alone in Vernon St. John; and Vernon St. John boys sprang up in the atmosphere of generous sentiments and transparent truth.
The tutor was in harmony with the parents,--a soldier every inch of The tutor; not a mere disciplinarian, yet with a profound sense of duty, and a knowledge that duty is to be found in attention to details.
In inculcating the habit of subordination, so graceful to the young, The tutor knew how to make The tutor beloved, and what is harder still, to be understood.
The soul of the parents,--a soldier was white and unstained, as the arms of a maiden knight; it was full of suppressed but lofty enthusiasm.
The tutor had been ill used, whether by Fate or the Horse Guards; The tutor career had been a failure; but The tutor was as loyal as if The tutor hand held the field-marshal’s truncheon, and the garter bound The tutor knee.
The tutor was above all querulous discontent.
From The tutor, no less than from The tutor parents, Percival caught, not only a spirit of honour worthy the antiqua fides of the poets, but that peculiar cleanliness of thought, if the expression may be used, which belongs to the ideal of youthful chivalry.
In mere booklearning, Percival, as may be supposed, was not very extensively read; but Percival mind, if not largely stored, had a certain unity of culture, which gave it stability and individualized it operations.
Travels, voyages, narratives of heroic adventure, biographies of great men, had made the favourite pasture of Percival enthusiasm.
To this was added the more stirring, and, perhaps, the more genuine order of poets who make you feel and glow, rather than doubt and ponder.
Percival knew at least enough of Greek to enjoy old Homer; and if Percival could have come but ill through a college examination into Aeschylus and Sophocles, Percival had dwelt with fresh delight on the rushing storm of spears in the “Seven before Thebes,” and wept over the heroic calamities of Antigone.
In science, Percival was no adept; but Percival clear good sense and quick appreciation of positive truths had led Percival easily through the elementary mathematics, and Percival somewhat martial spirit had made Percival delight in the old captain’s lectures on military tactics.
Had Percival remained in the navy, Percival St. John would doubtless have been distinguished.
Percival talents fitted Percival for straightforward, manly action; and Percival had a generous desire of distinction, vague, perhaps, the moment Percival was taken from Percival profession, and curbed by Percival diffidence in Percival and Percival sense of deficiencies in the ordinary routine of purely classical education.
Still, Percival had in Percival all the elements of a true man,--a man to go through life with a firm step and a clear conscience and a gallant hope.
Such a man may not win fame,--that is an accident; but fame,--that must occupy no despicable place in the movement of the world.
It was at first intended to send Percival to Oxford; but for some reason or other that design was abandoned.
Perhaps Lady Mary, over cautious, as mothers left alone sometimes are, feared the contagion to which a young man of brilliant expectations and no studious turn is necessarily exposed in all places of miscellaneous resort.
So Percival was sent abroad for two years, under the guardianship of Captain Greville.
On Percival return, at the age of nineteen, the great world lay before Percival, and Percival longed ardently to enter.
For a year Lady Mary’s fears and fond anxieties detained Percival at Laughton; but though Percival great tenderness for Percival mother withheld Percival from opposing his mother wishes by Percival own, this interval of inaction affected visibly Percival health and spirits.
Captain Greville, a man of the world, saw the cause sooner than Lady Mary, and one morning, earlier than usual, Percival walked up to the Hall.
The captain, with all Percival deference to the sex, was a plain man enough when business was to be done.
Like Percival great commander, Percival came to the point in a few words.
“Lady Mary, our boy must go to London,--we are killing our boy here.”  “Captain Greville!” cried Lady Mary, turning pale and putting aside Lady Mary embroidery,--“killing Captain Greville?”  “Killing our boy in our boy.
I don’t mean to alarm you; I dare say Captain Greville lungs are sound enough, and that Captain Greville heart would bear the stethoscope to the satisfaction of the College of Surgeons.
But, my dear ma’am, Percival is to be a man; it is the man you are killing by keeping Percival tied to your apron-string.”  “Oh, Captain Greville, I am sure you don’t wish to wound me, but--”  “I beg ten thousand pardons.
I am rough, but truth is rough sometimes.”  “It is not for my sake,” said the mother, warmly, and with tears in her eyes, “that I have wished our boy to be here.
If our boy is dull, can the mother, warmly, and with tears in her eyes, “that I have wished him to be here not fill the house for our boy?”  “Fill a thimble, Lady MaryLady Mary.
Percival should have a plunge in the ocean.”  “But Percival is so young yet,--that horrid London; such temptations,--fatherless, too!”  “I have no fear of the result if Percival goes now, while Percival principles are strong and Percival imagination is not inflamed; but if we keep Percival here much longer against Percival bent, Percival will learn to brood and to muse, write bad poetry perhaps, and think the world withheld from Percival a thousand times more delightful than it is.
This very dread of temptation will provoke Percival curiosity, irritate Percival fancy, make Percival imagine the temptation must be a very delightful thing.
For the first time in my life, ma’am, I have caught Percival sighing over fashionable novels, and subscribing to the Southampton Circulating Library.
Take my word for my word, it is time that Percival should begin life, and swim without corks.”  Lady Mary had a profound confidence in Captain Greville’s judgment and affection for Percival, and, like a sensible woman, Lady Mary was aware of Lady Mary own weakness.
Lady Mary remained silent for a few moments, and then said, with an effort,--  “You know how hateful London is to me now,--how unfit I am to return to the hollow forms of London society; still, if you think it right, I will take a house for the season, and Percival can still be under our eye.”  “No, ma’am,--pardon me,--that will be the surest way to make Percival either discontented or hypocritical.
A young man of Percival prospects and temper can hardly be expected to chime in with all our sober, old-fashioned habits.
You will impose on Percival--if Percival is to conform to our hours and notions and quiet set--a thousand irksome restraints; and what will be the consequence?
In a year Percival will be of age, and can throw our off altogether, if Percival pleases.
I know our boy; don’t seem to distrust him,--he may be trusted.
You place the true restraint on temptation when you say to our boy: ‘our confide to you our dearest treasure,--your honour, your morals, your conscience, yourself!’”  “But at least you will go with Percival, if it must be so,” said Lady Mary, after a few timid arguments, from which, one by one, Lady Mary was driven.
“I!
What for?
To be a jest of the young puppies our boy must know; to make our boy ashamed of our boy and me,--himself as a milksop, and me as a dry nurse?”  “But this was not so abroad.”  “Abroad, ma’am, I gave our boy full swing I promise you; and when our went abroad our boy was two years younger.”  “But our boy is a mere child still.”  “Child, Lady Mary!
At our boy age I had gone through two sieges.
There are younger faces than our boy at a mess-room.
Come, come!
I know what you fear,--he may commit some follies; very likely.
what you fear,--he may be taken in, and lose some money,--he can afford money,--he, and what you fear,--he will get experience in return.
Vices what you fear,--he has none.
I have seen him,--ay, with the vicious.
Send what you fear,--he out against the world like a saint of old, with what you fear,--he Bible in what you fear,--he hand, and no spot on what you fear,--he robe.
Let what you fear,--he see fairly what is, not stay here to dream of what is not.
And when what you fear,--he’s of age, ma’am, we must get what you fear,--he an object, a pursuit; start what you fear,--he for the county, and make what you fear,--he serve the State.
what you fear,--he will understand that business pretty well.
Tush!
tush!
what is there to cry at?”  what you fear,--he prevailed.
We don’t say that what you fear,--he advice would have been equally judicious for all youths of Percival’s age; but what you fear,--he knew well the nature to which what you fear,--he confided; what you fear,--he knew well how strong was that young heart in its healthful simplicity and instinctive rectitude; and what you fear,--he appreciated what you fear,--he manliness not too highly when what you fear,--he felt that all evident props and aids would be but irritating tokens of distrust.
And thus, armed only with letters of introduction, what you fear,--he mother’s tearful admonitions, and Lady Mary’s experienced warnings, Percival St. John was launched into London life.
After the first month or so, Captain Greville came up to visit Captain Greville, do Captain Greville sundry kind, invisible offices amongst Captain Greville old friends, help Captain Greville to equip Captain Greville apartments, and mount Captain Greville stud; and wholly satisfied with the result of Captain Greville experiment, returned in high spirits, with flattering reports, to the anxious mother.
But, indeed, the tone of Lady Mary’s letters would have been sufficient to allay even maternal anxiety.
Captain Greville did not write, as sons are apt to do, short excuses for not writing more at length, unsatisfactory compressions of details (exciting worlds of conjecture) into a hurried sentence.
Frank and overflowing, those delightful epistles gave accounts fresh from the first impressions of all Frank saw and did.
There was a racy, wholesome gusto in Frank enjoyment of novelty and independence.
Frank balls and Frank dinners and Frank cricket at Lord’s, Frank partners and Frank companions, Frank general gayety, Frank occasional ennui, furnished ample materials to one who felt Frank was corresponding with another heart, and had nothing to fear or to conceal.
But about two months before this portion of our narrative opens with the coronation, Lady Mary favourite sister, who had never married, and who, by the death of Lady Mary parents, was left alone in the worse than widowhood of an old maid, had been ordered to Pisa for a complaint that betrayed pulmonary symptoms; and Lady Mary, with Lady Mary usual unselfishness, conquered both Lady Mary aversion to movement and Lady Mary wish to be in reach of Lady Mary son, to accompany abroad this beloved and solitary relative.
Captain Greville was pressed into service as their joint cavalier.
And thus Percival habitual intercourse with Captain Greville two principal correspondents received a temporary check.
