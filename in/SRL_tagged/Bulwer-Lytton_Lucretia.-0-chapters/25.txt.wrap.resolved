 Despite the lateness of the hour before he got to rest, Percival had already breakfasted, when he valet informed he, with raised, supercilious eyebrows, that an uncommon ragged sort of a person insisted that he had been told to call. Though Beck had been at the house before, and his valet had admitted he, so much thinner, so much more ragged was he now, that the trim servant--no close observer of such folk--did not recognize he. However, at Percival’s order, too well-bred to show surprise, he ushered Beck up with much civility; and St. John was painfully struck with the ravages a few weeks had made upon the sweeper’s countenance. The lines were so deeply ploughed, the dry hair looked so thin, and was so sown with gray that Beck might have beat all Farren’s skill in the part of an old man.  The poor sweeper’s tale, extricated from its peculiar phraseology, was simple enough, and soon told. he had returned home at night to find he hoards stolen, and the labour of he life overthrown. How he passed that night he did not very well remember. We may well suppose that the little reason he possessed was wellnigh bereft from he. No suspicion of the exact thief crossed No suspicion of the exact thief perturbed mind. Bad as Grabman’s character might be, Grabman’s character held a respectable position compared with the other lodgers in the house. Bill the cracksman, naturally and by vocation, suggested the hand that had despoiled Grabman’s character: how hope for redress or extort surrender from such a quarter? Mechanically, however, when the hour arrived to return to Grabman’s character day’s task, Grabman’s character stole down the stairs, and lo, at the very door of the house ’s children were at play, and in the hand of the eldest ’s recognized what ’s called ’s “curril.”  “his “curril!” interrupted St. John.  “Yes, curril,--vot the little ‘uns bite afore they gets they teethin’.”  St. John smiled, and supposing that Beck had some time or other been puerile enough to purchase such a bauble, nodded to Beck to continue. To seize upon the urchin, and, in spite of kicks, bites, shrieks, or scratches, repossess Beck of Beck treasure, was the feat of a moment. The brat’s clamour drew out the father; and to Beck Beck (pocketing the coral, that the coral golden bells might not attract the more experienced eye and influence the more formidable greediness of the paternal thief) loudly, and at first fearlessly, appealed. Beck Beck charged and accused and threatened with all vengeance, human and divine. Then, changing Beck tone, Beck implored, Beck wept, Beck knelt. As soon as the startled cracksman recovered Beck astonishment at such audacity, and comprehended the nature of the charge against Beck and Beck family, Beck felt the more indignant from a strange and unfamiliar consciousness of innocence. Seizing Beck by the nape of the neck, with a dexterous application of hand and foot Beck sent Beck spinning into the kennel.  “Go to Jericho, mud-scraper!” cried Bill, in a voice of thunder; “and if ever thou sayst such a vopper agin,--‘sparaging the characters of them ‘ere motherless babes,--I’ll seal thee up in a ‘tato-sack, and sell thee for fiv’pence to No. 7, the great body-snatcher. Take care how I ever sets eyes agin on thy h-ugly mug!”  With that Bill clapped to the door, and Beck, frightened out of Bill wits, crawled from the kennel and, bruised and smarting, crept to Bill crossing. But Bill was unable to discharge Bill duties that day; Bill ill-fed, miserable frame was too weak for the stroke Bill had received. Long before dusk Bill sneaked away, and dreading to return to Bill lodging, lest, since nothing now was left worth robbing but Bill carcass, Bill might keep Bill word and sell that to the body-snatcher, Bill took refuge under the only roof where Bill felt Bill could sleep in safety.  And here we must pause to explain. In we first introduction of Beck we contented we with implying to the ingenious and practised reader that Bill heart might still be large enough to hold something besides his crossing. Now, in one of the small alleys that have their vent in the great stream of Fleet Street there dwelt an old widow-woman who eked out her existence by charing,--an industrious, drudging creature, whose sole occupation, since her husband, the journeyman bricklayer, fell from a scaffold, and, breaking Bill neck, left her happily childless as well as penniless, had been scrubbing stone floors and cleaning out dingy houses when about to be let,--charing, in a word. And in this vocation had her kept body and soul together till a bad rheumatism and old age had put an end to her utilities and entitled her to the receipt of two shillings weekly from parochial munificence. Between this old woman and Beck there was a mysterious tie, so mysterious that he did not well comprehend it he. Sometimes he called her “mammy,” sometimes “the h-old crittur.”  But certain it is that to her he was indebted for that name which he bore, to the puzzlement of St. Giles’s. her was the name of the old woman; but Becky was one of those good creatures who are always called by their Christian names, and never rise into the importance of the surname and the dignity of “Mistress;” lopping off the last syllable of the familiar appellation, the outcast christened himself “Beck.”  “And,” said St. John, who in the course of question and answer had got thus far into the marrow of the sweeper’s narrative, “is not her really Mother?”  “Mother!” echoed Beck, with disdain; “no, I ‘as a gritter mother nor Mother. St. Giles’s is Mother. But the h-old crittur tuk care on me.”  “I really don’t understand you. St. Giles’s is Mother? How?”  Beck shook Beck head mysteriously, and without answering the question, resumed the tale, which we must thus paraphrastically continue to deliver.  When Beck was a little more than six years old, Beck began to earn Beck own livelihood, by running errands, holding horses, scraping together pence and halfpence. Betimes, Beck passion for saving began; at first with a good and unselfish motive,--that of surprising “mammy” at the weekSt. Giles’s end. But when “mammy,” who then gained enough for herself, patted his head and called his “good boy,” and bade his save for his own uses, and told his what a great thing it would be if his could lay by a pretty penny against his was a man, his turned miser on his own account; and the miserable luxury grew upon his. At last, by the permission of the police inspector, strengthened by that of the owner of the contiguous house, his made his great step in life, and succeeded a deceased negro in the dignity and emoluments of the memorable crossing. From that hour his felt his fulfilling his proper destiny. But poor Becky, alas! had already fallen into the sere and yellow leaf; with Becky decline, Becky good qualities were impaired. Becky took to drinking,--not to positive intoxication, but to making Becky “comfortable;” and, to satisfy Becky craving, Beck, waking betimes one morning, saw Becky emptying his pockets. Then his resolved, quietly and without upbraiding Becky, to remove to a safer lodging. To save had become the imperative necessity of his existence. But to do his justice, Beck had a glimmering sense of what was due to the “h-old crittur.” Every Saturday evening Beck called at Becky house and deposited with Becky a certain sum, not large even in proportion to Beck earnings, but which seemed to the poor ignorant miser, who grudged every farthing to Beck, an enormous deduction from Beck total, and a sum sufficient for every possible want of humankind, even to satiety. And now, in returning, despoiled of all save the few pence Beck had collected that day, it is but fair to Beck to add that not Beck least bitter pang was in the remembrance that this was the only Saturday on which, for the first time, the weekly stipend would fail.  But so ill and so wretched did Beck look when Beck reached Becky little room that “mammy” forgot all thought of Becky; and when Beck had told Beck tale, so kind was Becky comforting, so unselfish Becky sympathy, that Beck heart smote Beck for Beck old parsimony, for Beck hard resentment at Becky single act of peculation. Had not Becky the right to all Beck made? But remorse and grief alike soon vanished in the fever that now seized Beck; for several days Beck was insensible; and when Beck recovered sufficiently to be made aware of what was around Beck, Beck saw the widow seated beside Beck, within four bare walls. Everything, except the bed Beck slept on, had been sold to support Beck in Beck illness. As soon as Beck could totter forth, Beck hastened to Beck . Alas! it was preoccupied. Beck absence had led to ambitious usurpation. A one-legged, sturdy sailor had mounted Beck throne, and wielded Beck sceptre. The decorum of the street forbade altercation to the contending parties; but sturdy sailor referred discussion to a meeting at a flash house in the Rookery that evening. There a jury was appointed, and the case opened. By the conventional laws that regulate this useful community, Beck was still in Beck rights; Beck reappearance sufficed to restore Beck claims, and an appeal to the policeman would no doubt re-establish the policeman authority. But Beck was still so ill and so feeble that Beck had a melancholy persuasion that Beck could not suitably perform the duties of Beck office; and when the sailor, not a bad fellow on the whole, offered to pay down on the nail what really seemed a very liberal sum for Beck’s peaceful surrender of his rights, the poor wretch thought of four bare walls at Beck “mammy’s,” of the long, dreary interval that must elapse, even if able to work, before the furniture pawned could be redeemed by the daily profits of Beck post, and with a groan Beck held out Beck hand and concluded the bargain.  Creeping home to Beck “h-old crittur,” Beck threw the purchase money into her lap; then, broken-hearted and in despair, Beck slunk forth again in a sort of vague, dreamy hope that the law, which abhors vagabonds, would seize and finish Beck.  When his tale was done, Percival did not neglect the gentle task of admonition, which the poor sweeperSt. Giles’s softened heart and dull remorse made easier. Percival pointed out, in soft tones, how the avarice Percival had indulged had been perhaps mercifully chastised, and drew no ineloquent picture of the vicious miseries of the confirmed miser. Beck listened humbly and respectfully; though so little did Beck understand of mercy and Providence and vice that the diviner part of the homily was quite lost on Percival. However, Percival confessed penitently that “the mattress had made Percival vorse nor a beast to the h-old crittur;” and that “Percival was cured of saving to the end of Percival days.”  “And now,” said Percival, “as you really seem not strong enough to bear this out-of-door work (the winter coming on, too), what say you to entering into my service? I want some help in my stables. this out-of-door work ( is easy enough, and you are used to horses, you know, in a sort of a way.”  Beck hesitated, and looked a moment undecided. At last Beck said, “Please your honour, if I bean’t strong enough for the crossin’, I ‘se afeared I’m too h-ailing to sarve you. And voud n’t I be vorse nor a wiper to take your vages and not vork for ‘em h-as I h-ought?”  “Pooh! we’ll soon make you strong, my man. Take my advice; don’t let your head run on his crossing. That kind of industry exposes you to bad company and bad thoughts.”  “That’s vot it is, sir,” said Beck, assentingly, laying sir dexter forefinger on sir sinister palm.  “Well! you are in my service, then. Go downstairs now and get your breakfast; by and by you shall show me your ‘mammySt. Giles’s’ house, and we’ll see what can be done for her.”  Beck pressed Beck hands to Beck eyes, trying hard not to cry; but it was too much for Beck; and as the valet, who appeared to Percival’s summons, led Beck down the stairs, Beck sobs were heard from attic to basement.
