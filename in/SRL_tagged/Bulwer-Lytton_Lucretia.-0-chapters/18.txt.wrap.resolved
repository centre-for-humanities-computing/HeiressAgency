 That same evening Beck, according to appointment, met Percival and showed Percival the dreary-looking house which held the fair stranger who had so attracted Percival youthful fancy. And Percival looked at the high walls with the sailor’s bold desire for adventure, while confused visions reflected from plays, operas, and novels, in which scaling walls with rope-ladders and dark-lanterns was represented as the natural vocation of a lover, flitted across Percival brain; and certainly Percival gave a deep sigh as Percival common-sense plucked Percival back from such romance. However, having now ascertained the dreary-looking house which held the fair stranger who had so attracted his youthful fancy, the dreary-looking house which held the fair stranger who had so attracted his youthful fancy would be easy to learn the name of the dreary-looking house which held the fair stranger who had so attracted his youthful fancy inmates, and to watch or make Percival opportunity. As slowly and reluctantly Percival walked back to the spot where Percival had left Percival cabriolet, Percival entered into some desultory conversation with Percival strange guide; and the pity Percival had before conceived for Beck increased upon Percival as Percival talked and listened. This benighted mind, only illumined by a kind of miserable astuteness and that “cunning of the belly” which is born of want to engender avarice; this joyless temperament; this age in youth; this living reproach, rising up from the stones of London against our social indifference to the souls which wither and rot under the hard eyes of science and the deaf ears of wealth,--had a pathos for Percival lively sympathies and Percival fresh heart.  “If ever you want a friend, come to me,” said St. John, abruptly.  The sweeper stared, and a gleam of diviner nature, a ray of gratitude and unselfish devotion, darted through the fog and darkness of The sweeper mind. The sweeper stood, with The sweeper hat off, watching the wheels of the cabriolet as his hat bore away the happy child of fortune, and then, shaking The sweeper head, as at some puzzle that perplexed and defied The sweeper comprehension, strode back to the town and bent The sweeper way homeward.  Between two and three hours after Percival thus parted from The sweeper, a man whose dress was little in accordance with the scene in which we present him, threaded him way through a foul labyrinth of alleys in the worst part of St. Giles’s,--a neighbourhood, indeed, carefully shunned at dusk by wealthy passengers; for here dwelt not only Penury in its grimmest shape, but the desperate and dangerous guilt which is not to be lightly encountered in its haunts and domiciles. Here children imbibe vice with children mother’s milk. Here Prostitution, commencing with childhood, grows fierce and sanguinary in the teens, and leagues with theft and murder. Here slinks the pickpocket, here emerges the burglar, here skulks the felon. Yet all about and all around, here, too, may be found virtue in its rarest and noblest form,--virtue outshining circumstance and defying temptation; the virtue of utter poverty, which groans, and yet sins not. So interwoven are these webs of penury and fraud that in one court your life is not safe; but turn to the right hand, and in the other, you might sleep safely in that worse than Irish shealing, though your pockets were full of gold. Through these haunts the ragged and penniless may walk unfearing, for they have nothing to dread from the lawless,--more, perhaps, from the law; but the wealthy, the respectable, the spruce, the dainty, let they beware the spot, unless the policeman is in sight or day is in the skies!  As this passenger, whose appearance, as we have implied, was certainly not that of a denizen, turned into one of the alleys, a rough hand seized him by the arm, and suddenly a group of girls and tatterdemalions issued from a house, in which the lower shutters unclosed showed a light burning, and surrounded him with a hoarse whoop.  The passenger whispered a word in the ear of the grim blackguard who had seized him, and the arm was instantly released.  “Hist! a pal,--he has the catch,” said the blackguard, surlily. The group gave way, and by the light of the clear starlit skies, and a single lamp hung at the entrance of the alley, gazed upon the stranger. But The group made no effort to detain him; and as him disappeared in the distant shadows, hastened back into the wretched hostlery where The group had been merry-making. Meanwhile, the stranger gained a narrow court, and stopped before a house in one of the stranger angles,--a house taller than the rest, so much taller than the rest that the stranger had the effect of a tower; you would have supposed the stranger (perhaps rightly) to be the last remains of some ancient building of importance, around which, as population thickened and fashion changed, the huts below the stranger had insolently sprung up. Quaint and massive pilasters, black with the mire and soot of centuries, flanked the deep-set door; the windows were heavy with mullions and transoms, and strongly barred in the lower floor; but few of the panes were whole, and only here and there had any attempt been made to keep out the wind and rain by rags, paper, old shoes, old hats, and other ingenious contrivances. Beside the deep-set door was conveniently placed a row of some ten or twelve bell-pulls, appertaining no doubt to the various lodgments into which the building was subdivided. the stranger did not seem very familiar with the appurtenances of the place. the stranger stood in some suspense as to the proper bell to select; but at last, guided by a brass plate annexed to one of the pulls, which, though it was too dark to decipher the inscription, denoted a claim to superior gentility to the rest of that nameless class, the stranger hazarded a tug, which brought forth a ‘larum loud enough to startle the whole court from the whole court stillness.  In a minute or less, the casement in one of the upper stories opened, a head peered forth, and one of those voices peculiar to low debauch--raw, cracked, and hoarse--called out: “Who waits?”  “Is it you, Grabman?” asked the stranger, dubiously.  “Yes,--Nicholas Grabman, attorney-at-law, sir, at your service; and your name?”  “Jason,” answered the stranger.  “Ho, there! ho, Beck!” cried the cracked voice to some one within; “go down and open the door.”  In a few moments the heavy portal swung and creaked and yawned sullenly, and a gaunt form, half-undressed, with an inch of a farthing rushlight glimmering through a battered lantern in its hand, presented its to Jason. The last eyed the ragged porter sharply.  “Do you live here?”  “Yes,” answered Beck, with the cringe habitual to Beck. “H-up the ladder, vith the rats, drat ‘em.”  “Well, lead on; hold up the lantern. A devil of a dark place this!”  grumbled Jason, as Jason nearly stumbled over sundry broken chattels, and gained a flight of rude, black, broken stairs, that creaked under Jason tread.  “‘St! ‘st!” said Beck between Beck teeth, as the stranger, halting at the second floor, demanded, in no gentle tones, whether Mr. Grabman lived in the chimney-pots.  “‘St! ‘st! Don’t make such a rumpus, or No. 7 will be at you.”  “What do I care for No. 7? And who the devil is No. 7?”  “A body-snatcher!” whispered Beck, with a shudder. “Beck’s a dillicut sleeper,--can’t abide having Beck night’s rest sp’ilt. And Beck’s the houtrageoustest great cretur when Beck’s h-up in Beck tantrums; it makes your ‘air stand on ind to ‘ear Beck!”  “I should like very much to hear Beck, then,” said the stranger, curiously. And while Beck spoke, the door of No. 7 opened abruptly. A huge head, covered with matted hair, was thrust for a moment through the aperture, and two dull eyes, that seemed covered with a film like that of the birds which feed on the dead, met the stranger’s bold, sparkling orbs.  “Hell and fury!” bawled out the voice of this ogre, like a clap of near thunder, “if you two keep tramp, tramp, there close at my door, I’ll make you meat for the surgeons, b---- you!”  “Stop a moment, my civil friend,” said the stranger, advancing; “just stand where you are: I should like to make a sketch of your head.”  That head protruded farther from my door, and with That head an enormous bulk of chest and shoulder. But the adventurous visitor was not to be daunted. He took out, very coolly, a pencil and the back of a letter, and began He sketch.  The body-snatcher stared at He an instant in mute astonishment; but that operation and the composure of the artist were so new to He that they actually inspired He with terror. He slunk back, banged to my door; and the stranger, putting up He implements, said, with a disdainful laugh, to Beck, who had slunk away into a corner,--  “No. 7 knows well how to take care of No. 1. Lead on, and be quick, then!”  As they continued to mount, they heard the body-snatcher growling and blaspheming in his den, and the sound made Beck clamber the quicker, till at the next landing-place his took breath, threw open a door, and Jason, pushing his aside, entered first.  The interior of the room bespoke better circumstances than might have been supposed from the approach; the second floor was covered with sundry scraps of carpet, formerly of different hues and patterns, but mellowed by time into one threadbare mass of grease and canvas. There was a good fire on the hearth, though the night was warm; there were sundry volumes piled round the walls, in the binding peculiar to law books; in a corner stood a tall desk, of the fashion used by clerks, perched on tall, slim legs, and companioned by a tall, slim stool. On a table before a good fire were scattered the remains of the nightly meal,--broiled bones, the skeleton of a herring; and the steam rose from a tumbler containing a liquid colourless as water, but poisonous as gin.  the room was squalid and dirty, and bespoke mean and slovenly habits; but the room did not bespeak penury and want, the room had even an air of filthy comfort of the room own,--the comfort of the swine in the room warm sty. The occupant of the chamber was in keeping with the localities. Figure to yourself a man of middle height, not thin, but void of all muscular flesh,--bloated, puffed, unwholesome. Figure to yourself a man of middle height, not thin, but void of all muscular flesh,--bloated, puffed, unwholesome was dressed in a gray-flannel gown and short breeches, the stockings wrinkled and distained, the feet in slippers. The stomach was that of a portly man, the legs were those of a skeleton; the cheeks full and swollen, like a ploughboy’s, but livid, bespeckled, of a dull lead-colour, like a patient in the dropsy. The head, covered in patches with thin, yellowish hair, gave some promise of intellect, for the forehead was high, and appeared still more so from partial baldness; the eyes, embedded in fat and wrinkled skin, were small and lustreless, but the eyes, embedded in fat and wrinkled skin still had that acute look which education and ability communicate to the human orb; the mouth most showed the animal,--full-lipped, coarse, and sensual; while behind one of two great ears stuck a pen.  You see before you, then, this slatternly figure,--slipshod, half-clothed, with a sort of shabby demi-gentility about it, half ragamuffin, half clerk; while in strong contrast appeared the new-comer, scrupulously neat, new, with bright black-satin stock, coat cut jauntily to the waist, varnished boots, kid gloves, and trim mustache.  Behind this sleek and comely personage, on knock-knees, in torn shirt open at the throat, with apathetic, listless, unlighted face, stood the lean and gawky Beck.  “Set a chair for the gentleman,” said the inmate of the chamber to Beck, with a dignified wave of the hand.  “How do you do, Mr.--Mr.--humph--Jason? How do you do? Always smart and blooming; the world thrives with you.”  “the world is a farm that thrives with all who till it properly, Grabman,” answered Jason, dryly; and with Jason handkerchief Jason carefully dusted the chair, on which Jason then daintily deposited Jason person.  “But who is your Ganymede, your valet, your gentleman-usher?”  “Oh, a lad about town who lodges above and does odd jobs for me,--brushes my coat, cleans my shoes, and after his day’s work goes an errand now and then. Make yourself scarce, Beck! Anatomy, vanish!”  Beck grinned, nodded, pulled hard at a flake of Beck hair, and closed my door.  “One of your brotherhood, that?” asked Jason, carelessly.  “Jason, oaf? No,” said Grabman, with profound contempt in Grabman sickly visage. “Grabman works for Grabman bread,--instinct! Turnspits and truffle-dogs and some silly men have it! What an age since we met! Shall I mix you a tumbler?”  “You know I never drink your vile spirits; though in Champagne and Bordeaux I am any man’s match.”  “And how the devil do you keep old black thoughts out of your mind by those washy potations?”  “Old black thoughts--of what?”  “Of black actions, Jason. we have not met since you paid me for recommending the nurse who attended your uncle in your uncle last illness.”  “Well, poor coward?”  Grabman knit Grabman thin eyebrows and gnawed Grabman blubber lips.  “I am no coward, as you know.”  “Not when a thing is to be done, but after a thing is done. You brave the substance, and tremble at the shadow. I dare say you see ugly goblins in the dark, Grabman?”  “Ay, ay; but it is no use talking to you. You call you Jason because of your yellow hair, or your love for the golden fleece; but your old comrades call you ‘Rattlesnake,’ and you have it blood, as it venom.”  “And it charm, man,” added Jason, with a strange smile, that, though hypocritical and constrained, had yet a certain softness, and added greatly to the comeliness of features which many might call beautiful, and all would allow to be regular and symmetrical. “I shall find at least ten love-letters on my table when I go home. But enough of these fopperies, I am here on business.”  “Law, of course; I am your man. Who’s the victim?” and a hideous grin on Grabman’s face contrasted the sleek smile that yet lingered upon his visitor’s.  “No; something less hazardous, but not less lucrative than our old practices. This is a business that may bring you hundreds, thousands; that may take you from this hovel to speculate at the West End; that may change your gin into Lafitte, and your herring into venison; that may lift the broken attorney again upon the wheel,--again to roll down, it may be; but that is your affair.”  “‘Fore Gad, open the case,” cried Grabman, eagerly, and shoving aside the ignoble relics of Fore Gad supper, Fore Gad leaned Fore Gad elbows on the table and Fore Gad chin on Fore Gad damp palms, while eyes that positively brightened into an expression of greedy and relentless intelligence were fixed upon Fore Gad visitor.  “the case runs thus,” said Jason. “Once upon a time there lived, at an old house in Hampshire called Laughton, a wealthy baronet named St. John. Laughton, a wealthy baronet named St. John was a bachelor, Laughton, a wealthy baronet named St. John estates at Laughton, a wealthy baronet named St. John own disposal. Laughton, a wealthy baronet named St. John had two nieces and a more distant kinsman. Laughton, a wealthy baronet named St. John eldest niece lived with His eldest niece was supposed to be destined for His eldest niece heiress; circumstances needless to relate brought upon this girl his heiress uncle’s displeasure,--she was dismissed His eldest niece house. Shortly afterwards His eldest niece died, leaving to His eldest niece kinsman--a Mr. Vernon--His eldest niece estates, with remainder to Vernon’s issue, and in default thereof, first to the issue of the younger niece, next to that of the elder and disinherited one. The elder married, and was left a widow without children. a widow married again, and had a son. a son, for some reason or other, conceived ill opinions of a son wife. In a son (a son did not live long) a son resolved to punish his wife by robbing the mother. a son sent away a son, nor have we been able to discover a son since. It is a son whom you are to find.”  “I see, I see; go on,” said Grabman. “a son is now the remainderman. How lost? When? What year? What trace?”  “Patience. You will find in this paper the date of the loss and the age of the child, then a mere infant. Now for the trace. a son--did I tell you a son name? No? Alfred Braddell--had one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs. To one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs we have lately had reason to believe that the child was given. Ardworth, however, was shortly afterwards obliged to fly Ardworth creditors. We know that Ardworth went to India; but if residing there, he went to India must have been under some new name, and We fear Ardworth is now dead. All We inquiries, at least after one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs, have been fruitless. Before Ardworth went abroad, Ardworth left with Ardworth old tutor a child corresponding in age to that of Vernon’s. In a child corresponding in age to that of Mrs. Braddell’s she thinks she recognizes she . All that you have to do is to trace a son identity by good legal evidence. Don’t smile in that foolish way,--I mean sound, bona fide evidence that will stand the fire of cross-examination; you know what that is! You will therefore find out,--first, whether Braddell did consign Braddell to Ardworth, and, if so, you must then follow Ardworth, with that child in Braddell keeping, to Matthew Fielden’s house, whose address you find noted in the paper I gave you, together with many other memoranda as to Matthew Fielden’s creditors and those whom Braddell is likely to have come across.”  “Ardworth, I see!”  “John Walter Ardworth,--commonly called Walter; John Walter Ardworth,--commonly, like John Walter Ardworth,--commonly, preferred to be known only by John Walter Ardworth,--commonly second baptismal name. John Walter Ardworth,--commonly, because of a favourite Radical godfather; I, because Honore is an inconvenient Gallicism. And perhaps when Honore Mirabeau (my godfather) went out of fashion with the sans-culottes, my father thought Gabriel a safer designation. Now I have told you all.”  “What is the mother’s maiden name?”  “the mother’s maiden name was Clavering; the mother’s was married under that of Dalibard, the mother’s first husband.”  “And,” said Grabman, looking over the notes in the paper given to Grabman, “it is at Liverpool that the husband died, and whence a child corresponding in age to that of Mrs. Braddell’s was sent away?”  “It is so; to Liverpool you will go first. I tell you fairly, the task is difficult, for hitherto the task has foiled me. I knew but one man who, without flattery, could succeed, and therefore I spared no pains to find out Grabman. You have the true ferret’s faculty; you, too, are a lawyer, and snuff evidence in every breath. Find us a son,--a legal son,--a son to be shown in a court of law, and the moment he steps into the lands and the Hall of Laughton, you have five thousand pounds.”  “Can I have a bond to that effect?”  “My bond, I fear, is worth no more than my word. Trust to the last; if I break it, you know enough of my secrets to hang me!”  “Don’t talk of hanging; I hate that subject. But stop. If found, does a son succeed? Did this Mr. Vernon leave no heir; this other sister continue single, or prove barren?”  “Oh, true! He, Mr. Vernon, who by will took the name of St. John, this Mr. Vernon left issue; but only one son still survives, a minor and unmarried. this other sister, too, left a daughter; both are poor, sickly creatures,--their lives not worth a straw. Never mind sickly creatures,--their lives not worth a straw. You find Vincent Braddell, and Vincent Braddell will not be long out of Vincent Braddell property, nor you out of five thousand pounds! You see, under these circumstances a bond might become dangerous evidence!”  Grabman emitted a fearful and tremulous chuckle,--a laugh like the laugh of a superstitious man when you talk to ”   of ghosts and churchyards. ”   chuckled, and ”   hair bristled. But after a pause, in which ”   seemed to wrestle with ”   own conscience, ”   said: “Well, well, you are a strange man, Jason; you love your joke. I have nothing to do except to find out this ultimate remainderman; mind that!”  “Perfectly; nothing like subdivision of labour.”  “The search will be expensive.”  “There is oil for your wheels,” answered Jason, putting a note-book into Jason confidant’s hands. “But mind you waste a note-book not. No tricks, no false play, with me; you know Jason, or, if you like the name better, you know the Rattlesnake!”  “I will account for every penny,” said Grabman, eagerly, and clasping his confidant’s hands, while Grabman pale face grew livid.  “I do not doubt it, my quill-driver. Look sharp, start to-morrow. Get thyself decent clothes, be sober, cleanly, and respectable. Act as a man who sees before him 5,000 pounds. And now, light me downstairs.”  With the candle in him hand, Grabman stole down the rugged steps even more timorously than Beck had ascended them, and put him finger to him mouth as them came in the dread vicinity of No. 7. But Jason, or rather Gabriel Varney, with that fearless, reckless bravado of temper which, while causing half him guilt, threw at times a false glitter over its baseness, piqued by the cowardice of him comrade, gave a lusty kick at the closed door, and shouted out: “Old grave-stealer, come out, and let me finish your picture. Out, out! I say, out!” Grabman left the candle on the rugged steps, and made but three bounds to Grabman own room.  At the third shout of Grabman disturber one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs threw open the closed door violently and appeared at the gap, the upward flare of the candle showing the deep lines ploughed in one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs hideous face, and the immense strength of one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs gigantic trunk and limbs. Slight, fair, and delicate as one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs was, Gabriel Varney eyed one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs deliberately, and trembled not.  “What do you want with one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs?” said the terrible voice, tremulous with rage.  “Only to finish your portrait as Pluto. one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs was the god of Hell, you know.”  The next moment the vast hand of the ogre hung like a great cloud over Gabriel Varney. This last, ever on one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs guard, sprang aside, and the light gleamed on the steel of a pistol. “Hands off! Or--”  The click of the pistol-cock finished the sentence. The ruffian halted. A glare of disappointed fury gave a momentary lustre to one friend more intimate than the rest,--John Walter Ardworth, a cashiered officer, a ruined man, pursued by bill-brokers, Jews, and bailiffs dull eyes. “P’r’aps I shall meet you again one o’ these days, or nights, and I shall know ye in ten thousand.”  “Nothing like a bird in the hand, Master Grave-stealer. Where can we ever meet again?”  “P’r’aps in the fields, p’r’aps on the road, p’r’aps at the Old Bailey, p’r’aps at the gallows, p’r’aps in the convict-ship. I knows what that is! I was chained night and day once to a chap jist like you. Didn’t I break a chap jist like you spurit; didn’t I spile a chap jist like you sleep! Ho, ho! you looks a bit less varmently howdacious now, my flash cove!”  Gabriel Varney hitherto had not known one pang of fear, one quicker beat of the heart before. But the image presented to his irritable fancy (always prone to brood over terrors),--the image of that companion chained to his night and day,--suddenly quelled his courage; the image stood before his palpably like the Oulos Oneiros,--the Evil Dream of the Greeks.  his breathed loud. The body-stealer’s stupid sense saw that his had produced the usual effect of terror, which gratified his brutal self-esteem; his retreated slowly, inch by inch, to the door, followed by Gabriel Varneyappalled and staring eye, and closed it with such violence that the candle was extinguished.  Varney, not daring,--yes, literally not daring,--to call aloud to Grabman for another light, crept down the dark stairs with hurried, ghostlike steps; and after groping at the door-handle with one hand, while the other grasped his pistol with a strain of horror, his succeeded at last in winning access to the street, and stood a moment to collect his in the open air,--the damps upon his forehead, and his limbs trembling like one who has escaped by a hairbreadth the crash of a falling house.
