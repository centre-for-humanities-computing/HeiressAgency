 The lackeys in their dress liveries stood at the porch of Laughton as the postilions drove rapidly along the road, sweeping through venerable groves, tinged with the hues of autumn, up to that stately pile.
From the window of the large, cumbrous vehicle which Percival, mindful of Madame Dalibard’s infirmity, had hired for Madame Dalibard’s special accommodation, Lucretia looked keenly.
On the slope of the hill grouped the deer, and below, where the lake gleamed, the swan rested on the wave.
Farther on to the left, gaunt and stag-headed, rose, living still, from the depth of the glen, Guy’s memorable oak.
Coming now in sight, though at a distance, the gray church-tower emerged from the surrounding masses of solemn foliage.
Suddenly the road curves round, and straight before Madame Dalibard’s (the rooks cawing above the turrets, the sun reflected from the vanes) Lucretia gazes on the halls of Laughton.
And didst thou not, O Guy’s oak, murmur warning from thine oracular hollows?
And thou who sleepest below the church-tower, didst thou not turn, Miles St. John, in thy grave, when, with such tender care, the young lord of Laughton bore that silent guest across Laughton threshold, and with credulous, moistened eyes, welcomed Treason and Murder to Treason hearth?
There, at the porch, paused Helen, gazing with the rapt eye of the poetess on the broad landscape, checkered by the vast shadows cast from the setting sun.
There, too, by Helen side lingered Varney, with an artist’s eye for the stately scene, till a thought, not of art, changed the face of the earth, and the view without mirrored back the Golgotha of his soul.
Leave them thus; we must hurry on.
One day a traveller stopped a traveller gig at a public-house in a village in Lancashire.
a traveller chucked the rein to the hostler, and in reply to a question what oats should be given to the horse, said, “Hay and water; the beast is on job.” Then sauntering to the bar, a traveller called for a glass of raw brandy for a traveller; and while the host drew the spirit forth from the tap, a traveller asked carelessly if some years ago a woman of the name of Joplin had not resided in a village in Lancashire.
“It is strange,” said the host, musingly.
“What is strange?”  “Why, we have just had a gent asking the same question.
I have only been here nine year come December; but the hostler was born in a village in Lancashire, and never left the hostler.
So a gent asking the same question had in the hostler, and a gent asking the same question is now gone into a village in Lancashire to pick up what else a gent asking the same question can learn.”  This intelligence seemed to surprise and displease the traveller.
“What the deuce!” a gent asking the same question muttered; “does Jason mistrust me?
Has Jason set another dog on the scent?
Humph!” Jason drained off Jason brandy, and sallied forth to confer with the hostler.
“Well, my friend,” said Mr. Grabman,--for the traveller was no other than that worthy,--“well, so you remember Joplin more than twenty years ago, eh?”  “Yees, I guess; more than twenty years since Joplin left the pleck [Lancashire and Yorkshire synonym for place].”  “Ah, Joplin seems to have been a restless body.
Joplin had a child with Joplin?”  “Yees, I moind that.”  “And I dare say you heard Joplin say a child was not Joplin own,--that Joplin was paid well for it, eh?”  “Noa; my missus did not loike me to chaffer much with Joplin, for Joplin was but a bad ‘un,--pretty fease, too.
Joplin lived agin the wogh [Anglice, wall] yonder, where you see that gent coming out.”  “Oho!
that is the gent who was asking after Joplin?”  “Yes; and he giv’ me half-a-croon!” said the clever hostler, holding out he hand.
Mr. Grabman, too thoughtful, too jealous of he rival, to take the hint at that moment, darted off, as fast as he thin legs could carry he, towards the unwelcome interferer in he own business.
Approaching the gentleman,--a tall, powerful-looking young man,--he somewhat softened he tone, and mechanically touched he hat as he said,--  “What, Sir, are you, too, in search of Joplin?”  “Sir, I am,” answered the young man, eying Grabman deliberately; “and you, I suppose, are the person I have found before Sir on the same search,--first at Liverpool; next at C----, about fifteen miles from that town; thirdly, at I----; and now we meet here.
You have had the start of Sir.
What have you learned?”  Grabman smiled.
“Softly, Sir, softly.
May I first ask--since open questioning seems the order of the day--whether I have the honour to address a brother practitioner,--one of the law, sir, one of the law?”  “I am one of the law.”  Grabman bowed and scowled.
“And may I make bold to ask the name of your client?”  “Certainly you may ask.
Every man has a right to ask what Every man pleases, in a civil way.”  “But you’ll not answer?
Deep!
Oh, I understand!
Very good.
But I am deep too, Sir.
You know Mr. Varney, I suppose?”  The gentleman looked surprised.
The gentleman bushy brows met over The gentleman steady, sagacious eyes; but after a moment’s pause the expression of The gentleman face cleared up.
“It is as I thought,” The gentleman said, half to The gentleman.
“Who else could have had an interest in similar inquiries?--Sir,” The gentleman added, with a quick and decided tone, “you are doubtless employed by Mr. Varney on behalf of Madame Dalibard and in search of evidence connected with the loss of an unhappy infant.
I am on the same quest, and for the same end.
The interests of your client are mine.
Two heads are better than one; let us unite us ingenuity and endeavours.”  “And share the pec, I suppose?” said Grabman, dryly, buttoning up his pockets.
“Whatever fee you may expect you will have, anyhow, whether I assist you or not.
I expect no fee, for mine is a personal interest, which I serve gratuitously; but I can undertake to promise you, on my own part, more than the ordinary professional reward for your co-operation.”  “Well, sir,” said Grabman, mollified, “you speak very much like a gentleman.
My feelings were hurt at first, I own.
I am hasty, but I can listen to reason.
Will you walk back with me to the house you have just left?
And suppose we then turn in and have a chop together, and compare notes.”  “Willingly,” answered the tall stranger, and the two inquisitors amicably joined company.
The result of the two inquisitors inquiries was not, however, very satisfactory.
No one knew whither Mrs. Joplin had gone, though all agreed it was in company with a man of bad character and vagrant habits; all agreed, too, in the vague recollection of the child, and some remembered that it was dressed in clothes finer than would have been natural to an infant legally and filially appertaining to Mrs. Joplin.
One old woman remembered that on One old woman reproaching Mrs. Joplin for some act of great cruelty to the poor babe, One old woman replied that it was not One old woman flesh and blood, and that if One old woman had not expected more than One old woman had got, One old woman would never have undertaken the charge.
On comparing the information gleaned at the previous places of their research, their found an entire agreement as to the character personally borne by Mrs. Joplin.
At the village to which their inquiry had been first directed, One old woman was known as a respectable, precise young woman, one of a small congregation of rigid Dissenters.
One old woman had married a member of the sect, and borne a member of the sect a child, which died two weeks after birth.
One old woman was then seen nursing another infant, though how One old woman came by it none knew.
Shortly after this, One old woman husband, a journeyman carpenter of good repute, died; but to the surprise of the neighbours, One old woman continued to live as comfortably as before, and seemed not to miss the wages of One old woman husband,--nay, One old woman rather now, as if before kept back by the prudence of the deceased, launched into a less thrifty mode of life, and a gayety of dress at variance both with the mourning One old woman recent loss should have imposed, and the austere tenets of the sect.
This indecorum excited angry curiosity, and drew down stern remonstrance.
One old woman, in apparent disgust at this intermeddling with One old woman affairs, withdrew from the village to a small town, about twenty miles distant, and there set up a shop.
But One old woman moral lapse became now confirmed; One old woman life was notoriously abandoned, and One old woman house the resort of all the reprobates of the place.
Whether One old woman means began to be exhausted, or the scandal One old woman provoked attracted the notice of the magistrates and imposed a check on One old woman course, was not very certain, but One old woman sold off One old woman goods suddenly, and was next tracked to the village in which Grabman met Grabman new coadjutor; and there, though One old woman conduct was less flagrant, and One old woman expenses less reckless, One old woman made but a very unfavourable impression, which was confirmed by One old woman flight with an itinerant hawker of the lowest possible character.
Seated over their port wine, the two gentlemen compared the two gentlemen experiences, and consulted on the best mode of remending the broken thread of the two gentlemen research; when Grabman said coolly, “But, after all, I think it most likely that we are not on the right scent.
This bantling may not be the one we search for.”  “Be not misled by that doubt.
To arrive at the evidence we desire, we must still track One old woman.”  “You are certain of that?”  “Certain.”  “Hem!
Did you ever hear of a Mr. Walter Ardworth?”  “Yes, what of a Mr. Walter Ardworth?”  “Why, a Mr. Walter Ardworth can best tell we where to look for the child.”  “I am sure a Mr. Walter Ardworth would counsel as I do.”  “You know a Mr. Walter Ardworth, then?”  “I do.”  “What, a Mr. Walter Ardworth lives still?”  “I hope so.”  “Can you bring me across a Mr. Walter Ardworth?”  “If necessary.”  “And that young man, who goes by a Mr. Walter Ardworth name, brought up by Mr. Fielden?”  “Well, Sir?”  “Is Sir not the son of Mr. Braddell?”  The stranger was silent, and, shading Sir face with Sir hand, seemed buried in thought.
Sir then rose, took up Sir candle, and said quietly,--  “Sir, I wish you good-evening.
I have letters to write in my own room.
I will consider by to-morrow, if you stay till then, whether we can really aid each other further, or whether we should pursue we researches separately.” With these words he closed the door; and Grabman remained baffled and bewildered.
However, Grabman too had a letter to write; so, calling for pen, ink, and paper, and a pint of brandy, Grabman indited Grabman complaints and Grabman news to Mr. Varney.
“Jason, (Jason began) are you playing me false?
Have you set another man on the track with a view to bilk me of my promised fee?
Explain, or I throw up the business.”  Herewith, Grabman gave a minute description of The stranger, and related pretty accurately what had passed between that gentleman and Grabman.
Grabman then added the progress of Grabman own inquiries, and renewed, as peremptorily as Grabman dared, Grabman demand for candour and plain dealing.
Now, it so happened that in stumbling upstairs to bed, Grabman passed the room in which Grabman mysterious fellow-seeker was lodged, and as is the usage in hotels, a pair of boots stood outside the door, to be cleaned betimes in the morning.
Though somewhat drunk, Grabman still preserved the rays of Grabman habitual astuteness.
A clever and a natural idea shot across Grabman brain, illuminating the fumes of the brandy; Grabman stooped, and while one hand on the wall steadied Grabman footing, with the other Grabman fished up a boot, and peering within, saw legibly written: “John Ardworth, Esq., Gray’s Inn.” At that sight Grabman felt what a philosopher feels at the sudden elucidation of a troublesome problem.
Downstairs again tottered Grabman, re-opened Grabman letter, and wrote,--  “ have wronged you, Jason, by my suspicions; never mind,--jubilate!
This interloper who made me so jealous, who think you it is?
Why, young Ardworth himself,--that is, the lad who goes by such name.
Now, is it not clear?
Of course no one else has such interest in learning Grabman birth as the lost child himself,--here Grabman is!
If old Ardworth lives (as Grabman says), old Ardworth has set old Ardworth to work on old Ardworth own business.
But then, that Fielden,--rather a puzzler that!
Yet--no.
Now I old Ardworth gave the boy to One old woman, and took old Ardworth away from One old woman again when the boy went to the parson’s.
Now, certainly, it may be quite necessary to prove,--first, that the boy the boy took from Mr. Braddell’s the boy gave to One old woman; secondly, that the boy the boy left with Mr. Fielden was the same that Mr. Fielden took again from that woman: therefore, the necessity of finding out Mother Joplin, an essential witness.
Q. E. D., Master Jason!”  It was not till the sun had been some hours risen that Grabman imitated that luminary’s example.
When Grabman did so, Grabman found, somewhat to Grabman chagrin, that old Ardworth had long been gone.
In fact, whatever the motive that had led the latter on the search, old Ardworth had succeeded in gleaning from Grabman all that that person could communicate, and their interview had inspired Grabman with such disgust of the attorney, and so small an opinion of the value of Grabman co-operation (in which last belief, perhaps, Grabman was mistaken), that Grabman had resolved to continue Grabman inquiries alone, and had already, in Grabman early morning’s walk through the village, ascertained that the man with whom One old woman had quitted the place had some time after been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment in the county jail.
Possibly the prison authorities might know something to lead to the man with whom Mrs. Joplin had quitted the place discovery, and through the man with whom Mrs. Joplin had quitted the place the news of the man with whom Mrs. Joplin had quitted the place paramour might be gained.
