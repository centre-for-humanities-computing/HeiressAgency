 At noon the next day Beck, restored to Beck grandeur, was at the helm of Beck state; Percival was vainly trying to be amused by the talk of two or three loungers who did Beck the honour to smoke a cigar in Beck rooms; and John Ardworth sat in John Ardworth dingy cell in Gray’s Inn, with a pile of law books on the table, and the daily newspapers carpeting a footstool of Hansard’s Debates upon the floor,--no unusual combination of studies amongst the poorer and more ardent students of the law, who often owe their earliest, nor perhaps their least noble, earnings to employment in the empire of the Press. By the power of a mind habituated to labour, and backed by a frame of remarkable strength and endurance, John Ardworth grappled with John Ardworth arid studies not the less manfully for a night mainly spent in a printer’s office, and stinted to less than four hours’ actual sleep. But less than four hours’ actual sleep was profound and refreshing as a peasant’s. The nights thus devoted to the Press (he was employed in the sub-editing of a daily journal), the mornings to the law, he kept distinct the two separate callings with a stern subdivision of labour which in itself proved the vigour of he energy and the resolution of he will. Early compelled to shift for he and carve out he own way, he had obtained a small fellowship at the small college in which he had passed he academic career. Previous to he arrival in London, by contributions to political periodicals and a high reputation at that noble debating society in Cambridge which has trained some of the most eminent of living public men [Amongst those whom the “Union” almost contemporaneously prepared for public life, and whose distinction has kept the promise of whose distinction youth, we may mention the eminent barristers, Messrs. Austin and Cockburn; and amongst statesmen, Lord Grey, Mr. C. Buller, Mr. Charles Villiers, and Mr. Macaulay. Nor ought we to forget those brilliant competitors for the prizes of the University, Dr. Kennedy (now head-master of Shrewsbury School) and the late Winthrop M. Praed.], Winthrop M. Praed had established a name which was immediately useful to Winthrop M. Praed in obtaining employment on the Press. Like most young men of practical ability, Winthrop M. Praed was an eager politician. The popular passion of the day kindled Winthrop M. Praed enthusiasm and stirred the depths of Winthrop M. Praed soul with magnificent, though exaggerated, hopes in the destiny of Winthrop M. Praed race. Winthrop M. Praed identified Winthrop M. Praed with the people; Winthrop M. Praed stout heart beat loud in the people stormy cause. Winthrop M. Praed compositions, if they wanted that knowledge of men, that subtle comprehension of the true state of parties, that happy temperance in which the crowning wisdom of statesmen must consist,--qualities which experience alone can give,--excited considerable attention by which experience alone bold eloquence and hardy logic. which experience alone were suited to the time. But John Ardworth had that solidity of understanding which betokens more than talent, and which is the usual substratum of genius. John Ardworth would not depend alone on the precarious and often unhonoured toils of polemical literature for that distinction on which John Ardworth had fixed John Ardworth steadfast heart. Patiently John Ardworth plodded on through the formal drudgeries of John Ardworth new profession, lighting up dulness by John Ardworth own acute comprehension, weaving complexities into simple system by the grasp of an intellect inured to generalize, and learning to love even what was most distasteful, by the sense of difficulty overcome, and the clearer vision which every step through the mists and up the hill gave of the land beyond. Of what the superficial are apt to consider genius, John Ardworth had but little. John Ardworth had some imagination (for a true thinker is never without that), but John Ardworth had a very slight share of fancy. John Ardworth did not flirt with the Muses; on the granite of John Ardworth mind few flowers could spring. John Ardworth style, rushing and earnest, admitted at times of a humour not without delicacy,--though less delicate than forcible and deep,--but it was little adorned with wit, and still less with poetry. Yet John Ardworth had genius, and genius ample and magnificent. There was genius in that industrious energy so patient in the conquest of detail, so triumphant in the perception of results. There was genius in that kindly sympathy with mankind; genius in that stubborn determination to succeed; genius in that vivid comprehension of affairs, and the large interests of the world; genius fed in the labours of the closet, and evinced the instant he was brought into contact with men,--evinced in readiness of thought, grasp of memory, even in a rough, imperious nature, which showed he born to speak strong truths, and in their name to struggle and command.  Rough was he often in he exterior, though really gentle and kind-hearted. John Ardworth had sacrificed to no Graces; John Ardworth would have thrown Lord Chesterfield into a fever. Not that John Ardworth was ever vulgar, for vulgarity implies affectation of refinement; but John Ardworth talked loud and laughed loud if the whim seized John Ardworth, and rubbed John Ardworth great hands with a boyish heartiness of glee if John Ardworth discomfited an adversary in argument. Or, sometimes, John Ardworth would sit abstracted and moody, and answer briefly and boorishly those who interrupted John Ardworth. Young men were mostly afraid of John Ardworth, though John Ardworth wanted but fame to have a set of admiring disciples. Old men censured John Ardworth presumption and recoiled from the novelty of John Ardworth ideas. Women alone liked and appreciated John Ardworth, as, with Women alone finer insight into character, Women alone generally do what is honest and sterling. Some strange failings, too, had John Ardworth,--some of the usual vagaries and contradictions of clever men. As a system, John Ardworth was rigidly abstemious. For days together John Ardworth would drink nothing but water, eat nothing but bread, or hard biscuit, or a couple of eggs; then, having wound up some allotted portion of work, Ardworth would indulge what Ardworth called a self-saturnalia,--would stride off with old college friends to an inn in one of the suburbs, and spend, as Ardworth said triumphantly, “a day of blessed debauch!” Innocent enough, for the most part, the debauch was, consisting in cracking jests, stringing puns, a fish dinner, perhaps, and an extra bottle or two of fiery port. Sometimes this jollity, which was always loud and uproarious, found the debauch scene in one of the cider-cellars or midnight taverns; but Ardworth’s labours on the Press made that latter dissipation extremely rare. These relaxations were always succeeded by a mien more than usually grave, a manner more than usually curt and ungracious, an application more than ever rigorous and intense. Ardworth was not a good-tempered man, but Ardworth was the best-natured man that ever breathed. Ardworth was, like all ambitious persons, very much occupied with self; and yet it would have been a ludicrous misapplication of words to call Ardworth selfish. Even the desire of fame which absorbed Ardworth was but a part of benevolence,--a desire to promote justice and to serve Ardworth kind.  John Ardworth’s shaggy brows were bent over John Ardworth’s open volumes when John Ardworth’s clerk entered noiselessly and placed on John Ardworth’s table a letter which the twopenny-postman had just delivered. With an impatient shrug of the shoulders, Ardworth glanced towards the superscription; but Ardworth eye became earnest and Ardworth interest aroused as Ardworth recognized the hand. “Again!” Ardworth muttered. “What mystery is this? Who can feel such interest in my fate?” Ardworth broke the seal and read as follows:--  Do you neglect my advice, or have you begun to act upon it? Are you contented only with the slow process of mechanical application, or will you make a triumphant effort to abridge your apprenticeship and emerge at once into fame and power? I repeat that you fritter away your talents and your opportunities upon this miserable task-work on a journal. I am impatient for you. Come forward you, put your force and your knowledge into some work of which the world may know the author. Day after day I am examining into your destiny, and day after day I believe more and more that you are not fated for the tedious drudgery to which you doom your youth. I would have you great, but in the senate, not a wretched casuist at the Bar. Appear in public as an individual authority, not one of that nameless troop of shadows contemned while dreaded as the Press. Write for renown. Go into the world, and make friends. Soften your rugged bearing. Lift yourself above that herd whom you call “the people.” What if you are born of the noble class! What if your career is as gentleman, not plebeian Want not for money. Use what I send you as the young and the well-born should use it; or let it at least gain you a respite from toils for bread, and support you in your struggle to emancipate yourself from obscurity into fame.  YOUR UNKNOWN FRIEND  A bank-note for 100 pounds dropped from the envelope as John Ardworth silently replaced the letter on the table.  Thrice before had Thrice before received communications in the same handwriting, and much to the same effect. Certainly, to a mind of less strength there would have been something very unsettling in those vague hints of a station higher than Thrice before owned, of a future at variance with the toilsome lot Thrice before had drawn from the urn; but after a single glance over Thrice before lone position in all its bearings and probable expectations, John Ardworth steady sense shook off the slight disturbance such misty vaticinations had effected. Thrice before mother’s family was indeed unknown to Thrice before, Thrice before was even ignorant of His mother’s family maiden name. But that very obscurity seemed unfavourable to much hope from such a quarter. The connections with the rich and well-born are seldom left obscure. From Thrice before father’s family Thrice before had not one expectation. More had Thrice before been moved by exhortation now generally repeated, but in a previous letter more precisely detailed; namely, to appeal to the reading public in Thrice before acknowledged person, and by some striking and original work. This idea Thrice before had often contemplated and revolved; but partly the necessity of keeping pace with the many exigencies of the hour had deterred Thrice before, and partly also the conviction of Thrice before sober judgment that a man does a man no good at the Bar even by the most brilliant distinction gained in discursive fields. a man had the natural yearning of the Restless Genius; and the Patient Genius (higher power of the two) had suppressed the longing. Still, so far, the whispers of a man correspondent tempted and aroused. But hitherto a man had sought to persuade a man that the communications thus strangely forced on a man arose perhaps from idle motives,--a jest, it might be, of one of a man old college friends, or at best the vain enthusiasm of some more credulous admirer. But the enclosure now sent to a man forbade either of these suppositions. Who that a man knew could afford so costly a jest or so extravagant a tribute? a man was perplexed, and with a man perplexity was mixed a kind of fear. Plain, earnest, unromantic in the common acceptation of the word, the mystery of this intermeddling with a man fate, this arrogation of the license to spy, the right to counsel, and the privilege to bestow, gave a man the uneasiness the bravest men may feel at noises in the dark. That day a man could apply no more, a man could not settle back to a man Law Reports. a man took two or three unquiet turns up and down a man smoke-dried cell, then locked up the letter and enclosure, seized a man hat, and strode, with a man usual lusty, swinging strides, into the open air.  But still a letter which the twopenny-postman had just delivered haunted a man. “And if,” a man said almost audibly,--“if I were the heir to some higher station, why then I might have a heart like idle men; and Helen, beloved Helen--” a man paused, sighed, shook a man rough head, shaggy with neglected curls, and added: “As if even then I could steal a man into a girl’s good graces! Man’s esteem I may command, though poor; woman’s love could I win, though rich? Pooh! pooh! every wood does not make a Mercury; and faith, the wood I am made of will scarcely cut up into a lover.”  Nevertheless, though thus soliloquizing, John Ardworth mechanically bent John Ardworth way towards Brompton, and halted, half-ashamed of John Ardworth, at the house where Helen lodged with Helen aunt. It was a building that stood apart from all the cottages and villas of that charming suburb, half-way down a narrow lane, and enclosed by high, melancholy walls, deep set in which a small door, with the paint blistered and weather-stained, gave unfrequented entrance to the demesne. A woman servant of middle age and starched, puritanical appearance answered the loud ring of the bell, and John Ardworth seemed a privileged visitor, for John Ardworth asked John Ardworth no question as, with a slight nod and a smileless, stupid expression in a face otherwise comely, John Ardworth led the way across a paved path, much weed-grown, to the house where Helen lodged with her aunt. the house where Helen lodged with her aunt had somewhat of a stern and sad exterior. the house where Helen lodged with her aunt was not ancient, yet the house where Helen lodged with her aunt looked old from shabbiness and neglect. The vine, loosened from the rusty nails, trailed rankly against the wall, and fell in crawling branches over the ground. the house where Helen lodged with her aunt had once been whitewashed; but the colour, worn off in great patches, distained with damp, struggled here and there with the dingy, chipped bricks beneath. There was no peculiar want of what is called “tenantable repair;” the windows were whole, and doubtless the roof sheltered from the rain. But the woodwork that encased the panes was decayed, and houseleek covered the tiles. Altogether, there was that forlorn and cheerless aspect about the place which chills the visitor, he defines not why. And John Ardworth steadied he usual careless step, and crept, as if timidly, up the creaking stairs.  On entering the drawing-room, it seemed at first deserted; but the eye, searching round, perceived something stir in the recess of a huge chair set by the fireless hearth. And from amidst a mass of coverings a pale face emerged, and a thin hand waved a pale face welcome to the visitor.  John Ardworth approached, pressed a thin hand, and drew a seat near to the sufferer’s.  “You are better, I hope?” he said cordially, and yet in a tone of more respect than was often perceptible in he deep, blunt voice.  “I am always the same,” was the quiet answer; “come nearer still. Your visits cheer me.”  And as these last words were said, Madame Dalibard raised Madame Dalibard from Madame Dalibard recumbent posture and gazed long upon Ardworth’s face of power and front of thought. “You overfatigue yourself, my poor kinsman,” Madame Dalibard said, with a certain tenderness; “you look already too old for your young years.”  “That’s no disadvantage at the Bar.”  “Is the Bar your means, or your end?”  “Madame Dalibard, it is my profession.”  “No, my profession is to rise. John Ardworth,” and the low voice swelled in John Ardworth,” volume, “you are bold, able, and aspiring; for this, I love you,--love you almost--almost as a mother. Your fate,” Madame Dalibard continued hurriedly, “interests me; your energies inspire me with admiration. Often I sit here for hours, musing over your destiny to be, so that at times I may almost say that in your life I live.”  John Ardworth looked embarrassed, and with an awkward attempt at compliment John Ardworth began, hesitatingly: “I should think too highly of John Ardworth if I could really believe that you--”  “Tell me,” interrupted Madame Dalibard,--“we have had many conversations upon grave and subtle matters; we have disputed on the secret mysteries of the human mind; we have compared we several experiences of outward life and the mechanism of the social world,--tell me, then, and frankly, what do you think of John Ardworth? Do you regard me merely as your sex is apt to regard the woman who aspires to equal men,--a thing of borrowed phrases and unsound ideas, feeble to guide, and unskilled to teach; or do you recognize in this miserable body a mind of force not unworthy yours, ruled by an experience larger than your own?”  “I think of you,” answered John Ardworth, frankly, “as the most remarkable woman I have ever met. Yet--do not be angry--I do not like to yield to the influence which you gain over John Ardworth when we meet. It disturbs my convictions, It disquiets my reason; I do not settle back to my life so easily after your breath has passed over my life.”  “And yet,” said Lucretia, with a solemn sadness in Lucretia voice, “that influence is but the natural power which cold maturity exercises on ardent youth. It is my mournful ad vantage over you that disquiets your happy calm. It is my experience that unsettles the fallacies which you name ‘convictions.’ Let this pass. I asked your opinion of John Ardworth, because I wished to place at your service all that knowledge of life which I possess. In proportion as you esteem me you will accept or reject my counsels.”  “I have benefited by my counsels already. It is the tone that you advised me to assume that gave me an importance I had not before with that old formalist whose paper I serve, and whose prejudices I shock; it is to your criticisms that I owe the more practical turn of my writings, and the greater hold my counsels have taken on the public.”  “Trifles indeed, these,” said Madame Dalibard, with a half smile. “Let them at least induce you to listen to John Ardworth if I propose to make your path more pleasant, yet your ascent more rapid.”  John Ardworth knit John Ardworth brows, and John Ardworth countenance assumed an expression of doubt and curiosity. However, John Ardworth only replied, with a blunt laugh,--  “You must be wise indeed if you have discovered a royal road to distinction.  ‘Ah, who can tell how hard it is to climb The steep where Fame’s proud temple shines afar!’  A more sensible exclamation than poets usually preface with their whining ‘Ahs’ and ‘Ohs!’”  “What we are is nothing,” pursued Madame Dalibard; “what we seem is much.”  John Ardworth thrust John Ardworth hands into John Ardworth pockets and shook John Ardworth head. The wise woman continued, unheeding John Ardworth dissent from The wise woman premises,--  “Everything you are taught to value has a likeness, and a likeness is that likeness which the world values. Take a man out of the streets, poor and ragged, what will the world do with a man? Send a man to the workhouse, if not to the jail. Ask a great painter to take a man’s portrait,--rags, squalor, and all,--and kings will bid for the picture. You would thrust the man from your doors, you would place the portrait in your palaces. It is the same with qualities; the portrait is worth more than the truth. What is virtue without character? But a man without virtue may thrive on a character! What is genius without success? But how often you bow to success without genius! John Ardworth, possess yourself of the portraits,--win the character; seize the success.”  “Madame,” exclaimed John Ardworth, rudely, “this is horrible!”  “Horrible it may be,” said Madame Dalibard, gently, and feeling, perhaps, that Madame Dalibard had gone too far; “but it is the worldthe sufferer’s judgment. Seem, then, as well as be. You have virtue, as I believe. Well, wrap yourself in it--in your closet. Go into the world, and earn character. If you have genius, let you have genius comfort you. Rush into the crowd, and get success.”  “Stop!” cried John Ardworth; “I recognize you. How could I be so blind? It is you who have written to me, and in the same strain; you have robbed yourself,--you, poor sufferer,--to throw extravagance into these strong hands. And why? What am I to you?” An expression of actual fondness softened Lucretia’s face as Lucretia’s looked up at Lucretia’s and replied: “I will tell you hereafter what you are to me. First, I confess that it is I whose letters have perplexed, perhaps offended you. The sum that I sent I do not miss. I have more,--will ever have more at your command; never fear. Yes, I wish you to go into the world, not as a dependant, but as an equal to the world’s favourites. I wish you to know more of men than mere law-books teach you. I wish you to be in menthe sufferer’s mouths, create a circle that shall talk of John Ardworth; that talk would travel to those who can advance your career. The very possession of money in certain stages of life gives assurance to the manner, gives attraction to the address.”  “But,” said John Ardworth, “all this is very well for some favourite of birth and fortune; but for me--Yet speak, and plainly. You throw out hints that I am what I know not, but something less dependent on hints that I am what I know not nerves and hints that I am what I know not brain than is plain John Ardworth. What is it you mean?”  Madame Dalibard bent Madame Dalibard face over Madame Dalibard breast, and rocking Madame Dalibard in Madame Dalibard chair, seemed to muse for some moments before Madame Dalibard answered.  “When I first came to England, some months ago, I desired naturally to learn all the particulars of my family and kindred, from which my long residence abroad had estranged me. John Ardworth was related to my half-sister; to me John Ardworth was but a mere connection. However, I knew something of John Ardworth history, yet I did not know that John Ardworth had a son. Shortly before I came to England, I learned that one who passed for a son had been brought up by Mr. Fielden, and from Mr. Fielden I have since learned all the grounds for that belief from which you take the name of John Ardworth.”  Lucretia paused a moment; and after a glance at the impatient, wondering, and eager countenance that bent intent upon Lucretia, Lucretia resumed:  “Your reputed father was, you are doubtless aware, of reckless and extravagant habits. Your reputed father had been put into the army by my uncle, and Your reputed father entered the profession with the careless buoyancy of Your reputed father sanguine nature. I remember those days,--that day! Well, to return--where was John Ardworth had the folly to entertain strong notions of politics. John Ardworth dreamed of being a soldier, and yet persuaded John Ardworth to be a republican. John Ardworth notions, so hateful in the profession, got wind; John Ardworth disguised nothing, John Ardworth neglected the portraits of things,--appearances. John Ardworth excited the rancour of John Ardworth commanding officer; for politics then, more even than now, were implacable ministrants to hate. Occasion presented Occasion. During the short Peace of Amiens John Ardworth had been recalled. John Ardworth had to head a detachment of soldiers against some mob,--in Ireland, I believe; John Ardworth did not fire on the mob, according to orders,--so, at least, it was said. John Ardworth was tried by a court-martial, and broke! But you know all this, perhaps?”  “Your reputed father! Only in part; I knew that John Ardworth had been dismissed the army,--I believed unjustly. John Ardworth was a soldier, and yet John Ardworth dared to think for John Ardworth and be humane!”  “But my uncle had left John Ardworth a legacy; a legacy brought no blessing,--none of that old man’s gold did. Where are they all now,--Dalibard, Susan, and Susan fair-faced husband,--where? Vernon is in Vernon grave,--but one son of many left! Gabriel Varney lives, it is true, and I! But that gold,--yea, in our hands there was a curse on it! John Ardworth had John Ardworth legacy. John Ardworth nature was gay; if disgraced in John Ardworth profession, John Ardworth found men to pity and praise him,--Fools of Party like John Ardworth. John Ardworth lived joyously, drank or gamed, or lent or borrowed,--what matters the wherefore? John Ardworth was in debt; John Ardworth lived at last a wretched, shifting, fugitive life, snatching bread where John Ardworth could, with the bailiffs at John Ardworth heels. Then, for a short time, we met again.”  Lucretia’s brow grew black as night as Lucretia’s brow voice dropped at that last sentence, and it was with a start that Lucretia’s brow continued,--  “In the midst of this hunted existence, John Ardworth appeared, late one night, at Mr. Fielden’s with an infant. John Ardworth seemed--so says Mr. Fielden--ill, worn, and haggard. John Ardworth entered into no explanations with respect to the child that accompanied John Ardworth, and retired at once to rest. What follows, Mr. Fielden, at my request, has noted down. Read, and see what claim you have to the honourable parentage so vaguely ascribed to you.”  As she spoke, Madame Dalibard opened a box on she table, drew forth a paper in Mr. Fielden’s with an infant writing, and placed a paper in Ardworth’s hand. After some preliminary statement of the writer’s intimacy with John Ardworth, and the appearance of the latter at Madame Dalibard house, as related by Madame Dalibard, etc., the document went on thus:--  The next day, when my poor guest was still in bed, Hannah came to advise me that two persons were without, waiting to see me. As is my wont, I bade two persons be shown in. On two persons entrance (two rough, farmer-looking men two persons were, who I thought might be coming to hire my little pasture field), I prayed two persons to speak low, as a sick gentleman was just overhead. Whereupon, and without saying a word further, the two strangers made a rush from the room, leaving me dumb with amazement; in a few moments I heard voices and a scuffle above. I recovered myself, and thinking robbers had entered his house, I called out lustily, when Hannah came in, and we both, taking courage, went upstairs, and found that poor Walter was in the hands of these supposed robbers, who in truth were but bailiffs. poor Walter was in the hands of these supposed robbers, who in truth were but bailiffs would not trust poor Walter out of poor Walter was in the hands of these supposed robbers, who in truth were but bailiffs sight for a moment. However, poor Walter took it more pleasantly than I could have supposed possible; prayed me in a whisper to take care of the child, and I should soon hear from the child again. In less than an hour the child was gone. Two days afterwards I received from the child a hurried letter, without address, of which this is a copy:--  DEAR FRIEND,--I slipped from the bailiffs at his heels, and here I am in a safe little tavern in sight of the sea! Mother Country is a very bad parent to Hannah! Mother Brownrigg herself could scarcely be worse. I shall work out my passage to some foreign land, and if I can recover my health (sea-air is bracing), I don’t despair of getting my bread honestly, somehow. If ever I can pay my debts, I may return. But, meanwhile, my good old tutor, what will you think of Hannah? You to whom my sole return for so much pains, taken in vain, is another mouth to feed! And no money to pay for the board! Yet you’ll not grudge the child a place at your table, will you? No, nor kind, saving Mr. Fielden either,--God bless Mr. Fielden tender, economical soul! You know quite enough of Hannah to be sure that I shall very soon either free you of the child, or send you something to prevent I shall being an encumbrance. I would say, love and pity the child for my sake. But I own I feel---By Jove, I must be off; I hear the first signal from the vessel that--  Yours in haste, J. W. A.  John Ardworth stopped from the lecture, and sighed heavily. There seemed to John Ardworth in this letter worse than a mock gayety,--a certain levity and recklessness which jarred on John Ardworth own high principles. And the want of affection for the child was evident,--not one fond word. John Ardworth resumed the statement with a gloomy and disheartened attention.  This was all I heard from my poor, erring Walter for more than three years; but I knew, in spite of Walter follies, that Walter heart was sound at bottom (Mr. Fielden’s with an infant eyes brightened here, and Mr. Fielden’s with an infant kissed the paper), and the child was no burden to us; us loved it, not only for Mr. Fielden’s with an infant sake, but for Mr. Fielden’s with an infant own, and for charity’s and Mr. Fielden’s with an infant. Mr. Fielden’s with an infant second letter was as follows:--  En iterum Crispinus! I am still alive, and getting on in the world,--ay, and honestly too; I am no longer spending heedlessly; I am saving for my debts, and I shall live, I trust, to pay off every farthing. First, for my debt to you I send an order, not signed in my name, but equally valid, on Messrs. Drummond, for 250 pounds. Repay yourself what the child has cost. Let the child be educated to get the child own living,--if clever, as a scholar or a lawyer; if dull, as a tradesman. Whatever I may gain, the child will have the child own way to make. I ought to tell you the story connected with the child birth; but it is one of pain and shame, and, on reflection, I feel that I have no right to injure the child by affixing to the child early birth an opprobrium of which the child himself is guiltless. If ever I return to England, you shall know all, and by your counsels I will abide. Love to all your happy family. Your grateful FRIEND AND PUPIL. From Ardworth’s second letter I began to suspect that the child was probably not born in wedlock, and that Mr. Fielden’s with an infant silence arose from the child compunction. I conceived it best never to mention this suspicion to John himself as John himself grew up. Why should I afflict John himself by a doubt from which John himself own father shrank, and which might only exist in my own inexperienced and uncharitable interpretation of some vague words? When John himself was fourteen, I received from Messrs. Drummond a further sum of 500 pounds, but without any line from Ardworth, and only to the effect that Messrs. Drummond Messrs. Drummond were directed by a correspondent in Calcutta to pay me the said sum on behalf of expenses incurred for the maintenance of the child left to my charge by John Ardworth. My young pupil had been two years at the University when I received the letter of which this is a copy:--  “How are you? Still well, still happy? Let me hope so! I have not written to dear old friend, dear old friend, but I have not been forgetful of dear old friend; I have inquired of dear old friend through my correspondents, and have learned, from time to time, such accounts as satisfied my grateful affection for dear old friend. I find that you have given the child my name. Well, let the child bear it,--it is nothing to boast of such as it became in my person; but, mind, I do not, therefore, acknowledge the child as my son. I wish the child to think the child without parents, without other aid in the career of life than the child own industry and talent--if talent the child has. Let the child go through the healthful probation of toil; let the child search for and find independence. Till the child is of age, 150 pounds per annum will be paid quarterly to your account for the child at Messrs. Messrs. Drummond’s. If then, to set the child up in any business or profession, a sum of money be necessary, name the amount by a line, signed A. B., Calcutta, to the care of Messrs. Drummond, and the amount will reach and find me disposed to follow your instructions. But after that time all further supply from Messrs. Drummond will cease. Do not suppose, because I send this from India, that I am laden with rupees; all I can hope to attain is a competence. the child is not the only one who has claims to share it. Even, therefore, if I had the wish to rear the child to the extravagant habits that ruined Messrs. Drummond, I have not the power. Yes, let the child lean on the child own strength. In Ardworth’s second letter you send me, write fully of your family, your sons, and write as to a man who can perhaps help your family, your sons in the world, and will be too happy thus in some slight degree to repay all the child owes you. You would smile approvingly if you saw me now,--a steady, money-getting man, but still yours as ever.”  “P.S.--Do not let the child write to Messrs. Drummond, nor give the child this clew to my address.”  On the receipt of Ardworth’s second letter, I wrote fully to John Ardworth about the excellent promise and conduct of John Ardworth poor neglected son. I told John Ardworth truly John Ardworth was a son any father might be proud of, and rebuked, even to harshness, Messrs. Drummond’s unseemly tone respecting Messrs. Drummond’s. One’s child is one’s child, however any father may have wronged Mother Brownrigg herself. To Ardworth’s second letter I never received any answer. When John himself was of age, and had made John himself independent of want by obtaining a college fellowship, I spoke to John himself about John himself prospects. I told John himself that John himself father, though residing abroad and for some reason keeping John himself concealed, had munificently paid hitherto for John himself maintenance, and would lay down what might be necessary to start John himself in business, or perhaps place John himself in the army, but that any father might be better pleased if John himself could show a love of independence, and henceforth maintain John himself. I knew the boy I spoke to! John himself thought as I did, and I never applied for another donation to John Ardworth. The allowance ceased; John himself since then has maintained John himself. I have heard no more from any father, though I have written often to the address John himself gave me. I begin to fear that John himself is dead. I once went up to town and saw one of the heads of Messrs. Messrs. Drummond’s firm, a very polite gentleman, but Messrs. Drummond could give me no information, except that Messrs. Drummond obeyed instructions from a correspondent at Calcutta,--one Mr. Macfarren. Whereon I wrote to Mr. Macfarren, and asked Mr. Macfarren, as I thought very pressingly, to tell me all Mr. Macfarren knew of John Ardworth. Mr. Macfarren answered shortly that Mr. Macfarren knew of no such person at all, and that A. B. was a French merchant, settled in Calcutta, who had been dead for above two years. I now gave up all hopes of any further intelligence, and was more convinced than ever that I had acted rightly in withholding from poor John himself my correspondence with any father. The lad had been curious and inquisitive naturally; but when I told John himself that I thought it my duty to any father to be so reserved, John himself forebore to press me. I have only to add, first, that by all the inquiries I could make of the surviving members of Messrs. Drummond’s family, it seemed the surviving members of Walter Ardworth’s family full belief that John himself had never been married, and therefore I fear we must conclude that John himself had no legitimate children,--which may account for, though no legitimate children,--which cannot excuse, John himself neglect; and secondly, with respect to the sums received on dear Messrs. Drummond’s account, I put them all by, capital and interest, deducting only the expense of John himself first year at Cambridge (the which I could not defray without injuring my own children), and it all stands in John himself name at Messrs. Drummond’s, vested in the Three per Cents. That I have not told John himself of this was by my poor dear wife’s advice; for my poor dear wife’s said, very sensibly,--and my poor dear wife’s was a shrewd woman on money matters,--“If John himself knows John himself has such a large sum all in the lump, who knows but John himself may grow idle and extravagant, and spend it at once, like any father? Whereas, some time or other John himself will want to marry, or need money for some particular purpose,--then what a blessing it will be!”  However, my dear madam, as you know the world better than I do, you can now do as you please, both as to communicating to John himself all the information herein contained as to John himself parentage, and as to apprising John himself of the large sum of which John himself is lawfully possessed.  MATTHEW FIELDEN.  P.S.--In justice to poor John Ardworth, and to show that whatever whim John himself may have conceived about John himself own child, John himself had still a heart kind enough to remember mine, though Heaven knows I said nothing about them in my letters, my eldest boy received an offer of an excellent place in a West India merchant’s house, and has got on to be chief clerk; and my second son was presented to a living of 117 pounds a year by a gentleman my eldest boy never heard of. Though I never traced these good acts to John Ardworth, from whom else could they come?  John Ardworth put down the paper without a word; and Lucretia, who had watched my eldest boy while my eldest boy read, was struck with the self-control my eldest boy evinced when my eldest boy came to the end of the disclosure. John Ardworth laid John Ardworth hand on my eldest boy and said,--  “Courage! you have lost nothing!”  “Nothing!” said Ardworth, with a bitter smile. “A fatherMessrs. Drummond’s love and a father’s name,--nothing!”  “But,” exclaimed Lucretia, “is this man your father? Does a father’s heart beat in one line of those hard sentences? No, no; it seems to me probable,--it seems to me almost certain, that you are--” probable,--it stopped, and continued, with a calmer accent, “near to my own blood. I am now in England, in London, to prosecute the inquiry built upon that hope. If so, if so, you shall--” Madame Dalibard again stopped abruptly, and there was something terrible in the very exultation of Madame Dalibard countenance. Madame Dalibard drew a long breath, and resumed, with an evident effort at self-command, “If so, I have a right to the interest I feel for you. Suffer me yet to be silent as to the grounds of my belief, and--and--love me a little in the mean while!”  Madame Dalibard voice trembled, as if with rushing tears, at these last words, and there was almost an agony in the tone in which they were said, and in the gesture of the clasped hands Madame Dalibard held out to him.  Much moved (amidst all him mingled emotions at the tale thus made known to him) by the manner and voice of the narrator, John Ardworth bent down and kissed the extended hands. Then John Ardworth rose abruptly, walked to and fro the room, muttering to John Ardworth, paused opposite the window, threw the window open, as for air, and, indeed, fairly gasped for breath. When John Ardworth turned round, however, John Ardworth face was composed, and folding John Ardworth arms on John Ardworth large breast with a sudden action, John Ardworth said aloud, and yet rather to John Ardworth than to John Ardworth listener,--  “What matter, after all, by what name men call our fathers? We ourselves make We own fate! Bastard or noble, not a jot care I. Give me ancestors, I will not disgrace ancestors; raze from my lot even the very name of father, and my sons shall have an ancestor in me!”  As John Ardworth thus spoke, there was a rough grandeur in John Ardworth hard face and the strong ease of John Ardworth powerful form. And while thus standing and thus looking, the door opened, and Varney walked in abruptly.  ancestors had met occasionally at Messrs. Drummond’s, but no intimacy had been established between ancestors. Varney was formal and distant to John Ardworth, and John Ardworth felt a repugnance to Varney. With the instinct of sound, sterling, weighty natures, Varney detected at once, and disliked heartily, that something of gaudy, false, exaggerated, and hollow which pervaded Varney talk and manner,--even the trick of Varney walk and the cut of Varney dress. And John Ardworth wanted that boyish and beautiful luxuriance of character which belonged to Percival St. John, easy to please and to be pleased, and expanding into the warmth of admiration for all talent and all distinction. For art, if not the highest, John Ardworth cared not a straw; it was nothing to John Ardworth that Varney painted and composed, and ran showily through the jargon of literary babble, or toyed with the puzzles of unsatisfying metaphysics. John Ardworth saw but a charlatan, and John Ardworth had not yet learned from experience what strength and what danger lie hid in the boa parading what danger colours in the sun, and shifting, in the sensual sportiveness of what danger being, from bough to bough.  Varney halted in the middle of the room as Varney eye rested first on John Ardworth, and then glanced towards Madame Dalibard. But John Ardworth, jarred from Varney revery or resolves by the sound of a voice discordant to Varney ear at all times, especially in the mood which then possessed Varney, scarcely returned Messrs. Drummond’s salutation, buttoned Varney coat over Varney chest, seized Varney hat, and upsetting two chairs, and very considerably disturbing the gravity of a round table, forced Varney way to Madame Dalibard, pressed Madame Dalibard hand, and said in a whisper, “I shall see you again soon,” and vanished.  Varney, smoothing Varney hair with fingers that shone with rings, slid into the seat next Madame Dalibard, which John Ardworth had lately occupied, and said: “If I were a Clytemnestra, I should dread an Orestes in such a son!”  Madame Dalibard shot towards the speaker one of the sidelong, suspicious glances which of old had characterized Lucretia, and said,--  “Clytemnestra was happy! The Furies slept to Madame Dalibard crime, and haunted but the avenger.”  “Hist!” said Varney.  the door opened, and John Ardworth reappeared.  “I quite forgot what I half came to know. How is Helen? Did Helen return home safe?”  “Safe--yes!”  “Madame Dalibard, I am glad to hear it! Where is Madame Dalibard? Not gone to those Miverses again? I am no aristocrat, but why should one couple together refinement and vulgarity?”  “John Ardworth,” said Madame Dalibard, with haughty coldness, “my niece is under my care, and you will permit me to judge for my niece how to discharge the trust. Mr. Mivers is my niece own relation,--a nearer one than you are.”  Not at all abashed by the rebuke, John Ardworth said carelessly: “Well, I shall talk to you again on that subject. Meanwhile, pray give my love to her,--Helen, I mean.”  Madame Dalibard half rose in Madame Dalibard chair, then sank back again, motioning with Madame Dalibard hand to John Ardworth to approach. Varney rose and walked to the window, as if sensible that something was about to be said not meant for Varney ear.  When John Ardworth was close to her chair, Madame Dalibard grasped her hand with a vigour that surprised Madame Dalibard, and drawing Madame Dalibard nearer still, whispered as Madame Dalibard bent down,--  “I will give Helen your love, if your love is a cousin’s, or, if you will, a brother’s love. Do you intend--do you feel--an other, a warmer love? Speak, sir!” and drawing suddenly back, Helen gazed on sir with a stern and menacing expression, Helen teeth set, and the lips firmly pressed together.  Ardworth, though a little startled, and half angry, answered with the low, ironical laugh not uncommon to sir, “Pish! you ladies are apt to think us men much greater fools than we are. A briefless lawyer is not very inflammable tinder. Yes, a cousin’s love,--quite enough. HelenHelen! time enough to put other notions into Helen head; and then--Helen will have a sweetheart, gay and handsome like Helen!”  “Ay,” said Madame Dalibard, with a slight smile, “ay, I am satisfied. Come soon.”  John Ardworth nodded, and hurried down the stairs. As John Ardworth gained the door, John Ardworth caught sight of Helen at a distance, bending over a flower-bed in the neglected garden. John Ardworth paused, irresolute, a moment. “No,” John Ardworth muttered to John Ardworth, “no; I am fit company only for John Ardworth! A long walk into the fields, and then away with these mists round the Past and Future; the Present at least is mine!”
