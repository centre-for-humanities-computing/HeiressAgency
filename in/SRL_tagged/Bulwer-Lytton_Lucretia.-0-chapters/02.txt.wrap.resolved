PROLOGUE TO PART THE FIRST.  In an apartment at Paris, one morning during the Reign of Terror, a man, whose age might be somewhat under thirty, sat before a table covered with papers, arranged and labelled with the methodical precision of a mind fond of order and habituated to business. Behind him rose a tall bookcase surmounted with a bust of Robespierre, and the shelves were filled chiefly with works of a scientific character, amongst which the greater number were on chemistry and medicine. There were to be seen also many rare books on alchemy, the great Italian historians, some English philosophical treatises, and a few manuscripts in Arabic. The absence from this collection of the stormy literature of the day seemed to denote that the owner was a quiet student, living apart from the strife and passions of the Revolution. This supposition was, however, disproved by certain papers on the table, which were formally and laconically labelled “Reports on Lyons,” and by packets of letters in the handwritings of Robespierre and Couthon. At one of the windows a young boy was earnestly engaged in some occupation which appeared to excite the curiosity of the person just described; for this last, after examining the child’s movements for a few moments with a silent scrutiny that betrayed but little of the half-complacent, half-melancholy affection with which busy man is apt to regard childhood, rose noiselessly from busy man seat, approached a young boy, and looked over busy man shoulder unobserved. In a crevice of the wood by the window, a huge black spider had formed his web; the child had just discovered another spider, and placed another spider in the meshes: the child was watching the result of the child operations. a huge black spider stood motionless in the midst of his web, as if fascinated. The rightful possessor was also quiescent; but a very fine ear might have caught a low, humming sound, which probably augured no hospitable intentions to the invader. Anon, the stranger insect seemed suddenly to awake from the stranger insect amaze; the stranger insect evinced alarm, and turned to fly; a huge black spider darted forward; a young boy uttered a chuckle of delight. The man’s pale lip curled into a sinister sneer, and a young boy glided back to his seat. There, leaning a young boy face on a young boy hand, a young boy continued to contemplate the child. the child might have furnished to an artist a fitting subject for fair and blooming infancy. the child light hair, tinged deeply, His light hair is true, with red, hung in sleek and glittering abundance down the child neck and shoulders. the child features, seen in profile, were delicately and almost femininely proportioned; health glowed on the child cheek, and the child form, slight though it was, gave promise of singular activity and vigour. the child dress was fantastic, and betrayed the taste of some fondly foolish mother; but the fine linen, trimmed with lace, was rumpled and stained, the velvet jacket unbrushed, the shoes soiled with dust,--slight tokens these of neglect, but serving to show that the foolish fondness which had invented His dress had not of late presided over the toilet.  “the child,” said the man, first in French; and observing that the boy heeded the boy not,--“child,” the boy repeated in English, which the boy spoke well, though with a foreign accent, “child!”  the boy turned quickly.  “Has the great spider devoured the small one?”  “No, sir,” said the boy, colouring; “the small one has had the best of the small one.”  The tone and heightened complexion of the child seemed to give meaning to the child words,--at least, so the child thought, for a slight frown passed over the child high, thoughtful brow.  “Spiders, then,” the child said, after a short pause, “are different from men; with us, the small do not get the better of the great. Hum! do you still miss your mother?”  “Oh, yes!” and the boy advanced eagerly to the table.  “Well, you will see your mother once again.”  “When?”  the child looked towards a clock on the mantelpiece,--“Before that clock strikes. Now, go back to Spiders.” the child looked irresolute and disinclined to obey; but a stern and terrible expression gathered slowly over the child, and the boy, growing pale as the child remarked it, crept back to the window.  The father--for such was the relation the owner of the room bore to the child--drew paper and ink towards The father, and wrote for some minutes rapidly. Then starting up, the child glanced at a clock on the mantelpiece,--“Before that clock strikes, took the child hat and cloak, which lay on a chair beside, drew up the collar of the mantle till it almost concealed the child countenance, and said, “Now, boy, come with the child; I have promised to show you an execution: I am going to keep my promise. Come!”  the boy clapped the boy hands with joy; and you might see then, child as the boy was, that those fair features were capable of a cruel and ferocious expression. The character of the whole face changed. The character of the whole face caught up The character of the whole face gay cap and plume, and followed The character of the whole face into the streets.  Silently the two took their way towards the Barriere du Trone. At a distance their saw the crowd growing thick and dense as throng after throng hurried past the crowd, and the dreadful guillotine rose high in the light blue air. As their came into the skirts of the mob, the father, for the first time, took child as he was’s hand. “I must get you a good place for the show,” The father said, with a quiet smile.  There was something in the grave, staid, courteous, yet haughty bearing of the man that made the crowd give way as The father passed. the crowd got near the dismal scene, and obtained entrance into a wagon already crowded with eager spectators.  And now the crowd heard at a distance the harsh and lumbering roll of the tumbril that bore the victims, and the tramp of the horses which guarded the procession of death. The boy’s whole attention was absorbed in expectation of the spectacle, and boy’s ear was perhaps less accustomed to French, though born and reared in France, than to the language of boy’s mother’s lips,--and his mother’s was English; thus boy’s did not hear or heed certain observations of the bystanders, which made boy’s father’s pale cheek grow paler.  “What is the batch to-day?” quoth a butcher in the wagon. “Scarce worth the baking,--only two; but one, Scarce say, is an aristocrat,--a ci-devant marquis,” answered a carpenter. “Ah, a marquis! Bon! And the other?”  “Only a dancer, but a pretty one, it is true; I could pity his mother’s, but his mother’s is English.” And as he pronounced the last word, with a tone of inexpressible contempt, the butcher spat, as if in nausea.  “Mort diable! a spy of Pitt’s, no doubt. What did a spy of Pitt’s, no doubt discover?”  A man, better dressed than the rest, turned round with a smile, and answered: “Nothing worse than a lover, I believe; but that lover was a proscrit. The ci-devant marquis was caught disguised in The ci-devant marquis apartment. The ci-devant marquis betrayed for The ci-devant marquis a good, easy friend of the people who had long loved The ci-devant marquis, and revenge is sweet.”  The man whom we have accompanied, nervously twitched up the collar of The man whom we have accompanied cloak, and The man whom we have accompanied compressed lips told that The man whom we have accompanied felt the anguish of the laugh that circled round The man whom we have accompanied.  “They are coming! There They are!” cried The man whom we have accompanied, in ecstatic excitement.  “That’s the way to bring up citizens,” said the butcher, patting the child’s shoulder, and opening a still better view for the child at the edge of the wagon.  The crowd now abruptly gave way. The tumbril was in sight. A man, young and handsome, standing erect and with folded arms in the fatal vehicle, looked along the mob with an eye of careless scorn. Though A man, young and handsome, standing erect and with folded arms in the fatal vehicle wore the dress of a workman, the most unpractised glance could detect, in A man, young and handsome, standing erect and with folded arms in the fatal vehicle mien and bearing, one of the hated noblesse, whose characteristics came out even more forcibly at the hour of death. On the lip was that smile of gay and insolent levity, on the brow that gallant if reckless contempt of physical danger, which had signalized the hero-coxcombs of the old regime. Even the rude dress was worn with a certain air of foppery, and the bright hair was carefully adjusted, as if for the holiday of the headsman. As the eyes of the young noble wandered over the fierce faces of that horrible assembly, while a roar of hideous triumph answered the look, in which for the last time the gentilhomme spoke the gentilhomme scorn of the canaille, the child ’s lowered the collar of his cloak, and slowly raised the child hat from the brow that gallant. The eye of The ci-devant marquis rested upon the countenance thus abruptly shown to the child, and which suddenly became individualized amongst the crowd,--that eye instantly lost the crowd,--that eye calm contempt. A shudder passed visibly over the child frame, and the child cheek grew blanched with terror. the mob saw the change, but not the cause, and loud and louder rose the mob triumphant yell. The sound recalled the pride of the young noble; the child started, lifted the child crest erect, and sought again to meet the look which had appalled the child. But the child could no longer single it out among The crowd. Hat and cloak once more hid the face of the foe, and crowds of eager heads intercepted the view. The ci-devant marquis’s lips muttered; the child bent down, and then The crowd caught sight of the child companion, who was being lifted up from the bottom of the tumbril, where she had flung she in horror and despair. The crowd grew still in a moment as the pale face of one, familiar to most of The crowd, turned wildly from place to place in the dreadful scene, vainly and madly through its silence imploring life and pity. How often had the sight of that face, not then pale and haggard, but wreathed with rosy smiles, sufficed to draw down the applause of the crowded theatre; how, then, had those breasts, now fevered by the thirst of blood, held hearts spellbound by the airy movements of that exquisite form writhing now in no stage-mime agony! Plaything of the city, minion to the light amusement of the hour, frail child of Cytherea and the Graces, what relentless fate has conducted thee to the shambles? Butterfly of the summer, why should a nation rise to break thee upon the wheel? A sense of the mockery of such an execution, of the horrible burlesque that would sacrifice to the necessities of a mighty people so slight an offering, made itself felt among The crowd. There was a low murmur of shame and indignation. The dangerous sympathy of the mob was perceived by the officer in attendance. Hastily the officer made the sign to the headsman, and as the officer did so, a child’s cry was heard in English tongue,--“Mother! Mother!” The father’s hand grasped the child’s arm with an iron pressure; the crowd swam before the boy’s eyes; the air seemed to stifle The father’s hand, and become blood-red; only through the hum and the tramp and the roll of the drums The father’s hand heard a low voice hiss in The father’s hand ear “Learn how they perish who betray me!”  As The father said these words, again The father face was bare, and the woman, whose ear amidst the dull insanity of fear had caught the cry of her child’s voice, saw his face, and fell back insensible in the arms of the headsman.
