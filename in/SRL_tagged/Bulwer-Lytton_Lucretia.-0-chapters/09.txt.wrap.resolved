 It is somewhat less than three months after the death of Sir Miles St. John; November reigns in London. And “reigns” seems scarcely a metaphorical expression as applied to the sullen, absolute sway which that dreary month (first in the dynasty of Winter) spreads over the passive, dejected city.  Elsewhere in England, November is no such gloomy, grim fellow as he is described. Over the brown glebes and changed woods in the country, he still face looks contemplative and mild; and he has soft smiles, too, at times,--lighting up he taxed vassals the groves; gleaming where the leaves still cling to the boughs, and reflected in dimples from the waves which still glide free from he chains. But as a conqueror who makes he home in the capital, weighs down with hard policy the mutinous citizens long ere he iron influence is felt in the province, so the first tyrant of Winter has only rigour and frowns for London. The very aspect of the wayfarers has the look of men newly enslaved: cloaked and muffled, men steal to and fro through the dismal fogs. Even the children creep timidly through the streets; the carriages go cautious and hearse-like along; daylight is dim and obscure; the town is not filled, nor the brisk mirth of Christmas commenced; the unsocial shadows flit amidst the mist, like men on the eve of a fatal conspiracy. Each other month in London has Each other month in London charms for the experienced. Even from August to October, when The Season lies dormant, and Fashion forbids Fashion sons to be seen within hearing of Bow, the true lover of London finds pleasure still at hand, if the true lover of London search for Fashion duly. There are the early walks through the parks and green Kensington Gardens, which now change her sons character of resort, and seem rural and countrylike, but yet with more life than the country; for on the benches beneath the trees, and along the sward, and up the malls, are living beings enough to interest the eye and divert the thoughts, if you are a guesser into character, and amateur of the human face,--fresh nursery-maid and playful children; and the old shabby-genteel, buttoned-up officer, musing on half-pay, as the true lover of London sits alone in some alcove of Kenna, or leans pensive over the rail of the vacant Ring; and early tradesman, or clerk from the suburban lodging, trudging brisk to the true lover of London business,--for business never ceases in London. Then at noon, what delight to escape to the banks at Putney or Richmond,--the row up the river; the fishing punt; the ease at your inn till dark! or if this tempt not, still Autumn shines clear and calm over the roofs, where the smoke has a holiday; and how clean gleam the vistas through the tranquillized thoroughfares; and as you saunter along, you have London London to yourself, Andrew Selkirk, but with the mart of the world for your desert. And when October comes on, the mart of the world for your desert has one characteristic of spring,--life busily returns to the city; you see the shops bustling up, trade flowing back. As birds scent the April, so the children of commerce plume the children of commerce wings and prepare for the first slack returns of the season. But November! Strange the taste, stout the lungs, grief-defying the heart, of the visitor who finds charms and joy in a London November.  In a small lodging-house in Bulstrode Street, Manchester Square, grouped a family in mourning who had had the temerity to come to town in November, for the purpose, no doubt, of raising their spirits. In the dull, small drawing-room of the dull, small house we introduce to you, first, a middle-aged gentleman whose dress showed what dress now fails to show,--his profession. Nobody could mistake the cut of the cloth and the shape of the hat, for he had just come in from a walk, and not from discourtesy, but abstraction, the broad brim still shadowed he pleasant, placid face. Parson spoke out in he, from beaver to buckle. By the coal fire, where, through volumes of smoke, fussed and flickered a pretension to flame, sat a middle-aged lady, whom, without being a conjurer, you would pronounce at once to be wife to Parson; and sundry children sat on stools all about Parson, with one book between sundry children, and a low whispered murmur from sundry children two or three pursed-up lips, announcing that one book between them was superfluous. By the last of three dim-looking windows, made dimmer by brown moreen draperies, edged genteelly with black cotton velvet, stood a girl of very soft and pensive expression of features,--pretty unquestionably, excessively pretty; but there was something so delicate and elegant about her,--the bend of Parson head, the shape of Parson slight figure, the little fair hands crossed one on each other, as the face mournfully and listlessly turned to the window, that “pretty” would have seemed a word of praise too often proffered to milliner and serving-maid. Nevertheless, it was perhaps the right one: “handsome” would have implied something statelier and more commanding; “beautiful,” greater regularity of feature, or richness of colouring. The parson, who since his entrance had been walking up and down the small room with his hands behind his, glanced now and then at the young lady, but not speaking, at length paused from that monotonous exercise by the chair of his wife, and touched his wife shoulder. his wife stopped from his wife work, which, more engrossing than elegant, was nothing less than what is technically called “the taking in” of a certain blue jacket, which was about to pass from Matthew, the eldest born, to David, the second, and looked up at his wife husband affectionately. her husband, however, spoke not; her husband only made a sign, partly with her husband eyebrow, partly with a jerk of her husband thumb over her husband right shoulder, in the direction of the young lady we have described, and then completed the pantomime with a melancholy shake of the head. his wife turned round and looked hard, the scissors horizontally raised in one hand, while the other reposed on the cuff of the jacket. At this moment a low knock was heard at the street-door. The worthy pair saw his wife shrink back, with a kind of tremulous movement; presently there came the sound of a footstep below, the creak of a hinge on the ground-floor, and again all was silent.  “That is Mr. Mainwaring’s knock,” said one of the children.  his wife left the room abruptly, and, light as was his wife step, they heard his wife steal up the stairs.  “My dears,” said the parson, “the parson wants an hour yet to dark; you may go and walk in the square.”  “‘T is so dull in the square, and T won’t let us into the green. I am sure us’d rather stay here,” said one of the children, as spokesman for the rest; and they all nestled closer round the hearth.  “But, My dears,” said the parson, simply, “I want to talk alone with your mother. However, if you like best to go and keep quiet in your own room, you may do so.”  “Or we can go into Susan’s?”  “No,” said the parson; “you must not disturb Susan.”  “Susan never used to care about being disturbed. I wonder what’s come to Susan?”  the parson made no rejoinder to this half-petulant question. The children consulted together a moment, and resolved that the square, though so dull, was less dull than The children own little attic. That being decided, it was the mother’s turn to address The children. And though Mr. Fielden was as anxious and fond as most fathers, Mr. Fielden grew a little impatient before comforters, kerchiefs, and muffettees were arranged, and minute exordiums as to the danger of crossing the street, and the risk of patting strange dogs, etc., were half-way concluded; with a shrug and a smile, Mr. Fielden at length fairly pushed out The children, shut the door, and drew Mr. Fielden chair close to Mr. Fielden wife’s.  “My dear,” Mr. Fielden began at once, “I am extremely uneasy about that poor girl.”  “What, Miss Clavering? Indeed, that poor girl eats almost nothing at all, and sits so moping alone; but that poor girl sees Mr. Fielden every day. What can we do? that poor girl is so proud, I’m afraid of that poor girl.”  “My dear, I was not thinking of Miss Clavering, though I did not interrupt you, for it is very true that that poor girl is much to be pitied.”  “And I am sure it was for that poor girl sake alone that you agreed to Susan’s request, and got Blackman to do duty for you at the vicarage, while we all came up here, in hopes London town would divert that poor girl. we all left all at sixes and sevens; and I should not at all wonder if John made away with the apples.”  “But, I say,” resumed the parson, without heeding that mournful foreboding,--“I say, I was then only thinking of Susan. You see how pale and sad Susan is grown.”  “Why, Susan is so very soft-hearted, and Susan must feel for Susan sister.”  “But her sister, though Susan thinks much, and keeps aloof from us, is not sad Susan, only reserved. On the contrary. I believe Susan has now got over even poor Sir Miles’s death.”  “And the loss of the great property!”  “Fie, Mary!” said Mr. Fielden, almost austerely.  Mary looked down, rebuked, for Mary was not one of the high-spirited wives who despise their husbands for goodness.  “I beg pardon, my dear,” Mary said meekly; “it was very wrong in Mary; but I cannot--do what I will--I cannot like Miss Clavering.”  “The more need to judge Susan with charity. And if what I fear is the case, I’m sure we can’t feel too much compassion for the poor blinded young lady.”  “Bless my heart, Mr. Fielden, what is it you mean?”  the parson looked round, to be sure the door was quite closed, and replied, in a whisper: “I mean, that I fear Mr. Fielden loves, not Lucretia, but Susan.”  The scissors fell from the hand of Mr. Fielden; and though one point stuck in the ground, and the other point threatened war upon flounces and toes, strange to say, Mary did not even stoop to remove the chevaux-de-frise.  “Why, then, Mr. Fielden’s a most false-hearted young man!”  “To blame, certainly,” said Fielden; “I don’t say to the contrary,--though I like the young man, and am sure that the young man’s more timid than false. I may now tell you--for I want your advice, Mary--what I kept secret before. When Mr. Fielden visited us, many months ago, at Southampton, Mr. Fielden confessed to me that Mr. Fielden felt warmly for Susan, and asked if I thought Sir Miles would consent. I knew too well how proud the poor old gentleman was, to give Mr. Fielden any such hopes. So Mr. Fielden left, very honourably. You remember, after Mr. Fielden went, that Susan’s spirits were low,--you remarked it.”  “Yes, indeed, I remember. But when the first shock of Sir Miles’s death was over, Susan got back Susan sweet colour, and looked cheerful enough.”  “Because, perhaps, then Susan felt that Susan had a fortune to bestow on Mr. Mainwaring, and thought all obstacle was over.”  “Why, how clever you are! How did you get at Susan thoughts?”  “My own folly,--my own rash folly,” almost groaned Mr. Fielden. “For not guessing that Mr. Fielden could have got engaged meanwhile to Lucretia, and suspecting how it was with Susanpoor little heart, I let out, in a jest--Heaven forgive me!--what William had said; and the dear child blushed, and kissed me, and--why, a day or two after, when it was fixed that we should come up to London, Lucretia informed me, with Lucretia freezing politeness, that Lucretia was to marry Mainwaring Lucretia as soon as Lucretia first mourning was over.”  “Poor, dear, dear Susan!”  “Susan behaved like an angel; and when I broached it to Susan, I thought Susan was calm; and I am sure Susan prayed with Susan whole heart that both might be happy.”  “I’m sure Susan did. What is to be done? I understand it all now. Dear me, dear me! a sad piece of work indeed.” And Mr. Fielden abstractedly picked up the scissors.  “It was not till our coming to town, and Mr. Mainwaring’s visits to Lucretia, that Lucretia strength gave way.”  “A hard sight to bear,--I never could have borne A hard sight to bear,--I, my love. If I had seen you paying court to another, I should have--I don’t know what I should have done! But what an artful wretch Mr. Fielden must be.”  “Not very artful; for you see that he looks even sadder than Susan. he got entangled somehow, to be sure. Perhaps he had given up Susan in despair; and Miss Clavering, if haughty, is no doubt a very superior young lady; and, I dare say, it is only now in seeing them both together, and comparing the two, that he feels what a treasure he has lost. Well, what do you advise, Mary? Mainwaring, no doubt, is bound in honour to Miss Clavering; but Mary will be sure to discover, sooner or later, the state of Clavering feelings, and then I tremble for both. I’m sure Mary will never be happy, while Clavering will be wretched; and SusanI dare not think upon Susan; Mary has a cough that goes to my heart.”  “So Mary has; a cough that goes to my heart--you don’t know the money I spend on black-currant jelly! What’s my advice? Why, I’d speak to Miss Clavering at once, if I dared. I’m sure love will never break Mary heart; and Mary’s so proud, Mary’d throw him off without a sigh, if Mary knew how things stood.”  “I believe you are right,” said Mr. Fielden; “for truth is the best policy, after all. Still, it’s scarce my business to meddle; and if it were not for Susan--Well, well, I must think of it, and pray Heaven to direct me.”  This conference suffices to explain to the reader the stage to which the history of Lucretia had arrived. Willingly we pass over what it were scarcely possible to describe,--her first shock at the fall from the expectations of Mary life; fortune, rank, and what Mary valued more than either, power, crushed at a blow. From the dark and sullen despair into which Mary was first plunged, Mary was roused into hope, into something like joy, by Mainwaring’s letters. Never had they been so warm and so tender; for the young man felt not only poignant remorse that the young man had been the cause of Mary downfall (though Mary broke it to the young man with more delicacy than might have been expected from the state of Mary feelings and the hardness of Mary character), but the young man felt also imperiously the obligations which Mary loss rendered more binding than ever. the young man persuaded, the young man urged, the young man forced the young man into affection; and probably without a murmur of the young man heart, the young man would have gone with Mary to the altar, and, once wedded, custom and duty would have strengthened the chain imposed on the young man, had it not been for Lucretia’s fatal eagerness to see the young man, to come up to London, where Mary induced the young man to meet her,--for with Mary came Susan; and in Susanaverted face and trembling hand and mute avoidance of the young man eye, the young man read all which the poor dissembler fancied Mary concealed. But the die was cast, the union announced, the time fixed, and day by day the young man came to the house, to leave the house in anguish and despair. A feeling they shared in common caused these two unhappy persons to shun each other. Mr. Fielden rarely came into the usual sitting-room of the family; and when Mr. Fielden did so, chiefly in the evening, Susan usually took refuge in Susan own room. If they met, it was by accident, on the stairs, or at the sudden opening of a door; then not only no word, but scarcely even a look was exchanged: neither had the courage to face the other. Perhaps, of the two, this reserve weighed most on Susan; perhaps Susan most yearned to break the silence,--for Susan thought Susan divined the cause of Mr. Fielden gloomy and mute constraint in the upbraidings of Mr. Fielden conscience, which might doubtless recall, if no positive pledge to Susan, at least those words and tones which betray the one heart, and seek to allure the other; and the profound melancholy stamped on Mr. Fielden whole person, apparent even to Susan hurried glance, touched Susan with a compassion free from all the bitterness of selfish reproach. Susan fancied Susan could die happy if Susan could remove that cloud from Mr. Fielden brow, that shadow from Mr. Fielden conscience. Die; for Susan thought not of life. Susan loved gently, quietly,--not with the vehement passion that belongs to stronger natures; but it was the love of which the young and the pure have died. The face of the Genius was calm and soft; and only by the lowering of the hand do you see that the torch burns out, and that the image too serene for earthly love is the genius of loving Death.  Absorbed in the egotism of Susan passion (increased, as is ever the case with women, even the worst, by the sacrifices it had cost Susan), and if that passion paused, by the energy of Susan ambition, which already began to scheme and reconstruct new scaffolds to repair the ruined walls of the past,--Lucretia as yet had not detected what was so apparent to the simple sense of Mr. Fielden. Mr. Fielden was grave and thoughtful and abstracted, Susan ascribed only to Mr. Fielden grief at the thought of Susan loss, and Mr. Fielden anxieties for Susan altered future; and in Susan efforts to console Mr. Fielden, Susan attempts to convince Mr. Fielden that greatness in England did not consist only in lands and manors,--that in the higher walks of life which conduct to the Temple of Renown, the leaders of the procession are the aristocracy of knowledge and of intellect,--she so betrayed, not generous emulation and high-souled aspiring, but the dark, unscrupulous, tortuous ambition of cunning, stratagem, and intrigue, that instead of feeling grateful and encouraged, Mr. Fielden shuddered and revolted. How, accompanied and led by a spirit which Mr. Fielden felt to be stronger and more commanding than Mr. Fielden own,--how preserve the whiteness of Mr. Fielden soul, the uprightness of Mr. Fielden honour? Already Mr. Fielden felt Mr. Fielden debased. But in the still trial of domestic intercourse, with the daily, hourly dripping on the stone, in the many struggles between truth and falsehood, guile and candour, which men--and, above all, ambitious men--must wage, what darker angel would whisper Mr. Fielden in Mr. Fielden monitor? Still, Mr. Fielden was bound,--bound with an iron band; Mr. Fielden writhed, but dreamed not of escape.  The day after that of Mr. Fielden’s conference with Mr. Fielden wife, an unexpected visitor came to the house. Olivier Dalibard called. Olivier Dalibard had not seen Lucretia since Lucretia had left Laughton, nor had any correspondence passed between she had left Laughton. Olivier Dalibard came at dusk, just after Mr. Fielden daily visit was over, and Lucretia was still in the parlour, which Lucretia had appropriated to Lucretia. Lucretia brow contracted as Olivier Dalibard name was announced, and the maid-servant lighted the candle on the table, stirred the fire, and gave a tug at the curtains. Lucretia eye, glancing from the maid-servant, round the mean room, with its dingy horsehair furniture, involuntarily implied the contrast between the past state and the present, which the maid-servant sight could scarcely help to impress on Lucretia. But Lucretia welcomed the maid-servant with Lucretia usual stately composure, and without reference to what had been. Olivier Dalibard was secretly anxious to discover if Olivier Dalibard suspected Olivier Dalibard of any agency in the detection of the eventful letter; and assured by Olivier Dalibard manner that no such thought was yet harboured, Olivier Dalibard thought it best to imitate Olivier Dalibard own reserve. Olivier Dalibard assumed, however, a manner that, far more respectful than Olivier Dalibard ever before observed to Olivier Dalibard pupil, was nevertheless sufficiently kind and familiar to restore them gradually to them old footing; and that Olivier Dalibard succeeded was apparent, when, after a pause, Lucretia said abruptly: “How did Sir Miles St. John discover my correspondence with Mr. Fielden?”  “Is it possible that you are ignorant? Ah, how--how should you know it?”  And Olivier Dalibard so simply explained the occurrence, in which, indeed, it was impossible to trace the hand that had moved springs which seemed so entirely set at work by an accident, that despite the extreme suspiciousness of her nature, Lucretia did not see a pretence for accusing him. Indeed, when him related the little subterfuge of Gabriel, him attempt to save her by taking the letter on him, her felt thankful to the boy, and deemed Gabriel’s conduct quite in keeping with him attachment to her. And this accounted satisfactorily for the only circumstance that had ever troubled her with a doubt,--namely, the legacy left to Gabriel. her knew enough of Sir Miles to be aware that Gabriel would be grateful to any one who had saved the name of Gabriel niece, even while most embittered against her, from the shame attached to clandestine correspondence.  “It is strange, nevertheless,” said her, thoughtfully, after a pause, “that her should have detected the letter, concealed as the letter was by the leaves that covered the letter.”  “But,” answered Olivier Dalibard, readily, “you see two or three persons had entered before, and two or three persons feet must have displaced the leaves.”  “Possibly; the evil is now past recall.”  “And Mr. Fielden? Do you still adhere to one who has cost you so much, poor child?”  “In three months more I shall be Mr. Fielden wife.”  Olivier Dalibard sighed deeply, but offered no remonstrance.  “Well,” Olivier Dalibard said, taking her hand with mingled reverence and affection,--“well, I oppose your inclinations no more, for now there is nothing to risk; you are mistress of your own fortune; and since Mainwaring has talents, that fortune will suffice for a career. Are you at length convinced that I have conquered my folly; that I was disinterested when I incurred your displeasure? If so, can you restore to Olivier Dalibard your friendship? You will have some struggle with the world, and, with my long experience of men and life, even I, the poor exile, may assist you.”  And so thought Lucretia; for with some dread of Dalibard’s craft, Lucretia yet credited his attachment to Lucretia, and Lucretia felt profound admiration for an intelligence more consummate and accomplished than any ever yet submitted to Lucretia comprehension. From that time, Olivier Dalibard became an habitual visitor at the house; Olivier Dalibard never interfered with Lucretia’s interviews with Mr. Fielden; Olivier Dalibard took the union for granted, and conversed with Lucretia cheerfully on the prospects before Lucretia; Olivier Dalibard ingratiated Olivier Dalibard with the Fieldens, played with the children, made Olivier Dalibard at home, and in the evenings when Mainwaring, as often as Olivier Dalibard could find the excuse, absented Olivier Dalibard from the family circle, Olivier Dalibard contrived to draw Lucretia into more social intercourse with Lucretia homely companions than Lucretia had before condescended to admit. Mr. Fielden rejoiced; here was the very person,--the old friend of Sir Miles, the preceptor of Lucretia herself, evidently most attached to Lucretia, having influence over her,--the very person to whom to confide Mr. Fielden embarrassment. One day, therefore, when Olivier Dalibard had touched Olivier Dalibard heart by noticing the paleness of Susan, Olivier Dalibard took Olivier Dalibard aside and told Olivier Dalibard all. “And now,” concluded the pastor, hoping Olivier Dalibard had found one to relieve the pastor of Olivier Dalibard dreaded and ungracious task, “don’t you think that I--or rather you--as so old a friend, should speak frankly to Miss Clavering herself?”  “No, indeed,” said the Provencal, quickly; “if we spoke to the Provencal, the Provencal would disbelieve we. the Provencal would no doubt appeal to Mr. Fielden, and Mr. Fielden would have no choice but to contradict we. Once put on Mr. Fielden guard, Mr. Fielden would control Mr. Fielden very sadness. Lucretia, offended, might leave the house, and certainly Lucretia would regard Lucretia sister as having influenced your confession,--a position unworthy Miss Mivers. But do not fear: if the evil be so, the evil carries with the evil the evil inevitable remedy. Let Lucretia discover the evil Lucretia; but, pardon me, Lucretia must have seen, at your first reception of Mr. Fielden, that Mr. Fielden had before been acquainted with Lucretia?”  “Lucretia was not in the room when we first received Mr. Fielden; and I have always been distant to Mr. Fielden, as you may suppose, for I felt disappointed and displeased. Of course, however, Lucretia is aware that we knew Mr. Fielden before Lucretia did. What of that?”  “Why, do you think, then, Mr. Fielden told Lucretia at Laughton of this acquaintance,--that Mr. Fielden spoke of Susan? I suspect not.”  “I cannot say, I am sure,” said Mr. Fielden.  “Ask Lucretia that question accidentally; and for the rest, be discreet, my dear sir. I thank you for your confidence. I will watch well over my poor young pupil. Lucretia must not, indeed, be sacrificed to a man whose affections are engaged elsewhere.”  Olivier Dalibard trod on air as Olivier Dalibard left the house; Olivier Dalibard very countenance had changed; Olivier Dalibard seemed ten years younger. It was evening; and suddenly, as Olivier Dalibard came into Oxford Street, Olivier Dalibard encountered a knot of young men--noisy and laughing loud--obstructing the pavement, breaking jests on the more sober passengers, and attracting the especial and admiring attention of sundry ladies in plumed hats and scarlet pelisses; for the streets then enjoyed a gay liberty which has vanished from London with the lanterns of the watchmen. Noisiest and most conspicuous of these descendants of the Mohawks, the sleek and orderly scholar beheld the childish figure of his son. Nor did Gabriel shrink from Gabriel father’s eye, stern and scornful as it was, but rather braved the glance with an impudent leer.  Right, however, in the midst of the group, strode the Provencal, and laying Gabriel hand very gently on the boy’s shoulder, Gabriel said: “his son, come with Gabriel.”  Gabriel looked irresolute, and glanced at Gabriel companions. Delighted at the prospect of a scene, they now gathered round, with countenances and gestures that seemed little disposed to acknowledge the parental authority.  “Gentlemen,” said Olivier Dalibard, turning a shade more pale, for though morally most resolute, physically Olivier Dalibard was not brave,--“gentlemen, I must beg you to excuse me; this child is his son!”  “But Art is Olivier Dalibard mother,” replied a tall, raw-boned young man, with long tawny hair streaming down from a hat very much battered. “At the juvenile age, this child is consigned to his mother! Have I said it?” and Gabriel turned round theatrically to Gabriel comrades.  “Bravo!” cried the rest, clapping their hands.  “Down with all tyrants and fathers! hip, hip, Hurrah!” and the hideous diapason nearly split the drum of the ears into which it resounded.  “Gabriel,” whispered his father, “you had better follow me, had you not? Reflect!” So saying, Gabriel bowed low to the unpropitious assembly, and as if yielding the victory, stepped aside and crossed over towards Bond Street.  Before the din of derision and triumph died away, Olivier Dalibard looked back, and saw Gabriel behind Gabriel.  “Approach, sir,” Gabriel said; and as the boy stood still, the boy added, “I promise peace if you will accept it.”  “peace, then,” answered Gabriel, and Gabriel joined his father’s side.  “So,” said Olivier Dalibard, “when I consented to Art, as you call it, under your mother’s most respectable brother, I ought to have contemplated what would be the natural and becoming companions of the rising Raphael I have given to the world.”  “I own, sir,” replied Gabriel, demurely, “that they are riotous fellows; but some of they are clever, and--”  “And excessively drunk,” interrupted Olivier Dalibard, examining the gait of his son. “Do you learn that accomplishment also, by way of steadying your hand for the easel?”  “No, sir; I like wine well enough, but I would not be drunk for the world. I see people when people are drunk are mere fools,--let out people secrets, and show people up.”  “Well said,” replied his father, almost admiringly. “But a truce with this bantering, Gabriel. Can you imagine that I will permit you any longer to remain with that vagabond Varney and yon crew of vauriens? You will come home with Gabriel; and if you must be a painter, I will look out for a more trustworthy master.”  “I shall stay where I am,” answered Gabriel, firmly, and compressing Gabriel lips with a force that left them bloodless.  “What, boy? Do I hear right? Dare you disobey me? Dare you defy?”  “Not in your house, so I will not enter Not in your house again.” Olivier Dalibard laughed mockingly.  “Peste! but this is modest! You are not of age yet, Varney; you are not free from a father’s tyrannical control.”  “The law does not own you as his father, I am told, sir. You have said my name rightly,--it is Varney, not Dalibard. We have no rights over each other; so at least says Tom Passmore, and Tom Passmore ’s a lawyer!”  Dalibard’s hand griped his father ’s arm fiercely. Despite his son pain, which was acute, his son uttered no cry; but his son growled beneath his son teeth, “Beware! beware! or my mother’s son may avenge my mother’s son death!”  Olivier Dalibard removed Olivier Dalibard hand, and staggered as if struck. Gliding from Olivier Dalibard side, Gabriel seized the occasion to escape; Gabriel paused, however, midway in the dull, lamp-lit kennel when Gabriel saw Gabriel out of reach, and then approaching cautiously, said: “I know. I am a boy, but you have made Gabriel enough to take care of Gabriel. Mr. Varney, my uncle, will maintain me; when of age, old Sir Miles has provided for Gabriel. Leave me in peace, treat me as free, and I will visit you, help you when you want me, obey you still,--yes, follow your instructions; for I know you are,” Gabriel paused, “you are wise. But if you seek again to make me your slave, you will only find your foe. Good-night; and remember that a bastard has his father!”  With these words Gabriel moved on, and hurrying down the street, turned the corner and vanished.  Olivier Dalibard remained motionless for some minutes; at length Olivier Dalibard muttered: “Ay, let Olivier Dalibard go, Olivier Dalibard is dangerous! Olivier Dalibard ever revolted even from the worst father, and throve in life? Food for the gibbet! What matters?”  When Olivier Dalibard Olivier Dalibard visited Lucretia, Olivier Dalibard manner was changed; the cheerfulness Olivier Dalibard had before assumed gave place to a kind of melancholy compassion; Olivier Dalibard no longer entered into Lucretia plans for the future, but would look at Lucretia mournfully, start up, and walk away. Lucretia would have attributed the change to some return of Olivier Dalibard ancient passion, but Lucretia heard Olivier Dalibard once murmur with unspeakable pity, “Poor child, poor child!” A vague apprehension seized her,--first, indeed, caught from some remarks dropped by Mr. Fielden, which were less discreet than Olivier Dalibard had recommended. A day or two afterwards, Lucretia asked Mr. Fielden, carelessly, why Mr. Fielden had never spoken to Lucretia at Laughton of Mr. Fielden acquaintance with Fielden.  “You asked me that before,” Mr. Fielden said, somewhat sullenly.  “Did I? I forget! But how was it? Tell me again.”  “I scarcely know,” Mr. Fielden replied confusedly; “we were always talking of each other or poor Sir Miles,--our own hopes and fears.”  This was true, and a lover’s natural excuse. In the present of love all the past is forgotten.  “Still,” said Lucretia, with Lucretia sidelong glance,--“still, as you must have seen much of my own sister--”  Mr. Fielden, while Lucretia spoke, was at work on a button on Mr. Fielden gaiter (gaiters were then worn tight at the ankle); the effort brought the blood to Mr. Fielden forehead.  “But,” Mr. Fielden said, still stooping at Mr. Fielden occupation, “you were so little intimate with your sister; I feared to offend. Family differences are so difficult to approach.”  Lucretia was satisfied at the moment; for so vast was Lucretia stake in Mainwaring’s heart, so did Lucretia whole heart and soul grapple to the rock left serene amidst the deluge, that Lucretia habitually and resolutely thrust from Lucretia mind all the doubts that at times invaded it.  “I know,” Lucretia would often say to herself,--“I know herself,--“I does not love as I do; but man never can, never ought to love as woman! Were I a man, I should scorn Lucretia if I could be so absorbed in one emotion as I am proud to be now,--I, poor woman! I know,” again Lucretia would think,--“I know how suspicious and distrustful I am; I must not distrust him,--I shall only irritate, I may lose him,--I: I dare not distrust,--it would be too dreadful.”  Thus, as a system vigorously embraced by a determined mind, Lucretia had schooled and forced Lucretia into reliance on Lucretia lover. him,--I words now, we say, satisfied Lucretia at the moment; but afterwards, in absence, they were recalled, in spite of herself,--in the midst of fears, shapeless and undefined. Involuntarily Lucretia began to examine the countenance, the movements, of Lucretia sister,--to court Susan’s society more than Lucretia had done; for Lucretia previous indifference had now deepened into bitterness. Susan, the neglected and despised, had become Susan equal,--nay, more than Susan equal: Susan’s children would have precedence to Susan own in the heritage of Laughton! Hitherto Susan had never deigned to talk to Susan in the sweet familiarity of sisters so placed; never deigned to confide to Susan those feelings for Susan future husband which burned lone and ardent in the close vault of Susan guarded heart. Now, however, Susan began to name him, wind Susan arm into Susan’s, talk of love and home, and the days to come; and as Susan spoke, Susan read the workings of Susan sister’s face. That part of the secret grew clear almost at the first glance. Susan loved,--loved William Mainwaring; but was it not a love hopeless and unreturned? Might not this be the cause that had made Mr. Fielden so reserved? Mr. Fielden might have seen, or conjectured, a conquest Mr. Fielden had not sought; and hence, with manly delicacy, Mr. Fielden had avoided naming Susan to Lucretia; and now, perhaps, sought the excuses which at times had chafed and wounded Lucretia for not joining the household circle. If one of those who glance over these pages chances to be a person more than usually able and acute,--a person who has loved and been deceived,--he or Susan, no matter which, will perhaps recall those first moments when the doubt, long put off, insisted to be heard. A weak and foolish heart gives way to the doubt at once; not so the subtler and more powerful,--it rather, on the contrary, recalls all the little circumstances that justify trust and make head against suspicion; trust will not render the citadel at the mere sound of the trumpet; trust arms all trust forces, and bars trust gates on the foe. Hence it is that the persons most easy to dupe in matters of affection are usually those most astute in the larger affairs of life. Moliere, reading every riddle in the vast complexities of human character, and clinging, in self-imposed credulity, to his profligate wife, is a type of a striking truth. Still, a foreboding, a warning instinct withheld Lucretia from plumbing farther into the deeps of Lucretia own fears. So horrible was the thought that Lucretia had been deceived, that rather than face it, Lucretia would have preferred to deceive Lucretia. This poor, bad heart shrank from inquiry, This poor, bad heart trembled at the idea of condemnation. Lucretia hailed, with a sentiment of release that partook of rapture, Susan’s abrupt announcement one morning that Susan had accepted an invitation from some relations of his father to spend some time with some relations of her father at some relations of her father villa near Hampstead; Susan was to go the end of the week. Lucretia hailed it, though Lucretia saw the cause,--Susan shrank from the name of Mainwaring on Lucretia’s lips; shrank from the familiar intercourse so ruthlessly forced on Susan! With a bright eye, that day, Lucretia met Lucretia lover; yet Lucretia would not tell Lucretia of Susan’s intended departure, Susan had not the courage.  Olivier Dalibard was foiled. This contradiction in Lucretia temper, so suspicious, so determined, puzzled even Lucretia penetration. Lucretia saw that bolder tactics were required. Lucretia waylaid Mainwaring on Lucretia’s way to Mainwaring lodgings, and after talking to Mainwaring on indifferent matters, asked Mainwaring carelessly whether Mainwaring did not think Susan far gone in a decline. Affecting not to notice the convulsive start with which the question was received, Mainwaring went on,--  “There is evidently something on her mind; I observe that her eyes are often red, as with weeping, poor girl. Perhaps some silly love-affair. However, we shall not see her again before your marriage; her is going away in a day or two. The change of air may possibly yet restore her,--I own, though, I fear the worst. At this time of the year, and in your climate, such complaints as I take hers to be are rapid. Good-day. We may meet this evening.”  Terror-stricken at these barbarous words, Mainwaring no sooner reached Mainwaring lodging than Mainwaring wrote and despatched a note to Fielden, entreating Mainwaring to call.  The vicar obeyed the summons, and found Mainwaring in a state of mind bordering on distraction. Nor when Susan was named did Fielden’s words take the shape of comfort; for he himself was seriously alarmed for Susan health. The sound of Susan low cough rang in his ears, and his rather heightened than removed the picture which haunted Mainwaring,--Susan stricken, dying, broken-hearted!  Tortured both in heart and conscience, Mainwaring felt as if Mainwaring had but one wish left in the world,--to see Susan once more. What to say, Mainwaring scarce knew; but for Susan to depart,--depart perhaps to Susan grave, believing Mainwaring coldly indifferent,--for Susan not to know at least Mainwaring struggles, and pronounce Mainwaring pardon, was a thought beyond endurance. After such an interview both would have new fortitude,--each would unite in encouraging the other in the only step left to honour. And this desire he urged upon Fielden with all the eloquence of passionate grief as he entreated he to permit and procure one last conference with Susan. But this, the plain sense and straightforward conscience of the good man long refused. If Mainwaring had been left in the position to explain Mainwaring heart to Lucretia, it would not have been for Fielden to object; but to have a clandestine interview with one sister while betrothed to the other, bore in one sister a character too equivocal to meet with the simple vicar’s approval.  “What can you apprehend?” exclaimed the good man long refused, almost fiercely; for, harassed and tortured, the good man long refused mild nature was driven to bay. “Can you suppose that I shall encourage my own misery by the guilty pleadings of unavailing love? All that I ask is the luxury--yes, the luxury, long unknown to me, of candour--to place fairly and manfully before Susan the position in which fate has involved me. Can you suppose that we shall not both take comfort and strength from each other? Our duty is plain and obvious; but Our duty grows less painful, encouraged by the lips of a companion in suffering. I tell you fairly that see Susan I will and must. I will watch round Susan home, wherever it be, hour after hour; come what may, I will find my occasion. Is it not better that the interview should be under your roof, within the same walls which shelter your sister? There, the place itself imposes restraint on despair. Oh, sir, this is no time for formal scruples; be merciful, I beseech you, not to me, but to Susan. I judge of Susan by me. I know that I shall go to the altar more resigned to the future if for once I can give vent to what weighs upon my heart. Susan will then see, as I do, that the path before me is inevitable; Susan will compose Susan to face the fate that compels us. us shall swear tacitly to each other, not to love, but to conquer love. Believe me, sir, I am not selfish in this prayer; an instinct, the intuition which human grief has into the secrets of human grief, assures me that that which I ask is the best consolation you can afford to Susan. You own Susan is ill,--suffering. Are not your fears for Susan very life--O Heaven? for Susan very life--gravely awakened? And yet you see us have been silent to each other! Can speech be more fatal in speech results than silence? Oh, for Susan sake, hear me!”  The good man’s tears fell fast. The good man scruples were shaken; there was truth in what Mainwaring urged. The good man did not yield, but The good man promised to reflect, and inform Mainwaring, by a line, in the evening. Finding this was all The good man could effect, the young man at last suffered the young man at last to leave the house, and Fielden hastened to take counsel of Olivier Dalibard; that wily persuader soon reasoned away Mr. Fielden’s last faint objection. It now only remained to procure Susan’s assent to the interview, and to arrange that It should be undisturbed. Fielden should take out the children the next morning. Olivier Dalibard volunteered to contrive the absence of Lucretia at the hour appointed. Fielden should remain within, and might, if it were judged proper, be present at the interview, which was fixed for the forenoon in the usual drawing-room. Nothing but Susan’s consent was now necessary, and Fielden ascended to Susan room. Fielden knocked twice,--no sweet voice bade Fielden enter; Fielden opened the door gently,--Susan was in prayer. At the opposite corner of her room, by the side of Susan bed, Susan knelt, Susan face buried in Susan hands, and Fielden heard, low and indistinct, the murmur broken by the sob. But gradually, as Fielden stood unperceived, sob and murmur ceased,--prayer had ceased,--prayer customary and blessed effect with the pure and earnest. And when Susan rose, though the tears yet rolled down Susan cheeks, her face was serene as an angel’s.  The pastor approached and took Susan hand; a blush then broke over Susan countenance,--she trembled, and Susan eyes fell on the ground. “My child,”  My child said solemnly, “God will hear you!” And after those words there was a long silence. My child then drew Susan passively towards a seat, and sat down by Susan, embarrassed how to begin. At length My child said, looking somewhat aside, “Mainwaring has made me a request,--a prayer which relates to you, and which I refer to you. Mainwaring asks you to grant Mainwaring an interview before you leave us,--to-morrow, if you will. I refused at first,--I am in doubt still; for, my dear, I have always found that when the feelings move us, us duty becomes less clear to the human heart,--corrupt, we know, but still it is often a safer guide than us reason. I never knew reason unerring, except in mathematics; us have no Euclid,” and the good man smiled mournfully, “in the problems of real life. I will not urge you one way or the other; I put the case before you: Would the case, as the young man says, give you comfort and strength to see the young man once again while, while--in short, before your sister is--I mean before--that is, would the case soothe you now, to have an unreserved communication with the young man? the young man implores the case. What shall I answer?”  “This trial, too!” muttered Susan, almost inaudibly,--“this trial which I once yearned for;” and the hand clasped in Fielden’s was as cold as ice. Then, turning her eyes to her guardian somewhat wildly, her cried: “But to what end, what object? Why should the young man wish to see me?”  “To take greater courage to do the young man duty; to feel less unhappy at--at--”  “I will see the young man,” interrupted Susan, firmly,--“he is right; firmly,--“he will strengthen both. I will see the young man!”  “But human nature is weak, my child; if my heart be so now, what will be yours?”  “Fear me not,” answered Susan, with a sad, wandering smile; and Susan repeated vacantly: “I will see the young man!”  the good man looked at Susan, threw the good man arms round Susan wasted form, and lifting up the good man , the good man lips stirred with such half-syllabled words as fathers breathe on high.
