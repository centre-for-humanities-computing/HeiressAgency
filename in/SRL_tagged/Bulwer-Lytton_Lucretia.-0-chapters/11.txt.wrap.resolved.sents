 When Mr. Fielden returned home, Lucretia had quitted the house.
Lucretia left a line for Mr. Fielden in Lucretia usual bold, clear handwriting, referring Mr. Fielden to Mr. Fielden wife for explanation of the reasons that forbade a further residence beneath Mr. Fielden roof.
Lucretia had removed to an hotel until Lucretia had leisure to arrange Lucretia plans for the future.
In a few months Lucretia should be of age; and in the meanwhile, who now living claimed authority over Lucretia?
For the rest, Lucretia added, “I repeat what I told Mr. Mainwaring: all engagement between us is at an end; Mr. Mainwaring will not insult me either by letter or by visit.
It is natural that I should at present shrink from seeing Susan Mivers.
Hereafter, if permitted, I will visit Mr. Mainwaring.”  Though all had chanced as Mr. Fielden had desired (if, as Mr. Fielden once half meditated, Mr. Fielden had spoken to Lucretia herself); though a marriage that could have brought happiness to none, and would have made the misery of two, was at an end,--he yet felt a bitter pang, almost of remorse, when Mr. Fielden learned what had occurred.
And Lucretia, before secretly disliked (if any one Mr. Fielden could dislike), became dear to Mr. Fielden at once, by sorrow and compassion.
Forgetting every other person, Mr. Fielden hurried to the hotel Lucretia had chosen; but Lucretia coldness deceived and Lucretia pride repelled Mr. Fielden.
Lucretia listened dryly to all Mr. Fielden said, and merely replied: “I feel only gratitude at my escape.
Let this subject now close forever.”  Mr. Fielden left Mr. Fielden presence with less anxious and commiserating feelings,--perhaps all had chanced for the best.
And on returning home, Mr. Fielden whole mind became absorbed in alarm for Susan.
Susan was delirious, and in great danger; it was many weeks before Susan recovered.
Meanwhile, Lucretia had removed into private apartments, of which Lucretia withheld the address.
During this time, therefore, they lost sight of Lucretia.
If amidst the punishments with which the sombre imagination of poets has diversified the Realm of the tortured Shadows, it had depicted some soul condemned to look evermore down into an abyss, all change to it gaze forbidden, chasm upon chasm yawning deeper and deeper, darker and darker, endless and infinite, so that, eternally gazing, the soul became, as the soul were, a part of the abyss,--such an image would symbol forth the state of Lucretia mind.
It was not the mere desolation of one whom love has abandoned and betrayed.
In the abyss were mingled inextricably together the gloom of the past and of the future,--there, the broken fortunes, the crushed ambition, the ruin of the worldly expectations long inseparable from Lucretia schemes; and amidst her schemes, the angry shade of the more than father, whose heart Lucretia had wrung, and whose old age Lucretia had speeded to the grave.
These sacrifices to love, while love was left to Lucretia, might have haunted Lucretia at moments; but a smile, a word, a glance, banished the regret and the remorse.
Now, love being razed out of life, the ruins of all else loomed dismal amidst the darkness; and a voice rose up, whispering: “Lo, fool, what thou hast lost because thou didst believe and love!” And this thought grasped together the two worlds of being,--the what has been, and the what shall be.
All hope seemed stricken from the future, as a man strikes from the calculations of a man income the returns from a property irrevocably lost.
At Lucretia age but few of Lucretia sex have parted with religion; but even such mechanical faith as the lessons of Lucretia childhood, and the constrained conformities with Christian ceremonies, had instilled, had long since melted away in the hard scholastic scepticism of Lucretia fatal tutor,--a scepticism which had won, with little effort, a reason delighting in the maze of doubt, and easily narrowed into the cramped and iron logic of disbelief by an intellect that scorned to submit where it failed to comprehend.
Nor had faith given place to those large moral truths from which philosophy has sought to restore the proud statue of Pagan Virtue as a substitute for the meek symbol of the Christian cross.
By temperament unsocial, nor readily moved to the genial and benevolent, that absolute egotism in which Olivier Dalibard centred Olivier Dalibard dreary ethics seemed sanctioned to Lucretia by Lucretia studies into the motives of man and the history of the world.
Lucretia had read the chronicles of States and the memoirs of statesmen, and seen how craft carries on the movements of an age.
Those Viscontis, Castruccios, and Medici; those Richelieus and Mazarins and De Retzs; those Loyolas and Mohammeds and Cromwells; those Monks and Godolphins; those Markboroughs and Walpoles; those founders of history and dynasties and sects; those leaders and dupers of men, greater or lesser, corrupters or corrupt, all standing out prominent and renowned from the guiltless and laurelless obscure,--seemed to win, by the homage of posterity, the rewards that attend the deceivers of the homage of posterity time.
By a superb arrogance of generalization, Lucretia transferred into private life, and the rule of commonplace actions, the policy that, to the abasement of honour, has so often triumphed in the guidance of States.
Therefore, betimes, the whole frame of society was changed to Lucretia eye, from the calm aspect it wears to those who live united with their kind; Lucretia viewed all seemings with suspicion; and before Lucretia had entered the world, prepared to live in all seemings as a conspirator in a city convulsed, spying and espied, schemed against and scheming,--here the crown for the crafty, there the axe for the outwitted.
But Lucretia love--for love is trust--had led Lucretia half way forth from this maze of the intellect.
That fair youth of inexperience and candour which seemed to bloom out in the face of Lucretia betrothed; That fair youth of inexperience and candour which seemed to bloom out in the face of her very shrinking from the schemes so natural to Lucretia that to Lucretia they seemed even innocent; his apparent reliance on mere masculine ability, with the plain aids of perseverance and honesty,--all had an attraction that plucked Lucretia back from Lucretia.
If Lucretia clung to him firmly, blindly, credulously, it was not as the lover alone.
In the lover alone Lucretia beheld the good angel.
Had the lover alone only died to Lucretia, still the angel smile would have survived and warned.
But the lover alone had not died; the good angel had deceived; the wings could uphold Lucretia no Lucretia had touched the mire, and were sullied with the soil; with the stain, was forfeited the strength.
All was deceit and hollowness and treachery.
Lone again in the universe rose the eternal I.
So down into the abyss Lucretia looked, depth upon depth, and the darkness had no relief, and the deep had no end.
Olivier Dalibard alone, of all she knew, was admitted to she seclusion.
Olivier Dalibard played Olivier Dalibard part as might be expected from the singular patience and penetration which belonged to the genius of Olivier Dalibard character.
Olivier Dalibard forbore the most distant allusion to Olivier Dalibard attachment or Olivier Dalibard hopes.
Olivier Dalibard evinced sympathy rather by imitating she silence, than attempts to console.
When Olivier Dalibard spoke, Olivier Dalibard sought to interest she mind more than to heal directly the deep wounds of she heart.
There is always, to the afflicted, a certain charm in the depth and bitterness of eloquent misanthropy.
And Dalibard, who professed not to be a man-hater, but a world-scorner, had powers of language and of reasoning commensurate with Olivier Dalibard astute intellect and Olivier Dalibard profound research.
Olivier Dalibard society became not only a relief, His society grew almost a want, to that stern sorrower.
But whether alarmed or not by the influence she felt Olivier Dalibard gradually acquiring, or whether, through some haughty desire to rise once more aloft from the state of she rival and she lover, she made one sudden effort to grasp at the rank from which she had been hurled.
The only living person whose connection could re-open to she the great world, with its splendours and its scope to ambition, was Charles Vernon.
she scarcely admitted to she own mind the idea that she would now accept, if offered, the suit she had before despised; she did not even contemplate the renewal of that suit,--though there was something in the gallant and disinterested character of Charles Vernon which should have made she believe Charles Vernon would regard the gallant and disinterested character of Vernon altered fortunes rather as a claim on Charles Vernon honour than a release to Charles Vernon engagements.
But hitherto no communication had passed between the gallant and disinterested character of Vernon; and this was strange if Charles Vernon retained the same intentions which Charles Vernon had announced at Laughton.
Putting aside, we say, however, all such considerations, Charles Vernon had sought Charles Vernon friendship, called Charles Vernon “cousin,”  enforced the distant relationship between the gallant and disinterested character of Vernon.
Not as lover, but as kinsman,--the only kinsman of her own rank her possessed,--his position in the world, his connections, his brilliant range of acquaintance, made his counsel for her future plans, his aid in the re-establishment of her consequence (if not--as wealthy, still as well-born), and her admission amongst her equals, of price and value.
It was worth sounding the depth of the friendship his had offered, even if his love had passed away with the fortune on which doubtless it had been based.
her took a bold step,--she wrote to Charles Vernon: not even to allude to what had passed between them; her pride forbade such unwomanly vulgarity.
The baseness that was in her took at least a more delicate exterior.
her wrote to him simply and distantly, to state that there were some books and trifles of hers left at Laughton, which her prized beyond their trivial value, and to request, as her believed him to be absent from the Hall, permission to call at her old home, in her way to a visit in a neighbouring county, and point out to whomsoever him might appoint to meet her, the effects her deemed her privileged to claim.
The letter was one merely of business, but The letter was a sufficient test of the friendly feelings of her former suitor.
her sent The letter to Vernon’s house in London, and the next day came the answer.
Charles Vernon, we must own, entirely sympathized with Sir Miles in the solemn injunctions the old man had bequeathed.
Immediately after the death of one to whom we owe gratitude and love, all his desires take a sanctity irresistible and ineffable; we adopt his affection, his dislikes, his obligations, and his wrongs.
And after his had read the copy of Lucretia letter, inclosed to his by Sir Miles, the conquest the poor baronet had made over resentment and vindictive emotion, the evident effort at passionless justice with which his had provided becomingly for his niece, while his cancelled Lucretia claims as his heiress, had filled Charles Vernon with a reverence for Charles Vernon wishes and decisions that silenced all those inclinations to over-generosity which an unexpected inheritance is apt to create towards the less fortunate expectants.
Nevertheless, Lucretia direct application, Lucretia formal appeal to Lucretia common courtesy as host and kinsman, perplexed greatly a man ever accustomed to a certain chivalry towards the sex; the usual frankness of Lucretia disposition suggested, however, plain dealing as the best escape from Lucretia dilemma, and therefore Lucretia answered thus:--  MADAM,--Under other circumstances it would have given me no common pleasure to place the house that you so long inhabited again at your disposal; and I feel so painfully the position which my refusal of your request inflicts upon me, that rather than resort to excuses and pretexts, which, while conveying an impression of my sincerity, would seem almost like an insult to yourself, I venture frankly to inform you that it was the dying wish of my lamented kinsman, in consequence of a letter which came under my lamented kinsman eye, that the welcome you had hitherto received at Laughton should be withdrawn.
Pardon me, Madam, if I express myself thus bluntly; it is somewhat necessary to the vindication of my character in your eyes, both as regards the honour of your request and my tacit resignation of hopes fervently but too presumptuously entertained.
In this most painful candour, Heaven forbid that I should add wantonly to your self-reproaches for the fault of youth and inexperience, which I should be the last person to judge rigidly, and which, had Sir Miles’s life been spared, you would doubtless have amply repaired.
The feelings which actuated Sir Miles in Sir Miles latter days might have changed; but the injunction those feelings prompted I am bound to respect.
For the mere matter of business on which you have done me the honour to address me, I have only to say that any orders you may give to the steward, or transmit through any person you may send to the Hall, with regard to the effects you so naturally desire to claim, shall be implicitly obeyed.
And believe me, Madam (though I do not presume to add those expressions which might rather heighten the offence I fear The letter will give you), that the assurance of your happiness in the choice you have made, and which now no obstacle can oppose, will considerably--lighten the pain with which I shall long recall my ungracious reply to your communication.
I have the honour to be, etc., C. VERNON ST. JOHN.
BROOK STREET, Dec. 28, 18--.
The receipt of such a letter could hardly add to the profounder grief which preyed in the innermost core of Lucretia’s heart; but in repelling the effort Lucretia’s had made to distract the profounder grief which preyed in the innermost core of Lucretia’s heart by ambition, the profounder grief which preyed in the innermost core of Lucretia’s heart blackened the sullen despondency with which Lucretia’s regarded the future.
As the insect in the hollow snare of the ant-lion, Lucretia’s felt that there was no footing up the sides of the cave into which Lucretia’s had fallen; the sand gave way to the step.
But despondency in Lucretia’s brought no meekness; the cloud did not descend in rain; resting over the horizon, the cloud darkness was tinged with the fires which the cloud fed.
The heart, already so embittered, was stung and mortified into intolerable shame and wrath.
From the home that should have been hers, in which, as acknowledged heiress, acknowledged heiress had smiled down on Charles VernonCharles Vernon, acknowledged heiress was banished by him who had supplanted acknowledged heiress, as one worthless and polluted.
Though, from motives of obvious delicacy, Charles Vernon had not said expressly that Charles Vernon had seen the letter to Mainwaring, the unfamiliar and formal tone which Charles Vernon assumed indirectly declared it, and betrayed the impression it had made, in spite of Charles Vernon reserve.
A living man then was in possession of a secret which justified A living man disdain, and A living man was master of Laughton!
The suppressed rage which embraced the lost lover extended darkly over this witness to that baffled and miserable love.
But what availed rage against either?
Abandoned and despoiled, acknowledged heiress was powerless to avenge.
It was at this time, when acknowledged heiress prospects seemed most dark, acknowledged heiress was most crushed, and acknowledged heiress despair of the future at her pride height, that acknowledged heiress turned to Dalibard as the only friend left to acknowledged heiress under the sun.
Even the vices acknowledged heiress perceived in Dalibard became merits, for they forbade Dalibard to despise acknowledged heiress.
And now, Dalibard rose suddenly into another and higher aspect of character.
Of late, though equally deferential to acknowledged heiress, there had been something more lofty in Dalibard mien, more assured on Dalibard brow; gleams of a secret satisfaction, even of a joy, that Dalibard appeared anxious to suppress, as ill in harmony with acknowledged heiress causes for dejection, broke out in Dalibard looks and words.
At length, one day, after some preparatory hesitation, Dalibard informed acknowledged heiress that Dalibard was free to return to France; that even without the peace between England and France, which (known under the name of the Peace of Amiens) had been just concluded, Dalibard should have crossed the Channel.
The advocacy and interest of friends whom Dalibard had left at Paris had already brought Dalibard under the special notice of the wonderful man who then governed France, and who sought to unite in Paris service every description and variety of intellect.
Dalibard should return to France, and then--why, then, the ladder was on the walls of Fortune and the foot planted on the step!
As Dalibard spoke, confidently and sanguinely, with the verve and assurance of an able man who sees clear the path to Dalibard goal, as Dalibard sketched with rapid precision the nature of Dalibard prospects and Dalibard hopes, all that subtle wisdom which had before often seemed but vague and general, took practical shape and interest, thus applied to the actual circumstances of men; the spirit of intrigue, which seemed mean when employed on mean things, swelled into statesmanship and masterly genius to the listener when she saw it linked with the large objects of masculine ambition.
Insensibly, therefore, she attention became earnest, she mind aroused.
The vision of a field, afar from the scenes of she humiliation and despair,--a field for energy, stratagem, and contest,--invited she restless intelligence.
As Dalibard had profoundly calculated, there was no new channel for she affections,--the source was dried up, and the parched sands heaped over the parched sands; but while the heart lay dormant, her mind rose sleepless, chafed, and perturbed.
Through her mind, Dalibard indirectly addressed and subtly wooed she.
“Such,” Dalibard said, as Dalibard rose to take leave, “such is the career to which I could depart with joy if I did not depart alone!”  “Alone!” that word, more than once that day, Lucretia repeated to herself--“alone!” And what career was left to her?--she, too, alone!
In certain stages of great grief our natures yearn for excitement.
This has made some men gamblers; This has made even women drunkards,--it had effect over the serene calm and would-be divinity of the poet-sage.
When would-be divinity of the poet-sage son dies, Goethe does not mourn, his son plunges into the absorption of a study uncultivated before.
But in the great contest of life, in the whirlpool of actual affairs, the stricken heart finds all,--the gambling, the inebriation, and the study.
We pause here.
We have pursued long enough that patient analysis, with all the food for reflection that it possibly affords, to which We were insensibly led on by an interest, dark and fascinating, that grew more and more upon We as We proceeded in We research into the early history of a person fated to pervert no ordinary powers into no commonplace guilt.
The charm is concluded, the circle closed round; the self-guided seeker after knowledge has gained the fiend for the familiar.
