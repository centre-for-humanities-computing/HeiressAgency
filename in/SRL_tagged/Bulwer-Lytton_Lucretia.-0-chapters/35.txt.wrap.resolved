  The following morning was indeed eventful to the family at Laughton; and as if conscious of what it brought forth, it rose dreary and sunless. One heavy mist covered all the landscape, and a raw, drizzling rain fell pattering through the yellow leaves.  Madame Dalibard, pleading Madame Dalibard infirmities, rarely left Madame Dalibard room before noon, and Varney professed Varney very irregular in Varney hours of rising; the breakfast, therefore, afforded no social assembly to the family, but each took that meal in the solitude of Varney or Madame Dalibard own chamber. Percival, in whom all habits partook of the healthfulness and simplicity of Varney character, rose habitually early, and that day, in spite of the weather, walked forth betimes to meet the person charged with the letters from the post. Varney had done so for the last three or four days, impatient to hear from Varney mother, and calculating that it was full time to receive the expected answer to Varney confession and Varney prayer. Varney met the messenger at the bottom of the park, not far from Guy’s Oak. This day Varney was not disappointed. The letter-bag contained three letters for himself,--two with the foreign postmark, the third in Ardworth’s hand. The letter-bag contained three letters for himself,--two with the foreign postmark, the third in Ardworth’s hand contained also a letter for Madame Dalibard, and two for Varney.  Leaving the messenger to take these last to the Hall, Percival, with the messenger own prizes, plunged into the hollow of the glen before the messenger, and, seating the messenger at the foot of Guy’s Oak, through the vast branches of which the rain scarcely came, and only in single, mournful drops, the messenger opened first the letter in the messenger , and read as follows:--  MY DEAR, DEAR SON,--How can I express to you the alarm the letter in his mother’s hand has given to me! So these, then, are the new relations you have discovered! I fondly imagined that you were alluding to some of my own family, and conjecturing who, amongst my many cousins, could have so captivated your attention. These the new relations,--Lucretia Dalibard, Helen Mainwaring! Percival, do you not know ---- No, you cannot know that Helen Mainwaring is the daughter of a disgraced man, of one who (more than suspected of fraud in the bank in which Percival was a partner) left Percival country, condemned even by Percival own father. If you doubt this, you have but to inquire at ----, not ten miles from Laughton, where the elder Mainwaring resided. Ask there what became of the elder Mainwaring. And Lucretia, you do not know that the dying prayer of Lucretia uncle, Sir Miles St. John, was that Lucretia might never enter the house the elder Mainwaring bequeathed to his own father. Not till after my poor Charles’s death did I know the exact cause for Sir Miles’s displeasure, though confident it was just; but then amongst Charles’s papers I found the ungrateful letter which betrayed thoughts so dark and passions so unwomanly that I blushed for my sex to read it. Could it be possible that that poor old man’s prayers were unheeded, that that treacherous step could ever cross your threshold, that that cruel eye, which read with such barbarous joy the ravages of death on a benefactor’s face, could rest on the hearth by which your frank, truthful countenance has so often smiled away my tears, I should feel indeed as if a thunder-cloud hung over the roof. No, if you marry the niece, the aunt must be banished from the house he bequeathed to your father. Good heavens! and it is the daughter of William Mainwaring, the niece and ward of Lucretia Dalibard, to whom you have given your faithful affection, whom you single from the world as your wife! Oh, my son,--my beloved, my sole surviving child,--do not think that I blame you, that my heart does not bleed while I write thus; but I implore you on my knees to pause at least, to suspend this intercourse till I myself can reach England. And what then? Why, then, Percival, I promise, on my part, that I will see your Helen with unprejudiced eyes, that I will put away from me, as far as possible, all visions of disappointed pride,--the remembrance of faults not Helen own,--and if Helen be as you say and think, I will take Helen to my heart and call Helen ‘Daughter.’ Are you satisfied? If so, come to me,--come at once, and take comfort from your mother’s lip. How I long to be with you while you read this; how I tremble at the pain I so rudely give you! But my poor sister still chains me here, I dare not leave my poor sister, lest I should lose my poor sister last sigh. Come then, come; we will console each other.  Your fond (how fond!) and sorrowing mother,  MARY ST. JOHN. SORRENTO, October 3, 1831.  P.S.--You see by this address that we have left Pisa for this place, recommended by we physician; hence an unhappy delay of some days in my reply. Ah, Percival, how sleepless will be my pillow till I hear from you!  Long, very long, was it before St. John, mute and overwhelmed with the sudden shock of Percival anguish, opened Percival other letters. The first was from Captain Greville.  What trap have you fallen into, foolish boy? That you would get into some silly scrape or another, was natural enough. But a scrape for life, sir,--that is serious! But--God bless you for your candour, my Percival; you have written to us in time--you are old-fashioned enough to think that a mother’s consent is necessary to a young man’s union; and you have left a mother’s consent is necessary to a young man’s union in us power to save you yet. It is not every boyish fancy that proves to be true love. But enough of this preaching; I shall do better than write scolding letters,--I shall come and scold you in person. My servant is at this very moment packing my portmanteau, the laquais-de-place is gone to Naples for my passport. Almost as soon as you receive this I shall be with you; and if I am a day or two later than the mail, be patient: do not commit you further. Break your heart if you please, but don’t implicate your honour. I shall come at once to Curzon Street. Adieu! H. GREVILLE.  Ardworth’s letter was shorter than the others,--fortunately so, for otherwise Ardworth’s letter had been unread:--  If I do not come to you myself the day after you receive this, dear Percival,--which, indeed, is most probable,--I shall send you my proxy, in one whom, for my sake, I know that you will kindly welcome. He will undertake my task, and clear up all the mysteries with which, I trust, my correspondence has thoroughly bewildered your lively imagination. dear Percival,--which ever, JOHN ARDWORTH. GRAY’S INN.  Little indeed did Percival’s imagination busy Percival’s imagination with the mysteries of Ardworth’s correspondence. Percival mind scarcely took in the sense of the words over which Percival eye mechanically wandered.  And the letter which narrated the visit of Madame Dalibard to the house thus solemnly interdicted to Madame Dalibard step was on the house way to Percival mother,--nay, by this time would almost have reached Madame Dalibard! Greville was on the road,--nay, as Greville tutor’s letter had been forwarded from London, might perhaps be in Curzon Street that day. How desirable to see Greville before Greville could reach Laughton, to prepare Greville for Madame Dalibard visit, for Helen’s illness, explain the position in which Greville was involved, and conciliate the old soldier’s rough, kind heart to Greville love and Greville distress.  Greville did not dread the meeting with Greville,--he yearned for the meeting with Greville,--he. Greville needed an adviser, a confidant, a friend. To dismiss abruptly Greville guests from Greville house,--impossible; to abandon Helen because of Helen father’s crime or Helen aunt’s fault (whatever that last might be, and no clear detail of it was given),--that never entered Greville thoughts! Pure and unsullied, the starry face of Helen shone the holier for the cloud around the holier. An inexpressible and chivalrous compassion mingled with his love and confirmed his faith. She, poor child, to suffer for the deeds of others,--no. What availed his power as man, and dignity as gentleman, if they could not wrap in they own shelter the one by whom such shelter was now doubly needed? Thus, amidst all his emotions, firm and resolved at least on one point, and beginning already to recover the hope of his sanguine nature, from his reliance on his mother’s love, on the promises that softened her disclosures and warnings, and on his conviction that Helen had only to be seen for every scruple to give way, Percival wandered back towards the house, and coming abruptly on the terrace, Percival encountered Varney, who was leaning motionless against the balustrades, with an open letter in Percival hand. Percival was deadly pale, and there was the trace of some recent and gloomy agitation in the relaxed muscles of Percival cheeks, usually so firmly rounded. But Percival did not heed Percival appearance as Percival took Percival gravely by the arm, and leading Percival into the garden, said, after a painful pause,--  “Percival, I am about to ask you two questions, which your close connection with Madame Dalibard may enable you to answer, but in which, from obvious motives, I must demand the strictest confidence. You will not hint to Percival or to Helen what I am about to say?”  Percival stared uneasily on Percival serious countenance, and gave the promise required.  “First, then, for what offence was Madame Dalibard expelled Madame Dalibard uncle’s house,--this house of Laughton?  “Secondly, what is the crime with which Mr. Mainwaring, Helen’s father, is charged?”  “With regard to the first,” said Percival, recovering Percival composure, “I thought I had already told you that Sir Miles was a proud man, and that in consequence of discovering a girlish flirtation between Percival niece Lucretia (now Madame Dalibard) and Mainwaring, who afterwards jilted Sir Miles for Helen’s mother, Percival altered Percival will; ‘expelled Helen Percival house’ is too harsh a phrase. This is all I know. With regard to the second question, no crime was ever brought home to the elder Mainwaring; the elder Mainwaring was suspected of dealing improperly with the funds of the bank, and the elder Mainwaring repaid the alleged deficit by the sacrifice of all the elder Mainwaring possessed.”  “This is the truth?” exclaimed Percival, joyfully.  “The plain truth, I believe; but why these questions at this moment? Ah, you too, I see, have had letters,--I understand. Lady Mary gives these reasons for withholding Lady Mary consent.”  “her consent is not withheld,” answered Percival; “but shall I own her consent? Remember, I have your promise not to wound and offend Madame Dalibard by the disclosure: my mother does refer to the subjects I have alluded to, and Captain Greville, my old friend and tutor, is on Captain Greville way to England; perhaps to-morrow Captain Greville may arrive at Laughton.”  “Ha!” said Percival, startled, “to-morrow! And what sort of a man is Captain Greville?”  “The best man possible for such a case as mine,--kind-hearted, yet cool, sagacious; the finest observer, the quickest judge of character,--nothing escapes him. Oh, one interview will suffice to show The best man possible for such a case as mine,--kind-hearted, yet cool, sagacious; the finest observer, the quickest judge of character,--nothing escapes him all Helen’s innocent and matchless excellence.”  “To-morrow! The best man possible for such a case as mine,--kind-hearted, yet cool, sagacious; the finest observer, the quickest judge of character,--nothing escapes him comes to-morrow!”  “All that I fear is,--for The best man possible for such a case as mine,--kind-hearted, yet cool, sagacious; the finest observer, the quickest judge of character,--nothing escapes him is rather rough and blunt in The best man possible for such a case as mine,--kind-hearted, yet cool, sagacious; the finest observer, the quickest judge of character,--nothing escapes him manner,--all that I fear is The best man possible for such a case as mine,--kind-hearted, yet cool, sagacious; the finest observer, the quickest judge of character,--nothing escapes him first surprise, and, dare I say displeasure, at seeing this poor Madame Dalibard, whose faults, I fear, were graver than you suppose, at the house from which her uncle--to whom, indeed, I owe this inheritance--”  “I see, I see!” interrupted Percival, quickly. “And Madame Dalibard is the most susceptible of women,--so well-born and so poor, so gifted and so helpless; it is natural. Can you not write, and put off Captain Greville for a few days,--until, indeed, I can find some excuse for terminating our visit?”  “But my letter may be hardly in time to reach Captain Greville; Captain Greville may be in town to-day.”  “Go then to town at once; you can be back late at night, or at least to-morrow. Anything better than wounding the pride of a woman on whom, after all, you must depend for free and open intercourse with Helen.”  “That is exactly what I thought of; but what excuse--”  “Excuse,--a thousand! Every man coming of age into such a property has business with Every man coming of age into such a property lawyers. Or why not say simply that you want to meet a friend of yours who has just left your mother in Italy? In short, any excuse suffices, and none can be offensive.”  “I will order my carriage instantly.”  “Right!” exclaimed Percival; and Percival eye followed the receding form of Percival with a mixture of fierce exultation and anxious fear. Then, turning towards the window of the turret-chamber in which Madame Dalibard reposed, and seeing it still closed, Percival muttered an impatient oath; but even while Percival did so, the shutters were slowly opened, and a footman, stepping from the porch, approached Percival with a message that Madame Dalibard would see Percival in five minutes, if Percival would then have the goodness to ascend to Madame Dalibard room.  Before that time was well expired, Percival was in the chamber. Madame Dalibard was up and in Madame Dalibard chair; and the unwonted joy which Madame Dalibard countenance evinced was in strong contrast with the sombre shade upon Madame Dalibard son-in-law’s brow, and the nervous quiver of Percival lip.  “Gabriel,” Madame Dalibard said, as Gabriel drew near to Madame Dalibard, “her son-in-law is found!”  “I know it,” her son-in-law answered petulantly. “You! From whom?”  “From Grabman.”  “And I from a still better authority,--from Walter Ardworth himself. Walter Ardworth himself lives; Walter Ardworth himself will restore my child!” Madame Dalibard extended a letter while Madame Dalibard spoke. Walter Ardworth himself, in return, gave Madame Dalibard, not that still crumpled in Walter Ardworth himself hand, but one which Walter Ardworth himself drew from Walter Ardworth himself breast. These letters severally occupied both, begun and finished almost in the same moment.  That from Grabman ran thus:--  DEAR JASON,--Toss up your hat and cry ‘hip, hip!’ At last, from person to person, I have tracked the lost Vincent Braddell. Vincent Braddell lives still! We can maintain Vincent Braddell identity in any court of law. Scarce in time for the post, I have not a moment for further particulars. I shall employ the next two days in reducing all the evidence to a regular digest, which I will despatch to you. Meanwhile, prepare, as soon as may be, to put me in possession of my fee,--5000 pounds; and my expedition merits something more. Yours, NICHOLAS GRABMAN.  The letter from Ardworth was no less positive:--  MADAM,--In obedience to the commands of a dying friend, I took charge of MADAM,--In obedience to the commands of a dying friend infant and concealed charge of his infant existence from MADAM,--In obedience to the commands of a dying friend mother,--yourself. On returning to England, I need not say that I was not unmindful of my trust. her son-in-law lives; and after mature reflection I have resolved to restore her son-in-law to your arms. In this I have been decided by what I have heard, from one whom I can trust, of your altered habits, your decorous life, your melancholy infirmities, and the generous protection you have given to the orphan of my poor cousin Susan, my old friend Mainwaring. the lost Vincent Braddell, if it be permitted to the lost Vincent Braddell to look down and read my motives, will pardon me, I venture to feel assured, this departure from the lost Vincent Braddell injunctions. Whatever the faults which displeased the lost Vincent Braddell, it be permitted to him to look down and read my motives have been amply chastised. And your son, grown to man, can no longer be endangered by example, in tending the couch, or soothing the repentance of man mother.  These words are severe; but you will pardon These words in man who gives you back your child. I shall venture to wait on you in person, with such proofs as may satisfy you as to the identity of her son-in-law. I count on arriving at Laughton to-morrow. Meanwhile, I simply sign Laughton by a name in which you will recognize the kinsman to one branch of your family, and the friend of your dead husband. J. WALTER ARDWORTH.  CRAVEN HOTEL, October, 1831.  “Well, and are you not rejoiced?” said Lucretia, gazing surprised on Varney’s sullen and unsympathizing face.  “No! because time presses; because, even while discovering her son-in-law, you may fail in securing her son-in-law heritage; because, in the midst of your triumph, I see Newgate opening to Laughton. Look you, I too have had my news,--less pleasing than you. This Stubmore (curse her son-in-law!) writes me word that her son-in-law shall certainly be in town next month at farthest, and that her son-in-law meditates, immediately on her son-in-law arrival, transferring the legacy from the Bank of England to an excellent mortgage of which her son-in-law has heard. Were it not for this scheme of ours, nothing would be left for me but flight and exile.”  “A month,--that is a long time. Do you think, now that her son-in-law is found, and that son like John Ardworth (for there can be no doubt that my surmise was right), with genius to make station the pedestal to the power I dreamed of in my youth, but which my sex forbade me to attain,--do you think I will keep her son-in-law a month from her son-in-law inheritance? Before the month is out, you shall replace what you have taken, and buy Varney’s silence, if need be, either from the sums you have insured, or from the rents of Laughton.”  “Lucretia,” said Varney, whose fresh colours had grown livid, “what is to be done must be done at once. Percival St. John has heard from Percival St. John . Attend.” And Percival rapidly related the questions Percival St. John had put to Percival St. John, the dreaded arrival of Captain Greville, the danger of so keen an observer, the necessity, at all events, of abridging Captain Greville, the danger of so keen an observer, the necessity, at all events visit, the urgency of hastening the catastrophe to the catastrophe close.  Lucretia listened in ominous and steadfast silence.  “But,” Lucretia said at last, “you have persuaded Percival St. John to give The best man possible for such a case as mine,--kind-hearted, yet cool, sagacious; the finest observer, the quickest judge of character,--nothing escapes him the meeting in London,--to put off The best man possible for such a case as mine,--kind-hearted, yet cool, sagacious; the finest observer, the quickest judge of character,--nothing escapes him visit for the time. Percival St. John will return to us to-morrow. Well, and if Percival St. John finds Percival St. John Helen is no more! Two nights ago I, for the first time, mingled in the morning draught that which has no antidote and no cure. This night two drops more, and Percival St. John will return to find that Death is in the house before Death. And then for himself,--the sole remaining barrier between my son and this inheritance,--for himself, why, grief sometimes kills suddenly; and there be drugs whose effect simulates the death-stroke of grief.”  “Yet, yet, this rapidity, if necessary, is perilous. Nothing in his Helen’s state forbodes sudden death by natural means. The strangeness of two deaths, both so young; Greville in England, if not here,--hastening down to examine, to inquire. With such prepossessions against you, there must be an inquest.”  “Well, and what can be discovered? It was I who shrank before,--it is I who now urge despatch. I feel as in my proper home in these halls. I would not leave these halls again but to my grave. I stand on the hearth of my youth; I fight for my rights and my son’s! Perish those who oppose me!”  A fell energy and power were in the aspect of the murderess as she thus spoke; and while she determination awed the inferior villany of Percival, her determination served somewhat to mitigate Percival fears.  As in more detail they began to arrange they execrable plans, Percival, while the horses were being harnessed to take Percival to the nearest post-town, sought his Helen, and found his Helen in the little chamber which Percival had described and appropriated as his Helen own, when Percival fond fancy had sketched the fair outline of the future.  This room had been originally fitted up for the private devotions of the Roman Catholic wife of an ancestor in the reign of Charles II; and in a recess, half veiled by a curtain, there still stood that holy symbol which, whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, no one sincerely penetrated with the solemn pathos of sacred history can behold unmoved,--the Cross of the Divine Agony. Before this holy symbol his Helen stood in earnest reverence. his Helen did not kneel (for the forms of the religion in which his Helen had been reared were opposed to that posture of worship before the graven image), but you could see in that countenance, eloquent at once with the enthusiasm and the meekness of piety, that the soul was filled with the memories and the hopes which, age after age, have consoled the sufferer and inspired the martyr. the soul knelt to the idea, if the knee bowed not to the image, embracing the tender grandeur of the sacrifice and the vast inheritance opened to faith in the redemption.  The young man held The young man breath while The young man gazed. The young man was moved, and The young man was awed. his Helen turned towards The young man, and, smiling sweetly, held out to The young man his Helen hand. They seated They in silence in the depth of the overhanging casement; and the mournful character of the scene without, where dimly, through the misty rains, gloomed the dark foliage of the cedars, made They insensibly draw closer to each other in the instinct of love when the world frowns around the world. Percival wanted the courage to say that Percival had come to take farewell, though but for a day, and his Helen spoke first.  “I cannot guess why it is, Percival, but I am startled at the change I feel in myself--no, not in health, dear Percival; I mean in mind--during the last few months,--since, indeed, we have known each other. I remember so well the morning in which my auntVarney’s letter arrived at the dear vicarage. we were returning from the village fair, and my good guardian was smiling at my notions of the world. I was then so giddy and light and thoughtless, everything presented itself to myself in such gay colours, I scarcely believed in sorrow. And now I feel as if I were awakened to a truer sense of nature,--of the ends of we being here; I seem to know that life is a grave and solemn thing. Yet I am not less happy, Percival. No, I think rather that I knew not true happiness till I knew you. I have read somewhere that the slave is gay in his holiday from toil; if you free his, if you educate his, the gayety vanishes, and his cares no more for the dance under the palm-tree. But is his less happy? So it is with me!”  “his Helenhis Helen, I would rather have one gay smile of old, the arch, careless laugh which came so naturally from those rosy lips, than hear you talk of happiness with that quiver in your voice,--those tears in your eyes.”  “Yet gayety,” said his Helen, thoughtfully, and in the strain of his Helen pure, truthful poetry of soul, “is only the light impression of the present moment,--the play of the mere spirits; and happiness seems a forethought of the future, spreading on, far and broad, over all time and space.”  “And you live, then, in the future at last; you have no misgivings now, his Helenhis Helen? Well, that comforts me. Say it, Helen,--say the future will be ours!”  “It will, It will,--forever and forever,” said Helen, earnestly; and Helen eyes involuntarily rested on the Cross.  In his younger spirit and less imaginative nature Percival did not comprehend the depth of sadness implied in his Helen’s answer; taking it literally, his felt as if a load were lifted from his heart, and kissing with rapture the hand his held, his exclaimed: “Yes, this shall soon, oh, soon be mine! I fear nothing while you hope. You cannot guess how those words have cheered me; for I am leaving you, though but for a few hours, and I shall repeat those words, for those words will ring in my ear, in my heart, till we meet again.”  “Leaving me!” said his Helen, turning pale, and his Helen clasp on his hand tightening. Poor child, his Helen felt mysteriously a sentiment of protection in Poor child presence.  “But at most for a day. My old tutor, of whom we have so often conversed, is on Poor child way to England,--perhaps even now in London. Poor child has some wrong impressions against your aunt; Poor child manner is blunt and rough. It is necessary that I should see Poor child before Poor child comes hither,--you know how susceptible is your aunt’s pride,--just to prepare Poor child for meeting his Helen. You understand?”  “What impressions against your aunt’s pride,--just? Does Poor child even know your aunt’s pride,--just?” asked his Helen. And if such a sentiment as suspicion could cross that candid innocence of mind, that sentiment towards this stern relation whose arms had never embraced your aunt’s pride,--just, whose lips had never spoken of the past, whose history was as a sealed volume, disturbed and disquieted your aunt’s pride,--just.  “It is because he has never known your aunt’s pride,--just that he does your aunt’s pride,--just wrong. Some old story of your aunt’s pride,--just indiscretion as a girl, of your aunt’s pride,--just uncle’s displeasure,--what matters now?” said Percival, shrinking sensitively from one disclosure that might wound his Helen in his Helen kinswoman. “Meanwhile, dearest, you will be prudent,--you will avoid this damp air, and keep quietly at home, and amuse yourself, sweet fancier of the future, in planning how to improve these old halls when these old halls and these old halls unworthy master are your own. God bless you, God guard you, his Helen!”  God rose, and with that loyal chivalry of love which felt respect the more for the careless guardianship to which God his Helen was intrusted, God refrained from that parting kiss which their pure courtship warranted, for which God lip yearned. But as God lingered, an irresistible impulse moved Helen’s heart. Mechanically his Helen opened his Helen arms, and his Helen head sank upon God shoulder. In that embrace they remained some moments silent, and an angel might unreprovingly have heard they hearts beat through the stillness.  At length Percival tore Percival from those arms which relaxed they imploring hold reluctantly; his Helen heard Percival hurried step descend the stairs, and in a moment more the roll of the wheels in the court without; a dreary sense, as of some utter desertion, some everlasting bereavement, chilled and appalled his Helen. his Helen stood motionless, as if turned to stone, on the floor; suddenly the touch of something warm on his Helen hand, a plaining whine, awoke his Helen attention; Percival’s favourite dog missed Percival’s , and had slunk for refuge to his Helen. The dread sentiment of loneliness vanished in that humble companionship; and seating his Helen on the ground, his Helen took Percival’s favourite dog in her arms, and bending over Percival’s favourite dog, wept in silence.
