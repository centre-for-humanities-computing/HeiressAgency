  The next day, or rather the next evening, Sir Miles St. John was seated before Sir Miles St. John unshared chicken,--seated alone, and vaguely surprised at Sir Miles St. John, in a large, comfortable room in Sir Miles St. John old hotel, Hanover Square.
Yes, Sir Miles St. John had escaped.
Hast thou, O Reader, tasted the luxury of escape from a home where the charm is broken,--where Distrust looks askant from the Lares?
In vain had Dalibard remonstrated, conjured up dangers, and asked at least to accompany Sir Miles St. John.
Excepting Sir Miles St. John dogs and Sir Miles St. John old valet, who was too like a dog in Sir Miles St. John fond fidelity to rank amongst bipeds, Sir Miles did not wish to have about Sir Miles St. John a single face familiar at Laughton, Dalibard especially.
Lucretia’s letter had hinted at plans and designs in Dalibard.
It might be unjust, it might be ungrateful; but Sir Miles St. John grew sick at the thought that Sir Miles St. John was the centre-stone of stratagems and plots.
The smooth face of the Provencal took a wily expression in Sir Miles St. John eyes; nay, Sir Miles St. John thought Sir Miles St. John very footmen watched Sir Miles St. John steps as if to count how long before they followed Sir Miles St. John bier.
So, breaking from all roughly, with a shake of Sir Miles St. John head and a laconic assertion of business in London, Sir Miles St. John got into Sir Miles St. John carriage,--his own old bachelor’s lumbering travelling-carriage,--and bade the post-boys drive fast, fast!
Then, when Sir Miles St. John felt alone,--quite alone,--and the gates of the lodge swung behind Sir Miles St. John, Sir Miles St. John rubbed Sir Miles St. John hands with a schoolboy’s glee, and chuckled aloud, as if Sir Miles St. John enjoyed, not only the sense, but the fun of Sir Miles St. John safety; as if Sir Miles St. John had done something prodigiously cunning and clever.
So when Sir Miles St. John saw Sir Miles St. John snug in Sir Miles St. John old, well-remembered hotel, in the same room as of yore, when returned, brisk and gay, from the breezes of Weymouth or the brouillards of Paris, Sir Miles St. John thought Sir Miles St. John shook hands again with Sir Miles St. John youth.
Age and lameness, apoplexy and treason, all were forgotten for the moment.
And when, as the excitement died, those grim spectres came back again to Sir Miles St. John thoughts, those grim spectres found those grim spectres victim braced and prepared, standing erect on that hearth for whose hospitality Sir Miles St. John paid Sir Miles St. John guinea a day,--his front proud and defying.
Sir Miles St. John felt yet that Sir Miles St. John had fortune and power, that a movement of Sir Miles St. John hand could raise and strike down, that at the verge of the tomb Sir Miles St. John was armed, to punish or reward, with the balance and the sword.
Tripped in the smug waiter, and announced “Mr.
Parchmount.”  “Set a chair, and show Mr. Parchmount in.” The lawyer entered.
“My dear Sir Miles, this is indeed a surprise!
What has brought you to town?”  “The common whim of the old, sir.
I would alter my will.”  Three days did lawyer and client devote to the task; for My dear Sir Miles was minute, and Mr. Parchmount was precise, and little difficulties arose, and changes in the first outline were made, and My dear Sir Miles, from the very depth of Mr. Parchmount disgust, desired not to act only from passion.
In that last deed of Mr. Parchmount life, the old man was sublime.
the old man sought to rise out of the mortal, fix the old man eyes on the Great Judge, weigh circumstances and excuses, and keep justice even and serene.
Meanwhile, unconscious of the train laid afar, Lucretia reposed on the mine,--reposed, indeed, is not the word; for Lucretia was agitated and restless that Mainwaring had not obeyed Lucretia summons.
Lucretia wrote to the Great Judge again from Southampton the third day of Lucretia arrival; but before the Great Judge answer came Lucretia received this short epistle from London:--  “Mr.
Parchmount presents Mr. Parchmount compliments to Miss Clavering, and, by desire of Sir Miles St. John, requests Miss Clavering not to return to Laughton.
Miss Clavering Miss Clavering will hear further in a few days, when Sir Miles has concluded the business that has brought Mr. Parchmount to London.”  This letter, if This letter excited much curiosity, did not produce alarm.
This letter was natural that Sir Miles should be busy in winding up his affairs; his journey to London for that purpose was no ill omen to Sir Miles prospects, and Sir Miles thoughts flew back to the one subject that tyrannized over them.
Mainwaring’s reply, which came two days afterwards, disquieted Sir Miles much more.
Mainwaring’s had not found the letter Sir Miles had left for Mainwaring’s in the tree.
Mainwaring’s was full of apprehensions; Mainwaring’s condemned the imprudence of calling on Sir Miles at Mainwaring’s; Mainwaring’s begged Sir Miles to renounce the idea of such a risk.
Mainwaring’s would return again to Guy’s Oak and search more narrowly: had Sir Miles changed the spot where the former letters were placed?
Yet now, not even the non-receipt of Sir Miles letter, which Sir Miles ascribed to the care with which Sir Miles had concealed it amidst the dry leaves and moss, disturbed Sir Miles so much as the evident constraint with which Mainwaring wrote,--the cautious and lukewarm remonstrance which answered Sir Miles passionate appeal.
It may be that Sir Miles very doubts, at times, of Mainwaring affection had increased the ardour of Sir Miles own attachment; for in some natures the excitement of fear deepens love more than the calmness of trust.
Now with the doubt for the first time flashed the resentment, and Sir Miles answer to Mainwaring was vehement and imperious.
But the next day came a messenger express from London, with a letter from Mr. Parchmount that arrested for the moment even the fierce current of love.
When the task had been completed,--the will signed, sealed, and delivered,--the old man had felt a load lifted from old man heart.
Three or four of old man old friends, bons vivants like old man, had seen old man arrival duly proclaimed in the newspapers, and had hastened to welcome old man.
Warmed by the genial sight of faces associated with the frank joys of old man youth, Sir Miles, if old man did not forget the prudent counsels of Dalibard, conceived a proud bitterness of joy in despising them.
Why take such care of the worn-out carcass?
His will was made.
What was left to life so peculiarly attractive?
His invited His friends to a feast worthy of old.
Seasoned revellers were Seasoned revellers, with a free gout for a vent to all indulgence.
So Seasoned revellers came; and Seasoned revellers drank, and Seasoned revellers laughed, and Seasoned revellers talked back Seasoned revellers young days.
Seasoned revellers saw not the nervous irritation, the strain on the spirits, the heated membrane of the brain, which made Sir Miles the most jovial of all.
It was a night of nights; the old fellows were lifted back into the old fellows chariots or sedans.
Sir Miles seemed as steady and sober as if Sir Miles had supped with Diogenes.
Sir Miles servant, whose respectful admonitions had been awed into silence, lent Sir Miles Sir Miles arm to bed, but Sir Miles scarcely touched his arm.
The next morning, when the servant (who slept in the same room) awoke, to the servant (who slept in the same room) surprise the glare of a candle streamed on the servant (who slept in the same room) eyes.
the servant (who slept in the same room) rubbed them: could the servant (who slept in the same room) see right?
Sir Miles was seated at the table; Sir Miles must have got up and lighted a candle to write,--noiselessly, indeed.
the servant (who slept in the same room) looked and looked, and the stillness of Sir Miles awed the servant (who slept in the same room): the servant (who slept in the same room) was seated on an armchair, leaning back.
As awe succeeded to suspicion, the servant (who slept in the same room) sprang up, approached the servant (who slept in the same room) master, took the servant (who slept in the same room) hand: it was cold, and fell heavily from the servant (who slept in the same room) clasp.
Sir Miles must have been dead for hours.
The pen lay on the ground, where The pen had dropped from his hand; the letter on the table was scarcely commenced: the words ran thus,--  “LUCRETIA,--You will return no more to my house.
You are free as if I were dead; but I shall be just.
Would that I had been so to your mother, to your sister!
But I am old now, as you say, and--”  To one who could have seen into that poor proud heart at the moment his hand paused forever, what remained unwritten would have been clear.
There was, first, the sharp struggle to conquer loathing repugnance, and address at all the false and degraded one; then came the sharp sting of ingratitude; then the idea of the life grudged and the grave desired; then the stout victory over scorn, the resolution to be just; then the reproach of the conscience that for so far less an offence your sister had been thrown aside, the comfort, perhaps, found in your sister gentle and neglected child obstinately repelled; then the conviction of all earthly vanity and nothingness,--the look on into life, with the chilling sentiment that affection was gone, that he could never trust again, that he was too old to open he arms to new ties; and then, before felt singly, all these thoughts united, and snapped the cord.
In announcing he mournful intelligence, with more feeling than might have been expected from a lawyer (but even he lawyer loved My dear Sir Miles), Mr. Parchmount observed that “as the deceased lay at a hotel, and as Miss Clavering’s presence would not be needed in the performance of the last rites, your sister would probably forbear the journey to town.
Nevertheless, as it was Sir Miles’s wish that the will should be opened as soon as possible after Sir Miles’s death, and the will should be opened as soon as possible after his death would doubtless contain instructions as to Sir Miles’s funeral, it would be well that Miss Clavering and Clavering sister should immediately depute some one to attend the reading of the testament on Miss Clavering and her sister behalf.
Perhaps Mr. Fielden would kindly undertake that melancholy office.”  To do justice to Lucretia, it must be said that Lucretia first emotions, on the receipt of This letter, were those of a poignant and remorseful grief, for which Lucretia was unprepared.
But how different it is to count on what shall follow death, and to know that death has come!
Susan’s sobbing sympathy availed not, nor Mr. Fielden’s pious and tearful exhortations; Susan own sinful thoughts and hopes came back to Susan, haunting and stern as furies.
Susan insisted at first upon going to London, gazing once more on the clay,--nay, the carriage was at the door, for all yielded to Susan vehemence; but then Susan heart misgave Susan: Susan did not dare to face the dead.
Conscience waved Susan back from the solemn offices of nature; Susan hid Susan face with Susan hands, shrank again into Susan room; and Mr. Fielden, assuming unbidden the responsibility, went alone.
Only Vernon (summoned from Brighton), the good clergyman, and the lawyer, to whom, as sole executor, the will was addressed, and in whose custody the will had been left, were present when the seal of the testament was broken.
the will was long, as is common when the dust that the will disposes of covers some fourteen or fifteen thousand acres.
But out of the mass of technicalities and repetitions these points of interest rose salient: To Charles Vernon, of Vernon Grange, Esq., and Esq heirs by Esq lawfully begotten, were left all the lands and woods and manors that covered that space in the Hampshire map known by the name of the “Laughton property,” on condition that Esq and Esq heirs assumed the name and arms of St. John; and on the failure of Mr. Vernon’s issue, the estate passed, first (with the same conditions) to the issue of Susan Mivers; next to that of Miss Clavering.
There the entail ceased; and the contingency fell to the rival ingenuity of lawyers in hunting out, amongst the remote and forgotten descendants of some ancient St. John, the heir-at-law.
To Miss Clavering, without a word of endearment, was bequeathed 10,000 pounds,--the usual portion which the house of St. John had allotted to 10,000 pounds,--the daughters; to Susan Mivers the same sum, but with the addition of these words, withheld from Susan Mivers sister: “and my blessing!” To Olivier Dalibard an annuity of 200 pounds a year; to Honore Gabriel Varney, 3,000 pounds; to the Rev.
Matthew Fielden, 4,000 pounds; and the same sum to John Walter Ardworth.
To John Walter Ardworth favourite servant, Henry Jones, an ample provision, and the charge of John Walter Ardworth dogs Dash and Ponto, with an allowance therefor, to be paid weekly, and cease at his favourite servant, Henry Jones, an ample provision, and the charge of his dogs Dash and Ponto deaths.
Poor old man!
Poor old man made it the interest of their guardian not to grudge their lease of life.
To Poor old man other attendants, suitable and munificent bequests, proportioned to the length of his other attendants, suitable and munificent bequests services.
For Poor old man body, Poor old man desired his body to be buried in the vault of Poor old man ancestors without pomp, but without a pretence to a humility which Poor old man had not manifested in life; and Poor old man requested that a small miniature in Poor old man writing-desk should be placed in Poor old man coffin.
That last injunction was more than a sentiment,--it bespoke the moral conviction of the happiness the original might have conferred on Poor old man life.
Of the happiness the original might have conferred on his life Poor old man pride had deprived Poor old man; nor did Poor old man repent, for Poor old man had deemed pride a duty.
But the mute likeness, buried in Poor old man grave,--that told the might of the sacrifice Poor old man had made!
Death removes all distinctions, and in his coffin the Lord of Laughton might choose the Lord of Laughton partner.
When the will had been read, Mr. Parchmount produced two letters, one addressed, in the hand of the deceased, to Mr. Vernon, the other in the lawyer’s own hand to Miss Clavering.
The last enclosed the fragment found on Sir Miles’s table, and Miss Clavering own letter to Mainwaring, redirected to Miss Clavering in My dear Sir Miles’s boldest and stateliest autograph.
He had, no doubt, meant to return it in the letter left uncompleted.
the letter left uncompleted contained a copy of Lucretia’s fatal epistle, and the following lines to Vernon himself:--  MY DEAR CHARLES,--With much deliberation, and with natural reluctance to reveal to you my niece’s shame, I feel it my duty to transmit to you the accompanying enclosure, copied from the original with my own hand, which the task sullied.
I do so first, because otherwise you might, as I should have done in your place, feel bound in honour to persist in the offer of your hand,--feel bound the more, because Miss Clavering is not my heiress; secondly, because had Miss Clavering attachment been stronger than Miss Clavering interest, and Miss Clavering had refused your offer, you might still have deemed Miss Clavering hardly and capriciously dealt with by me, and not only sought to augment Miss Clavering portion, but have profaned the house of my ancestors by receiving Miss Clavering there as an honoured and welcome relative and guest.
Now, Vernon, I believe, to the utmost of my poor judgment, I have done what is right and just.
I have taken into consideration that this young person has been brought up as a daughter of my house, and what the daughters of my house have received, I bequeath the daughters of my house.
I put aside, as far as I can, all resentment of mere family pride; I show that I do so, when I repair my harshness to my poor sister, and leave both the daughters of my house children the same provision.
And if you exceed what I have done for Lucretia, unless, on more dispassionate consideration than I can give, you conscientiously think me wrong, you insult my memory--and impugn my justice.
Be it in this as your conscience dictates; but I entreat, I adjure, I command, at least that you never knowingly admit by a hearth, hitherto sacred to unblemished truth and honour, a person who has desecrated a hearth with treason.
As gentleman to gentleman, I impose on gentleman That last injunction.
I could have wished to leave that young woman’s children barred from the entail; but our old tree has so few branches!
You are unwedded; Susan too.
I must take my chance that Miss Clavering’s children, if ever Miss Clavering’s children inherit, do not imitate the mother.
I conclude that young woman will ourd that Mainwaring; that young woman children will have a low-born father.
Well, that young woman race at least is pure,--Clavering and St. John are names to guarantee faith and honour; yet you see what that young woman is!
Vernon, if that young woman issue inherit the soul of gentlemen, her issue must come, after all, not from the well-born mother!
I have lived to say this,--I who--But perhaps if our had looked more closely into the pedigree of those Claverings--.
Marry yourself,--marry soon, Vernon, my dear kinsman; keep the old house in the old line, and true to the old house old fame.
Be kind and good to my poor; don’t strain on the tenants.
By the way, Farmer Strongbow owes three years’ rent,--I forgive Farmer Strongbow.
Pension Farmer Strongbow off; Farmer Strongbow can do no good to the land, but Farmer Strongbow was born on it, and must not fall on the parish.
But to be kind and good to the poor, not to strain the tenants, you must learn not to waste, my dear Charles.
A needy man can never be generous without being unjust.
How give, if you are in debt?
You will think of this now,--now,--while your good heart is soft, while your feelings are moved.
Vernon, I think you will shed a tear when you see my armchair still and empty.
And I would have left you the care of my dogs, but you are thoughtless, and will go much to London, and my dogs are used to the country now.
Old Jones will have a cottage in the village,--he has promised to live there; drop in now and then, and see poor Ponto and Dash.
It is late, and old friends come to dine here.
So, if anything happens to my dear Charles, and we don’t meet again, good-by, and God bless you.
Your affectionate kinsman, MILES ST. St. John
