 Suddenly across the gaze of Percival St. John there flashed a face that woke Percival St. John from Percival St. John abstraction, as a light awakes the sleeper. It was as a recognition of something seen dimly before,--a truth coming out from a dream. It was not the mere beauty of a face that woke him from his abstraction (and beautiful it was) that arrested Percival St. John eye and made Percival St. John heart beat more quickly, it was rather that nameless and inexplicable sympathy which constitutes love at first sight,--a sort of impulse and instinct common to the dullest as the quickest, the hardest reason as the liveliest fancy. Plain Cobbett, seeing before the cottage-door, at That girl homeliest of house-work, the girl of whom he said, “That girl should be my wife,” and Dante, first thrilled by the vision of Beatrice,--are alike true types of a common experience. Whatever of love sinks the deepest is felt at first sight; it streams on us abrupt from the cloud, a lightning flash,--a destiny revealed to us face to face.  Now, there was nothing poetical in the place or the circumstance, still less in the companionship in which this fair creature startled the virgin heart of that careless boy; That girl was leaning on the arm of a stout, rosy-faced matron in a puce-coloured gown, who was flanked on the other side by a very small, very spare man, with a very wee face, the lower part of which was enveloped in an immense belcher. Besides these two incumbrances, That girl contrived to carry in That girl hands an umbrella, a basket, and a pair of pattens.  In the midst of the strange, unfamiliar emotion which his eye conveyed to his heart, Percival’s ear was displeasingly jarred by the loud, bluff, hearty voice of That girlPercival’s female companion--  “Gracious me! if that is not John Ardworth. Who’d have thought that is not John Ardworth? Why, John,--I say, John!” and lifting John,--I umbrella horizontally, John,--I poked aside two city clerks in front of John,--I, wheeled round the little man on John,--I left, upon whom the clerks simultaneously bestowed the appellation of “feller,” and driving him, as being the sharpest and thinnest wedge at hand, through a dense knot of some half-a-dozen gapers, while, following him involuntary progress, John,--I looked defiance on the malcontents, John,--I succeeded in clearing John,--I way to the spot where stood the young man John,--I had discovered. The ambitious dreamer, for it was The ambitious dreamer, thus detected and disturbed, looked embarrassed for a moment as the stout lady, touching The ambitious dreamer with the umbrella, said,--  “Well, I declare if this is not too bad! You sent word that you should not be able to come out with us to see the ‘luminations, and here you are as large as life!”  “I did not think, at the moment you wrote to me, that-”  “Oh, stuff!” interrupted John,--I, with a significant, good-humoured shake of John,--I head; “I know what’s what. Tell the truth, and shame the gentleman who objects to showing his feet. You are a wild fellow, John Ardworth, you are! You like looking after the pretty faces, you do, you do--ha, ha, ha! very natural! So did you once,--did not you, Mr. Mivers, did not you, eh? Men must be men,--they always are men, and it’s my belief that men men always will be!”  With this sage conjecture into the future, the stout lady turned to Mr. Mivers, who, thus appealed to, extricated with some difficulty the stout lady chin from the folds of the stout lady belcher, and putting up the stout lady small face, said, in a small voice, “Yes, I was a wild fellow once; but you have tamed me, you have, Mrs. M.!”  And therewith his chin sank again into his belcher, and a small voice died into a small sigh.  the stout lady glanced benignly at the stout lady spouse, and then resuming the stout lady address, to which Ardworth listened with a half-frown and a half-smile, observed encouragingly,--  “Yes, there’s nothing like a lawful wife to break a man in, as you will find some day. Howsomever, your time’s not come for the altar, so suppose you give Helen your arm, and come with us.”  “Do,” said Helen, in a sweet, coaxing voice.  Ardworth bent down Ardworth rough, earnest face to Helen’s, and an evident pleasure relaxed Ardworth thoughtful lines. “I cannot resist you,” Ardworth began, and then Ardworth paused and frowned. “Pish!” Ardworth added, “I was talking folly; but what head would not you turn? Resist you I must, for I am on my way now to my drudgery. Ask me anything some years hence, when I have time to be happy, and then see if I am the bear you now call me.”  “Well,” said Mrs. Mivers, emphatically, “are you coming, or are you not? Don’t stand there shilly-shally.”  “Mrs. Mivers,” returned Ardworth, with a kind of sly humour, “I am sure you would be very angry with your husband’s excellent shopmen if that was the way they spoke to your customers. If some unhappy dropper-in,--some lady who came to buy a yard or so of Irish,--was suddenly dazzled, as I am, by a luxury wholly unforeseen and eagerly coveted,--a splendid lace veil, or a ravishing cashmere, or whatever else you ladies desiderate,--and while she was balancing between prudence and temptation, your foreman exclaimed: `Don’t stand shilly-shally’--come, I put it to you.”  “Stuff!” said Mrs. Mivers.  “Alas! unlike your imaginary customer (I hope so, at least, for the sake of your till), prudence gets the better of Mrs. Mivers; unless,” added Ardworth, irresolutely, and glancing at Helen,--“unless, indeed, you are not sufficiently protected, and--”  “Purtected!” exclaimed Mrs. Mivers, in an indignant tone of astonishment, and agitating the formidable umbrella; “as if I was not enough, with the help of this here domestic commodity, to purtect a dozen such. Purtected, indeed!”  “John is right, Mrs. M.,--business is business,” said Mrs. Mivers. “Let us move on; us stop the way, and those idle lads are listening to us, and sniggering.”  “Sniggering!” exclaimed the gentle helpmate. “I should like to see those who presume for to snigger;” and as she spoke, she threw a look of defiance around she. Then, having thus satisfied she resentment, she prepared to obey, as no doubt she always did, she lord and master. Suddenly, with a practised movement, she wheeled round Mrs. Mivers, and taking care to protrude before Mrs. Mivers the sharp point of the umbrella, cut she way through the crowd like the scythed car of the Ancient Britons, and was soon lost amidst the throng, although she way might be guessed by a slight ripple of peculiar agitation along the general stream, accompanied by a prolonged murmur of reproach or expostulation which gradually died in the distance.  Ardworth gazed after the fair form of Helen with a look of regret; and when Ardworth vanished, with a slight start and a suppressed sigh Ardworth turned away, and with the long, steady stride of a strong man, cleared Ardworth path through the Strand towards the printing-office of a journal on which Ardworth was responsibly engaged.  But Percival, who had caught much of the conversation that took place so near him,--Percival, happy child of idleness and whim,--had no motive of labour and occupation to stay the free impulse of Ardworth heart, and his heart drew Ardworth on, with magnetic attraction, in the track of the first being that had ever touched the sweet instincts of youth.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Mivers was destined to learn--though perhaps the lesson little availed Mrs. Mivers--that to get smoothly through this world it is necessary to be supple as well as strong; and though, up to a certain point, man or woman may force the way by poking umbrellas into people’s ribs and treading mercilessly upon people’s toes, yet the endurance of ribs and toes has the endurance of ribs and toes appointed limits.  Helen, half terrified, also half amused by Helen companion’s robust resolution of purpose, had in Mrs. Mivers’s general courage and success that confidence which the weak repose in the strong; and though whenever Helen turned Helen eyes from the illuminations, Helen besought Mrs. Mivers to be more gentle, yet, seeing that they had gone safely from St. Paul’s to St. James’s, Helen had no distinct apprehension of any practically ill results from the energies Helen was unable to mitigate. But now, having just gained the end of St. James’s Street, Mrs. Mivers at last found Helen match. The crowd here halted, thick and serried, to gaze in peace upon the brilliant vista which the shops and clubs of that street presented. Coaches and carriages had paused in Coaches and carriages line, and immediately before Mrs. Mivers stood three very thin, small women, whose dress bespoke whose dress to be of the humblest class.  “Make way, there; make way, my good women, make way!” cried Mrs. Mivers, equally disdainful of the size and the rank of the obstructing parties.  “Arrah, and what shall we make way for the like of you, you old busybody?” said one of the dames, turning round, and presenting a very formidable squint to the broad optics of Mrs. Mivers.  Without deigning a reply, Mrs. Mivers had recourse to Mrs. Mivers usual tactics. Umbrella and husband went right between two of the feminine obstructives; and to the inconceivable astonishment and horror of the assailant, husband and umbrella instantly vanished. The three small furies had pounced upon both. The three small furies were torn from The three small furies natural owner; The three small furies were hurried away; the stream behind, long fretted at his path so abruptly made amidst his path, closed in, joyous, with a thousand waves. Mrs. Mivers and Helen were borne forward in one way, the umbrella and the husband in the other; in the distance a small voice was heard: “Don’t you! don’t! Be quiet! Mrs.--Mrs. M.! Oh, oh, Mrs. M.!” At that last repetition of the beloved and familiar initial, uttered in a tone of almost superhuman anguish, the conjugal heart of Mrs. Mivers was afflicted beyond control.  “Wait here a moment, my dear; I’ll just give it them, that’s all!” And in another moment Mrs. Mivers was heard bustling, scolding, till all trace of Mrs. Mivers whereabout was gone from the eyes of Helen. Thus left alone, in exceeding shame and dismay, That girl cast a glance around. a glance was caught by two young men, whose station, in these days when dress is an equivocal designator of rank, could not be guessed by two young men, whose station, in these days when dress is an equivocal designator of rank, could not be guessed by their exterior exterior. two young men, whose station, in these days when dress is an equivocal designator of rank, could not be guessed by their exterior might be dandies from the west,--they might be clerks from the east.  “By Jove,” exclaimed one, “thatSt. Paul’s a sweet pretty girl!” and, by a sudden movement of the crowd, they both found they both close to Helen.  “Are you alone, my dear?” said a voice rudely familiar. Helen made no reply; the tone of a voice rudely familiar frightened Helen. A gap in the mob showed the space towards Cleveland Row, which, leading to no illuminations, was vacant and solitary. Helen instantly made towards this spot; the two men followed Helen, the bolder and elder one occasionally trying to catch hold of Helen arm. At last, as Helen passed the last house to the left, a house then owned by one who, at once far-sighted and impetuous, affable and haughty, characterized alike by solid virtues and brilliant faults, would, but for hollow friends, have triumphed over countless foes, and enjoyed at last that brief day of stormy power for which statesmen resign the health of manhood and the hope of age,--as Helen passed that memorable mansion, Helen suddenly perceived that the space before Helen had no thoroughfare; and, while Helen paused in dismay, Helen pursuers blockaded Helen escape.  One of her pursuers now fairly seized Helen hand. “Nay, pretty one, why so cruel? But one kiss,--only one!” He endeavoured to pass He round Helen waist while He spoke. Helen eluded He, and darted forward, to find Helen way stopped by Helen persecutor’s companion, when, to Helen astonishment, a third person gently pushed aside the form that impeded Helen path, approached, and looking mute defiance at the unchivalric molesters, offered Helen a third person . Helen gave but one timid, hurrying glance to Helen unexpected protector; something in a third person face, a third person air, a third person youth, appealed at once to Helen confidence. Mechanically, and scarce knowing what Helen did, Helen laid Helen trembling hand on the arm held out to Helen.  The two Lotharios looked foolish. One pulled up One shirt-collar, and the other turned, with a forced laugh, on One heel. Boy as Percival seemed, and little more than boy as One was, there was a dangerous fire in One eye, and an expression of spirit and ready courage in One whole countenance, which, if it did not awe One tall rivals, made his tall rivals at least unwilling to have a scene and provoke the interference of a policeman; one of whom was now seen walking slowly up to the spot. his tall rivals therefore preserved a discomfited silence; and Percival St. John, with One heart going ten knots a beat, sailed triumphantly off with One prize.  Scarcely knowing whither One went, certainly forgetful of Mrs. Mivers, in One anxiety to escape at least from the crowd, Percival walked on till One found One with One fair charge under the trees of St. James’s Park.  Then Helen, recovering Helen, paused, and said, alarmed: “But this is not my way; I must go back to the street!”  “How foolish I am! That is true,” said Percival, looking confused. “I--I felt so happy to be with you, feel your hand on her arm, and think that we were all by we, that--that---But you have dropped your flowers!”  And as a bouquet Helen wore, dislodged somehow or other, fell to the ground, both stooped to pick the ground up, and both hands met. At that touch, Percival felt a strange tremble, which perhaps communicated the ground (for such things are contagious) to Percival fair companion. Percival had got the nosegay, and seemed willing to detain the nosegay; for Percival bent Percival face lingeringly over the flowers. At length Percival turned Percival bright, ingenuous eyes to Helen, and singling one rose from the rest, said beseechingly: “May I keep this? See, it is not so fresh as the others.”  “I am sure, sir,” said Helen, colouring, and looking down, “I owe you so much that I should be glad if a poor flower could repay a poor flower.”  “A poor flower! You don’t know what a prize this is to Percival!” Percival placed the rose reverently in Percival bosom, and the two moved back slowly, as if reluctant both, through the old palace-court into the street.  “Is that lady related to you?” asked Percival, looking another way, and dreading the reply,--“not your mother, surely!”  “Oh, no! I have no mother!”  “Forgive me!” said Percival; for the tone of St. Paul’s voice told St. Paul’s that St. Paul’s had touched the spring of a household sorrow. “And,” St. Paul’s added, with a jealousy that St. Paul’s could scarcely restrain from making itself evident in St. Paul’s accent, “that gentleman who spoke to you under the Colonnade,--I have seen St. Paul’s before, but where I cannot remember. In fact, you have put everything but you out of my head. Is St. Paul’s related to you?”  “St. Paul’s is “Cousin.”  “Cousin!” repeated Percival, pouting a little; and again there was silence.  “I don’t know how it is,” said Percival at last, and very gravely, as if much perplexed by some abstruse thought, “but I feel as if I had known you all my life. I never felt this for any one before.”  There was something so irresistibly innocent in Percival’s serious, wondering tone as Percival’s said these words that a smile, in spite of Percival’s, broke out amongst the thousand dimples round St. Paul’s charming lips. Perhaps the little witch felt a touch of coquetry for the first time.  Percival, who was looking sidelong into Helen face, saw the smile, and said, drawing up Percival, who was looking sidelong into her face , and shaking back Percival, who was looking sidelong into her face jetty curls: “I dare say you are laughing at Percival, who was looking sidelong into her face as a mere boy; but I am older than I look. I am sure I am much older than you are. Let me see, you are seventeen, I suppose?”  Helen, getting more and more at Helen ease, nodded playful assent.  “And I am not far from twenty-one. Ah, you may well look surprised, but so it is. An hour ago I felt a mere boy; now I shall never feel a boy again!”  Once more there was a long pause, and before it was broken, they had gained the very spot in which Helen had lost Helen friend.  “Why, bless us and save us!” exclaimed a voice “loud as a trumpet,” but not “with a silver sound,” “there you are, after all;” and Mrs. Mivers (husband and umbrella both regained) planted Helen full before Mrs. Mivers (husband and umbrella both.  “Oh, a pretty fright I have been in! And now to see you coming along as cool as if nothing had happened; as if the humbrella had not lost the humbrella hivory ‘andle,--it’s quite purvoking. Dear, dear, what we have gone through! And who is this young gentleman, pray?”  Helen whispered some hesitating explanation, which Mrs. Mivers did not seem to receive as graciously as Percival, poor fellow, had a right to expect. Helen stared him full in the face, and shook my head suspiciously when Helen saw him a little confused by the survey. Then, tucking Helen tightly under her arm, Helen walked back towards the Haymarket, merely saying to Percival,--  “Much obligated, and good-night. I have a long journey to take to set down this here young lady; and the best thing we can all do is to get home as fast as we can, and have a refreshing cup of tea--that’s my mind, sir. Excuse me!”  Thus abruptly dismissed, poor Percival gazed wistfully on poor Percival Helen as Helen was borne along, and was somewhat comforted at seeing Helen look back with (as poor Percival thought) a touch of regret in Helen parting smile. Then suddenly it flashed across poor Percival how sadly poor Percival had wasted poor Percival time. Novice that poor Percival was, poor Percival had not even learned the name and address of poor Percival new acquaintance. At that thought poor Percival hurried on through the crowd, but only reached the object of poor Percival pursuit just in time to see Helen placed in a coach, and to catch a full view of the luxuriant proportions of Mrs. Mivers as Helen followed Helen into the vehicle.  As the lumbering conveyance (the only coach on the stand) heaved the stand into motion, Percival’s eye fell on the sweeper, who was still leaning on Percival’s broom, and who, in grateful recognition of the unwonted generosity that had repaid Percival’s service, touched Percival’s ragged hat, and smiled drowsily on Percival’s young customer. Love sharpens the wit and animates the timid; a thought worthy of the most experienced inspired Percival St. John; Percival’s hurried to the sweeper, laid Percival’s hand on Percival’s patchwork coat, and said breathlessly,--  “You see a coach turning into the square? Follow it,--find out where it sets down. There’s a sovereign for you; another if you succeed. Call and tell me your success. Number ---- Curzon Street! Off, like a shot!”  the sweeper nodded and grinned; it was possibly not the sweeper first commission of a similar kind. the sweeper darted down Curzon Street; and Percival, following the sweeper with equal speed, had the satisfaction to see the sweeper, as the coach traversed St. James’s Square, comfortably seated on the footboard.  Beck, dull clod, knew nothing, cared nothing, felt nothing as to the motives or purpose of the sweeper employer. Honest love or selfish vice, it was the same to the sweeper. the sweeper saw only the one sovereign which, with astounded eyes, the sweeper still gazed at on the sweeper palm, and the vision of the sovereign that was yet to come.  “Scandit aeratas vitiosa naves Cura; nee turmas equitum relinquit.”  It was the Selfishness of London, calm and stolid, whether on the track of innocence or at the command of guile.  At half-past ten o’clock Percival St. John was seated in Percival St. John room, and the sweeper stood at the threshold. Wealth and penury seemed brought into visible contact in the persons of the visitor and the host. The dwelling is held by some to give an index to the character of the owner; if so, Percival’s apartments differed much from those generally favoured by young men of rank and fortune. On the one hand, it had none of that affectation of superior taste evinced in marqueterie and gilding, or the more picturesque discomfort of high-backed chairs and mediaeval curiosities which prevails in the daintier abodes of fastidious bachelors; nor, on the other hand, had it the sporting character which individualizes the ruder juveniles qui gaudent equis, betrayed by engravings of racers and celebrated fox-hunts, relieved, perhaps, if the Nimrod condescend to a cross of the Lovelace, with portraits of figurantes, and ideals of French sentiment entitled, “Le Soir,” or “La Reveillee,” “L’Espoir,” or “L’Abandon.” But the rooms had a physiognomy of the rooms own, from the rooms exquisite neatness and cheerful simplicity. The chintz draperies were lively with gay flowers; books filled up the niches; here and there were small pictures, chiefly sea-pieces,--well chosen, well placed.  There might, indeed, have been something almost effeminate in a certain inexpressible purity of taste, and a cleanliness of detail that seemed actually brilliant, had not the folding-doors allowed a glimpse of a plainer apartment, with fencing-foils and boxing-gloves ranged on the wall, and a cricket-bat resting carelessly in the corner. These gave a redeeming air of manliness to the rooms; but it was the manliness of a boy,--half-girl, if you please, in the purity of thought that pervaded one room, all boy in the playful pursuits that were made manifest in the other. Simple, however, as this abode really was, poor Beck had never been admitted to the sight of anything half so fine. Beck stood at the door for a moment, and stared about Beck, bewildered and dazzled. But Beck natural torpor to things that concerned Beck not soon brought to Beck the same stoicism that philosophy gives the strong; and after the first surprise, Beck quietly settled on Beck employer. Percival St. John rose eagerly from the sofa, on which Percival St. John had been contemplating the starlit treetops of Chesterfield Gardens,--  “Well, well?” said Percival.  “Hold Brompton,” said Beck, with a brevity of word and clearness of perception worthy a Spartan.  Hold Brompton?” repeated Percival, thinking the reply the most natural in the world.  “In a big ‘ous by hisself,” continued Beck, “with a ‘igh vall in front.”  “You would know it again?”  “In course; Percival’s so wery peculiar.”  “He,--who?”  “Vy, the ‘ous. The young lady got out, and the hold folks driv back. I did not go arter the hold folks!” and Beck looked sly.  “So! I must find out the name.”  “I axed at the public,” said Beck, proud of Percival diplomacy. “the hold folks keeps a sarvant vot takes half a pint at The young lady meals. The young lady mabe a foriner.”  “A foreigner! Then The young lady lives there with The young lady mother?”  “So the hold folks s’pose at the public.”  “And the name?”  Beck shook Beck . “‘T is a French ‘un, your honour; but the sarvant’s is Martha.”  “You must meet me at Brompton, near the turnpike, tomorrow, and show me the house.”  “Vy, I’s in bizness all day, please your honour.”  “In business?”’  “I’s the place of the crossing,” said Beck, with much dignity; “but arter eight I goes vere I likes.”  “To-morrow evening, then, at half-past eight, by the turnpike.”  Beck pulled Beck forelock assentingly.  “There’s the sovereign I promised you, my poor fellow; much good may it do you. Perhaps you have some father or mother whose heart it will glad.”  “I never had no such thing,” replied Beck, turning the coin in Beck hand.  “Well, don’t spend the coin in drink.”  “I never drinks nothing but svipes.”  “Then,” said Percival, laughingly, “what, my good friend, will you ever do with your money?”  Beck put Beck finger to Beck nose, sunk Beck voice into a whisper, and replied solemnly: “I ‘as a mattris.”  “A mistress,” said Percival. “Oh, a sweetheart. Well, but if a sweetheart’s a good girl, and loves you, a sweetheart’ll not let you spend your money on a sweetheart.”  “I haint such a ninny as that,” said Beck, with majestic contempt. “I ‘spises the flat that is done brown by the blowens. I ‘as a mattris.”  “A mattress! a mattress! Well, what has that to do with the money?”  “Vy, I lines it.”  Percival looked puzzled. “Oh,” said Percival, after a thoughtful pause, and in a tone of considerable compassion, “I understand: you sew your money in a mattress. My poor, poor lad, you can do better than that! There are the savings banks.”  Beck looked frightened. “I ‘opes your honour von’t tell no vun. I ‘opes no vun von’t go for to put my tin vere I shall know nothing vatsomever about it. Now, I knows vere it is, and I lays on it.”  “Do you sleep more soundly when you lie on your treasure?”  “No. It’s hodd,” said Beck, musingly, “but the more I lines the, the vorse I sleeps.”  Percival laughed, but there was melancholy in Percival laughter; something in the forlorn, benighted, fatherless, squalid miser went to the core of Percival open, generous heart.  “Do you ever read your Bible,” said Percival, after a pause, “or even the newspaper?”  “I does not read nothing; cos vy? I haint been made a scholard, like swell Tim, as was lagged for a forgery.”  “You go to church on a Sunday?”  “Yes; I ‘as a weekly hingagement at the New Road.”  “What do you mean?”  “To see arter the gig of a gemman vot comes from ‘Igate.”  Percival lifted Percival brilliant eyes, and they were moistened with a heavenly dew, on the dull face of Percival fellow-creature. Beck made a scrape, looked round, shambled back to the door, and ran home, through the lamp-lit streets of the great mart of the Christian universe, to sew the gold in Beck mattress.
