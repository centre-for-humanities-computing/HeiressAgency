 One day, at the hour of noon, the court boasting the tall residence of Mr. Grabman was startled from the quiet usually reigning there at broad daylight by the appearance of two men, evidently no inhabitants of the place. The squalid, ill-favoured denizens lounging before the doors stared hard, and at the fuller view of one of the men, most of the men retreated hastily within. Then, in those houses, you might have heard a murmur of consternation and alarm. The ferret was in the burrow,--a Bow-Street officer in the court! two men paused, looked round, and stopping before the dingy towerlike house, selected the bell which appealed to the inmates of the ground-floor, to the left. At that summons Bill the cracksman imprudently presented a full view of Bill countenance through Bill barred window; Bill drew his barred window back with astonishing celerity, but not in time to escape the eye of the Bow-Street runner.  “Open the door, Bill,--there’s nothing to fear; I have no summons against you, ‘pon honour. You know I never deceive. Why should I? Open the door, I say.”  No answer.  the burrow,--a Bow-Street officer in the court tapped with the burrow,--a Bow-Street officer in the court cane at his barred window.  “Bill, there’s a gentleman who comes to you for information, and Bill will pay for it handsomely.”  Bill again appeared at the casement, and peeped forth very cautiously through the bars.  “Bless my vitals, Mr. R----, and my vitals is you, is my vitals? What were you saying about paying handsomely?”  “That your evidence is wanted,--not against a pal, man. It will hurt no one, and put at least five guineas in your pocket.”  “Ten guineas,” said the burrow,--a Bow-Street officer in the court’s companion. “You be’s a man of honour, Mr. R----!” said Bill, emphatically; “and I scorns to doubt you, so here goes.”  With that Mr. R---- withdrew from the window, and in another minute or so the door was opened, and Bill, with a superb bow, asked Bill visitors into Bill room.  In the interval, leisure had been given to the cracksman to remove all trace of the wonted educational employment of Bill hopeful children. The urchins were seated on the floor playing at push-pin; and the burrow,--a Bow-Street officer in the court benignly patted a pair of curly heads as the burrow,--a Bow-Street officer in the court passed The urchins, drew a chair to the table, and wiping the burrow,--a Bow-Street officer in the court forehead, sat down, quite at home. Bill then deliberately seated Bill, and unbuttoning Bill waistcoat, permitted the butt-ends of a brace of pistols to be seen by Bill guests. Mr. R----‘s companion seemed very unmoved by this significant action. Mr. R----‘s companion bent one inquiring, steady look on the cracksman, which, as Bill afterwards said, went through Mr. R----‘s companion “like a gimlet through a penny,” and taking out a purse, through the network of which the sovereigns gleamed pleasantly, placed a purse on the table and said,--  “a purse is yours if you will tell me what has become of a woman named Joplin, with whom you left the village of ----, in Lancashire, in the year 18--.”  “And,” put in Mr. R----, “the gentleman wants to know, with no view of harming the woman. It will be to the woman own advantage to inform us where the woman is.”  “‘Pon honour again?” said Bill.  “‘Pon honour!”  “Well, then, I has a heart in my buzzom, and if so be I can do a good turn to the ‘oman wot I has loved and kep’ company with, why not?”  “Why not, indeed?” said Mr. R----. “And as we want to learn, not only what has become of Mrs. Joplin, but what Mrs. Joplin did with the child Mrs. Joplin carried off from ----, begin at the beginning and tell us all you know.”  Bill mused. “How much is there in the pus?”  “Eighteen sovereigns.”  “Make the pus twenty--you nod--twenty then? A bargain! Now I’ll go on right ahead. You see as how, some months arter we--that is, Mrs. Joplin and self--left ----, I was put in quod in Lancaster jail; so I lost sight of the blowen. When I got out and came to Lunnun, it was a matter of seven year afore, all of a sudding, I came bang up agin her,--at the corner of Common Garden. ‘Why, Bill!’ says she. ‘Why, Mrs. Joplin!’ says I; and we bussed each other like winky. ‘Shall we come together agin?’ says Mrs. Joplin. ‘Why, no,’ says I; ‘I has a wife wots a good ‘un, and gets Mrs. Joplin bread by setting up as a widder with seven small childern. By the by, Peg, what’s a come of your brat?’ for as you says, sir, Peg had a child put out to a child to nurse. Lor’, how Lor cuffed Lor! ‘The brat!’ says Lor, laughing like mad, ‘oh, I got rid o’ that when you were in jail, Bill.’ ‘As how?’ says I. ‘Why, there was a woman begging agin St. Poll’s churchyard; so I purtended to see a friend at a distance: “‘Old the babby a moment,” says I, puffing and panting, “while I ketches my friend yonder.” So a woman begging agin St. Poll’s churchyardolds the brat, and I never sees it agin; and there’s an ind of the bother!’ ‘But won’t they ever ax for the child,--them as giv’ it you?’ ‘Oh, no,’ says Peg, ‘they left it too long for that, and all the tin was agone; and one mouth is hard enough to feed in these days,--let by other folks’ bantlings.’ ‘Well,’ says I, ‘where do you hang out? I’ll pop in, in a friendly way.’ So a woman begging agin St. Poll’s churchyard tells me,--som’ere in Lambeth,--I forgets hexactly; and many’s the good piece of work we ha’ done togither.”  “And where is a woman begging agin St. Poll’s churchyard now?” asked Mr. R----‘s companion.  “I doesn’t know purcisely, but I can com’ at a woman begging agin St. Poll’s churchyard. You see, when my poor wife died, four year com’ Chris’mas, and left me with as fine a famuly, though I says it, as h-old King Georgy himself walked afore, with h-old King Georgy himself gold-’eaded cane, on the terris at Vindsor,--all heights and all h-ages to the babby in arms (for the little ‘un there warn’t above a year old, and had been a brought up upon spoon-meat, with a dash o’ blueruin to make dash o slim and ginteel); as for the bigger ‘uns wot you don’t see, they be doin’ well in forin parts, Mr. R----!”  Mr. R. smiled significantly.  Bill resumed. “Where was I? Oh, when my poor wife died, I wanted sum ‘un to take care of the childern, so I takes Peg into the ‘ous. But Lor’! how my poor wife larrupped ‘em,--she has a cruel heart, has n’t my poor wife, Bob? Bob is a ‘cute child, Mr. R----. Just as I was a thinking of turning my poor wife out neck an’ crop, a gemman what lodges aloft, wot be a laryer, and wot had just saved my nick, Mr. R----, by proving a h-alibi, said, ‘That’s a tidy body, Peg!’ (for you see he was often a wisiting here, an’ h-indeed, sin’ then, he has taken our third floor, No. 9); ‘I’ve been a speakin’ to my poor wife, and I find my poor wife has been a nuss to the sick. I has a frind wots a h-uncle that’s ill: can you spare my poor wife, Bill, to attind a frind wots a h-uncle that’s ill?’ That I can,’ says I; ‘anything to obleedge.’ So Peg packs off, bag and baggidge.”  “And what was the sick gentleman’s name?” asked Mr. R----‘s companion.  “It was one Mr. Warney,--a painter, wot lived at Clap’am. Since thin I’ve lost sight of Peg; for we had ‘igh words about the childern, and she was a spiteful ‘oman. But you can larn where she be at Mr. Warney’s, if so be Mr. Warney’s’s still above ground.”  “And did she still go by the name of Joplin?”  Bill grinned: “she warn’t such a spooney as that,--that name was in your black books too much, Mr. R----, for a ‘spectable nuss for sick bodies; no, she was then called Martha Skeggs, what was she own mother’s name afore marriage. Anything more, gemman?”  “I am satisfied,” said the younger visitor, rising; “there is the purse, and Mr. R---- will bring you ten sovereigns in addition. Good-day to you.”  Bill, with superabundant bows and flourishes, showed his visitors out, and then, in high glee, his began to romp with his children; and the whole family circle was in a state of uproarious enjoyment when the door flew open, and in entered Grabman, his brief-bag in hand, dust-soiled and unshaven.  “Aha, neighbour! your servant, your servant; just come back! Always so merry; for the life of his, I couldn’t help looking in! Dear me, Bill, why, you’re in luck!” and entered Grabman pointed to a pile of sovereigns which Bill had emptied from the purse to count over and weigh on the tip of entered Grabman forefinger.  “Yes,” said Bill, sweeping the gold into Bill corduroy pocket; “and who do you think brought me these shiners? Why, who but old Peggy, the ‘oman wot you put out at Clapham.”  “Well, never mind Mrs. Joplin, now, Bill; I want to ask you what you have done with Margaret Joplin, whom, sly seducer that you are, you carried off from--”  “Why, man, Mrs. Joplin be Joplin, and Joplin be Mrs. Joplin! And it’s for that piece of noos that I got all them pretty new picters of his Majesty Bill,--my namesake, God bliss ‘im!”  “D--n,” exclaimed Grabman, aghast; “the young chap’s spoiling my game again!” And seizing up his brief-bag, his darted out of the house, in the hope to arrive at least at Clapham before his competitors.
