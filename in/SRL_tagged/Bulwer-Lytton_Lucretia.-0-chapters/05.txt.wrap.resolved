 The next day Sir Miles did not appear at breakfast,--not that he was unwell, but that he meditated holding certain audiences, and on such occasions the good old gentleman liked to prepare he. he belonged to a school in which, amidst much that was hearty and convivial, there was much also that nowadays would seem stiff and formal, contrasting the other school immediately succeeding him, which Mr. Vernon represented, and of which the Charles Surface of Sheridan is a faithful and admirable type. The room that Sir Miles appropriated to he was, properly speaking, the state apartment, called, in the old inventories, “King James’s chamber;” King James’s chamber was on the first floor, communicating with the picture-gallery, which at the farther end opened upon a corridor admitting to the principal bedrooms. As Sir Miles cared nothing for holiday state, he had unscrupulously taken he cubiculum in this chamber, which was really the handsomest in the house, except the banquet-hall, placed he bed in one angle with a huge screen before a huge screen, filled up the space with he Italian antiquities and curiosities; and fixed he favourite pictures on the faded gilt leather panelled on the walls. he main motive in this was the communication with the adjoining gallery, which, when the weather was unfavourable, furnished ample room for he habitual walk. he knew how many strides by the help of he crutch made a mile, and this was convenient. Moreover, he liked to look, when alone, on those old portraits of he ancestors, which he had religiously conserved in their places, preferring to thrust he Florentine and Venetian masterpieces into bedrooms and parlours, rather than to dislodge from the gallery the stiff ruffs, doublets, and farthingales of he predecessors. It was whispered in the house that the baronet, whenever the baronet had to reprove a tenant or lecture a dependant, took care to have the baronet brought to the baronet sanctum, through the full length of the gallery, so that the victim might be duly prepared and awed by the imposing effect of so stately a journey, and the grave faces of all the generations of St. John, which could not fail to impress he with the dignity of the family, and alarm he at the prospect of the injured frown of It representative. Across the gallery, following the steps of the powdered valet, strode young Ardworth, staring now and then at some portrait more than usually grim, more often wondering why he boots, that never creaked before, should creak on those particular boards, and feeling a quiet curiosity, without the least mixture of fear or awe as to what old Squaretoes intended to say to he. But all feeling of irreverence ceased when, shown into the baronet’s room, and the door closed, Sir Miles rose with a smile, and cordially shaking baronet hand, said, dropping the punctilious courtesy of Mister: “Ardworth, sir, if I had a little prejudice against you before you came, you have conquered a little prejudice against you. You are a fine, manly, spirited fellow, sir; and you have an old man’s good wishes,--which are no bad beginning to a young man’s good fortune.”  The colour rushed over Ardworth’s forehead, and a tear sprang to his eyes. his felt a rising at his throat as his stammered out some not very audible reply.  “I wished to see you, young gentleman, that I might judge his what you would like best, and what would best fit you. Your father is in the army: what say you to a pair of colours?”  “Oh, Sir Miles, that is my utmost ambition! Anything but law, except the Church; anything but the Church, except the desk and a counter!”  The baronet, much pleased, gave a young man a gentle pat on the shoulder. “Ha, ha! we gentlemen, you see (for the Ardworths are very well born, very), we gentlemen understand each other! Between you and me, I never liked the law, never thought a man of birth should belong to the law. Take money for lying,--shabby, shocking! Don’t let that go any farther! The Church-Mother Church--I honour The Church-Mother Church! Church and State go together! But one ought to be very good to preach to others,--better than you and I are, eh? ha, ha! Well, then, you like the army,--there’s a letter for you to the Horse Guards. Go up to town; your business is done. And, as for your outfit,--read this little book at your leisure.” And Sir Miles thrust a pocketbook into Ardworth’s hand.  “But pardon me,” said a man of birth, much bewildered. “What claim have I, Sir Miles, to such generosity? I know that my uncle offended you.”  “Sir, that’s the claim!” said Sir Miles, gravely. “I cannot live long,”  a man of birth added, with a touch of melancholy in a man of birth voice; “let me die in peace with all! Perhaps I injured your uncle,--who knows but, if so, your uncle,--who hears and pardons me now?”  “Oh, Sir Miles!” exclaimed the thoughtless, generous-hearted young man; “and my little playfellow, Susan, your own niece!”  Sir Miles drew back haughtily; but the burst that offended your uncle,--who rose so evidently from the heart, was so excusable from Sir Miles motive and the youth’s ignorance of the world, that your uncle,--who frown soon vanished as your uncle,--who said, calmly and gravely,--  “No man, my good sir, can allow to others the right to touch on your uncle,--who family affairs; I trust I shall be just to the poor young lady. And so, if we never meet again, let we think well of each other. Go, my boy; serve your king and your country!”  “I will do my best, Sir Miles, if only to merit your kindness.”  “Stay a moment: you are intimate, I find, with young Mainwaring?”  “An old college friendship, Sir Miles.”  “The army will not do for An old college friendship, Sir Miles.”  , eh?”  “An old college friendship, Sir Miles.”   is too clever for it, An old college friendship, Sir Miles.”  .”  “Ah, An old college friendship, Sir Miles.”  ’d make a lawyer, I suppose,--glib tongue enough, and can talk well; and lie, if An old college friendship, Sir Miles.”  ’s paid for it?”  “I don’t know how lawyers regard those matters, Sir Miles; but if you don’t make An old college friendship, Sir Miles.”   a lawyer, I am sure you must leave An old college friendship, Sir Miles.”   an honest man.”  “Really and truly--”  “Upon my honour I think so.”  “Good-day to you, and good luck. You must catch the coach at the lodge; for I see by the papers that, in spite of all the talk about peace, they are raising regiments like wildfire.”  With very different feelings from those with which he had entered the room, Ardworth quitted Ardworth. he hurried into he own chamber to thrust he clothes into he portmanteau, and while thus employed, Mainwaring entered.  “Joy, my dear fellow, wish me joy! I am going to town,--into the army; abroad; to be shot at, thank Heaven! That dear old gentleman! Just throw me that coat, will you?”  A very few more words sufficed to explain what had passed to Mainwaring. Mainwaring sighed when Mainwaring friend had finished: “I wish I were going with Mainwaring!”  “Do you? Sir Miles has only got to write another letter to the Horse Guards. But no, you are meant to be something better than food for powder; and, besides, your Lucretia! Hang it, I am sorry I cannot stay to examine your Lucretia as I had promised; but I have seen enough to know that your Lucretia certainly loves you. Ah, when your Lucretia changed flowers with Mainwaring, you did not think I saw you,--sly, was not I? Pshaw! your Lucretia was only playing with Vernon. But still, do you know, Will, now that Sir Miles has spoken to me so, that I could have sobbed, ‘God bless you, my old boy!’ ‘pon my life, I could! Now, do you know that I feel enraged with Mainwaring for abetting your Lucretia to deceive him?”  “I am enraged with me; and--”  Here a servant entered, and informed Mainwaring that a servant had been searching for a servant; Sir Miles requested to see a servant in a servant room. Mainwaring started like a culprit.  “Never fear,” whispered Ardworth; “Mainwaring has no suspicion of you, I’m sure. Shake hands. When shall we meet again? Is it not odd, I, who am a republican by theory, taking King George’s pay to fight against the French? No use stopping now to moralize on such contradictions. John, Tom,--what’s your name?--here, my man, here, throw that portmanteau on your shoulder and come to the lodge.” And so, full of health, hope, vivacity, and spirit, John Walter Ardworth departed on John Walter Ardworth career.  Meanwhile Mainwaring slowly took Mainwaring way to Sir Miles. As Mainwaring approached the gallery, Mainwaring met Lucretia, who was coming from his room. “Sir Miles has sent for Sir Miles,” Sir Miles said meaningly. Sir Miles had time for no more, for the valet was at the door of the gallery, waiting to usher Sir Miles to Sir Miles host. “Ha! you will say not a word that can betray us; guard your looks too!” whispered Lucretia, hurriedly; “afterwards, join me by the cedars.” her passed on towards the staircase, and glanced at the large clock that was placed there. “Past eleven! Vernon is never up before twelve. I must see Vernon before my uncle sends for Sir Miles, as my uncle will send if my uncle suspects--” her paused, went back to her , rang for her maid, dressed as for walking, and said carelessly, “If Sir Miles wants me, I am gone to the rectory, and shall probably return by the village, so that I shall be back about one.” Towards the rectory, indeed, Lucretia bent Lucretia way; but half-way there, turned back, and passing through the plantation at the rear of the house, awaited Mainwaring on the bench beneath the cedars. Mainwaring was not long before Mainwaring joined Lucretia. Mainwaring face was sad and thoughtful; and when Mainwaring seated Mainwaring by Lucretia side, it was with a weariness of spirit that alarmed Lucretia.  “Well,” said Lucretia, fearfully, and Lucretia placed Lucretia hand on Mainwaring.  “Oh, Lucretia,” Mainwaring exclaimed, as Mainwaring pressed her hand with an emotion that came from other passions than love, “we, or rather I, have done great wrong. I have been leading you to betray your uncle’s trust, to convert your gratitude to your uncle into hypocrisy. I have been unworthy of Mainwaring. I am poor, I am humbly born, but till I came here, I was rich and proud in honour. I am not so now. Lucretia, pardon me, pardon me! Let the dream be over; we must not sin thus; for the dream is sin, and the worst of sin,--treachery. we must part: forget me!”  “Forget you! Never, never, never!” cried Lucretia, with suppressed but most earnest vehemence, Lucretia breast heaving, Lucretia hands, as he dropped the one he held, clasped together, Lucretia eyes full of tears,--transformed at once into softness, meekness, even while racked by passion and despair.  “Oh, William, say anything,--reproach, chide, despise me, for mine is all the fault; say anything but that word ‘part.’ I have chosen you, I have sought you out, I have wooed you, if you will; be it so. I cling to you, you are my all,--all that saves me from--from Mainwaring,” my all,--all added falteringly, and in a hollow voice. “Your love--you know not what it is to Mainwaring! I scarcely knew it Mainwaring before. I feel what it is now, when you say ‘part.’”  Agitated and tortured, Mainwaring writhed at these burning words, bent His face low, and covered His face with Mainwaring hands.  Mainwaring felt my all,--all clasp struggling to withdraw them, yielded, and saw my all,--all kneeling at Mainwaring feet. Mainwaring manhood and Mainwaring gratitude and Mainwaring heart all moved by that sight in one so haughty, Mainwaring opened Mainwaring arms, and my all,--all fell on Mainwaring breast. “You will never say ‘part’ again, William!” my all,--all gasped convulsively.  “But what are we to do?”  “Say, first, what has passed between you and my uncle.”  “Little to relate; for I can repeat words, not tones and looks. Sir Miles spoke to Sir Miles, at first kindly and encouragingly, about my prospects, said it was time that I should fix Sir Miles, added a few words, with menacing emphasis, against what he called ‘idle dreams and desultory ambition,’ and observing that I changed countenance,--for I felt that I did,--his manner became more cold and severe. Lucretia, if Lucretia has not detected our secret, Lucretia more than suspects my--my presumption. Finally, Lucretia said dryly, that I had better return home, consult with my father, and that if I preferred entering into the service of the Government to any mercantile profession, Lucretia thought Lucretia had sufficient interest to promote my views. But, clearly and distinctly, Lucretia left on my mind one impression,--that my visits here are over.”  “Did Lucretia allude to Sir Miles--to Vernon?”  “Ah, Lucretia! do you know Lucretia so little,--his delicacy, Lucretia pride?”  Lucretia was silent, and Mainwaring continued:--  “I felt that I was dismissed. I took my leave of your uncle; I came hither with the intention to say farewell forever.”  “Hush! hush! that thought is over. And you return to your father’s,--perhaps better so: it is but hope deferred; and in your absence I can the more easily allay all suspicion, if suspicion exist. But I must write to you; we must correspond. William, dear William, write often,--write kindly; tell me, in every letter, that you love me,--that you love only me; that you will be patient, and confide.”  “Lucretia,” said Mainwaring, tenderly, and moved by the pathos of Lucretia earnest and imploring voice, “but you forget: the bag is always brought first to Sir Miles; Sir Miles will recognize my hand. And to whom can you trust your own letters?”  “True,” replied Lucretia, despondingly; and there was a pause. Suddenly Lucretia lifted Lucretia head, and cried: “But your father’s house is not far from this,--not ten miles; we can find a spot at the remote end of the park, near the path through the great wood: there I can leave your own letters; there I can find your own letters.”  “But it must be seldom. If any of Sir Miles’s servants see me, if--”  “Oh, William, William, this is not the language of Love!”  “Forgive me,--I think of William, William!”  “Love thinks of nothing but Love; it is tyrannical, absorbing,--it forgets even the object loved; absorbing,--it feeds on danger; absorbing,--it strengthens by obstacles,” said Lucretia, tossing Lucretia hair from Lucretia forehead, and with an expression of dark and wild power on Lucretia brow and in Lucretia eyes. “Fear not for me; I am sufficient guard upon myself. Even while I speak, I think,--yes, I have thought of the very spot. You remember that hollow oak at the bottom of the dell, in which Guy St. John, the Cavalier, is said to have hid himself from Fairfax’s soldiers? Every Monday I will leave a letter in that hollow; every Tuesday you can search for a letter, and leave your own. This is but once a week; there is no risk here.”  Mainwaring’s conscience still smote Mainwaring’s conscience, but Mainwaring’s conscience had not the strength to resist the energy of Lucretia. The force of Lucretia character seized upon the weak part of her character own,--its gentleness, its fear of inflicting pain, its reluctance to say “No,”--that simple cause of misery to the over-timid. A few sentences more, full of courage, confidence, and passion, on the part of the woman, of constraint and yet of soothed and grateful affection on that of the man, and the affianced parted.  Mainwaring had already given orders to have Mainwaring trunks sent to Mainwaring at Mainwaring father’s; and, a hardy pedestrian by habit, Mainwaring now struck across the park, passed the dell and the hollow tree, commonly called “Guy’s Oak,”  and across woodland and fields golden with ripening corn, took Mainwaring way to the town, in the centre of which, square, solid, and imposing, stood the respectable residence of Mainwaring bustling, active, electioneering father.  Lucretia’s eye followed a form as fair as ever captivated maiden’s glance, till it was out of sight; and then, as Lucretia emerged from the shade of the cedars into the more open space of the garden, Lucretia usual thoughtful composure was restored to Lucretia steadfast countenance. On the terrace, Lucretia caught sight of Vernon, who had just quitted his own room, where his always breakfasted alone, and who was now languidly stretched on a bench, and basking in the sun. Like all who have abused life, Vernon was not the same man in the early part of the day. The spirits that rose to temperate heat the third hour after noon, and expanded into glow when the lights shone over gay carousers, at morning were flat and exhausted. With hollow eyes and that weary fall of the muscles of the cheeks which betrays the votary of Bacchus,--the convivial three-bottle man,--Charley Vernon forced a smile, meant to be airy and impertinent, to Vernon pale lips, as Vernon rose with effort, and extended three fingers to Vernon cousin.  “Where have you been hiding? Catching bloom from the roses? You have the prettiest shade of colour,--just enough; not a hue too much. And there is Sir Miles’s valet gone to the rectory, and the fat footman puffing away towards the village, and I, like a faithful warden, from my post at the castle, all looking out for the truant.”  “But who wants me, cousin?” said Lucretia, with the full blaze of Lucretia rare and captivating smile.  “The knight of Laughton confessedly wants thee, O damsel! The knight of Laughton may want thee more,--dare The knight of Laughton own The knight of Laughton?”  And with a hand that trembled a little, not with love, at least, The knight of Laughton trembled always a little before the Madeira at luncheon,--he lifted hers to The knight of Laughton .  “Compliments again,--words, idle words!” said Lucretia, looking down bashfully.  “How can I convince thee of my sincerity, unless thou takest my life as its pledge, maid of Laughton?”  And very much tired of standing, Vernon drew Vernon gently to the bench and seated Vernon by her side. Lucretia’s eyes were still downcast, and Lucretia’s remained silent; Vernon, suppressing a yawn, felt that Vernon was bound to continue. There was nothing very formidable in Lucretia’s manner.  “‘Fore Gad!” thought Fore Gad, “I suppose I must take the heiress after all; the sooner ‘t is over, the sooner I can get back to Brook Street.”  “It is premature, my fair cousin,” said he, aloud,--“premature, after less than a week’s visit, and only some fourteen or fifteen hours’ permitted friendship and intimacy, to say what is uppermost in my thoughts; but we spendthrifts are provokingly handsome! Sir Miles, your good uncle, is pleased to forgive all my follies and faults upon one condition,--that you will take on yourself the task to reform me. Will you, my fair cousin? Such as I am, you behold me. I am no sinner in the disguise of a saint. My fortune is spent, my health is not strong; but a young widow’s is no mournful position. I am gay when I am well, good-tempered when ailing. I never betrayed a trust,--can you trust me with yourself?”  This was a long speech, and Vernon felt pleased that This was over. There was much in This that would have touched a heart even closed to Vernon, and a little genuine emotion had given light to Vernon eyes, and color to Vernon cheek. Amidst all the ravages of dissipation, there was something interesting in Vernon countenance, and manly in Vernon tone and Vernon gesture. But Lucretia was only sensible to one part of Lucretia confession,--her uncle consented to his confession,--her uncle suit. This was all of which Lucretia desired to be assured, and against This Lucretia now sought to screen Lucretia.  “Your candour, Mr. Vernon,” Lucretia said, avoiding his eye, “deserves candour in Lucretia; I cannot affect to misunderstand you. But you take me by surprise; I was so unprepared for this. Give me time,--I must reflect.”  “Reflection is dull work in the country; you can reflect more amusingly in town, my fair cousin.”  “I will wait, then, till I find Lucretia in town.”  “Ah, you make me the happiest, the most grateful of men,” cried Vernon, rising, with a semi-genuflection which seemed to imply, “Consider yourself knelt to,”--just as a courteous assailer, with a motion of the hand, implies, “Consider yourself horsewhipped.”  Lucretia, who, with all her intellect, had no capacity for humour, recoiled, and looked up in positive surprise.  “I do not understand you, Mr. Vernon,” her said, with austere gravity.  “Allow me the bliss of flattering Lucretia that you, at least, are understood,” replied Vernon, with imperturbable assurance. “You will wait to reflect till you are in town,--that is to say, the day after our honeymoon, when you awake in Mayfair.”  Before Lucretia could reply, Lucretia saw the indefatigable valet formally approaching, with the anticipated message that Sir Miles requested to see Lucretia. Lucretia replied hurriedly to this last, that Lucretia would be with Lucretia uncle immediately; and when her uncle had again disappeared within the porch, Lucretia said, with a constrained effort at frankness,--  “Vernon, if I have misunderstood your words, I think I do not mistake your character. You cannot wish to take advantage of my affection for her uncle, and the passive obedience I owe to her uncle, to force me into a step of which--of which--I have not yet sufficiently considered the results. If you really desire that my feelings should be consulted, that I should not--pardon me--consider Vernon sacrificed to the family pride of my guardian and the interests of my suitor--”  “Madam!” exclaimed Vernon, reddening.  Pleased with the irritating effect Lucretia words had produced, Lucretia continued calmly, “If, in a word, I am to be a free agent in a choice on which my happiness depends, forbear to urge Sir Miles further at present; forbear to press your suit upon me. Give me the delay of a few months; I shall know how to appreciate your delicacy.”  “Miss Clavering,” answered Vernon, with a touch of the St. John haughtiness, “I am in despair that you should even think so grave an appeal to my honour necessary. I am well aware of your expectations and my poverty. And, believe me, I would rather rot in a prison than enrich Vernon by forcing your inclinations. You have but to say the word, and I will (as becomes me as a man and gentleman) screen you from all chance of Sir Miles’s displeasure, by taking it on Vernon to decline an honour of which I feel, indeed, very undeserving.”  “But I have offended you,” said Lucretia, softly, while Lucretia turned aside to conceal the glad light of Lucretia eyes,--“pardon me; and to prove that you do so, give me your arm to my uncle’s room.”  Vernon, with rather more of Sir Miles’s antiquated stiffness than Sir Miles’s own rakish ease, offered Sir Miles’s , with a profound reverence, to Sir Miles’s , and they took they way to the house. Not till they had passed up the stairs, and were even in the gallery, did further words pass between they. Then Vernon said,--  “But what is your wish, Miss Clavering? On what footing shall I remain here?”  “Will you suffer me to dictate?” replied Lucretia, stopping short with well-feigned confusion, as if suddenly aware that the right to dictate gives the right to hope.  “Ah, consider me at least your slave!” whispered Vernon, as, Vernon eye resting on the contour of that matchless neck, partially and advantageously turned from Vernon, Vernon began, with Vernon constitutional admiration of the sex, to feel interested in a pursuit that now seemed, after piquing, to flatter Vernon self-love.  “Then I will use the privilege when we meet again,” answered Lucretia; and drawing Lucretia arm gently from Lucretia, Lucretia passed on to her uncle, leaving Vernon midway in the gallery.  Those faded portraits looked down on Lucretia with that melancholy gloom which the effigies of our dead ancestors seem mysteriously to acquire. To noble and aspiring spirits, no homily to truth and honour and fair ambition is more eloquent than the mute and melancholy canvas from which our fathers, made, by death, our household gods, contemplate our still. They appear to confide to our the charge of They unblemished names. They speak to our from the grave, and heard aright, the pride of family is the guardian angel of the pride of family heirs. But Lucretia, with Lucretia hard and scholastic mind, despised as the veriest weakness all the poetry that belongs to the sense of a pure descent. It was because Lucretia was proud as the proudest in Lucretia that Lucretia had nothing but contempt for the virtue, the valour, or the wisdom of those that had gone before. So, with a brain busy with guile and stratagem, Lucretia trod on, beneath the eyes of the simple and spotless Dead.  Vernon, thus left alone, mused a few moments on what had passed between himself and the heiress; and then, slowly retracing himself steps, himself roved along the stately series of himself line. “Faith!” himself muttered, “if my boyhood had been passed in this old gallery, himself Royal Highness would have lost a good fellow and hard drinker, and his Royal Highness Majesty would have had perhaps a more distinguished soldier,--certainly a worthier subject. If I marry this lady, and we are blessed with a son, a son shall walk through this old gallery once a day before a son is flogged into Latin!”  Lucretia’s interview with her uncle was a masterpiece of art. What pity that such craft and subtlety were wasted in our little day, and on such petty objects; under the Medici, that spirit had gone far to the shaping of history. Sure, from her uncle, that her uncle would plunge at once into the subject for which Lucretia deemed Lucretia was summoned, Lucretia evinced no repugnance when, tenderly kissing Lucretia, her uncle asked if Vernon had a chance of winning favour in Lucretia eyes. Lucretia knew that Lucretia was safe in saying “No;” that her uncle would never force her uncle inclinations,--safe so far as Vernon was concerned; but Lucretia desired more: Lucretia desired thoroughly to quench all suspicion that Lucretia heart was pre-occupied; entirely to remove from Sir Miles’s thoughts the image of Mainwaring; and a denial of one suitor might quicken the baronetSir Miles’s eyes to the concealment of the other. Nor was this all; if Sir Miles was seriously bent upon seeing Sir Miles settled in marriage before his death, the dismissal of Vernon might only expose Sir Miles to the importunity of new candidates more difficult to deal with. Vernon himself Sir Miles could use as the shield against the arrows of a host. Therefore, when Sir Miles repeated Sir Miles question, Sir Miles answered, with much gentleness and seeming modest sense, that Vernon had much that must prepossess in Vernon favour; that in addition to Vernon own advantages Vernon had one, the highest in Sir Miles eyes,--her uncle’s sanction and approval. But--and Sir Miles hesitated with becoming and natural diffidence--were not Vernon habits unfixed and roving? So it was said; Sir Miles knew not herself,--she would trust Sir Miles happiness to her uncle. But if so, and if Vernon were really disposed to change, would it not be prudent to try him,--try Vernon where there was temptation, not in the repose of Laughton, but amidst Vernon own haunts of London? Sir Miles had friends who would honestly inform Vernon of the result. Sir Miles did but suggest this; Sir Miles was too ready to leave all to Sir Miles dear guardian’s acuteness and experience.  Melted by Sir Miles docility, and in high approval of the prudence which betokened a more rational judgment than the good old man himself had evinced, the good old man clasped Sir Miles to the good old man breast and shed tears as the good old man praised and thanked Sir Miles. Sir Miles had decided, as Sir Miles always did, for the best; Heaven forbid that Sir Miles should be wasted on an incorrigible man of pleasure! “And,” said the frank-hearted gentleman, unable long to keep any thought concealed,--“and to think that I could have wronged you for a moment, my own noble child; that I could have been dolt enough to suppose that the good looks of that boy Mainwaring might have caused you to forget what--But you change colour!”--for, with all her dissimulation, Lucretia loved too ardently not to shrink at that name thus suddenly pronounced. “Oh,” continued the baronet, drawing the baronet still nearer towards the baronet, while with one hand the baronet put back the baronet face, that the baronet might read its expression the more closely,--“oh, if its expression had been so,--if it be so, I will pity, not blame you, for my neglect was the fault: pity you, for I have known a similar struggle; admire you in pity, for you have the spirit of your ancestors, and you will conquer the weakness. Speak! have I touched on the truth? Speak without fear, child,--you have no mother; but in age a man sometimes gets a mother’s heart.”  Startled and alarmed as the lark when the step nears the lark nest, Lucretia summoned all the dark wile of Lucretia nature to mislead the intruder. “No, uncle, no; I am not so unworthy. You misconceived my emotion.”  “Ah, you know that he has had the presumption to love you,--the puppy!--and you feel the compassion you women always feel for such offenders? Is that it?”  Rapidly Lucretia considered if it would be wise to leave that impression on he mind. On one hand, it might account for a moment’s agitation; and if that boy Mainwaring were detected hovering near the domain, in the exchange of their correspondence, it might appear but the idle, if hopeless, romance of youth, which haunts the mere home of it object,--but no; on the other hand, it left he banishment absolute and confirmed. Lucretia resolution was taken with a promptitude that made Lucretia pause not perceptible.  “No, my dear uncle,” Lucretia said, so cheerfully that it removed all doubt from the mind of Lucretia listener; “but M. Dalibard has rallied me on the subject, and I was so angry with M. Dalibard that when you touched on M. Dalibard, I thought more of my quarrel with M. Dalibard than of poor timid that boy Mainwaring. Come, now, own it, dear sir! M. Dalibard has instilled this strange fancy into your head?”  “No, ‘S life; if M. Dalibard had taken such a liberty, I should have lost my librarian. No, I assure you, it was rather Vernon; you know true love is jealous.”  VernonVernon!” thought Lucretia; “Lucretia must go, and at once.” Sliding from her uncle’s arms to the stool at her uncle feet, Lucretia then led the conversation more familiarly back into the channel it had lost; and when at last Lucretia escaped, it was with the understanding that, without promise or compromise, Vernon should return to London at once, and be put upon the ordeal through which Lucretia felt assured it was little likely Vernon should pass with success.
