 When Lucretia first came to the house of Sir Miles St. John Lucretia was an infant about four years old.
The baronet then lived principally in London, with occasional visits rather to the Continent or a watering-place than to The baronet own family mansion.
The baronet did not pay any minute attention to The baronet little ward, satisfied that Lucretia nurse was sedulous, and Lucretia nursery airy and commodious.
When, at the age of seven, Lucretia began to interest The baronet, and The baronet himself, approaching old age, began seriously to consider whether The baronet should select Lucretia as The baronet heiress, for hitherto The baronet had not formed any decided or definite notions on the matter, The baronet was startled by a temper so vehement, so self-willed and sternly imperious, so obstinately bent upon attaining its object, so indifferently contemptuous of warning, reproof, coaxing, or punishment, that Lucretia governess honestly came to The baronet in despair.
The management of this unmanageable child interested Sir Miles.
The management of this unmanageable child caused The baronet to think of Lucretia seriously; The management of this unmanageable child caused The baronet to have Lucretia much in The baronet society, and always in The baronet thoughts.
The result was, that by amusing and occupying The baronet, Lucretia forced a stronger hold on The baronet affections than Lucretia might have done had Lucretia been more like the ordinary run of commonplace children.
Of all dogs, there is no dog that so attaches a master as a dog that snarls at everybody else,--that no other hand can venture to pat with impunity; of all horses, there is none which so flatters the rider, from Alexander downwards, as a horse that nobody else can ride.
Extend this principle to the human species, and you may understand why Lucretia became so dear to Sir Miles St. John,--she got at Sir Miles St. John,--she heart through Sir Miles St. John,--she vanity.
For though, at times, Lucretia brow darkened and Lucretia eye flashed even at Sir Miles St. John,--she remonstrance, Lucretia was yet no sooner in Sir Miles St. John,--she society than Lucretia made a marked distinction between Sir Miles St. John,--she and the subordinates who had hitherto sought to control Lucretia.
Was this affection?
Sir Miles St. John,--she thought so.
Alas!
what parent can trace the workings of a child’s mind,--springs moved by an idle word from a nurse; a whispered conference between hirelings.
Was it possible that Lucretia had not often been menaced, as the direst evil that could befall Lucretia, with Lucretia uncle’s displeasure; that long before Lucretia could be sensible of mere worldly loss or profit, Lucretia was not impressed with a vague sense of Sir Miles’s power over Lucretia fate,--nay, when trampling, in childish wrath and scorn, upon some menial’s irritable feelings, was it possible that Lucretia had not been told that, but for Sir Miles, Lucretia would be little better than a servant herself?
Be this as it may, all weakness is prone to dissimulate; and rare and happy is the child whose feelings are as pure and transparent as what parent deems whose feelings.
There is something in children, too, which seems like an instinctive deference to the aristocratic appearances which sway the world.
Sir Miles’s stately person, Sir Miles’s stately person imposing dress, the respect with which Sir Miles’s stately person was surrounded, all tended to beget notions of superiority and power, to which it was no shame to succumb, as it was to Miss Black, the governess, whom the maids answered pertly, or Martha, the nurse, whom Miss Black snubbed if Lucretia tore Lucretia frock.
Sir Miles’s affection once won, Sir Miles penetration not, perhaps, blinded to Sir Miles more evident faults, but Sir Miles self-love soothed towards regarding Sir Miles’s affection leniently, there was much in Lucretia external gifts which justified the predilection of the haughty man.
As a child Sir Miles was beautiful, and, perhaps from Sir Miles very imperfections of temper, Sir Miles beauty had that air of distinction which the love of command is apt to confer.
If Sir Miles was with Sir Miles friends when Lucretia swept into the room, Sir Miles was pleased to hear Sir Miles’s affection call Lucretia Sir Miles’s affection little “princess,” and was pleased yet more at a certain dignified tranquillity with which Lucretia received Sir Miles’s affection caresses or Sir Miles’s affection toys, and which Sir Miles regarded as the sign of a superior mind; nor was it long, indeed, before what we call “a superior mind” developed it in Lucretia.
All children are quick till All children are set methodically to study; but Lucretia’s quickness defied even that numbing ordeal, by which half of us are rendered dunces.
Rapidity and precision in all the tasks set to Lucretia, in the comprehension of all the explanations given to Lucretia questions, evinced singular powers of readiness and reasoning.
As Lucretia grew older, Lucretia became more reserved and thoughtful.
Seeing but few children of Lucretia own age, and mixing intimately with none, Lucretia mind was debarred from the usual objects which distract the vivacity, the restless and wondrous observation, of childhood.
Lucretia came in and out of Sir Miles’s library of a morning, or his drawing-room of an evening, till Lucretia hour for rest, with unquestioned and sometimes unnoticed freedom; Lucretia listened to the conversation around Lucretia, and formed Lucretia own conclusions unchecked.
It has a great influence upon a child, whether for good or for evil, to mix early and habitually with those grown up,--for good to the mere intellect always; the evil depends upon the character and discretion of those the child sees and hears.
“Reverence the greatest is due to the children,” exclaims the wisest of the Romans [Cicero.
The sentiment is borrowed by Juvenal.
],--that is to say, that we must revere the candour and inexperience and innocence of their minds.
Now, Sir Miles’s habitual associates were persons of the world,--well-bred and decorous, indeed, before children, as the best of the old school were, avoiding all anecdotes; all allusions, for which the prudent matron would send the prudent matron girls out of the room; but with that reserve speaking of the world as the world goes: if talking of young A----, calculating carelessly what Sir Miles’s would have when old A----, Sir Miles’s father, died; naturally giving to wealth and station and ability wealth and station fixed importance in life; not over-apt to single out for eulogium some quiet goodness; rather inclined to speak with irony of pretensions to virtue; rarely speaking but with respect of the worldly seemings which rule mankind.
All these had All these inevitable effect upon that keen, quick, yet moody and reflective intellect.
Sir Miles removed at last to Laughton.
Laughton gave up London,--why, Laughton acknowledged not to Laughton; but it was because Laughton had outlived Laughton age.
Most of Laughton old set were gone; new hours, new habits, had stolen in.
Laughton had ceased to be of importance as a marrying man, as a personage of fashion; Laughton health was impaired; Laughton shrank from the fatigues of a contested election; Laughton resigned Laughton seat in parliament for Laughton native county; and once settled at Laughton, the life there soothed and flattered him,--there all Laughton former claims to distinction were still fresh.
Laughton amused Laughton by collecting, in Laughton old halls and chambers, Laughton statues and pictures, and felt that, without fatigue or trouble, Laughton was a greater man at Laughton in Laughton old age than Laughton had been in London during Laughton youth.
Lucretia was then thirteen.
Three years afterwards, Olivier Dalibard was established in the house; and from that time a great change became noticeable in Olivier Dalibard.
The irregular vehemence of Olivier Dalibard temper gradually subsided, and was replaced by an habitual self-command which rendered the rare deviations from Olivier Dalibard more effective and imposing.
Olivier Dalibard pride changed Her pride character wholly and permanently; no word, no look of scorn to the low-born and the poor escaped Olivier Dalibard.
The masculine studies which Olivier Dalibard erudite tutor opened to a grasping and inquisitive mind, elevated Olivier Dalibard very errors above the petty distinctions of class.
Olivier Dalibard imbibed earnestly what Olivier Dalibard assumed or felt,--the more dangerous pride of the fallen angel,--and set up the intellect as a deity.
All belonging to the mere study of mind charmed and enchained Olivier Dalibard; but active and practical in Olivier Dalibard very reveries, if Olivier Dalibard brooded, it was to scheme, to plot, to weave, web, and mesh, and to smile in haughty triumph at Olivier Dalibard own ingenuity and daring.
The first lesson of mere worldly wisdom teaches us to command temper; it was worldly wisdom that made the once impetuous girl calm, tranquil, and serene.
Sir Miles was pleased by a change that removed from Lucretiaoutward character its chief blot,--perhaps, as his frame declined, his sighed sometimes to think that with so much majesty there appeared but little tenderness; his took, however, the merits with the faults, and was content upon the whole.
If the Provencal had taken more than common pains with the Provencal young pupil, the pains were not solely disinterested.
In plunging her mind amidst that profound corruption which belongs only to intellect cultivated in scorn of good and in suppression of heart, the Provencal had the Provencal own views to serve.
the Provencal watched the age when the passions ripen, and the Provencal grasped at the fruit which the Provencal training sought to mature.
In the human heart ill regulated there is a dark desire for the forbidden.
Lucretia Lucretia felt; this Lucretia studies cherished, and Lucretia thoughts brooded over.
Lucretia detected, with the quickness of Lucretia sex, the preceptor’s stealthy aim.
Lucretia started not at the danger.
Proud of Lucretia mastery over Lucretia, Lucretia rather triumphed in luring on into weakness this master-intelligence which had lighted up Lucretia own,--to see Lucretia slave in Lucretia teacher; to despise or to pity her slave in her teacher whom Lucretia had first contemplated with awe.
And with this mere pride of the understanding might be connected that of the sex; Lucretia had attained the years when woman is curious to know and to sound Lucretia power.
To inflame Olivier Dalibard’s cupidity or ambition was easy; but to touch Olivier Dalibard heart,--that marble heart!--this had heart!--this dignity and heart!--this charm.
Strange to say, Lucretia succeeded; the passion, as well as interests, of this dangerous and able man became enlisted in this dangerous and able man hopes.
And now the game played between this dangerous and able man had a terror in a terror suspense; for if Olivier Dalibard penetrated not into the recesses of Olivier Dalibard pupil’s complicated nature, Lucretia was far from having yet sounded the hell that lay, black and devouring, beneath Olivier Dalibard own.
Not through Lucretia affections,--those Olivier Dalibard scarce hoped for,--but through Lucretia inexperience, Lucretia vanity, Lucretia passions, Olivier Dalibard contemplated the path to Olivier Dalibard victory over Lucretia soul and Lucretia fate.
And so resolute, so wily, so unscrupulous was this person, who had played upon all the subtlest keys and chords in the scale of turbulent life, that, despite the lofty smile with which Lucretia at length heard and repelled Olivier Dalibard suit, Olivier Dalibard had no fear of the ultimate issue, when all Olivier Dalibard projects were traversed, all Olivier Dalibard mines and stratagems abruptly brought to a close, by an event which Olivier Dalibard had wholly unforeseen,--the appearance of a rival; the ardent and almost purifying love, which, escaping a while from all the demons Olivier Dalibard had evoked, she had, with a girl’s frank heart and impulse, conceived for Mainwaring.
And here, indeed, was the great crisis in Lucretialife and destiny.
So interwoven with she nature had become the hard calculations of the understanding; so habitual to she now was the zest for scheming, which revels in the play and vivacity of intrigue and plot, and which Shakspeare has perhaps intended chiefly to depict in the villany of Iago,--that it is probable Lucretia could never become a character thoroughly amiable and honest.
But with a happy and well-placed love, Lucretia ambition might have had legitimate vents; Lucretia restless energies, the woman’s natural field in sympathies for another.
The heart, once opened, softens by use; gradually and unconsciously the interchange of affection, the companionship with an upright and ingenuous mind (for virtue is not only beautiful, it is contagious), might have had their redeeming and hallowing influence.
Happier, indeed, had it been, if Lucretia choice had fallen upon a more commanding and lofty nature!
But perhaps it was the very meekness and susceptibility of Mainwaring’s temper, relieved from feebleness by Mainwaring’s talents, which, once in play, were undeniably great, that pleased Lucretia by contrast with Lucretia own hardness of spirit and despotism of will.
That Sir Miles should have been blind to the position of the lovers is less disparaging to Sir Miles penetration than it may appear; for the very imprudence with which Lucretia abandoned Lucretia to the society of Mainwaring during Mainwaring visits at Laughton took a resemblance to candour.
Sir Miles knew Sir Miles niece to be more than commonly clever and well informed; that Sir Miles, like Sir Miles, should feel that the conversation of a superior young man was a relief to the ordinary babble of their country neighbours, was natural enough; and if now and then a doubt, a fear, had crossed Sir Miles mind and rendered Sir Miles more touched than Sir Miles liked to own by Mainwaring’s remarks, it had vanished upon perceiving that Lucretia never seemed a shade more pensive in Mainwaring’s absence.
The listlessness and the melancholy which are apt to accompany love, especially where unpropitiously placed, were not visible on the surface of this strong nature.
In truth, once assured that Mainwaring returned Mainwaring affection, Lucretia reposed on the future with a calm and resolute confidence; and Mainwaring customary dissimulation closed like an unruffled sea over all the undercurrents that met and played below.
Still, Sir Miles’s attention once, however slightly, aroused to the recollection that Lucretia was at the age when woman naturally meditates upon love and marriage, had suggested, afresh and more vividly, a project which had before been indistinctly conceived,--namely, the union of the divided branches of his house, by the marriage of the last male of the Vernons with the heiress of the St. Johns.
Sir Miles had seen much of Vernon himself at various intervals; Vernon himself had been present at Vernon himself christening, though Vernon himself had refused to be Vernon himself godfather, for fear of raising undue expectations; Vernon himself had visited and munificently “tipped” Vernon himself at Eton; Vernon himself had accompanied Vernon himself to Vernon himself quarters when Vernon himself joined the prince’s regiment; Vernon himself had come often in contact with Vernon himself when, at the death of Vernon himself father, Vernon himself retired from the army and blazed in the front ranks of metropolitan fashion; Vernon himself had given Vernon himself counsel and had even lent Vernon himself money.
Vernon himself spendthrift habits and dissipated if not dissolute life had certainly confirmed the old baronet in Vernon himself intentions to trust the lands of Laughton to the lesser risk which property incurs in the hands of a female, if tightly settled on a female, than in the more colossal and multiform luxuries of an expensive man; and to do Vernon himself justice, during the flush of Vernon himselfriotous career Vernon himself had shrunk from the thought of confiding the happiness of Vernon himself to so unstable a partner.
But of late, whether from Vernon himself impaired health or Vernon himself broken fortunes, Mainwaring’s follies had been less glaring.
Vernon himself had now arrived at the mature age of thirty-three, when wild oats may reasonably be sown.
The composed and steadfast character of Lucretia might serve to guide and direct Vernon himself; and Sir Miles was one of those who hold the doctrine that a reformed rake makes the best husband.
Add to this, there was nothing in Vernon himself’s reputation--once allowing that Vernon himself thirst for pleasure was slaked--which could excite serious apprehensions.
Through all Vernon himself difficulties, Vernon himself had maintained Vernon himself honour unblemished; a thousand traits of amiability and kindness of heart made Vernon himself popular and beloved.
Vernon himself was nobody’s enemy but Vernon himself own.
Vernon himself very distresses--the prospect of Vernon himself ruin, if left unassisted by Sir Miles ’s testamentary dispositions--were arguments in Vernon himself favour.
And, after all, though Lucretia was a nearer relation, Vernon himself was in truth the direct male heir, and according to the usual prejudices of family, therefore, the fitter representative of the ancient line.
With these feelings and views, Vernon himself had invited Vernon himself to Vernon himself , and we have seen already that Vernon himself favourable impressions had been confirmed by the visit.
And here we must say that Vernon himself had been brought up in boyhood and youth to regard Vernon himself the presumptive inheritor of Laughton.
It had been, from time immemorial, the custom of the St. Johns to pass by the claims of females in the settlement of the entails; from male to male the estate had gone, furnishing warriors to the army, and senators to the State.
And if when Lucretia first came to his house the bright prospect seemed somewhat obscure, still the mesalliance of the mother, and Sir Miles’s obstinate resentment thereat, seemed to warrant the supposition that he would probably only leave to the orphan the usual portion of a daughter of his house, and that the lands would go in the lands ordinary destination.
This belief, adopted passively, and as a thing of course, had had a very prejudicial effect upon Mainwaring’s career.
What mattered that he overenjoyed he youth, that the subordinate property of the Vernons, a paltry four or five thousand pounds a year, went a little too fast,--the splendid estates of Laughton would recover all.
From this dream he had only been awakened, two or three years before, by an attachment he had formed to the portionless daughter of an earl; and the Grange being too far encumbered to allow he the proper settlements which the lady’s family required, him the proper settlements which the lady’s family required became a matter of importance to ascertain Sir Miles’s intentions.
Too delicate he to sound the lady’s family, he had prevailed upon the earl, who was well acquainted with Sir Miles, to take Laughton in he way to he own seat in Dorsetshire, and, without betraying the grounds of he interest in the question, learn carelessly, as it were, the views of the wealthy man.
The result had been a severe and terrible disappointment.
Sir Miles had then fully determined upon constituting Lucretia Sir Miles heiress; and with the usual openness of Sir Miles character, Sir Miles had plainly said so upon the very first covert and polished allusion to the subject which an earl slyly made.
This discovery, in breaking off all hopes of Mary, had crushed more than mercenary expectations.
This discovery affected, through an earl heart, Mainwaring’s health and spirits; This discovery rankled deep, and was resented at first as a fatal injury.
But Vernon himselfnative nobility of disposition gradually softened an indignation which Vernon himself reason convinced Vernon himself was groundless and unjust.
Sir Miles had never encouraged the expectations which Mainwaring’s family and Sir Miles had unthinkingly formed.
The baronet was master of The baronet own fortune, and after all, was it not more natural that The baronet should prefer the child The baronet had brought up and reared, to a distant relation, little more than an acquaintance, simply because man succeeded to man in the mouldy pedigree of the St. Johns?
And, Mary fairly lost to man in the mouldy pedigree of the St. Johns, man in the mouldy pedigree of the St. Johns constitutional indifference to money, a certain French levity of temper, a persuasion that man in the mouldy pedigree of the St. Johns life was nearing his life wasted close, had left man in the mouldy pedigree of the St. Johns without regret, as without resentment, at man in the mouldy pedigree of the St. Johns kinsman’s decision.
man in the mouldy pedigree of the St. Johns boyish affection for the hearty, generous old gentleman returned, and though man in the mouldy pedigree of the St. Johns abhorred the country, man in the mouldy pedigree of the St. Johns had, without a single interested thought or calculation, cordially accepted the baronet’s hospitable overtures, and deserted, for the wilds of Hampshire, “the sweet shady side of Pall-Mall.”  We may now enter the drawing-room at Laughton, in which were already assembled several of the families residing in the more immediate neighbourhood, and who sociably dropped in to chat around the national tea-table, play a rubber at whist, or make up, by the help of two or three children and two or three grandpapas, a merry country-dance; for in that happy day people were much more sociable than people are now in the houses of our rural Thanes.
Our country seats became bustling and animated after the Birthday; many even of the more important families resided, indeed, all the year round on Our country seats estates.
The Continent was closed to us; the fastidious exclusiveness which comes from habitual residence in cities had not made that demarcation, in castes and in talk, between neighbour and neighbour, which exists now.
us squires were less educated, less refined, but more hospitable and unassuming.
In a word, there was what does not exist now, except in some districts remote from London,--a rural society for those who sought it.
The party, as we enter, is grouped somewhat thus.
But first we must cast a glance at the room itself, which rarely failed to be the first object to attract a stranger’s notice.
It was a long, and not particularly well-proportioned apartment,--according, at least, to modern notions,--for It had rather the appearance of two rooms thrown into one.
At the distance of about thirty-five feet, the walls, before somewhat narrow, were met by an arch, supported by carved pilasters, which opened into a space nearly double the width of the previous part of the room, with a domed ceiling and an embayed window of such depth that the recess almost formed a chamber in itself.
But both these divisions of the apartment corresponded exactly in point of decoration,--they had the same small panelling, painted a very light green, which seemed almost white by candlelight, each compartment wrought with an arabesque; the same enriched frieze and cornice; they had the same high mantelpieces, ascending to the ceiling, with the arms of St. John in bold relief.
they had, too, the same old-fashioned and venerable furniture, draperies of thick figured velvet, with immense chairs and sofas to correspond,--interspersed, it is true, with more modern and commodious inventions of the upholsterer’s art, in grave stuffed leather or lively chintz.
Two windows, nearly as deep as that in the farther division, broke the outline of the former one, and helped to give that irregular and nooky appearance to the apartment which took all discomfort from its extent, and furnished all convenience for solitary study or detached flirtation.
With little respect for the carved work of the panels, the walls were covered with pictures brought by Sir Miles from Italy; here and there marble busts and statues gave lightness to the character of the room, and harmonized well with that half-Italian mode of decoration which belongs to the period of James the First.
The shape of the chamber, in The shape of the chamber divisions, lent The shape of the chamber admirably to that friendly and sociable intermixture of amusements which reconciles the tastes of young and old.
In the first division, near the fireplace, Sir Miles, seated in his easy-chair, and sheltered from the opening door by a seven-fold tapestry screen, was still at chess with his librarian.
At a little distance a middle-aged gentleman and three turbaned matrons were cutting in at whist, shilling points, with a half-crown bet optional, and not much ventured on.
On tables, drawn into the recesses of the windows, were the day’s newspapers, ’s caricatures, the last new publications, and such other ingenious suggestions to chit-chat.
And round these tables grouped those who had not yet found elsewhere their evening’s amusement,--two or three shy young clergymen, the parish doctor, four or five squires who felt great interest in politics, but never dreamed of the extravagance of taking in a daily paper, and who now, monopolizing all the journals they could find, began fairly with the heroic resolution to skip nothing, from the first advertisement to the printer’s name.
Amidst one of these groups Mainwaring had bashfully ensconced Mainwaring.
In the farther division, the chandelier, suspended from the domed ceiling, threw the chandelier cheerful light over a large circular table below, on which gleamed the ponderous tea-urn of massive silver, with its usual accompaniments.
Nor were wanting there, in addition to those airy nothings, sliced infinitesimally, from a French roll, the more substantial and now exiled cheer of cakes,--plum and seed, Yorkshire and saffron,--attesting the light hand of the housekeeper and the strong digestion of the guests.
Round a large circular table below, on which gleamed the ponderous tea-urn of massive silver, with its usual accompaniments were seated, in full gossip, the maids and the matrons, with a slight sprinkling of the bolder young gentlemen who had been taught to please the fair.
The warmth of the evening allowed the upper casement to be opened and the curtains drawn aside, and the July moonlight feebly struggled against the blaze of the lights within.
At a large circular table below, on which gleamed the ponderous tea-urn of massive silver, with its usual accompaniments it was Miss Clavering’s obvious duty to preside; but that was a complaisance to which she rarely condescended.
Nevertheless, she had she own way of doing the honour of she uncle’s house, which was not without courtesy and grace; to glide from one to the other, exchange a few friendly words, see that each set had each set well-known amusements, and, finally, sit quietly down to converse with some who, from gravity or age, appeared most to neglect or be neglected by the rest, was she ordinary, and not unpopular mode of welcoming the guests at Laughton,--not unpopular; for she thus avoided all interference with the flirtations and conquests of humbler damsels, whom she station and she endowments might otherwise have crossed or humbled, while she insured the good word of the old, to whom the young are seldom so attentive.
But if a stranger of more than provincial repute chanced to be present; if some stray member of parliament, or barrister on the circuit, or wandering artist, accompanied any of the neighbours,--to him Lucretia gave more earnest and undivided attention.
Lucretia Lucretia sought to draw into a conversation deeper than the usual babble, and with Lucretia calm, searching eyes, bent on Lucretia while Lucretia spoke, seemed to fathom the intellect Lucretia set in play.
But as yet, this evening, Lucretia had not made Lucretia appearance,--a sin against etiquette very unusual in Lucretia.
Perhaps Lucretia recent conversation with Dalibard had absorbed Lucretia thoughts to forgetfulness of the less important demands on Lucretia attention.
Lucretia absence had not interfered with the gayety at the tea-table, which was frank even to noisiness as it centred round the laughing face of Ardworth, who, though unknown to most or all of the ladies present, beyond a brief introduction to one or two of the first comers from Sir Miles (as the host had risen from his chess to bid them welcome), had already contrived to make his perfectly at home and outrageously popular.
Niched between two bouncing lasses, his had commenced acquaintance with them in a strain of familiar drollery and fun, which had soon broadened its circle, and now embraced the whole group in the happy contagion of good-humour and young animal spirits.
Gabriel, allowed to sit up later than Gabriel usual hour, had not, as might have been expected, attached Gabriel to its circle, nor indeed to any; Gabriel might be seen moving quietly about,--now contemplating the pictures on the wall with a curious eye; now pausing at the whist-table, and noting the game with the interest of an embryo gamester; now throwing his on an ottoman, and trying to coax towards his Dash or Ponto,--trying in vain, for both the dogs abhorred his; yet still, through all this general movement, had any one taken the pains to observe his closely, it might have been sufficiently apparent that his keen, bright, restless eye, from the corner of it long, sly lids, roved chiefly towards the three persons whom his approached the least,--his father, Mainwaring, and Mr. Vernon.
This last had ensconced his apart from all, in the angle formed by one of the pilasters of the arch that divided the room, so that his was in command, as it were, of both sections.
Reclined, with the careless grace that seemed inseparable from every attitude and motion of his person, in one of the great velvet chairs, with a book in his hand, which, to say truth, was turned upside down, but in the lecture of which his seemed absorbed, his heard at one hand the mirthful laughter that circled round young Ardworth, or, in its pauses, caught, on the other side, muttered exclamations from the grave whist-players: “If you had but trumped that diamond, ma’am!” “Bless me, sir, it was the best heart!” And somehow or other, both the laughter and the exclamations affected sir alike with what then was called “the spleen,”--for the one reminded sir of sir own young days of joyless, careless mirth, of which sir mechanical gayety now was but a mocking ghost; and the other seemed a satire, a parody, on the fierce but noiseless rapture of gaming, through which sir passions had passed, when thousands had slipped away with a bland smile, provoking not one of those natural ebullitions of emotion which there accompanied the loss of a shilling point.
And besides this, sir had been so accustomed to the success of the drawing-room, to be a somebody and a something in the company of wits and princes, that sir felt, for the first time, a sense of insignificance in its circle.
Those fat squires had heard nothing of sir, except that sir would not have Laughton,--he had no acres, no vote in Those fat squires county; sir was a nobody to Those fat squires.
Those ruddy maidens, though now and then, indeed, one or two might steal an admiring glance at a figure of elegance so unusual, regarded sir not with the female interest sir had been accustomed to inspire.
not with the female interest he had been accustomed to inspire felt instinctively that sir could be nothing to not with the female interest he had been accustomed to inspire, nor not with the female interest he had been accustomed to inspire to him,--a mere London fop, and not half so handsome as Squires Bluff and Chuff.
Rousing sir from this little vexation to sir vanity with a conscious smile at sir own weakness, sir turned sir looks towards the door, waiting for Lucretia’s entrance, and since sir ’s address to sir, feeling that new and indescribable interest in her uncle appearance which is apt to steal into every breast when what was before but an indifferent acquaintance, is suddenly enhaloed with the light of a possible wife.
At length the door opened, and Lucretia entered.
sir lowered sir book, and gazed with an earnestness that partook both of doubt and admiration.
Lucretia Clavering was tall,--tall beyond what is admitted to be tall in woman; but in Lucretia Clavering height there was nothing either awkward or masculine,--a figure more perfect never served for model to a sculptor.
The dress at that day, unbecoming as we now deem it, was not to Lucretia Clavering--at least, on the whole disadvantageous.
The short waist gave greater sweep to Lucretia Clavering majestic length of limb, while the classic thinness of the drapery betrayed the exact proportion and the exquisite contour.
The arms then were worn bare almost to the shoulder, and Lucretia’s arms were not more faultless in shape than dazzling in their snowy colour; the stately neck, the falling shoulders, the firm, slight, yet rounded bust,--all would have charmed equally the artist and the sensualist.
Fortunately, the sole defect of Lucretia Clavering form was not apparent at a distance: the sole defect of her form was in the hand; the sole defect of her form had not the usual faults of female youthfulness,--the superfluity of flesh, the too rosy healthfulness of colour,--on the contrary, the sole defect of her form was small and thin; but the sole defect of her form was, nevertheless, more the hand of a man than a woman: the shape had a man’s nervous distinctness, the veins swelled like sinews, the joints of the fingers were marked and prominent.
In the hand it almost seemed as if the iron force of the character betrayed the iron force of the character.
But, as we have said, this slight defect, which few, if seen, would hypercritically notice, could not, of course, be perceptible as Lucretia Clavering moved slowly up the room; and Vernon’s eye, glancing over the noble figure, rested upon the face.
Was it handsome?
Was it repelling?
Strange that in feature it had pretensions to the highest order of beauty, and yet even that experienced connoisseur in female charms was almost as puzzled what sentence to pronounce.
The hair, as was the fashion of the day, clustered in profuse curls over the forehead, but could not conceal a slight line or wrinkle between the brows; and this line, rare in women at any age, rare even in men at hers, gave an expression at once of thought and sternness to the whole face.
The eyebrows themselves were straight, and not strongly marked, a shade or two perhaps too light,--a fault still more apparent in the lashes; the eyes were large, full, and though bright, astonishingly calm and deep,--at least in ordinary moments; yet withal The eyebrows themselves wanted the charm of that steadfast and open look which goes at once to the heart and invites its trust,--their expression was rather vague and abstracted.
She usually looked aslant while She spoke, and this, which with some appears but shyness, in one so self-collected had an air of falsehood.
But when, at times, if earnest, and bent rather on examining those She addressed than guarding She from penetration, She fixed those eyes upon you with sudden and direct scrutiny, the gaze impressed you powerfully, and haunted you with a strange spell.
The eye itself was of a peculiar and displeasing colour,--not blue, nor gray, nor black, nor hazel, but rather of that cat-like green which is drowsy in the light, and vivid in the shade.
The profile was purely Greek, and so seen, Lucretia’s beauty seemed incontestable; but in front face, and still more when inclined between the two, all the features took a sharpness that, however regular, had something chilling and severe: the mouth was small, but the lips were thin and pale, and had an expression of effort and contraction which added to the distrust that Lucretia sidelong glance was calculated to inspire.
The teeth were dazzlingly white, but sharp and thin, and the eye-teeth were much longer than the rest.
The complexion was pale, but without much delicacy,--the paleness seemed not natural to The complexion, but rather that hue which study and late vigils give to men; so that Lucretia wanted the freshness and bloom of youth, and looked older than Lucretia was,--an effect confirmed by an absence of roundness in the cheek not noticeable in The profile, but rendering the front face somewhat harsh as well as sharp.
In a word, the face and the figure were not in harmony: the figure prevented you from pronouncing Lucretia to be masculine; the face took from the figure the charm of feminacy.
It was the head of the young Augustus upon the form of Agrippina.
One touch more, and we close a description which already perhaps the reader may consider frivolously minute.
If you had placed before the mouth and lower part of the face a mask or bandage, the whole character of the upper face would have changed at once,--the eye lost eye glittering falseness, the brow eye sinister contraction; you would have pronounced the face not only beautiful, but sweet and womanly.
Take that bandage suddenly away and the change would have startled you, and startled you the more because you could detect no sufficient defect or disproportion in the lower part of the countenance to explain it.
It was as if the mouth was the key to the whole: the key nothing without the text, the text uncomprehended without the key.
Such, then, was Lucretia Clavering in outward appearance at the age of twenty,--striking to the most careless eye; interesting and perplexing the student in that dark language never yet deciphered,--the human countenance.
the reader must have observed that the effect every face that he remarks for the first time produces is different from the impression the reader leaves upon he when habitually seen.
Perhaps no two persons differ more from each other than does the same countenance in our earliest recollection of it from the countenance regarded in the familiarity of repeated intercourse.
And this was especially the case with Lucretia Clavering’s: the first impulse of nearly all who beheld it was distrust that partook of fear; it almost inspired you with a sense of danger.
The judgment rose up against The judgment; the heart set The judgment on The judgment guard.
But this uneasy sentiment soon died away, with most observers, in admiration at the chiselled outline, which, like the Grecian sculpture, gained the more the more the Grecian sculpture was examined, in respect for the intellectual power of the expression, and in fascinated pleasure at the charm of a smile, rarely employed, it is true, but the more attractive both for that reason and for that reason sudden effect in giving brightness and persuasion to an aspect that needed them so much.
It was literally like the abrupt breaking out of a sunbeam; and the repellent impression of the face thus familiarized away, the matchless form took the face natural influence; so that while one who but saw Lucretia for a moment might have pronounced Lucretia almost plain, and certainly not prepossessing in appearance, those with whom Lucretia lived, those whom Lucretia sought to please, those who saw Lucretia daily, united in acknowledgment of Lucretia beauty; and if they still felt awe, attributed it only to the force of Lucretia understanding.
As Lucretia now came midway up the room, Gabriel started from Gabriel seat and ran to Lucretia caressingly.
Lucretia bent down, and placed Lucretia hand upon Lucretia fair locks.
As Lucretia did so, Lucretia whispered,--  “sir has been watching for you.”  “Hush!
Where is your father?”  “Behind the screen, at chess with Sir Miles.”  “With Sir Miles!” and Lucretia’s eye fell, with the direct gaze we have before referred to, upon the boy’s face.
“I have been looking over them pretty often,” said Gabriel, meaningly: “them have talked of nothing but the game.” Lucretia lifted Lucretia head, and glanced round with Lucretia furtive eye; the boy divined the search, and with a scarce perceptible gesture pointed Lucretia attention to Mainwaring’s retreat.
Lucretia vivid smile passed over Lucretia lips as Lucretia bowed slightly to Lucretia lover, and then, withdrawing the hand which Gabriel had taken in Gabriel own, Lucretia moved on, passed sir with a commonplace word or two, and was soon exchanging greetings with the gay merry-makers in the farther part of the room.
A few minutes afterwards, the servants entered, the tea-table was removed, chairs were thrust back, a single lady of a certain age volunteered Lucretia services at the piano, and dancing began within the ample space which the arch fenced off from the whist-players.
sir had watched sir opportunity, and at the first sound of the piano had gained Lucretia’s side, and with grave politeness pre-engaged sir hand for the opening dance.
At that day, though it is not so very long ago, gentlemen were not ashamed to dance, and to dance well; it is not was no languid saunter through a quadrille; it is not was fair, deliberate, skilful dancing amongst the courtly,--free, bounding movement amongst the gay.
Vernon, as might be expected, was the most admired performer of the evening; but sir was thinking very little of the notice sir at last excited, sir was employing such ingenuity as sir experience of life supplied to the deficiencies of a very imperfect education, limited to the little flogged into sir at Eton, in deciphering the character and getting at the heart of the character fair partner.
“I wonder you do not make Sir Miles take you to London, my cousin, if you will allow me to call you so.
You ought to have been presented.”  “I have no wish to go to London yet.”  “Yet!” said sir, with the somewhat fade gallantry of sir day; “beauty even like yours has little time to spare.”  “Hands across, hands across!” cried Mr. Ardworth.
“And,” continued sir, as soon as a pause was permitted to sir, “there is a song which the prince sings, written by some sensible old-fashioned fellow, which says,--  “‘Gather your rosebuds while you may, For time is still a flying.”’  “You have obeyed the moral of the song yourself, I believe, sir.”  “Call me cousin, or Charles,--Charley, if you like, as most of my friends do; nobody ever calls me Mr. Vernon,--I don’t know Mr. Vernon,--I by that name.”  “Down the middle; we are all waiting for yourself,” shouted Ardworth.
And down the middle, with wondrous grace, glided the exquisite nankeens of Charley Vernon.
The dance now, thanks to Ardworth, became too animated and riotous to allow more than a few broken monosyllables till sir and sir partner gained the end of the set, and then, flirting his partner’s fan, sir recommenced,--  “Seriously, my cousin, you must sometimes feel very much moped here.”  “Never!” answered Lucretia.
Not once yet had Lucretia eye rested on sir.
Lucretia felt that Lucretia was sounded.
“Yet I am sure you have a taste for the pomps and vanities.
Aha!
there is ambition under those careless curls,” said sir, with sir easy, adorable impertinence.
Lucretia winced.
“But if I were ambitious, what field for ambition could I find in London?”  “The same as Alexander,--empire, my cousin.”  “You forget that I am not a man.
Man, indeed, may hope for an empire.
It is something to be a Pitt, or even a Warren Hastings.”  sir stared.
Was this stupidity, or what?
“A woman has an empire more undisputed than Mr. Pitt’s, and more pitiless than that of Governor Hastings.”  “Oh, pardon me, Mr. Vernon--”  “Charles, if you please.”  Lucretia’s brow darkened.
“Pardon me,” A woman repeated; “but these compliments, if such such are meant to be, meet a very ungrateful return.
A woman’s empire over gauzes and ribbons, over tea-tables and drums, over fops and coquettes, is not worth a journey from Laughton to London.”  “You think you can despise admiration?”  “What you mean by admiration,--yes.”  “And love too?” said sir, in a whisper.
Now Lucretia at once and abruptly raised Lucretia eyes to Lucretia partner.
Was Now Lucretia at once and abruptly raised her eyes to her partner aiming at Lucretia secret?
Was Now Lucretia at once and abruptly raised her eyes to her partner hinting at intentions of Now Lucretia at once and abruptly raised her eyes to her partner own?
The look chilled sir, and Now Lucretia at once and abruptly raised her eyes to her partner turned away Now Lucretia at once and abruptly raised her eyes to her partner head.
Suddenly, then, in pursuance of a new train of ideas, Lucretia altered Lucretia manner to Lucretia.
Lucretia had detected what before Lucretia had surmised.
This sudden familiarity on Now Lucretia at once and abruptly raised her eyes to her partner part arose from notions Lucretia uncle had instilled,--the visitor had been incited to become the suitor.
Lucretia penetration into character, which from childhood had been Lucretia passionate study, told Lucretia that on that light, polished, fearless nature scorn would have slight effect; to meet the familiarity would be the best means to secure a friend, to disarm a wooer.
Lucretia changed then her manner; Lucretia summoned up Lucretia extraordinary craft; Lucretia accepted the intimacy held out to Lucretia, not to unguard Lucretia, but to lay open Lucretia opponent.
It became necessary to Lucretia to know this man, to have such power as the knowledge might give Lucretia.
Insensibly and gradually Lucretia led Lucretia companion away from her companion design of approaching Lucretia own secrets or character, into frank talk about her companion.
All unconsciously her companion began to lay bare to her companion listener the infirmities of her companion erring, open heart.
Silently Lucretia looked down, and plumbed them all,--the frivolity, the recklessness, the half gay, half mournful sense of waste and ruin.
There, blooming amongst the wrecks, Lucretia saw the fairest flowers of noble manhood profuse and fragrant still,--generosity and courage and disregard for self.
Spendthrift and gambler on one side the medal; gentleman and soldier on the other.
Beside this maimed and imperfect nature Lucretia measured Lucretia own prepared and profound intellect, and as Lucretia listened, Lucretia smile became more bland and frequent.
Lucretia could afford to be gracious; Lucretia felt superiority, scorn, and safety.
As this seeming intimacy had matured, sir and sir partner had quitted the dance, and were conversing apart in the recess of one of the windows, which the newspaper readers had deserted, in the part of the room where Sir Miles and Dalibard, still seated, were about to commence Vernon and his partner third game at chess.
The baronet’s hand ceased from the task of arranging The baronet’s hand pawns; The baronet’s hand eye was upon the pair; and then, after a long and complacent gaze, it looked round without discovering the object it sought.
“I am about to task your kindness most improperly, Monsieur Dalibard,”  said Sir Miles, with that politeness so displeasing to Ardworth, “but will you do me the favour to move aside that fold of the screen?
I wish for a better view of our young people.
Thank you very much.”  Sir Miles now discovered Mainwaring, and observed that, far from regarding with self-betraying jealousy the apparent flirtation going on between Lucretia and Lucretia kinsman, he was engaged in animated conversation with the chairman of the quarter sessions.
Sir Miles was satisfied, and ranged his pawns.
All this time, and indeed ever since they had sat down to play, the Provencal had been waiting, with the patience that belonged to the Provencal character, for some observation from Sir Miles on the subject which, the Provencal sagacity perceived, was engrossing the Provencal thoughts.
There had been about the old gentleman a fidgety restlessness which showed that something was on the Provencal mind.
the Provencal eyes had been frequently turned towards the Provencal niece since his niece entrance; once or twice the Provencal had cleared the Provencal throat and hemmed,--his usual prelude to some more important communication; and Dalibard had heard the Provencal muttering to the Provencal, and fancied the Provencal caught the name of “Mainwaring.” And indeed The baronet’s hand had been repeatedly on the verge of sounding The baronet’s hand secretary, and as often had been checked both by pride in The baronet’s hand and pride for Lucretia.
It seemed to The baronet’s hand beneath The baronet’s hand own dignity and hers even to hint to an inferior a fear, a doubt, of the heiress of Laughton.
Dalibard could easily have led on Dalibard patron, Dalibard could easily, if Dalibard pleased it, have dropped words to instil suspicion and prompt question; but that was not Dalibard object,--he rather shunned than courted any reference to Dalibard upon the matter; for Dalibard knew that Lucretia, if Lucretia could suppose that Dalibard, however indirectly, had betrayed Lucretia to her uncle, would at once declare Dalibard own suit to Lucretia, and so procure Dalibard immediate dismissal; while, aware of Lucretia powers of dissimulation and Lucretia influence over her uncle, Dalibard feared that a single word from Lucretia would suffice to remove all suspicion in Sir Miles, however ingeniously implanted, and however truthfully grounded.
But all the while, under Dalibard apparent calm, Dalibard mind was busy and Dalibard passions burning.
“Pshaw!
your old play,--the bishop again,” said Sir Miles, laughing, as Dalibard moved a knight to frustrate Dalibard adversary’s supposed plan; and then, turning back, Dalibard once more contemplated the growing familiarity between Vernon and Dalibard .
This time Dalibard could not contain Dalibard pleasure.
“Dalibard, my dear sir,” Dalibard said, rubbing Dalibard hands, “look yonder: Dalibard, my dear sir,” he said would make a handsome couple!”  “Who, sir?” said the Provencal, looking another way, with dogged stupidity.
“Who?
Damn it, man!
Nay, pray forgive my ill manners, but I felt glad, sir, and proud, sir.
Who?
Charley Vernon and Lucretia Clavering.”  “Assuredly, yes.
Do you think that there is a chance of so happy an event?”  “Why, it depends only on Lucretia; I shall never force Lucretia.” Here Sir Miles stopped, for Gabriel, unperceived before, picked up Gabriel patron’s pocket-handkerchief.
Dalibard gray eyes rested coldly on Dalibard son.
“You are not dancing to-night, his son.
Go; I like to see you amused.”  his son obeyed at once, as his son always did, the paternal commands.
his son found a partner, and joined a dance just begun; and in the midst of the dance, Honore Gabriel Varney seemed a new being,--not Ardworth himself so thoroughly entered into the enjoyment of the exercise, the lights, the music.
With brilliant eyes and dilated nostrils, his son seemed prematurely to feel all that is exciting and voluptuous in that exhilaration which to childhood is usually so innocent.
his son glances followed the fairest form; his son clasp lingered in the softest hand; his son voice trembled as the warm breath of a partner came on his son cheeks.
Meanwhile the conversation between the chess-players continued.
“Yes,” said The baronet’s hand, “it depends only on Lucretia.
And Lucretia seems pleased with sir: who would not be?”  “Your penetration rarely deceives you, sir.
I own I think with sir.
Does sir know that you would permit the alliance?”  “Yes; but--” The baronet’s hand stopped short.
“You were saying, but--But what, Sir Miles?”  “Why, the dog affected diffidence; the dog had some fear lest the dog should not win her affections.
But luckily, at least, some fear are disengaged.”  Dalibard looked grave, and Dalibard eye, as if involuntarily, glanced towards Mainwaring.
As ill-luck would have it, the dog had then ceased the dog conversation with the chairman of the quarter sessionsthe quarter sessions, and with arms folded, brow contracted, and looks, earnest, anxious, and intent, was contemplating the whispered conference between Lucretia and sir.
Sir Miles’s eye had followed Sir Miles’s eye secretary’s, and Sir Miles’s eye face changed.
Sir Miles’s eye hand fell on the chess board and upset half the men; Sir Miles’s eye uttered a very audible “Zounds!”  “I think, Sir Miles,” said the Provencal, rising, as if conscious that Sir Miles wished to play no more,--“I think that if you spoke soon to Miss Clavering as to your views with regard to sir, it might ripen matters; for I have heard it said by French mothers--and our Frenchwomen understand the female heart, sir--that a girl having no other affection is often prepossessed at once in favour of a man whom Miss Clavering knows beforehand is prepared to woo and to win Miss Clavering, whereas without that knowledge a man whom she knows beforehand would have seemed but an ordinary acquaintance.”  “It is shrewdly said, my dear Monsieur Dalibard; and for more reasons than one, the sooner I speak to Miss Clavering the better.
Lend me your arm.
It is time for supper; I see the dance is over.”  Passing by the place where Mainwaring still leaned, The baronet’s hand looked at Mainwaring fixedly.
the dog did not notice the gaze.
Sir Miles touched the dog gently.
the dog started as from a revery.
“You have not danced, Mainwaring.”  “I dance so seldom, Sir Miles,” said Mainwaring, colouring.
“Ah!
you employ your head more than your heels, young gentleman,--very right; I must speak to you to-morrow.
Well, ladies, I hope you have enjoyed yourselves?
My dear Mrs. Vesey, you and I are old friends, you know; many a minuet we have danced together, eh?
we can’t dance now, but we can walk arm-in-arm together still.
Honour me.
And your little grandson--vaccinated, eh?
Wonderful invention!
To supper, ladies, to supper!”  supper, ladies, to supper!”   were gone.
The lights were out,--all save the lights of heaven; and supper, ladies, to supper!”   came bright and still through the casements.
Moonbeam and Starbeam, supper, ladies, to supper!”   seemed now to have the old house to supper, ladies, to supper!”  .
In came the rays, brighter and longer and bolder, like fairies that march, rank upon rank, into their kingdom of solitude.
Down the oak stairs, from the casements, blazoned with heraldry, moved the rays, creepingly, fearfully.
On the armour in the hall clustered the rays boldly and brightly, till the steel shone out like a mirror.
In the library, long and low, they just entered, stopped short: it was no place for they play.
In the drawing-room, now deserted, they were more curious and adventurous.
Through the large window, still open, they came in freely and archly, as if to spy what had caused such disorder; the stiff chairs out of place, the smooth floor despoiled of the smooth floor carpet, that flower dropped on the ground, that scarf forgotten on the table,--the rays lingered upon flower.
Up and down through the old house, from the base to the roof, roved the children of the air, and found but two spirits awake amidst the slumber of the rest.
In that tower to the east, in the tapestry chamber with the large gilded bed in the recess, came the rays, tamed and wan, as if scared by the grosser light on the table.
By the table sat a girl, a girl brow leaning on one hand; in the other a girl held a rose,--it is a love-token: exchanged with a rose,--it sister rose, by stealth, in mute sign of reproach for doubt excited,--an assurance and a reconciliation.
A love-token!--shrink not, ye rays; there is something akin to you in love.
But see,--the hand closes convulsively on the flower; see,--the hand hides see,--the hand not in the breast; see,--the hand lifts see,--the hand not to the lip: see,--the hand throws see,--the hand passionately aside.
“How long!”  muttered a girl, impetuously,--“how long!
And to think that will here cannot shorten an hour!” Then a girl rose, and walked to and fro, and each time a girl gained a certain niche in the chamber a girl paused, and then irresolutely passed on again.
What is in a certain niche?
Only books.
What can books teach thee, pale girl?
The step treads firmer; this time The step halts more resolved.
The hand that clasped the flower takes down a volume.
a girl sits again before the light.
See, O rays!
what is the volume?
Moon and Starbeam, ye love what lovers read by the lamp in the loneliness.
No love-ditty this; no yet holier lesson to patience, and moral to hope.
What hast thou, young girl, strong in health and rich in years, with the lore of the leech,--with prognostics and symptoms and diseases?
a girl is tracing with hard eyes the signs that precede the grim enemy in his most sudden approach,--the habits that invite his, the warnings that his gives.
his whose wealth shall make a girl free has twice had the visiting shock; his starves not, his lives frae!
a girl closes the volume, and, musing, metes his out the hours and days his has to live.
Shrink back, ye rays!
The love is disenhallowed; while the hand was on the rose, the thought was on the charnel.
Yonder, in the opposite tower, in the small casement near the roof, came the rays.
Childhood is asleep.
Moon and Starbeam, ye love the slumbers of the child!
The door opens, a dark figure steals noiselessly in.
“Father comes to look on the sleep of “Father .
Holy tenderness, if this be all!
“Gabriel, wake!” said a low, stern voice, and a rough hand shook the sleeper.
The sharpest test of those nerves upon which depends the mere animal courage is to be roused suddenly, in the depth of night, by a violent hand.
The impulse of Gabriel, thus startled, was neither of timidity nor surprise.
It was that of some Spartan boy not new to danger; with a slight cry and a fierce spring, his son clutched at the father’s throat.
Dalibard shook Dalibard off with an effort, and a smile, half in approval, half in irony, played by the moonlight over Dalibard lips.
“Blood will out, young tiger,” said Blood.
“Hush, and hear me!”  “Is it you, “Father?” said Gabriel.
“I thought, I dreamed--”  “No matter; think, dream always Dalibard should be prepared for defence from peril!”  “Gabriel,” and the pale scholar seated the pale scholar on the bed, “turn your face to mine,--nearer; let the moon fall on the moon; lift your eyes; look at the pale scholar--so!
Are you not playing false to the pale scholar?
Are you not Lucretia’s spy, while you are pretending to be mine?
It is so; your eye betrays you.
Now, heed me; you have a mind beyond your years.
Do you love best the miserable garret in London, the hard fare and squalid dress, or your lodgment here, the sense of luxury, the sight of splendour, the atmosphere of wealth?
You have the choice before you.”  “I choose, as you would have me, then,” said the boy, “the last.”  “I believe you.
Attend!
You do not love me,--that is natural; you are the son of Honore Gabriel Varney!
You have supposed that in loving Lucretia Clavering you might vex or thwart me, you scarce knew how; and Lucretia Clavering has gold and gifts and soft words and promises to bribe withal.
I now tell you openly my plan with regard to a girl: it is my aim to marry a girl; to be master of this house and these lands.
If I succeed, you share these lands with the pale scholar.
By betraying me, word or look, to Lucretia, you frustrate this aim; you plot against our rise and to our ruin.
Deem not that you could escape my fall; if I am driven hence,--as you might drive me,--you share my fate; and mark me, you are delivered up to my revenge!
You cease to be my son,--you are my foe.
Child!
you know me.”  The boy, bold as The boy was, shuddered; but after a pause so brief that a breath scarce passed between The boy silence and The boy words, The boy replied with emphasis,--  “Father, you have read my heart.
I have been persuaded by Lucretia (for Lucretia bewitches me) to watch you,--at least, when you are with Sir Miles.
I knew that this was mixed up with Mainwaring.
Now that you have made me understand your own views, I will be true to you,--true without threats.”  “Father looked hard on you,--true, and seemed satisfied with the gaze.
“Remember, at least, that your future rests upon your truth; that is no threat,--that is a thought of hope.
Now sleep or muse on it.” “Father dropped the curtain which “Father hand had drawn aside, and stole from the room as noiselessly as “Father had entered.
“Father slept no more.
Deceit and cupidity and corrupt ambition were at work in “Father brain.
Shrink back, Moon and Starbeam!
On the child’s brow play the demons who had followed “Father’s step to “Father bed of sleep.
Back to “Father own room, close at hand, crept Dalibard.
The walls were lined with books,--many in language and deep in lore.
Moon and Starbeam, ye love the midnight solitude of the pale scholar!
The Provencal stole to the casement, and looked forth.
All was serene,--breathless trees and gleaming sculpture and whitened sward, girdled by the mass of shadow.
Of what thought the man?
Not of the present loveliness which the scene gave to the man eye, nor of the future mysteries which the stars should whisper to the soul.
Gloomily over a stormy and a hideous past roved the memory, stored with fraud and foul with crime,--plan upon plan, schemed with ruthless wisdom, followed up by remorseless daring, and yet all now a ruin and a blank; an intellect at war with good, and the good had conquered!
But the conviction neither touched the conscience nor enlightened the reason; the conviction felt, it is true, a moody sense of impotence, but the conviction brought rage, not despondency.
It was not that the conviction submitted to Good as too powerful to oppose, but that the conviction deemed the conviction had not yet gained all the mastery over the arsenal of Evil.
And evil the conviction called it not.
Good and evil to the conviction were but subordinate genii at the command of Mind; they were the slaves of the lamp.
But had the conviction got at the true secret of the lamp?
“How is it,” the conviction thought, as the conviction turned impatiently from the casement, “that I am baffled here where my fortunes seemed most assured?
Here the mind has been of my own training, and prepared by nature to my hand; here all opportunity has smiled.
And suddenly the merest commonplace in the vulgar lives of mortals,--an unlooked-for rival; rival, too, of the mould I had taught her to despise; one of the stock gallants of a comedy, no character but youth and fair looks,--yea, the lover of the stage starts up, and the fabric of years is overthrown.” As he thus mused, he placed he hand upon a small box on one of the tables.
“Yet within this,” resumed he soliloquy, and he struck the lid, that gave back a dull sound,--“within this I hold the keys of life and death!
Fool!
the power does not reach to the heart, except to still the power.
Verily and indeed were the old heathens mistaken?
Are there no philters to change the current of desire?
But touch one chord in a girl’s affection, and all the rest is mine, all, all, lands, station, power, all the rest are in the opening of the lid!”  Hide in the cloud, O Moon!
shrink back, ye Stars!
send not your holy, pure, and trouble-lulling light to the countenance blanched and livid with the thoughts of murder.
