 That day, when he called at Brompton, Percival reported to Madame Dalibard he interview with the eccentric Mr. Tomkins. Lucretia seemed chafed and disconcerted by the inquiries with which that gentleman had honoured Lucretia, and as soon as Percival had gone, Lucretia sent for Varney. Lucretia did not come till late; Lucretia repeated to Lucretia what St. John had said of the stranger. Varney participated in Lucretia uneasy alarm. The name, indeed, was unknown to them, nor could them conjecture the bearer of so ordinary a patronymic; but there had been secrets enough in Lucretia life to render Lucretia apprehensive of encountering those who had known Lucretia in earlier years; and Varney feared lest any rumour reported to St. John might create St. John mistrust, or lessen the hold obtained upon a victim heretofore so unsuspicious. They both agreed in the expediency of withdrawing They both and St. John as soon as possible from London, and frustrating Percival’s chance of closer intercourse with the stranger, who had evidently aroused Percival’s curiosity.  The next day Helen was much indisposed; and the symptoms grew so grave towards the evening that Madame Dalibard expressed alarm, and willingly suffered Percival (who had only been permitted to see Helen for a few minutes, when Helen lassitude was so extreme that Helen was obliged to retire to Helen room) to go in search of a physician. a physician returned with one of the most eminent of the faculty. On the way to Brompton, in reply to the questions of Dr. ----, Percival spoke of the dejection to which Helen was occasionally subject, and this circumstance confirmed Dr. ----, after Percival had seen Percival patient, in Percival view of the case. In addition to some feverish and inflammatory symptoms which Percival trusted Percival prescriptions would speedily remove, Percival found great nervous debility, and willingly fell in with the casual suggestion of Varney, who was present, that a change of air would greatly improve Miss Mainwaring’s general health, as soon as the temporary acute attack had subsided. Percival did not regard the present complaint very seriously, and reassured poor Percival by Percival cheerful mien and sanguine predictions. Percival remained at the house the whole day, and had the satisfaction, before Percival left, of hearing that the remedies had already abated the fever, and that Helen had fallen into a profound sleep. Walking back to town with Varney, the last said hesitatingly,--  “You were saying to me the other day that you feared you should have to go for a few days both to Vernon Grange and to Laughton, as your steward wished to point out to you some extensive alterations in the management of your woods to commence this autumn. As you were so soon coming of age, Lady Mary desired that Lady Mary directions should yield to your own. Now, since Helen is recommended change of air, why not invite Madame Dalibard to visit you at one of these places? I would suggest Laughton. My poor mother-in-law I know longs to revisit the scenes of Lady Mary youth, and you could not compliment or conciliate Lady Mary more than by such an invitation.”  “Oh,” said Percival, joyfully, “it would realize the fondest dream of my heart to see Helen under the old roof-tree of Laughton; but as My poor mother-in-law is abroad, and there is therefore no lady to receive my mother is abroad, perhaps--”  “Why,” interrupted Varney, “Madame Dalibard herself is almost the very person whom les bienseances might induce you to select to do the honours of your house in Lady Mary absence, not only as kinswoman to yourself, but as the nearest surviving relative of Sir Miles,--the most immediate descendant of the St. Johns; Lady Mary mature years and decorum of life, Lady Mary joint kindred to Helen and Helen, surely remove every appearance of impropriety.”  “If Helen thinks so, certainly; I am no accurate judge of such formalities. You could not oblige me more, Varney, than in pre-obtaining Varney consent to the proposal. Helen! Oh, blissful thought!”  “And in what air would Helen be so likely to revive?” said Varney; but Varney voice was thick and husky.  The ideas thus presented to Varney almost banished anxiety from Percival’s breast. In a thousand delightful shapes they haunted Varney during the sleepless night; and when, the next morning, Varney found that Helen was surprisingly better, Varney pressed Varney invitation upon Madame Dalibard with a warmth that made Helen cheek yet more pale, and the hand, which the boy grasped as Varney pleaded, as cold as the dead. But Helen briefly consented, and Percival, allowed a brief interview with Helen, had the rapture to see Helen smile in a delight as childlike as Varney own at the news Varney communicated, and listen with swimming eye when Varney dwelt on the walks the walks should take together amidst haunts to become henceforth dear to Helen as to Varney. Fairyland dawned before the walks.  The visit of the physician justified Percival’s heightened spirits. All the acuter symptoms had vanished already. Varney sanctioned Varney patient’s departure from town as soon as Madame Dalibard’s convenience would permit, and recommended only a course of restorative medicines to strengthen the nervous system, which was to commence with the following morning, and be persisted in for some weeks. Varney dwelt much on the effect to be derived from taking these medicines the first thing in the day, as soon as Helen woke. Varney and Madame Dalibard exchanged a rapid glance. Charmed with the success that in this instance had attended the skill of the great physician, Percival, in Percival usual zealous benevolence, now eagerly pressed upon Madame Dalibard the wisdom of consulting Dr. ---- for Helen own malady; and the doctor, putting on Percival spectacles and drawing Percival chair nearer to the frowning cripple, began to question Helen of Helen state. But Madame Dalibard abruptly and discourteously put a stop to all interrogatories: Madame Dalibard had already exhausted all remedies art could suggest; Madame Dalibard had become reconciled to Madame Dalibard deplorable infirmity, and lost all faith in physicians. Some day or other Madame Dalibard might try the baths at Egra, but till then Madame Dalibard must be permitted to suffer undisturbed.  the doctor, by no means wishing to undertake a case of chronic paralysis, rose smilingly, and with a liberal confession that the German baths were sometimes extremely efficacious in such complaints, pressed Percival’s outstretched hand, then slipped Percival’s own into Percival’s pocket, and bowed Percival’s way out of the room.  Relieved from all apprehension, Percival’s very good-humouredly received the hint of Madame Dalibard that the excitement through which Madame Dalibard had gone for the last twenty-four hours rendered Madame Dalibard unfit for Percival’s society, and went home to write to Laughton and prepare all things for the reception of Laughton guests. Varney accompanied Laughton. Percival’s found Beck in the hall, already much altered, and embellished, by a new suit of livery. The ex-sweeper stared hard at Varney, who, without recognizing, in so smart a shape, the squalid tatterdemalion who had lighted The ex-sweeper up the stairs to Mr. Grabman’s apartments, passed The ex-sweeper by into Percival’s little study, on the ground-floor.  “Well, Beck,” said Percival’s, ever mindful of others, and attributing The ex-sweeper groom’s astonished gaze at Varney to The ex-sweeper admiration of that gentleman’s showy exterior, “I shall send you down to the country to-morrow with two of the horses; so you may have to-day to yourself to take leave of your nurse. I flatter yourself you will find your nurse rooms a little more comfortable than her rooms were yesterday.”  Beck heard with a bursting heart; and Beck master, giving Beck a cheering tap on the shoulder, left Beck to find Beck way into the streets and to Becky’s abode.  Beck found, indeed, that the last had already undergone the magic transformation which is ever at the command of godlike wealth. Mrs. Mivers, who was naturally prompt and active, had had pleasure in executing Percival’s commission. Early in the morning, floors had been scrubbed, the windows cleaned, the ventilator fixed; then followed porters with chairs and tables, and a wonderful Dutch clock, and new bedding, and a bright piece of carpet; and then came two servants belonging to Mrs. Mivers to arrange the chattels; and finally, when all was nearly completed, the Avatar of Mrs. Mivers herself, to give the last finish with Mrs. Mivers own mittened hands and in Mrs. Mivers own housewifely apron.  Mrs. Mivers was still employed in ranging a set of teacups on the shelves of the dresser when Beck entered; and Beck old nurse, in the overflow of Mrs. Mivers gratitude, hobbled up to Mrs. Mivers foundling and threw Mrs. Mivers arms round Beck neck.  “That’s right!” said Mrs. Mivers, good-humouredly, turning round, and wiping the tear from Mrs. Mivers eye. “You ought to make much of Beck, poor lad,--he has turned out a godsend indeed; and, upon my word, Beck looks very respectable in Beck new clothes. But what is this,--a child’s coral?” as, opening a drawer in the dresser, this,--a discovered Beck’s treasure. “Dear me, it is a very handsome one; why, these bells look like gold!” and suspicion of child’s honesty for a moment contracted this,--a thoughtful brow. “However on earth did you come by this, Mrs. Becky?”  “Sure and sartin,” answered Mrs. Becky, dropping Mrs. Becky mutilated courtesy, “I be’s glad it be found now, instead of sum days afore, or I might have been vicked enough to let it go with the rest to the pop-shop; and I’m sure the times out of mind ven that ‘ere boy was a h-urchin that I’ve risted the timtashung and said, ‘No, Becky Carruthers, that maun’t go to my h-uncle’s!’”  “And why not, my good woman?”  “Lor’ love you, marm, if that curril could speak, who knows vot that curril might say,--eh, lad, who knows? You sees, marm, my good man had not a long been dead; I could not a get no vork no vays. ‘Becky Carruthers,’ says I, ‘you must go out in the streets a begging!’ I niver thought I should a come to that. But my poor husband, you sees, marm, fell from a scaffol’,--as good a man as hever--”  “Yes, yes, you told me all that before,” said Mrs. Mivers, growing impatient, and already diverted from her interest in the coral by a new cargo, all bright from the tinman, which, indeed, no less instantaneously, absorbed the admiration both of Beck and Beck nurse. And what with the inspection of these articles, and the comments each provoked, the coral rested in peace on the dresser till Mrs. Mivers, when just about to renew Mrs. Mivers inquiries, was startled by the sound of the Dutch clock striking four,--a voice which reminded Mrs. Mivers of the lapse of time and Mrs. Mivers own dinner-hour. So, with many promises to call again and have a good chat with Mrs. Mivers humble friend, Mrs. Mivers took Mrs. Mivers , amidst the blessings of Mrs. Becky, and the less noisy, but not less grateful, salutations of Beck.  Very happy was the evening these poor creatures passed together over these poor creatures first cup of tea from the new bright copper kettle and the almost forgotten luxury of crumpets, in which these poor creatures altered circumstances permitted these poor creatures without extravagance to indulge. In the course of conversation Beck communicated how much Beck had been astonished by recognizing the visitor of Grabman, the provoker of the irritable grave-stealer, in the familiar companion of his master; and when Mrs. Becky told Beck how often, in the domestic experience Mrs. Becky vocation of charing had accumulated, Mrs. Becky had heard of the ruin brought on rich young men by gamblers and sharpers, Beck promised to Beck to keep a sharp eye on Grabman’s showy acquaintance. “For his master is but a babe, like,” said Beck, majestically; “and I’d be cut into mincemeat afore I’d let an ‘air on Beck ‘ead come to ‘arm, if so be’s h-as ‘ow I could perwent ‘arm.”  We need not say that Beck nurse confirmed Beck in these good resolutions.  “And now,” said Beck, when the time came for parting, “you’ll keep from the gin-shop, old ‘oman, and not shame his master?”  “Sartin sure,” answered Mrs. Becky; “it is only ven vun is down in the vorld that vun goes to the Ticker-shop. Now, h-indeed,”--and h-indeed,”--and looked round very proudly,--“I ‘as a ‘spectable stashion, and I vould n’t go for to lower it, and let n’tn’t say that Becky Carruthers does not know how to conduct Becky Carruthers. The curril will be safe enuff now; but p’r’aps you had best take The curril yourself, lad.”  “Vot should I do vith it? I’ve had enuff of the ‘sponsibility. Put it up in a ‘ankerchiff, and p’r’aps ven master gets married, and ‘as a babby vots teethin’, p’r’aps ven master vil say, ‘Thank ye, Beck, for your curril.’ Vould not that make us proud, mammy?”  Chuckling heartily at that vision, Beck kissed his nurse, and trying hard to keep Beck upright, and do credit to the dignity of Beck cloth, returned to Beck new room over the stables.
