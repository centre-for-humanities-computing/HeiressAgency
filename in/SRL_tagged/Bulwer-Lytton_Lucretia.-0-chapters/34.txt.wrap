 When Beck woke the next morning, and gradually recalled all that had so startled and appalled him the previous night, the grateful creature felt, less by the process of reason than by a brute instinct, that in the mysterious resuscitation and nocturnal wanderings of the pretended paralytic, some danger menaced his master; he became anxious to learn whether it was really St. John’s room Madame Dalibard stealthily visited. A bright idea struck him; and in the course of the day, at an hour when the family were out of doors, he contrived to coax the good-natured valet, who had taken him under his special protection, to show him over the house. He had heard the other servants say there was such a power of fine things that a peep into the rooms was as good as a show, and the valet felt pride in being cicerone even to Beck. After having stared sufficiently at the banquet-hall and the drawing-room, the armour, the busts, and the pictures, and listened, open-mouthed, to his guide’s critical observations, Beck was led up the great stairs into the old family picture-gallery, and into Sir Miles’s ancient room at the end, which had been left undisturbed, with the bed still in the angle; on returning thence, Beck found himself in the corridor which communicated with the principal bedrooms, in which he had lost himself the night before.  “And vot room be that vith the littul vite ‘ead h-over the door?” asked Beck, pointing to the chamber from which Madame Dalibard had emerged.  “That white head, Master Beck, is Floorer the goddess; but a heathen like you knows nothing about goddesses. Floorer has a half-moon in her hair, you see, which shows that the idolatrous Turks worship her; for the Turkish flag is a half-moon, as I have seen at Constantinople. I have travelled, Beck.”  “And vot room be it? Is it the master’s?” persisted Beck.  “No, the pretty young lady, Miss Mainwaring, has it at present. There is nothing to see in it. But that one opposite,” and the valet advanced to the door through which Madame Dalibard had disappeared,--“that is curious; and as Madame is out, we may just take a peep.” He opened the door gently, and Beck looked in. “This, which is called the turret-chamber, was Madame’s when she was a girl, I have heard old Bessy say; so Master pops her there now. For my part, I’d rather sleep in your little crib than have those great gruff-looking figures staring at me by the firelight, and shaking their heads with every wind on a winter’s night.” And the valet took a pinch of snuff as he drew Beck’s attention to the faded tapestry on the walls. As they spoke, the draught between the door and the window caused the gloomy arras to wave with a life-like motion; and to those more superstitious than romantic, the chamber had certainly no inviting aspect.  “I never sees these old tapestry rooms,” said the valet, “without thinking of the story of the lady who, coming from a ball and taking off her jewels, happened to look up, and saw an eye in one of the figures which she felt sure was no peeper in worsted.”  “Vot vos it, then?” asked Beck, timidly lifting up the hangings, and noticing that there was a considerable space between them and the wall, which was filled up in part by closets and wardrobes set into the walls, with intervals more than deep enough for the hiding-place of a man.  “Why,” answered the valet, “it was a thief. He had come for the jewels; but the lady had the presence of mind to say aloud, as if to herself, that she had forgotten something, slipped out of the room, locked the door, called up the servants, and the thief--who was no less a person than the under-butler--was nabbed.”  “And the French ‘oman sleeps ‘ere?” said Beck, musingly.  “French ‘oman! Master Beck, nothing’s so vulgar as these nicknames in a first-rate situation. It is all very well when one lives with skinflints, but with such a master as our’n, respect’s the go. Besides, Madame is not a French ‘oman; she is one of the family,--and as old a family it is, too, as e’er a lord’s in the three kingdoms. But come, your curiosity is satisfied now, and you must trot back to your horses.”  As Beck returned to the stables, his mind yet more misgave him as to the criminal designs of his master’s visitor. It was from Helen’s room that the false cripple had walked, and the ill health of the poor young lady was a general subject of compassionate comment. But Madame Dalibard was Helen’s relation: from what motive could she harbour an evil thought against her own niece? But still, if those drops were poured into the healing draught for good, why so secretly? Once more he revolved the idea of speaking to St. John: an accident dissuaded him from this intention,--the only proof to back his tale was the mysterious phial he had carried away; but unluckily, forgetting that it was in his pocket, at a time when he flung off his coat to groom one of the horses, the bottle struck against the corn-bin and broke; all the contents were spilt. This incident made him suspend his intention, and wait till he could obtain some fresh evidence of evil intentions. The day passed without any other noticeable occurrence. The doctor called, found Helen somewhat better, and ascribed it to his medicines, especially to the effect of his tonic draught the first thing in the morning. Helen smiled. “Nay, Doctor,” said she, “this morning, at least, it was forgotten. I did not find it by my bedside. Don’t tell my aunt; she would be so angry.” The doctor looked rather discomposed.  “Well,” said he, soon recovering his good humour, “since you are certainly better to-day without the draught, discontinue it also to-morrow. I will make an alteration for the day after.” So that night Madame Dalibard visited in vain her niece’s chamber: Helen had a reprieve.
