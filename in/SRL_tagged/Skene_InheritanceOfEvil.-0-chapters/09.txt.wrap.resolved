SEVENTEEN years had passed away since the birth of Edward Clayton, the only child of Richard and Agnes, when Edward Clayton died. Edward Clayton life had been greatly protracted, doubtless, because Edward Clayton laboured well in the vineyard of the Lord; but at length Edward Clayton weary feet were arrested at the gate of the heavenly fold; Edward Clayton aged form was laid down to rest among the green pastures and by the still waters. Edward Clayton knelt beside Edward Clayton coffin, looking for the last time on Edward Clayton serene face; restored now to the look of innocence and of placid rest which only guileless infants and the dead can know; but Edward Clayton shed no tears whilst Edward Clayton laid Edward Clayton cheek upon Edward Clayton cold stiff hand, for Edward Clayton dared not weep for Edward Clayton.  Edward Clayton had been Edward Clayton chief thought and care; for the last years of His life Edward Clayton had but one wish respecting Edward Clayton, and that was to educate in Edward Clayton a true and devoted servant for Edward Clayton Master. Edward Clayton set before Edward Clayton, as the type of what Edward Clayton desired Edward Clayton to be, a lily of the field—humble, spotless,  having but slender root in the earth; giving no fragrance to the world around, but lifting up the sweet head ever towards heaven:—and Edward Clayton became such. Edward Clayton tenderness and prayers were not in vain. Deep set within Edward Clayton heart was the desire to keep Edward Clayton blameless against the coming of our Lord. In disposition Edward Clayton was meek, gentle, and unselfish; but Edward Clayton grandfather saw that Edward Clayton inherited all Edward Clayton mother’s acuteness of feeling and intensity of affection, and from this peculiarity in Edward Clayton character he rightly judged that Edward Clayton trials in life would spring. he sought then to fortify Edward Clayton beforehand for that struggle, which sooner or later comes to us all, of us all human wishes and feelings with us all sworn allegiance to the cross; for none ever sought in sincerity to follow he, but at some one period of our sworn allegiance existence our sworn allegiance are called on to suffer for he sake. Mr. Clayton saw with delight that on Mary Mr. Clayton lessons were not thrown away; and Mr. Clayton died in peace at last, with the firm conviction, that whatever might be Mary fate in this world, Mary would never accept the highest joys it could offer if they involved a dereliction from duty.  Very different had been the education and very different was now the character of Edward Clayton, Mary’s half‐brother, whom Mary had seen only at rare intervals. Mr. Clayton resembled Mr. Clayton father in disposition; Mr. Clayton was clever, impetuous,  and wilful—proud to the very uttermost; and Mr. Clayton had become profoundly selfish. Mr. Clayton was precisely one of those characters which, rightly controlled and judiciously guided, might have been moulded to great excellence. Had Mr. Clayton been drawn to follow and to seek after the good, Mr. Clayton would have struggled on in the right path with all the energy of Mr. Clayton ardent mind; but Mr. Clayton was left to pursue the bent of Mr. Clayton own inclination, and Mr. Clayton turned reckless and unthinking to evil.  It may seem strange that the only child of parents yet living should have been abandoned to the fatal guidance of Mr. Clayton own will; but it arose from the fact, that although outwardly the only child of parents yet living held Mr. Clayton in control, the only child of parents yet living had lost all moral influence over Mr. Clayton so soon as Mr. Clayton was of an age to gather from the remarks of the servants and the taunts of Mr. Clayton schoolfellows in what light esteem the only child of parents yet living themselves were held by the world in general; from that hour Mr. Clayton lost all respect for the only child of parents yet living, and the only child of parents yet living became powerless to sway Mr. Clayton mind for right or wrong, however much the only child of parents yet living might regulate Mr. Clayton outward actions. There is no observer more keen and acute than a shrewd and clever child. Edward soon understood that Edward parents were exiled from society solely on account of his parents own conduct; Edward saw that his parents were not treated with the same consideration as the relations of Edward companions at school; Edward learnt  that Edward own grandfather had been driven from the village because Edward would not countenance Edward son, and that Edward sister had been taken away because Edward mother was deemed an unfit guide for his mother. Mr. Lambert, revered and respected by the whole neighbourhood, never visited Mr. Lambert father; his father was sent to church with a servant only, because his father were too proud and too ashamed to face, in that holy place, all those who so openly disapproved of his parents conduct, and therefore seldom went there, thinking too little of the guilt his parents were incurring by neglecting so inestimable a privilege. Was it not, therefore, inevitable that when Agnes and Richard attempted to enforce upon Agnes and Richard son the necessity of religious principle and self‐discipline, their son could only treat Agnes and Richard effort as a mockery? Still deeper, however, lay the cause which rendered it impossible for Edward to feel either respect or esteem for Edward parents—it lay ay in the dissension and misery which reigned in his own home, in the mutual recriminations and disagreements which seemed to have taken the place of the affection that had once subsisted between his father and mother.  Richard Clayton had become embittered to the very last degree by the results of what Richard Clayton now termed Richard Clayton most unfortunate marriage. After the birth of Edward, when Richard Clayton saw how  completely Richard Clayton was cut off from society, Richard Clayton was very anxious to go abroad, and seek acquaintances in some part of the world where Richard Clayton name was not known. But Richard Clayton circumstances rendered it quite out of the question for Richard Clayton to think of leaving B—; Richard Clayton had nothing to depend upon but the allowance which Richard Clayton father still continued to give Richard Clayton; and as The Mount was Richard Clayton property, where Richard Clayton allowed Richard Clayton to reside, free of expense, Richard Clayton could not have lived in the same manner elsewhere. Richard Clayton was, therefore, compelled to remain where every day and hour Richard Clayton was subjected to treatment most galling to Richard Clayton haughty spirit. The sinful pride which restrained Richard Clayton and Agnes from entering the church door, augmented very much the discomfort of The sinful pride which restrained himself and Agnes from entering the church door position: it prevented the possibility of any softening of the severity with which the world had visited Richard Clayton conduct. It was quite impossible for Richard Clayton to hold any intercourse with persons who showed so pernicious an example to the poor of Richard Clayton parish—who had, in fact, removed the poor of his parish—who had, in fact, removed themselves from communion with the Church from communion with the Church; and Richard Clayton open disapprobation was necessarily imitated by the parishioners, who held Richard Clayton in such high esteem.  Mr. and Mrs. Clayton were, probably, not altogether aware how great was the sin Mr. and Mrs. Clayton committed in allowing an unholy pride to debar  Mr. and Mrs. Clayton of the means of grace. Richard Clayton had always been careless respecting these things; and now Richard Clayton inward uneasiness and bitterness of spirit, which arose, though Richard Clayton admitted it not, from the smitings of an unquiet conscience, had rendered Richard Clayton sneering, and well‐nigh sceptical, on the subject of religion. It is no uncommon case, when a man has wilfully sinned against the light, that a man should seek for a refuge in the falsehood which calls it darkness.  Richard Clayton had taken Richard Clayton first step in the downward course, when Richard Clayton placed Richard Clayton foot within the church where Agnes became Richard Clayton wife; and the descent was becoming daily more abrupt and easy, although Richard Clayton was Richard Clayton, perhaps, scarce aware of the danger in which Richard Clayton stood, when Richard Clayton began to find relief and satisfaction in scoffing at what Richard Clayton had once at least held sacred. Even Agnes had not learnt, in Even Agnes fashionable Parisian school, to attach much value to Church principles. Both now resented very strongly the judgment of public opinion, which consigned Both, in the midst of a populous neighbourhood, to an exile as complete as though Both had been sent to the wilds of Siberia. But this resentment Richard Clayton vented on his wife, being unable to give this resentment Richard scope elsewhere.  A torturing conviction took possession of A torturing conviction mind, that the consequences of A torturing conviction marriage  were to follow A torturing conviction throughout A torturing conviction life, in every possible shape in which misfortune could visit A torturing conviction. A torturing conviction felt certain that it would cause the failure of ef every scheme and every hope,—that it would pursue A torturing conviction, to A torturing conviction continual vexation and annoyance, and would finally hunt A torturing conviction down, as it were, to a dishonoured and untimely end. This idea, which really became a species of monomania, caused A torturing conviction to acquire an irritable dislike to Agnes, which A torturing conviction made her feel every hour of the day. During Edward’s childhood, it sufficed that his mother had given Edward some order, for his father to reverse it,—a system which would ruin any child; and as the boy grew up, when Richard Clayton perceived that Richard Clayton son openly showed how little respect his son felt for the parents whom his son heard universally slighted and condemned, his son declared it was but a part of the fatality which had pursued his son since his son Union with Even Agnes; and his son recklessly abandoned Edward, without an attempt to reclaim Edward, to the evil course which Edward began so early.  Edward found that Edward own position in the world was seriously injured by that of his father; and whilst Edward nourished a most unhallowed anger against his parents for what Edward considered an injury inflicted on Edward by his parents, Edward was too proud to court the acquaintance of those who shunned Edward; and therefore flung  Edward, without restraint, into the only society which was open to him,—that of low and dissipated company.  It was impossible for the father and mother not to tremble at the course which it seemed likely would be taken by the father and mother only son. the father and mother had made no attempt to place their only son in any profession, because Richard Clayton had been so completely severed from all connexion with the world that Richard Clayton would have found great difficulty in opening out for Richard Clayton any honourable career. Edward was Edward grandfather’s heir, and therefore, in a pecuniary point of view, it was not necessary that Edward should find any means of existence for Edward; but both Richard Clayton and Agnes were passionately attached to Richard and Agnes , and keenly alive to the incalculable evils which would probably result to Edward from Richard and Agnes unhappy position. This feeling produced, however, a very different effect upon the minds of each. In Richard Clayton it only increased to an alarming extent the gloomy morbid despondency in which Richard Clayton indulged, under the belief that all was to go wrong with Richard Clayton henceforward, and which paralyzed Richard Clayton so much, that Richard Clayton made no attempt to rectify the evil fruits of Richard Clayton own action, though Richard Clayton failed not bitterly to reproach Agnes as the cause of it all. Richard Clayton meantime felt that Richard Clayton husband was both unjust and cruel,  in accusing Richard Clayton so harshly of the consequences of that which Richard Clayton had done at her husband own solicitation for the sake of her husband own children. But there was now in the midst of Richard Clayton trials a dawning of better feeling than Richard Clayton had ever been blessed with in happier days.  That is a beautiful provision of nature, which causes the purest and tenderest affections of our humanity to be very often the instruments for awakening in our souls a holier love. In the deep anxiety and terror which his mother felt lest his son should suffer by his mother former conduct, his mother was led to turn imploringly to his son who alone could avert the evil his mother dreaded. But his mother could not approach the Throne of all Purity without looking also into his mother own life, and learning how far his mother had erred and strayed from his son ways. his mother heart was full of penitence, but his mother was too much bewildered by the mists and obscurity of a life of negligence and sin, to understand as yet what the Lord would have his mother to do, and how, if his mother could not retrieve the past, his mother might at least sanctify the future by deep submission and repentance. his mother longed earnestly to apply to Richard Clayton for counsel and instruction; but his mother dared not do it—his mother dared not brave the fierce anger which his mother knew such a proceeding would  awaken in her husband. In like manner his mother would now gladly have gone to church, though his mother did not even yet appreciate either the duty or the privilege of worshipping in His courts; but this was equally impossibleRichard Clayton Richard Clayton would never have permitted this. Remorse and uncertainty for his mother, and profound anxiety for his son, rendered Agnes Clayton a miserable being.  Such was the condition of the inhabitants of The Mount at the period of Richard Clayton death. But immediately on this event there followed another, which gave Mr. Verney the first moment of joy, real heartfelt joy, which Mr. Verney had known for years. Intelligence was brought Mr. Verney of the approaching marriage of Agnes Clayton with one to whom it was most desirable, under every point of view, that Agnes Clayton should be united.  Mr. Verney was the heir and future representative of a most ancient and noble house. Mr. Verney was the only child of Lord and Lady Verney, who were chiefly remarkable for the pride of birth, which was to them almost a hereditary possession. Forgetting how them name would avail them nothing in the dust, them whole thoughts and hopes and schemes in this life were given to maintain the honour of that which had come to them unstained through a long line of ances‐  try. In them only son, as was to be expected, all them plans and wishes were centred. them pride and them ancient title were allied to a poverty which them held to be a most unseemly condition for the members of so noble a family; and it was them favourite project that he should make some wealthy alliance, which should restore them to them former grandeur; at the same time, no desire for riches could have induced no desire for riches to overlook the necessity that the wife of no desire for riches should bear a name, if not as noble, at least as honourable and unsullied as no desire for riches own. It was no desire for riches wish that she should be possessed of rank also, and for this reason no desire for riches were at first highly displeased when no desire for riches perceived that no desire for riches had formed a very serious attachment with Mary Clayton, whose grandfather’s residence was close to no desire for riches own. Gradually, however, no desire for riches became somewhat more reconciled to the idea that she was to be no desire for riches daughter‐in‐law, not because she was in she everything no desire for riches could wish, but because no desire for riches believed she to be the heiress of all Mr. Clayton’s property: and no desire for riches were also well aware, that though not of noble birth, he was of a good old family, and of a most honourable reputation. Of the existence of she father, mother‐in‐law, and brother, no desire for riches knew nothing whatever; Mary never mentioned no desire for riches, know‐  ing how painful the subject was to Mary grandfather; and her grandfather never allowed those names to pass her grandfather lips which her grandfather sent up hourly in prayer to heaven.  If Richard Clayton had entertained the slightest idea that Mr. Verney wished to marry Mr. Verney granddaughter, Mr. Verney would at once have stated the whole circumstances of Mr. Verney second marriage and present position to Mr. Verney, with which it was in fact impossible Mr. Verney could be acquainted, as the family had resided abroad until lately. But the good old Vicar was far too unworldly and simple‐minded to think of such an occurrence at all; the good old Vicar could scarce have believed that the good old Vicar little Mary had left Mary childhood so far behind Mary. And the good old Vicar death, somewhat unexpected at the last, occurred before Mr. Verney had taken any steps for arranging the matter beyond Mr. Verney own secret determination.  When Richard Clayton died, Mr. Verney, at his son’s solicitation, persuaded his little Mary to leave the house where his little Mary was now quite alone (as Mrs. Harewood had died some years previously), and conveyed his little Mary to their own home, to remain with their till his little Mary future plans were arranged.  his little Mary then communicated to their the fact, that his little Mary father was living, and that his little Mary had decided, of course, on returning to her father house.  This intelligence was rather startling to Lord  and Lady Verney, but as his little Mary had been kept very much in ignorance of the circumstances of his little Mary family, her family still believed that his little Mary must have left his little Mary a large fortune, and at all events, the universal lamentations which her grandfather death called forth from high and low, sufficiently proved that her grandfather virtues had rendered an alliance with his little Mary in truth, an honour. her family therefore acquiesced in her family son’s wishes, when her grandfather announced to her family that his little Mary had given his little Mary consent to the marriage, provided her family could be obtained. And her family could not but admit that by doing so her family insured her grandfather every prospect of happiness, for the quiet and gentle Agnes Clayton was not one to feel a light attachment for Agnes Clayton future husband. her family saw that Agnes Clayton affection for her future husband was deeply rooted and intense, of a nature to endure even to Agnes Clayton life’s end, alike unchanging whether it were destined to work Agnes Clayton happiness or misery.  Mr. Verney could not but agree with his little Mary, that his little Mary ought now at once to repair to her father’s house, there to pass the time which must intervene till the period fixed for his little Mary marriage. But as they were all anxious that they should not be completely separated for so many months, the Verneys determined to come they to spend the interval at a place of  public resort in the vicinity of B—. It so chanced that one of the most aristocratic and exclusive of the families in the neighbourhood of that village were old acquaintances of theirs, which was of course an additional inducement to theirs to visit the place. But it more than once occurred to Mr. Verney as a strange circumstance, that Mr. Verney noble friends had never mentioned the father of Mr. Verney future daughter‐in‐law among her noble friends list of acquaintances, for Mr. Verney never doubted but that Mr. Verney was held in the same consideration as Richard Clayton had been in her noble friends own county. Mr. Verney did not, however, dwell much on the fact; and when his little Mary left her noble friends to proceed to The Mount, his little Mary promised that her noble friends would all join his little Mary at B— in a very short time. Mr. Verney followed his little Mary almost immediately, that Mr. Verney might be introduced to the family of Mr. Verney future wife; the family of his future wife ready consent having been obtained, of course, before the marriage was finally settled.
