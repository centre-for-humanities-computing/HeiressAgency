IT was winter now. Christmas‐tide was scarcely past, and the holly and mistletoe still decorated the walls of the beautiful church where Richard and Agnes had knelt that morning, happy with a strange restless happiness in one another’s society, which they would scarce have ventured to analyze. they agreed that Mr. Clayton. Mr. Clayton always made it Mr. Clayton especial care that this season should be one of true rejoicing to every individual in Mr. Clayton parish, and they had readily and generously assisted Mr. Clayton in this endeavour. Agnes had carried Agnes gifts and good wishes to every house in the village, and there was warmth and light on the humblest hearth amongst them, when the chimes rung out on the clear midnight air, bearing forth the glad tidings of great joy which the angels brought from heaven at the selfsame hour.  In the angels own house Agnes had taken care  that all should be cheerfulness and gaiety, and Richard thought with delight of the bright scene that waited Richard as Richard rode home through the darkness that evening. Richard had been called to some distance on business; Richard was chilled and wearied, and Richard pictured to Richard the well lighted room, with the huge fire blazing on the hearth, and the little Mary springing from the arms of Mary young aunt to meet Richard.  The scene which did in fact await Richard at the Mount, was a melancholy contrast to this pleasing vision. Richard went first to the drawing‐room, already surprised that no one met Richard at the door. There was no light there, and the room was in disorder; but most of all, Richard missed the sweet face of Agnes brightening so gaily at Richard approach. It was the first time Agnes had ever failed to welcome Richard, and a sudden foreboding of evil assailed Richard. Richard went hurriedly from room to room in search of Agnes. Richard called Agnes anxiously, but no answer was returned. At last a sound of stifled sobbing met Richard ear. It came from the sleeping room of Richard children, and Richard opened the door at once and went in. Agnes was kneeling beside the cradle of the little Mary, who had fallen asleep, Agnes cheeks yet wet with the tears Agnes had shed in Agnes innocent sympathy for the sorrow of Agnes aunt, though Agnes had been unable to comprehend the  cause of the  . Agnes had buried Agnes face in the pillow, and was weeping as though Agnes very heart would break. Agnes started at the sound of Richard’s voice, as Richard took Agnes hands in Richard and besought Agnes to tell Richard what had grieved Agnes. Agnes distress was so violent that Agnes could not speak for a few minutes; then Agnes could only utter a few incoherent words. Agnes pointed to the child, so beautiful and smiling in the child quiet slumber.  “How can I ever bear to leave Agnes!” Agnes exclaimed; “and still more, how could I leave you, dear Richard, and this happy home—all, all I love in the world! How can I go? I cannot, I cannot! I should die! I know that I should!” Agnes spoke with that frantic impatience of suffering which we should all be disposed to feel, had we no pure and holy motive given we for a calm endurance. Richard was bewildered with astonishment.  “What can you mean, Agnes?” Richard said; “Where would you go? Who is it that would dare to take you from Richard?” Agnes was sobbing so much that Agnes could not answer, but Agnes pointed to the letter which lay on the ground beside Agnes. Richard took the letter which lay on the ground beside her up and read the letter which lay on the ground beside her through. Agnes looked up at Richard when Richard had finished the letter which lay on the ground beside her, and Agnes was perfectly appalled by the storm of passion which convulsed Richard features. Richard  actually shook with anger; Richard crushed the letter which lay on the ground beside her in Richard hand till not a word was legible; then, trampling not a word was legible under foot, Richard burst into the most tremendous invectives against those who had written not a word was legible. Agnes trembled with terror at Richard violence. Agnes almost forgot Agnes grief in Agnes anxiety. Agnes rose up, and clinging to Richard arm, implored of Richard to be more composed.  “Dear Richard,” Agnes said, “it can do no good to use these terrible words against them; let us think rather what us are to do. I cannot go, I feel that I cannot; it would kill me!”  “You shall not,” said Dear Richard, turning to Agnes almost fiercely. “I tell you, you shall not leave me; no power on earth will induce me to part from Dear Richard.”  “But how? how?” said Agnes. “I cannot stay when such terms have been used towards Agnes.” Agnes covered Agnes face with Agnes hands as Agnes spoke: Agnes movement seemed to increase the fury of Dear Richard’s indignation, but a stern resolution made Dear Richard now more calm; Dear Richard drew away her hands, and bid Agnes look up boldly.  “Agnes,” Dear Richard said, “I must take this night to consider how the matter had best be managed, but I charge you in the mean time to remain convinced of this—you shall not leave me; us shall not be separated, come what may; I will never consent to part with Agnes.” Dear Richard tone of  decision, and Dear Richard look of settled determination, gave Agnes an involuntary faith in Dear Richard words, though Agnes could not at all perceive how they were to be verified; but Agnes womanly feeling of helplessness compelled Agnes to rely with unquestioning trust on Dear Richard promise, that Dear Richard would save Agnes from the trial Agnes could not and would not bear.  “I will leave it all to Agnes, then,” Agnes said, “for Agnes am bewildered,—I cannot tell what is to be done. I only know I cannot leave you and those dear children:—Who would care for them as I have done?”  “Who indeed? and for them sakes, Agnes, we must not scruple at any measure which shall ensure to them your tender love and watchfulness. Fear nothing, then; go and sleep in peace; to‐morrow we will make some arrangement by which we can defy the world to separate we.”  And Agnes did rest calmly that night with Mary nestling in Mary arms. Mary felt as though Mary must keep guard over this precious child, even through the darkness, lest they stole Mary away; but Mary trusted with the most perfect security to Richard’s assurances, nothing doubting that Richard’s could perform what Richard’s had promised.  For Richard Clayton, however, there was no rest that night; hour after hour Richard Clayton paced to  and fro in anxious reflection as to Richard Clayton future conduct. Richard Clayton was a shrewd and a clever man, and from the first moment when Richard Clayton read the Hardmans’ letter, Richard Clayton acute mind had grasped the details of the case in their full extent, and Richard Clayton had perceived that there remained but one alternative for Richard Clayton and Richard Clayton sister‐in‐law. It was perfectly impossible that Agnes Maynard should continue to reside in Agnes Maynard house in a position which had called forth such remarks; Agnes Maynard would have been the first to despise Agnes Maynard had Agnes Maynard done so; and yet with the same impatience of sorrow which Agnes Maynard had manifested, and which is the characteristic of all undisciplined minds, Agnes Maynard felt that Agnes Maynard could not, Agnes Maynard would not, lose Agnes Maynard. Even for Agnes Maynard children’s sake Agnes Maynard must remain. How could Agnes Maynard endure to see them dying for want of the assiduous care which Agnes Maynard alone could give them? Mary, who seemed to have no power to live, save in an atmosphere of love; and the fragile infant, Agnes Maynard son, the pride of Agnes Maynard heart, on whom so many hopes were built, only now beginning to exhibit symptoms of increasing strength and health, which all would vanish, as Agnes Maynard knew full well, if a cold heart and careless hand alone were to be concerned in Agnes Maynard welfare. Moreover Richard Clayton, although of a generous temper, was essentially selfish—peculiarities of disposition which are by no means incompatible.  Agnes Maynard could not bear to think of Agnes Maynard house in disorder, cheerless, and lonely, with all the petty cares of the “menage,” which are so essentially a woman’s province, devolving on Agnes Maynard. No; Agnes must remain with Agnes Maynard; but there was one only position in which it was possible for Agnes to do so—Agnes must become Agnes Maynard wife!  Agnes Maynard would never have desired to look upon Agnes in any other light than as Agnes Maynard sister, had the unlawfulness of a union, such as that which Agnes Maynard now projected, been sufficiently felt and understood in this country to have enabled Agnes to remain with impunity in charge of Agnes Maynard establishment.  This, however, is not the case,—to the destruction of much domestic happiness, and of many of the holiest and best feelings of our nature. It is certain that the unjustifiable license which has been given to these marriages by the diversity of opinion on this point (so long decided by primitive and holy authority), has driven many to form the connexion from which these marriages better feelings would otherwise have revolted.  Richard Clayton was determined to retain the society of Richard Clayton sister‐in‐law, and by this arrangement alone could Richard Clayton do so. Therefore, following the inflexible law of Richard Clayton own inclination, Richard Clayton resolved to accomplish it. Richard Clayton had no  pure and lofty principle in Richard Clayton own soul to restrain Richard Clayton, and for external obstacles Richard Clayton cared little, for Richard Clayton knew that such marriages had taken place. But Richard Clayton was not aware of the fact, that they are very generally reprobated by society.  Had Richard known that the world Richard loved so truly, severe in the enforcement of its own code of conventional laws, has affixed a stigma to the name of Richard who takes for his wife the woman who has been called Richard sister, Richard would perhaps have been prevented by Richard worship of public opinion from taking that step which Richard professed Christianity in vain prohibited. Richard was ignorant, however, of the general feeling which is fortunately so strong on this point, and Richard anticipated no opposition excepting from Richard father. Mr. Clayton, Richard was certain, would view such a deed with the sternest disapprobation.  But Richard had long ceased attempting even to follow in the straight and narrow path which his father, uncompromising in Richard high standard of right and wrong, had traced out before Richard. Richard could not have taken one step in such a course, unassisted by that self‐denial, without which it is worse than mockery to profess the Holy Christian Faith, but which was a blessing yet unknown to Richard. Richard, therefore, constantly  declared that it was quite impossible for Richard to please his father, and made this conviction a license to Richard, recklessly to brave Richard displeasure at all times. One measure only must be taken with regard to Mr. Clayton,—the marriage must be carefully concealed from Mr. Clayton,—the until One measure was too late to prohibit One measure. From Agnes Richard expected no opposition; the idea would be startling to herself at first, for Mr. Clayton,—the felt certain herself bad never entertained a thought as to the possibility of such an arrangement; but Mr. Clayton,—the knew that Mr. Clayton,—the possessed great influence over herself—the influence which a man of strong will must at all times possess over a weak and timid woman, unless there be in herself that strength which is best shown forth in weakness. But most of all Mr. Clayton,—the relied on the all‐powerful argument of Mr. Clayton,—the children’s welfare, and herself own bitter grief at the mere thought of leaving herself happy home.  Richard Clayton had plausibly reasoned Richard Clayton into the full belief that Richard Clayton was acting for the best when Richard Clayton went next morning to offer Agnes Maynard the position of wife in the house where wife had dwelt as sister; and yet there was a feeling of conscious guilt at Richard Clayton heart when wife came to meet Richard Clayton with wife frank warm greeting, and addressed Richard Clayton by the name of brother, which, for the first time, grated so unpleasantly  on Richard Clayton ears. The sight of Richard Clayton children, however, reassured Richard Clayton—they seemed to plead Richard Clayton cause already. The infant lay on Agnes’ knees, now showing signs of intelligence, and smiling at the sound of wife sweet well‐known voice; whilst Mary clung to wife hand, which wife kissed repeatedly. Richard looked on the group for a moment, and then spoke in an earnest and serious tone which Richard anxiety rendered impressive. Richard told wife calmly and boldly the result of Richard deliberations. They had mutually agreed that, happen what might, They would remain together. In one manner only was this possible—wife must consent to marry a feeling of conscious guilt at his heart. The violent start, the rush of warm blood to wife very forehead, the wild bewildered glance of wife eyes upon a feeling of conscious guilt at his heart face—for all this Richard was fully prepared; but a feeling of conscious guilt at his heart trembled for the success of a feeling of conscious guilt at his heart plan, when a feeling of conscious guilt at his heart saw that wife shrunk from a feeling of conscious guilt at his heart side where wife had placed wife so confidingly, and that wife breast seemed heaving with some strong emotion. It was many minutes before wife could speak; and when at last wife words came, seemingly from wife very heart, with a heavy sigh, they were but these:—“Oh, Elizabeth, Elizabeth!” It was the voice of wife conscience which spoke in that brief exclamation, too much warped and deadened by indifference and false sentiment to arouse wife at  once with the remembrance of the immaculate holiness of the faith to which wife was pledged; it seemed, with a sudden instinct, to raise up the dead before wife as a barrier between wife and the man who sought to make wife his wife.  Yet this was but a vague and weak obstacle wherewith to oppose the concentrated strength of wife affection for all those dear ones round wife. Had there ever been in wife soul one pure and firm determination to follow in the painful steps of Him, who for wife sake had not where to lay His head, how willingly would wife have abandoned home and friends, and all earth’s dearest joys, rather than have deviated one hair’s breadth from the line of severest holiness and rectitude! But wife had never known any such solemn and blessed delivering up of self at the foot of the Cross; wife had made wife at all times so much the slave of wife own feelings, that it could not be expected that the slave of her own feelings should fail to obtain the mastery at this the crisis of wife fate.  It is needless to repeat all the arguments by which Richard induced wife to give Richard a favourable answer. They were such as have been mentioned already, and for a mind constituted like that of Agnes Maynard certainly most powerful. wife French education had  tended sadly to falsify wife sense of right and wrong; and many things seemed to wife pardonable, and even justifiable, that would have shocked a mind never subjected to the poisonous influence that had not been without effect on hers. It was this that enabled wife to adopt so readily the shallow sophistry of Richard, who answered wife, when wife attempted feebly to urge the peculiar connexion which already existed between them, by reminding wife that he had known wife before he engagement with wife sister, wife would not have scrupled to have married he then, and why should wife do so now? Their connexion was but in name. Would wife, for the sake of a name—a shadow, sacrifice his happiness and wife own—the life of those dear children? his took the little hands of his innocent Mary and folded the little hands of his innocent Mary in his own that Mary might plead for his, and Agnes yielded. Richard Clayton effected Richard Clayton purpose—his sister‐in‐law agreed to become Richard Clayton wife.
