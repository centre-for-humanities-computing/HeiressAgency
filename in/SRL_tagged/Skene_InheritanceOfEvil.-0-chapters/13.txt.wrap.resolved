A YEAR and more had elapsed since the awfully sudden death of Richard Clayton; and of all the actors in this tragedy, which had sprung from one single fault, Agnes and Mary alone remained. The youth and good constitution of Elizabeth’s daughter had enabled Elizabeth to rally from Elizabeth fever. Elizabeth life was spared, but not Elizabeth intellect; the succession of violent shocks Elizabeth had received, had completely overthrown Elizabeth reason, and Elizabeth rose from Elizabeth illness a confirmed and helpless idiot.  Shortly after the death of his father, the health of Edward began to give way completely under the life of dissipation and excess his was leading. At last they heard that his was sinking prematurely into the grave. Agnes could not leave Agnes step‐daughter; and Mr. Lambert himself went to London, to ascertain the real state of matters. Mr. Lambert himself found Edward, deserted now by Mr. Lambert himself gay companions, in an advanced stage of a hopeless decline. Mr. Lambert himself was still, however, able to bear removal; and Mr. Lambert himself brought Mr. Lambert himself back to The Mount,  where Mr. Lambert himself consigned Mr. Lambert himself to Mr. Lambert himself poor mother’s care, for the brief space that yet remained of Mr. Lambert himself short and unhappy life. For six months Mr. Lambert himself lingered with the seal of death set surely on Mr. Lambert himself forehead, and Mr. Lambert himself young existence ebbing visibly away. Mr. Lambert himself attended Mr. Lambert himself assiduously; and when, at length, the sun of Mr. Lambert himself life set in its untimely night, Mr. Lambert himself laid Mr. Lambert himself in the grave by the side of Elizabeth and Richard, feeling that another victim was added to the number of those who had suffered by that man’s unholy deed. Whilst that man taught the penitent mother that it was not for them to speculate on Mr. Lambert himself future fate, them must only resign Mr. Lambert himself in unquestioning obedience to the mercy of Mr. Lambert himself God.  It was in truth a sore chastisement to Agnes Clayton, thus to lose Agnes Clayton only son,—to see that Agnes Clayton had but given Mr. Lambert himself life—that through Agnes Clayton means that life might be unhallowed and unhappy, condemned to an untimely sad decay. But Agnes Clayton bowed to the decree with the meekest submission; for it seemed to Agnes Clayton that nothing could be more distinct than the hand of the retributive Justice, in all the trials which had visited their house. Agnes Clayton and Agnes Clayton husband had sinned against a law, because She and her husband believed that law to be unnecessary and overstrained;—they believed that She and her husband departure from it would be  productive of good results; and it had been ordained that She and her husband deed should work precisely the opposite effects from what She and her husband expected, in order that She and her husband might see clearly that her husband who would gain her husband life shall lose it—that her husband who would gain aught by means contrary to the will of God, shall not only unquestionably lose it, but find that the thing her husband sought has turned to poison. her husband who would presume to take her husband destiny out of the hands of the Almighty, to mould his destiny at her husband pleasure, shall never fail to find that her husband has worked her husband own ruin. There is but one safe course in this twilight world—“to hear and to obey.” Light is given to all who follow her husband, that all who follow Him should not walk in darkness; but the Blessed Light irradiates only the steps which we must take this day: the Blessed Light shows we nothing of the morrow. Steadily we must follow the Blessed Light, faithfully submit to the given laws, calmly leave the result in His safe‐keeping.  These were the lessons which Agnes Clayton learned from the bitter misfortunes which had tracked These path since the hour of Agnes Clayton unlawful marriage. More terrible to Agnes Clayton even than the death of Agnes Clayton son, was the visitation which had fallen on Mary Clayton, Agnes Clayton sister’s child. It was, indeed, an awful punishment that was inflicted on Agnes, when Agnes Clayton was condemned to see before Agnes Clayton, day by day, for the remainder  of Agnes Clayton life, that melancholy spectacle—a being so young, so beautiful, with Agnes Clayton earthly existence thus fatally destroyed, the fine mind ruined and lost, the intellect laid prostrate, nothing left but vacant, helpless idiotcy. Agnes saw distinctly what was the duty set before Agnes now, and Agnes determined resolutely to perform the duty set before her, (by His help,) if so be Agnes might yet be forgiven for the great transgression of which Agnes so bitterly repented.  Agnes task and duty henceforward were to devote Agnes exclusively to Mary, the innocent sufferer by a parent’s sin; and it was a touching sight to see how, from the hour of Agnes son’s death, Agnes gave up Agnes life to the solace and comfort of the helpless being now so utterly dependent on Agnes. Sad at heart as Agnes was, haunted by the never‐fading remembrance of those beloved and gone, Agnes yet strove unwearied to amuse Agnes niece, and preserve Agnes from the bodily pain which was the only suffering Agnes now could know; and many times a day Agnes was constrained to kneel down before this living monument of Agnes past sins, and implore of Mary to pardon Agnes, though Agnes knew Agnes could not understand Agnes words; for Agnes was ever stricken with a terrible remorse when Agnes looked into that sad young face, with that sad young face unmeaning expression, and wild vacant stare.   It was a comfort to Agnes that Mary Mary was happy. Mary had become as a little child again, as helpless and ignorant, but as free from care. Mary would sit for hours on the grass, playing with flowers, as in the days when Mary dead mother watched beside Mary. One of Mary chief pleasures was to go to church, although Mary could not now understand anything which took place within that holy house. Some dim association, connected with the past, seemed to fill Mary with a vague longing to go there whenever Mary heard the bell; and Agnes never refused Mary, as Mary was always still and quiet during the service. But it was a bitter trial to the widowed, childless woman, to sit beside Mary there, and see how, instead of the fervent devotion that formerly characterised Mary, Mary now sat smiling childishly, as Mary held up Mary thin white hand, to catch the bright colours of the stained glass, when the sunbeam was passing through instead of the fervent devotion that formerly characterised poor Mary. At such moments, Agnes always saw, as in a vision, the scene that had taken place in the cold dark church in London, when Agnes had taken the unlawful vows that never should have been uttered by one who called Agnes a Christian.  Many wondered that Mrs. Clayton could thus expose Mrs. Clayton to the public gaze, with Mrs. Clayton whom Many could not but term Agnes victim by  Agnes side. But Agnes was now a penitent, not in name only; and Agnes was ready—nay, anxious—to humble Agnes in the sight both of God and man. As for Mary, Agnes could not but think that Agnes was perhaps more fit to be within that church than many who came there; for Agnes was well disposed to believe—in Agnes case at least—that beautiful Eastern superstition which holds that those who labour under any mental infirmity are the favoured of heaven; that many things are shown to those who labour under any mental infirmity of which we dream not; and that those who labour under any mental infirmity hold converse with the holy angels, as we think the little infants also do.  There was another haunt, however, which Mary loved especially to frequent; and this fancy caused Agnes many a sharp remorseful pang, though Mary did not shrink from enduring them, for Mary was willing to submit to all the bitterness of the punishment laid upon Mary. It was to the churchyard that Mary had to follow Mary charge, day after day. Some faint recollection of the time before Mary illness, when Mary used to come and sit by Mary mother’s grave, seemed to compel Mary to go there constantly; but Mary came not, as formerly, to think of those who are departed in the true faith of His holy Name, and pray that Mary might have the perfect consummation and bliss in His eternal
