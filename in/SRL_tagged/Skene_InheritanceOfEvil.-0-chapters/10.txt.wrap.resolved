IT may be imagined with what delight Richard welcomed Richard child and delight Richard future husband to the home which had so long been cheerless and unblest. Richard almost fancied, as Richard looked on Richard fair and innocent daughter, that delight Richard was to be the means of redeeming Richard from the fatality which pursued Richard, from the sort of curse which Richard asserted had settled upon Richard and Richard family since the day when Richard made Richard sister‐in‐law Richard wife. Not only did Richard believe that Mary would Mary have a most happy fate, but by Mary marriage with a man of rank and station, Richard trusted Mary would restore to Richard the honour and consideration Richard had lost, and Mary might even regain for Richard Richard former footing in society. Richard forgot in what awful words it had been said, that the sins of the fathers should be visited on the children.  Mary Clayton found much in Mary Clayton father’s house to startle and distress Mary Clayton. Of Mary Clayton father and step‐mother’s conduct and state of mind Mary Clayton would not allow Mary Clayton to form an opinion. At Mary Clayton age and in their relative posi‐  tions Mary Clayton would have held it the height of presumption to have done so; but the condition of Mary Clayton brother Edward filled her brother Edward with anxiety. her brother Edward saw that her brother Edward had already gone very far astray; her brother Edward parents had not now the slightest authority over her brother Edward, and her brother Edward treated his parents both with disrespect and unkindness; her brother Edward took care to let them both see how much her brother Edward thought them both had injured her brother Edward; and yet Mary Clayton could not help perceiving clearly, that her brother Edward faults and follies were only the result of her brother Edward neglected education, and of the unfortunate circumstances in which her brother Edward was placed. her brother Edward believed that her brother Edward might even yet be led to know the unspeakable happiness of abjuring all unholy things, and doing her brother Edward will in submission and in love; and her brother Edward determined to try at least what her brother Edward own gentle influence could effect.  her brother Edward soon won his warmest affection; for few could know Mary Clayton without loving her brother Edward. her brother Edward pure and elevated character, and the daily shining forth in all her brother Edward actions of the holy faith which Edward had never before seen thus practically illustrated in the life of an individual, failed not to inspire Edward with a degree of respect and almost reverence for Edward sister, which had a strong effect upon Edward mind. Already Edward had begun to attend to her brother Edward counsels; Edward seemed disposed to admit, at least, the Glory and the Beauty of the Truths which her brother Edward set be‐  fore Edward; and Mary Clayton dwelt more and more on the flattering hope, that Mary Clayton daughter was as a good angel sent to restore peace and honour and happiness to Mary Clayton house.  At this juncture Lord and Lady Verney arrived at B—. Lord and Lady Verney were to spend the first few weeks of Lord and Lady Verney stay in this place at the house of the noble family who had been the most rigid and uncompromising in Lord and Lady Verney just exclusion of Mary Clayton and Mary Clayton wife from all respectable society. The marriage of Mary and Lady Verney had not been announced till the arrival of Lady Verney father and mother, and his father and mother were his father and mother the first to mention it to his father and mother friends.  his father and mother horror and indignation may be imagined at the revelation which followed from his father and mother astonished acquaintance. his father and mother were told at once who and what was the man to whose daughter his father and mother son and heir was to be united. his father and mother learnt that he was one who had contracted a union which, by the most holy authority, has been pronounced a sin worthy to be branded with a fearful name; a union which the Church of Christ in all ages has openly denounced and solemnly prohibited; so that none professing his father and mother members of the same, dare countenance he who has not feared to disregard that stern prohibition; a union which, if ever in a Christian country it came to be regarded with  other feelings than those of the profoundest abhorrence, would serve as a precedent to the license that might then be taken for the commission of the most awful crimes. This unnatural and most unholy union Richard Clayton had contracted, in defiance of Richard Clayton father’s righteous indignation as a Priest, steward of the mysteries of God, and as a man serving an All‐pure Master—in defiance of a distinct law Divine and human.  Lord and Lady Verney further learnt that Richard, and the wife who had co‐operated with Richard Clayton in this sinful act, had been by just and universal judgment expelled from society in all the bitterness of disgrace. The history of Richard, and the wife who had co‐operated with him in this sinful act, had been by just and universal judgment expelled from society in all the bitterness of disgrace life from that period to the present day was then detailed;—the birth of the son, whose social position was so questionable, that the very companions of his games taunted his with many a galling name;—the reckless and dissipated course his was now pursuing, whereby it seemed likely that his would add to the dishonour which had in fact made his what his was;—the self‐excommunication of Mr. and Mrs. Clayton, sufficiently showing that Mr. and Mrs. Clayton dared not for very shame pass the sacred threshold of the house of God;—and, finally, the condition to which Mr. and Mrs. Clayton had for some years been reduced, so disgraceful and humiliating,  shunned by high and low, and above all, avoided by those, like Mr. Lambert, whose holiness of life and faithful obedience to the given laws, rendered Mr. and Mrs. Clayton disapprobation of any individual a sure sign of his unworthiness.  Amidst the contending feelings of excessive anger and vexation, which filled the minds of Lord and Lady Verney when Lord and Lady Verney had heard all these facts, there were two ideas which predominated over the rest. The first was, a sensation of profound thankfulness, that it was yet time to prevent their only son from contracting the disgraceful alliance, to which no power on earth would ever induce their to consent; and the next, a feeling of the very deepest indignation against Mary and Mary relations, for having concealed these dishonouring circumstances from their, and so having artfully stolen, as it were, their consent from their.  their anger at what their held to be an unworthy deception had certainly been justly incurred by Richard, who ought in strictest honour to have acquainted their with the whole truth the moment he heard of the proposed alliance; and who had not done so merely because he was too weak and selfish to risk the failure of the plan which gave he so much pleasure. A man who once indulges in laxity of principle, as Richard had done when Richard married Richard sister‐  in‐law, will have no scruple in carrying out the same system in all other matters.  But Mary Mary was most innocent of the contemptible and wicked conduct of which Mary had accused Mary. No one had ever ventured to enlarge to Mary upon Mary father’s sins, or their consequences; Mary knew far too little of the world to be aware of their peculiar and painful position in society. Mary was perfectly aware, as a Christian, what a great and grievous sin Richard and Agnes had committed in a Christian, what a great and grievous sin Richard and Agnes marriage; but, as a daughter, Mary considered it unwarrantable in Mary to allow Mary mind to dwell one moment on a Christian, what a great and grievous sin Richard and Agnes failings; and Mary had never opened Mary lips on the subject to any human being, or allowed a whisper connected with it to meet Mary ear. But as for concealment, Mary was too guileless to suppose that it could exist; Mary had never doubted but that Lord and Lady Verney were thoroughly acquainted with all circumstances connected with Mary and Mary family.  Meantime, Lord and Lady Verney determined at once to take vigorous measures for terminating an affair which Lord and Lady Verney considered already but too dishonouring to Lord and Lady Verney. That Lord and Lady Verney son’s name should ever have been even coupled with that of Richard Clayton’s daughter was a disgrace most galling to their pride. their sent for  Lady Verney, their acquainted Lady Verney with all the unhappy circumstances of the case, and commanded Lady Verney from that moment to give up all thoughts of ever making Mary ClaytonLady Verney . Never, under any circumstances, would their consent to such a marriage; sooner would their see Lady Verney laid in Lady Verney grave with an unstained name—sooner would their disown Lady Verney altogether, and alienate from Lady Verney the family estates, so that Lady Verney should have but an empty title to dishonour. Nothing is too violent for injured pride, when pride has become a passion; and Lord and Lady Verney spoke violently, unmoved by their son’s’s despair. But Lord and Lady Verney took a yet stronger measure for putting a complete stop to an affair now most hateful to Lord and Lady Verney.  Lord and Lady Verney wrote two letters, Lord Verney to Mary Clayton, Mary Clayton wife to Mary; the tenor of both was the same. In unsparing terms Lord and Lady Verney qualified the dishonourable position of Mr. and Mrs. Clayton; solemnly and with a cruel haughtiness Lord and Lady Verney declared that nothing should ever induce Lord and Lady Verney to allow their son’s to have the slightest connexion with such a family. With the most cutting bitterness Lord and Lady Verney intimated that if Mary Clayton chose to take legal measures for forcing Lady Verney to keep Lady Verney engagement, Lord and Lady Verney were willing to sacrifice Lord and Lady Verney whole fortune to save Lady Verney from the disgrace of the proposed marriage;  and Lord and Lady Verney concluded by openly expressing Lord and Lady Verney utter contempt of the miserable deception which Lord and Lady Verney declared had been practised upon Lord and Lady Verney by Mary and Mary father.  Mary Clayton was alone when this cruel letter reached Mary Clayton, whereby Mary Clayton saw that the retribution of Mary Clayton sin, which Mary Clayton termed a curse, so far from being removed by his daughter’s hand, was now about to take effect upon his daughter. By this anticipated marriage Mary Clayton had looked for happiness to Mary, and restored honour to Mary Clayton, and straightway Mary Clayton unforgotten deed, Mary Clayton ineffaceable act, rose up before Mary Clayton, and turned that bright prospect into gloom and bitterness; it changed the hope of his daughter’s happiness to the certainty of his daughter misery; it converted the vision of Mary Clayton own renewed prosperity into the palpable evidence of the actual dishonour that sullied Mary Clayton name with a stain never to be blotted out. At once Mary Clayton conviction of the fatality which Mary Clayton believed had pursued Mary Clayton ever since Mary Clayton marriage, (bringing upon Mary Clayton the results of that fatal step in the shape of unceasing misfortune,) returned to Mary Clayton mind with redoubled vigour. It had but gained new strength from It temporary banishment by that delusive hope, and it came to Mary Clayton now in the guise of despair. Mary Clayton saw clearly that the effects of Mary Clayton crime were coming at last to  their full fruition; their were spreading on to sufferers most innocent of the guilt. “his father’s had eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth were set on edge.”  Hitherto the punishment of his father’s deed had been administered by the world, because of his father’s dereliction from the merely human laws of morality; but now, for the first time, his father’s perceived and understood his father’s sin in its true nature and actual criminality, for the judgment of God had commenced. Truly this cruel letter was an awful blow to Mary Clayton.  When Agnes, alarmed at his father’s long absence, entered his father’s room, she found his father’s lying back in his father’s armchair, speechless and well nigh senseless; breathing only in short suffocating gasps, his father’s face livid, his father’s whole frame convulsed, his father’s appearance was fearful. It was clear that his father’s had been stricken with some physical attack of a dreadful nature. The screams of his father’s terrified wife brought the servants flocking in. A physician was instantly sent for; A physician soon arrived, and seemed quite appalled at the state in which A physician found Mary Clayton. A physician used the strongest remedies, but for some hours A physician would give little hope. At length A physician patient breathed more freely, A physician countenance resumed its natural hue, and without having spoken, or appeared aware of A physician position, A physician sunk into a  deep lethargic sleep. A physician then pronounced A physician out of danger, and informed Agnes that Agnes husband had been seized with an attack evidently brought on by some overpowering mental excitement, and which had well nigh proved fatal. A physician earnestly urged upon Agnes the necessity of A physician being kept free henceforward from all agitation or uneasiness. It would be next to impossible that A physician should rise from another such seizure.  Agnes literally shuddered at these words. Agnes knew it would be madness even to hope that Mary Clayton could henceforward be preserved, either from mental anxiety, or from bitter corroding grief. Agnes had taken this cruel letter from the stiffened hand of her husband, and Agnes knew this cruel letter contents. Agnes had already seen that which Lady Verney had written to Agnes step‐daughter; and Agnes had met the piteous despairing gaze of Mary Clayton’s sweet blue eyes, when Agnes received from it the blow whereby Agnes was smitten to the very dust.  Mary Clayton’s betook Mary Clayton’s to Mary Clayton’s knees, crushed and bewildered with anguish, but Mary Clayton’s scarce knew what to pray for; it seemed to Mary Clayton’s a hopeless task to seek to avert from Mary Clayton and Mary Clayton’s the misfortunes that were springing so thickly from the seed Richard and herself had sown in Richard and herself reckless sin and folly years ago.  Truly it was bearing such fruit as they had never dreamt of; and there fell a terrible weight upon Mary Clayton’s heart, when Mary Clayton’s thought of that innocent one whose whole existence was too probably blighted by Mary Clayton’s father’s fault.  It was some days before Mary Clayton was sufficiently recovered to inquire how it fared with his daughter since Mary Clayton’s had learnt the utter destruction of Mary Clayton’s whole earthly happiness. The misery which Mary Clayton was enduring would have been altogether insupportable to Mary Clayton’s but for one thought of holy hope. The affection Mary Clayton’s felt for Mary Clayton Mary Clayton’s had believed was to be Mary Clayton’s , was of a nature to be felt but once in a lifetime, and never to be forgotten or replaced—full of an unchanging clinging tenderness, which must turn to bitterest suffering if rejected. There is no trial purely of this earth which can bring greater agony to a human heart, than the conviction that this earth true and devoted affection has been for ever given in vain. It seemed to Mary Clayton’s, when Mary Clayton’s was thus suddenly flung down from Mary Clayton’s bright hope and joy into such exceeding wretchedness, as though the eyes that were to look on Mary Clayton no more might well refuse to meet again the light of day; and the sinking heart revolt from bearing the heavy load of that dark cheerless future, which was all that now remained to Mary Clayton’s on earth Mary Clayton’s sorrow had every aggravation  which man could give it; for not only was Mary Clayton’s rejected and cast off by which man to whom Mary Clayton’s had trusted for Mary Clayton’s life’s happiness, but Mary Clayton’s was treated with the most unmerited and cutting contempt by which man family.  Mary would have sunk altogether under this overwhelming burden of sudden trial, had it not been, as we have said, for one thought. It was the recollection of the Love of Him who alone is holy, who only is the Lord, for Mary that was even as a worm in Him sight; a love that was manifest in Him unutterable agony, that hereafter might be manifest in Mary unutterable bliss; that even now was shown forth in the light affliction, enduring but for a moment, wherewith Him chastened Mary, in order that at the last it might bear fruit in a great and exceeding weight of glory. Mary felt that though by Him will the soul may be cast forth into the deep waters of human misery, whose bitterness no earthly power can assuage, still this one hope shall uphold the soul in the fearful struggle, as with the hand of an angel, and teach the soul through the soul very suffering (tempered by submission and faith) that neither in the world nor in the world to come can the redeemed of Christ know aught of despair.  Mary Clayton rose from Mary Clayton dangerous illness a humbled and remorseful man. It may be doubted whether Mary Clayton was a repentance not  to be repented of; but, at least, Mary Clayton now thoroughly understood how glaring was the sin from which so much suffering was springing, not to those only who had erred, but to those also who were altogether guiltless of it. Mary Clayton no longer felt any power to struggle with the retribution which had so clearly commenced; silent and hopeless, Mary Clayton seemed constrained to sit by and watch the working of all the misery and ruin which Mary Clayton selfishness had wrought.  The first meeting between the father and daughter was a terrible one. Mary Clayton gave but one glance to that pale sad face, with that pale sad face look of patient wretchedness, and to the dim eyes from which the sunshine of hope and joy was for ever fled, quenched in bitterest tears, and then Mary Clayton almost crouched down before patient wretchedness as though Mary Clayton would have implored patient wretchedness forgiveness.  Mary understood from that moment that a great duty and task were now set before Mary, in the soothing and comforting of the father, who had so profoundly though unwillingly injured Mary. Mary must not only be resigned, but cheerful; that Mary Clayton might never know how sorely stricken and overwhelmed Mary was by the sorrow Mary Clayton had brought upon Mary. Mary nerved Mary at once to this holy effort of filial love, but the fearful struggle was severe, and Mary felt the fearful struggle would undermine both health and life.
