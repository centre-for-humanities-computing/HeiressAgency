MR. VERNEY might have spared all the misery which VERNEY unworthy scheme had caused to the Clayton family, for it entirely failed of the effect VERNEY had hoped it would have produced on VERNEY father and mother. Desirable as wealth would now have been to wealth, pride was wealth first idol, and wealth were true in wealth allegiance to it.  No advantages which were to be found in the alliance, would have induced No advantages which were to be found in the alliance to allow the daughter of Richard Clayton to be the wife of No advantages which were to be found in the alliance son and heir; still less, by means of a project against which No advantages which were to be found in the alliance honourable feelings revolted, and which would but have entailed a more effectual disgrace on the despised family.  Bitterly disappointed, and hopeless at last, VERNEY returned to B— in time to hear that Richard Clayton lay insensible and dangerously ill. Mary Clayton lay insensible and dangerously ill was known at the village and at The Mount that Edward was pursuing a reckless course of dissipation in London. Edward extravagance was carried on with money borrowed on false pretences. But Edward father and  mother seemed to take little heed of the details of the progressive ruin of his father and  mother only son. his father and  mother whole thoughts were now absorbed in the most overwhelming anxiety for the daughter of Elizabeth, who lay upon her bed of sickness and pain, uttering such plaintive words in her delirium as pierced his father and  mother very hearts. Richard was convinced her would die. Richard diseased imagination now set no limit to the misfortunes which were to spring from Richard marriage. Richard own health was completely shaken, and Richard mind filled with the darkest thoughts. Richard neither ate nor slept, but haunted Mary’s room night and day like a spectre. Richard felt exactly as though Richard had killed Mary—killed the gentle, loving child that never had injured a human being. Richard could not endure the sight of Agnes: Richard never looked upon Mary now but Richard heard the words of Elizabeth ringing on Richard ear, as though Mary were repeating them even then in Mary grave:—“Oh, Richard, Mary is your sister, your sister!”  One night, by a most unusual occurrence, Mary was left for a few minutes alone, although Mary fever was then at her fever height. Richard and Agnes had quitted Mary while the nurse arranged the room, and Mary had carelessly gone down stairs, intending to return immediately, and thinking that Mary was asleep.   The peculiar form which Mary delirium had taken was naturally enough the continual repetition in Mary own fancy of the scene which had caused Mary illness. Mary was incessantly imagining Mary saw Edward rushing in with Edward livid distorted face; Mary heard Edward terrible words; Mary saw Edward leave them, maddened with the injuries them had done Edward; and Mary fled out to follow Edward through the storm and the gloom. Many times Mary had actually risen to pursue the phantom of Mary raving, and they had held Mary down. To‐night the vision returned, and there was no one to prevent Mary following the wild impulse. Mary rose from Mary bed, and, in the strength of fever, fled from the room and the house with noiseless steps.  There was but one person who saw that white ghost‐like figure passing rapidly among the trees. This was old Jack, the idiot, who had come to The Mount for his dinner as usual. Poor Jack was no wiser than Poor Jack had been years before, when Poor Jack had been found to welcome Agnes Clayton as the wife of Agnes Clayton brother‐in‐law; but as Poor Jack mother was now bedridden from age, his mother had provided Poor Jack with a guardian, without whom his mother would not have allowed Poor Jack to leave his mother sight. This was Poor Jack dog Charlie, who invariably accompanied Poor Jack wherever Poor Jack went.  Charlie was certainly not a beauty, espe‐  cially when Charlie had been indulging in a duel with a neighbouring cat, of which delectable amusement Charlie was extremely fond, although Charlie never failed to retire from the combat with one eye unfit for use, and the whole of Charlie intelligent countenance seamed and scored in a most disfiguring manner. Charlie coat also, which ought to have been of a pure white, was much soiled and blackened by Charlie unfortunate predilection for rolling in the dust, and squeezing Charlie through all sorts of unpracticable holes, instead of taking the legitimate entrances; but in temper and disposition Charlie was of inestimable worth, and Charlie faithful attachment to poor Jack was beautiful in the extreme. The old woman, in fact, had literally given the latter in charge to this sage animal, who was infinitely more rational and intelligent than The old woman poor son, and both poor Jack and Charlie thoroughly understood Jack and Charlie respective positions. Charlie yielded obedience with the utmost submission to the authority which the dog wielded in a very dignified manner; and many a time Charlie had, on the dark winter’s nights, brought Charlie charge safe home when Charlie would have been lost in the snow without Charlie protection.  They were seated together under a tree on this calm mild evening, when poor Mary tottered past They, moaning and calling out poor Mary brother’s  name. poor Jack looked after poor Mary with the wild senseless laugh to which poor Jack was continually giving vent unconsciously; but Charlie seemed to consider that this was a matter in which they ought to interfere, and, with that strange instinct that often seems almost prophetic in dogs, poor Jack took poor Jack’s coat between poor Jack teeth, and insisted on poor Jack following in poor Mary’s steps.  poor Mary went staggering on, taking exactly the path poor Mary had gone on that fatal night; but when poor Mary reached the precipitous bank of the river, poor Mary unsteady feet failed poor Mary, and poor Mary fell headlong into the water. With one single bound Charlie plunged in after poor Mary, and Charlie secured a firm hold of poor Mary dress as soon as poor Mary rose to the surface; then panting, snorting, and struggling, Charlie swam with poor Mary to the precipitous bank of the river, found footing for Charlie, and intimated to poor Jack, by Charlie impatient pulling at the weight so far beyond Charlie own strength, that Charlie was to lift the sinking body from the water. The poor fool understood, and obeyed. Charlie was of great bodily strength, and Charlie drew poor Mary out of the river, with perfect ease, and laid poor Mary on the bank, where Charlie stood over poor Mary, laughing out in Charlie discordant glee.  Charlie, however, was not yet satisfied; Charlie once more seized hold of poor Jack, and drew Charlie towards the house, where, by Charlie vehement barking, and poor Jack’s incoherent exclamations, the servants  became convinced that something had occurred. the servants   followed the sagacious dog and Charlie companion to the spot where poor Mary was lying, now quite senseless, though still living.  the servants   took poor Mary home, and carried poor Mary straight into the first room the servants   came to, where Richard Clayton was sitting alone. Richard Clayton heard the shuffling feet, and started up; Richard Clayton saw the servants   enter with the servants   burden. With the first glimpse Richard Clayton obtained of that seemingly lifeless form, with the wet hair streaming over poor Mary death‐like face, the terrible idea took possession of Richard Clayton at once that poor Mary had destroyed poor Mary. Richard Clayton had fancied that this was poor Mary intention when Richard Clayton had found poor Mary, on that night, standing by the river side, because Richard Clayton knew the depth of poor Mary mental anguish, and Richard Clayton did not know the strength of a Christian’s submission and resignation; and now Richard Clayton never doubted but that poor Mary had seized the first moment when poor Mary was left unguarded, to rid poor Mary, by this violent means, of a life that was insupportable.  Careless and worldly as Richard Clayton had been, Richard Clayton never could have thought, with any thing but horror, of the awful sin of suicide—that crime which never can be repented of! And to find that this beloved daughter, for whom Richard Clayton had so securely anticipated an eternity of happiness, although for Richard Clayton sake  this mortal life had grown so bitter to poor Mary—to find that poor Mary, in poor Mary agony, had forgotten alike poor Mary faith and poor Mary obedience, and had rushed madly to the destruction both of soul and body, was more than the father, broken spirited and feeble, could endure.  the father would have advanced to meet the father hapless child, but the father steps were suddenly arrested; it was as though an iron hand had fastened on the father heart; an iron hand action was impeded; the father breath was choked; the father face assumed a dark leaden hue; the father well knew whose was the grasp that was checking the pulses of the father life, and the father lifted up the father darkening eyes imploringly. The terrible expression of the father countenance long after haunted all those who saw it; for, in that one awful moment, there passed before the father spirit all the occurrences of the father past life. Clear, distinct, rapid as the lightning’s flash, the father could discern the unbroken links of the whole chain of events which had risen out of that one hour when the father had knelt at the altar with the sister of the father wife—now but a part of the irrevocable past. Their joy and Their sorrow alike were gone, and the father must go forth to see what fruits Their would bear to the father soul in eternity. the father whole existence now was shrivelling up into a vapour, a dream that was flitting away from the father. One thing only stood  real and palpable before the father: the judgment to come for the deeds done in the body. the father made one wild effort to place the father upon the father knees, but strength and life failed the father at the same moment, and the father fell heavily and unresisting on the floor.  When Agnes Clayton gradually returned to consciousness, the first sight that met Agnes Clayton eyes was the corpse of the father, round which those who had carried Agnes Clayton from the river were standing in hopeless dismay.
