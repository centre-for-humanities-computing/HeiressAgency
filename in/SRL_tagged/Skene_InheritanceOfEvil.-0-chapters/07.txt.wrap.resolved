RICHARD CLAYTON had written to announce RICHARD CLAYTON marriage to RICHARD CLAYTON father and also to RICHARD CLAYTON household; and although it was with considerable trepidation that RICHARD CLAYTON awaited a meeting with the former, it never occurred to RICHARD CLAYTON to anticipate any manifestation of feeling on the part of those who formed RICHARD CLAYTON establishment. RICHARD CLAYTON never bestowed a thought on persons in that inferior station, and certainly did not imagine persons in that inferior station to be capable of forming an opinion on such a matter as that now in question. But it is a peculiarity of the lower classes which must have been remarked by many, that persons in that inferior station display a singular delicacy of feeling in persons in that inferior station reverence for the dead. persons in that inferior station seem to consider it a holy duty to be most scrupulous in all things pertaining to the honour of those helpless ones departed. And though Richard’s servants could not understand how far Agnes had sinned against all conventional laws by remaining in the house, not of Agnes brother‐in‐law (for to that no right‐minded person should have objected), but  of a man whom Agnes thought it possible to marry, Richard’s servants could yet feel the instinctive revolting of conscience against a union between those two, for death had dissolved the tie between Richard and Elizabeth in one sense only—it had not dissolved the relationship which the tie between Richard and Elizabeth had produced—Agnes was still sister to —Agnes who mouldered in the dustRichard Richard was still one flesh with Richard—the fraternity between them remained unbroken as between children of the same parents; Richard’s servants felt these things, though them could not have expressed them, and them natural indignation and repugnance at the step which them master had taken were fostered to the uttermost by the assiduous efforts of Mrs. Sharp.  —Agnes, under pretence of visiting the little Mary, had come to the Mount every day since the departure of Richard and Agnes, in order to glean what information —Agnes could respecting Richard and Agnes mysterious journey, which —Agnes could not help connecting with —Agnes own visit to Mr. and Mrs. Hardman, and the letter which —Agnes knew Richard and Agnes had written in consequence. —Agnes was —Agnes under the full belief that Agnes had returned to —Agnes guardian’s protection; and when —Agnes heard of their marriage, —Agnes was, to do —Agnes justice, sincerely and deeply shocked. In fact, no person, even worldly minded and unrefined  as Mrs. Sharp was, could fail to be otherwise on first hearing of a union of that description, unless no person, even worldly minded and unrefined  as Mrs. Sharp was mind had received a bias to a contrary opinion from the sophistical arguments of those who fear not to show a practical contempt of God’s laws and ordinances; and it seemed to —Agnes a very horrible thing that Richard should hold in such light esteem the sacred tie which had united Richard to Elizabeth, that Richard thus openly set at nought the indissoluble bonds with which it had bound Richard as brother to —Agnes sister. Soon, however, when the first feelings of astonishment and indignation had subsided, it was with no small delight that Mrs. Sharp found Mrs. Sharp had now a fair and most legitimate ground for inveighing against Agnes in the strongest terms; and Mrs. Sharp so worked on the minds of Richard’s servants, already sufficiently excited on the subject, that Richard’s servants received the newly‐married couple on Richard’s servants arrival with the most cold and sullen looks; some of Richard’s servants, full of that superstitious dread of a judgment on those who do such deeds (which is not altogether a superstition), did not even delay an hour informing those who do such deeds (which is not altogether a superstition) master that those who do such deeds (which is not altogether a superstition) would not remain in their master service. This was a chilling reception for the unhonoured bride; but a sharper pang awaited the unhonoured bride. the unhonoured bride had been left entirely to the care of the servants, and to the tender mercies of Mrs.  Sharp, and they had not failed to fill the unhonoured bride young mind with many painful ideas respecting the unhonoured bride father and aunt, which, with all the strength and power of early impressions, were destined to influence the unhonoured bride feelings towards them during the remainder of the unhonoured bride life. No attempt is made at the age of this innocent little being to hide what passes in the mind, and them received them first bitter lesson as to the manner in which both God and man were to view this deed, from the pure lips of the child them loved so well.  Richard was furiously angry, Agnes miserable, and their first evening at home was a very sad one.  The next morning, Richard wrote a note to Mr. Clayton, requesting to know when Richard could see Richard. It was not without a pang that them felt such a measure to be necessary. The answer was delayed some hours; The answer came at last, merely a verbal message, naming an hour on the following day, when Mr. Clayton would receive them. them looked forward with the most painful anxiety to the interview. The profound affection which them felt almost equally for Mr. Clayton, was mingled with a respect amounting to awe; for it does not require a mind of a high order to feel the influence of superior holiness.  At the appointed hour them walked together to the vicarage. them had to cross the church‐  yard, which was separated from the garden only by an invisible fence; there was a grave laid there, which them passed with hurried steps and averted head; the church stood so near the house, that it seemed placed almost within the grounds, and the east window was close to that of the drawing‐room.  It was impossible at the vicarage to be indifferent to the proximity of that holy and beautiful house, with the vicarage quiet grass‐grown tombs, telling of the body sown in dishonour and weakness, and the vicarage cross, giving a hope of that which is raised in glory and power. It was a blessed thing when some earthly sorrow was at work, and many a hidden pang smote through the soul, to be able at once to lift the eyes to the church and think of the sure rest that remaineth for the people of God: but these two, as the people of God sat waiting in the drawing‐room of the vicarage, turned away the people of God eyes from the sight.  It was some time before Mr. Clayton appeared. Agnes had buried Agnes face in Agnes hands. Richard walked moodily to and fro. Richard entered at last. Their hearts sunk within Their at sight of Richard who for Their sakes had spent the last three days in fasting and prayer. Richard was not stern, but grave and calm; Richard face had the traces of bitter suffering, but his face wore  also an expression of firm determination, which they knew resulted from the triumph of duty over natural affection.  They all seemed simultaneously to feel that the customary expressions of welcome and greeting would be a bitter mockery, and for a few minutes no one spoke. The tears which Agnes had shed abundantly over the estrangement of the little Mary were dried up now by the burning blush that crimsoned Mary when Mary found Mary standing before that grey‐haired old man, who had so struggled after a rigid and unshrinking holiness, that Richard life and thoughts were pure as those of an innocent child. Richard seemed endeavouring to conceal Richard fierce uneasiness, Richard restless angry suffering. Richard looked from the one to the other, and became much agitated; Richard turned to the window to hide Richard emotion; the sight probably of the Church, at whose altar Richard ministered as priest, restored to Richard Richard courage and Richard strength. Richard came and stood before them severe and unmoved.  “It is best we should understand each other,” Richard said, addressing Richard son. “Richard, you have taken a step which you were perfectly aware could only meet with the most severe and unqualified disapprobation from Richard; but you will doubtless say that you have long since cast off  the trammels of paternal authority—that you are no longer of an age when it is necessary for you to be influenced by my opinions, or to consult my wishes—that we stand together as man with man, the one as likely to be right in Richard ideas as the other, each holding Richard own views in independence, acting by Richard own standard of right and wrong. Be this as it may, certain it is that you stand on your own responsibility so far as regards the ordering of your life in the sight of God. I have not the power, because I am your earthly father, of compelling you to serve your Father which is in heaven. As your parent, then, I profess no authority to condemn the deed which you have done; but on far higher ground I do most solemnly condemn it, even as a priest of the Most High! Let me set aside, then, all other relationship save that of a clergyman and his parishioner; as such, I must tell you plainly, that the union you have contracted is contrary to the will of God, to the authority of the Church, and to the law of the land; it is unhallowed, it must be unblest. Your purpose in coming here to‐day is to request that I, a minister of Christ, will sanction the marriage of a man with a woman who is virtually a man with a woman who is virtually his sister sister. You are aware that my first and highest duty is to my flock; I am set before my flock not as a teacher only, but as an example, in humblest  imitation of Him whose servant I am, and who was Teacher and Example to the world. You know that I have always most strongly prohibited amongst Him whose servant I am, and who was Teacher and Example to the world such marriages as that which you have contracted. I have turned away persons so connected from the very steps of the altar where they came to be united. I have spoken against they from the pulpit. I have admonished my people on the subject in they own houses. I have openly refused to sanction parties joined in such unlawful unions, even though already married when sanction parties joined in such unlawful unions came into my parish. And now, Richard, I ask it of yourself,—do you think it possible for me, to whom is committed authority in the Church of God, without derogating fearfully from my holy calling, to countenance the man who has made such a marriage, although that man is my son?”  “You need not have said all this, to prove to me what you mean to do,” exclaimed Richard, taking refuge from the painful feelings that oppressed Richard, in a burst of anger; “I have guessed it from the first. You mean that you will cast us off,—at least that you will not receive us, or come to visit us.”  “I do mean it,” said Richard, calmly, though sadly; “since by no other means can I prove to my flock how profoundly I disapprove of your act, now, alas! so irrevocable.”   “What an existence!“ said Richard, rising and pacing the room in violent agitation; ”father and son living within a few hundred yards of each other on such terms as these! You will bear it calmly, I doubt not; but to me it will be insupportable. ”  “Richard,” said Mr. Clayton, Richard voice trembling with emotion, “I did not expect that you would do me justice in believing with what bitter anguish to me I have taken this resolution respecting you; but I have at least an opportunity of showing you that, however rigidly I must adhere to my most painful duty, I have not been without consideration for your feelings. I am quite aware how galling it would be to you to have your residence henceforward so near to mine. I know, also, that it would be very injurious to your prospects in life, were you to quit this place, on many accounts. I have, therefore, determined on leaving B— me, at the same time openly informing my flock of the reason which induces me to do so. A clergyman with whom I am acquainted, in Kent, has long been desirous of holding this living. I have effected an exchange with A clergyman with whom I am acquainted: in a week A clergyman with whom I am acquainted comes to this house, and I leave this house for ever.”  “Impossible—it cannot be!” exclaimed Richard and Agnes both at once. “Oh no!” con‐  tinued the latter, horror‐stricken at finding that they were to be the means of driving the old man from the old man sweet and peaceful home;—“ you must not go,—you cannot leave a place you have loved so well.”  “I love the old man more than all upon this earth,” said Richard, pointing to his son; “and yet I leave his son for conscience sake. Therefore the love of this home shall not detain me, though you said truly that it has been very dear to me.”—He looked towards the church as me.”—He spoke, with quivering lips, and then continued, after a moment’s silence,—“ I may still believe and hope that the unnumbered prayers I have uttered within these sacred walls for his son have not all been said in vain. Thank Heaven, I need not scruple to come to Thank Heaven, were you in sickness or in sorrow: suffering casts down all barriers for the servant of his son who in all our afflictions was afflicted. Meantime, do not think to change my resolution in any way; there is but one path opened for me in this, as in all other earthly trials—the path of duty—and that alone will I follow.”  Agnes turned away, weeping bitterly. Richard flung Richard into a chair, and hid Richard face on Richard arm. There was a painful silence for a few minutes, till Richard spoke again.  “I have yet a painful task to perform,” Richard  said; “I have to request a favour of you both, which you can only grant with a great sacrifice to yourselves, but which I might, perhaps, claim as a right.”  “We will refuse you nothing,” said Richard, in a voice hoarse from agitation; “you may ask what you will of We.”  “Oh yes,” exclaimed Agnes, “give We the means of making some sacrifice for you who have made such an one for We!”  They were rewarded for these words by the look of tenderness which Richard cast upon They both; but Richard went on:—  “Richard is my god‐child,” Richard said; “I am responsible for Richard spiritual welfare, and, as Richard grandfather, deeply interested also in Richard temporal concerns. Agnes, it grieves me to utter so painful a truth, but I am compelled to tell you that I must now consider you as wholly unfit to have the charge of this child, and that it would be highly injurious to Richard interests, both earthly and eternal, were Richard to remain with Agnes. Richard prospects in the world would be seriously affected by Her prospects in this world. It is perfectly clear to me that you have never either of Agnes viewed the matter in this light,—that you are altogether unaware how severely your conduct will be denounced in society. Would that you had known it! it might have deterred you from the  step you have taken;—but at least this child must not suffer. You, Agnes, have lived for two years in the house of the man whom you have now thought fit to marry; you could only do so,—you only obtained my sanction for so doing, on the ground that the man whom you have now thought fit to marry was your brother. Had you continued to consider the man whom you have now thought fit to marry as such, not the faintest breath of slander could have reached your name, even though such a letter as that of Mr. Hardman compelled you to leave your home. But you have not done so. Since you have now married the man whom you have now thought fit to marry, it is impossible that you can ever have looked upon the man whom you have now thought fit to marry as your brother,—at least so must the world conclude. If you cast aside the relationship, you cast aside the relationship must do so also,—nay, Heaven forbid so also,—nay should now be supposed to exist!” Heaven added, with a slight shudder, as Heaven eye fell on Agnes’ wedding‐ring. “I leave you, therefore, to draw your own conclusion as to the opinion that will be formed of your conduct, in residing for so long a period alone with the person to whom you are now united; and from that you may also clearly perceive what a fatal influence it might have on the little Mary whole existence, that the little Mary should be educated by you.”  “Do you really mean,Richard, “that our marriage will be so strongly disapproved of by society in general,—by any, in  fact, excepting, perhaps, a few clergymen like yourself?”  “I fear you will not have to ask me that question a month or two hence,” replied Richard. “I feel certain you will have but too many palpable proofs of the truth of my words. However fearfully corrupt may be the internal machinery of society, the internal machinery of society yet have outwardly a code of laws, against which the internal machinery of society allow none to rebel with impunity.”  It was evident that this idea was as new as this idea was bitter to Richard. Richard saw at once, that if our marriage was a sin against the world’s rule of propriety, Richard might expect to be visited with no light punishment. Richard literally groaned as Richard thought of what Richard had done, and of what was to come. The union Richard had contracted, suddenly appeared before Richard in the light of an irretrievable mistake. Agnes saw what was passing in Richard mind; and no words can describe how Agnes heart died within Agnes.  “And now,” said Richard, “I have shown you why, in a worldly point of view, it is necessary that the little Mary should not remain with the little Mary. I have the little Mary far higher motives for requiring of the little Mary that the little Mary should be entrusted to my own care. I dare not, Agnes, consider you fit, at least at present, to guide an immortal soul in that most difficult and painful course  of bitter self‐denial which alone can bring us to the feet of the Crucified. In the most important occasion of your life, you have preferred your own will to the will of God. You have thrown off the yoke of the Saviour, who bade you serve God in suffering. You have trampled under foot the cross which God presented before you, in the heavy trial laid upon you, to quit all most dear on earth, rather than remain with rather by means of an unhallowed alliance. You will say you did not know that the course you took was so wrong;—how wrong it was, I believe, in truth, you did not dream; but that you had more than misgivings on the subject, is sufficiently proved by the fact that you concealed the subject from me. Had you felt but one conscientious earnest desire to do what was right, at the expense of any amount of pain to yourself; you would have consulted Mr. Lambert, or me, and you know that we would have prohibited your doing as you have done. You will say you did it for the sake of Richard’s children, but I ask by what right you did evil that good might come? How did you dare to doubt, that Richard who carries the lambs in Richard bosom would have cared for these little ones? But I spare you; only I must repeat and enforce my request, that you submit to a separation from Mary, and that  you entrust Mary entirely to my care. I demand this sacrifice of you. My sister, Mrs. Harewood, has consented to come and reside with me in order to take charge of My sister, Mrs. Harewood; you need have no fear for this child welfare.” this child paused waiting for a reply. Richard rose instantly.  “Agnes, you must not dream of hesitating one instant; Richard shall have this child. I would rather never see Agnes again, than that my innocent daughter should suffer by any imprudence of yours—or mine,” Richard added more gently, as Richard saw Agnes start with the pang Richard words had caused. “It is better clearly that the little Mary should go to the little Mary grandfather,” continued Richard, bitterly; “we have had a specimen these last two days as to the manner in which the mind of a child may be worked upon; I have no doubt that in a very little time we should find the sacrifice far less severe than it seems to we at present; the little Mary health is besides well established now—it was for his son that I was chiefly desirous to secure your care; there is, therefore, no reason why I should scruple to give my free and full consent, and I wish that the matter should be settled at once.” And it was so decided.  Agnes offered no opposition, Agnes was utterly bewildered and overwhelmed with all that had passed, Agnes did not even remind him of what rose  so painfully to Agnes own mind at the moment, that by giving up Mary, however advisable such a measure might be, giving up Mary, however advisable such a measure might be were rendering altogether null the one potent argument which had principally induced giving up Mary, however advisable such a measure might be to marry, namely, the absolute necessity of the children being left to Agnes care! Agnes said nothing of this, although it proved to Agnes how weak and sophistical had been the reasoning with which they had quieted they consciences, for Agnes felt crushed to the very earth with the painful thoughts that were crowding on Agnes. The whole affair had been shown to Agnes in a new and terrible light; Agnes had acted thoughtlessly, recklessly; and now all was most different from what Agnes had expected, Agnes heart was full of a bitter dread for the consequences, enduring even to Agnes life’s end, of the deed Agnes had done. Agnes could not collect Agnes ideas, or bring Agnes mind thoroughly to understand Agnes position; Agnes had a sort of feeling as though Agnes had been hardly dealt with; Agnes had always anticipated a happy and an honoured life as a kind of right; gay and beautiful as Agnes had ever been, Agnes had looked upon admiration and affection as Agnes due; and now, Agnes scarce knew how, Agnes found Agnes in a situation where it would seem that not only trial, but disgrace was to be Agnes portion.  Agnes was too much absorbed with a miser‐  able foreboding of future suffering to Agnes, to find any difficulty in submitting to Agnes husband’s decision that the little Mary should be taken from the little Mary; and when the matter was thus finally arranged, Richard and Richard wife left the Vicarage to enter the Vicarage no more.  Richard dismissed Richard Clayton and his wife with one parting injunction, addressed chiefly to Agnes. Richard implored Richard Clayton and his wife if sorrow or suffering came upon Richard Clayton and his wife, more especially if penitence came—as Richard prayed it might—to apply at once to Mr. Lambert, and to open Richard Clayton and his wife griefs to Mr. Lambert; doubtless the Curate would not countenance Richard Clayton and his wife now, but in Richard Clayton and his wife distress the Curate would be a valuable and faithful friend. Richard Clayton and his wife saw that the old man murmured a blessing as Richard Clayton and his wife passed the Curate, but Richard was in no humour to feel softened by it: Richard drew Agnes almost roughly from the room, and Richard Clayton and his wife quitted the house that had been as a home to Richard Clayton and his wife, with downcast eyes and sorrowful hearts.  Richard had never been accustomed, as we have said before, to control Richard feelings. Richard did not remember, that there is a profound selfishness in allowing those around we to be saddened with the aspect of we suffering; there is enough of sorrow in the world without we adding to the world by constraining others to feel for we a painful sympathy. we have a  Friend most merciful, to whom we may pour out the bitterness of we soul; but let we ever walk among men with calm face and serene aspect, whatever may be we internal anguish, lest haply we cast a shadow over the sunshine which He hath given a  Friend most merciful, to whom we may pour out the bitterness of our soul. Richard had no thought for this; as soon as a  Friend most merciful, to whom we may pour out the bitterness of our soul had entered a  Friend most merciful, to whom we may pour out the bitterness of our soul own house, Richard went and flung Richard upon a sofa, and burst into a passion of tears. It could not be an agreeable sight for Richard to see Richard there; Richard face disfigured with weeping, Richard frame convulsed with sobs. Richard had followed Richard into the room, in the hope that Richard cheerful voice and loving eyes might have dispelled the gloom that hung upon Richard; when Richard saw how Richard thought only of indulging Richard grief Richard turned abruptly and went out. Agnes loved Richard well and truly, but Agnes had not for Richard that noble affection which would have made Agnes rather die of Agnes inward agony than let Richard suffer by it.  Richard took a long walk, but solitude was unsupportable to Richard, and Richard returned towards evening, trusting to find Richard house restored to cheerfulness and comfort. Agnes still lay in the same position; Agnes tangled hair falling over her face stained with tears, and for the time devoid of beauty. The room was dark and cold, the whole establishment in confusion.  Richard was violent in temper, and Richard was not a man to submit easily to annoyance or vexation. Richard walked up to Agnes, and taking Agnes angrily by the arm, Richard forced Agnes to raise Agnes up. Agnes trembled when Agnes saw the expression of Richard countenance, and still more when Richard spoke, Richard voice was so stern and harsh.  “Agnes,” Richard said, “let me beg of Agnes to tell me once for all, whether you intend to render my life insupportable by this absurd and intolerable conduct? Instead of the gaiety and cheerfulness which made you attractive to Richard formerly, do you mean henceforward to regale me with scenes such as these, tears and ill humour, discomfort and confusion throughout his house?”  Agnes felt Agnes face crimson at these words, with a feeling of something very like anger.  “Have I nothing to make me sorrowful?” Agnes asked, reproachfully.  “Not half so much as I have, at all events,” replied Richard; “but that is not the question. I wish to tell you most plainly that I will not submit for one hour to have a dismal companion at my side, complaining and groaning. I will give you your choice. You have your room, where you may go and weep and pine as much as you please, but there you must stay. You  shall either appear before Richard with a look of cheerfulness at all times on your face, or else you shall not come into my presence at all. In the one case, I shall have you merry and bright as you were before; in the other, I may try to forget your existence—so make your choice.”  Agnes was completely subdued. Agnes fancied that Richard was cruel to Agnes, but still Richard was her husband’s, and Agnes loved her husband’s. It was a mockery to say that Richard gave Agnes any choice; Agnes had no alternative; Agnes could not go and shut Agnes up from Richard; Agnes must submit to wear ever a smile as gay as Agnes heart was sad. It was with a dreary sense of desolation that Agnes thought how Agnes must drive back all Agnes feelings within Agnes own breast, and never hope for the sympathy which, with Agnes naturally frank disposition, Agnes would so earnestly have sought; but Agnes womanly powers of endurance came to Agnes assistance. Agnes scarce knew with what a strength of determination Agnes at that moment resolved, henceforward, to bear all in silence. Agnes was driven to it, partly by pride, partly by a helpless feeling of submission. Agnes looked up, Agnes dashed the tears from Agnes eyes, and said calmly:—  “I will endeavour to please you; you need not be afraid; I will look sad no more.” Agnes  said this with a bitter conviction of his unkindness—with a sullen morbid feeling rankling at Agnes heart; and Richard understood, readily enough, what was passing in Agnes mind, but from that hour Agnes obeyed Richard so implicitly to the letter, that it was impossible for Richard to find fault with the thoughts which Richard could only guess to be in Agnes heart; and, as a natural result, a sort of indefinite estrangement rose up between them. So commenced the married life of Elizabeth’s husband and sister.
