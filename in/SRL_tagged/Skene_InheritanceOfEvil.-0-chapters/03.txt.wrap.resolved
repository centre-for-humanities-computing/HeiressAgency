THESE events had taken place so rapidly and unexpectedly, that Richard and Agnes had scarce time to speculate on the cause of Elizabeth’s illness, before Richard and Agnes became altogether absorbed in Richard and Agnes overpowering anxiety for Elizabeth life. Elizabeth state became appalling in the extreme; it seemed as though Elizabeth could neither live nor die; for Elizabeth lingered many days after the physicians thought it impossible Elizabeth could survive. Some thought for this world, some earthly passion or feeling, seemed to hold Elizabeth back when already in the grasp of death; and whatever that thought might be, when already in the grasp of death filled Elizabeth immortal soul, thus standing on the threshold of eternity, so exclusively, that when already in the grasp of death swallowed up all anxiety or fear for the tremendous judgment close at hand. They could not tell what was the one idea which had power thus to absorb a spirit already summoned into the awful Presence, for Elizabeth was reduced to a state of weakness which deprived Elizabeth altogether of speech. Elizabeth could not raise Elizabeth or move without assistance, and Elizabeth would scarce have  seemed alive at all but for the wild restless gaze of Elizabeth sleepless eyes. There was in them a terrible expression of anxiety and misery, which told but too eloquently of the fierce human anguish with which that silent sufferer was wrestling.  It was a horrible thing to see one about to enter into those habitations which are everlasting, whether for good or ill, thus concentrating all Elizabeth expiring faculties, not on earnest repentance, but on the perishing remnant of the mortal life that now might be reckoned by days and hours. Elizabeth seemed ever struggling madly to express some one last wish, as though Elizabeth soul could not go forth till it had uttered certain words; but them could comprehend nothing from Elizabeth inarticulate efforts;—it was to Agnes that Agnes strove to address Agnes principally, though also to Richard, and she strove to address herself principally, though also to Richard very naturally concluded that, Agnes whole anxiety was for Agnes children only—that all Agnes endeavours were to make Agnes sister understand that her sister committed her children to her sister care. Impressed with this idea, Agnes tried to soothe and comfort her sister, by repeating again and again to Agnes that Agnes understood Agnes wishes, and that Agnes would never leave Agnes children, but that Agnes would make it the business of Agnes life to watch over her children and devote Agnes entirely to her children.   Richard also, in the same belief, assured Agnes repeatedly that Agnes might be at peace with regard to the poor little infants whom Agnes must leave behind in this chill world. Richard would never allow Agnes to leave Richard—Agnes should stay with Richard to tend and care for her children—her children should be consigned completely to Agnes charge.  Those promises which, but for the one horrible idea that now possessed the mind of Elizabeth, would have been to Agnes so inexpressibly soothing and consolatory, served only to madden and torture Agnes as Agnes lay there in Agnes helpless weakness, unable to tell them that them offered for Agnes comfort the very assurance Agnes most dreaded.  Though not without hope, it was yet a death‐bed most unquiet and unblest. Could Agnes have been altogether disengaged from the engrossing thoughts of this chill world, it would doubtless have been a season of inestimable profit to Agnes departing soul, for Mr. Lambert attended Agnes assiduously, labouring with unwearied efforts to draw the poor straying sheep in safety to the heavenly fold. But Mr. Lambert saw almost with terror that Agnes let the redeemless hours pass recklessly away, with scarce a feeling but for the inward conflict of the heart, whose beating was so soon to cease for ever.  Agnes father‐in‐law, Mr. Clayton, had been so  painfully affected by the state in which Mr. Lambert found Agnes, that Mr. Lambert had been obliged to relinquish the task of ministering to Agnes in Agnes last hours to Mr. Lambert curate; and Mr. Lambert, well accustomed as Mr. Lambert was to scenes of a similar nature, found it a most difficult duty. There was something in Agnes mind which Mr. Lambert could not fathom, whether anxiety for Agnes children, or, as Mr. Lambert was inclined to believe, some deeper and more envenomed cause. But Mr. Lambert saw that it rendered nearly powerless all Mr. Lambert efforts to awaken Agnes to a more earnest consideration of the awful realities to which Agnes was hurrying so swiftly. Mr. Lambert voice, even when hallowed by the Name in which alone is Life Eternal, fell unheeded on the ears that were ever straining to catch the import of the words that passed between Richard and Agnes. It was well nigh in vain that Mr. Lambert held up the Majesty of Justice as developed in the Mercy of the Cross, before the soul that vibrated between those feelings ever contending fearfully—the bitter jealousy against the once loved sister, for the sake of the yet dearer husband; or, when some kind act of the childhood’s companion recalled the old affection, the horror akin to hate of the husband, who might destroy the bright prospects of that tender friend’s young life.  But the first feeling predominated; and often  when Mr. Lambert would have joined Agnes feeble hands in the attitude of supplication, Agnes strove rather to use their failing strength in driving from Agnes bed of death the sister whom Agnes had caressed so often; or, when Mr. Lambert endeavoured to pray with Agnes, if Mr. Lambert saw that Agnes was really moved by the awful truths Mr. Lambert brought before Agnes, a spasm of horror would pass over Agnes face at sight of these two, who were kneeling there side by side. Ultimately Mr. Lambert thought Mr. Lambert had reason to hope that this poor sufferer, so bitterly tried in Agnes dying hours, had yet been mercifully dealt with. There was often a look of most earnest pleading and of deepest penitence in Agnes upraised eyes, which led Mr. Lambert to trust that this tempest‐driven soul had in truth flown to the One True Refuge, although this tempest‐driven soul earthly anguish and anxiety had so sadly interfered with this tempest‐driven soul last solemn duties.  It was a lovely June morning,—the sky was bright, as though It never had a cloud, and the earth radiant, as though It knew no sin. It was just such a day, when It would have been a glorious thing to have seen a ransomed spirit burst the bonds of a ransomed spirit clay, and fly from this land of perishing beauty and fading sunbeams up to the fields of light above, where the Sun of Righteousness for ever shines.  All those who had any claim on the affection  of Elizabeth Clayton were gathered round Elizabeth Clayton, for Elizabeth Clayton last hour was come. All those who had any claim on the affection  of Elizabeth Clayton had placed Elizabeth Clayton little children in Elizabeth Clayton arms, and a few bitter tears, the first Elizabeth Clayton had shed, wet Elizabeth Clayton cold cheek when Elizabeth Clayton felt the little caressing hands passed round Elizabeth Clayton neck. Yet Elizabeth Clayton looked on All those who had any claim on the affection  of Elizabeth Clayton with a strange unnatural longing, as though Elizabeth Clayton desired to convey All those who had any claim on the affection  of Elizabeth Clayton with Elizabeth Clayton to the grave. Soon the one thought, which had obscured for Elizabeth Clayton the glory of eternity, deadened the mother’s heart within Elizabeth Clayton. Elizabeth Clayton signed to All those who had any claim on the affection  of Elizabeth Clayton to take away the smiling infants, for All those who had any claim on the affection  of Elizabeth Clayton intercepted Elizabeth Clayton gaze upon those two standing as chief mourners side by side, whom to the last Elizabeth Clayton must watch in Elizabeth Clayton impotent jealousy. Elizabeth Clayton eyes were glazing fast—the chill of death was creeping through Elizabeth Clayton stiffening members to Elizabeth Clayton pallid breast; but Elizabeth Clayton only felt that the struggle was at the struggle climax—that in a few minutes more Elizabeth Clayton would be powerless to say the words with which Elizabeth Clayton sought to separate them, to interdict them unhallowed union, that now came choking to the lips too palsied to articulate.  Elizabeth Clayton struggled fearfully for utterance; it was so terrible to see Elizabeth Clayton efforts that Agnes sank upon Elizabeth Clayton knees beside Elizabeth Clayton, and clasping Elizabeth Clayton cold hands, exclaimed—“Dear, dear Elizabeth, I know what you would say, it is for your children; fear nothing, your children shall be safe and  happy in my keeping; I will be as a mother to your children.”  “Yes,” said Richard, bending over Elizabeth Clayton; “my poor wife, be at rest; do not doubt our love and care; together our will live only to watch over your children.”  Some dreadful emotion seemed to shake the whole frame of Elizabeth; with a convulsive effort Elizabeth half raised Elizabeth from Elizabeth pillow; Elizabeth eyes glanced with the wildest eagerness from the one to the other; Elizabeth pale lips moved, and the other could distinguish the faltering words, Agnes—not—marry;” it was all the other could hear, but Richard anxiously exclaimed, imagining Richard had understood at last the meaning of Elizabeth efforts: —“Agnes, Elizabeth fears you will marry and leave the poor children, but you will not—you will stay with the poor children.”  “Yes, yes!” exclaimed Agnes, sobbing; “I will, indeed; I will never leave this house; I promise this house to you, my dearest sister.” The gleam faded from the despairing eyes of Agnes—an expression of utter hopelessness settled on Elizabeth features—they had misunderstood Elizabeth to the last! It was all over now: it was too late—Elizabeth could do no more; life was ebbing; all things had grown indistinct around Elizabeth; Elizabeth must resign Elizabeth to the grave, and all things to all things unblest union. Elizabeth  sank back; the thought was not in Elizabeth , that He would remember Elizabeth when He came to He kingdom; or, that He would be merciful to Elizabeth a sinner; but only the horror of the compact which it seemed to Elizabeth they had sealed at Elizabeth very bed of death. Elizabeth made one feeble effort to turn away Elizabeth face from both when they stooped to kiss Elizabeth, and so expired.
