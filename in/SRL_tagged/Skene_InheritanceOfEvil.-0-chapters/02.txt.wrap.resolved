SOME time had elapsed since the marriage of Elizabeth and Richard Clayton; already the spring was brightening into summer for the second time since the marriage of Elizabeth and Richard Clayton had resided at “the Mount;” and the interval had, to all appearance, been a season of unmixed prosperity for them all.  Mr. and Mrs. Clayton enjoyed the utmost esteem and consideration among the inhabitants of B— and the vicinity, whilst Mr. and Mrs. Clayton sister, Agnes Maynard, was a universal favourite. Her peculiarly attractive appearance, sweet disposition, and joyousness of spirit, had won the affection of all to whom Her was known. Her was at least beyond a doubt most truly happy: happy in the society of Her sister, and in the warm friendship of Her brother‐in‐law, whom Her had sought to propitiate by every means in Her power, in order that the harmony of their domestic life might be completed.  The birth of a daughter had been no small  addition to the happiness of Elizabeth and Richard; more especially to the latter, who felt for this little infant all that passionate tenderness which a young father so often feels for a young father first‐born child. a young father was also at this time highly gratified to find that a young father popularity was increasing considerably; a young father had acquired greater weight and influence as a married man. a young father wife and Elizabeth beautiful sister were much sought after and respected by the leading families of the county, and a young father soon found that a young father might take a high position in the neighbourhood.  And yet, surrounded with all these outward blessings, Elizabeth Clayton was very wretched. Elizabeth Clayton father‐in‐law had in vain endeavoured to draw the wandering gaze of Her father‐in‐law dimmed eyes upward to that glorious Star, on which if a man look steadily, a man shall learn to take no heed of the mortal tempests roaring round a man head, or the fading of all mortal joys; a man had found an insurmountable barrier to all a man efforts in the overwhelming and almost idolatrous love which Elizabeth Clayton bore to Elizabeth Clayton husband. The love of Him, who first loved us, alone should reign supreme in the immortal soul, and all other feelings be the rather called fourth by it, as flowers give out fragrance when the sun shines on flowers; but if an earthly affection, however lawful in it, be permitted to supersede it, thereby becoming  a sinful indulgence, then does the holier love fade and perish away before that engrossing influence, like the pure sunlight when the night sets in.  Day and night, waking and sleeping, Elizabeth had no thought but for Elizabeth ; watching her husband every word and look, thinking Elizabeth never could do enough to please her husband, and harassing both Elizabeth and her husband by exacting an amount of attention and tenderness which Elizabeth was by no means justified in expecting. The one overpowering idea which was always present in Elizabeth mind, was the conviction that her husband attachment for Elizabeth fell far short of Elizabeth own in depth and fervour.  Elizabeth was, in fact, very right in Elizabeth opinion, but this was no excuse for the unreasonable manner in which Elizabeth wearied him with Elizabeth repining at him coldness. Elizabeth should have remembered that there is but one affection that can be of any real value to those who inspire it, it is that love, noble and disinterested, which is pure from the slightest taint of selfishness; which has for it sole object and desire the happiness of those on whom it is bestowed. Elizabeth should never have allowed Elizabeth own feelings and desires to interfere in the most minute particular with him comfort. If Elizabeth discovered that Elizabeth presence wearied him, Elizabeth should have  left him with a smile, and with a smile been ready to return to him if him wished it. If him seemed happier while neglecting Elizabeth, cheerfully Elizabeth should have submitted to him neglect, and striven only to prevent him home from being ever darkened by a look of sorrow on Elizabeth face, or its quiet disturbed by a word of discontent. But Elizabeth had sought no other happiness for Elizabeth than that which Elizabeth derived from this affection, and therefore it was profoundly selfish. Elizabeth was jealous of every thing and every one on whom Elizabeth husband bestowed a look; and jealous even of the necessary business which took her husband from Elizabeth side.  It was not unnatural that Richard, annoyed and often irritated at Elizabeth unceasing watchfulness, should gladly turn from Elizabeth to seek the society of Agnes, whose gaiety and light‐heartedness rendered Elizabeth so pleasing a contrast to the anxious care‐worn wife. her husband never acted under the guidance of principle, but her husband habitually obeyed a law scarce less exacting, for her husband invariably followed the bent of her husband own inclination, without pausing to scrutinize her husband motives, or to examine into the possible result of her husband actions. It therefore never occurred to her husband, that It must have cost poor Elizabeth many a bitter pang to see her husband so openly preferring the society of Elizabeth sister; while Agnes, with that careless egotism  to which the young and the happy so often yield themselves unconsciously, was ever ready to enjoy with her husband the long walks and rides which Elizabeth’s enfeebled health prevented Elizabeth’s from attempting.  Thus, while to a casual observer all was bright and prosperous in the lives of the Clayton family, there was ripening in the heart of Elizabeth’s who should have been the happiest, one of those dark tragedies which often run the Clayton family course in the narrow compass of an individual mind alone.  Soon, however, the anxieties and fears of poor Elizabeth took a new shape. poor Elizabeth health began to fail poor Elizabeth altogether. poor Elizabeth had reduced poor Elizabeth to a very weak and nervous state, solely by distress of mind and harassing annoyances; and now the conviction had settled with a dull dead weight upon poor Elizabeth heart, that poor Elizabeth should not survive the birth of poor Elizabeth second child.  This idea was in reality but an imagination springing from poor Elizabeth morbid state of mind, for which there was not the slightest foundation; but the conviction, deeply rooted, ate like a canker into poor Elizabeth soul. It was not death which poor Elizabeth dreaded, not the coffin and the shroud; nor yet, chained to the dust as poor Elizabeth was by the ties of earth, the awful judgment to come; but it was the horror of the dread which filled poor Elizabeth  heart night and day, that when poor Elizabeth lay cold and helpless in poor Elizabeth grave, Richard would find some unknown stranger, fairer and dearer, to take poor Elizabeth place in Richard love and in Richard home. To a mind like Elizabeth’s this thought was torture; this thought haunted Elizabeth like a spectral phantom: Elizabeth had loved Richard too exclusively when living, to give Richard up even when Elizabeth was dead; and Elizabeth longed, had it been possible, to have held Richard still within the stiff cold arms from which the warmth of life was fled. Elizabeth had ever before Elizabeth eyes the terrible image of one more loved perhaps, who should dwell in his house as Elizabeth had dwelt, and walk by his side as Elizabeth had walked, honoured, cherished as his wife, the mother of his children. This vision of Elizabeth brain took a thousand agonizing forms. Sometimes Elizabeth fancied that through the mould, and the dust, and the coffin‐lid, Richard voice would reach Elizabeth if Richard spoke in accents of endearment to another; that, Elizabeth should even hear the tramping of their feet round Elizabeth dark abode as their walked through the beautiful church‐yard, too happy in their mutual affection to think of Elizabeth who mouldered there so lonely! And Elizabeth child, too—Elizabeth little fragile, gentle Mary, was Elizabeth to be delivered to the cold unloving care of a stepmother!  Over these ideas the jealous heart of Elizabeth  brooded with all the strength of Elizabeth   diseased fancy; but suddenly, whilst Elizabeth   speculated on the probable results of Elizabeth   death, a thought occurred to Elizabeth   which brought with a thought at once the most complete consolation.  The sincere attachment of Richard to Agnes became the source of Agnes utmost joy and thankfulness; Richard would never consent to part with Agnes sister, now become in affection, as well as in actual fact, Richard own also; Richard would never send Agnes away to a miserable and cheerless existence with the Hardmans: no, Agnes would remain with Richard to take carevof Agnes little niece, of whom Agnes was devotedly fond; and so long as Agnes continued unmarried, Agnes would prevent; the possibility of another wife entering into the house of which Agnes would be the beloved inmate. This idea gave a totally new current to Elizabeth’s thoughts; This idea was like balm to Elizabeth wounded spirit; Elizabeth could look forward with perfect calm to her death, when Elizabeth felt convinced that, so far from her place being filled by a rival, Richard and Agnes would remain alone together to remember Elizabeth, and talk of Elizabeth often with unchanging love, whilst Elizabeth little Mary would find in the young aunt the same tender and watchful friend which Elizabeth had Elizabeth been to Agnes.  Elizabeth had never concealed from either  Richard or Agnes how near a close Elizabeth believed Elizabeth life to be, although Elizabeth natural delicacy of feeling had restrained Elizabeth from telling them of the dread which rendered this conviction one of such agony to Elizabeth.  Now, however, Elizabeth repeatedly implored of them both to promise Elizabeth that Agnes should always remain with Elizabeth brother‐in‐law; urging as Elizabeth reason for wishing it, that to Elizabeth alone would Elizabeth commit the care of Elizabeth little daughter, and the new‐born babe if it survived.  Both were very willing to promise Both poor Elizabeth all Elizabeth desired, but neither of Both had the slightest apprehension for her life. Both medical adviser was too skilful a physician not to know that Elizabeth fears were perfectly groundless, and Their medical adviser had completely reassured Agnes on the subject; Both therefore contented Both with soothing Elizabeth in the mean time, and looked forward anxiously to the period when all anxiety should cease.  Such was the state of matters at “The Mount,” when Elizabeth took Elizabeth seat one fine evening in the early summer at the drawing‐room window, which was thrown wide open that Elizabeth might enjoy the soft mild air; directly below it was a smooth piece of turf, on which Richard was slowly walking to and fro in conversation with Richard father’s Curate.   Richard was one of those characters which are, too unfortunately, rare in this world, but of which alone shall doubtless be composed the population of that Holy City, where nothing that defileth shall in any wise enter in: with a powerful mind, and many a noble intellectual quality, Richard had sought and attained to the innocency of life and humility of heart of a little child, who once was set as an example to the gifted of this earth.  From the hour when Richard had received the awful commission for the work and office of a priest in the Church of God, Richard had, with determinate resolution, set the seal of “Holiness to God” on every action of Richard future life. Severe and unflinching towards Richard in following out this difficult course, Richard was ever most gentle and merciful to others; winning back to the old paths with sweet persuasive accents those who had erred and strayed, and dealing with penitents in the spirit of that unutterably blessed and touching declaration which has been as the words of life to many a sinking soul—“ Neither do I condemn thee.”  Notwithstanding thee youth, there was a peculiar calm and dignity in thee manner which won the respect of all whom thee approached; though few would have suspected, from thee habitual silence and reserve, that there was in thee cha‐  racter an under current of profound and intense feeling, which thee seldom if ever displayed. Careless and indifferent as Richard Clayton was, Richard Clayton could not but admire the pure and exalted views which raised this man so far above this man; and this man was always more ready to listen to Richard’s remonstrances than to the sterner warnings of Richard father, whose faith and obedience shone forth rather in the severity of holiness than in the severity of holiness beauty.  whose faith and obedience conversation was distinctly audible to Elizabeth as Elizabeth sat at the window, and Elizabeth soon became so deeply and painfully interested in it that Elizabeth forgot to ascertain whether whose faith and obedience were aware of Elizabeth vicinity. Richard had asked Richard what was the cause of a tumult which Richard had witnessed that morning at the church door, as Richard passed through the village.  Richard answered that it had originated in one of those distressing cases which were often a source of so much annoyance to the clergy. Two persons had come before Richard to be married; Two persons did not belong to this parish of B—, and the banns had been published elsewhere; consequently, it was not until Two persons were actually within the church that Richard discovered the relationship in which Two persons already stood to one another. Elizabeth was sister to the former wife of the man.   “Of course I refused to marry Two persons,” Richard added quietly.  “Then you share my father’s opinion,” said Richard. “I think Richard quite absurdly rigid on this point. I cannot coincide in the strong objection which is raised against it by so many. Such a marriage might often be a very convenient arrangement.”  “And a most unhallowed alliance,” said Richard, warmly.  “You will find few to look upon it in that light,” replied Richard; “think how frequently the connexion is made without the slightest scruple.”  “There is nothing so common in this world as evil,” said Richard, with quiet emphasis; “you may give men authority to commit the greatest crimes with impunity, if men are to find men license for it in the practice of others.” Richard paused, for Richard’s peculiar position rendered this a subject scarce fit for discussion.  Richard, however, would not let the matter drop till Richard had very clearly made known Richard own opinion; Richard spoke much of the advantage which might result from such an arrangement, in procuring for the children of the deceased wife so kind and natural a protectress as the children of the deceased wife aunt.   Richard replied, that, were the matter viewed as the matter ought to be, there could be no more reason why the sister of the mother should not remain to take care of the children than the sister of my father. Even on the score of expediency alone, Richard could show the incalculable evil of such connexions, bringing distrust and misery and confusion into the nearest and dearest relations of life; but it was on a far higher ground that Richard would denounce them, that of being altogether repugnant to the will of God; a fact which might be proved from Scripture, and which had been set forth by the authority of the Church in all ages. It was, in fact, a putting asunder of those whom God had joined in the holy tie, whereby God declared that man and wife were to be one flesh: if there were any meaning in those words at all, the relations of the one must become the relations of the other also, and the sister‐in‐law be in the sight of heaven counted as the sister in blood.  Richard could not answer this argument, though Richard still held to Richard own opinion; and after a few more remarks from both, the conversation changed. But Richard Clayton had heard enough, and too much.  Richard little knew what deadly power there had been in Richard words so carelessly spoken. Richard did not see, as Richard voice died away, how a figure  rushed from that darkened room with hurried steps and suffocated breath; a figure   did not hear how the bolt was drawn across the door of the apartment above, by a hand that trembled till the bolt was well nigh palsied; nor the dull heavy fall upon the ground, of a form convulsed by its fierce mental agony.  One thought alone was present in the mind of Richard Clayton—a thought so torturing and unsupportable that Richard Clayton strove to escape from it with that impotent frenzy which in it full development drives men to the awful crime of self‐destruction. Richard Clayton had a RIVAL in Richard Clayton ! The wife whom Richard Clayton had dreaded would supplant Richard Clayton after Richard Clayton , would be Richard Clayton, who for two years past had called Richard Clayton husband—brother! It was an idea too horrible even to have entered into Richard Clayton mind, had It not been literally forced upon Richard Clayton by the words of Richard.  Elizabeth had not the strong religious principles which induced Richard to view it with such warm indignation, but Elizabeth had that which in this instance supplied their place—the instinctive delicacy of feeling with which a pure mind must revolt from a transaction so opposed to all that is just and holy. What a horrible shade was now cast over the past intercourse of Elizabeth husband and sister, and the happy  familiarity Elizabeth had Elizabeth loved to promote between her husband and sister! It maddened Elizabeth even to think of the result which would probably follow on Elizabeth own death. Instead of living to watch over Elizabeth children and remember Elizabeth with unchanged affection, Instead of living to watch over her children would remain together in a union condemned of God, and reprobated even by the world itself.  Had Elizabeth then, when Elizabeth gave her sister a home, been but preparing for Elizabeth a rival, who would hereafter blot out Elizabeth very memory from the heart of the husband Elizabeth loved so well? Oh! surely Elizabeth had in truth been nourishing a viper in Elizabeth bosom: but at least it should be so no longer; Elizabeth would not sit idly by and see another preparing, under such false pretences, to rob Elizabeth of the love which Elizabeth would have had Elizabeth own even in the grave. Elizabeth started upElizabeth Elizabeth was ever violent in Elizabeth resolutions as well as in Elizabeth feelings—Elizabeth went to the door, scarce knowing what Elizabeth did, strong in one determination only—that Elizabeth should not stay another day in the house, to rise up between Elizabeth and the husband whose affection was Elizabeth lawful right.  Suddenly, as Elizabeth was about to draw the bolt, Elizabeth started and staggered back; a vision passed before Elizabeth of a scene never forgotten. Elizabeth saw the pale, death‐stricken face; the uplifted  hands of the expiring mother, clasped in passionate entreaty to Elizabeth the daughter! Elizabeth heard again that voice, coming so faint and thrilling over the cold lips—  “ElizabethElizabeth! I trust to Elizabeth alone! promise—swear that you will never desert my child; swear that no dearer tie shall ever induce you to forsake your charge!” And Elizabeth heard, as it were, the echo of Elizabeth own voice when Elizabeth answered, child as Elizabeth was, with such a solemn firmness—  “ Elizabeth, fear not; I promise—I swear!”  And was it thus Elizabeth was about to redeem that pledge given to the dead—to fulfil that oath administered on a death‐bed?—by driving forth Agnes, that mother’s youngest darling, from Elizabeth house and home; casting Elizabeth out into that dangerous and chilling world, where Elizabeth would be so friendless and alone!  There was a sudden revulsion of feeling in the breast of Elizabeth; a new horror rose out of the idea of this unhallowed marriage. Was Agnes, the gentle Agnes, so fair and joyous, thereby to become a being unworthy of the favour of heaven, and an outcast even from society? Was the sister for whom she had indulged in so many a bright ambitious dream, reserved for such a fate as this?—a wife disowned both by the laws of God and man!   Elizabeth flung Elizabeth down once more with a sort of powerless despair. Which of these two was Elizabeth to hate the most, whom, until now, Elizabeth had so dearly loved—the husband, who, by his selfish act, might blight and blacken the whole existence of Elizabeth only sister; or the sister, who, under that sacred name, had stolen into the husband’s heart, to dwell happy in the husband love when Elizabeth was mouldering forgotten in the dust? Elizabeth thoughts became confused—Elizabeth senses seemed abandoning Elizabeth—the shock had been so sudden. Elizabeth had never before contemplated the possibility of such a marriage. Elizabeth had believed She had never before contemplated the possibility of such a marriage forbidden by all laws, Divine or human; and now, not only was She had never before contemplated the possibility of such a marriage brought suddenly before Elizabeth as a matter of frequent occurrence, but there had been an energy and an anxiety in Richard’s manner of expressing himself, which proved that, however unconsciously, it was yet for himself own sake that himself sought so earnestly to prove the truth of himself assertions.  There is a peculiar faculty in the human mind, which sometimes causes it, when a new and absorbing idea is first presented to it, at once to grasp it in it full extent, in all it bearings—past, present, and future. Richard’s vivid imagination would not allow Elizabeth to find consolation in the great uncertainty of the evil Elizabeth dreaded; Elizabeth’s vivid imagination carried Elizabeth on at once to antici‐  pate the marriage of Elizabeth husband and sister as the infallible result of Elizabeth own death,—now, as Elizabeth believed, so near at hand. With Elizabeth face buried in Elizabeth hands, Elizabeth lay on the ground, wrestling with the great agony of all the contending feelings which this terrible conviction had aroused within Elizabeth.  Meanwhile Richard and Agnes sat together in the drawing‐room below. “Where is Elizabeth?” said Agnes, at last; “I have not seen Elizabeth at all this evening.”  “I really do not know,” said Richard, indifferently; “perhaps Elizabeth has gone to lie down. Elizabeth fancies Elizabeth fatigued now, whenever Elizabeth has made the slightest exertion. Do go and sing to Richard, Agnes,” Richard continued, flinging aside Richard book; “this is just the hour when I can best enjoy music.”  Agnes complied, and in a few minutes Elizabeth could distinguish, through the choking sobs that were bursting from Elizabeth own lips, the sweet tones of her sister voice, as Elizabeth sang, one after another, the favourite songs which Elizabeth husband most preferred.  “It is strange that Elizabeth does not come,” said Agnes, after a time; “Elizabeth never goes to spend the evening in Elizabeth room without telling us at least. I must go and see where Elizabeth is.”  “Some fancy!” said Richard, in a tone of  irritation. “You had better leave Elizabeth to Elizabeth. I wish Elizabeth had your sweet temper, Agnes.”  Agnes made no answer: it had often seemed strange to Agnes that Elizabeth was not in truth more uniformly happy, with so many blessings round Agnes. Agnes left her room in search of Agnes ; but in an instant Agnes returned, with an agitated step, and a look of terror on Agnes face, usually so bright and sunny.  “Richard, come quickly!” Agnes exclaimed; “I quite fear that Elizabeth is very ill: Elizabeth door is locked, and Elizabeth made no answer when I called, but I can hear Elizabeth groaning in so strange a manner!”  Richard started from Richard seat, and bounded up stairs; Agnes followed. They knocked at her door, and called in vain; but They could hear moan succeeding moan. Alarmed to the last degree, Richard exerted all Richard strength, and burst open her door. The violent shock, and the stunning noise it occasioned, put the finishing stroke to the agitation of Elizabeth’s nerves and the confusion of Elizabeth mind. Elizabeth husband rushed in: all that Her husband saw was Elizabeth form stretched on the ground, trembling and convulsed. Her husband flung Her husband on Her husband knees beside Elizabeth, and lifted up Elizabeth head; whilst Agnes, kneeling close to Her husband, drew back the long  tangled hair that hung over her sister livid face. Elizabeth opened Elizabeth eyes: they were full of the most wild and ghastly expression. A terrible fear shot through the mind of Richard that Elizabeth had suddenly become insane. There was, in truth, a sort of chaos in Elizabeth thoughts; but one idea remained too fearfully distinct.  Elizabeth gaze fell upon Agnes, and Elizabeth heart revolted with unnatural horror against Elizabeth dear and only sister. Half frantic, Elizabeth started up: with the strength almost of a maniac, Elizabeth seized Agnes by the arm, which Elizabeth had rested on the shoulder of Richard, and flung Elizabeth back with such force, that Elizabeth fell headlong against the wall. Richard uttered a cry of terror; Richard really thought Elizabeth had killed Elizabeth. Richard flew to Agnes, and raised Elizabeth in Richard arms. Elizabeth was only stunned, not hurt. Elizabeth looked up in Richard face, and smiled, to reassure Richard. Elizabeth gazed upon them for a moment, as though Elizabeth quivering frame were turning into stone. Then, stretching out her hands towards Her husband, Elizabeth exclaimed, in words which Her husband then attributed to the ravings of delirium, but which years after haunted Her husband with a fearful meaning, “Oh, Richard, Richard! Elizabeth is your sister—your sister—your sister!”  There was something so horrible in the tone in which your sister reiterated these words, that Agnes  flew towards Agnes  , and strove to pass Agnes   round Agnes  , calling Agnes   by every endearing name. But Elizabeth disengaged Elizabeth from Elizabeth embrace, and, sinking on the sofa, Elizabeth began to utter shriek on shriek, evidently in great bodily agony.  In another hour Elizabeth was alarmingly ill, and before morning a little feeble child had been brought prematurely into the world, in which it seemed too fragile to exist; and the life of the mother was despaired of.
