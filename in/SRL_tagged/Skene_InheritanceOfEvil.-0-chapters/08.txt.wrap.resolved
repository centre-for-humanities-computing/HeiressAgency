MR. CLAYTON left B— the following week, and Mr. Lambert duly communicated to all the parishioners the reasons which had induced CLAYTON so to do. The event made a most powerful impression on them all. them all Vicar could not have taken any step which could have brought more strongly before them all Their Vicar uncompromising submission to the call of duty whenever the call of duty demanded the surrender of Their Vicar own will, and also Their Vicar deep disapprobation of that act of Their Vicar son’s which Their Vicar was compelled thus openly to reprobate—but Their Vicar was greatly beloved. Their Vicar departure was bitterly lamented, and a strong feeling against Richard and Agnes soon pervaded the village. What CLAYTON condemned, CLAYTON people felt must be very wrong, and the marriage was loudly spoken against by all.  Never had Mr. Sharp enjoyed a season of such exquisite repose as that which followed the departure of Their Vicar from B—. The event would alone, at any time, have been sufficient to have engrossed the mind of Their Vicar energetic wife, and provided his energetic wife with a fund of matter whereon to  exercise his energetic wife conversational powers; but the circumstances attending it, the unlawful marriage, and the indignation which was felt against Richard and Agnes, were indeed to his energetic wife sources of absorbing delight and occupation, such as his energetic wife had seldom known. With ineffable satisfaction his energetic wife husband saw his energetic wife sally forth every morning, without having even remembered to take that peculiar cognizance of her husband own proceedings for the day, which often inspired her husband with a wild and frantic desire to embark forthwith for New Zealand, or to fly and endeavour to make a fortune in Kamtschatka. Mr. Sharp might do as Mr. Sharp pleased now; Mr. Sharp might have written a letter every day to Mr. Sharp client without his energetic wife looking over his client shoulder, and his client might have drawn up ever so many marriage contracts without his energetic wife even asking who the parties were. Mr. Sharp was far too busy to think of his client at all; and not only Mr. Sharp ceased for the time to watch over his client affairs, but Mr. Sharp resigned all thought of attending to his client comforts. This was, however, one of the conditions of his client unwonted peace to which that greatly persecuted gentleman was too happy to agree, and no one interfered with the excited lady in the pursuit of Mr. Sharp present delightful occupation.  What in truth could be more charming than to go from house to house, informing every one  that, after the most reprehensible conduct of Agnes, it would be impossible to visit Agnes, or to acknowledge Agnes acquaintance? Agnes! the haughty and exclusive person, who had refused to call upon Agnes! Mr. Sharp had such really substantial grounds for all Mr. Sharp said, that Mr. Sharp was listened to with more attention than Mr. Sharp usually met with.  There was one painful idea, which had long been floating in the minds of those acquainted with the circumstances, which Mr. Sharp now assisted in ripening into certainty—it was the belief that Elizabeth’s melancholy death had been occasioned by Elizabeth jealousy of Elizabeth husband and sister. Such being the case, nothing certainly could seem more revolting than the whole conduct of Agnes and Richard; and even the most charitable of Agnes and Richard neighhours could not but think that Agnes and Richard were not only devoid of all principle, but heartless and indelicate to the last degree, in thus speedily reaping the fruits of Elizabeth death in Agnes and Richard unblest union, and returning, without remorse or fear, to the very home where Elizabeth had dwelt whom Agnes and Richard had sent to Elizabeth grave by so cruel a means. Mr. Sharp loved to expatiate on these points with a warm enthusiasm, but Mr. Sharp found that Mr. Sharp eloquence was scarcely required to heighten the universal indignation. And then Mr. Sharp would  rush out to waylay Mr. Lambert at every corner, and detain Mr. Lambert for a whole half hour, while Mr. Sharp condoled with Mr. Lambert on having so much to do since Mr. Clayton’s departure, or comforted Mr. Lambert by assuring Mr. Lambert that Mr. Lambert might do what Mr. Lambert would, but that Mr. Lambert never could make up to the people for the people good old Vicar. Mr. Lambert was far too young, so it was no fault of Mr. Lambert; but Mr. Sharp had no doubt Mr. Lambert would kill Mr. Lambert in trying, for Mr. Lambert looked very ill, and Mr. Sharp did not think Mr. Lambert had long to live; but if Mr. Lambert did die, they would at least know at whose door to lay Mr. Lambert death. It was Richard Clayton who would be guilty of it, as Mr. Lambert had sent away Mr. Lambert father, besides all the other mischief Mr. Lambert had done.  At first Richard and Agnes were scarcely aware of the universal condemnation of first Richard and Agnes union. first Richard and Agnes had become more cheerful, in the hope that first Richard and Agnes had exaggerated the extent to which first Richard and Agnes would be lowered in the opinion of the world; but first Richard and Agnes soon found that he had spoken but too truly; he own proceedings with regard to first Richard and Agnes had rendered it necessary for all persons of any weight in the society of the neighhourhood to adopt a marked line of conduct in the matter; and first Richard and Agnes decision was soon made. first Richard and Agnes were by birth and education entitled to delicacy of feeling; and Richard Clayton who would be guilty of it had not been for  so many years first Richard and Agnes pastor without instilling into their pastor minds somewhat of Richard Clayton who would be guilty of it purity and strictness of principle. first Richard and Agnes determined that the brother and sister‐in‐law, now man and wife, were not to be visited or received; and the few influenced the many: it became the fashion to slight the brother and sister‐in‐law, now man and wife, were not to be visited or received as it had been the fashion to court the brother and sister‐in‐law, now man and wife, were not to be visited or received, and the brother and sister‐in‐law, now man and wife, were not to be visited or received were cut off from all society, except of such persons as the brother and sister‐in‐law, now man and wife, were not to be visited or received did not care to associate with. This trial, which to some minds would have been a light evil, was to the brother and sister‐in‐law, now man and wife, were not to be visited or received a most serious and grievous distress; it galled the proud spirit of Richard; it wounded the morbid sensibility of Agnes; it deprived the brother and sister‐in‐law, now man and wife, were not to be visited or received both of the excitement and amusement, without which the brother and sister‐in‐law, now man and wife, were not to be visited or received felt as though the brother and sister‐in‐law, now man and wife, were not to be visited or received could not exist. Richard became irritable and fretful; Richard wife was weighed down by a heavy despondency which his wife sought to hide under a forced unnatural gaiety.  After a time Agnes determined to enliven Agnes dreary hours at least by resuming his wife visits in the village. his wife mind had been so much preoccupied for some time past that his wife had neglected his wife poorer friends completely; but his wife had always been beloved and respected amongst her poorer friends. his wife felt that now, humble as her poorer friends were, even her poorer friends homage and attention would be soothing to his wife.   On a beautiful mourning in the early spring, his wife went out into the village, nothing doubting that his wife would be received as his wife had always been; for his wife and his wife husband had never thought of inquiring into the opinion of she and her husband humbler neighbours respecting she and her husband conduct. The first person his wife went to visit, was old Martha Hyans, who, with her husband, were parishioners of long standing in the village of B—. This good old couple exhibited in parishioners of long standing in the village of B—. lives a practical refutation of the saying, that love cannot exist in a cottage, more especially if love be allied to poverty. The little hut where they dwelt had been decked, fifty years before, for they wedding‐day; and the love that bound they, now wrinkled and decrepit as they were, was fresh and pure as in they prime of youth and joy. they had gone through many trials together in that narrow space, but never had an unkind word passed the lips of either. Poor Elizabeth had often felt that Poor Elizabeth might have learnt a valuable lesson from old Martha’s patient and tried affection; and now, of this good old woman’s many trials, it seemed to Poor Elizabeth that one of the greatest was Mr. Clayton’s departure. one of the greatest was Mr. Clayton’s departure had baptized Poor Elizabeth children, and laid more than one of her children in her children graves. Poor Elizabeth had verily trusted that one of the greatest was Mr. Clayton’s departure should have closed Poor Elizabeth eyes also. But one of the greatest was Mr. Clayton’s departure was gone; and  Poor Elizabeth knew perfectly well that one of the greatest was Mr. Clayton’s departure had good reasons for going. Poor Elizabeth never doubted that everything one of the greatest was Mr. Clayton’s departure did was right at all times; but in this instance, simple and humble as Poor Elizabeth was, Poor Elizabeth own opinion and feelings perfectly coincided with one of the greatest was Mr. Clayton’s departure. Poor Elizabeth childlike, unbiassed mind revolted against the union of Richard and Richard wife’s sister.  Agnes perceived the change in the old woman’s feelings towards Poor Elizabeth, the moment Poor Elizabeth entered the house. Poor Elizabeth was civil; but Poor Elizabeth manifested not the slightest pleasure on seeing Poor Elizabeth. Poor Elizabeth did not ask Poor Elizabeth advice, or detail Poor Elizabeth grievances, and positively declined accepting various little comforts which Agnes proposed to send Poor Elizabeth. The only words Poor Elizabeth spoke were, to inquire after the children, in a tone dearly full of profound commiseration for the little ones. Poor Elizabeth shook Poor Elizabeth head when Agnes volunteered the information that Richard was well, as though Poor Elizabeth thought Richard had no right to be so; and then sat sighing and lifting up her eyes in the most eloquent manner. Agnes made one last attempt to induce Agnes to speak, by quoting the Litany, which Poor Elizabeth was in the habit of repeating from beginning to end, for the edification of Agnes visitors; but even this tempting bait had no allurements to‐day. Agnes remained unmoved; and Agnes angrily left the house,  with the determination never to enter the house again. Agnes could not, however, yet believe it possible that Agnes was exiled from the society of the village, as well as that of the higher classes. Agnes attributed Poor Elizabeth’s conduct merely to Agnes peculiar attachment for Richard Clayton who would be guilty of it, and trusted to find matters very different in the other cottages where Agnes was going.  Agnes next visit was to Mrs. Savage, the hard‐featured, large‐handed Mrs. Savage, who was singularly unfortunate in appearance (to the annoyance of all lovers of the picturesque, as Agnes little dwelling was beyond measure charming and romantic), and who appeared for the last twenty years to have been engaged in the care of a huge baby, who never grew, and never became a day older,—a phenomenon which was to be accounted for by the fact that Agnes was constantly supplied with a succession of grandchildren, who, after a certain troublesome age, were removed, to be replaced with another just entering on it.  In the house of this good woman Agnes Agnes fared much worse than with Poor Elizabeth. Mrs. Savage did not scruple to tell Mrs. Savage openly all Mrs. Savage thought and felt, and all that was thought and felt by Mrs. Savage neighbours, on the subject of Richardsecond marriage; and Agnes brought Her next visit speedily to a conclusion, by hurrying  out to hide the indignant tears that rose to Mrs. Savage as Mrs. Savage listened.  Mrs. Savage walked along the road towards The Mount, Mrs. Savage heart swelling within Mrs. Savage, and as Mrs. Savage passed on Mrs. Savage perceived Thomas, the clerk and schoolmaster, the most respectful and estimable of men, coming towards Mrs. Savage. Instead of approaching to give Mrs. Savage all the details of the progress of Mrs. Savage class or of the choir, he passed on the other side with merely a grave salutation, which sufficiently proved to Mrs. Savage that henceforward the doors of the school were closed against Mrs. Savage.  Mrs. Savage had to pass yet another cottage before reaching home; another cottage was one of the humblest in B—, and was the abode of a poor imbecile creature, known in the village by the name of Jack, who lived in it with he old mother. he was perfectly harmless in he idiotcy, and was allowed to wander about at will, even within the grounds of The Mount. It was in fact he favourite resort, as Agnes took a particular interest in he, and always treated he with the utmost kindness. Mrs. Savage used to bring he he food herself, that Mrs. Savage might teach he to recognise Mrs. Savage; and now when he saw Mrs. Savage, he never failed to greet Mrs. Savage with he wild laugh of discordant glee. Jack was seated at the door of Jack house as Mrs. Savage approached, and starting  up, Jack ran to meet Mrs. Savage with a shout of delight. Mrs. Savage stopped to speak to Jack, and Jack stood joyfully before Mrs. Savage, clapping Jack hands, and muttering in Jack own senseless language Jack unintelligible expressions of pleasure.  Jack was little aware of the pang which Jack caused to Agnes at that moment, for there was in truth a most bitter sting in the thought that Jack was the first smile of kindness and the first words of welcome which had been bestowed upon Mrs. Savage that day, who formerly had been so warmly received by all. No sterner lesson could have been given to Mrs. Savage than this one fact, that Mrs. Savage had been shunned and scorned as one who had done an unholy deed, by all save this poor idiot, to whom it had pleased Heaven to deny the knowledge of right and wrong!  The bitter experience of this day was quite enough. Agnes now understood what was in fact the truth, that the poor people of the village had lost all respect for Agnes, and that consequently Agnes influence amongst the poor people of the village was gone for ever. The casualties of birth and education are by no means sufficient to command the esteem of the lower orders. The casualties of birth and education are keen and penetrating judges as to what is really estimable in the character of The casualties of birth and education superiors, and thoroughly alive to any inconsistency in The casualties of birth and education precepts and practice. The villagers of B—  thought that Agnes had greatly erred, and therefore it would have been in vain for Agnes to have talked to The villagers of B—   of the errors of The villagers of B—   own ways; whilst some of the younger girls possibly found no small excuse for levity in some of the younger girls conduct from the fact, that even the lady at The Mount had thought the Vicar’s notions on the subject of marriage so very strict, that marriage had distinctly acted against The villagers of B—  . Agnes felt all this, and though perhaps in Agnes secret heart Agnes acknowledged its justice, its justice was yet with a proud indignation that Agnes determined never again to visit a single person in the village.  The annoyance which all these circumstances caused to Richard and Richard wife is not to be told. On the fiery temper and undisciplined mind of the former especially, the effect was most grievous. Richard now found Richard deprived of all the amusement which hunting and similar occupations had afforded Richard, for Richard was far too proud ever to place Richard voluntarily in the society of those who would no longer admit Richard to those who would no longer admit him to their houses houses. Wounded to the uttermost by the treatment Richard had met with, Richard shut Richard up entirely in Richard own house, and gave way to a sullen, discontented state of mind, which was most distressing to all around Richard. A man without employment is always a miserable individual, and A man without employment had no intellectual resources.  A man without employment betook A man without employment to amusements which were frivolous and useless, if not pernicious; and much of A man without employment time, which now hung so heavily on A man without employment , was spent in exercising a most harassing control over A man without employment household. A man without employment occupied A man without employment with all the little petty arrangements and minor details on which it was painful to see the strong mind of a man engaged; and it almost seemed as though A man without employment sought to compensate A man without employment for the humiliations A man without employment met with in the world, by A man without employment overbearing treatment of A man without employment wife and servants.  In the midst of all this misery, for it was misery both to Agnes and Richard, though no positive misfortune had as yet befallen them, a gleam of sunshine came to revive them hearts in the birth of a son,—an event which soon banished all them regrets for the absence of Mary, who had long since been removed from her father’s house, to enter it no more for years.  On the other poor infant, the son of Elizabeth, Agnes had in truth bestowed the utmost care and attention ever since Agnes marriage. It had been chiefly on his account that they had taken this step, which in all other respects had proved so unfortunate; and it seemed to Agnes an imperative duty to render it productive of good results to this child at least. With unremitting tenderness Agnes had therefore watched  over his; all the careful affection which Richard had trusted Agnes would bestow upon his son, and which his son had married Agnes partly to ensure, Agnes did, indeed, give to the infant, whose health had greatly improved; and now, as though to show how very vainly (as well as sinfully) we would seek to interfere with the Providence of God, by doing evil that good may come, and what madness it is to follow any other course save that of rigid duty, (leaving the result submissively in his hands,) this child was suddenly taken from them. There had been no neglect, no illness even to cause them any apprehension; but unexpectedly one night this child was seized with convulsions, and died whilst them stood helpless beside this child. With a brief struggle this child brief life closed. Pure and innocent this child went with this child baptismal cross yet shining on this child brow, to join this child brethren who had borne theirs through the burden and heat of the day.  It was impossible for Richard and Agnes, as Richard and Agnes stood looking down upon that infant face—sublime now, because of the holy peace that was stamped upon it—not to perceive how clearly the sin and folly of their deed was pointed out to their in this bereavement. their had acted against the laws of God and man for the sake of these children; the one their had  themselves delivered up to their ’s charge, and the other had now been taken to a Care more tender still. No good could now result from their union to these or to any other; but their must reap its bitter fruits. And from that hour Richard and his wife repented them of the deed which them had done, because the world had visited them heavily for it; but them repented not yet of the crime, for the judgment of God was still to come.
