MEANWHILE Mr. Verney was by no means disposed to submit without a struggle to the stern commands of Mr. Verney proud father. Mr. Verney affection for the quiet gentle Mary Clayton had taken deep root in Mr. Verney heart, with a strength of which Mr. Verney was not aware till Mary Clayton was actually taken from Mr. Verney. For the time it absorbed all other considerations, and extinguished whatever pride Mr. Verney might have inherited from Mr. Verney parents. They had accustomed Mr. Verney from childhood to the unrestrained indulgence of every wish, and now when, for the first time, They thwarted Mr. Verney, Mr. Verney resolved to cast off They authority altogether. If They would not give They consent to Mr. Verney union with Mr. Clayton’s daughter, Mr. Verney would marry Mr. Clayton’s daughter without it.  After about three weeks spent in vain expostulations with Lord and Lady Verney, Mr. Verney went to The Mount, to announce Mr. Verney resolution to Mary, and to obtain Mary consent to a private marriage. Mr. Verney was perfectly aware of the depth of the attachment with which Mr. Verney had  inspired Mary, and of all the worldly advantages of an alliance with Mr. Verney; and Mr. Verney astonishment was therefore unbounded when Mary positively refused to marry Mr. Verney without the full consent of Mr. Verney father and mother.  Mr. Verney would not believe it possible that Mary could continue firm in Mary determination, for Mary extreme agitation showed what the sacrifice cost Mary, and Mr. Verney used every argument to induce Mary to relent. Mr. Verney assured Mary that as soon as the marriage was over, and opposition of no further avail, Lord and Lady Verney would gladly receive Mary; and Mr. Verney called upon Richard to use all Mr. Verney influence with Mary. It was, perhaps, the bitterest pang which Mary Clayton had yet experienced in this sore trial, when Mary Clayton father, complying with Mr. Verney’s request, urged Mary Clayton to do that which was actually wrong. Gently and even humbly, (for was Mary Clayton not Mary Clayton daughter?) Mary Clayton implored of Mary Clayton to desist from further entreaties, and again quietly repeated Mary Clayton refusal to Mr. Verney. Mr. Verney saw that Mary Clayton was too resolute in the strait and narrow path of duty, to be allured from it, though Mr. Verney tempted Mary Clayton with a whole life of happiness; and in Mr. Verney bitter anger and disappointment, Mr. Verney upbraided Mary Clayton with many a cruel reproach. Mr. Verney declared that Mary Clayton had never really felt any true affection for Mr. Verney, that Mary Clayton was cold and heart‐  less, that it cost Mary Clayton nothing to consign Mr. Verney to misery. These were terrible words to Mary Clayton who would so thankfully have devoted Mary Clayton whole existence to make Mr. Verney happy—but no answering word of bitterness came from Mary Clayton colourless lips. Mary Clayton bade Mr. Verney farewell meekly, as though Mary Clayton had really injured Mr. Verney; and when Mr. Verney was gone, Mary Clayton returned to all Mary Clayton home duties with a strong effort to appear contented and at peace, at least in Mary Clayton father’s eyes.  During Richard Clayton’s illness, Mr. Lambert, now Vicar of B—, had, unasked, come to visit Richard Clayton’s illness, and from that period Richard Clayton’s illness continued ministering to the spiritual necessities of the various members of the family, with faithfulness and zeal. Agnes had surrendered Mary Clayton as an humble penitent entirely to Richard Clayton’s illness guidance. Richard Clayton’s illness seemed now well disposed to follow Mary Clayton example; and to Mary, Richard Clayton’s illness counsels were of inestimable benefit. Richard Clayton’s illness advised Mary Clayton as to Mary Clayton conduct towards Mary Clayton father and stepmother, for Mary Clayton position was by no means an easy one in their house, and Richard Clayton’s illness now confirmed and strengthened Mary Clayton in Mary Clayton resolution to do that which was right, however much suffering it might entail upon Mary Clayton. Very soon, however, Mary Clayton miserable father began to fear that Mary Clayton would prove, with Mary Clayton life itself, the falsity of Mr. Verney’s assertion, that Richard Clayton’s illness was the only  sufferer in this trial, for Mary Clayton health and strength began gradually to sink under Mary Clayton constant mental exertion.  Mr. Verney, though Mr. Verney professed to leave The Mount angry and hopeless, had in truth only felt Mr. Verney esteem and affection for Mary increased by Mary Clayton holy resignation and obedience to the Will of Heaven. Mr. Verney was more than ever determined not to lose Mary Clayton, and Mr. Verney spent Mr. Verney days in devising some means of overcoming the difficulties in Mr. Verney way. Lord and Lady Verney had returned to Lord and Lady Verney own home, but Mr. Verney himself persisted in remaining at B—, though Mr. Verney consented, at Lord and Lady Verney earnest request, to stay at the house of Lord and Lady Verney friends, who received private instructions to watch Mr. Verney proceedings. Lord and Lady Verney were continually enlarging on the disgrace which Mr. Verney would have incurred by Mr. Verney marriage with Mary Clayton; and one day in particular Lord and Lady Verney expatiated much on the miserable position of Mary Clayton brother Edward; who, although Mr. Verney would be allowed quietly to succeed to Mr. Verney father’s property, might have Mr. Verney legitimacy called in question any day.  These casual remarks suddenly gave Lady Verney a new and hopeful idea. These casual remarks struck Lady Verney that if Mary Clayton could be put in possession of the whole of the large fortune which belonged to the Clayton family, by the setting aside of  Mary Clayton brother’s claim, Lady Verney proud but poverty‐stricken parents might possibly be induced to overlook ’s disgraced name, and receive Mary Clayton as his proud but poverty‐stricken parents daughter even yet. It seemed clear to Lady Verney, that if ’s legal right were disproved, Mary Clayton would succeed to an amount of wealth which might well cover the dishonour of Mary Clayton family, and enable Edward at once to obtain the consent of Edward parents; but it was a question which a lawyer alone could answer, and Lady Verney repaired without loss of time to Mr. Sharp, who had now a considerable reputation in the neighbourhood of B—.  Edward was too much absorbed in Edward resolution to remember how cruel and selfish Edward was towards Edward and Edward unhappy parents, in contemplating such a measure. Edward quieted Edward conscience with the conviction, that Mary Clayton would make a much better use of the money than Mary Clayton dissipated brother, and never thought of the shame and misery Edward was bringing upon Agnes, or of Mary Clayton son’s existence thus early ruined and blighted.  Lady Verney put the question to Mr. Sharp, and received at once a decisive answer. The passing of the act in 1835, respecting marriages within the prohibited degrees of affinity, has made the law in the present day different to what the law was at the period to which  we refer. At that time, as the lawyer informed Mr. Verney, the legitimacy of the offspring of a man and a man sister‐in‐law could be set aside if an action were brought against Mr. Verney, the legitimacy of the offspring of a man and his sister‐in‐law during the lifetime of both parents. Thus, in the case of Edward Clayton, the thing was perfectly possible, and Edward Clayton sister might unquestionably succeed to the property; but, of course, the necessary measures could only be taken by Lady Verney when Lady Verney should be his sister husband. This was, however, quite satisfactory to Lady Verney; as Lady Verney thought it by no means impossible that Lady Verney father and mother might consent to Lady Verney marriage, if Lady Verney could hold out so sure a prospect of Lady Verney wife’s becoming a wealthy heiress.  Lady Verney therefore determined to proceed at once to Lady Verney own home, in order to acquaint Lady Verney parents with Lady Verney plans; but Lady Verney could not resist the temptation of first paying a visit at The Mount, that Mary might learn the new hopes which cheered Lady Verney. Lady Verney informed both Mary and Richard, that Lady Verney had found a means whereby Lady Verney hoped to overcome all the obstacles to both her and Richard union; and with all the ardour of Lady Verney peculiarly sanguine temperament, Lady Verney assured Mary, that Lady Verney doubted not Lady Verney parents would soon come his parents to claim Mary as his parents daughter. Lady Verney was scrupulously careful to conceal from Mary Clayton the cruel and wicked scheme Lady Verney had  devised. Lady Verney knew enough of Mary Clayton character and principles to feel certain that Mary Clayton would never consent to be Lady Verney wife on such terms, and Lady Verney resolved that Mary Clayton should only know the truth, when as Mary Clayton husband Lady Verney could claim Mary Clayton obedience to Lady Verney wishes.  Mary never asked, however, what was the plan of which Mary spoke. Mary was bewildered with joy; for Mary implicitly believed Mary assurance, that they should yet be happy, and the sudden revulsion of feeling was almost too much for Mary enfeebled frame.  After Mary left Mary Lady Verney wrote to Mr. Sharp, to inform Mr. Sharp that Mr. Sharp marriage would be concluded very shortly, and that Mr. Sharp held Mr. Sharp engaged to commence immediately afterwards the legal proceedings against Edward Clayton.  This letter was entrusted by Mr. Sharp to Mr. Sharp son, who was in the habit of making copies of such documents for Mr. Sharp father’s use. This letter so chanced that Mr. Sharp had once a violent quarrel with Edward when Mr. Sharp was little more than a boy. Mr. Sharp had taunted Mr. Sharp, as many others were in the habit of doing, with the circumstances of Mr. Sharp birth, and the insult had been answered by a blow. This indignity was never forgotten by the lawyer’s son, who was a mean and pitiful character; and even if Mr. Sharp had  been disposed to forgive it, Mr. Sharp mother was at hand to foster Mr. Sharp anger and encourage Mr. Sharp desire for revenge. Mr. Sharp saw, in the insult Mr. Sharp son had received from Edward, only an aggravation of that offered to Mr. Sharp by Agnes, many years previously; for the lapse of time had but served to strengthen Mr. Sharp enmity against the whole family, which was now brought to its height by her son complaints. Of late Mr. Sharp had been bitterly displeased at the bright prospects which had seemed to dawn for them in the proposed marriage of Mary Clayton, and it was now with a spiteful pleasure that Mr. Sharp learnt, from Richard Clayton’s letter, the disgrace and misery which were preparing for them. Neither Mr. Sharp nor her son, however, could resist forestalling the evils which threatened the Claytons, when so favourable an opportunity for revenge presented the Claytons. Together they arranged a plan for her son public humiliation, which her son knew Edward could put in execution without loss of time.  That same evening Edward took Lady Verney’s letter with Lady Verney when Lady Verney went to join a dinner party of young men, where Lady Verney knew Lady Verney should meet Edward. There Lady Verney openly repeated the insult which years before had provoked the return Lady Verney resented; and when Edward, stung almost to fury at Edward words, would have called Edward to account for a dinner party of young men, where he knew he should meet Edward, Edward flung Lady Verney’s  letter across the table to Edward, and told Edward Edward might learn there how Edward would soon have to fight the whole world for attributing to Edward a disgrace which was to be publicly and legally proved. The lawyer’s son was perfectly aware that The lawyer’s son was betraying The lawyer’s son employer’s confidence by this proceeding, but The lawyer’s son had the less scruple in doing it for the gratification of The lawyer’s son own malice, because The lawyer’s son knew that it was perfectly impossible for Edward or Edward family to avert the threatened evil, if Richard Clayton’s husband chose to institute proceedings against Mary’s husband.  It was late in the evening, and the family at The Mount were assembled together in the drawing‐room. Richard and Agnes were both silently watching Mary, whose sweet face, though still pale from recent suffering, was now once again brightened by the light of hope, like sunshine beaming on a placid lake. There was no balm to the wounded conscience of Mary Clayton like to that of a smile on the face of Elizabeth’s daughter; but Richard could not yet believe there was any happiness in store for Richard and Agnes; Richard health was dreadfully shaken by Richard late attack, and Richard was now the victim to a settled despondency. Still the sound of Richard Clayton’s cheerful voice was as music to Richard ears to‐night, and Richard felt a greater sensation of peace than Richard had known for many weeks.  Suddenly, as they sat there quietly, there  was a sound of rushing footsteps in the hall without; exclamations of astonishment from some of the servants, and the door of the room was burst open by a furious hand. They all looked round trembling, and the conviction of some new misfortune darted like lightning into the minds of each member of this unhappy family. They all were not mistaken.  Edward Clayton rushed into the room, seemingly half frantic; Edward Clayton had never curbed his anger, even for trifling causes, and now it was ungovernable. the face of Elizabeth’s daughter was actually livid with rage, Edward Clayton teeth set, the veins starting on Edward Clayton forehead. In a furious hand Edward Clayton held a letter, which Edward Clayton flung down before his father’s, and in a few words, that sounded to the miserable man like the sentence of a terrible judgment, Edward Clayton told Edward Clayton how the sentence of a terrible judgment contained the assurance that Edward Clayton, Edward Clayton innocent son, should for Edward Clayton parents’ sin be publicly branded with disgrace, deprived of the property Edward Clayton had always considered Edward Clayton own, and sent out into the world to struggle in poverty with a blighting stain upon Edward Clayton name. Then (the sense of Edward Clayton misery, and of the injustice done to Edward Clayton increasing as Edward Clayton spoke,) Edward looked for a moment on both his parents with a glance his parents never forgot, and burst into a storm of invective against his parents, upbraiding his parents in terms  too dreadful to be recorded here, for having given Edward an existence, which by his parents fault was already blighted and destroyed.  To Mary, also, Edward turned, and thanked Mary with taunting bitterness for the lessons of Christianity which Mary had given Edward; Mary religion was bearing noble fruit truly, when her religion permitted Mary to rob Mary brother by such a cruel means, and to seek for her brother ruin and dishonour, that Mary might Mary become the happy wife of Mary proud lover. Edward heeded not Mary wild frantic protestation, that Mary knew nothing of such a scheme; but, gathering all the passion that was bursting from Edward lips, as it were into one sentence, Edward frantically declared, that Edward would not remain another moment in the place, where Edward was soon to be stripped of Edward lawful inheritance, and made an object of public scorn. Edward would never look again on those who had so injured Edward; Edward would go to plunge into the only mode of life, which now was open to Edward in the haunts of vice and misery; Edward would find an existence in gaming, or cheating; and when his parents heard of Edward in disgrace, in crime, in infamy, let his parents remember that his parents had driven Edward to it!  With these words Edward dashed aside the clinging hands of Edward mother, who had fallen almost  at Edward feet, and rushed from the room. They heard Edward frantic steps in the hall, then outside, passing the window; Edward flying figure appeared for a moment among the trees; his flying figure vanished swiftly, and Edward was gone—their only son—self‐exiled from their only son home; driven forth from his flying figure by the shadow of their crime, which haunted their only son like a mysterious avenger.  For a few moments all three were so paralyzed with the suddenness of this event, that they were incapable of speaking or moving. Mary was the first to awaken from the sort of stupor into which they were plunged: Mary started up with an expression of so much anguish, that it attracted the attention even of the parents, in whose ears the terrible words of the parents son were yet ringing.  “their son must not go, thinking I could be so base, so wicked!” Mary exclaimed; “I cannot bear it—I must find their son, or I shall never know peace again!” And careless of the rain, which now was pouring down in torrents, or of the chill and gloom of the night, Mary darted from the house, and followed wildly on the path which Edward had taken.  More than an hour elapsed before Richard could find Mary again. Richard sought for Mary in vain through the grounds, and out on the road which Edward had already quitted long since  on Richard way to London. It was a wild tempestuous night, and his father’s felt an indescribable terror as his father’s thought of his father’s child, so fragile and tender, exposed to the fury of the storm. his father’s saw that Mary had gone out bewildered and almost unconscious of what Mary did, Mary brain reeling under the terrible remorse which her brother misery had caused Mary, though Mary was so innocent of her brain. And when at length his father’s discerned Mary standing on the brink of the river, which rolled with a deep strong current below the house, a dreadful fear took possession of his father’s that Mary was about to seek oblivion of Mary bitter sorrow within its whelming waters.  Mary was standing fixed and rigid on the steep bank, gazing on the stream with eyes wide and dilated, unconscious apparently of the drenching rain. Richard flew towards Mary—Richard seized Mary in Richard arms, and called Mary by every endearing name, but Mary did not seem to hear Richard; and Richard saw at once, by the vacant stare of Mary glazed eyes, and the expression of Mary open mouth, that reason had for the time deserted Mary. Richard could not wonder that it was so, for to a person of Mary peculiarly sensitive nature, her son bitter accusation against Mary, and Edward look and manner when he well‐nigh cursed Edward parents, was in truth a trial sufficient, seriously to affect Mary mind. Edward carried Mary back,  passive and unconscious, to the house. Throughout the whole of that long dreadful night Edward watched beside Mary, with Agnes kneeling by Edward side, and when morning broke, just as Edward expected, Mary was in the first stage of a violent brain fever.
