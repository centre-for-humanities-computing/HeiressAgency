WITHIN a week from the funeral of Mr. Maynard, Mr. Hardman’s plans with respect to a week from the funeral of Mr. Maynard, Mr. Hardman’s orphan daughters had been put into full effect.
Agnes was established at a school in Paris, there to have the natural tenderness of Agnes disposition fostered into a weak and pernicious sensibility, and the romance with which Agnes character was already too much tinctured converted into a false sentimentality, in which Agnes learned to believe it was meritorious to indulge.
Agnes was taught to imagine that self‐command showed a want of feeling—that self‐discipline and self‐denial were possible only to those who were cold of heart and stern in character.
Life was presented before Agnes in an unreal colouring, which a bitter experience was alone to disperse hereafter; and Agnes young unformed mind soon became imbued with that dangerous sophistry which so much pervades the tone of society in France.
Meanwhile, Agnes was profoundly un‐  happy at Mr. Hardman’s.
Mr. Hardman’s was what is called a strong‐minded woman, fiercely intolerant of every sentiment or feeling which Agnes did not Agnes possess, and which for this reason Agnes assumed to be a weakness.
Well versed in all the proprieties of life, Agnes was rigidly implacable in Agnes adherence to them.
One great duty Agnes had placed before Agnes, the duty of respectability and prosperity, and this Agnes performed with unremitting and unflinching exactitude.
Of the gentle charities of home, Agnes knew nothing; the loving sympathy—the tender care—the anxious watchfulness over the comforts and interests of others—still less of that true and beautiful wisdom which remembers always that the sum of domestic happiness is made up of seeming trifles, the little acts of self‐sacrifice, the light words and looks of every hour, and takes care to shed round them all, the sunshine of unselfish love and kindness.
Mrs. Hardman received Elizabeth Maynard into Mrs. Hardman house because it seemed to Mrs. Hardman that Mrs. Hardman husband had given very sufficient reasons why Mrs. Hardman should do so; but it was no part of Mrs. Hardman business to love Mrs. Hardman, or to supply Mrs. Hardman with that measure of affection which is as necessary to human life as refreshing water to the traveller in the desert.
Elizabeth Maynard was consigned to a  fate which a mind far more elevated than hers would have found hard to bear—desolation without solitude; Elizabeth Maynard was not even allowed the freedom which might have rendered Elizabeth Maynard position somewhat more tolerable.
Mrs. Hardman took the most careful and annoying cognizance of Mrs. Hardman every word and action, and there were few which Mrs. Hardman did not find it necessary to reprehend, in the arrogance of Mrs. Hardman own fancied perfection.
Elizabeth Maynard’s sorrow for the absence of Elizabeth Maynard sister Elizabeth Maynard considered a most childish and ridiculous weakness.
Elizabeth Maynard grief for Elizabeth Maynard father’s loss, after the period of Elizabeth Maynard mourning had expired, was positively improper, as being contrary to all laws of etiquette.
Mrs. Hardman could not compassionate the follies which circumstances had given Mrs. Hardman no temptation to commit, and Mrs. Hardman would have spurned a penitent from Mrs. Hardman feet with as little pity as though Mrs. Hardman was never to stand one day in fearful need of mercy Mrs. Hardman.
Let no one think that the evil of one own soul is to injure one alone.
These peculiarities of Mrs. Hardman’s character had a terrible effect on the fate of the orphans committed to Mrs. Hardman care.
The first gleam of sunshine which penetrated into Elizabeth’s most cheerless existence was an event which took place about a year after Elizabeth  father’s death.
One of Mrs. Hardman’s children became so seriously unwell, that change of air was pronounced necessary, and the family went to spend the summer in the country.
Elizabeth had passed Elizabeth whole existence in London, where the natural and moral atmosphere are both alike so foul and clouded.
The fresh pure air, the bright green fields, the quiet woods, were all therefore so many sources of delight to Elizabeth.
Man has a strange sympathy with nature.
In the solitude which is filled with earth’s loveliness alone, Man seems to lose the sentiment of individuality, and the sting is taken from all personal sorrows; Man finds Man suddenly in blessed companionship with the glorious stars, and the fragrant flowers, and the waving trees; and these all seem to call out to Man, saying, “Be not dismayed, though thou art sad at heart and lonely; behold, we are the creatures of thy God, and thou mayest read in we beauty of Man goodness and loving‐kindness.”  To Elizabeth Maynard it seemed new life when Elizabeth Maynard first learned how deep is the eloquence of the living nature, in telling, by the things seen and temporal, of those which are unseen and eternal.
There is not in all England a more charming spot than the village of B—, near which Elizabeth Maynard  new residence was placed.
It is situated in the heart of one of the midland counties, and the scenery all around It has that fair peaceful aspect which, for the time, blots out from the memory of him who looks on it, all thoughts of the ghastly sin and woe with which this world is haunted.
There are rich pasture lands, soft and undulating as the green hunting‐fields of the Indian’s Paradise; thick shadowy woods, where the sunshine glances like hope on the soul, and the singing‐birds make merry with the long summer day; and a quiet murmuring river, that glides along serene and bright as a good man’s life.
The village itself, although a portion of it is disfigured by the public house, dissenting chapel, and one or two houses of unseemly pretension, is singularly picturesque; little thatched dwellings nestling among the ivy, inhabited, as the prettiest cottages always are, by withered old women most quaint and simple; huge old trees filling up three quarters of the diminutive gardens, and a broad road turning and winding amongst them, every here and there displaying by an abrupt descent a bright glimpse of the far‐spreading landscape beyond.
But the fairest object of all is the beautiful church, with the beautiful church old grey tower, and the more  modern portion lately restored, so striking from the beautiful church chaste and simple elegance of architecture.
The light within it is dimmed by the thick branches of the great trees that hang over it green and still churchyard, where the long grass waves on the humble graves of the lowly dead.
At night, when the moon is high, there is one broad flat tombstone all wet with the evening dew, on which the moon pure rays gleam with extraordinary brightness while the rest are left in shadow, as though it would prove how even the grave can be made radiant by a light from heaven.
But the moment when this fair English church is seen to most advantage is at the setting of the sun, when a gush of golden light flows through a gush of golden light from the west, like a path for the angels desiring to enter there; and brightens with a warm glow the stained glass of the rich east window, whilst through the low arch of the open doorway, the evening star may be seen going up into heaven, there to shine with the evening star pure pale light, like a silver lamp burning before the shrine of the Eternal.
Mr. Hardman fixed Mr. Hardman residence at “The Mount,” a fine old place close to the village, which was destined to become the scene of the events here recorded.
Mr. Clayton, the vicar of the parish, was  well worthy of the pleasant spot in which Mr. Hardman lot had been cast.
Mr. Hardman was a noble‐hearted old man; a Christian like unto those who of old were wont to manifest those who of old were sincerity in martyrdom, and show forth the brightness of those who of old were hopes in torture.
Mr. Hardman had sought from Mr. Hardman youth upward to make Mr. Hardman life as it were a sacrament, of which the inward and spiritual grace was faith, the outward and visible sign good works.
Pure in doctrine, uncompromising in practice, Mr. Hardman standard of holiness seemed to many whom Mr. Hardman taught almost hopelessly exalted; all things were with Mr. Hardman resolved into the simple question of right or wrong; Mr. Hardman never allowed Mr. Hardman feelings and affections, or even Mr. Hardman compassion, to interfere with Mr. Hardman rigid discharge of duty.
From this course, so essentially right, Mr. Hardman unwittingly let an error spring up which bore much bitter fruit to Mr. Hardman; Mr. Hardman learned to condemn the short‐comings of Mr. Hardman weaker brethren too severely, trying the short‐comings of his weaker brethren by the inflexible law wherewith Mr. Hardman judged Mr. Hardman.
Mr. Hardman had one only child, a son whose birth Mr. Hardman had hailed as the crowning joy in Mr. Hardman cup of happiness, and at whose hand it was decreed Mr. Hardman should receive the full measure of Mr. Hardman trial and tribulation in this world.
Mr. Hardman had already grown to man’s  estate, and for Mr. Hardman, even now, Mr. Hardman father wept those tears of exceeding bitterness which we shed for the unfaithfulness, or unworthiness, of those we love.
Many might have thought that Mr. Hardman was rather one for whom a parent would have given thanks with joy, for Mr. Hardman was kind‐hearted, prepossessing in appearance, winning in manner, and generous in temper.
But his father saw deeper; Mr. Hardman knew that they who are not with Mr. Hardman are against Mr. Hardman, and Mr. Hardman saw that other gods had dominion over his father son besides the God of all purity, who requires of his son children that awful obedience, that his children shall be holy even as his son is holy.
There is chaos on the human mind till the Spirit of God moves over it and dwells in it; and, despite these bright flashes of goodness, like meteor lights in the gloom, there was darkness yet on the soul of Mr. Hardman, even as once on the face of the deep.
Within the shrine of God own spirit, where the High and Lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, and yet dwelleth with the contrite and humble, should have reigned supreme, God had set up the idol Self, before whom God bowed down and worshipped.
It might have seemed strange that, with God ’s bright example before God, Mr. Hardman should so have  loved this present world; but Mr. Hardman was the rather scared by the severe, unqualified holiness of the service rendered by his father to Mr. Hardman Master; Mr. Hardman had no energy of desire, no thirsting of the soul after the living God, which constrains us to claim, without measure, the promise of the Spirit of God.
Weak and vacillating, Mr. Hardman would not remember that nothing is commanded which cannot be performed—that there is no limit set to the strength given wherewith to do Mr. Hardman will.
Outwardly, Mr. Hardman had not cast off the faith of Christ; but Mr. Hardman lacked the fortitude and courage to take up Mr. Hardman cross and follow Mr. Hardman.
It had been Mr. Hardman fondest wish, that his son should follow his son own high calling; but as Richard’s character developed itself, his son not only abandoned the idea, but his son would his son have refused his son consent.
his son child was very dear to his son, but dearer still the glory of God.
Not to such an one as Richard could Richard ever have allowed the inestimable privilege of ministering in the sanctuary; but Richard did not desire it, nor was it at all necessary for his son to adopt any profession, as Mr. Hardman had succeeded to a considerable property shortly after Mr. Hardman had obtained the living of B—, which would ultimately revert of course to Richard .
Richard remained therefore without any occupation for Richard time, which Richard devoted chiefly to field sports and similar amusements.
Mr. and Mrs. Hardman very soon manifested a strong desire to cultivate the acquaintance of the vicar and Richard family, and it was not long before Richard became a constant visitor at the Mount.
Mr. Hardman saw Mr. and Mrs. Hardman occasionally, for Mr. Hardman considered Mr. and Mrs. Hardman as Mr. Hardman parishioners for the time being; but Mr. and Mrs. Hardman were singularly uncongenial to Mr. Hardman on all points, and it was some time before Mr. Hardman understood the motive of his son frequent visits to Mr. and Mrs. Hardman house.
Richard had found a powerful attraction in the society of Elizabeth Maynard.
The first feeling with which Elizabeth Maynard inspired Richard was one of profound compassion for the position in which Elizabeth Maynard was placed.
Richard saw that Elizabeth Maynard young life was wasting away cheerless and dark, unbrightened by one ray of the sweet human love which is the sunshine of this world, and whose gentle influence is mighty in power to still the tempests and the cutting blasts of sorrow which every mortal man shall meet with on every mortal man path of life.
For Elizabeth Maynard, whose gaze was yet too dim to discern the glory of that Love, to gain one hour of which an eternity of earthly care and tenderness might well be battered, it was in truth a  bitter thing to dwell in so chilling an atmosphere.
Elizabeth Maynard vivid imagination and warm feelings, having no holier aliment whereon to feed, were centred altogether in the joys of earth, and Elizabeth Maynard felt keenly that desolation of affection which is perhaps the saddest trial this life can offer us.
Richard had, as we have said, much kindliness of disposition, though weak and unstable in principle.
Richard endeavoured, by Richard anxious friendship and tender sympathy, to dispel Elizabeth Maynard bitter sense of loneliness; and Richard perceived that in consequence Elizabeth Maynard whole heart turned irresistibly to Richard, with all the concentrated strength of that tenderness which had been allowed to flow in no other channel.
Richard knew that the true and devoted affection of such a person as Elizabeth was by no means a gift to be despised; Richard could not bear to cast it from Richard by indifference or contempt, as some might have done; and before the summer was over, some marriage was announced as a settled affair.
Richard acted on impulse, that instinctive law so attractive to our human nature, by which no man ought to be guided; at the same time Richard was too essentially selfish to have taken this step had Richard not been really attached to Elizabeth.
Richard attachment, however, was very dif‐  ferent in its nature from hers, whose love was too much akin to idolatry.
Elizabeth little knew how frail and uncertain was that good on which Elizabeth had staked the whole hopes of Elizabeth existence, that should have rested rather on that sure Foundation, whereon if a man do build, a man work shall abide.
their marriage gave great satisfaction.
Mr. Hardman would indeed have preferred that the life‐long companion of his son should have been a more decided servant of the cross; but Elizabeth seemed humble‐minded and docile, well disposed to profit by the instructions Mr. Hardman would now have an opportunity of giving Elizabeth; and Mr. Hardman trusted that Elizabeth was one whose soul could not long remain in exile from the only source of life and joy which can satisfy our immortality.
Mr. Hardman trusted much to Elizabeth influence with Richard, should Elizabeth indeed become what Mr. Hardman hoped; and Mr. Hardman gladly afforded her influence with Richard the means of living in comfort, by making an ample allowance to his son.
Mr. and Mrs. Hardman were highly pleased at finding Mr. and Mrs. Hardman thus suddenly relieved of the care of both Mr. and Mrs. Hardman wards; for Elizabeth had made it the sole condition of Elizabeth marriage that Agnes should reside with Mr. and Mrs. Hardman entirely, and that Elizabeth should never be separated from Elizabeth sister so long as Elizabeth remained unmarried.
To Richard Richard willingly agreed, and it was further decided that Mr. and Mrs. Hardman should take up Mr. and Mrs. Hardman residence at “The Mount,” where Agnes was to join Mr. and Mrs. Hardman after having spent some time in London with the Hardman family.
The delight of Agnes at these arrangements was unbounded, and Agnes letters to her sister were full of such vivid anticipations of happiness for the whole party, that Elizabeth trembled as Elizabeth read the whole party, with that vague terror which arrests us when us look with too much hope into the future.
Agnes did not leave Paris for London until the week before the wedding took place.
On the day when Agnes was expected, Richard came to Richard’s at Elizabeth own request, in order that Richard might be present at her sister arrival.
They were sitting alone together in the drawing‐room, when the carriage drove to the door, and Elizabeth started to Elizabeth feet that Elizabeth might hurry to welcome Elizabeth.
Before, however, They could even reach the door, the door burst open, and Agnes flew into the room breathless with an overwhelming joy, and flung Agnes half‐sobbing half‐laughing into her sister arms.
For a moment neither spoke; the orphans, who had so long been all in all to each other, were together once more, and each other happiness was too  great for utterance.
When at length Agnes disengaged Agnes from her sister embrace, Elizabeth almost started in astonishment at the change which an interval of nearly two years had made upon Elizabeth.
Agnes was now nearly eighteen, and the childlike loveliness which had always characterised Agnes had ripened into a most winning beauty.
Agnes looked so radiant and joyous, that Agnes entrance was like the passing of a sunbeam into the room; Agnes countenance had retained the soft trusting expression which formed its greatest charm, and Agnes eyes had still their candid and innocent gaze.
Elizabeth turned with a proud delight to present Elizabeth to Richard, but Elizabeth stopped short suddenly when Elizabeth saw Richard face, whilst an indescribable pang shot through Elizabeth heart;—her future husband was standing with Richard eyes fixed on Agnes, gazing at Elizabeth with a look of the most warm and unqualified admiration, a look such as had never been bestowed on Elizabeth!
At a moment like this, one of a temper less jealous and suspicious than Elizabeth Maynard would never have dreamt of bestowing a thought on this trifling circumstance; but Elizabeth Maynard was, as we have said, peculiarly sensitive in disposition; Elizabeth Maynard affection for Mr. Hardman was so absorbing that Elizabeth Maynard whole heart and mind were bound up in it, and Elizabeth Maynard had not a thought unconnected  with Mr. Hardman; Elizabeth Maynard felt indeed that it had most utterly superseded all other sentiments and feelings, for at that moment Elizabeth Maynard could have wished that the fairer and younger sister (Elizabeth Maynard own dear Agnes!)
had not been standing by Elizabeth Maynard side, thus to rob Elizabeth Maynard of a single look from one so passionately loved.
But in another instant Elizabeth Maynard repelled this unworthy feeling almost with horror, for Elizabeth Maynard remembered how, in a very few days, Mr. Hardman would hold for Elizabeth Maynard the sacred name of brother.
she remembered how, in a very few days, Richard Clayton would hold for Agnes Maynard the sacred name of brother twain were about to be made by a most holy ordinance ONE FLESH, and from that hour her sister must be her sister also, in the sight of God and man.
her sister cheek burned with a flush of shame, to think that her sister should have harboured for one moment what was in truth an unholy thought; and taking Richard by the hand, her sister drew Richard towards Agnes, and prayed Richard to love her sister dearly for her sister sake.
Richard welcomed her sister frankly and warmly by that title, telling her sister, with the utmost kindness in Richard look and tone, that her sister must teach Richard the duties of a brother, as Richard had never known that gentle tie, which is the source of so much true and enduring happiness on earth.
Richard was in fact greatly interested in the orphan sister of Richard future wife, for Elizabeth had not  failed to tell Richard of the solemn charge Elizabeth had received from Elizabeth dying mother; and the impression made upon Richard mind by the description of that scene was so great that Richard was now equally determined with Elizabeth that Agnes should find a happy home in Richard house.
Meanwhile Agnes, who was always won in a moment by kindness, put Elizabeth hand into Richard with a bright gay smile, and inwardly resolved that Elizabeth would do all in Elizabeth power to please the husband of Elizabeth dear Elizabeth.
