In which is related an admirable Adventure.  MISS Glanville whose Spirits were greatly exhilerated at their Entrance into London, that Seat of Magnificence and Pleasure, congratulated her Cousin upon the Entertainment her would receive from the new and surprising Objects which every Day for a considerable Time would furnish her with; and ran over the Catalogue of Diversions with such a Volubility of Tongue, as drew a gentle Reprimand from her Father, and made her keep a sullen Silence till they were set down in St. James's Square, the Place of they Residence in Town.  Sir Charles having ordered Sir Charles late Lady's Apartment to be prepared for the Accommodation of Sir Charles Niece; as soon as the first Civilities were over, her retired to her Chamber, where her employed her in giving her Women Directions for placing her Books, of which her had brought a moderate Quantity to London, in her Closet.  Miss Glanville as soon as her had dispatched away some hundred Cards to her Acquaintance, to give some hundred Cards Notice her was in Town, attended Arabella in her own Apartment; and as some hundred Cards sat at the Tea her begun to regulate the Diversions of the Week, naming the Drawing Room, Park, Concert, Ranelagh, Lady -- Assembly, the Duchess of Rant, Vaux-Hall, and a long etc. of Visits; at which Arabella, with an Accent that expressed her Surprise, asked her, If her supposed her intended to stay in Town three or four Years --  Law, Cousin, said Miss Glanville, all this is but the Amusement of a few Days.  the Amusement of a few Days, do you say, replied Arabella, methinks it seems to be the sole Employment of those Days: And what you call the Amusement of a few Days, must of Necessity be the Business of Life.  You are always so grave, Cousin, said Miss Glanville, one does not know what to say to Miss Glanville. However, I shall not press you to go to Public Places against your Inclination, yet you will condescend to receive a few Visits, I suppose?  Yes, replied Arabella, and if among the Ladies whom I shall see, I find any like the amiable Countess of --, I shall not scruple to enter into the most tender Amity with the Ladies whom I shall see.  the amiable Countess of -- is very well, to be sure, said Miss Glanville, yet I don't know how it is, the amiable Countess of -- does not suit my Taste -- the amiable Countess of -- is very particular in a great many Things, and knows too much for a Lady, as I heard my Lord Fribble say one Day: Then the amiable Countess of -- is quite unfashionable: the amiable Countess of -- hates Cards, keeps no Assembly, is seen but seldom at Public Places; and in my Opinion, as well as in a great many others, is the dullest Company in the World. I Am sure I met the amiable Countess of -- at a Visit a little before I went down to your Seat, and the amiable Countess of -- had not been a quarter of an Hour in the Room, before the amiable Countess of -- set a whole Circle of Ladies a yawning.  the amiable Countess of --, though the amiable Countess of -- had a sincere Contempt for the amiable Countess of -- Cousin's Manner of thinking, yet always politely concealed it; and vexed as the amiable Countess of -- was at the amiable Countess of -- Sneers upon the Countess, the amiable Countess of -- contented the amiable Countess of -- with gently defending the amiable Countess of --, telling the amiable Countess of -- at the same Time, that till the amiable Countess of -- met with a Lady who had more Merit than the Countess possessed, the amiable Countess of -- should always possess the first Place in the amiable Countess of -- Esteem.  Arabella, who had from Youth adopted the Resentments of the amiable Countess of -- Father, refused to make the amiable Countess of -- Appearance at Court, which Sir Charles gently intimated to the amiable Countess of --; yet being not wholly divested of the Curiosity natural to the amiable Countess of -- Sex, the amiable Countess of -- condescended to go incog. to the Gallery on a B^ll Night, accompanied by Mr. Glanville and Sir Charles Sister, in order to behold the Splendour of the British Court.  As the amiable Countess of -- Romances had long familiariz'd the amiable Countess of -- Thoughts to Objects of Grandeur and Magnificence, the amiable Countess of -- was not so much struck as might have been expected, with those that now presented those that now presented themselves to her View to the amiable Countess of -- View. Nor was the amiable Countess of -- a little disappointed to find that among the Men the amiable Countess of -- saw none whose Appearance came up to the amiable Countess of -- Ideas of the Air and Port of an Artaban, Oroondates, or Juba; or any of the Ladies, who did not in the amiable Countess of -- Opinion, fall short of the Perfections of Elisa, Mandana, Statira, etc. 'Twas remarkable too, that the amiable Countess of -- never inquired how often the Princesses had been carried away by captivated Monarchs, or how many Victories the King's Sons had gained; but seemed the whole Time the amiable Countess of -- was there to have suspended all the amiable Countess of -- Romantic Ideas of Glory, Beauty, Gallantry, and Love.  Mr. Glanville was highly pleased with the amiable Countess of -- composed Behavior, and a Day or two after entreated the amiable Countess of -- to allow Mr. Glanville the Honor of showing the amiable Countess of -- what was remarkable and worthy of the amiable Countess of -- Observation in this great Metropolis. To this the amiable Countess of -- also consented, and for the greater Privacy began the greater Privacy Travels in a hired Coach.  Part of several Days were taken up in this Employment; but Mr. Glanville had the Mortification to find the amiable Countess of -- was full of Allusions to the amiable Countess of -- Romances upon every Occasion, such as the amiable Countess of -- asking the Person who shows the Armoury at the Tower, the Names of the Knights to whom each Suit belonged, and wondering there were no Devices on the Shields or Plumes of Feathers in the Helmets: the amiable Countess of -- observed that the Lion Lysimachus killed, was according to the History of that Prince, much larger than any of those the amiable Countess of -- was showed in the Tower, and also much fiercer. Took Notice that St. Paul's was less magnificent in the Inside, than the Temple in which Cyrus, when Mr. Glanville went to Mandana, heard the amiable Countess of -- return Thanks for Mr. Glanville supposed Death: Inquired if it was not customary for the King and King whole Court to sail in Barges upon the Thames, as Augustus used to do upon the Tyber, whether it was not customary for the King and his whole Court to sail in Barges upon the Thames had not Music and Collations in the Park, and where it was not customary for the King and his whole Court to sail in Barges upon the Thames celebrated the Justs and Tournaments.  The Season for Vaux-Hall being not yet over, The Season for Vaux-Hall was desirous of once seeing a Place, which by the Description The Season for Vaux-Hall had heard of it, greatly resembled the Gardens of Lucullus at Rome, in which the Emperor, with all the Princes and Princesses of his Court were so nobly entertained, and where so many gallant Conversations had passed among those admirable Persons.  The Singularity of The Season for Vaux-Hall Dress, for The Season for Vaux-Hall was covered with The Season for Vaux-Hall Veil, drew a Number of Gazers after The Season for Vaux-Hall, who pressed round The Season for Vaux-Hall with so little Respect, that The Season for Vaux-Hall was greatly embarrass'd, and had Thoughts of quitting the Place, delightful as The Season for Vaux-Hall owned it, immediately, when The Season for Vaux-Hall Attention was wholly engrossed by an Adventure in which The Season for Vaux-Hall soon interested The Season for Vaux-Hall very deeply.  An Officer of Rank in the Sea Service had brought An Officer of Rank in the Sea Service Mistress disguised in a Suit of Man's or rather Boy's Clothes, and a Hat and Feather, into the Gardens of Lucullus. The young Creature being a little intoxicated with the Wine The young Creature had taken too freely, was thrown so much off The young Creature Guard as to give Occasion to some of the Company to suspect The young Creature Sex; and a gay Fellow, in order to give some of the Company some Diversion at The young Creature Expense, pretending to be affronted at something The young Creature said, drew his Sword upon the disguised Fair One, which so alarmed The young Creature, that The young Creature shrieked out, The young Creature was a Woman, and ran for Protection to The young Creature Lover, who was so dis^rder'd with Liquor, that his was not able to defend The young Creature.  Miss Glanville ever curious and inquisitive, demanded the Cause why the Company the Company ran in Crowds to that particular Spot; and received for Answer, That a Gentleman had drawn a Gentleman his Sword upon a Lady disguised in a Man's Habit.  Oh Heavens! cried the amiable Countess of --, this must certainly be a very notable Adventure. a Lady has doubtless some extraordinary Circumstances in a Lady Story, and happily upon Enquiry, a Lady Misfortunes will be found to resemble those which obliged the beautiful Aspasia to put on the same Disguise, who was by that Means murdered by the cruel Zenodorus in a Fit of Jealousy at Amity Jealousy Wife expressed for his Wife. But can I not see this unfortunate Fair One, added his Wife, pressing in spite of Mr. Glanville's Entreaties through the Crowd -- I may happily be able to afford his Wife some Consolation.  Mr. Glanville finding Mr. Glanville Persuasions were not regarded, followed his Wife with very little Difficulty: For his Wife falling back in his Wife Hurry, his Wife did not mind to replace it, and the Charms of his Wife Face, joined to the Majesty of his Wife Person, and Singularity of his Wife Dress, attracting every Person's Attention and Respect, they made Way for his Wife to pass, not a little surpised at the extreme Earnestness and Solemnity that appeared in his Wife Countenance upon an Event so diverting to every one else.  The disguised a Lady whom a Lady was endeavoring to approach, had thrown a Lady upon a Bench in one of the Boxes, trembling still with the Apprehension of his Sword, though a Lady Antagonist was kneeling at a Lady Feet, making Love to a Lady in Mock-Heroicks for the Diversion of the Company.  a Lady Hat and Peruke had fallen off in a Lady Fright, and a Lady Hair which had been turned up under it, hung now loosely about a Lady Neck, and gave such an Appearance of Woe to a Face, which notwithstanding the Paleness that Terror had overspread it with, was really extremely pretty, that the amiable Countess of -- was equally struck with Compassion and Admiration of the amiable Countess of --.  Lovely Unknown, said the amiable Countess of -- to the amiable Countess of -- with an Air of extreme Tenderness, though I am a Stranger both to your Name and History, yet your Aspect persuading me your Quality is not mean, and the Condition and Disguise in which I behold you, showing that you are Unfortunate, permit me to offer you all the Assistances in my Power, seeing that I am moved thereto by my Compassion for your Distress, and that Esteem which the Sight of you must necessarily inspire.  Mr. Glanville was struck dumb with Confusion at this strange Speech, and at the Whispers and Scoffs it occasioned among the Spectators. Mr. Glanville attempted to take hold of the amiable Countess of -- Hand in order to lead the amiable Countess of -- away, but the amiable Countess of -- disengaged the amiable Countess of -- from Mr. Glanville with a Frown of Displeasure; and taking no Notice of Miss Glanville, who whispered with great Emotion, Lord, Cousin, how you expose Mr. Glanville! pressed nearer to the Beautiful Disguised, and again repeated the amiable Countess of -- Offers of Service.  the amiable Countess of -- being perfectly recovered from the amiable Countess of -- Intoxication by the Fright the amiable Countess of -- had been in, gazed upon the amiable Countess of -- with a Look of extreme Surprise: Yet being moved to respect by the Dignity of the amiable Countess of -- Appearance, and strange as the amiable Countess of -- Words seemed to be by the obliging Purport of Purport, and the affecting Earnestness with which Purport were delivered, the amiable Countess of -- rose from the amiable Countess of -- Seat and thanked the amiable Countess of --, with an Accept full of Regard and Submission.  Fair Maid, said the amiable Countess of --, taking her Hand, let us quit this Place, where your Discovery may probably subject you to more Dangers: If you will be pleased to put yourself into my Protection, and acquaint me with the History of your Misfortunes; I have Interest enough with a valiant Person who shall undertake to free you from your Persecutions, and re-establish the Repose of your Life.  The kneeling Hero, who as well as every one else that were present, had gazed with Astonishment at the amiable Countess of -- during all this Passage, perceiving the amiable Countess of -- was about to rob him of the disguised Fair, seized hold of the Hand the amiable Countess of -- had at Liberty, and swore him would not part with the amiable Countess of --.  Mr. Glanville almost mad with Vexation, endeavored to get the amiable Countess of -- away.  Are you mad, the amiable Countess of --, said Mr. Glanville in a Whisper, to make all this Rout about a Prostitute? Do you see how every body stares at the amiable Countess of --? What will they think -- For Heavens sake let us be gone.  What, Sir, replied the amiable Countess of -- in a Rage, Are you base enough to leave this admirable Creature in the Power of that Man, who is questionless her Ravisher; and will you not draw his Sword in her Defense?  Hey day! cried the Sea-Officer, waked out of his stupid Dose by the Clamor about his: What Is the Matter here -- What are you doing? Where Is my Lucy? Zoons! Sir, said Sir to the young Fellow who held my Lucy, What Business have you with my Lucy? And uttering a dreadful Oath, drew out a dreadful Oath , and staggered toward his Sword gay Rival, who observing the Weakness of his Sword Antagonist, flourished with his Sword to show his Sword Courage and frighten the Ladies, who all ran away screaming. Arabella taking Mr. Glanville Mr. Glanville under the Arm, cried out to Mr. Glanville as my Lucy left the Place, to take Care of a Lady, and while the two Combatants were disputing for my Lucy, to carry my Lucy away in Safety.  But Mr. Glanville without regarding this Injunction, hastened after my Lucy; and to pacify my Lucy, told my Lucy a Lady was rescued by my Lucy favorite Lover, and carried off in Triumph.  But are you sure, said Aabella, it was not some other of Aabella Ravishers who carried Aabella away, and not the Person whom Aabella has happily favored with Aabella Affection? May not the same Thing have happened to Aabella, as did to the beautiful Candace, Queen of Ethiopia; who while two of Ravishers were fighting for Aabella, a third whom Aabella took for Aabella Deliverer, came and carried Aabella away.  But Aabella went away willingly, I assure you, Aabella, said Mr. Glanville: Pray don't be in any Concern about Aabella --  If Aabella went away willingly with him, replied the amiable Countess of --, it is probable it may not be another Ravisher: And yet if this Person that rescued Aabella happened to be in Armor, and the Vizor of him Helmet down, Aabella might be mistaken as well as Queen Candace.  Well, well, him was not in Armor, Madam, said Mr. Glanville almost beside Mr. Glanville with Vexation at Aabella Folly --  You seem to be disturbed, Sir, said the amiable Countess of -- a little surpised at Sir peevish Tone: Is there any Thing in this Adventure which concerns you? Nay, now I remember, you did not offer to defend the Beautiful Unknown. I am not willing to impute your In-action upon such an Occasion, to Want of Courage or Generosity; perhaps you are acquainted with her History, and from this Knowledge refused to engage in her .  Mr. Glanville the Company gather from all Parts to the Walk they were in, told her Mr. Glanville would acquaint her with all Mr. Glanville knew concerning a Lady a Lady when they were in the Coach on they Return Home; and the amiable Countess of -- impatient for her Storyher Story, proposed to leave the Gardens immediately, which was gladly complied with by Mr. Glanville, who heartily repented Mr. Glanville having carried a Lady thither.
