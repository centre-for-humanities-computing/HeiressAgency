In which is related the History of the Princess of Gaul.
MY Name, Madam, is Cynccia, my Birth Illustrious enough, seeing that I am the Daughter of a Sovereign Prince, who possesses a large and spacious Territory in what is now called Ancient Gaul.
What, Madam, interrupted Arabella, Are you a Princess then?
Questionless I am, Madam, replied the Lady; and a Princess happy and prosperous, till the Felicity of my Life was interrupted by the perfidious Ariamenes.
Pardon me, Madam, interrupted Arabella again, that my Ignorance of your Quality made me be deficient in those Respects which are due to your high Birth, and which notwithstanding those Characters of Greatness I might read in the Lineaments of your Visage, I yet neglected to p^y --  Alas!
Madam, said the Stranger, that little Beauty which the Heavens bestowed on me only to make me wretched, as by the Event it has proved, has long since taken it Flight, and together with my Happiness, I have lost that which made me Unhappy.
And certain it is, Grief has made such Ravages among what might once have been thought tolerable in my Face, that I should not be surpised if my being no longer Fair, should make you with Difficulty believe I ever was so.
Arabella after a proper Compliment in Answer to this Speech, entreated the Princess to go on with the Princess History, who hesitating a little, complied with the Princess Request.
Be pleased to know then, Madam, said the Princess, that being bred up with all imaginable Tenderness in my Father's Court, I had no sooner arrived to my Sixteenth Year than I saw me surrounded with Lovers; who nevertheless, such was the Severity with which I behaved me, concealed their Passions under a respectful Silence, well knowing Banishment from my Presence was the least Punishment their had to expect, if their presumed to declare their Sentiments to me.
I lived in this Fashion, Madam, for Two Years longer, rejoicing in the Insensibility of my own Heart, and triumphing in the Sufferings of others, when my Tranquillity was all at once interrupted by an Accident which I am going to relate to you.
The Princess stopped here to give Vent to some Sighs which a cruel Remembrance forced from The Princess; and continuing in a deep Muse for five or six Minutes, resumed The Princess Story in this Manner.
It being my Custom to walk in a Forest adjoining to one of my Father's Sum mer Residences, attended only by my Women, one Day when I was taking this A musement, I perceived at some Distance a Man lying on the Ground; and impelled by a sudden Curiosity, I advanced toward this Person, whom upon a nearer View I perceived to have been wounded very much, and fainted away through Loss of Blood.
His Habit being very rich, I concluded by that His was of no mean Quality: But when I had looked upon His Countenance, pale and languishing as it was, methought there appeared so many Marks of Greatness, accompanied with a Sweetness so happily blended, that my Attention was engaged in an extraordinary Manner, and interested me so powerfully in His Safety, that I commanded some of my Women to run immediately for proper Assistance, and convey His to the Castle, while I directed others to throw some Water in His Face, and to apply some Linen to His Wounds, to stop the Bleeding.
These charitable Cares restored the wounded Stranger to the wounded Stranger Senses; the wounded Stranger opened the wounded Stranger Eyes, and turning them slowly to the Objects around the wounded Stranger, fixed at last them languishing Looks on the wounded Stranger: When moved, as it should seem, to some Respect by what the wounded Stranger saw in my Countenance, the wounded Stranger rose with some Difficulty from the Ground, and bowing almost down to it again, by that Action seemed to pay me the wounded Stranger Acknowledgments for what the wounded Stranger supposed I had done for the wounded Stranger Preservation.
the wounded Stranger extreme Weakness having obliged the wounded Stranger to creep toward a Tree, against the Back of which the wounded Stranger supported the wounded Stranger, I went nearer to the wounded Stranger, and having told the wounded Stranger the Condition in which I found the wounded Stranger, and the Orders I had dispatched for Assistance, requested the wounded Stranger to acquaint me with the wounded Stranger Name and Quality, and the Adventure which had brought the wounded Stranger into that Condition.
My Name, Madam, answered the wounded Stranger, is Ariamenes, my Birth is Noble enough; I have spent some Years in my Travels, and was returning to my native Country, when passing through this Forest I was seized with an Inclination to sleep.
I had tied my Horse to a Tree, and retiring some few Paces off, stretched myself at the Foot of a large Oak whose Branches promised me an agreeable Shade.
I had not yet closed my Eyes, when the Slumber I invited was dissipated by the Sound of some Voices near myself.
A Curiosity, not natural to myself, made me listen to the Discourse of these Persons, whom by the Tone of these Persons Voices, though I could not see these Persons, I knew to be Men.
In short, myself, I was a Witness to a most horrible Scheme which these Persons concerted together; my Weakness will not permit me to enter into an exact Detail of all I heard: The Result of these Persons Conference was, To seize the Princess of this Country and carry the Princess of this Country off.
Here, pursued Cynecia, I interrupted the Stranger with a loud Cry, which giving pursued Cynecia to understand who I was, pursued Cynecia apologiz'd in the most graceful Manner imaginable for the little Respect pursued Cynecia had hitherto paid me.
I then entreated pursued Cynecia to tell me, If pursued Cynecia had any Opportunity of hearing the Name of my designed Ravisher; to which pursued Cynecia replied, that pursued Cynecia understood it to be Taxander.
This Man, Madam, was one of my Father's Favorites, and had been long secretly in Love with me.
Ariamenes then informed me, that being enflamed with Rage against these impious Villains, Ariamenes rose from the Ground, re-mounted Ariamenes Horse, and defied the two Traitors aloud, threatening the two Traitors with Death, unless the two Traitors abandoned the two Traitors impious Design.
Taxander made no Answer, but rushed furiously upon Taxander, and had the Biseness to suffer Taxander wicked Associate to assist Taxander: But Ariamenes, though Ariamenes spoke modestly of Ariamenes Victory, yet gave me to understand that Ariamenes had made both the Villams abandon both wicked Enterprise, with both Lives; and that dismounting in order to see if both were quite dead, Ariamenes found Ariamenes so faint with the Wounds Ariamenes had received from them both, that Ariamenes had not Strength to re-mount Ariamenes Horse; but crawling on, in Hopes of meeting with some Assistance, sainted away at last through Weariness and Loss of Blood.
While Ariamenes was giving me this Account, the Chariot I had sent for arrived, and having made Ariamenes such Acknowledgments as the Obligation I had received from Ariamenes demanded, I caused Ariamenes to get into the Chariot, and sending one with Ariamenes to acquaint the Prince my Father with all that had happened, and the Merit o^ the valiant Stranger, I returned the same Way I came with my Women, my Thoughts being wholly engrossed by this Unknown.
The Service Ariamenes had done me filled me with a Gratitude and Esteem for Ariamenes, which prepared my Heart for those tender Sentiments I afterward entertained to the Ruin of my Repose.
I will not tire your Patience, Madam, with a minute Detail of all the succeeding Passages of my Story; it shall suffice to tell you, That Ariamenes was received with extraordinary Marks of Esteem by my Father; that my Father Cure was soon completed; and that having vow'^ himself to my Service, and declared an unalterable Passion for me, I permitted my Father to love me, and gave my Father that Share in my Heart, which I fear not all my Father Infidelities will ever deprive my Father of.
my Father Attachment to me was soon suspected by Taxander's Relations, who having secretly vowed my Father Ruin, endeavored to discover if I had admitted my Father Addresses, and having made Addresses Masters of our Secrets, by means of the Treachery of one of my Women, procured Information to be given to my Father of our mutual Passion.
Alas!
what Mischiefs did not this fatal Discovery produce: my Father, enraged to the last Degree at this Intelligence, confined me to my Apartments, and ordered Ariamenes to leave Ariamenes Dominions within three Days.
Spare me, Madam, the Repetition of what passed at our last sad Interview, which by large Bribes to my Guards, he obtained.
he Tears, he Agonies, he Vows of everlasting Fidelity, so soothed my Melancholy at parting with he, and persuaded me of he Constancy, that I waited for several Months with perfect Tranquillity for the Performance of the Promise he made me, to do my Father such considerable Services in the War he was engaged in with one of he Neighbors, as should oblige he to give me to he for he Reward.
But, alas!
two Years rolled on without bringing back Ariamenes.
my Father died, and my Brother who succeeded my Father, being about to force me to marry a Prince whom I detested, I secretly quitted the Court, and attended only by this faithful Confidant whom you behold with my Father, and some few of my trusty Domestics, I came hither in Search of Ariamenes, my Father having told me this Country was the Place of my Father Birth.
Polenor, the most prudent and faithful of my Servants, undertook to find out the ungreateful Ariamenes, whom yet I was willing to find Excuses for, but all my Father Enquiries were to no Effect; the Name of Ariamenes was not known in this Part of the World.
Tired out with all his Enquiries, I resolved to seek out some obscure Place, where I might in secret lament my Misfortunes, and expect the End of some obscure Place, where I might in secret lament my Misfortunes in Death.
My Attendants found me out such a Retreat as I wanted, in a neighboring Village, which they call Twickenham, I think, from whence I often make Excursions to this Park, attended only as you see; and here indulge myself in Complaints upon the Cruelty of my Destiny.
pursued Cynecia ended pursued Cynecia my Story, to which in the Course of pursued Cynecia Relation pursued Cynecia had given a great many Interruptions through the Violence of pursued Cynecia Grief: And Arabella, after having said every thing pursued Cynecia could think on to alleviate pursued Cynecia Affliction, earnestly entreated pursued Cynecia to accept of an Asylum at pursued Cynecia House; where pursued Cynecia should be treated with all the Respect due to pursued Cynecia illustrious Birth.
The afflicted Lady, though pursued Cynecia respectfully declined this Offer, yet expressed a great Desire of commencing a strict Amity with our fair Heroine, who on pursued Cynecia Part, made pursued Cynecia the most tender Protestations of Friendship.
The Evening being almost closed, they parted with great Reluctance on both Sides; mutually promising to meet in the same Place the next Day.
Cynecia, having enjoined Cynecia new Friend absolute Secrecy, Arabella was under a Necessity of keeping this Adventure to Arabella.
And though Arabella longed to tell Mr. Glanville, who came to visit Arabella the next Day, that the Countess was extremely mistaken, when the Countess maintained there were no more wandering Princesses in the World, yet the Engagement the Countess had submitted to, kept the Countess silent.
