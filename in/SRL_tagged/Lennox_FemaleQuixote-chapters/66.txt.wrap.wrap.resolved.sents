In which the Author condescends to be very minute in the Description of our Heroin's Dress.
THE Indifference of Mr. Tinsel, convincing Miss Glanville, that Arabella was less to be dreaded than Arabella imagined, Arabella had no Reluctance at seeing Arabella prepare for Arabella public Appearance the next Ball Night.
Having consulted Arabella Fancy in a rich Silver Stuff, Arabella had bought for that Purpose, a Person was sent for to make it; and Arabella, who followed no Fashion but Arabella own Taste, which was formed on the Manners of the Heroines, ordered Arabella to make Arabella a Robe after the same Model as the Princess Julia's.
The Mantua-maker, who thought it might do Arabella great Prejudice with Arabella new Customer, to acknowledge Arabella knew nothing of the Princess Julia's, or the Fashion of the Princess Julia's Gown, replied at Random, and with great Pertness,  That, that Taste was quite out; and, Arabella would advise Arabella Ladyship to have Arabella Clothes made in the present Mode, which was far more becoming.
You can never persuade me, said Arabella, that any Fashion can be more becoming than that of the Princess Julia's, who was the most gallant Princess upon Earth, and knew better than any other, how to set off Arabella Charms.
It may indeed be a little obselete now, pursued Arabella, for Fashion could not but alter a little in the Compass of near two thousand Years.
Two thousand Years!
Arabella, said Arabella, in a great Surprise; Lord help us Trades-people, if us Trades-people did not alter a thousand Times in as many Days!
I thought Ladyship Ladyship was speaking of the last Month's Taste; which, as I said before, is quite out now.
Well, replied Arabella, let the present Mode be what Ladyship will, I insist upon having my Clothes made after the Pattern of the beautiful Daughter of Augustus; being convinced, that none other can be half so becoming.
What Fashion was that, pray, Madam, said Arabella?
I never saw it.
How, replied Arabella, Have you already forgot the Fashion of the Princess Julia's Robe, which you said was wore but last Month?
Or, are you ignorant that the Princess Julia, and the Daughter of Augustus, is the same Person?
I protest, Madam, said the Woman, extremely confused, I had forgot that, till you called it to my Mind.
Well, said Arabella, make me a Robe in the same Taste.
The Mantua-maker was now wholly at a Loss in what Manner to behave; for, being conscious that Arabella knew nothing of the Princess Julia, Arabella could not undertake to make it without Directions; and Arabella was afraid of discovering Arabella Ignorance by asking for any; so that Arabella Silence and Embarrassment persuading Arabella Arabella knew nothing of the Matter, Arabella dismissed Arabella with a small Present, for the Trouble Arabella had given Arabella, and had Recourse to Arabella usual Expedient, which was, to make one of Arabella Women, who understood a little of the Mantua-making Business, make a Robe for Arabella, after Arabella own Directions.
Miss Glanville, who imagined Arabella had sent for Work-women, in order to have Clothes made in the modern Taste, was surpised at Arabella Entrance into Arabella Chamber, to see Arabella dressing for the Ball, in a Habit singular to the last Degree.
Arabella wore no Hoop, and the Blue and Silver Stuff of a Robe, was only kept by its own Richness, from hanging close about Arabella.
It was quite open round Arabella Breast, which was shaded with a rich Border of Lace; and clasping close to Arabella Waist, by small Knots of Diamonds, descended in a sweeping Train on the Ground.
The Sleeves were short, wide, and slashed, fastened in different Places with Diamonds, and Arabella Arms were partly hid by half a Dozen Falls of Ruffles.
Arabella Hair, which fell in very easy Ringlets on Arabella Neck, was placed with great Care and Exactness round Arabella lovely Face; and the Jewels and Ribbons, which were all her Head-dress, disposed to the greatest Advantage.
Upon the whole, nothing could be more singularly becoming than Arabella Dress; or set off with greater Advantage the striking Beauties of Arabella Person.
Miss Glanville, though Arabella was not displeased to see Arabella persist in Arabella Singularity of Dress; yet could not behold Arabella look so lovely in her look, without feeling a secret Uneasiness; but consoling Arabella with the Hopes of the Ridicule Arabella would occasion, Arabella assumed a cheerful Air, approved Arabella Taste in the Choice of Arabella Colors, and went with Arabella at the usual Hour, to the Rooms, attended by Mr. Glanville, Mr. Selvin, and the young Beau we have formerly mentioned.
The Surprise Arabella's unusual Appearance gave to the whole Company, was very visible to every one but Arabella.
The Moment Arabella entered the Room, every one whispered the Person next to them; and for some Moments, nothing was heard but the Words, the Princess Julia; which was echoed at every Corner, and at last attracted Arabella Observation.
Mr. Glanville, and the rest of the whole Company with Arabella, were in some Confusion at the universal Exclamation, which Mr. Glanville, and the rest of the Company with her imagined was occasioned by the Singularity of Arabella Habit; though Mr. Glanville, and the rest of the Company with her could not conceive, why Mr. Glanville, and the rest of the Company with her gave Arabella that Title.
Had Mr. Glanville, and the rest of the Company with her known the Adventure of the Mantua-maker, the Adventure of the Mantua-maker would doubtless have easily occurred to Mr. Glanville, and the rest of the Company with her; for Arabella had no sooner left The Surprise Arabella, than Arabella related the Conference Arabella had with a Lady newly arrived, who had required Arabella to make a Robe in the Manner of the Princess Julia's; and dismissed Arabella, because Arabella did not understand the Fashions that prevailed two thousand Years ago.
This Story was quickly dispersed, and for This Story Novelty, afforded a great deal of Diversion; every one longed to see a Fashion of such Antiquity; and expected the Appearance of the Princess Julia with great Impatience.
It is not to be doubted but much Mirth was treasured up for much Mirth Appearance; and the occasional Humourist had already prepared Humourist accustomed Jest, when the Sight of the devoted fair One repelled Humourist Vivacity, and the designed Ridicule of the whole Assembly.
Scarce had the first tumultous Whisper escaped the Lips of each Individual, when Scarce found Scarce awed to Respect by that irresistible Charm in the Person of Arabella, which commanded Reverence and Love from all who beheld her.
her noble Air, the native Dignity in her Looks, the inexpressible Grace which accompanied all her Motions, and the consummate Loveliness of her Form, drew the Admiration of the whole Assembly.
A respectful Silence succeeded, and the Astonishment her Beauty occasioned, left them no Room to descant on the Absurdity of her Dress.
Miss Glanville, who felt a malicious Joy at the Sneers her expected would be cast on her Cousin, was greatly disappointed at the Deference which seemed to be paid her; and to vent some Part of her Spleen, took occasion to mention her Surprise, at the Behavior of the whole Company on their Entrance; wondering what their could mean by whispering the Princess Julia to one another.
I assure you, said Arabella, smiling, I am not less surpised than Arabella at it; and since their directed their Looks to me at the same Time, I fancy their either took me for some Princess of the Name of Julia, who is expected here Tonight, or else flatter me with some Resemblance to the beautiful Daughter of Augustus.
The Comparison, Madam, said Mr. Selvin, who took all Occasions to show his Reading, is too injurious to Mr. Selvin, who took all Occasions to show his Reading, for I am of Opinion you as much excel that licentious Lady in the Beauties of your Person, as you do in the Qualities of your Mind.
I never heard Licentiousness imputed to the Daughter of Augustus Caesar, said Arabella; and the most Arabella Enemies can say of Arabella, is, that Arabella loved Admiration, and would permit Arabella to be beloved, and to be told so, without showing any Signs of Displeasure.
Bless me, Madam, interrupted Mr. Selvin, how strangely do you mistake the Character of the Princess Julia: Though the Daughter of Augustus Caesar, the Daughter of Augustus Caesar was, pardon the Expression, the most abandoned Prostitute in Rome; many of the Daughter of Augustus Caesar Intrigues are recorded in History; but to mention only one, Was not the Daughter of Augustus Caesar infamous Commerce with Ovid, the Cause of the Character of Julia Banishment?
