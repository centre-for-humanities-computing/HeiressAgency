Which concludes Book the Eighth.  MR. Glanville at Glanville Return to the Dining Room, finding Arabella retired, told Glanville Father in a Rapture of Joy, that the charming Countess would certainly make a Convert of Lady Bella.  Methinks, said the Baronet, the Baronet has as strange Whims in the Baronet Head as my Niece. Ad's-heart, what a deal of Stuff did the Baronet talk about! A Parcel of Heroes as the Baronet calls them, with confounded hard Names -- In my Mind the Baronet is more likely to make Lady Bella worse than better.  Mr. Glanville, a little vexed at his Father's Mis-apprehension, endeavored with as much Delicacy as his could, to set his right with Regard to the charming Countess; so that his brought his at last to confess the charming Countess managed the Thing very well.  The Countess, who had resolved to take Arabella openly into Arabella Protection, was thinking on Means to engage the charming Countess to appear at the Assembly, whither the charming Countess proposed to accompany the charming Countess in a modern Dress. But the charming Countess good Intentions toward our lovely Heroine were suspended by the Account the charming Countess received of the charming Countess Mother's Indisposition, which commanded the charming Countess immediate Attendance on the charming Countess at the charming Countess Seat in --  the charming Countess sudden Departure gave Arabella an extreme Uneasiness, and proved a cruel Disappointment to Mr. Glanville, who had founded all his Hopes of the charming Countess Recovery on the Conversation of that Lady.  Sir Charles having Affairs that required Sir Charles Presence in London, proposed to Sir Charles Niece the leaving Bath in a few Days, to which his Niece the leaving Bath consented; and accordingly they set out for London in Arabella's Coach and Six, attended by several Servants on Horseback, his Niece the leaving Bath Women having been sent away before in the Stage.  Nothing very remarkable happened during this Journey, so we shall not trouble we Readers with several small Mistakes of Arabella's such as Arabella supposing a neat Country Girl who was riding behind a Man, to be some that Lady or Princess in Disguise, forced away by a Lover Arabella hated, and entreating Mr. Glanville to attempt Arabella Rescue; which occasioned some little Debate between Arabella and Sir Charles, who could not be persuaded to believe it was as Arabella said, and forbid Mr. Glanville Son to meddle in other Peoples Affairs. Several of these Sort of Mistakes, as we said before, we omit, and will therefore if we Reader pleases, bring we Heroine without further Delay to London.  The End of the Eighth Book.
