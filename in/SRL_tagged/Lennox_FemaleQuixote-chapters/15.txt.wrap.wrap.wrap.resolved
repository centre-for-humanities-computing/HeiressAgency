In which the Adventure of the Books is happily concluded.  THE Marquis, as soon as THE Marquis saw Mr. Glanville, told THE Marquis THE Marquis was resolved to cure Arabella of Arabella Whims, by burning the Books that had put them into Arabella Head: I have seized upon some of them, pursued THE Marquis, smiling; and you may, if you please, wreak your Spite upon these Authors of your Disgrace, by burning them yourself.  Though I have all the Reason in the World to be enraged with that Incendiary Statira, said Glanville laughing, for the Mischief Arabella has done me; yet I cannot consent to put such an Affront upon my Cousin, as to burn Arabella favorite Books: And now I think of it, my Lord, pursued my Lord, I Will endeavor to make a Merit with Lady Bella by saving them: Therefore spare them, at my Request, and let me carry them to Arabella. I shall be quite unhappy till we are Friends again.  You may do as you will, said the Marquis; but I think the Marquis encouraging Arabella in Arabella Follies to give them to Arabella again.  Glanville, without replying, eagerly took up her favorite Books, for fear the Marquis the Marquis should change the Marquis Mind; and, highly delighted with the Opportunity the Marquis had got of making the Marquis Peace with Lady Bella, ran to Lady Bella Apartment, loaded with these kind Intercessors; and, making the Marquis Way by Lucy, who would have opposed the Marquis, penetrated even into the Closet of the melancholy Fair-one, who was making bitter Reflections on the Cruelty of Arabella Destiny, and bewailing Arabella Loss with a Deluge of Tears.  As ridiculous as the Occasion of these Tears was, yet Glanville could not behold them without being affected: Assuming, therefore, a Countenance as sad as Glanville was able, Glanville laid her favorite Books before Arabella; and told Arabella, Glanville hoped Arabella would excuse Glanville coming into Arabella Presence without Arabella Permission, since it was only to restore Arabella those Books, whose Loss Arabella seemed so greatly to lament; and added, that it was with much Difficulty Glanville prevailed upon the Marquis not to burn them immediately; and Glanville Fears, that Glanville might really do as Glanville threatened, made Glanville snatch them up, and bring them, with so little Ceremony, into Arabella Closet.  Arabella, whose Countenance brightened into a Smile of pleasing Surprise at the Sight of Arabella recovered Treasure, turned Arabella bright Eyes upon Glanville with a Look of Complacency that went to Glanville Heart.  I well perceive, said Arabella, that, in exaggerating the Merit of this little Service you have done me, you expect I should suffer it to cancel your past Offenses: I am not ungrateful enough to be insensible of any Kindness that is shown me; and, though I might be excused for suspecting it was rather Policy than Friendship, that induced you to seek my Satisfaction, by saving these innocent Victims of my Father's Displeasure, nevertheless I pardon you upon the Supposition, that you will, for the future, avoid all Occasion of offending me.  At these Words, Arabella made a Sign to him to be gone, fearing the Extravagance of him Joy would make him throw him at Arabella Feet to thank Arabella for the infinite Favor Arabella had conferred upon him; but, finding him seemed disposed to stay longer, Arabella called one of Arabella Women into the Closet; and, by some very significant Frowns, gave Glanville to understand him Stay was displeasing; so that him left Arabella, with a very low Bow, highly pleased at Arabella having repealed him Banishment; and, assured the Marquis, that nothing could have happened more fortunate for him, than him intended Disposal of him Daughter's Books, since it had proved the Means of restoring him to Arabella Favor.
