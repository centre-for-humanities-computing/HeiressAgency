guilty of the Offense, which, with Justice, occasioned your Resentment this Morning; but I assure you, nothing was ever more false. My Thoughts of your Ladyship are very different, and full of the profoundest Respect and Veneration. I have Reason to suspect Mr. Tinsel is the Person who has thus endeavored to prejudice me with your Ladyship; therefore I am excusable if I tell you, that those very Sentiments, too disrespectful to be named, which Mr. Tinsel would persuade you are mine, Mr. Tinsel discovered Mr. Tinsel. Mr. Tinsel then, Madam, is the Person guilty of that Offense the Person so falsely lays to the Charge of the Person, who is, with the utmost Respect and Esteem,  Madam, Your Ladyship's most obedient, and most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.   How Is this, cried Miss Glanville? Why, Madam, you are certainly mistaken. You see most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    utterly denies the Crime of loving you. most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    has suffered very innocently in your Opinion. Indeed, your Ladyship was too hasty in condemning most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.   .  If what most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    says be true, replied Arabella, who had been in extreme Confusion, while a Letter so different from what your Ladyship your Ladyship expected was reading; I have indeed unjustly condemned most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.   . Nevertheless, I am still inclined to believe this is all Artifice; and that most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    is really guilty of entertaining a Passion for me.  But why should most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    take so much Pains to deny so much Pains, Madam, said Miss GlanvilleGlanville? Methinks that looks very odd.  Not at all, interrupted Arabella, whose Spirits were raised by recollecting an Adventure in her Romance, similar to this. most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    has fallen upon the very same Stratagem with Seramenes; who being in Love with the beautiful Cleobuline, Princess of Corinth, took all imaginable Pains to conceal most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    Passion, in order to be near that fair Princess; who would have banished most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    from Princess Presence, had Princess known most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    was in Love with Princess. Nay, most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    went so far in most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    Dissimulation, as to pretend Love to one of the Ladies of Princess Court; that most humble Servant, F. SELVIN.    Passion for Princess might be the less taken notice of. In these Cases therefore, the more resolutely a Man denies a Man , the more pure and violent the is.  Then a Man is certainly very violent, replied Miss Glanville, for most humble Servant, F. SELVIN denies it very resolutely; and I believe none but your Ladyship would have discovered Mr. Selvin Artifice. But shall we not open the other Letter? I have a strong Notion it comes from Tinsel.  For that very Reason I would not be acquainted with the Contents, replied Arabella, You see, most humble Servant, F. SELVIN accuses most humble Servant, F. SELVIN of being guilty of that Offense which most humble Servant, F. SELVIN denies: I shall doubtless, meet with a Confirmation of Mr. Selvin Love in the other LetterLetter. Do not, I beseech you added Arabella, seeing Arabella Cousin preparing to open the other LetterLetter, expose me to the Pain of hearing a presumptuous Declaration of Love. Nay, pursued Arabella, rising in great Emotion, if you are resolved to persecute me by reading it, I Will endeavor to get out of the hearing of it.  You shall not, I declare, said Miss Glanville, laughing and holding Arabella, I Will oblige you to hear it.  I vow, Arabella Cousin, said Arabella Cousin smiling, you use me just as the Princess Cleopatra did the fair and wise Antonia. However, if by this you mean to do any Kindness to the unfortunate Person who wrote that Billet, you are greatly mistaken; since, if you oblige me to listen to a Declaration of Kindness Crime, you will lay me under a Necessity to banish Kindness. A Sentence Kindness would have avoided, while I remained ignorant of A Sentence Kindness.  To this Miss Glanville made no other Reply than by opening the Billet, the Contents of which may be found in the following Chapter.
