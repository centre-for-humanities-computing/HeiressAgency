it, I Will take them both up.
But what did you call this, pursued Lucy?
I must not forget this, or else my Lady will think this a Love-Letter.
A Billet-doux, said the Man.
pursued Lucy, for fear pursued Lucy should forget it, repeated the Words Billet-doux several Times as pursued Lucy went up Stairs; but entering Lucy Lady's Apartment, pursued Lucy perceiving the Letters in Lucy Hand, asked pursued Lucy so sternly, how pursued Lucy durst presume to bring Lucy Lady's Apartment, Lucy perceiving the Letters in Lucy Hand into Lucy Presence, that the poor Girl, in Lucy Fright, forgot the Lesson Lucy had been conning; and endeavoring to recall it into Lucy Memory, took no Notice of my Lady's Question, which pursued Lucy repeated several times, but to no Purpose.
Arabella, surpised at pursued Lucy in-attention, reiterated Lucy Commands, in a Tone somewhat louder than usual; asking pursued Lucy at the same Time, why pursued Lucy did not obey pursued Lucy immediately?
Indeed, pursued Lucy, replied Lucy, your Ladyship would not order me to take back the Letters in Lucy Hand, if you knew what the Letters in Lucy Hand were: the Letters in Lucy Hand are not the Letters in Lucy Hand; I was resolved to be sure of that before I took the Letters in Lucy Hand.
This, pursued Lucy, is a Letter about Business of Consequence; and the other -- Oh dear!
I cannot think what the Man called it!
But it is not a Love-Letter, indeed, Madam.
You are a simple Wench, said Arabella smiling: You may depend upon it, the Letters in Lucy Hand directed to Arabella, must contain Matters of Love and Gallantry; and those I am not permitted to receive.
Take those I am not permitted to receive away then immediately.
But stay, ArabellaArabella, seeing Arabella was about to obey Arabella, one of those I am not permitted to receive, you say, was delivered to Arabella as a Letter of Consequence; perhaps i^ is so: Indeed i^ may contain an Advertisement of some Design to carry me away.
How do I know, but Mr. Selvin, incited by the Man Love and Despair, may intend to make such an Attempt.
Give me that Letter, pursued Lucy, I am resolved to open it.
As for the other -- yet who knows but the other may also bring me Warning of the same Danger from another Quarter.
The Pains Mr. Tinsel took to conceal The Pains Mr. Tinsel Passion, nay, almost as I think, to deny The Pains Mr. Tinsel Passion, amounts to a Proof that The Pains Mr. Tinsel is meditating some Way to make sure of The Pains Mr. Tinsel.
It Is certainly so: Give me that Letter, pursued Lucy; I should be accessory to Letter, pursued Lucy intended Violence, if I neglected this timely Discovery.
Well, cried pursued Lucy, taking one of the Letters, this is exactly like what happened to the beautiful Princess of Cappadocia; who, like The Pains Mr. Tinsel, in one and the same Day, received Advice that two of Lucy Lovers intended to carry pursued Lucy off.
As pursued Lucy pronounced these Words Miss Glanville entered the Room, to whom Arabella immediately recounted the Adventure of the Letters; telling pursued Lucy, pursued Lucy did not doubt, but the Letters the Letters contained a Discovery of some Conspiracy to carry pursued Lucy away.
And whom does your Ladyship suspect of such a strange Design, pray, said Miss Glanville smiling?
At present, replied Arabella, the two Cavaliers who walked with us to Day, are the Persons who seem the most likely to attempt that Violence.
I dare answer for The Pains Mr. Tinsel, replied Miss Glanville, Miss Glanville thinks of no such Thing.
Well, said Arabella, to convince you of your Mistake, I must inform you, that Mr. Selvin, having the Presumption to begin a Declaration of Love to Arabella on the Parade this Morning, I reproved Miss Glanville Miss Glanville severely for Miss Glanville Want of Respect, and threatened Miss Glanville Miss Glanville with my Displeasure; in the Rage of Miss Glanville Jealousy, at seeing me treat Mr. Tinsel well, Miss Glanville Miss Glanville discovered to Arabella, that Miss Glanville Miss Glanville also was as criminal as Miss Glanville, in order to oblige me to a severer Usage of Miss Glanville.
So Miss Glanville Miss Glanville told you Mr. Tinsel was in Love with Arabella, interrupted Miss Glanville?
Miss Glanville Miss Glanville told it me in other Words, replied Arabella; for Miss Glanville Miss Glanville said, Mr. Tinsel was guilty of that Offense, which I resented so severely to Mr. Tinsel.
Miss Glanville beginning to comprehend the Mystery, with great Difficulty forbore laughing at Arabella Cousin's Mistake; for Arabella well knew the Offense Mr. Selvin hinted at, and desirous of knowing what those Letters contained, Arabella begged Arabella to delay opening them no longer.
Arabella, pleased at Arabella Solicitude, opened one of those Letters; but glancing Arabella Eye to the Bottom, and seeing the Name of Selvin, Arabella threw the Name of Selvin hastily upon the Table, and averting Arabella Eyes, What a Mortification have I avoided, said Arabella, that Letter is from Selvin; and questionless, contains an Avowal of Arabella Crime.
Nay, you must read the Name of SelvinSelvin, cried Miss Glanville, taking the Name of Selvin Selvin up; since you have opened the Name of Selvin, the Name of Selvin the same Thing: You can never persuade Arabella but you have seen the Name of SelvinSelvin.
However, to spare your Nicety, I Will read the Name of Selvin Selvin to Arabella.
Which accordingly Arabella did, and found the Name of Selvin Selvin as follows.
MADAM,
