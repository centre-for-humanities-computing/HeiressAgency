A solemn Interview.
IN the mean time, that Fair-one, being risen, and negligently dressed, as was her Custom, went into her Closet, sending to give Miss Glanville Notice, That her was ready to see her.
This Message immediately brought both the Brother and the Sister to the Sister Apartment: And Miss Glanville, at her Brother's Request, staying in the Chamber, where her busied her in looking at her Cousin's Jewels, which lay upon the Toilet, her Cousin came alone into her Closet, in so much Confusion at the Thoughts of the ridiculous Figure Cousin made in complying with Arabella's fantastical Humors, that her Cousin Looks persuading her, there was some great Agitation in Cousin Mind, her expected to see her Cousin fall at her Feet, and endeavor to deprecate her Wrath by a Deluge of Tears.
Miss Glanville however disappointed her in that respect; for, taking a Seat near her, Miss Glanville began to entreat, her with a smiling Countenance, to tell Miss Glanville in what Miss Glanville had offended her; protesting, that Miss Glanville Glanville was not conscious of doing or saying any thing to displease her.
Arabella was greatly confused at this Question, which Arabella thought Arabella had no Reason to expect; it not being possible for Arabella to tell Miss Glanville Arabella was offended, that Miss Glanville Glanville was not in absolute Despair for Arabella Absence, without, at the same time, confessing Arabella looked upon Miss Glanville in the Light of a Lover, whose Expressions of a violent Passion would not have displeased Arabella: Therefore, to disengage Miss Glanville Arabella from the Perplexity Miss Glanville Question threw Miss Glanville Arabella into, Miss Glanville Arabella was obliged to offer some Violence to Arabella Ingenuousness; and, contrary to Miss Glanville Arabella real Belief, tax Miss Glanville again with a Design of betraying Miss Glanville Arabella into the Power of the Unknown.
Miss Glanville, though excessively vexed at Miss Glanville Arabella persisting in so ridiculous an Error, could hardly help smiling at the stern Manner in which Miss Glanville Arabella spoke; but, knowing of what fatal Consequence it would be to Miss Glanville, if Miss Glanville indulged any Gaiety in so solemn a Conference, Miss Glanville composed Mr. Glanville Looks to a Gravity suitable to the Occasion; and asked Miss Glanville Arabella, in a very submissive Tone, What Miss Glanville Arabella was pleased to assign for so extraordinary a Piece of Villainy, as that Miss Glanville Arabella supposed Miss Glanville guilty of?
Truly, answered Miss Glanville Arabella, blushing, I do not pretend to account for the Actions of wicked and ungenerous Persons.
But, Miss Glanville Arabella, resumed Miss Glanville, if I must needs be suspected of a Design to seize upon your Person, methinks it would have been more reasonable to suppose, I would rather use that Violence in Favor of my own Pretensions, than those of any other whatever; for, though you have expressly forbid me to tell you I love you, yet I hope, you still continue to think I do.
I assure you, returned Miss Glanville Arabella, assuming a severe Look, I never gave myself the Trouble to examine your Behavior with Care enough to be sensible, if you still were guilty of the Weakness, which displeased me; but, upon a Supposition, that you repented of your Fault, I was willing to live with Miss Glanville Arabella upon Terms of Civility and Friendship, as became Persons in that Degree of Relationship in which we are: Therefore, if you are wise, you will not renew the Remembrance of those Follies I have long since pardoned; nor seek Occasions of offending me by new ones of the same kind, lest it produce a more severe Sentence than that I formerly laid upon you.
However, Madam, returned Mr. Glanville, you must suffer me to assure you, That my own Interest, which was greatly concerned in your Safety, and my Principles of Honor, would never allow me to engage in so villainous an Enterprise, as that of abetting any Person in stealing you away: Nor can I conceive, how you possibly could imagine a Fellow, who was your menial Servant, could form so presumptuous and dangerous a Design.
By your Manner of speaking, resumed Arabella, one would imagine you were really ignorant, both of the Quality of that presumptuous Man, as well as that presumptuous Man designed Offense: But yet, it is certain, I saw you in that presumptuous Man Company; and saw you ready to draw your Sword in Sword Defense, against my Deliverer.
Had I not the Evidence of my own Senses, for your Guilt, I must confess, I could not be persuaded of it by any other Means: Therefore, since Appearances are certainly against you, it is not strange, if I cannot consent to acquit you in my Apprehenons, till I have more certain Confirmation of your Innocence, than your bare Testimony only; which, at present, has not all the Weight with me it had some time ago.
I protest, Madam, said Mr. Glanville, who was strangely perplexed, I have Reason to think my Case extremely hard, since I have brought me to be suspected by you, only through my Eagerness to find you, and Solicitude for your Welfare.
Doubtless, interrupted Arabella, if you are innocent, your Case is extremely hard; yet your Case is not singular; and therefore you have less Reason to complain: The valiant Coriolanus, who was the most passionate and faithful Lover imaginable, having, by his admirable Valor, assisted the Ravishers of his adored Cleopatra, against those who came to rescue her; and, by his Arm alone, opposed to great Numbers of those who came to rescue her Enemies, facilitated the Execuion of those who came to rescue her Design, had the Mortification afterward to know, that his had, all that time, been fighting against that Divine Princess, who loaded his with the most cruel Reproaches for the Injury his had done her: Yet Fortune was so kind, as to give his the Means of repairing his Fault, and restoring his to some Part of her good Opinion; for, covered with Wounds as his was, and fatigued with fighting, before, yet his undertook, in that Condition, to prevent her Ravishers from carrying her Ravishers Ravishers off; and, for several Hours, continued fighting alone with near Two hundred Men, who were not able to overcome his, notwithstanding his extreme Weariness, and the Multitude of Blows which they aimed at his: Therefore, Glanville, considering you, as Cleopatra did that unfortunate Prince, who was before suspected by Cleopatra, as neither guilty nor innocent, I can only, like Cleopatra, wish you may find some Occasion of justifying yourself, from the Crime laid to your Charge: Till then, I must be under a Necessity of banishing you from my Presence, with the same consolatory Speech Cleopatra used to that unfortunate Prince: -- Go, therefore, Glanville, go, and endeavor your own Justification; I desire you should effect it, no less than you do yourself; and, if my Prayers can obtain from Heaven this Favor for yourself, I shall not scruple to offer some in your behalf.
