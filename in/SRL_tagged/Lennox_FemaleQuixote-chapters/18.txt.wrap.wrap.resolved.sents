Which contains some common Occurrences, but placed in a new Light.
ARABELLA, in a few Days, leaving ARABELLA Chamber, had so many Opportunities of charming ARABELLA Uncle by her Uncle Conversation, which, when it did not turn upon any Incident in ARABELLA Romances, was perfectly fine, easy, and entertaining, that he declared, he should quit the Castle with great Regret; and endeavored to persuade ARABELLA to accompany he to Town: But Arabella, who was determined to pass the Year of ARABELLA Mourning, in the Retirement ARABELLA had always lived in, absolutely refused, strong as ARABELLA Curiosity was, to see London.
Mr. Glanville secretly rejoiced at this Resolution, though Mr. Glanville seemed desirous of making ARABELLA change it; but ARABELLA was unalterable; and, therefore, the Baronet did not think proper to press ARABELLA any more.
ARABELLA Father's Will being read to ARABELLA, ARABELLA seemed extremely pleased with the Articles in favor of Mr. Glanville, wishing the Baronet Joy of the Estate that was bequeathed to the Baronet, with a most enchanting Sweetness.
Mr. Glanville sighed, and cast Mr. Glanville Eyes on the Ground, as Mr. Glanville returned ARABELLA Compliment, with a very low Bow; and Sir Charles, observing Mr. Glanville Confusion, told Arabella, that Mr. Glanville thought it was a very bad Omen for Mr. Glanville Son, to wish his Son Joy of an Estate, which his Son could not come to the Possession of, but by a very great Misfortune.
Arabella, understanding Arabella Meaning, blushed; and, willing to change the Discourse, proceeded to consult Arabella Uncle upon the Regulation of her Uncle House.
Besides the Legacies Arabella Father had bequeathed to her Father Servants, those, who were more immediately about her Father Person, Arabella desired, might have his Servants, those, who were more immediately about his Person Salaries continued to his Servants, those, who were more immediately about his Person: Arabella made no other Alteration, than discharging these Attendants, retaining all the others; and submitting to Arabella Uncle the Management of Arabella Estates, receiving the Allowance he thought proper to assign Arabella, till Arabella was of Age, of which Arabella wanted three Years.
Every Thing being settled, Sir Charles prepared to return to Town.
Mr. Glanville, who desired nothing so much as to stay some time longer with Sir Charles Cousin in Cousin Solitude, got Sir Charles to entreat that Favor for Sir Charles of Arabella: But Cousin represented to Cousin Uncle the Impropriety of a young Gentleman's staying with Cousin, in Cousin House, now Cousin was dead, in a manner so genteel and convincing, that Sir Charles could press it no further; and all that Mr. Glanville could obtain, was, a Permission to visit Cousin some time after, provided Mr. Glanville could prevail upon Mr. Glanville Sister, Miss Charlotte Glanville, to accompany Mr. Glanville.
The Day of their Departure being come, Sir Charles took Sir Charles Leave of Sir Charles charming Niece, with many Expressions of Esteem and Affection; and Mr. Glanville appeared so concerned, that Arabella could not help observing it; and bade Mr. Glanville adieu with great Sweetness.
When their were gone, Cousin found Cousin Time hung heavy upon Cousin Hands; Cousin was continually in Cousin Thoughts, and made Cousin extremely melancholy: Cousin recollected the many agreeable Conversations Cousin had had with Mr. Glanville; and wished it had been consistent with Decency to have detained Mr. Glanville.
Cousin Books being the only Amusement Cousin had left, Cousin applied Cousin to reading with more Eagerness than ever; but, notwithstanding the Delight Cousin took in this Employment, Cousin had so many Hours of Solitude and Melancholy to indulge the Remembrance of Cousin in, that Cousin was very far from being happy.
As Cousin wished for nothing more passionately than an agreeable Companion of Cousin own Sex and Rank, an Accident threw a Person in Cousin Way, who, for some Days, afforded Cousin a little Amusement.
Stepping one Day out of Cousin Coach, to go into Church, Cousin saw a young Lady enter, accompanied with a middle-aged Woman, who seemed to be an Attendant.
As Arabella had never seen any one, above the Rank of a Gentleman Farmer's Daughter, in Church, Cousin Attention was immediately engaged by the Appearance of this Stranger, who was very magnificently dressed: Though Cousin did not seem to be more than eighteen Years of Age, Cousin Statute was above the ordinary Size of Women; and, being rather too plump to be delicate, Cousin Mien was so majestic, and such an Air of Grandeur was diffused over her Mien whole Person, joined to the Charms of a very lovely Face, that Arabella could hardly help thinking Arabella saw the beautiful Candace before her Mien, who, by Scudery's Description, very much resembled this Fair one.
Arabella, having heedfully observed Arabella Looks, thought Arabella saw a great Appearance of Melancholy in Arabella Eyes, which filled Arabella with a generous Concern for the Misfortunes of so admirable a Person; but, the Service beginning, Arabella was not at Liberty to indulge Arabella Reflections upon this Occasion, as Arabella never suffered any Thoughts, but those of Religion, to intrude upon Arabella Mind, during these pious Rites.
As Arabella was going out of Church Arabella observed the young Lady, attended only with the Woman who came with Arabella, preparing to walk home, and therefore stepped forward, and, saluting Arabella with a Grace peculiar to Arabella, entreated Arabella to come into Arabella Coach, and give Arabella the Pleasure of setting Arabella down at Arabella own House: So obliging an Offer from a Person of Arabella's Rank could not fail of being received with great Respect by the young Lady, who was not ignorant of all the Forms of Good-breeding; and, accepting Arabella Invitation, Arabella stepped into her Coach; Arabella obliging Arabella Woman to come in also, for whom, as Arabella had that Day only Lucy along with only Lucy, there was Room enough.
As they were going home, Arabella, who longed to be better acquainted, entreated the fair Stranger, as only Lucy called only Lucy, to go to the Castle, and spend the Day with only Lucy; and only Lucy consenting, they passed by the House where only Lucy lodged, and alighted at the Castle, where Arabella welcomed only Lucy, with the most obliging Expressions of Civility and Respect.
only Lucy, though perfectly versed in the Modes of Town-Breeding, and nothing-meaning Ceremony, was at a Loss how to make proper Returns to the Civilities of Arabella: The native Elegance and Simplicity of only Lucy Manners were accompanied with so much real Benevolence of Heart, such insinuating Tenderness, and Graces so irresistible, that only Lucy was quite oppressed with them; and, having spent most of only Lucy Time between only Lucy Toilet and Quadrille, was so little qualified for partaking a Conversation so refined as Arabella's, that only Lucy Discourse appeared quite tedious to only Lucy, since it was neither upon Fashions, Assemblies, Cards, or Scandal.
only Lucy Silence, and that Absence of Mind, which only Lucy betrayed, made Arabella conclude, only Lucy was under some very great Affliction; and, to amuse only Lucy after Dinner, led only Lucy into the Gardens, supposing a Person, whose Uneasiness, as only Lucy did not doubt, proceeded from Love, would be pleased with the Sight of Groves and Streams, and be tempted to disclose only Lucy Misfortunes, while they wandered in that agreeable Privacy.
In this, however, only Lucy was deceived; for, though only Lucy sighed several times, yet, when only Lucy did speak, it was only of indifferent Things, and not at all in the manner of an afflicted Heroine.
After observing upon a thousand Trifles, only Lucy told Arabella at last, to whom only Lucy was desirous of making known only Lucy Alliance to Quality, that the Gardens were extremely like those of only Lucy Father's-in-Law, the Duke of -- at --  At this Intimation, only Lucy expected Arabella would be extremely surprised; but that Lady, whose Thoughts were always familiarized to Objects of Grandeur, and would not have been astonished, if only Lucy had understood only Lucy Guest was the Daughter of a King, appeared so little moved, that only Lucy was piqued by only Lucy Indifference; and, after a few Moment's Silence, began to mention going away.
Arabella, who was desirous of retaining only Lucy a few Days, entreated only Lucy so obligingly to favor only Lucy with only Lucy Company, for some time, in only Lucy , that the other could not refuse; and, dispatching only Lucy to the House where she lodged, to inform them of only Lucy Stay at the Castle, would have dispensed with only Lucy coming again to attend only Lucy, had not Arabella insisted upon the contrary.
The Reserve, which the Daughter-in-Law of the Duke of -- still continued to maintain, notwithstanding the repeated Expressions of Arabella used to Arabella, increased Arabella Curiosity to know Arabella Adventures, which Arabella was extremely surprised, Arabella had never offered to relate; but, attributing Arabella Silence, upon this Head, to Arabella Modesty, Arabella was resolved, as was the Custom in those Cases, to oblige Arabella Woman, who, Arabella presumed, was Arabella Confidante, to relate, Arabella Lady's History to Arabella; and sending for this Person one Day, when Arabella was alone, to attend Arabella in Arabella Closet, Arabella gave Orders to Arabella Women, if the fair Stranger came to inquire for Arabella, to say Arabella was then busy, but would wait on Arabella as soon as possible.
After this Caution, Arabella ordered Mrs. Morris to be admitted; and, obliging Arabella to sit down, told Arabella, Arabella sent for Arabella in order to hear from Arabella the History of her Lady's Life, which Arabella was extremely desirous of knowing.
Mrs. Morris, who was a Person of Sense, and had seen the World, was extremely surprised at this Request of Arabella, which was quite contrary to the Laws of Good-breeding; and, as Arabella thought, betrayed a great deal of impertinent Curiosity: Arabella could not tell how to account for the free Manner in which Arabella desired Arabella to give up her Lady's Secrets, which, indeed, were not of a Nature to be told; and appeared so much confused, that Arabella took Notice of it; and, supposing it was Arabella Bashfulness which caused Arabella Embarrassment, Arabella endeavored to re-assure Arabella by the most affable Behavior imaginable.
Mrs. Morris, who was not capable of much Fidelity for her Ladyher Lady, being but lately taken into Arabella Service, and not extremely fond of Arabella, thought Arabella had now a fine Opportunity of recommending Arabella to Arabella, by telling Arabella all Arabella knew of Miss Groves, for that was Arabella Name; and, therefore, told Arabella, since Arabella was pleased to command it, Arabella would give Arabella what Account Arabella was able of her Lady; but entreated Arabella to be secret, because it was of great Consequence to Arabella, that Arabella Affairs should not be known.
I always imagined, said Arabella, that your beautiful Mistress had some particular Reason for not making Arabella known, and for coming in this private Manner into this Part of the Country: You may assure Arabella therefore, that I will protect Arabella as far as I am able, and offer Arabella all the Assistance in my Power to give Arabella: Therefore you may acquaint me with Arabella Adventures, without being apprehensive of a Discovery that would be prejudicial to Arabella.
Mrs. Morris, who had been much better pleased with the Assurances of a Reward for the Intelligence Arabella was going to give Arabella, looked a little foolish at these fine Promises, in which Arabella had no Share; and Arabella, supposing Arabella was endeavoring to recollect all the Passages of her Lady's Life, told her Lady, her Lady need not give her Lady the Trouble to acquaint her Lady with any thing that passed during the Infancy of her Lady, but proceed to acquaint her Lady with Matters of greater Importance: And since, said her Lady, you have, no doubt, been most favored with her Lady Confidence, you will do me a Pleasure to describe to her Lady, exactly, all the Thoughts of her Lady Soul, as her Lady has communicated said she, you have to you, that I may the better comprehend her Lady History.
