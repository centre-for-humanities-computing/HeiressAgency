A very mysterious Chapter.
ARABELLA, who impatiently longed for the Hour of meeting the fair Princess, with whom she was extremely delighted, consulted she Watch so often, and discovered so much Restlessness and Anxiety, that Mr. Glanville began to be surpised; and the more, as she peremptorily commanded Mr. Glanville not to attend she in she Evening Walk.
This Prohibition, which, though Mr. Glanville durst not dispute, Mr. Glanville secretly resolved to disobey; and as soon as she set out for the Park with she usual Attendants, Mr. Glanville slipped out by a Backdoor, and keeping she in Mr. Glanville Sight, Mr. Glanville unseen, she ventured to watch she Motions.
As Mr. Glanville had expected to unravel some great Mystery, Mr. Glanville was agreeably disappointed to find she continued she Walk in the Park with great Composure; and though she was soon joined by the imaginary Princess, yet conceiving she to be some young Lady, with whom she had commenced an Acquaintance at Richmond, Mr. Glanville Heart was at Rest; and for fear of displeasing she, Mr. Glanville took a contrary Path from that she was in, that Mr. Glanville might not meet she, yet resolved to stay till Mr. Glanville thought she would be inclined to return, and then show Mr. Glanville, and conduct she Home.
A Solicitude for which Mr. Glanville did not imagine she need be offended.
The two Ladies being met, after reciprocal Compliments, the imaginary Princess entreated Arabella to relate the imaginary Princess Adventures; who not being willing to violate the Laws of Romance, which require an unbounded Confidence upon these Occasions, began very succinctly to recount the History of she Life; which, as she managed it, contained Events almost as Romantic and Incredible as any in she Romances; winding The two Ladies up with a Confession that she did not hate Mr. Glanville, whom she acknowledged to be one of the most faithful and zealous of Lovers.
Cynecia with a Sigh, congratulated she upon the Fidelity of a Lover, who by she Description, was worthy the Place he possessed in she Esteem: And expressing a Wish, that she could see, unobserved by he, this gallant and generous Person, Arabella, who that Moment espied he at a Distance, yet advancing toward the Fidelity of a Lover, who by she Description, was worthy the Place he possessed in she Esteem, told she, with a Blush that overspread all she Face, That she Curiosity might be satisfied in the Manner she wished, for, yonder, added she is the Person we have been talking of.
Cynecia, at these Words, looking toward the Place where she fair Friend had directed; no sooner cast she Eyes upon Mr. Glanville, than giving a loud Cry, she sunk into the Arms of Arabella, who, astonished and perplexed as she was, eagerly held Friend had directed; no sooner cast she Eyes upon Mr. Glanville, than giving a loud Cry out to support she.
Finding she in a Swoon, she dispatched.
Lucy, who was near she, to look for some Water to throw in she Face; but that she breathing a deep Sigh, opened she languishing Eyes, and fixing a melancholy Look upon Arabella,  Ah!
she, said she, wonder not at my Affliction and Surprise, since in the Person of your Lover I behold the ungrateful Ariamenes.
Oh Heavens!
she, replied Arabella, What is it you say?
Is it possible Mr. Glanville can be Ariamenes?
Mr. Glanville, cried she with a disordered Accent, He whom I now behold!
and whom you call Mr. Glanville, was once Ariamenes, the perjured, the ungrateful Ariamenes.
Adieu, Madam, I cannot bear this Sight; I will hide Mr. Glanville from the World for ever; nor need you fear a Rival or an Enemy in the unfortunate Cynecia, who if possible, will cease to love the ungrateful Ariamenes, and will never hate Arabella.
Saying this, without giving she Time to answer, she took hold of she Confidant by the Arm, and went away with so much Swiftness, that she was out of sight before Arabella Arabella was enough recovered from she Astonishment to be able to entreat she Stay.
Our charming Heroine, ignorant till now of the true State of she Heart, was surpised to find it assaulted at once by all the Passions which attend disappointed Love.
Grief, Rage, Jealousy, and Despair made so cruel a War in she gentle Bosom, that unable either to express or to conceal the strong Emotions with which she was agitated, she gave Way to a violent Burst of Tears, leaning she Head upon Lucy's Shoulder, who wept as heartily as she Lady, though ignorant of the Cause of she Affliction.
Mr. Glanville, who was now near enough to take Notice of she Posture, came running with eager Heart to see what was the matter; when Arabella, roused from she Extacy of Grief by the Sound of Arabella Steps, lifted up Head, and seeing Arabella approach,  Lucy, cried Lucy, trembling with the Violence of Lucy Resentment, Tell that Traitor to keep out of my Sight.
TraitorTraitor, I forbid Traitor ever to appear before Arabella again.
And, tell Traitor, LucyLucy, with a Sigh that shook Lucy whole tender Frame, All that Blood in Traitor Body is too little to wash away Traitor Guilt, or to pacify my Indignation.
Then hastily turning away, Lucy ran toward Lucy other Attendants, who were at some Distance; and joining Lucy Women, proceeded directly Home.
Mr. Glanville, amazed at this Action, was making after Lucy as fast as he could, when Lucy crossing in he Way, cried out to he to stop.
Lucy, said Lucy, bid me tell you, Traitor --  Hey day!
interrupted Glanville, What the Devil does Lucy mean?
Pray Sir, said Lucy, let me deliver my Message: I shall forget if you speak to Pray Sir till I have said it all -- Stay, let me see, What comes next?
No more Traitor, I hope, said Glanville.
Nor, Pray Sir, said Lucy; but there was something about washing in Blood, and you must keep out of Lucy Sight, and not appear before the Nation -- Oh dear!
I have forgot it half: Lucy was in such a piteous Taking, I forgot it, I believe, as soon as Lucy said it.
What shall I do?
--  No Matter, said Glanville, I Will overtake Lucy, and ask --  No, no, Pray Sir, said Lucy, Pray don't do that, Pray , Lucy will be very angry:
