A single Combat fought with prodigious Valor, and described with amazing Accuracy.
GIVE me Leave, Sir, said Sir Charles, to ask, If you eat in all this Time?
Alas!
Sir Charles, replied Sir George, Sighs and Tears were all my Sustenance.
Sir George, Sighs and Tears, laughing at this Answer, Arabella seemed greatly confused:  It is not to be imagined, said Arabella, that Sir George; or, to say better, Prince Viridmore, lived Ten Months without eating any thing to support Nature; but such trifling Circumstances are always left out, in the Relations of Histories; and truly an Audience must be very dull and unapprehensive, that cannot conceive, without being told, that a Man must necessarily eat in the Space of Ten Months.
But Sir George lived on, replied the Baronet, was very unsubstantial, and would not afford Sir George much Nourishment.
I suppose, resumed Arabella, Sir George lived upon such Provisions as the Forest afforded Sir George; such as wild Fruits, Herbs, bitter Sallads, and the like; which, considering the Melancholy that possessed Sir George, would appear a voluptuous Repast; and which the unfortunate Orontes, when Sir George was in the same Situation, thought infinitely too good for Sir George.
Sir George, finding Arabella took no Notice of the Historian's Hyperbole of living upon Sir George Sighs and Tears, passed it over, for fear of offending Arabella; and Sir George, who had been in some Anxiety how to bring Sir George off, when Sir George perceived Arabella was reasonable enough to suppose Sir George must have eat during Sir George Abode in the Forest, went on with Sir George Relation in this Manner.
I lived, as I before observed to you, Madam, in this Cave for Ten Months; and truly I was so reconciled to that solitary way of Life, and found so much Sweetness in it, that I believe, I should have remained there till this Day, but for the Adventure which I am going to recount.
It being my Custom to walk out every Evening in the Forest; returning to this Cave, something later then usual, I heard the Cries of a Woman at some Distance, who seemed to be in Distress: I stopped to listen from what Side those Cries proceeded; and perceiving they seemed to approach nearer to me, I took down my Armor from the Tree where I had hung my Armor; and hastily arming me, shaped my Course toward the Place from whence those Complaints seemed to come, resolving to assist that unknown Person with all the Strength that was left me.
Having gone some Paces, I spied through the Branches of the Trees a Man on Horseback with a Lady, who struggled to get loose, and at times calling aloud for Succor.
This Sight inflaming me with Rage against that impious Ravisher; I flew toward that impious Ravisher: And when I came within hearing;  Hold, Wretch!
cried I, and cease to offer Violence to that Lady, whom thou bear away by Force; or prepare to defend thyself against one, who will die, before thyself will suffer thyself to prosecute thy unjust Designs.
that impious Ravisher, without answering me, clapped Spurs to that impious Ravisher Horse; and it would have been impossible to have overtaken that impious Ravisher, had not my own Horse, which had never quitted the Forest, appeared in my View: I quickly mounted that impious Ravisher, and followed the Track that impious Ravisher had taken, with such Speed, that I came up with that impious Ravisher in a Moment.
Caitiff!
said I, release the Lady, and defend thyself.
These Words, which I accompanied with a thundering Blow upon his Headpiece, obliged his to set down the Lady, who implored Heaven, with the utmost Ardour, to grant me the Victory: And, recoiling back a few Paces, to take a View of that impious Ravisher,  I know not, said his, for what Reason thou set thyself to oppose my Designs; but I well know, that thou shall dearly repent of thy Temerity.
Saying this, his advanced furiously toward that impious Ravisher, and aimed so heavy a Blow at my Head, that, had I not received this on my Shield, I might happily have no longer been in a Condition to defend the Lady: But, having, with the greatest Dexterity imaginable, avoided this Blow, I made at his with so much Fierceness, and directed my Aims so well, that in a few Moments I wounded his in several Places; and his Arms were all dyed with his Blood.
This good Success redoubled my Vigor; and having, by a lucky Stroke with my Sword, cut the Strings of a lucky Stroke with my Sword Headpiece, it fell off: And a lucky Stroke with my Sword being bare, I was going to let fall a dreadful Blow upon it, which doubtles^ would have shivered it in a thousand Pieces, when a lucky Stroke with my Sword cried out for Quarter, and, letting fall my Sword, by that Action assured me my Victory was entire.
Live Wretch, cried I, since thou art base enough to value Life after being vanquished; but swear upon my Sword, that thou will never more attempt the Liberty of that Lady.
While I was speaking, I perceived a lucky Stroke with my Sword was no longer able to sit a lucky Stroke with my Sword Horse: But, staggering a Moment, a lucky Stroke with my Sword fell off, and lay extended without Motion upon the Ground.
Touched with Compassion at this Sight, I alighted, and, supposing a lucky Stroke with my Sword to be in a Swoon, was preparing to give a lucky Stroke with my Sword some Assistance; but, upon my nearer Approach, I found a lucky Stroke with my Sword was quite dead.
Leaving therefore this mournful Object, I I turned about, with an Intention to go and offer that Lady my further Help; but I perceived that Lady already at my Feet.
Valiant Knight, said that Lady, with a Tone of Voice so bewitching, that all my Faculties were suspended, as by Enchantment, suffer me, on my Knees, to thank you, for the Deliverance you have procured me from that base Man; since to your admirable Valor I owe not only the Preservation of my Life; but, what is infinitely dearer to me, my Honor.
The Astonishment, wherewith I beheld the miraculous Beauty that appeared before me, kept me a Moment in such an attentive Gaze, that I forgot that Lady was at my Feet: Recollecting me, however, with some Confusion at my Neglect,  Oh!
rise, that Lady, cried I, helping that Lady up with infinite Respect, and debase not such Perfection to a Posture, in which all the Monarchs on the Earth might glory to appear before the Earth.
That you may the better conceive the Alteration which the Sight of this fair Unknown produced in my Soul, I will endeavor, to give you a Description of that Lady Beauty, which was altogether miraculous.
