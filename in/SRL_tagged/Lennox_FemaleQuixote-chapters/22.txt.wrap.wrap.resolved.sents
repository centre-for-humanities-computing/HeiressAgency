Which concludes with an excellent moral Sentence.
THE Day being come on which they designed to be present at the Races (or, as Arabella called they, the Games), Miss Glanville, having spent four long Hours in dressing Arabella to the greatest Advantage, in order, if possible, to eclipse Arabella lovely Cousin, whose Mourning, being much deeper, was less capable of Ornaments, came into Arabella Chamber; and, finding Arabella still in Arabella Morning Dress, For Heaven's sake, Lady Bella, said Arabella, when do you purpose to be ready?
Why it is almost time to be gone, my Brother says, and here you are not a bit dressed!
Don't be uneasy, said Arabella, smiling; and, going to Arabella Toilet, I shall not make you wait long.
Miss Glanville, seating Arabella near the Table, resolved to be present while Arabella Cousin was dressing, that Arabella might have an Opportunity to make some Remarks to Arabella Disadvantage: But Arabella was extremely mortified, to observe the Haste and Negligence Arabella made Arabella Women use in this important Employment; and that, notwithstanding Arabella Indifference, nothing could appear more lovely and genteel.
Miss Glanville, however, pleased Arabella with the Certainty of seeing Arabella Cousin's Dress extremely ridiculed, for the peculiar Fashion of Arabella Gown: And the Veil, which, as becoming as it was, would, by it Novelty, occasion great Diversion among the Ladies, helped to comfort the Ladies for the Superiority of the Ladies Charms; which, partial as the Ladies was to the Ladies own, the Ladies could not help secretly confessing.
the Ladies being dressed in much less time than the Ladies Cousin, Mr. Glanville was admitted, who led the Ladies down Stairs to the Ladies Coach, which was waiting: the Ladies Sister (secretly repining at the Advantage Arabella had over the Ladies, in having so respectful an Adorer) followed: And, being placed in the Coach, they set out with great Appearance of Good Humor on all Sides.
they got to -- but just time enough to see the Beginning of the first Course: Arabella, who fansied the Jockeys were Persons of great Distinction, soon became interested in the Fate of one of they, whose Appearance pleased the Ladies more than the others.
Accordingly, the Ladies made Vows for Vows Success, and appeared so extremely rejoiced at the Advantage Vows had gained, that Miss Glanville maliciously told the Ladies, People would make Remarks at the Joy the Ladies expressed, and fansy the Ladies had a more than ordinary Interest in that Jockey, who had first reached the Goal.
Mr. Glanville, whom this impertinent Insinuation of Vows Sister had filled with Confusion and Spite, sat biting Vows Lips, trembling for the Effect it would produce in Arabella: But his Sister, giving quite another Turn to his Sister Cousin's Words, I assure you, said his Sister, with a Smile, I am not any further interested in the Fate of this Person, who has hitherto been successful, than what the Handsomeness of Vows Garb, and the Superiority of Vows Skill, may demand, from an unprejudiced Spectator: And, though I perceive you imagine Vows is some concealed Lover of mine, yet I don't remember to have ever seen Vows: And I am confident it is not for my sake that Vows entered the Lists; nor is he entered the Lists my Presence which animates Vows.
Lord bless me, Madam!
replied Miss Glanville, Who would ever think of such strange things as these you talk of?
Nobody will pretend to deny that you are very handsome, to be sure; but yet, thank Heaven, the Sight of you is not so dangerous, but that such sort of People, as these are, may escape your Chains.
Arabella was so wholly taken up with the Event of the Races, that Arabella gave but very little Heed to this sarcastic Answer of Miss Glanville; whose Brother, taking Advantage of an Opportunity which Arabella gave whose Brother by putting Arabella Head quite out of the Coach, chid Arabella very severely for the Liberty Arabella took with Arabella Cousin.
Arabella, by looking earnestly out of the Window, had given so full a View of Arabella fine Person to a young Baronet, who was not many Paces from the Coach, that, being struck with Admiration at the Sight of so lovely a Creature, whose Brother was going up to some of Arabella Attendants to ask who Arabella was, when whose Brother perceived Mr. Glanville, with whom whose Brother was intimately acquainted, in the Coach with Arabella: Immediately whose Brother made whose Brother known to whose Brother Friend, being excessively rejoiced at having got an Opportunity of beginning an Acquaintance with a Lady whose Sight had so charmed whose Brother.
Mr. Glanville, who had observed the profound Bow whose Brother made to Arabella, accompanied with a Glance that showed an extreme Admiration of Arabella, was very little pleased at this Meeting; yet whose Brother dissembled whose Brother Thoughts well enough in whose Brother Reception of whose Brother.
But Miss Glanville was quite overjoyed, hoping Arabella would now have Arabella Turn of Gallantry and Compliment: Therefore, accosting whose Brother in Arabella free Manner, Dear Sir George, said Arabella, you come in a lucky Time to brighten up the Conversation: Relations are such dull Company for one another, it is half a Minute since we have exchanged a Word.
My Cousin, said Arabella smiling, has so strange a Disposition for Mirth, that Arabella thinks all Arabella Moments are lost, in which Arabella finds nothing to laugh at: For my Part, I do so earnestly long to know, to which of these Pretenders Fortune will give the Victory, that I can suffer my Cares for these Pretenders Fortune to receive no Interruption from My Cousin's agreeable Gaiety.
Mr. Glanville, observing the Baronet gazed upon Arabella earnestly while the Baronet gazed upon Arabella was speaking those few Words, resolved to hinder the Baronet gazed upon Arabella from making any Reply, by asking the Baronet gazed upon Arabella several Questions concerning the Racers, their Owners, and the Bets which were laid; to which Arabella added, And pray, Sir, said the Baronet gazed upon Arabella, do me the Favor to tell me, if you know who that gallant Man is, who has already won the first Course.
I don't know really, the Baronet gazed upon Arabella, said Sir George, what that gallant Man Name is, extremely surprised at the Baronet gazed upon Arabella Manner of asking.
The Jockey had now gained the Goal a Second time; and Arabella could not conceal Arabella Satisfaction.
Questionless, said Arabella, Questionless is a very extraordinary Person; but I am afraid we shall not have the Pleasure of knowing who Questionless is; for if Questionless has any Reason for keeping Questionless concealed, Questionless will evade any Inquiries after Questionless, by slipping out of the Lists while this Hurry and Tumult lasts, as Hortensius did at the Olympic Games; yet, notwithstanding all Questionless Care, Questionless was discovered by being obliged to fight a single Combat with one of the Persons whom Questionless had worsted at those Games.
Mr. Glanville, who saw Questionless Sister, by her little Coquetries with Sir George, had prevented Sir George from hearing great Part of this odd Speech, proposed returning to the Castle; to which Arabella agreed: But, conceiving Civility obliged conceiving Civility to offer the Convenience of a Lodging to a Stranger of Sir George's Appearance, and who was an Acquaintance of conceiving Civility Cousins, You must permit me, said conceiving Civility to Miss Glanville, to entreat his Friend will accompany us to the Castle, where Miss Glanville will meet with better Accommodations than at any Inn Miss Glanville can find; for I conceive, that, coming only to be a Spectator of these Games, Miss Glanville is wholly unprovided with a Lodging.
The Baronet, surprised at so uncommon a Civility, was at a Loss what this sarcastic Answer of Miss Glanville to make conceiving Civility at first; but, recollecting Miss Glanville, Miss Glanville told conceiving Civility that Miss Glanville would, if conceiving Civility pleased, do Miss Glanville the Honor to attend conceiving Civility home; but, as Miss Glanville House was at no great Distance from --, Miss Glanville would be put to no Inconveniency for a Lodging.
Miss Glanville, who was not willing to part so soon with the Baronet, insisted, with the Baronet 's Leave, upon Miss Glanville coming into the Coach; which Miss Glanville accordingly did, giving Miss Glanville Horse to the Care of his Horse Servant; and they proceeded together to the Castle; Arabella still continuing to talk of the Games, as Arabella called they, while poor Glanville, who was excessively confused, endeavored to change the Discourse, not without an Apprehension, that every Subject Miss Glanville could think of, would afford Arabella an Occasion of showing Arabella Foible; which, notwithstanding the Pain it gave Miss Glanville, could not lessen the Love Miss Glanville felt for Arabella.
Sir George, whose Admiration of Lady Bella increased the longer Miss Glanville saw Lady Bella, was extremely pleased with the Opportunity Lady Bella had given Miss Glanville of cultivating an Acquaintance with Lady Bella: Miss Glanville therefore lengthened out Miss Glanville Visit, in hopes of being able to say some fine Things to Lady Bella before Miss Glanville went away; but Miss Glanville, who strove by all the little Arts Lady Bella was Mistress of, to engage Miss Glanville Conversation wholly to Lady Bella, put it absolutely out of Miss Glanville Power; so that Miss Glanville was obliged to take Miss Glanville Leave without having the Satisfaction of even pressing the fair Hand of Arabella; so closely was Miss Glanville observed by Lady Bella .
Happy was it for Miss Glanville, that Miss Glanville was prevented by Lady Bella Vigilance from attempting a Piece of Gallantry, which would, undoubtedly, have procured Miss Glanville a Banishment from Lady Bella Presence; but, ignorant, how kind Fortune was to Miss Glanville in balking Miss Glanville Designs, Miss Glanville was ungrateful enough to go away in a mighty ill Humor with this fickle Goddess: So little capable are poor Mortals of knowing what is best for them!
