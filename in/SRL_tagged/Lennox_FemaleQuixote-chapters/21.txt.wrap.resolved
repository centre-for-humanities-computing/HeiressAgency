Which treats of the Olympic Games.  WHILE Arabella was ruminating on the unaccountable Behavior of Arabella new Acquaintance, Arabella received a Letter from Arabella Uncle, informing Arabella (for Arabella had expressly forbid Mr. Glanville to write to Arabella), that Mr. Glanville Son and Daughter intended to set out for Arabella Seat in a few Days.  This News was received with great Satisfaction by Arabella, who hoped to find an agreeable Companion in Arabella Cousin; and was not so insensible of Mr. Glanville's Merit, as not to feel some kind of Pleasure at the Thought of seeing Mr. Glanville's Merit again.  a Letter was soon followed, by the Arrival of Mr. Glanville, and Mr. Glanville Sister; who, upon the Sight of Arabella, discovered some Appearance of Astonishment and Chagrin; for, notwithstanding all Chagrin Brother had told Chagrin of Chagrin Accomplishments, Chagrin could not conceive it possible for a young Lady, bred up in the Country, to be so perfectly elegant and genteel as Chagrin found Chagrin .  As Miss Charlotte had a large Share of Coquetry in Chagrin Composition, and was fond of Beauty in none of Chagrin own Sex but Chagrin, Chagrin was sorry to see Lady Bella possessed of so great a Share; and, being in Hopes all her Brother had drawn a flattering Figure of Chagrin , Chagrin was extremely disappointed at finding the Original so handsome.  Arabella, on the contrary, was highly pleased with Miss Glanville; and, finding Arabella Person very agreeable, did not fail to commend Arabella Beauty: A sort of Complaisance mightily in Use among the Heroines, who knew not what Envy or Emulation meant.  Miss Glanville Miss Glanville received Chagrin Praises with great Politeness, but could not find in Chagrin Heart to return them: And, as soon as these Compliments were over, Miss Glanville told Lady Bella, how tedious Miss Glanville had found the short Absence Lady Bella had forced Miss Glanville to, and how great was Miss Glanville Satisfaction at seeing Lady Bella again.  I shall not dispute the Truth of your last Assertion, replied Arabella, smiling, since I verily believe, you are mighty well satisfied at present; but I know not how you will make it appear, that an Absence, which you allow to be short, has seemed so tedious to Arabella; for this is a manifest Contradiction: However, pursued Lady Bella, preventing his Reply, you look so well, and so much at Ease, that I am apt to believe, the short Absence has agreed very well with Arabella.  And yet I assure you, Lady Bella, said Miss Glanville, interrupting Lady Bella, that I have suffered more Uneasiness during this Absence, than I fear you will permit me to tell you.  Since, replied Arabella, that Uneasiness has neither made you thinner, nor paler, I don't think you ought to be pitied: For, to say the Truth, in these Sort of Matters, a Person's bare Testimony has but little Weight.  Miss Glanville was going to make Lady Bella some Answer; when Miss Glanville, who, while they had been speaking, was adjusting Lady Bella Dress at the Glass, came up to they, and made the Conversation more general.  After Dinner, they adjourned to the Gardens, where the gay Miss Glanville, running eagerly from one Walk to another, gave Lady Bella Brother as many Opportunities of talking to Lady Bella as her Brother could wish: However, her Brother stood in such Awe of Lady Bella, and dreaded so much another Banishment, that her Brother did not dare, otherwise than by distant Hints, to mention her Brother Passion; and Arabella, well enough pleased with a Respect that in some measure came up to Lady Bella Expectation, discovered no Resentment at Insinuations Lady Bella was at Liberty to dissemble the Knowledge of: And if her Brother could not, by Lady Bella Behavior, flatter her Brother with any great Hopes, yet her Brother found as little Reason, in Arabella's Language, to despair.  Miss Glanville, at the End of a few Weeks, was so tired of the magnificent Solitude Lady Bella lived in, that Lady Bella heartily repented Lady Bella Journey; and insinuated to Lady Bella Brother, Lady Bella Inclination to return to Town.  Miss Glanville, knowing Miss Glanville Stay was regulated by Miss Glanville Sister's, entreated his Sister not to expose Miss Glanville to the Mortification of leaving Arabella so soon; and promised his Sister Miss Glanville would contrive some Amusements for his Sister, which should make his Sister relish the Country better than his Sister had yet done.  Accordingly, Miss Glanville proposed to Arabella to go to the Races, which were to be held at -- a few Miles from the Castle: Arabella would have excused Arabella, upon account of Arabella Mourning; but Miss Glanville discovered so great an Inclination to be present at this Diversion, that Arabella could no longer refuse to accompany Arabella.  Since, said Arabella to Miss Glanville, you are fond of public Diversions, it happens very luckily, that these Races are to be held at the Time you are here: I never heard of these Races before, and I presume it is a good many Years since these Races were last celebrated. Pray, Sir, pursued Arabella, turning to Miss Glanville, do not these Races, in some Degree, resemble the Olympic Games? Do the Candidates ride in Chariots?  No, Arabella, replied Miss Glanville; the Jockeys are mounted upon the fleetest Coursers the Jockeys can procure; and he who first reaches the Goal obtains the Prize.  And who is the fair Lady that is to bestow it? resumed Arabella: I dare engage one of Arabella Lovers will enter the Lists; Arabella will, doubtless, be in no less Anxiety than he; and the Shame of being overcome, will hardly affect he with more Concern, than Arabella; that is, provided he be so happy as to have gained Arabella Affections. I cannot help thinking the fair Elismonda was extremely happy in this Particular: For Arabella had the Satisfaction to see Arabella secret Admirer Victor in all the Exercises at the Olympic Games, and carry away the Prize from many Princes, and Persons of rare Quality, who were Candidates with Admirer Victor; and Admirer Victor had also the Glory to receive three Crowns in one Day, from the Hands of Admirer Victor adored Princess; who, questionless, bestowed them upon Admirer Victor with an infinite deal of Joy.  What Sort of Races were those, Arabella? said Miss Glanville; whose Reading had been very confined.  the Olympic Games, Miss, said Arabella, so called from Olympia, a City near which The Olympic Games, Miss were performed, in the Plains of Elis, consisted of Foot and Chariot-Races; Combats with the Cestus; Wrestling, and other Sports. The Olympic Games, Miss were instituted in Honor of the Gods and Heroes; and were therefore termed sacred, and were considered as a Part of Religion.  The Olympic Games, Miss were a kind of School, or military Apprenticeship; in which the Courage of the Youth found constant Employment: And the Reason why Victory in those Games was attended with such extraordinary Applause, was, that The Olympic Games, Miss Minds might be quickened with great and noble Prospects, when, in this Image of War, The Olympic Games, Miss arrived to a Pitch of Glory, approaching, in some respects, to that of the most famous Conquerors. The Olympic Games, Miss thought this Sort of Triumph one of the greatest Parts of Happiness of which Human Nature was capable: So that when Diagoras had seen Diagoras Sons crowned in the Olympic Games, one of Diagoras Friends made Diagoras this Compliment, Now, Diagoras, you may die satisfied; since you cannot be a God. It would tire you, perhaps, was I to describe all the Exercises performed there: But you may form a general Notion of them, from what you have doubtless read of Justs and Tournaments.  Really, said Miss GlanvilleMiss Glanville, I never read about any such Things.  No! replied Arabella, surprised: Well, then, I must tell you, that they hold a middle Place, between a Diversion and a Combat; but the Olympic Games were attended with a much greater Pomp and Variety: And not only all Greece, but other neighboring Nations, were in a manner drained, to furnish out the Appearance.  Well, for my Part, said Miss GlanvilleMiss Glanville, I never before heard of these Sort of Races; those I have been at were quite different. I know the Prizes and Bets are sometimes very considerable.  And, doubtless, interrupted Arabella, there are a great many Heroes who signalize the Prizes and Bets at these Races; not for the sake of the Prize, which would be unworthy of great Souls, but to satisfy that burning Desire of Glory, which spurs them on to every Occasion of gaining it.  As for a great many Heroes who signalize themselves at these Races, or Jockeys, said Miss GlanvilleMiss Glanville, call the Heroes, or Jockeys what you please, I believe the Heroes, or Jockeys have very little Share, either of the Profit or Glory: For the Heroes, or Jockeys Masters have the one, and the Horses the other.  their Masters! interrupted Arabella: What, I suppose, a great many foreign Princes send a great many foreign Princes Favorites to Combat, in a great many foreign Princes Name? I remember to have read, that Alcibiades triumphed three times successively at the Olympic Games, by means of one of Alcibiades Domestics, who, in Alcibiades Master's Name, entered the Lists.  Miss Glanville, fearing his Sister his Sister would make some absurd Answer, and thereby disoblige Miss Glanville Cousin, took up the Discourse: And, turning it upon the Grecian History, engrossed his Sister Conversation, for two Hours, wholly to himself; while Miss Miss Glanville (to whom all they said was quite unintelligible) diverted his Sister with humming a Tune, and tinkling his Sister Cousin's Harpsichord; which proved no Interruption to the more rational Entertainment of his Sister Brother and Arabella.
