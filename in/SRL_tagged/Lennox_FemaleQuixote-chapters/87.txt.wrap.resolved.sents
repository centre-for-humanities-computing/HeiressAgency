In which Arabella meets with another admirable Adventure.
OUR lovely Heroine had not been above a Fortnight in London, before the gross Air of that smoaky Town affected OUR lovely Heroine Health so much, that Sir Charles proposed to OUR lovely Heroine to go for a few Weeks to Richmond, where Sir Charles hired a House elegantly furnished for OUR lovely Heroine Reception.
Miss Glanville had been too long out of that darling City, to pay OUR lovely Heroine the Compliment of attending OUR lovely Heroine constantly at Richmond; yet OUR lovely Heroine promised to be as often as possible with OUR lovely Heroine: And Sir Charles, having Affaris that could not dispense with Sir Charles Absence from town, placed Sir Charles Steward in OUR lovely Heroine House, being a Person whose Prudence and Fidelity Sir Charles could rely upon; and Sir Charles, with OUR lovely Heroine Women, and two or three other menial Servants, made up OUR lovely Heroine Equipage.
As it was not consistent with Decorum for Miss Glanville to reside in her House, Miss Glanville contented Miss Glanville with riding to Richmond generally every Day: And as long as Arabella was pleased with that Retirement, Miss Glanville resolved not to press Arabella Return to Town till the Countess of -- arrived, in whose Conversation Miss Glanville grounded all Miss Glanville Hopes of Arabella Cure.
At that Season of the Year Richmond not being quite deserted by Company, Arabella was visited by several Ladies of Fashion; who charmed with Arabella Affability, Politeness, and good Sense, were strangely perplexed how to account for some Peculiarities in Arabella Dress and Manner of thinking.
Some of the younger Sort from whom Arabella's extraordinary Beauty took away all Pretensions to Equality on that Score, made Some of the younger Sort from whom Arabella's extraordinary Beauty took away all Pretensions to Equality on that Score extremely merry with her Oddnesses, as Some of the younger Sort from whom Arabella's extraordinary Beauty took away all Pretensions to Equality on that Score called Some of the younger Sort from whom Arabella's extraordinary Beauty took away all Pretensions to Equality on that Score, and gave broad Intimations that her Head was not right.
As for Arabella, whose Taste was as delicate, Sentiments as refined, and Judgment as clear as any Person's could be who believed the Authenticity of Scudery's Romances, her was strangely disappointed to find no Lady with whom her could converse with any tolerable Pleasure: And that instead of Clelia's, Statira's Mandana's, etc.
her found only Miss Glanville among all her knew.
The Comparison her drew between such as these and the charming Countess of -- whom her had just begun to be acquainted with at Bath, increased her Regret for the Interruption that was given to so agreeable a Friendship: And it was with infinite Pleasure Mr. Glanville heard her repeatedly wish for the Arrival of that admirable Lady (as her always called her) in Town.
Not being able to relish that insipid Conversation of the young Ladies that visited her at Richmond, her chief Amusement was to walk in the Park there; which because of her chief Amusement Rural Privacy, was extremely agreeable to her Inclinations.
Here her indulged Contemplation, leaning on the Arm of her faithful Lucy, while her other Women walked at some Distance behind her, and two Men Servants kept her always in Sight.
One Evening when her was returning from her usual Walk, her heard the Sound of a Woman's Voice, which seemed to proceed from a Tuft of Trees that hid her from her View.
And stopping a Moment, distinguished some plaintive Accents, which increasing her Curiosity, her advanced toward the Place, telling her faithful Lucy, her was resolved if possible to discover who the distressed Lady was, and what was the Subject of her Affliction.
As her drew nearer with softly treading Steps, her could distinguish through the Branches of the Trees, now despoiled of great part of their Leaves, two Women seated on the Ground, two Women Backs toward her, and one of two Women with her Head gently reclined on the other's Shoulder, seemed by her mournful Action to be weeping; for her often put her Handkerchief to her Eyes, breathing every Time a Sigh, which, as Arabella phras'd it, seemed to proceed from the deepest Recesses of her Heart.
This Adventure, more worthy indeed to be styled an Adventure than all our Fair Heroine had ever yet met with, and so conformable to what Heroine had read in Romances, filled Heroine with eager Expectation.
Heroine made a Sign to Heroine to make no Noise, and creeping still closer toward the Place where this afflicted Person sat, Heroine heard Heroine distinctly utter these Words, which however were often interrupted with Heroine Sighs.
Ah!
Ariamenes, whom I to my Misfortune have too much loved, and whom to my Misfortune I fear I shall never sufficiently hate, since that Heaven and thy cruel Ingratitude has ordained that thou shall never be mine, and that so many sweet and dear Hopes are for ever taken from me, return me at least, ungrateful Man, return me those Testimonies of my innocent Affection, which were sometimes so dear and precious to thee.
Return me those Favors, which all innocent as they were, are become Criminal by thy Crime.
Return me, Cruel Man, return me those Relics of my Heart which thou detainest in Despite of me, and which, notwithstanding thy Infidelity, I cannot recover.
Here Heroine Tears interrupting Heroine Speech, Arabella being impatient to know the History of this afflicted Person, came softly round to the other Side, and showing Heroine, occasioned some Disturbance to the sad Unknown; who rising from Heroine Seat, with Heroine Face averted, as if ashamed of having so far disclosed Heroine Sorrows in a Stranger's Hearing, endeavored to pass by Heroine un-notic'd.
Arabella perceiving Arabella Design, stopped Arabella with a very graceful Action, and with a Voice all composed of Sweetness, earnestly conjured Arabella to relate Arabella History.
Think not, Lovely Unknown, said Arabella (for Arabella was really very pretty) that my Endeavors to detain you proceed from an indiscreet Curiosity.
It Is true, some Complaints which have fallen from your fair Mouth, have raised in me a Desire to be acquainted with your Adventures; but a Desire to be acquainted with your Adventures has a Desire to be acquainted with your Adventures Foundation in that Compassion your Complaints have filled me with: And if I wish to know your Misfortunes, it is only with a View of affording you some Consolation.
Pardon me, Madam, said the Fair Afflicted, gazing on Arabella with many Signs of Admiration, if my Confusion at being overheard in a Place I had chosen to bewail my Misfortunes, made me be guilty of some Appearance of Rudeness, not seeing the admirable Person I wanted to avoid.
But pursued Arabella, hesitating a little, those Characters of Beauty I behold in your Face, and the Gracefulness of your Deportment convincing me you can be of no ordinary Rank, I will the less scruple to acquaint you with my Adventures, and the Cause of those Complaints you have heard proceed from my Mouth.
Arabella assuring Arabella, that whatever Arabella Misfortunes were, Arabella might depend upon all the Assistance in Arabella Power, seated Arabella near Arabella at the Foot of the Tree where Arabella had been fitting, and giving Lucy Orders to join the rest of Arabella Women, and stay at a Distance till Arabella made a Sign to them to advance, Arabella prepared to listen to the Adventures of the Fair Unknown, who after some little Pause, began to relate them in this Manner.
