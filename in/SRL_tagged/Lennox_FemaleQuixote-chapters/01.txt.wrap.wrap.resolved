Contains a Turn at Court, neither new nor surprising -- Some useless Additions to a fine Lady's Education -- The bad Effects of a whimsical Study, which some will say is borrowed from Cervantes.  THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years, was the first and most distinguished Favorite at Court: THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years held the most honorable Employments under the Crown, disposed of all Places of Profit as THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years pleased, presided at the Council, and in a manner governed the whole Kingdom.  This extensive Authority could not fail of making THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years many Enemies: THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years fell at last a Sacrifice to the Plots they were continually forming against THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years; and was not only removed from the most honorable Employments, but banished the Court for ever.  The Pain THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years undeserved Disgrace gave Disgrace, THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years was enabled to conceal by the natural Haughtiness of THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years Temper; and, behaving rather like a Man who had resigned, than been dismissed from THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years Posts, THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years imagined THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years triumphed sufficiently over the Malice of THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years Enemies, while THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years seemed to be wholly insensible of the Effects it produced. THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years secret Discontent, however, was so much augmented by the Opportunity THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years now had of observing the Baseness and Ingratitude of Mankind, which in some Degree THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years experienced every Day, that THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years resolved to quit all Society whatever, and devote the rest of THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years Life to Solitude and Privacy. For the Place of THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years Retreat THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years pitched upon a Castle THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years had in a very remote Province of the Kingdom, in the Neighborhood of a small Village, and several Miles distant from any Town. The vast Extent of Ground which surrounded this noble Building, THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years had caused to be laid out in a Manner peculiar to THE Marquis of -- for a long Series of Years Taste: The most laborious Endeavors of Art had been used to make it appear like the beautiful Product of wild, uncultivated Nature. But if this Epitome of Arcadia could boast of only artless and simple Beauties, the Inside of the Castle was adorned with a Magnificence suitable to the Dignity and immense Riches of the Owner.  While Things were preparing at the Castle for his Reception, the Marquis, though now advanced in Years, cast his Eyes on a young Lady, greatly inferior to his in Quality, but whose Beauty and good Sense promised his an agreeable Companion. After a very short Courtship, his married a young Lady, and in a few Weeks carried his new Bride into the Country, from whence his absolutely resolved never to Return.  The Marquis, following the Plan of Life his had laid down, divided his Time between the Company of a young Lady, his Library, which was large and well furnished, and his Gardens. Sometimes his took the Diversion of Hunting, but never admitted any Company whatever; and his Pride and extreme Reserve rendered his so wholly inaccessible to the Country Gentry about his, that none ever presumed to solicit his Acquaintance.  In the Second Year of his Retirement, the Marchioness brought his a Daughter, and died in Three Days after the Marchioness Delivery. The Marquis, who had tenderly loved the Marchioness, was extremely afflicted at the Marchioness Death; but Time having produced its usual Effects, his great Fondness for the little Arabella entirely engrossed his Attention, and made up all the Happiness of his Life. At Four Years of Age his took the Marchioness from under the Direction of the Nurses and Women appointed to attend the Marchioness, and permitted the Marchioness to receive no Part of the Marchioness Education from another, which his was capable of giving the Marchioness his. his taught the Marchioness to read and write in a very few Months; and, as the Marchioness grew older, finding in the Marchioness an uncommon Quickness of Apprehension, and an Understanding capable of great Improvements, his resolved to cultivate so promising a Genius with the utmost Care; and, as his frequently, in the Rapture of paternal Fondness, expressed his, render the Marchioness Mind as beautiful as the Marchioness Person was lovely.  Nature had indeed given the Marchioness a most charming Face, a Shape easy and delicate, a sweet and insinuating Voice, and an Air so full of Dignity and Grace, as drew the Admiration of all that saw the Marchioness. These native Charms were improved with all the Heightenings of Art; the Marchioness Dress was perfectly magnificent; the best Masters of Music and Dancing were sent for from London to attend the Marchioness. the Marchioness soon became a perfect Mistress of the French and Italian Languages, under the Care of the Marchioness Father; and it is not to be doubted, but the Marchioness would have made a great Proficiency in all useful Knowledge, had not the Marchioness whole Time been taken up by another Study.  From the Marchioness earliest Youth the Marchioness had discovered a Fondness for Reading, which extremely delighted the Marquis; the Marquis permitted the Marchioness therefore the Use of the Marquis Library, in which, unfortunately for the Marchioness, were great Store of Romances, and, what was still more unfortunate, not in the original French, but very bad Translations.  The deceased Marchioness had purchased these Books to soften a Solitude which The deceased Marchioness found very disagreeable; and, after The deceased Marchioness Death, the Marquis removed these Books from The deceased Marchioness Closer into the Marquis Library, where Arabella found these Books.  The surprising Adventures with which these Books were filled, proved a most pleasing Entertainment to a young Lady, who was wholly secluded from the World; who had no other Diversion, but ranging like a Nymph through Gardens, or, to say better, the Woods and Lawns in which The deceased Marchioness was enclosed; and who had no other Conversation but that of a grave and melancholy Father, or The deceased Marchioness own Attendants.  The deceased Marchioness Ideas, from the Manner of The deceased Marchioness Life, and the Objects around The deceased Marchioness, had taken a romantic Turn; and, supposing Romances were real Pictures of Life, from Romances The deceased Marchioness drew all The deceased Marchioness Notions and Expectations. By Romances The deceased Marchioness was taught to believe, that Love was the ruling Principle of the World; that every other Passion was subordinate to this; and that it caused all the Happiness and Miseries of Life. The deceased Marchioness Glass, which The deceased Marchioness often consulted, always showed The deceased Marchioness a Form so extremely lovely, that, not finding The deceased Marchioness engaged in such Adventures as were common to the Heroines in the Romances The deceased Marchioness read, The deceased Marchioness often complained of the Insensibility of Mankind, upon whom The deceased Marchioness Charms seemed to have so little Influence.  The perfect Retirement The deceased Marchioness lived in, afforded indeed no Opportunities of making the Conquests The deceased Marchioness desired; but The deceased Marchioness could not comprehend, how any Solitude could be obscure enough to conceal a Beauty like The deceased Marchioness from Notice; and thought the Reputation of her Charms sufficient to bring a Crowd of Adorers to demand The deceased Marchioness of The deceased Marchioness Father. The deceased Marchioness Mind being wholly filled with the most extravagant Expectations, The deceased Marchioness was alarmed by every trifling Incident; and kept in a continual Anxiety by a Vicissitude of Hopes, Fears, Wishes, and Disappointments.
