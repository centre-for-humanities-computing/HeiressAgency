In which our Heroine is greatly disappointed.  MISS Glanville, supposing her Brother would be glad not to be interrupted in her Brother Conference with Lady Bella, did not allow any one to acquaint any one with Sir George's Visit; and, telling the Baronet her Cousin was indisposed, had, by these means, all the Baronet Conversation to her.  Sir George, who ardently wished to see Lady Bella, protracted Sir George, who ardently wished to see Lady Bella , in hopes that Sir George, who ardently wished to see Lady Bella should have that Satisfaction before Sir George, who ardently wished to see Lady Bella went away. And that fair Lady, whose Thoughts were a little discomposed by the Despair her apprehended MISS Glanville was in, and fearful of the Consequences, when her had sat some time after MISS Glanville left her, ruminating upon what had happened, quitted her Closet, to go and inquire of Miss Glanville, in what Condition MISS Glanville Mind seemed to be when MISS Glanville went away; for her never doubted but that MISS Glanville was gone, like Coriolanus, to seek out for some Occasion to manifest MISS Glanville Innocence.  Hearing, therefore, the Voice of that Lady, who was talking and laughing very loud in one of the Summer-parlours, and being terrified with the Apprehension, that it was her Brother with whom her was thus diverting her, her opened the Door of the Room precipitately; and, by her Entrance, filled Sir George with extreme Pleasure; while her unexpected Sight produced a quite contrary Effect on Miss Glanville.  Arabella, eased of Arabella Fear, that it was Mr. Glanville, who, instead of dying with Despair, was giving Occasion for that noisy Laugh of Occasion Sister, saluted the Baronet with great Civility; and, turning to Miss Glanville, I must needs chide you, said her, for the Insensibility with which it appears you have parted with your Brother.  Bless me, her, interrupted Miss GlanvilleMiss Glanville, what do you mean? Whither is your Brother gone?  That, indeed, I am quite ignorant of, resumed Arabella; and I suppose your Brother himself hardly knows what Course your Brother shall take: But your Brother has been with Arabella, doubtless, to take your Brother Leave.  Take his LeaveLeave! repeated Miss GlanvilleMiss Glanville: Has Miss Glanville left the Castle so suddenly then, and gone away without Miss Glanville?  The Enterprise upon which Miss Glanville is gone, said Arabella, would not admit of a Lady's Company: And, since Miss Glanville has left so considerable an Hostage with Miss Glanville as Arabella, I expect Miss Glanville will not be long before Miss Glanville return; and, I hope, to the Satisfaction of us both.  Miss Glanville, who could not penetrate into the Meaning of her Cousin's Words, began to be strangely alarmed: But, presently, supposing her had a mind to divert her with her Fears, her recovered her, and told her her would go up to her Brother's Chamber, and look for her Brother's Chamber.  Arabella did not offer to prevent Arabella, being very desirous of knowing, whether Arabella had not left a Letter for Arabella upon Arabella Table, as was the Custom in those Cases: And, while Arabella was gone, Sir George seized the Opportunity of saying an hundred gallant Things to Arabella, which Arabella received with great Indifference; the most extravagant Compliments being what Arabella expected from all Men: And, provided all Men did not directly presume to tell Arabella all Men loved Arabella, no Sort of Flattery or Adulation could displease Arabella.  In the mean time, Miss Glanville, having found her Brother in her Brother's Chamber, repeated to her Brother what Arabella had said, as Arabella supposed, to fright Arabella.  Mr. Glanville, hearing this, and that Sir George was with Arabella, hastened to Mr. Glanville, hearing this, and that Sir George was with her as fast as possible, that Sir George might interrupt the foolish Stories Sir George did not doubt Arabella was telling.  Upon Miss Glanville's Appearance with her Brother, Arabella was astonished.  I apprehended, Sir, said Arabella, that you were some Miles from the Castle by this time: But your Delay and Indifference convince me, you neither expect nor wish to find the means of being justified in my Opinion.  Pray, Cousin, interrupted Glanville (speaking softly to Arabella), let us leave this Dispute to some other time.  No, Sir, resumed Arabella, aloud, my Honor is concerned in your Justification: Nor is it fit I should submit to have the Appearance of Amity for a Person who has not yet sufficiently cleared my Honor of a Crime, with too much Reason laid to my Honor Charge. Did Coriolanus, think you, act in this manner? Ah! if my Honor had, doubtless, Cleopatra would never have pardoned my Honor: Nor will I any longer suffer you to give me repeated Causes of Discontent.  Sir George, seeing Confusion in Mr. Glanville's Countenance, and Rage in Arabella's, began to think, that what Sir George had at first took for a Jest, was a serious Quarrel between them, at which it was not proper Sir George should be present; and was preparing to go: When Arabella, stopping Sir George with a graceful Action --  If, noble Stranger, said --  , you are so partial to the Failings of a Friend, that you will undertake to defend any unjustifiable Action he may be guilty of, you are at Liberty to depart: But, if you will promise to be an unprejudiced Hearer of the Dispute between Mr. Glanville and Madam, you shall know the Adventure which has given Rise to it; and will be Judge of the Reasonableness of the Commands I have laid on he.  Though, Madam, said Sir George (bowing very low to Madam), Mr. Glanville is my Friend, yet there is no Likelihood I shall espouse Mr. Glanville Interest against yours: And a very strong Prepossession I feel in Favor of yours, already persuades me, that I shall give Sentence on your Side, since you have honored me so far, as to constitute me Judge of this Difference.  The solemn Manner in which Sir George (who began to suspect Lady Bella's peculiar Turn) spoke this, pleased Lady Bella's infinitely; while Mr. Glanville, vexed as Mr. Glanville was, could hardly forbear laughing: When Arabella, after a Look of Approbation to Sir George, replied;  I find I have unwillingly engaged Mr. Glanville to more than I first intended: For, to enable you to judge clearly of the Matter in Dispute, it is necessary you should know my whole History.  Mr. Glanville, at this Word, not being able to constrain Mr. Glanville, uttered a Groan, of the same Nature with those which are often heard in the Pit at the Representation of a new Play. Sir George understood Sir George perfectly well; yet seemed surprised: And Arabella, starting up,  Since, said Arabella, I have given you no new Cause of Complaint, pray, from whence proceeds this Increase of Affliction?  I assure you, Cousin, answered Cousin, my Affliction, if you please to term it so, increases every Day; and I believe it will make me mad at last: For this unaccountable Humor of yours is not to be borne.  You do not seem, replied Arabella, to be far from Madness already: And if your Friend here, upon hearing the Passages between us, should pronounce you guilty, I shall be at a Loss, whether I ought to treat you as a Madman, or a Criminal. Sir George, added Arabella, turning to Sir George, you will excuse me, if, for certain Reasons, I can neither give you my History myself, nor be present at the Relation of it: One of my Women, who is most in my Confidence, shall acquaint you with all the Particulars of Mr. Glanville: After which I expect Mr. Glanville will abide by your Decision, as, I assure Sir George, I shall be contented to do.  Saying this, Sir George went out of the Parlour, in order to prepare Lucy for the Recital Sir George was to make.  Mr. Glanville, resolving not to be present at this new Absurdity, ran out after Sir George; and went into the Garden, with a strong Inclination to hate the lovely Visionary who gave Mr. Glanville such perpetual Uneasiness; leaving Mr. Glanville Sister alone with the Baronet, who diverted his Sister extremely with the Thoughts of hearing his Sister Cousin's History; assuring the Baronet, that Mr. Glanville might expect something very curious in it, and find Matter sufficient to laugh at; for his Sister was the most whimsical Sir George in the World.  Sir George, who resolved to profit by the Knowledge of his Sister Foible, made very little Reply to Miss Glanville's Sneers; but waited patiently for the promised History, which was much longer coming than Mr. Glanville imagined.
