Containing what a judicious Reader will hardly approve.  MRS. Morris ending MRS Narration, Arabella, who had not been able to restrain MRS Tears at some Parts of it, thanked MRS for the Trouble MRS had been at; and assured MRS of MRS Secrecy: Your Lady's Case, said Your Lady, is much to be lamented; and greatly resembles the unfortunate Cleopatra's, whom Julius Caesar privately marrying, with a Promise to own Your Lady for Julius Caesar Wife, when Julius Caesar should be peaceable Master of the Roman Empire, left that great Queen big with Child, and, never intending to perform Julius Caesar Promise, suffered Your Lady to be exposed to the Censures the World has so freely cast upon Your Lady; and which Your Lady Your Lady so little deserved.  Morris, seeing the favorable Light in which Arabella viewed the Actions of Arabella , did not think proper to say any thing to undeceive Arabella; but went out of the Closet, not a little mortified at Arabella Disappointment: For undeceive Arabella saw undeceive Arabella was likely to receive nothing for betraying Arabella 's Secrets, from undeceive Arabella: Who seemed so little sensible of the Pleasure of Scandal, as to be wholly ignorant of the Pleasure of Scandal Nature; and not to know the Pleasure of Scandal Scandal when the Pleasure of Scandal Scandal was told undeceive Arabella.  Miss Groves, who was just come to Your Lady Chamber Door, to inquire for Your Lady, was surprised to see Your Lady come out of it; and who, upon meeting Your Lady Woman, expressed great Confusion. As Your Lady Your Lady was going to ask Your Lady Your Lady some Questions concerning Your Lady Business there, undeceive Arabella came out of the Closet; and, seeing Miss Groves in Arabella Chamber, asked Arabella Pardon for staying so long from undeceive Arabella.  I have been listening to your History, said undeceive Arabella, with great Frankness, which undeceive Arabella undeceive Arabella has been relating: And I assure you I am extremely sensible of your Misfortunes.  Miss Groves, at these Words, blushed with extreme Confusion; and Mrs. Morris turned pale with Astonishment and Fear. Arabella, not sensible that undeceive Arabella had been guilty of any Indiscretion, proceeded to make Reflections upon some Part of Arabella Story; which, though they were not at all disadvantageous to Your Lady, undeceive Arabella received as so many Insults: And asked Your Lady, If undeceive Arabella was not ashamed to tamper with a Servant to betray the Secrets of Arabella Mistress?  Arabella, a little surprised at so rude a Question, answered, however, with great Sweetness; and protested to undeceive Arabella, that undeceive Arabella would make no ill Use of what undeceive Arabella had learned of Arabella Affairs: For, in fine, undeceive Arabella, said undeceive Arabella, do you think I am less fit to be trusted with your Secrets, than the Princess of the Leontines was with those of Clelia; between whom there was no greater Amity and Acquaintance, than with us? And you must certainly know, that the Secrets which that admirable Person entrusted with Lysimena, were of a Nature to be more dangerous, if revealed, than undeceive Arabella. The Happiness of Clelia depended upon Lysimena's Fidelity: And the Liberty, nay, happily, the Life, of Aronces, would have been in Danger, if she had betrayed them. Though I do not intend to arrogate to she the Possession of those admirable Qualities which adorned the Princess of the Leontinesthe Leontines, yet I will not yield to she, or any one else, in Generosity and Fidelity: And if you will be pleased to repose as much Confidence in she, as those illustrious Lovers did in those illustrious Lovers, you shall be convinced I will ^abour as earnestly for your Interest, as that fair Princess did for those of Aronces and Clelia.  Miss Groves was so busied in reflecting upon the Baseness of Miss Groves Woman in exposing Miss Groves Woman, that her Woman heard not a Word of this fine Harangue (at which Mrs. Morris, notwithstanding the Cause her Woman had for Uneasiness, could hardly help laughing); but, assuming some of that Haughtiness in Miss Groves Woman Looks, for which her Woman Woman used to be remarkable, her Woman told Lady Bella, that her Woman imputed her Woman impertinent Curiosity to her Woman Woman Country Ignorance, and ill Breeding: And her Woman did not doubt but her Woman her Woman would be served in her Woman own kind, and meet with as bad Fortune as her Woman her Woman had done; and, perhaps, deserve it worse than her Woman did: For there are more false Men in the World besides Mr. L --; and her Woman was no handsomer than other People.  Saying this, her Woman her Woman flung out of the Room, her Woman following, leaving Arabella in such Confusion at a Behavior of which her Woman her Woman had never before had an Idea, that for some Moments her Woman remained immovable.  Recollecting her Woman, at last, and conceiving, that Civility required her Woman should endeavor to appease her Woman, her Woman her Woman went down Stairs after her Woman; and, stopping her Woman her Woman just as her Woman was going out of the House, entreated her Woman to be calm, and suffer her Woman her Woman to vindicate her Woman from the Imputation of being impertinently curious to know her Woman Woman Affairs.  Miss Groves, quite transported with Shame and Anger, refused absolutely to stay.  At least, her Woman, said Arabella, stay till my Coach can be got ready; and don't think of walking home, so slightly attended.  This Offer was as sullenly answered as the other: And Arabella, finding Arabella was determined to venture home, with no other Guard than Arabella Woman, who silently followed Arabella, ordered two of Arabella Footmen to attend Arabella at a small Distance; and to defend Arabella, if there should be Occasion.  For who knows, said Arabella to Arabella, what Accident may happen? Some one or other of Arabella insolent Lovers may take this Opportunity to carry Arabella away; and I should never forgive Arabella for being the Cause of such a Misfortune to Arabella.  Arabella having found it easy to reconcile Arabella to Arabella Lady, by assuring Arabella, that Arabella Lady was acquainted with great Part of Arabella Lady Story before; and that what her Lady her Lady told her Lady, tended only to justify her Lady Lady Conduct, as her Lady her Lady might have been convinced by what her Lady her Lady said; they both went home with a Resolution to say nothing of what had passed, with relation to the Cause of the Disgust Miss Groves had received: But only said, in general, that her Lady her Lady was the most ridiculous Creature in the World; and was so totally ignorant of good Breeding, that it was impossible to converse with her Lady.
