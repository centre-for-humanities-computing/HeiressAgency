Which concludes with an authentic Piece of History.  ARABELLA, during the rest of this Journey, was so wholly taken up in contemplating upon the last Adventure, that ARABELLA mixed but little in the Conversation. Upon she mixed but little in the Conversation drawing near Bath, the Situation of that City afforded ARABELLA the Means of making a Comparison between the Valley in which it was placed (with the Amphitheatrical View of the Hills around it) and the Valley of Tempe.  'Twas in such a Place as this, said ARABELLA, pursuing ARABELLA Comparison, that the fair Andronice delivered the valiant Hortensius: And really I could wish, our Entrance into that City that City might be preceded by an Act of equal Humanity with that of that fair Princess.  For the Gratification of that Wish, Madam, sid Mr. Glanville, it is necessary some Person should meet with a Misfortune, out of which you might be able to relieve a Misfortune; but I suppose the Benevolence of your Disposition may be equally satisfied with not finding any Occasion, as of exercising it, when it is found.  Though it be not my Fortune to meet with those Occasions, replied Arabella, there is no Reason to doubt but others do, who possibly have less Inclination to afford others Assistance than myself: And it is possible, if any other than the Princess of Messina had happened to pass by, when Hortensius was in the Hands of the Thessalians, Hortensius would not have been rescued from the ignominious Death Hortensius was destined to, merely for killing a Stork.  How! interrupted Sir Charles, put a Man to Death for killing a Stork! Ridiculous! Pray, in what Part of the World did that happen? Among the Indians of America, I suppose.  No, Sir, said Arabella, in Thessaly; the fairest Part in all Macedonia, famous for the beautiful Valley of Tempe, which excited the Curiosity of all Travelers whatever.  No, not all, Madam, returned Sir Charles* for I am acquainted with several Travelers, who never saw it, nor even mentioned it; and if it is so famous as you say, I am surprised I never heard of it before.  I don't know, said Arabella, what those Travelers thought worthy of those Travelers Notice; but I am certain, that if any Chance should conduct me into Macedonia, I would not leave it till I saw the Valley of Tempe, so celebrated by all the Poets and Historians.  Dear Cousin, cried Glanville, who could hardly forbear smiling, what Chance, in the Name of Wonder, should take you into Macedonia, at so great a Distance from your own Country?  And so, said Sir Charles, this famous Valley of Tempe is in Turkey. Why you must be very fond of traveling, indeed, Lady Bella, if you would go into the Great Mogul's Country, where the People are all Pagans, the People say, and worship the Devil.  The Country my Cousin speaks of, said Mr. Glanville, is in the Grand Signor's Dominions: the Great Mogul, you know, Sir --  Well, interrupted Sir Charles, the Great Mogul, or the Grand Signor, I know not what you call the Great Mogul: But I hope my Niece does not propose to go thither.  Not unless I am forcibly carried thither, said Arabella; but I do determine, if that Misfortune should ever happen to Arabella, that I would, if possible, visit the Vale of Tempe, which is in that Part of Greece they call Macedonia.  Then I am persuaded, replied Sir Charles, you will never see that famous this famous Valley of Tempe you talk of; for it is not very likely you should be forcibly carried away into Turkey.  And why do you think it unlikely, that I should be carried thither? interrupted Arabella. Do not the same Things happen now, that did formerly? And is any thing more common, then Ladies being carried, by Ladies Ravishers, into Countries far distant from Ladies own? May not the same Accidents happen to Arabella, that have happened to so many illustrious Ladies before Arabella? And may I not be carried into Macedonia by a Similitude of Destiny with that of a great many beautiful Princesses, who, though born in the most distant Quarters of the World, chanced to meet at one time in the City of Alexandria, and related their miraculous Adventures to each other?  And it was for that very Purpose their met, Madam, said Mr. Glanville, smiling.  Why, truly, said Arabella, it happened very luckily for each of their, that their were brought into a Place where their found so many illustrious Companions in Misfortune, to whom their might freely communicate their Adventures, which otherwise might, happily, have been concealed, or, at least, have been imperfectly delivered down to us: However, added Arabella, smiling, if I am carried into Macedonia, and by that means have an Opportunity of visiting the famous Vale of Tempe, I shall take care not to draw the Resentment of the Thessalians upon Arabella, by an Indiscretion like that of Hortensius.  For be pleased to know, Arabella, said Arabella, addressing Arabella to Arabella Uncle, that her Uncle killing a Stork, however inconsiderable a Matter it may appear to us, was yet looked upon as a Crime of a very atrocious Nature among the Thessalians; for they have a Law, which forbids, upon Pain of Death, the killing of Storks; the Reason for which is, that Thessaly being subject to be infested with a prodigious Multitude of Serpents, which are a delightful Food to these Sorts of Fowls, these Sorts of Fowls look upon these Sorts of Fowls as sacred Birds, sent by the Gods to deliver these Sorts of Fowls from these Serpents and Vipers: And though Hortensius, being a Stranger, was pardoned through the Intercession of the Princess Andronice, they made the Princess Andronice promise to send another Stork into Thessaly, to the end that the Princess Andronice might be reputed innocent.
