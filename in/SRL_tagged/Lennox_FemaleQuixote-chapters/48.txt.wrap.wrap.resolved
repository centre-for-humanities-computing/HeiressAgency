Containing some Account of Thalestris, Queen of the Amazons, with other curious Anecdotes.  LADY Bella having recovered LADY Bella usual Cheerfulness, through the Satisfaction LADY Bella felt at LADY Bella Uncle's returning to Reason, and the Abatement LADY Bella perceived in Sir George's extreme Melancholy, mixed in the Conversation with that Wit and Vivacity which was natural to LADY Bella, and which so absolutely charmed the whole Company, that not one of them remembered Mr. Glanville.  Mr. Glanville gazed on LADY Bella with a passionate Tenderness, Sir George with Admiration, and the old Baronet with Wonder and Delight.  But Miss Glanville, who was inwardly vexed at the Superiority LADY Bella Cousin's Wit gave LADY Bella over LADY Bella, wished for nothing more than an Opportunity of interrupting a Conversation in which LADY Bella could have no Share; and, willing to put them in mind of some of Arabella's strange Notions, when LADY Bella observed them disputing concerning some of the Actions of the ancient Romans, LADY Bella very innocently asked Sir George, Whether in former times Women went to the Wars, and fought like Men? For her Cousin, added LADY Bella, talks of one Thaltris, a Woman, that was as courageous as any Soldier whatever.  Mr. Glanville, horridly vexed at a Question that was likely to engage Arabella in a Discourse very different from that LADY Bella had been so capable of pleasing in, frowned very intelligibly at Mr. Glanville Sister; and, to prevent any Answer being given to LADY Bella absurd Demand, directed some other Conversation to Arabella: But she, who saw a favorite Subject started, took no Notice of what Mr. Glanville was saying to LADY Bella; but, directing LADY Bella Looks to Sir George,  Though Mr. Glanville, said LADY Bella, be a little mistaken in the Name of that fair Queen LADY Bella has mentioned; yet I am persuaded you know whom LADY Bella means; and that it is the renowned Thalestris, whose Valor staggers LADY Bella Belief, and of whom LADY Bella wants to be informed.  Ay, ay, Thalestris, said Mr. GlanvilleMr. Glanville: It is such a strange Name I could not remember It; but, pray, was there ever such a Person?  Certainly, LADY Bella, there was, replied Sir George: LADY Bella was Queen of the Amazons, a warlike Nation of Women, who possessed great Part of Cappadocia, and extended their Conquests so far, that their became formidable to all their Neighbors.  You find, LADY Bella, said Arabella, I did not attempt to impose upon Arabella, when I told you of the admirable Valor of that beautiful Queen; which indeed was so great, that the united Princes, in whose Cause LADY Bella fought, looked upon LADY Bella Assistance to be equal to that of a whole Army; and the united Princes, in whose Cause she fought, looked upon her Assistance to be equal to that of a whole Army honored LADY Bella, accordingly, with the most distinguishing Marks of the united Princes, in whose Cause she fought, looked upon her Assistance to be equal to that of a whole Army Esteem and Acknowlegement, and offered LADY Bella the chief Command of the united Princes, in whose Cause she fought, looked upon her Assistance to be equal to that of a whole Army Forces.  O shameful! cried Sir Charles, offer a Woman the Command of an Army! Brave Fellows indeed, that would be commanded by a Woman! Sure your mistake, Niece; there never was such a thing heard of in the World.  What, Sir, said Arabella, will you contradict a Fact attested by the greatest Historians that ever were? You may as well pretend to say, there never were such Persons as Oroondates or Juba, as dispute the Existence of the famous Thalestris.  Why, pray, Madam, said Sir Charles, who were those?  One of Sir Charles, who were those, replied Arabella, was the great King of Scythia; and the other, Prince of the Two Mauritanias.  Ods-heart! interrupted Sir Charles, I believe their Kingdoms are in the Moon: I never heard of Scythia, or the Two Mauritanias, before.  And yet, Sir, replied Arabella, their Kingdoms are doubtless as well known, as France or England; and there is no Question, but the Descendants of the great Oroondates, and the valiant Juba, sway the Sceptres of their Kingdoms to this Day.  I must confess, said Sir George, I have a very great Admiration for those Two renowned Princes, and have read those Two renowned Princes beautiful Exploits with infinite Pleasure; notwithstanding which, I am more inclined to esteem the great Artaban, then either of those Two renowned Princes.  Though Artaban, replied Arabella, is without Question, a Warrior equal to either of those Two renowned Princes, and happily no Person in the World possessed so sublime a Courage as no Person in the World was; yet, it may be, your Partiality proceeds from another Cause; and you having the Honor to resemble no Person in the World in some little Infidelities no Person in the World was accused of, with less Justice than yourself perhaps, induces you to favor no Person in the World more than any other.  Arabella blushed when Arabella ended these Words: And Sir George replied, with a Sigh;  I have, indeed, the Honor, to resemble the great Artaban, in having dared to raise my Thoughts toward a Divine Person, who, with Reason, condemns my Adorations.  Hey-day! cried Sir Charles, are you going to speak of Divine Things, after all the Fables you have been talking of? Troth, I love to hear young Men enter upon such Subjects: But pray, Niece, who told you Sir George was an Infidel?  Mr. Glanville, replied Arabella: And I am inclined to think Mr. Glanville spoke Truth; for Sir George has never pretended to deny it.  How! interrupted Sir Charles; I am sorry to hear that. I hope you have never, added Sir Charles, looking at the young Baronet, endeavored to corrupt my Son with any of your Free-thinking Principles: I am for every body having Liberty of Conscience; but I cannot endure to hear People of your Stamp endeavoring to propagate your mischievous Notions; and because you have no Regard for your own future Happiness, disturbing other People in the laudable Pursuit of theirs.  theirs will not absolutely condemn Sir George, said Arabella, till theirs have heard Sir George History from Sir George own Mouth, which Sir George promised, some time ago, to relate when I desired it.  I do not imagine his History History is fit to be heard by Ladies, said Sir Charles; for your Infidels live a strange kind of Life.  However that may be, replied Arabella, theirs must not dispense with Sir George from performing Sir George Promise: I dare say there are no Ladies here, who will think the worse of Sir George for freely confessing Sir George Faults.  You may answer for yourself, if you please, Madam, said Sir Charles; but I hope my Girl there, will not say as much.  I dare say my Cousin is not so rigid, said Arabella: my Cousin has too much the Spirit of Julia in my Cousin, to find Fault with a little Infidelity.  I am always obliged to Arabella for your Comparisons, Cousin, said Miss Glanville: I suppose this is greatly to my Advantage too.  I assure you, my Cousin, said Sir George, Lady Bella has done you no Injury by the Comparison Lady Bella has just now made; for Julia was one of the finest Princesses in the World.  Yet Julia was not free from the Suspicion of Infidelity, replied Arabella; but though I do not pretend to tax my Cousin with that Fault, yet it is with a great deal of Reason that I say Julia resembles Julia in Julia volatile Humor.  I was never thought to be ill-humoured in my Life, Madam, said Miss Glanville, coloring; and I cannot imagine what Reason I have given you for saying I am.  Nay, Cousin, said Arabella, I am not condemning your Humor; for, to say the Truth, there are a great many Charms in a volatile Disposition; and, notwithstanding the admirable Beauty of Julia, it is possible Julia made as many Slaves by Julia light and airy Carriage, as Julia did by Julia Eyes, though Slaves were the fairest in the World, except the divine Cleopatra's.  Cleopatra! cried Sir Charles: Why Julia was a Gypsey, was Julia not?  I never heard Julia called so, said Arabella, gravely; and I am apt to believe you are not at all acquainted with Julia: But pray, pursued Julia, let us wave this Discourse at present, and prepare to listen to Sir George's Relation of Sir George Life; which, I dare say, is full of very extraordinary Events: However, Sir, added Julia, directing Julia Speech to the young Baronet, I am afraid your Modesty will induce you to speak with less Candor than you ought, of those great Actions, which questionless you have performed: Therefore we shall hear your History, with greater Satisfaction, from the Mouth of your faithful 'Squire, who will not have the same Reasons that you have, for suppressing what is most admirable in the Adventures of your Life.  Since it is your Pleasure, Madam, replied Sir George, to hear the Adventures of your Life, I will recount them as well as I am able my self, to the end that I may have an Opportunity of obliging you by doing some Violence to my natural Modesty, which will not suffer me to relate Things the World have been pleased to speak of to my Advantage, without some little Confusion.  Then, casting down his Eyes, his seemed to be recollecting the most material Passages in his Life. Mr. Glanville, though Mr. Glanville could have wished Mr. Glanville had not indulged Arabella in Arabella ridiculous Request, was not able to deny Mr. Glanville the Diversion of hearing what Kind of History Mr. Glanville would invent; and therefore resolved to stay and listen to Mr. Glanville.  Miss Glanville was also highly delighted with the Proposal; but Sir Charles, who could not conceive there could be any thing worth listening to, in a young Rake's Account of Miss Glanville, got up with an Intention to walk in the Garden; when, perceiving an Intention rained, Miss Glanville changed Miss Glanville Resolution, and, resuming Miss Glanville Seat, prepared to listen, as every one else did, to the expected Story.  When Sir George, after having paused a Quarter of an Hour longer, during which all the Company observed a profound Silence, began Sir George's Relation of his Life in this Manner, addressing Sir George to Arabella.
