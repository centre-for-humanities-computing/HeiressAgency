In which the Adventure goes on after the accustomed Manner.
ARABELLA, in the mean time, was wholly taken up with the Adventure, as ARABELLA called it, at Church: The Person and Dress of the Gentleman who had so particularly gazed on ARABELLA there, was so different from what ARABELLA had been accustomed to see, that ARABELLA immediately concluded, he was of some distinguished Rank.
It was past a Doubt, ARABELLA thought, that he was excessively in Love with ARABELLA; and as ARABELLA soon expected to have some very extraordinary Proofs of he Passion, ARABELLA Thoughts were wholly employed on the Manner in which ARABELLA should receive them.
As soon as ARABELLA came home, and had paid ARABELLA Duty to the Marquis, ARABELLA hurried to ARABELLA Chamber, to be at Liberty to indulge ARABELLA agreeable Reflections; and, after the Example of ARABELLA Heroines, when any thing extraordinary happened to the Example of her Heroines, called ARABELLA favorite Woman; or, to use ARABELLA own Language, her, in whom ARABELLA confided ARABELLA most secret Thoughts.
Well, Lucy, said ARABELLA, did you observe that Stranger who eyed us her Heroines always speak of her Heroines in the Plural Number.
so heedfully Today at Church?
ARABELLA, notwithstanding ARABELLA Country-Simplicity, knew a Compliment was expected from ARABELLA on this Occasion; and therefore replied, That ARABELLA did not wonder at the Gentleman's staring at ARABELLA; for ARABELLA was sure he had never seen any body so handsome as ARABELLA Ladyship before.
I have not all the Beauty you attribute to me, said Arabella, smiling a little: And, with a very moderate Share of it, I might well fix the Attention of a Person who seemed to be not overmuch pleased with the Objects about he: However, pursued ARABELLA, assuming a more serious Air, if this Stranger be weak enough to entertain any Sentiments more than indifferent for me; I charge you, upon Pain of my Displeasure, do not be accessory to the Conveying he presumptuous Thoughts to me either by Letters or Messages; nor suffer he to corrupt your Fidelity with the Presents he will very probably offer you.
Lucy, to whom this Speech first gave a Hint of what ARABELLA ought to expect from ARABELLA Lady's Lovers, finding ARABELLA of more Importance than ARABELLA imagined, was so pleased at the Prospect which opened to ARABELLA, that it was with some Hesitation ARABELLA promised to obey ARABELLA Orders.
Arabella, however, was satisfied with ARABELLA Assurances of observing ARABELLA Directions; and dismissed ARABELLA from ARABELLA Presence, not without an Apprehension of being too well obeyed.
A whole Week being elapsed without meeting with the Importunities ARABELLA expected, ARABELLA could hardly conceal ARABELLA Surprise at so mortifying a Disappointment; and frequently interrogated Lucy, concerning any Attempts the Stranger had made on ARABELLA Fidelity; but the Answers ARABELLA received, only increased ARABELLA Discontent, as Fidelity convinced ARABELLA, ARABELLA Charms had not had the Effect her Charms imagined.
Mr. Hervey, however, had been all this time employed in thinking of some Means to get acquainted with the Marquis; for, being possessed with an extraordinary Opinion of Mr. Hervey Wit, and personal Accomplishments, Mr. Hervey did not fear making some Impression on the Heart of the young Lady; provided Mr. Hervey could have an Opportunity of conversing with the young Lady.
Mr. Hervey Cousin's Advice was continually in Mr. Hervey Mind, and flattered Mr. Hervey Vanity with the most agreeable Hopes: But the Marquis's Fondness for Solitude, and that Haughtiness which was natural to Mr. Hervey, rendered Mr. Hervey so difficult of Access, that Mr. Hervey, from the Intelligence Mr. Hervey received of Mr. Hervey Humor, despaired of being able to prosecute Mr. Hervey Scheme; when, meeting with a young Farmer in one of Mr. Hervey Evening-Walks, and entering into Conversation with Mr. Hervey upon several Country Subjects, the Discourse at last turned upon the Marquis of -- whose fine House and Gardens were within whose fine House and Gardens View; upon which the young Fellow informed Mr. Hervey, Mr. Hervey was Brother to a young Woman that attended the Lady Arabella; and, being fond of lengthening out the Conversation with so fine a Gentleman, gave Mr. Hervey, without being desired, the domestic History of the whole Family, as Mr. Hervey had received it from Lucy, who was the Sister Mr. Hervey mentioned.
Hervey, excessively delighted at this accidental Meeting with a Person so capable of serving Person Defign, affected a great Desire of being better acquainted with Person; and, under Pretense of acquiring some Knowledge in rural Affairs, accustomed Person to call so often at William's Farm, that at last Person met with the Person whom the Hopes of seeing had so often carried Person thither.
Lucy, the Moment Lucy saw Person enter, knowing Person again, blushed at the Remembrance of the Discourse which had passed between Lucy Lady and Lucy concerning Person; and was not at all surprised at the Endeavors Person used to speak to Lucy apart: But, as soon as Person began a Conversation concerning Arabella, Lucy interrupted Person by saying, I know, Sir, that you are distractedly in Love with Lady; but Lady has forbid me to receive any Letters or Messages from you; and therefore I beg you will not offer to bribe me; for I dare not disobey Lady.
Mr. Hervey was at first so astonished at Lady Speech, that Mr. Hervey knew not what to think of it; but, after a little Reflection, attributing to an Excess of awkward Cunning what, in Reality, was an Effect of Lady Simplicity, Mr. Hervey resolved to make use of the Hint Lady had given Mr. Hervey; and, presenting Lady with a Couple of Guineas, entreated Lady to venture displeasing Lady Lady, by bearing a Letter from Mr. Hervey; promising to reward Lady better, if Lady succeeded.
Lady made some Difficulty to comply; but, not being able absolutely to refuse the first Bribe that ever was offered to Lady, Lady, after some Entreaties, consented to take a Letter from him; and, receiving the Money he presented Lady, left he at Liberty to write, after Lady had got Lady Brother to furnish he with Materials for that Purpose.
