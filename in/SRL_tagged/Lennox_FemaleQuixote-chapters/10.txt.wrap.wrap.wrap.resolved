Contains several Incidents, in which the Reader is expected to be extremely interested.  ARABELLA had spent some Hours in ARABELLA Closet, revolving a thousand different Stratagems to escape from the Misfortune that threatened ARABELLA, when ARABELLA was interrupted by Lucy, who, after desiring Admittance, informed ARABELLA, that the Marquis, having rode out to take the Air Mr. Glanville Evening, had fallen from his Horse and received some Hurt; that his was gone to Bed, and desired to see ARABELLA.  ARABELLA, hearing ARABELLA Father was indisposed, ran to his, excessively alarmed; and reflecting on the Resolution ARABELLA had just before taken, of leaving him, which aggravated ARABELLA Concern, ARABELLA came to his Bedside with ARABELLA Eyes swiming in Tears. Mr. Glanville was sitting near Mr. Glanville; but, rising at ARABELLA Appearance to give ARABELLA Mr. Glanville Chair, which ARABELLA accepted without taking any Notice of Mr. Glanville, Mr. Glanville stood at some Distance contemplating ARABELLA Face, to which Sorrow had given so many Charms, that Mr. Glanville gazed on ARABELLA with an Eagerness and Delight that could not escape ARABELLA Observation.  ARABELLA blushed excessively at the passionate Looks Mr. Glanville gave ARABELLA; and, finding the Marquis's Indisposition not considerable enough to oblige ARABELLA to a constant Attendance at Mr. Glanville Bedside, ARABELLA took the first Opportunity of returning to ARABELLA Chamber; but, as ARABELLA was going out, Glanville presented Glanville Hand to lead ARABELLA up Stairs: Which ARABELLA scornfully refusing;  Sure, Cousin, said Cousin, a little piqued, you are not disposed to carry on your ill-natured Jest any further?  If you imagined I jested with Cousin, said Arabella, I am rather to accuse the Slowness of your Understanding, for your persisting in treating me thus freely, than the Insolence I first imputed it to: But, whatever is the Cause of it, I now tell you again, that you have extremely offended me; and, if my Father's Illness did not set Bounds to my Resentment at present, I would make you know, that I would not suffer the Injury you do me, so patiently.  Since you would have me to believe you are serious, replied Glanville, be pleased to let me know what Offense it is you complain of; for I protest I am quite at a Loss to understand you.  Was it not enough, resumed Arabella, to affront me with an insolent Declaration of your Passion, but you must also, in Contempt of my Commands to the contrary, appear before Sir again, pursue me to my Chamber, and use the most brutal Menaces to Sir?  Hold, pray, Sir, interrupted Glanville, and suffer me to ask you, If it is my Presumption, in declaring Sir your Admirer, that you are so extremely offended at?  Doubtless it is, Sir, answered Arabella; and such a Presumption, as, without the aggravating Circumstances you have since added to it, is sufficient to make me always your Enemy.  I beg Pardon, returned Glanville gravely, for that Offense; and also, for staying any longer in a House, which you have, so genteelly, turned me out of.  My Pardon, Mr. Glanville, resumed she, is not so easily gained: Time, and your Repentance, may, indeed, do much toward obtaining it.  Saying this, she made a Sign to Glanville to retire; for Glanville had walked up with she to she Chamber: But, finding Glanville did not obey she, for really Glanville was quite unacquainted with these Sorts of dumb Commands, she hastily retired to she Closet, lest Glanville should attempt to move she Pity, by any Expressions of Despair for the cruel Banishment she had doomed Glanville to.  Glanville, seeing she had shut she up in her Closet, left her Chamber, and retired to Glanville own, more confounded than ever at the Behavior of Glanville Cousin.  she bidding his Cousin so peremptorily to leave the House, would have equally persuaded his Cousin of she Ignorance and Ill-breeding, had not the Elegance of she Manners, in every other respect, proved the contrary: Nor was it possible to doubt she had a great Share of Understanding; since she Conversation, singular as some of she Sentiments seemed to his Cousin, was far superior to most other Ladies. Therefore, his Cousin concluded, the Affront his Cousin had received, proceeded from she Disdain to admit the Addresses of any Person, whose Quality was inferior to she; which, probably, was increased to some particular Dislike she had to his Cousin Person.  his Cousin Honor would not permit his Cousin to make Use of that Advantage she Father's Authority could give his Cousin; and, wholly engrossed by his Cousin Resentment of the Usage his Cousin had received from she, his Cousin resolved to set out for London the next Day without seeing the Marquis, from whom his Cousin was apprehensive of some Endeavors to detain his Cousin.  Having taken this Resolution, his Cousin ordered his Cousin Servant to have the Horses ready early in the Morning; and, without taking any Notice of his Cousin Intention, his Cousin left the Castle, riding, as fast as possible, to the next Stage, from whence his Cousin wrote to his Cousin Uncle; and, dispatching a Messenger with his Cousin Letter, held on his Cousin Way to London.  The Marquis, being pretty well recovered from The Marquis Indisposition by a good Night's Rest, sent for Mr. Glanville in the Morning, to walk with Mr. Glanville, as was Mr. Glanville Custom, in the Garden; but, hearing Mr. Glanville had rode out, though Mr. Glanville imagined it was only to take the Air, yet Mr. Glanville could not help accusing Mr. Glanville, in Mr. Glanville own Thoughts, of a little Neglect; for which Mr. Glanville resolved to chide Mr. Glanville, when Mr. Glanville returned: But Mr. Glanville long Stay filling Mr. Glanville with some Surprise, Mr. Glanville was beginning to express Mr. Glanville Fears that something had befallen Mr. Glanville, to Arabella, who was then with Mr. Glanville; when a Servant presented Mr. Glanville the Letter, which Mr. Glanville's Messenger had that Moment brought.  The Marquis casting The Marquis Eyes on the Direction, and knowing The Marquis Nephew's Hand, Bless me, cried The Marquis, extremely surprised, What can this mean? Bella, added The Marquis, here is a Letter from your Cousin.  Arabella, at these Words, started up; and, preventing Arabella Father, with a respectful Action, from opening it, I beseech you, her Father, said Arabella, before you read a Letter from your Cousin, suffer me to assure you, that, if you read this Letter contains any thing fatal, I am not at all accessory to you read this Letter: It Is true I have banished your Cousin, as a Punishment for the Offense your Cousin was guilty of toward me; but, Heaven is my Witness, I did not design his Death; and if your Cousin has taken any violent Resolution against your Cousin, your Cousin has greatly exceeded my Commands.  The Marquis, whose Surprise was considerably increased by these Words, hastily broke open the Letter, which she perceiving, hurried out of the Room; and, locking she up in she Closet, began to bewail the Effect of she Charms, as if she was perfectly assured of she 's Death.  The Marquis, however, who, from Bella Exclamation, had prepared your Cousin for the Knowledge of some very extraordinary Accident, was less surprised, than your Cousin would otherwise have been, at the Contents; which were as follow:  her Father, AS my leaving the House so abruptly will certainly make me appear guilty of a most unpardonable Rudeness, I cannot dispense with her Father from acquainting your Lordship with the Cause; though, to spare the Reproaches Lady Bella will probably cast on her Father for doing so, I could wish you knew the Reproaches Lady Bella by any other Means.  But, her Father, I value your Esteem too much to hazard the Loss of it by suffering you to imagine, that I am capable of doing any thing to displease you. Lady Bella was pleased to order me to stay no longer in the House; and menaced me with some very terrible Usage, if I disobeyed Lady Bella: Lady Bella used so many other contemptuous Expressions to her Father, that, I am persuaded, I shall never be so happy as to possess the Honor you designed for,  My Lord, Your most obedient, etc. Charles Glanville.   When The Marquis had read a Letter from your Cousin, The Marquis went to The Marquis Daughter's Apartment with an Intention to chide his Daughter's Apartment severely for his Daughter's Apartment Usage of his Nephew; but, seeing his Daughter's Apartment come to meet his Nephew with his Daughter's Apartment Eyes bathed in Tears, his Nephew insensibly lost some Part of his Nephew Resentment.  Alas! her Father, said his Daughter's Apartment, I know you come prepared to load me with Reproaches, upon my Cousin's Account; but, I beseech your Lordship, do not aggravate my Sorrows: Though I banished Mr. Glanville, I did not desire Mr. Glanville Death; and, questionless, if Mr. Glanville knew how I resent it, Mr. Glanville Ghost would be satisfied with the Sacrifice I make his Ghost.  The Marquis, not being able to help smiling at this Conceit, which Mr. Glanville saw had so strongly possessed his Daughter's Apartment Imagination, that his Daughter's Apartment had no sort of Doubt but that his Daughter's Apartment his Cousin was dead, asked his Daughter's Apartment, If his Daughter's Apartment really believed Mr. Glanville loved his Daughter's Apartment well enough to die with Grief at his Daughter's Apartment ill Usage of Mr. Glanville?  If, said his Daughter's Apartment, Mr. Glanville loves me not well enough to die for his Daughter's Apartment, Mr. Glanville certainly loves me but little; and I am the less obliged to Mr. Glanville.  But I desire to know, interrupted The Marquis, For what Crime it was you took the Liberty to banish Mr. Glanville from the House?  I banished Mr. Glanville, her Father, resumed the House, for That Presumption in telling me Mr. Glanville loved me.  That Presumption, as you call That Presumption, though I know not for what Reason, said The Marquis, was authorized by his Daughter's Apartment: Therefore, know, Lady Bella, that I not only permit Mr. Glanville to love you, but I also expect you should endeavor to return Mr. Glanville Affection; and look upon Mr. Glanville as the Man whom I design for your Husband: There Is Mr. Glanville , pursued Mr. Glanville, putting it into her Hand. I blush for the Rudeness you have been guilty of; but endeavor to repair it, by a more obliging Behavior for the future: I am going to send after Mr. Glanville immediately to prevail upon to return: Therefore, write Mr. Glanville an Apology, I charge you; and have it done by the Time my Messenger is ready to set out.  Saying this, Mr. Glanville went out of the Room; and Arabella eagerly opened a Letter from your Cousin; and, finding a Letter from your Cousin in a Style so different from what Arabella expected, Arabella Dislike of Mr. Glanville returned with more Violence than ever.  Ah! the Traitor! said Arabella aloud, Is it thus that the Traitor endeavors to move my Compassion? How greatly did I over-rate the Traitor Affection, when I imagined the Traitor Despair was capable of killing the Traitor? Disloyal Man! pursued Arabella, walking about, Is it by Complaints to her Father that thou expectest to succeed? And do thou imagine the Heart of Arabella is to be won by Violence and Injustice?  In this manner Arabella wasted the Time allotted for Arabella to write; and, when The Marquis sent for Arabella , having no Intention to comply, Arabella went to The Marquis Chamber, conjuring The Marquis not to oblige Arabella to a Condescension so unworthy of Arabella.  The Marquis, being now excessively angry with Arabella, rose up in a Fury, and, leading Arabella to The Marquis Writing-Desk, ordered Arabella, instantly, to write to Arabella .  If I must write, my Lord, said Arabella, sobbing, pray be so good as to dictate what I must say.  Apologize for your rude Behavior, said The Marquis; and desire The Marquis, in the most obliging manner you can, to return.  Arabella, seeing there was a necessity for obeying, took up the Pen, and wrote the following Billet:  The unfortunate Arabella, to the most ungenerous Mr. Glanville. IT is not by the Power I have over Arabella, that I command you to return, for I disclaim any Empire over so unworthy a Subject; but, since it is my Father's Pleasure I should invite you back, I must let you know, that I repeal your Banishment, and expect you will immediately return with the Messenger who brings this; however, to spare your Acknowlegements, know, that it is in Obedience to her Father's absolute Commands, that you receive this Mandate from  ArabellaHaving finished the following Billet, Arabella gave the following Billet to The Marquis to read; who, finding a great deal of The Marquis own Haughtiness of Temper in the following Billet, could not resolve to check Arabella for a Disposition so like The Marquis own: Yet The Marquis told Arabella, Arabella Style was very uncommon: And pray, added The Marquis, smiling, who taught you to superscribe your Letters thus, Arabella, to the most ungenerous Glanville? Why, Lady Bella, this Superscription is wholly calculated for the Bearer's Information: But come, alter this Superscription immediately; for I don't choose my Messenger Messenger should know, that you are unfortunate, or that his Nephew is ungenerous.  Pray, her Father, replied Arabella, content Arabella with what I have already done in Obedience to your Commands, and suffer my Letter to remain as my Letter is: Methinks it is but reasonable I should express some little Resentment at the Complaint my Cousin has been pleased to make to Arabella against me; nor can I possibly make my Letter more obliging, without being guilty of an unpardonable Meanness.  You are a strange Arabella, replied The Marquis, taking my Letter, and enclosing my Letter in one from The Marquis; in which The Marquis earnestly entreated his Nephew to return, threatening his Nephew with his Nephew Displeasure, if his Nephew disobeyed; and assuring his Nephew, that his Daughter his Daughter would receive his Nephew as well as his Nephew could possibly desire.  Messenger Messenger being dispatched, with Orders to ride Post, and overtake the young Gentleman, his Nephew obeyed his Nephew Orders so well, that his Nephew came up with his Nephew at --, where his Nephew intended to lodge that Night.  Mr. Glanville, who expected his Nephew Uncle would make use of some Methods to recall his Uncle, opened his Uncle without any great Emotion; but seeing another enclosed, his Uncle Heart leaped to his Uncle Mouth, not doubting but it was a Letter from Arabella; but the Contents surprised his Uncle so much, that his Uncle hardly knew whether his Uncle ought to look upon them as an Invitation to return, or a new Affront, her Words were so distant and haughty. this Superscription being much the same with a Billet his Uncle had received from her in the Garden, which had made his Uncle conclude her in Jest, his Uncle knew not what to think of this Superscription: One would swear this dear Girl's Head is turned, said his Uncle to his Uncle, if her had not more Wit than her whole Sex besides.  After reading a Letter from Arabella several times, his Uncle at last opened his Uncle's; and, seeing the pressing Instances his Uncle made his Uncle to return, his Uncle resolved to obey; and the next Morning set out for the Castle.  Arabella, during the time Arabella his Cousin was expected, appeared so melancholy and reserved, that The Marquis The Marquis was extremely uneasy: You have never, said his Uncle to Arabella, disobeyed me in any one Action of your Life; and I may with reason expect you will conform to my Will in the Choice I have made of a Husband for Arabella, since it is impossible to make any Objection either to his Uncle Person or Mind; and, being the Son of my Sister, his Uncle is certainly not unworthy of Arabella, though his Uncle has not a Title.  My first Wish, my Lord, replied Arabella, is to live single, not being desirous of entering into any Engagement which may hinder my Solicitude and Cares, and lessen my Attendance, upon the best of Fathers, who, till now, has always most tenderly complied with my Inclinations in every thing: But if it is your absolute Command, that I should marry, give me not to one who, though he has the Honor to be allied to Arabella, has neither merited your Esteem, or my Favor, by any Action worthy of he Birth, or the Passion he pretends to have for me; for, in fine, my Lord, by what Services has he deserved the Distinction with which you honor he? Has he ever delivered you from any considerable Danger? Has he saved your Life, and hazarded he own, for Arabella, upon any Occasion whatever? Has he merited my Esteem, by he Sufferings, Fidelity, and Respect; or, by any great and generous Action, given me a Testimony of he Love, which should oblige me to reward he with my Affection? Ah! her Father, I beseech you, think not so unworthily of your Daughter, as to bestow your Daughter upon one who has done so little to deserve your Daughter: If my Happiness be dear to you, do not precipitate me into a State from whence you cannot recall me, with a Person whom I can never affect.  your Daughter would have gone on, but The Marquis The Marquis interrupted your Daughter sternly: I Will hear no more, said The Marquis, of your foolish and ridiculous Objections; What Stuff is this you talk of? What Service am I to expect from his Nephew? And by what Sufferings is he to merit your Esteem? Assure yourself, Arabella, continued he, that I will never pardon you, if you presume to treat his Nephew in the Manner you have done: I perceive you have no real Objection to make to his Nephew; therefore I expect you will endeavor to obey me without Reluctance; for, since you seem to be so little acquainted with what will most conduce to your own Happiness, you must not think it strange, if I insist upon directing your Choice in the most important Business of your Life.  Arabella was going to reply; but The Marquis The Marquis ordered Arabella to be silent; and Arabella went to Arabella own Apartment in so much Affliction, that Arabella thought Arabella Misfortunes were not exceeded by any Arabella had ever read.
