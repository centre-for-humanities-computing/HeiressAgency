Containing an Incident full as probable as any in Scudery's Romances.  Sydimiris, To Bellmour. IF that Proof of my Gratitude, which I promised to give you, fall short of your Expectations; blame not the Defect of my Will, but the Rigor of my Destiny: It was by this only Way I could give you Liberty; nor is It too dearly bought by the Loss of all my Happiness, if you receive It as you ought: Had I been allowed to follow my own Inclinations, there is no Man in the World I would have preferred to yourself. I owe this Confession to the Remembrance of your Affection, of which you gave me so generous an Instance; and the Use I expect you will make of It, is, to console you under a Misfortune, which is common to us both; though I happily have most Reason to complain, since I could not be just to you, without being cruel at the same time, or confer a Benefit, without loading you with a Misfortune. If the Sacrifice I have made of myself for your sake, gives me any Claim to the Continuance of your Love, I command you, by the Power the Power gives me over you, to live, and not add to the Miseries of my Condition, the Grief of being the Cause of your Death. Remember, I will look upon your Disobedience, as an Act of the most cruel Ingratitude; and your Compliance with this Request shall ever be esteemed, as the dearest Mark you can give of that Passion you have borne to the unfortunate  Sydimiris.   Ah! Sydimiris, cried I, having read this Letter, more cruel in your Kindness than Severity! After having deprived me of you, do you forbid me to die; and expose me by so rigorous a Command to Ills infinitely more hard and painful than Death?  Yes, pursued I, after a little Pause; yes, Sydimiris, thou shall be obeyed; we will not dye, since thou have commanded we to live; and, notwithstanding the Tortures to which thou condemnest we, we will obey Command; and give thee a glorious Proof of we present Submission, by enduring that Life, which the Loss of thee has rendered truly wretched.  Urinoe and Toxares, somewhat reassured, by the Resolution I had taken, exhorted me by all the Persuasions, Friendship could put in all the Persuasions Mouths, to persevere in it; and, Urinoe bidding me Farewell, I endeavored to prevail upon Urinoe to procure me a Sight of Sydimiris once more, or at least to bear a Letter from me to Urinoe; but Urinoe refused both these Requests so obstinately, telling me, Sydimiris would neither consent to the one nor the other, that I was obliged to be contented with the Promise Urinoe made me, to represent my Affliction in a true Light to Urinoe Mistress; and to assure her Mistress, that nothing but Urinoe absolute Commands could have hindered me from dying. Then, taking leave of me with much Tenderness, Urinoe went out of tbe Prison, leaving Toxares with me, who assisted me to dress, and conducted me out of that miserable Place, where I had passed so many sad, and also joyful Hours. At a Gate to which he brought me, I found a Horse waiting; and, having embraced this faithful Confidant, with many Expressions of Gratitude, I bestowed a Ring of some Value upon this faithful Confidant to remember me by; and, mounting Horse, with a breaking Heart, I took the first Road which presented itself to my Eyes, and galloped away, without knowing whither I went. I rode the whole Night, so totally engrossed by my Despair, that I did not perceive Horse Horse was so tired, Horse could hardly carry me a Step farther: At last the poor Beast fell down under me, so that I was obliged to dismount; and, looking about me, perceived I was in a Forest, without seeing the least Appearance of any Habitation.  The Wilderness, and Solitude of the Place, flattered my Despair, and while Horse Horse was feeding upon what Grass Horse could find, I wandered about: The Morning just breaking, gave me Light enough to direct my Steps. Chance at last conducted me to a Cave, which seemed to have been the Residence of some Hermit, or unfortunate Lover like me. It was dug at the Side of a Rock, the Entrance to It thick set with Bushes, which hid It from View. I descended by a few my Steps cut rudely enough, and was convinced, It had formerly served for a Habitation for some religious or melancholy Person; for there were Seats of Turf raised on each Side of It, a kind of Bed composed of dried Leaves and Rushes, and a Hole made artificially at the Top, to admit Light.  While I considered this Place attentively, I all at once took up a Resolution, inspired by my Despair; which was, to continue there, and indulge my Melancholy in a Retirement so fitted for my Purpose.  Giving my Horse therefore Liberty to go where my Horse pleased, and hanging up my Arms upon a Tree near my Cave, I took Possession of this solitary Mansion, with a gloomy Kind of Satisfaction, and devoted all my Hours to the Contemplation of my Misfortunes.  I lived in this manner, Madam, for Ten Months, without feeling the least Desire to change my Habitation; and, during all that time, no Mortal approached my Solitude, so that I lived perfectly secure and undiscovered.  Sir George pausing here to take Breath, the old Baronet said what will be found in the following Chapter.
