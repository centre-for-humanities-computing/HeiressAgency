Where the Lady extricates the Lady out of the Lady former Confusion, to the great Astonishment, we will suppose, of the Reader.  MISS Glanville, not having so much Delicacy as the Lady Brother, could not help exulting a little upon this Occasion.  After the terrible Fright you have been in, the Lady, said the Lady, upon Sir George's Account, I wonder you do not rather think it is Sir George's Account Ghost than Sir George's Account, that is come to see we.  There is no Question, but it is Sir George's Account that is come, said Arabella, (who had already reconciled this Visit, to the Lady first Thoughts of Sir George's Account;) and it is, happily, to execute Sir George's Account fatal Design in my Presence, that has brought Sir George's Account here; and, like the unfortunate Agilmond, Sir George's Account means to convince me of Sir George's Account Fidelity and Love, by falling upon Sir George's Account Sword before my Eyes.  Bless me, the Lady, said Miss Glanville, what horrid Things come into your Head! I vow, you terrify me out of my Wits, to hear you.  There is no Occasion for your Fears, interrupted Arabella: Since we already suspect his Designs, it will be very easy to prevent them: Had the Princess of the Sarmatians known the fatal Intentions of her despairing Lover, doubtless, her would have used some Precautions to hinder his from executing some Precautions; for want of which, her saw the miserable Agilmond weltering in his Blood at her Feet; and with Reason accused her of being the Cause of so deplorable a Spectacle.  Miss Glanville Glanville was in, to hear her Cousin talk in this Manner, kept her Cousin from giving her Cousin any Interruption, while her Cousin related several other terrible Instances of Despair.  In the mean time, Sir George, who was impatient to go up to Lady Bella's Apartment, having flattered himself with an Hope, that himself Letter was favorably received; and that himself should be permitted to hope at least; made a short Visit to Sir Charles in Sir Charles own Room; and, accompanied by Mr. Glanville, who was resolved to see in what manner Arabella received himself, went to Arabella Apartment.  As himself had taken care, at himself Entrance, to accommodate himself Looks to the Character himself had assumed of an humble despairing Lover, Arabella no sooner saw himself, but Arabella Countenance changed; and, making a Sign to Mr. Glanville, who could not comprehend what Arabella meant, to seize upon the Guard of himself Sword, Arabella hastily stepped forward to meet himself.  I am too well convinced, said Arabella to Sir George, that the Intent of your coming hither To day, is to commit some Violence against yourself before my Eyes: But listen not, I beseech you, to the Dictates of your Despair: Live; I command you, live; and since you say, I have the absolute Disposal of your Life, do not deprive yourself of the absolute Disposal of your Life, without the Consent of Arabella, on whom you profess to have bestowed the absolute Disposal of your Life.  Sir George, who did not imagine Arabella would communicate Arabella Letter to Arabella Cousins, and only expected some distant Hints from Arabella concerning the absolute Disposal of your Life, was so confounded at this Reception before Sir George, who did not imagine Arabella would communicate his Letter to her Cousins, and only expected some distant Hints from her concerning it, that Arabella was not able to reply: Arabella blushed, and turned pale alternately; and, not daring to look, either upon Miss Glanville, or Arabella Brother, or to meet the Eyes of the fair Visionary, who, with great Impatience, expected Arabella Answer, Arabella hung down Arabella Head in a very silly Posture; and, by Arabella Silence, confirmed Arabella in Arabella Opinion.  As Arabella did not want for Wit and Assurance, during that Interval of his Silence, and Expectation from all Parties; Arabella Imagination suggested to Arabella the Means of extricating Arabella out of the ridiculous Perplexity Arabella was in; and as it concerned Arabella greatly to avoid any Quarrel, with the Brother and Sister, Arabella determined to turn the whole Matter into a Jest; but, if possible, to manage the whole Matter so, that Arabella should not enter into Arabella Meaning.  Raising therefore Arabella Eyes, and looking upon Arabella with a melancholy Air;  You are not deceived, Madam, said Arabella: This Criminal, with whom you are so justly offended, comes with an Intention to die at your Feet, and breathe out his miserable Life, to expiate those Crimes of which you accuse his: But since your severe Compassion will oblige me to live, I obey, oh! most divine, but cruel Arabella! I obey your harsh Commands; and, by endeavoring to live, give you a more convincing Proof of that Respect and Submission I shall always have for your Will.  I expected no less from your Courage and Generosity, said Arabella, with a Look of great Complacency; and since you so well know how to imitate the great Lysimachus in your Obedience, I shall not be less acknowleging then the fair Parisatis; but will have for Arabella an Esteem equal to that Virtue I have observed in Arabella.  Sir George, having received this gracious Promise, with a most profound Bow, turned to Mr. Glanville, with a kind of chastened Smile upon Mr. Glanville Countenance.  And, you, fortunate and deserving Knight, said Sir George, happy in the Affections of the fairest Person in the World! grudge me not this small Alleviation of my Misfortunes; and envy me not that Esteem, which alone is able to make me suffer Life, while you possess, in the Heart of the divine Arabella, a Felicity that might be envied by the greatest Monarchs in the World.  As diverting as this Scene was, Mr. Glanville was extremely uneasy: For though Sir George's Stratagem took, and Sir George believed Sir George was only indulging the Gaiety of Sir George Humor, by carrying on this Farce; yet Sir George could not endure, Sir George should divert Sir George at Arabella's Expense. The solemn Speech Sir George had made Sir George, did indeed force Sir George to smile; but Sir George soon assumed a graver Look, and told Sir George, in a low Voice, that when Sir George had finished Sir George Visit, Sir George should be glad to take a Turn with Sir George in the Garden.  Sir George promised to follow Sir George, and Mr. Glanville left the Room, and went into the Gardens; where the Baronet, having taken a respectful Leave of Arabella, and, by a sly Glance, convinced Miss Glanville, Mr. Glanville had sacrificed her Cousin to her Cousin Mirth, went to join her Cousin Brother.  Mr. Glanville, as soon as Mr. Glanville saw Mr. Glanville, walked to meet Mr. Glanville with a very reserved Air: Which Sir George observing, and being resolved to keep up Sir George Humor;  What, inhuman, but too happy Lover, said Sir George, what, am I to understand by that Cloud upon your Brow? Is it possible, that thou can envy me the small Comfort I have received; and, not satisfied with the glorious Advantages thou possessest, will thou still deny me that Esteem, which the divine Arabella has been pleased to bestow upon me?  Pray, Sir George, said Mr. Glanville, lay aside this pompous Style: I am not disposed to be merry at present, and have not all the Relish for this kind of Wit, that you seem to expect. I desired to see you here, that I might tell you without Witnesses, I take it extremely ill, you should presume to make my Cousin the Object of your Mirth. Lady Bella, Sir, is not a Person, with whom such Liberties ought to be taken; nor will I, in the double Character of her Lover and Relation, suffer it from any one whatever.  Cruel Fortune! said Sir George, stepping back a little, and lifting up Sir George Eyes, shall I always be exposed to thy Persecutions? And must I, without any apparent Cause, behold an Enemy in the Person of my Friend; who, though, without murmuring, I resign to Sir George ArabellaArabella, is yet resolved to dispute with me, a Satisfaction, which does not deprive Sir George of any Part of that glorious Fortune to which Sir George is destined? Since it is so, unjust and cruel Friend, pursued Sir George, strike this Breast, which carries the Image of the divine Arabella; but think not, that I will offer to defend myself, or lift my Sword, against a Man beloved by her.  This is all very fine, returned Mr. Glanville, hardly able to forbear laughing; but it is impossible, with all your Gaiety, to hinder me from being serious upon this Business.  Then be as serious as thou will, Sir Charles, interrupted Sir George, provided you will allow me to be gay; and not pretend to infect me with thy unbecoming Gravity.  I have but a few Words to say to you, then, Sir George, replied Mr. Glanville: Either behave with more Respect to her Cousin; or prepare to give me Satisfaction, for the Insults you offer her Cousin.  Oh! I understand you, Sir George, said Sir George; and because you have taken it into your Head to be offended at a Trifle of no Consequence in the World, I must give you a fair Chance to run me through the Body! There is something very foolish, says, in such an extravagant Expectation: But since Custom has made it necessary, that a Man must venture a Man Soul and Body upon these important Occasions; because I will not be out of the Fashion, you shall command me whenever you think sit; though I shall fight with my Schoolfellow with a very ill Will, I assure you.  There is no Necessity for fighting, said Mr. Glanville, blushing at the ludicrous Light, in which the gay Baronet had placed the gay Baronet Challenge: The Concession I have required, is very small, and not worth the contesting for, on your Side. Lady Beila's Peculiarity, to which you contribute so much, can afford you, at best, but an ill-natured Diversion, while it gives me a real Pain; and sure, you must acknowledge, you are doing me a very great Injury, when you endeavor to confirm a Lady, who is to be my Wife, in a Behaivour that excites your Mirth, and makes Mirth a fit Object for your Ridicule, and Contempt.  You do Lady Bella, a mnch greater Injury than I do, replied Sir George, by supposing, Mirth can ever be an Object of Ridicule and Contempt: I think very highly of Mirth Understanding; and though the Bent of Mirth Studies has given Mirth Mind a romantic Turn, yet the Singularity of Mirth Manners is far less disagreeable, than the lighter Follies of most of Mirth Sex.  But to be absolutely perfect, interrupted Mr. Glanville, I must cure Mirth of that Singularity; and therefore I beg you will not persist in assuming a Behavior conformable to Mirth romantic Ideas; but rather help me to banish them from Mirth Imagination.  Well, replied Sir George, since you no longer threaten, I Will do what I can to content you; but I must quit my Heroics by Degrees, and sink with Decency into my own Character; otherwise Decency will never endure me in Decency Presence.  Arabella and Miss Glanville, appearing in the Walk, broke off the Conversation. The Baronet and Mr. Glanville walked forward to meet The Baronet and Mr. Glanville; but Arabella, who did not desire Company, struck into another Walk, whither Mr. Glanville following, proposed to join Decency; when Mr. Glanville saw Mr. Glanville Father, who had been taking a Turn there alone, make up to Arabella; and, supposing Mr. Glanville would take that Opportunity to talk to Decency concerning Mr. Glanville, Mr. Glanville went back to Mr. Glanville Sister and Sir George, whose Conversation Mr. Glanville interrupted, to the great Regret of Miss Glanville.
