Definition of Love and Beauty.
-- The necessary Qualities of a Hero and Heroine.
THOUGH, replied Mr. Glanville, you are very severe in the Treatment you think it necessary our Sex should receive from yours; yet I wish some of our Town Beauties were, if not altogether of your Opinion, yet sufficiently so, as to make it not a Slavery for a Man to be in some of our Town Beauties Company; for unless one talks of Love to these fair Conquets the whole time one is with some of our Town Beauties, some of our Town Beauties are quite displeased, and look upon a Man who can think any thing, but some of our Town Beauties, worthy a Man who can think any thing Thoughts or Observation, with the utmost Contempt.
How often have you and I, Sir George, pursued a Man who can think any thing, pitied the Condition of the few Men of Sense, who are sometimes among the Crowd of Beaux, who attend the Two Sister Beauties to all Places of polite Diversion in Town?
For those Ladies think it a mortal Injury done to those Ladies Charms, if the Men about those Ladies have Eyes or Ears for any Object but those Ladies Faces, or any Sound but that of those Ladies Voices: So that the Connoisseurs in Music, who attend those Ladies to Ranelagh, must stop those Ladies Ears, like Ulysses, when the Siren Frasi sings; and the Wits, who gallant those Ladies to the Side box, must lay a much greater Constraint upon those Ladies, in order to resist the Soul-moving Garrick; and appear insensible, while he is upon the Stage.
Upon my Soul, added Sir George (forgetting the Character Sir George assumed) when I have seen some Persons of my Acquaintance talking to the eldest of these Ladies, while one of Congreve's Comedies has been acting; one of Congreve's Comedies has been acting Face quite turned from the Stage, and some Persons of my Acquaintance overspread with an eternal Smile; some Persons of my Acquaintance fine Eyes sometimes lifted up in a beautiful Surprise, and a little enchanting Giggle half-hid with some Persons of my Acquaintance Fan* in spite of their Inattention, I have been ready to imagine, one of Congreve's Comedies has been acting was entertaining some Persons of my Acquaintance with Remarks upon the Play, which some Persons of my Acquaintance was judicious enough to understand; and yet I have afterward been informed by one of Congreve's Comedies has been acting, that nothing was less in their Thoughts; and all that Variety in some Persons of my Acquaintance Face, and that extreme seeming Earnestness in one of Congreve's Comedies has been acting Discourse, was occasioned by the most trifling Subjects imaginable: one of Congreve's Comedies has been acting perhaps had been telling some Persons of my Acquaintance, how the Sight of some Persons of my Acquaintance Squirrel, which peeped out of some Persons of my Acquaintance Pocket, surprised some Ladies some Persons of my Acquaintance was visiting; and what some Ladies she was visiting said upon some Persons of my Acquaintance Pondness for her Pondness, when some Persons of my Acquaintance was gone; blaming some Ladies she was visiting at the same time for some Ladies she was visiting want of Delicacy, in not knowing how to set a right Value upon such pleasing Animals: Hence proceeded some Persons of my Acquaintance Smiles, the lifting up of some Persons of my Acquaintance Eyes, the half-stifled Laugh, and all the pretty Gestures that appeared so wonderfully charming to all those who did not hear their Discourse: And it is upon such Trifies as these, or else on the inexhaustible Subject of these Charms, that all who are ambitious of being near these Miracles, are under a Necessity of talking.
And pray, interrupted Arabella, What Subjects afford Matter for a more pleasing Variety of Conversation, than those of Beauty and Love?
Can we speak of any Object so capable of delighting as Beauty, or of any Passion of the Mind more sublime and pleasing than Love?
With Submission, Madam, said Glanville, I conceive, all that can be said, either of Beauty, or of Love, may be comprised in a very few Words: All who have Eyes, and behold true Beauty, will be ready to confess it is a very pleasing Object; and all that can be said of it, may be said in very few Words; for when we have run over the Catalogue of Charms, and mentioned fine Eyes, fine Hair, delicate Complexion, regular Features, and an elegant Shape, we can only add a few Epithets more, such as Lovely, Dangerous, Enchanting, Inresistible, and the like; and every thing that can be said of Beauty is exhausted.
And so likewise it is with Love; we know that Admiration precedes it, that Beauty kindles it, Hope keeps it alive, and Despair puts an End to it; and that Subject may be as soon discussed as the other, by the judicious Use of proper Words; such as Wounds, Darts, Fires, Languishings, Dyings, Torture, Rack, Jealousy, and a few more of no Signification, but upon th^s Subject.
Certainly, Sir, said Arabella, you have not well considered what you say, since you maintain, that Love and Beauty are Subjects easily and quickly discussed: Take the Pains, I beseech you, to reflect a little upon those numerous and long Conversations, which these Subjects have given Rise to in Clelia, and the Grand Cyrus, where the most illustrious and greatest Personages in the World manage the Disputes; and the agreeable Diversity of the most illustrious and greatest Personages in the World Sentiments on those Heads affords a most pleasing and rational Entertainment: You will there find, that the greatest Conquerors, and Heroes of invincible Valor, reason with the most exact and scrupulous Nicety upon Love and Beauty; the Superiority of fair and brown Hair controverted by Warriors, with as much Eagerness as the most illustrious and greatest Personages in the World dispute for Victory in the Field; and the different Effects of that Passion upon different Hearts defined with the utmost Accuracy and Eloquence.
I must own, interrupted Sir Charles, I should have but a mean Opinion of those Warriors, as you call them, who could busy them in talking of such Trifles; and be apt to imagine such insignificant Fellows, who could wrangle about the Color of them Mistresses Hair, would be the first to turn them Backs upon the Enemy in Battle.
Is it possible, Sir, resumed Arabella, glowing with Indignation, that you can entertain such unworthy Thoughts of Heroes, who merit the Admiration and Praise of all Ages for their inestimable Valor, whom the Spears of a whole Army opposed to each of their single Swords would not oblige to fly?
What think you, Sir, pursued she, looking at Sir George, of the injurious Words my Uncle has uttered against those heroic Princes, whose Courage, I believe, you are as well acquainted with as my Uncle?
The great Oroondates, the invincible Artaban, the valiant and fortunate Artamenes, the irresistible Juba, the incomparable Cleomedon, and an hundred other Heroes I could name, are all injured by this unjust Assertion of my Uncle; since certainly they were not more famous for they noble and wonderful Actions in War, than for the Sublimity and Constancy of they Affections in Love.
Some of these Heroes you have named, replied Sir George, had the Misfortune, even in Some of these Heroes you have named Lives, to be very cruelly vilified: The great Oroondates was a long time accused of Treachery to The great Oroondates Divine Princess; the valiant and unfortunate Artamenes was suspected of Inconstancy; and the irresistible Juba reproached with Infidelity and Baseness, by both his Mistress and Friend.
I never knew you was so well acquainted with these Persons, interrupted Mr. Glanville; and I fansy it is but very lately that you have given yourself the Trouble to read Romances.
I am not of your Opinion, said Arabella.
Sir George, questionless, has appropriated great Part of Sir George Time to the Perusal of those Books, so capable of improving Sir George in all useful Knowledge; the Sublimity of Love, and the Quintessence of Valor; which Two Qualities, if possessed in a superlative Degree, form a true and perfect Hero, as the Perfection of Beauty, Wit, and Virtue, make a Heroine worthy to be served by such an illustrious Personage; and I dare say, Sir George has profited so much by the great Examples of Fidelity and Courage Sir George has placed before Sir George Eyes, that no Consideration whatever could make Sir George for one Moment fail in Sir George Constancy to the Divine Beauty Sir George adores; and, inspired by her Charms, Sir George would scorn to turn Sir George Back, as my Uncle my Uncle phrases it, upon an Army of an hundred thousand Men.
I am extremely obliged to Madam, Madam, said Sir George, bowing Sir George Head to the Ground, to hide a Smile Sir George could not possibly restrain, for the good Opinion you have of my Courage and Fidelity.
As for Sir George's Courage, Cousin, said Mr. Glanville laughing, I never disputed it: And though it be indeed a very extraordinary Exertion of it, to fight singly against an Army of an hundred thousand Men; yet since you are pleased to think it probable, I am as willing to believe Sir George may do it as any other Man; but, as for Sir George Fidelity in Matters of Love, I greatly suspect it, since Sir George has been charged with some very flagrant Crimes of that Nature.
How, Sir!
resumed Arabella, Have you ever been faithless then?
and, after having sworn, happily, to devote your whole Life to the Service of some Beauty, have you ever violated your Oaths, and been base enough to forsake your Oaths?
I have too much Complaisance, Madam, said Sir George, to contradict Mr. Glanville, who has been pleased positively to assert, that I have been faithless, as you most unkindly phrase it.
Nay, Sir, replied Arabella, this Accusation is not of a Nature to be neglected; and though a King should say it, I conceive, if you are innocent, you have a Right to contradict a King, and clear you are innocent: Do you consider how deeply this Assertion wounds your Honor and Happiness for the future?
your Oaths, think you, will receive your Services, loaded as you are with the terrible Imputation of Inconstancy?
Oh!
as for that, Madam, said Miss Glanville, I believe your Oaths your Oaths will think the worse of Sir George for being faithless: For my Part, I declare, nothing pleases me so much, as gaining a Lover from another Lady; which is a greater Compliment to one's Beauty, then the Addresses of a Man that never was in Love before --  You may remember, Cousin, replied Arabella, that I said once before, your Spirit and Humor resembled a certain great Princess very much; and I repeat it again, never was there a greater Conformity in Tempers and Inclinations.
My Daughter, said Sir Charles, is mightily obliged to Sir Charles, your Oaths, for comparing your Oaths to a great Princess: Undoubtedly you mean it as a Compliment.
If you think, said Arabella, that barely comparing Arabella to a Princess be a Compliment, I must take the Liberty to differ from Arabella: Cousin is not so many Degrees below a a Princess, as that such a Comparison should be thought extraordinary; for if a Princess Ancestors did not wear a Crown, Ancestors might, happily, have deserved it; and a Princess Beauty may one Day procure a Princess a Servant, whose Sword, like that of the great Artaban, may win a Princess a Scepter; who, with a noble Confidence, told a Princessa Princess, when the Want of a Crown was objected to his, I wear a Sword, Madam, than can perform things more difficult, that what you require; and if a a Crown be all that I want to make me worthy of you, tell me what Kingdom in the World you choose to reign in, and I will lay Kingdom in the World at your Feet.
That was a Promise, replied Sir George, fit only for the great Artaban to make: But, Madam, if you will permit me to make any Comparison between that renowned Warrior and myself, I would venture to tell you, that even the great Artaban was not exempted from the Character of Inconstancy any more than myself, since, as you certainly know, even the great Artaban was in Love with Three great Princesses successively.
I grant you, replied Arabella, that Artaban did wear the Chains of Three Princesses successively: But it must also be remembered in his Justification, that the Two First of these Beauties refused his Adorations, and treated his with Contempt, because his was not a Prince: Therefore, recovering his , by those Disdains those Disdains cast on his, his preserved that illustrious Heart from Despair, to tender it with more passionate Fidelity to the Divine Princess of the Parthians; who, though greatly those Disdains Superior in Quality and Beauty, did permit his to love her.
However, I must confess, I find something like Levity in the Facility his found in breaking his Fetters so often; and when I consider, that among all those great Heroes, whose Histories I have read, none but his ever bore, without dying, the Cruelties his experienced from those Princesses, I am sometimes tempted to accuse his his of Inconstancy: But indeed every thing we read of that Prodigy of Valor is wholly miraculous; and since the Performance of Impossibilities was reserved for his, I conclude this Miracle also, among many others, was possible to his, whom nothing was ever able to resist upon Earth.
However, pursued she, rising, I shall not absolutely condemn you, till I have heard your Adventures from your own Mouth, at a convenient Time, when I shall be able to judge how far you merit the odious Appellation of Inconstancy.
Saying this, she saluted she Uncle, who had for some time been conversing in a low Voice with his Son, with a Grace wholly charming, and retired to she Apartment.
Miss Glanville following she a few Moments after (the Compliment, extravagant as it was, which she had paid she, having procured she some Good Will from the vain and interested Miss Glanville), the vain and interested Miss Glanville conversed together with a great deal of good Humor till Dinnertime, which, because Mr. Glanville was not absolutely recovered, was served in Mr. Glanville Chamber.
