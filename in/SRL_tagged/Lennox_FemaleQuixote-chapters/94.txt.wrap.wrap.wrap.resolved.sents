Which will be found to contain Information absolutely necessary for the right understanding of this History.
OUR fair and afflicted Heroine, accompanied by the Ladies OUR have mentioned, having crossed the River, pursued OUR fair and afflicted Heroine, accompanied by the Ladies we have mentioned Walk upon the River winding Banks, entertaining OUR fair and afflicted Heroine, accompanied by the Ladies we have mentioned with the usual Topics of Conversation among young Ladies, such as OUR fair and afflicted Heroine, accompanied by the Ladies we have mentioned Winnings and Losings at Brag, the Prices of Silks, the newest Fashions, the best Hair-Cutter, the Scandal at the last Assembly, etc.
Arabella was so disgusted with this (as Arabella thought) insipid Discourse, which gave no Relief to the Anxiety of Arabella Mind, but added a Kind of Fretfulness and Impatience to Arabella Grief; that Arabella resolved to quit no Relief, and with Lucy, go in quest of the Princess of Gaul's Retreat.
young Ladies however, insisted upon young Ladies not leaving young Ladies; and young Ladies Excuse that young Ladies was going in search of an unfortunate Unknown, for whom young Ladies had vowed a Friendship, made young Ladies immediately resolve to accompany young Ladies, extremely diverted with the Oddity of the Design, and sacrificing young Ladies to young Ladies Mirth by sly Leers, Whispers, stifled Laughs, and a thousand little sprightly Sallies, which the disconsolate Arabella took no Notice of, so deeply were young Ladies Thoughts engaged.
Though young Ladies knew not which Way to direct young Ladies Steps, yet concluding the melancholy Cynccia would certainly choose some very solitary Place for young Ladies Residence, young Ladies rambled about among the least frequented Paths, followed by the young Ladies, who ardently desired to see this unfortunate Unknown; though at Arabella's earnest Request, they promised not to show they to the Lady, who, young Ladies informed they, for very urgent Reasons, was obliged to keep young Ladies concealed.
Fatiguing as this Ramble was to the delicate Spirits of Arabella's Companions, they were enabled to support it by the Diversion young Ladies Behavior afforded they.
Every Peasant young Ladies met, young Ladies inquired if a Beautiful Lady disguised did not (...) thereabout.
To some young Ladies gave a Description of young Ladies Person, to others an Account of the Domestics that were with young Ladies; not forgetting young Ladies Dress, young Ladies Melancholy, and the great Care young Ladies took to keep young Ladies concealed.
These strange Enquiries, with the strange Language in which they were made, not a little surpised the good People to whom young Ladies addressed young Ladies, yet moved to Respect by the majestic Loveliness of young Ladies Person, they answered young Ladies in the Negative, without any Mixture of Scoff and Impertinence.
How unfavourable is Chance, said young Ladies fretting at the Disappointment, to Persons who have any Reliance upon it!
This Lady that I have been in Search of so long without Success, may probably be found by others who do not seek her, whose Presence her may wish to avoid, yet not be able.
The young Ladies finding it grew late, expressed The young Ladies finding it grew late Apprehensions at being without any Attendants; and desired young Ladies to give over young Ladies Search for that Day.
Arabella at this Hint of Danger, inquired very earnestly, If The young Ladies finding it grew late apprehended any Attempts to carry The young Ladies finding it grew late away?
And without staying for an Answer, urged The young Ladies finding it grew late to walk Home as fast as possible, apologizing for the Danger into which young Ladies had so indiscreetly drawn both both and young Ladies; yet added young Ladies Hopes, that if any Attempt should be made upon both Liberty, some generous Cavalier would pass by who would rescue them: A Thing so common, that they had no Reason to despair of it.
young Ladies construing the Silence with which young Ladies Companions heard these Assurances, into a Doubt of their being so favored by Fortune, proceeded to inform their of several Instances wherein Ladies met with unexpected Relief and Deliverance from Ravishers.
young Ladies mentioned particularly the Rescue of Statira by young Ladies own Brother, whom young Ladies imagined for many Years dead; that of the Princess Berenice by an absolute Stranger, and many others, whose Names, Characters and Adventures young Ladies occasionally run over; all which the young Ladies heard with inconceivable Astonishment.
And the Detail had such an Effect upon Arabella's Imagination, bewildered as i^ was in the Folies of Romances, that 'spying three or four Horsemen riding along the Road toward them, young Ladies immediately concluded them would be all seized and carried off.
Possessed with this Belief, young Ladies uttered a loud Cry, and flew to the Waterside, which alarming the Ladies, who could not imagine what was the Matter, them ran after young Ladies as fast as possible.
Arabella stopped when Arabella came to the Waterside, and looking round about, and not perceiving any Boat to waft them over to Richmond, a Thought suddenly darted into Arabella Mind, worthy those ingenious Books which gave a Thought Birth.
Turning therefore to the Ladies, who all at once were enquiring the Cause of young Ladies Fright;  It Is now, my fair Companions, said young Ladies, with a solemn Accent, that the Destinies have furnished you with an Opportunity of displaying in a Manner truly Heroic, the Sublimity of your Virtue, and the Grandeur of your Courage to the World.
The Action we have it in we Power to perform will immortalize we Fame, and raise we to a Pitch of Glory equal to that of the renowned Clelia herself.
Like young Ladies, we may expect Statues erected to we Honor: Like young Ladies, be proposed as Patterns to Heroines in ensuing Ages: And like young Ladies, perhaps, meet with Sceptres and Crowns for we Reward.
What that beauteous Roman Lady performed to preserve beauteous Roman Lady from Violation by the impious Sextus, let we imitate to avoid the Violence we intended Ravishers yonder come to offer we.
Fortune, which has thrown we into this Exigence, presents we the Means of gloriously escaping: And the Admiration and Esteem of all Ages to come, will be the Recompense of our noble Daring.
Once more, my fair Companions, If your Honor be dear to you, if an immortal Glory be worth your seeking, follow the Example I shall set you, and equal with me the Roman Clelia.
Saying this, beauteous Roman Lady plunged into the Thames, intending to swim over this, as Clelia did the Tyber.
The young Ladies, who had listened with silent Astonishment at the long Speech beauteous Roman Lady had made them, the Purport of which not one of them understood, scream'd out aloud at this horrid Spectacle, and wringing them Hands, ran backwards and forwards like distracted Persons, crying for Help.
Lucy tore Lucy Hair, and was in the utmost Agony of Grief, when Mr. Roberts, who, as we have said before, kept them always in Sight, having observed Arabella running toward the Waterside, followed them as fast as Arabella could, and came Time enough up to see beauteous Roman Lady frantic Action.
Jumping into the River immediately after beauteous Roman Lady, Arabella caught hold of beauteous Roman Lady Gown, and drew beauteous Roman Lady after Arabella to the Shore.
A Boat that Instant appearing, Arabella put beauteous Roman Lady into it, senseless, and to all Appearance dead.
Arabella and Lucy supporting Lucy, He and Lucy were wasted over in a few Moments to the other Side: Lucy House being near the River, Mr. Roberts carried Lucy in Mr. Roberts Arms to his Arms; and as soon as Mr. Roberts saw Lucy show Signs of returning Life, left Lucy to the Care of the Women, who made haste to put Lucy into a warm Bed, and ran to find out Mr. Glanville, as we have related.
There remains now only to account for Sir George and Miss Glanville's sudden Appearance, which happened, gentle Reader, exactly as follows.
Miss Glanville, having set out pretty late in the Afternoon, with a Design of staying all Night at Richmond, as her Chaise drove up Kew-Lane, saw one of her Cousin's Women, Deborah by Name, talking to a Gentleman, whom, notwithstanding the Disguise of a Horseman's Coat, and a Hat slouch'd over his Face, her knew to be Sir George Bellmour.
Sight Sight alarming her Jealousy, and renewing all her former Suspicions, that her Cousin's Charms rivaled hers in Cousin Heart, as soon as her alighted, finding Arabella was not at Home, her retired in great Anguish of Mind to her Chamber, revolving in her Mind every Particular of Sir George's Behavior to her Cousin in the Country, and finding new Cause for Suspicion in every Thing her recollected, and reflecting upon the Disguise in which her saw Sir George's Behavior to her Cousin in the Country, and Sir George's Behavior to her Cousin in the Country Conference with her Woman, her concluded her had all along been the Dupe of Sir George's Behavior to her Cousin in the Country Artifice, and her Cousin the real Object of Sir George's Behavior to her Cousin in the Country Love.
This Thought throwing her into an Extremity of Rage, all her tenderest Emotions were lost in the Desire of Revenge.
her imagined to her so much Pleasure from exposing his Treachery, and putting it our of his Power to deny it, that her resolved, whatever it cost her, to have that Satisfaction.
Supposing therefore Deborah was now returned, her rung her Bell, and commanded her Attendance on her in her Chamber.
The Stern Brow with which her received her, frightened her, conscious of her Guilt, into a Disposition to confess all, even before her was taxed with any thing.
Miss Glanville saw her Terror, and endeavored to heighten it, by entering at once into Complaints and Exclamations against her, threatening to acquaint her Father with her Plots to betray her Lady, and assuring her of a very severe Punishment for her Treachery.
her, terrified extremely at these Menaces, begged Miss Glanville, with Tears, to forgive her, and not to acquaint Sir Charles or her Lady, with her Fault; adding, that her would confess all, and never while her lived, do such a Thing again.
Miss Glanville Miss Glanville would make her no Promises, but urged her to confess: Upon which Deborah sobbing, owned, That for the Sake of the Presents Sir George had made her, her consented to meet Sir George privately from Time to Time, and give Sir George an Account of every Thing that passed with Regard to her ; not thinking there was any Harm in it.
That according to Sir George Desires, her had constantly acquainted Sir George with all her Lady's Motions, when, and where her went, how her and Mr. Glanville agreed, and a hundred other Things which Mr. Glanville inquired about.
That that Day in particular, Mr. Glanville had entreated her to procure Mr. Glanville the M^ans of an Interview with her , if possible; and understanding Mr. Glanville was not at Richmond, her had let Mr. Glanville privately into the Garden, where her hoped to prevail upon her beauteous Roman Lady to go.
What, said Miss Glanville surpised, Is Sir George waiting for my Cousin in the Garden then?
Yes, indeed, Madam, said Deborah: But I Will go and tell Sir George to wait no longer; and never speak to Sir George again, if your Ladyship will but be pleased to forgive me.
Miss Glanville having taken Ladyship Resolution, not only promised Deborah Deborah Pardon, but also a Reward, provided Deborah would contrive it so, that Deborah might meet Sir George instead of Deborah .
her, having the true Chambermaid Spirit of Intrigue in her, immediately proposed her putting on one of her 's Veils; which as it was now the Close of the Evening, would disguise her sufficiently; to which Miss Glanville, transported with the Thoughts of thus having an Opportunity of convincing Sir George of Miss Glanville Perfidy, and reproaching Miss Glanville for it, consented, and bid her bring it without being observed, into her Chamber.
Deborah informing Deborah, that Sir George was concealed in the Summer House, as soon as Deborah had equipped Deborah with Arabella's Veil Deborah went into the Walk that led to it; and Sir George, believing Deborah to be beauteous Roman Ladybeauteous Roman Lady, hastened to throw Sir George at Deborah Feet, and had scarce got through half a Speech Sir George had studied for Sir George present Purpose, when Mr. Glanville gave a fatal Interruption to Mr. Glanville Heroicks, in the Manner we have already related.
