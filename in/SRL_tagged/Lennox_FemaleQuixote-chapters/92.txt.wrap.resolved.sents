Containing indeed no great Matters, but being a Prelude to greater.
MR. Glanville, who stood fixed like a Statue in the Place where Arabella had left him, was roused by this Message, which though palliated a little by the Girl that delivered it, who was not quite so punctual as Lucy, nevertheless filled him with extreme Confusion.
him obeyed however immediately, and retiring to him own Apartment, endeavored to recall to him Memory all Lady Bella had said.
The Ambiguity of all Lady Bella Style, which had led him into a Suspicion him had never entertained before, all Lady Bella last Words had partly explained, if as him understood all Lady Bella did, all Lady Bella meant him by Ariamenes.
Taking this for granted, him easily conceived some Plot grounded on all Lady Bella Romantic Notions had been laid, to prepossess all Lady Bella against him.
Sir George's Behavior to all Lady Bella rushed that Moment into Sir George's Behavior to her Thoughts: Sir George's Behavior to her instantly recollected all Sir George's Behavior to her Fooleries, Sir George's Behavior to her History, Sir George's Behavior to her Letter, Sir George's Behavior to her Conversation, all apparently copied from those Books all Lady Bella was so fond of, and probably done with a View to some other Design upon all Lady Bella.
These Reflections, joined to him new awaked Suspicions, that him was in Love with all Lady Bella, convinced him him was the Author of their present Misunderstanding; and that him had imposed some new Fallacy upon Arabella, in order to promote a Quarrel between their.
Fired almost to Madness at this Thought, him stamped about him Room, vowing Revenge upon Sir George, execrating Romances, and cursing him own Stupidity for not discovering Sir George was Sir George Rival, and knowing Sir George plotting Talent, not providing against Sir George Artifices.
Sir George first Resolutions were to set out immediately for Sir George's Seat, and force Sir George's Seat to confess the Part Sir George's Seat had acted against Sir George's Seat: But a Moment's Consideration convinced Sir George's Seat, that was not the most probable Place to find Sir George's Seat in, since it was much more likely Sir George's Seat was waiting the Success of Sir George's Seat Schemes in London, or perhaps at Richmond.
Next to satiating Sir George's Seat Vengeance, the Pleasure of detecting Sir George's Seat in such a Manner, that Sir George's Seat could not possibly deny or palliate Sir George's Seat Guilt, was next Sir George's Seat Heart.
Sir George's Seat resolved therefore to give it out, that Sir George's Seat was gone to London, to make Lady Bella believe it was in Obedience to Lady Bella Commands that Sir George's Seat had left Lady Bella, with a Purpose not to return till Sir George's Seat had cleared Sir George's Seat Innocence; but in reality to conceal Sir George's Seat in Sir George's Seat own Apartment, and see what Effects Sir George's Seat reputed Absence would produce.
Having thus taken Sir George's Seat Resolution, Sir George's Seat sent for Mr. Roberts Sir George's Seat Father's Steward, to whose Care Sir George's Seat had entrusted Lady Bella in Lady Bella Retirement, and acquainting Sir George's Seat with Part of Sir George's Seat Apprehensions with Regard to Sir George's Attemp^s upon Sir George's Seat Cousin; Sir George's Seat imparted to Sir George's Seat Sir George's Seat Design of staying concealed there, in order to discover more effectually those Attempts, and to preserve Lady Bella from any Consequence of those Attempts.
Mr. Roberts his Father's Steward approved of his Design of staying concealed there; and assured Mr. Roberts his Father's Steward of Mr. Roberts his Father's Steward Vigilance and Care, both in concealing Mr. Roberts his Father's Steward Stay, and also in giving Mr. Roberts his Father's Steward Notice of every Thing that passed.
Mr. Glanville then wrote a short Billet to Arabella, expressing Mr. Glanville Grief for Arabella Displeasure, Mr. Glanville Departure in Obedience to Arabella Orders, and Mr. Glanville Resolution not to appear in Arabella Presence, till Mr. Glanville could give Arabella convincing Proofs of Mr. Glanville Innocence.
This Letter Mr. Glanville sent by Roberts, which Arabella condescended to read, but would return no Answer.
Mr. Glanville then mounting Mr. Glanville Horse, which Roberts had ordered to be got ready, rode away, and leaving Mr. Glanville at a House Mr. Glanville sometimes put up at, returned on Foot, and was let in by Roberts at the Garden-door, and conducted unseen to Roberts Chamber.
While Roberts passed that Night and great Part of the next Day, meditating on the Treachery of Sir George, and soothing Roberts Uneasiness with the Hopes of Revenge, Arabella, no less disquieted, mused on the Infidelity of Arabella Lover, the Despair of Cynecia, and the Impossibility of Arabella ever being happy.
Then ransacking Arabella Memory for Instances in Arabella Romances of Ladies equally unfortunate with Arabella, Arabella would sometimes compare Arabella to one Lady, sometimes to another, adapting their Sentiments, and making Use of their Language in Arabella Complaints.
Great Part of the Day being spent in this Manner, the uneasy Restlessness of Arabella Mind made Arabella wish to see Cynecia again.
Arabella longed to ask Arabella a hundred Questions about the unfaithful Ariamenes, which the Suddainess of Arabella Departure, and Arabella own Astonishment prevented Arabella from doing, when Arabella made that fatal Discovery, which had cost Arabella so much Uneasiness.
Sometimes a faint Hope would arise in her Mind that Cynecia might be mistaken, through the great Resemblance that possibly was between Ariamenes and Glanville.
Arabella remembered that Mandana had been deceived by the Likeness of Cyrus to Spitridates; and concluded that illustrious Prince inconstant, because Spitridates, whom Arabella took for Cyrus, saw Arabella carried away, without offering to rescue Arabella.
Dwelling with Eagerness upon this Thought, because this Thought afforded Arabella a temporary Relief from others more tormenting, Arabella resolved to go to the Park, though Arabella had but little Hopes of finding Cynecia there; supposing it but too probable, that the Disturbance which the Sight, or fancied Sight of Ariamenes had given Arabella, would confine Arabella for some Days to Arabella Chamber.
Yet however small the Probability was of meeting with Arabella, Arabella could not resist the impatient Desire Arabella felt of going to seek Arabella.
Dispensing therefore with the Attendance of any other Servant but Lucy, Arabella left Arabella Apartment, with a Design of resuming Arabella usual Walk, when Arabella was met at Arabella stepping out of the Door by Lady L -- 's three Daughters, (who had visited Arabella during Arabella Residence at Richmond) and another young Lady.
These Ladies, who to vary the Scene of their Rural Diversions, were going to cross over to Twickenham, and walk there, pressed Arabella to accompany These Ladies, who to vary the Scene of their Rural Diversions.
Our melancholy Heroine refused These Ladies, who to vary the Scene of their Rural Diversions at first, but upon These Ladies, who to vary the Scene of their Rural Diversions repeated Importunity, recollecting that the Princess of Gaul had informed Arabella Arabella resided there, Arabella consented to go, in Hopes some favorable Chance might bring Arabella in These Ladies, who to vary the Scene of their Rural Diversions Way, or discover the Place of Arabella Retreat, when Arabella could easily find some Excuse for leaving Arabella Companions, and going to Arabella.
Mr. Roberts, who according to his Instructions, narrowly watched Arabella's Motions, finding Arabella did not command his Attendance as usual, resolved however to be privately of this Party.
his had but just Time to run up and acquaint Mr. Glanville, and then followed the Ladies at a Distance, who taking Boat, passed over to Twickenham, which his also did as soon as his saw the Ladies landed.
