In which a very pleasing Conversation is left unfinished.  AS Arabella was in this Part of Arabella Discourse, a Servant came to inform Arabella, that Sir George. Upon which, Sir Charles Glanville Sir Charles Glanville flew to receive Arabella Father; and Arabella, walking a little slower after Arabella, gave Sir George an Opportunity of holding a little longer Conversation with Arabella.  I dare believe, Arabella, said Sir George, when you read the Story of the unfortunate Alexander, your fair Eyes did not refuse to shed some Tears at the barbarous and shameful Death Sir George was going to suffer: Yet I assure you* melancholy as Sir George Situation was, it was also very glorious for Sir George, since Sir George had the sublime Satisfaction of dying for the Person Sir George adored; and had the ravishing Pleasure to know, that Sir George Fate would draw some Tears from that lovely Princess, for whom Sir George sacrificed Sir George Life: Such a Condition, Madam, ought to be envied rather than pitied; for, next to the Happiness of possessing the Person one adores, certainly the Glory of dying for her is most to be coveted.  Arabella, pleasingly surprised to hear Language so conformable to Arabella own Ideas, looked for a Moment upon the Baronet, with a most enchanting Complaisancy in Arabella Eyes --  It must be confessed, Sir, said Arabella, that you speak very rationally upon these Matters; and by the Tenderness and Generosity of your Sentiments, you give me Cause to believe, that your Heart is prepossessed with some* Object worthy of inspiring them.  Sir George seeming, as if he struggled to suppress a Sigh; You are in the right, Arabella, said he, to suppose, that if my Heart be prepossessed with any Object, it is with one, who is capable of inspiring a very sublime Passion; and I assure you, if ever it submits to any Fetters, they shall be imposed on he by the fairest Person in the World --  Since Love is not voluntary, replied Arabella, smiling, it may happen, that your Heart may be surprised by a meaner Beauty, than such a one as you describe: However, as a Lover has always an extraordinary Partiality for the beloved Object, it is probable, what you say may come to pass; and you may be in Love with the fairest Person in the Worldthe World, in your own Opinion.  They were now so near the House, that Sir George could reply no other ways, than by a very passionate Glance, which Arabella did not observe, being in haste to pay Arabella Respects to Arabella Uncle, whom Arabella met just going to Mr. Glanville. Arabella Looks were directed to Mr. Glanville. Sir Charles saluting Arabella with great Affection, they all went into Mr. Glanville's Chamber, who received Mr. Glanville Father with the utmost Respect and Tenderness; extremely regretting the Trouble Mr. Glanville had been at in taking a Journey to the Castle upon Mr. Glanville Account; and gently blaming Mr. Glanville Sister for his Sister Precipitancy in alarming Mr. Glanville so soon.  Sir Charles, extremely overjoyed to find Mr. Glanville so well recovered, would not allow Mr. Glanville to blame Mr. Glanville Mr. Glanville for what his Sister had done: but, addressing Mr. Glanville to Mr. Glanville Niece, Mr. Glanville thanked his Sister for the Care his Sister had taken of Mr. Glanville, in very obliging Terms.  Arabella could not help blushing at Arabella Uncle's Compliment, supposing Mr. Glanville thanked Arabella for having restored Arabella Cousin to her Cousin Health.  I assure you, her Cousin, said Arabella, Mr. Glanville is less obliged to my Commands, than to the Goodness of Mr. Glanville Constitution, for Mr. Glanville Recovery; and herein Mr. Glanville was not so obedient, as many Persons I could name to Mr. Glanville.  Mr. Glanville, willing to prevent the Company's Observation upon this Speech, began to acquaint Mr. Glanville Father with the Rise and Progress of Mr. Glanville Distemper: But though the old Gentleman listened with great Attention to the old Gentleman Son, while the old Gentleman was speaking; yet not having lost a Word of what Arabella had said, as soon as the old Gentleman was done, the old Gentleman turned to the old Gentleman Niece, and asked his Niece, how his Niece could be so unjust, to accuse the old Gentleman Son of Disobedience, because the old Gentleman did not recover, when his Niece commanded the old Gentleman? Why, his Niece, added the old Gentleman, you want to carry your Power farther then ever any Beauty did before his Niece; since you pretend to make People sick and well, whenever you please.  Really, Sir, replied Arabella, I pretend to no more Power, than what I presume all others of my Sex have upon the like Occasions; and since nothing is more common, than for a Gentleman, though ever so sick, to recover in Obedience to the Commands of that Person, who has an absolute Power over his Life, I conceive, I have a Right to think myself injured, if Mr. Glanville, contrary to mine, had thought proper to die --  Since, said the old Gentlemen, smiling, my Son has so well obeyed your Commands in recovering his Health, I shall tremble, lest, in Obedience to a contrary Command of his Niece, his should die, and deprive me of an Heir; a Misfortune, which, if it should happen, I should place to your Account.  I assure you, Sir, said Arabella, very gravely, I have too great an Esteem for Mr. Glanville, to condemn Mr. Glanville to so severe a Punishment as Death for light Offenses: And since it is not very probable, that Mr. Glanville will ever commit such Crimes against me, as can be only expiated by Death; such as Infidelity, Disobedience, and the like; you have no Reason to fear such a Misfortune by my means --  Alas! replied Sir George, you Beauties make very nice Distinctions in these Cases; and think, if you do not directly command your Lovers to die, you are no-ways accountable for your Lovers Death: And when a Lover, as it often happens, dies through Despair of ever being able to make himself beloved; or, being doomed to Banishment or Silence, falls into a Fever, from which nothing but Kindness can recover himself* and, that being denied, himself patiently expires; ^ say, when these Things happen, as these Things certainly do every Day; How can you hold your selves guiltless of these Things Deaths, which are apparently occasioned, either by your Scorn or Insensibility?  Sir Charles and Miss Glanville were extremely diverted at this Speech of Sir George's; and Mr. Glanville, though Mr. Glanville would have wished Mr. Glanville had been raillying any other Person's Follies than Mr. Glanville Cousin's, yet could not help smiling at the solemn Accent, in which Mr. Glanville delivered Mr. Glanville --  Arabella, mightily pleased with Mr. Glanville Manner of talking, was resolved to furnish Mr. Glanville with more Occasions of diverting the Company at Arabella Expense.  I see, answered Arabella, you are one of those Persons, who call a just Decorum, which all Ladies, who love Glory as they ought to do, are obliged to preserve, by the Name of Severity: But pray, what would you have a Lady do, whom an importunate Lover presumes to declare his Passion to? You know it is not permitted us to listen to such Discourses; and you know also, whoever is guilty of such an Offense, merits a most rigorous Punishment: Moreover, you find, that when a Sentence of Banishment or Silence is pronounced upon them, these unhappy Criminals are so conscious of the of Justice these unhappy Criminals Doom, that these unhappy Criminals never murmur against these unhappy Criminals Judge who condemns these unhappy Criminals; and therefore, whatever are these unhappy Criminals Fates, in Consequence of that Anger they have incurred, the Ladies, thus offended, ought not to be charged with the Ladies, as any cruel Exertion of they Power.  Such Eloquence as yours, Madam, replied Sir George, might defend Things yet more unjustifiable: However, you must give me Leave, as being interested in the Safety of my Sex, still to be of Opinion, that no Man ought to be hated, because no Man adores a beautiful Object, and consecrates all no Man Moments to her Service.  Questionless, resumed Arabella, Questionless will not be hated, while, out of the Respect and Reverence Questionless bears her, Questionless carefully conceals Questionless Passion from her Knowledge; but as soon as ever Questionless breaks through the Bounds, which that Respect prescribes Questionless, and lets her understand Questionless true Sentiments, Questionless has Reason to expect a most rigorous Sentence, since Questionless certainly, by that Presumption, has greatly deserved it.  If the Ladies, replied Sir George, were more equitable, and would make some Distinction between those who really love the Ladies, replied Sir George in a passionate and respectful Silence, and others who do not feel the Power of the Ladies, replied Sir George Charms, the Ladies, replied Sir George might spare the Ladies, replied Sir George the Trouble of hearing what so mortally offends the Ladies, replied Sir George: But when a Lady sees a Man every Day, who by a Man Looks, Sighs, and Solicitude to please a Lady, by a Man numberless Services and constant Attendance of a Lady, makes it evident, that a Man Soul is possessed with a violent Passion for a Lady; I say, when a Lady a Lady sees, and yet will not see, all this, and persists in using a passionate Adorer with all the Indifference due to a Man wholly insensible of the Power of a Lady Charms; what must a Man do in such a mortifying Situation, but make known a Man Torments to a Lady that occasions them, in order to prevail upon a Lady to have some Sense of what a Man does and feels hourly for a Lady sake?  But since a Man gains nothing by the Discovery of a Man Passion, resumed Arabella; but, on the contrary, loses the Advantages a Man was before possessed of, which were very great, since a Man might see and discourse with a Man Mistress every Day; and, happily, have the Honor to do a Lady a great many petty Services, and receive some of a Lady Commands; all these Advantages a Man loses, when a Man declares a Man loves: And truly, I think, a Man who is so unwise as to hazard a certain Happiness for a very improbable Hope, deserves to be punished, as well for a Man Folly as Presumption; and, upon both these Accounts, Banishment is not too rigorous a Sentence.
