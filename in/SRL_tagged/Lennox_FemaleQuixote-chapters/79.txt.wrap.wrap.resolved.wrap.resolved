The Contrast continued.  THE Company she had left behind she being all, except Mr. Glanville, to the last Degree surpised at she strange Words and Actions, continued mute for several Minutes after she was gone, staring upon one another, as if each wished to know the other's Opinion of such an unaccountable Behavior. At last Miss Glanville, who observed she Brother's Back was toward she, told Mr. Selvin in a low Voice, that she hoped Mr. Selvin would call and take Mr. Selvin Leave of them before Mr. Selvin set out for the Place where Mr. Selvin Despair would carry Mr. Selvin. --  Mr. Selvin in spite of Mr. Selvin natural Gravity, could not forbear laughing at this Speech of Miss Glanville's, which shocked her Brother, and not being able to stay where Arabella was ridiculed, nor entitled to resent it, which would have been a manifest Injustice on that Occasion, Mr. Selvin retired to Mr. Selvin own Apartment to give vent to that Spleen which in those Moments made Mr. Selvin out of Humor with all the World.  Sir Charles, when Sir Charles was gone, indulged Sir Charles in a little Mirth on Sir Charles Niece's Extravagance, protesting Sir Charles did not know what to do with Sir Charles Niece. Upon which Miss Glanville observed, that it was a Pity there were not such Things as Protestant Nunneries; giving it as Niece Opinion, that Sir Charles Niece ought to be confined in one of those Places, and never suffered to see any Company, by which Sir Charles Niece would avoid exposing Sir Charles Niece in the Manner Niece did now.  Mr. Selvin, who possibly thought this a reasonable Scheme of Miss Glanville's, seemed by Sir Charles Silence to assent to her Opinion; but Sir Charles was greatly displeased with Sir Charles Daughter for expressing Sir Charles Daughter so freely; alleging that Arabella, when Sir Charles Daughter Sir Charles Daughter was out of those Whims, was a very sensible young Lady, and sometimes. talked as learnedly as a Divine. To which Mr. Selvin also added, that Mr. Selvin Sir Charles Daughter had a great Knowledge of History, and had a most surprising Memory; and after some more Discourse to the same Purpose, Mr. Selvin took Mr. Selvin Leave, earnestly entreating Sir Charles to believe that Sir Charles never entertained any Design of making Mr. Selvin Addresses to Lady Bella.  In the mean Time, that Lady Bella after having given near half an Hour to those Reflections which occur to Heroines in the same Situation with Sir Charles Daughter, called for Lucy, and ordered Sir Charles Daughter to go to the Dining Room, and see in what Condition Mr Selvin was, telling Sir Charles Daughter had certainly left Condition Mr Selvin in a Swoon, as also the Occasion of it; and bid Condition Mr Selvin give Condition Mr Selvin all the Consolation in Condition Mr Selvin Daughter Power.  Lucy, with Tears in Condition Mr Selvin Daughter Eyes at this Recital, went down as Condition Mr Selvin Sir Charles Daughter was ordered, and entering the Dining Room without any Ceremony, Condition Mr Selvin being wholly fixed on the melancholy Circumstance Condition Mr Selvin Daughter Condition Mr Selvin Daughter had been telling Condition Mr Selvin Sir Charles Daughter; Condition Mr Selvin Sir Charles Daughter looked eagerly round the Dining Room without speaking a Word, till Sir Charles and Miss Glanville, who thought Condition Mr Selvin Sir Charles Daughter had been sent with some Message from Arabella, asked Condition Mr Selvin both at the same Instant, What Condition Mr Selvin Sir Charles Daughter wanted? --  I came, Sir, said Sir , repeating Sir Sir Charles Daughter's Words, to see in what Condition Mr. Selvin is in, and to give Mr. Selvin all the Solation in my Power.  Sir Charles, laughing heartily at this Speech, asked Sir Charles Sir Charles Daughter what Sir Charles Sir Charles Daughter could do for Mr. Selvin? To which Mr. Selvin Sir Charles Daughter replied, Mr. Selvin Sir Charles Daughter did not know; but Mr. Selvin Mr. Selvin Sir Charles Daughter had told Mr. Selvin Sir Charles Daughter to give him all the Solation in him Daughter Power.  Consolation thou would say, I suppose, said Sir Charles.  Yes, Sir Charles, said Sir Charles Sir Charles Daughter curtesying. Well, Child, added Sir Charles, go up and tell Sir Charles , Mr. Selvin does not need any Consolation.  Mr. Selvin Sir Charles Daughter accordingly returned with this Message, and was met at the Chamber Door by Arabella, who hastily asked Mr. Selvin Sir Charles Daughter if Mr. Selvin was recovered from Mr. Selvin Swoon: To which Mr. Selvin Sir Charles Daughter replied that Mr. Selvin Sir Charles Daughter did not know; but that Sir Charles bid Sir Charles tell Sir Charles Daughter Ladyship, Mr. Selvin did not need any Consolation.  Oh Heavens! cried Arabella, throwing Arabella into a Chair as pale as Death -- Arabella is dead, Arabella has fallen upon He Sword, and put an End to He Life and Miseries at once -- Oh! how unhappy am I, cried Arabella, bursting into Tears, to be the Cause of so cruel an Accident -- Was ever any Fate so terrible as mine -- Was ever Beauty so fatal -- Was ever Rigor so unfortunate -- How will the Quiet of my future Days be disturbed by the sad Remembrance of a Man whose Death was caused by my Disdain -- But why, resumed Arabella after a little Pause -- Why do I thus afflict Daughter Ladyship for what has happened by an unavoidable Necessity? Nor am I singular in the Misfortune which has befallen me -- Did not the sad Perinthus die for the beautiful Panthea -- Did not the Rigor of Barsina bring the miserable Oxyatres to the Grave -- And the Severity of Statira make Oroondates fall upon He Sword in her Presence, though happily his escaped being killed by it -- Let us then not afflict us unreasonably at this sad Accident -- Let us lament as us ought the fatal Effects of us Charms -- But let us comfort us with the Thought that us have only acted conformable to us Duty.  Arabella having pronounced these last Words with a solemn and lofty Accent, ordered Lucy, who listened to Arabella with Eyes drowned in Tears, to go down and ask if the Body was removed -- for added Arabella, all my Constancy will not be sufficient to support me against that pitiful Sight.  Arabella accordinly delivered Arabella Message to Sir Charles and Miss Glanville, who were still together, discoursing on the fantastical Turn of Arabella, when the Knight, who could not possibly comprehend what Arabella meant by asking if the Body was removed, bid Arabella tell Arabella Lady he desired to speak with Arabella Lady Lady.  Arabella, upon receiving this Summons, set Arabella to consider what could be the Intent of it. If Mr. Selvin be dead, said Arabella, what Good can my Presence do among Condition Mr Selvin be dead? Surely it cannot be to upbraid me with my Severity, that my Uncle desires to see me -- No, it would be unjust to suppose it. Questionless my unhappy Lover is still struggling with the Pangs of Death, and for a Consolation in Mr. Glanville Rival last Moments, implores the Favor of resigning up Mr. Glanville Rival Life in my Sight. Pausing a little at these Words, Arabella rose from Arabella Seat with a Resolution to give Mr. Selvin before Condition Mr Selvin died. Meeting Mr. Glanville as Miss Glanville was returning from Mr. Glanville Chamber to the Dining Room, Arabella told Miss Glanville, Arabella hoped Arabella was going to discover toward Mr. Glanville Rival, would not give Miss Glanville any Uneasiness; and preventing Mr. Glanville Reply by going hastily into the Dining Room, Miss Glanville followed Arabella dreading some new Extravagance, yet not able to prevent some new Extravagance, endeavored to conceal Mr. Glanville Confusion from Arabella Observation -- Arabella after breathing a gentle Sigh told told Sir Charles, that Arabella was come to grant Mr. Selvin Arabella Pardon for the Offense Miss Glanville had been guilty of, that Miss Glanville might depart in Peace.  Well, well, said Sir Charles, Sir Charles is departed in Peace without it.  How, Sir Charles, interrupted Arabella, is Sir Charles dead then already? Alas! why had Sir not the Satisfaction of seeing me before Sir Charles expired, that Sir Sold might have departed in Peace! Sir Charles would have been assured not only of my Pardon, but Pity also; and that Assurance would have made Sir Charles happy in Sir Charles last Moments.  Why, Niece, interrupted Sir Charles staring, you surprise me prodigiously: Are you in earnest?  Questionless I am, Sir Charles, said Niece, nor ought you to be surpised at the Concern I express for the Fate of a Man whose Death, nor at my Pardon I proposed to have granted my Pardonmy Pardon; since herein I am justified by the Example of many great and virtuous Princesses, who have done as much, nay, happily more than I intended to have done, for Persons whose Offenses were greater than Condition Mr Selvin's.  I am very sorry, Niece, said Sir Charles, to hear you talk in this Manner: It Is really enough to make one suspect you are --  You do me great Injustice, Sir Charles, interrupted Arabella, if you suspect me to be guilty of any unbecoming Weakness for a Man whose Death: If barely expressing my Compassion for a Man whose Death Misfortunes be esteemed so great a Favor, what would you have thought if I had supported a Man whose Death Head on my Knees while a Man whose Death was dying, shed Tears over a Man whose Death, and discovered all the Tokens of a sincere Affliction for a Man whose Death? --  Good God! said Sir Charles lifting up his Daughter Eyes, Did any body ever hear of any thing like this?  What, Sir Charles, said Arabella, with as great an Appearance of Surprise in Arabella Countenance as a Man whose Death had discovered, Do you say you never heard of any thing like this? Then you never heard of the Princess of Media, I suppose --  No, not I, Madam, said Sir Charles peevishly.  Then, Sir Charles, resumed Arabella, permit me to tell you, that this fair and virtuous Princess condescended to do all I have mentioned for the fierce Labynet, Prince of Assyria; who though he had mortally offended Arabella by stealing Arabella away out of the Court of the King Arabella Father, nevertheless, when he was wounded to Death in Arabella Presence, and humbly implored my Pardon before he died, Arabella condescended as I have said, to support he on Arabella Knees, and shed Tears for he Disaster -- I could produce many more Instances of the like Compassion in Ladies almost as highly born as Arabella, though perhaps many more Instances of the like Compassion in Ladies Quality was not quite so illustrious, Arabella being the Heiress of two powerful Kingdoms. Yet to mention only these --  Good Heavens! cried Miss Glanville here, being quite out of Patience, I shall go distracted --  Arabella surpised at this Exclamation, looked earnestly at he for a Moment -- and then asked he, Whether any thing Arabella had said had given he Uneasiness?  Yes, upon my Soul, Madam, said Miss Glanville so vexed and confused that Miss Glanville hardly knew what Miss Glanville said --  I am sorry for it, replied Arabella gravely, and also am greatly concerned to find that in Generosity you are so much exceeded by the illustrious Cyrus; who was so far from taking Umbrage at Mandana's Behavior to the dying Prince, that Miss Glanville commended Arabella for the Compassion Arabella had shown Miss Glanville. So also did the brave and generous Oroondates, when the fair Statira --  By Heavens! cried Miss Glanville rising in a Passion, there is no hearing this. Pardon me, Arabella, but upon my Soul, Madam, you will make me hang Arabella.  Hang yourself, repeated Arabella, sure you know not what you say? -- You meant, I suppose, that you will fall upon your Sword. What Hero ever threatened to give Hero so vulgar a Death? But pray let me know the Cause of your Despair, so sudden and so violent.  Miss Glanville continuing in a sort of sullen Silence, Arabella went on:  Though I do not conceive Miss Glanville obliged to give you an Account of my Conduct, seeing that I have only permitted you yet to hope for my Favor; yet I owe to Mr. Glanville and my own Honor the Justification I am going to make. Know then, that however suspicious my Compassion for Condition Mr Selvin may appear to your mistaken Judgment, yet my Compassion for Mr. Selvin has my Compassion for Mr. Selvin Foundation only in the Generosity of my Disposition, which inclines me to pardon the Fault when the unhappy Criminal repents; and to afford Mr. Selvin my Pity when Mr. Selvin Circumstances require my Compassion for Condition Mr Selvin. Let not therefore the Charity I have discovered toward Mr. Glanville Rival, be the Cause of your Despair, since my Sentiments for Condition Mr Selvin were Condition Mr Selvin living, would be what they were before; that is, full of Indifference, nay, happily Disdain. And suffer not yourself to be so carried away by a violent and unjust Jealousy, as to threaten your won Death, which if you really had any Ground for your Suspicions, and truly loved me, would come unsought for, though not undesir'd -- For indeed, was your Despair reasonable, Death would necessarily follow it; for what Lover can live under so desperate a Misfortune. In that Case you may meet Death undauntedly when it comes, nay, embrace it with Joy; but truly the killing one's self is but a false Picture of true Courage, proceeding rather from Fear of a further Evil, than Contempt of that you fly to: For if it were a Contempt of Pain, the same Principle would make you resolve to bear patiently and fearlesly all kind of Pains; and Hope being of all other the most contrary Thing to Fear, this being an utter Banishment of Hope, seems to have this Ground in Fear.
