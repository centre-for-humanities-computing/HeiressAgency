Being a Chapter of Mistakes.  SIR Charles, who, by this Time, had got to the Place she directed SIR Charles, who, by this Time, had got to the Place to, but saw no Appearance of fighting, and only a few Haymakers in Discourse together, inquired, If there had been any Quarrel between two Gentlemen in that Place?  One of two Gentlemen, at this Question, advancing, told Sir Charles, that two Gentlemen had quarrelled there, and were fighting with Swords; but that two Gentlemen had parted two Gentlemen; and that one of two Gentlemen, having an Horse tied to a Tree, mounted him, and rode away: That the other, two Gentlemen believed, was not far off; and that there had been no Bloodshed, two Gentlemen having come time enough to prevent one of them, having an Horse tied to a Tree, mounted him, and rode away: That the other, they believed, was not far off; and that there had been no Bloodshed.  Sir Charles was extremely satisfied with this Account; and, giving Haymakers some Money for the good Office Haymakers did in parting the two Combatants, rode up to meet Lady Bella; and informed Lady Bella, that Sir Charles Son was safe.  I cannot imagine his Son is safe, replied Lady Bella, when I see some of his Son Enemies (pointing to Haymakers) still alive: It is not customary, in those Cases, to suffer any to escape: And, questionless, my Cousin is either dead, or a Prisoner, since all my Cousin Adversaries are not vanquished.  Why, you dream, Madam, replied Sir Charles: Those Fellows yonder are Haymakers: What should make Those Fellows yonder Enemies to his Son? Those Fellows yonder were lucky enough to come in time to prevent his Son and another Gentleman from doing each other a Mischief. I cannot imagine for what Reason my Son quarrelled with that Person Those Fellows yonder speak of: Perhaps you can inform me.  Certainly, Sir, said Arabella, I can inform you, since I was the Cause of Those Fellows yonder Quarrel. The Story is too long to tell you now; and, besides, The Story is so connected with the other Accidents of my Life, that it is necessary you should be acquainted with my whole History, in order to comprehend it: But, if Those Fellows yonder are what you say, and did really part my Cousin and Cousin Antagonist, truly I believe Those Fellows yonder have done Cousin a very ill Office: For, I am persuaded, Cousin will never be at Rest, till, by Cousin Rival's Death, Cousin has freed Cousin from one, capable of the most daring Enterprises to get me into Cousin Power: And, since I cannot be in Security while Cousin lives, and persists in the Resolution Cousin has taken to persecute me, it had been better if Cousin had suffered all the Effects of Cousin's Resentment at that time, than to give Cousin the Trouble to hunt Cousin through the World, in order to sacrifice Cousin to the Interest of Cousin Love and Vengeance.  Sir Charles, no less astonished than alarmed at this Discovery of Cousin Niece's sanguinary Sentiments, told his Niece, Cousin was sorry to see a Lady so far forget the Gentleness of a Lady Sex, as to encourage and incite Men to such Extremities, upon a Lady Account. And, for the future, added Cousin, I must entreat you, his Niece, to spare me the Affliction of seeing my Son exposed to these dangerous Quarrels: For, though my Son Life is so little regarded by you, yet it is of the utmost Consequence to my Son.  Arabella, who found Matter sufficient in the Beginning of this Speech, to be offended with her Uncle, yet, mistaking the latter Part of it for a pathetic Complaint of her Cruelty, replied very gravely, That her Cousin's Safety was not so indifferent to her as my Son imagined: And that her did not hate my Son so much, but that my Son Death would affect her very sensibly.  Arabella, in speaking these Words, blushed with Shame, as thinking they were rather too tender: And Sir Charles, who colored likewise, from a very different Motive, was opening my Son Mouth, to tell Arabella, that my Son did not think my Son Son was much obliged to Arabella for not hating my Son; when Arabella, supposing my Son designed to press Arabella to a further Explanation of the favorable Sentiments Arabella felt for Mr. Glanville, stopped Mr. Glanville with Precipitation: Press me no more, said Arabella, upon this Subject: And, as I have already spoken too much, happily, before so many Witnesses, seek not to enhance my Confusion, by prolonging to Discourse that at present must needs be disagreeable to me.  I shall readily agree with Arabella, Arabella, replied Sir Charles, that you have spoken too much: And, if I had thought you capable of speaking in the manner you have done, I would have been more cautious in giving you an Occasion for it.  I should imagine, Sir, said Arabella, blushing with Anger, as Arabella before did with Shame, that you would be the last Person in the World who could think I had spoken too much upon this Occasion: And, since you are pleased to tell me so, I think it fit to let you know, that I have not, in my Opinion, transgressed the Laws of Decency and Decorum, in what I have said in my Cousin's Favor: And I can produce many Examples of greater Freedom of Speech, in Princesses, and Ladies of the highest Quality: However, I shall learn such a Lesson of Moderation in this respect, from your Reproof, that I promise you, neither yourself, or Mr. Glanville, shall have any Cause, for the future, to complain of my want of Discretion.  Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured, was half angry with Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured, for having obliged Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured Niece to such a Submission, as Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured thought it; and, apologizing for the Rudeness of Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured Reprehension, assured the Rudeness of his Reprehension, that Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured was perfectly convinced of the Rudeness of his Reprehension Discretion in all things; and did not doubt but the Rudeness of his Reprehension Conduct would be always agreeable to Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured.  Arabella, who, from what the Rudeness of his Reprehension Uncle had said, began to entertain Suspicions, that would never have entered any Imagination but hers, looked earnestly upon Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured for half a Moment, as if the Rudeness of his Reprehension wished to penetrate into the most secret Recesses of Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured Heart: But, fans^ing the Rudeness of his Reprehension saw something in Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured Looks that confirmed the Rudeness of his Reprehension Apprehensions, the Rudeness of his Reprehension removed the Rudeness of his Reprehension Eyes from Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured Face, and, fastening Arabella, who, from what her Uncle had said, began to entertain Suspicions on the Ground, remained for some Moments in Confusion. -- Sir Charles, whom the Rudeness of his Reprehension apparent Disturbance made very uneasy, proposed returning to the Castle; telling Lady Bella Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured expected to find Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured Son already there.  It Is more than probable, said Lady Bella, turning to Sir George, that my Cousin is gone in Pursuit of my Ravisher; and the Interruption that has been given to Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured designed Vengeance, making Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured more furious than before, it is not likely Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured will return till Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured has punished Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured Insolence by that Death Sir Charles, who was very polite and good-natured so justly merits.  Mr. Glanville is already so happy in your Opinion, said Sir George, with a very profound Sigh, that there is no need of Sir George rendering you this small Service, to increase your Esteem: But, if my Prayers are heard, the Punishment of my Ravisher will be reserved for a Person less fortunate, indeed, than Mr. Glanville, though not less devoted to your Interest, and concerned in your Preservation.  Sir George counterfeiting a Look of extreme Confusion and Fear, as Sir George ended these Words;  Arabella, who perfectly comprehended the Meaning they were designed to convey, thought herself obliged to take no Notice of they: And, therefore, without making any Reply to the young Baronet, who ventured slowly to lift his Eyes to Eyes Face, in order to discover if there were any Signs of Anger in it, Eyes told Sir Charles Eyes inclined to go home: And Sir George, with the rest of the Company, attended the rest of the Company to the Castle; where, as soon as the rest of the Company arrived, the rest of the Company took the rest of the Company Leave.  Sir George, notwithstanding Arabella's Care to deprive Sir George of an Opportunity of speaking to Eyes, told Eyes, in a Whisper, having eagerly alighted to help Eyes off Eyes Horse,  I am going, Eyes, to find out that insolent Man, who has dared to offer Violence to the fairest Person in the World: And, if I am so happy as to meet with the fairest Person in the World, the fairest Person in the World shall either take my Life, or I will put the fairest Person in the World into a Condition never to commit any more Offenses of that Nature.  Saying this, the fairest Person in the World made a low Bow; and, being desirous to prevent Bow Answer, remounted the fairest Person in the World Horse, and went away with the rest of the Companythe Company.  Arabella, who, upon this Occasion, was to be all Confusion, mixed with some little Resentment, discovered so much Emotion in her Looks, while Sir George was whispering to her, that her Uncle, as Sir George was handing her into the House, asked her, If her was offended at any thing Sir George had said to her?  Arabella, construing this Question as her had done some other things her Uncle had said to her, replied, in a reserved manner, Since my her Looks, contrary to my Intention, have betrayed my Thoughts to Arabella, I will not scruple to confess, that I have some Cause to be offended with Sir George; and that, in two Instances Today, Sir George has seemed to forget the Respect Sir George owes me.  Sir Charles was fired at this Account: Is this Account possible, said Sir Charles, that Sir George has had the Assurance to say any thing to offend you, and that before my his Face too? This Affront is not to be borne.  I am sorry, replied Arabella, eying Arabella heedfully, to see you so much concerned at This Affront.  Don't be uneasy, interrupted Sir Charles: There will be no bad Consequences happen from This Affront: But Sir Charles shall hear of This Affront, added Sir Charles, raising Sir Charles Voice with Passion: I Will force Sir Charles this Night to explain Sir Charles.  You must pardon me, Sir, said Arabella, more and more confirmed in Arabella Notions, if I tell you, that I am extremely offended at your uncommon Zeal upon this Occasion: And also I must assure you, that a little more Calmness would be less liable to Suspicion.  Mr. Glanville Mr. Glanville coming to meet them, Sir Charles, who did not take much Notice of what Arabella said, eagerly inquired for his Son; and, hearing his Son was not come home, was apprehensive of his Son meeting again with the Person his Son had quarrelled with: But his Son Fears did not last long; for Mr. Glanville came in, having purposely avoided the Company, to hide Lady Bella tormenting Folly had given his Son.
