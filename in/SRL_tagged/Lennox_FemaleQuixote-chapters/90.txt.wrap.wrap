it.  But tell me, replied Glanville, Was any thing the Matter with your Lady? She was in a piteous Taking, you say.  Oh dear! yes, Sir, said Lucy; but I was not bid to say any thing about that. To be sure, my Lady did cry sadly, and sighed as if her Heart would break; but I don't know what was the Matter with her.  Well, said Glanville, excessively shocked at this Intelligence, Go to your Lady; I am going Home -- You may bring me her Message to my own Apartment.  Lucy did as she was desired; and Mr. Glanville, impatient as he was to unravel the Mystery, yet dreading lest his Presence should make Arabella be guilty of some Extravagance before the Servants who were with her, he followed slowly after her, resolving if possible, to procure a private Interview with the lovely Visionary, for whose Sorrow, though he suspected it was owing to some ridiculous Cause, he could not help being affected.
