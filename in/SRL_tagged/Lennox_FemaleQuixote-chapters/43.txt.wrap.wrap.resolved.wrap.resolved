A Dispute very learnedly handled by two Ladies, in which the Reader may take what Part he pleases.  MR. Glanville, who was too much in Love to pass the Night with any great Degree of Tranquillity, under the Apprehensions he felt; it being the Nature of that Passion, to magnify the most inconsiderable Trifles into Things of the greatest Importance, when the most inconsiderable Trifles concern the beloved Object; did not fail to torment he with a thousand different Fears, which the mysterious Behavior of he Father, and the more mysterious Words of he Mistress, gave Rise to. Among many various Conjectures, all equally unreasonable, he fixed upon one, no way advantageous to Sir Charles; for, supposing that the Folly of Arabella had really disgusted Sir Charles, and made Sir Charles desirous of breaking off the designed Match between them; Sir Charles was, as Sir Charles thought, taking Measures to bring this about, knowing, that if Lady Bella refused to fulfill Lady Bella Father's Desire in this Particular, a very considerable Estate would descend to Sir Charles.  Upon any other Occasion, Sir Charles would not have suspected he Father of so ungenerous an Action; but Lovers think every thing possible, which Lovers fear; and being prepossessed with this Opinion, Sir Charles resolved the next Morning to sound he Father's Inclinations, by entreating Sir Charles to endeavor to prevail upon Lady Bella to marry Sir Charles before Lady Bella Year of Mourning for the marquis was expired.  Attending Sir Charles, therefore, at Breakfast, in Sir Charles own Chamber, Sir Charles made Sir Charles designed Request, not without heedfully observing Sir Charles Countenance at the same time; and trembling, lest Sir Charles should make Sir Charles an Answer, that might confirm Sir Charles uneasy Suspicion.  Sir Charles, however, agreeably surprised Sir Charles, by promising to comply with Sir Charles Desire that Day; for, added Sir Charles, though my Niece has some odd ways, yet, upon the Whole, my Niece my Niece is a very accomplished Woman; and when you are my Niece Husband, you may probably find the Means of curing my Niece of those little Follies, which at present are conspicuous enough; but being occasioned by a Country Education, and a perfect Ignorance of the World, the Instruction, which then you will not scruple to give my Niece, and which, from a my Niece Husband, without any Offense to my Niece Delicacy, my Niece my Niece may receive, may reform my Niece Conduct; and make my Niece Behavior as complete, as, it must be confessed, both my Niece Person and Mind now are.  Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark, as soon as Breakfast was over, went to visit the two Ladies, who generally drank their Chocolate together.  Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark the Justice of this Remark this Remark being then in Lady Bella's Apartment, Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark the Justice of this Remark this Remark was immediately admitted, where Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark this Remark found them engaged in a high Dispute; and, much against Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark Will, was obliged to be Arbitrator in the Affair, them having, upon Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark Entrance, them appealed to Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remarkthis Remark.  But, in order to place this momentous Affair in a true Light, it is necessary to go back a little, and acquaint the Reader with what had passed in Lady Bella's Apartment; and also, following the Custom of the Romance and Novel-Writers, in the Heart, of our Heroine.  No sooner were our our Heroine fair Eyes open in the Morning, than the unfortunate Sir George presenting the unfortunate Sir George to our Heroine Imagination, our Heroine Thoughts to use Scudery's Phrase, were at a cruel War with each other: our Heroine wished to prevent the Death of this obsequious Lover; but our could not resolve to preserve the unfortunate Sir George Life, by giving the unfortunate Sir George that Hope the unfortunate Sir George required; and without which, our feared, it would be impossible for the unfortunate Sir George to live.  After pondering a few Hours upon the Necessity of the unfortunate Sir George Case, and what a just Regard to our Heroine own Honor required of our , Decorum prevailed so much over Compassion, that our our Heroine resolved to abandon the unfortunate Sir George to all the Rigor of the miserable Sir George Destiny; when, happily for the disconsolate Lover, the History of the fair Amalazotha coming into our Heroine Mind, our remembered, that this haughty Princess, having refused to marry the Person, our Heroine Father recommended to our , because the unfortunate Sir George had not a Crown upon the unfortunate Sir George Head; nevertheless, when the unfortunate Sir George was dying for Love of our Heroine, condescended to visit the unfortunate Sir George, and even to give the unfortunate Sir George a little Hope, in order to preserve the unfortunate Sir George Life: See conceived it could be no Blemish to our Heroine Character, if our Heroine followed the Example of this most glorious Princess; and suffered our Heroine to relax a little in our Heroine Severity, to prevent the Effects of our Heroine Lover's Despair.  Fear not, Arabella, said our Heroine to our Heroine; fear not to obey the Dictates of thy Compassion, since the glorious Amalazontha justifies, by our Heroine Example, the Means thou will use to preserve a noble Life, which depends upon a few Words thou shall utter.  When our Heroine had taken this Resolution, our Heroine rung our Heroine Bell for our Heroine Women; and as soon as our Heroine was dressed, our Heroine our Heroine dismissed them all but Lucy, whom our Heroine ordered to bring our Heroine Paper and Pens, telling our Heroine, our Heroine would write an Answer to Sir George's Letter.  Lucy obeyed with great Joy; but by that time Lucy had brought Lucy Lady all the Materials for Writing, our Heroine Mind was changed; our having reflected, that Amalazontha, whose Example, in order to avoid the Censure of future Ages, our Heroine our Heroine was resolved exactly to follow, did not write to Ambiome^, but paid him a Visit, our our Heroine resolved to do the like; and therefore bid Lucy take Lucy obeyed with great Joy; but by that time Lucy had brought Lucy Lady all the Materials for Writing, Lucy Mind was changed; Lucy having reflected, that Amalazontha, whose Example, in order to avoid the Censure of future Ages, Lucy was resolved exactly to follow, did not write to Ambiome^, but paid him a Visit away again, telling our Heroine: our our Heroine had thought better of it, and would not write to him.  Lucy, extremely concerned at this Resolution, obeyed our very slowly, and with greeat seeming Regret.  I perceive, said Arabella, you are afraid, I shall abandon the unfortunate Man you solicit* for, to the Violence of Arabella Despair; but though I do not intend to write to Arabella, yet I Will make use of a Method, perhaps as effectual; for, to speak truly, I mean to make Arabella a a a Visit; for by this time Arabella Fever is, I suppose, violent enough to make Arabella keep Arabella Bed.  And will you be so good, our Heroine, said Lucy, to go and see the poor Gentleman? I warrant you, Arabella will be ready to die for Joy, when Arabella sees you.  There must be proper Precautions used, said Arabella, to prevent those Consequences, which the sudden and unexpected Sight of Arabella may produce. Those about Arabella, I suppose, will have Discretion enough for that: Therefore give Orders for the Coach to be made ready, and tell my Women, Those about the Coach must attend me; and be sure you give Those about the Coach Directions, when I enter Sir George's Chamber, to stay at a convenient Distance, in order to leave me an Opportunity of speaking to Arabella, without being heard: As for Arabella, you may approach the Bedside with Arabella; since, being my Confident, you may hear all we have to say.  Arabella, having thus settled the Ceremonial of Arabella Visit, according to the Rules prescribed by Romances, sat down to Arabella Tea-table, having sent to know, if Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark was up, and received for Answer, that Arabella would attend Arabella at Breakfast.  Arabella, who had at first determined to say nothing of the Affair to Arabella Cousin, could not resist Arabella had of talking upon a Subject so interesting; and, telling Arabella with a Smile, that Arabella was about to make a very charitable Visit that Morning, asked Arabella, if Arabella was disposed to bear Arabella Company in Arabella Company.  I know you Country Ladies, said Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark, are very fond of visiting your sick Neighbors: For my Part, I do not love such a grave kind of Amusement; yet, for the sake of the Airing, I shall be very willing to attend you.  I think, said Arabella, with a more serious Air than before, it behooves every generous Person to compassionate the Misfortunes of their Acquaintance and Friends, and to relieve their as far as lies in their Power; but those Miseries we ourselves occasion to others, demand, in a more particular Manner, our Pity; and, if consistent with Honor, our Relief.  And pray, returned Miss Glanville, who is it you have done any Mischief to, which you are to repair by this charitable Visit, as you call it?  The Mischief I have done, replied Arabella, blushing, and casting down Arabella Eyes, was not voluntary, I assure you: Yet I will not scruple to repair it, if I can; though, since my Power is confined by certain unavoidable Laws, my Endeavors may not happily have all the Success I could wish.  Well, but, Arabella Cousin, interrupted Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark, tell me in plain English, what this Mischief is, which you have done; and to what Purpose you are going out this Morning?  I am going to pay a Visit to Sir George Bellmour, replied Arabella; and I entreat you, Arabella Arabella Cousin, to pardon me for robbing you of so accomplished a Lover. I really always thought Arabella Cousin was in Love with Arabella, till I was undeceived by some Words Arabella Cousin spoke Yesterday; and a Letter I received from Arabella Cousin last Night, in which Arabella Cousin has been bold enough to declare Arabella Cousin Passion to me, and, through the Apprehension of my Anger, is this Moment dying with Grief; and it is to reconcile Arabella Cousin to the unfortunate Sir George Life, that I have prevailed upon me to make Arabella Cousin ; in which charitable Design, as I said before, I should be glad of your Company.  Miss Glanville, who believed not a Word Lady Bella had said, burst out a laughing, at a Speech, that appeared to a Word Lady Bella so extremely false and ridiculous.  I see, said Arabella, you are of a Humor to divert Arabella with the Miseries of a despairing Lover; and in this Particular, you greatly resemble the fair and witty Doralisa, who always jested at such Maladies as are occasioned by Love: However, this Insensibility does not become you so well as Arabella, since all Arabella Conduct was conformable to it, no Mar in the World being bold enough to talk to ArabellaLove; but you, Arabella Arabella Cousin, are ready, even by your own Confession, to listen to such Discourses from any body; and therefore this Behavior, in Arabella, may be with more Justice termed Levity, than Indifference.  I perceive, Arabella Cousin, said Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark, I have always the worst of those Comparisons you are pleased to make between me and other People; but, I assure you, as free and indiscreet as you think me, I should very much scruple to visit a Man, upon any Occasion whatever.  I am quite astonished, Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark, resumed Arabella, to hear you assume a Character of so much Severity; you, who have granted Favors of a Kind in a very great Degree criminal.  Favors! interrupted Miss Glanville, criminal Favors! Pray explain yourself, Madam.  Yes, Madam , said Arabella, I repeat it again; criminal Favors, such as allowing Persons to talk to you of Love; not forbidding Persons to write to Arabella; giving Persons Opportunities of being alone with Arabella for several Moments together; and several other Civilities of the like Nature, which no Man can possibly merit, under many Years Services, Fidelity, and Pains: All these are criminal Favors, and highly blameable in a Lady, who has any Regard for Arabella Reputation.  All these, replied Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark, are nothing in Comparison of making All these Visits; and no Woman, who has any Reputation at all, will be guilty of taking such Liberties.  What! Miss, replied, Arabella, will you dare, by this Insinuation, to cast any Censures upon the Virtue of the divine Mandana, the haughty Amalazontha, the fair Statira, the cold and rigid Parisatis, and many other illustrious Ladies, who did not scruple to visit their Lovers, when confined to their Beds, either by the Wounds their received in Battle, or the more cruel and dangerous ones their suffered from their Eyes? These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Husband Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Husband Husband Husband, would nevertheless most charitably condescend to approach These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Husbandtheir Hand he These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Husband their Hand he These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Husband Kiss their Hand he These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Husband their Hand he These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being These chaste Ladies, who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover, till he was upon the Point of being their Husband Husband Husband ; nay, these divine Beauties would not refuse to grant the same Favor to Persons whom these divine Beauties did not love, to prevent the fatal Consequences of these divine Beauties Despair.  Lord, Madam! interrupted Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark, I wonder you can talk so blasphemously, to call a Parcel of confident Creatures divine, and such terrible Words.  Do you know, Miss, said Arabella, with a stern Look, that it is of the greatest Princesses that ever were, whom you speak in this irreverent Manner? Is it possible, that you can be ignorant of the sublime Quality of Mandana, who was the Heiress of Two powerful Kingdoms? Are you not sensible, that Amalazontha was Queen of Turringia? And will you pretend to deny the glorious Extraction of Statira and Parisatis, Princesses of Persia?  I shall not trouble myself to deny any thing about them, Madam, said Miss GlanvilleGlanville; for I never heard of them before; and really I do not choose to be always talking of Queens and Princesses, as if I thought none but such great People were worthy my Notice: It looks so affected, I should imagine every one laughed at myself, that heard me.  Since you are so very scrupulous, returned Arabella, that you dare not imitate the Sublimest among Mortals, I can furnish you with many Examples, from the Conduct of Persons, whose Quality was not much superior to yours, which may reconcile you to an Action, you at present, with so little Reason, condemn: And, to name but One among some Thousands, the fair Cleonice, the most rigid and austere Beauty in all Sardis, paid several Visits to the passionate Ligdamis, when his Melancholy, at the ill Success of his Passion, threw his into a Fever, that confined his to his .  And pray, Madam, who was that Cleonice? said Miss GlanvilleGlanville; and where did Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark live?  In all Sardis, I tell you, said Arabella, in the Kingdom of Lydia.  Oh! then it is not in the Kingdom of Lydia, said Miss GlanvilleMiss Glanville: What signifies what Foreigners do? I shall never form my Conduct, upon the Example of Outlandish People; what is common enough in Foreigners Countries, would be very particular here; and you can never persuade me, that it is seemly for Ladies to pay Visits to Men in their Beds.  A Lady, said Arabella, extremely angry at A Lady A Lady Cousin's Obstinacy, who will suffer Men to press A Lady Hand, write to A Lady, and talk to A Lady of Love, ought to be ashamed of such an affected Niceness, as that you pretend to.  I insist upon it, Madam, said Miss Glanville, that all those innocent Liberties you rail at, may be taken by any Woman, without giving the World room to censure A Lady: but, without being very bold and impudent, A Lady cannot go to see Men in Men Beds; a Freedom that only becomes a Sister, or near Relation.  So then, replied Arabella, reddening with Vexation, you will persist in affirming the divine Mandana was impudent?  If A Lady paid such indiscreet Visits as those, A Lady A Lady was, said Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark.  Oh Heavens! cried Arabella, have I lived to hear the most illustrious Princess, that ever was in the World, so shamefully reflected on?  Bless me, A Lady! said Miss Glanville, what Reason have you to defend the Character of this Princess so much? this Princess will hardly thank you for your Pains, I fansy.  Were you acquainted with the Character of that most generous this Princess, said Arabella, you would be convinced, that Arabella was sensible of the smallest Benefits; but it is not with a View of acquiring Arabella Favor, that I defend this Princess against your inhuman Aspersions, since it is more than Two thousand Years since this Princess died; yet common Justice obliges me to vindicate a Person so illustrious for this Princess Birth and Virtue; and were you not this Princess , I should express my Resentment in another Manner, for the Injury you do this Princess.  Truly, said Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark, I am not much obliged to you Madam, for not downright quarrelling with Madam for one that has been in this Princess Grave Two thousand Years: However, nothing shall make me change my Opinion, and I am sure most People will be of my Side of the Argument.  That Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark sending for Permission to wait upon Arabella, this Princess ordered Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark to be admitted, telling Mr. Glanville having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark, this Princess would acquaint this Princess with the Dispute: To which this Princess consented.
