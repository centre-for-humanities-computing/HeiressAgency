In which the Mistakes are continued.  AS soon as Mr. Glanville appeared, the two Ladies retired; Miss Glanville asking Arabella a hundred Questions concerning the two Ladies Diversion, the Drift of which was, to know how Sir George behaved to Arabella: But that fair Lady, whose Thoughts were wholly employed on the strange Accidents which had happened to Arabella that Day, longed to be at Liberty to indulge Arabella Reflections; and, complaining of extreme Weariness, under Pretense of reposing Arabella till Dinner, got quit of Miss Glanville's Company, which, at that time, Arabella thought very tedious.  As soon as Arabella was left to Arabella, Arabella Imagination running over all that had happened, Arabella could not help confessing, that few Women ever met with such a Variety of Adventures in one Day: In Danger of being carried off by Violence, by one Lover; delivered by another; Insinuations of Love from a Third, who, Arabella thought, was enamoured of Arabella Cousin; and, what was still more surprising a Discovery, that Arabella Uncle was not insensible of Arabella Charms, but was become the Rival of her Uncle own Son.  As extravagant as this Notion was, Arabella found Precedents in Arabella Romances of Passions full as strange and unjustifiable; and confirmed Arabella in that Opinion, by recollecting several Examples of unlawful Love. Why should I not believe, said Arabella, that my Charms can work as powerful Effects as those of Olympia, Princess of Thrace, whose Brother was passionately enamoured of Arabella?  Did not the Divine Clelia inspire Maherbal with a violent Passion for her, who, though discovered to be her Brother, did not, nevertheless, cease to adore her? And, to bring an Instance still nearer to my own Case, was not the Uncle of the fair Alcyone in Love with her? And did the Uncle of the fair Alcyone in Love not endeavor to win her Heart by all the Methods in the Uncle of the fair Alcyone in Love Power?  Ah! then, pursued her, let us doubt no more of us Misfortune: And, since us fatal Beauty has raised this impious Flame, let us stifle it with us Rigor, and not allow an illtimed Pity, or Respect, to encourage a Passion which may, one Day, cast a Blemish upon us Glory.  Arabella, having settled this Point, proceeded to reflect on the Conquest Arabella had made of Sir George: Arabella examined Sir George Words over and over, and found them so exactly conformable to the Language of an Oroondates or Oronces, that Arabella could not choose but be pleased: But, recollecting that it behoved Arabella, like all other Heroines, to be extremely troubled and perplexed at an Insinuation of Love, Arabella began to lament the cruel Necessity of parting with an agreeable Friend; who, if he persisted in making Arabella acquainted with he Thoughts, would expofe he to the Treatment Persons so indiscreet always meet with; nor was Arabella less concerned, lest, if Mr. Glanville had not already dispatched Arabella Ravisher, Sir George, by wandering in Search of he, and, happily, sacrificing he to he eager Desire of serving Arabella, should, by that means, lay Arabella under an Obligation to him, which, considering he as a Lover, would be a great Mortification.  Sir George, however, was gone home to Sir George own House, with no Thoughts of pursuing Arabella's Ravisher: And Mr. Glanville, being questioned by Mr. Glanville Father concerning Mr. Glanville Quarrel, invented some trifling Excuse for it; which not agreeing with the Account the Baronet had received from Arabella, Mr. Glanville told Mr. Glanville Son, that his Son had concealed the Truth from his Son; and that there was more in that Affair than his Son had owned. You quarrelled, added his Son, upon Arabella's Account; and Arabella's Account did not scruple to affirm it before all the Company.  Mr. Glanville, who had vainly flattered himself with an Hope, that himself Cousin had not acquainted all the Company with Arabella's Account whimsical Apprehensions, was extremely vexed when himself found Arabella's Account had exposed Arabella's Account to Mr. Glanville, who had vainly flattered himself with an Hope, that his Cousin had not acquainted the Company with her whimsical Apprehensions Ridicule, and that it was probable even himself had not escaped: But, willing to know from Arabella's Account own Mouth how far Arabella's Account had carried Arabella's Account Folly, himself went up to Arabella's Account Chamber; and, being immediately admitted, Arabella's Account began to congratulate himself upon the Conquest himself had gained, as Arabella's Account supposed, over himself Enemy; and thanked himself very solemnly for the Security himself had procured for Arabella's Account.  Mr. Glanville, after assuring Arabella's Account, that Arabella's Account was in no Danger of ever being carried away by that Person whom Arabella's Account feared, proceeded to inquire into all that had passed between Arabella's Account and the Company whom Arabella's Account had joined, when Arabella's Account left himself; and Arabella, relating every Particular, gave himself the Mortification to know, that her Folly her Folly had been sufficiently exposed: But Arabella's Account touched upon Arabella's Account Fears for himself with so much Delicacy, and mentioned Arabella's Account Fainting in such a manner, as insinuated a much greater Tenderness than himself before had Reason to hope for; and this Knowledge destroying all himself Intentions to quarrel with Arabella's Account for what Arabella's Account had said, himself appeared so easy and satisfied, that Arabella, reflecting upon the Misfortune himself Father's newborn Passion would probably be the Occasion of to himself, could not help sighing at the Apprehension; looking on himself, at the same time, with a kind of pitying Complacency; which did not escape Mr. Glanville's Notice.  I must know the Reason of that Sigh, Cousin, said Mr. Glanville, smiling, and taking Arabella's Account Hand.  If you are wise, replied Arabella, gravely, you will be contented to remain in the pleasing Ignorance you are at present; and not seek to know a thing which will, happily, afford you but little Satisfaction.  You have increased my Curosity so much by this Advice, resumed my Curosity, accommodating my Curosity Looks to Arabella's, that I shall not be at Rest till I know what it is you conceal from me: And, since I am so much concerned in it, even by your own Confession, I have a Right to press you to explain yourself.  Since you are so importunate, replied Arabella, I mnst tell you, that I will not do you so great a Diskindness, as to explain me; nor will I be the first who shall acquaint you with your Misfortune, since you will, happily, too soon arrive at the Knowledge of it, by other means.  Glanville, who imagined this was some new Whim that had got into Whim Head, was but little perplexed at an Insinuation, which, had he been ignorant of Whim Foible, would have given he great Uneasiness: But, being sensible that Whim expected he would press Whim to disclose Whim, and appear extremely concerned at Whim refusing he that Satisfaction, he counterfeited so well, that Whim was at a loss how to evade the Arguments he used to make Whim unfold the terrible Mystery; when the Dinner-bell ringing, and relieving Whim sor the present, Mr. Glanville led Whim down to the Parlour; where Sir Charles and Mr. Glanville Daughter attended their coming.
