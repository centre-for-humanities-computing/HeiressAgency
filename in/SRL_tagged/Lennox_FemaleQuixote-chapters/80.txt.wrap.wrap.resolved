In which Mr. Glanville makes an unsuccessful Attempt upon Arabella.  Arabella, when Arabella had finished these Words, which banished in part Mr. Glanville's Confusion, went to Arabella own Apartment, followed by Miss Glanville, to whom Arabella had made a Sign for that Purpose; and throwing Arabella into a Chair, burst into Tears, which greatly surprising Miss Glanville, Arabella pressed Arabella to tell Arabella the Cause.  Alas! replied Arabella, have I not Cause to think Arabella extremely unhappy? The deplorable Death of Mr. Selvin, the Despair to which I see your Brother reduced, with the fatal Consequences which may attend it, fills me with a mortal Uneasiness.  Well, said Miss Glanville, your Ladyship may make yourself quite easy as to both these Matters; for Mr. Selvin is not dead, nor is my Brother in Despair that I know of.  What do you say, Miss, interrupted Arabella, is not Mr. Selvin dead? Was the Wound Mr. Selvin gave Mr. Selvin not mortal then?  I know of no Wound that Mr. Selvin gave Mr. Selvin, not I, said Miss Glanville; what makes your Ladyship Ladyship suppose Mr. Selvin gave Mr. Selvin a Wound* Lord bless me, what strange Thoughts come into your Head.  Truly I am rejoiced to hear it, replied Arabella; and in order to prevent the Effects of Arabella Despair, I Will instantly dispatch my Commands to Arabella to live.  I dare answer for Arabella Obedience, Madam, said Miss Glanville Glanville smiling.  Arabella then gave Orders for Paper and Pens to be brought Arabella, and seeing Miss Glanville enter the Room, very formally acquainted Miss Glanville with Arabella Intention, telling Miss Glanville, that Miss Glanville ought to be satisfied with the Banishment to which Arabella had doomed Miss Glanville unhappy Rival, and not require Miss Glanville Death, since Miss Glanville and nothing to fear from Miss Glanville Pretensions.  I assure you, Arabella, said Miss Glanville, I am perfectly easy upon that Account: And in order to spare you the Trouble of sending to Mr. Selvin, I may venture to assure you that Mr. Selvin is in no Danger of dying.  It Is impossible, Mr. Selvin, replied Arabella, according to the Nature of Things, it is impossible but Mr. Selvin must already be very near Death -- You know the Rigor of my Sentence, you know --  I know, Madam, said Miss Glanville, that Mr. Selvin does not think Mr. Selvin under a Necessity of obeying your Sentence; and has the Impudence to question your Authority for banishing Mr. Selvin from Mr. Selvin native Country.  My Authority, Sir, said Arabella strangely surpised, is founded upon the absolute Power he has given me over Arabella.  he denies that, Madam, said Miss Glanville, and says that he neither can give, nor you exercise an absolute Power over he; since you are both accountable to the King, whose Subjects you are, and both restrained by the Laws under whose Sanction you live.  Arabella's apparent Confusion at these Words giving Mr. Glanville Hopes that Mr. Glanville Hopes had fallen upon a proper Method to cure Arabella of some of Arabella strange Notions, Mr. Glanville Hopes was going to pursue Mr. Glanville Hopes Arguments, when Arabella looking a little sternly upon Mr. Glanville Hopes,  The Empire of Love, said Arabella, like the Empire of Honor, is governed by Laws of the Empire of Honor own, which have no Dependence upon, or Relation to any other.  Pardon me, Madam, said Miss Glanville, if I presume to differ from Arabella. Our Laws have fixed the Boundaries of Honor as well as those of Love.  How is that possible, replied Arabella, when possible, replied Arabella differ so widely, that a Man may be justified by the one, and yet condemned by the other? For Instance, pursued Arabella, you are not permitted by the Laws of the Land to take away the Life of any Person whatever; yet the Laws of the Land oblige you to hunt your Enemy through the World, in order to sacrifice him to your Vengeance. Since it is impossible then for the same Actions to be at once just and unjust, it must necessarily follow, that the Law which condemns it, and that which justifies it is not the same, but directly opposite -- And now, added Arabella, after a little Pause, I hope I have entirely cleared up that Point to you.  You have indeed, Arabella, replied Mr. Glanville, proved to a Demonstration, that what is called Honor is something distinct from Justice, since they command Things absolutely opposite to each other.  Arabella without reflecting on this Inference, went on to prove the independent Sovereignty of Love, which, said Arabella, may be collected from all the Words and Actions of those Heroes who were inspired by this Passion. We see it in them, pursued Arabella, triumphing not only over all natural and avowed Allegiance, but superior even to Friendship, Duty, and Honor itself. This the Actions of Oroondates, Artaxerxes, Spitridates, and many other illustrious Princes sufficiently testify.  Love requires a more unlimited Obedience from Love Slaves, than any other Monarch can expect from Monarch Subjects; an Obedience which is circumscribed by no Laws whatever, and dependent upon nothing but no Laws.  I shall live, Madam, says the renowned Prince of Scythia to the divine Statira, I shall live, since it is your Command I should do so; and Death can have no Power over a Life which you are pleased to take Care of --  Say only that you wish I should conquer, said the great Juba to the incomparable Cleopatra, and my Enemies will be already vanquished -- Victory will come over to the Side you favor -- and an Army of a hundred thousand Men will not be able to overcome the Man who has your Commands to conquer --  How mean and insignificant, pursued the Man who has your Commands to conquer --  , are the Titles bestowed on other Monarchs compared with those which dignify the Sovereigns of Hearts, such as divine Arbitress of my Fate, Visible Divinity, Earthly Goddess, and many others equally sublime --  Mr. Glanville losing all patience at the Man who has your Commands to conquer --   obstinate Folly, interrupted the Man who has your Commands to conquer --   here with a Question quite foreign to the Subject the Man who has your Commands to conquer --   was discussing, and soon after quitting the Man who has your Commands to conquer --   Chamber, retired to Mr. Glanville own, more than ever despairing of the Man who has your Commands to conquer --   Recovery.
