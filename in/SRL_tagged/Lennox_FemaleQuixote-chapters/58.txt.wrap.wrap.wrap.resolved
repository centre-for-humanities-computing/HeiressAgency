Containing only a few Inferences, drawn from the foregoing Chapters.  MR. Glanville, excessively delighted with this Event, could not help laughing at the unfortunate Baronet; who seemed, by Glanville Silence, and down-cast Looks, to expect it.  Who would have imagined, said Glanville, that so renowned a Hero would have tarnished the Glory of Glanville Laurels, as my Cousin says, by so base an Ingratitude? Indeed, Prince, pursued Prince, laughing, you must resolve to recover your Reputation, either by retiring again to your Cave, and living upon bitter Herbs, for the generous Sydimiris; or else wander through the World, in search of the Divine Philonice.  Don't triumph, dear Charles, replied Sir George, laughing in Sir George Turn; have a little Compassion upon Sir George, and confess, that nothing could be more unfortunate, than that damned Slip I made at the latter End of my History: But for that, my Reputation for Courage and Constancy had been as high as the great Oroondates, or Juba.  Since you have so fertile an Invention, said dear Charles, you may easily repair this Mistake. Ods-heart! It is pity you are not poor enough to be an Author; you would occupy a Garret in Grub-street, with great Fame to yourself, and Diversion to the Public.  Oh! Sir, cried Sir George, I have Stock enough by Sir George, to set up for an Author Tomorrow, if I please: I have no less than Five Tragedies, some quite, others almost finished; Three or Four Essays on Virtue, Happiness, etc. Three thousand Lines of an Epic Poem; half a Dozen Epitaphs; a few Acrostics; and a long String of Puns, that would serve to embellish a Daily Paper, if I was disposed to write one.  Nay, then, interrupted Mr. Glanville, you are qualified for a Critic at the Bedford Coffee-house; where, with the rest of your Brothers, Demy-wits, you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a Young, a R --, or a Johnson. Rail with premeditated Malice at the Rambler; and, for the want of Faults, turn even the want of Faults inimitable Beauties into Ridicule: The Language, because it reaches to Perfection, may be called stiff, labored, and pedantic; the Criticisms, when they let in more Light than your weak Judgment can bear, superficial and ostentatious Glitter; and because those Papers contain the finest System of Ethics yet extant, damn the queer Fellow, for over-propping Virtue; an excellent new Phrase! which those who can find no Meaning in, may accommodate with one of those who can find no Meaning own; then give shrewd Hints, that some Persons, though some Persons do not publish some Persons Performances, may have more Merit, than those that do.  Upon my Soul, Charles, said Sir George, thou art such an ill-natured Fellow, that I am afraid, thou will be sneering at me when I am gone; and wilt endeavor, to persuade Lady Bella, that not a Syllable of my Story is true. Speak, pursued he, Will thou have the Cruelty to deprive me of my lawful Claim to the great Kingdom of Kent; and rob me of the Glory of fighting singly against Five hundred Men?  I do not know, said Sir Charles, whether my Niece be really imposed upon, by the Gravity with which you told your surprising History; but I protest, I thought you were in earnest at first; and that you meant to make us believe it all to be Fact.  You are so fitly punished, said Mr. Glanville, for that ill-judged Adventure you related last, by the bad Opinion Lady Bella entertains of you, that I need not add to your Misfortune: And therefore, you shall be Prince Veridomer, if you please; since, under that Character, you are obliged not to pretend to any Lady, but the incomparable Philonice.  Sir George, who understood his Meaning, went home, to think of some Means, by which his might draw his out of the Embarrassment his was in; and Mr. Glanville, as his had promised, did not endeavor to undeceive Lady Bella, with regard to the History his had feigned; being very well satisfied with his having put it out of his Power to make his Addresses to undeceive Lady Bella, since undeceive Lady Bella now looked upon his as the Lover of Philonice.  As for Sir Charles, Sir Charles did not penetrate into the Meaning of Sir George's Story; and only imagined, that by relating such a Heap of Adventures, Sir Charles had a Design to entertain the Company, and give a Proof of the Felicity of Sir Charles Invention; and Miss Glanville, who supposed, Sir Charles had been ridiculing undeceive Lady Bella Cousin's strange Notions, was better pleased with Sir Charles than ever.  Arabella, however, was less satisfied than any of relating such a Heap of Adventures, he had a Design to entertain the Company, and give a Proof of the Felicity of his Invention; and Miss Glanville, who supposed, he had been ridiculing her Cousin's strange Notions, was better pleased with him than ever.  : Arabella could not endure to see so brave a Knight, who drew his Birth from a Race of Kings, tarnish the Glory of his gallant Actions by so base a Perfidy.  Alas! said Arabella to Arabella, How much Reason has the beautiful Philonice to accuse me for all the Anguish Arabella suffers? since I am the Cause, that the ungrateful Prince, on whom Arabella bestows Arabella Affections, suffers Arabella to remain quietly, in the Hands of Arabella Ravisher, without endeavoring to rescue Arabella: But, Oh! too lovely, and unfortunate Fair-one, said Arabella, as if Arabella had been present, and listening to Arabella, distinguish, I beseech you, between those Faults, which the Will, and those which Necessity, makes us commit. I am the Cause, it is true, of thy Lover's Infidelity; but I am the innocent Cause; and would repair the Evils, my fatal Beauty gives Rise to, by any Sacrifice in my Power to make.  While Arabella, by Arabella romantic Generosity, bewails the imaginary Afflictions of the full as imaginary Philonice; Mr. Glanville, who thought the Solitude she lived in, confirmed she in she absurd and ridiculous Notions, desired his Father to press she to go to London.  Sir Charles complied with Sir Charles Request, and earnestly entreated she to leave the Castle, and spend a few Months in Town. she Year of Mourning being now expired, she consented to go; but Sir Charles, who did not think his Son's Health absolutely confirmed, proposed to spend a few Weeks at Bath; which was readily complied with by Arabella.
