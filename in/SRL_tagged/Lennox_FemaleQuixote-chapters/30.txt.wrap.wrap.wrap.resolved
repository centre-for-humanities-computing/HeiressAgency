Some curious Instructions for relating an History.  ARABELLA, as soon as ARABELLA left them, went up to ARABELLA Apartment; and, calling Lucy into Lucy Closet, told Lucy that Lucy had made Choice of Lucy, since Lucy was best acquainted with Lucy Thoughts, to relate Lucy History to Lucy Cousins, and a Person of Quality who was with them.  Sure your Ladyship jests with me, said Lucy: How can I make a History about your Ladyship?  There is no Occasion, replied ARABELLA, for you to make a History: There are Accidents enough in my Life to afford Matter for a long one: All you have to do is to relate them as exactly as possible. You have lived with me from my Childhood, and are instructed in all my Adventures; so that you must be certainly very capable of executing the Task I have honored you with.  Indeed, said Lucy, I must beg your Ladyship will excuse me: I never could tell how to repeat a Story when I have read a Story; and I know a Story is not such simple Girls as I can tell Histories: It is only sit for Clerks, and such Sort of People, that are very learned.  You are learned enough for that Purpose, said ARABELLA; and, if you make so much Difficulty in performing this Part of your Duty, pray how came you to imagine you were fit for my Service, and the Distinction I have favored you with? Did you ever hear of any Woman that refused to relate Woman Lady's Story, when desired? Therefore, if you hope to possess my Favor and Confidence any longer, acquit yourself handsomely of this Task, to which I have preferred you.  Lucy, terrified at the Displeasure Lucy saw in her Lady's Countenance, begged Lucy to tell Lucy what Lucy must say.  Well! exclaimed ARABELLA: I am certainly the most unfortunate Woman in the World! Every thing happens to yourself in a contrary manner from any other Person! Here, instead of my desiring you to soften those Parts of my History where you have greatest room to flatter; and to conceal, if possible, some of those Disorders my Beauty has occasioned; you ask me to tell you what you must say; as if it was not necessary you should know as well as yourself, and be able, not only to recount all my Words and Actions, even the smallest and most inconsiderable, but also all my Thoughts, however instantaneous; relate exactly every Change of my Countenance; number all my Smiles, Half-smiles, Blushes, Turnings pale, Glances, Pauses, Full-stops, Interruptions; the Rise and Falling of my Voice; every Motion of my Eyes; and every Gesture which I have used for these Ten Years past; nor omit the smallest Circumstance that relates to yourself.  Lord bless me! yourself, said Lucy, excessively astonished, I never, till this Moment, it seems, knew the hundredth thousandth Part of what was expected from yourself: I am sure, if I had, I would never have gone to Service; for I might well know I was not fit for such Slavery.  There is no such great Slavery in doing all I have mentioned to Lucy, interrupted Arabella: It requires, indeed, a good Memory, in which I never thought you deficient; for you are punctual to the greatest Degree of Exactness in recounting every thing one desires to hear from Arabella.  Lucy, whom this Praise soothed into good Humor, and flattered with a Belief, that Arabella was able, with a little Instruction, to perform what Arabella Lady required, told her Lady, if her Lady pleased only to put her Lady in a Way how to tell her Lady History, her Lady would engage, after doing it once, to tell it again whenever her Lady was desired.  Arabella, being obliged to comply with the odd Request, for which there was no Precedent in all the Romances her Lady Library was stuffed with, began to inform her Lady in this manner:  First, said her Lady, you must relate my Birth, which you know is very illustrious; and, because I am willing to spare you the Trouble of repeating Things, that are not absolutely necessary, you must apologize to your Hearers for slipping over what passed in my Infancy, and the first Eight or Ten Years of my Life; not failing, however, to remark, that, from some sprightly Sallies of Imagination, at those early Years, those about her Lady conceived mavelous Hopes of my future Understanding: From thence you must proceed to an accurate Description of my Person.  What! Madam, interrupted Lucy, must I tell what Sort of Person you have, to People who have seen you but a Moment ago?  Questionless you must, replied Arabella; and herein you follow the Examples of all the 'Squires and Maids who relate Squires Masters and Ladies Histories: For, though it be to a Brother, or near Relation, who has seen them a thousand times, yet them never omit an exact Account of them Persons.  Very well, Madam, said Lucy: I shall be sure not to forget that Part of my Story. I wish I was as perfect in all the rest.  Then, Lucy, you must repeat all the Conversations I have ever held with Lucy upon the Subjects of Love and Gallantry, that your Audience may be so well acquainted with my Humor, as to know exactly, before your Audience are told, how I shall behave, in whatever Adventures befall me. -- After that, you may proceed to tell your Audience, how a noble Unknown saw me at Church; how prodigiously a noble Unknown was struck with my Appearance; the tumultuous Thoughts that this first View of me occasioned in a noble Unknown Mind. --  Indeed, Madam, interrupted Lucy again, I cannot pretend to tell the tumultuous Thoughts that this first View of me occasioned in his Mind: For how should I know what they were? None but a noble Unknown can tell that.  However that may be, said Arabella, I expect you should decypher all Arabella Thoughts, as plainly as Arabella himself could do; otherwise my History will be very imperfect: Well, I suppose you are at no loss about that whole Adventure, in which you Arabella bore so great a Share; so need not give you any further Instructions concerning it: Only you must be sure, as I said before, not to omit the least Circumstance in my Behavior, but relate every thing I did, said, and thought, upon that Occasion. The disguised Gardener must appear next in your Story: Here you will of necessity be a little deficient, since you are not able to acquaint your Hearers with The disguised Gardener true Name and Quality; which, questionless, is very illustrious. However, above all, I must charge you not to mention that egregious Mistake about the Carp; for, you know how --  Here Miss Glanville's Entrance put a Stop to the Instructions Lucy was receiving: For the Instructions Lucy told Arabella, that Sir George was gone.  How! returned the Instructions Lucy, is Sir George gone? Truly I am not much obliged to Sir George for the Indifference Sir George has showed to hear my Story.  Why, really, the Instructions Lucy, said Miss Glanville, neither of us expected you would be as good as your Word, you were so long in sending your Woman down: And my Brother persuaded Sir George you were only in Jest; and Sir George has carried Sir George home to Dinner.  And is it at Sir George's, replied Arabella, that my Brother hopes to meet with an Occasion of clearing my Brother? my Brother is either very insensible of my Anger, or very conscious of my Brother own Innocence.  Miss Glanville, having nothing to say in Answer to an Accusation she did not understand, changed the Discourse: And the two Ladies passed the rest of the Day together, with tolerable Good Humor on Miss Glanville's Side; who was in great hopes of making a Conquest of the Baronet, before whom Arabella had made Arabella ridiculous enough: But that Lady was far from being at Ease; Lady had laid Lady under a Necessity of banishing Mr. Glanville, if Mr. Glanville did not give some convincing Proof of Mr. Glanville Innocence; which, as Matters stood, Lady thought would be very hard for Mr. Glanville to procure; and, as Lady could not absolutely believe Mr. Glanville guilty, Lady was concerned Lady had gone so far.
