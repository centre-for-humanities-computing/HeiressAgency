In which the History is concluded.  MR Glanville, who fancied to himself the most ravishing Delight from conversing with himself lovely Cousin, now recovered to the free Use of all her noble Powers of Reason, would have paid her a Visit that afternoon, had not a moments Reflection convinced himself that now was the Time, when her Mind was laboring under the force of Conviction, to introduce the repentant Sir George to her, who by confessing the ridiculous Farce himself had invented to deceive her, might restore himself to her good Opinion, and add to the Doctor's solid Arguments the poignant Sting of Ridicule which her would then perceive her had incurred.  Sir George being now able to leave Sir George Chamber, and Arabella well enough recovered to admit a a Visit in hers, Mr Glanville entreated Mr Glanville Father to wait on her, and get Permission for Sir George to attend her upon a Business of some Consequence. Sir George Chamber no sooner mentioned this Request, than Arabella after a little Hesitation complied with it. As Arabella had been kept a Stranger to all the Particulars of Mr Glanville's Quarrels with the young Baronet, Arabella Thoughts were a little perplexed concerning the Occasion of a Visit in hers, and Arabella Embarrassment was considerably increased by the Confusion which Arabella perceived in the Countenance of Sir George. It was not without some Tokens of a painfully suppressed Reluctance that Sir George consented to perform Sir George Promise, when Mr Glanville claimed it, but the Disadvantages that would attend Mr Glanville Breach of it, dejected and humbled as Mr Glanville now was, presenting the Disadvantages that would attend Mr Glanville Mr Glanville Breach of it, dejected and humbled as Mr Glanville now was in a forcible manner to Mr Glanville Imagination, confirmed Mr Glanville wavering Resolutions. And since Mr Glanville found Mr Glanville obliged to be Mr Glanville own Accuser, Mr Glanville endeavored to do it with Mr Glanville Mr Glanville could. Acknowledging therefore to Lady Bella all the Artifices Lady Bella Deception by Romances had given Mr Glanville Encouragement to use upon Lady Bella, and explaining very explicitly the last with relation to the pretended Princess of Gaul, Mr Glanville submissively asked Lady Bella Pardon for the Offense it would now give Lady Bella, as well as for the Trouble as well had formerly.  Arabella struck with inconceivable Cnfusion, having only bowed Arabella Head to Arabella Apology desired to be left alone, and continued for near two Hours afterward wholly absorbed in the most disagreeable Reflections on the Absurdity of Lady Bella past Behavior, and the Contempt and Ridicule to which Lady Bella now saw plainly Lady Bella had exposed Lady Bella. The Violence of these first Emotions having at length subsided, Lady Bella sent for Sir Charles, and Mr Glanville, and having with a noble Ingenuity expatiated upon the Follies Lady Bella vitiated Judgment had led Lady Bella into, Lady Bella apologized to the first, for Lady Bella Lady Bella had given Sir Charles of Uneasiness; and, turning to Mr. Glanville, whom Lady Bella beheld with a Look of mingled Tenderness and Modesty, To give you Lady Bella, with all my remaining Imperfections, is making you but a poor Present in return for the Obligations your generous Affection has laid me under to you; yet since I am so happy as to be desired for a Partner for Life by a Man of your Sense and Honor, I will endeavor to make Lady Bella as worthy as I am able of such a favorable Distinction.  Mr Glanville kissed Lady Bella Lady Bella gave Mr Glanville with an emphatic Silence, while Sir Charles of Uneasiness, in the most obliging Manner imaginable, thanked Lady Bella for Lady Bella conferred both on Mr. Glanville and Son by this Alliance.  Sir George, entangled in Sir George own Artifices, saw Sir George under a Necessity of confirming Sir George had made to Mr Glanville during Sir George Fit of Penitence, and was accordingly married to Lady Bella, at the same Time that Mr. Glanville and Arabella were united.  We choose, Reader, to express this Circumstance, though the same, in different Words, as well to avoid Repetition, as to intimate that the first mentioned Pair were indeed only married in the common Acceptance of the Word; that is, Mr. Glanville and Arabella were privileged to join Fortunes, Equipages, Titles, and Expense; while Mr. Glanville and Arabella were united, as well in these, as in every Virtue and laudable Affection of the Mind.
