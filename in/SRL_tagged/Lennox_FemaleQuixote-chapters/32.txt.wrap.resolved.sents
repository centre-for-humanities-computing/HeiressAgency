In which our Heroine is suspected of Insensibility.
WHILE these things passed at the Castle, Sir George was meditating on the Means Sir George should use to acquire the Esteem of Lady Bella, of whose Person Sir George was a little enamoured, but of Lady Bella Fortune a great deal more.
By the Observations Sir George had made on Lady Bella Behavior, Sir George discovered Lady Bella peculiar Turn: Sir George was well read in Romances himself, and had actually employed Sir George some Weeks in giving a new Version of the Grand Cyrus; but the prodigious Length of the Task Sir George had undertaken, terrified Sir George so much, that Sir George gave it over: Nevertheless, Sir George was perfectly well acquainted with the chief Characters in most of the French Romances; could tell every thing that was borrowed from the chief Characters, in all the new Novels that came out; and, being a very accurate Critic, and a mortal Hater of Dryden, ridiculed Sir George for want of Invention, as it appeared by Sir George having recourse to these Books for the most shining Characters and Incidents in Sir George Plays.
Almanzor, Almanzor would say, was the Copy of the famous Artaban in Cleopatra, whose Exploits Arabella had expatiated upon to Miss Glanville, and her Brother: Almanzor admired Character of Melantha in Marriage a-la-mode, was drawn from Berissa in the Grand Cyrus; and the Story of Osmyn and Bensayda, in Almanzor Conquest of Granada, taken from Sesostris and Timerilla in that Romance.
Fraught therefore with the Knowledge of all the Extravagances and Peculiarities in these Books, Almanzor resolved to make Almanzor Addresses to whose Exploits Arabella in the Form they prescribed; and, not having Delicacy enough to be disgusted with the Ridicule in whose Exploits Arabella Character, served Almanzor with whose Exploits Arabella Foible, to effect Almanzor Designs.
his Designs being necessary, in order to Almanzor better Acquaintance with whose Exploits Arabella, to be upon very friendly Terms with Miss Glanville and whose Exploits Arabella Brother, Almanzor said a thousand gallant Things to one, and seemed so little offended with the Gloom Almanzor observed upon the Countenance of the other, who positively assured Almanzor, that whose Exploits Arabella meant only to laugh at Almanzor, when whose Exploits Arabella promised Almanzor whose Exploits Arabella History, that Almanzor entreated Almanzor, with the most obliging Earnestness, to favor Almanzor with Almanzor Company at Almanzor House, where Almanzor omitted no sort of Civility, to confirm their Friendship and Intimacy; and persuaded Almanzor, by several little and seemingly unguarded Expressions, that Almanzor was not so great an Admirer of Lady Bella, as Lady Bella agreeable Cousin Miss Glanville.
Having thus secured a Footing in the Castle, Almanzor furnished Almanzor Memory with all the necessary Rules of making Love in whose Exploits Arabella's Taste, and deferred Almanzor next Visit no longer than till the following Day; but Mr. Glanville being indisposed, and not able to see his Company, Mr. Glanville knew it would be in vain to expect to see whose Exploits Arabella, since it was not to be imagined, Mr. Glanville could admit of a Visit, whose Exploits Arabella Brother being ill; and Lady Bella must be also necessarily engaged with whose Exploits Arabella.
Contenting her Brother, therefore, with having inquired after the Health of the Two Ladies, her Brother returned home, not a little vexed at her Brother Disappointment.
Mr. Glanville's Indisposition, increasing every Day, grew at last dangerous enough to fill her Brother Sister with extreme Apprehensions.
whose Exploits Arabella, keeping up to whose Exploits Arabella Forms, sent regularly every Day, to inquire after the Health of the Two Ladies; but did not offer to go into whose Exploits Arabella Chamber, though Mr. Glanville Mr. Glanville was almost always there.
As whose Exploits Arabella conceived whose Exploits Arabella Sickness to be occasioned by the Violence of whose Exploits Arabella Passion for whose Exploits Arabella, whose Exploits Arabella expected some Overture should be made whose Exploits Arabella by his Sister, to engage whose Exploits Arabella to make whose Exploits Arabella a Visit; such a Favor being never granted by any Lady to a sick Lover, till whose Exploits Arabella was previously informed, whose Exploits Arabella Presence was necessary to hinder the Increase of whose Exploits Arabella Distemper.
Mr. Glanville Mr. Glanville would not have failed to represent to whose Exploits Arabella Cousin the Incivility and Carelessness of whose Exploits Arabella Behavior, in not deigning to come and see whose Exploits Arabella Brother in her Brother Indisposition, had not Mr. Glanville, imputing this Neglect to the Nicety of whose Exploits Arabella Notions, which her Brother had upon other Occasions experienced, absolutely forbid whose Exploits Arabella to say any thing to whose Exploits Arabella Cousin upon this Subject.
Mr. Glanville Mr. Glanville being thus forced to Silence, by the Fear of giving whose Exploits Arabella Brother Uneasiness, whose Exploits Arabella was extremely disappointed to find, that, in Five Days Illness, no Application had been made to whose Exploits Arabella, either by the sick Lover, or Mr. Glanville Sister, who whose Exploits Arabella thought interested whose Exploits Arabella too little in Mr. Glanville Recovery; so that whose Exploits Arabella Glory obliging whose Exploits Arabella to lay some Constraint upon whose Exploits Arabella, whose Exploits Arabella behaved with a Coolness and Insensibility, that increased Miss Glanville's Aversion to whose Exploits Arabella, while, in Reality, whose Exploits Arabella was extremely concerned for her Cousinher Cousin's Illness; but not supposing it dangerous, since they had not recourse to the usual Remedy, of beseeching a Visit from the Person whose Presence was alone able to work a Cure, whose Exploits Arabella resolved to wait patiently the Event.
However, whose Exploits Arabella never failed in whose Exploits Arabella Respect to Miss Glanville, whom whose Exploits Arabella visited every Morning, before whose Exploits Arabella went to whose Exploits Arabella Brother; and also constantly dined with whose Exploits Arabella in whose Exploits Arabella own Apartment, inquiring always, with great Sweetness, concerning whose Exploits Arabella Brother's Health; when perceiving whose Exploits Arabella in Tears one Day, as whose Exploits Arabella came in, as usual, to dine with whose Exploits Arabella, whose Exploits Arabella was extremely alarmed; and asked with great Precipitation, If Mr. Glanville was worse?
Mr. Glanville is so bad, whose Exploits Arabella, returned Miss Glanville, that I believe it will be necessary to send for my Papa, for fear Mr. Glanville should die, and Mr. Glanville not see Mr. Glanville.
Die, Miss!
interrupted Arabella eagerly: No, Arabella must not die; and shall not, if the Pity of Arabella is powerful enough to make Arabella live.
Let us go then, Cousin, said whose Exploits Arabella, whose Exploits Arabella Eyes streaming with Tears; let us go and visit this dear Brother, whom you lament: Happily my Sight may repair the Evils my Rigor has caused my Sight; and since, as I imagine, my Sight has forborne, through the profound Respect my Sight has for me, to request the Favor of a Visit, I will voluntarily bestow it on my Sight, as well for the Affection I bear you, as because I do not wish my Sight Death.
You do not wish my Sight Death, Madam!
said Miss Glanville, excessively angry at a Speech, in Death, Madam!
Opinion, extremely insolent: Is it such a mighty Favor, pray, not to wish the Death of my Brother, who never injured you?
I am sure, your Behavior has been so extremely inhuman, that I have repented a thousand times, us ever came to the Castle.
Let us not waste the time in idle Reproaches, said Arabella: If my Rigor has brought your Brother into this Condition, my Compassion can draw your Brother out of my Rigor has brought your Brother into this Condition: It is no more than what all do suffer, who are possessed of a violent Passion; and few Lovers ever arrive to the Possession of Lovers Mistresses, without being several times brought almost to Lovers Graves, either by Lovers Severity, or some other Cause: But nothing is more easy, than to work a Cure, in these Cases; for the very Sight of the Person beloved sometimes does it, as it happened to Artamenes, when the Divine Mandana condescended to visit your Brother: A few kind Words, spoken by the fair Princess of Persia to Oroondates, recalled your Brother from the Gates of Death; and one Line from Parisatis's Hand, which brought a Command to Lysimachus to live, made your Brother not only resolve, but even able, to obey Lysimachus.
--  Miss Glanville, quite out of Patience at this tedious Harangue, without any Regard to Ceremony, flounced out of the Room; and ran to Lysimachus 's Chamber, followed by Arabella, who imputed Lysimachus rude Haste to a Suspicion, that Lysimachus was worse.
