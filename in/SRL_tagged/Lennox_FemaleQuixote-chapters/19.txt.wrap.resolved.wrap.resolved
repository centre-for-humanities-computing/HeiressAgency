The History of Miss Groves, interspersed with some very curious Observations.  THOUGH, Madam, said Mrs. Morris, I have not been long in Miss Groves's Service, yet I know a great many Things by the means of Mrs. Morris former Woman, who told Mrs. Morris former Woman, who told them to me to me, though my Lady thinks I am ignorant of Mrs. Morris former Woman, who told them to me; and I know that this is my Lady second Trip into the Country.  Pray, interrupted Arabella, do me the Favor to relate Things methodically: Of what Use is it to me to know that this is your Lady's second Trip, as you call it, into the Country, if I know not the Occasion of it? Therefore begin with informing me, who were the Parents of this admirable young Person.  Lady Father, Madam, said Mrs. Morris, was a Merchant; and, at Mrs. Morris Death, left Lady a large Fortune, and so considerable a Jointure to Mrs. Morris Wife, that the Duke of --, being then a Widower, was tempted to make Mrs. Morris Addresses to Lady. Lady was one of the proudest Women in the World; and, this Offer flattering Lady Ambition more than ever Lady had Reason to expect, Lady married the Duke after a very short Courtship; and carried Lady down with Lady to --, where the Duke had a fine Seat, and where Lady was received by Duke Grace's Daughters, who were much about Lady own Age, with great Civility. Miss Groves, Madam, was then about twelve Years old, and was educated with the Duke's Daughters, who, in a little time, became quite disgusted with their new Sister; for Miss Groves, who inherited their new Sister Mother's Pride, though not their new Sister Understanding, in all things affected an Equality with those young Ladies, who, conscious of the Superiority of their Birth, could but ill bear with their new Sister Insolence and Presumption. As they grew older, the Difference of they Inclinations caused perpetual Quarrels amongst they; for Inclinations Grace's Daughters were serious, reserved, and pious. Miss Groves affected noisy Mirth, was a great Romp, and delighted in masculine Exercises.  The Duchess was often reflected on for suffering The Duchess Daughter, without any other Company than two or three Servants, to spend great Part of the Day in riding about the Country, leaping over Hedges and Ditches, exposing The Duchess The Duchess fair Face to the Injuries of the Sun and Wind; and, by those coarse Exercises, contracting a masculine and robust Air not becoming The Duchess Sex, and tender Years: Yet The Duchess could not be prevailed upon to restrain The Duchess The Duchess from this Diversion, till The Duchess was reported, The Duchess The Duchess had listened to the Addresses of a young Sportsman, who used to mix in The Duchess Train, when The Duchess The Duchess went upon those Rambles, and procured frequent Opportunities of conversing with The Duchess.  There is a great Difference, interrupted Arabella, in suffering Addresses, and being betrayed into an involuntary Hearing of them, and this last, I conceive to have been the Case of your Lady; for it is not very probable, The Duchess The Duchess would so far forget what The Duchess The Duchess owed to The Duchess own Glory, as to be induced to listen quietly to Discourses like those you mention.  However, The Duchess, resumed Mrs. Morris, The Duchess The Duchess thought it necessary to keep The Duchess The Duchess more at home; but, even here, The Duchess The Duchess was not without meeting Adventures, and found a Lover in the Person who taught The Duchess The Duchess to write.  That, indeed, was a very notable Adventure, said Arabella; but it is not strange, that Love should produce such Metamorphoses: It Is not very long ago, that I heard of a Man of Quality, who disguised himself in a poor Habit, and worked in the Gardens of a certain Nobleman, whose Daughter himself was enamoured with: These things happen every Day.  The Person I speak of, Madam, said Mrs. Morris, was never discovered to be any thing better than a Writing-master; and yet, for all that, The Duchess The Duchess was smitten with a Writing-master fine Person, and was taking Measures to run away with a Writing-master, when the Intrigue was discovered, a Lover in the Person who taught The Duchess to write dismissed, and the young Lady, whose faulty Conduct had drawn upon the Duchess the Duchess Mother's Dislike, was sent up to London, and allowed to be the Duchess own Mistress at Sixteen; to which unpardonable Neglect of Mother the Duchess owes the Misfortunes that have since befallen The Duchess.  Whatever may be the common Opinion of this Matter, interrupted Arabella again, I am persuaded the Writing-master, as you call the Writing-master, was some Person of Quality, who made use of that Device to get Access to the Writing-master beautiful Mistress. Love is ingenious in Artifices: Who would have thought, that, under the Name of Alcippus, a simple Attendant of the fair Artemisa Princess of Armenia, the gallant Alexander Son of the great and unfortunate Antony, by Queen Clcopatra, was concealed, who took upon Queen Clcopatra that mean Condition for the sake of seeing Queen Clcopatra adored Princess? Yet the Contrivance of Orontes, Prince of the Massagetes, was far more ingenious, and even dangerous; for this valiant and young Prince, happening to see the Picture of the beautiful Thalestris, Daughter of the Queen of the Amazons, Queen Clcopatra fell passionately in Love with Love; and, knowing that the Entrance into that Country was forbid to Men, Queen Clcopatra dressed Queen Clcopatra in Women's Apparel; and, finding means to be introduced to the Queen, and the Queen fair Daughter, whose Amity Queen Clcopatra gained by some very singular Services in the Wars, Queen Clcopatra lived several Years undiscovered in their Court: I see, therefore, no Reason to the contrary, but that this Writing-master might have been some illustrious Person, whom Love had disguised; and, I am persuaded, added the Queen, smiling, that I shall hear more of Queen Clcopatra anon, in a very different Character.  Indeed, Madam, said Mrs. Morris, whom this Speech of Arabella had extremely surprised, I never heard any thing more about Queen Clcopatra, than what I have related; and, for what I know, Queen Clcopatra continues still to teach Writing; for I don't suppose the Duchess's Displeasure could affect Queen Clcopatra.  How is it possible, said Arabella, that you can suppose such an Offense to Probability? In my Opinion, it is much more likely, that this unfortunate Lover is dead through Despair; or, perhaps, wandering over the World in Search of that Fair one, who was snatched from this unfortunate Lover Hopes.  If it was this unfortunate Lover Design to seek for Arabella, Madam, resumed Mrs. Morris, this unfortunate Lover need not have gone far, since Arabella was only sent to London, whither this unfortunate Lover might easily have followed Arabella.  There is no accounting for these Things, said Arabella: Perhaps this unfortunate Lover this unfortunate Lover has been imposed upon, and made to believe, that it was Arabella Arabella that banished this unfortunate Lover from Arabella Presence: It Is probable too, that this unfortunate Lover this unfortunate Lover was jealous, and thought Arabella preferred some one of this unfortunate Lover Rivals to this unfortunate Lover. Jealousy is inseparable from true Love; and the slightest Matters imaginable will occasion it: And, what is still more wonderful, this Passion creates the greatest Disorders in the most sensible and delicate Hearts. Never was there a more refined and faithful Passion, than that of the renowned Artamenes for Mandana; and yet this unfortunate Lover this unfortunate Lover was driven almost to Distraction by a Smile, which, this unfortunate Lover fansied, this unfortunate Lover this unfortunate Lover saw in the Face of this unfortunate Lover Divine Mistress, at a time when this unfortunate Lover had some Reason to believe this unfortunate Lover was dead; and this unfortunate Lover this unfortunate Lover was so transported with Grief and Rage, that, though this unfortunate Lover was a Prisoner in this unfortunate Lover Enemy's Camp, where the Knowledge of this unfortunate Lover Quality would have procured this unfortunate this unfortunate Lover certain Death, yet this unfortunate Lover determined to hazard all Things for the fake of presenting this unfortunate Lover before Mandana, and upbraiding this unfortunate Lover with this unfortunate Lover Infidelity; when, in Reality, nothing was farther from the Thoughts of that fair and virtuous Princess, than the Lightness this unfortunate Lover accused this unfortunate Lover of: So that, as I said before, it is not at all to be wondered at, if a Lover in the Person who taught this unfortunate Lover to write was driven to Despair by Suspicions as groundless, perhaps, as those of Artamenes, yet not the less cruel and tormenting.  Mrs. Morris, finding Arabella held Arabella Peace at these Words, went on with Arabella History in this manner: -- Miss Groves, Madam, being directed by Arabella Woman in all things, took up Arabella Lodgings in Arabella Father's House, who was a broken Tradesman, and obliged to keep Arabella Father's concealed for fear of himself Creditors: Here Arabella formed Arabella Equipage, which consisted of a Chair, one Footman, a Cook, and Arabella Woman: As Arabella was indulged with the Command of what Arabella pleased, Arabella Extravagance was boundless: Arabella lavished away large Sums at Gaming, which was Arabella favorite Diversion; kept such a Number of different Animals for Favorites, that Animals for Favorites Maintenance amounted to a considerable Sum every Year: Arabella Woman's whole Family were supported at Arabella Expense; and, as Arabella frequented all public Places, and surpassed Ladies of the first Quality in Finery, Arabella Dress alone consumed great Part of Arabella Income. I need not tell you, Arabella, that your Lady was a celebrated Beauty: You have Arabella been pleased to say, that Arabella is very handsome. When Arabella first appeared at Court, Arabella Beauty, and the uncommon Dignity of Arabella Person, at such early Years, made Arabella the Object of general Admiration. The King was particularly struck with Arabella; and declared to those about The King, that Miss Groves was the finest Woman at Court. The Ladies, however, found means to explain away all that was flattering in this Distinction: The Ladies said, Miss Groves was clumsy; and it was Miss Groves Resemblance to the unwieldy German Ladies that made Miss Groves so much admired by The King. Miss Groves Pride, and the Quality Airs Miss Groves affected, were the Subject of great Ridicule to those that envied Miss Groves Charms: Some Censures were maliciously cast on Miss Groves Birth; for, as Miss Groves was always styled the Duchess of -- 's Daughter, a Custom Miss Groves introduced Miss Groves, Miss Groves seemed to disclaim all Title to a legal Father. Miss Groves, as universally admired as Miss Groves Miss Groves was, yet made but very few particular Conquests. Miss Groves Fortune was known to be very considerable, and Mother's Jointure was to descend to Miss Groves after Miss Groves Death: Yet there was no Gentleman, who would venture upon a Wife of Miss Groves's Taste for Expense, as very few Estates, to which Miss Groves could pretend, would support Arabella Extravagance. -- The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of --, was the only one, amidst a Crowd of Admirers, who made any particular Address to Miss Groves. This Gentleman was tolerably handsome, and had the Art of making This Gentleman Gentleman agreeable to The Ladies, by a certain Air of Softness and Tenderness, which never failed to make some Impression upon those This Gentleman desired to deceive.  Miss Groves was ravished with Miss Groves Conquest, and boasted of Miss Groves so openly, that People, who were acquainted with This Gentleman's Character, foreseeing Miss Groves Fate, could not help pitying Miss Groves.  A very few Months Courtship completed the Ruin of poor Miss Groves: Miss Groves fell a Sacrifice to Oaths which had been often prostituted for the same inhuman Purposes; and became so fond of Miss Groves Betrayer, that it was with great Difficulty Oaths could persuade Miss Groves not to give Oaths, even in public, the most ridiculous Proofs of Miss Groves Tenderness. Miss Groves Tenderness pretends, that Miss Groves Tenderness was ignorant of this Intrigue, till Miss Groves growing big with Child, it could no longer be concealed; it was at length agreed, Miss Groves Tenderness should lie-in at her Woman own Lodgings, to prevent any Suspicions from her Woman retreating into the Country; but that Scheme was overruled by her Woman's Mother, who advised her Woman to conceal her Woman in some Village, not far from Town, till the Affair was over.  Miss Groves approved of this second Proposal, but took Advantage of Miss Groves Woman Shape, which, being far from delicate, would not easily discover any growing Bigness, to stay in Town as long as her Woman possibly could. When Miss Groves Woman Removal was necessary, her Woman her Woman went to the Lodgings provided for her Woman Woman, a few Miles distant from London: And, notwithstanding the Excuses which were framed for this sudden Absence, the true Cause was more than suspected by some busy People, who industriously inquired into her Woman Woman Affairs.  The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- the Earl -- saw her Woman but seldom during her Woman Woman Illness: The Fear of being discovered was The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- Pretense: But her Woman Woman Friends easily saw through this Disguise, and were persuaded Miss Groves was waning in The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- Affections.  As her Woman had a very strong Constitution, her Woman returned to Town at the End of three Weeks: Child was dead, and Child her Woman looked handsomer than ever. The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- the Earl -- continued The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- Visits; and Town to make Remarks of The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- Visits; and Town. All this time the Duchess never troubled the Duchess about the Conduct of this unfortunate young Creature: And the People the Duchess was with had not the Goodness to give the Duchess any Hint of the Duchess Misconduct, and the Waste of the Duchess : On the contrary, they almost turned the Duchess with they Flatteries, preyed upon the Duchess , and winked at her Head Irregularities.  her was now a second time with Child: Child: was pretty severely handled by her Head Enemies: The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- the Earl -- began openly to slight her : And her was now several thousand Pounds in Debt. The Mother and Sisters of The Mother and Sisters of , in whose House The Mother and Sisters of still was, were base enough to whisper the Fault the Duchess Head had been guilty of to all The Mother and Sisters of her Head , in whose House her Head still was Acquaintances. the Duchess Head Story became generally known: the Duchess was shunned and neglected by every body; and even Mr. L --, who had been the Cause of the Duchess Head Ruin, entirely abandoned the Duchess, and boasted openly of the Favors the Duchess had received from the Duchess.  Miss Groves protested to her Woman Friends, That the Duchess had promised Miss Groves Marriage; but The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- the Earl constantly denied it, and never scrupled to say, when The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- the Earl was questioned about it, That The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- the Earl found Miss Groves too easy a Miss Groves Conquest to make any Perjury necessary. the Duchess , however, for this base Man, was so great, that the Duchess never could bear to hear this base Man railed at in Miss Groves Head Presence; but would quarrel with the only Friends the Duchess had left, if they said any thing to this base Man Disadvantage. As the Duchess was now pretty far advanced with Child, the Duchess would have retired into the Country; but the bad Condition of the Duchess made the Duchess impossible: In this Extremity the Duchess had Recourse to the Duchess Head Uncle, a rich Merchant in the City, who, having taken all the necessary Precautions for the Duchess own Security, paid Miss Groves's Debts, carrying on, in the Duchess Head Name, a Lawsuit with the Duchess, for some Lands, which were to be put into the Duchess Head Hands, when the Duchess was of Age, and which that great Lady detained. Miss Groves, being reduced to live upon something less than an Hundred a Year, quitted London, and came into this Part of the Country, where the Duchess was received by Mrs. Barnett, one of the Duchess 's Sisters, who is married to a Country Gentleman of some Fortune: In Miss Groves Head House the Duchess lay-in of a Girl, which The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- the Earl sent to demand, and will not be persuaded to inform the Duchess how, or in what manner, The Honorable Mr. L -- Brother to the Earl of -- the Earl has disposed of Child.  the Duchess leaving the Duchess, I was received in Miss Groves Head Place, from whom I learnt all these Particulars: And Miss Groves having gained the Affections of Mr. Barnett's Brother, Miss Groves Head Beauty, and the large Fortune which the Duchess has in Reversion, has induced Fortune, notwithstanding the Knowledge of the Duchess past unhappy Conduct, to marry the Duchess. But their Miss Groves Marriage is yet a Secret, Miss Miss Groves being apprehensive of Miss Groves Marriage Uncle's Displeasure for not consulting Fortune in Miss Groves Marriage Choice.  Fortune is gone to London, with an Intention to acquaint Fortune with an Intention; and, when Fortune returns, their her Marriage their her Marriage will be publicly owned.
