Some Reflections very fit, and others very unfit for an Assembly-Room.
YOU speak in strange Terms, replied Arabella, blushing, of a Princess, who if Arabella was not the most reserved and severe Person in the World, was yet nevertheless, absolutely chaste.
I know there were People who represented Arabella Partiality for Ovid in a very unfavourable Light; but that ingenious Poet, when he related he History to the great Agrippa, told he in Confidence all that had passed between he and the Princess Julia, than which nothing could be more innocent though a little indiscreet.
For, it is certain that the Princess Julia permitted he to love the Princess Julia, and did not condemn he to any rigorous Punishment for daring to tell the Princess Julia so; yet, for all this, as I said before, though the Princess Julia was not altogether so austere as the Princess Julia ought to have been, yet the Princess Julia was nevertheless a most virtuous Princess.
Mr. Selvin, not daring to contradict a Lady whose extensive Reading had furnished Lady with Anecdotes unknown almost to any Body else, by Mr. Selvin Silence confessed the Princess Julia Superiority.
But Mr. Glanville, who knew all these Anecdotes were drawn from Romances, which Mr. Selvin found contradicted the known Facts in History, and assigned the most ridiculous Causes for Things of the greatest Importance; could not help smiling at the Facility with which Mr. Selvin gave into those idle Absurdities.
For notwithstanding Mr. Selvin Affectation of great Reading, Mr. Selvin superficial Knowledge of History made it extremely easy to deceive Mr. Selvin; and as it was Mr. Selvin Custom to mark in Mr. Selvin Pocketbook all the Scraps of History Mr. Selvin heard introduced into Conversation, and retail them again in other Company; Mr. Selvin did not doubt but Mr. Selvin would make a Figure with the curious Circumstances Arabella had furnished Mr. Selvin with.
Arabella observing Mr. Tinsel by Mr. Tinsel familiar Bows, significant Smiles, and easy Salutations, was acquainted with the greatest Part of the Assembly, told Mr. Tinsel, that Arabella did not doubt but Mr. Tinsel knew the Adventures of many Persons whom many Persons were viewing; and that Mr. Tinsel would do Arabella a Pleasure, if Mr. Tinsel would relate some of many Persons.
Mr. Tinsel was charmed with a Request which afforded Mr. Tinsel an Opportunity of gratifying a favorite Inclination, and seating Mr. Tinsel near Arabella immediately, was beginning to obey Arabella Injunctions, when Arabella gracefully entreated Mr. Tinsel to stay a Moment; and calling to Mr. Glanville and Mr. Tinsel Sister, who were talking to Mr. Selvin, asked Mr. Glanville and his Sister, who were talking to Mr. Selvin if Mr. Glanville and his Sister, who were talking to Mr. Selvin chose to partake of a more rational Amusement than Dancing, and listen to the Adventures of some illustrious Persons, which Mr. Tinsel had promised to relate.
I assure you, Arabella, said Mr. Glanville, smiling, you will find that a less innocent Amusement than Dancing.
Why so, Mr. Tinsel, replied Arabella, since it is not an indiscreet Curiosity which prompts me to a Desire of hearing the Histories Mr. Tinsel has promised to entertain me with; but rather a Hope of hearing something which may at once improve and delight me; something which may excite my Admiration, engage my Esteem, or influence my Practice.
'Twas doubtless, with such Motives as these, that we find Princesses and Ladies of the most illustrious Rank, in Clelia and the Grand Cyrus, listening to the Adventures of Persons, in whom they were probably as little interested, as we are in these around we.
Kings, Princes, and Commanders of Armies, thought it was no Waste of Kings, Princes, and Commanders of Armies Time, in the midst of the Hurry and Clamor of a Camp, to listen many Hours to the Relation of one single History, and not filled with any extraordinary Events; but happily a simple Recital of common Occurrences: The great Cyrus, while he was busy in reducing all Asia to he Yoke, heard nevertheless, the Histories of all the considerable Persons in a Camp, besides those of Strangers, and even he Enemies.
If there was therefore any thing either criminal or mean, in hearing the Adventures of others, do you imagine so many great and illustrious Persons would have given in to such an Amusement?
After this Arabella turned gravely about to Mr. Tinsel, and told Mr. Tinsel, Mr. Tinsel was at Liberty to begin Mr. Tinsel .
The Beau, a little disconcerted by the Solemnity with which Arabella requested Mr. Tinsel Information, knew not how to begin with the Formality that Mr. Tinsel saw was required of Mr. Tinsel; and therefore fat silent for a few Moments; which Arabella supposed was to recall to Mr. Tinsel Memory all the Passages Mr. Tinsel proposed to relate.
Mr. Tinsel Perplexity would probably have increased instead of lessening by the profound Silence which His Perplexity observed, had not Miss Glanville seated His Perplexity with a sprightly Air on the other Side of Mr. Tinsel, and directing Mr. Tinsel Eyes to a tall handsome Woman that had just entered, asked Mr. Tinsel pleasantly, to tell His Perplexity History if Mr. Tinsel knew it.
Mr. Tinsel, brought into Mr. Tinsel usual Track by this Question, answered smiling, That her History was yet a Secret, or known but to very few; but my Intelligence, added my Intelligence, is generally the (...), and may always be depended on.
Perhaps, said (...) His Perplexity is one of your Acquaintances, (...) you with the Recital of His Perplexity (...) from His Perplexity own Mouth.
No, really, Madam, answered Mr. Tinsel, surpised at the great Simplicity of Arabella, for so Mr. Tinsel understood it; His Perplexity, I believe, is not so communicative: And to say the Truth, I should not choose to hear His Perplexity Adventures from His Perplexity, since His Perplexity certainly would suppress the most material Circumstances.
In a Word, said Mr. Tinsel, lowering Mr. Tinsel Voice, His Perplexity His Perplexity was for many Years the Mistress of a young military Nobleman, whom His Perplexity was so complaisant to follow in all his Campaigns, Marches, Sieges, and every Inconveniency of War: his married His Perplexity in Gibraltar, from whence his is lately arrived, and introduced his His Perplexity to his noble Brother, by whom His Perplexity was not unfavourably received.
It Is worth remarking, that this same haughty Peer thought sit to resent with implacable Obstinacy, the Marriage of another of his Brothers, with the Widow of a brave Officer, of considerable Rank in the Army.
It Is true, His Perplexity was several Years older than the young Lord, and had no Fortune; but His Perplexity assigned other Reasons for his Displeasure: his complained loudly, that his Brother had dishonored the Nobility of his Brother Birth, by this Alliance, and continued his Brother Resentment till the Death of the young Hero, who gave many remarkable Proofs of his Brother Courage and Fortitude upon several Occasions, and died gloriously before the Walls of Carthagena; leaving his Brother disconsolate Lady a Widow a second Time, with the Acquisition of a Title indeed, but a very small Addition to His Perplexity Fortune.
Observe that gay, splendid Lady, I beseech you, Madam, pursued his, turning to Arabella; how affectedly Arabella looks and talks, and throws Arabella Eyes around the Room, with a haughty Self-sufficiency in Arabella Aspect, and insolent Contempt for every Thing but Arabella.
Arabella Habit, Arabella Speech, Arabella Motions, are all French; nothing in England is able to please Arabella; the People so dull, so aukwardly polite, the Manners so gross; no Delicacy, no Elegance, no Magnificence in their Persons, Houses, or Diversions; every Thing is so distasteful, there is no living in such a Place.
One may crawl about, indeed, Arabella says, and make a shift to breathe in the odious Country, but one cannot be said to live; and with all the Requisites to render Life delightful, here, one can only suffer, not enjoy it.
Would one not imagine, pursued one, His Perplexity His Perplexity was a Person of very exalted Rank, who has the Sanction of Birth, Riches, and Grandeur for His Perplexity extraordinary Pride; and yet His Perplexity is no other than the Daughter of an Innkeeper at Spa, and had the exalted Post assigned His Perplexity of attending new Lodgers to their Apartments, acquainting their with all the Conveniences of the Place, answering an humble Question or two concerning what Company was in the Town, what Scandal was stirring, and the like.
One of our great Sea Commanders going thither for his Health, happened to lodge at this Inn; and was so struck with His Perplexity Charms, that his married His Perplexity in a few Weeks, and soon after brought His Perplexity to England.
Such was the Origin of His Perplexity; whose insupportable Pride and ridiculous Affectation, draws Contempt and Aversion whereshe appears.
Did I not tell you, Madam, interrupted Mr. Glanville, that the Amusement you had chose was not so innocent as Dancing?
What a deal of Scandal has Mr. Tinsel uttered in the Compass of a few Minutes?
I assure you, replied Arabella, I know not what to make of the Histories Arabella has been relating.
I think the Histories he has been relating do not deserve that Name, and are rather detatched Pieces of Satire on particular Persons, than a serious Relation of Facts.
I confess my Expectations from this Gentleman have not been answered.
I think, however, Madam, said Mr. Glanville, we may allow that there is a negative Merit in the Relations Mr. Tinsel has made; for, if Mr. Tinsel has not shown we any Thing to approve, Mr. Tinsel has at least shown we what to condemn.
The Ugliness of Vice, replied Arabella, ought only to be represented to the Vicious; to whom Satire, like a magnifying Glass, may aggravate every Defect, in order to make every Defect Deformity appear more hideous; but since every Defect End is only to reprove and amend, every Defect should never be addressed to any but those who come within every Defect Correction, and may be the better for it: A virtuous Mind need not be shown the Deformity of Vice, to make it be hated and avoided; the more pure and uncorrupted our Ideas are, the less shall we be insluenc'd by Example.
A natural Propensity to Virtue or Vice often determines the Choice: It Is sufficient therefore to show a good Mind what it ought to pursue, though a bad one must be told what to avoid.
In a Word, one ought to be always incited, the other always restrained.
I vow, Lady Bella, said Miss Glanville, you would make one think one came here to hear a Sermon; you are so very grave, and talk upon such high-flown Subjects.
What Harm was there in what Mr. Tinsel was telling us?
It would be hard indeed, if one might not divert one's self with other Peoples Faults.
I am afraid, Miss, said Arabella, those who can divert Arabella, those who can divert themselves with the Faults of others with the Faults of others, are not behind hand in affording Diversion.
And that very Inclination, added Miss, smilingly, to hear other Peoples Faults, may by those very People, be condemned as one, and afford may by those very People the same Kind of ill-natured Pleasure you are so desirous of.
Nay, Madam, returned Miss Glanville, your Ladyship was the first who introduced the Discourse you condemn so much.
Did not you desire Mr. Tinsel to tell you Histories about Company; and ask my brother and me, to come and hear Histories about the Company?
It Is true, ArabellaArabella, that I did desire you to partake with Arabella of a pleasing and rational Amusement, for such I imagined Histories about the Company might afford; far from a Detail of Vices, Follies, and Irregularities, I expected to have heard the Adventures of some illustrious Personages related; between whose Actions, and those of the Heroes and Heroines of Antiquity, I might have found some Resemblance.
For Instance, I hoped to have heard imitated the sublime Courage of a Clelia, who, to save her Honor from the Attempts of the impious Tarquin, leaped into the River Tyber, and swam to the other Side; or the noble Resolution of the incomparable Candace, who, to escape out of the Hands of her Ravisher, the Pirate Zenadorus, set Fire to his Vessel with her own Hands, and committed her to the Mercy of the Waves: Or, the Constancy and Affection of a Mandana, who, for the Sake of a Cyrus, refused the richest Crowns in the World, and braved the Terrors of Death to preserve her for the Terrors of Death.
As for the Men, I hoped to have heard of some who might have almost equaled the great Oroondates, the invincible Artaban, the valiant Juba, the renowned Alcamenes, and many thousand Heroes of Antiquity; whose glorious Exploits in War, and unsaken Constancy in Love, have given some who might have almost equaled the great Oroondates, the invincible Artaban, the valiant Juba, the renowned Alcamenes, and many thousand Heroes of Antiquity; whose glorious Exploits in War, and unsaken Constancy in Love an immortal Fame.
While Arabella was uttering this long Speech, with great Emotion, Miss Glanville, with a sly Look at the Beau, gave the Beau to understand, that was her Cousin's Foible.
Mr. Tinsel, however, not able to comprehend the Meaning of what her said, listened to her with many Signs of Perplexity and Wonder.
Mr. Selvin in secret repined at her prodigious Knowledge of History; and Mr. Glanville, with Mr. Selvin Eyes fixed on the Ground, bit Mr. Selvin Lips almost through with Madness.
In the mean Time, several among Company, desirous of hearing what His Perplexity His Perplexity was saying so loud, and with so much Eagerness and Emotion, gathered round them; which Mr. Glanville observing, and fearing Arabella would expose Arabella still farther, whispered Arabella Sister to get his Sister away if possible.
Miss Glanville, though very unwilling, obeyed Miss Glanville Injunctions; and complaining of a sudden Headache, Arabella immediately proposed retiring, which was joyfully complied with by Mr. Glanville, who with the other Gentlemen attended the other Gentlemen home.
