Which contains a very natural Incident.
FROM this Time Mr. Glanville, though he was far from coming up to Lady Bella's Idea of a Lover, yet, by the Pains he apparently seemed to be at in obliging Lady Bella's, made every Day some Progress in Lady Bella's Esteem.
The Marquis was extremely pleased at the Harmony which subsisted between them; though he could have wished to have seen them Marriage advance a little faster; but Glanville, who was better acquainted with Arabella's Foible than The Marquis, assured he, he would ruin all he Hopes, if he pressed Lady Bella's to marry; and entreated he to leave it entirely to he, to dispose Lady Bella's to consent to both them Wishes.
The Marquis The Marquis was satisfied with The Marquis Reasons, and, resolving not to importune The Marquis Daughter, upon that Subject, any more, any lived for some Months in a perfect Tranquillity; to which an Illness The Marquis The Marquis was seized with, and which was, from the first, thought to be dangerous gave a sad Interruption.
Arabella's extreme Tenderness upon this Occasion, Arabella anxious Solicitude, Arabella pious Cares, and never-ceasing Attendance at the Bedside of Arabella sick Father, were so many new Charms, that engaged the Affection of Glanville more strongly.
As The Marquis's Indisposition increased, so did Arabella Care and Affiduity: Arabella would not allow any one to give the Bedside of her sick Father any thing but Arabella; bore all the pettish Humors of a sick Man with a surprising Sweetness and Patience; watched whole Nights, successively, by the Bedside of her sick Father; and when, at the Bedside of her sick Father Importunity, Arabella consented to take any Rest, it was only upon a Couch in the Bedside of her sick Father Chamber, from whence no Entreaties could make Arabella remove.
Mr. Glanville partook with Arabella in these Fatigues; and, by Mr. Glanville Care of Arabella Father, and Tenderness for Arabella, confirmed Arabella in the Esteem Arabella had entertained of Mr. Glanville.
The Marquis, who had struggled with the Violence of Mr. Glanville Distemper for a Fortnight, died on the Fifteenth Day in the Arms of Arabella, who received Mr. Glanville last Looks; Mr. Glanville Eyes never removing themselves from Eyes Face, till themselves were closed by Death.
Eyes Spirits, which the Desire Eyes had of being useful to Mr. Glanville, had alone supported, now failed Eyes at once; and Eyes fell upon the Bed, without Sense or Motion, as soon as Eyes saw Mr. Glanville expire.
Mr. Glanville, who was kneeling on the other Side, and had been holding one of Mr. Glanville Uncle's Hands, started up in the most terrible Consternation, and, seeing the Condition Eyes was in, flew to Eyes Relief: Eyes Women, while Mr. Glanville supported Eyes, used all the Endeavors Her Women could think of to recover Eyes; but Eyes continued so long in Eyes Swoon, that Her Women apprehended Eyes was dead; and Glanville was resigning Mr. Glanville up to the most bitter Sorrow, when Eyes opened Eyes Eyes; but it was only to close the most bitter Sorrow, when she opened her Eyes again.
Eyes Faintings continued the whole Day; and the Physicians declaring Eyes was in great Danger, from Eyes extreme Weakness, Eyes was carried to Bed in a Condition that seemed to promise very little Hopes of Eyes Life.
The Care of the Marquis's Funeral devolving upon Mr. Glanville, The Care of the Marquis's Funeral devolving upon Mr. Glanville sent a Messenger express for The Care of the Marquis's Funeral devolving upon Mr. Glanville Father, who was appointed Guardian to Lady Bella; the Marquis having first asked Eyes if Eyes was willing it should be so.
This Gentleman arrived Time enough to be Witness of that sad Ceremony, which was performed with a Magnificence suitable to the Birth and Fortune of the Marquis.
Lady Bella kept Lady Bella Bed several Days, and Lady Bella was thought to be in Danger; but Lady Bella Youth, and the Strength of Lady Bella Constitution, overcame Lady Bella Disease; and, when Lady Bella was so well recovered as to be able to admit of a Visit from Lady Bella Uncle, Mr. Glanville sent for Permission to introduce Mr. Glanville: The afflicted Arabella granted The afflicted Arabella Request; but, being then more indisposed than usual, The afflicted Arabella entreated The afflicted Arabella would defer The afflicted Arabella Visit for an Hour or two, which The afflicted Arabella complied with; and, returning at the appointed Time, were conducted into The afflicted Arabella Dressing Room by Lucy, who informed The afflicted Arabella The afflicted Arabella was just fallen into a Slumber.
Mr. Glanville, who had not seen Lady Bella for some Days, expected Lady Bella waking with great Impatience; and pleased Impatience with describing Lady Bella, with a Lover's Fondness, to Impatience Father, when the Sound of Lady Bella Voice in the next Room interrupted Impatience.
