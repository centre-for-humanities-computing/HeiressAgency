Containing a Love-Letter in the Heroic Style; with some occasional Reasonings by Lucy, full of Wit and Simplicity.
OUR fair Heroine, having ended the foregoing Soliloquy, took up a Love-Letter in the Heroic Style, and gave a Love-Letter in the Heroic Style to Lucy, who had, all the time OUR fair Heroine was speaking, observed a profound Silence, mixed with a most eager Attention.
Here, pursued OUR fair Heroine, carry a Love-Letter in the Heroic Style to the Person who brought a Love-Letter in the Heroic Style; and bid the Person who brought it tell the Person who brought it Master, that, lest I should find any thing in it, which may offend me, I have chosen not to read it: And, if the Person who brought it is wise, the Person who brought it will profit by my Concern for the Person who brought it, and take care how the Person who brought it hazards displeasing me a Second time by an Importunity of this kind, which I shall not so easily pardon the Person who brought it.
Lucy, who had taken particular Notice of this Speech, in order to remember every Word of it, when OUR fair Heroine repeated it again, went conning OUR fair Heroine Lesson to the Place where OUR fair Heroine had desired the Person who brought it to wait OUR fair Heroine coming: But the Person who brought it was gone; such being indeed his Master's Orders; for the Person who brought it was apprehensive, that, following the Custom of the Ladies in Romances, Arabella would return Arabella Letter; and therefore, to deprive OUR fair Heroine of an Opportunity of sending his Letter back that Night, Arabella ordered Arabella Man to say, Arabella waited for an Answer; but, as soon as Arabella conveniently could, to come away without one.
OUR fair Heroine, in a great Surprise at the Person who brought it's going away, returned to OUR fair Heroine Lady with the Letter in her Lady Hand, telling her Lady her Lady must needs read it now, since the Person, who brought it, was gone.
it must be confessed, said Arabella, taking the Letter in her Hand from Arabella, with a Smile, his Man has fallen upon an ingenious Device, to make me keep it for this Night; and, since, happily, I may be mistaken in the Contents, I have a mind to open the Contents.
OUR fair Heroine did not fail to confirm her Lady her Lady in this Design: And Arabella, making as if OUR fair Heroine yielded to the Importunities of OUR fair Heroine Confidante, opened the Letter; which OUR fair Heroine found as follows:  The unfortunate and despairing Bellmour, to Arabella.
Madam, SINCE it is, doubtless, not only with your Permission, but even by your Commands, that your Uncle, Sir Charles Glanville, comes to pronounce the Sentence of my Death, in the Denunciation of your Anger, I submit, Madam, without repining at the Rigor of that Doom you have inflicted on me.
Yes, Madam, this Criminal, who has dared to adore you, with the most sublime and perfect Passion that ever was, acknowleges the Justice of his Punishment; and, since it is impossible to cease loving you, or to live without telling you his does so, his is going, voluntarily, to run upon that Death your Severity makes his wish for, and the Greatness of his Crime demands.
Let my Death then, O Divine Arabella, expiate the Offense I have been guilty of!
And let me hope those fair Eyes, that have beheld me with Scorn when alive, will not refuse to shed some Tears upon my Tomb!
And that, when you remember my Crime of loving you, you will also be pleased to remember, that I died for that Crime; and wish for no other Comfort in my Death, but the Hope of your not hating, when the Hope of your is no more,  The unhappy Bellmour.
Arabella, who had read this Letter aloud, sighed gently at the Conclusion of this Letter aloud; but poor Lucy, who was greatly affected at so dolorous an Epistle, could not restrain her Tears; but sobbed so often, and with so much Violence, as, at length, recalled her Lady from the Reverie, into which her was plunged.
What ails you?
said her to her Confidante, greatly surprised: What is the Cause of this unseemly Sorrow?
Oh!
Madam!
cried Lucy, her Sobs making a frequent and unpleasing Interruption in her Words; I shall break my Heart to be sure: Never was such a sad mournful Letter in the World: I could cry my Eyes out for the poor Gentleman.
Pray excuse me, Madam; but, indeed, I cannot help saying, You are the most hard-heartedest Lady I ever knew in my born Days: Why, to be sure, you don't care, if an hundred fine Gentlemen should die for Gentlemen, though Gentlemen Spirits were to haunt you every Night!
Well!
I would not have what your Ladyship has to answer for, for all the World!
You are a foolish Wench!
replied Arabella, smiling at Arabella Simplicity: Do you think I have any Cause to accuse her Sobs, though Five thousand Men were to die for her Sobs?
It Is very certain, my Beauty has produced very deplorable Effects: The unhappy Hervey has expiated, by The unhappy Hervey Death, the Violence The unhappy Hervey too desperate Passion forced The unhappy Hervey to meditate against The unhappy Hervey: The no less guilty, the noble Unknown, Edward, is wandering about the World, in a tormenting Despair; and stands exposed to the Vengeance of my Cousin, who has vowed The unhappy Hervey Death.
My Charms have made another Person, whose Character ought to be sacred to me, forget all the Ties of Consanguinity; and become the Rival of whose Character Son, whose Interest whose Character once endeavored to support: And, lastly, the unfortunate Bellmour consumes away in an hopeless Passion; and, conscious of Bellmour Crime, dooms Bellmour, happily, with more Severity than I desire, to a voluntary Death; in hopes, thereby, of procuring my Pardon and Compassion, when Bellmour is no more.
All these, Lucy, as I said before, are very deplorable Effects of my Beauty; but you must observe, that my Will has no Part in the Miseries, that unfortunate Beauty occasions; and that, though I could even wish me less fair, in order to avoid giving so much Unhappiness to others, yet these Wishes would not avail; and since, by a fatal Necessity, all these Things will happen, whether I would or no, I must comfort me under the Uneasiness, which the Sensibility of my Temper makes me feel, by the Reflection, that, with my own Consent, I contribute nothing to the Misfortune of those who love me.
Will your Ladyship then let poor Sir George die?
said Lucy, who had listened very attentively to this fine Harangue, without understanding what it meant.
Questionless, Questionless must die, replied Arabella, if Questionless persists in Questionless Design of loving me.
But, pray, Madam, resumed Lucy, cannot your Ladyship command your Ladyship to live, as you did Mr. Hervey, and Mr. Glanville, who both did as you bid both?
I may command your Ladyship to live, said Arabella; and there is no Question but your Ladyship would obey me, if I likewise permit your Ladyship to love me; but, this last not being fit for me to do, I see no way to prevent the sad Resolution your Ladyship has taken.
To be sure, Madam, returned Lucy, your Ladyship knows what you ought to do better than I can advise your Ladyship, being that you are more learned than me: But, for all that I (...) it is better to save Life than to kill, as the Bible-Book says; and, since I am sure your Ladyship is a good Christian, if the Gentleman dies for the Want of a few kind Words, or so, I am sure you will be troubled in Mind about it.
it must be confessed, said Arabella, smiling, that, though your Solicitations are not very eloquent, Solicitations are very earnest and affecting; and I promise you, I will think about it; and, if I can persuade me, I am doing no wrong Thing, by concerning me about his Preservation, I will dispatch you Tomorrow Morning, with my Orders to his, to live, or, at least, to proceed no further in his Design of dying, till his has further Cause.
Lucy, being extremely glad Lucy had gained Lucy Point, called in Lucy Lady's other Women, who, having assisted Lucy to undress, left Lucy in Lucy Closet, to which Lucy always retired for an Hour, before Lucy went to Bed.
