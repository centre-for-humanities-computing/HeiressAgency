Which inculcates by a very good Example, that a Person ought not to be too hasty in deciding a Question Sir does not perfectly understand.
YOU are come very opportunely, a Question Sir, said.
Arabella, when a Question Sir entered the Room, to be Judge of a great Controversy between Miss Glanville and myself.
I beseech you therefore, let us have your Opinion upon the Matter.
Miss Glanville maintains, that it is less criminal in a Lady to hear Persons talk to Lady of Love, allow Persons to kiss Lady Hand, and permit Persons to write to a Lady, than to make a charitable Visit to a Man who is confined to a Man who is confined to a Man who is confined to a Man who is confined to his Bed through the Violence of his Passion and Despair Bed through the Violence of a Man who is confined to his Bed through the Violence of his Passion and Despair Passion and Despair Bed through the Violence of a Man who is confined to a Man who is confined to his Bed through the Violence of his Passion and Despair Bed through the Violence of a Man who is confined to his Bed through the Violence of his Passion and Despair Passion and Despair Passion and Despair Bed through the Violence of a Man who is confined to his Bed through the Violence of a Man who is confined to a Man who is confined to his Bed through the Violence of his Passion and Despair Bed through the Violence of a Man who is confined to his Bed through the Violence of his Passion and Despair Passion and Despair Passion and Despair Passion and Despair; the Intent of this Visit being only to prevent the Death of an unfortunate Lover, and, if necessary, to lay Lady Commands upon a Man who is confined to his Bed through the Violence of a Man who is confined to a Man who is confined to his Bed through the Violence of his Passion and Despair Bed through the Violence of a Man who is confined to his Bed through the Violence of his Passion and Despair Passion and Despair Passion and Despair to live.
And this latter is your Opinion, is it not a Lady?
said Miss Glanville.
Certainly, Sir, replied Arabella, and in this I am justified by all the Heroines of Antiquity.
Then you must be in the Right, Madam, returned Miss GlanvilleMiss Glanville, both because your own Judgment tells you so, and also the Example of all the Heroines of Antiquity you mention.
Well, a Lady, interrupted Miss Glanville Miss Glanville hastily, since my Brother has given Sentence on your Side, I hope you will not delay your Visit to Sir George any longer.
How!
said Mr. Glanville, surprised, is Lady Bella going to visit Sir George?
Pray, a Lady, may I presume to-inquire the Reason for your doing Sir George this extraordinary Favor?
You are not very wise, said Arabella, looking gravely upon Miss Glanville, to discover a Thing, which may happily create a Quarrel between my Brother, and the unfortunate Person you speak of: Yet since this Indiscretion cannot be recalled, we must endeavor to prevent the Consequences of it.
I assure you, a Lady, interrupted Mr. Glanville, extremely impatient to know the Meaning of these Hints, you have nothing to fear from me: Therefore you need not think a Lady under any Necessity of concealing this Affair from me.
You are not, happily, so moderate as you pretend, said Arabella, (who would not have been displeased to have seen him in all the jealous Transports of an enraged Orontes); but whatever ensues, I can no longer keep from your Knowledge, a Truth your Sister has begun to discover; but, in telling you what you desire to know, I expect you will suppress all Inclinations to Revenge, and trust the Care of your Interest to my Generosity.
You are to know then, that in the Person of your Friend Sir George, you have a Rival, happily the more to be feared, as your Friend Sir George is no less respectful than violent: I possibly tell you more than I ought, pursued Sister, blushing, and casting down Sister Eyes, when I confess, that for certain Considerations, wherein perhaps you are concerned, I have received the first Insinuation of him Passion with Disdain enough; and I assure Sister, that you are too generous to desire any Revenge upon a miserable Rival, of whom Death is going to free you.
Then, taking Sir George's Letter out of Sister Cabinet, Sister presented Sister Cabinet to Mr. Glanville.
Read this, SisterSister; but read Sister Cabinet Sister Cabinet without suffering yourself to be transported with any violent Motions of Anger: And as in Fight, I am persuaded you would not oppress a fallen and vanquished Foe; so in Love, I may hope, an unfortunate Rival will merit your Compassion.
Never doubt it, Sister, replied Mr. Glanville, receiving the Letter, which Miss Glanville, with a beating Heart, earnestly desired to hear read.
Sister Brother, after asking Permission of Arabella, prepared to gratify Sister Curiosity; but Her Brother no sooner read the first Sentence, than, notwithstanding all Sister Brother Endeavors, a Smile appeared in Sister Brother Face; and Miss Glanville, less able, and indeed less concerned to restrain Sister Mirth at the uncommon Style, burst out a laughing, with so much Violence, as obliged Her Brother to stop, and counterfeit a terrible Fit of Coughing, in order to avoid giving Arabella the like Offense.
The Astonishment of this Lady, at the surprising and unexpected Effect this Lady Lover's Letter produced on Miss Glanville, kept this Lady in a profound Silence, this Lady wandering from the Sister to the Sister ; who, continuing the Sister Brother Cough, was not able, for some Moments, to go on with the Sister Brother Reading.
Arabella, during this Interval, having recovered Arabella a little, asked Miss Glanville, if Arabella found any thing in a Lover's Despair, capable of diverting Arabella so much, as Arabella seemed to be with that of the unfortunate Sir George?
the Sister, said Miss Glanville, preventing Arabella Reply, knows so many of the unfortunate the unfortunate Sir Georgethe unfortunate Sir George Infidelities, that the unfortunate Sir George's Infidelities cannot persuade Sir George's Infidelities Sir George's Infidelities is really in such a dangerous Way as Sir George's Infidelities insinuates: Therefore you ought not to be surprised, if Sir George's Infidelities is rather disposed to laugh at this Epistle, than to be moved with any Concern for the Writer, who, though Sir George's Infidelities is my Rival, I must say, appears to be in a deplorable Condition.
Pray, Sir, resumed Arabella, a little composed by those Words, finish the Letter: the Sister the Sister may possibly find more Cause for Pity than Contempt, in the latter Part of it.
Miss Glanville, giving a Look to Mr. Glanville , sufficient to make the Sister the Sister comprehend, that Miss Glanville would have the Sister the Sister restrain Your Sister Mirth for the future, proceeded in Mr. Glanville Reading; but every Line increasing Miss Glanville strong Inclination to laugh, when Miss Glanville came to the pathetic Wish, that the Sister might shed some Tears upon Mr. Glanville Tomb, no longer able to keep Miss Glanville assumed Gravity, Miss Glanville threw down the Letter in a counterfeited Rage.
Curse the stupid Fellow!
cried Miss Glanville, is Mr. Glanville mad, to call the finest Black Eyes in the Universe, fair.
Ah!
Cousin, said Cousin to Arabella, to must be little acquainted with the Influence of the finest Black Eyes, since Cousin can so egregiously mistake their Color.
And it is very plain, replied Arabella, that you are little acquainted with the sublime Language in which Arabella writes, since you find Fault with an Epithet, which marks the Beauty, not the Color, of those Eyes Arabella praises; for, in fine, Fair is indifferently applied, as well to Black and Brown Eyes, as to Light and Blue ones, when they are either really lovely in they, or by the Lover's Imagination created so: And therefore, since Sir George's Prepossession has made Sir George's Prepossession see Charms in my Eyes, which questionless are not there; by calling they fair, Sir George's Prepossession has very happily expressed Sir George's Prepossession, since therein Sir George's Prepossession has the Sanction of those great Historians, who wrote the Histories of Lovers Sir George's Prepossession seems to imitate, as well in Sir George's Prepossession Actions as Style.
I find my Rival is very happy in your Opinion, Madam, said Mr. Glanville; and I am apt to believe, I shall have more Reason to envy than pity my Rival Situation.
If you keep within the Bounds I prescribe you, replied Arabella, you shall have no Reason to envy Arabella ; but, considering the Condition to which Arabella Despair has by this Time certainly reduced Arabella, Humanity requires that we should take some Care of Arabella; and, to show you how great my Opinion of your Generosity is, I will even entreat you to accompany me in the Visit I am going to make Arabella.
Mr. Glanville, being determined, if possible, to prevent Arabella exposing Arabella, affected to be extremely moved at this Request; and, rising from Arabella Chair in great seeming Agitation, traversed the Room for some Moments, without speaking a Word: Then suddenly stopping;  And can you, a Lady, said Arabella, looking upon Arabella, suppose, that I will consent to your visiting my RivalRival; and that I will be mean enough to attend you myself to Arabella House?
Do you think, that Orontes you have often reproached me with, would act in such a Manner?
I don't know how Orontes would have acted in this Case, said Arabella, because Orontes never happened that such a Proof of Orontes Submission was ever desired of Orontes; but, considering that Orontes was of a very fiery and jealous Disposition, it is probable Orontes might act as you do.
I always understood, a Lady, said Mr. Glanville, that Orontes was a Favorite of a Lady, but it seems I was mistaken.
You will be very unjust, said Arabella, to draw any unfavourable Conclusion from what I have said, to the Prejudice of that valiant Prince, for whom I confess I have a great Esteem; and truly whoever reflects upon the great Actions Orontes did in the Wars between the Amazons and the fierce Naobarzanes King of the Cilicians, must needs conceive a very high Idea of Orontes Virtue; but if I cannot bring the Example of Orontes to influence you in this Case, I can mention those of other Persons, no less illustrious for Persons Birth and Courage, than Orontes.
Did not the brave Memnon, when the brave Memnon Rival Oxyatres was sick, entreat the beautiful Barsina to favor the brave Memnon with a Visit?
And the complaisant Husband of the divine Parisatis was not contented with barely desiring the divine Parisatis to visit Lysimachus, who was dying with Despair at the divine Parisatis Marriage, but would many times bring the divine Parisatis the complaisant Husband of the divine Parisatis to the Bedside of a Lover, and, leaving the divine Parisatis there, give the complaisant Husband of the divine Parisatis an Opportunity of telling the divine Parisatis what the complaisant Husband of the divine Parisatis the divine Parisatis suffered for the divine Parisatis sake.
I am afraid, the divine Parisatis, said Mr. Glanville, I shall never be capable of imitating either the brave Memnon, nor the complaisant Lysimachus, in this Case, and the Humor of Orontes seems to Miss Glanville the most commendable.
Nevertheless, said Arabella, the Humor of Orontes cost the complaisant Husband of the divine Parisatis the divine Parisatis an infinite Number of Pains; and it may happen, you will as near resemble the complaisant Husband of the divine Parisatis in the complaisant Husband of the divine Parisatis Fortune as you do in the complaisant Husband of the divine Parisatis Disposition: But pray let us end this Dispute at present.
If you are not generous enough to visit an unfortunate Rival, you shall not put a Stop to the Charity of my Intentions; and since Miss Glanville Miss Glanville is all of a sudden become so severe, that the Charity of my Intentions my Intentions will not accompany me in the Visit, I shall be contented with the Attendance of my Women.
Saying this, the Charity of my Intentions my Intentions rose from the Charity of my Intentions Seat, calling Lucy, and ordered the Charity of my Intentions my Intentions to bid the Charity of my Intentions Companions attend.
Miss Glanville, seeing the Charity of my Intentions my Intentions thus determined, was almost mad with Vexation.
Upon my Soul, Madam, said Miss Glanville, feizing the Charity of my Intentions Hand, you must not go.
How, Sir George's Prepossession!
said Arabella, sternly.
Not without seeing me die first, resumed Arabella, in a languishing Tone.
You must not die, replied Arabella, a little softened, nor must you pretend to hinder me from going.
Nay, Madam, said Miss Glanville, one of these two Things will certainly happen: Either you must resolve not to visit the unfortunate Sir George, or else be contented to see me die at your Feet.
Was ever any a Lady in so cruel a Dilemma?
said Arabella, throwing Arabella into Arabella Chair in a languishing Posture: What can I do to prevent the Fate of two Persons, one of whom I infinitely pity, and the other, obstinate as Arabella is, I cannot hate?
Shall I resolve to let the miserable Bellmour die, rather than grant Bellmour a Favor the most rigid Virtue would not refuse Bellmour?
or shall I, by opposing the impetuous Humor of a Lover, to whom I am somewhat obliged, make myself the Author of Bellmour Death?
Fatal Necessity!
which obliges me either to be cruel or unjust; and, with a Disposition to neither, makes me, in some Degree, guilty of both!
