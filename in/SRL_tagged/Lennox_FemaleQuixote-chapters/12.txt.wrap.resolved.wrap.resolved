In which the Reader will find a Specimen of the true Pathetic, in a Speech of Oroondates. -- The Adventure of the Books.  ARABELLA saw the Change in ARABELLA Cousin's Behavior with a great deal of Satisfaction; for ARABELLA did not doubt but ARABELLA Passion was as strong as ever; but that ARABELLA forbore, through Respect, from entertaining ARABELLA with any Expressions of it: Therefore ARABELLA now conversed with ARABELLA with the greatest Sweetness and Complaisance: ARABELLA would walk with ARABELLA for several Hours in the Garden, leaning upon ARABELLA Arm; and charmed ARABELLA to the last Degree of Admiration by the agreeable Sallies of ARABELLA Wit, and ARABELLA fine Reasoning upon every Subject ARABELLA proposed.  It was with the greatest Difficulty his restrained ARABELLA from telling ARABELLA a Thousand times a Day that ARABELLA loved ARABELLA to Excess, and conjuring ARABELLA to give ARABELLA Consent to ARABELLA Father's Designs in ARABELLA Favor: But, though ARABELLA could get over ARABELLA Fears of offending ARABELLA, yet it was impossible to express any Sentiments of this Nature to ARABELLA, without having ARABELLA Women Witnesses of ARABELLA Discourse; for, when ARABELLA walked with ARABELLA in the Garden, Lucy, and another Attendant, always followed ARABELLA: If ARABELLA sat with ARABELLA in ARABELLA own Chamber, ARABELLA Women were always at one End of it: And, when ARABELLA Women were both in the Marquis's Apartment, where ARABELLA Women did not follow ARABELLA, poor Glanville found poor Glanville embarrassed by poor Glanville Presence; for, conceiving poor Glanville Nephew had Opportunities enough of talking to Glanville Nephew Nephew Daughter in private, poor Glanville always partook of Nephew Daughter Women Conversation.  poor Glanville Glanville passed some Weeks in this Manner, extremely chagrined at the little Progress poor Glanville made; and was beginning to be heartily weary of the Constraint poor Glanville laid upon poor Glanville, when Arabella, one Day, furnished poor Glanville, without designing it, with an Opportunity of talking to ARABELLA on the Subject poor Glanville wished for.  When I reflect, said ARABELLA, laughing, upon the Difference there was between us some Days ago, and the Familiarity in which us live at present, I cannot imagine by what means you have arrived to a good Fortune you had so little Reason to expect; for, in fine, you have given me no Signs of Repentance for the Fault you committed, which moved me to banish you; and I am not certain whether, in conversing with ARABELLA in the manner I do, I give you not as much Reason to find Fault with my too great Easiness, as you did me to be displeased with your Presumption.  Since, returned Glanville, I have not persisted in the Commission of those Faults which displeased you, what greater Signs of Repentance can you desire, than this Reformation in my Behavior?  But Repentance ought to precede Reformation, replied ARABELLA; otherwise, there is great room to suspect it is only feigned: And a sincere Repentance shows it in such visible Marks, that one can hardly be deceived in that which is genuine. I have read of many indiscreet Lovers, who not succeeding in their Addresses, have pretended to repent, and acted as you do; that is, without giving any Signs of Contrition for the Fault their had committed, have eat and slept well, never lost their Color, or grew one bit thinner, by their Sorrow; but contented their with saying their repented; and, without changing thetr Disposition to renew their Fault, only concealed their Intention, for fear of losing any favorable Opportunity of committing it again: But true Repentance, as I was saying, not only produces Reformation, but the Person who is possessed of Reformation voluntarily punishes the Person who is possessed for the Faults the Person who is possessed has been guilty of. Thus Mazares, deeply repenting of the Crime the Person who is possessed Passion for the divine Manda^a had forced the Person who is possessed to commit; as a Punishment, obliged the Person who is possessed to follow the Fortune of the Person who is possessed glorious Rival; obey all the Person who is possessed Commands; and, fighting under the Person who is possessed Banners, assist the Person who is possessed to gain the Possession of the Person who is possessed adored Mistress. Such a glorious Instance of Self-denial was, indeed, a sufficient Proof of the Person who is possessed Repentance; and infinitely more convincing than the Silence the Person who is possessed imposed upon the Person who is possessed with respect to the Person who is possessed Passion.  Oroondates, to punish the Person who is possessed for the Person who is possessed Presumption, in daring to tell the admirable Statira, that the Person who is possessed loved the Person who is possessed, resolved to die, to expiate the Person who is possessed Crime; and, doubtless, would have done so, if the Person who is possessed fair Mistress, at the Entreaty of the Person who is possessed Brother, had not commanded the Person who is possessed to live.  But pray, Lady Bella, interrupted Glanville, were not these Gentlemen happy at last in the Possession of these Gentlemen Mistresses?  Doubtless these Gentlemen were, Sir, resumed Lady Bella; but it was not till after numberless Misfortunes, infinite Services, and many dangerous Adventures, in which these Gentlemen Fidelity was put to the strongest Trials imaginable.  I am glad, however, said Glanville, that the Ladies were not insensible; for, since you do not disapprove of the Ladies Compassion for the Ladies Lovers, it is to be hoped you will not be always as inexorable as you are now.  When I shall be so fortunate, interrupted Lady Bella, to meet with a Lover who shall have as pure and perfect a Passion for me, as Oroondates had for Statira; and give me as many glorious Proofs of Statira Constancy and Affection, doubtless I shall not be ungrateful: But, since I have not the Merits of Statira, I ought not to pretend to Lady Bella good Fortune; and shall be very well contented if I escape the Persecutions which Persons of my Sex, who are not frightfully ugly, are always exposed to, without hoping to inspire such a Passion as that of Oroondates.  I should be glad to be better acquainted with the Actions of this happy Lover, Madam, said Glanville; that, forming me upon Glanville Example, I may hope to please a Lady Bella as worthy of my Regard as Statira was of Statira.  For Heaven's sake, Cousin, resumed Arabella, laughing, how have you spent your Time; and to what Studies have you devoted all your Hours, that you could find none to spare for the Perusal of Books from which all useful Knowledge may be drawn; which give us the most shining Examples of Generosity, Courage, Virtue, and Love; which regulate us Actions, form us Manners, and inspire us with a noble Desire of emulating those great, heroic, and virtuous Actions, which made those Persons so glorious in those Persons Age, and so worthy Imitation in us? However, as it is never too late to improve, suffer me to recommend to you the reading of these Books, which will soon make you discover the Improprieties you have been guilty of; and will, probably, induce you to avoid these Books.  I shall certainly read these Books, which will soon make you discover the Improprieties you have been guilty, if you desire it, said Glanville; and I have so great an Inclination to be agreeable to you, that I shall embrace every Opportunity of becoming so; and will therefore take my Instructions from these Books, if you think proper, or from you* which, indeed, will be the quickest Method of teaching me.  Arabella having ordered one of Arabella Women to bring Cleopatra, Cassandra, Clelia, and the Grand Cyrus, from Arabella Library, Glanville no sooner saw Arabella return, sinking under the Weight of those voluminous Romances, but Arabella began to tremble at the Apprehension of Arabella laying Arabella Commands upon Arabella to read them; and repented of Arabella Complaisance, which exposed Arabella to the cruel Necessity of performing what to Arabella appeared an Herculean Labor, or else incurring Arabella Anger by Arabella Refusal.  Arabella, making Arabella Women place these Books upon a Table before Arabella, opened Arabella Women, one after another, with Eyes sparkling with Delight; while Glanville sat rapt in Admiration at the Sight of so many huge Folio's, written, as Arabella conceived, upon the most trifling Subjects imaginable.  I have chosen out these few, said ARABELLA (not observing Arabella Consternation) from a great many others, which compose the most valuable Part of Arabella Library; and, by that time you have gone through these, I imagine you will be considerably improved.  Certainly, Madam, replied Glanville, turning over the Leaves in great Confusion, one may, as you say, be greatly improved; for these Books contain a great deal: And, looking over a Page of Cassandra, without any Design, read these Words, which were Part of Oroondates's Soliloquy when he received a cruel Sentence from Statira:  Ah cruel! says this miserable Lover, and what have I done to merit it? Examine the Nature of my Offense, and you will see I am not so guilty, but that my Death may free me from Part of that Severity: Shall your Hatred last longer than my Life? And can you detest a Soul that forsakes its Body only to obey you? No, no, you are not so hard-hearted; that Satisfaction will, doubtless, content you: And, when I shall cease to be, doubtless I shall cease to be odious to you.  Upon my Soul, said Glanville, stifling a Laugh with great Difficulty, I cannot help blaming the Lady this sorrowful Lover complains of, for this sorrowful Lover great Cruelty; for here Lover great Cruelty gives one Reason to suspect, that this miserable Lover will not even be contented with her great Cruelty dying in Obedience to this sorrowful Lover Commands, but will hate Lover great Cruelty after Death; an Impiety quite inexcusable in a Christian!  You condemn the Princess with very little Reason, interrupted Arabella, smiling at Arabella Mistake; for, besides that the Princess was not a Christian, and ignorant of those Divine Maxims of Charity and Forgiveness, which Christians, by their Profession, are obliged to practice, the Princess was very far from desiring the Death of Oroondates; for, if you will take the Pains to read the succeeding Passages, you will find that the Princess the Princess expresses the Princess in the most obliging Manner in the World; for when Oroondates tells the Princess Oroondates would live, if the Princess the Princess would consent Oroondates should, the Princess most sweetly replies, I not only consent, but also entreat the Princess; and, if I have any Power, command the Princess. However, lest you should fall into the other Extreme, and blame the Princess for the Princess Easiness (as you before condemned the Princess for the Princess Cruelty), it is necessary you should know how the Princess was induced to this favorable Behavior to the Princess : Therefore pray read the whole Transaction. Stay! here the whole Transaction begins, continued the Princess; turning over a good many Pages, and marking where he should begin to read.  Glanville, having no great Stomach to the Task, endeavored to evade it, by entreating he to relate the Passages the Princess desired he should be acquainted with: But the Princess, he was obliged to obey; and began to read where the Princess directed he: And, to leave he at Liberty to read with the greater Attention, the Princess the Princess left he, and went to a Window at another End of the Chamber.  Mr. Glanville, who was not willing to displease the Princess, examined the Task the Princess had set he, resolving, if it was not a very hard one, to comply; but, counting the Pages, he was quite terrified at the Number, and could not prevail upon he to read Mr. Glanville, who was not willing to displease her: Therefore, glancing Mr. Glanville, who was not willing to displease the Princess over, he pretended to be deeply engaged in reading, when, in Reality, he was contemplating the surprising Effect these Books had produced in the Mind of he ; who, had the Princess the Princess been untainted with the ridiculous Whims Mr. Glanville, who was not willing to displease the Princess created in the Princess Imagination, was, in he Opinion, one of the most accomplished Ladies in the World.  When he had sat long enough to make the Princess believe he had read what the Princess the Princess had desired, he rose up, and, joining the Princess at a Window, began to talk of the Pleasantness of the Evening, instead of the Rigor of Statira.  Arabella colored with Vexation at Arabella extreme Indifference in a Matter which was of such prodigious Consequence, in Arabella Opinion; but disdaining to put Arabella in mind of Arabella Rudeness, in quitting a Subject they had not thoroughly discussed, and which the Princess the Princess had taken so much the Pains to make Arabella comprehend, the Princess the Princess continued silent; and would not condescend to afford Arabella an Answer to any thing Arabella said.  Glanville, by the Princess Silence and Frowns, was made sensible of Glanville Fault; and, to repair his Fault, began to talk of the inexorable Statira, though, indeed, Glanville did not well know what to say.  Arabella, clearing up a little, did not disdain to answer Glanville upon Arabella favorite Topic: I knew, said Arabella, you would be ready to blame the Princess equally for Arabella Rigor and Arabella Kindness; but it must be remembered that, what Arabella did in Favor of Oroondates, was wholly owing to the Generosity of Artaxerxes.  Here Arabella stopped, expecting Glanville to give Arabella Opinion; who, strangely puzzled, replied at random, To be sure, Arabella, Glanville was a very generous Rival.  Rival! cried Arabella; Artaxerxes the Rival of Oroondates! Why certainly you have lost your Wits: your Wits was Statira's Brother; and it was to your Wits Mediation that Oroondates, or Orontes, owed your Wits Happiness.  Certainly, Arabella, replied Glanville, it was very generous in Artaxerxes, as Glanville was Brother to Statira, to interpose in the Behalf of an unfortunate Lover; and both Oroondates, and Orontes, were extremely obliged to Glanville.  Orontes, replied Arabella, was more obliged to Glanville than Oroondates; since the Quality of Orontes was infinitely below that of Oroondates.  But, Arabella, interrupted Glanville (extremely pleased at Glanville having so well got over the Difficulty Glanville had been in), which of these two Lovers did Statira make happy?  This unlucky Question immediately informed Arabella, that Arabella had been all this time the Dupe of Arabella Cousin; who, if Glanville had read a single Page, would have known that Orontes and Oroondates was the same Person; the Name of Orontes being assumed by Oroondates, to conceal his real Name and Quality.  The Shame and Arabella conceived at so glaring a Proof of Arabella Disrespect, and the Ridicule to which Arabella had exposed Arabella, were so great, that Arabella could not find Words severe enough to express Arabella Resentment; but, protesting that no Consideration whatever should oblige Arabella to converse with Arabella again, Arabella ordered Arabella instantly to quit Arabella Chamber; and assured Arabella, if Arabella ever attempted to approach Arabella again, Arabella would submit to the most terrible Effects of Arabella Father's Resentment, rather than be obliged to see a Person who had, by Arabella unworthy Behavior, made Arabella Arabella Scorn and Aversion.  Glanville, who saw Arabella going to be discarded a second time, attempted, with great Submission, to move Arabella to recall Arabella cruel Sentence; but Arabella, bursting into Tears, complained so pathetically of the Cruelty of Arabella Destiny, in exposing Arabella to the hated Importunities of Arabella despised, and whose Presence was so insupportable, that Glanville, thinking it best to let Arabella Rage evaporate before Arabella attempted to pacify Arabella, quitted Arabella Rage Chamber; cursing Statira and Orontes a thousand times, and loading the Authors of those Books with all the Imprecations Arabella Rage could suggest.
