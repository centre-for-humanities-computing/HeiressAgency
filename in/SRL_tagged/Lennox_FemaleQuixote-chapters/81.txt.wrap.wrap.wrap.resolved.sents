In which is introduced a very singular Character.
MISS Glanville, whose Envy and Dislike of her lovely Cousin was heightened by her Suspicions that her disputed with her the Possession of Sir George's Heart, her having been long in reality a great Admirer of that gay Gentleman, was extremely delighted with the Ridicule her absurd Behavior had drawn upon her at Bath, which her found by Enquiry was through Mr. Tinsel's Representation grown almost general.
In order therefore to be at Liberty to go to the Public Places un-eclips'd by the superior Beauty of Arabella, her acquainted her Father and Brother with Part of what her had heard, which determined her Father and Brother to prevent that young Lady's Appearance in Public while her Father and Brother staid at Bath; this being no difficult Matter to bring about, since Arabella only went to the Rooms or Parade in Compliance with the Invitation of her Cousins.
Miss Glanville being by these Means rid of a Rival too powerful even to contend with, went with more than usual Gaiety to the Assembly, where the Extravagancies of Arabella afforded a perpetual Fund for Diversion.
Arabella more than passive Behavior upon this Occasion, banishing all Restraint among those Arabella conversed with, the Jest circulated very freely at Arabella's Expense.
Nor did Miss Glanville being by these Means Glanville fail to give new Poignancy to their Sarcasms, by artfully disclosing the bent of Arabella Cousin's Studies, and enumerating the many Absurdities their had made Arabella guilty of.
Arabella's uncommon Beauty had gained Arabella so many Enemies among the Ladies that composed this Assembly, that they seemed to contend with each other who should ridicule Arabella most.
The celebrated Countess of -- being then at Bath, approached a Circle of these fair Defamers, and listening a few Moments to the contemptuous Jests they threw out against the absent Beauty, declared Arabella in Arabella Favor; which in a Moment, such was the Force of Arabella universally acknowledged Merit, and the Deference always paid to Arabella Opinion, silenced every pretty Impertinent around Arabella.
This Lady, who among Arabella own Sex had no Superior in Wit, Elegance, and Ease, was inferior to very few of the other in Sense, Learning, and Judgment.
Arabella Skill in Poetry, Painting, and Music, though incontestably great, was numbered among the least of Arabella Accomplishments.
Arabella Candor, Arabella Sweetness, Arabella Modesty and Benevolence, while they secured Arabella from the Darts of Envy, rendered Arabella superior to Praise, and made the one as unnecessary as the other ineffectual.
Arabella had been a Witness of the Surprise Arabella's extraordinary Appearance had occasioned, and struck with that as well as the uncommon Charms of Arabella Person, had pressed near Arabella with several others of the Company, when Arabella was discoursing in the Manner we have related.
A Person of the Countess's nice Discernment could not fail of observing the Wit and Spirit, which though obscured, was not absolutely hid under the Absurdity of Arabella Notions.
And this Discovery adding Esteem to the Compassion Arabella felt for the fair Visionary, Arabella resolved to rescue Arabella from the ill-natured Raillery of Arabella Sex; praising therefore Arabella Understanding, and the Beauty of her Person with a Sweetness and Generosity peculiar to Arabella, Arabella accounted in the most delicate Manner imaginable for the Singularity of her Notions, from Arabella Studies, Arabella Retirment, Arabella Ignorance of the World, and Arabella lively Imagination.
And to abate the Keenness of their Sarcasms, acknowledged, that Arabella had when very young, been deep read in Romances; and but for an early Acquaintance with the World, and being directed to other Studies, was likely to have been as much a Heroine as Lady Bella.
Miss Glanville, though Arabella was secretly vexed at this Defense of Arabella Cousin, was however under a Necessity of seeming obliged to the Countess for it: And that Lady expressing a Desire to be acquainted with Lady Bella, Miss Glanville respectfully offered to attend her Cousin to Arabella Lodgings, which the Countess as respectfully declined, saying, As Lady Bella was a Stranger, Arabella would make Arabella the first Visit.
Miss Glanville at Arabella Return gave Arabella Brother an Account of what had happened at the Assembly, and filled Brother an Account of what had happened at the Assembly with an inconceivable Joy at the Countess's Intention.
Brother an Account of what had happened at the Assembly had always been a zealous Admirer of that Lady's Character, and flattered Brother an Account of what had happened at the Assembly that the Conversation of so admirable a Woman would be of the utmost Use to Arabella.
That very Night Brother an Account of what had happened at the Assembly mentioned Arabella to Brother an Account of what had happened at the Assembly ; and after enumerating all Arabella fine Qualities, declared that Arabella had already conceived a Friendship for Arabella, and was solicitous of Arabella Acquaintance.
I think Arabella extremely fortunate, replied Arabella, in that I have (though questionless undeservedly) acquired the Amity of this lovely Person; and I beg you, pursued Arabella to Miss Glanville, to tell Arabella, that I long with Impatience to embrace Arabella, and to give Arabella that Share in my Heart which Arabella transcendent Merit deserves.
Miss Glanville Miss Glanville only bowed Arabella Head in Answer to this Request, giving Arabella Brother at the same Time a significant Leer; who though used to Arabella's Particularities, could not help being a little confounded at the heroic Speech Arabella had made.
