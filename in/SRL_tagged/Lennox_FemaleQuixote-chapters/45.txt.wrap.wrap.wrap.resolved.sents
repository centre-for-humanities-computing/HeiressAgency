In which our Heroine is in some little Confusion.
WHILE Arabella was uttering this pathetic Complaint, Mr. Glanville, with great Difficulty, kept this pathetic Complaint, Mr. Glanville from smiling; and, by some supplicating Looks to this pathetic Complaint, Mr. Glanville Sister, prevented his Sister laughing out; yet his Sister gigled in secret behind his Sister Fan: But Arabella was so lost in Arabella melancholy Reflections, that Arabella kept Arabella Eyes immoveably fixed on the Ground for some Moments: At last, casting an upbraiding Glance at Glanville;  Is it possible, cruel Person that you are!
said Arabella to Person, that you can, without Pity, see me suffer so much Uneasiness; and, knowing the Sensibility of my Temper, can expose me to the Grief of being accessory to the Death of an unfortunate Man, guilty indeed of a too violent Passion, which merits a gentler Punishment, than that you doom Person to?
Don't be uneasy, dear Cousin, interrupted Miss Glanville; I dare assure you Sir George will not die.
It is impossible to think that, said Arabella, since Sir George has not so much as received a Command from Sir George to live; but tell me truly, pursued Arabella, do you believe it probable, that Sir George will obey me, and live?
Indeed, Sir George, said Miss Glanville, I could swear for Miss Glanville that Miss Glanville will.
Well, replied Arabella, I will content Sir George with sending Miss Glanville my Commands in Writing; but it is to be feared they will not have so much Efficacy upon Miss Glanville Spirit.
Mr. Glanville, extremely pleased that Arabella had laid aside Arabella Design of visiting Sir George, did not oppose Arabella writing to Sir George, though Sir George was plotting how to prevent the Letter reaching Sir George Hands; and while Arabella went into Arabella Closet to write, Sir George conferred with Sir George Sister upon the Means Sir George should use, expressing, at the same time, great Resentment against Sir George, for endeavoring to supplant Sir George in Sir George Cousin's Affection.
What then, said Miss Glanville, do you really imagine Sir George is in Love with Lady Bella?
Sir George is either in Love with Lady Bella Person or Estate, replied Mr. Glanville, or perhaps with both; for Lady Bella is handsome enough to gain a Lover of Sir George Merit, though Lady Bella had no Fortune; and Lady Bella has Fortune enough to do it, though Lady Bella had no Beauty.
his Cousin is well enough, to be sure, said Miss GlanvilleMiss Glanville; but I never could think his Cousin a Beauty.
If, replied Mr. Glanville, a most lovely Complexion, regular Features, a fine Stature, an elegant Shape, and an inexpressible Grace in all Grace Motions, can form a Beauty, his Cousin may pretend to that Character, without any Dispute.
Though his Cousin was all that you say, returned Miss GlanvilleMiss Glanville, I am certain Sir George is not in Love with his Cousin.
I wish I was certain of that, replied Miss Glanville; for it is very probable you are mistaken.
You may see by Miss Glanville Letter, interrupted Miss Glanville, what a Jest Miss Glanville makes of his Cousin; and if you had heard how Miss Glanville talked to his Cousin the other Day in the Garden, you would have died with Laughing; yet my poor Cousin thought Miss Glanville was very serious, and was so foolishly pleased!
I assure you Charlotte, said Miss Glanville, gravely, I shall take it very ill, if you make so free with your Cousin's little Foibles; and if certain Sir George presumes to make a Jest of his Cousin, as you say, I shall teach certain Sir George better Manners.
You are the strangest Creature in the World!
said Miss Glanville: A Minute or two ago, you was wishing to be sure certain Sir George was not in Love with his Cousin; and now you are angry, when I assure you certain Sir George is only in Jest.
Arabella, that Moment coming out of his Cousin Closet, broke off Arabella, that Moment coming out of her Closet Discourse.
I have written to certain Sir George, said his Cousin, addressing his Cousin to Miss Glanville; and you are at Liberty, if you please, to read my Letter, which I propose to send away immediately.
Miss Glanville, taking the Letter out of his Cousin Hand, with a low Bow, began to read it to Miss Glanville; but Arabella, willing Miss Glanville Sister should also be acquainted with the Contents, obliged Miss Glanville, much against Miss Glanville Will, to read the Contents aloud.
the Contents was as follows:  Arabella, To Bellmour.
WHATEVER Offense your presumptuous Declaration may have given me, yet my Resentment will be appeased with a less Punishment than Death: And that Grief and Submission you have testified in your Letter, may happily have already procured you Pardon for your Fault, provided you do not forfeit it by Disobedience.
I therefore command you to live, and command you by all that Power you have given me over Arabella.
Remember I require no more of Arabella, than Parisatis did of Lysimachus, in a more cruel and insupportable Misfortune: Imitate then the Obedience and Submission of that illustrious Prince; and though you should be as unfortunate as that illustrious Prince, let your Courage also be equal to your Courage; and, like your Courage, be contented with the Esteem that is offered you, since it is all that can be bestowed, by  Arabella.
Mr. Glanville, finding by this Epistle, that Arabella.
did not design to encourage the Addresses of Sir George, would not have been against Sir George receiving it, had Sir George not feared the Consequence of Sir George having such a convincing Proof of the Peculiarity of Arabella.
Temper in Sir George Possession; and while Sir George kept the Letter in Sir George Hand, as if Sir George wanted to consider it a little better, Sir George meditated on the Means to prevent the Means being ever delivered; and had possibly fixed upon some successful Contrivance, when a Servant coming in, to inform the Ladies, that Sir George was come to wait on them, put an End to Sir George Schemes; and Sir George immediately ran down to receive Sir George, not being willing to increase, by Sir George Stay, the Astonishment and Confusion, which appeared in the Countenance of Arabella, at hearing a Man, whom Arabella.
had believed and represented to be dying, was come to pay Arabella.
a Visit.
