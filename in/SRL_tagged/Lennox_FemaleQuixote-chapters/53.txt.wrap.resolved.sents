An extraordinary Instance of Generosity in a Lover, somewhat resembling that of the great Artaxerxes, in Cassandra.
THE farther I went, continued Sir George, the more my Regret increased; and, finding it would be impossible to live, and quit the Divine Sydimiris, I all at once took a Resolution to remain in the Town concealed; and, communicating my Design to my Guide, I engaged Sir George to assist me in my Design, by a Present of a considerable Sum, which Sir George could not resist: Accordingly Sir George left me in a remote Part of the Town, and went to find out a convenient Lodging for me; which Sir George soon procured, and also a Suit of Clothes to disguise me, my own being very rich and magnificent.
Having recommended me as a Relation of his, who was newly arrived, I was received very civilly by the People with whom Sir George placed me; and, finding This Man to be very witty and discreet, and also very capable of serving me, I communicated to This Man my Intentions by staying, which were only to be near the Divine Sydimiris, and to have the Happiness of sometimes seeing her, when her went abroad.
This Man entering into my Meaning, assured me, This Man would faithfully keep my Secret; and that This Man would not fail to bring me Intelligence of all that passed in the Palace of Marcomire.
I could with Difficulty keep me from falling at This Man Feet, to express my Sense of This Man kind and generous Offers; but I contented me with presenting This Man another Sum of Money, larger than the first, and assured This Man of my future Gratitude.
This Man then took Leave, and left me to my Reflections, which were wholly upon the Image of the Divine Sydimiris, and the Happiness of being so near the Object I adored.
My Confident came to me the next Day; but brought me no other News, than that my Escape was not yet known to Marcomire.
I inquired if This Man had seen Sydimiris; but This Man replied This Man had not, and that Urinoe had only asked This Man, if This Man had conducted me safe out of Town: To which This Man had answered as we had agreed, that I had got out safe and undiscovered.
A Day or two after, This Man brought me News more pleasing; for This Man told me, that Sydimiris had sent for This Man into Sydimiris Chamber, and asked This Man several Questions concerning me: That Sydimiris appeared very melancholy, and even blushed, whenever Sydimiris mentioned my Name.
This Account gave sufficient Matter for my Thoughts to work upon for several Days.
I interpreted Sydimiris's Blush a Thousand different Ways; I reflected upon all the different Causes to which it might be owing, and busied myself with all those innumerable Conjectures, which, as you know, Madam, such an Incident always gives Rise to in a Lover's Imagination.
At length I explained it to my own Advantage, and felt thereby a considerable Increase of my Affection.
A whole Week having elapsed, without another Sight of my Confidant, I began to be greatly alarmed; when, on the Eighth Day of this cruel Suspense, I saw my Confidant appear; but with so many Marks of Disturbance in my Confidant Face, that I trembled to hear what my Confidant had to acquaint me with.
Oh!
my Confidant, said my Confidant, as soon as my Confidant Concern suffered my Confidant to speak, Marcomire has discovered your Escape, and the Means by which it was procured: One of those in whom Urinoe confided, has betrayed it to my Confidant; and the beauteous Sydimiris is likely to feel the most terrible Effects of my Confidant Displeasure: my Confidant has confined her to her Chamber, and vows to sacrifice her Life to the Honor of my Confidant Family; which my Confidant says, her has stained; and my Confidant loads that admirable Lady with so many Reproaches, that it is thought, her Grief for such undeserved Calumnies will occasion her Death.
Scarce had my Confidant finished these cruel Words, when I, who all the time my Confidant had been speaking, beheld my Confidant with a dying Eye, sunk down at my Confidant Feet in a Swoon; which continued so long, that my Confidant began to think me quite dead: However I at last opened my Eyes; but it was only to pour forth a River of Tears, and to utter Complaints, which might have moved the most obdurate Heart.
After having a long time tormented my Confidant in weeping and complaining, I at last took a Resolution, which afforded me some Alleviation of my Grief; and the faithful Toxares, seeing me a little composed, left me to my Confidant, with a Promise to return soon, and acquaint me with what passed further in the Palace of Marcomire.
As soon as he was gone, I rose from my Bed; and, dressing my Confidant in those Clothes I wore when I was taken Prisoner, I went to the Palace of Marcomire; and, demanding to see Prisoner, I was told Prisoner was in the Apartment of Sydimiris; and, at my earnest Desire, they conducted me thither.
When I entered the Room, I beheld that incomparable Beauty stretched upon a Couch, dissolved in Tears; and Urinoe upon her Knees, before her, accompanying with her own, those precious Drops which fell from the bright Eyes of her Mistress.
Marcomire, who was walking furiously about the Room, exclaiming with the utmost Violence against that fair Sufferer, did not observe my Entrance; so that I had an Opportunity of going toward Sydimiris, who, lifting up the bright Eyes of her Mistress to look upon my Confidant, gave a loud Shriek; and, by a Look of extreme Anguish, let me understand, how great her Apprehensions were upon my Account.
I am come, her, said I, to perform Part of the Promise I made you, and by dying, to prove your Innocence; and, freeing you from the Reproaches you suffer on my Account, I shall have the Happiness to convince you, that my Life is infinitely less dear to me, than your Tranquillity.
Sydimiris, who hearkened to me with great Emotion, was going to make some Answer, when Marcomire, alarmed by Marcomire Sister's Shriek, came toward us, and, viewing me at first with Astonishment, and then with a Smile of Cruelty and Revenge,  Is it possible, said Marcomire, that I behold my designed Murderer again in my Power?
I am in thy Power, said I, because I am willing to be so; and came voluntarily to put me into your Hands, to free that excellent Lady from the Imputation you have laid on Lady: Know, Marcomire, that it is to me alone I owed my Liberty, which I would still preserve against all the Forces thou could bring to deprive me of all the Forces thou; and this Sword, which left thee Life enough to threaten mine, would happily once more put yours in Danger, were I not restrained by a powerful Consideration, which leaves me not the Liberty of even wishing you ill.  Ah!
Dissembler, said Marcomire, in a Rage, think not to impose upon me by thy counterfeited Mildness: Thou art my Prisoner once more, and I shall take care to prevent your escaping a Second time.
I am not your Prisoner, replied I, while I possess this Sword, which has already defended me against greater Numbers than you have here to oppose me; but, continued I, throwing down my Sword at Sydimiris's Feet, I resign my Liberty to restore that Lady to your good Opinion, and to free that Lady from those base Aspersions thou have unjustly loaded that Lady with, upon my Account.
It matters not, said that Lady, taking up my Sword, whether thou have resigned, or I have deprived thee of Liberty; but since thou art in my Power, thou shall feel all the Effects of my Resentment: Take that Lady away, pursued that Lady to some of that Lady People; put that Lady into the worst Dungeon you can find; and let that Lady be guarded carefully, upon Pain of Death, if that Lady again escapes.
With these Words, several Men offered to lead me out of the Room; but I repulsed several Men with Disdain; and, making a low Reverence to Sydimiris, whose Countenance expressed the Extremes of Fear and Anguish, I followed my Conductors to the Prison allotted for me; which, hideous as it was, I contemplated with a secret Pleasure, since I had by that Action, which had brought me into it was, given a Testimony of my Love for Sydimiris.
CHAPTER VI.
In which CHAPTER VI will be seen, that that Lady that Lady is as generous as that Lady Lover.
I Passed some Days in this Confinement, melancholy enough: My Ignorance of the Destiny of Sydimiris gave me more Pain than the Sense of my own Misfortunes; and one Evening, when I was more then usually disquieted, one of my Guard entered the Prison, and, giving me a Letter, retired, without speaking a Word: I opened this Letter with Precipitation, and, by the Light of a Lamp which was allowed me, I read the following Words.
Sydimiris, To the most generous Bellmour.
IT is not enough to tell you, that the Method you took to free me from that Lady's Severity, has filled me with the utmost Esteem and Admiration.
So generous an Action merits a greater Acknowlegement, and I will make no Scruple to confess, that my Heart is most sensibly touched by no Scruple: Yes, the most generous Bellmour, I have received this glorious Testimony of your Affection with such a Gratitude, as you yourself could have wished to inspire me with; and it shall not be long, before you will have a convincing Proof of the Effect it has had upon the Spirit of  Sydimiris.
This Letter, Madam, pursued Sir George, being wholly calculated to make me hope that I was not hated by the Divine Sydimiris; and that the Divine Sydimiris meditated something in my Favor; I resigned Sir George up to the most delightful Expectations.
What!
cried I, transported with the Excess of my Joy: Does the most admirable Sydimiris condescend to assure me, that I have touched the Divine Sydimiris Heart?
And does the Divine Sydimiris promise me, that I shall receive some convincing Proof of the Divine Sydimiris Acknowlegement?
Ah!
too happy, and too fortunate Bellmour, to what a glorious Destiny have thou been reserved!
And how ought thou to adore these Fetters, that have procured thee the Esteem of the Divine Sydimiris!
--  Such, Madam, were the Apprehensions, which the Billet I had received inspired me with.
I continually flattered Sir George with the most pleasing Hopes; and during Three Weeks longer, in which I heard no more from Sydimiris, my Imagination, was wholly filled with those sweet Thoughts, which her Letter had made me entertain.
At length, on the Evening of a Day which I had wholly spent in reading over Sydimiris's Letter; and interpreting the Sense of it a thousand different Ways, but all agreeable to my ardent Wishes; I saw Urinoe enter the Prison, accompanied by Toxares, whom I had not seen during my last Confinement.
Wholly transported at the Sight of these Two Friends, and not doubting but these Two Friends had brought me the most agreeable News, I ran toward these Two Friends; and, throwing my self at Urinoe's Feet, I begged my self, in an Ecstacy of Joy, to acquaint me with Sydimiris's Commands.
Urinoe, in some Confusion at this Action, entreated me to rise.
It Is fit, cried I, in a Transport I could not master, that in this Posture I should receive the Knowledge of Sydimiris has had the Goodness to promise me.
Urinoe sighed at these Words; and, beholding me with a Look of Compassion and Tenderness,  Would to God, said my self, that all I have to say, were as agreeable, as the first News I have to tell you; which is, that you are free, and at Liberty to leave the Town this Moment!
Sydimiris, continued my self, has bought your Freedom, at the Expense of my self own; and, to deliver you from my self Brother's Chains, my self has put on others, happily more cruel than those you have worn: In fine, my self has married a Man, whom my self detested, to procure your Liberty; my self Brother having granted it to my self upon that Condition alone.
Scarce had Urinoe finished these Words, when I fell, without Sense or Motion, at Urinoe's Feet.
Toxares and my self, who had foreseen what might happen, having provided Toxares and she, who had foreseen what might happen with Cordials necessary to restore me, brought me to myself with infinite Trouble.
Cruel!
said I to Toxares and she, who had foreseen what might happen, with a Tone and Look, which witnessed the Excess of my Despair, Why have you hindered me from dying, at once to prevent the thousand Deaths I shall suffer from my Grief?
Is this the Confirmation of those glorious Sydimiris had permitted me to entertain?
Is this that Proof of the Acknowlegements I was to expect?
And is it by throwing my self into the Arms of my Rival, that my self repays those Obligations my self thinks my self owes me?
Ah!
inhuman Sydimiris!
was it to make my Despair more poignant, that thou flatterest me with such a Prospect of Happiness?
And was it necessary, to the Grandeur of thy Nuptials, that my Life should be the Sacrifice?
But, how unjust am I, cried I, repenting in an Instant of those injurious Suspicions; How unjust am I, to accuse the Divine Sydimiris?
Was it not to give me Freedom, that my self bestowed my self upon a Man my self hates?
And has my self not made my self miserable for ever, to procure me a fansied Happiness?
Ah!
if it be so, what a Wretch am I?
I, who have been the only Cause of that Misery, to which my self has doomed my self?
Ah!
Liberty!
pursued I, how I detest thee, since purchased by the Misfortune of Sydimiris!
And how far more sweet and glorious were those Chains, which I wore for my self sake!
My Sighs and Tears leaving me no longer the Power of Speech, I sunk down on my Bed, oppressed with a mortal Grief.
Urinoe and Toxares drew near to comfort me, and said all that sensible and discreet Persons could think of to alleviate my Despair.
Though I have heard that Sydimiris is married, replied I, without dying immediately; yet do not imagine, that I will suffer this odious Life to continue long.
If Sorrow do not quickly dispatch me, I will seek Death by other Means; for since Sydimiris is lost, I have no more Business in the World.
Urinoe endeavored in vain to divert me from this sad Resolution, when Urinoe, finding all their Reasonings ineffectual, drew a Letter out of Urinoe Pocket, and, presenting a Letter to me, I had Orders, said Urinoe, not to let this Letter be delivered to Urinoe, till you had left the Town; but the Despair, to which I see you reduced, does, I conceive, dispense with my rigorous Observation of those Directions.
While Urinoe was speaking, I opened this Letter trembling, and found this Letter trembling as follows.
