In which a Mistake, in point of Ceremony, is rectified.  ARABELLA had scarce done thinking of this last Adventure, when the Marquis communicated a Piece of Intelligence to ARABELLA, which opened a Prospect of an infinite Number of new ones.  His Nephew, having just returned from His Travels, was preparing to come and pay His Nephew a Visit in His Nephew Retreat; and, as His Nephew always designed to marry ARABELLA to this Youth, of whom His Nephew was extremely fond, His Nephew told His Nephew Daughter of the intended Visit of Daughter Cousin, whom Daughter had not seen since Daughter was eight Years old; and, for the first time, insinuated His Nephew Design of giving His Nephew to Daughter for an Husband.  Arabella, whose Delicacy was extremely shocked at this abrupt Declaration of Daughter ^ather, could hardly hide Daughter Chagrin; for, though Daughter always intended to marry some time or other, as all the Heroines had done, yet Daughter thought such an Event ought to be brought about with an infinite deal of Trouble; and that such an Event Event was necessary Daughter should pass to this State through a great Number of Cares, Disappointments, and Distresses of various Kinds, like various Kinds; that Daughter Lover should purchase Daughter Lover Lover with Daughter Lover Lover Sword from a Crowd of Rivals; and arrive to the Possession of Daughter Heart by many Years of Services and Fidelity.  The Impropriety of receiving a Lover of a Father's recommending appeared in The Impropriety of receiving a Lover of a Father's recommending of receiving a Lover of a Father's recommending strongest Light. What Lady in Romance ever married the Man that was chose for What Lady in Romance? In those Cases the Remonstrances of a Parent are called Persecutions; obstinate Resistance, Constancy and Courage; and an Aptitude to dislike the Person proposed to Resistance, Constancy and Courage, a noble Freedom of Mind which disdains to love or hate by the Caprice of others.  Arabella, strengthening Arabella own Resolutions by those Examples of heroic Disobedience, told Arabella , with great Solemnity of Accent, that Arabella would always obey a Father in all just and reasonable Things; and, being persuaded that a Father would never attempt to lay any Force upon Arabella Inclinations, Arabella would endeavor to make them conformable to a Father, and receive Arabella Cousin with that Civility and Friendship due to so near a Relation, and a Person whom a Father honored with a Father Esteem.  The Marquis, having had frequent Occasions of admiring The Marquis Daughter's Eloquence, did not draw any unpleasing Conclusion from the nice Distinctions Arabella made; and, being perfectly assured of Arabella Consent whenever The Marquis The Marquis demanded Arabella Consent, expected the Arrival of The Marquis Nephew with great Impatience.  Arabella, whose Thoughts had been fully employed since this Conversation with Arabella Father, was indulging Arabella Meditations in one of the most retired Walks in the Garden; when Arabella was informed by Lucy, that Arabella Cousin was come, and that The Marquis had brought The Marquis into the Garden to look for Arabella.  That Instant they both entered the Walk, when Arabella, prepossessed, as Arabella was, against any favorable Thoughts of the young Glanville, could not help betraying some Surprise at the Gracefulness of The Marquis Figure.  It must be confessed, said Arabella to Arabella Attendant, with a Smile, that Arabella Father has brought us, is no contemptible Person: Nevertheless I feel an invincible Repugnance in Arabella against receiving Arabella Father in that Character.  As Arabella finished these Words, The Marquis came up, and presented the young Glanville to Arabella; who, saluting Arabella with the Freedom of a Relation, gave Arabella a Disgust that showed itself immediately in Arabella fair Face, which was overspread with such a Gloom, that The Marquis was quite astonished at it. Indeed Arabella, who expected The Marquis The Marquis would hardly have presumed to kiss Arabella Hand, was so surprised at The Marquis Freedom, in attempting Arabella Lips, that Arabella not only expressed Arabella Indignation by Frowns, but gave The Marquis to understand The Marquis had mortally offended Arabella.  the young Glanville, however, was neither surprised nor angry at Arabella Resentment; but, imputing it to Arabella Country Education, endeavored to Arabella Arabella out of Arabella ill Humor; and The Marquis, being glad to find a Behavior, which he thought proceeded from Arabella Dislike of Arabella Cousin, was only an Effect of an over-scrupulous Modesty, told Arabella that the young Glanville had committed no Offense by saluting Arabella, since that was a Civility which was granted to all Strangers at the first Interview, and therefore could not be refused to a Relation.  Since the World is so degenerate in it is Customs from what Customs was formerly, said Arabella, with a Smile full of Contempt upon Arabella Cousin, I am extremely happy in having lived in a Solitude which has not yet exposed me to the Mortification of being a Witness to Manners I cannot approve; for if every Person I shall meet with for the future be so deficient in their Respects to Ladies, as Respects Cousin is, I shall not care how much I am secluded from Society.  But, dear Lady Bella, interrupted the young Glanville gaily, tell me, I beseech you, how I must behave to please you; for I should be extremely glad to be honored with your good Opinion.  Person, resumed dear Lady Bella, whom I must teach how to acquire my good Opinion, will, I am afraid, hardly recompense me by Person Docility in learning, for the Pains I should be at in instructing Person.  But, resumed the young Glanville, that I may avoid any more Occasions of offending you, only let me know how you would be approached for the future.  Since, answered dear Lady Bella, there is no Necessity to renew the Ceremony of introducing you again to dear Lady Bella, I have not a second Affront of that Kind to apprehend; but I pray tell me, If all Cavaliers are as presuming as yourself; and if a Relation of your Sex does not think a modest Embrace from a Lady a Welcome sufficiently tender The Heroines, though The Heroines think a' Kiss of the Hand a great Condescension to a Lover, and never grant it without Blushes and Confusion; yet make no Scruple to embrace Blushes upon every short Absence. ?  Nay, Cousin, cried Glanville eagerly, I am now persuaded you are in the Right; an Embrace is certainly to be preferred to a cold Salute. What would I give, that the Marquis would introduce me a second time, that I might be received with so delightful a Welcome?  The Vivacity with which he spoke this was so extremely disagreeable to Arabella, that Arabella turned from he abruptly, and, striking into another Walk, ordered Lucy to tell he Lucy commanded he not to follow Lucy.  Glanville, however, who had no Notion of the exact Obedience which was expected from Glanville, would have gone after Lucy, notwithstanding this Prohibition, which Lucy delivered in a most peremptory Manner, after Lucy Lady's Example: But the Marquis, who had left the two young People at Liberty to discourse, and had walked on, that Glanville might not interrupt the two young People at LibertyLiberty, turning about, and seeing Glanville alone, called Glanville to have some private Discourse with Glanville; and, for that time, spared Arabella the Mortification of seeing Lucy Lady's Lady Commands disobeyed.
