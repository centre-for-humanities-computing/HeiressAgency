In which the Mistakes are not yet cleared up.  THE Baronet, who had been put into a bad Humor by Arabella's Insinuations, that Sir George had affronted her, appeared reserved and uneasy; and, being resolved to question her about it, was willing first to know exactly what it was Sir George Niece had been offended at: But as Sir George feared, if it came to Sir George Son's Knowledge, it came to Sir George Son's Knowledge would produce a Quarrel between the young Gentlemen, that might have dangerous Consequences, Sir George was desirous of speaking to her alone; and, as soon as Dinner was over, asked her to take a Walk with Sir George upon the Terrace, telling her Sir George had something to say to her in private. Arabella, whose Fears had been considerably increased by the Pensiveness which appeared in her Uncle's Looks during Dinner, and supposing Sir George wanted a private Conversation, only to explain Sir George more clearly to her, than Sir George had yet done, was excessively alarmed at this Request; and, casting her Eyes down to the Ground, blushed in such a manner as betrayed her Eyes Eyes Confusion; and made Miss Glanville and her Eyes Brother believe, that her Eyes suspected her Eyes had a Design to press her Eyes soon to give her Eyes Hand to Mr. Glanville, which occasioned her Eyes apparent Disorder.  Sir Charles, however, who had not so heedfully observed her Eyes Behavior, repeated Sir Charles ; adding, with a Smile, upon her Eyes giving Sir Charles no Answer, Sure, her Eyes, you are not afraid to be alone with her Eyes .  No, Sir Charles, replied Arabella, giving Sir Charles a piercing Look; I am not afraid of being alone with her Uncle; and, as long as Sir Charles pretends to be no more than her her Uncle, I shall not scruple to hear what Sir Charles has to say to Sir Charles.  Sir Charles, a little vexed at an Answer which insinuated, as Sir Charles thought, a Complaint of Sir Charles having pretended to more Authority over Sir Charles than Sir Charles ought, told Sir Charles, Sir Charles hoped Sir Charles had no Cause to believe Sir Charles would displease Sir Charles, by any improper Exertion of that Power over Sir Charles, with which Sir Charles Father had entrusted Sir Charles: For I assure you, added Sir Charles, I would rather you should follow my Advice as an Uncle, than obey me as a Guardian; and, since my Affection for you is, prehaps, greater than what many People have for a Niece, my Solicitude ought to be imputed to that Motive.  I have all the Sense I ought to have of that Affection you honor me with, replied Arabella; and since I hope it will be always what it should be, without wishing for it Increase, I am contented with those Testimonies I have already received of it; and do not desire any other.  Sir Charles, a little puzzled to understand the Meaning of these Words, which the grave Looks of replied Arabella replied Arabella made yet more mysterious, rose from Sir Charles Seat with an Air of Discontent: I should have been glad to have spoken a Word in private to you, Niece, said replied Arabellareplied Arabella; but, since you think proper to make so much Ceremony in such a Trifle, I Will defer it till you are in a better Humor.  Miss Glanville, seeing replied Arabella Father going out of the Room, stepped before replied Arabella Father: Nay, Papa, said replied Arabellareplied Arabella, if you want to speak with my Cousin, my Brother and I will go out, and leave you to Nay, Papa.  You will do me a very great Displeasure, said replied Arabellareplied Arabella; for, I am sure, replied Arabella Father has not any thing of Consequence to say to replied Arabella Father: Howexer, added replied replied Arabella, seeing Miss Glanville go away, I am resolved, I will not be left alone; and therefore, Miss Glanville, since I can pretend to some Power over replied Arabella, I command you to stay.  You may remember, replied Arabellareplied Arabella, said Miss Glanville, with a Smile, you refused to gratify my Curiosity, with regard to something you hinted to replied Arabella Father replied Arabella Father some time ago; and, to punish you, added Miss Glanville, going out of the Room, I am resolved you shall listen to what replied Arabella Father has to say to replied Arabella Father; for, by your Unwillingness to hear what her Father has to say to you, I imagine you suspect already what what her Father has to say to you is.  replied replied Arabella, finding replied Arabella replied Arabella had no way to avoid hearing what replied replied Arabella dreaded so much, and observing my Uncle my Uncle had resumed my Uncle Chair, prepared to give my Uncle Audience; but, in order to deprive my Uncle of all Hope, that replied replied Arabella would receive my Uncle Discourse favorably, replied Arabella replied Arabella assumed the severest Look replied replied Arabella was capable of; and, casting replied Arabella Eyes on the Ground, with a Mixture of Anger and Shame, waited with a kind of Fear and Impatience for what replied Arabella Father replied Arabella Father had to say.  I see, replied replied Arabella, said the Baronet, observing replied Arabella Confusion, that you apprehend what I am going to say to replied Arabella; but, I beseech you, do not fear I have any Intentions, but such as you will approve.  You are certainly in the right, replied Arabella Father, said replied Arabellareplied Arabella, in the Interpretation you have put on my Looks: I am really in Pain about the Purport of your Discourse: And you would particularly oblige me, if you would dispense with replied Arabella Father from hearing it.  I see, replied Sir Charles, that, out of a mistaken Fear, you are unwilling to hear me, in order to avoid coming to the Explanation I desire: But I tell you, once again, you have nothing to apprehend.  I have every thing to apprehend, Sir, resumed replied Arabellareplied Arabella, tartly, while you persist in your Design of disobliging me; and you cannot give me a greater Proof of the Badness of your Intentions, than by thus forcing me to listen to Discourses I ought to avoid.  Since my Word has no Weight with replied Arabella, replied Sir Charles, I Will condescend to assure you, by the most sacred Oath, That I do not mean to come to any Extremities with Sir George, concerning what you already told me: All I desire to know is, If you think you had any Reason to be offended with Sir George for any thing Sir George said? And, in that Case, I cannot dispense with Sir George from expostulating with Sir George about it.  You would do me a Favor, Sir, resumed replied Arabellareplied Arabella, if you would interest replied replied Arabella a little less in what Sir George said to Sir George: The Offense was committed against Sir George only; and none but me has any Right to resent it.  It Is enough, Niece, said Sir Charles, rising: You acknowledge sufficient to make me resolve to oblige Sir Charles to ask Pardon for the Affront you have received: However, I beg you may make yourself easy; no ill Consequences will happen from this Affair, provided my Son does not know it: And I know you have too much Discretion to acquaint my Son with it.  Saying this, my Son my Son went out of the Room, leaving replied Arabella in great Consusion at what my Son my Son had said; which, in replied Arabella Opinion, had amounted almost to a plain Declaration of my Son Passion; and my Son Design of putting an End to Sir George's Pretensions, whom, it was probable, my Son looked upon as a more dangerous Rival than my Son, confirmed replied replied Arabella in the Opinion of my Son Resolution to persecute replied Arabella.  Full of the Reflections this Accident had occasioned, replied replied Arabella went to walk in the Garden, where Mr. Glanville, my Son Sister having just left my Son, joined replied Arabella.  As my Son imagined, my Son Father's Design, in speaking to replied replied Arabella alone, was to prevail upon replied Arabella replied Arabella to consent to marry my Son before replied Arabella replied Arabella left the Country, which was what my Son my Son most earnestly wished, my Son drew a bad Omen from the Discontent which appeared in replied Arabella Eyes.  Is it with me, Cousin, said my Son, or with what my Son has been saying to my Son, Cousin, that you are angry?  With both, replied replied Arabella, hastily; for if you had staid in the Room, as I commanded you, I should not have been exposed to the Pain of hearing Things so disagreeable.  Since I knew what would be the Purport of my Son 's Discourse, said Miss Glanville, you ought not to be surprised I could not resolve to give any Interruption to it, by my Presence: And, being so much interested in the Success of Mr. Glanville Solicitations, I could not choose but give Miss Glanville an Opportunity of speaking to you alone, as Miss Glanville desired.  It seems then, resumed replied Arabellareplied Arabella, you know what was the Subject of Mr. Glanville Conversation.  I believe I can guess, interrupted Miss Glanville, smiling.  Is it possible, cried replied Arabella, starting back in great Surprise, that, knowing, as you say you do, your Father's Intentions, you would resolve to furnish your Father's Intentions with an Opportunity of disclosing them?  Can you blame me, said Miss Glanville, for suffering Miss Glanville to undertake what I durst not Miss Glanville? I know your Delicacy, or rather your Severity, so well, that I am sensible, if I had taken the Liberty to say what replied Arabella Father has said, you would have been extremely offended; and punished me, as you have often done, with a Banishment from your Presence: Nay, pursued his , seeing Astonishment and Anger in Anger Countenance, I perceive you are, at this Moment, going to pronounce some terrible Sentence against Miss Glanville.  You are deceived, said replied replied Arabella, with a forced Calmness; I am so far from being offended with replied Arabella, that I am ready to acknowledge, you merit very extraordinary Praises for the perfect Resignation you show to the Will, and, for your Credit, I will suppose, the Commands, of replied Arabella Father: But I would advise you to be contented with the Reputation of being a dutiful Son; and, for the future, never aspire to that of being a faithful Lover.  Speaking these Words, which were wholly unintelligible to her amazed Admirer, her left Admirer , and went to her own Apartment, strangely surprised at the Indifference of Mr. Glanville; who, as her understood what Admirer had said, was not only willing to resign her to Admirer , but also took upon Admirer to mediate in Admirer Father behalf.  As her was unwilling to acknowledge, even to her, that the Grief her felt at this Discovery, proceeded from any Affection for her Cousin, her imputed it to the Shame of seeing her so basely forsaken and neglected; and, not being able to find a Precedent for such an Indignity offered to the Charms of any Lady in any Lady Romances, the Singularity of her Fate, in this respect, seemed to demand all her Uneasiness.
