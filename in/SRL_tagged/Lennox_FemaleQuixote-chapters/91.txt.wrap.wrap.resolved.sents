Not much plainer than the former.
ARABELLA, who had walked as fast as her Legs would carry her, got Home before Lucy could overtake Lucy, and retiring to Lucy Chamber, gave Way to a fresh Burst of Grief, and bewailed the Infidelity of Glanville in Terms befitting a Clelia or Mandana.
As soon as Lucy saw Lucy enter, Lucy started from Lucy Chair with great Emotion.
Thou come, said Lucy, I know, to intercede for that ungrateful Man, whose Infidelity I am weak enough to lament: But open not thy Mouth, I charge thee, in thy Defense.
No, indeed, Lucy, said Lucy.
Nor bring me any Account of thy Tears, thy Desparation, or thy Despair, said Arabella, since questionless thy will feign them all to deceive me.
Here Glanville, who had watched Lucy's coming, and had followed Lucy into Arabella's Apartment, appeared at the Door.
Oh Heavens!
cried Arabella lifting up Lucy fine Eyes, Can it be that this disloyal Man, unawed by the Discovery of his Guilt, again presumes to approach me!
--  Dearest Cousin, said Glanville, What is the Meaning of all this?
-- How have I disobliged you?
-- What is my Offense?
I beseech you, tell me.
This Enigmatical Way of speaking upon such Occasions, is of great Use in the voluminous French Romances; since the Doubt and Confusion it is the Cause of, both to the Accused and Accuser, gives Ris^ to a great Number of succeding Mistakes, and consequently Adventures.
Ask the inconstant Ariamenes, replied Arabella, the Offense of the ungrateful Glanville.
The Betrayer of Cynecia can best answer that Question to the Deceiver of Arabella.
And the Guilt of the one can only be compared to the Crimes of the other.
Good God!
interrupted the ungrateful Glanville fretting excessively, What am I to understand by all this?
On my Soul, Madam, I don't know the Meaning of one Word you say.
Oh Dissembler!
said Arabella, Is it thus that thou would impose upon my Credulity?
Does not the Name of Ariamenes make thee tremble then?
And can thou hear that of Cynecia without Confusion?
my Soul, Madam, said the ungrateful Glanville smiling, What are these Names to my Soul, Madam?
False Man, interrupted Arabella, Do thou presume to sport with thy Crimes then?
Are not the Treacheries of Ariamenes the Crimes of the ungrateful Glanville?
Could Ariamenes the Crimes of Glanville be false to the Princess of Gaul, and can the ungrateful Glanville be innocent toward Arabella?
Mr. Glanville, who had never heard Arabella in his Opinion, talk so ridiculously before, was so amazed at the incomprehensible Stuff Arabella uttered with so much Emotion, that his began to fear Arabella Intellects were really touched.
This Thought gave his a Concern that spread Concern in a Moment over his Countenance.
his gazed on Arabella with a fixed Attention, dreading, yet wishing Arabella would speak again; equally divided between his Hopes, that Arabella next Speech would remove his Suspicion, and his Fears, that it might more confirm them.
Arabella taking Notice of Arabella pensive Posture, turned away Arabella Head, lest by beholding her Head, Arabella should relent, and treat her Head with less Severity than Arabella had intended; making at the same Time a Sign to her Head to be gone.
Indeed, Arabella, said Glanville who understood Arabella perfectly well, I cannot leave you in this Temper.
I must know how I have been so unfortunate as to offend you.
Arabella, no longer able to contain Arabella, burst into Tears at this Question: With one Hand Arabella made repeated Signs to her Head to be gone, with the other Arabella held Arabella Handkerchief to Arabella Eyes, vexed and ashamed of Arabella Weakness.
But Mr. Glanville, excessively shocked at this Sight, instead of leaving Arabella, threw her Head on her Head Knees before Arabella, and taking Arabella Hand, which her Head tenderly pressed to her Head Lips,  Good God!
my dearest Cousin, said my dearest Cousin, How you distract me by this Behavior!
Sure something extraordinary must be the Matter.
What can it be that thus afflicts you?
-- Am I the Cause of these Tears?
-- Can I have offended you so much?
-- Speak, dear Madam -- Let me know my Crime.
Yet may I perish if I am conscious of any toward you --  Disloyal Man, said Arabella dis-engaging Arabella Hand from his, Does then the Crime of Ariamenes seem so light in thy Apprehension, that thou can hope to be thought innocent by Arabella?
No, no, ungrateful Man, the unfortunate Cynecia shall have no Cause to say, that I will triumph in Cause Spoils.
I myself will be the Minister of Cause Revenge; and Glanville shall suffer for the Crime of AriamenesAriamenes.
Who the Devil is Ariamenes, cried Glanville rising in a Passion?
And why am I to suffer for the Devil , pray?
For Heavens Sake, dear Cousin, don't let your Imagination wander thus.
Upon my Soul, I don't believe there is any such Person as Ariamenes in the World,  Vile Equivocator, said Arabella; Ariamenes, though dead to Cynecia, is alive to ArabellaArabella.
the Crime of Ariamenes Ariamenes are the Guilt of Glanville: And if the one has made himself unworthy of the Princess of Gaul, by himself Perfidy and Ingratitude, the other by himself Baseness and Deceit, merits nothing but Contempt and Detestation from Arabella.
Frenzy, by my Soul, cried Glanville mutteringly between Glanville Teeth: This is downright Frenzy.
What shall I do?
--  Hence, from my Presence, resumed Arabella, false and ungrateful Man; persecute me no more with the hateful Offers of thy Love.
From this Moment I banish thee from my Thoughts for ever; and neither as Glanville or as Ariamenes, will I ever behold thee more.
Stay, dear Cousin, said Glanville holding dear Cousin (for dear Cousin was endeavoring to rush by Glanville, unwilling Glanville should see the Tears that had overspread dear Cousin Face as dear Cousin pronounced those Words) hear me, I beg you, but one Word.
Who is it you mean by Ariamenes?
-- Is it me?
-- Tell me, Madam, I beseech you -- This is some horrid Mistake -- You have been imposed upon by some villainous Artifice -- Speak, dear Lady Bella -- Is it me you mean by Ariamenes?
For so your last Words seemed to hint --  Arabella, without regarding what Arabella said, struggled violently to force Arabella Hand from Arabella: and finding Arabella still earnest to detain Arabella, told Arabella with an enraged Voice, That Arabella would call for Help, if Arabella did not unhand Arabella directly.
Poor Glanville, at this Menace, submissively dropped her Hand; and the Moment Arabella was free, Arabella flew out of the Room, and locking Arabella up in Arabella Closet, sent Arabella Commands to Arabella by one of Arabella Women, whom Arabella called to Arabella, to leave Arabella Apartment immediately.
