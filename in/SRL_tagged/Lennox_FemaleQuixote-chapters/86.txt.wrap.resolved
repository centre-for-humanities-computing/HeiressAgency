Which ends with a very unfavourable Prediction for our Heroine.  AS soon as they were seated in the Coach our Heroine did not fail to call upon the Coach to perform the Coach Promise: But Mr. Glanville, excessively out of Humor at our Heroine exposing our Heroine in the Gardens, replied, without considering whether the Coach should not offend our Heroine, That the Coach knew no more of the disguised Lady than any body else in the Place.  How, Sir, replied Arabella, Did you not promise to relate Arabella Adventures to Sir? And would you have me believe you knew no more of them than the rest of the Cavaliers and Ladies in the Place?  Upon my Soul, I don't, Sir, said Glanville; yet what I know of our Heroine is sufficient to let me understand our Heroine was not worth the Consideration you seemed to have for our Heroine.  our Heroine cannot sure be more indiscreet than the fair and unfortunate Hermione, replied Arabella; who like our Heroine put on Man's Apparel, through Despair at the ill Success of our Heroine Passion for Alexander -- And certain it is, that though the beautiful Hermione was guilty of one great Error which lost our Heroine the Esteem of Alexander, yet our Heroine had a high and noble Soul; as was manifest by our Heroine Behavior and Words when our Heroine was run through by the Sword of Demetrius. Oh! Death, cried our Heroine, as our Heroine was falling, how sweet do I find our Heroine, and how much and how earnestly have I desired our Heroine!  Oh Lord! oh Lord! cried Glanville hardly sensible of what Glanville said, Was there ever any Thing so intolerable?  Do you pity the beautiful Hermione, Sir? said Arabella interpreting Sir Exclamation our Heroine own Way? Indeed our Heroine is well worthy of your Compassion. And if the bare Recital of the Words our Heroine uttered at receiving our Heroine Death's Wound affects you so much, you may guess what would have been your Agonies, had you been Demetrius that gave it to our Heroine.  Here Glanville groaning aloud through Impatience at our Heroine Absurdities --  This Subject affects you deeply, I perceive, said Arabella. There is no Question but you would have acted in the same Circumstance, as Demetrius did: Yet let me tell you, the Extravagancy of Demetrius Rage and Despair for what Demetrius had innocently committed, was imputed to Demetrius as a great Imbecility, as was also the violent Passion Demetrius conceived soon after for the Fair Deidamia. You know the Accident which brought that fair Princess into Demetrius Way.  Indeed, I do not, our Heroine, said Glanville peevishly.  Well, then I Will tell you, said Arabella, but pausing a little:  The Recital I have engaged our Heroine to make, added Arabella, will necessarily take up some Hours Time, as upon Reflection I have found: So if you will dispense with my beginning it at present, I will satisfy your Curiosity Tomorrow, when I may be able to pursue it without Interruption.  To Glanville made no other Answer than a Bow with Glanville Head; and the Coach a few Moments after arriving at their own House, Glanville led Arabella to Arabella Apartment, firmly resolved never to attend Arabella to any more Public Places while Arabella continued in the same ridiculous Folly.  Sir Charles, who had several Times been in doubt whether Arabella was not really disordered in Arabella Senses; upon Miss Glanville's Account of Arabella Behavior at the Gardens, concluded Arabella was absolutely mad, and held a short Debate with Glanville, Whether Glanville ought not to bring a Commission of Lunacy against Arabella, rather than marry Arabella to Glanville Son, whom Glanville was persuaded could never be happy with a Wife so unaccountably absurd. Though Glanville only hinted at this to Mr. Glanville, in a Conversation Glanville had with Glanville while Glanville Dissatisfaction was at his Dissatisfaction Height, concerning Arabella, yet the bare Supposition that Glanville Father ever thought of such a Thing, threw the young Gentleman into such Agonies, that Sir Charles to compose the young Gentleman, protested Glanville would do nothing in relation to Glanville Niece that Glanville would not approve of. Yet Glanville expostulated with Glanville on the Absurdity of his Niece Behavior, and the Ridicule to which his Niece exposed his Niece wherever his Niece went; appealing to Glanville, whether in a Wife Glanville could think those Follies supportable, which in a Mistress occasioned Glanville so much Confusion.  Mr. Glanville, as much in Love as Glanville was, felt all the Force of this Inference, and acknowledged to his Father, That Glanville could not think of marrying Arabella, till the Whims his Niece Romances had put into his Niece Head, were crazed by a better Knowledge of Life and Manners. But Glanville added with a Sigh, That Glanville knew not how this Reformation would be effected; for his Niece had such a strange Facility in reconciling every Incident to his Niece own fantastic Ideas, that every new Object added Strength to the fatal Deception his Niece labored under.
