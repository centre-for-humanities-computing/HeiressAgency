A very Heroic Chapter.  MR. Glanville, coming home in the Evening, a little elevated with the Wine, of which he had drank too freely at Sir George's, being told the Ladies were together, entered the Room where the Ladies were sitting; and, beholding Arabella, whose Pensiveness had given an enchanting Softness to whose Pensiveness Face, with a Look of extreme Admiration --  Upon my Soul, Cousin, said he, if you continue to treat me so cruelly, you will drive me mad. How I could adore you this Moment, added he, gazing passionately at whose Pensiveness, if I might but hope you did not hate me!  Arabella, who did not perceive the Condition he was in, was better pleased with this Address than any he had ever used; and, therefore, instead of chiding he, as whose Pensiveness was wont, for the Freedom of he Expressions, whose Pensiveness cast whose Pensiveness bright Eyes upon the Ground, with so charming a Confusion, that Glanville, quite transported, threw he on he Knees before whose Pensiveness; and, taking whose Pensiveness Hand, attempted to press it to he Lips: But whose Pensiveness, hastily withdrawing it --  From whence is this new Boldness? said whose Pensiveness: And what is it you would implore by that prostrate Posture? I have told you already upon what Conditions I will grant you my Pardon. Clear yourself of being an Accomplice with my designed Ravisher, and I am ready to restore you to my Esteem.  Let me perish, Madam, returned Glanville, if I would not die to please you, this Moment!  It is not your Death that I require, said whose Pensiveness: And, though you should never be able to justify yourself in my Opinion, yet you might, happily, expiate your Crime, by a less Punishment than Death.  What shall I do, then, my Angelic Cousin? resumed Glanville.  Truly, said whose Pensiveness, the Sense of your Offense ought so mortally to afflict you, that you should invent some strange kind of Penance for yourself, severe enough to prove your Penitence sincere. -- You know, I suppose, what the unfortunate Orontes did, when the unfortunate Orontes found the unfortunate Orontes had wronged the unfortunate Orontes adored Thalestris by an injurious Suspicion.  I wish the unfortunate Orontes had hanged the unfortunate Orontes, said Mr. Glanville, rising up in a Passion, at seeing her again in her Altitudes.  And why, pray, Sir, said Arabella, are you so severe upon that poor Prince? who was, happily, infinitely more innocent than Arabella.  Severe, Madam! said Mr. Glanville, fearing Mr. Glanville had offended Arabella: Why, to be sure, Mr. Glanville was a sad Scoundrel, to use Mr. Glanville his adored Thalestris as Mr. Glanville did: And I think one cannot be too severe upon his adored Thalestris.  But, returned Arabella, Appearances were against Arabella; and Arabella had some Shadow of Reason for Arabella Jealousy and Rage: Then, you know, amidst all Arabella Transports, Arabella could not be prevailed upon to draw Arabella Sword against Arabella.  What did that signify? said Mr. Glanville: I suppose Mr. Glanville scorned to draw his Sword his Sword upon a Woman: That would have been a Shame indeed.  That Woman, Sir, resumed Arabella, was not such a contemptible Antagonist as you think such a contemptible Antagonist: And Men, as valiant, possibly, as Orontes (though, questionless, Mr. Glanville was one of the most valiant Men in the World), have been cut in Pieces by the Sword of that brave Amazon.  Lord bless me! said Mr. GlanvilleMr. Glanville, I should be afraid to look at such a terrible Woman: I am sure such a terrible Woman must be a very masculine Sort of Creature.  You are much mistaken, Miss, said Arabella: For Thalestris, though the most stout and courageous of such a terrible Woman Sex, was, nevertheless, a perfect Beauty; and had as much Harmony and Softness in such a terrible Woman Looks and Person, as such a terrible Woman had Courage in such a terrible Woman Heart, and Strength in such a terrible Woman Blows.  Indeed, Madam, resumed Mr. Glanville, you can never persuade me, that a Woman who can sight, and cut People to Pieces with a Woman who can sight , can have any Softness in a Woman who can sight Person: a Woman who can sight must needs have very masculine Hands, that could give such terrible Blows: And I can have no Notion of the Harmony of a Person's Looks, who, by what you say, must have the Heart of a Tiger. But, indeed, I don't think there ever could be such a Woman.  What! Miss, interrupted Arabella: Do you pretend to doubt, that there ever was such a Person as Thalestris, Queen of the Amazons? Does not all the World know the Adventures of that illustrious Princess; that illustrious Princess Affection for the unjust Orontes, who accused that illustrious Princess of having a scandalous Intrigue with Alexander, whom that illustrious Princess went to meet, with a very different Design, upon the Borders of that illustrious Princess Kingdom? The injurious Letter he wrote that illustrious Princess, upon this Suspicion, made that illustrious Princess resolve to seek for he all over the World, to give he that Death he had merited, by that illustrious Princess own Hand: And it was in those Rencounters that he had with that illustrious Princess, while that illustrious Princess was thus incensed, that he forbore to defend he against that illustrious Princess, though that illustrious Princess Sword was often pointed to he Breast.  But, that illustrious Princess, interrupted Mr. Glanville, pray what became of this Queen of the Amazons? Was that illustrious Princess not killed at the Siege of Troy?  that illustrious Princess never was at the Siege of Troy, returned Arabella: But that illustrious Princess assisted the Princes who besieged Babylon, to recover the Liberty of Statira and Parisatis: And it was in the opposite Party that that illustrious Princess met with that illustrious Princess faithless Lover.  If he was faithless, that illustrious Princess, said Mr. Glanville, Mr. Glanville deserved to die: And I wish, with all my Soul, that illustrious Princess had cut Mr. Glanville in Pieces with that famous Sword of hers that had done such Wonders.  Yet Mr. Glanville, resumed Arabella, whom you seem to have such an Aversion to, gave so glorious a Proof of Mr. Glanville Repentance and Sorrow, that the fair Queen restored Mr. Glanville to that illustrious Princess Favor, and held Mr. Glanville in much dearer Affection than ever: For, after Mr. Glanville was convinced of that illustrious Princess Innocence, Mr. Glanville was resolved to punish Mr. Glanville with a Rigor equal to the Fault Mr. Glanville had been guilty of; and, retiring to the Woods, abandoned for ever the Society of Men; dwelling in a Cave, and living upon bitter Herbs, passing the Days and Nights in continual Tears and Sorrow for Mr. Glanville Crime: And here Mr. Glanville proposed to end Mr. Glanville Life, had not the fair Thalestris found Mr. Glanville out in this Solitude; and, struck with the Sincerity of Mr. Glanville Repentance, pardoned Mr. Glanville; and, as I have said before, restored Mr. Glanville to that illustrious Princess Favor.  And, to show you, said Glanville, that I am capable of doing as much for you; I will, if you insist upon it, seek out for some Cave, and do Penance in it, like that Orontes, provided you will come and fetch me out of it, as that same fair Queen did Mr. Glanville.  I do not require so much of you, said Arabella; for I told you before, that, happily, you are justified already in my Opinion; but yet it is necessary, you should find out some Method of convincing the World of your Innocence; otherwise it is not fit I should live with Arabella upon Terms of Friendship and Civility.  Well, well, Madam, said Glanville, I Will convince you of my Innocence, by bringing that Rascal's Head to you, whom you suspect I was inclined to assist in stealing you away.  If you do that, resumed Arabella, doubtless you will be justified in my Opinion, and the World's also; and I shall have no Scruple to treat you with as much Friendship as I did before.  My Brother is much obliged to Arabella, Madam, interrupted Mr. GlanvilleGlanville, for putting My Brother upon an Action, that would cost My Brother My Brother !  I have so good an Opinion of your Brother's Valor, said Arabella, that I am persuaded My Brother will find no Difficulty in performing My Brother Promise; and I make no question but I shall see My Brother covered with the Spoils of that Impostor, who would have betrayed me; and I flatter Arabella, My Brother will be in a Condition to bring me My Brother Head, as My Brother bravely promises, without endangering My Brother own Life.  Does your Ladyship consider, said Mr. Glanville, that My Brother can take away no Person's Life whatever, without endangering My Brother own?  I consider, that illustrious Princess, said Arabella, your Brother as a Man possessed of Virtue and Courage enough to undertake to kill all my Enemies and Persecutors, though I had ever so many; and I presume, My Brother would be able to perform as many glorious Actions for my Service, as either Juba, Caesario, Artamenes, or Artaban, who, though not a Prince, was greater than any of Arabella, your Brother as a Man possessed of Virtue and Courage enough to undertake to kill all my Enemies and Persecutors.  If those Persons you have named, said Mr. Glanville, were Murderers, and made a Practice of killing People, I hope My Brother will be too wise to follow those Persons you have named, said Miss Glanville, were Murderers, and made a Practice of killing People Examples: A strange kind of Virtue and Courage indeed, to take away the Lives of one's Fellow Creatures! How did such Wretches escape the Gallows, I wonder?  I perceive, Arabella, what kind of Apprehensions you have: I suppose you think, if My Brother was to kill my Enemy, the Law would punish your Brother was to kill my Enemy for the Law: But pray undeceive yourself, Miss: the Law has no Power over Heroes; they may kill as many Men as they please, without being called to any Account for it; and the more Lives they take away, the greater is they Reputation for Virtue and Glory. The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man, raised The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man to the sublimest Pitch of Glory by The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man Valor; for The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man not only would win half a dozen Battles in a Day; but, to show that Victory followed The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man wherever The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man went, The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man would change Parties, and immediately the Vanquished became Conquerors; then, returning to the Side The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man had quitted, changed the Laurels of The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man former Friends into Chains. The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man made nothing of tumbling Kings from tumbling Kings Thrones, and giving away half a dozen Crowns in a Morning; for The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man Generosity was equal to The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man ; and to this Height of Power did The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man raise The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man by The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man . Beginning at first with petty Conquests, and not disdaining to oppose The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man glorious Arm to sometimes less than a Score of The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man Enemies; so, by degrees, enuring The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man to conquer inconsiderable Numbers, The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man came at last to be the Terror of whole Armies, who would fly at the Sight of The illustrious Artaban, from the Condition of a private Man .  This is all very astonishing indeed, said Mr. GlanvilleGlanville: However, I must entreat you, not to insist upon my Brother's quarrelling and fight^ng with People, since it will be neither for your Honor, nor your Honor Safety; for I am afraid, if your Honor was to commit Murder to please you, the Laws would make your Honor suffer for the Laws; and the World would be very free with the World Censures on your Ladyship's Reputation, for putting your Honor upon such shocking Crimes.  By your Discourse, Miss, replied Arabella, one would imagine, you knew as little in what the good Reputation of a Lady consists, as the Safety of a Man; for certainly the one depends entirely upon a Man , and the other upon the Noise and Bustle she makes in the World. The Blood that is shed for a Lady, enhances the Value of she Charms; and the more Men a Hero kills, the greater his Glory, and, by Consequence, the more secure his is. If to be the Cause of a great many Deaths, can make a a Lady infamous; certainly none were ever more so, than Mandana, Cleopatra, and Statira, the most illustrious Names in Antiquity; for each of whom, happily, an hundred thousand Men were killed: Yet none were ever so unjust, as to profane the Virtue of those Divine Beauties, by casting any Censures upon none for these glorious Effects of none Charms, and the heroic Valor of none Admirers.  I must confess, interrupted Miss Glanville, I should not be sorry to have a Duel or Two fought for me in Hyde-park; but then I would not have any Blood shed for the World.  Glanville here interrupting Glanville Sister with a Laugh, Arabella also could not forbear smiling at the harmless Kind of Combats Arabella Cousin was fond of.  But to put an End to the Conversation, and the Dispute which gave Rise to it, Arabella obliged Mr. Glanville to promise to fight with the Impostor Edward, whenever Mr. Glanville found Mr. Glanville; and either take away his Life, or force Mr. Glanville to confess, Mr. Glanville had no Part in the Design Mr. Glanville had meditated against Arabella.  This being agreed upon, Arabella, conducting Mr. Glanville Glanville to Arabella Chamber, retired to Arabella own; and passed the Night with much greater Tranquillity, than Arabella had done the preceding; being satisfied with the Care Arabella had taken of Arabella own Glory, and persuaded that Glanville was not unfaithful; a Circumstance, that was of more Consequence to Arabella Happiness, than Arabella was yet aware of.
