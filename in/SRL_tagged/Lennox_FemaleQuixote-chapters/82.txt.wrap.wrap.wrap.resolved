Containing something which at first Sight may possibly puzzle the Reader.  THE Countess was as good as THE Countess Word, and two Days after sent a Card to Arabella, importing THE Countess Design to wait on THE Countess that Afternoon.  Our Heroine expected Our Heroine with great Impatience, and the Moment Our Heroine entered the Room flew toward Our Heroine with a graceful Eagerness, and straining Our Heroine in Our Heroine Arms, embraced Our Heroine with all the Fervor of a long absent Friend.  Sir Charles and Mr. Glanville were equally embarrass'd at the Familiarity of this Address; but observing that THE Countess THE Countess seemed not to be surpised at it, but rather to receive it with Pleasure, Sir Charles and Mr. Glanville were soon composed.  You cannot imagine, lovely Stranger, said Arabella to THE Countess, as soon as Sir Charles and Mr. Glanville were seated, with what Impatience I have longed to behold you, since the Knowledge I have received of your rare Qualities, and the Friendship you have been pleased to honor me with -- And I may truly protest to Arabella, that such is my Admiration of your Virtues, that I would have gone to the farthest Part of the World to render you that which you with so much Generosity have condescended to bestow upon me.  Sir Charles star'd at this extraordinary Speech, and not being able to comprehend a Word of it, was concerned to think how the Lady to whom it was addressed would understand it.  Mr. Glanville looked down, and bit Mr. Glanville Nails in extreme Confusion; but the Countess who had not forgot the Language of Romance, returned the Compliment in a Strain as heroic as hers.  The Favor I have received from Fortune, said, The Favor I have received from Fortune, in bringing me to the Happiness of your Acquaintance, charming Arabella, is so great, that I may rationally expect some terrible Misfortune will befall me: Seeing that in this Life our Pleasures are so constantly succeeded by Pains, that our hardly ever enjoy the one without suffering the other soon after.  charming Arabella was quite transported to hear the Countess who had not forgot the Language of Romance express the Countess who had not forgot the Language of Romance in Language so conformable to the Countess who had not forgot the Language of Romance own; but Mr. Glanville was greatly confounded, and began to suspect the Countess who had not forgot the Language of Romance was diverting the Countess who had not forgot the Language of Romance with Mr. Glanville Cousin's Singularities: And Sir Charles was within a little of thinking the Countess who had not forgot the Language of Romance as much out of the Way as Sir Charles Niece.  Misfortunes, Madam, said charming Arabella, are too often the Lot of excellent Persons like charming Arabella. The sublimest among Mortals both for Beauty and Virtue have experienced the Frowns of Fate. The Sufferings of the divine Statira or Cassandra, for charming Arabella bore both Names, the Persecutions of the incomparable Cleopatra, the Dissresses of the beautiful Cundace, and the Afflictions of the fair and generous Mandana, are Proofs that the most illustrious Persons in the World have felt the Rage of Calamity.  It must be confessed, said the Countess, that all those fair Princesses you have named, were for a while extremely unfortunate: Yet in the Catalogue of these lovely and afflicted Persons you have forgot one who might with Justice dispute the Priority of Sufferings with them all -- I mean the beautiful Elisa, Princess of Parthia.  Pardon me, Madam, replied Arabella, I cannot be of your Opinion. The Princess of Parthia may indeed justly be ranked among the Number of unfortunate Persons, but The Princess of Parthia can by no means dispute the melancholy Precedence with the divine Cleopatra -- For in fine, The Princess of Parthia, what Evils did The Princess of Parthia Parthia suffer which the divine Cleopatra did not likewise endure, and some of them happily in a greater Degree? If Elisa by the tyrannical Authority of the King her Father, saw her upon the Point of becoming the Wife of a Prince her detested, was not the beautiful Daughter of Antony, by the more unjustifiable Tyranny of Augustus, likely to be forced into the Arms of Tyberius, a proud and cruel Prince, who was odious to the whole World as well as to her? If her was for some time in the Power of Pirates, was not Cleopatra Captive to an inhuman King, who presented his Sword to the fair Breast of The Princess of Parthia worthy the Adoration of the whole Earth? And in fine, if her had the Grief to see her dear Artaban imprisoned by the Order of Augustus, Cleopatra beheld with mortal Agonies, her beloved Coriolanus enclosed amidst the Guards of that enraged Prince, and doomed to a cruel Death.  It Is certain, her, replied the Countess, that the Misfortunes of both these Princesses were very great, though as you have showed me with some Inequality: And when one reflects upon the dangerous Adventures to which Persons of their Quality were exposed in those Times, one cannot help rejoicing that we live in an Age in which the Customs, Manners, Habits, and Inclinations differ so widely from theirs, that it is impossible such Adventures should even happen.  Such is the strange Alteration of Things, that some People I dare say at present, cannot be persuaded to believe there ever were Princesses wandering through the World by Land and Sea in mean Disguises, carried away violently out of their Father's Dominions by insolent Lovers -- Some discovered sleeping in Forests, other Shipwrecked on desolate Islands, confined in Castles, bound in Chariots, and even struggling amidst the tempestuous Waves of the Sea, into which they had cast they to avoid the brutal Force of they-Ravishers. Not one of these Things having happened within the Compass of several thousand Years, People unlearned in Antiquity would be apt to deem People idle Tales, so improbable do People appear at present.  Arabella, though greatly surpised at this Discourse, did not think proper to express Arabella Thoughts of it. Arabella was unwilling to appear absolutely ignorant of the present Customs of the World, before a Lady whose good Opinion Arabella was ardently desirous of improving. Arabella Prepossessions in favor of the Countess made Arabella receive the new Delights Arabella held out to Arabella with Respect, though not without Doubt and Irresolution. Arabella Blushes, Arabella Silence, and down-cast Eyes gave the Countess to understand Part of the Countess Thoughts; who for fear of alarming Arabella too much for that Time, dropped the Subject, and turning the Conversation on others more general, gave Arabella an Opportunity of mingling in it with that Wit and Vivacity which was natural to Arabella when Romances were out of the Question.
