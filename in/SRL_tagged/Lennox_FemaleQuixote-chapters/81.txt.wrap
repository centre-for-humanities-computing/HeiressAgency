In which is introduced a very singular Character.  MISS Glanville, whose Envy and Dislike of her lovely Cousin was heightened by her Suspicions that she disputed with her the Possession of Sir George's Heart, she having been long in reality a great Admirer of that gay Gentleman, was extremely delighted with the Ridicule her absurd Behavior had drawn upon her at Bath, which she found by Enquiry was through Mr. Tinsel's Representation grown almost general.  In order therefore to be at Liberty to go to the Public Places un-eclips'd by the superior Beauty of Arabella, she acquainted her Father and Brother with Part of what she had heard, which determined them to prevent that young Lady's Appearance in Public while they staid at Bath; this being no difficult Matter to bring about, since Arabella only went to the Rooms or Parade in Compliance with the Invitation of her Cousins.  Miss Glanville being by these Means rid of a Rival too powerful even to contend with, went with more than usual Gaiety to the Assembly, where the Extravagancies of Arabella afforded a perpetual Fund for Diversion. Her more than passive Behavior upon this Occasion, banishing all Restraint among those she conversed with, the Jest circulated very freely at Arabella's Expense. Nor did Miss Glanville fail to give new Poignancy to their Sarcasms, by artfully disclosing the bent of her Cousin's Studies, and enumerating the many Absurdities they had made her guilty of.  Arabella's uncommon Beauty had gained her so many Enemies among the Ladies that composed this Assembly, that they seemed to contend with each other who should ridicule her most. The celebrated Countess of -- being then at Bath, approached a Circle of these fair Defamers, and listening a few Moments to the contemptuous Jests they threw out against the absent Beauty, declared herself in her Favor; which in a Moment, such was the Force of her universally acknowledged Merit, and the Deference always paid to her Opinion, silenced every pretty Impertinent around her.  This Lady, who among her own Sex had no Superior in Wit, Elegance, and Ease, was inferior to very few of the other in Sense, Learning, and Judgment. Her Skill in Poetry, Painting, and Music, though incontestably great, was numbered among the least of her Accomplishments. Her Candor, her Sweetness, her Modesty and Benevolence, while they secured her from the Darts of Envy, rendered her superior to Praise, and made the one as unnecessary as the other ineffectual.  She had been a Witness of the Surprise Arabella's extraordinary Appearance had occasioned, and struck with that as well as the uncommon Charms of her Person, had pressed near her with several others of the Company, when she was discoursing in the Manner we have related.  A Person of the Countess's nice Discernment could not fail of observing the Wit and Spirit, which though obscured, was not absolutely hid under the Absurdity of her Notions. And this Discovery adding Esteem to the Compassion she felt for the fair Visionary, she resolved to rescue her from the ill-natured Raillery of her Sex; praising therefore her Understanding, and the Beauty of her Person with a Sweetness and Generosity peculiar to herself, she accounted in the most delicate Manner imaginable for the Singularity of her Notions, from her Studies, her Retirment, her Ignorance of the World, and her lively Imagination. And to abate the Keenness of their Sarcasms, acknowledged, that she herself had when very young, been deep read in Romances; and but for an early Acquaintance with the World, and being directed to other Studies, was likely to have been as much a Heroine as Lady Bella.  Miss Glanville, though she was secretly vexed at this Defense of her Cousin, was however under a Necessity of seeming obliged to the Countess for it: And that Lady expressing a Desire to be acquainted with Lady Bella, Miss Glanville respectfully offered to attend her Cousin to her Lodgings, which the Countess as respectfully declined, saying, As Lady Bella was a Stranger, she would make her the first Visit.  Miss Glanville at her Return gave her Brother an Account of what had happened at the Assembly, and filled him with an inconceivable Joy at the Countess's Intention. He had always been a zealous Admirer of that Lady's Character, and flattered himself that the Conversation of so admirable a Woman would be of the utmost Use to Arabella.  That very Night he mentioned her to his beloved Cousin; and after enumerating all her fine Qualities, declared that she had already conceived a Friendship for her, and was solicitous of her Acquaintance.  I think myself extremely fortunate, replied Arabella, in that I have (though questionless undeservedly) acquired the Amity of this lovely Person; and I beg you, pursued she to Miss Glanville, to tell her, that I long with Impatience to embrace her, and to give her that Share in my Heart which her transcendent Merit deserves.  Miss Glanville only bowed her Head in Answer to this Request, giving her Brother at the same Time a significant Leer; who though used to Arabella's Particularities, could not help being a little confounded at the heroic Speech she had made.
