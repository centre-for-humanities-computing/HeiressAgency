A Mistake, which produces no great Consequences -- An extraordinary Comment upon a Behavior natural enough -- An Instance of a Lady's Compassion for a Lady Lover, which the Reader may possibly think not very compassionate.  HERVEY, who was Master of no great Elegance in Letter-writing, was at first at some Loss, how to address a Lady of her Quality, to whom he was an absolute Stranger, upon the Subject of Love; but, conceiving there was no great Occasion for much Ceremony in declaring he to one who had been educated in the Country, and who, he believed, could not be displeased with a Lover of he Figure, he therefore, in plain Terms, told her, how deeply he was enamoured of her; and conjured her to afford he some Opportunity of paying he Respects to her.  her received this Letter from he with a worse Grace than her did the Gold; and, though her promised he to deliver this Letter to her Lady immediately, yet her Lady her Lady kept this Letter a Day or two before her Lady had the Courage to attempt this Letter: At last, drawing this Letter out of her Lady Lady Pocket, with a bashful Air, her Lady her Lady presented this Letter to her Lady, telling her Lady this Letter came from the fine Gentleman whom her Lady her Lady saw at Church.  Arabella blushed at the Sight of this Letter; and though, in Reality, Arabella was not displeased, yet, being a strict Observer of romantic Forms, Arabella chid Arabella Woman severely for taking it. Carry it back, added Arabella, to the presumptuous Writer of it; and let the presumptuous Writer of it know how greatly the presumptuous Writer of it Insolence has offended me.  Lucy, however, suffered this Letter to remain on the Toilet, expecting some Change in Arabella 's Mind; for Arabella traversed the Chamber in great seeming Irresolution, often stealing a Glance to the Letter, which Arabella had a strong Inclination to open; but, searching the Records of Arabella Memory for a Precedent, and not finding, that any Lucy Lady ever opened a Letter from an unknown Lover, Arabella reiterated Arabella Commands to Lucy to carry it back, with a Look and Accent so very severe, that the Girl, extremely apprehensive of having offended Lucy, put this Letter again in Lucy Pocket, resolving to return this Letter the first Opportunity.  Mr. Hervey, who had his Thoughts wholly taken up with the flattering Prospect of Success, no sooner saw Lucy, who gave his his Letter without speaking a Word, than, supposing speaking a Word had been the Answer his expected, his eagerly snatched speaking a a Word out of Lucy Hand, and, kissing speaking a Word first in a Rapture of Joy, broke speaking a Word open; but his Surprise and Confusion, when his saw it was his own this Letter this Letter returned, was inexpressible. For some Moments his kept his Eyes fastened upon the tender Billet, as if his was really reading it. his Disappointment, and the ridiculous Figure his knew his must make in his Eyes Messenger, filled his with so much Confusion, that his did not dare to look up; but, recovering his at last, his affected to turn it into a Jest; and, laughing first his, gave Lucy the Liberty of laughing also, who had with much Difficulty been able to prevent doing it before.  The Curiosity his felt to hear how Lucy had acquitted Lucy of the Trust Lucy of the Trust had reposed in Lucy, made Lucy of the Trust oblige Lucy to give a Truce to Lucy Mirth, in order to satisfy Lucy of the Trust; and Lucy, who was extremely exact in Lucy Relations, told Lucy of the Trust all that had passed, without omitting the smallest Circumstance.  Though it was impossible to draw any favorable Omen from what Lucy of the Trust heard, yet Lucy of the Trust determined to make another Effort, before Lucy of the Trust set out for London; and, taking Leave of Lucy of the Trust Confident, after Lucy of the Trust had appointed Lucy to meet Lucy of the Trust again the next Day, at Lucy Brother's, Lucy of the Trust went home to consider upon Means to effect Lucy of the Trust Designs, which the ill Success of Lucy of the Trust first Attempt had not forced Lucy of the Trust to abandon.  Arabella, who expected to hear, that the Return of Lucy of the Trust Letter would make Lucy Brother's commit some very extravagant Actions; and having impatiently waited for an Account of some very extravagant Actions from Lucy; finding Lucy seemed to have no Intention to begin a Discourse concerning Lucy of the Trust; asked Lucy, at last, If Lucy had executed Lucy Commission, and returned his Letter to the insolent Unknown?  Lucy answered, Yes.  Which not being all that Lucy expected, And how did Lucy of the Trust receive it? resumed Lucy, peevishly.  Why Lucy Brother's, replied Lucy, I believe Lucy of the Trust thought your Ladyship had sent Lucy of the Trust an Answer; for Lucy of the Trust kissed his Letter several times.  Foolish Wench! replied Arabella, How can you imagine Lucy of the Trust had the Temerity to think I should answer his Letter? A Favor, which, though Lucy of the Trust had spent Years in my Service, would have been infinitely greater than Lucy of the Trust could have expected. No, Lucy, Lucy of the Trust kissed his Letter, either because Lucy of the Trust thought his Letter his Letter had been touched at least by my Hands, or to show the perfect Submission with which Lucy of the Trust received my Commands; and it is not to be doubted, but Lucy of the Trust Despair will force Lucy of the Trust to commit some desperate Outrage against Lucy of the Trust, which I do not hate Lucy of the Trust enough to wish, though Lucy of the Trust has mortally offended me.  Arabella was possessed of great Sensibility and Softness; and, being really persuaded, that Arabella Lover would entertain some fatal Design, seemed so much affected with the Thoughts of what might happen, that Lucy, who tenderly loved Arabella, begged Arabella not to be so much concerned for the Gentleman: There is no Fear, added Arabella, that he will do he a Mischief; for when he discovered he Mistake, he laughed heartily, as well as he.  How! replied Arabella, extremely surprised, Did he laugh?  Which Lucy confirming, Doubtless, resumed Which Lucy, having taken a little Time to consider of so strange a Phenomenon, he laughed, because he Reason was disturbed at the sudden Shock he received: Unhappy Man! he Presumption will be severely enough punished, though I do not add Anger to the Scorn which I have expressed for he: Therefore, Lucy, you may tell he, if you please, that, notwithstanding the Offense he has been guilty of, I am not cruel enough to wish he Death; and that I command he to live, if he can live without Hope.
