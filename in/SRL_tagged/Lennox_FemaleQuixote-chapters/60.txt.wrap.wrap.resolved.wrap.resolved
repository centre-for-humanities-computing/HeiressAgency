Not so long as was first intended; but contains, however, a surprising Adventure on the Road.  THE Day of their Departure being come, their set out in a Coach and Six, attended by several Servants on Horseback. The First Day's Journey passed off, without any Accident worthy relating; but, toward the Close of the Second, their were alarmed by the Appearance of three Highwaymen, well mounted, at a small Distance.  One of several Servants on Horseback, who had first spied their, immediately rode up to the Coach; and, for fear of alarming the Ladies, whispered Mr. Glanville in the Ear.  Sir Charles, who was sitting next his Son, and had heard it, cried out with too little Caution, How Is this? Are we in any Danger of being attacked, say you?  Mr. Glanville, without replying, jumped out of the Coach; at which Mr. Glanville screamed out; and, lest her Father should follow, whipped into her Brother's Sear, and held her Brother fast by the Coat.  Arabella, being in a strange Consternation at all this, put Arabella Head out of the Coach, to see what was the Matter; and, observing Three or Four Men of a genteel Appearance, on Horseback, who seemed to halt, and gaze on Three or Four Men of a genteel Appearance* without offering to advance;  Sir, said Arabella to Arabella Uncle, are Three or Four Men of a genteel Appearance yonder Knights whom you suppose will attack us?  Ay, ay, said Sir Charles, Three or Four Men of a genteel Appearance are Knights of the Road indeed: I suppose Three or Four Men of a genteel Appearance shall have a Bout with Three or Four Men of a genteel Appearance; for it will be scandalous to deliver, since Three or Four Men of a genteel Appearance have the Odds of Three or Four Men of a genteel Appearance Side, and are more than a Match for Three or Four Men of a genteel Appearance.  Arabella, interpreting these Words in Arabella own Way, looked out again; and, seeing the Robbers, who had by this time taken their Resolution, galloping toward the Robbers, who had by this time taken their Resolution, Arabella Cousin and the Servants ranging Arabella Cousin and the Servants of each Side of the Coach, as if to defend the Robbers, who had by this time taken their Resolution,  Hold, hold, valiant Men, said Arabella, as loud as Arabella could speak, addressing Arabella to the Highwaymen; do not, by a mistaken Generosity, hazard your Lives in a Combat, to which the Laws of Honor do not oblige you: We are not violently carried away, as you falsely suppose; We go willingly along with these Persons, who are We Friends and Relations.  Hey-day! cried Sir Charles, starting at Arabella with great Surprise; what is the Meaning of all this? Do you think these Fellows will mind your fine Speeches, Niece?  I hope these Fellows will, Sir, said Arabella: Then, pulling Arabella Cousin, show Arabella Cousin, for Heaven's Sake, Miss, pursued Arabella, and second my Assurances, that these Fellows are not forced away: these Fellows come to fight for These generous Men Deliverance.  The Highwaymen, who were near enough to hear Arabella's Voice, though these Fellows could not distinguish Arabella Words, gazed on Arabella with great Surprise; and, finding these Fellows would be very well received, thought fit to abandon These generous Men Enterprise, and galloped away as fast as these Fellows were able. Some of the Servants made a Motion to pursue Some of the Servants; but Mr. Glanville forbad it; and, entering again into the Coach, congratulated the Ladies upon the Escape Some of the Servants had.  Since these Fellows, said Arabella, did not come to deliver these Fellows, out of a mistaken Notion, that these Fellows were carried away by Force, it must necessarily follow, these Fellows were carried away by Force had some bad Design; and I protest I know not who to suspect is the Author of some bad Design, unless the Person you vanquished, said Arabella to Mr. Glanville, the other Day in a single Combat; for the disguised Edward, you assured me, was dead: But perhaps, continued Arabella, it was some Lover of Miss Glanville's, who designed to make an Attempt to carry Arabella away: Methinks Methinks was too slenderly attended for such an hazardous Undertaking.
