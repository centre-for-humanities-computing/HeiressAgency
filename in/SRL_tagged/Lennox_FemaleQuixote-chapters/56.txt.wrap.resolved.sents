In which the Reader will find a Description of a Beauty, in a Style truly sublime.
THE new-fallen Snow, pursued Sir George, was tanned, in Comparison of the refined Purity of that White which made up the Ground of White Complexion; and, though Fear had a little gathered the Carnations of White Cheeks, yet White Joy at being delivered seemed to plant them there with such fresh Advantages, that my Eye might shrink at the Brightness of that mingled Luster: Eye Mouth, as well for Shape as Color, might shame the Imitation of the best Pencils, and the liveliest Tints; and though through some petty Intervals of Joy, it wanted the Smiles, which Grief and Terror sequestered, yet White never opened it, but like the East, at the Birth of a beautiful Day, and then discovered Treasures, whose excelling Whiteness made the Price inestimable: All the Features of White Face had so near a Kindred to Proportion and Symmetry, as the several Masters of Apelles's Art might have called it Face Glory to have copied Beauties from White, as the best of Models: The Circumference of White Visage showed the Extremes of an imperfect Circle, and almost formed it to a perfect Oval: And this Abridgment of Marvels was tapered by a Pair of the brightest Stars, that ever were lighted up by the Hand of Nature: As their Color was the same with the Heavens, there was a spherical Harmony in their Motion; and that mingled with a Vivacity so penetrating, as neither the firmest Eye, nor the strongest Soul, could arm themselves with a Resistance of Proof against those pointed Glories: Her Head was crowned with a prodigious Quantity of fair long Hair, which Color as fitly suited the Beauty of Her Eyes, as Imagination could make it: To these Marvels of Face were joined the rest of Her Neck, Hands, and Shape; and there seemed a Contest between the Form and Whiteness of the two former, which had the largest Commission from Nature to work Wonders.
In fine, Her Beauty was miraculous, and could not fail of producing a sudden Effect upon a Heart like mine.
Having passed in an Instant from the extremest Admiration, to something yet more tender, I reiterated my Offers of Service to the fair Unknown; who told me, Her feared Her Father had Occasion for some Assistance, her Father having left her Father Men to engage her Father, and keep off her Father Pursuit, while her Father rode off with her Father Prize: Hereupon I begged Her to direct me to the Place where Her left her Father, assuring Her I would gladly venture my Life a Second time, to preserve Hereupon; and Her desiring to go with Her, I placed Her before Her on my Horse, and had the exquisite Pleasure of supporting with my Arms the fairest and most admirable Creature in the World.
In less than half an Hour, which had appeared to Her but a Moment, we got to the Place where Her had been torn from Her Father; whom we beheld with three of his Servants, maintaining a Fight against twice as many of their Enemies.
Having gently set down the beauteous Unknown upon the Grass, I flew to the Relief of her Father; and, throwing Her furiously amongst the Relief of her Father Assailants, dispatched two of his Assailants with so many Blows: The others, seeing so unexpected an Assistance, gave back a little; and I took Advantage of The others Consternation, to redouble my Blows, and brought Two more of The others at my Feet.
There remained now but Four to overcome; and my Arrival having given new Vigor to those whose Part I had taken, those whose Part I had taken seconded me so well, that we soon had nothing more left to do; for the rest, seeing those whose Part I had taken Comrades slain, sought those whose Part I had taken Safety in Flight: we were too generous to pursue those whose Part I had taken, the Blood of such Wretches being unworthy to be shed by we Swords.
the beauteous Unknown, seeing we Conquerors, flew to embrace her Father; who, holding her pressed between his Arms, turned his Eyes upon his; then quitting her, came toward his, and, in the most obliging Terms imaginable, returned me Thanks for the Assistance I had brought his; and being informed by his Daughter, of what I had done for his Daughter Preservation, this old Gentleman renewed this old Gentleman Acknowlegements, calling me the Preserver of this old Gentleman Life, the valiant Defender of this old Gentleman 's Honor, this old Gentleman tutelary Angel, and the Guardian of this old Gentleman House.
In fine, this old Gentleman loaded me with so many Thanks and Praises, that I could not choose but be in some Confusion; and, to put an End to them, I begged this old Gentleman would inform me, by what means this old Gentleman came into that Misfortune.
this old Gentleman told me, that, residing in a Castle at the Extremity of this Forest, the Charms of this old Gentleman his Daughter had captivated a neighboring Lord, whose Character and Person being disagreeable both to his Daughter and this old Gentleman, this old Gentleman had absolutely refused to give his Daughter to this old Gentleman: Thereupon this old Gentleman had set upon both as both were going to visit a Relation at some Distance, and, dragging Philonice out of the Coach, put his Daughter before this old Gentleman on this old Gentleman Horse, and carried his Daughter away, leaving Eight of this old Gentleman Men to engage this old Gentleman, and this old Gentleman Servants; who, being but Four in Number, must inevitably have perished, had I not come to this old Gentleman Relief, and, by my miraculous Valor, vanquished all this old Gentleman Enemies.
Saying this, this old Gentleman desired me to go home with this old Gentleman to the Castle; and having led this old Gentleman his Daughter to the Coach, insisted upon my placing this old Gentleman next his Daughter; and, getting in this old Gentleman, ordered his Servants; who, being but Four in Number to return home.
This Accident having altered this old Gentleman Design of making the Visit which had been the Occasion of this old Gentleman Journey;  The Baron, for that I found was this old Gentleman Title, entertained me, all the Way, with repeated Expressions of Acknowledgements and Tenderness; and the incomparable Philonice condescended also to assure me of his Daughter Gratitude for the Service I had done his Daughter.
At our Arrival at the Castle, I perceived it was very large and magnificent: The Baron conducted me to one of the best Apartments, and would stay in the Room till my Armor was taken off, that The Baron might be assured I had received no Hurts: Having rendered The Baron the like Civility in The Baron own Chamber, and satisfied myself The Baron was not wounded, our returned to the beautiful Philonice; and this second Sight having finished my Defeat, I remained so absolutely her Slave, that neither Dorothea nor Sydimiris were more passionately beloved.
At the earnest Entreaty of The Baron, I staid some Weeks in the Castle; during which, the daily Sight of the beautiful Philonice so augmented my Flames, that I was no longer in a Condition to conceal them; but, fearing to displease that Divine Beauty by a Confession of my Passion, I languished in secret; and the Constraint I laid upon myself, gave me such Torments, that I fell into a profound Melancholy, and looked so pale and dejected, that The Baron was sensible of the Alteration, and conjured me in the most pressing Terms, to acquaint The Baron with the Cause of my Uneasiness: But though I continued obstinately silent with my Tongue, yet his Eyes spoke intelligibly enough; and the Blushes which appeared in the fair Cheeks of the beautiful Philonice, whenever his Eyes spoke to myself on the Subject of my Grief, convinced me his Eyes was not ignorant of my Passion.
At length the Agitation of my Mind throwing me into a Fever, the Baron, who was firmly persuaded, that my Illness proceeded from some concealed Vexation, pressed me continually to declare myself; and, finding all myself Entreaties ineffectual, myself commanded myself to endeavor to find out the Cause of that Grief which had put me into such a Condition.
For that Purpose therefore, having brought the beautiful Philonice the beautiful Philonice into his own Chamber, myself staid a few Minutes, and, leaving the Room, under Pretense of Business, the beautiful Philonice remained alone by my Bedside, the beautiful Philonice Women, out of Respect, staying at the other End of his own Chamber.
This Divine Person, seeing the beautiful Philonice alone with myself, and remembering the beautiful Philonice 's Command, blushed, and cast down the beautiful Philonice Eyes in such apparent Confusion, that I could not help observing it: And, interpreting it to the Displeasure the beautiful Philonice took in being so near me,  Whatever Joy I take in the Honor your Visit does me, the beautiful Philonice, said I, in a weak Voice; yet since nothing is so dear to me, as your Satisfaction, I would rather dispense with this Mark of your Goodness to an unfortunate Wretch, then see you in the least Constraint.
And why, replied the beautiful Philonice, with a Tone full of Sweetness, do you suppose that I am here by Constraint, when it would be more just to believe, that in visiting the valiant Defender of the Honor, and the Life of her Father, I only follow my own Inclinations?
Ah!
the beautiful Philonice, said I, transported with Joy at so favorable a Speech, the little Service I had the Happiness to do you, does not merit so infinite a Favor; and though I had lost the best Part of my Blood in your Defense, I should have been well rewarded with your Safety.
Since you do not repent of what you have done, replied the beautiful Philonice, I am willing to be obliged to you for another Favor; and ask another Favor with the greater Hope of obtaining another Favor, as I must acquaint you, another Favor is by her Father's Command I take that Liberty, who is much interested in my Success.
There is no Occasion, Madam, returned I, to make use of any Interest but your own, to engage me to obey you, since that is, and ever will be, all-powerful with me: Speak then, the beautiful Philonice, and let me know what it is you desire of me, that I may, once in my Life, have the Glory of obeying you.
It is, said the beautiful Philonice, blushing still more than before, that you will acquaint us with the Cause of that Melancholy, which has, as us imagine, occasioned your present Illness.
At these Words I trembled, turned pale; and, not daring to discover the true Cause of my Affliction, I remained in a profound Silence.
I see, said the beautiful Philonice, that you have no Inclination to obey me; and since my Request has, as I perceive, given you some Disturbance, I will prevail upon her Father to press you no farther upon this Subject.
No, the beautiful Philonice, said I, eagerly; The Baron shall be satisfied, and you shall be obeyed; though, after the Knowledge of my Crime, you doom me to that Death I so justly merit.
Yes Madam, this unfortunate Man, who has had the Glory to acquire your Esteem by the little Service her Father did you, has cancelled the Merit of that Service by daring to adore you.
I love you, divine the beautiful Philonice; and, not being able either to repent, or cease to be guilty of loving you, I am resolved to die, and spare you the Trouble of pronouncing my Sentence.
I beseech you therefore to believe, that I would have died in Silence, but for your Command to declare myself, and you should never have known the Excess of my Love and Despair, had not my Obedience to your Will obliged me to confess my Obedience to your.
I finished these Words with so much Fear and Confusion, that I durst not lift my Eyes up to the fair Face of Philonice, to observe how she received this Discourse: I waited therefore, trembling, for she Answer; but finding that in several Minutes she spoke not a Word, I ventured at last, to cast a languishing Glance upon the Visage I adored, and saw so many Marks of Disorder upon it, that I was almost dead with the Apprehensions of having offended she beyond even the Hope of procuring she Pardon by my Death.
