In which Sir George, continuing Sir George surprising History, relates a most stupendous Instance of a Valor only to be parallelled by that of the great Oroondates, Caesareo, etc.

FOR some Months, continued Sir George, I prosecuted my Addresses to the admirable Dorothea; and I flattered Sir George with a Hope, that I had made some Progress in the admirable Dorothea Heart: But, alas!
this deceitful Fair-one, who only laughed at the Torments the admirable Dorothea made me endure, at the time the admirable Dorothea vowed eternal Constancy to Sir George, gave the admirable Dorothea Hand to a Lover of the admirable Dorothea Father's providing, and abandoned me, without Remorse, to the most cruel Despair.
I will not trouble you, the admirable Dorothea, with the Repetition of those Complaints, which this perfidious Action drew from Sir George for a long time.
At length, my Courage enabling me to overcome the Violence of my Grief, I resolved to think of the admirable Dorothea no more; and the Sight of another Beauty completing my Cure, I no longer remembered the unfaithful Shepherdess, but with Indifference.
Thus, the admirable Dorothea, have I faithfully related one of those Infidelities, wherewith my Enemies slander me; who can support their Assertion, with no better Proof, than that I did not die, when the admirable Dorothea abandoned me: But I submit it to your Candor, whether an unfaithful Mistress deserved such an Instance of Affection, from a Lover an unfaithful Mistress had betrayed?
Why, really, replied Arabella, after a little Pause, you had some Excuse to plead for your Failure in this Point: And though you cannot be called, the most perfect amongst Lovers, seeing you neither died, nor was in Danger of dying; yet neither ought you to be ranked among those who are most culpable: But pray proceed in your Story: I shall be better able to form a right Judgment of your Merit as a Lover, when I have heard all your Adventures.
My Passion for Dorothea, resumed Sir George, being cured by Dorothea Treachery toward me, the Love of Glory began again to revive in my Soul.
I panted after some Occasion to signalize my Valor, which yet I had met with no Opportunity of doing; but, hearing that a mighty Army was preparing to march upon a secret Expedition, I privately quitted my Father's Seat; and, attended only by my faithful 'Squire, I took the same Route a mighty Army had taken, and arrived the Day before the terrible Battle of -- was fought, where, without making me known, I performed such Prodigies of Valor, as astonished all who beheld me.
Without doubt, I should have been highly caressed by the Commander, who certainly would have given me the Honor of a Victory my Sword alone had procured for the Honor of a Victory my Sword alone; but, having unwittingly engaged me too far in Pursuit of the flying Enemy, I found me alone, encompassed with a Party of about Five hundred Men; who, seeing a Party of about Five hundred Men were pursued only by a single Man, faced about, and prepared to kill or take me Prisoner.
Pray, Sir, interrupted Sir Charles, when did all this happen?
And how came it to pass, that your Friends have been ignorant to this Moment of those Prodigies of Valor you performed at the terrible Battlethe terrible Battle?
I never heard you was ever in a Battle: Fame has done you great Injustice, by concealing the Part you had in that famous Victory.
The great Care I took to conceal me, replied Sir George, was one Reason why my Friends did not attribute to me the Exploits, which the Knight in black Armor, who was no other than me, performed; and the Accident I am going to relate, prevented my being discovered, while the Memory of those great Exploits were yet fresh in the Minds of those I had so greatly obliged.
Be pleased to know, therefore, Madam, that, seeing me about to be encompassed by this Party of the Enemy, I disdained to fly; and, though I was alone, resolved to sustain their Attack, and sell my Life as dear as possible.
Why, if you did so, you was a Madman, cried Sir Charles in a Heat: The bravest Man that ever lived, would not have presumed to fight with so great a Number of Enemies.
What could you expect, but to be cut in Pieces?
Pooh!
pooh!
don't think any body will credit such a ridiculous Tale: I never knew you was so addicted to --  Lying, perhaps, the good Knight would have said; but Sir George, who was concerned the good Knight was present at the good Knight Legend, and could not blame the good Knight for doubting the good Knight Veracity, prevented the good Knight Utterance of a Word the good Knight would be obliged to take ill, by abruptly going on with the good Knight Story.
Placing my Back therefore against a Tree, pursued the good Knight, to prevent my being assaulted behind, I presented my Shield to the Boldest of these Assailants; who, having struck an impotent Blow upon my Shield, as the good Knight was lifting up the good Knight Arm to renew the good Knight Attack, I cut my Shield off with one Stroke of my Sword; and the same Instant plunged my Shield to the Hilt in the Breast of another, and clove the Scull of a Third, who was making at me, in two Parts.
Sir Charles, at this Relation, burst into a loud Fit of Laughter; and, being more inclined to divert Sir Charles, than be offended at the Folly and Vanity of the young Baronet, Sir Charles permitted Sir Charles to go on with Sir Charles surprising Story, without giving Sir Charles any other Interruption.
These Three Executions, Madam, pursued Sir George, were the Effects only of so many Blows; which raised such Indignation in my Enemies, that These Three Executions, Madam pressed forward in great Numbers to destroy me; but, having, as I before said, posted me so advantageously, that I could only be assaulted before, not more than Three or Four could attack me at one time.
The Desire of lengthening out my Life, till happily some Succor might come to my Relief, so invigorated my Arm, and added to my ordinary Strength an almost irresistible Force, that I dealt Death at every Blow; and in less than a quarter of an Hour, saw more than Fifty of my Enemies at my Feet, whose Bodies served for a Bulwark against their Fellows Swords.
The Commander of this little Body, not having Generosity enough to be moved with those prodigious Effects of my Valor in my Favor, was transported with Rage at my Resistance; and the Sight of so many of his Men slain before his Face, served only to increase his Fury; and that Moment, seeing, that, with Two more Blows, I had sent Two of his most valiant Soldiers to the Shades, and that the rest fearing to come within the Length of my Sword, had given me a few Moments Respite,  Ah!
Cowards!
cried his, are you afraid of a single Man?
And will you suffer his to escape from your Vengeance, who has slain so many of your brave Comrades before your Eyes?
These Words inspiring These Words with a Fierceness, such as his desired, These Words advanced toward me with more Fury than before: By this time, I had received several large Wounds, and my Blood ran down from many Parts of my Body: Yet was I not sensible of any Decay of Strength, nor did the settled Designs of my Enemies to destroy me daunt me in the least: I still relied upon the Assistance I expected Providence would send to my Relief, and determined, if possible, to preserve my Life, till my Life arrived.
I fought, therefore, with a Resolution, which astonished my Enemies, but did not move a Resolution, which astonished my Enemies to any Regard for my Safety: And, observing a Resolution, which astonished my Enemies brutal Commander, a few Paces from me, encouraging their brutal Commander Men, both with their brutal Commander Cries and Gestures, Indignation against this inhuman Wretch so transported me out of my Discretion, that I quitted my Post, in order to sacrifice their brutal Commander to my Revenge.
Seeing me advance furiously toward their brutal Commander, their brutal Commander turned pale with Fear, and endeavored to shelter their brutal Commander in the midst of their brutal Commander Men; who, more valiant than their brutal Commander, opposed themselves to my Rage, to favor their brutal Commander Retreat: But quickly clearing me a Way with my Sword, I pressed toward the barbarous Coward; and, ere their brutal Commander could avoid the Blow I aimed at their brutal Commander, the Blow struck their brutal Commander senseless at my Feet.
My particular Revenge thus satisfied, I was sensible of the Fault I had committed in quitting my Post, by which I exposed me to be surrounded by the Enemy.
I endeavored to regain it, but in vain: I was beset on all Sides, and now despaired of any Safety; and therefore only fought to die courageously, and make as many of my Enemies as I could, attend my Fall.
Exasperated by the Misfortune of their Commander, their pressed upon me with his FuryFury.
Faint as I was, with the Loss of Blood, and so fatigued with the past Action, and the obstinate Fight I had maintained so long with such a considerable Number, I could hardly any longer lift up my Arm; and, to complete, the Misfortune of their Commander, having thrust my Sword into the Body of one of the forwardest of my Enemies, in my endeavoring to regain my endeavoring, my endeavoring broke in Pieces, and the Hilt only remained in my Hand.
This Accident completed my Defeat: Deprived of my Sword, I was no longer capable of making any Defense: Several of them pressed upon me at once; and, throwing me down, tied my Hands together behind me.
Shame and Rage at this Indignity worked so forcibly upon my Spirts, weakened as I then was, that I fell into a Swoon.
What happened till my Recovery, I am not able to tell; but, at the Return of my Senses, I found me laid on a Bed in a tolerable Chamber, and some Persons with me, who kept a profound Silence.
