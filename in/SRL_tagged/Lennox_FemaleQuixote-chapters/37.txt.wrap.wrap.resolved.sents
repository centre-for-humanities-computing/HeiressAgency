In which our Heroine is engaged in a new Adventure.
AS Mr. Glanville took a great deal of Pains to turn the Discourse upon Subjects, on which the charming Arabella could expatiate, without any Mixture of that Absurdity, which mingled itself in a great many others; the rest of that Day and several others, were passed very agreeably: At the End of which, Mr. Glanville being perfectly recovered, and able to go abroad; the Baronet proposed to take the Diversion of Hunting; which Arabella, who was used to itself, consented to partake of; but being informed, that Miss Glanville could not ride, and chose to stay at home, the Baronet would have kept the Baronet Company, had not Sir Charles insisted upon the contrary.
As Sir George, and some other Gentlemen, had invited some other Gentlemen to be of the Party; Arabella, on the Baronet coming down to mount the Baronet Horse, found a great many young Gallants, ready to offer the Baronet some other Gentlemen Assistance upon this Occasion: Accepting therefore, with great Politeness, this Help from a Stranger, who was nearest the Baronet, the Baronet mounted her Horse, giving Occasion to every one that was present, to admire the Grace with which the Baronet sat and managed Occasion.
the Baronet Shape being as perfect as any Shape could possibly be, the Baronet Riding-habit discovered all Her Shape Beauties: the Baronet Hat, and the white Feather waving over Part of the Baronet fine black Hair, gave a peculiar Charm to the Baronet lovely Face: And the Baronet appeared with so many Advantages in this Dress and Posture, that Mr. Glanville, forgetting all the Baronet Absurdities, was wholly lost in the Contemplation of so many Charms, as the Baronet whole Person was adorned with.
Sir George, though Sir George really admired Arabella, was not so passionately in Love as Mr. Glanville; and, being a keen Sportsman, eagerly pursued the Game, with the rest of the Hunters; but Mr. Glanville minded nothing but Mr. Glanville Cousin, and kept close by the Baronet.
After having rode a long time, Arabella, conceiving it a Piece of Cruelty, not to give the Baronet Lover an Opportunity of talking to the Baronet, as, by Mr. Glanville extreme Solicitude, Mr. Glanville seemed ardently to desire, coming to a delightful Valley, the Baronet stopped; and told Mr. Glanville, that, being weary of the Chase, the Baronet should alight, and repose the Baronet a little under the Shade of those Trees.
Mr. Glanville, extremely pleased at this Proposition, dismounted; and, having helped the Baronet to alight, seated Mr. Glanville by the Baronet on the Grass.
Arabella, expecting Mr. Glanville would begin to talk to the Baronet of Mr. Glanville Passion, could not help blushing at the Thoughts of having given Mr. Glanville such an Opportunity; and Mr. Glanville, endeavoring to accommodate Mr. Glanville to the Baronet Ideas of a Lover, expressed Mr. Glanville in Terms extravagant enough to have made a reasonable Woman think Mr. Glanville was making a Jest of the Baronet: All which, however, Arabella was extremely pleased with; and Arabella observed such a just Decorum in Arabella Answers, that, as the Writers of Romance phrase it, if Arabella did not give Mr. Glanville any absolute Hopes of being beloved, yet Arabella said enough to make Mr. Glanville conclude Arabella did not hate Mr. Glanville.
They had conversed in this manner near a Quarter of an Hour, when Arabella, perceiving a Man at a little Distance, walking very composedly, shrieked out aloud; and, rising with the utmost Precipitation, flew from Mr. Glanville, and went to untie her Horse; while Mr. Glanville Astonishment being so great at Arabella Behavior, that Mr. Glanville could not, for a Moment or two, ask Arabella the Cause of Arabella Fear --  Do you not see, said Arabella, out of Breath with the Violence of Arabella Apprehensions, the Person who is coming toward They?
It is the same, who, some Months ago, attempted to carry me away, when I was riding out with only Two Attendants: I escaped, for that time, the Danger that threatened me; but, questionless, questionless comes now to renew questionless Attempts: Therefore can you wonder at my Fear?
If it should be as you say, Madam, interrupted Mr. Glanville, What Reason have you to fear?
Do you not think I am able to defend you?
Ah!
without Doubt, you are able to defend me, answered Arabella; and though, if you offer to resist the Violence Doubt comes to use against Arabella, Doubt will, happily, call Two or Three Dozen armed Men to Doubt Assistance, who are, I suppose, concealed hereabouts, yet I am not apprehensive, that you will be worsted by his Assistance, who are: But as it happened to the brave Juba, and Cleomedon, while they were fighting with some hundred Men, who wanted to carry away the Two Princesses before they Faces; and were giving Death at every Blow, in order to preserve the Two Princesses; the Commander of these Ravishers, seeing the Two Princesses sitting, as I was, under a Tree, ordered the Two Princesses to be seized by Two of his Men, and carried away, while the Two Princes were losing best Part of of the Two Princes Blood in the Two Princes Defense; therefore, to prevent such an Accident happening, while you are fighting for my Rescue, I think it will be the safest Way for me to get on Horseback, that I may be in a Condition to escape; and that you may not employ your Valor to no Purpose.
Saying this, having, with Mr. Glanville's Assistance, loosed Arabella Horse from a Tree, his helped Arabella to mount, and then remounted his own.
Your Antagonist, said Arabella, is on Foot; and therefore, though I prize your Life extremely, yet I cannot dispense with his from telling you, that it is against the Laws of Knighthood to take any Advantage of that kind over your Enemy; nor will I permit your Concern for my Safety to make you forget what you owe to your own Reputation.
Mr. Glanville, fretting excessively at Arabella Folly, begged Arabella not to make Arabella uneasy about things that were never likely to happen.
The Gentleman yonder, added The Gentleman yonder, seems to have no Designs to make any Attempt against Arabella: If The Gentleman yonder should, I shall know how to deal with The Gentleman yonder: But, since The Gentleman yonder neither offers to assault me, nor affront you, I think we ought not to give The Gentleman yonder any Reason to imagine we suspect The Gentleman yonder, by gazing on The Gentleman yonder thus; and letting The Gentleman yonder understand by your Manner, that The Gentleman yonder is the Subject of we Conversation: If you please, Madam, we will endeavor to join we Company.
Arabella, while Arabella was speaking, kept Arabella Eyes fixed upon Arabella Face, with Looks which expressed Arabella Thoughts were laboring upon some very important Point: And, after a Pause of some Moments, Is it possible, said Arabella, with a Tone of extreme Surprise, that I should be so mistaken in Arabella?
Do you really want Courage enough to defend me against that Ravisher?
Oh Heavens!
Madam, interrupted Glanville, try not my Temper thus: Courage enough to defend you!
'Sdeath!
you will make me mad!
Who, in the Name of Wonder, is going to molest you?
He whom you see there, replied Arabella, pointing to He with her Finger: For know, cold and insensible as thou art to the Danger which threatens me, yonder Knight is thy Rival, and a Rival, happily, who deserves my Esteem better than thou do; since, if He has Courage enough to get me by Violence into He Power, that same Courage would make He defend me against any Injuries I might be offered from another: And since nothing is so contemptible in the Eyes of a Woman, as a Lover who wants Spirit to die in her Defense; know, I can sooner pardon him, whom thou would cowardly fly from, for the Violence which him meditates against me, than thyself for the Pusillanimity thou have betrayed in my Sight.
With these Words, thyself galloped away from thyself astonished Lover; who, not daring to follow thyself, for fear of increasing thyself Suspicions of his Cowardice, flung his off his in a violent Rage; and, forgetting that the Stranger was observing, and now within Hearing, his fell accusing and exclaiming against the Books, that had turned his 's Brain; and railing at his own ill Fate, that condemned his to the Punishment of loving thyself.
Mr. Harvey, concluded his had been treated like his by Arabella, whom his knew again at a Distance: Therefore coming up to Mr. Glanville, laughing --  Though I have not the Honor of knowing you, Sir, said Mr. Glanville, I must beg the Favor you will inform me, if you are not disturbed at the ridiculous Folly of the Lady I saw with you just now?
the Lady is the most fantastical Creature that ever lived, and, in my Opinion, fit for a Mad-house: Pray, are you acquainted with the Lady?
Mr. Glanville, being in a very ill Humor, could not brook the Freedom of this Language against Mr. Glanville Cousin, whose Follies Mr. Glanville could not bear any one should rail at but Mr. Glanville; and, being provoked at Mr. Glanville Sneers, and the Interruption Mr. Glanville had given to their Conversation, Mr. Glanville looked upon Mr. Glanville with a disdainful Frown, and told Mr. Glanville in an haughty Tone, That Mr. Glanville was very impertinent to speak of a Lady of the Lady Quality and Merit so rudely.
Oh!
Sir, I beg your Pardon, replied Mr. Harvey, laughing more than before; What, I suppose, you are the Champion of the Ladythe Lady!
But, I assure Mr. Glanville, if you intend to quarrel with every one that will laugh at the Lady, you will have more Business upon your Hands than you can well manage.
Mr. Glanville, transported with Rage at this Insolence, hit Mr. Glanville such a Blow with the But-End of Mr. Glanville Whip, that it stunned Mr. Glanville for a Moment; but recovering Mr. Glanville, Mr. Glanville drew Mr. Glanville Sword, and, mad with the Affront Mr. Glanville had received, made a Push at Mr. Glanville; who, avoiding it with great Dexterity, had recourse to Mr. Glanville Hanger for Mr. Glanville Defense.
Arabella, in the mean time, who had not rid far, concealing Arabella behind some Trees, saw all the Actions of Arabella Lover, and intended Ravisher; and, being possessed with an Opinion of Arabella 's Cowardice, was extremely rejoiced to see his Cousin fall upon his Cousin Enemy first, and that with so much Fury, that Arabella had no longer any Reason to doubt his Cousin Courage: Arabella Suspicions, therefore, being removed, Arabella Tenderness for his Cousin returned; and when Arabella saw them engaged with them Swords (for, at that Distance, Arabella did not plainly perceive the Difference of them Weapons), Arabella Apprehensions for Arabella his Cousin were so strong, that, though Arabella did not doubt his Cousin Valor, Arabella could not bear to see his Cousin expose his Cousin Life for Arabella: And, without making any Reflections upon the Singularity of Arabella Design, Arabella was going to ride up to them, and endeavor to part them; when Arabella saw several Men come toward them, whom Arabella took to be the Assistants of Arabella Ravisher, though several Men were, in reality, Haymakers; who, at a Distance, having seen the Beginning of several Men Quarrel, had hastened to part several Men.
Terrified, therefore, at this Reinforcement, which Arabella thought would expose Arabella to great Danger, Arabella galloped, with all Speed, after the Hunters, being directed by the Sound of the Horn.
Arabella Anxiety for Arabella his Cousin made his Cousin regardless of his Cousin own Danger, so that his Cousin rode with a surprising Swiftness; and, overtaking the Company, his Cousin would have spoken, to tell she rode with a surprising Swiftness; and, overtaking the Company of his Cousin's Situation; when his Cousin Spirits failing his Cousin, his Cousin could only make a Sign with his Cousin Hand, and sunk down in a Swoon, in the Arms of Sir George, who eagerly galloped up to his Cousin; and, supporting his Cousin as well as he was able till some others came to his Cousin Relief, some others took his Cousin off her Horse, and placed his Cousin upon the Ground; when, by the Help of some Water some others brought from a Spring near some others, in a little time his Cousin came to his Cousin.
Sir Charles, who, seeing his Cousin come up to some others without his Son, and by his Cousin fainting, concluded some Misfortune had happened to his Son, the Moment his Cousin opened her Eyes, asked his Cousin eagerly, Where his Son was?
his Son, said Arabella, sighing, is, with a Valor equal to that of the brave Cleomedon, this Moment fighting in his Defense against a Crowd of Enemies; and is, happily, shedding the last Drop of his Son Blood in my Quarrel.
Shedding the last Drop of his Bloodhis Blood, happily!
interrupted Sir Charles, excessively grieved; and, not a little enraged at Arabella, supposing his Cousin had introduced Sir Charles into some my Quarrel, It may be happy for you, Madam; but I am sure it will make me very miserable, if his Son comes to any Harm.
If it be the Will of Heaven Sir Charles should fall in this Combat, resumed Arabella, Sir Charles can never have a more glorious Destiny: And as that Consideration will, doubtless, sweeten Sir Charles last Moments, so it ought to be your Consolation: However, I beg you will lose no time, but haste to Sir Charles Assistance; for since Sir Charles has a considerable Number of Enemies to deal with, it is not improbable but Sir Charles may be overpowered at last.
Where did you leave my Son, Madam?
cried Sir Charles, eagerly.
Sir Charles is not far off, replied Arabella: And you will, doubtless, be directed to the Place, by the Sight of the Blood of Sir Charles Enemies, which Sir Charles has spilt.
Go that way, pursued Arabella, pointing with Arabella Finger toward the Place where Arabella had left Arabella his Cousin: There you will meet with Sir Charles, amidst a Crowd of Foes, which Sir Charles is sacrisicing to my Safety, and Sir Charles just Resentment.
Sir Charles, not knowing what to think, galloped away, followed by most Part of the Company; Sir George telling Lady Bella, that Sir George would stay to defend Lady Bella against any Attempts that might be made on Lady Bella Liberty, by any of Lady Bella 's Servants, who were, probably, straggling about.
Arabella, however, being perfectly recovered, insisted upon following Arabella Uncle.
There is no Question, said Arabella, but Mr. Glanville is victorious: I am only apprehensive for the dangerous Wounds Mr. Glanville may have received in the Combat, which will require all our Care and Assistance.
Sir George, who wanted to engross Arabella Company a little to Mr. Glanville, in vain represented to Arabella, that, amidst the Horrors of a Fight so bloody as that must certainly be, in which Mr. Glanville and Mr. Glanville Friends would be now engaged, it would be dangerous for Arabella to venture Arabella Person: Yet Arabella would not be persuaded; but, having mounted her Horse, with his Assistance, Arabella rode as fast as Arabella was able after the rest of the Company.
