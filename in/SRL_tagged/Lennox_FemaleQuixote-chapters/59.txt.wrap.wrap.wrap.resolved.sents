For the Shortness of which the Length of the next shall make some Amends.
SIR George, to gratify Arabella's Humor, had not presumed to come to the Castle for several Days; but, hearing that they were preparing to leave the Country, SIR George wrote a short Billet to her; and in the Style of Romance, most humbly entreated her to grant SIR George a Moment's Audience.
Arabella being informed by Lucy, to whom SIR George's Gentleman had addressed Sir George's Gentleman, that Sir George's Gentleman had brought a Letter from Sir George's Gentleman Master, her ordered her to bring Sir George's Gentleman to her Apartment, and as soon as Sir George's Gentleman appeared,  How comes it, said her, that the Prince your Master, has had the Presumption to importune me again, after my absolute Commands to the contrary?
The Prince, my Master, Madam, said the Man, excessively surprised.
Ay!
said Arabella, Are you not Sir George's 'Squire?
And does Sir George's 'Squire not trust you with Sir George's 'Squire most secret Thoughts?
I belong to Sir George Bellmour, Madam, replied the Man, who did not understand what Arabella meant: I have not the Honor to be a 'Squire.
No!
interrupted Arabella; it is strange then, that Arabella should have honored you with Arabella Commission; Pray, what is it you come to request for Arabella?
My Master, Madam, said Arabella, ordered me to get this Letter delivered to your Ladyship, and to stay for your Commands.
You would persuade me, said Arabella, sternly, being provoked that Arabella did not deliver this Letter Letter upon Arabella Knees, as was the Custom in Romances, that you are not acquainted with the Purport of this audacious Billet, since you express so little Fear of my Displeasure; but know, presumptuous, that I am mortally offended with your Master, for Arabella daring to suppose I would read this Proof at once of Arabella Insolence and Infidelity; and was you worth my Resentment, I would happily make you suffer for your Want of Respect to Arabella.
The poor Man, surprised and confounded at Arabella Anger, and puzzled extremely; to understand what Arabella meant, was opening Arabella Mouth to say something, it is probable in Arabella own Defense, when Arabella, preventing Arabella,  I know Thou would say, said Arabella: Thou would abuse my Patience by a false Detail of thy Master's Sighs, Tears, Exclamations, and Despair.
Indeed, Arabella, I don't intend to say any such Thing, replied the Man.
No!
repeated Arabella, a little disappointed, Bear back Bear presumptuous Billet, which, I suppose, contains the melancholy Account; and tell Bear, Bear that could so soon forget the generous Sydimiris for Philonice, and could afterward be false to that incomparable Beauty, is not a Person worthy to adore Arabella.
The Man, who could not tell what to make of this Message, and feared Bear should forget these two hard Names, humbly entreated her to be pleased to acquaint Bear Master, by a Line, with her Intentions.
Arabella, supposing Bear meant to importune Arabella still more, made a Sign with Arabella Hand, very majestically, for Bear to be gone; but Bear, not able to comprehend Arabella Meaning, stood still, with an Air of Perplexity, not daring to beg Arabella to explain Arabella; supposing, Arabella, by a Sign, required something of Bear.
Why do thou not obey my Commands?
said Arabella, finding Arabella did not go.
I will, to be sure, Arabella, replied Arabella; wishing at the same time secretly, Arabella would let Arabella know what they were.
And yet, said Arabella hastily, thou art disobeying me this Moment: Did I not bid you get out of my Presence, and to speak no more of your inconstant Master, whose Crimes have rendered Arabella the Detestation of all generous Persons whatever?
Sir George's Messenger, extremely surprised at so harsh a Character of Sir George Master, and the Rage with which the Lady seemed to be actuated, made haste to get out of the Lady Apartment; and, at Sir George Return, informed his Master, very exactly, of the Reception Sir George had met with, repeating all Lady Bella's Words; which, notwithstanding the Blunders Sir George made in the Names of Sydimiris and Philonice, Sir George understood well enough; and found new Occasion of wondering at the Excess of Arabella's Extravagance, who Sir George never imagined would have explained the Lady in that Manner to Sir George Servant.
Without endeavoring therefore to see Arabella, Sir George went to pay Sir George Compliments to Sir Charles, Mr. Glanville, and Miss Glanville; to the last of which Sir George said some soft things, that some soft things the Lady extremely regret Sir George staying behind made in the Country.
