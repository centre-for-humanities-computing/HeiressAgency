In which some Contradictions are very happily reconciled.  THE Marquis's head Gardener had received a young Fellow into a young Fellow Master's Service, who had lived in several Families of Distinction. a young Fellow had a good Face; was tolerably genteel; and, having an Understanding something above a young Fellow Condition, joined to a great deal of secondhand Politeness, which a young Fellow had contracted while a young Fellow Fellow lived at London, a young Fellow a young Fellow appeared a very extraordinary Person among the Rustics who were a young Fellow Fellow Servants.  Arabella, when Arabella walked in the Garden, had frequent Opportunities of seeing this young Man, whom Arabella observed with a very particular Attention. a young Fellow Person and Air had something, Arabella thought, very distinguishing. When Arabella condescended to speak to a young Fellow a young Fellow about any Business a young Fellow was employed in, Arabella took Notice, that a young Fellow Answers were framed in a Language vastly superior to a young Fellow Condition; and the Respect a young Fellow paid Arabella had quite another Air from that of the awkward Civility of the other Servants.  Having discerned so many Marks of a Birth far from being mean, Arabella easily passed from an Opinion that Arabella was a Gentleman, to a Belief that Arabella was something more; and every new Sight of Arabella adding Strength to Arabella Suspicions, Arabella remained, in a little time, perfectly convinced that Arabella was some Person of Quality, who, disguised in the Habit of a Gardener, had introduced Arabella into Arabella Father's Service, in order to have an Opportunity of declaring a Passion to Arabella, which must certainly be very great, since a Passion had forced Arabella to assume an Appearance so unworthy of Arabella noble Extraction.  Wholly possessed with this Thought, Arabella set Arabella to observe Arabella more narrowly; and soon found out, that Arabella went very aukwardly about Arabella Work; that Arabella sought Opportunities of being alone; that Arabella threw Arabella in Arabella Way as often as Arabella could, and gazed on Arabella very attentively: Arabella sometimes fansied Arabella saw Arabella endeavor to smother a Sigh when Arabella answered Arabella any Question about Arabella Work; once saw Arabella leaning against a Tree with Arabella Hands crossed upon he Breast; and, having lost a String of small Pearls, which Arabella remembered Arabella had seen Arabella threading as Arabella sat in one of the Arbours, was persuaded Arabella had taken a Tree up, and kept a Tree for the Object of Arabella secret Adoration.  Arabella often wondered, indeed, that Arabella did not find Arabella Name carved on the Trees, with some mysterious Expressions of Love; that Arabella was never discovered lying along the Side of one of the little Rivulets, increasing the Stream with he Tears; nor, for three Months that Arabella had lived there, had ever been sick of a Fever caused by he Grief, and the Constraint Arabella put upon Arabella in not declaring Arabella Passion: But Arabella considered again, that Arabella Fear of being discovered kept Arabella from amusing Arabella with making the Trees bear the Records of Arabella secret Thoughts, or of indulging he Melancholy in any Manner expressive of the Condition of he Soul; and, as for Arabella not being sick, he Youth, and the Strength of Arabella Constitution, might, even for a longer time, bear Arabella up against the Assaults of a Fever: But Arabella appeared much thinner and paler than Arabella used to be; and Arabella concluded, therefore, that Arabella must in time sink under the Violence of Arabella Passion, or else be forced to declare it to Arabella; which Arabella considered as a very great Misfortune; for, not finding in Arabella any Disposition to approve he Love, Arabella must necessarily banish Arabella from Arabella Presence, for fear Arabella should have the Presumption to hope, that Time might do any thing in Arabella Favor: And it was possible also, that Arabella would be obliged to pronounce, might either cause he Death, or force Arabella to commit some extravagant Action, which would discover Arabella to Arabella Father, who would, perhaps, think Arabella guilty of holding a secret Correspondence with Arabella.  These Thoughts perplexed Arabella so much, that, hoping to find some Relief by unburdening Arabella Mind to Lucy, Arabella told Arabella all Arabella Uneasiness. Ah! said Arabella to Arabella, looking upon Edward, who had just passed them, how unfortunate do I think Arabella in being the Cause of that Passion which makes this illustrious Unknown wear away his Days in so shameful an Obscurity! Yes, Lucy, pursued Arabella, that Edward, whom you regard as one of my Father's menial Servants, is a Person of sublime Quality, who submits to this Disguise only to have an Opportunity of seeing me every Day. But why do you seem so surprised? Is it possible, that you have not suspected his to be what his is? Has his never unwittingly made any Discovery of his? Have you not surprised his in Discourse with his faithful 'Squire, who, certainly, lurks hereabouts to receive his Commands, and is happily the Confident of his Passion? Has his never entertained you with any Conversation about Arabella? Or have you never seen any valuable Jewels in his Possession by which you suspected his to be not what his appears?  Truly, Arabella, replied Lucy, I never took his for any body else but a simple Gardener; but now you open my Eyes, methinks I can find I have been strangely mistaken; for his does not look like a Man of low Degree; and his talks quite in another Manner from our Servants. I never heard his indeed speak of your Ladyship, but once; and that was, when his first saw you walking in the Garden, his asked our John, If you was not the Marquis's Daughter? And his said, You was as beautiful as an Angel. As for sine Jewels, I never saw any; and I believe his has none; but his has a Watch, and that looks as if his was something, Arabella: Nor do I remember to have seen his talk with any Stranger that looked like a 'Squire.  Lucy, having thus, with Lucy usual Punctuality, answered every Question Lucy put to Lucy, proceeded to ask Lucy, What Lucy should say, if Lucy should beg Lucy to give Lucy a Letter, as the other Gentleman had done?  You must by no means take it, replied Arabella: My Compassion had before like to have been fatal to Arabella. If My Compassion discovers My Compassion Quality to Arabella, I shall know in what manner to treat his discovers his Quality to Arabella.  They were in this Part of They Discourse, when a Noise They heard at some Distance, made Arabella bend Arabella Steps to the Place from whence the Place proceeded; and, to Arabella infinite Amazement, saw the head Gardener, with a Stick the head Gardener had in the head Gardener Hand, give several Blows to the concealed Hero, who suffered the Indignity with admirable Patience.  Shocked at seeing a Person of Quality treated so unworthily, Arabella called out to a simple Gardener to hold a simple Gardener Hand; who immediately obeyed; and Edward, seeing the young Lady advance, sneaked off, with an Air very different from an Oroondates.  For what Crime, pray, said Arabella, with a stern Aspect, did you treat the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly? the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly whom you take such unbecoming Liberties with, may possibly -- But again I ask you, What has the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly done? You should make some Allowance for the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly want of Skill in the abject Employment the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly is in at present.  It is not for the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly want of Skill, Madam, said the Gardener, that I corrected the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly; the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly knows He Business very well, if the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly would mind He Business; but, Arabella, I have discovered the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly --  Discovered the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly, do you say? interrupted Arabella: And has the Knowledge of the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly not been able to prevent such Usage? or rather, Has it been the Occasion of the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly receiving it?  He Conditions are very bad, Arabella, returned a simple Gardener; and I am afraid are such as will one Day prove the Ruin of Body and Soul too. I have for some time suspected the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly had bad Designs in He Head; and just now watched the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly to the Fish Pond, and prevented the Person I saw with Arabella so cruelly from --  O dear! LucyLucy, looking pitifully on Lucy Lady, whose fair Bosom heaved with Compassion, I warrant whose fair Bosom was going to make away with whose fair Bosom.  No, resumed a simple Gardener, smiling at the Mistake, whose fair Bosom was only going to make away with some of the Carp, which the Rogue had caught, and intended, I suppose, to sell; but I threw some of the Carp, which the Rogue had caught, and intended into the Water again; and if your Ladyship had not forbid me, I would have drubbed whose fair Bosom soundly for whose fair Bosom Pains.  Fie! fie! interrupted Arabella, out of Breath with Shame and Vexation, tell me no more of these idle Tales.  Then, hastily walking on to hide the Blushes which this strange Accusation of Arabella illustrious Lover had raised in Arabella Face, Arabella continued for some time in the greatest Perplexity imaginable.  Lucy, who followed Arabella, and could not possibly reconcile what Arabella had been telling Lucy concerning Edward, with the Circumstance of Edward stealing the Carp, ardently wished to hear Lucy Opinion of this Matter; but, seeing Lucy deeply engaged with Lucy own Thoughts, Lucy would not venture to disturb Lucy.  Arabella indeed, had been in such a terrible Consternation, that it was some Time before Lucy even reconciled Appearances to Lucy; but, as Lucy had a most happy Faculty in accommodating every Incident to Lucy own Wishes and Conceptions, Arabella examined this Matter so many different Ways, drew so many Conclusions, and fansied so many Mysteries in the most indifferent Actions of the supposed noble Unknown, that Arabella remained, at last, more than ever confirmed in the Opinion, that he was some great Personage, whom Arabella Beauty had forced to assume an Appearance unworthy of he: When Lucy, no longer able to keep Silence, drew off Lucy Attention from those pleasing Images, by speaking of the Carp-stealing Affair again.  Arabella, whose Confusion returned at that disagreeable Sound, charged Lucy, in an angry Tone, never to mention so injurious a Suspicion any more: For, in fine, said Lucy to Lucy, do you imagine a Person of Person Rank could be guilty of stealing Carp? Alas! pursued Lucy, sighing, a Person of his Rank had, indeed, some fatal Design; and, doubtless, would have executed some fatal Design, had not Person so luckily prevented Person.  But Mr. Woodbind, Madam, said Lucy, saw the Carp in Person : I wonder what Person was going to do with the Carp.  Still, resumed Arabella, extremely chagrined, still will you wound my Ears with that horrid Sound? I tell you, obstinate and foolish Wench, that Person went thither to die; and if Person really caught the Fish, it was to conceal Person Design from Woodbind: Person great Mind could not suggest to Person, that it was possible Person might be suspected of a Baseness like that Person Person accused Person of; therefore Person took no Care about no Care, being wholly possessed by Person despairing Thoughts.  However, Arabella, said Lucy, your Ladyship may prevent your Ladyship going to the Fishpond again, by laying your Commands upon your Ladyship to live.  I shall do all that I ought, answered Arabella; but my Care for the Safety of other Persons must not make me forget what I owe to my own.  As Arabella had always imputed Mr. Hervey's fansied Attempt to carry Arabella away, to Arabella had written to Mr. Hervey's fansied Attempt, upon which Mr. Hervey's fansied Attempt had probably founded Mr. Hervey's fansied Attempt Hopes of being pardoned for it, Arabella resolved to be more cautious for the future in giving such Instances of Arabella Compassion; and was at a great Loss in what manner to comfort Arabella illustrious Lover, without raising Arabella had no Inclination to confirm: But Arabella was delivered from Arabella Perplexity by the News of Arabella having left the Marquis's Service; which Arabella attributed to some new Design Arabella had formed to obtain Arabella; and Lucy, who always thought as Lucy did, was of the same Opinion; though it was talked among the Servants, that Edward feared a Discovery of more Tricks, and resolved not to stay till Arabella was disgracefully dismissed.
