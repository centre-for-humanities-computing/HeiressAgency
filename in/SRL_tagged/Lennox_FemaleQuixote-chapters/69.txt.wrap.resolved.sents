In which our Heroine justifies our Heroine own Notions by some very illustrious Examples.
MR. Selvin and Mr. Tinsel, who had listened attentively to this Discourse of Arabella, took Leave as soon as it was ended, and went away with very different Opinions of Leave.
Mr. Tinsel declaring Leave was a Fool, and had no Knowledge of the World, and Mr. Selvin convinced Leave was a Wit, and very learned in Antiquity.
Certainly, said Mr. Selvin, in Support of Mr. Selvin Opinion, the Lady has great Judgment; has been capable of prodigious Application, as is apparent by the Lady extensive Reading: Then the Lady Memory is quite miraculous.
I protest, I am quite charmed with the Lady: I never met with such a Woman in my Life.
the Lady Cousin, in my Opinion, replied Mr. Tinsel, is infinitely beyond Her Cousin in every Merit, but Beauty.
How sprightly and free the Lady Conversation?
What a thorough Knowledge of the World?
So true a Taste for polite Amusements, and a Fund of Spirits that sets Vapors and Spleen at Defiance.
This Speech bringing on a Comparison between the Ladies, the Champions for each grew so warm in the Dispute, that they had like to have quarreled.
However, by the Interposition of some other Gentlemen who were with they, they parted tolerable Friends that Night, and renewed they Visits to Sir Charles in the Morning.
they found only Miss Glanville with Arabella Father and Brother.
Arabella generally spent the Mornings in Arabella own Chamber, where Reading and the Labors of the Toilet employed Arabella Time till Dinner: Though it must be confessed to Arabella Honor, that the latter engrossed but a very small Part of it.
Miss Glanville, with whom the Beau had a long Conversation at one of the Windows; in which he recounted he Dispute with Mr. Selvin, and the Danger he ran of being pink'd in a Duel, that was he Phrase, for Arabella Sake, at last proposed a Walk; to which Arabella consented, and engaged to prevail upon Arabella to accompany them.
Arabella Arabella at first positively refused; alleging in Excuse, That Arabella was so extremely interested in the Fate of the Princess Melisintha, whose Story Arabella was reading, that Arabella could not stir till Arabella had finished it.
Arabella, continued Arabella, is at present in a most terrible Situation.
Arabella has just set Fire to the Palace, in order to avoid the Embraces of a King who forced Arabella to marry a King who forced her to marry him.
I am in Pain to know how Arabella escapes the Flames.
Pshaw, interrupted Miss Glanville, let Arabella perish there, if Arabella will: Don't let Arabella hinder our Walk.
Who is it you doom with so much Cruelty to perish, said Arabella, closing the Book, and looking steadfastly on Arabella Cousin?
Is it the beautiful Melisintha, that Princess, whose Fortitude and Patience have justly rendered Arabella the Admiration of the whole World?
That Princess, descended from a Race of Heroes, whose heroic Virtues all glowed in Arabella own beauteous Breast; that Princess, who, when taken Captive with the King Arabella Father, bore Arabella Imprisonment and Chains with a mavelous Constancy; and who, when Arabella enslaved Arabella Conqueror, and given Fetters to the Prince who held Arabella Father and Arabella in Bonds, nobly refused the Diadem he proffered Arabella, and devoted Arabella to Destruction, in order to punish the Enemy of Arabella House.
I am not able to relate the rest of Arabella History, seeing I have read no further Arabella; but if you will be pleased to sit down and listen to Arabella while I read what remains, I am persuaded you will find new Cause to love and admire Arabella.
Pardon me, Arabella, said Miss Glanville, I have heard enough; and I could have been very well satisfied not to have heard so much.
I think we waste a great deal of Time talking about People we know nothing of.
The Morning will be quite lost, if we don't make Haste.
Come, added she, you must go: You have a new Lover below, who waits to go with we; a new Lover will die if I don't bring you.
a new Lover!
returned Arabella, surpised.
Arabella, aye, said Miss Glanville, the learned Mr. Selvin; I assure you, a new Lover had almost quarreled with Mr. Tinsel last Night about your Ladyship.
Arabella, at this Intelligence, casting down Arabella Eyes, discovered many Signs of Anger and Confusion: And after a Silence of some Moments, during which, Miss Glanville Miss Glanville had been employed in adjusting Arabella Dress at the Glass, addressing Arabella to Arabella Cousin with an Accent somewhat less sweet than before.
Had any other than yourself, Miss, said Arabella, acquainted me with the Presumption of that unfortunate Person, I should happily have discovered my Resentment in other Terms: But, as it is, must inform you, that I take it extremely ill, you should be accessory to giving me this Offense.
Hey day!
said Miss Glanville, turning about hastily, How have I offended your Ladyship, pray?
I am willing to hope, her Cousin, replied Arabella, that it was only to divert yourself with the Trouble and Confusion in which you see me, that you have indiscreetly told Things which ought to have been buried in Silence.
And what is all this mighty Trouble and Confusion about then, Madam, said Miss Glanville, smiling?
Is it because I told you, Mr. Selvin was a Lover of your Ladyship?
Certainly, said Arabella, such an Information is sufficient to give one a great deal of Perplexity.
Is it such a little Matter, think you, to be told that a Man has the Presumption to love one?
A mere Trifle, replied Miss Glanville, laughing; a hundred Lovers are not worth a Moment's Thought, when one's sure of a hundred Lovers, for then the Trouble is all over.
And as for this unfortunate Person, as your Ladyship called this unfortunate Person, let this unfortunate Person die at this unfortunate Person Leisure, while we go to the Parade.
Your Levity, Cousin, said Arabella, forces me to smile, notwithstanding the Cause I have to be incensed; however, I have Charity enough to make me not desire the Death of Mr. Selvin, who may repair the Crime he has been guilty of by Repentance and Discontinuation.
Well then, said Miss Glanville, you are resolved to go to the Parade: Shall I reach you your odd Kind of Capuchin?
How, said Arabella, can I with any Propriety see a Man who has discovered a Man who has discovered himself to have a Passion for me to have a Passion for a Man who has discovered himself to have a Passion for me?
Will a Man who has discovered himself to have a Passion for me not construe such a Favor into a Permission for a Man who has discovered himself to have a Passion for me to hope?
Oh!
no, interrupted Miss Glanville, Miss Glanville does not imagine I have told your Ladyship Miss Glanville loves you; for indeed Miss Glanville don't know that I am acquainted with Miss Glanville Passion.
Then Miss Glanville is less culpable than I thought Miss Glanville, replied Arabella; and if you think I am in no Danger of hearing a Confession of Miss Glanville Fault from Miss Glanville own Mouth, I Will comply with your Request, and go with Arabella to the Parade.
But added Arabella, I must first engage you to promise not to leave me alone a Moment, lest Miss Glanville should take Advantage of such an Opportunity, to give some Hint of his Passion, that would force me to treat Miss Glanville very rigorously.
Miss Glanville answered laughing, That Arabella would be sure to mind Arabella Directions.
However, said Arabella, your Ladyship need not be apprehensive your Ladyship will say any fine Things to Arabella; for I knew a young Lady your Ladyship was formerly in Love with, and the odious Creature visited Arabella a Twelvemonth before your Ladyship found Courage enough to tell Arabella Arabella was handsome.
Doubtless, replied Arabella, your Ladyship was much to be commended for your Ladyship Respect.
A Lover should never have the Presumption to declare A Lover to A Lover Mistress, unless in certain Circumstances, which may at the same Time in part disarm A Lover Anger.
For Instance, A Lover must struggle with the Violence of A Lover , till it has cast A Lover into a Fever.
A Lover Physicians must give A Lover over, pronouncing A Lover Distemper incurable, since the Cause of his Distemper being in A Lover Mind, all His Physicians Art is incapable of removing all their Art.
Thus A Lover must suffer, rejoicing at the Approach of Death, which will free A Lover from all A Lover Torments, without violating the Respect A Lover owes to the Divine Object of A Lover Flame.
At length, when A Lover has but a few Hours to live, his Mistress, with many Signs of Compassion, conjures A Lover to tell Mistress the Cause of A Lover Despair.
The Lover, conscious of A Lover Crime, evades all Mistress Inquiries; but the Lady laying at last a peremptory Command upon A Lover to disclose the Secret, A Lover dares not disobey Mistress, and acknowledges A Lover with the utmost Contrition for having offended Mistress; bidding Mistress take the small Remainder of A Lover Life to expiate his Crime; and finishes A Lover Discourse by falling into a Swoon.
Arabella is touched at Arabella Condition, commands Arabella to live, and if necessary, permits Arabella to hope.
This is the most common Way in which such Declarations are, and ought to be brought about.
However, there are others, which are as well calculated for sparing a Lady's Confusion, and deprecating a Lady Wrath.
A Lover, for Example, like the Prince of the Massage^es, after having buried A Lover Passion in Silence for many Years, may chance to be walking with A Lover Confidant in a retired Place; to whom, with a Deluge of Tears, A Lover relates the Excess of A Lover .
And while A Lover is thus unbosoming A Lover Griefs, not in the least suspecting A Lover is overheard, A Lover Princess, who had been listening to A Lover in much Trouble and Confusion, by some little Rustling she makes, unawares discovers she.
A Lover throws A Lover at A Lover Feet, begs Pardon for A Lover Rashness, observes that A Lover had never presumed to discover A Lover to A Lover; and implores A Lover Leave to die before A Lover, as a Punishment for A Lover undesign'd Offense.
The Method which the great Artamenes took to let the Princess of Media know Artamenes adored A Lover, was not less respectful.
This valiant Prince, who had long loved A Lover, being to fight a great Battle, in which Artamenes had some secret Presages Artamenes should fall, which however deceived Artamenes, wrote a long Letter to the divine Mandana, wherein Artamenes discovered Artamenes , and the Resolution Artamenes Respect had inspired Artamenes with, to consume in Silence, and never presume to disclose Artamenes Love while Artamenes lived; acquainting A Lover, that Artamenes had ordered that a long Letter not to be delivered to A Lover, till it was certainly known that Artamenes was dead.
Accordingly Artamenes received several Wounds in the Fight, which brought Artamenes to the Ground, and Artamenes Body not being found, they concluded his Body was in the Enemy's Possession.
Artamenes faithful 'Squire, who had received Artamenes Instructions before the Battle, hastens to the Princess, who, with all the Court, is mightily affected at Artamenes Death.
Artamenes presents A Lover the Letter, which A Lover makes no Scruple to receive, since the Writer is no more.
A Lover reads the Writer is no more, and A Lover whole Soul is melted with Compassion; A Lover bewails Artamenes Fate with the most tender and affectionate Marks of Grief.
his Confidant asks why A Lover is so much affected, since in all Probability, A Lover would not have pardoned his Confidant for loving A Lover, had his Confidant been alive?
A Lover acknowledges the Truth of A Lover Observation, takes Notice that his Death having cancelled his Confidant , his Confidant employs A Lover Thoughts; A Lover is resolved to bewail as innocent and worthy of Compassion when dead, whom living A Lover would treat as a Criminal, and insinuates, that A Lover Heart had entertained an Affection for his Confidant.
A Lover Confidant treasures up this Hint, and endeavors to console A Lover, but in vain, till News is brought, that Artamenes, who had been carried for dead out of the Field, and by a very surprising Adventure concealed all this Time, is returned.
the Princess of Media is covered with Confusion, and though glad the Princess of Media is alive, resolves to banish the Princess of Media for the Princess of Media .
the Princess of Media pleads his Confidant Cause so well, that the Princess of Media consents to see his Confidant; and, since his Confidant can no longer conceal his Confidant , his Confidant confirms the Confession in a long Letter, humbly begging Pardon for being still alive.
The Princess, who cannot plead Ignorance of his Confidant Passion, nor deny the Sorrow the Princess of Media testified for his Death, condescends to pardon his Confidant, and his Confidant is also permitted to hope.
In like Manner the great Prince of Persia --  Does your Ladyship consider how late it is, interrupted Miss Glanville, who had hitherto very impatiently listened to the Princess of Media?
Don't let us keep the Gentlemen waiting any longer for us.
I must inform you how the Prince of Persia declared the Prince of Persia Love for the incomparable Berenice, said Arabella.
Another Time, dear Cousin, said Miss Glanville; methinks us have talked long enough upon this Subject.
I am sorry the Time has seemed so tedious to you, said Arabella, smiling; and therefore I Will trespass no longer upon your Patience.
Then ordering Lucy to bring Lucy Hat and Gloves, Lucy went down Stairs, followed by Miss Glanville, who was greatly disappointed at Lucy not putting on Lucy Veil.
