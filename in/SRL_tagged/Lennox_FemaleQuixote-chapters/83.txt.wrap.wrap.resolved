In which if the Reader has not anticipated it, the Reader will find an Explanation of some seeming Inconsistencies in the foregoing Chapter.  THE Countess, charmed with the Wit and good Sense of Arabella, could not conceal Arabella Admiration, but expressed it in Terms the most obligingly imaginable: And Arabella, who was excessively delighted with Arabella, returned the Compliments Arabella made Arabella with the most respectful Tenderness.  In the midst of these mutual Civilities, Arabella in the Style of Romance, entreated the Countess to favor Arabella with the Recital of Arabella Adventures.  At the Mention of this Request, that Arabella conveyed so much Confusion into Arabella Countenance, that Arabella extremely embarrass'd by it, though Arabella knew not why, thought it necessary to apologize for the Disturbance Arabella seemed to have occasioned in Arabella.  Pardon me, Arabella, replied the Countess recovering Arabella, if the uncommoness of your Request made a Moment's Reflection necessary to (...) that a young Lady of your Sense and Delicacy could mean no Offense to Decorum by making it. her Adventures carries in her Adventures so free and licentious a Sound in the Apprehensions of People at this Period of Time, that her Adventures can hardly with Propriety be applied to those few and natural Incidents which compose the History of a Woman of Honor. And when I tell you, pursued a Woman of Honor with a Smile, that I was born and christened, had a useful and proper Education, received the Addresses of my Lord -- through the Recommendation of my Parents, and married my Lord with my Parents Consents and my own Inclination; and that since we have lived in great Harmony together, I have told you all the material Passages of my Life, which upon Enquiry you will find differ very little from those of other Women of the same Rank, who have a moderate Share of Sense, Prudence and Virtue.  Since you have already, Madam, replied Arabella blushing, excused me for the Liberty I took with you, it will be un-necessary to tell you it was grounded upon the Customs of ancient Times, when Ladies of the highest Rank and sublimest Virtue, were often exposed to a Variety of cruel Adventures which they imparted in Confidence to each other, when Chance brought they together.  Custom, said the Countess smiling, changes the very Nature of Things, and what was honorable a thousand Years ago, may probably be looked upon as infamous now -- A Lady in the heroic Age you speak of, would not be thought to possess any great Share of Merit, if the Countess had not been many times carried away by one or other of the Countess insolent Lovers: Whereas a Beauty in this could not pass through the Hands of several different Ravishers, without bringing an Imputation on the Countess Chastity.  The same Actions which made a Man a Hero in those Times, would constitute a Man a Hero a Murderer in These -- And the same Steps which led a Man a Hero to a Throne Then, would infallibly conduct a Man a Hero to a Scaffold Now.  But Custom, Madam, said Arabella, cannot possibly change the Nature of Virtue or Vice: And since Virtue is the chief Characteristick of a Hero, a Hero in the last Age will be a Hero in this -- Though the Natures of Virtue or Vice cannot be changed, replied the Countess, yet the Natures of Virtue or Vice cannot be changed may be mistaken; and different Principles, Customs, and Education, may probably change the Natures of Virtue or Vice cannot be changed Names, if not the Natures of Virtue or Vice cannot be changed Natures.  Sure, Madam, said Arabella a little moved, you do not intend by this Inference to prove Oroondates, Artaxerxes, Juba, Artaban, and the other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men?  Judging the other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men by the Rules of Christianity, and our present Notions of Honor, Justice, and Humanity, the other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men certainly are, replied the Countess.  Did the other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men not possess all the necessary Qualifications of Heroes, Madam, said Arabella, and each in a superlative Degree? -- Was not the other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men Valor invincible, the other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men Generosity unbounded, and the other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men Fidelity inviolable?  It cannot be denied, said the Countess, but that the other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men Valor was invincible; and many thousand Men less courageous than the other Heroes of Antiquity, bad Men, felt the fatal Effects of that invincible Valor, which was perpetually seeking after Occasions to exert It. Oroondates gave many extraordinary Proofs of that unbounded Generosity so natural to the Heroes of Oroondates Time. Oroondates being sent by the King Oroondates Father, at the Head of an Army, to oppose the Persian Monarch, who had unjustly invaded Oroondates Dominions, and was destroying the Lives and Properties of Oroondates Subjects; having taken the Wives and Daughters of Oroondates Enemy Prisoners, had by these Means an Opportunity to put a Period to a War so destructive to Oroondates Country: Yet out of a Generosity truly heroic, Oroondates released the Wives and Daughters of his Enemy Prisoners immediately without any Conditions; and falling in Love with one of those Princesses, secietly quitted Oroondates Father's Court, resided several Years in that of the Enemy of Oroondates Father and Country, engaged Oroondates to Oroondates Daughter, and when the War broke out again between the two Kings, fought furiously against an Army in which the King Oroondates Father was in Person, and shed the Blood of Oroondates future Subjects without Remorse; though each of his future Subjects, we are told, would have sacrificed Oroondates Life to save that of the Wives and Daughters of his Enemy Prisoners Prince, so much was Oroondates beloved* Such are the Actions which immortalize the Heroes of Romance, and are by the Authors of those Books styled glorious, godlike, and divine. Yet judging of the Authors of those Books as Christians, we shall find the Authors of those Books impious and base, and directly opposite to our present Notions of moral and relative Duties.  It Is certain therefore, Madam, added the Contess with a Smile, that what was Virtue in those Days, is Vice in ours: And to form a Hero according to our Notions of 'em at present, it is nessary to give him Qualities very different from Oroondates.  The secret Charm in the Countenance, Voice, and Manner of the Countess, joined to the Force of the Countess reasoning, could not fail of making some Impression on the Mind of Arabella; but it was such an Impression as came far short of Conviction. the Countess was surpised embarrass'd, perplexed, but not convinced. Heroism, romantic Heroism, was deeply rooted in the Countess Heart; it was the Countess Habit of thinking, a Principle imbibed from Education. the Countess could not separate the Countess Ideas of Glory, Virtue, Courage, Generosity, and Honor, from the false Representations of Generosity, and Honor in the Actions of Oroondates, Juba, Artaxerxes, and the rest of the imaginary Heroes. The Countess's Discourse had raised a Kind of Tumult in the Countess Thoughts, which gave an Air of Perplexity to the Countess lovely Face, and made that the Countess apprehensive the Countess had gone too far, and lost that Ground in the Countess Esteem, which the Countess had endeavored to acquire by a Conformity to some of the Countess Notions and Language. In this however, the Countess was mistaken; Arabella felt a Tenderness for the Countess that had already the Force of a long contracted Friendship, and an Esteem little less than Veneration.  When the Countess the Countess took Leave, the Professions of Arabella, though delivered in the Language of Romance, were very sincere and affecting, and were returned with an equal Degree of Tenderness by the Countess, who had conceived a more than ordinary Affection for the Countess.  Mr. Glanville who could have almost worshipped the Countess for the generous Design be saw the Countess had entertained, took an Opportunity as Mr. Glanville who could have almost worshipped the Countess for the generous Design handed the Countess to the Countess Chair, to entreat in a Manner as earnestly as polite, that the Countess would continue the Happiness of the Countess Acquaintance to Mr. Glanville who could have almost worshipped the Countess for the generous Design Cousin; which with a Smile of mingled Dignity and Sweetness the Countess assured Mr. Glanville who could have almost worshipped the Countess for the generous Design of.
