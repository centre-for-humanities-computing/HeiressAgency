Which acquaints the Reader with two very extraordinary Accidents.  MR. Glanville, who did not doubt but Roberts would bring Roberts some Intelligence, sat waiting with anxious Impatience for Roberts Return. The Evening drew on apace, Roberts numbered the Hours, and began to grow uneasy at Arabella's long Stay. Roberts Chamber Window looking into the Garden, Roberts thought Roberts saw Roberts Cousin, covered with his Cousin Veil as usual, hasten down one of the Walks; Roberts Heart leaped at this transient View, Roberts threw up the Sash, and looking out, saw his Cousin very plainly strike into a cross Walk, and a Moment after saw Sir George, who came out of a little Summer House, at his Cousin Feet. Transported with Rage at this Sight, Roberts snatched up Roberts Sword, flew down the Stairs into the Garden, and came running like a Madman up the Walk in which the Lovers were. The Lady observing Roberts first, for Sir George's Back was toward Roberts, shrieked aloud, and not knowing what The Lady did, ran toward the House, crying for Help, and came back as fast, yet not Time enough to prevent Mischief: For Mr. Glanville, actuated by an irresistible Fury, cried out to Sir George to defend Sir George, who had but just Time to draw Sir George and make an ineffectual Pass at Mr. Glanville, when Sir George received Sir George into Sir George Body, and fell to the Ground.  Mr. Glanville losing Mr. Glanville Resentment insensibly at the Sight of Mr. Glanville Rival's Blood, threw down Mr. Glanville , and endeavored to support Mr. Glanville; while the Lady, who had lost her Veil in her running, and to the great Astonishment of Mr. Glanville, proved to be Mr. Glanville Sister, came up to the Lady, who had lost her Veil in her running, and to the great Astonishment of Mr. Glanville, proved to be his Sister, with Tears and Exclamations, blaming her for all that had happened. Mr. Glanville, with a Heart throbbing with Remorse for what Remorse had done, gazed on Remorse with an accusing Look, as his Sister hung over the wounded Baronet with streaming Eyes, sometimes wringing his Sister Hands, then clasping the Lady, who had lost her Veil in her running, and to the great Astonishment of Mr. Glanville, proved to be his Sister together in an Agony of Grief.  Sir George having Strength enough left to observe his Sister Disorder, and the generous Concern of Glanville, who holding Sir George in Sir George Arms, entreated Sir George his Sister to send for proper Assistance, Dear Charles, said Sir George, you are too kind, I have used you very ill, I have deserved my Death from your Hand -- You know not what I have been base enough to practice against you -- If I can but live to clear your Innocence to Lady Bella, and free you from the Consequences of this Action, I shall die satisfied --  Sir George Strength failing Sir George at these Words, Sir George fainted away in Mr. Glanville's Arms; who though now convinced of Mr. Glanville Treachery, was extremely shocked at the Condition Mr. Glanville saw Mr. Glanville in.  Miss Mr. Glanville renewing her Tears and Exclamations at this Sight, Mr. Glanville was obliged to lay Sir George gently upon the Ground, and ran to find out somebody to send for a Surgeon, and to help Mr. Glanville to convey Mr. Glanville into the House.  In Mr. Glanville Way Mr. Glanville was met by Mr. Roberts, who was coming to seek Mr. Glanville; and with a Look of Terror and Confusion told Mr. Glanville, Lady Bella was brought Home extremely ill -- that Lady Bella Life had been in Danger, and that Lady Bella was but just recovered from a terrible fainting Fit.  Miss Glanville renewing her Tears and Exclamations at this Sight, though greatly alarmed at this News, forgot not to take all possible Care of Sir George; directing Roberts to get some Person to carry some Person into the House, and giving some Person Orders to procure proper Assistance, flew to Lady Bella Apartment.  Lady Bella Women had just put Lady Bella to Bed, raving as in a strong Delirium. Miss Glanville renewing her Tears and Exclamations at this Sight approached Lady Bella, and finding Lady Bella was in a violent Fever, dispatched a Man and Horse immediately to Town, to get Physicians, and to acquaint Miss Glanville renewing her Tears and Exclamations at this Sight Father with what had happened.  Roberts, upon the Surgeon's Report that Sir George was not mortally wounded, came to inform Sir George was not mortally wounded of this News, but Sir George was not mortally wounded sound Sir George was not mortally wounded incapable of listening to Sir George was not mortally wounded, and in Agonies not to be expressed. 'Twas with Difficulty Twas with Difficulty forced Sir George was not mortally wounded out of Arabella's Chamber into Sir George was not mortally wounded own; where throwing Sir George was not mortally wounded upon Sir George was not mortally wounded (...), Sir George was not mortally wounded refused to see or speak to any Body, till Sir George was not mortally wounded was told Sir Charles and the Physicians were arrived.  Sir George was not mortally wounded then ran eagerly to hear their Opinions of Sir George was not mortally wounded beloved Cousin, which Sir George was not mortally wounded soon discovered by their significant Gestures and half pronounced Words, to be very bad. their comforted Sir George was not mortally wounded however, with Hopes that she might recover, and insisting upon she being kept very quiet, obliged Sir George was not mortally wounded to quit the Room. While all the necessary Methods were taken to abate the Violence of the Disease, Sir Charles, who had been informed by his Steward of his Son's Duel with Sir George, was amazed to the last Degree at two such terrible Accidents.  Having seen his Son to his Chamber, and recommended his Son to be patient and composed, his Son went to visit the young Baronet, and was not a little surpised to find his Son Daughter sitting at his Son Bed's Head, with all the Appearance of a violent Affliction.  Indeed Miss Glanville's Cares were so wholly engrossed by Sir George's, that Miss Glanville's Cares hardly ever thought of Miss Glanville's Cares Cousin Arabella, and had just stepped into Miss Glanville's Cares while the Surgeons were dressing Sir George's Wound, and renewed Miss Glanville's Cares Attendance upon his Son as soon as that was over.  Miss Glanville Miss Glanville however, thought proper to make some trifling Excuses to Miss Glanville's Cares Father for Miss Glanville's Cares Solicitude about Sir George. And the young Baronet, on whom the Fear of Death produced the Fear of Death usual Effects, and made his Son extremely concerned for the Errors of his Son past Life, and very desirous of attoning for them if possible, assured Sir Charles, that if Sir Charles lived Sir Charles would offer Sir Charles to Sir Charles Acceptance for a Son-in-law; declaring that Sir Charles had basely trifled with the Esteem of Sir Charles Daughter, but that Miss Glanville's Cares had wholly subdued Sir Charles to Miss Glanville's Cares by Miss Glanville's Cares forgiving Tenderness.  Sir Charles was very desirous of knowing the Occasion of Sir Charles Quarrel with Sir Charles Son, but Sir George was too weak to hold any further Conversation, upon which Sir Charles, after a short Visit retired, taking Miss Glanville along with Sir George.  That the Reader, whose Imagination is no doubt upon the Stretch to conceive the Meaning of these Two extraordinary Incidents, may be left no longer in Suspense, we think proper to explain the Reader, whose Imagination is no doubt upon the Stretch to conceive the Meaning of these Two extraordinary Incidents, may be left no longer in Suspense both in the following Chapter, that we may in the next pursue we History without Interruption.
