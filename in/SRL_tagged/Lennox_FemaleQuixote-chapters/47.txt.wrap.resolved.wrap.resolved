In which will be found one of the former Mistakes pursued, and another cleared up, to the great Satisfaction of Two Persons; among whom, the Reader, we expect, will make a Third.  ARABELLA no sooner saw Sir Charles advancing toward ARABELLA, when, sensible of the Consequence of being alone with a Person whom ARABELLA did not doubt, would make use of that Advantage, to talk to ARABELLA of Love, ARABELLA endeavored to avoid Sir Charles, but in vain; for Sir Charles, guessing ARABELLA Intentions, walked hastily up to ARABELLA; and, taking hold of ARABELLA Hand,  You must not go away, Lady Bella, said Sir Charles: I have something to say to Sir Charles.  ARABELLA, extremely discomposed at this Behavior, struggled to free ARABELLA Hand from ARABELLA Uncle; and, giving Sir Charles a Look, on which Disdain and Fear were visibly painted,  Unhand me, Sir, said ARABELLA, and force me not to forget the Respect I owe you, as ARABELLA Uncle, by treating you with a Severity such uncommon Insolence demands.  Sir Charles, letting go her Hand in a great Surprise, at the Word Insolent, which ARABELLA had used, asked ARABELLA, If ARABELLA knew to whom ARABELLA was speaking?  Questionless, I am speaking to Questionless , replied ARABELLA; and it is with great Regret I see ARABELLA obliged to make use of Expressions no way conformable to the Respect I bear that sacred Character.  And, pray, Madam, said Sir Charles, somewhat softened by this Speech, who is it that obliges you to lay aside that Respect you seem to acknowledge is due to ARABELLA UncleARABELLA Uncle?  You do, ARABELLA, replied ARABELLA; and it is with infinite Sorrow, that I beheld you assuming a Character unbecoming the Brother of my Father.  This is pretty plain, indeed, interrupted Sir Charles: But pray, Madam, inform me, what it is you complain of.  You, questionless, know much better than I can tell you, replied ARABELLA, blushing, the Offense I accuse you of; nor is it proper for me to mention, what it would not become me to suffer.  Zounds! cried Sir Charles, no longer able to suppress Zounds growing Anger, this is enough to make a Man mad.  Ah! I beseech you, ARABELLA, resumed ARABELLA, suffer not an unfortunate and ill-judged Passion to be the Bane of all your Happiness and Virtue: Recall your wandering Thoughts; reflect upon the Dishonor you will bring upon yourself, by persisting in such unjustifiable Sentiments.  I do not know how it is possible to avoid it, said Sir Charles; and, notwithstanding all this fine Reasoning, there are few People but would fly into greater Extremities; but my Affection for you makes me. --  Hold, hold, I conjure you, ARABELLA, interrupted ARABELLA; force me not to listen to such injurious Language; carry that odious Affection somewhere else; and do not persecute an unfortunate Maid, who has contributed nothing to thy Fault, and is only guilty of too much Compassion for thy Weakness.  Good God, cried Sir Charles, starting back, and looking upon ARABELLA with Astonishment; how I pity my Son! What would I not give, if Sir Charles did not love this Girl?  Think not, replied ARABELLA, that the Passion your Son has for me, makes your Condition a bit the worse; for I would be such as I am, with respect to you, were there no Mr. Glanville in the World.  I never thought, Niece, said Sir Charles, after a little Pause, that any Part of my Behavior, could give you the Offense you complain of, or authorize that Hatred and Contempt you take the Liberty to express for me: But since it is so, I promise you, I will quit your House, and leave you to your self; I have always been solicitous for your Welfare; and, ungrateful as you are --  Call me not ungrateful, interrupted ARABELLA again: Heaven is my Witness, that had you not forgot I was your Niece, I would have always remembered you was my Uncle; and not only have regarded you as such, but have looked upon ARABELLA as another Father, under whose Direction Providence had placed me, since it had deprived me of my real Father; and whose Tenderness and Care, might have in some measure supplied the Loss I had of my Uncle: But Heaven has decreed it otherwise; and since it is Heaven Will, that I should be deprived of the Comfort and Assistance my Orphan State requires, I must submit, without murmuring, to my Destiny. Go then, unfortunate and lamented my Uncle, pursued my Destiny, wiping some Tears from my Destiny fine Eyes; go, and endeavor by Reason and Absence to recover thy Repose; and be assured, whenever you can convince me you have triumphed over these Sentiments which now cause both our Unhappiness, you shall have no Cause to complain of my Conduct toward you.  Finishing these Words, my Destiny left my Uncle with so much Speed, that it would have been impossible for my Uncle to have stopped my Destiny, though my Uncle had intended it: But indeed, my Uncle was so lost in Wonder and Confusion at a Behavior for which my Uncle was not able to assign any other Cause than Madness, that my Uncle remained fixed in the same Posture of Surprise, in which my Destiny had left my Uncle; and from which my Uncle was first interrupted by the Voice of my Uncle Son, who, seeing Arabella flying toward the House in great seeming Emotion, came to know the Result of their Conversation.  Sir, said Mr. Glanville, who had spoken to Sir Father before, but had no Answer, will you not inform me, what Success you have had with my Cousin? How did my Cousin my Cousin receive your Proposal.  Speak of my Cousin no more, said Sir Charles, my Cousin my Cousin is a proud ungrateful Girl, and unworthy the Affection you have for my Cousin.  Mr. Glanville, who trembled to hear so unfavourable an Answer to Sir Charles Inquiries, was struck dumb with Sir Charles Surprise and Grief; when Sir Charles taking Notice of the Alteration in Sir Charles Countenance;  I am sorry, said Sir Charles, to find you have set your Heart upon my Cousin: If ever my Cousin my Cousin be your Wife, which I very much doubt, my Cousin my Cousin will make you very unhappy: But, Sir Charles, pursued Sir Charles, I would advise you to think no more of my Cousin; content Sir Charles with the Estate you gain by my Cousin Refusal of Sir Charles: With that Addition to your own Fortune, you may pretend to any Lady whatever; and you will find many that are full as agreeable as your Cousin, who will be proud of your Addresses.  Indeed, Sir Charles, said Mr. Glanville, with a Sigh, there is no Woman upon Earth whom I would choose to marry, but Lady Bella: I flattered Lady Bella, I had been happy enough to have made some Progress in Lady Bella Affection; but it seems, I was mistaken; however, I should be glad to know, if Lady Bella gave you any Reasons for refusing me.  Reasons! said Sir Charles: There is no making Lady Bella hear Reason, or expecting Reason from Lady Bella; I never knew so strange a Woman in my Life: Lady Bella would not allow me to speak what I intended concerning you; but interrupted me, every Moment, with some high-flown Stuff or other.  Then I have not lost all Hopes of Lady Bella, cried Mr. Glanville eagerly; for since Lady Bella did not hear what you had to say, Lady Bella could not possibly deny you.  But Lady Bella behaved in a very impertinent Manner to Lady Bella, interrupted Sir Charles; complained of my harsh Treatment of Lady Bella; and said several other Things, which, because of Lady Bella uncommon Style, I could not perfectly understand; yet several other Things, which, because of Lady Bella uncommon Style, I could not perfectly understand seemed shocking; and, upon the Whole, treated me so rudely, that I am determined to leave Lady Bella to Lady Bella, and trouble my Head no more about Lady Bella.  For God's sake, Sir Charles, said Mr. Glanville, alarmed at this Resolution, suspend your Anger, till I have seen my Cousin: There is some Mistake, I am persuaded, in all this. I know Lady Bella has some very odd Humors, which you are not so well acquainted with, as I am. I Will go to Lady Bella, and prevail upon Lady Bella to explain Lady Bella.  You may do so, if you please, replied Sir Charles; but I fear it will be to very little Purpose; for I really suspect Lady Bella Head is a little turned: I do not know what to do with Lady Bella: It is not fit Lady Bella should have the Management of Lady Bella; and yet it is impossible to live upon easy Terms with Lady Bella.  Mr. Glanville, who did not doubt but ARABELLA had been guilty of some very ridiculous Folly, offered nothing more in Arabella Justification; but, having attended Sir Father to his own Chamber went to ARABELLA's Apartment.  his found the pensive Fair-one, in a melancholy Posture, Lady Bella Head reclined upon one of ARABELLA fair Hands; and though Arabella Eyes were fixed upon a Book Arabella held in the other, yet ARABELLA did not seem to read, but rather to be wholly buried in Contemplation.  Mr. Glanville having so happily found ARABELLA (for Arabella Women were not then in his own Chamber) seated Mr. Glanville near ARABELLA; having first asked Pardon for the Interruption Mr. Glanville had given to Arabella Studies; and ARABELLA, throwing aside BookBook, prepared to listen to Mr. Glanville Discourse; which by the Agitation, which appeared in Looks, ARABELLA imagined, would be upon some extraordinary Subject.  I left Mr. Glanville just now, said Mr. Glanville , in a great deal of Uneasiness, on account of something you said to Mr. Glanville Father, Lady Bella: Mr. Glanville apprehends you are disobliged, and Mr. Glanville would willingly know how.  Has Mr. Glanville then acquainted you with the Subject of our Conversation? interrupted ARABELLA.  I know what would have been the Subject of your Conversation, replied Mr. Glanville, if you had been pleased to listen to what Sir Charles intended to say to his Father, Lady Bella on my Behalf.  On my Behalf? interrupted ARABELLA: Ah poor deceived Mr. Glanville! how I pity thy blind Sincerity! But it is not for Sir Charles to undeceive thee: Only thus much I must say to his Father, Lady Bella, Beware of committing your Interests to a Person, who will be a much better Advocate for another than for his Father, Lady Bella.  Mr. Glanville, rejoiced to find by these Words, that her Resentment against Mr. Glanville was occasioned by a Suspicion so favorable for Mr. Glanville, assured her, that Sir Charles wished for nothing more earnestly, than that Mr. Glanville might be able to merit her Esteem; and that it was to dispose her to listen to Mr. Glanville Addresses, that Mr. Glanville wanted to discourse with her that Morning.  Mr. Glanville, being obliged, through Mr. Glanville Knowledge of Mr. Glanville 's Temper, to speak to her in this distant Manner, went on with Mr. Glanville Assurances of Mr. Glanville 's Candor in this Respect; and Arabella, who would not declare her Reasons for doubting it, only replied, That Sir Charles Sir Charles wished for nothing more earnestly, than that Mr. Glanville might be able to merit her Esteem; and that it was to dispose her to listen to Mr. Glanville Addresses, that Mr. Glanville wanted to discourse with her that Morning.  Mr. Glanville, impatient to let Sir Charles know, how greatly Sir Charles had been mistaken in Cause Behavior, made Sir Charles Visit shorter than Sir Charles would otherwise have done, in order to undeceive Sir Charles.  It is possible, said Sir Charles, when his Son had repeated Sir Charles had just had with ARABELLA, that ARABELLA could be so foolish, as to imagine, I had a Design to propose any one else to ARABELLA but you? What Reason have I ever given ARABELLA, to think I would not be glad to have ARABELLA for my Daughter-in-law? Indeed, ARABELLA has some odd Ways that are very disagreeable; but ARABELLA is one of the best Matches in England for all that: Arabella! pursued Sir Charles, ARABELLA had Reason to be angry, if that was the Case; and now I remember, ARABELLA cried, when I told ARABELLA I would leave the House; yet Arabella Spirit was so great, that ARABELLA told me, I might go. Well, I Will go and make it up with ARABELLA; but who could have imagined, ARABELLA would have been so foolish? Sir Charles, at the Repetition of these Words, hurried away to Arabella's Apartment.  Niece, said Sir Charles at Sir Charles Entrance, I am come to ask you Pardon, for having led you into a Belief, that I meant --  It Is enough, Sir, interrupted ARABELLA; I grant you Pardon for what is past; and as it does not become me to receive Submissions from my Uncle, while Sir Charles remembers Sir Charles is so, I will dispense with your Acknowlegements at present: Only to convince me, that this sudden Alteration is sincere, avoid, I beseech you, for the future, all Occasions of displeasing me.  I protest, cried Sir Charles, that I never intended --  I will not hear you say a Word more of your past Intentions, interrupted ARABELLA again: I have forgot them all; and, while you continue to regard me as your Niece, I will never remember them all to your Disadvantage.  Then I may hope, said Sir Charles --  Oh! Heavens! cried ARABELLA, not suffering ARABELLA to proceed; do you come to insult me thus, with a mock Repentance? And has my Easiness, in being so ready to forget the Injury you would have done me, made you presumptuous enough to cherish an insolent Hope that I will ever change my Resolution?  How vexatious is this! replied Sir Charles, fretting to see Sir Charles continually mistaking Sir Charles. I swear to Sir Charles, by all that is sacred, that it is my Son, for whom I would solicit your Consent.  How! said ARABELLA, astonished, Will you then be just at last? And can you resolve to plead for that Son, whose Interest, but a Moment ago, you would have destroyed?  I see, said Sir Charles, it is impossible to convince you.  No, no interrupted ARABELLA, hastily; it is not impossible but my own ardent Wishes that it may be so, will help to convince me of the Truth of what you say: For in fine, do you think, I shall not be as glad as Sir Charles, to find you capable of acting honorably by your Son; and to see your Son no longer the Cause of the most unjustifiable Conduct imaginable?  Sir Charles was opening Sir Charles Mouth, to press Sir Charles in Favor of Mr. Glanville; whom, notwithstanding Sir Charles strange Behavior, Sir Charles was glad to find, Sir Charles loved; when ARABELLA preventing Sir Charles,  Seek not, I beseech you, said Sir Charles, to destroy that Belief I am willing to give your Words, by any more Attempts at this time to persuade me; for truly, I shall interpret your Solicitude no way in your Favor; therefore, if you desire I should be convinced you are sincere, let the Silence I require of you, be one Proof of it.  Sir Charles, who looked excessively out of Countenance at such a peremptory Command from Command Niece, was going out of his own Chamber in a very ill Humor, when the Dinnerbell ringing, Sir Charles gave Command Sir Charles Hand, with a very gracions Air; and permitted Command to lead Sir Charles into the Dining Room, where Sir Charles, who looked excessively out of Countenance at such a peremptory Command from Sir Charles Niece found Mr. Glanville, Command Sister, and Sir George, who had been detained to Dinner by Miss Glanville, expecting Sir Charles, who looked excessively out of Countenance at such a peremptory Command from his Niece his Niece his Niece coming.
