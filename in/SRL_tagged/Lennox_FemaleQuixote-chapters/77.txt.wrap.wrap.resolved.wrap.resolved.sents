Contains the Conversation referred to in the last Chapter of the preceding Book.
MISS Glanville, who with a malicious Pleasure had secretly triumphed in the Extravagances her beautiful Cousin had been guilty of, was now sensibly disappointed to find MISS Glanville, who with a malicious Pleasure had secretly triumphed in the Extravagances had had so little Effect on her Father and Brother; for instead of reflecting upon the Absurdities to which MISS Glanville, who with a malicious Pleasure had secretly triumphed in the Extravagances had been a Witness, Mr. Glanville artfully pursued the Subject Arabella just before had been expatiating upon, taking notice frequently of some Observations of hers, and by a well contrived Repetition of hers Words, obliged Mr. Glanville Father a second Time to declare that Mr. Glanville Niece had spoken extremely well.
Mr. Glanville taking the Word, launched out into such Praises of Mr. Glanville Niece Wit, that Miss Glanville, no longer able to listen patiently, replied,  'Twas true Lady Bella sometimes said very sensible Things; that 'twas a great Pity Mr. Glanville Niece was not always in a reasonable Way of thinking, or that Mr. Glanville Father Niece Intervals were not longer --  Mr. Glanville Father Niece Intervals, Miss, said Mr. Glanville, pray what do you mean by that Expression?
--  Why, pray, said Mr. GlanvilleMr.
Mr. Glanville, don't you think my Cousin is sometimes a little wrong in the Head?
Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from my Cousin Chair, took a Turn across the Room in great Discomposure, then stopping all of a sudden, and giving my Cousin a furious Look -- Charlotte, said my Cousinmy Cousin, don't give me Cause to think you are envious of your Cousin's superior Excellencies --  Envious, repeated Miss Glanville, I envious of my Cousin -- I vow I should never have thought of that -- Indeed, Brother, you are much mistaken; my Cousin's superior Excellencies never gave me a Moment's Disturbance -- Though I must confess his my Cousin unaccountable Whims have often excited my Pity --  No more of this, Charlotte, interrupted Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from my Cousin Chair at these Words starting from my Cousin Chair, as you value my Friendship -- No more of No --  Why, really Son, said Sir Charles, my Cousin has very strange Whimsies sometimes.
How it came into my Niece Head to think Mr. Tinsel would attempt to carry my Cousin my Cousin away, I cannot imagine?
For after all, Mr. Tinsel only pressed rather too rudely into my Niece Chamber, for which, as you see, I have ferbidden Mr. Tinsel Visits.
That was of a Piece, said Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Tinsel my Cousin Chair sneeringly to my Cousin, with my Cousin my Cousin asking you if you had made Mr. Tinsel swear upon your Sword, that Mr. Tinsel would never again attempt to carry my Cousin my Cousin away; and applauding you for having given Mr. Tinsel Mr. Tinsel Liberty, as the generous Atermens did on the same Occasion.
I would advise you, Charlotte, said Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Tinsel , not to aim at repeating your Cousins's Words, till you know how to pronounce your Cousins's Words properly.
Oh!
that is one of her superior Excellencies, said Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville at these Words .
Indeed, Miss, said Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville at these Words very provokingly, Miss is superior to you in many Things; and as much so in the Goodness of Miss Heart, as in the Beauty of Miss Person --  Come, come, Charles, said the Baronet, who observed Charles Daughter sat swelling and biting the Baronet, who observed Charles Daughter Daughter Lip at this Reproach, personal Reflections are better avoided.
Miss is very well, and not to be disparaged; though to be sure, Lady Bella is the finest Woman I ever saw in my Life.
Mr. Glanville at these Words his was, if possible, more disgusted at Lady Bella Father's Palliation than Lady Bella Brother's Reproaches; and in order to give a Loose to Lady Bella Passion, accused Mr. Glanville of a Decrease in Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville Chair Affection for Lady Bella, since Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville my Cousin Chair had been in Love with Lady Bella Cousin; and having found this Excuse for Lady Bella Tears, very freely gave vent to vent --  Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair being softened by this Sight, sacrificed a few Compliments to Lady Bella Vanity, which soon restored Lady Bella to Lady Bella usual Tranquillity; then turning the Discourse on Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville beloved Arabella, pronounced a Panegyric on Lady Bella Virtues and Accomplishments of an Hour long; which, if it did not absolutely persuade Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville Chair Sister to change Mr. Glanville Sister Opinion, it certainly convinced Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville Chair Father, that Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville Chair Niece was not only perfectly well in Mr. Glanville Niece Understanding, but even better than most others of Mr. Glanville Niece Sex.
Mr. Glanville his Chair Father had just finished Mr. Glanville Niece Eulogium, when Mr. Glanville beloved Arabella appeared; Joy danced in Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville Chair Eyes at Mr. Glanville beloved Arabella Approach; Mr. Glanville his Chair Father gazed upon his beloved Arabella with a Kind of conscious Triumph in Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville Chair Looks; his beloved Arabella his beloved Arabella consummate Loveliness justifying Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville Chair Passion, and being in Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from Mr. Glanville Chair Opinion, more than an Excuse for all Mr. Glanville beloved Arabella Extravagancies.
