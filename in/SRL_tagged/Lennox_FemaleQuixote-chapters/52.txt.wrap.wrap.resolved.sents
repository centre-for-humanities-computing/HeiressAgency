The Adventure continued.
AH!
Madam, said I, perceiving Madam had finished Madam Discourse, doubt not but I shall most gratefully preserve the Remembrance of what the generous Sydimiris has done for me; and shall always be ready to lose that Life in Madam Defense, which Madam has had the superlative Goodness to take so much Care of.
But, Madam, pursued I, with an earnest Look, do not, I beseech you, refuse me one Favor, without which I shall depart with inconceivable Sorrow.
Depend upon it, valiant Sir, replied Madam, that if what you will require of me, be in my Power, and fit for me to grant, I shall very willingly oblige you.
It is then, resumed I, trembling at the Boldness of my Request, that you would condescend to entreat the most generous Sydimiris to favor me with an Interview, and give me an Opportunity of throwing me at Madam Feet, to thank Madam for all those Favors I have received from Madam Compassion.
I cannot promise you, replied Madam, rising, to prevail upon Sydimiris to grant you an Audience; but I assure you, that I will endeavor to dispose Madam to do you this Favor; and this Favor shall not be my Fault, if you are not satisfied.
Saying this, Madam went out of my Chamber, I having followed Madam to the Door, with Protestations that I would never forget Madam Kindness upon this Occasion.
I past the rest of that Day in an anxious Impatience for Night, divided between Fear and Hope, and more taken up with the Thoughts of seeing Sydimiris, than with my expected Liberty.
Night came at last, and the Door of my Apartment opening, I saw the Lady who had been with me in the Morning, enter.
I have prevailed upon Sydimiris to see you, said Madam; and Madam is willing, at my Entreaty, to grant that Favor to a Person, who, Madam with Reason thinks, has been inhumanly treated by Madam Brother.
Then, giving me Madam Hand, Madam conducted me along a large Gallery, to a stately Apartment; and after traversing several Rooms, Madam led me into one, where Sydimiris was: Who, as soon as Madam perceived me, rose from Madam Seat, and received me with great Civility.
In the Transport I then was, I know not how I returned the grateful Salute Sydimiris Sydimiris gave me; for most certain it is, that I was so lost in Wonder, at the Sight of the many Charms I beheld in Madam Person, that I could not unlock my Tongue, or remove my Eyes from Madam enchanting Face; but remained fixed in a Posture, which at once expressed my Admiration and Delight.
To give you a Description of that Beauty which I then contemplated, I must inform you, Madam, that Sydimiris is tall, of a handsome Stature, and admirably proportioned; Madam Hair was of the finest Black in the World; Madam Complexion marvelously fair; and all the Lineaments of Madam Visage were perfectly beautiful; and Madam Eyes, which were large and black, sparkled with so quick and piercing a Fire, that no Heart was able to resist their powerful Glances: Moreover, Sydimiris is admirably shaped; Madam Port is high and noble; and Madam Air so free, yet so commanding, that there are few Persons in the World, with whom Madam may not dispute the Priority of Beauty: In fine, Madam, Sydimiris appeared with so many Advantages, to a Spirit prepossessed already with the most grateful Sense of Madam Favors, that I could not resist the sweet Violence wherewith Madam Charms took Possession of my Heart: I yielded therefore, without Reluctance, to my Destiny, and resigned myself, in an Instant, to those Fetters, which the Sight of Sydimiris prepared for myself: Recovering therefore a little from that Admiration, which had so totally engrossed all my Faculties, I threw myself at Madam Feet, with an Action wholly composed of Transport.
Sydimiris, said I, beholding Madam with Eyes, in which the Letters of my newborn Passion might very plainly be read, see at your Feet a Man devoted to your Service, by all the Ties of Gratitude and Respect.
I come, Madam, to declare to you, that from the First Moment you gave me Liberty, I had devoted that and my Life to you; and at your Feet a Man devoted to your Service I confirm the Gift; protesting by all that is most dear and sacred to myself, that since I hold my Life from Sydimiris, Madam alone shall have the absolute Disposal of it for the future; and should Madam please again to demand it, either to appease Madam Brother's Fury, or to sacrifice it to Madam own Security, I will most faithfully perform Madam Will, and shed the last Drop of that Blood at Madam Command, which I would with Transport lose in Madam Defense.
A fine high-flown Speech indeed!
said Sir Charles, laughing; but I hope you did not intend to keep your Word.
Sure, Sir Charles, replied Arabella, you do not imagine, that Sir George would have failed in executing all Sir George had promised to the beautiful and generous Sydimiris: What could Sir George possibly have said less?
And indeed what less could Madam have expected from a Man, whom at the Hazard of Madam own Life and Happiness, Madam had given Freedom to?
I accompanied these Words, Madam, pursued Sir George, with so passionate a Look and Accent, that the fair Sydimiris blushed, and, for a Moment, cast down Madam Eyes with a visible Confusion.
At last,  Sir Charles, replied Madam, I am too well satisfied with what I have done, with respect to your Safety, to require any Proofs of your Gratitude, that might be dangerous to it; and shall remain extremely well satisfied, if the Obligations you think you owe me, may induce you to moderate your Resentment against my Brother, for the cruel Treatment you received from my Brother.
Doubt not, Madam, interrupted I, eagerly, but I shall, in the Person of Marcomire, regard the Brother of the divine Sydimiris; and that Consideration will be sufficient, not only to make me forget all the Violences the Brother of the divine Sydimiris committed against my Brother, but even to desend the Brother of the divine Sydimiris Life, if need be, with the Hazard of my own.
Excessively generous indeed!
said Sir Charles: I never heard any thing like it.
Oh!
dear, Sir Charles, replied Arabella, there are numberless Instances of equal, and even superior Generosity, to be met with in the L^ves of the Heroes of Antiquity: You will there see a Lover, whose Mistress has been taken from whose Mistress, either by Treachery or Force, venture whose Mistress Life in Defense of the injurious Husband who possesses her; and though all the injurious Husband who possesses her Felicity depends upon the injurious Husband who possesses her Death, yet the injurious Husband who possesses her will rescue the injurious Husband who possesses her from it, at the Expense of the greater Part of the injurious Husband who possesses her Blood.
Another, who after a long and bloody War, has, by taking the injurious Husband who possesses her Enemy Prisoner, an Opportunity of terminating it honorably; yet, through an heroic Principle of Generosity, the injurious Husband who possesses her gives the injurious Husband who possesses her Captive Liberty, without making any Conditions, and has all the injurious Husband who possesses her Work to do over again.
A Third, having contracted a violent Friendship with the Enemies of Friendship Country, through the same generous Sentiments, draws Friendship Sword in their Defense, and makes no Scruple to fight against an Army, where the King Friendship Father is in Person.
I must confess, said Sir Charles, that Generosity seems to me very peculiar, that will make a Man fight for his Enemies against his own Father.
It is in that Peculiarity, Sir, said Arabella, that Arabella Generosity consists; for certainly there is nothing extraordinary in fighting for one's Father, and one's Country; but when a Man has arrived to such a Pitch of Greatness of Soul, as to neglect those mean and selfish Considerations, and, loving Virtue in the Persons of a Man Enemies, can prefer to neglect those mean and selfish Considerations, and, loving Virtue in the Persons of his Enemies Glory before a Man own particular Interest, a Man is then a perfect Hero indeed: Such a one was Oroondates, Artaxcrxes, and many others I could name, who all gave eminent Proofs of to neglect those mean and selfish Considerations, and, loving Virtue in the Persons of his Enemies Disinterestedness and Greatness of Soul, upon the like Occasions: Therefore not, to detract from Sir George's Merit, I must still insist, that in the Resolutions Sir George's Merit had taken to defend Sir George's Merit Enemy's Life at the Expense of Sir George's Merit own, Sir George's Merit did no more, than what any Man of ordinary Generosity ought to do, and what Sir George's Merit was particularly obliged to, by what Sydimiris Sydimiris had done for Sir George's Merit.
I was so happy, however, Madam, continued Sir George, to find that those Expressions of my Gratitude wrought somewhat upon the Heart of Sydimiris in my Favor: Her Words discovered as much, and Her her Eyes spoke yet more intelligibly; but our Conversation was interrupted by the discreet Urinoe, who, fearing the Consequence of so long a Stay in Her Chamber, represented to me, that it was time to take my Leave.
I turned pale at this cruel Sound; and, beholding Sydimiris with a languishing Look,  Would to Heaven, Madam, said I, that instead of giving me Liberty, you would keep me eternally your Prisoner; for though a Dungeon was to be the Place of my Confinement, yet if it was near you, it would seem a Palace to me; for indeed I am no longer in a Condition to relish that Freedom you bestow upon me, since it must remove me farther from you: But I beseech you, Madam, to believe, that in delivering me from your Brother's Fetters, you have cast me into your own, and that I am more a Prisoner than ever, but a Prisoner to so lovely a Conqueror, that I do not wish to break my Chains, and prefer the sweet and glorious Captivity I am in, to all the Crowns in the World.
You are very bold, said Sydimiris, blushing, to entertain me with such Discourse; yet I pardon this Offense, in Consideration of what you have suffered from my Brother, and on Condition that you will depart immediately, without speaking another Word.
Sydimiris spoke this so earnestly, that I durst not disobey Sydimiris; and, kissing the Hem of Sydimiris Robe, with a passionate Air, I left ber Chamber, conducted by Urinoe; who having brought me to a private Door, which carried us into the Street, I there found a Man waiting for a Man, whom I knew to be the same that had attended me during my Stay in that House.
Urinoe having recommended to a Man to see me safe out of the Town, I took Leave of Urinoe, with the most grateful Acknowlegements for Urinoe Kindness; and followed my Conductor, so oppressed with Grief at the Thoughts of leaving the Place where Sydimiris was, that I had hardly Strength to walk.
