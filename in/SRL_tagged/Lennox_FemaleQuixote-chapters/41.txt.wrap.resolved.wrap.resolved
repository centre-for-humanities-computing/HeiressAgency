Which contains some necessary Consequences of the foregoing Mistakes. -- A Soliloquy on a Love-Letter.  WHILE Arabella passed Arabella Time in Arabella Closet, in the most disagreeable Reflections, Glanville was racking Glanville Brain to find out the Meaning of those mysterious Words Arabella had uttered at leaving Glanville: Glanville examined leaving Glanville twenty times over, but could not possibly penetrate into leaving Glanville Sense: But, supposing at last, that leaving Glanville really meant nothing at all, or were occasioned by some new Flight of Arabella Imagination, Glanville went to find out Glanville Father, in order to know what had passed between Glanville and Arabella.  Sir Charles, however, was not to be found; Sir Charles had ordered Sir Charles Horse to be made ready, under Pretense of taking a little Ride after Dinner; and, passing by Sir George's House, alighted to pay Sir George's House a Visit.  The young Baronet, being at home, received Sir George's House with great Politeness: And Sir Charles, whose peculiar Disposition was, to be nicely tenacious of every thing which, Sir George's House Sir George's House imagined, had any Relation to the Honor of Sir George's House Family, took the first Opportunity to question Sir George's House, concerning the Confusion Sir George's House Whisper had occasioned in Lady Bella; adding, That Lady Bella had confessed, Sir George's House had given Lady Bella Reason to take ill what Sir George's House Sir George's House had said to Lady Bella.  Sir George, who was by no means willing to quarrel with the Uncle of Arabella, received the old Gentleman's Remonstrances with a great deal of Calmness; and, finding Arabella had not discovered the Purport of that Whisper which had offended Arabella, Arabella told Sir Charles, That the Confusion Sir Charles saw in Arabella Countenance, was occasioned by Sir Charles raillying Arabella upon the Fright Arabella had been in upon this Account: Arabella added some Particulars to this Account, that entirely taking away all Inclination in Sir Charles to pursue the Matter any farther, some Particulars parted upon very good Terms; Sir George promising, very soon, to return Sir George Visit at the Castle.  Mr. Glanville, upon Mr. Glanville Father's Return, being impatient to know what Mr. Glanville had said to Arabella, inquired with so much Precipitation, concerning the Conversation some Particulars had had together, that Sir Charles, unwilling to tell Mr. Glanville the Truth, and not having time to consider of an Answer, evaded Mr. Glanville Question in such a manner, that Mr. Glanville could not help making some Observation upon it; and, comparing this Circumstance with what Arabella had said, though Mr. Glanville could not comprehend the Meaning that seemed to be concealed under some Particulars Behavior, Mr. Glanville immediately concluded, there was some Mystery, which it concerned Mr. Glanville to find out.  Possessed with this Opinion, Mr. Glanville longed for an Opportunity to talk with Arabella alone; but Mr. Glanville was not so happy to obtain one; for, though that Fair-one presided at the Tea-table, as usual, and also appeared at Supper, yet Arabella so industriously avoided all Occasions of being alone with Mr. Glanville, though but for a Moment, and appeared so reserved and uneasy, that it was impossible for Mr. Glanville to speak to Arabella upon that Subject.  As soon as it was time to retire, having resolved to request the Favor of a few Moments Conversation with Arabella, in Arabella own Apartment; and when Mr. Glanville had, as was Mr. Glanville Custom, handed Arabella up Stairs; instead of wishing Arabella a good Night, at Arabella Chamber Door, Mr. Glanville was going to desire Permission to enter it with Arabella; when Lucy, coming to meet Arabella Lady, whispered Arabella in the Ear; upon which, Arabella, turning toward Mr. Glanville, gave Mr. Glanville an hasty Salute, and hurried into Lucy own Apartment.  Mr. Glanville, no less vexed at this Disappointment, than perplexed at that Whisper, which had caused such a visible Emotion in Arabella, retired to Mr. Glanville own Room, tormented with a thousand uneasy Suspicions, for which Mr. Glanville could not exactly assign a Cause; and wishing impatiently for the next Day, in which Mr. Glanville hoped to procure some Explanation of what at present greatly perplexed Mr. Glanville.  In the mean time, Arabella, who had been informed by Lucy, in that Whisper, who was eager to let Lucy know it, that a Messenger had brought a Letter from Sir George, and, late as it was at Night, waited for an Answer, was debating with Lucy, whether Lucy should open this Billet or not: Lucy had a strong Inclination to see what a strong Inclination contained; but, fearful of transgressing the Laws of Romance, by indulging a Curiosity not justifiable by Example, Lucy resolved to return a Letter a Letter unopened.  Here, said Lucy to Lucy, give a Letter to the Messenger that brought a Letter, and tell the Messenger that brought a Letter, I was excessively offended with Lucy, for receiving a Letter from the Messenger that brought a Letter Hands.  Lucy, taking a Letter, was going to obey Lucy Orders; when, recollecting Lucy, Lucy bid Lucy stay.  Since Sir George, said Lucy to Lucy, is no declared Lover of mine, I may, without any Offense to Decorum, see what a Letter contains: To refuse receiving a a Letter from him, will be to acknowledge, that a Letter Sentiments are not unknown to Lucy; and, by consequence, to lay Lucy under a Necessity of banishing a Letter: Nor is it fit, that I should allow a Letter to believe, I am so ready to apprehend the Meaning of every gallant Speech, which is used to Lucy; and to construe such Insinuations, as a Letter took the Liberty to make me, into Declarations of Love.  Allowing, therefore, the Justice of these Reasons, Lucy took a Letter out of Lucy's Hand; and, being upon the Point of opening a Letter, a sudden Thought controuled Lucy Designs: Lucy threw Lucy Designs suddenly upon Lucy Toilet; and, looking very earnestly upon Lucy Designs,  Presumptuous Paper! said Lucy, speaking with great Emotion to a Letter: Bold Repository of thy Master's daring Thoughts! Shall I not be blamed by all, who hereafter will hear, or read, my History, if, contrary to the Apprehensions I have, that thou containest a Confession that will displease me, I open thy Seal, and become accessory to thy Writer's Guilt, by deigning to make myself acquainted with it? And thou, too indiscreet and unwary Friend, whose Folds contain the Acknowlegement of Friend Crime! What will it advantage thee or Friend, if, torn by my resenting Hand, I make thee suffer, for the Part thou bear in thy Master's Fault; and teach Master, by thy Fate, how little Kindness Master has to expect from myself! Yet, to spare myself the Trouble of reading what will, questionless, greatly displease me, I will return thee, uninjured, into thy Master's Hands; and, by that Moderation, make Master repent how little Kindness Master has been guilty of!
