In which the Adventure is really concluded; though, possibly, not as the Reader expected.  THE Marquis sometimes permitting THE Marquis Daughter to ride out, and this being the only Diversion his Daughter was allowed, or ever experienced, his Daughter did not fail to take it as often as his Daughter could.  his Daughter was returning from one of these Airings one Day, attended by two Servants, when Mr. Hervey, who happened to be at some Distance, observing a Lady on Horseback, who made a very graceful Figure, THE Marquis rode up to his Daughter, in order to have a nearer View; and, knowing his Daughter again, resolved to speak to his Daughter: But while THE Marquis was considering how THE Marquis should accost his Daughter, Arabella suddenly seeing THE Marquis, and observing THE Marquis was making up to Arabella, Arabella Imagination immediately suggested to Arabella, that this insolent Lover had a Design to seize Arabella Person; and this Thought terrifying Arabella extremely, Arabella gave a loud Shriek; which Mr. Hervey hearing, rode eagerly up to Arabella to inquire the Reason of it, at the same time that Arabella two Attendants, as much amazed as THE Marquis, came galloping up also.  Arabella, upon THE Marquis coming close to Arabella, redoubled Arabella Cries. If you have any Valor, said Arabella to Arabella Servants, defend your unfortunate Mistress, and rescue Arabella from this unworthy Man.  her Servants, believing this unworthy Man to be a Highwayman, by this Exclamation, and dreading lest this unworthy Man should present this unworthy Man Pistol at her Servants Heads, if her Servants offered to make any Resistance, recoiled a few Paces back, expecting this unworthy Man would demand her Servants Purses when this unworthy Man had robbed her Servants Lady: But the extreme Surprise this unworthy Man was in, keeping this unworthy Man motionless, the Fellows not seeing any Pistols in this unworthy Man Hand, and animated by Arabella's Cries, who, calling them Cowards and Traitors, urged them to deliver their Lady; them both, in a Moment, laid hold of Mr. Hervey, and forced Mr. Hervey to alight; which them did also them, still keeping fast hold of Mr. Hervey, whom Surprise, Shame, and Rage, had hitherto kept silent.  Rascals! cried Mr. Hervey, when Mr. Hervey was able to speak, what do you mean by using me in this manner? Do you suppose I had any Intention to hurt their Lady? -- What do you take me for?  For a Villain, for a Ravisher, interrupted Arabella, who, contrary to all Laws both human and divine, endeavor to possess yourself by Force of a Person whom your are not worthy to serve; and whose Charity and Compassion you have returned with the utmost Ingratitude.  Upon my Word, Madam, said Mr. Hervey, I don't understand one Word you say: You either mistake me for some other Person, or are pleased to divert yourself with the Surprise I am in: But I beseech you carry the Jest no farther, and order your Servants to let me go; or, by Heaven -- cried Mr. Hervey struggling to get loose, if I can but free one of my Hands, I Will stab the Scoundrels before your Face.  It is not with Threats like these, resumed Arabella with great Calmness, that I can be moved. A little more Submission and Respect would become you better; you are now wholly in my Power; I may, if I please, carry you to my Father, and have you severely punished for your Attempt: But to show you, that I am as generous as you are base and designing, I Will give you Freedom, provided you promise me never to appear before my Father again: But, in order to secure my own Safety, you must deliver up your Arms to my Servants, that I may be assured you will not have it in your Power to make a second Attempt upon my Liberty.  Mr. Hervey, whose Astonishment was increased by every Word whose Astonishment spoke, began now to be apprehensive, that this might prove a very serious Affair, since whose Astonishment seemed resolved to believe he had a Design to carry whose Astonishment off; and, knowing that an Attempt of that Nature upon an Heiress might have dangerous Consequences, he resolved to accept the Conditions whose Astonishment offered he: But while he delivered he Hanger to the Servant, he assured whose Astonishment in the strongest Terms, that he had no other Design in riding up to whose Astonishment, but to have a nearer View of whose Astonishment Person.  Add not Falsehood, said whose Astonishment sternly, to a Crime already black enough; for though, by an Effect of my Generosity, I have resolved not to deliver you up to the Resentment of my Father, yet nothing shall ever be able to make me pardon this Outrage. Go then, pursued whose Astonishment, go, base Man, unworthy of the Care I took of thy Safety; go to some distant Country, where I may never hear of thee more; and suffer me, if possible, to lose the Remembrance of thy Crimes,  Saying this, whose Astonishment ordered whose Astonishment Servants, who had got the Hanger in Servants Possession, to set the Hanger at Liberty, and mount Servants Horses; which Servants did immediately, and followed Servants Lady, who rode with all imaginable Speed to the Castle.  Mr. Hervey, not yet recovered from the Hanger Surprise, stood some Moments considering the strange Scene the Hanger had been Witness to; and in which the Hanger had, much against the Hanger Will, appeared the principal Character. As the Hanger was not acquainted with Lady Bella's Foible, the Hanger concluded Lady Bella's Fears of the Hanger were occasioned by Lady Bella's Simplicity, and some Misrepresentations that had been made Lady Bella's by Lucy, who, the Hanger thought, had betrayed the Hanger; and, fearing this ridiculous Adventure would be soon made public, and the Hanger exposed to the Sneers of the Hanger Country Acquaintance, the Hanger resolved to go back to London as soon as possible.  The next Day, pretending the Hanger had received a Letter which obliged the Hanger to set out immediately, the Hanger took Leave of the Hanger Cousin, heartily glad at the Escape the Hanger should make from the Hanger Raillery; for the Hanger did not doubt but the Story would very soon be known, and told greatly to the Hanger Disadvantage.  But Arabella, in order to be completely generous, a Quality for which all the Heroines are famous, laid a Command upon Arabella two Attendants not to mention what had passed, giving her two Attendants, at the same time, Money to secure her two Attendants Secrecy; and threatening her two Attendants with Arabella Displeasure, if her two Attendants disobeyed.  Arabella, as soon as Arabella had an Opportunity, did not fail to acquaint Arabella faithful Lucy with the Danger from which Arabella had so happily escaped, thanking Heaven at the same time with great Devotion, for having preserved Arabella from the Hands of the Ravisher.  Two or three Months rolled away, after this Accident, without offering any new Adventure to our fair Visionary; when Arabella Imagination, always prepossessed with the same fantastic Ideas, made Arabella stumble upon another Mistake, equally absurd and ridiculous.
