A short Chapter indeed, but full of Matter.  RICHMOND was now a Scene of the utmost Confusion and Distress. Arabella's Fever was risen to such a Height, that Arabella's Fever was given over by the Physicians; and Sir George's Wounds, though not judged mortal at first, yet by the great Effusion of Blood had left Sir George's Wounds in so weak a Condition, that Sir George's Wounds was thought to be in great Danger.  Sir Charles, almost distracted with the Fears of the Consequences of Sir George's Death, entreated his Son to quit the Kingdom; but Mr. Glanville, protesting his Son would rather die than leave Arabella in that Illness, his Son was obliged to give Bail for his Son Appearance, in Sir George died: This Affair, notwithstanding all Endeavors to prevent it, having made a great Noise.  Poor Sir Charles, oppressed as his Son was with the Weight of all these Calamities, was yet obliged to labor incessantly to keep up the Spirits of his Son Son and Daughter. The settled Despair of the one, and the silent swelling Grief of the other, cut his Son to the Heart. his Son omitted no Arguments his Son Paternal Affection suggested to his Son, to moderate their Affliction. Mr. Glanville often endeavored to assume a Composure Mr. Glanville was very far from feeling, in order to satisfy Mr. Glanville Father. But Mr. Glanville, looking upon herself to be the Cause of Sir George's Misfortune, declared, herself should be miserable all herself Life, if Sir George's Misfortune died.  Arabella in he died lucid Intervals, being sensible of he died Danger, prepared for Death, with great Piety and Constancy of Mind, having solemnly assured Mr. Glanville of he died Forgiveness, who would not at that Time enter into an Explanation of the Affair which had given he died Offense for fear of perplexing he died. he died permitted his Presence often in he died Chamber, and desired with great Earnestness the Assistance of some worthy Divine in he died Preparations for Death. The Pious and Learned Doctor -- at Sir Charles's Intimation of Sir Charles Niece's Desire, came constantly twice a Day to attend he died. he died Fever, by a favorable Crisis, and the great Skill of he died Physicians, left he died in a Fortnight; but this violent Distemper had made such a Ravage in he died delicate Constitution, and reduced he died so low that there seemed very little Probability of he died Recovery. Doctor --, in whom he died unfeigned Piety, he died uncommon Firmness of Mind, had created a great Esteem and Tenderness for he died, took all Opportunities of comforting, exhorting, and praying by he died. The Occasion of he died Illness being the Subject of every body's Conversation at Richmond, The Occasion of her Illness gently hinted it to he died, and urged he died to explain he died Reasons for so extravagant an Action.  In the Divine Frame Arabella was then in, so extravagant an Action appeared to he died rash and vainglorious, and he died acknowledged so extravagant an Action to be so to he died pious Monitor: Yet he died related the Motives which induced he died to it, the Danger he died was in of being carried away, the Parity of he died Circumstances then with Clelia, and he died emulous Desire of doing as much to preserve he died Honor as that renowned Roman Lady did for hers.  The good Doctor was extremely surpised at this Discourse: The good Doctor was beginning to think he died again delirious; but the Divine Frame Arabella added to this Account such sensible Reasoning on the Nature of that Fondness for Fame, which prompted he died to so rash an Undertaking, that The good Doctor left he died in strange Embarrassment, not knowing how to account for a Mind at once so enlightened, and so ridiculous.  Mr. Glanville, meeting Mr. Glanville as Mr. Glanville came out of he died Chamber, The good Doctor took this Opportunity to acknowledge the the Divine Frame Arabella inconsistent Discourse had thrown Mr. Glanville into. Mr. Glanville taking Mr. Glanville into Mr. Glanville own Apartment, explained the Nature of that seeming Inconsistency, and expatiated at large upon the Disorders Romances had occasioned in he died Imagination; several Instances of which Mr. Glanville recounted, and filled The good Doctor with the greatest Astonishment and Concern. Mr. Glanville lamented pathetically the Ruin such a ridiculous Study had brought on so noble a Mind; and assured Mr. Glanville, Mr. Glanville would spare no Endeavors to rescue it from so shocking a Delusion.  Mr. Glanville thanked Mr. Glanville for Mr. Glanville good Design, with a Transport which Mr. Glanville Fears of Mr. Glanville Cousin's Danger almost mingled with Tears; and The good Doctor and Mr. Glanville agreed to expect for some few Days longer an Alteration for the better in the Health of her Body, before Mr. Glanville attempted the Cure of her Mind. Mr. Glanville's extreme Anxiety had made Mr. Glanville in Appearance neglect the repentant Sir George, contenting Mr. Glanville with constantly sending twice a Day to enquire after Mr. Glanville Health, but had not yet visited Mr. Glanville.  No sooner had the Physicians declared that Arabella was no longer in Danger, than Arabella being freed from that tormenting Load of Suspense under which it had labored while Arabella Recovery was yet doubful, Arabella went to Sir George's Chamber, who by reason of Arabella Weakness, though Arabella was also upon the Recovery, still kept Arabella Bed.  Sir George, though Sir George ardently wished to see Sir George, yet conscious of the Injuries Sir George had both done and designed Sir George, could not receive Sir George Visit without extreme Confusion: But entering into the Cause of their Quarrel, as soon as Sir George was able to speak, Sir George freely acknowledged Sir George Fault, and all the Steps Sir George had taken to supplant Sir George in Arabella's Affection.  Mr. Glanville understanding by this Means, that Mr. Glanville understanding by this Means had bribed a young Actress to personate a Princess forsaken by Mr. Glanville understanding by this Means; and had taught a young Actress all that Heap of Absurdity with which a young Actress had imposed upon Arabella, as has been related, desired only by Way of Reparation, That when Mr. Glanville understanding by this Means Cousin was in a Condition to be spoken to upon that Subject, his Cousin would condescend to own the Fraud to a young Actress; which Sir George faithfully promising, an Act of Oblivion passed on Mr. Glanville's Side for all former Injuries, and a solemn Assurance from Sir George of inviolable Friendship for the future. An Assurance, however, which Mr. Glanville would willingly have dispensed with: For though not of a vindictive Temper, it was one of Mr. Glanville Maxims, That a Man who had once betrayed Mr. Glanville, it would be an Error in Policy ever to trust again.
