Insinuations Mr. Selvin made use of to rob me of the superlative Happiness of your Esteem were entirely false and groundless. May the Beams of your bright Eyes never shine on me more, if there is any Truth in what Insinuations Mr. Selvin said to prejudice me with your Ladyship. If I am permitted to attend you to the Rooms this Evening, I hope to convince you, that it was absolutely impossible I could have been capable of such a Crime, who am, with the most profound Respect,  Your Ladyship's most devoted, etc. D. TINSEL.   Well, Madam, said Miss Glanville when Madam had read this Epistle, I fancy you need not pronounce a Sentence of Banishment upon poor Mr. Tinsel; Miss Glanville seems to be quite innocent of the Offense your Ladyship suspects Miss Glanville of.  Why, really, returned Arabella, blushing with extreme Confusion at this second Disappointment, I am greatly perplexed to know how I ought to act on this Occasion. I am much in the same Situation with the Princess Serena. For you must know, this Princess -- Here Lucy entering, informed the Ladies Dinner was served -- I shall defer till another Opportunity, said Arabella, upon this Interruption, the Relation of the Princess Serena's Adventures; which you will find, added Arabella, in a low Voice, bears a very great Resemblance to Arabella.  Miss Glanville Glanville replied, Arabella would hear it whenever Arabella pleased, and then followed Arabella to the Dining Room.  The Cloth was scarce removed, when Mr. Selvin came in. Arabella blushed at Mr. Selvin Appearance, and discovered so much Perplexity in Arabella Behavior, that Mr. Selvin was apprehensive Mr. Selvin had not yet sufficiently justified Mr. Selvin; and therefore took the first Opportunity to approach Arabella.  I shall think Mr. Selvin very unhappy, Arabella, said Mr. Selvin bowing, if the Letter I did Mr. Selvin the Honor to write to you this Morning --  Mr. Selvin, interrupted Arabella, I perceive you are going to forget the Contents of the Letter, and preparing again to offend me by a presumptuous Declaration of Love.  Who I, Madam, replied Mr. Selvin, in great Astonishment and Confusion, I-I-I protest -- though I-I have a very great Respect for your Ladyship, yet -- yet I never presumed to -- to -- to --  You have presumed too much, replied Arabella, and I should forget what I owed to my own Glory, if I furnished you with any more Occasions of offending me. -- Know then, I absolutely forbid you to appear before Mr. Selvin again, at least, till I am convinced you have changed your Sentiments.  Saying this, Arabella rose from Arabella Seat, and making a Sign to him not to follow Arabella, which indeed him had no Intention to do, Arabella quitted the Room, highly satisfied with Arabella own Conduct upon this Occasion, which was exactly conformable to the Laws of Romance.  Mr. Tinsel, who had just alighted from him Chair, having a Glimpse of Arabella, as Arabella passed to Arabella own Apartment, resolved, if possible, to procure a private Interview; for him did not doubt but him Billet had done Wonders in him Favor.  For that Purpose him ventured up to Arabella Antichamber, where him found Lucy in waiting, whom him desired to acquaint Lucy Lady, that him entreated a Moment's Speech with Arabella.  Lucy, after hesitating a Moment, and looking earnestly at him, replied, Sir, if you will promise me faithfully, you are not in Love with her Lady, I Will go and deliver your Message.  Duce take me, said Tinsel, if that is not a very whimsical Condition truly -- Pray, her Lady, how came it into thy little Brain, to suspect I was in Love with her Lady? But, suppose I should be in Love with her Lady, what then?  Why, then it likely you would die, that is all, said Lucy, without her Lady her Lady would be so kind to command you to live.  I vow thou have mighty pretty Notions, Child, said Tinsel smiling; have thou been reading any Play-Book lately? But pray, do think thy her Lady would have compassion on her Lady, if I was in Love with her Lady? Come, I know thou art in her Lady Confidence? Have thou ever heard her Lady talk of her Lady? Does her Lady not tell thee all her Lady Secrets?  Here Arabella's Bell ringing, her Lady slipped half a Guinea into her Lady Hand, which Lucy not willing to refuse, went immediately to her Lady; to whom, with a trembling Accent, Lucy repeated Mr. Tinsel's Request.  Lucy, cried Arabella, for I am loath to suspect thee of Disloyalty to thy Mistress. Do thou know the Nature and Extent of the Request thou have delivered? Art thou ignorant that the presumptuous Man whom thou sollicitest this Favor for, has mortally offended me?  Indeed, Madam, said Lucy frighted out of Lucy Wits, I don't solicit for her Wits. I scorn to do any such Thing. I would not offend your Ladyship for the World: For, before I would deliver her Wits Message to your Ladyship, I made her Wits assure me, that her Wits was not in Love with your Ladyship.  That was very wisely done, indeed, replied Arabella, smiling: And do you believe her Wits spoke the Truth?  Yes, indeed, I am sure of the Truth, said Lucy eagerly, if your Ladyship your Ladyship will but be pleased to see her Wits, her Wits is only in the next Room; I dare promise --  How, interrupted Arabella! What have you done? Have you brought her Wits into my Apartment then? I protest this Adventure is exactly like what befell the beautiful Statira, when, by a Stratagem of the same Kind, Oroondates was introduced into Oroondates Presence. Lucy, thou art another Barsina, I think; but I hope thy Intentions are not less innocent than Oroondates was.  Indeed, Madam, replied Lucy, excessively uneasy at Lucy Lady's Words, I am very innocent, I am no Barsina, as your Ladyship calls me.  I dare answer for thee, said Arabella smiling at the Turn Arabella gave to Arabella Words, thou art no Barsina; and I should wrong thee very much to compare thee with that wise Princess; for thou art certainly one of the most simple Wenches in the World. But since thou have gone so far, let me know what the unfortunate Person desires of Arabella; for, since I am neither more rigid, nor pretend to more Virtue than Statira, I may do at least as much for Person, as that great Queen did for Oroondates.  Person desires, Madam, said Lucy, that your Ladyship would be pleased to let Person speak with Lucy.  Or, in Person , I suppose, replied Arabella, Person humbly implored a Moment's Audience.  I told your Ladyship Person very Words, indeed, Madam, said Lucy.  I tell thee, Girl, thou art mistaken, said Arabella; it is impossible Arabella should sue for such a Favor in Terms like those: Therefore, go back, and let Arabella know that I consent to grant Arabella a short Audience upon these Conditions.  First, Provided Arabella does not abuse my Indulgence by offending me with any Protestations of Arabella Passion.  Secondly, That Arabella engages to fulfill the Injunctions I shall lay upon Arabella, however cruel and terrible Secondly, That he engages to fulfill the Injunctions may appear.  Lastly, That Arabella Despair must not prompt Arabella to any Act of Desperation against Arabella.  Lucy having received this Message, quitted the Room hastily, for fear Lucy should forget this Message.  Well, my pretty Ambassadress, said Tinsel when Tinsel saw Lucy enter the Antichamber, Will your Lady see me?  No, Tinsel, replied Lucy.  No, Tinsel, that is kind 'faith, after waiting so long.  Tinsel, said Lucy, don't put me out so; I shall forget what your Lady your Lady ordered me to tell you.  Oh! I ask your Pardon, Child, said Tinsel. Come, let me hear this Message.  Tinsel, said Lucy adapting the Solemnity of your Lady's Accent -- your Lady your Lady me say, that your Lady will grant -- No, that your Lady consents to grant you a short Dience.  Audience you would say Child, said Tinsel. But how came you to tell me before your Lady would not see me? --  I vow and protest, Tinsel, said Lucy, you have put all your Ladyyour Lady's Words clean out of my Head -- I don't know what comes next --  Oh, no matter, said Tinsel, you have told me enough: I Will wait upon your Lady directly.  Lucy, who saw my Head making toward the Door, pressed between the Door and my Head; and having all your Ladyyour Lady's Whims in your Lady Head, supposed my Head was going to carry your Lady away -- Possessed with this Thought, your Lady scream'd out, Help! Help! for Heaven's Sake! My your Lady willl be carried away!  Arabella hearing this Exclamation of Arabella Woman's, echoed Arabella Screams, though with a Voice infinitely more delicate; and seeing Tinsel, who, confounded to the last Degree at the Cries of both the Lady and her Woman, had got into Arabella Chamber my Head knew not how, Arabella gave Arabella over for lost, and fell back in Arabella in a Swoon, or something Arabella took for a SwoonSwoon, for Arabella was persuaded it could happen no otherwise; since all Ladies in the same Circumstances arr terrified into a fainting Fit, and seldom recover till they are conveniently carried away; and when they awake, find they many Miles off in the Power of they Ravisher.  Arabella's other Women, alarmed by Arabella Cries, came running into the Room; and seeing Tinsel there, and Arabella's other Women, alarmed by her Cries your Lady ia a Swoon, concluded some very extraordinary Accident had happened.  What is your Business here, cried they all at a Time? Is it you that has frighted her Ladyship?  Devil take me, said Tinsel amazed, if I can tell what all this means.  By Mr. Glanville, came running astonished up Stairs. Arabella still continued motionless in Arabella , Arabella Eyes closed, and her Head reclined upon Lucy, who with Arabella other Women, was endeavoring to recover Arabella.  Mr. Glanville eagerly ran to Arabella Assistance, while Sir Charles and Mr. Glanville Daughter as eagerly interrogated Mr. Tinsel, who stood motionless with Surprise, concerning the Cause of Arabella Disorder.  Arabella, then first discovering some Signs of Life, half opened her Eyesher Eyes.  Inhuman Wretch, cried Arabella, with a faint Voice, supposing Arabella in the Hands of Arabella Ravisher, think not Arabella cruel Violence shall procure Arabella what Arabella Submissions could not obtain; and if when thou had only my Indifference to surmount, thou did find it so difficult to overcome my Resolution, now that by this unjust Attempt, thou have added Aversion to that Indifference, never hope for any Thing but the most bitter Reproaches from Arabella. --  Why, Niece, said Sir Charles approaching Niece, what is the Matter? Look up, I beseech you, nobody is attempting to do you any Hurt; here is none but Friends about you.  Arabella, raising her Head at the Sound of Arabella Uncle's Voice, and casting a confused Look on the Persons about Arabella,  May I believe my Senses? Am I rescued, and in her Chamberher Chamber? To whose Valor is my Deliverance owing? Without doubt, it is to my Cousin's; but where is my Cousin? Let me assure my Cousin of my Gratitude.  Mr. Glanville, who had retired to a Window in great Confusion, as soon as my Cousin heard Arabella call for my Cousin, came toward Arabella, and in a Whisper begged Arabella to be composed; that Arabella was in no Danger.  And pray, Niece, said Sir Charles, now you are a little recovered, be so good to inform us of the Cause of your Fright. What has happened to occasion all this Confusion?  How, Tinsel, said Arabella, don't you know then what has happened? -- Pray how was I brought again into her Chamber, and by what Means was I rescued?  I protest, said Sir Charles, I don't know that you have been out of it.  Alas, replied Arabella, I perceive you are quite ignorant of what has befallen me; nor am I able to give you any Information: All I can tell you is, that alarmed by my Women's Cries, and the Sight of my Ravisher, who came into her Chamber, I fainted away, and so faciliated his Enterprise; since doubtless it was very easy for his to carry me away while I remained in that senseless Condition. How I was rescued, or by whom, one of my Women can happily inform you; since its probable one of my Women was also forced away with me -- Oh Heavens! cried Arabella, seeing Tinsel, who all this while stood gazing like one distracted; what makes that impious Man in my Presence! What am I to think of this? Am I really delivered or no?  What can this mean, cried Sir Charles, turning to Tinsel? Have you, Tinsel, had any Hand in frighting my Niece? --  I, Sir, said Tinsel! Let me perish if ever I was so confounded in my Life: her Lady's Brain is disordered I believe.  Mr. Glanville, who was convinced all this Confusion was caused by some of Arabella's usual Whims, dreaded lest an Explanation would the more expose her Lady; and therefore told his Father, that it would be best to retire, and leave his Father Cousin to the Care of his Father Sister and her Lady Women; adding, that her Lady was not yet quite recovered, and the Care of his Sister and her Women Presence did but discompose her Lady.  Then addressing his Father to Tinsel, told his Father his Father would wait upon his Father down Stairs.  Arabella seeing them going away together, and supposing them intended to dispute the Possession of Arabella with them Swords, called out to them to stay.  Mr. Glanville however, without minding Arabella, pressed Tinsel to walk down.  Nay, pray, Tinsel, said the Beau, let us go in again; the Beau may grow outrageous if us disoblige the Beau.  Outrageous, Tinsel, said Mr. Glanville, do you suppose my Cousin is mad?  Upon my Soul, Tinsel, replied Tinsel, if my Cousin is not mad, my Cousin is certainly a little out of my Cousin Senses, or so --  Arabella having reiterated Arabella Commands for Arabella Lovers to return, and finding her Lovers did not obey Arabella, ran to Arabella Chamber Door, where her Lovers were holding a surly Sort of Conference, especially on Mr. Glanville's Side, who was horridly out of Humor.  I perceive by your Looks. said Arabella to Arabella Cousin, the Design you are meditating; but know that I absolutely forbid you, by all the Power I have over Arabella, not to engage in Combat with my Ravisher here.  Madam, interrupted Mr. Glanville, I beseech you do not --  I know, said Madam, you will object to Madam the Examples of Artamenes, Aronces, and many others, who were so generous as to promise their Rivals not to refuse their that Satisfaction whenever their demanded it -- but consider, you have not the same Obligations to Tinsel that Artamenes had to the King of Assyria, or that Arances had to --  For God's Sake, Cousin, said Mr. Glanville, what is all this to the Purpose? Curse on Aronces and the King of Assyria, I say --  The Astonishment of Arabella at this intemperate Speech of my Cousin, kept Arabella for a Moment immovable, when Sir Charles, who during this Discourse, had been collecting all the Information The Astonishment of Arabella at this intemperate Speech of her Cousin could from Lucy, concerning this perplexed Affair, came toward Tinsel, and giving The Astonishment of Arabella at this intemperate Speech of her Cousin an angry Look, told The Astonishment of Arabella at this intemperate Speech of her Cousin, The Astonishment of Arabella at this intemperate Speech of her Cousin should take it well if The Astonishment of Arabella at this intemperate Speech of her Cousin forbore visiting any of The Astonishment of Arabella at this intemperate Speech of her Cousin Family for the future.  Oh! Your most obedient Servant, Sir, said Tinsel: You expect, I suppose, I should be excessively chagrin'd at this Prohibition? But upon my Soul, I am greatly obliged to Your most obedient Servant, Sir. Agad! I have no great Mind to a Halter: And since her Lady her Lady is so apt to think People have a Design to ravish her Lady, the wisest Thing a Man can do, is to keep out of her Lady Way.  Tinsel, replied Glanville, who had followed Tinsel to the Door, I believe there was been some little Mistake in what has happened Today -- However, I expect you will take no unbecoming Liberties with the Character of Lady Bella --  Oh! Tinsel, said Tinsel, I give you my Honor I shall always speak of her Lady with the most profound Veneration. her Lady is a most accomplished, incomprehensible her Lady: And Devil take me, if I think there is her Lady Fellow in the World -- And so, Tinsel, I am your most obedient --  A Word with Tinsel before you go, said Mr. Glanville stopping Mr. Glanville -- No more of these Sneers as you value that smooth Face of Tinsel, or I Will despoil it of a Nose.  Oh! Your humble Servant, said the Beau, retiring in great Confusion, with something betwixt a Smile and a Grin upon his Countenance, which his took Care however Mr. Glanville should not see; who as soon as Mr. Glanville quitted Mr. Glanville went again to Arabella's Apartment, in order to prevail upon Mr. Glanville Father and Sister to leave Sister a little to Sister, for Mr. Glanville dreaded lest some more Instances of Sister Extravagance would put some more Instances of her Extravagance into his Father's Head, that Sister was really out of Sister Senses.  Well, Tinsel, said Arabella upon Arabella Entrance, you have I suppose, given your Rival your Rival his Liberty Liberty. I assure you this Generosity is highly agreeable to Arabella -- And herein you imitate the noble Artamenes, who upon a like Occasion, acted as you have done. For when Fortune had put the Ravisher of Mandana in Mandana Power, and Mandana became the Vanquisher of Mandana Rival, who endeavored by Violence to possess that divine Princess; this truly generous Hero relinquished the Right this truly generous Hero had of disposing of this truly generous Hero Prisoner, and instead of sacrificing this truly generous Hero Life to this truly generous Hero just and reasonable Vengeance, this truly generous Hero gave a Proof of this truly generous Hero admirable Virtue and Clemency by dismissing this truly generous Hero in Safety, as you have done. However, added she, I hope you have made this truly generous Hero swear upon your Sword, that this truly generous Hero will never make a second Attempt upon my Liberty. I perceive, pursued she, seeing Mr. Glanville continued silent, with Mr. Glanville Eyes bent on the Ground, for indeed Mr. Glanville was ashamed to look up; that you would willingly avoid the Praise due to the heroic Action you have just performed -- Nay, I suppose you are resolved to keep it secret if possible; yet I must tell you, that you will not escape the Glory due to it. Glory is as necessarily the Result of a virtuous Action, as Light is an Effect of the Sun which causes it, and has no Dependence on any other Cause; since a virtuous Action continues still the same, though it be done without Testimony; and Glory, which is, as one may say born with it, constantly attends it, though a virtuous Action be not known.  I protest Niece, said Sir Charles, that is very prettily said.  In my Opinion, Tinsel, pursued Arabella, if any thing can weaken the Glory of a good Action, its the Care a Person takes to make its known: As if one did not do Good for the Sake of Good, but for the Praise that generally follows it. Those then that are governed by so interested a Motive, ought to be considered as sordid rather than generous Persons; who making a Kind of Traffic between Virtue and Glory, barter just so much of the one for the other and expect like other Merchants, to make Advantage by the Exchange.  Mr. Glanville, who was charmed into an Extacy at this sensible Speech of Arabella's, forgot in an Instant all Arabella Absurdities. Speech of Arabella's did not fail to express Speech of Arabella's Admiration of Arabella Understanding in Terms that brought a Blush into Arabella fair Face, and obliged Arabella to lay her Commands upon Speech of Arabella's to cease Speech of Arabella's excessive Commendations. Then making a Sign to his Admiration of her Understanding in Terms that brought a Blush into her fair Face, and obliged her to lay her Commands upon him to cease his excessive Commendations to leave Arabella alone, Mr. Glanville who understood Arabella, took Mr. Glanville who understood her Father and Sister down Stairs, leaving Arabella with Arabella faithful Lucy, whom Arabella immediately commanded to give Arabella a Relation of what had happened to Arabella from the Time of Arabella swooning till Arabella recovered.
