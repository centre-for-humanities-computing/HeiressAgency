In which our Heroine being mistaken our Heroine, gives Oceasion for a great many other Mistakes.
AS soon as the Ladies entered the Room, Mr. Selvin, with more Gaiety than usual, advanced toward Arabella, who put on so cold and severe a Countenance at his Approach, that the poor Man, extremely confused, drew back, and remained in great Perplexity, fearing his had offended her.
Mr. Tinsel, seeing Mr. Selvin's Reception, and awed by the becoming Majesty in Majesty Person, notwithstanding all Mr. Tinsel Assurance, accosted Majesty with less Confidence than was Mr. Tinsel Custom; but Arabella softning Majesty Looks with the most engaging Smiles, made an Apology for detaining them so long from the Parade, gave Majesty Hand to the Beau, as being not a suspected Person, and permitted Person to lead Majesty out.
Mr. Glanville, to whom Majesty always allowed the Preference on those Occasions, being a little indisposed, and not able to attend Majesty.
Mr. Tinsel, whose Vanity was greatly flattered by the Preference Arabella gave whose Vanity to whose Vanity Companion, proceeded according to whose Vanity usual Custom, to examine Majesty Looks and Behavior with more Care; conceiving such a Preference must proceed from a latent Motive which was not unfavourable for whose Vanity.
whose Vanity Discernment on these Occasions being very surprising, whose Vanity soon discovered in the bright Eyes of the Preference Arabella a secret Approbation of whose Vanity Person, which whose Vanity endeavored to increase by displaying it with all the Address whose Vanity was Master of, and did not fail to talk Majesty into an Opinion of whose Vanity Wit, by ridiculing every Body that passed them, and directing several studied Compliments to Majesty.
Miss Glanville, who was not so agreeably entertained by the grave Mr. Selvin, saw these Advances to a Gallantry with a Gallantry Cousin with great Disturbance: a Gallantry was resolved to interrupt it if possible, and being convinced Mr. Selvin preferred the Preference Arabella's Conversation to a Gallantry, a Gallantry plotted how to pair them together, and have the Beau to a Gallantry.
As them walked a few Paces behind a Gallantry Cousin and Mr. Tinsel, a Gallantry was in no Danger of being overheard; and taking Occasion to put Mr. Selvin in mind of Arabella's Behavior to Mr. Selvin, when Mr. Selvin accosted a Gallantry; a Gallantry asked Mr. Selvin, if Mr. Selvin was conscious of having done any thing to offend a Gallantry?
I protest, a Gallantry, replied Mr. Selvin, I know not of any thing I have done to displease a Gallantry.
I never failed, to my Knowledge, in my Respects toward a Gallantry Ladyship, for whom indeed I have a most profound Veneration.
I know so much of a Gallantry Temper, resumed Miss Glanville, as to be certain, if a Gallantry has taken it into a Gallantry Head to be angry with you, a Gallantry will be ten times more so at your Indifference: And if you hope for a Gallantry Favor, you must ask a Gallantry Pardon with the most earnest Submission imaginable.
If I knew I had offended a Gallantry, replied Mr. Selvin, I would very willingly ask her Pardonher Pardon; but really, since I have not been guilty of any Fault toward Ladyship, I don't know how to acknowledge it.
Well, said Miss Glanville Glanville coldly, I only took the Liberty to give you some friendly Advice, which you may follow, or not, as you please.
I know my Cousin is angry at something, and I wish you were Friends again, that is all.
I am mightily obliged to you, Madam, said Mr. Selvin; and since you assure me Ladyship Ladyship is angry, I Will ask her Pardonher Pardon, though, really, as I said before, I don't know for what.
Well, interrupted Miss Glanville, we'll join them at the End of the Parade; and to give you an Opportunity of speaking to my Cousinmy Cousin, I Will engage Mr. Tinsel myself.
Mr. Selvin, who thought Mr. Tinsel greatly obliged to Miss Glanville Glanville for Miss Glanville good Intentions, though in reality Miss Glanville had a View of exposing of my Cousin, as well as an Inclination to engage Mr. Tinsel, took Courage as they turned, to get on the other Side of Arabella, whom Mr. Tinsel had not dared before to approach, while Miss Glanville, addressing a Whisper of no great Importance to my Cousin, parted Miss Glanville from the Beau, and slackning Miss Glanville Pace a little, fell into a particular Discourse with Mr. Tinsel, which Arabella being too polite to interrupt, remained in a very perplexing Situation, dreading every Moment that Mr. Selvin would explain Mr. Selvin.
Alarmed at Mr. Selvin Silence, yet resolved to interrupt Mr. Selvin if Mr. Selvin began to speak, and afraid of beginning a Conversation first, lest Mr. Selvin should construe it to Mr. Selvin Advantage.
Mr. Selvin being naturally timid in the Company of Ladies, the Circumstance of Disgrace which Mr. Selvin was in with Arabella, Arabella Silence and Reserve so added to Mr. Selvin accustomed Diffidence, that though Mr. Selvin endeavored several times to speak, Mr. Selvin was not able to bring out any thing but a preluding Hem; which Mr. Selvin observed, to Mr. Selvin extreme Confusion, seemed always to increase Arabella's Constraint.
Indeed, that Lady, upon any Suspicion that Mr. Selvin was going to break his Silencehis Silence, always contracted her Brow into a Frown, cast down her Eyes with an Air of Perplexity, endeavored to hide her Blushes with her Fan; and to show her In-attention, directed her Looks to the contrary Side.
The Lady and Gentleman being in equal Confusion, no Advances were made on either Side toward a Conversation, and The Lady and Gentleman had reached almost the End of the Parade in an uninterrupted Silence; when Mr. Selvin, fearing Mr. Selvin should never again have so good an Opportunity of making Mr. Selvin Peace, collected all Mr. Selvin Resolution, and with an Accent trembling under the Importance of the Speech Mr. Selvin was going to make, began,  Madam, Since I have had the Honor of walking with your Ladyship, I have observed so many Signs of Constraint in your Manner, that I hardly dare entreat you to grant me a Moment's Hearing while I --  Sir, interrupted Arabella, before you go any further, I must inform you, that what you are going to say will mortally offend me.
Take heed then how you commit an Indiscretion which will force me to treat you very rigorously.
If your Ladyship will not allow me to speak in my own Justification, said Mr. Selvin, yet I hope you will not refuse to tell me my Offense, since Mr. Selvin --  You are very confident, indeed, ArabellaArabella, again, to suppose I will repeat what would be infinitely grievous for me to hear.
Against my Will, pursued Arabella, I must give you the Satisfaction to know, that I am not ignorant of your Crime, but I also assure you that I am highly incensed; and that, not only with the Thoughts you have dared to entertain of Mr. Selvin, but likewise with your Presumption in going about to disclose your Presumption.
Mr. Selvin, whom the seeming Contradictions in this Speech astonished, yet imagined in general it hinted at the Dispute between Speech and Mr. Tinsel; and supposing the Story had been told to Speech Disadvantage, which was the Cause of Arabella Anger, replied in great Emotion at the Injustice done Speech.
Since somebody has been so officious to acquaint your Ladyship with an Affair which ought to have been kept from your Knowledge; it is a Pity they did not inform you, that Mr. Tinsel was the Person that had the least Respect for your Ladyship, and is more worthy of your Resentment.
If Mr. Tinsel, replied Arabella, is guilty of an Offense like yours, yet since Mr. Tinsel has concealed it better, Mr. Tinsel is less culpable than yours; and you have done that for Mr. Tinsel, which happily Mr. Tinsel would never have had Courage enough to do for Mr. Tinsel as long as Mr. Tinsel lived.
Poor Selvin, quite confounded at these intricate Words, would have begged Poor Selvin to explain Poor Selvin, had Poor Selvin not silenced Mr. Tinsel with a dreadful Frown: Aand making a Stop till Miss Glanville and Mr. Tinsel came up to Aand making a Stop till Miss Glanville and Mr. Tinsel.
Poor Selvin told Poor Selvin my Cousin with a peevish Accent, that Poor Selvin had performed Poor Selvin Promise very ill; and whispered Poor Selvin, that Poor Selvin was to blame for all the Mortifications Poor Selvin had suffered.
Mr. Tinsel, supposing the Alteration in Arabella's Humor proceeded from being so long deprived of Mr. Tinsel Company; endeavored to make Poor Selvin Amends by a Profusion of Compliments; which Poor Selvin received with such an Air of Displeasure, that the Beau, vexed at the ill Success of his Gallantry, told Poor Selvin, his was afraid Mr. Selvin's Gravity had infected Poor Selvin .
Say rather, replied Arabella, that Arabella Indiscretion has offended me.
Mr. Tinsel, charmed with this beginning Confidence, which confirmed Arabella Hopes of having made foam Impression on Poor Selvin Heart; conjured Poor Selvin very earnestly to tell Arabella how Mr. Selvin had offended Poor Selvin.
It Is sufficient, resumed Poor Selvin, that I tell you Mr. Selvin has offended me, without declaring the Nature of Mr. Selvin Crime, since doubtless it has not escaped your Observation, which, if I may believe Mr. Selvin, is not wholly disinterested.
To confess yet more, it is true that Mr. Selvin has told me something concerning you, which --  Let me perish, Madam, interrupted the Beau, if one Syllable Mr. Selvin has said be true.
How, said Arabella, a little disconcerted, Will you always persist in a Denial then?
Deny a Denial, a Gallantry, returned Mr. Tinsel, I Will deny what Mr. Tinsel has said with my last Breath; it is all a scandalous Forgery: No Man living is less likely to think of your Ladyship in that Manner.
If you knew my Thoughts, Madam, you would be convinced nothing is more impossible, and --  Sir, interrupted Arabella, extremely mortified, methinks you are very eager in your Justification.
I promise you, I do not think you guilty of the Offense Mr. Tinsel charged you with; if I did, you would happily experience my Resentment in such a Manner, as would make you repent of your Presumption.
Arabella, in finishing these Words, interrupted Miss GlanvilleGlanville's Discourse with Mr. Selvin, to tell Arabella, Arabella desired to return Home; to which that young Lady, who had not been at all pleased with the Morning's Walk, consented.
