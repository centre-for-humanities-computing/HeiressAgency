Highwaymen! repeated Arabella.

Why, ay, to be sure, Madam, rejoined Sir Charles: What do you take them for?

For Persons of Quality, Sir, resumed Arabella; and though they came
questionless, either upon a good or bad Design, yet it cannot be doubted, but
that their Birth is illustrious; otherwise they would never pretend either to
fight in our Defense, or to carry us away.

I vow, Niece, said Sir Charles, I cannot possibly understand you.

My Cousin, Sir, interrupted Mr. Glanville, has been mistaken in these Persons;
and has not yet, possibly, believed them to be Highwaymen, who came to rob us.

There is no Question, Sir, said Arabella, smiling, that if they did not come
to defend us, they came to rob you: But it is hard to guess, which of us it was
of whom they designed to deprive you; for it may very possibly be for my
Cousin's fake, as well as mine, that this Enterprise was undertaken.

Pardon me, Madam, said Mr. Glanville, who was willing to prevent his Father
from answering her Absurdities; these Men had no other Design, than to rob us
of our Money.

How! said Arabella: Were these Cavaliers* who appeared to be in so handsome a
Garb, that I took them for Persons of prime Quality, were they Robbers? I have
been strangely mistaken, it seems: However, I apprehend there is no Certainty,
that your Suspicions are true; and it may still be as I say, that they either
came to rescue or carry us away.

Mr. Glanville, to avoid a longer Dispute, changed the Discourse; having
observed with Confusion, that Sir Charles, and his Sister, seemed to look upon
his beloved Cousin as one that was out of her Senss.
