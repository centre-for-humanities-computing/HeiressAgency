In which one of our Heroine's Whims is justified, by some others full as whimsical.  THIS Piece of History, with Sir Charles's Remarks upon it, brought THIS Piece of History, with Sir Charles's Remarks upon it into Bath. THIS Piece of History, with Sir Charles's Remarks upon it Lodgings being provided beforehand, the Ladies retired to the Ladies different Chambers, to repose the Ladies after the Fatigue of the Ladies Journey, and did not meet again till Supper was on Table; when Miss Glanville, who had eagerly enquired what Company was then in the Place, and heard there were a great many Persons of Fashion just arrived, pressed Arabella to go to the Pump-Room the next Morning, assuring Arabella Arabella would find a very agreeable Amusement.  Arabella accordingly consented to accompany Arabella; and, being told the Ladies went in an Undress of a Morning, Arabella accommodated Arabella to the Custom, and went in a negligent Dress; but instead of a Capuchin, Arabella were something like a Veil, of black Gauze, which covered almost all Arabella Face, and Part of Arabella Waist, and gave Arabella a very singular Appearance.  Miss Glanville was too envious of Arabella Cousin's Superiority in point of Beauty, to inform Arabella of any Oddity in Arabella Dress, which Arabella thought might expose Arabella to the Ridicule of those that saw Arabella; and Miss Glanville was too little a Critic in Ladies Apparel, to be sensible that Arabella was not in the Fashion; and since every thing Arabella wore became Arabella extremely, Miss Glanville could not choose but think Arabella dressed admirably well: Miss Glanville handed Arabella therefore, with a great deal of Satisfaction, into the Pump-Room, which happened to be greatly crowded that Morning.  The Attention of most Part of the Company was immediately engaged by the Appearance Lady Bella made. Strangers are here most strictly criticized, and every new Object affords a delicious Feast of Raillery and Scandal.  The Ladies, alarmed at the Singularity of Arabella Dress, crowded together in Parties; and the Words, Who can Arabella be? Strange Creature! Ridiculous! and other Exclamations of the same Kind, were whispered very intelligibly.  The Men were struck with Arabella Figure, veiled as Arabella was: Arabella fine Stature, the beautiful Turn of Arabella Person, the Grace and Elegance of Arabella Motion, attracted all The Men Notice: The Phenomenon of the Veil, however, gave The Men great Disturbance. So lovely a Person seemed to promise the Owner had a Face not unworthy of a Face; but that was totally hid from The Men View: For Arabella, at Arabella Entrance into the Room, had pulled the Gauze quite over Arabella , following therein the Custom of the Ladies in Clelia, and the Grand Cyrus, who, in mixed Companies, always hid The Men Faces with great Care.  The Wits, and Pretty-Fellows, railed at the envious Covering, and compared Arabella to the Sun obscured by a Cloud; while the Beaux dem'd the horrid Innovation, and expressed a Fear, lest a Fear should grow into a Fashion.  Some of the wiser Sort took Arabella for a Foreigner; others, of still more Sagacity, supposed Arabella a Scots Lady, covered with Arabella Played; and a third Sort, infinitely wiser than either, concluded Arabella was a Spanish Nun, that had escaped from a Convent, and had not yet quitted Arabella Veil.  Arabella, ignorant of the Diversity of Opinions, to which Arabella Appearance gave Rise, was taken up in discoursing with Mr. Glanville upon the medicinal Virtue of the Springs, the Economy of the Baths, the Nature of the Diversions, and such other Topics, as the Objects around them furnished Arabella with.  In the mean time, Mr. Glanville Mr. Glanville was got amidst a Crowd of Arabella Acquaintance, who had hardly paid the Civilities of a first Meeting, before they eagerly inquired, who that Arabella Arabella brought with Arabella was.  Mr. Glanville Mr. Glanville informed they, that Arabella was Arabella Cousin, and Daughter to the deceased Marquis of -- adding with a Sneer, That Arabella had been brought up in the Country; knew nothing of the World; and had some very peculiar Notions, as you may see, said Arabella, by that odd kind of Covering Arabella wears.  Arabella Name and Quality were presently whispered all over the Room: The Men, hearing Arabella was a great Heiress, found greater Beauties to admire in Arabella Person: The Ladies, awed by the Sanction of Quality, dropped The Men, hearing she was a great Heiress Ridicule on Arabella Dress, and began to quote Examples of Whims full as inexcusable.  One remembered, that Lady J -- T -- alalways wore Lady J -- T -- alalways Ruffles reversed; that the Countess of -- went to Court in a Farthingale; that the Duchess of -- sat astride upon a Horse; and a certain Lady of great Fortune, and nearly allied to Quality, because Lady was not dignified with a Title, invented a new one for Lady; and directed Lady Servants to say in speaking to Lady, Your Honouress, which afterward became a Custom among all Lady Acquaintance; who mortally offended Lady, if Servants omitted that Instance of Respect.
