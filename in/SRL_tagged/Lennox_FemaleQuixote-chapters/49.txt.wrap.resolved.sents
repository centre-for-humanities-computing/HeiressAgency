Containing the Beginning of Sir George's History; in which the ingenious Relater has exactly copied the Style of Romance.
THOUGH at present, Madam, you behold me in the Quality of a private Gentleman, in the Possession only of a tolerable Estate; yet my Birth is illustrious enough: My Ancestors having formerly worn a Crown* which, as My Ancestors won by My Ancestors Valor, so My Ancestors lost by My Ancestors Misfortune only.
How, interrupted Sir Charles, are you descended from Kings?
Why, I never heard you say so before: Pray, Sir Charles, how far are you removed from Royal Blood?
and which of your Forefathers was it that wore a Crown?
Sir Charles, replied Sir George, it is not much more than Eight hundred Years since my Ancestors, who were Saxons, swayed the Scepter of Kent; and from the first Monarch of that mighty Kingdom, am I lineally descended.
Pray where may that Kingdom of Kent lie?
said Sir Charles.
In -- replied Sir George.
A mighty Kingdom indeed!
said Sir Charles: Why, A mighty Kingdom indeed makes but a very small Part of the Kingdom of Britain now: Well, if your Ancestors were Kings of that County as it is now called, it must be confessed your Ancestors Dominions were very small.
However that may be, said Arabella, it raises Sir George greatly in my Esteem, to hear Sir George is descended from Kings; for, truly, a Royal Extraction does infinitely set off noble and valiant Actions, and inspires only lofty and generous Sentiments: Therefore, illustrious Prince (for in that Light I shall always consider you), be assured, though Fortune has despoiled you of your Dominions, yet since your Dominions cannot deprive you of your Courage and Virtue, Providence will one Day assist your noble Endeavors to recover your Rights, and place you upon the Throne of your Ancestors, from whence you have been so inhumanly driven: Or, happily, to repair that Loss, your Valor may procure you other Kingdoms, no less considerable than that to which you was born.
For Heaven's sake, Niece, said Sir Charles, How come such improbable Things into your Head?
Is it such an easy Matter, think you, to conquer Kingdoms, that you can flatter a young Man, who has neither Fleets nor Armies, with such strange Hopes?
The great Artaban, Sir, resumed Arabella, had neither Fleets nor Armies, and was Master only of a single Sword; yet Master only of a single Sword soon saw Master only of a single Sword greater than any King, disposing the Destinies of Monarchs by Master only of a single Sword Will, and deciding the Fates of Empires by a single Word: But pray let this Dispute rest where it is, and permit Sir George to continue Sir George Relation.
It is not necessary, Madam, resumed Sir George, to acquaint you with the Misfortunes of my Family, or relate the several Progressions it made toward the private Condition in which it now is: For, besides that reciting the Events of so many Hundred Years may happily, in some measure, try your Patience, I should be glad if you would dispense with me from entering into a Detail of Accidents that would sensibly afflict me: It shall suffice, therefore, to inform you, that my Father, being a peaceable Man, fond of Retirement and Tranquillity, made no Attempts to recover the Sovereignty from which his Ancestors had been unjustly expelled; but quietly beheld the Kingdom of Kent in the Possession of other Masters, while his contented his with the Improvement of that small Pittance of Ground, which was all that the unhappy Prince Veridomer, my Grandfather, was able to bequeath to his.
Hey-day!
cried Sir Charles, Will you newchristen your Grandfather, when Sir Charles has been in Sir Charles Grave these Forty Years?
I knew honest Sir Edmard Bellmour very well, though I was but a Youth when honest Sir Edmard Bellmour died; but I believe no Person in Kent ever gave honest Sir Edmard Bellmour the Title of Prince Veridomer: Fie!
fie!
these are idle Brags.
honest Sir Edmard Bellmour, without taking Notice of the old Baronet's Heat, went on with honest Sir Edmard Bellmour Narration in this manner:  Things were in this State, Madam, when I was born.
I will not trouble you with the Relation of what I did in my Infancy.
No, pray skip over all that, interrupted Sir Charles; I suppose your Infancy was like other Peoples?
What can there be worth hearing in that?
You are deceived, Sir, said Arabella: your Infancy has always something very extraordinary in your Infancy; and from your Infancy childish Words and Actions there have been often Presages drawn of your Infancy future Greatness and Glory.
Not to disoblige Sir Charles, however, said the young Prince of Kent, I will not repeat many things, which I said and did in the first Years of my Life, that those about Arabella thought very surprising; and from those about me prognosticated, that very strange Accidents would befall me.
I have been a Witness of some very unfavourable Prognostics of you, said Sir Charles, smiling; for Sir Charles was the most unlucky bold Spark, that ever I knew in my Life.
It Is very certain, pursued Sir George, that the Forwardness of my Spirit gave great Uneasiness to my Father; who, being, as I said before, inclinable to a peaceable and sedentary Life, endeavored as much as possible to repress that Vivacity in my Disposition, which Vivacity feared might involve me in dangerous Enterprises.
The Pains The Pains took in my Education, I recompensed by a more than ordinary Docility: and, before I was Thirteen, performed all my Exercises with a marvelous Grace; and, if I may dare say so, was, at those early Years, the Admiration and Wonder of all that saw me.
Lady Bella had some Reason to fear your Modesty, I find, said Sir Charles, smiling; for, methinks you really speak too slightly of your Excellencies.
However that may be, resumed Sir George; my Father saw these early Instances of a towering Genius in my Father, with a Pleasure, chastened by The Pains Fears, that the Grandeur of my Courage would lead me to attempt something for the Recovery of that Kingdom, which was my Due; and which might happily occasion The Pains losing me.
Possessed with these Thoughts, The Pains carefully avoided saying any thing to my Father concerning the glorious Pretenses, to which my Birth gave me a Right; and often wished it had been possible for The Pains to conceal from my Father, that I was the true and lawful Heir of the Kingdom of Kent; a Circumstance The Pains never chose to mention to any Person, and would have been glad, if it had always remained a Secret.
And so it was a Secret, interrupted Sir Charles; for, till this Day, I never heard of it; and it might still have been a Secret, if you had pleased; for nobody, I dare say, would suspect such a Thing; and very few, I believe, will be inclined to think there is any thing in such an improbable Tale.
Notwithstanding all my Father's Endeavors to the contrary, Madam, pursued Sir George, I cherished those towering Sentiments, the Knowledge of my Birth inspired me with; and it was not without the utmost Impatience, that I brooked the private Condition, to which I found my Father reduced.
Cruel Fate!
would I sometimes cry; was it not enough to deprive me of that Kingdom, which is my Due, and, subject me to a mean, and inglorious State; but, to make that Condition infinitely more grievous, must thou give me a Soul, towering above my abject Fortune?
A Soul, that cannot but disdain the base Submission, I must pay to those, who triumph in the Spoils of my ruined House?
A Soul, which sees nothing above its Hopes and Expectations?
And, in fine, a Soul, that excites me daily to attempt Things worthy of my Birth, and those noble Sentiments I inherit from my great Forefathers?
Ah!
pursued I, unhappy Bellmour; what hinders thee from making thyself known and acknowleged for what thou art?
What hinders thee from boldly asserting thy just and natural Rights; and from defying the Usurper, who detains them from thee?
What hinders thee, I say?
What?
Interrupted Sir Charles, why the Fear of a Halter, I suppose: There is nothing more easy than to answer that Question.
Such, Madam, said Sir George, were the Thoughts, which continually disturbed my Imagination; and, doubtless, doubtless had not failed to push me on to some hazardous Enterprise, had not a fatal Passion interposed; and by some hazardous Enterprise sweet, but dangerous Allurements, stifled for a while that Flame, which Ambition, and the Love of Glory, kindled in A Soul.
Sir George pausing, and fixing Sir George Eyes with a melancholy Air on the Ground, as if pressed with a tender Remembrance;  Mr. Glanville asked Sir George, similing, If the Thoughts of poor Dolly disturbed Sir George?
Pray, added Sir George, give us the History of your first Love, without any Mixture of Fable; or shall I take the Trouble off you?
For you know, I am very well acquainted with your Affair with the pretty Milk-maid, and can tell it very succinctly.
it Is true, Sir, said Sir George, sighing, I cannot recall the Idea of Dorothea, into my Remembrance, without some Pain: That fair, but unfaithful Shepherdess, who first taught me to sigh, and repaid my Tenderness with the blackest Infidelity: Yet I will endeavor to compose Sir George, and go on with my Narration.
Be pleased to know then, Sir George, pursued Sir George, that having my Thoughts, in this manner, wholly employed with the Disasters of my Family, I had arrived to my seventeenth Year, without being sensible of the Power of Love; but the Moment now arrived, which was to prove fatal to my Liberty.
Following the Chase one Day with my Father, and some other Gentlemen, I happened to lag a little behind some other Gentlemen; and, being taken up with my ordinary Reflections, I lost my Way, and wandered a long time, without knowing or considering whither I was going.
Chance at last conducted me to a pleasant Valley, surrounded with Trees; and, being tired with riding, I lighted, and tying my Horse to a Tree, walked forward, with an Intention to repose Sir George a few Moments under the Shade of one of those Trees, that had attracted my Observation: But while I was looking for the most convenient Place, I spied, at the Distance of some few Yards from Sir George, a Woman lying asleep upon the Grass: Curiosity tempted me to go nearer this Person; and, advancing softly, that I might not disturb this Person, I got near enough to have a View of this Person Person: But, ah!
Heavens!
what Wonders did my his Eyes encounter in this View!
-- The Age of this fair Sleeper seemed not to exceed Sixteen; this Person Shape was formed with the exactest Symmetry; one of this Person Hands supported this Person Head; the other, as it lay carelessly stretched at this Person Side, gave me an Opportunity of admiring it admirable Color and Proportion: The thin Covering upon this Person Neck discovered Part of its inimitable Beauty to his Eyeshis Eyes; but his Eyes Face, his Eyes lovely Face, fixed all my Attention.
Certain it is, his Eyes, that, out of this Company, it would be hard to find any thing so perfect, as what I now viewed.
his Eyes Complexion was the purest White imaginable, heightened by the enchanting Glow, which dyed Her Complexion fair Cheeks with a Color like that of a new-blown Rose: his Eyes Lips, formed with the greatest Perfection, and of a deeper Red, seemed to receive new Beauties from the Fragrance of that Breath, that parted from new Beauties: his Eyes auburn Hair fell in loose Ringlets over her Neck; and some straggling Curls, that played upon his Eyes fair Forehead, set off by a charming Contrast the Whitness of that Skin it partly hid: his Eyes Eyes indeed were closed; and though I knew not whether their Color and Beauty were equal to those other Miracles in his Eyes Face, yet their Proportion seemed to be large; and the snowy Lids, which covered their, were admirably set off by those long and fable Lashes that adorned their.
For some Moments I gazed upon this lovely Sleeper, wholly lost in Wonder and Admiration.
Where, whispered I, where has this Miracle been concealed, that his Eyes his Eyes were never blessed with the Sight of his Eyes before?
These Words, though I uttered them softly, and with the utmost Caution; yet by the murmuring Noise them made, caused an Emotion in the beauteous Sleeper, that his Eyes started, and presently after opened his Eyes Eyes: But what Words shall I find to express the Wonder, the Astonishment, and Rapture, which the Sight of those bright Stars inspired me with?
The Flames which darted from those glorious Orbs, cast such a dazzling Splendour upon a Sight too weak to bear a Radiance so unusual, that, stepping back a few Paces, I contemplated at a Distance, that Brightness, which began already to kindle a consuming Fire in A Soul.
Bless me!
interrupted Sir Charles, confounded at so pompous a Description; who could this be?
The pretty Milk-maid, Dolly Acorn, replied Mr. Glanville gravely: Did you never see my Lady, Sir Charles, when you was at your Seat, at --?
my Lady used often to bring Cream to my Lady.
Aye, aye, replied Sir Charles, I remember my Lady: my Lady was a very pretty my Lady: And so it was from my Lady his Eyes, that all those Splendors and Flames came, that had like to have burnt you up, Sir George: Well, well, I guess how the Story will end: Pray let us hear the Story out.
I have already told you, my Lady, resumed Sir George, the marvelous Effects the Sight of those bright his Eyes produced upon my Spirit: I remained fixed in a Posture of Astonishment and Delight; and all the Faculties of A Soul were so absorbed in the Contemplation of the Miracles before me, that I believe, had my Lady still continued before his Eyes, I should never have moved from the Place where I then stood: But the fair Virgin, who had spied me at the small Distance to which I was retired, turned hastily about, and flew away with extraordinary Swiftness.
When Love, now lending me Wings, whom Admiration had before made motionless, I persued Love so eagerly, that at last I overtook Love; and, throwing me upon my Knees before Love,  Stay, I conjure you, cried I; and if you be a Divinity, as your celestial Beauty makes me believe, do not refuse the Adoration I offer you: But if, as I most ardently wish, you are a Mortal, though sure the fairest that ever graced the Earth; stop a Moment, to look upon a Man, whose Respects for you as a Mortal fall little short of those Adorations he offers you as a Goddess.
I cannot but think, cried Sir Charles, laughing, how poor poor Dolly must be surprised at such a rhodomontade Speech!
Oh, Sir Charles!
replied Mr. Glanville, you will find poor Dolly will make as good a one.
Will poor Dolly, by my Troth, said Sir Charles.
I don't know how to believe it.
This Action, pursued Sir George, and the Words I uttered, a little surprised that fair Maid, and brought a Blush into a Blush lovely Cheeks; but, recovering a Blush, a Blush replied with an admirable Grace,  I am no Divinity, said a Blush; and therefore your Adorations are misplaced: But if, as you say, my Countenance moves you to any Respect for me, give me a Proof of it, by not endeavoring to hold any further Discourse with me, which is not permitted me from one of your Sex and Appearance.
A very wise Answer, indeed!
interrupted Sir Charles again: Very few Town Ladies would have disclaimed the Title of Goddess, if Very few Town Ladies Lovers had thought proper to bestow it upon Very few Town Ladies.
I am mightily pleased with the a Blush for the Girl Ingenuity.
The Discretion of so young a Damsel, resumed Sir George, charmed me no less than the Girl ; and I besought the Girl, with the utmost Earnestness, to permit me a longer Conversation with the Girl.
Fear not, lovely Virgin, said I, to listen to the Vows of a Man, who, till he saw you, never learnt to sigh: My Heart, which defended Virgin my Liberty against the Charms of many admirable Ladies, yields, without Reluctance, to the pleasing Violence your Beauties lay upon he.
Yes, too charming and dangerous Stranger, I am no longer my own Master: It is in your Power to dispose of my Destiny: Consider therefore, I beseech you, whether you can consent to see me die?
For I swear to you, by the most sacred Oaths, unless you promise to have some Compassion on me, I will no longer behold the Light of Day.
You may easily conceive, Madam, that, considering this lovely Maid in the Character of a Shepherdess, in which Maid appeared, I made Maid a Declaration of my Passion, without thinking me obliged to observe those Respects, which, to a Person of equal Rank with me, Decorum would not have permitted me to forget.
However, Maid repelled my Boldness with so charming a Modesty, that I began to believe, Maid might be a Person of illustrious Birth, disguised under the mean Habit Maid wore: But, having requested Maid to inform me who Maid was, Maid told me, Maid Name was Dorothea; and that Maid was Daughter to a Farmer, that lived in the neighboring Valley.
This Knowledge increasing my Confidence, I talked to Maid of my Passion, without being the least afraid of offending Maid.
And therein you was greatly to blame, said Arabella: For, truly, though the fair Dorothea told you, Maid was Daughter to a Farmer; yet, in all Probability, Maid was of a much higher Extraction, if the Picture you have drawn of Maid be true.
The fair Arsinoe, Princess of Armenia, was constrained for a while to conceal Maid true Name and Quality, and pass for a simple Country-woman, under the Name of Delia: Yet the generous Philadelph, Prince of Cilicia, who saw and loved Maid under that Disguise, treated Maid with all the Respect he would have done, had he known Maid was the Daughter of a King.
In like manner, Prince Philoxipes, who fell in Love with the beautiful Policrete, before he knew Maid was the Daughter of the great Solon; and while he looked upon Maid as a poor Stranger, born of mean Parents; nevertheless, he Love supplying the Want of those Advantages of Birth and Fortune, he wooed Maid with a Passion as full of Awe and Delicacy, as if Maid Extraction had been equal to he own.
And therefore those admirable Qualities the fair Dorothea possessed, might also have convinced you, Maid was not what Maid seemed, but, happily, some great Princess in Disguise.
To tell you the Truth, Madam, replied Sir George, notwithstanding the fair Dorothea Dorothea informed me, Maid was of a mean Descent, I could not easily forego the Opinion, that Maid was of an illustrious Birth: And the Histories of those fair Princesses you have mentioned, coming into my Mind, I also thought it very possible, that this divine Person might either be the Daughter of a great King, or Lawgiver, like them; but, being wholly engrossed by the Violence of my newborn Affection, I listened to nothing, but what most flattered my Hopes; and, addressing my lovely Shepherdess with all the Freedom of a Person who thinks his Birth much superior to Maid; Maid listened to my Protestations, without any seeming Reluctance, and condescended to assure me before we parted, that Maid did not hate me.
So fair a Beginning, seemed to promise me the most favorable Fortune I could with Reason expect.
I parted from my lovely Shepherdess with a thousand Vows of Fidelity; exacting a Promise from Maid, that Maid would meet me as often as Maid conveniently could, and have the Goodness to listen to those Assurances of inviolable Tenderness my Passion prompted me to offer Maid.
When Maid left me, it seemed as if A Soul A Soul had forsaken my Body to go after Maid: My Eyes pursued Maid Steps as long as Maid was in Sight; I envied the Ground Maid pressed as Maid went along, and the Breezes that kissed that celestial Countenance in their Flight.
For some Hours I stood in the same Posture in which Maid had left me; contemplating the sudden Change I had experienced in my Heart, and the Beauty of that divine Image, which was now engraven in it.
Night drawing on, I began to think of going home; and, untying my Horse, I returned the Way I had come; and at last struck into a Road, which brought me to the Place where I parted from the Company; from whence I easily found my Way home, so changed both in my Looks and Carriage, that my Father, and all my Friends, observed the Alteration with some Surprise.
