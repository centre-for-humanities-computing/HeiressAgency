Contains the Conversation referred to in the last Chapter of the preceding Book.  MISS Glanville, who with a malicious Pleasure had secretly triumphed in the Extravagances her beautiful Cousin had been guilty of, was now sensibly disappointed to find MISS Glanville, who with a malicious Pleasure had secretly triumphed in the Extravagances had had so little Effect on her Father and Brother; for instead of reflecting upon the Absurdities to which MISS Glanville, who with a malicious Pleasure had secretly triumphed in the Extravagances had been a Witness, Mr. Glanville artfully pursued the Subject Arabella just before had been expatiating upon, taking notice frequently of some Observations of hers, and by a well contrived Repetition of hers Words, obliged Mr. Glanville Father a second Time to declare that Mr. Glanville Niece had spoken extremely well.  Mr. Glanville taking the Word, launched out into such Praises of his Niece Wit, that Miss Glanville, no longer able to listen patiently, replied,  'Twas true Lady Bella sometimes said very sensible Things; that 'twas a great Pity his Niece was not always in a reasonable Way of thinking, or that his Niece Intervals were not longer --  his Niece Intervals, Miss, said Mr. Glanville, pray what do you mean by that Expression? --  Why, pray, said Mr. GlanvilleMr. Glanville, don't you think my Cousin is sometimes a little wrong in the Head?  Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from my Cousin Chair, took a Turn across the Room in great Discomposure, then stopping all of a sudden, and giving my Cousin Sister a furious Look -- Charlotte, said my Cousin, don't give me Cause to think you are envious of your Cousin's superior Excellencies --  Envious, repeated Miss Glanville, I envious of my Cousin -- I vow I should never have thought of that -- Indeed, Brother, you are much mistaken; my Cousin's superior Excellencies never gave me a Moment's Disturbance -- Though I must confess his Sister unaccountable Whims have often excited my Pity --  No more of this, Charlotte, interrupted Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair, as you value my Friendship -- No more of No --  Why, really Son, said Sir Charles, my Niece has very strange Whimsies sometimes. How it came into my Niece Head to think Mr. Tinsel would attempt to carry my Niece away, I cannot imagine? For after all, Mr. Tinsel only pressed rather too rudely into my Niece Chamber, for which, as you see, I have ferbidden Mr. Tinsel Visits.  That was of a Piece, said Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair sneeringly to my Niece Brother, with my Niece asking you if you had made Mr. Tinsel swear upon your Sword, that Mr. Tinsel would never again attempt to carry my Niece away; and applauding you for having given Mr. Tinsel Mr. Tinsel Liberty, as the generous Atermens did on the same Occasion.  I would advise you, Charlotte, said Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair, not to aim at repeating your Cousins's Words, till you know how to pronounce your Cousins's Words properly.  Oh! that is one of her superior Excellencies, said Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair.  Indeed, Miss, said Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair very provokingly, Miss is superior to you in many Things; and as much so in the Goodness of Miss Heart, as in the Beauty of Miss Person --  Come, come, Charles, said the Baronet, who observed Charles Daughter sat swelling and biting his Daughter Lip at this Reproach, personal Reflections are better avoided. Miss is very well, and not to be disparaged; though to be sure, Lady Bella is the finest Woman I ever saw in my Life.  Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair was, if possible, more disgusted at Lady Bella Father's Palliation than Lady Bella Brother's Reproaches; and in order to give a Loose to Lady Bella Passion, accused Mr. Glanville of a Decrease in Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair Affection for Lady Bella, since Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair had been in Love with Lady Bella Cousin; and having found this Excuse for Lady Bella Tears, very freely gave vent to vent --  Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair being softened by this Sight, sacrificed a few Compliments to Lady Bella Vanity, which soon restored Lady Bella to Lady Bella usual Tranquillity; then turning the Discourse on Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair beloved Arabella, pronounced a Panegyric on Lady Bella Virtues and Accomplishments of an Hour long; which, if it did not absolutely persuade Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair Sister to change his Sister Opinion, it certainly convinced Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair Father, that Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair Niece was not only perfectly well in his Niece Understanding, but even better than most others of his Niece Sex.  Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair had just finished his Niece Eulogium, when his beloved Arabella appeared; Joy danced in Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair Eyes at his beloved Arabella Approach; Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair gazed upon his beloved Arabella with a Kind of conscious Triumph in Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair Looks; his beloved Arabella consummate Loveliness justifying Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair Passion, and being in Mr. Glanville at these Words starting from his Chair Opinion, more than an Excuse for all his beloved Arabella Extravagancies.
