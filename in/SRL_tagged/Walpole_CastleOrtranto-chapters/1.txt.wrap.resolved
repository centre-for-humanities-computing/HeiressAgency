MANFRED, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter: The latter a most beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called Matilda. Conrad, the son, was three years younger, a homely youth, sickly, and of no promising disposition; yet Conrad, the son was the darling of Conrad, the son father, who never showed any symptoms of affection to Matilda. Manfred had contracted a marriage for Manfred son with the Marquis of Vicenza's daughter, Isabella; and Isabella had already been delivered by Isabella guardians into the hands of Manfred, that Manfred might celebrate the wedding as soon as Conrad's infirm state of health would permit. Manfred's impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by Manfred family and neighbors. The former indeed, apprehending the severity of his family and neighbors Prince's disposition, did not dare to utter his family and neighbors surmises on this precipitation. Hippilita, Prince wife, an amiable lady, did sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying Hippilita, his wife, an amiable lady only son so early, considering Prince great youth, and greater infirmities, but Isabella never received any other answer than reflections on Isabella own sterility, who had given Prince but one heir. Prince tenants and subjects were less cautious in His tenants and subjects discourses: His tenants and subjects attributed the wedding to their Prince's dread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy, which was said to have pronounced, that the Castle and Lordship of Otranto should pass from the present family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it. It was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy; and still less easy to conceive what this prophecy had to do with the marriage in question. Yet these mysteries, or contradictions, did not make the populace adhere the less to the populace opinion.  Young Conrad's birthday was fixed for Young Conrad espousals. his espousals was assembled in the chapel of the Castle and Lordship of Otranto, and every thing ready for beginning the divine office, when Young Conrad was missing. Manfred impatient of the least delay, and who had not observed Young Conrad son retire, dispatched one of his son attendants to summon their Prince. The servant, who had not staid long enough to have crossed the court to Young Conrad's apartment, came running back breathless, in a frantic manner, The servant, who had not staid long enough to have crossed the court to Conrad's apartment eyes staring, and foaming at the mouth. The servant, who had not staid long enough to have crossed the court to Conrad's apartment said nothing, but pointed to the court. his espousals were struck with terror and amazement. The Princess Hippolita, without knowing what was the matter, but anxious for The Princess Hippolita , swooned away. Manfred, less apprehensive than enraged at the procrastination of the nuptials, and at the folly of his son domestic, asked imperiously, what was the matter? his son made no answer, but continued pointing toward the courtyard; and at last, after repeated questions put to his son, cried out, oh! The helmet! the helmet! In the mean time, some of his espousals had run into the court, from whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise. Manfred, who began to be alarmed at not seeing his son, went his to get information of what occasioned this strange confusion. Matilda remained endeavoring to assist Matilda mother, and Isabella staid for the same purpose, and to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom, for whom, in truth, Matilda had conceived little affection.  The first thing that struck Manfred's eyes was a groupe of Manfred servants endeavoring to raise something that appeared to Manfred a mountain of sable plumes. Manfred gazed without believing Manfred sight. What are Manfred doing? cried Manfred wrathfully; where is his son? A volly of voices replied, Oh! My Lord! The Prince! the Prince, the helmet! the helmet! shocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading his son knew not what; his son advanced hastily, -- but what a sight for a father's eyes! -- his son beheld his son child dashed to pieces, and almost buried under an enormous helmet, an hundred times more large than any casque ever made for human being, and shaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers.  The horror of the spectacle, the ignorance of all around how this misfortune had happened, and above all, the tremendous phenomenon before his son, took away The Prince's speech. Yet his son silence lasted longer than even grief could occasion. his son fixed his son eyes on what his son wished in vain to believe a vision; and seemed less attentive to his son loss, than buried in meditation on the stupendous object that had occasioned it. his son touched, his son examined the fatal casque, nor could even the bleeding mangled remains of The Prince, divert his eyes from the portent before Manfred. All who had known Manfred partial fondness for young Conrad, were as much surprised at All who had known his partial fondness for young Conrad 's insensibility, as thunderstruck All who had known his partial fondness for young Conrad at the miracle of the helmet. All who had known his partial fondness for young Conrad conveyed the disfigured corpse into the hall, without receiving the least direction from Manfred. As little was his son attentive to the Ladies who remained in the chapel: On the contrary, without mentioning the unhappy Princesses, his son wife and daughter, the first sounds that dropped from Manfred's lips were, take care of the lady Isabella.  The domestics, without observing the singularity of this direction, were guided by The domestics affection to The domestics mistress, to consider it as peculiarly addressed to their mistress situation, and flew to their mistress assistance. The domestics conveyed their mistress to their mistress chamber more dead than alive, and indifferent to all the strange circumstances their mistress heard, except the death of their mistress son. Matilda, who doated on their mistress mother, smothered their mistress own grief and amazement, and thought of nothing but assisting and comforting their mistress afflicted parent. Isabella, who had been treated by Hippolita like a daughter, and who returned that tenderness with equal duty and affection, was scarce less assiduous about the Princess; at the same time endeavoring to partake and lessen the weight of sorrow which the Princess saw Matilda strove to suppress, for whom the Princess had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship. Yet the Princess own situation could not help finding her own situation place in the Princess thoughts. the Princess felt no concern for the death of young Conrad, except commiseration; and the Princess was not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which had promised the Princess little felicity, either from the Princess destined bridegroom, or from the severe temper of Manfred, who, though he had distinguished the Princess by great indulgence, had imprinted the Princess mind with terror, from he causeless rigor to such amiable Princesses as Hippolita and Matilda.  While the Ladies were conveying the wretched mother to the Princess bed, Manfred remained in the court, gazing on the ominous casque, and regardless of the crowd which the strangeness of the event had now assembled around Manfred. The few words Manfred articulated, tended solely to inquiries, whether any man knew from whence it could have come? Nobody could give Manfred the least information. However, as it seemed to be the sole object of Manfred curiosity, it soon became so to the rest of the spectators, whose conjectures were as absurd and improbable, as the catastrophe itself was unprecedented. In the midst of their senseless guesses, a young peasant, whom rumor had drawn thither from a neighboring village, observed that the miraculous helmet was exactly like that on the figure in black marble of Alfonso the Good, one of their former Princes, in the church of St. Nicholas. Villain! What say thou! cried Manfred, starting from Manfred trance in a tempest of rage, and seizing the young man by the collar; how dare thou utter such treason? thy life shall pay for thy life. The spectators, who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince's fury as all the rest they had seen, were at a loss to unravel this new circumstance. The young peasant himself was still more astonished, not conceiving how The young peasant himself had offended the Prince: Yet recollecting The young peasant himself, with a mixture of grace and humility, The young peasant himself disengaged The young peasant himself from Manfred's gripe, and then with an obeisance, which discovered more jealousy of innocence, than dismay; The young peasant himself asked, with respect, of what The young peasant himself was guilty! Manfred, more enraged at the vigor, however decently exerted, with which the young man had shaken off the young man hold, than appeased by the young man submission, ordered the young man attendants to seize the young man, and, if the young man had not been withheld by the young man friends, whom the young man had invited to the nuptials, would have poignarded The young peasant himself in The young peasant himself arms.  During this altercation, some of the vulgar spectators had run to the great church, which stood near the castle, and came back open-mouthed, declaring, that the helmet was missing from Alfonso's statue. Manfred, at this news, grew perfectly frantic; and, as if the young man sought a subject on which to vent the tempest within the young man, the young man rushed again on The young peasant himself, crying, Villain! Monster! Sorcerer! it is thou have done this! it is thou have slain his son! The mob, who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities, on whom whom might discharge whom bewildered reasonings, caught, the words from the mouth of whom Lord, and re-ecchoed, ay, ay; it is he, it is he: he has stolen the helmet from good Alfonse's tomb, and dashed out the brains of the Prince with the helmet, -- never reflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the marble helmet that had been in the church, and that of steel before The mob, who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities, on whom they might discharge their bewildered reasonings, caught, the words from the mouth of their Lord, and re-ecchoed, ay, ay; it is he, it is he eyes; nor how impossible the disproportion was for a youth, seemingly not twenty, to weild a piece of armor of so prodigious a weight.  The folly of these ejaculations brought Manfred to Manfred: Yet whether provoked at The young peasant himself having observed the resemblance between the two helmets, and thereby led to the farther discovery of the absence of that in the church; or wishing to bury any fresh rumors under so impertinent a supposition; Manfred gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a necromancer, and that till the church could take cognizance of the affair; Manfred would have the Magician, whom they had thus detected, kept prisoner under the helmet itself, which Manfred ordered Manfred attendants to raise, and place the young man under it; declaring the young man should be kept there without food, with which the young man own infernal art might furnish the young man.  It was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous sentence: In vain did Manfred's friends endeavor to divert the young man from this savage and ill-grounded resolution. The generality were charmed with Manfred's friends 's decision, which, to Manfred's friends apprehensions, carried great appearance of justice, as the Magician was to be punished by the very instrument with which the Magician had offended: Nor were Manfred's friends struck with the least compunction at the probability of the youth being starved, for Manfred's friends firmly believed, that, by his diabolical skill, his could easily supply his with nutriment.  Manfred thus saw Manfred commands even cheerfully obeyed, and appointing a guard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to prisoner; Manfred dismissed Manfred friends and attendants, and retired to Manfred own chamber, after locking the gates of the castle, in which Manfred suffered none but Manfred domestics to remain.  In the mean time, the care and zeal of the Ladies had brought the Princess Hippolita to the Princess Hippolita, who amidst the transports of the Princess Hippolita own sorrow, frequently demanded news of the Princess Hippolita , would have dismissed the Princess Hippolita attendants to watch over their Lord, and at last enjoined Matilda to leave Matilda, and visit and comfort Matilda father. Matilda, who wanted no affectionate duty to Manfred, though Matilda trembled at her father austerity, obeyed the orders of Hippolita, whom Matilda tenderly recommended to Isabella; and enquiring of the domestics for her father, was informed that he was retired to he , and had commanded that nobody should have admittance to he. Concluding that he was immersed in sorrow for the death of Matilda brother, and fearing to renew he tears by the sight of he sole remaining child, Matilda hesitated whether Matilda should break in upon he affliction; yet solicitude for he, backed by the commands of Matilda mother, encouraged Matilda to venture disobeying the orders he had given, a fault Matilda had never been guilty of before. The gentle timidity of Matilda nature made Matilda pause for some minutes at he door. Matilda heard he traverse he backwards and forwards with disordered steps; a mood which increased Matilda apprehensions. Matilda was however just going to beg admittance, when Manfred suddenly opened his door; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the disorder of Manfred mind, Manfred did not distinguish the person, but asked angrily, who it was? Matilda replied trembling, my dearest father, it is I, your daughter. Manfred stepping back hastily, cried, Begone, I do not want a daughter; and flinging back abruptly, clapped his door.  a daughter was too well acquainted with a daughter 's impetuosity to venture a second intrusion. When a daughter had a little recovered the shock of so bitter a reception, a daughter wiped away a daughter to prevent the additional stab that the knowledge of it would give to Hippolita, who questioned a daughter in the most anxious terms on the health of Manfred, and how Manfred bore Manfred loss. Matilda assured Matilda Matilda was well, and supported Matilda misfortune with manly fortitude. But will Matilda not let me see Matilda? said the Princess Hippolita mornfully; will Matilda not permit me to blend his tears with Matilda, and shed a mother's sorrows in the bosom of their Lord? Or do you deceive me, Matilda? I know how Manfred doated on Manfred son: Is not the stroke too heavy for his son? has his son not sunk under the stroke? -- You do not answer me -- alas! I dread the worst! -- raise me, my maidens; I will, I will see their Lord. Bear me to his son instantly: his son is dearer to their Lord even than my children. Matilda made signs to Isabella to prevent the Princess Hippolita's rising; and both those lovely young women were using those lovely young women gentle violence to stop and calm the Princess, when a servant, on the part of Manfred, arrived and told Isabella that a servant demanded to speak with Isabella.  With their Lord! cried Isabella. Go, said Hippolita, relieved by a message from their Lord: Manfred cannot support the sight of Manfred own family. Manfred thinks you less disordered than we are, and dreads the shock of my grief. Console Manfred, Isabella, and tell Manfred I will smother my own anguish rather than add to Manfred.  As it was now evening, the servant, who conducted Isabella, bore a torch before Isabella. When they came to Manfred, who was walking impatiently about the gallery, Manfred started and said hastily take away that light, and begone. Then shutting his door impetuously, Manfred flung Manfred upon a bench against the wall, and bade Isabella fit by Manfred. Isabella obeyed trembling. I sent for you, Isabella, said Manfred, -- and then stopped under great appearance of confusion. their Lord! -- Yes, I sent for you on a matter of great moment, resumed Manfred, -- dry your tears, young Lady -- you have lost your bridegroom. -- Yes, cruel fate! and I have lost the hopes of my race! -- but Conrad was not worthy of your beauty -- how! their Lord, said Isabella; sure you do not suspect me of not feeling the concern I ought: My duty and affection would have always -- think no more of Conrad, interrupted Manfred; Conrad was a sickly puny child, and heaven has perhaps taken Conrad away, that I might not trust the honors of my house on so frail a foundation. The line of Manfred calls for numerous supports. My foolish fondness for Conrad blinded the eyes of my prudence -- but it is better as it is. I hope, in a few years, to have reason to rejoice at the death of Conrad.  Words cannot paint the astonishment of Isabella. At first Isabella apprehended that grief had disordered Manfred's understanding. Isabella next thought suggested that this strange discourse was designed to ensnare Isabella. Isabella feared that Manfred had perceived Isabella indifference for his son: And in consequence of that idea Isabella replied, Good my Lord, do not doubt my tenderness: My heart would have accompanied my hand. Conrad would have engrossed all my care; and wherever fate, shall dispose of Conrad, I shall always cherish Conrad memory, and regard your Highness and the virtuous Hippolita as my parents. Curse on Hippolita! cried Manfred: Forget Isabella from this moment as I do. In short, Isabella, you have missed a husband undeserving of your charms* They shall now be better disposed of. Instead of a sickly boy, you shall have a husband in the prime of a husband age, who will know how to value your beauties, and who may expect a numerous offspring. Alas! their Lord, said Isabella, my mind is too sadly engrossed by the recent catastrophe in your family to think of another marriage. If ever her father returns, and it shall be her father pleasure, I shall obey, as I did when I consented to give my hand to his son: But until his son return, permit me to remain under your hospitable roof, and employ the melancholy hours in asswaging yours, Hippolita's, and the fair Matilda's affliction.  I desired you once before, said Manfred angrily, not to name that woman: From this hour that woman must be a stranger to you, as that woman must be to me; -- in short, Isabella, since I cannot give you his son, I offer you me. -- Heavens! cried Isabella, waking from that woman delusion, what do I hear! You! their Lord! You! My father-in-law! My father-in-law! the husband of the virtuous and tender Hippolita! -- I tell you, said Manfred imperiously, Hippolita is no longer my wife, I divorce my wife from this hour. Too long has my wife cursed me by my wife unfruitfulness: My fate depends on having sons, -- and this night I trust will give a new date to my hopes. At those words Manfred imperiously seized the cold hand of Isabella, who was half-dead with fright and horror. my wife shrieked and started from Manfred imperiously. Manfred rose to pursue my wife, when the moon, which was now up and gleamed in at the opposite casement, presented to Manfred sight the plumes of the fatal helmet, which rose to the height of the windows, waving backwards and forwards in a tempestuous manner, and accompanied with a hollow and rustling sound. Isabella, who gathered courage from my wife situation, and who dreaded nothing so much as Manfred's pursuit of Manfred declaration, cried, Look! their Lord; see, heaven itself declares against your impious intention! -- Heaven nor hell shall impede my designs, said Manfred, advancing again to seize the Princess. At that instant the portrait of Manfred grandfather, which hung over the bench where they had been sitting, uttered a deep sigh, and heaved they breast. Isabella, whose back was turned to the picture, saw not the motion, nor knew whence the sound came, but started, and, said, Hark, my Lord! the sound was that? and at the same time made toward his door. Manfred, distracted between the flight of Isabella, who had now reached the stairs, and yet unable to keep his eyes from the picture which began to move, had however advanced some steps after the Princess, still looking backwards on the portrait, when his saw the portrait quit the portrait panel, and descend on the floor with a grave and melancholy air. Do I dream? cried Manfred returning, or are the devils themselves in league against his? speak, infernal spectre! or, if thou art my grandsire, why do thou too conspire against thy wretched descendent, who too dearly pays for -- ere his could finish the sentence, the vision sighed again, and made a sign to Manfred to follow his. Lead on! cried Manfred; I will follow thee to the gulf of perdition. The spectre marched sedately, but dejected, to the end of the gallery, and turned into a chamber on the right hand. Manfred accompanied him at a little distance, full of anxiety and horror, but resolved. As Manfred would have entered a chamber, his door was clapped to with violence by an invisible hand. The Prince, collecting courage from Delay, would have forcibly burst open his doorThe Prince , but found that his foot resisted The Prince utmost efforts. Since hell will not satisfy my curiosity, said Manfred, I will use the human means in my power for preserving my race; Isabella shall not escape me.  That Lady, whose resolution had given way to terror the moment Isabella had quitted Manfred, continued Isabella flight to the bottom of the principal staircase. There Isabella stopped, not knowing whither to direct Isabella steps, nor how to escape from the impetuosity of The Prince. The gates of the castle Isabella knew were locked, and guards placed in the court. Should Isabella, as Isabella heart prompted Isabella, go and prepare Hippolita for the cruel destiny that awaited Isabella; Isabella did not doubt but Manfred would seek Isabella there, and that Manfred violence would incite Manfred to double the injury Manfred meditated, without leaving room for them to avoid the impetuosity of Manfred passions. Delay might give Manfred time to reflect on the horrid measures Manfred had conceived, or produce some circumstance in Isabella favor, if Isabella could for that night at least avoid Manfred odious purpose. -- Yet where conceal Isabella! how avoid the pursuit Manfred would infallibly make throughout the castle! As these thoughts passed rapidly through Isabella mind, Isabella recollected a subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the church of St. Nicholas. Could Isabella reach the altar before Isabella was overtaken, Isabella knew even Manfred's violence would not dare to profane the sacredness of the place; and Isabella determined, if no other means of deliverance offered, to shut Isabella up for ever among the holy virgins, whose convent was contiguous to the cathedral. In this resolution, Isabella seized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase, and hurried toward a subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the church of St. Nicholas.  The lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate cloisters; and The lower part of the castle was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find the door that opened into the cavern. An awful silence reigned throughout those subterraneous regions, except now and then some blasts of wind that shook the doors Isabella had passed, and which grating on the rusty hinges, were reecchoed through that long labyrinth of darkness. Every murmur struck Isabella with new terror; -- yet more Isabella dreaded to hear the wrathful voice of Manfred urging Manfred domestics to pursue Isabella. Isabella trod as softly as impatience would give Isabella leave, -- yet frequently stopped and listened to hear if Isabella was followed. In one of those moments Isabella thought Isabella heard a sigh. Isabella shuddered, and recoiled a few paces. In a moment Isabella thought Isabella heard the step of some person. Isabella blood curdled; Isabella concluded Her blood was Manfred. Every suggestion that horror could inspire rushed into Isabella mind. Isabella condemned Isabella rash flight, which had thus exposed Isabella to his rage in a place where Isabella cries were not likely to draw any body to Isabella assistance. -- Yet the sound seemed not to come from behind, -- if Manfred knew where Isabella was, Manfred must have followed Isabella: Isabella was still in one of the cloisters, and the steps Isabella had heard were too distinct to proceed from the way Isabella had come. Cheared with this reflection, and hoping to find a friend in whoever was not The Prince; Isabella was going to advance, when a door that stood a jar, at some distance to the left, was opened gently: But ere Isabella lamp, which Isabella held up, could discover who opened it, the person retreated precipitately on seeing the light.  Isabella, whom every incident was sufficient to dismay, hesitated whether Isabella should proceed. Isabella dread of Manfred soon outweighed every other terror. The very circumstance of the person avoiding Isabella, gave Isabella a sort of courage. It could only be, Isabella thought, some domestic belonging to the castle. Isabella gentleness had never raised Isabella an enemy, and conscious innocence bade Isabella hope that, unless sent by The Prince's order to seek Isabella, The Prince servants would rather assist than prevent Isabella flight. Fortifying Isabella with these reflections, and believing by what Isabella could observe, that Isabella was near the mouth of the subterraneous cavern, Isabella approached the door that had been opened; but a sudden gust of wind that met Isabella at his door, extinguished Isabella lamp, and left Isabella in total darkness.  Words cannot paint the horror of the Princess's situation. Alone in so dismal a place, Isabella mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the day, hopeless of escaping, expecting every moment the arrival of Manfred, and far from tranquil on knowing Isabella was within reach of somebody, Isabella knew not whom, who for some cause seemed concealed thereabouts, all these thoughts crowded on Isabella distracted mind, and Isabella was ready to sink under Isabella apprehensions. Isabella addressed Isabella to every Saint in heaven, and inwardly implored their assistance. For a considerable time Isabella remained in an agony of despair. At last, as softly as was possible, Isabella felt for his door, and having found his door, entered trembling into the vault from whence Isabella had heard the sigh and steps. his door gave Isabella a kind of momentary joy to perceive an imperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the vault, which seemed to be fallen in, and from whence hung a fragment of earth or building, Isabella could not distinguish which, that appeared to have been crushed inwards. Isabella advanced eagerly toward this chasm, when Isabella discerned a human form standing close against the wall.  Isabella shrieked, believing it the ghost of Isabella betrothed Conrad. The figure advancing, said in a submissive voice, be not alarmed, Isabella; I will not injure you. Isabella a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the stranger, and recollecting that this must be the person who had opened his door, recovered Isabella spirits enough to reply, Sir, whoever you are, take pity on a wretched Princess, standing on the brink of destruction: Assist me to escape from the castle, or in few moments I may be made miserable for ever. Alas! said the stranger, what can I do to assist you? I will die in your defense; but I am unacquainted with the castle and want -- Oh! said Isabella, hastily interrupting Sir, help me but to find a trap-door that must be hereabout, and it is the greatest service you can do me, for I have not a minute to lose. Saying these words, Isabella felt about on the pavement, and directed the stranger to search likewise for a smooth piece of brass enclosed in one of the stones. That, said Isabella, is the lock, which opens with a spring, of which I know the secret. If we can find that, I may escape -- if not, alas! courteous stranger, I fear, I shall have involved you in my misfortunes: Manfred will suspect you for the accomplice of my flight, and you will fall a victim to a victim resentment. I value not my life, said the stranger, and it will be some comfort to lose the stranger, in trying to deliver you from a victim tyranny. Generous youth, said Isabella, how shall I ever requite -- as Isabella uttered those words, a ray of moonshine streaming through a cranny of the ruin above shone directly on the lock they sought -- Oh! transport! said Isabella, here is the trap-door! and taking out a key, Isabella touched the spring, which starting aside, discovered an iron ring. Lift up the trap-door, said the Princess. the stranger obeyed; and beneath appeared some stone steps descending into a vault totally dark. We must go down here, said Isabella: Follow me; dark and dismal as it is, We cannot miss We way; it leads directly to the church of St. Nicholas St. Nicholas -- but perhaps, added the Princess modestly, you have no reason to leave the castle, nor have I farther occasion for your service; in few minutes I shall be safe from Manfred's rage -- only let me know to whom I am so much obliged. I will never quit you, said the stranger eagerly, until I have placed you in safety -- nor think me, the Princess, more generous than I am; though you are my principal care -- the stranger was interrupted by a sudden noise of voices that seemed approaching, and voices soon distinguished these words: Talk not to me of necromancers; I tell you the Princess must be in the castle: I will find the Princess in spite of enchantment -- Oh! heavens, cried Isabella, it is the voice of Manfred! make haste or we are ruined! and shut the trap-door after Isabella. Saying this, the Princess descended the steps precipitately, and as the stranger hastened to follow the Princess, the stranger let the trap-door slip out of the stranger hands, the trap-door fell, and the spring closed over the trap-door. the stranger tried in vain to open the trap-door, not having observed Isabella's method of touching the spring: nor had the stranger many moments to make an essay. The noise of the trap-door had been heard by Manfred, who directed by the sound, hastened thither, attended by the stranger servants with torches. It must be Isabella; cried Manfred before Manfred entered the vault; Isabella is escaping by the subterraneous passage, but Isabella cannot have got far. -- What was the astonishment of The Prince, when, instead of Isabella, the light of his servants with torches discovered to The Prince the young peasant, whom The Prince thought confined under the fatal helmet: Traitor! said Manfred, how came thou here? I thought thee in durance above in the court. I am no traitor, replied the young man boldly, nor am I answerable for your thoughts. Presumptuous villain! cried Manfred, do thou provoke my wrath? tell me; how have thou escaped from above? thou have corrupted thy guards, and thou lives shall answer it. My poverty, said the peasant calmly, will disculpate the peasant: Though the ministers of a tyrant's wrath, to thee the peasant are faithful, and but too willing to execute the orders which you unjustly imposed upon the peasant. Art thou so hardy as to dare my vengeance? said The Prince -- but tortures shall force the truth from The Prince. Tell me, I will know thy accomplices. There was my accomplice! said the youth smiling, and pointing to the roof. Manfred ordered his servants with torches to be held up, and perceived that one of the cheeks of the enchanted casque had forced the enchanted casque way through the pavement of the court, as The Prince servants had let it fall over the peasant, and had broken through into the vault, (...) gap through which the peasant had (...) himself some minutes before himself was found by Isabella. Was that the way by which thou did descend? said Manfred. It was; said the youth. But what noise was that, said Manfred, which I heard as I entered the cloister? a door clapped: said the peasant; I heard it as well as you. a door clapped? said Manfred hastily. I am not acquainted with the castle; said the peasant; this is the first time I ever entered the castle; and this vault the only part of the castle within which I ever was. But I tell thee, said Manfred [wishing to find out if the youth had discovered the trap-door] it was this way I heard the noise: his servants with torches heard it too -- my Lord, interrupted one of his servants with torches officiously, to be sure it was the trap-door, and my Lord was going to make my Lord escape. Peace! blockhead, said The Prince angrily; if my Lord was going to escape, how should my Lord come on this side? I will know from my Lord own mouth what noise what noise was I heard. Tell me truly; thy life depends on thy veracity. thy veracity is dearer to The Prince than my life; said the peasant; nor would I purchase the one by forfeiting the other. Indeed! young philosopher! said Manfred; tell me then, what was the noise I heard? Ask me what I can answer, said Manfred, and put me to death instantly if I tell you a lie. Manfred growing impatient at the steady valor and indifference of the youth, cried, Well then, thou man of truth! answer; was it the fall of the trap-door that I heard? it was; said the youth. it was! said The Prince; and how did thou come to know there was a trap-door here? I saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine; replied The Prince. But what told The Prince it was a lock? said Manfred; How did thou discover the secret of opening it? Providence, that delivered me from the helmet, was able to direct me to the spring of a lock; said The Prince. Providence should have gone a little farther, and have placed thee out of the reach of my resentment, said Manfred: When Providence had taught thee to open a lock, a lock abandoned thee for a fool, who did not know how to make use of a lock favors. Why did thou not pursue the path pointed out for thy escape? Why did thou shut the trap-door before thou had descended the steps? I might ask you, my Lord, said the peasant, how I, totally unacquainted with the castle, was to know that the steps, led to any outlet? but I scorn to evade your questions. Wherever the steps lead to, perhaps I should have explored the way -- I could not be in a worse situation than I was. But the truth is, I let the trap-door fall: Your immediate arrival followed. I had given the alarm -- what imported it to me whether I was seized a minute sooner or a minute later? Thou art a resolute villain for thy years; said Manfred -- yet on reflection I suspect thou do but trifle with me: Thou have not yet told me how thou did open a lock. That I will show you, my Lord; said the peasant, and taking up a fragment of stone that had fall from above, Manfred laid Manfred on the trap-door, and began to beat on the piece of brass that covered it; meaning to gain time for the escape of the Princess. This presence of mind, joined to the frankness of the youth, staggered Manfred. Manfred even felt a disposition toward pardoning one who had been guilty of no crime. Manfred was not one of those savage tyrants who wanton in cruelty unprovoked. The circumstances of Manfred fortune had given an asperity to Manfred temper, which was naturally humane: and Manfred virtues were always ready to operate, when Manfred passions did not obscure Manfred reason.  While The Prince was in this suspense, a confused noise of voices ecchoed through the distant vaults. As the sound approached, The Prince distinguished the clamours of some of The Prince domestics, whom The Prince had dispersed through the castle in search of Isabella, calling out, where is my Lord? where is The Prince? Here I am; said Manfred, as they came nearer; have you found the Princess? the first that arrived, replied, oh! my Lord! I am glad we have found you -- found me! said Manfred; have you found the Princess! we thought we had, my Lord, said the fellow, looking terrified -- but -- but what? cried The Prince; has the Princess escaped! -- Jaquez and I, my Lord -- yes, I and Diego, interrupted the second, who came up in still greater consternation -- speak one of you at a time, said Manfred; I ask you where is the Princess? we do not know; said they both together; but we are frightened out of we wits -- so I think, blockheads, said Manfred; what is it has scared you thus? -- oh! my Lord, said Jaquez, Diego has seen such a sight! your Highness would not believe we eyes -- what new absurdity is this! cried Manfred -- give me a direct answer, or, by heaven -- why, my Lord, if it please your. your Highness to hear me, said the poor fellow; Diego and I -- yes I and Jaquez, cried the poor fellow comrade -- did not I forbid you to speak both at a time? said the Prince: You, Jaquez, answer for the other fool seems more distracted than thou art: What is the matter? my Lord, said Jaquez, if Jaquez please your Highness to hear me; Diego and I according to your Highness's orders went to search for the young Lady; but being apprehensive that Diego and I might meet the ghost of my young Lord, your Highness's son, God rest God soul, as God has not received christian burial -- sot! cried Manfred in a rage, is it only a ghost then that thou have seen? oh! worse! worse my Lord, cried Diego: I had rather have seen ten whole ghosts -- grant me patience! said Manfred; these blockheads distract me -- out of my sight, Diego! and thou, Jaquez, tell me in one word, art thou sober? art thou raving? Thou wast wont to have some sense: has sot frighted himself and thee too! speak; what is it himself fancies himself has seen? Why, my Lord, replied Jaquez trembling, I was going to tell your Highness, that since the calamitous mifortune of my young Lord, God rest God precious soul! not one of us your Highness's faithful servants, indeed us are, my Lord, though poor men; I say, not one of us has dared to set a foot about the castle, but two together: So Diego and I, thinking that the young Lady might be in the great gallery, went up there to look for the young Lady, and tell the young Lady your Highness wanted something to impart to the young Lady -- O blundering fools! cried Manfred: And in the mean time the young Lady has made the young Lady escape, because you were afraid of goblings! -- Why, thou knave! the young Lady left me in the great gallery; I came from thence myself. For all that, the young Lady may be there still for ought I know; said Jaquez; but the devil shall have me before I seek the young Lady there again! -- poor Diego! I do not believe Jaquez will ever recover it! recover what? said Manfred; am I never to learn what it is has terrified these rascals? -- but I lose my time; follow me, slave; I will see if the young Lady is in the great gallery -- for heaven's sake, my dear good Lord, cried Jaquez, do not go to the great gallery! Satan himself I believe is in the great chamber next to the great gallery -- Manfred, who hitherto had treated the terror of himself servants as an idle panic, was struck at this new circumstance. himself recollected the apparition of the portrait, and the sudden closing of the door at the end of the great gallery -- himself voice faltered, and himself asked with disorder what is in the great chamber next to the gallery? my Lord, said Jaquez, when Diego and I came into the great gallery, himself went first, for himself said himself had more courage than I. So when Diego and I came into the great gallery, Diego and I found nobody. Diego and I looked under every bench and stool; and still Diego and I found nobody -- were all the pictures in their places? said Manfred. Yes, my Lord, answered Jaquez; but Diego and I did not think of looking behind them -- well, well! said Manfred proceed. When Diego and I came to the door of the great chamber next to the gallery, Jaquez, Diego and I found the door of the great chamber shut -- and could not you open the door of the great chamber? said Manfred. Oh! yes, my Lord, would to heaven Diego and I had not! replied Manfred -- nay, it was not I neither, it was Diego: Manfred was grown foolhardy, and would go on, though I advised Manfred not -- if ever I open a door that is shut again -- trifle not, said Manfred shuddering, but tell me what you saw in the great chamber on opening the door -- I! my Lord! said Jaquez, I saw nothing; I was behind Diego; -- but I heard the noise -- Jaquez, said Manfred in a solemn tone of voice; tell me I adjure thee by the souls of my ancestors, what was it thou saw? what was it thou heardst? it was Diego saw it, my Lord, it was not I; replied Jaquez; I only heard the noise. Diego had no sooner opened the door, than my Lord cried out, and ran back -- I ran back too, and said, is it the ghost? the ghost! no, no, said Diego, and my Lord hair stood an end -- it is a giant I believe; my Lord is all clad in armor, for I saw my Lord foot and part of my Lord leg, and they are as large as the helmet below in the court. As my Lord said these words, my Lord, we heard a violent motion and the rattling of armor, as if a giant I believe was rising, for Diego has told me since, that my Lord believes a giant I believe was lying down, for the foot and leg were stretched at length on the floor. Before we could get to the end of the gallery, we heard the door of the great chamber clap behind we, but we did not dare turn back to see if a giant I believe was following we -- yet now I think on the giant was following us, we must have heard my Lord if my Lord had pursued we -- but for heaven's sake, good my Lord, send for the chaplain and have the castle exorcised, for, for certain, it is enchanted. Ay, pray do, my Lord, cried all the servants at once, or we must leave your Highness's service -- peace! dotards; said Manfred, and follow me; I will know what all this means. we! my Lord! cried they with one voice, we would not go up to the great gallery for your Highness's revenue. The young peasant, who had stood silent, now spoke. Will your Highess, said your Highess, permit me to try this adventure? my life is of consequence to nobody: I fear no bad angel, and have offended no good one. Your behavior is above your seeming, said Manfred, viewing Manfred with surprise and admiration -- hereafter I will reward your bravery -- but now, continued Manfred with a sigh, I am so circumstanced, that I dare trust no eyes but my own -- however, I give you leave to accompany me.  Manfred, when Manfred first followed Isabella from the great gallery, had gone directly to the apartment of Manfred wife, concluding the Princess had retired thither. Hippolita, who knew Manfred step, rose with anxious fondness to meet the Princess Lord, whom the Princess had not seen since the death of their son. the Princess would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief to their son bosom, but their son pushed the Princess rudely off, and said, Where is Isabella? Isabella! my Lord! said the astonished Hippolita. Yes; Isabella; cried Manfred imperiously; I want Isabella. my Lord, replied Matilda, who perceived how much their son behavior had shocked Isabella mother, Isabella has not been with us since your Highness summoned Isabella to your apartment. Tell me where Isabella is; said The Prince; I do not want to know where Isabella has been. my Lord, said the astonished Hippolita, Isabella tells you the truth: Isabella left us by your command, and has not returned since; -- but, my Lord, compose Isabella: Retire to your rest: This dismal day has disordered you. Isabella shall wait your orders in the morning. What then, you know where Isabella is! cried Manfred: Tell me directly, for I will not lose an instant -- and you, woman, speaking to his wife, order your chaplain to attend me forthwith. Isabella, said the astonished Hippolita calmly, is retired, I suppose to Isabella : Isabella is not accustomed to watch at this late hour. Gracious my Lord, continued Isabella, let me know what has disturbed you: Has Isabella, offended you? Trouble me not with questions, said Manfred, but tell me where Isabella is. Matilda shall call Isabella, said the Princess Sit down, my Lord, and resume your wonted fortitude. -- What, art thou jealous of Isabella, replied the Princess, that you wish to be present at us interview? Good heavens! my Lord, said the astonished Hippolita, what is it your Highness means? Thou will know ere many minutes are passed; said The Prince. Send your chaplain to The Prince, and wait my pleasure here. At these words he flung out of the room in search of Isabella; leaving the amazed Ladies thunderstruck with he words and frantic deportment, and lost in vain conjectures on what he was meditating.  Manfred was now returning from the vault, attended by the peasant and a few of Manfred servants whom Manfred had obliged to accompany Manfred. Manfred ascended the staircase, without stopping till Manfred arrived at the great gallery, at the door of which Manfred met the astonished Hippolita and your chaplain. When Diego had been dismissed by Manfred, Manfred had gone directly to the Princess's apartment with the alarm of what Manfred had seen. That excellent Lady, who no more than Manfred, doubted of the reality of the vision, yet affected to treat the vision as a delirium of the servant. Willing, however, to save my Lord from any additional shock, and prepared by a series of grief not to tremble at any accession to the vision; her determined to make her the first sacrifice, if fate had marked the present hour for fate destruction. Dismissing the reluctant Matilda to Matilda rest, who in vain sued for leave to accompany Matilda mother, and attended only by Matilda , the astonished Hippolita had visited the gallery and great chamber; and now with more serenity of soul than Matilda had felt for many hours, Matilda met Matilda , and assured my Lord that the vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable; and no doubt an impression made by fear, and the dark and dismal hour of the night on the minds of his servants. Matilda and the chaplain had examined great chamber, and found every thing in the usual order.  Manfred, though persuaded, like his wife, that the vision had been no work of fancy, recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which so many strange events had thrown my Lord. Ashamed too of my Lord inhuman treatment of a Princess, who returned every injury with new marks of tenderness and duty; my Lord felt returning love forcing love into my Lord eyes -- but not less ashamed of feeling remorse toward one, against whom my Lord was inwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage; my Lord curbed the yearnings of my Lord heart, and did not dare to lean even toward pity. The next transition of my Lord soul was to exquisite villainy. Presuming on the unshaken submission of the astonished Hippolita, my Lord flattered my Lord that the astonished Hippolita would not only acquiesce with patience to a divorce, but would obey if it was my Lord pleasure, in endeavoring to persuade Isabella to give my Lord Isabella hand -- but ere my Lord could indulge this horrid hope, my Lord reflected that Isabella was not to be found. Coming to my Lord, my Lord gave orders that every avenue to the castle should be strictly guarded, and charged my Lord domestics on pain of his domestics lives to suffer nobody to pass out. The young peasant, to whom my Lord spoke favorably, my Lord ordered to remain in a small chamber on the stairs, in which there was a pallet-bed, and the key of which my Lord took away my Lord, telling the youth my Lord would talk with my Lord in the morning. Then dismissing my Lord attendants, and bestowing a fullen kind of half-nod on the astonished Hippolita, my Lord retired to great chamber.
