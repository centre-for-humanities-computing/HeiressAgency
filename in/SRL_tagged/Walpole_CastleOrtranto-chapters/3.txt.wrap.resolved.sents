MANFRED's heart mis-gave MANFRED when MANFRED beheld the plumage on the miraculous casque shaken in concert with the sounding of the brazen trumpet.
Father!
said MANFRED to Jerome, whom MANFRED now ceased to treat as Count of Falconara, what mean these portents?
If I have offended -- the plumes were shaken with greater violence than before.
Unhappy Prince that I am!
cried Manfred -- Holy Father!
will you not assist me with your prayers?
My Lord, replied Jerome, heaven is no doubt displeased with your mockery of no servants.
Submit yourself to the church; and cease to persecute yourself ministers.
Dismiss this innocent youth: and learn to respect the holy character I wear: heaven will not be trifled with: you see -- the brazen trumpet sounded again.
I acknowledge I have been too hasty, said Manfred -- Holy Father.
Father, do you go to the wicket, and demand who is at the gate.
Do you grant me the life of Theodore?
replied the Friar.
I do, said Manfred -- Holy Father; but inquire who is without!
Jerome falling on the neck of Jerome son, discharged a flood of tears, that spoke the fullness of Jerome soul.
You promised to go to the gate; said Manfred -- Holy Father.
I thought replied the Friar, your Highness would excuse my thanking you first in this tribute of my heart.
Go, dearest Sir, said Theodore; obey the Prince: I do not deserve that you should delay the Prince satisfaction for the Prince.
Jerome, inquiring who was without, was answered a Herald.
From whom?
said Jerome.
From the Knight of the gigantic sabre; said a HeraldHerald; and I must speak with the usurper of Otranto.
Jerome returned to the Prince, and did not fail to repeat the message in the very words the message had been uttered.
The first sounds struck Manfred -- Holy Father with terror; but when Jerome heard Jerome styled usurper, Jerome rage rekindled, and all Jerome courage revived.
Usurper!
-- insolent villain!
cried he, who dares to question my title?
retire, Father; this is no business for Monks: I will meet Your Son.
Go to your convent, and prepare the Princess's return: Your Son shall be a hostage for your fidelity: Your Son life depends on your obedience.
Good heaven!
my Lord, cried Jerome, your Highness did but this instant freely pardon my child -- have you so soon forgot the interposition of heaven?
heaven, replied Manfred -- Holy Father, does not send Heralds to question the title of a lawful Prince -- I doubt whether the title of a lawful Prince even notifies the title of a lawful Prince will through Friars -- but that is your affair, not mine.
At present you know my pleasure; and my pleasure is not a saucy Herald, that shall save Your Son, if you do not return with the Princess.
It was in vain for the holy man to reply.
Manfred commanded the holy man to be conducted to the postern-gate, and shut out from the castle: And he ordered some of he attendants to carry Theodore to the top of the black tower, and guard Theodore strictly; scarce permitting the Father and son to exchange a hasty embrace at parting.
Theodore then withdrew to the hall, and seating Theodore in princely state, ordered Herald Herald to be admitted to Theodore presence.
Well!
thou insolent!
said the Prince, what would thou with the Prince!
I come, replied the Prince, to thee, Manfred, usurper of the principality of Otranto, from the renowned and invincible Knight, the Knight of the gigantic sabre: in the name of his Lord, Frederic Marquis of Vicenza, his demands the Lady Isabella, daughter of that Prince, whom thou have basely and traitorously got into thy power, by bribing thy false guardians during his absence: and his requires thee to resign the principality of Otranto, which thou have usurped from the said Lord Frederic, the nearest of blood to the last rightful Lord Alfonso the good.
If thou do not instantly comply with these just demands, his defies thee to single combat to the last extremity.
And so saying, the Herald cast down his warder.
And where is this braggart, who sends thee?
said Manfred.
At the distance of a league, said the Heraldthe Herald: his comes to make good his Lord's claim against thee, as his is a true Knight and thou an usurper and ravisher.
Injurious as this challenge was, Manfred reflected that it was not Manfred interest to provoke the Marquis.
Manfred knew how well-founded the claim of Frederic was; nor was this the first time Manfred had heard of this.
Frederic's ancestors had assumed the style of Princes of Otranto, from the death of Alfonso the good without issue; but Manfred, Alfonso Father, and grandfather, had been too powerful for the house of Vicenza to dispossess Frederic's ancestors.
Frederic, a martial and amorous young Prince, had married a beautiful young Lady, of whom he was enamoured, and who had died in childbed of Isabella.
Isabella affected he so much, that he had taken the cross and gone to the holy land, where he was wounded in an engagement against the infidels, made prisoner, and reported to be dead.
When the news reached Manfred's ears, Manfred bribed the guardians of the Lady Isabella to deliver the Lady Isabella up to Manfred as a bride for Conrad, by which alliance Manfred had proposed to unite the claims of the two houses.
This motive, on Conrad's death, had cooperated to make Conrad so suddenly resolve on espousing the Lady Isabella Conrad; and the same reflection determined Conrad now to endeavor at obtaining the consent of Frederic to this marriage.
A like policy inspired Conrad with the thought of inviting Frederic's champion into Frederic's champion castle, lest Frederic's champion should be informed of the Lady Isabella's flight, which Frederic's champion strictly enjoined Frederic's champion domestics not to disclose to any of the Knight's retinue.
Herald, said Manfred, as soon as Manfred had digested these reflections, return to thy master, and tell Manfred, ere we liquidate we differences by the sword, Manfred would hold some converse with Manfred.
Bid Manfred welcome to his castle, where by my faith, as I am a true Knight, Knight shall have courteous reception, and full security for Knight and followers.
If we cannot adjust we quarrel by amicable means, I swear Manfred shall depart in safety, and shall have full satisfaction according to the laws of arms: So help me God and Manfred holy Trinity!
Herald Herald made three obeissances and retired.
During this interview Jerome's mind was agitated by a thousand contrary passions.
Jerome trembled for the life of Jerome son, and Jerome first thought was to persuade Isabella to return to his castle.
Yet Jerome was scarce less alarmed at the thought of Isabella union with Manfred.
Jerome dreaded Hippolita's unbounded submission to the will of Isabella Lord; and though Jerome did not doubt but Jerome could alarm Isabella piety not to consent to a divorce, if Jerome could get access to Isabella; yet should Manfred discover that the obstruction came from Jerome, the obstruction might be equally fatal to Theodore.
Theodore was impatient to know whence came the Herald, who with so little management had questioned the title of Manfred: yet Theodore did not dare absent Theodore from the convent, lest Isabella should leave it, and Isabella flight be imputed to Theodore.
Theodore returned disconsolately to the monastery, uncertain on what conduct to resolve.
A Monk, who met Theodore in the porch and observed Theodore melancholy air, said, alas!
brother, is it then true that we have lost we excellent Princess Hippolita?
The holy man started, and cried, what meanest thou, brother!
I come this instant from the castle, and left Isabella in perfect health.
Martelli, replied the other Friar, passed by the convent but a quarter of an Hour ago on The holy man way from the castle, and reported that Isabella Highness was dead.
All our brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her Highness happy transit to a better life, and willed me to wait thy arrival.
All our brethren know thy holy attachment to that good Lady, and are anxious for the affliction it will cause in thee -- indeed our have all reason to weep; her Highness was a mother to our House -- but this life is but a pilgrimage; our must not murmur -- our shall all follow her Highness!
may our end be like here is!
good brother, thou dreamest, said Jerome: I tell thee I come from the castle, and left the Princess well -- where is the Lady Isabella?
-- poor Gentlewoman!
replied the Friar; I told the Lady Isabella the sad news, and offered the Lady Isabella spiritual comfort; I reminded the Lady Isabella of the transitory condition of mortality, and advised the Lady Isabella to take the veil: I quoted the example of the holy Princess Sanchia of Arragon -- thy zeal was laudable, said Jerome impatiently; but at present it was unnecessary: Hippolita is well -- at least I trust in the last rightful Lord Alfonso the good the Lady Isabella is; I heard nothing to the contrary -- yet methinks, the Prince's earnestness -- well, brother, but where is the Lady Isabella?
I know not, said the Friar: the Friar wept much, and said the Friar would retire to the Friar chamber.
Jerome left Jerome comrade abruptly, and hasted to the Princess, but the Friar was not in her chamber.
Jerome inquired of the domestics of the convent, but could learn the sad news.
Jerome searched in vain throughout the monastery and the church, and dispatched messengers round the neighborhood, to get intelligence if the Friar had been seen; but to no purpose.
nothing could equal the good man's perplexity.
Jerome judged that Isabella, suspecting Manfred of having precipitated Jerome wife's death, had taken the alarm, and withdrawn his wife to some more secret place of concealment.
This new flight would probably carry the Prince's fury to the height.
The report of Hippolita's death, though it seemed almost incredible, increased the Prince consternation; and though Isabella's escape bespoke Isabella aversion of Manfred for a husband, Jerome could feel no comfort from This new flight, while This new flight endangered the life of his sonhis son.
the Prince determined to return to his castle, and made several of the Prince brethren accompany the Prince to attest the Prince innocence to Manfred, and, if necessary, join his brethren intercession with the Prince for Theodore.
the Prince, in the mean time, had passed into the court, and ordered the gates of his castle to be flung open for the reception of the stranger Knight and Knight train.
In a few minutes the cavalcade arrived.
First came two harbingers with wands.
Next a herald, followed by two pages and two trumpets.
Then an hundred foot-guards.
These were attended by as many horse.
After These fifty footman, clothed in scarlet and black, the colors of Knight.
Then a led horse.
Two heralds on each side of a gentleman on horseback bearing a banner with the arms of Vicenza and Otranto quarterly -- a circumstance that much offended Manfred -- but Manfred stifled Manfred resentment.
Two more pages.
Knight's confessor telling The Knight's confessor beads.
Fifty more footmen, clad as before.
Two Knights habited in complete armor, Two Knights beavers down, comrades to Knight.
The squires of Two KnightsTwo Knights, carrying Two Knights shields and devices.
Knight's own squire.
An hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword, and seeming to faint under the weight of an enormous sword.
The Knight himself on a chestnut steed, in complete armor, his lance in the rest, his face entirely concealed by his vizor, which was surmounted by a large plume of scarlet and black feathers.
Fifty foot-guards with drums and trumpets closed the procession, which wheeled off to the right and left to make room for Knight.
As soon as he approached the gate, he stopped; and the herald advancing, read again the words of the challenge.
Manfred's eyes were fixed on an enormous sword, and Manfred scarce seemed to attend to the cartel: But Manfred attention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind Manfred.
Manfred turned and beheld the plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the same extraordinary manner as before.
It required intrepidity like Manfred's not to sink under a concurrence of circumstances that seemed to announce Manfred fate.
Yet scorning in the presence of strangers to betray the courage Manfred had always manifested, Manfred said boldly, Knight, whoever thou art, I bid thee welcome.
If thou art of mortal mould, thy valor shall meet thy valor equal: And, if thou art a true Knight, thou will scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy point.
Be these omens from heaven or hell, Manfred trusts to the righteousness of Manfred cause and to the aid of St. Nicholas, who has ever protected Manfred house.
Alight, Sir Knight, and repose thyself.
Tomorrow thou shall have a fair field; and heaven befriend the juster side!
Knight made no reply, but dismounting, was conducted by Manfred to the great hall of his castle.
As they traversed the court, Knight Knight stopped to gaze at the miraculous casque; and kneeling down, seemed to pray inwardly for some minutes.
Rising, Knight made a sign to the Prince to lead on.
As soon as they entered the great hall of the castle, Manfred proposed to the stranger to disarm, but Knight Knight shook Knight head in token of refusal.
Knight, said Manfred, this is not courteous; but by my good faith I will not cross thee; nor shall thou have cause to complain of the Prince of Otranto.
No treachery is designed on my part; I hope none is intended on thine: Here take my gage: [giving my gage my gage ring] your friends and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality.
Rest here, until refreshments are brought: I will but give orders for the accommodation of your train, and return to you.
Two Knights bowed as accepting my gage courtesy.
Manfred directed the stranger's retinue to be conducted to an adjacent hospital, founded by the Princess Hippolita for the reception of pilgrims.
As Two Knights made the circuit of the court to return toward the gate, an enormous sword burst from the supporters, and falling to the ground opposite to the helmet, remained immovable.
Manfred almost hardened to preternatural appearances, surmounted the shock of this new prodigy; and returning to the hall, where by this time the feast was ready, he invited he silent guests to take his silent guests places.
Manfred, however ill he heart was at ease, endeavored to inspire the company with mirth.
he put several questions to several questions, but was answered only by signs.
several questions raised several questions vizors but sufficiently to feed several questions, and that sparingly.
Sirs, said the Prince, the Prince are the first guests I ever treated within these walls, who scorned to hold any intercourse with the Prince: Nor has it often been customary, I ween, for Princes to hazard Princes state and dignity against strangers and mutes.
You say you come in the name of Frederic of Vicenza: I have ever heard that he was a gallant and courteous Knight; nor would he, I am bold to say, think it beneath he to mix in social converse with a Prince that is he equal, and not unknown by deeds in arms.
-- Still the Prince are silent -- well!
be it as it may -- by the laws of hospitality and chivalry ye are masters under this roof; Ye shall do your pleasures -- but come, give me a goblet of wine; Ye will not refuse to pledge me to the healths of your fair mistresses.
Knight sighed and crossed Knight, and was rising from the board -- Knight, said Manfred, what I said was but in sport: I shall constrain you in nothing: Use your good liking.
Since mirth is not your mood, let us be sad.
Business may hit your fancies better: Let us withdraw; and hear if what I have to unfold, may be better relished than the vain efforts I have made for your pastime.
Manfred then conducting Two Knights Knights into an inner chamber, shut the door, and inviting Two Knights to be seated, began thus, addressing Manfred then conducting the three Knights into an inner chamber to the chief personage.
You come, Knight, as I understand, in the name of the Marquis of Vicenza, to re-demand the Lady Isabella Knight daughter, who has been contracted in the face of holy church to my son, by the consent of her legal guardians; and to require me to resign my dominions to your Lord, who gives my dominions for the nearest of blood to Prince Alfonso, whose soul God rest!
I shall speak to the latter article of your demands first.
You must know, God knows, that I enjoy the principality of Otranto from my father Don Manuel, as he received it from Ricardo.
Alfonso, their predecessor, dying childless in the Holy Land, bequeathed Alfonso estates to my grandfather Don Ricardo, in consideration of Alfonso faithful services -- the stranger shook Alfonso head -- Sir Knight, said Manfred warmly, Ricardo was a valiant and upright man; Ricardo was a pious man, witness Ricardo munificent foundation of the adjoining church and two convents.
Ricardo was peculiarly patronized by St. Nicholas -- my grandfather was incapable -- I say, Ricardo, my grandfather Don Ricardo was incapable -- excuse me, your interruption has disordered me.
-- I venerate the memory of my grandfather -- well!
Sirs, my grandfather Don Ricardo held this estate; my grandfather Don Ricardo held this estate by my grandfather Don Ricardo good sword and by the favor of St. Nicholas -- so did Ricardo; and so, Sirs, will I, come what come will -- but Frederic, your Lord, is nearest in blood -- I have consented to put my title to the issue of his good sword -- does that imply a vicious title?
-- I might have asked, where is Frederic your Lord?
Report speaks Frederic your Lord dead in captivity.
You say, your actions say, Frederic your Lord lives -- I question your actions not -- I might, Sirs, I might -- but I do not.
Other Princes would bid Frederic your Lord take Other Princes inheritance by force, if Frederic your Lord can: Other Princes would not stake Other Princes dignity on a single combat: Other Princes would not submit a single combat to the decision of unknown mutes!
-- pardon me, Gentlemen, I am too warm: But suppose yourselves in my situation: As ye are stout Knights, would it not move your choler to have your own and the honor of your ancestors called in question?
-- but to the point.
ye require me to deliver up the Lady Isabella -- Sirs, I must ask if ye are authorized to receive the Lady Isabella -- Sirs?
Knight Knight nodded.
Receive the Lady Isabella -- Sirs -- Manfred then conducting the three Knights into an inner chamber; well!
you are authorized to receive the Lady Isabella -- Sirs -- but, KnightKnight, may I ask if you have full powers?
Knight Knight nodded.
It Is well: Said Manfred: Then hear what I have to offer -- ye see, Gentleman, before Gentleman the most unhappy of men!
[Gentleman began to weep] afford me your compassion; I am entitled to it: Indeed I am.
Gentleman, I have lost my only hope, my joy, the support of my house -- Conrad died yester morning.
Two Knights discovered signs of surprise.
Yes, Sirs, fate has disposed of my son.
the Lady Isabella -- Sirs is at liberty -- Do you then restore the Lady Isabella -- Sirs?
cried Knight, breaking silence.
Afford me your patience, said Manfred.
I rejoice to find, by this testimony of your good will, that this matter may be adjusted without blood.
It is no interest of mine dictates what little I have farther to say.
Ye behold in Ye a man disgusted with the world: The loss of my son has weaned me from earthly cares.
Power and greatness have no longer any charms in my eyes.
I wished to transmit the scepter I had received from my ancestors with honor to my son -- but that is ever!
Life itself is so indifferent to Ye, that I accepted your defiance with joy: Knight Knight cannot go to the grave with more satisfaction than when falling in Knight vocation.
Whatever is the will of heaven, I submit; for alas!
Sirs, I am a man of many sorrows.
Manfred is no object of envy -- but no doubt you are acquainted with my story.
Knight Knight made signs of ignorance, and seemed curious to have Manfred proceed.
Is it possible, Sirs, continued the Prince, that my story should be a secret to the Prince?
have you heard nothing relating to me and the Princess Hippolita?
They shook They heads -- no!
thus then, Sirs, it is.
You think me ambitious: Ambition alas!
is composed of more rugged materials.
If I were ambitious, I should not for so many years have been a prey to all the hell of conscientious scruples -- but I weary your patience: I will be brief.
Know then, that I have long been troubled in mind on my union with the Princess Hippolita.
-- Oh!
Sirs, if ye were acquainted with that excellent woman!
if ye knew that I adore that excellent woman like a mistress, and cherish that excellent woman as a friend -- but man was not born for perfect happiness!
that excellent woman shares my scruples, and with that excellent woman consent I have brought this matter before the church, for we are related within the forbidden degrees.
I expect every hour the definitive sentence that must separate we for ever -- I am sure you feel for that excellent woman -- I see you do -- pardon these tears!
Two Knights gazed on each other, wondering where this would end.
Manfred continued.
The death of my son betiding while my soul was under this anxiety, I thought of nothing but resigning my dominions, and retiring for ever from the sight of mankind.
My only difficulty was to fix on a successor, who would be tender of my people, and to dispose of the Lady Isabella, who is dear to me as my own blood.
I was willing to restore the line of Alfonso, even in Alfonso most distant kindred: And though, pardon me, I am satisfied it was Alfonso will that Ricardo's lineage should take place of Ricardo's lineage own relations; yet where was I to search for those relations?
I knew of none but Frederic your Lord; Frederic your Lord was a captive to the infidels or dead; and were Frederic your Lord living, and at home, would Frederic your Lord quit the flourishing state of Vicenza for the inconsiderable principality of Otranto?
If Frederic your Lord would not, could I bear the thought of seeing a hard unfeeling Viceroy set over my poor faithful people?
-- for, Sirs, I love my people, and thank heaven am beloved by my people -- but ye will ask, whither tends this long discourse?
briefly then, thus, Sirs.
Heaven in your arrival seems to point out a remedy for these difficulties and my misfortunes.
the Lady Isabella -- Sirs is at liberty; I shall soon be so -- I would submit to any thing for the good of my people -- were it not the best, the only way to extinguish the feuds between our families, if I was to take the Lady Isabella -- Sirs to wife -- you start -- but though Hippolita's virtues will ever be dear to me, a prince must not consider a prince; a prince is born for a prince people -- A servant at that instant entering the chamber apprized Manfred that Jerome and several of a prince brethren demanded immediate access to a prince.
The Prince, provoked at this interruption, and fearing that the Friar would discover to the strangers that the Lady Isabella -- Sirs had taken sanctuary, was going to forbid Jerome's entrance.
But recollecting that he was certainly arrived to notify the Princess's return, Manfred began to excuse Manfred to Two Knights for leaving Two Knights for a few moments, but was prevented by the arrival of the Friars.
Manfred angrily reprimanded Two Knights for Two Knights intrusion, and would have forced Two Knights back from the chamber; but Jerome was too much agitated to be repulsed.
Jerome declared aloud the flight of Isabella, with protestations of Jerome own innocence.
Manfred distracted at the news, and not less at the news coming to the knowledge of the strangers, uttered nothing but incoherent sentences, now upbraiding the Friar, now apologizing to Two Knights, earnest to know what was become of the Lady Isabella -- Sirs, yet equally afraid of Two Knights knowing, impatient to pursue the Lady Isabella -- Sirs, yet dreading to have Two Knights join in the pursuit.
Jerome offered to dispatch messengers in quest of the Lady Isabella -- Sirs, -- but the chief Knight no longer keeping silence, reproached Manfred in bitter terms for Manfred dark and ambigucus dealing, and demanded the cause of the Lady Isabella -- Sirs's first absence from the castle.
Manfred, casting a stern look at Jerome, implying a command of silence, pretended that on Conrad's death Conrad had placed the Lady Isabella -- Sirs in sanctuary until Conrad could determine how to dispose of the Lady Isabella -- Sirs.
Jerome, who trembled for his son's life, did not dare contradict this falsehood, but one of his son , not under the same anxiety, declared frankly that the Lady Isabella -- Sirs had fled to their church in the preceding night.
the Prince endeavored to stop this discovery, which overwhelmed the Prince with shame and confusion.
The principal stranger, amazed at the contradictions the Prince heard, and more than half persuaded that Manfred had secreted the Princess, notwithstanding the concern the Prince expressed at the Princess flight, rushing to the door, said, thou traitor-Prince!
the Lady Isabella -- Sirs shall be found.
Manfred endeavored to hold traitor-Prince, but Two Knights assisting Two Knights comrade, traitor-Prince broke from the Prince, and hastened into the court, demanding traitor-Prince attendants.
Manfred finding it vain to divert traitor-Prince from the pursuit, offered to accompany traitor-Prince; and summoning his attendants, and taking Jerome and some of the Friars to guide his attendants, his attendants issued from the castle; Manfred privately giving orders, to have the Knight's company secured, while to Knight Knight affected to dispatch a messenger to require his attendants assistance.
the Knight's company had no sooner quitted the castle, than Matilda, who felt herself deeply interested for the young peasant, since herself had seen traitor-Prince condemned to death in the hall, and whose thoughts had been taken up with concerting measures to save traitor-Prince, was informed by some of the female attendants that Manfred had dispatched all Manfred men various ways in pursuit of the Lady Isabella -- Sirs.
Manfred had in Manfred hurry given this order in general terms, not meaning to extend this order to the guard Manfred had set upon Theodore, but forgetting this order.
The domestics, officious to obey so peremptory a Prince, and urged by their own curiosity and love of novelty to join in any precipitate chase, had to a man left the castle.
Matilda disengaging herself from herself women, stole up to the black tower, and unbolting the door, presented Matilda disengaging herself from her women to the astonished Theodore.
a man left the castle, said Matilda disengaging herself from her women, though filial duty, and womanly modesty condemn the step I am taking, yet holy charity, surmounting all other ties, justifies this act.
Fly; the doors of thy prison are open: My father and thy prison domestics are absent; but My father and his domestics may soon return: Be gone in safety; and may the angels of heaven direct thy course!
Thou art surely one of the angels of heaven!
said the astonished Theodorethe astonished Theodore: None but a blessed saint could speak, could act -- could look like thee!
-- may I not know the name of my divine protectress!
methought thou namedst thy father: Is it possible!
can Manfred's blood feel holy pity?
-- lovely lady, thou answerest not -- but how art thou here thyself?
why do thou neglect thy own safety, and waste a thought on a wretch like the astonished Theodore?
let us fly together: The life thou bestowest shall be dedicated to thy defense.
Alas!
thou mistakest, said Matilda disengaging herself from her women sighing: I am Manfred's daughter, but no dangers await me.
Amazement!
said the astonished Theodore: But last night I blessed the astonished Theodore for yielding thee the service thy gracious compassion so charitably returns me now.
Still thou art in an error, said the Princess; but this is no time for explanation.
Fly, virtuous youth, while it is in my power to save thee: Should my father return, thou and I both should indeed have cause to tremble.
How!
said the astonished Theodore; think thou, charming maid, that I will accept of life at the hazard of aught calamitous to thee?
better I endured a thousand deaths, -- I run no risk, said Matilda disengaging herself from her women, but by Matilda disengaging herself from her women delay.
Depart; it cannot be known that I assisted thy flight.
Swear by the faints above, said the astonished Theodore, that thou can not be suspected; else here I vow to await whatever can befall me.
Oh!
thou art too generous, said Matilda disengaging herself from her women; but rest assured that no suspicion can alight on me.
Give me thy beauteous hand in token that thou do not deceive me, said the astonished Theodore; and let me bathe it with the warm tears of gratitude, -- forbear, said the Princessthe Princess; this must not be.
Alas!
said the astonished Theodore, I have never known but calamity until this hour -- perhaps shall never know other fortune again: Suffer the chaste raptures of holy gratitude: It Is my soul would print It effusions on thy hand.
Forbear, and be gone, said Matilda disengaging herself from her women: -- How would Isabella approve of seeing thee at my feet?
Who is the Lady Isabella -- Sirs?
said the young man with surprise.
Ah me!
I fear, said the Princess, I am serving a deceitful one!
-- have thou forgot thy curiosity this morning?
Thy looks, thy actions, all thy beauteous self seems an emanation of divinity, said the astonished Theodore, but thy words are dark and mysterious, -- speak, lady; speak to thy servant's comprehension.
-- Thou understandest but too well!
said Matilda disengaging herself from her women: But once more I command Matilda disengaging herself from her women to be gone: Thy blood, which, I may preserve, will be on my head, if I waste the time in vain discourse.
I go, lady, said the astonished Theodore, because it is thy will, and because I would not bring the gray hairs of my father with sorrow to the grave.
Say but, adored lady, that I have thy gentle pity.
-- Stay, said Matilda disengaging herself from her women; I will conduct Matilda disengaging herself from her women to the subterraneous vault by which Isabella escaped; the subterraneous vault by which Isabella escaped will lead Matilda disengaging herself from her women to the church of St. Nicholas, where thou may take sanctuary.
-- What!
said the astonished Theodore, was it another, and not thy lovely self that I assisted to find the subterraneous passage?
It was, said Matilda disengaging herself from her women; but ask no more: I tremble to see Matilda disengaging herself from her women still abide here: Fly to the sanctuary, -- to sanctuary!
said the astonished Theodore: No, the Princess, sanctuaries are for helpless damsels, or for criminals.
the astonished Theodore's soul is free from guilt, nor will wear the appearance of Theodore's soul.
Give me a sword, lady, and thy father shall learn that the astonished Theodore scorns an ignominious flight.
Rash youth!
said Matilda disengaging herself from her women, thou would not dare to lift thy presumptuous arm against the Prince of Otranto?
Not against my father; indeed I dare not, said the astonished Theodore: Excuse me, the Lady Isabella -- Sirs; I had forgotten, -- but could I gaze on thee, and remember thou art sprung from the tyrant Manfred?
-- but the tyrant Manfred is my father, and from this moment my injuries are buried in oblivion.
A deep and hollow groan, which seemed to come from above, startled the Princess and the astonished Theodore.
Good heaven!
we are overheard!
said the Princess.
the Princess and Theodore listened; but perceiving no farther noise, the Princess and Theodore concluded it the effect of pent-up vapors: And the Princess preceding the astonished Theodore softly, carried the Princess preceding Theodore softly to the Princess father's armory, where equipping the Princess preceding Theodore softly with a complete suit, the Princess preceding Theodore softly was conducted by Matilda disengaging herself from her women to the postern-gate.
Avoid the town, said the Princess, and all the western side of the castle: It Is there the search must be making by Manfred and the strangers: But hie thee to the opposite quarter.
Yonder behind that forest to the east is a chain of rocks, hollowed into a labyrinth of caverns that reach to the seacoast.
There thou may lie concealed, till thou can make signs to some vessel to put on shore and take thee off.
Go!
heaven be thy guide!
-- and sometimes in thy prayers remember -- Matilda disengaging herself from her women!
Theodore flung thy guide at Matilda disengaging herself from her women feet, and seizing Matilda disengaging herself from her women lily hand, which with struggles Matilda disengaging herself from her women suffered thy guide to kiss, thy guide vowed on the earliest opportunity to get thy guide knighted, and fervently entreated Matilda disengaging herself from her women permission to swear thy guide eternally Matilda disengaging herself from her women knight -- Ere the Princess could reply, a clap of thunder was suddenly heard, that shook the battlements.
Theodore, regardless of the tempest, would have urged thy guide suit; but the Princess and Theodore, retreated hastily into the castle, and commanded the youth to be gone with an air that would not be disobeyed.
thy guide sighed, and retired, but with eyes fixed on the gate, until Matilda disengaging herself from her women closing it, put an end to an interview, in which the hearts of both had drunk so deeply of a passion, which the hearts of both now tasted for the first time.
the astonished Theodore went pensively to the convent, to acquaint my father with the astonished Theodore deliverance.
There the astonished Theodore learned the absence of Jerome, and the pursuit that was making after the Lady Isabella, with some particulars of whose story the astonished Theodore now first became acquainted.
The generous galantry of the astonished Theodore nature prompted the astonished Theodore to wish to assist The generous galantry of his nature; but the Monks could lend the astonished Theodore no lights to guess at the route The generous galantry of his nature had taken.
the astonished Theodore was not tempted to wander far in search of The generous galantry of his nature, for the idea of Matilda disengaging herself from her women had imprinted the idea of Matilda so strongly on the astonished Theodore heart, that the astonished Theodore could not bear to absent the astonished Theodore at much distance from The generous galantry of his nature abode.
The tenderness Jerome had expressed for The tenderness Jerome concurred to confirm this reluctance; and The tenderness Jerome even persuaded The tenderness Jerome that filial affection was the chief cause of The tenderness Jerome hovering between the castle and monastery.
Until Jerome should return at night, the astonished Theodore at length determined to repair to the forest that Matilda disengaging herself from her women had pointed out to the astonished Theodore.
Arriving there, the astonished Theodore sought the gloomiest shades, as best suited to the pleasing melancholy that reigned in the astonished Theodore mind.
In this mood the astonished Theodore roved insensibly to the caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits, and were now reported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits.
the astonished Theodore recollected to have heard this tradition; and being of a brave and adventurous disposition, the astonished Theodore willingly indulged the astonished Theodore curiosity in exploring the secret recesses of this labyrinth.
the astonished Theodore had not penetrated far, before the astonished Theodore thought the astonished Theodore heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat before the astonished Theodore.
Theodore, though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be believed, had no apprehension that good men were abandoned without cause to the malice of the powers of darkness.
the astonished Theodore thought the place more likely to be infested by robbers than by those infernal agents who are reported to molest and bewilder travelers.
the astonished Theodore had long burned with impatience to approve the astonished Theodore valor -- drawing the astonished Theodore sabre, the astonished Theodore marched sedately onwards, still directing the astonished Theodore steps, as the imperfect rustling sound before the astonished Theodore led the way.
The armor the astonished Theodore wore was a like indication to the person who avoided the astonished Theodore.
Theodore now convinced that the astonished Theodore was not mistaken, redoubled the astonished Theodore pace, and evidently gained on the person that fled, whose haste increasing, the astonished Theodore came up just as a woman fell breathless before the astonished Theodore.
the astonished Theodore hasted to raise a woman, but a woman terror was so great, that the astonished Theodore apprehended a woman would faint in the astonished Theodore arms.
the astonished Theodore used every gentle word to dispel a woman alarms, and assured a woman that far from injuring, the astonished Theodore would defend a woman at the peril of the astonished Theodore life.
The lady recovering a woman spirits from the astonished Theodore courteous demeanor, and gazing on a woman protector, said, sure I have heard that voice before!
not to my knowledge, replied the astonished Theodore, unless as I conjecture thou art the Lady Isabella, -- merciful heaven!
cried a woman, thou art not sent in quest of me, art thou?
and saying those words, a woman threw a woman at her feet, and besought the astonished Theodore not to deliver a woman up to Manfred.
To Manfred!
cried the astonished Theodore -- no, lady, I have once already delivered thee from the astonished Theodore tyranny, and it shall fare hard with me now, but I will place thee out of the reach of the astonished Theodore daring.
Is it possible, said a woman, that thou should be the generous unknown, whom I met last night in the vault of the castle?
sure thou art not a mortal, but my guardian angel: On my knees let me thank -- hold, gentle Princess, said the astonished Theodore, nor demean thyself before a poor and friendless young man.
If heaven has selected me for thy deliverer, it will accomplish it work, and strengthen my arm in thy cause -- but come, the Lady Isabella -- Sirs, we are too near the mouth of the cavern; let we seek it inmost recesses: I can have no tranquillity till I have placed thee beyond the reach of danger.
Alas!
what mean you, Sir?
said the Lady Isabella -- Sirs.
Though all your actions are noble, though your sentiments speak the purity of your soul, is it fitting that I should accompany you alone into these perplexed retreats?
should we be found together, what would a censorious world think of my conduct?
I respect your virtuous delicacy, said the astonished Theodore; nor do you harbor a suspicion that wounds my honor.
I meant to conduct you into the most private cavity of these rocks, and then at the hazard of my life to guard their entrance against every living thing.
Besides, the Lady Isabella -- Sirs, continued he drawing a deep sigh, beauteous and all perfect as your form is, and though my wishes are not guiltless of aspiring, know, my soul is dedicated to another; and although -- a sudden noise prevented the astonished Theodore from proceeding.
They soon distinguished these sounds, the Lady Isabella!
what ho!
the Lady Isabella!
-- the Princess relapsed into the Princess former agony of fear.
Theodore endeavored to encourage the Princess, but in vain.
he assured the Princess he would die rather than suffer the Princess to return under Manfred's power; and begging the Princess to remain concealed, he went forth to prevent the person in search of the Princess from approaching.
At the mouth of the cavern the cavern he found an armed Knight, discoursing with a peasant, who assured he he had seen a lady enter the passes of the rock.
an armed Knight was preparing to seek a lady, when Theodore, placing an armed Knight in an armed Knight way, with an armed Knight sword drawn, sternly forbad an armed Knight at an armed Knight peril to advance.
And who art thou who dare to cross my way?
said an armed Knight an armed Knight haughtily.
One who does not dare more than an armed Knight will perform, said the astonished Theodore.
I seek the Lady Isabella, said an armed Knight, and understand the Lady Isabella has taken refuge among these rocks.
Impede me not, or thou will repent having provoked my resentment.
Thy purpose is as odious, as thy resentment is contemptible, said the astonished Theodore.
Return whence thou came, or we shall soon know whose resentment is most terrible.
The stranger, who was the principal Knight that had arrived from the marquis of Vicenza, had galloped from Manfred as Manfred was busied in getting information of the Princess, and giving various orders to prevent the Princess falling into the power of the three Knights.
Their chief had suspected Manfred of being privy to the Princess's absconding; and this insult from a man, who Their chief concluded was stationed by that Prince to secret the Princess, confirming Their chief suspicions, Their chief made no reply, but discharging a blow with Their chief sabre at the astonished Theodore, would soon have removed all obstruction, if Theodore, who took Their chief for one of Manfred's captains, and who had no sooner given the provocation than prepared to support the provocation, had not received the stroke on Their chief shield.
The valor that had so long been smothered in Their chief breast, broke forth at once; Their chief rushed impetuously on the Knight, whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives to hardy deeds.
The combat was furious, but not long: Theodore wounded an armed Knight in three several places, and at last disarmed an armed Knight as an armed Knight fainted with the loss of blood.
The peasant, who had fled at the first onset, had given the alarm to some of Manfred's domestics, who by his orders were dispersed through the forest in pursuit of the Lady Isabella.
some of Manfred's domestics, who by his orders were dispersed through the forest in pursuit of Isabella came up as an armed Knight fell, whom some of Manfred's domestics, who by his orders were dispersed through the forest in pursuit of Isabella soon discovered to be the noble stranger.
Theodore, notwithstanding Knight hatred to Manfred, could not behold the victory Knight had gained without emotions of pity and generosity: But Knight was more touched, when Knight learned the quality of Knight adversary, and was informed that Knight was no retainer, but an enemy of Manfred.
Knight assisted the servants of the latter in disarming an armed Knight, and in endeavoring to staunch the blood that flowed from Knight wounds.
an armed Knightan armed Knight an armed Knight , said in a faint and faltering voice, generous foe, we have both been in an error: I took thee for an instrument of the tyrant; I perceive thou have made the like mistake -- it is too late for excuses -- I faint -- if the Lady Isabella is at hand -- call the Lady Isabella -- I have important secrets to -- He is dying!
said one of the attendants; has nobody a crucifix about them?
Andrea, do thou pray over He -- fetch some water, said the astonished Theodore, and pour some water down the astonished Theodore throat, while I hasten to the Princess -- saying this, the astonished Theodore flew to Isabella, and in few words told the Princess modestly, that the astonished Theodore had been so unfortunate by mistake as to wound a gentleman from the Princess father's court, who wished ere the astonished Theodore died to impart something of consequence to the Princess.
The Princess, who had been transported at hearing the voice of the astonished Theodore as the astonished Theodore called to the Princess to come forth, was astonished at what the Princess heard.
Suffering the Princess to be conducted by the astonished Theodore, the new proof of whose valor recalled the Princess dispersed spirits, the Princess came where an armed Knight Knight lay speechless on the ground -- but the Princess fears returned, when the Princess beheld the domestics of Manfred.
the Princess would again have fled, if the astonished Theodore had not made the Princess observe that they were unarmed, and had not threatened they with instant death, if they should dare to seize the Princess.
The stranger, opening his eyes, and beholding a woman, said -- art thou -- pray tell me truly -- art thou Isabella of Vicenza?
I am, said the Princess: good heaven restore thee!
-- Then thou -- then thou -- said the Knight, struggling for utterance -- see -- thy father -- give me one -- oh!
amazement!
horror!
what do I hear!
what do I see!
cried the Lady Isabella.
My father!
you my father!
how came you here, Sir?
for heaven's sake speak!
-- oh!
run for help, or Sir will expire!
-- It Is most true, said the wounded Knight, exerting all Knight force; I am Frederic thy father -- yes, I came to deliver thee -- It will not be -- give me a parting kiss, and take -- Sir, said the astonished Theodore, do not exhaust yourself: suffer us to convey you to the castle -- to the castle!
said the Lady Isabella; is there no help nearer than the castle?
would you expose My father to the tyrant?
if My father goes thither, I dare not accompany My father -- and yet, can I leave My father!
my child, said Frederic, it matters not for me whither I am carried: A few minutes will place me beyond danger -- but while I have eyes to dote on thee, forsake me not, the Lady Isabella!
an armed Knight I know not who an armed Knight is, will protect thy innocence -- Sir, you will not abondon my child, will you!
Theodore shedding tears over Sir victim, and vowing to guard the Princess at the expense of Sir life, persuaded Frederic to suffer Frederic to be conducted to the castle.
They placed Frederic on a horse belonging to one of the domestics, after binding up Frederic as well as They were able.
Theodore marched by Theodore side; and the affected Isabella, who could not bear to quit Theodore, followed mournfully behind.
