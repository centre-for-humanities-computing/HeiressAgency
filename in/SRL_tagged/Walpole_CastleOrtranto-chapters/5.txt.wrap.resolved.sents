EVERY reflection which Manfred made on the Friar's behavior, conspired to persuade Manfred that Jerome was privy to an amor between Isabella and Theodore.
But Jerome's new presumption, so dissonant from Jerome former meekness, suggested still deeper apprehensions.
Jerome even suspected that the Friar the Friar depended on some secret support from Frederic, whose arrival coinciding with the novel appearance of Theodore seemed to bespeak a correspondence.
Still more was Jerome troubled with the resemblance of Theodore to Alfonso's portrait.
The latter Jerome knew had unquestionably died without issue.
Frederic had consented to bestow Isabella on Frederic.
These contradictions agitated Jerome mind with numberless pangs.
Jerome saw but two methods of extricating Jerome from Jerome difficulties.
The one was to resign Jerome dominions to the marquis -- Pride, ambition, and Jerome reliance on ancient prophecies, which had pointed out a possibility of Jerome preserving them to Jerome posterity combated that thought.
The other was to press Jerome marriage with Isabella.
After long ruminating on these anxious thoughts, as Jerome marched silently with Hippolita to the castle, Jerome at last discoursed with that princess on the subject of Jerome disquiet, and used every insinuating and plausible argument to extract her consent to, even her promise of promoting the divorce.
Hippolita needed little persuasion to bend Hippolita to Hippolita pleasure.
Hippolita endeavored to win Hippolita over to the measure of resigning Hippolita dominions; but finding Hippolita exhortations fruitless, Hippolita assured Hippolita, that as far as Hippolita conscience would allow, Hippolita would raise no opposition to a separation, though without better founded scruples than what Hippolita yet alleged, Hippolita would not engage to be active in demanding it.
This compliance, though inadequate, was sufficient to raise Manfred's hopes.
Hippolita trusted that Hippolita power and wealth would easily advance Hippolita suit at the court of Rome, whither Hippolita resolved to engage Frederic to take a journey on purpose.
Hippolita had discovered so much passion for Matilda, that Manfred hoped to obtain all Manfred wished by holding out or withdrawing Manfred daughter's charms, according as the Marquis should appear more or less disposed to cooperate in Manfred views.
Even the absence of Frederic would be a material point gained, until Frederic could take farther measures for Frederic security.
Dismissing Hippolita to Hippolita apartment, Frederic repaired to that of the Marquis; but crossing the great hall through which Frederic was to pass, Frederic met Bianca.
That damsel Frederic knew was in the confidence of both the young Ladies.
That damsel he knew immediately occured to Frederic to sift Bianca on the subject of Isabella and Theodore.
Calling Bianca aside into the recess of the oriel window of the hall, and soothing Bianca with many fair words and promises Frederic demanded of Bianca whether Bianca knew aught of the state of Isabella's affections.
I!
my Lord!
no, my Lord -- yes, my Lord -- poor Bianca!
Bianca is wonderfully alarmed about Bianca father's wounds; but I tell Bianca her father will do well, don't your Highness think so?
I do not ask you, replied Manfred, what Bianca thinks about her father: but you are in Bianca secrets: Come, be a good girl and tell me; is there any young man -- ha!
-- you understand me -- Lord bless me!
understand your Highness, no, not I: I told Bianca a few vulnerary herbs and repose -- I am not talking, replied her father impatiently, about her father: I know her father will do well -- Bless me, I rejoice to hear your Highness say so; for though I thought it not right to let my young Lady despond, methought her father Greatness had a wan look, and a something -- I remember when young Ferdinand was wounded by the Venetian -- Thou answerest from the point, interrupted replied Manfred; but here, take this jewel, perhaps that may fix thy attention -- nay, no reverences; my favor shall not stop here -- come, tell me truly; how stands Isabella's heart.
Well!
your Highness has such a way!
said Bianca -- to be sure -- but can your Highness keep a secret?
if a secret should ever come out of your lips -- a secret shall not, a secret shall not, cried replied Manfred nay, but swear, your Highness -- by my halidame if my halidame should ever be known that I said it -- why, truth is truth, I do not think my Lady Isabella ever much affectioned my young Lord your Son -- yet my young Lord your Son was a sweet youth as one should see -- I am sure if I had been a Princess -- but bless me!
I must attend my Lady Isabella; my Lady Isabella will marvel what is become of me -- stay; cried replied Manfred, thou have not satisfied my question.
Have thou ever carried any message, any letter -- I!
good gracious!
cried Bianca; I carry a letter --?
I would not to be a Queen.
I hope your Highness your Highness thinks though I am poor I am honest -- did your Highness your Highness never hear what Count Marsigli offered me, when Count Marsigli came a wooing to my Lady IsabellaLady Matilda?
I have not leisure, said replied Manfred, to listen to thy tales.
I do not question thy honesty: But it is thy duty to conceal nothing from me.
How long has my Lady Isabella been acquainted with Theodore?
Nay, there is nothing can escape your Highness!
said Bianca -- not that I know any thing of the matter -- Theodore, to be sure is a proper young man, and as my Lady Isabella Lady Matilda says, the very image of good Alfonso: Has not your Highness your Highness remarked it?
yes, yes, -- no -- thou torturest me, said replied Manfred: Where did they meet?
when?
-- who!
my Lady Isabella?
said Bianca --.
No, no, not Matilda; Isabella: when did my Lady Isabella first become acquainted with TheodoreTheodore?
Virgin Mary!
said Bianca --, how should I know?
Thou do know; said replied Manfred; and I must know; I will -- Lord!
your Highness is not jealous of Theodore!
said Bianca -- -- jealous!
no, no: Why should I be jealous?
-- perhaps I mean to unite them -- if I were sure my Lady Isabella would have no repugnance -- repugnance!
no, I Will warrant my Lady Isabella, said Bianca --; Theodore is as comely a youth as ever trod on Christian ground: We are all in love with Theodore, there is not a soul in the Castle but would be rejoiced to have Theodore for We Prince -- I mean, when it shall please heaven to call your Highness to it -- indeed!
said replied Manfred; has it gone so far!
oh!
this cursed Friar!
-- but I must not lose time -- go, Bianca --, attend my Lady Isabella; but I charge thee, not a word of what has passed.
Find out how Bianca -- is affected toward Theodore: bring me good news, and that ring has a companion.
Wait at the foot of the winding staircase: I am going to visit the Marquis, and will talk farther with thee at my return.
Manfred after some general conversation, desired Frederic to dismiss the two knights Frederic companions, having to talk with Frederic on urgent affairs.
As soon as the two knights were alone, Frederic began in artful guise to sound the Marquis the Marquis on the subject of Matilda; and finding Frederic disposed to Frederic wish Frederic let drop hints on the difficulties that would attend the celebration of the two knights marriage, unless -- at that instant Bianca -- burst into the room with a wildness in Bianca -- look and gestures that spoke the utmost terror.
Oh!
my Lord, my Lord!
cried Bianca --; we are all undone!
it is come again!
it is come again!
What is come again?
cried Manfred amazed -- oh!
the hand!
the Giant!
the hand!
-- support me!
I am terrified out of my senses, cried Bianca --, I will not sleep in the castle tonight; where shall I go?
my things may come after me tomorrow -- would I had been content to wed Francisco!
this comes of ambition!
What has terrified thee thus, young woman?
said the Marquis: Thou art safe here; be not alarmed.
Oh!
your greatness is wonderful good, said Bianca --, but I dare not -- no, pray let me go -- I had rather leave every thing behind me, than stay another hour under this roof.
Go to, thou have lost thy senses, said Manfred.
Interrupt we not; we were communing on important matters -- my Lord, this wench is subject to fits -- come with me Bianca -- -- oh!
the Saints!
no, said Bianca -- -- for certain it comes to warn your Highness; why should it appear to me else?
I say my hours morning and evening -- oh!
if your Highness had believed Diego!
It Is the same hand that your Highness saw the foot to in the gallery-chamber -- Jerome has often told we the prophesy would be out one of these days -- Bianca --, said your Highness, mark my words -- thou ravest; said Manfred in a rage; be gone, and keep these fooleries to frighten thy companions -- what!
my Lord, cried Bianca --, do you think I have seen nothing?
go to the foot of the great stairs yourself -- as I live I saw it.
Saw what?
tell we, fair maid, what thou have seen, said Frederic.
Can your Highness listen, said replied Manfred, to the delirium of a silly wench, who has heard stories of apparitions until your Highness believes stories of apparitions?
This is more than fancy, said the Marquis; the Marquis terror is too natural and too strongly impressed to be the work of imagination.
Tell we, fair maiden, what it is has moved thee thus.
Yes, my Lord, thank your Greatness, said Bianca -- I believe I look very pale; I shall be better when I have recovered the Marquis -- I was going to my Lady Isabella's chamber by his Highness's order -- we do want the circumstances; interrupted replied Manfred: Since his Highness will have it so, proceed; but be brief.
my Lord!
your Highness thwarts one so!
replied Bianca -- I fear my hair -- I am sure I never in my life -- well!
as I was telling your Greatness, I was going by his Highness's order to my Lady IsabellaLady Isabella's chamber: Lady Isabella's lies in the watchet-coloured chamber, on the right hand, one pair of stairs.
So when I came to the great stairs -- I was looking on his Highness's present here -- grant me patience!
said replied Manfred, will this wench never come to the point?
what imports it to the Marquis, that I gave thee a bawble for thy faithful attendance on my daughter?
we want to know what thou saw.
I was going to tell your Highness, said Bianca --, if you would permit me.
-- So as I was rubbing the ring -- I am sure I had not gone up three steps, but I heard the rattling of armor; for all the world such a clatter, as Diego says he heard when the Giant turned he about in the gallery-chamber -- what does Bianca -- mean, my Lord!
said the Marquis; is your castle haunted by Giants and goblins?
my Lord!
what, has not your Greatness heard the story of the Giant in the gallery-chamber?
cried Bianca --.
I marvel his Highness has not told you -- may hap you do not know there is a prophecy -- This trifling is intolerable; interrupted replied Manfred.
Let we dismiss this silly wench, my Lord?
we have more important affairs to discuss.
By your favor, said Frederic, these are no trifles: The enormous sabre I was directed to in the wood, yon casque, the wood fellow -- are these visions of this poor maiden's brain?
-- so Jaquez thinks, may Jaquez please your Greatness, said Bianca --.
Frederic says this moon will not be out without our seeing some strange revolution.
For my part I should not be surprised if it was to happen tomorrow; for, as I was saying, when I heard the clattering of armor, I was all in a cold sweat -- I looked up, and, if your Greatness will believe me, I saw upon the uppermost banister of the great stairs a hand in armor as big, as big -- I thought I should have swooned -- I never stopped until I came hither -- would I were well out of the castle!
my Lady Isabella told me but yester-morning that my Lady Isabella Highness Hippolita knows something -- Thou art an insolent!
cried Manfred -- Lord Marquis, it much misgives me that this scene is concerted to affront me.
Are my own domestics suborned to spread tales injurious to my honor?
Pursue your claim by manly daring; or let us bury us feuds, as was proposed, by the intermarriage of us children: But, trust me, it ill becomes a Prince of your bearing to practice on mercenary wenches -- I scorn your imputation; said Frederic: until this hour I never set eyes on this damsel: I have given this damsel no jewel!
-- my Lord, my Lord, your conscience, your guilt accuses you, and would throw the suspicion on me -- but keep my daughter, and think no more of my Lady Isabella: The judgments already fallen on your house forbid my matching into your house.
replied Manfred alarmed at the resolute tone in which Frederic delivered these words, endeavored to pacify him.
Dismissing Bianca --, Dismissing Bianca made such submissions to the Marquis, and threw in such artful encomiums on my Lady Isabella, that Frederic was once more staggered.
However, as Frederic passion was of so recent a date, it could not at once surmount the scruples Frederic had conceived.
Frederic had gathered enough from Bianca --'s discourse to persuade Frederic that heaven declared itself against replied Manfred.
The proposed marriages too removed Frederic claim to a distance; and the principality of Otranto was a stronger temptation, than the contingent reversion of the principality of Otranto with my Lady Isabella.
Still Frederic would not adsolutely recede from Frederic engagements; but purposing to gain time, Frederic demanded of replied Manfred, if it was true in fact that her Highness Hippolita consented to the divorce.
our Prince, transported to find no other obstacle, and depending on our Prince influence over our Prince wife, assured the Marquis the Marquis it was so, and that our Prince might satisfy our Prince of the truth from his wife own mouth.
As they were thus discoursing, word was brought that the banquet was prepared.
Manfred conducted Frederic to the great hall, where they were received by her Highness Hippolita and the young Princesses.
replied Manfred placed the Marquis next to my Lady Isabella, and seated replied Manfred between replied Manfred wife and Isabella.
her Highness Hippolita comported herself with an easy gravity; but the young Ladies were silent and melancholy.
Manfred, who was determined to pursue his point with the Marquis in the remainder of the evening, pushed on the feast until the feast waxed late; affecting unrestrained gaiety, and plying Frederic with repeated goblets of wine.
The latter, more upon his guard than replied Manfred wished, declined his frequent challenges, on pretense of his late loss of blood; while our Prince, to raise our Prince own disordered spirits, and to counterfeit unconcern, indulged our Prince in plentiful draughts, though not to the intoxication of our Prince senses.
The evening being far advanced, the banquet concluded.
Manfred would have withdrawn with Frederic; but the latter pleading weakness and want of repose, retired to the gallery-chamber, galantly telling our Prince, that Frederic daughter should amuse his Highness until his Highness could attend his Highness.
replied Manfred accepted the party, and to the no small grief of my Lady Isabella accompanied my Lady Isabella to my Lady Isabella apartment.
my Lady Isabella waited on my Lady Isabella mother to enjoy the freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the castle.
Soon as the company were dispersed their several ways, Frederic, quitting the gallery-chamber, enquired if Hippolita was alone, and was told by one of my Lady Isabella attendants, who had not noticed my Lady Isabella going forth, that at that hour my Lady Isabella generally withdrew to my Lady Isabella oratory, where Frederic probably would find my Lady Isabella.
the Marquis had beheld my Lady Isabella with increase of passion.
the Marquis now wished to find Hippolita in the disposition Hippolita Lord had promised.
The portents that had alarmed the Marquis, were forgotten in the Marquis desires.
Stealing softly and unobserved to her apartmentHippolita, the Marquis entered her apartment with a resolution to encourage her acquiescence to the divorce, having perceived that replied Manfred was resolved to make the possession of my Lady Isabella an unalterable condition, before replied Manfred would grant my Lady Isabella to replied Manfred wishes.
the Marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in her apartment.
Concluding my Lady Isabella, as the Marquis had been advertized, in my Lady Isabella oratory, the Marquis passed on.
The door was ajar; the evening gloomy and overcast.
Pushing open The door gently, the Marquis saw a person kneeling before the alter.
As the Marquis approached nearer, it seemed not a woman, but one in a long woollen weed, whose back was toward the Marquis.
a person seemed absorbed in prayer.
the Marquis the Marquis was about to return, when the figure rising, stood some moments fixed in meditation, without regarding the Marquis.
the Marquis, expecting a person to come forth, and meaning to excuse a person uncivil interruption, said, reverend Father, I sought the Lady Hippolita -- Hippolita!
replied a hollow voice?
came thou to the castle to seek Hippolita?
-- and then the figure, turning slowly round, discovered to Frederic the fleshless jaws and empty sockets of a skeleton, wrapped in a hermit's cowl.
Angels of grace, protect me!
cried Frederic recoiling.
Deserve their protection!
said the Spectre.
Frederic falling on Frederic knees, adjured the Phantom to take pity on Frederic.
Do thou not remember me?
said the apparition.
Remember the wood of Joppa!
Art thou that holy Hermit?
cried Frederic trembling -- can I do aught for thy eternal peace?
-- Wast thou delivered from bondage, said the spectre, to pursue carnal delights?
Have thou forgotten the buried sabre, and the behest of Heaven engraven on it?
-- I have not, I have not; said Frederic -- but say, blessed spirit, what is thy errand to me?
what remains to be done?
To forget my Lady Isabella!
said the apparition and vanished.
Frederic's blood froze in Frederic veins.
For some minutes Frederic remained motionless.
Then falling prostrate on Frederic face before the alter, Frederic besought the intercession of every saint for pardon.
A flood of tears succeeded to this transport; and the image of the beauteous my Lady Isabella rushing in spite of Frederic on Frederic thoughts, Frederic lay on the ground in a conflict of penitence and passion.
Ere Frederic could recover from this agony of Frederic spirits, the Princess Hippolita with a taper in the Princess Hippolita hand entered the oratory alone.
Seeing a man without motion on the floor, the Princess Hippolita gave a shriek, concluding a man dead.
the Princess Hippolita fright brought Frederic to Frederic.
Rising suddenly, his face bedewed with tears, Frederic would have rushed from the Princess Hippolita presence; but Hippolita stopping Frederic, conjured Frederic in the most plaintive accents to explain the cause of Frederic disorder, and by what strange chance the Princess Hippolita had found Frederic there in that posture.
Ah!
virtuous Princess!
said the Marquis, penetrated with grief -- and stopped.
For the love of Heaven, my Lord, said Hippolita, disclose the cause of this transport!
what mean these doleful sounds, this alarming exclamation on my name?
What woes has heaven still in store for HippolitaHippolita?
-- yet silent!
-- by every pitying angel, I adjure thee, noble Prince, continued the Princess Hippolita falling at noble Prince feet, to disclose the purport of what lies at thy heart -- I see thou feel for noble Prince; thou feel the sharp pangs that thou inflictest -- speak for pity!
-- does aught thou know concern my child?
-- I cannot speak; cried Frederic, bursting from the Princess Hippolita -- Oh!
Matilda!
Quitting the Princess thus abruptly, the Princess hastened to the Princess own apartment.
At the door of it the Princess was accosted by Manfred, who flushed by wine and love had come to seek the Princess, and to propose to waste some hours of the night in music and revelling.
Frederic, offended at an invitation so dissonant from the mood of Frederic soul, pushed Frederic rudely aside, and entering the gallery-chamber, flung the door of it intemperately against replied Manfred, and bolted the door of it inwards.
our Prince, enraged at this unaccountable behavior, withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most fatal excesses.
As our Prince crossed the court, our Prince was met by the domestic whom our Prince had planted at the convent as a spy on Jerome and Theodore.
This man, almost breathless with the haste our Prince had made, informed our Prince Lord, that Theodore and some lady from the castle were at that instant in private conference at the tomb of Alfonso in St. Nicholas's church.
our Prince had dogged Theodore thither, but the gloominess of the night had prevented our Prince discovering who the woman was.
Manfred, whose spirits were inflamed, and whom Isabella had driven from Isabella on our Prince urging our Prince passion with too little reserve, did not doubt but the inquietude Isabella had expressed, had been occasioned by Isabella impatience to meet Theodore.
Provoked by this conjecture, and enraged at Father, our Prince hastened secretly to St. Nicholas's church.
Gliding softly between the ailes, and guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine that shone faintly through the illuminated windows, our Prince stole toward the tomb of Alfonso, of the persons our Prince sought.
The first sounds to which our Prince was directed by indistinct whispers of the persons our Prince sought The first sounds our Prince could distinguish were -- Does it alas!
depend on our Prince?
replied Manfred will never permit our union -- No, this shall prevent this?
cried the tyrant, drawing the tyrant dagger, and plunging his dagger over Isabella shoulder into the bosom of the person that spoke -- ah!
me, I am slain!
cried my Lady Isabella sinking; good heaven, receive my soul!
Savage, inhuman monster!
what have thou done!
cried Theodore, rushing on Theodore, and wrenching his dagger from Theodore -- Stop, stop thy impious hand!
cried my Lady Isabella; it is Father!
Manfred waking as from a trance, beat Theodore breast twisted Theodore hands in Theodore locks, and endeavored to recover his dagger from Theodore to dispatch Theodore.
Theodore scarce less distracted, and only mastering the transports of Theodore grief to my Lady Isabella, had now by Theodore cries drawn some of the monks to Theodore aid.
While part of some of the monks endeavored in concert with the afflicted Theodore to stop the blood of the dying Princess, the rest prevented replied Manfred from laying violent hands on replied Manfred.
my Lady Isabella resigning my Lady Isabella patiently to my Lady Isabella fate, acknowledged with looks of grateful love the zeal of Theodore.
Yet often as my Lady Isabella faintness would permit my Lady Isabella speech her faintness way, my Lady Isabella begged the assistants to comfort Father.
Jerome by this time had learnt the fatal news, and reached St. Nicholas's church.
Jerome looks seemed to reproach Theodore: but turning to replied Manfred, Jerome said, now, tyrant!
behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious and devoted head!
the blood of the dying Princess cried to good heaven for vengeance; and good heaven has permitted the blood of the dying Princess altar to be polluted by assassination, that thou might shed thy own blood at the foot of that Prince's sepulcher!
-- Cruel man!
cried my Lady Isabella, to aggravate the woes of a parent!
may good heaven bless Father, and forgive Father as I do!
My lord, my gracious Sire, do thou forgive thy child?
indeed I came not hither to meet Theodore: I found Theodore praying at the tomb of Alfonso in St. Nicholas's church, whither her mother sent me to intercede for thee, for thee, bless your child and, say you forgive her mother -- forgive her mother!
murderous monster!
cried replied Manfred -- can assassins forgive?
I took her mother for Isabella; but good heaven directed my bloody hand to the heart of your child!
-- oh!
Matilda -- I cannot utter it -- can thou forgive the blindness of my rage!
I can, I do!
and may good heaven confirm it!
said my Lady Isabella -- but while I have life to ask it -- Oh!
her mother!
what will my Lady Isabella feel, will you comfort my Lady Isabella his Lord?
will you not put my Lady Isabella away?
indeed my Lady Isabella loves you -- oh!
I am faint!
bear me to the castle -- can I live to have my Lady Isabella close my eyes?
Theodore and the monks besought my Lady Isabella earnestly to suffer my Lady Isabella to be born into the convent; but my Lady Isabella instances were so pressing to be carried to the castle, that placing my Lady Isabella on a litter, Theodore and the monks conveyed my Lady Isabella thither as my Lady Isabella requested.
Theodore supporting my Lady Isabella head with Theodore arm, and hanging over my Lady Isabella in an agony of despairing love, still endeavored to inspire my Lady Isabella with hopes of life.
Jerome on the other side comforted my Lady Isabella with discourses of good heaven, and holding a crucifix before my Lady Isabella, which my Lady Isabella bathed with inocent tears, prepared my Lady Isabella for my Lady Isabella passage to immortality.
replied Manfred plunged in the deepest afflion, followed the litter in despair.
Ere they reached the castle, Hippolita, informed of the dreadful catastrophe, had flown to meet my Lady Isabella murdered child.
but when my Lady Isabella saw the afflicted procession the mightiness of my Lady Isabella grief deprived my Lady Isabella of my Lady Isabella senses, and my Lady Isabella fell lifeless to the earth in a swoon.
Isabella and Frederic, who attended my Lady Isabella, were overwhelmed in almost equal sorrow.
my Lady Isabella seemed insensible to my Lady Isabella own situation; every thought was lost in tenderness for her mother.
Ordering the litter to stop as soon as Hippolita was brought to my Lady Isabella my Lady Isabella asked for Father.
He approached, unable to speak.
my Lady Isabella seizing He hand and her mother's, locked Matilda seizing his hand and her mother in my Lady Isabella own, and then clasped Matilda seizing his hand and her mother to my Lady Isabella heart.
replied Manfred could not support this act of pathetic piety.
replied Manfred dashed replied Manfred on the ground, and cursed the day replied Manfred was born.
Isabella apprehensive that these struggles of passion were more than my Lady Isabella could support, took upon my Lady Isabella to order replied Manfred to be borne to replied Manfred apartment, while my Lady Isabella caused my Lady Isabella to be conveyed to the nearest chamber.
Hippolita, scarce more alive than Hippolita daughter, was regardless of every thing but her daughter: but when the tender Isabella's care would have likewise removed the tender Isabella, while the surgeons examined my Lady Isabella's wound, the tender Isabella cried, remove me!
never!
never!
I lived but in the tender Isabella, and will expire with the tender Isabella.
my Lady Isabella raised my Lady Isabella eyes at her mother's voice, but closed them again without speaking.
my Lady Isabella sinking pulse and the damp coldness of my Lady Isabella hand soon dispelled all hopes of recovery.
Theodore followed the surgeons into the nearest chamber and heard the surgeons pronounce the fatal sentence with a transport equal to frenzy -- Since my Lady Isabella cannot live mine, cried Theodore, at least my Lady Isabella shall be my Lady Isabella in death!
-- Father!
Jerome!
will you not join our hands?
cried Theodore to the Friar, who with the Marquis had accompanied the surgeons What means thy distracted rashness?
said Jerome; is this an hour for marriage!
It is, it is, cried Theodore, alas!
there is no other!
Young man, thou art too unadvised, said Frederic: do thou think we are to listen to thy fond transports in this hour of fate?
what pretensions have thou to the Princess?
Those of a Prince, said Theodore; of the sovereign of Otranto.
This reverend man, my father, has informed me who I am.
Thou ravest, said the Marquis: there is no prince of Otranto but myself, now Manfred by murder, by sacrilegious murder, has forfeited all pretensions.
his Lord, said Jerome, assuming an air of command, Jerome tells you true.
It was not my purpose the secret should have been divulged so soon; but fate presses onward to my purpose work.
What Jerome hot headed passion has revealed, my tongue confirms.
Know, Prince, that when Alfonso set sail for the Holy Land -- is this a season for explanations?
cried Theodore.
Father, come and unite me to the Princess; the Princess shall be the Princess -- in every other thing I will dutifully obey you.
My life!
my Lady Isabellamy Lady Isabella!
continued Theodore, rushing back into the nearest chamber, will you not be mine?
will you not bless your -- Isabella made signs to Theodore to be silent, apprehending the Princess was near the Princess end.
What is the Princess dead?
cried Theodore, is it possible?
The violence of Theodore exclamations brought my Lady Isabella to my Lady Isabella.
Lifting up my Lady Isabella eyes, my Lady Isabella looked round for my Lady Isabella mother -- Life of my soul!
I am here, cried Hippolita; think not I will quit my Lady Isabella!
Oh!
you are too good; said my Lady Isabella -- but weep not for me, my mother!
I am going where sorrow never dwells -- Isabella thou have loved me; wot thou not supply my fondness to this dear, dear woman?
-- indeed I am faint!
Oh!
my child!
my child!
said Hippolita in a flood of tears, can I not withhold my Lady Isabella a moment!
-- It will not be; said my Lady Isabella -- commend me to heaven -- where is Father?
forgive him, dearest mother -- forgive him my death; it was an error -- Oh!
I had forgotten -- dearest mother, I vowed never to see Theodore more -- perhaps that has drawn down this calamity -- but it was not intentional -- can you pardon me?
-- Oh!
wound not my agonizing soul!
said Hippolita; thou never could offend me -- alas!
my Lady Isabella faints!
help!
help!
-- I would say something more, said my Lady Isabella struggling, but it wonnot be -- Isabella -- Theodore -- for my sake -- Oh!
-- my Lady Isabella expired.
Isabella and Isabella women tore Hippolita from the corse; but Theodore threatened destruction to all who attempted to remove Theodore from it.
Theodore printed a thousand kisses on her clay-cold hands, and uttered every expression that despairing love could dictate.
Isabella, in the mean time, was accompanying Hippolita Hippolita to Isabella apartment; but, in the middle of the court, they were met by Manfred, who, distracted with Theodore own thoughts, and anxious once more to behold Theodore daughter, was advancing to the nearest chamber.
As the moon was now at the moon height, Theodore read in the countenance of this unhappy company the event Theodore dreaded.
What!
is Isabella dead!
cried Theodore in wild confusion -- a clap of thunder at that instant shook the castle to the castle foundations; the earth rocked, and the clank of more than mortal armor was heard behind.
Frederic and Jerome thought the last day was at hand.
The latter, forcing Theodore along with Frederic and Jerome, rushed into the court.
The moment Theodore appeared, the walls of the castle were thrown down with a mighty force, and the form of Alfonso, dilated to an immense magnitude, appeared in the center of the ruins.
Behold in Theodore the true heir of Alfonso!
said the vision: And having pronounced those words, accompanied by a clap of thunder, the vision ascended solemnly toward heaven, where the clouds parting asunder, the form of St. Nicholas was seen, and receiving Alfonso's shade, they were soon wrapped from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.
The beholders fell prostrate on they faces, acknowledging the divine will.
The first that broke silence was Hippolita.
his Lord, said Hippolita to the desponding Manfred, behold the vanity of human greatness!
Conrad is gone!
my Lady Isabella is no more!
in Theodore we view the true Prince of Otranto.
By what miracle he is so, I know not -- suffice it to we, we doom is pronounced!
shall we not, can we but dedicate the few deplorable hours we have to live, in deprecating the farther wrath of good heaven?
good heaven ejects we -- whither can we fly, but to you holy cells that yet offer we a retreat?
-- Thou guiltless but unhappy woman!
unhappy by my crimes!
replied Manfred, my heart at last is open to thy devout admonitions.
Oh!
could -- but it cannot be -- ye are lost in wonder -- let me at last do justice on ye!
To heap shame on my own head is all the satisfaction I have left to offer to offended heaven.
My story has drawn down these judgments: Let my confession atone -- but ah!
what can atone for usurpation and a murdered child!
a child murdered in a consecrated place!
-- List, Sirs, and may this bloody record be a warning to future tyrants!
Alfonso, ye all know, died in the Holy Land -- ye would interrupt me; ye would say Alfonso came not fairly to Alfonso end -- it is most true -- why else this bitter cup which replied Manfred must drink to the dregs?
Ricardo, my grandfather, was Ricardo chamberlain -- I would draw a veil over my ancestor's crimes -- but it is in vain!
Alfonso died by poison.
A fictitious will declared Ricardo Alfonso heir.
my ancestor's crimes pursued Ricardo -- yet Ricardo lost no Conrad, no Matilda!
I pay the price of usurpation for all!
A storm overtook Ricardo.
Haunted by Ricardo guilt, Ricardo vowed to St. Nicholas to found a church and two convents, if Ricardo lived to reach Otranto.
The sacrifice was accepted: the saint appeared to Ricardo in a dream, and promised that Ricardo's posterity should reign in Otranto, until the rightful owner should be grown too large to inhabit the castle, and as long as issue-male from Ricardo's loins should remain to enjoy it -- Alas!
alas!
nor male nor female, except Ricardo, remains of all Ricardo wretched race!
-- I have done -- the woes of these three days speak the rest.
How Ricardo can be Alfonso's heir, I know not -- yet I do not doubt it.
Ricardo are these dominions; I resign these dominions -- yet I knew not Alfonso had an heir -- I question not the will of heaven -- poverty and prayer must fill up the woeful space, until replied Manfred shall be summoned to Ricardo.
What remains, is my part to declare, said Jerome.
When Alfonso set sail for the Holy Land, Alfonso was driven by a storm to the coast of Sicily.
The other vessel, which bore Ricardo and Alfonso train, as your Lordship must have heard, was separated from Alfonso.
It is most true, said replied Manfred; and the title you give me is more than an outcast can claim -- well!
be it so -- proceed.
Jerome, blushed, and continued.
For three months Alfonso was wind-bound in Sicily.
There Alfonso became enamoured of a fair virgin named Victoria.
Alfonso was too pious to tempt a fair virgin named Victoria to forbidden pleasures.
They were married.
Yet deeming this amor incongruous with the holy vow of arms by which this amor was bound, this amor determined to conceal They nuptials, until this amor return from the Crusado, when this amor purposed to seek and acknowledge a fair virgin named Victoria for this amor lawful wife.
this amor left a fair virgin named Victoria pregnant.
