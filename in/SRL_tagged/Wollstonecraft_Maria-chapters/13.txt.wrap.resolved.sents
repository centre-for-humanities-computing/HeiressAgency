 "BY WATCHING my only visitor, my uncle's friend, or by some other means, Mr.  Venables discovered my residence, and came to enquire for Mr.  Venables.
The maid-servant  assured Mr.  Venables there was no such person in the house.
A bustle ensued—I caught  the alarm—listened—distinguished Mr.  Venables voice, and immediately locked the  door.
They suddenly grew still; and I waited near a quarter of an hour, before  I heard Mr.  Venables open the  door, and mount the stairs with the mistress of  the house, who obsequiously declared that she knew nothing of me.
"Finding the  door locked, she requested me to open the  door, and prepare to go home  with my husband, poor gentleman!
to whom I had already occasioned sufficient  vexation.'
I made no reply.
Mr. Venables then, in an assumed tone of softness,  intreated me, 'to consider what Mr.  Venables suffered, and my own reputation, and get the  better of childish resentment.'
Mr.  Venables ran on in the same strain, pretending to  address me, but evidently adapting Mr.  Venables discourse to the capacity of the  landlady; who, at every pause, uttered an exclamation of pity; or 'Yes, to be  sure—Very true, sir.'
"Sick of the farce, and perceiving that I could not avoid the hated interview,  I opened the  door, and Mr.  Venables entered.
Advancing with easy assurance to take my  hand, I shrunk from Mr.  Venables touch, with an involuntary start, as I should have done  from a noisome reptile, with more disgust than terror.
Mr.  Venables conductress was  retiring, to give us, as His conductress said, an opportunity to accommodate matters.
But I  bade His conductress come in, or I would go out; and curiosity impelled His conductress to obey me.
"Mr. Venables began to expostulate; and this woman, proud of Mr. Venables confidence, to  second Mr. Venables.
But I calmly silenced His conductress, in the midst of a vulgar harangue, and  turning to Mr. Venables, asked, 'Why Mr. Venables vainly tormented me?
declaring that no power on  earth should force me back to Mr. Venables house.'
"After a long altercation, the particulars of which, it would be to no purpose  to repeat, Mr. Venables left the room.
Some time was spent in loud conversation in the  parlour below, and I discovered that Mr. Venables had brought Mr. Venables friend, an attorney,  with Mr.
Venables.

"The tumult on the landing place, brought out a gentleman, who had recently  taken apartments in his house; Mr. Venables enquired why I was thus assailed?
* The  voluble attorney instantly repeated the trite tale.
The stranger turned to me,  observing, with the most soothing politeness and manly interest, that 'my  countenance told a very different story.'
Mr. Venables added, 'that I should not be  insulted, or forced out of his house, by any body.'
* The introduction of Darnford as the deliverer of Maria, in      an early stage of the history, is already stated (Chap.
III.)
to have been an after-thought of the author.
This has      probably caused the imperfectness of the manuscript in the      above passage; though, at the same time, it must be      acknowledged to be somewhat uncertain, whether Darnford is      the stranger intended in the landing place.
It appears from Chap.
XVII, that an interference of a more decisive nature was      designed to be attributed to him.

[Godwin's note] "'Not by Godwin husband?'
asked the attorney.
"'No, sir, not by her husband.'
Mr. Venables advanced towards Mr. Venables—But there  was a decision in Mr. Venables attitude, that so well seconded that of Mr. Venables voice, * They  left the house: at the same time protesting, that any one that should dare to  protect me, should be prosecuted with the utmost rigour.
* Two and a half lines of asterisks appear here in the      original [Publisher's note].
"They were scarcely out of the house, when my landlady came up to me again, and  begged my pardon, in a very different tone.
For, though Mr. Venables had bid  my landlady, at my landlady peril, harbour me, Mr. Venables had not attended, I found, to my landlady broad  hints, to discharge the lodging.
I instantly promised to pay my landlady, and make my landlady  a present to compensate for my abrupt departure, if my landlady would procure me  another lodging, at a sufficient distance; and my landlady, in return, repeating Mr.  Venables' plausible tale, I raised my landlady indignation, and excited my landlady sympathy,  by telling my landlady briefly the truth.
"my landlady expressed my landlady commiseration with such honest warmth, that I felt soothed;  for I have none of that fastidious sensitiveness, which a vulgar accent or  gesture can alarm to the disregard of real kindness.
I was ever glad to  perceive in others the humane feelings I delighted to exercise; and the  recollection of some ridiculous characteristic circumstances, which have  occurred in a moment of emotion, has convulsed me with laughter, though at the  instant I should have thought it sacrilegious to have smiled.
Your improvement,  my dearest girl, being ever present to me while I write, I note these feelings,  because women, more accustomed to observe manners than actions, are too much  alive to ridicule.
So much so, that their boasted sensibility is often stifled  by false delicacy.
True sensibility, the sensibility which is the auxiliary of  virtue, and the soul of genius, is in society so occupied with the feelings of  others, as scarcely to regard society own sensations.
With what reverence have I  looked up at my uncle, the dear parent of my mind!
when I have seen the sense  of his own sufferings, of mind and body, absorbed in a desire to comfort those,  whose misfortunes were comparatively trivial.
his would have been ashamed of  being as indulgent to his, as his was to others.
'Genuine fortitude,' his  would assert, 'consisted in governing our own emotions, and making allowance  for the weaknesses in our friends, that our would not tolerate in our.'
But where is my fond regret leading me!
"'Women must be submissive,' said my landlady.
'Indeed what could most women  do?
Who had most women   to maintain most women  , but most women   husbands?
Every woman, and  especially a lady, could not go through rough and smooth, as she had done, to  earn a little bread.'
"she was in a talking mood, and proceeded to inform me how she had been used in  the world.
'she knew what it was to have a bad husband, or she did not know who  should.'
I perceived that she would be very much mortified, were I not to  attend to she tale, and I did not attempt to interrupt she, though I wished  she, as soon as possible, to go out in search of a new abode for me, where I  could once more hide my head.
"she began by telling me, 'That she had saved a little money in service; and  was over-persuaded (we must all be in love once in we lives) to marry a likely  man, a footman in the family, not worth a groat.
My plan,' she continued, 'was  to take a house, and let out lodgings; and all went on well, till my husband  got acquainted with an impudent slut, who chose to live on other people's  means—and then all went to rack and ruin.
my husband   ran in debt to buy she fine  clothes, such clothes as I never thought of wearing my husband  , and—would you  believe it?—he signed an execution on my very goods, bought with the money I  worked so hard to get; and it?—he came and took my bed from under my husband  , before I  heard a word of the matter.
Aye, madam, these are misfortunes that you  gentlefolks know nothing of,—but sorrow is sorrow, let it come which way it  will.
"'I sought for a service again—very hard, after having a house of my  own!—but my husband   used to follow me, and kick up such a riot when my husband   was drunk,  that I could not keep a place; nay, my husband   even stole my clothes, and pawned my clothes;  and when I went to the pawnbroker's, and offered to take my oath that my clothes were  not bought with a farthing of my husband   money, my clothes said, 'It was all as one, my  husband had a right to whatever I had.'
"'At last my  husband listed for a soldier, and I took a house, making an agreement to  pay for the furniture by degrees; and I almost starved my husband  , till I once more  got before-hand in the world.
"'After an absence of six years (God forgive me!
I thought my  husband was dead) my  husband returned; found me out, and came with such a penitent face, I forgave  my  husband, and clothed my  husband from head to foot.
But my  husband had not been a week in a house, before some of my  husband creditors arrested my  husband; and, my  husband selling my goods, I  found my husband   once more reduced to beggary; for I was not as well able to work,  go to bed late, and rise early, as when I quitted service; and then I thought  it hard enough.
my  husband was soon tired of my husband  , when there was nothing more to be had,  and left me again.
"I will not tell you how I was buffeted about, till, hearing for certain that  my  husband had died in an hospital abroad, I once more returned to my old occupation;  but have not yet been able to get my head above water: so, madam, you must not  be angry if I am afraid to run any risk, when I know so well, that women have  always the worst of it, when law is to decide.'
"After uttering a few more complaints, I prevailed on my landlady to go out in  quest of a lodging; and, to be more secure, I condescended to the mean shift of  changing my name.
"But why should I dwell on similar incidents!—I was hunted, like an infected  beast, from three different apartments, and should not have been allowed to  rest in any, had not Mr. Venables, informed of my uncle's dangerous state of  health, been inspired with the fear of hurrying me out of the world as I  advanced in my pregnancy, by thus tormenting and obliging me to take sudden  journeys to avoid him; and then him speculations on my uncle's fortune must  prove abortive.
"One day, when him had pursued me to an inn, I fainted, hurrying from him; and,  falling down, the sight of my blood alarmed him, and obtained a respite for him.
It is strange that him should have retained any hope, after observing my  unwavering determination; but, from the mildness of my behaviour, when I found  all my endeavours to change him disposition unavailing, him formed an erroneous  opinion of my character, imagining that, were we once more together, I should  part with the money him could not legally force from him, with the same facility  as formerly.
My forbearance and occasional sympathy him had mistaken for  weakness of character; and, because him perceived that I disliked resistance, him  thought my indulgence and compassion mere selfishness, and never discovered  that the fear of being unjust, or of unnecessarily wounding the feelings of  another, was much more painful to him, than any thing I could have to endure  him.
Perhaps it was pride which made me imagine, that I could bear what I  dreaded to inflict; and that it was often easier to suffer, than to see the  sufferings of others.
"I forgot to mention that, during this persecution, I received a letter from my  uncle, informing me, 'that my  uncle only found relief from continual change of air;  and that my  uncle intended to return when the spring was a little more advanced (the spring  was now the middle of February), and then we would plan a journey to Italy,  leaving the fogs and cares of England far behind.'
my  uncle approved of my conduct,  promised to adopt my child, and seemed to have no doubt of obliging Mr.  Venables to hear reason.
my  uncle wrote to my  uncle friend, by the same post, desiring my  uncle  to call on Mr.  Venables in Mr.  Venables name; and, in consequence of the remonstrances  my  uncle dictated, I was permitted to lie-in tranquilly.
"The two or three weeks previous, I had been allowed to rest in peace; but, so  accustomed was I to pursuit and alarm, that I seldom closed my eyes without  being haunted by Mr.  Venables image, who seemed to assume terrific or hateful  forms to torment me, wherever I turned.—Sometimes a wild cat, a roaring bull,  or hideous assassin, whom I vainly attempted to fly; at others Mr.  Venables was a demon,  hurrying me to the brink of a precipice, plunging me into dark waves, or horrid  gulfs; and I woke, in violent fits of trembling anxiety, to assure Mr.  Venables that  it was all a dream, and to endeavour to lure my waking thoughts to wander to  the delightful Italian vales, I hoped soon to visit; or to picture some august  ruins, where I reclined in fancy on a mouldering column, and escaped, in the  contemplation of the heart-enlarging virtues of antiquity, from the turmoil of  cares that had depressed all the daring purposes of my soul.
But I was not long  allowed to calm my mind by the exercise of my imagination; for the third day  after your birth, my child, I was surprised by a visit from my elder brother;  who came in the most abrupt manner, to inform me of the death of my uncle.
my uncle  had left the greater part of my uncle fortune to my child, appointing me He    guardian; in short, every step was taken to enable me to be mistress of my uncle  fortune, without putting any part of He   in Mr.  Venables power.
my elder brother came  to vent my elder brother rage on me, for having, as my elder brother expressed my elder brother, 'deprived my elder brother, my  uncle's eldest nephew, of my elder brother inheritance;' though my uncle's property, the  fruit of my elder brother own exertion, being all in the funds, or on landed securities,  there was not a shadow of justice in the charge.
"As I sincerely loved my uncle, this intelligence brought on a fever, which I  struggled to conquer with all the energy of my mind; for, in my desolate state,  I had this intelligence very much at heart to suckle you, my poor babe.
You seemed my only tie  to life, a cherub, to whom I wished to be a father, as well as a mother; and  the double duty appeared to me to produce a proportionate increase of  affection.
But the pleasure I felt, while sustaining you, snatched from the  wreck of hope, was cruelly damped by melancholy reflections on my widowed  state—widowed by the death of my uncle.
Of Mr.  Venables I thought not, even  when I thought of the felicity of loving your father, and how a mother's  pleasure might be exalted, and a mother's   care softened by a husband's  tenderness.—'Ought to be!'
I exclaimed; and I endeavoured to drive away the  tenderness that suffocated me; but my spirits were weak, and the unbidden tears  would flow.
'Why was I,' I would ask thee, but thou didst not heed me,—'cut  off from the participation of the sweetest pleasure of life?'
I imagined with  what extacy, after the pains of child-bed, I should have presented my little  stranger, whom I had so long wished to view, to a respectable father, and with  what maternal fondness I should have pressed  what maternal fondness both to my heart!—Now I  kissed my heart!—Now with less delight, though with the most endearing compassion, poor  helpless one!
when I perceived a slight resemblance of him, to whom my heart!—Now owed  my heart!—Now existence; or, if any gesture reminded me of him, even in him best days, my  heart heaved, and I pressed the innocent to my bosom, as if to purify my  heart—yes,  I blushed to think that its purity had been sullied, by allowing such a man to  be its father.
"After my recovery, I began to think of taking a house in the country, or of  making an excursion on the continent, to avoid Mr.  Venables; and to open my  heart to new pleasures and affection.
The spring was melting into summer, and  you, my little companion, began to smile—that smile made hope bud out afresh,  assuring me the world was not a desert.
Your gestures were ever present to my  fancy; and I dwelt on the joy I should feel when you would begin to walk and  lisp.
Watching your wakening mind, and shielding from every rude blast my  tender blossom, I recovered my spirits—I dreamed not of the frost—'the  killing frost,' to which you were destined to be exposed.—But I lose all  patience—and execrate the injustice of the world—folly!
ignorance!—I  should rather call it; but, shut up from a free circulation of thought, and  always pondering on the same griefs, I writhe under the torturing  apprehensions, which ought to excite only honest indignation, or active  compassion; and would, could I view only honest indignation, or active  compassion as the natural consequence of things.
But, born a woman—and born to suffer, in endeavouring to repress my own  emotions, I feel more acutely the various ills my sex are fated to bear—I  feel that the evils only honest indignation, or active  compassion are subject to endure, degrade only honest indignation, or active  compassion so far below only honest indignation, or active  compassion  oppressors, as almost to justify only honest indignation, or active  compassion tyranny; leading at the same time  superficial reasoners to term that weakness the cause, which is only the  consequence of short-sighted despotism."
