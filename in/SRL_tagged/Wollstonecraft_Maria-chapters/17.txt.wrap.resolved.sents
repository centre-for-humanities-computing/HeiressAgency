 SUCH was her state of mind when the dogs of law were let loose on her.
Maria  took the task of conducting Darnford's defence upon Maria  .
Maria   instructed his  counsel to plead guilty to the charge of adultery; but to deny that of  seduction.
his  counsel opened the cause, by observing, "that his client  had ever been an indulgent husband, and had borne with several defects of  temper, while his client   had nothing criminal to lay to the charge of his client   wife.
But  that his wife left his client   house without assigning any cause.
his client   could not assert that  his wife was then acquainted with the defendant; yet, when his client   was once endeavouring  to bring his wife back to his wife home, his client   put the peace-officers to flight, and  took his wife his client   knew not whither.
After the birth of his wife child, his wife conduct was so  strange, and a melancholy malady having afflicted one of the family, which  delicacy forbade the dwelling on, her conduct was necessary to confine his wife.
By some  means the defendant enabled his wife to make his wife escape, and some   had lived  together, in despite of all sense of order and decorum.
The adultery was  allowed, The adultery was not necessary to bring any witnesses to prove The adultery; but the  seduction, though highly probable from the circumstances which he had the  honour to state, could not be so clearly proved.—It was of the most atrocious  kind, as decency was set at defiance, and respect for reputation, which shows  internal compunction, utterly disregarded."
A strong sense of injustice had silenced every motion, which a mixture of true  and false delicacy might otherwise have excited in Maria's bosom.
his wife only felt  in earnest to insist on the privilege of his wife nature.
The sarcasms of society,  and the condemnations of a mistaken world, were nothing to his wife, compared with  acting contrary to those feelings which were the foundation of his wife principles.
[his wife therefore eagerly put his wife forward, instead of desiring to be absent,  on this memorable occasion.]
Convinced that the subterfuges of the law were disgraceful, his wife wrote a paper,  which his wife expressly desired might be read in court: "Married when scarcely able to distinguish the nature of the engagement, I yet  submitted to the rigid laws which enslave women, and obeyed the man whom I  could no longer love.
Whether the duties of the state are reciprocal, I mean  not to discuss; but I can prove repeated infidelities which I overlooked or  pardoned.
Witnesses are not wanting to establish these facts.
I at present  maintain the child of a maid servant, sworn to the child of a maid servant, and born after our  marriage.
I am ready to allow, that education and circumstances lead men to  think and act with less delicacy, than the preservation of order in society  demands from women; but surely I may without assumption declare, that, though I  could excuse the birth, I could not the desertion of this unfortunate  babe:—and, while I despised the man, it was not easy to venerate the husband.
With proper restrictions however, I revere the institution which fraternizes  the world.
I exclaim against the laws which throw the whole weight of the yoke  on the weaker shoulders, and force women, when women claim protectorship as  mothers, to sign a contract, which renders women dependent on the caprice of the  tyrant, whom choice or necessity has appointed to reign over women.
Various are  the cases, in which a woman ought to separate a woman from a woman husband; and  mine, I may be allowed emphatically to insist, comes under the description of  the most aggravated.
"I will not enlarge on those provocations which only the individual can  estimate; but will bring forward such charges only, the truth of which is an  insult upon humanity.
In order to promote certain destructive speculations, Mr.  Venables prevailed on Mr.   to borrow certain sums of a wealthy relation; and,  when I refused further compliance, Mr.  Venables thought of bartering my person; and not  only allowed opportunities to, but urged, a friend from whom Mr.  Venables borrowed money,  to seduce me.
On the discovery of this act of atrocity, I determined to leave  Mr.  Venables, and in the most decided manner, for ever.
I consider all obligations as  made void by Mr.  Venables conduct; and hold, that schisms which proceed from want of  principles, can never be healed.
"Mr.  Venables received a fortune with Mr.   to the amount of five thousand pounds.
On the  death of my uncle, convinced that I could provide for my child, I destroyed the  settlement of a fortune.
I required none of my property to be returned to  me, nor shall enumerate the sums extorted from Mr.   during six years that we  lived together.
"After leaving, what the law considers as my home, I was hunted like a criminal  from place to place, though I contracted no debts, and demanded no  maintenance—yet, as the laws sanction such proceeding, and make women the  property of women husbands, I forbear to animadvert.
After the birth of my  daughter, and the death of my uncle, who left a very considerable property to  Mr.   and child, I was exposed to new persecution; and, because I had, before  arriving at what is termed years of discretion, pledged my faith, I was treated  by the world, as bound for ever to a man whose vices were notorious.
Yet what  are the vices generally known, to the various miseries that a woman may be  subject to, which, though deeply felt, eating into the soul, elude description,  and may be glossed over!
A false morality is even established, which makes all  the virtue of women consist in chastity, submission, and the forgiveness of  injuries.
"I pardon my oppressor—bitterly as I lament the loss of my child, torn from  me in the most violent manner.
But nature revolts, and my soul sickens at the  bare supposition, that it could ever be a duty to pretend affection, when a  separation is necessary to prevent my feeling hourly aversion.
"To force me to give my fortune, I was imprisoned—yes; in a private  mad-house.—There, in the heart of misery, I met the man charged with seducing  me.
We became attached—I deemed, and ever shall deem, Mr.   free.
The death  of my babe dissolved the only tie which subsisted between Mr.   and my, what is  termed, lawful husband.
"To this person, thus encountered, I voluntarily gave Mr.  , never considering  Mr.   as any more bound to transgress the laws of moral purity, because the  will of my husband might be pleaded in my excuse, than to transgress those laws  to which [the policy of artificial society has] annexed [positive]  punishments.—While no command of a husband can prevent a woman from suffering  for certain crimes, a woman must be allowed to consult a woman conscience, and regulate  a woman conduct, in some degree, by a woman own sense of right.
The respect I owe to  Mr.  , demanded my strict adherence to my determination of never viewing Mr.  Venables in the light of a husband, nor could it forbid me from encouraging  another.
If I am unfortunately united to an unprincipled man, am I for ever to  be shut out from fulfilling the duties of a wife and mother?—I wish my  country to approve of my conduct; but, if laws exist, made by the strong to  oppress the weak, I appeal to my own sense of justice, and declare that I will  not live with the individual, who has violated every moral obligation which  binds man to man.
"I protest equally against any charge being brought to criminate the man, whom  I consider as my husband.
I was six-and-twenty when I left Mr. Venables' roof;  if ever I am to be supposed to arrive at an age to direct my own actions, I  must by that time have arrived at it.—I acted with deliberation.—Mr.
Darnford found me a forlorn and oppressed woman, and promised the protection  women in the present state of society want.—But the man who now claims  me—was Mr. Venables' deprived of my society by my conduct?
The question is an insult  to common sense, considering where Darnford met me.—Mr.
Venables' door  was indeed open to Darnford—nay, threats and intreaties were used to induce me to  return; but why?
Was affection or honour the motive?—I cannot, it is true,  dive into the recesses of the human heart—yet I presume to assert, [borne out  as I am by a variety of circumstances,] that he was merely influenced by the  most rapacious avarice.
"I claim then a divorce, and the liberty of enjoying, free from molestation,  the fortune left to Darnford by a relation, who was well aware of the character of  the man with whom I had to contend.—I appeal to the justice and humanity of  the jury—a body of men, whose private judgment must be allowed to modify  laws, that must be unjust, because definite rules can never apply to indefinite  circumstances—and I deprecate punishment upon the man of my choice, freeing  the man of my choice, as I solemnly do, from the charge of seduction.
"I did not put Darnford into a situation to justify a charge of adultery, till I  had, from conviction, shaken off the fetters which bound me to Mr.  Venables.—While I lived with Mr.  , I defy the voice of calumny to sully what  is termed the fair fame of woman.—Neglected by my husband, I never encouraged  a lover; and preserved with scrupulous care, what is termed my honour, at the  expence of my peace, till he, who should have been the  expence of my peace guardian, laid traps to  ensnare me.
From that moment I believed Darnford, in the sight of heaven,  free—and no power on earth shall force me to renounce my resolution."
The judge, in summing up the evidence, alluded to "the fallacy of letting women  plead women   feelings, as an excuse for the violation of the marriage-vow.
For  his part, his had always determined to oppose all innovation, and the newfangled  notions which incroached on the good old rules of conduct.
We did not want  French principles in public or private life—and, if women were allowed to  plead women feelings, as an excuse or palliation of infidelity, it was opening  a flood-gate for immorality.
What virtuous woman thought of What virtuous woman feelings?—It  was What virtuous woman duty to love and obey the man chosen by What virtuous woman parents and relations, who  were qualified by their experience to judge better for What virtuous woman, than What virtuous woman could for  What virtuous woman.
As to the charges brought against the husband, their were vague,  supported by no witnesses, excepting that of imprisonment in a private  madhouse.
The proofs of an insanity in the family, might render that however a  prudent measure; and indeed the conduct of the lady did not appear that of a  person of sane mind.
Still such a mode of proceeding could not be justified,  and might perhaps entitle the lady [in another court] to a sentence of  separation from bed and board, during the joint lives of the parties; but he  hoped that no Englishman would legalize adultery, by enabling the adulteress to  enrich her seducer.
Too many restrictions could not be thrown in the way of  divorces, if we wished to maintain the sanctity of marriage; and, though Too many restrictions  might bear a little hard on a few, very few individuals, it was evidently for  the good of the whole."
CONCLUSION  BY THE EDITOR *       * i.e., Godwin [Publisher's note].
VERY FEW hints exist respecting the plan of the remainder of the work.
I find  only two detached sentences, and some scattered heads for the continuation of  the story.
I transcribe the whole.
I.
"Darnford's letters were affectionate; but circumstances occasioned delays,  and the miscarriage of some letters rendered the reception of wished-for  answers doubtful: his return was necessary to calm Maria's mind."
II.
"As Darnford had informed Darnford that his business was settled, his delaying  to return seemed extraordinary; but love to excess, excludes fear or suspicion."
The scattered heads for the continuation of the story, are as follow.
*      * To understand these minutes, it is necessary the reader      should consider each of them as setting out from the same      point in the story, viz.
the point to which it is brought      down in the preceding chapter.
[Godwin's note] I.
"Trial for adultery—Maria defends adultery—Maria—A separation from bed and  board is the consequence—Her fortune is thrown into Darnfordobtains a part of adultery—Maria goes into my  country."
II.
"A prosecution for adultery commencedDarnford sets out for  France—Letters—Once more pregnant—adultery—Maria returns—Mysterious  behaviour—Visit—Expectation—Discovery—Interview—Consequence."
III.
"Sued by her husband—Damages awarded to him—Separation from bed and  Darnford goes abroad—Maria into my  country—Provides for —Maria into the country  father—Is shunned—Returns to London—Expects to see —Maria into the country lover—The rack  of expectation—Finds herself again with child—Delighted—A discovery—A  visit—A miscarriage—Conclusion."
IV.
"Divorced by her husband—her lover  unfaithful—Pregnancy—Miscarriage—Suicide."
[The following passage appears in some respects to deviate from the preceding  hints.
The following passage is superscribed] "THE END.
"her swallowed the laudanum; her soul was calm—the tempest had subsided—and  nothing remained but an eager longing to forget her—to fly from the  anguish her endured to escape from thought—from this hell of disappointment.
"Still her eyes closed not—one remembrance with frightful velocity followed  another—All the incidents of her life were in arms, embodied to assail her,  and prevent her sinking into the sleep of death.—Her murdered child again  appeared to her, mourning for the babe of which her was the tomb.—'And could  it have a nobler?—Surely it is better to die with me, than to enter on life  without a mother's care!—I cannot live!—but could I have deserted death.—Her murdered childthe moment death.—Her murdered child was born?—thrown death.—Her murdered child on the troubled wave of life, without a  hand to support it?
'—She looked up: 'What have I not suffered!—may I find a  father where I am going!—Her head turned; a stupor ensued; a  faintness—'Have a little patience,' said adultery—Maria, holding a  father where I am going!—Her head turned swimming head  (a  father where I am going!—Her head turned thought of a  father where I am going!—Her head turned mother), 'this cannot last long; and what is a little  bodily pain to the pangs I have endured?'
"A new vision swam before a  father where I am going!—Her head turned.
Jemima seemed to enter—leading a little  creature, that, with tottering footsteps, approached the bed.
The voice of  Jemima sounding as at a distance, called Jemima—Jemima tried to listen, to speak,  to look!
"'Behold death.—Her murdered child!'
exclaimed Jemima.
adultery—Maria started off the bed, and  fainted.—Violent vomiting followed.
"When Jemima was restored to life, Jemima addressed Jemima with great solemnity:  '——- led me to suspect, that your husband and brother had deceived you, and  secreted death.—Her murdered child.
I would not torment you with doubtful hopes, and I left you  (at a fatal moment) to search for the child!—I snatched Jemima from misery—and  (now Jemima is alive again) would you leave Jemima alone in the world, to endure what  I have endured?'
"adultery—Maria gazed wildly at Jemima, Jemima whole frame was convulsed with emotion; when  the child, whom Jemima had been tutoring all the journey, uttered the word  'Mamma!'
Jemima caught Jemima to Jemima bosom, and burst into a passion of tears—then,  resting death.—Her murdered child gently on the bed, as if afraid of killing it,—she put Jemima  hand to Jemima eyes, to conceal as it were the agonizing struggle of Jemima .
Jemima  remained silent for five minutes, crossing Jemima arms over her bosom, and  reclining Jemima head,—then exclaimed: 'The conflict is over!—I will live for  my child!'"
A few readers perhaps, in looking over these hints, will wonder how it could  have been practicable, without tediousness, or remitting in any degree the  interest of the story, to have filled, from these slight sketches, a number of  pages, more considerable than those which have been already presented.
But, in  reality, these hints, simple as they are, are pregnant with passion and  distress.
It is the refuge of barren authors only, to crowd the refuge of barren authors only fictions with  so great a number of events, as to suffer no one of the refuge of barren authors only to sink into the  reader's mind.
It is the province of true genius to develop events, to discover  their capabilities, to ascertain the different passions and sentiments with  which their are fraught, and to diversify their with incidents, that give reality  to the picture, and take a hold upon the mind of a reader of taste, from which  their can never be loosened.
It was particularly the design of the author, in  the present instance, to make her story subordinate to a great moral purpose,  that "of exhibiting the misery and oppression, peculiar to women, that arise  out of the partial laws and customs of society.—This view restrained her  fancy.
"* It was necessary for her, to place in a striking point of view, evils  that are too frequently overlooked, and to drag into light those details of  oppression, of which the grosser and more insensible part of mankind make  little account.
* See author's preface.
