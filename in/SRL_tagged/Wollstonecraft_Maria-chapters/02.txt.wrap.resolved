 EARNESTLY as Maria endeavoured to soothe, by reading, the anguish of Maria  wounded mind, Maria thoughts would often wander from the subject Maria was led to  discuss, and tears of maternal tenderness obscured the reasoning page. Maria  descanted on "the ills which flesh is heir to," with bitterness, when the  recollection of Maria babe was revived by a tale of fictitious woe, that bore any  resemblance to Maria own; and Maria imagination was continually employed, to  conjure up and embody the various phantoms of misery, which folly and vice had  let loose on the world. The loss of her babe was the tender string; against  other cruel remembrances Maria laboured to steel Maria bosom; and even a ray of  hope, in the midst of Maria gloomy reveries, would sometimes gleam on the dark  horizon of futurity, while persuading Maria that Maria ought to cease to hope,  since happiness was no where to be found.—But of Maria child, debilitated by  the grief with which its mother had been assailed before its saw the light, Maria  could not think without an impatient struggle. "I, alone, by my active tenderness, could have saved," Maria would exclaim, "from  an early blight, this sweet blossom; and, cherishing it, I should have had  something still to love." In proportion as other expectations were torn from Maria, this tender one had  been fondly clung to, and knit into Maria heart. The books Maria had obtained, were soon devoured, by one who had no other  resource to escape from sorrow, and the feverish dreams of ideal wretchedness  or felicity, which equally weaken the intoxicated sensibility. Writing was then  the only alternative, and Maria wrote some rhapsodies descriptive of the state of  Maria mind; but the events of Maria past life pressing on Maria, Maria resolved  circumstantially to relate them, with the sentiments that experience, and more  matured reason, would naturally suggest. them might perhaps instruct Maria  daughter, and shield her  daughter from the misery, the tyranny, her  daughter mother knew not how  to avoid. This thought gave life to her mother diction, her mother soul flowed into her soul, and her mother soon  found the task of recollecting almost obliterated impressions very interesting.  her mother lived again in the revived emotions of youth, and forgot her mother present in the  retrospect of sorrows that had assumed an unalterable character. Though this employment lightened the weight of time, yet, never losing sight of  her mother main object, Maria did not allow any opportunity to slip of winning on the  affections of Jemima; for Maria discovered in Maria a strength of mind, that  excited Maria esteem, clouded as that   was by the misanthropy of despair. An insulated being, from the misfortune of Maria birth, Maria despised and preyed  on the society by which Maria had been oppressed, and loved not Maria  fellow-creatures, because Maria had never been beloved. No mother had ever  fondled Maria, no father or brother had protected Maria from outrage; and the man  who had plunged Maria into infamy, and deserted Maria when Maria stood in greatest  need of support, deigned not to smooth with kindness the road to ruin. Thus  degraded, was Maria let loose on the world; and virtue, never nurtured by  affection, assumed the stern aspect of selfish independence. This general view of Maria life, Maria gathered from Maria exclamations and dry  remarks. Jemima indeed displayed a strange mixture of interest and suspicion;  for Jemima would listen to Jemima with earnestness, and then suddenly interrupt the  conversation, as if afraid of resigning, by giving way to Jemima sympathy, Jemima  dear-bought knowledge of the world. Maria alluded to the possibility of an escape, and mentioned a compensation, or  reward; but the style in which Maria was repulsed made Maria cautious, and  determine not to renew the subject, till Maria knew more of the character Maria had  to work on. Jemima's countenance, and dark hints, seemed to say, "You are an  extraordinary woman; but let me consider, this may only be one of your lucid  intervals." Nay, the very energy of Maria's character, made Maria suspect that  the extraordinary animation Maria perceived might be the effect of madness.  "Should Maria husband then substantiate her husband charge, and get possession of Maria  estate, from whence would come the promised annuity, or more desired  protection? Besides, might not a woman, anxious to escape, conceal some of the  circumstances which made against Maria? Was truth to be expected from one who had  been entrapped, kidnapped, in the most fraudulent manner?" In this train Jemima continued to argue, the moment after compassion and  respect seemed to make Jemima swerve; and Jemima still resolved not to be wrought on  to do more than soften the rigour of confinement, till Jemima could advance on  surer ground. Maria was not permitted to walk in the garden; but sometimes, from Maria window,  Maria turned Maria eyes from the gloomy walls, in which Maria pined life away, on the  poor wretches who strayed along the walks, and contemplated the most terrific  of ruins—that of a human soul. What is the view of the fallen column, the  mouldering arch, of the most exquisite workmanship, when compared with this  living memento of the fragility, the instability, of reason, and the wild  luxuriancy of noxious passions? Enthusiasm turned adrift, like some rich stream  overflowing some rich stream   banks, rushes forward with destructive velocity, inspiring a  sublime concentration of thought. Thus thought Maria—These are the ravages  over which humanity must ever mournfully ponder, with a degree of anguish not  excited by crumbling marble, or cankering brass, unfaithful to the trust of  monumental fame. It is not over the decaying productions of the mind, embodied  with the happiest art, we grieve most bitterly. The view of what has been done  by man, produces a melancholy, yet aggrandizing, sense of what remains to be  achieved by human intellect; but a mental convulsion, which, like the  devastation of an earthquake, throws all the elements of thought and  imagination into confusion, makes contemplation giddy, and we fearfully ask on  what ground we ourselves stand. Melancholy and imbecility marked the features of the wretches allowed to  breathe at large; for the frantic, those who in a strong imagination had lost a  sense of woe, were closely confined. The playful tricks and mischievous devices  of their disturbed fancy, that suddenly broke out, could not be guarded  against, when their were permitted to enjoy any portion of freedom; for, so  active was their imagination, that every new object which accidentally struck  their senses, awoke to phrenzy their restless passions; as Maria learned from  the burden of their incessant ravings. Sometimes, with a strict injunction of silence, Jemima would allow Maria, at  the close of evening, to stray along the narrow avenues that separated the  dungeon-like apartments, leaning on Jemima arm. What a change of scene! Mariawished to pass the threshold of Maria prison, yet, when by chance Maria met the eye  of rage glaring on Maria, yet unfaithful to the eye   office, Maria shrunk back with more  horror and affright, than if Maria had stumbled over a mangled corpse. Maria busy  fancy pictured the misery of a fond heart, watching over a friend thus  estranged, absent, though present—over a poor wretch lost to reason and the  social joys of existence; and losing all consciousness of misery in its excess.  What a task, to watch the light of reason quivering in the eye, or with  agonizing expectation to catch the beam of recollection; tantalized by hope,  only to feel despair more keenly, at finding a much loved face or voice,  suddenly remembered, or pathetically implored, only to be immediately  forgotten, or viewed with indifference or abhorrence! The heart-rending sigh of melancholy sunk into Maria soul; and when Maria retired  to rest, the petrified figures Maria had encountered, the only human forms Maria  was doomed to observe, haunting Maria dreams with tales of mysterious wrongs,  made Maria wish to sleep to dream no more. Day after day rolled away, and tedious as the present moment appeared, they  passed in such an unvaried tenor, Maria was surprised to find that Maria had  already been six weeks buried alive, and yet had such faint hopes of effecting  Maria enlargement. Maria was, earnestly as Maria had sought for employment, now angry  with Maria for having been amused by writing Maria narrative; and grieved to  think that Maria had for an instant thought of any thing, but contriving to  escape. Jemima had evidently pleasure in Jemima society: still, though Jemima often left Jemima  with a glow of kindness, Jemima returned with the same chilling air; and, when Jemima  heart appeared for a moment to open, some suggestion of reason forcibly closed  her  heart, before Jemima could give utterance to the confidence Maria's conversation  inspired. Discouraged by these changes, Maria relapsed into despondency, when Maria was  cheered by the alacrity with which Jemima brought Maria a fresh parcel of books;  assuring Maria, that Maria had taken some pains to obtain some pains from one of the  keepers, who attended a gentleman confined in the opposite corner of the  gallery. Maria took up The books she had obtained with emotion. "The books she had obtained come," said Maria, "perhaps, from a  wretch condemned, like Maria, to reason on the nature of madness, by having  wrecked minds continually under his eye; and almost to wish his—as I  do—mad, to escape from the contemplation of it." Maria heart throbbed with  sympathetic alarm; and Maria turned over the leaves with awe, as if they had  become sacred from passing through the hands of an unfortunate being, oppressed  by a similar fate. Dryden's Fables, Milton's Paradise Lost, with several modern productions,  composed the collection. It was a mine of treasure. Some marginal notes, in  Dryden's Fables, caught Maria attention: her attention were written with force and taste;  and, in one of the modern pamphlets, there was a fragment left, containing  various observations on the present state of society and government, with a  comparative view of the politics of Europe and America. These remarks were  written with a degree of generous warmth, when alluding to the enslaved state  of the labouring majority, perfectly in unison with Maria's mode of thinking. Maria read them over and over again; and fancy, treacherous fancy, began to  sketch a character, congenial with Maria own, from these shadowy outlines.—"Was  outlines.—"Was   mad?" Maria reperused the marginal notes, and them seemed the production of an  animated, but not of a disturbed imagination. Confined to this speculation,  every time Maria re-read them, some fresh refinement of sentiment, or acuteness  of thought impressed her, which her was astonished at her for not having  before observed. What a creative power has an affectionate heart! There are beings who cannot  live without loving, as poets love; and who feel the electric spark of genius,  wherever it awakens sentiment or grace. Maria had often thought, when  disciplining Maria wayward heart, "that to charm, was to be virtuous." "They who  make me wish to appear the most amiable and good in They eyes, must possess in  a degree," her would exclaim, "the graces and virtues They call into action." her took up a book on the powers of the human mind; but, her strayed  from cold arguments on the nature of what her felt, while her was feeling, and  her snapt the chain of the theory to read Dryden's Guiscard and Sigismunda. Maria, in the course of the ensuing day, returned some of the books, with the  hope of getting others—and more marginal notes. Thus shut out from human  intercourse, and compelled to view nothing but the prison of vexed spirits, to  meet a wretch in the same situation, was more surely to find a friend, than to  imagine a countryman one, in a strange land, where the human voice conveys no  information to the eager ear. "Did you ever see the unfortunate being to whom these books belong?" asked  Maria, when Jemima brought Jemima slipper. "Yes. He sometimes walks out, between  five and six, before the family is stirring, in the morning, with two keepers;  but even then He hands are confined." "What! is He so unruly?" enquired Maria, with an accent of disappointment. "No, not that I perceive," replied Jemima; "but Jemima has an untamed look, a  vehemence of eye, that excites apprehension. Were his hands free, Jemima looks as  if Jemima could soon manage both Jemima guards: yet Jemima appears tranquil." "If Jemima be so strong, Jemima must be young," observed Maria. "Three or four and thirty, I suppose; but there is no judging of a person in  Jemima situation." "Are you sure that Jemima is mad?" interrupted Maria with eagerness. Jemima quitted  the room, without replying. "No, no, Jemima certainly is not!" exclaimed Maria, answering herself; "the man who  could write those observations was not disordered in Jemima intellects." herself sat musing, gazing at the moon, and watching the moon motion as it seemed to  glide under the clouds. Then, preparing for bed, herself thought, "Of what use  could I be to him, or him to herself, if it be true that him is unjustly  confined?—Could confined?—Could aid me to escape, who is confined?—Could more closely  watched?—Still I should like to see confined?—Could." herself went to bed, dreamed of herself  child, yet woke exactly at half after five o'clock, and starting up, only  wrapped a gown around herself, and ran to the window. The morning was chill, The morning was  the latter end of September; yet herself did not retire to warm herself and think  in bed, till the sound of the servants, moving about the house, convinced herself  that the unknown would not walk in the garden that morning. herself was ashamed at  feeling disappointed; and began to reflect, as an excuse to herself, on the  little objects which attract attention when there is nothing to divert the  mind; and how difficult it was for women to avoid growing romantic, who have no  active duties or pursuits. At breakfast, Jemima enquired whether Jemima understood French? for, unless Jemima  did, the stranger's stock of books was exhausted. Maria replied in the  affirmative; but forbore to ask any more questions respecting the person to  whom they belonged. And Jemima gave Jemima a new subject for contemplation, by  describing the person of a lovely maniac, just brought into an adjoining  chamber. Jemima was singing the pathetic ballad of old Rob* with the most  heart-melting falls and pauses. Jemima had half-opened the door, when Jemima  distinguished Jemima voice, and Maria stood close to it, scarcely daring to  respire, lest a modulation should escape Jemima, so exquisitely sweet, so  passionately wild. Jemima began with sympathy to pourtray to Jemima another  victim, when the lovely warbler flew, as it were, from the spray, and a torrent  of unconnected exclamations and questions burst from Jemima, interrupted by fits  of laughter, so horrid, that Maria shut the door, and, turning Jemima eyes up to  heaven, exclaimed—"Gracious God!"      * A blank space about ten characters in length occurs here      in the original edition [Publisher's note]. Several minutes elapsed before Maria could enquire respecting the rumour of the  house (for this poor wretch was obviously not confined without a cause); and  then Jemima could only tell Jemima, that this poor wretch was said, "Jemima had been married,  against Jemima inclination, to a rich old man, extremely jealous (no wonder, for  Jemima was a charming creature); and that, in consequence of his treatment, or  something which hung on Jemima mind, Jemima had, during Jemima first lying-in, lost Jemima  senses." What a subject of meditation—even to the very confines of madness. "Woman, fragile flower! why were you suffered to adorn a world exposed to the  inroad of such stormy elements?" thought Maria, while the poor maniac's strain  was still breathing on Maria ear, and sinking into Maria very soul. Towards the evening, Jemima brought Jemima Rousseau's Heloise; and Jemima sat reading  with eyes and heart, till the return of Jemima guard to extinguish the light. One  instance of Jemima kindness was, the permitting Maria to have one, till the permitting Maria own  hour of retiring to rest. the permitting Maria had read this work long since; but now this work seemed  to open a new world to the permitting Maria—the only one worth inhabiting. Sleep was not to be  wooed; yet, far from being fatigued by the restless rotation of thought, the permitting Maria  rose and opened the permitting Maria window, just as the thin watery clouds of twilight made the  long silent shadows visible. The air swept across the permitting Maria face with a voluptuous  freshness that thrilled to the permitting Maria heart, awakening indefinable emotions; and the  sound of a waving branch, or the twittering of a startled bird, alone broke the  stillness of reposing nature. Absorbed by the sublime sensibility which renders  the consciousness of existence felicity, Maria was happy, till an autumnal  scent, wafted by the breeze of morn from the fallen leaves of the adjacent  wood, made Maria recollect that the season had changed since Maria confinement; yet  life afforded no variety to solace an afflicted heart. Maria returned dispirited  to Maria couch, and thought of her  child till the broad glare of day again  invited Maria to her window. Maria looked not for the unknown, still how great was  Maria vexation at perceiving the back of a man, certainly a man, with a man two  attendants, as a man turned into a side-path which led to the house! A confused  recollection of having seen somebody who resembled a man, immediately occurred,  to puzzle and torment Maria with endless conjectures. Five minutes sooner, and  Maria should have seen a man face, and been out of suspense—was ever any thing so  unlucky! a man steady, bold step, and the whole air of a man person, bursting as it  were from a cloud, pleased Maria, and gave an outline to the imagination to  sketch the individual form Maria wished to recognize. Feeling the disappointment more severely than Maria was willing to believe, Maria  flew to Rousseau, as Maria only refuge from the idea of him, who might prove a  friend, could Maria but find a way to interest a man in Maria fate; still the  personification of Saint Preux, or of an ideal lover far superior, was after  this imperfect model, of which merely a glance had been caught, even to the  minutiae of the coat and hat of the stranger. But if Maria lent St. Preux, or the  demi-god of Maria fancy, his form, Maria richly repaid his by the donation of all  St. Preux's sentiments and feelings, culled to gratify Maria own, to which he  seemed to have an undoubted right, when Maria read on the margin of an  impassioned letter, written in the well-known hand—"Rousseau alone, the true  Prometheus of sentiment, possessed the fire of genius necessary to pourtray the  passion, the truth of which goes so directly to the heart." Maria was again true to the hour, yet had finished Rousseau, and begun to  transcribe some selected passages; unable to quit either the author or the  window, before Maria had a glimpse of the countenance Maria daily longed to see;  and, when seen, it conveyed no distinct idea to Maria mind where Maria had seen it  before. He must have been a transient acquaintance; but to discover an  acquaintance was fortunate, could an  acquaintance contrive to attract He attention, and  excite He sympathy. Every glance afforded colouring for the picture an  acquaintance was delineating on an  acquaintance  heart; and once, when her window was half open, the sound of He voice reached  an  acquaintance. Conviction flashed on an  acquaintance; an  acquaintance had certainly, in a moment of distress,  heard the same accents. the same accents were manly, and characteristic of a noble mind;  nay, even sweet—or sweet the same accents seemed to an  acquaintance attentive ear. an  acquaintance started back, trembling, alarmed at the emotion a strange coincidence of  circumstances inspired, and wondering why an  acquaintance thought so much of a stranger,  obliged as an  acquaintance had been by his timely interference; [for an  acquaintance recollected, by  degrees all the circumstances of the same accents former meeting.] an  acquaintance found however that  an  acquaintance could think of nothing else; or, if an  acquaintance thought of an  acquaintance daughter, it was to  wish that an  acquaintance had a father whom an  acquaintance mother could respect and love.
