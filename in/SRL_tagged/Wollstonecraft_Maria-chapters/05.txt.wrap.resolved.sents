 "MY FATHER," said Jemima, "seduced my mother, a pretty girl, with whom  "MY FATHER lived  fellow-servant; and Jemima no sooner perceived the natural, the dreaded  consequence, than the terrible conviction flashed on Jemima—that Jemima was ruined.
Honesty, and a regard for Jemima reputation, had been the only principles  inculcated by Jemima mother; and they had been so forcibly impressed, that Jemima  feared shame, more than the poverty to which it would lead.
Jemima incessant  importunities to prevail upon  "MY FATHER to screen Jemima from reproach by marrying  Jemima, as  "MY FATHER had promised in the fervour of seduction, estranged  "MY FATHER from Jemima so  completely, that Jemima very person became distasteful to  "MY FATHER; and  "MY FATHER began to  hate, as well as despise me, before I was born.
"My mother, grieved to the soul by  "MY FATHER neglect, and unkind treatment, actually  resolved to famish My mother; and injured My mother health by the attempt; though My mother  had not sufficient resolution to adhere to My mother project, or renounce her project  entirely.
Death came not at My mother call; yet sorrow, and the methods My mother adopted  to conceal My mother condition, still doing the work of a house-maid, had such an  effect on My mother constitution, that My mother died in the wretched garret, where My mother  virtuous mistress had forced her  virtuous mistress to take refuge in the very pangs of labour,  though my father, after a slight reproof, was allowed to remain in my father  place—allowed by the mother of six children, who, scarcely permitting a  footstep to be heard, during My mother month's indulgence, felt no sympathy for the  poor wretch, denied every comfort required by My mother situation.
"The day my mother, died, the ninth after my birth, I was consigned to the care  of the cheapest nurse my father could find; who suckled my mother own child at the  same time, and lodged as many more as my mother could get, in two cellar-like  apartments.
"Poverty, and the habit of seeing children die off my mother hands, had so hardened  my mother heart, that the office of a mother did not awaken the tenderness of a  woman; nor were the feminine caresses which seem a part of the rearing of a  child, ever bestowed on me.
The chicken has a wing to shelter under; but I had  no bosom to nestle in, no kindred warmth to foster me.
Left in dirt, to cry  with cold and hunger till I was weary, and sleep without ever being prepared by  exercise, or lulled by kindness to rest; could I be expected to become any  thing but a weak and rickety babe?
Still, in spite of neglect, I continued to  exist, to learn to curse existence, [her countenance grew ferocious as her  spoke,] and the treatment that rendered me miserable, seemed to sharpen my  wits.
Confined then in a damp hovel, to rock the cradle of the succeeding  tribe, I looked like a little old woman, or a hag shrivelling into nothing.
The  furrows of reflection and care contracted the youthful cheek, and gave a sort  of supernatural wildness to the ever watchful eye.
During this period, my  father had married another fellow-servant, who loved my  father less, and knew better  how to manage my  father passion, than my mother.
my mother likewise proving with child,  they agreed to keep a shop: my step-mother, if, being an illegitimate  offspring, I may venture thus to characterize my mother, having obtained a sum of a  rich relation, for that purpose.
"Soon after her lying-in, her prevailed on my  father to take me home, to save  the expense of maintaining me, and of hiring a girl to assist her in the care  of the child.
I was young, it was true, but appeared a knowing little thing,  and might be made handy.
Accordingly I was brought to her house; but not to a  home—for a home I never knew.
Of the child, a daughter, her was  extravagantly fond; and it was a part of my employment, to assist to spoil her,  by humouring all her whims, and bearing all her caprices.
Feeling her own  consequence, before her could speak, her had learned the art of tormenting me,  and if I ever dared to resist, I received blows, laid on with no compunctious  hand, or was sent to bed dinnerless, as well as supperless.
I said that it was  a part of my daily labour to attend the child, with the servility of a slave;  still it was but a part.
I was sent out in all seasons, and from place to  place, to carry burdens far above my strength, without being allowed to draw  near the fire, or ever being cheered by encouragement or kindness.
No wonder  then, treated like a creature of another species, that I began to envy, and at  length to hate, the darling of the house.
Yet, I perfectly remember, that it  was the caresses, and kind expressions of my step-mother, which first excited  my jealous discontent.
Once, I cannot forget it, when her was calling in vain  her wayward child to kiss her, I ran to her, saying, 'I will kiss you, ma'am!'
and how did my heart, which was in my mouth, sink, what was my debasement of  soul, when pushed away with—'I do not want you, pert thing!'
Another day,  when a new gown had excited the highest good humour, and her uttered the  appropriate dear, addressed unexpectedly to her, I thought I could never do  enough to please her; I was all alacrity, and rose proportionably in my own  estimation.
"As her daughter grew up, her daughter was pampered with cakes and fruit, while I was,  literally speaking, fed with the refuse of the table, with her daughter leavings.
A  liquorish tooth is, I believe, common to children, and I used to steal any  thing sweet, that I could catch up with a chance of concealment.
When detected,  her daughter was not content to chastize me her daughter at the moment, but, on my father's  return in the evening (my father's   was a shopman), the principal discourse was to  recount my faults, and attribute children to the wicked disposition which I had  brought into the world with my father's  , inherited from my mother.
my father's   did not fail to  leave the marks of my father's   resentment on my body, and then solaced my father's   by  playing with my sister.—I could have murdered her daughter at those moments.
To save  my father's   from these unmerciful corrections, I resorted to falshood, and the  untruths which I sturdily maintained, were brought in judgment against my father's  , to  support my tyrant's inhuman charge of my natural propensity to vice.
Seeing me  treated with contempt, and always being fed and dressed better, my sister  conceived a contemptuous opinion of my father's  , that proved an obstacle to all  affection; and my father's  , hearing continually of my faults, began to consider  me as a curse entailed on my father's   for my father's   sins: my father's   was therefore easily prevailed  on to bind me apprentice to one of my step-mother's friends, who kept a  slop-shop in Wapping.
I was represented (as it was said) in my true colours;  but she, 'warranted,' snapping she fingers, 'that she should break my spirit or  heart.'
"she replied, with a whine, 'that if any body could make me better, any body  was such a clever woman as she; though, for she own part, she had tried in  vain; but good-nature was she fault.'
"I shudder with horror, when I recollect the treatment I had now to endure.
Not  only under the lash of my task-mistress, but the drudge of the maid,  apprentices and children, I never had a taste of human kindness to soften the  rigour of perpetual labour.
I had been introduced as an object of abhorrence  into the family; as a creature of whom my step-mother, though she had been kind  enough to let me live in the house with she own child, could make nothing.
I  was described as a wretch, whose nose must be kept to the grinding stone—and  whose nose was held there with an iron grasp.
It seemed indeed the privilege of their  superior nature to kick me about, like the dog or cat.
If I were attentive, I  was called fawning, if refractory, an obstinate mule, and like a mule I  received I were attentive censure on my loaded back.
Often has my task-mistress, for some  instance of forgetfulness, thrown me from one side of the kitchen to the other,  knocked my head against the wall, spit in my face, with various refinements on  barbarity that I forbear to enumerate, though I were attentive were all acted over again by  the servant, with additional insults, to which the appellation of bastard, was  commonly added, with taunts or sneers.
But I will not attempt to give you an  adequate idea of my situation, lest you, who probably have never been drenched  with the dregs of human misery, should think I exaggerate.
"I stole now, from absolute necessity,—bread; yet whatever else was taken,  which I had it not in my power to take, was ascribed to me.
I was the filching  cat, the ravenous dog, the dumb brute, who must bear all; for if I endeavoured  to exculpate me, I was silenced, without any enquiries being made, with  'Hold your tongue, you never tell truth.'
Even the very air I breathed was  tainted with scorn; for I was sent to the neighbouring shops with Glutton,  Liar, or Thief, written on my forehead.
This was, at first, the most bitter  punishment; but sullen pride, or a kind of stupid desperation, made me, at  length, almost regardless of the contempt, which had wrung from me so many  solitary tears at the only moments when I was allowed to rest.
"Thus was I the mark of cruelty till my sixteenth year; and then I have only to  point out a change of misery; for a period I never knew.
Allow me first to make  one observation.
Now I look back, I cannot help attributing the greater part of  my misery, to the misfortune of having been thrown into the world without the  grand support of life—a mother's affection.
I had no one to love me; or to  make me respected, to enable me to acquire respect.
I was an egg dropped on the  sand; a pauper by nature, hunted from family to family, who belonged to  nobody—and nobody cared for me.
I was despised from my birth, and denied the  chance of obtaining a footing for me in society.
Yes; I had not even the  chance of being considered as a fellow-creature—yet all the people with whom  I lived, brutalized as they were by the low cunning of trade, and the  despicable shifts of poverty, were not without bowels, though they never  yearned for me.
I was, in fact, born a slave, and chained by infamy to slavery  during the whole of existence, without having any companions to alleviate it by  sympathy, or teach me how to rise above it by sympathy example.
But, to resume the  thread of my tale— "At sixteen, I suddenly grew tall, and something like comeliness appeared on a  Sunday, when I had time to wash my face, and put on clean clothes.
My master  had once or twice caught hold of me in the passage; but I instinctively avoided  My master   disgusting caresses.
One day however, when the family were at a methodist  meeting, My master   contrived to be alone in the house with me, and by blows—yes;  blows and menaces, compelled me to submit to My master   ferocious desire; and, to  avoid my task-mistress's fury, I was obliged in future to comply, and skulk to my  loft at My master   command, in spite of increasing loathing.
"The anguish which was now pent up in my bosom, seemed to open a new world to  me: I began to extend my thoughts beyond me, and grieve for human misery,  till I discovered, with horror—ah!
what horror!—that I was with child.
I  know not why I felt a mixed sensation of despair and tenderness, excepting  that, ever called a bastard, a bastard appeared to me an object of the greatest  compassion in creation.
"I communicated this dreadful circumstance to my master, who was almost equally  alarmed at the intelligence; for he feared he wife, and public censure at a methodist  meeting.
After some weeks of deliberation had elapsed, I in continual fear that  my altered shape would be noticed, My master   gave me a medicine in a phial,  which My master   desired me to take, telling me, without any circumlocution, for what  purpose it was designed.
I burst into tears, I thought it was killing  me—yet was such a self as I worth preserving?
My master   cursed me for a fool,  and left me to my own reflections.
I could not resolve to take this infernal  potion; but I wrapped this infernal  potion up in an old gown, and hid this infernal  potion in a corner of my box.
"Nobody yet suspected me, because Nobody had been accustomed to view me as a  creature of another species.
But the threatening storm at last broke over my  devoted head—never shall I forget the threatening storm!
One Sunday evening when I was left, as  usual, to take care of the house, My master   came home intoxicated, and I became  the prey of My master   brutal appetite.
My master   extreme intoxication made My master   forget My master    customary caution, and my task-mistress entered and found us in a situation that  could not have been more hateful to my task-mistress than me.
my task-mistress husband was 'pot-valiant,'  Her husband feared my task-mistress not at the moment, nor had Her husband then much reason, for my task-mistress instantly  turned the whole force of my task-mistress anger another way.
my task-mistress tore off my cap,  scratched, kicked, and buffetted me, till my task-mistress had exhausted my task-mistress strength,  declaring, as my task-mistress rested my task-mistress arm, 'that I had wheedled Her husband from  her.—But, could any thing better be expected from a wretch, whom my task-mistress had  taken into my task-mistress house out of pure charity?'
What a torrent of abuse rushed out?
till, almost breathless, my task-mistress concluded with saying, 'that I was born a  strumpet; it ran in my blood, and nothing good could come to those who  harboured me.'
"My situation was, of course, discovered, and my task-mistress declared that I should not  stay another night under the same roof with an honest family.
I was therefore  pushed out of doors, and my trumpery thrown after me, when my trumpery had been  contemptuously examined in the passage, lest I should have stolen any thing.
"Behold me then in the street, utterly destitute!
Whither could I creep for  shelter?
To my father's  's roof I had no claim, when not pursued by shame—now I  shrunk back as from death, from my mother's cruel reproaches, my father's  execrations.
I could not endure to hear my mother's cruel reproaches, my father's  execrations curse the day I was born, though  life had been a curse to me.
Of death I thought, but with a confused emotion of  terror, as I stood leaning my head on a post, and starting at every footstep,  lest it should be my task-mistress coming to tear my heart out.
One of the boys of  the shop passing by, heard my tale, and immediately repaired to My master  , to  give his a description of my situation; and his touched the right key—the  scandal it would give rise to, if I were left to repeat my tale to every  enquirer.
This plea came home to This plea reason, who had been sobered by This plea wife's  rage, the fury of which fell on This plea when I was out of his wife's   reach, and This plea sent  the boy to me with half-a-guinea, desiring the boy to conduct me to a house, where  beggars, and other wretches, the refuse of society, nightly lodged.
"This night was spent in a state of stupefaction, or desperation.
I detested  mankind, and abhorred me.
"In the morning I ventured out, to throw me in My master  's way, at the boy  usual hour of going abroad.
I approached the boy, the boy 'damned me for a b——,  declared I had disturbed the peace of the family, and that the boy had sworn to the boy , never to take any more notice of me.'
the boy left me; but, instantly  returning, the boy told me that the boy should speak to the boy friend, a parish-officer, to  get a nurse for the brat I laid to the boy; and advised me, if I wished to keep out  of the house of correction, not to make free with the boy name.
"I hurried back to my hole, and, rage giving place to despair, sought for the  potion that was to procure abortion, and swallowed the  potion that was to procure abortion, with a wish that the  potion that was to procure abortion  might destroy me, at the same time that the  potion that was to procure abortion stopped the sensations of new-born  life, which I felt with indescribable emotion.
My head turned round, my heart  grew sick, and in the horrors of approaching dissolution, mental anguish was  swallowed up.
The effect of the medicine was violent, and I was confined to my  bed several days; but, youth and a strong constitution prevailing, I once more  crawled out, to ask myself the cruel question, 'Whither I should go?'
I had but  two shillings left in my pocket, the rest had been expended, by a poor woman  who slept in the same room, to pay for my lodging, and purchase the necessaries  of which a poor woman  who slept in the same room partook.
"With this wretch I went into the neighbouring streets to beg, and my  disconsolate appearance drew a few pence from the idle, enabling me still to  command a bed; till, recovering from my illness, and taught to put on my rags  to the best advantage, I was accosted from different motives, and yielded to  the desire of the brutes I met, with the same detestation that I had felt for  my still more brutal master.
I have since read in novels of the blandishments  of seduction, but I had not even the pleasure of being enticed into vice.
"I shall not," interrupted Jemima, "lead your imagination into all the scenes  of wretchedness and depravity, which I was condemned to view; or mark the  different stages of my debasing misery.
Fate dragged me through the very  kennels of society: I was still a slave, a bastard, a common property.
Become  familiar with vice, for I wish to conceal nothing from you, I picked the  pockets of the drunkards who abused me; and proved by my conduct, that I  deserved the epithets, with which the  pockets of the drunkards who abused me loaded me at moments when distrust ought  to cease.
"Detesting my nightly occupation, though valuing, if I may so use the word, my  independence, which only consisted in choosing the street in which I should  wander, or the roof, when I had money, in which I should hide my head, I was  some time before I could prevail on myself to accept of a place in a house of  ill fame, to which a girl, with whom I had accidentally conversed in the  street, had recommended me.
I had been hunted almost into a fever, by the  watchmen of the quarter of the town I frequented; one, whom I had unwittingly  offended, giving the word to the whole pack.
You can scarcely conceive the  tyranny exercised by these wretches: considering the  tyranny exercised by these wretches as the instruments  of the very laws the  tyranny exercised by these wretches violate, the pretext which steels the  tyranny exercised by these wretches conscience,  hardens the  tyranny exercised by these wretches heart.
Not content with receiving from us, outlaws of society  (let other women talk of favours) a brutal gratification gratuitously as a  privilege of office, other women extort a tithe of prostitution, and harrass with  threats the poor creatures whose occupation affords not the means to silence  the growl of avarice.
To escape from this persecution, I once more entered into  servitude.
"A life of comparative regularity restored my health; and—do not start—my  manners were improved, in a situation where vice sought to render itself  alluring, and taste was cultivated to fashion the person, if not to refine the  mind.
Besides, the common civility of speech, contrasted with the gross  vulgarity to which I had been accustomed, was something like the polish of  civilization.
I was not shut out from all intercourse of humanity.
Still I was  galled by the yoke of service, and my task-mistress often flying into violent fits  of passion, made me dread a sudden dismission, which I understood was always  the case.
I was therefore prevailed on, though I felt a horror of men, to  accept the offer of a gentleman, rather in the decline of years, to keep his  house, pleasantly situated in a little village near Hampstead.
"his was a man of great talents, and of brilliant wit; but, a worn-out votary of  voluptuousness, his desires became fastidious in proportion as his desires grew weak,  and the native tenderness of his heart was undermined by a vitiated  imagination.
A thoughtless career of libertinism and social enjoyment, had  injured his health to such a degree, that, whatever pleasure his conversation  afforded me (and my esteem was ensured by proofs of the generous humanity of  his disposition), the being his was purchasing it at a very dear rate.
With such a keen perception of the delicacies of sentiment, with an imagination  invigorated by the exercise of genius, how could his sink into the grossness of  sensuality!
"But, to pass over a subject which I recollect with pain, I must remark to you,  as an answer to your often-repeated question, 'Why my sentiments and language  were superior to my station?'
that I now began to read, to beguile the  tediousness of solitude, and to gratify an inquisitive, active mind.
I had  often, in my childhood, followed a ballad-singer, to hear the sequel of a  dismal story, though sure of being severely punished for delaying to return  with whatever I was sent to purchase.
I could just spell and put a sentence  together, and I listened to the various arguments, though often mingled with  obscenity, which occurred at the table where I was allowed to preside: for a  literary friend or two frequently came home with My master  , to dine and pass  the night.
Having lost the privileged respect of my sex, my presence, instead  of restraining, perhaps gave the reins to their tongues; still I had the  advantage of hearing discussions, from which, in the common course of life,  women are excluded.
"You may easily imagine, that it was only by degrees that I could comprehend  some of the subjects they investigated, or acquire from they reasoning what  might be termed a moral sense.
But my fondness of reading increasing, and My master   occasionally shutting My master   up in this retreat, for weeks together, to  write, I had many opportunities of improvement.
At first, considering money (I  was right!"
exclaimed Jemima, altering Jemima tone of voice) "as the only means,  after my loss of reputation, of obtaining respect, or even the toleration of  humanity, I had not the least scruple to secrete a part of the sums intrusted  to me, and to screen me from detection by a system of falshood.
But,  acquiring new principles, I began to have the ambition of returning to the  respectable part of society, and was weak enough to suppose it possible.
The  attention of my unassuming instructor, who, without being ignorant of his own  powers, possessed great simplicity of manners, strengthened the illusion.
Having sometimes caught up hints for thought, from my untutored remarks, he  often led me to discuss the subjects he was treating, and would read to me he  productions, previous to their publication, wishing to profit by the criticism  of unsophisticated feeling.
The aim of he writings was to touch the simple  springs of the heart; for he despised the would-be oracles, the self-elected  philosophers, who fright away fancy, while sifting each grain of thought to  prove that slowness of comprehension is wisdom.
"I should have distinguished this as a moment of sunshine, a happy period in my  life, had not the repugnance the disgusting libertinism of my protector  inspired, daily become more painful.—And, indeed, I soon did recollect this as  such with agony, when my protector   sudden death (for my protector   had recourse to the most  exhilarating cordials to keep up the convivial tone of my protector   spirits) again threw  me into the desert of human society.
Had my protector   had any time for reflection, I am  certain my protector   would have left the little property in my protector   power to me: but,  attacked by the fatal apoplexy in town, my protector   heir, a man of rigid morals,  brought my protector   with my protector   to take possession of the house and effects, before I  was even informed of my protector   death,—'to prevent,' as his wife's   took care indirectly to  tell me, 'such a creature as his wife's   supposed me to be, from purloining any of  them, had I been apprized of the event in time.'
"The grief I felt at the sudden shock the information gave me, which at first  had nothing selfish in the information, was treated with contempt, and I was ordered to pack  up my clothes; and a few trinkets and books, given me by the generous deceased,  were contested, while The grief I felt at the sudden shock the information gave me, which at first  had nothing selfish in it piously hoped, with a reprobating shake of the head,  'that God would have mercy on God sinful soul!'
With some difficulty, I  obtained my arrears of wages; but asking—such is the spirit-grinding  consequence of poverty and infamy—for a character for honesty and economy,  which God knows I merited, I was told by this—why must I call her  woman?—'that it would go against her conscience to recommend a kept  mistress.'
Tears started in my eyes, burning tears; for there are situations in  which a wretch is humbled by the contempt they are conscious they do not  deserve.
"I returned to the metropolis; but the solitude of a poor lodging was  inconceivably dreary, after the society I had enjoyed.
To be cut off from human  converse, now I had been taught to relish it, was to wander a ghost among the  living.
Besides, I foresaw, to aggravate the severity of my fate, that my  little pittance would soon melt away.
I endeavoured to obtain needlework; but,  not having been taught early, and my hands being rendered clumsy by hard work,  I did not sufficiently excel to be employed by the ready-made linen shops, when  so many women, better qualified, were suing for hard work.
The want of a character  prevented my getting a place; for, irksome as servitude would have been to me,  I should have made another trial, had another trial been feasible.
Not that I disliked  employment, but the inequality of condition to which I must have submitted.
I  had acquired a taste for literature, during the five years I had lived with a  literary man, occasionally conversing with men of the first abilities of the  age; and now to descend to the lowest vulgarity, was a degree of wretchedness  not to be imagined unfelt.
I had not, it is true, tasted the charms of  affection, but I had been familiar with the graces of humanity.
"One of the gentlemen, whom I had frequently dined in company with, while I was  treated like a companion, met me in the street, and enquired after my health.
I  seized the occasion, and began to describe my situation; but he was in haste to  join, at dinner, a select party of choice spirits; therefore, without waiting  to hear me, he impatiently put a guinea into my hand, saying, 'a guinea was a pity  such a sensible woman should be in distress—he wished me well from he soul.'
"To another I wrote, stating my case, and requesting advice.
he was an advocate  for unequivocal sincerity; and had often, in my presence, descanted on the  evils which arise in society from the despotism of rank and riches.
"In reply, I received a long essay on the energy of the human mind, with  continual allusions to he own force of character.
he added, 'That the woman  who could write such a letter as I had sent he, could never be in want of  resources, were she to look into she, and exert she powers; misery was the  consequence of indolence, and, as to my being shut out from society, it was the  lot of man to submit to certain privations.'
"How often have I heard," said Jemima, interrupting Jemima narrative, "in  conversation, and read in books, that every person willing to work may find  employment?
It is the vague assertion, I believe, of insensible indolence, when  it relates to men; but, with respect to women, I am sure of it fallacy, unless  women will submit to the most menial bodily labour; and even to be employed at  hard labour is out of the reach of many, whose reputation misfortune or folly  has tainted.
"How writers, professing to be friends to freedom, and the improvement of  morals, can assert that poverty is no evil, I cannot imagine."
"No more can I," interrupted Maria, "yet they even expatiate on the peculiar  happiness of indigence, though in what it can consist, excepting in brutal  rest, when a man can barely earn a subsistence, I cannot imagine.
The mind is  necessarily imprisoned in The mind own little tenement; and, fully occupied by  keeping The mind in repair, has not time to rove abroad for improvement.
The book of  knowledge is closely clasped, against those who must fulfil their daily task of  severe manual labour or die; and curiosity, rarely excited by thought or  information, seldom moves on the stagnate lake of ignorance."
"As far as I have been able to observe," replied Jemima, "prejudices, caught up  by chance, are obstinately maintained by the poor, to the exclusion of  improvement; they have not time to reason or reflect to any extent, or minds  sufficiently exercised to adopt the principles of action, which form perhaps  the only basis of contentment in every station.
"*      * The copy which appears to have received the author's      last corrections, ends at this place.
[Godwin's note] "And independence," said Darnford, "they are necessarily strangers to, even the  independence of despising they persecutors.
If the poor are happy, or can be  happy, things are very well as things are.
And I cannot conceive on what  principle those writers contend for a change of system, who support this  opinion.
The authors on the other side of the question are much more  consistent, who grant the fact; yet, insisting that it is the lot of the  majority to be oppressed in this life, kindly turn the  majority to be oppressed in this life over to another, to  rectify the false weights and measures of this, as the only way to justify the  dispensations of Providence.
I have not," continued Darnford, "an opinion more  firmly fixed by observation in my mind, than that, though riches may fail to  produce proportionate happiness, poverty most commonly excludes it, by shutting  up all the avenues to improvement."
"And as for the affections," added Maria, with a sigh, "how gross, and even  tormenting do they become, unless regulated by an improving mind!
The culture  of the heart ever, I believe, keeps pace with that of the mind.
But pray go  on," addressing Jemima, "though your narrative gives rise to the most painful  reflections on the present state of society."
"Not to trouble you," continued she, "with a detailed description of all the  painful feelings of unavailing exertion, I have only to tell you, that at last  I got recommended to wash in a few families, who did me the favour to admit me  into their houses, without the most strict enquiry, to wash from one in the  morning till eight at night, for eighteen or twenty-pence a day.
On the  happiness to be enjoyed over a washing-tub I need not comment; yet you will  allow me to observe, that this was a wretchedness of situation peculiar to my  sex.
A man with half my industry, and, I may say, abilities, could have  procured a decent livelihood, and discharged some of the duties which knit  mankind together; whilst I, who had acquired a taste for the rational, nay, in  honest pride let me assert it, the virtuous enjoyments of life, was cast aside  as the filth of society.
Condemned to labour, like a machine, only to earn  bread, and scarcely that, I became melancholy and desperate.
"I have now to mention a circumstance which fills me with remorse, and fear it  will entirely deprive me of your esteem.
A tradesman became attached to me, and  visited me frequently,—and I at last obtained such a power over A tradesman, that A tradesman  offered to take me home to A tradesman house.—Consider, dear madam, I was famishing:  wonder not that I became a wolf!—The only reason for not taking me home  immediately, was the having a girl in the house, with child by him—and this  girl—I advised him—yes, I did!
would I could forget it!—to turn out of  doors: and one night him determined to follow my advice.
Poor wretch!
this  girl fell  upon this  girl knees, reminded him that him had promised to marry this  girl, that this  girl  parents were honest!—What did it avail?—She was turned out.
"this  girl approached this  girl father's door, in the skirts of London,—listened at the  shutters,—but could not knock.
A watchman had observed this  girl go and return  several times—Poor wretch!—[The remorse Jemima spoke of, seemed to be  stinging Jemima to the soul, as Jemima proceeded.]
"Jemima left it, and, approaching a tub where horses were watered, Jemima sat down in  it, and, with desperate resolution, remained in that attitude—till resolution  was no longer necessary!
"I happened that morning to be going out to wash, anticipating the moment when  I should escape from such hard labour.
I passed by, just as some men, going to  work, drew out the stiff, cold corpse—Let me not recall the horrid  moment!—I recognized Jemima pale visage; I listened to the tale told by the  spectators, and my heart did not burst.
I thought of my own state, and wondered  how I could be such a monster!—I worked hard; and, returning home, I was  attacked by a fever.
I suffered both in body and mind.
I determined not to live  with the wretch.
But he did not try me; he left the neighbourhood.
I once more  returned to the wash-tub.
"Still my own state, miserable as it was, admitted of aggravation.
Lifting one  day a heavy load, a tub fell against my shin, and gave me great pain.
I did not  pay much attention to the hurt, till it became a serious wound; being obliged  to work as usual, or starve.
But, finding myself at length unable to stand for  any time, I thought of getting into an hospital.
Hospitals, it should seem (for  Hospitals are comfortless abodes for the sick) were expressly endowed for the  reception of the friendless; yet I, who had on that plea a right to assistance,  wanted the recommendation of the rich and respectable, and was several weeks  languishing for admittance; fees were demanded on entering; and, what was still  more unreasonable, security for burying me, that expence not coming into the  letter of the charity.
A guinea was the stipulated sum—I could as soon have  raised a million; and I was afraid to apply to the parish for an order, lest  the parish should have passed me, I knew not whither.
The poor woman at whose house I  lodged, compassionating my state, got me into an hospital; and the family  where I received the hurt, sent me five shillings, three and six-pence of which  I gave at my admittance—I know not for what.
"My leg grew quickly better; but I was dismissed before my cure was completed,  because I could not afford to have my linen washed to appear decently, as the  virago of a nurse said, when the gentlemen (the surgeons) came.
I cannot give  you an adequate idea of the wretchedness of an hospital; every thing is left to  the care of people intent on gain.
The attendants seem to have lost all feeling  of compassion in the bustling discharge of The attendants offices; death is so familiar  to The attendants, that The attendants are not anxious to ward it off.
Every thing appeared to be  conducted for the accommodation of the medical men and their pupils, who came  to make experiments on the poor, for the benefit of the rich.
One of the  physicians, I must not forget to mention, gave me half-a-crown, and ordered me  some wine, when I was at the lowest ebb.
I thought of making my case known to  the lady-like matron; but the lady-like matron forbidding countenance prevented me.
the lady-like matron  condescended to look on the patients, and make general enquiries, two or three  times a week; but the nurses knew the hour when the visit of ceremony would  commence, and every thing was as it should be.
"After my dismission, I was more at a loss than ever for a subsistence, and,  not to weary you with a repetition of the same unavailing attempts, unable to  stand at the washing-tub, I began to consider the rich and poor as natural  enemies, and became a thief from principle.
I could not now cease to reason,  but I hated mankind.
I despised myself, yet I justified my conduct.
I was  taken, tried, and condemned to six months' imprisonment in a house of  correction.
My soul recoils with horror from the remembrance of the insults I  had to endure, till, branded with shame, I was turned loose in the street,  pennyless.
I wandered from street to street, till, exhausted by hunger and  fatigue, I sunk down senseless at a door, where I had vainly demanded a morsel  of bread.
I was sent by the inhabitant to the work-house, to which he had  surlily bid me go, saying, he 'paid enough in conscience to the poor,' when,  with parched tongue, I implored he charity.
If those well-meaning people who  exclaim against beggars, were acquainted with the treatment the poor receive in  many of these wretched asylums, those well-meaning people who  exclaim against beggars, were acquainted with the treatment the poor receive in  many of these wretched asylums would not stifle so easily involuntary  sympathy, by saying that those well-meaning people who  exclaim against beggars, were acquainted with the treatment the poor receive in  many of these wretched asylums have all parishes to go to, or wonder that the  poor dread to enter the gloomy walls.
What are the common run of workhouses,  but prisons, in which many respectable old people, worn out by immoderate  labour, sink into the grave in sorrow, to which they are carried like dogs!"
Alarmed by some indistinct noise, Jemima rose hastily to listen, and Maria,  turning to Darnford, said, "I have indeed been shocked beyond expression when I  have met a pauper's funeral.
A coffin carried on the shoulders of three or four  ill-looking wretches, whom the imagination might easily convert into a band of  assassins, hastening to conceal the corpse, and quarrelling about the prey on  their way.
I know it is of little consequence how we are consigned to the  earth; but I am led by this brutal insensibility, to what even the animal  creation appears forcibly to feel, to advert to the wretched, deserted manner  in which they died."
"True," rejoined Darnford, "and, till the rich will give more than a part of  they wealth, till they will give time and attention to the wants of the  distressed, never let they boast of charity.
Let they open they hearts, and  not they purses, and employ they minds in the service, if they are really  actuated by humanity; or charitable institutions will always be the prey of the  lowest order of knaves."
Jemima returning, seemed in haste to finish Jemima tale.
"The overseer farmed the  poor of different parishes, and out of the bowels of poverty was wrung the  money with which The overseer purchased this dwelling, as a private receptacle for  madness.
The overseer had been a keeper at a house of the same description, and conceived  that The overseer could make money much more readily in The overseer old occupation.
The overseer is a  shrewd—shall I say it?—villain.
The overseer observed something resolute in my  manner, and offered to take me with The overseer, and instruct me how to treat the  disturbed minds The overseer meant to intrust to my care.
The offer of forty pounds a  year, and to quit a workhouse, was not to be despised, though the condition of  shutting my eyes and hardening my heart was annexed to my eyes.
"I agreed to accompany The overseer; and four years have I been attendant on many  wretches, and"—she lowered her voice,—"the witness of many enormities.
In  solitude my mind seemed to recover   force, and many of the sentiments which  I imbibed in the only tolerable period of my life, returned with their full  force.
Still what should induce me to be the champion for suffering  humanity?—Who ever risked any thing for me?—Who ever acknowledged me to be  a fellow-creature?
"— Maria took a fellow-creature?
"— Maria hand, and Jemima, more overcome by kindness than a fellow-creature?
"— Maria had ever  been by cruelty, hastened out of the room to conceal a fellow-creature?
"— Maria emotions.
Darnford soon after heard Darnford summons, and, taking leave of Darnford, a fellow-creature?
"— Maria promised  to gratify Darnford curiosity, with respect to a fellow-creature?
"— Maria, the first opportunity.
