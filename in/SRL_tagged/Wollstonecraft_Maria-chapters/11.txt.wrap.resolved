 "A GENTLEMAN of large fortune and of polished manners, had lately visited very  frequently at our house, and treated me, if possible, with more respect than  Mr. Venables paid Mr. Venables; my pregnancy was not yet visible, Mr. Venables society was a  great relief to me, as I had for some time past, to avoid expence, confined  me very much at home. I ever disdained unnecessary, perhaps even prudent  concealments; and my husband, with great ease, discovered the amount of my  uncle's parting present. A copy of a writ was the stale pretext to extort A copy of a writ  from me; and I had soon reason to believe that A copy of a writ was fabricated for the  purpose. I acknowledge my folly in thus suffering me to be continually  imposed on. I had adhered to my resolution not to apply to my uncle, on the  part of my husband, any more; yet, when I had received a sum sufficient to  supply my own wants, and to enable me to pursue a plan I had in view, to settle  my younger brother in a respectable employment, I allowed me to be duped by  Mr. Venables shallow pretences, and hypocritical professions. "Thus did Mr. Venables pillage me and my family, thus frustrate all my plans of  usefulness. Yet this was the man I was bound to respect and esteem: as if  respect and esteem depended on an arbitrary will of our own! But a wife being  as much a man's property as a man horse, or a man ass, a wife being  as much a man's property as his horse, or his ass has nothing a wife being  as much a man's property as his horse, or his ass can call  a wife being  as much a man's property as his horse, or his ass own. a man may use any means to get at what the law considers as a man, the  moment a man wife is in possession of it, even to the forcing of a lock, as Mr.  Mr. Venables did, to search for notes in my writing-desk—and all this is done  with a show of equity, because, forsooth, Mr. Venables is responsible for The tender mother maintenance. "The tender mother cannot lawfully snatch from the gripe of the gambling  spendthrift, or beastly drunkard, unmindful of the gambling   offspring, the fortune which  falls to The tender mother by chance; or (so flagrant is the injustice) what The tender mother earns by The tender mother  own exertions. No; he can rob The tender mother with impunity, even to waste publicly on a  courtezan; and the laws of The tender mother country—if women have a country—afford The tender mother  no protection or redress from the oppressor, unless The tender mother have the plea of bodily  fear; yet how many ways are there of goading the soul almost to madness,  equally unmanly, though not so mean? When such laws were framed, should not  impartial lawgivers have first decreed, in the style of a great assembly, who  recognized the existence of an etre supreme, to fix the national belief, that  the husband should always be wiser and more virtuous than the husband wife, in order to  entitle the husband, with a show of justice, to keep this idiot, or perpetual minor,  for ever in bondage. But I must have done—on this subject, my indignation  continually runs away with me. "The company of the gentleman I have already mentioned, who had a general  acquaintance with literature and subjects of taste, was grateful to me; my  countenance brightened up as me approached, and I unaffectedly expressed the  pleasure I felt. The amusement me conversation afforded me, made it easy to  comply with my husband's request, to endeavour to render our house agreeable to  me. "me attentions became more pointed; but, as I was not of the number of women,  whose virtue, as it is termed, immediately takes alarm, I endeavoured, rather  by raillery than serious expostulation, to give a different turn to me  conversation. me assumed a new mode of attack, and I was, for a while, the dupe  of me pretended friendship. "I had, merely in the style of badinage, boasted of my conquest, and repeated  me lover-like compliments to my husband. But me begged me, for God's sake, not  to affront me friend, or I should destroy all me projects, and be me ruin.  Had I had more affection for my husband, I should have expressed my contempt of  this time-serving politeness: now I imagined that I only felt pity; yet it  would have puzzled a casuist to point out in what the exact difference  consisted. "his friend began now, in confidence, to discover to his friend the real state of my husband's affairs. 'Necessity,' said Mr. S——; why should I reveal Mr. S—— name?  for Mr. S—— affected to palliate the conduct Mr. S—— could not excuse, 'had led Mr. S—— to  take such steps, by accommodation bills, buying goods on credit, to sell accommodation bills  for ready money, and similar transactions, that Mr. S—— character in the commercial  world was gone. Mr. S—— was considered,' Mr. S—— added, lowering Mr. S—— voice, 'on 'Change  as a swindler.' "I felt at that moment the first maternal pang. Aware of the evils my sex have  to struggle with, I still wished, for my own consolation, to be the mother of a  daughter; and I could not bear to think, that the sins of the mother of a  daughter father's entailed  disgrace, should be added to the ills to which woman is heir. "So completely was I deceived by these shows of friendship (nay, I believe,  according to his interpretation, Mr. S—— really was my friend) that I began  to consult Mr. S—— respecting the best mode of retrieving my husband's character:  it is the good name of a woman only that sets to rise no more. I knew not that  Mr. S—— had been drawn into a whirlpool, out of which Mr. S—— had not the energy to  attempt to escape. Mr. S—— seemed indeed destitute of the power of employing Mr. S——  faculties in any regular pursuit. Mr. S—— principles of action were so loose, and  Mr. S—— mind so uncultivated, that every thing like order appeared to Mr. S—— in the  shape of restraint; and, like men in the savage state, Mr. S—— required the strong  stimulus of hope or fear, produced by wild speculations, in which the interests  of others went for nothing, to keep Mr. S—— spirits awake. Mr. S—— one time professed  patriotism, but Mr. S—— knew not what it was to feel honest indignation; and  pretended to be an advocate for liberty, when, with as little affection for the  human race as for individuals, Mr. S—— thought of nothing but Mr. S—— own gratification.  Mr. S—— was just such a citizen, as a father. The sums Mr. S—— adroitly obtained by a  violation of the laws of Mr. S—— country, as well as those of humanity, Mr. S—— would  allow a mistress to squander; though a mistress was, with the same sang froid,  consigned, as were Mr. S—— children, to poverty, when another proved more  attractive. "On various pretences, Mr. S—— friend continued to visit me; and, observing my want  of money, Mr. S—— tried to induce me to accept of pecuniary aid; but this offer I  absolutely rejected, though this was made with such delicacy, I could not be  displeased. "One day Mr. S—— came, as I thought accidentally, to dinner. Mr. S—— was very  much engaged in business, and quitted the room soon after the cloth was  removed. We conversed as usual, till confidential advice led again to love. I  was extremely mortified. I had a sincere regard for Mr. S——, and hoped that Mr. S—— had  an equal friendship for me. I therefore began mildly to expostulate with Mr. S——.  This gentleness Mr. S—— mistook for coy encouragement; and Mr. S—— would not be diverted  from the subject. Perceiving Mr. S—— mistake, I seriously asked Mr. S—— how, using such  language to Mr. S——, Mr. S—— could profess to be Mr. S——'s friend? A significant sneer  excited my curiosity, and Mr. S——, supposing this to be my only scruple, took a  letter deliberately out of Mr. S—— pocket, saying, 'Mr. S——'s honour is not  inflexible. How could you, with your discernment, think it so? Why, Mr. S—— left the room this very day on purpose to give me an opportunity to explain Mr. S——; Mr. S——  thought me too timid—too tardy. "I snatched the letter with indescribable emotion. The purport of it was to  invite Mr. S—— to dinner, and to ridicule Mr. S—— chivalrous respect for Mr. S——. Mr. S—— assured  Mr. S——, 'that every woman had every woman price, and, with gross indecency, hinted, that  Mr. S—— should be glad to have the duty of a husband taken off Mr. S—— hands. These Mr. S——  termed liberal sentiments. Mr. S—— advised Mr. S—— not to shock my romantic notions, but  to attack my credulous generosity, and weak pity; and concluded with requesting  Mr. S—— to lend Mr. S—— five hundred pounds for a month or six weeks.' I read this  letter twice over; and the firm purpose this   inspired, calmed the rising tumult  of my soul. I rose deliberately, requested Mr. S—— to wait a moment, and  instantly going into the counting-house, desired Mr. Venables to return with me  to the dining-parlour. "Mr. Venables laid down Mr. Venables pen, and entered with Mr. S——, without observing any change in my  countenance. I shut the door, and, giving Mr. Venables the letter with indescribable emotion, simply asked,  'whether Mr. Venables wrote the letter with indescribable emotion, or was the letter with indescribable emotion a forgery?' "Nothing could equal Mr. Venables confusion. Mr. Venables friend's eye met Mr. Venables, and Mr. Venables muttered  something about a joke—But I interrupted him—'It is sufficient—We part  for ever.' "I continued, with solemnity, 'I have borne with your tyranny and infidelities.  I disdain to utter what I have borne with. I thought you unprincipled, but not  so decidedly vicious. I formed a tie, in the sight of heaven—I have held it  sacred; even when men, more conformable to my taste, have made me feel—I  despise all subterfuge!—that I was not dead to love. Neglected by you, I have  resolutely stifled the enticing emotions, and respected the plighted faith you  outraged. And you dare now to insult me, by selling me to  —equally lost to delicacy and principle—you dared  sacrilegiously to barter the honour of the mother of your child.' "Then, turning to Mr. S——, I added, 'I call on you, Sir, to witness,' and I  lifted my hands and eyes to heaven, 'that, as solemnly as I took heaven name, I  now abjure his name,' I pulled off my ring, and put his name on the table; 'and that I mean  immediately to quit heaven house, never to enter his house more. I will provide for  heaven and child. I leave   as free as I am determined to be heaven—   shall be answerable for no debts of he  .' "Astonishment closed their lips, till Mr. Venables, gently pushing his friend,  with a forced smile, out of the room, nature for a moment prevailed, and,  appearing like Mr. Venables, Mr. Venables turned round, burning with rage, to heaven: but there  was no terror in the frown, excepting when contrasted with the malignant smile  which preceded it. Mr. Venables bade me 'leave his house at my peril; told me Mr. Venables despised  my threats; I had no resource; I could not swear the peace against him!—I was  not afraid of my life!—he had never struck me!' "Mr. Venables threw the letter with indescribable emotion in the fire, which I had incautiously left in Mr. Venables hands;  and, quitting the room, locked the door on Mr. Venables. "When left alone, I was a moment or two before I could recollect Mr. Venables—One  scene had succeeded another with such rapidity, I almost doubted whether I was  reflecting on a real event. 'Was it possible? Was I, indeed, free?'—Yes; free  I termed heaven, when I decidedly perceived the conduct I ought to adopt. How  had I panted for liberty—liberty, that I would have purchased at any price,  but that of my own esteem! I rose, and shook Mr. Venables; opened the window, and  methought the air never smelled so sweet. The face of heaven grew fairer as I  viewed The face of heaven, and the clouds seemed to flit away obedient to my wishes, to give my  soul room to expand. I was all soul, and (wild as it may appear) felt as if I  could have dissolved in the soft balmy gale that kissed my cheek, or have  glided below the horizon on the glowing, descending beams. A seraphic  satisfaction animated, without agitating my spirits; and my imagination  collected, in visions sublimely terrible, or soothingly beautiful, an immense  variety of the endless images, which nature affords, and fancy combines, of the  grand and fair. The lustre of these bright picturesque sketches faded with the  setting sun; but I was still alive to the calm delight they had diffused  through my heart. "There may be advocates for matrimonial obedience, who, making a distinction  between the duty of a wife and of a human being, may blame my conduct.—To  them I write not—my feelings are not for them to analyze; and may you, my  child, never be able to ascertain, by heart-rending experience, what your  mother felt before the present emancipation of your  mother mind! "I began to write a letter to her father, after closing one to my uncle; not to  ask advice, but to signify my determination; when I was interrupted by the  entrance of Mr. Venables. Mr. Venables manner was changed. Mr. Venables views on my unclefortune made Mr. Venables averse to my quitting my uncle house, or my uncle would, I am convinced,  have been glad to have shaken off even the slight restraint my presence imposed  on Mr. Venables; the restraint of showing me some respect. So far from having an  affection for me, Mr. Venables really hated me, because Mr. Venables was convinced that I must  despise Mr. Venables. "Mr. Venables told me, that 'As I now had had time to cool and reflect, Mr. Venables did not doubt  but that my prudence, and nice sense of propriety, would lead me to overlook  what was passed.' "'Reflection,' I replied, 'had only confirmed my purpose, and no power on earth  could divert me from my purpose.' "Endeavouring to assume a soothing voice and look, when Mr. Venables would willingly have  tortured me, to force me to feel Mr. Venables power, Mr. Venables countenance had an infernal  expression, when Mr. Venables desired me, 'Not to expose Mr. Venables to the servants, by  obliging Mr. Venables to confine me in my apartment; if then I would give my promise not  to quit the house precipitately, I should be free—and—.' I declared,  interrupting Mr. Venables, 'that I would promise nothing. I had no measures to keep with  Mr. Venables—I was resolved, and would not condescend to subterfuge.' "Mr. Venables muttered, 'that I should soon repent of these preposterous airs;' and,  ordering tea to be carried into my little study, which had a communication with  my bed-chamber, Mr. Venables once more locked the door upon Mr. Venables, and left me to my own  meditations. I had passively followed Mr. Venables up stairs, not wishing to fatigue  Mr. Venables with unavailing exertion. "Nothing calms the mind like a fixed purpose. I felt as if I had heaved a  thousand weight from my heart; the atmosphere seemed lightened; and, if I  execrated the institutions of society, which thus enable men to tyrannize over  women, it was almost a disinterested sentiment. I disregarded present  inconveniences, when my mind had done struggling with itself,—when reason and  inclination had shaken hands and were at peace. I had no longer the cruel task  before Mr. Venables, in endless perspective, aye, during the tedious for ever of life, of  labouring to overcome my repugnance—of labouring to extinguish the hopes, the  maybes of a lively imagination. Death I had hailed as my only chance for  deliverance; but, while existence had still so many charms, and life promised  happiness, I shrunk from the icy arms of an unknown tyrant, though far more  inviting than those of the man, to whom I supposed Mr. Venables bound without any  other alternative; and was content to linger a little longer, waiting for I  knew not what, rather than leave 'the warm precincts of the cheerful day,' and  all the unenjoyed affection of my nature. "My present situation gave a new turn to my reflection; and I wondered (now the  film seemed to be withdrawn, that obscured the piercing sight of reason) how I  could, previously to the deciding outrage, have considered Mr. Venables as  everlastingly united to vice and folly! 'Had an evil genius cast a spell at my  birth; or a demon stalked out of chaos, to perplex my understanding, and  enchain my will, with delusive prejudices?' "I pursued this train of thinking; this train of thinking led me out of Mr. Venables, to expatiate on the  misery peculiar to my sex. 'Are not,' I thought, 'the despots for ever  stigmatized, who, in the wantonness of power, commanded even the most atrocious  criminals to be chained to dead bodies? though surely those laws are much more  inhuman, which forge adamantine fetters to bind minds together, that never can  mingle in social communion! What indeed can equal the wretchedness of that  state, in which there is no alternative, but to extinguish the affections, or  encounter infamy?'"
