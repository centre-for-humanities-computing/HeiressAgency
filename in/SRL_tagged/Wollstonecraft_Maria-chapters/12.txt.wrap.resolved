 "TOWARDS midnight Mr. Venables entered my chamber; and, with calm audacity  preparing to go to bed, Mr. Venables bade me make haste, 'for that was the best place for  husbands and wives to end  husbands and wives differences. Mr. Venables had been drinking plentifully  to aid Mr. Venables courage. "I did not at first deign to reply. But perceiving that Mr. Venables affected to take my  silence for consent, I told Mr. Venables that, 'If Mr. Venables would not go to another bed, or  allow me, I should sit up in my study all night.' Mr. Venables attempted to pull me into  my chamber, half joking. But I resisted; and, as Mr. Venables had determined not to give  me any reason for saying that Mr. Venables used violence, after a few more efforts, Mr. Venables  retired, cursing my obstinacy, to bed. "I sat musing some time longer; then, throwing my cloak around me, prepared for  sleep on a sopha. And, so fortunate seemed my deliverance, so sacred the  pleasure of being thus wrapped up in me, that I slept profoundly, and woke  with a mind composed to encounter the struggles of the day. Mr. Venables did  not wake till some hours after; and then Mr. Venables came to me half-dressed, yawning  and stretching, with haggard eyes, as if Mr. Venables scarcely recollected what had  passed the preceding evening. Mr. Venables fixed Mr. Venables eyes on me for a moment, then,  calling me a fool, asked 'How long I intended to continue this pretty farce?  For Mr. Venables part, Mr. Venables was devilish sick of his part; but this was the plague of marrying  women who pretended to know something.' "I made no other reply to this harangue, than to say, 'That Mr. Venables ought to be glad  to get rid of a woman so unfit to be Mr. Venables companion—and that any change in my  conduct would be mean dissimulation; for maturer reflection only gave the  sacred seal of reason to my first resolution.' "Mr. Venables looked as if Mr. Venables could have stamped with impatience, at being obliged to  stifle Mr. Venables rage; but, conquering Mr. Venables anger (for weak people, whose passions  seem the most ungovernable, restrain weak people, whose passions  seem the most ungovernable with the greatest ease, when weak people, whose passions  seem the most ungovernable  have a sufficient motive), Mr. Venables exclaimed, 'Very pretty, upon my soul! very  pretty, theatrical flourishes! Pray, fair Roxana, stoop from your altitudes,  and remember that you are acting a part in real life.' "Mr. Venables uttered this speech with a self-satisfied air, and went down stairs to  dress. "In about an hour Mr. Venables came to Mr. Venables again; and in the same tone said, 'That Mr. Venables came  as my gentleman-usher to hand me down to breakfast. "'Of the black rod?' asked I. "This question, and the tone in which I asked it, a little disconcerted Mr. Venables. To  say the truth, I now felt no resentment; my firm resolution to free Mr. Venables from  my ignoble thraldom, had absorbed the various emotions which, during six years,  had racked my soul. The duty pointed out by my principles seemed clear; and not  one tender feeling intruded to make me swerve: The dislike which my husband had  inspired was strong; but The dislike which my husband had  inspired only led me to wish to avoid, to wish to let my husband  drop out of my memory; there was no misery, no torture that I would not  deliberately have chosen, rather than renew my lease of servitude. "During the breakfast, my husband attempted to reason with Mr. Venables on the folly of romantic  sentiments; for this was the indiscriminate epithet my husband gave to every mode of  conduct or thinking superior to my husband own. my husband asserted, 'that all the world were  governed by all the world own interest; those who pretended to be actuated by different  motives, were only deeper knaves, or fools crazed by books, who took for gospel  all the rodomantade nonsense written by men who knew nothing of the world. For  his part, his thanked God, his was no hypocrite; and, if his stretched a point  sometimes, it was always with an intention of paying every man his own.' "his then artfully insinuated, 'that his daily expected a vessel to arrive, a  successful speculation, that would make his easy for the present, and that his  had several other schemes actually depending, that could not fail. his had no  doubt of becoming rich in a few years, though his had been thrown back by some  unlucky adventures at the setting out.' "I mildly replied, 'That I wished his might not involve his still deeper.' "his had no notion that I was governed by a decision of judgment, not to be  compared with a mere spurt of resentment. his knew not what it was to feel  indignation against vice, and often boasted of his placable temper, and  readiness to forgive injuries. True; for his only considered the being deceived,  as an effort of skill his had not guarded against; and then, with a cant of  candour, would observe, 'that his did not know how his might his have been  tempted to act in the same circumstances.' And, as his heart never opened to  friendship, it never was wounded by disappointment. Every new acquaintance his  protested, it is true, was 'the cleverest fellow in the world; and his really  thought so; till the novelty of his conversation or manners ceased to have any  effect on his sluggish spirits. his respect for rank or fortune was more  permanent, though his chanced to have no design of availing his of the  influence of either to promote his own views. "After a prefatory conversation,—my blood (I thought a prefatory conversation,—my blood had been cooler)  flushed over my whole countenance as his spoke—his alluded to my situation. his  desired me to reflect—'and act like a prudent woman, as the best proof of my  superior understanding; for his must own I had sense, did I know how to use a prefatory conversation,—my blood.  I was not,' his laid a stress on his words, 'without my passions; and a husband  was a convenient cloke.—He was liberal in his way of thinking; and why might  not we, like many other married people, who were above vulgar prejudices,  tacitly consent to let each other follow many other married people, who were above vulgar prejudices,   own inclination?—He meant  nothing more, in the letter I made the ground of complaint; and the pleasure  which I seemed to take in Mr. S.'s company, led his to conclude, that his was  not disagreeable to his.' "A clerk brought in the letters of the day, and I, as I often did, while his was  discussing subjects of business, went to the piano forte, and began to play a  favourite air to restore his, as a  favourite air were, to nature, and drive the  sophisticated sentiments I had just been obliged to listen to, out of my soul. "They had excited sensations similar to those I have felt, in viewing the  squalid inhabitants of some of the lanes and back streets of the metropolis,  mortified at being compelled to consider They as my fellow-creatures, as if an  ape had claimed kindred with his. Or, as when surrounded by a mephitical fog, I  have wished to have a volley of cannon fired, to clear the incumbered  atmosphere, and give me room to breathe and move. "My spirits were all in arms, and I played a kind of extemporary prelude. The  cadence was probably wild and impassioned, while, lost in thought, I made the  sounds a kind of echo to my train of thinking. "Pausing for a moment, I met Mr. Venables' eyes. Mr. Venables' was observing me with an  air of conceited satisfaction, as much as to say—'My last insinuation has  done the business—she begins to know she own interest.' Then gathering up Mr. Venables'  letters, Mr. Venables' said, 'That Mr. Venables' hoped Mr. Venables' should hear no more romantic stuff, well  enough in a miss just come from boarding school;' and went, as was Mr. Venables' custom,  to the counting-house. I still continued playing; and, turning to a sprightly  lesson, I executed it with uncommon vivacity. I heard footsteps approach the  door, and was soon convinced that Mr. Venables' was listening; the consciousness  only gave more animation to my fingers. Mr. Venables' went down into the kitchen, and the  cook, probably by Mr. Venables' desire, came to Mr. Venables', to know what I would please to order  for dinner. Mr. Venables' came into the parlour again, with apparent  carelessness. I perceived that the cunning man was overreaching the cunning man; and I  gave my directions as usual, and left the room. "While I was making some alteration in my dress, Mr. Venables' peeped in, and,  begging my pardon for interrupting me, disappeared. I took up some work (I  could not read), and two or three messages were sent to Mr. Venables', probably for no  other purpose, but to enable Mr. Venables' to ascertain what I was about. "I listened whenever I heard the street-door open; at last I imagined I could  distinguish Mr. Venables' step, going out. I laid aside some work (I  could not read); my heart  palpitated; still I was afraid hastily to enquire; and I waited a long half  hour, before I ventured to ask the boy whether the boy master was in the  counting-house? "Being answered in the negative, I bade the boy call me a coach, and collecting a  few necessaries hastily together, with a little parcel of letters and papers  which I had collected the preceding evening, I hurried into the preceding evening, desiring the  coachman to drive to a distant part of the town. "I almost feared that the coach would break down before I got out of the  street; and, when I turned the corner, I seemed to breathe a freer air. I was  ready to imagine that I was rising above the thick atmosphere of earth; or I  felt, as wearied souls might be supposed to feel on entering another state of  existence. "I stopped at one or two stands of coaches to elude pursuit, and then drove  round the skirts of the town to seek for an obscure lodging, where I wished to  remain concealed, till I could avail myself of my uncle's protection. I had  resolved to assume my own name immediately, and openly to avow my  determination, without any formal vindication, the moment I had found a home,  in which I could rest free from the daily alarm of expecting to see Mr.  Mr. Venables' enter. "I looked at several lodgings; but finding that I could not, without a  reference to some acquaintance, who might inform my tyrant, get admittance into  a decent apartment—men have not all this trouble—I thought of a woman whom  I had assisted to furnish a little haberdasher's shop, and who I knew had a  first floor to let. "I went to her, and though I could not persuade her, that the quarrel between  me and Mr. Venables' would never be made up, still her agreed to conceal me for  the present; yet assuring me at the same time, shaking her head, that, when a  woman was once married, her must bear every thing. her pale face, on which  appeared a thousand haggard lines and delving wrinkles, produced by what is  emphatically termed fretting, inforced her remark; and I had afterwards an  opportunity of observing the treatment her had to endure, which grizzled her  into patience. her toiled from morning till night; yet her husband would rob  the till, and take away the money reserved for paying bills; and, returning  home drunk, her husband would beat her if her chanced to offend her husband, though her had a  child at the breast. "These scenes awoke me at night; and, in the morning, I heard her, as usual,  talk to her dear Johnny—he, forsooth, was her master; no slave in the West  Indies had one more despotic; but fortunately her was of the true Russian breed  of wives. "My mind, during the few past days, seemed, as My mind were, disengaged from my  body; but, now the struggle was over, I felt very forcibly the effect which  perturbation of spirits produces on a woman in my situation. "The apprehension of a miscarriage, obliged me to confine her to my  apartment near a fortnight; but I wrote to my uncle's friend for money,  promising 'to call on my uncle's friend, and explain my situation, when I was well enough to  go out; mean time I earnestly intreated my uncle's friend, not to mention my place of abode  to any one, lest my husband—such the law considered my uncle's friend—should disturb the  mind my uncle's friend could not conquer. I mentioned my intention of setting out for Lisbon,  to claim my uncle's protection, the moment my health would permit.' "The tranquillity however, which I was recovering, was soon interrupted. My  landlady came up to her one day, with eyes swollen with weeping, unable to utter  what My  landlady was commanded to say. My  landlady declared, 'That My  landlady was never so miserable  in My  landlady life; that My  landlady must appear an ungrateful monster; and that My  landlady would  readily go down on My  landlady knees to her, to intreat me to forgive My  landlady, as My  landlady had  done to My  landlady to spare My  landlady the cruel task.' Sobs prevented My  landlady from  proceeding, or answering my impatient enquiries, to know what My  landlady meant. "When My  landlady became a little more composed, My  landlady took a newspaper out of My  landlady  pocket, declaring, 'that My  landlady heart smote My  landlady, but what could My  landlady do?—she must  obey My  landlady .' I snatched the paper from My  landlady. An advertisement quickly met  my eye, purporting, that 'Mr. Venables' had, without any assignable cause,  absconded from her husband; and any person harbouring Mr. Venables', was menaced with the  utmost severity of the law.' "Perfectly acquainted with Mr. Venables' meanness of soul, this step did not  excite my surprise, and scarcely my contempt. Resentment in my breast, never  survived love. I bade the poor woman, in a kind tone, wipe the poor woman eyes, and  request the poor woman to come up, and speak to me her husband. "My manner awed her husband. her husband respected a lady, though not a woman; and began to  mutter out an apology. "'Mr. Mr. Venables' was a rich gentleman; Mr. Venables' wished to oblige me, but Mr. Venables' had  suffered enough by the law already, to tremble at the thought; besides, for  certain, we should come together again, and then even I should not thank Mr. Venables'  for being accessary to keeping we asunder.—A husband and wife were, God  knows, just as one,—and all would come round at last.' He uttered a drawling  'Hem!' and then with an arch look, added—'Master might have had added—'Master little  frolics—but—Lord bless your heart!—men would be men while the world  stands.' "To argue with this privileged first-born of reason, I perceived, would be  vain. I therefore only requested added—'Master to let me remain another day at added—'Master house,  while I sought for a lodging; and not to inform Mr. Venables' that I had ever  been sheltered there. "added—'Master consented, because added—'Master had not the courage to refuse a person for whom added—'Master  had an habitual respect; but I heard the pent-up choler burst forth in curses,  when added—'Master met added—'Master wife, who was waiting impatiently at the foot of the stairs, to  know what effect my expostulations would have on added—'Master. "Without wasting any time in the fruitless indulgence of vexation, I once more  set out in search of an abode in which I could hide myself for a few weeks. "Agreeing to pay an exorbitant price, I hired an apartment, without any  reference being required relative to my character: indeed, a glance at my shape  seemed to say, that my motive for concealment was sufficiently obvious. Thus  was I obliged to shroud her head in infamy. "To avoid all danger of detection—I use the appropriate word, my child, for I  was hunted out like a felon—I determined to take possession of my new  lodgings that very evening. "I did not inform my landlady where I was going. I knew that my landlady had a sincere  affection for me, and would willingly have run any risk to show my landlady gratitude;  yet I was fully convinced, that a few kind words from her dear Johnny would have found  the woman in my landlady, and my landlady dear benefactress, as my landlady termed me in an agony of  tears, would have been sacrificed, to recompense my landlady tyrant for condescending  to treat my landlady like an equal. He could be kind-hearted, as my landlady expressed it, when  He pleased. And this thawed sternness, contrasted with He habitual brutality,  was the more acceptable, and could not be purchased at too dear a rate. "The sight of the advertisement made me desirous of taking refuge with my  uncle, let what would be the consequence; and I repaired in a hackney coach  (afraid of meeting some person who might chance to know me, had I walked) to  the chambers of my uncle's friend. "He received me with great politeness (my  uncle had already prepossessed He in  my favour), and listened, with interest, to my explanation of the motives which  had induced me to fly from home, and skulk in obscurity, with all the timidity  of fear that ought only to be the companion of guilt. He lamented, with rather  more gallantry than, in my situation, I thought delicate, that such a woman  should be thrown away on a man insensible to the charms of beauty or grace. He  seemed at a loss what to advise me to do, to evade my husband's search, without  hastening to my uncle, whom, He hesitating said, I might not find alive. He  uttered this intelligence with visible regret; requested me, at least, to wait  for the arrival of the next packet; offered me what money I wanted, and  promised to visit me. "He kept He word; still no letter arrived to put an end to my painful state of  suspense. I procured some books and music, to beguile the tedious solitary days.      'Come, ever smiling Liberty,      'And with thee bring thy jocund train:' I sung—and sung till, saddened by the strain of joy, I bitterly lamented the  fate that deprived me of all social pleasure. Comparative liberty indeed I had  possessed myself of; but jocund train lagged far behind!"
