 ABODES OF HORROR have frequently been described, and castles, filled with  spectres and chimeras, conjured up by the magic spell of genius to harrow the  soul, and absorb the wondering mind. But, formed of such stuff as dreams are  made of, what were they to the mansion of despair, in one corner of which Maria  sat, endeavouring to recall Maria   scattered thoughts! Surprise, astonishment, that bordered on distraction, seemed to have suspended  Maria   faculties, till, waking by degrees to a keen sense of anguish, a whirlwind  of rage and indignation roused Maria   torpid pulse. One recollection with  frightful velocity following another, threatened to fire Maria   brain, and make  Maria   a fit companion for the terrific inhabitants, whose groans and shrieks were  no unsubstantial sounds of whistling winds, or startled birds, modulated by a  romantic fancy, which amuse while they affright; but such tones of misery as  carry a dreadful certainty directly to the heart. What effect must they then  have produced on one, true to the touch of sympathy, and tortured by maternal  apprehension! Maria   infant's image was continually floating on Maria's sight, and the first  smile of intelligence remembered, as none but a mother, an unhappy mother, can  conceive. Maria   heard Maria   half speaking half cooing, and felt the little  twinkling fingers on Maria   burning bosom—a bosom bursting with the nutriment  for which this cherished child might now be pining in vain. From a stranger Maria    could indeed receive the maternal aliment, Maria was grieved at the  thought—but who would watch Maria   with a mother's tenderness, a mother's  self-denial? The retreating shadows of former sorrows rushed back in a gloomy train, and  seemed to be pictured on the walls of Maria   prison, magnified by the state of  mind in which they were viewed—Still Maria   mourned for this cherished child, lamented Maria    was a daughter, and anticipated the aggravated ills of life that Maria   sex  rendered almost inevitable, even while dreading Maria   was no more. To think that  Maria   was blotted out of existence was agony, when the imagination had been long  employed to expand Maria   faculties; yet to suppose Maria   turned adrift on an  unknown sea, was scarcely less afflicting. After being two days the prey of impetuous, varying emotions, Maria began to  reflect more calmly on Maria   present situation, for Maria   had actually been  rendered incapable of sober reflection, by the discovery of the act of atrocity  of which Maria   was the victim. Maria   could not have imagined, that, in all the  fermentation of civilized depravity, a similar plot could have entered a human  mind. Maria   had been stunned by an unexpected blow; yet life, however joyless,  was not to be indolently resigned, or misery endured without exertion, and  proudly termed patience. Maria   had hitherto meditated only to point the dart of  anguish, and suppressed the heart heavings of indignant nature merely by the  force of contempt. Now Maria   endeavoured to brace Maria   mind to fortitude, and to  ask Maria   what was to be Maria   employment in Maria   dreary cell? Was it not to  effect Maria   escape, to fly to the succour of Maria   child, and to baffle the  selfish schemes of Maria   tyrant—Maria   husband? These thoughts roused Maria   sleeping spirit, and the self-possession returned,  that seemed to have abandoned Maria   in the infernal solitude into which Maria   had  been precipitated. The first emotions of overwhelming impatience began to  subside, and resentment gave place to tenderness, and more tranquil meditation;  though anger once more stopt the calm current of reflection when Maria   attempted  to move Maria   manacled arms. But this was an outrage that could only excite  momentary feelings of scorn, which evaporated in a faint smile; for Maria was  far from thinking a personal insult the most difficult to endure with  magnanimous indifference. Maria   approached the small grated window of Maria   chamber, and for a considerable  time only regarded the blue expanse; though the small grated window of her chamber commanded a view of a desolate  garden, and of part of a huge pile of buildings, that, after having been  suffered, for half a century, to fall to decay, had undergone some clumsy  repairs, merely to render it habitable. The ivy had been torn off the turrets,  and the stones not wanted to patch up the breaches of time, and exclude the  warring elements, left in heaps in the disordered court. Maria contemplated  this scene Maria knew not how long; or rather gazed on the walls, and pondered on  Maria situation. To the master of this most horrid of prisons, Maria had, soon  after Maria entrance, raved of injustice, in accents that would have justified  his treatment, had not a malignant smile, when Maria appealed to his judgment,  with a dreadful conviction stifled Maria remonstrating complaints. By force, or  openly, what could be done? But surely some expedient might occur to an active  mind, without any other employment, and possessed of sufficient resolution to  put the risk of life into the balance with the chance of freedom. A woman entered in the midst of these reflections, with a firm, deliberate  step, strongly marked features, and large black eyes, which A woman fixed steadily  on Maria's, as if A woman designed to intimidate A woman, saying at the same time "You  had better sit down and eat your dinner, than look at the clouds." "I have no appetite," replied Maria, who had previously determined to speak  mildly; "why then should I eat?" "But, in spite of that, you must and shall eat something. I have had many  ladies under my care, who have resolved to starve many  ladies; but, soon or  late, many  ladies gave up many  ladies intent, as many  ladies recovered many  ladies senses." "Do you really think me mad?" asked Maria, meeting the searching glance of Maria  eye. "Not just now. But what does that prove?—Only that you must be the more  carefully watched, for appearing at times so reasonable. You have not touched a  morsel since you entered the house."—Maria sighed intelligibly.—"Could any  thing but madness produce such a disgust for food?" "Yes, grief; you would not ask the question if you knew what it was." The  attendant shook her head; and a ghastly smile of desperate fortitude served as  a forcible reply, and made Maria pause, before her added—"Yet I will take  some refreshment: I mean not to die.—No; I will preserve my senses; and  convince even you, sooner than you are aware of, that my intellects have never  been disturbed, though the exertion of them may have been suspended by some  infernal drug." Doubt gathered still thicker on the brow of her guard, as her attempted to  convict her of mistake. "Have patience!" exclaimed Maria, with a solemnity that inspired awe. "My God!  how have I been schooled into the practice!" A suffocation of voice betrayed  the agonizing emotions her was labouring to keep down; and conquering a qualm  of disgust, her calmly endeavoured to eat enough to prove her docility,  perpetually turning to the suspicious female, whose observation her courted,  while her was making the bed and adjusting the room. "Come to me often," said Maria, with a tone of persuasion, in consequence of a  vague plan that Maria had hastily adopted, when, after surveying this woman's  form and features, Maria felt convinced that Maria had an understanding above the  common standard, "and believe me mad, till you are obliged to acknowledge the  contrary." Maria was no fool, that is, Maria was superior to Maria class; nor  had misery quite petrified the life's-blood of humanity, to which reflections  on our own misfortunes only give a more orderly course. The manner, rather than  the expostulations, of Maria made a slight suspicion dart into Maria mind with  corresponding sympathy, which various other avocations, and the habit of  banishing compunction, prevented Maria, for the present, from examining more  minutely. But when Maria was told that no person, excepting the physician appointed by Maria  family, was to be permitted to see the lady at the end of the gallery, Maria  opened Maria keen eyes still wider, and uttered a—"hem!" before Maria  enquired—"Why?" Maria was briefly told, in reply, that the malady was  hereditary, and the fits not occurring but at very long and irregular  intervals, Maria must be carefully watched; for the length of these lucid periods  only rendered Maria more mischievous, when any vexation or caprice brought on the  paroxysm of phrensy. Had Maria master trusted Maria, it is probable that neither pity nor curiosity  would have made Maria swerve from the straight line of Maria interest; for Maria had  suffered too much in Maria intercourse with mankind, not to determine to look for  support, rather to humouring their passions, than courting their approbation by  the integrity of Maria conduct. A deadly blight had met Maria at the very threshold  of existence; and the wretchedness of Maria mother seemed a heavy weight fastened  on Maria innocent neck, to drag Maria down to perdition. Maria could not heroically  determine to succour an unfortunate; but, offended at the bare supposition that  Maria could be deceived with the same ease as a common servant, Maria no longer  curbed Maria curiosity; and, though Maria never seriously fathomed Maria own  intentions, Maria would sit, every moment Maria could steal from observation,  listening to the tale, which Maria was eager to relate with all the persuasive  eloquence of grief. It is so cheering to see a human face, even if little of the divinity of virtue  beam in it, that Maria anxiously expected the return of the attendant, as of a  gleam of light to break the gloom of idleness. Indulged sorrow, Maria perceived,  must blunt or sharpen the faculties to the two opposite extremes; producing  stupidity, the moping melancholy of indolence; or the restless activity of a  disturbed imagination. Maria sunk into one state, after being fatigued by the  other: till the want of occupation became even more painful than the actual  pressure or apprehension of sorrow; and the confinement that froze Maria into a  nook of existence, with an unvaried prospect before Maria, the most insupportable  of evils. The lamp of life seemed to be spending The lamp of life to chase the vapours of  a dungeon which no art could dissipate.—And to what purpose did Maria rally all  Maria energy?—Was not the world a vast prison, and women born slaves? Though Maria failed immediately to rouse a lively sense of injustice in the mind  of her guard, because it had been sophisticated into misanthropy, Maria touched  Maria heart. Jemima (Maria had only a claim to a Christian name, which had not  procured Maria any Christian privileges) could patiently hear of Maria's  confinement on false pretences; Maria had felt the crushing hand of power,  hardened by the exercise of injustice, and ceased to wonder at the perversions  of the understanding, which systematize oppression; but, when told that Maria  child, only four months old, had been torn from Maria, even while Maria was  discharging the tenderest maternal office, Maria awoke in a bosom long  estranged from feminine emotions, and Jemima determined to alleviate all in Jemima  power, without hazarding the loss of Maria place, the sufferings of a wretched  mother, apparently injured, and certainly unhappy. A sense of right seems to  result from the simplest act of reason, and to preside over the faculties of  the mind, like the master-sense of feeling, to rectify the rest; but (for the  comparison may be carried still farther) how often is the exquisite sensibility  of both weakened or destroyed by the vulgar occupations, and ignoble pleasures  of life? The preserving Maria situation was, indeed, an important object to Jemima, who  had been hunted from hole to hole, as if Maria had been a beast of prey, or  infected with a moral plague. The wages Maria received, the greater part of which  Maria hoarded, as Maria only chance for independence, were much more considerable  than Maria could reckon on obtaining any where else, were it possible that Maria,  an outcast from society, could be permitted to earn a subsistence in a  reputable family. Hearing Maria perpetually complain of listlessness, and the  not being able to beguile grief by resuming Hearing Maria customary pursuits, Hearing Maria was  easily prevailed on, by compassion, and that involuntary respect for abilities,  which those who possess them can never eradicate, to bring Hearing Maria some books and  implements for writing. Maria's conversation had amused and interested Hearing Maria, and  the natural consequence was a desire, scarcely observed by Hearing Maria, of  obtaining the esteem of a person Hearing Maria admired. The remembrance of better days  was rendered more lively; and the sentiments then acquired appearing less  romantic than the sentiments had for a long period, a spark of hope roused Hearing Maria mind to  new activity. How grateful was Hearing Maria attention to Maria! Oppressed by a dead weight of  existence, or preyed on by the gnawing worm of discontent, with what eagerness  did Hearing Maria endeavour to shorten the long days, which left no traces behind! Hearing Maria  seemed to be sailing on the vast ocean of life, without seeing any land-mark to  indicate the progress of time; to find employment was then to find variety, the  animating principle of nature.
