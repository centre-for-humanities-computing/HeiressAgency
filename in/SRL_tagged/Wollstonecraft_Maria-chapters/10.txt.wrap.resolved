 "MY FATHER'S situation was now so distressing, that I prevailed on my uncle to  accompany me to visit my uncle; and to lend me my uncle assistance, to prevent the whole  property of the family from becoming the prey of my brother's rapacity; for, to  extricate himself out of present difficulties, MY FATHER was totally regardless  of futurity. I took down with MY FATHER some presents for my step-mother; it did not  require an effort for me to treat my step-mother with civility, or to forget the past. "This was the first time I had visited my native village, since my marriage.  But with what different emotions did I return from the busy world, with a heavy  weight of experience benumbing my imagination, to scenes, that whispered  recollections of joy and hope most eloquently to my heart! The first scent of  the wild flowers from the heath, thrilled through my veins, awakening every  sense to pleasure. The icy hand of despair seemed to be removed from my bosom;  and—forgetting my husband—the nurtured visions of a romantic mind, bursting  on MY FATHER with all their original wildness and gay exuberance, were again hailed as  sweet realities. I forgot, with equal facility, that I ever felt sorrow, or  knew care in the country; while a transient rainbow stole athwart the cloudy  sky of despondency. The picturesque form of several favourite trees, and the  porches of rude cottages, with their smiling hedges, were recognized with the  gladsome playfulness of childish vivacity. I could have kissed the chickens  that pecked on the common; and longed to pat the cows, and frolic with the dogs  that sported on the chickens  that pecked on the common. I gazed with delight on the windmill, and thought the windmill lucky  that the windmill should be in motion, at the moment I passed by; and entering the dear  green lane, which led directly to the village, the sound of the well-known  rookery gave that sentimental tinge to the varying sensations of my active  soul, which only served to heighten the lustre of the luxuriant scenery. But,  spying, as I advanced, the spire, peeping over the withered tops of the aged  elms that composed the rookery, my thoughts flew immediately to the churchyard,  and tears of affection, such was the effect of my imagination, bedewed my  mother's grave! Sorrow gave place to devotional feelings. I wandered through  the church in fancy, as I used sometimes to do on a Saturday evening. I  recollected with what fervour I addressed the God of my youth: and once more  with rapturous love looked above my sorrows to the Father of nature. I  pause—feeling forcibly all the emotions I am describing; and (reminded, as I  register my sorrows, of the sublime calm I have felt, when in some tremendous  solitude, my soul rested on my soul, and seemed to fill the universe) I  insensibly breathe soft, hushing every wayward emotion, as if fearing to sully  with a sigh, a contentment so extatic. "Having settled my father's affairs, and, by my exertions in my father favour, made  my brother my sworn foe, I returned to London. My husband's conduct was now  changed; I had during my absence, received several affectionate, penitential  letters from My husband; and My husband seemed on my arrival, to wish by My husband behaviour to  prove My husband sincerity. I could not then conceive why My husband acted thus; and, when the  suspicion darted into my head, that the  suspicion might arise from observing my increasing  influence with my uncle, I almost despised My husband for imagining that such a  degree of debasing selfishness could exist. "My husband became, unaccountable as was the change, tender and attentive; and,  attacking my weak side, made a confession of My husband follies, and lamented the  embarrassments in which I, who merited a far different fate, might be involved.  My husband besought me to aid My husband with my counsel, praised my understanding, and  appealed to the tenderness of my heart. "My husband's conduct only inspired me with compassion. I wished to be My husband friend; but  love had spread My husband rosy pinions and fled far, far away; and had not (like some  exquisite perfumes, the fine spirit of which is continually mingling with the  air) left a fragrance behind, to mark where My husband had shook My husband wings. My  husband's renewed caresses then became hateful to me; My  husband's renewed caresses brutality was  tolerable, compared to My  husband's renewed caresses distasteful fondness. Still, compassion, and the  fear of insulting My husband supposed feelings, by a want of sympathy, made me  dissemble, and do violence to my delicacy. What a task! "Those who support a system of what I term false refinement, and will not allow  great part of love in the female, as well as male breast, to spring in some  respects involuntarily, may not admit that charms are as necessary to feed the  passion, as virtues to convert the mellowing spirit into friendship. To such  observers I have nothing to say, any more than to the moralists, who insist  that women ought to, and can love women husbands, because it is women duty. To  you, my child, I may add, with a heart tremblingly alive to your future  conduct, some observations, dictated by my present feelings, on calmly  reviewing this period of my life. When novelists or moralists praise as a  virtue, a woman's coldness of constitution, and want of passion; and make a woman  yield to the ardour of a woman lover out of sheer compassion, or to promote a  frigid plan of future comfort, I am disgusted. novelists or moralists may be good women, in the  ordinary acceptation of the phrase, and do no harm; but novelists or moralists appear to me not  to have those 'finely fashioned nerves,' which render the senses exquisite.  novelists or moralists may possess tenderness; but novelists or moralists want that fire of the imagination, which  produces active sensibility, and positive virtue. How does the woman deserve to  be characterized, who marries one man, with a heart and imagination devoted to  another? Is the woman not an object of pity or contempt, when thus sacrilegiously  violating the purity of the woman own feelings? Nay, it is as indelicate, when the woman is  indifferent, unless the woman be constitutionally insensible; then indeed it is a  mere affair of barter; and I have nothing to do with the secrets of trade. Yes;  eagerly as I wish you to possess true rectitude of mind, and purity of  affection, I must insist that a heartless conduct is the contrary of virtuous.  Truth is the only basis of virtue; and we cannot, without depraving we minds,  endeavour to please a lover or husband, but in proportion as he pleases us.  Men, more effectually to enslave us, may inculcate this partial morality, and  lose sight of virtue in subdividing it into the duties of particular stations;  but let us not blush for nature without a cause! "After these remarks, I am ashamed to own, that I was pregnant. The greatest  sacrifice of my principles in my whole life, was the allowing my husband again  to be familiar with my person, though to this cruel act of self-denial, when I  wished the earth to open and swallow me, you owe your birth; and I the  unutterable pleasure of being a mother. There was something of delicacy in my  husband's bridal attentions; but now my  husband tainted breath, pimpled face, and  blood-shot eyes, were not more repugnant to my senses, than my  husband gross manners,  and loveless familiarity to my taste. "A man would only be expected to maintain; yes, barely grant a subsistence, to  a woman rendered odious by habitual intoxication; but who would expect A man, or  think it possible to love  a woman rendered odious by habitual intoxication? And unless 'youth, and genial years were flown,'  it would be thought equally unreasonable to insist, [under penalty of]  forfeiting almost every thing reckoned valuable in life, that he should not  love another: whilst woman, weak in reason, impotent in will, is required to  moralize, sentimentalize herself to stone, and pine herself life away, labouring to  reform herself embruted mate. he may even spend in dissipation, and intemperance,  the very intemperance which renders he so hateful, herself property, and by  stinting herself expences, not permit herself to beguile in society, a wearisome,  joyless life; for over their mutual fortune herself has no power, it must all pass  through he hand. And if herself be a mother, and in the present state of women, it  is a great misfortune to be prevented from discharging the duties, and  cultivating the affections of one, what has herself not to endure?—But I have  suffered the tenderness of one to lead me into reflections that I did not think  of making, to interrupt my narrative—yet the full heart will overflow. "he embarrassments did not now endear he to he; still, anxious to  befriend he, I endeavoured to prevail on he to retrench he expences; but he  had always some plausible excuse to give, to justify he not following my  advice. Humanity, compassion, and the interest produced by a habit of living  together, made me try to relieve, and sympathize with he; but, when I  recollected that I was bound to live with such a being for ever—my heart died  within he; my desire of improvement became languid, and baleful, corroding  melancholy took possession of my soul. Marriage had bastilled me for life. I  discovered in he a capacity for the enjoyment of the various pleasures  existence affords; yet, fettered by the partial laws of society, this fair  globe was to he an universal blank. "When I exhorted my husband to economy, I referred to my husband. I was obliged to  practise the most rigid, or contract debts, which I had too much reason to fear  would never be paid. I despised this paltry privilege of a wife, which can only  be of use to the vicious or inconsiderate, and determined not to increase the  torrent that was bearing my husband down. I was then ignorant of the extent of my husband  fraudulent speculations, whom I was bound to honour and obey. "A woman neglected by her husband, or whose manners form a striking contrast  with her husband, will always have men on the watch to soothe and flatter her. Besides,  the forlorn state of a neglected woman, not destitute of personal charms, is  particularly interesting, and rouses that species of pity, which is so near  akin, it easily slides into love. A man of feeling thinks not of seducing, A man of feeling  is A man of feeling seduced by all the noblest emotions of A man of feeling . A man of feeling figures to  A man of feeling all the sacrifices a woman of sensibility must make, and every  situation in which A man of feeling imagination places her, touches A man of feeling heart, and fires A man of feeling  passions. Longing to take to A man of feeling bosom the shorn lamb, and bid the drooping  buds of hope revive, benevolence changes into passion: and should A man of feeling then  discover that A man of feeling is beloved, honour binds A man of feeling fast, though foreseeing that A man of feeling  may afterwards be obliged to pay severe damages to the man, who never appeared  to value A man of feeling wife's society, till A man of feeling found that there was a chance of A man of feeling being  indemnified for the loss of it. "Such are the partial laws enacted by men; for, only to lay a stress on the  dependent state of a woman in the grand question of the comforts arising from  the possession of property, she is [even in this article] much more injured by  the loss of the husband's affection, than the husband by that of the husband wife; yet where is  she, condemned to the solitude of a deserted home, to look for a compensation  from the woman, who seduces the husband from she? she cannot drive an unfaithful  husband from an unfaithful  husband house, nor separate, or tear, an unfaithful  husband children from an unfaithful  husband, however  culpable an unfaithful  husband may be; and an unfaithful  husband, still the master of an unfaithful  husband own fate, enjoys the smiles  of a world, that would brand she with infamy, did she, seeking consolation,  venture to retaliate. "these remarks are not dictated by experience; but merely by the compassion I  feel for many amiable women, the outlaws of the world. For myself, never  encouraging any of the advances that were made to myself, my lovers dropped off  like the untimely shoots of spring. I did not even coquet with my lovers; because I  found, on examining myself, I could not coquet with a man without loving a man a  little; and I perceived that I should not be able to stop at the line of what  are termed innocent freedoms, did I suffer any. My reserve was then the  consequence of delicacy. Freedom of conduct has emancipated many women's minds;  but my conduct has most rigidly been governed by my principles, till the  improvement of my understanding has enabled me to discern the fallacy of  prejudices at war with nature and reason. "Shortly after the change I have mentioned in my husband's conduct, my uncle  was compelled by my uncle   declining health, to seek the succour of a milder climate,  and embark for Lisbon. my uncle   left my uncle   will in the hands of a friend, an eminent  solicitor; my uncle   had previously questioned me relative to my situation and state  of mind, and declared very freely, that my uncle   could place no reliance on the  stability of my husband's professions. my uncle   had been deceived in the unfolding of  my uncle   character; my uncle   now thought it fixed in a train of actions that would  inevitably lead to ruin and disgrace. "The evening before my uncle   departure, which we spent alone together, my uncle   folded me  to my uncle   heart, uttering the endearing appellation of 'child.'—My more than  father! why was I not permitted to perform the last duties of one, and smooth  the pillow of death? my uncle   seemed by my uncle   manner to be convinced that my uncle   should  never see me more; yet requested me, most earnestly, to come to my uncle  , should I  be obliged to leave my husband. my uncle   had before expressed my uncle   sorrow at hearing  of my pregnancy, having determined to prevail on my uncle   to accompany my uncle  , till I  informed my uncle   of that circumstance. my uncle   expressed my uncle   unfeignedly sorry that  any new tie should bind me to a man whom my uncle   thought so incapable of estimating  my value; such was the kind language of affection. "I must repeat my uncle   own words; they made an indelible impression on my mind: "'The marriage state is certainly that in which women, generally speaking, can  be most useful; but I am far from thinking that a woman, once married, ought to  consider the engagement as indissoluble (especially if there be no children to  reward   for sacrificing   feelings) in case   merits neither    love, nor esteem. Esteem will often supply the place of love; and prevent a  woman from being wretched, though it may not make a  woman happy. The magnitude of a  sacrifice ought always to bear some proportion to the utility in view; and for  a woman to live with a man, for whom a woman can cherish neither affection nor  esteem, or even be of any use to him, excepting in the light of a house-keeper,  is an abjectness of condition, the enduring of which no concurrence of  circumstances can ever make a duty in the sight of God or just men. If indeed  a woman submits to indeed   merely to be maintained in idleness, a woman has no right to  complain bitterly of a woman fate; or to act, as a person of independent character  might, as if a woman had a title to disregard general rules. "But the misfortune is, that many women only submit in appearance, and forfeit  many women own respect to secure many women reputation in the world. The situation of a  woman separated from a  woman , is undoubtedly very different from that of a  man who has left my husband wife. my husband, with lordly dignity, has shaken of a clog; and  the allowing a woman food and raiment, is thought sufficient to secure my husband  reputation from taint. And, should a woman have been inconsiderate, my husband will be  celebrated for my husband generosity and forbearance. Such is the respect paid to the  master-key of property! A woman, on the contrary, resigning what is termed A woman  natural protector (though my husband never was so, but in name) is despised and  shunned, for asserting the independence of mind distinctive of a rational  being, and spurning at slavery.' "During the remainder of the evening, my uncle's tenderness led my uncle frequently  to revert to the subject, and utter, with increasing warmth, sentiments to the  same purport. At length it was necessary to say 'Farewell!'—and we  parted—gracious God! to meet no more."
