 SUCH was her state of mind when the dogs of law were let loose on her. Maria  took the task of conducting Darnford's defence upon herself. She instructed his  counsel to plead guilty to the charge of adultery; but to deny that of  seduction. The counsel for the plaintiff opened the cause, by observing, "that his client  had ever been an indulgent husband, and had borne with several defects of  temper, while he had nothing criminal to lay to the charge of his wife. But  that she left his house without assigning any cause. He could not assert that  she was then acquainted with the defendant; yet, when he was once endeavouring  to bring her back to her home, this man put the peace-officers to flight, and  took her he knew not whither. After the birth of her child, her conduct was so  strange, and a melancholy malady having afflicted one of the family, which  delicacy forbade the dwelling on, it was necessary to confine her. By some  means the defendant enabled her to make her escape, and they had lived  together, in despite of all sense of order and decorum. The adultery was  allowed, it was not necessary to bring any witnesses to prove it; but the  seduction, though highly probable from the circumstances which he had the  honour to state, could not be so clearly proved.—It was of the most atrocious  kind, as decency was set at defiance, and respect for reputation, which shows  internal compunction, utterly disregarded." A strong sense of injustice had silenced every motion, which a mixture of true  and false delicacy might otherwise have excited in Maria's bosom. She only felt  in earnest to insist on the privilege of her nature. The sarcasms of society,  and the condemnations of a mistaken world, were nothing to her, compared with  acting contrary to those feelings which were the foundation of her principles.  [She therefore eagerly put herself forward, instead of desiring to be absent,  on this memorable occasion.] Convinced that the subterfuges of the law were disgraceful, she wrote a paper,  which she expressly desired might be read in court: "Married when scarcely able to distinguish the nature of the engagement, I yet  submitted to the rigid laws which enslave women, and obeyed the man whom I  could no longer love. Whether the duties of the state are reciprocal, I mean  not to discuss; but I can prove repeated infidelities which I overlooked or  pardoned. Witnesses are not wanting to establish these facts. I at present  maintain the child of a maid servant, sworn to him, and born after our  marriage. I am ready to allow, that education and circumstances lead men to  think and act with less delicacy, than the preservation of order in society  demands from women; but surely I may without assumption declare, that, though I  could excuse the birth, I could not the desertion of this unfortunate  babe:—and, while I despised the man, it was not easy to venerate the husband.  With proper restrictions however, I revere the institution which fraternizes  the world. I exclaim against the laws which throw the whole weight of the yoke  on the weaker shoulders, and force women, when they claim protectorship as  mothers, to sign a contract, which renders them dependent on the caprice of the  tyrant, whom choice or necessity has appointed to reign over them. Various are  the cases, in which a woman ought to separate herself from her husband; and  mine, I may be allowed emphatically to insist, comes under the description of  the most aggravated. "I will not enlarge on those provocations which only the individual can  estimate; but will bring forward such charges only, the truth of which is an  insult upon humanity. In order to promote certain destructive speculations, Mr.  Venables prevailed on me to borrow certain sums of a wealthy relation; and,  when I refused further compliance, he thought of bartering my person; and not  only allowed opportunities to, but urged, a friend from whom he borrowed money,  to seduce me. On the discovery of this act of atrocity, I determined to leave  him, and in the most decided manner, for ever. I consider all obligations as  made void by his conduct; and hold, that schisms which proceed from want of  principles, can never be healed. "He received a fortune with me to the amount of five thousand pounds. On the  death of my uncle, convinced that I could provide for my child, I destroyed the  settlement of that fortune. I required none of my property to be returned to  me, nor shall enumerate the sums extorted from me during six years that we  lived together. "After leaving, what the law considers as my home, I was hunted like a criminal  from place to place, though I contracted no debts, and demanded no  maintenance—yet, as the laws sanction such proceeding, and make women the  property of their husbands, I forbear to animadvert. After the birth of my  daughter, and the death of my uncle, who left a very considerable property to  myself and child, I was exposed to new persecution; and, because I had, before  arriving at what is termed years of discretion, pledged my faith, I was treated  by the world, as bound for ever to a man whose vices were notorious. Yet what  are the vices generally known, to the various miseries that a woman may be  subject to, which, though deeply felt, eating into the soul, elude description,  and may be glossed over! A false morality is even established, which makes all  the virtue of women consist in chastity, submission, and the forgiveness of  injuries. "I pardon my oppressor—bitterly as I lament the loss of my child, torn from  me in the most violent manner. But nature revolts, and my soul sickens at the  bare supposition, that it could ever be a duty to pretend affection, when a  separation is necessary to prevent my feeling hourly aversion. "To force me to give my fortune, I was imprisoned—yes; in a private  mad-house.—There, in the heart of misery, I met the man charged with seducing  me. We became attached—I deemed, and ever shall deem, myself free. The death  of my babe dissolved the only tie which subsisted between me and my, what is  termed, lawful husband. "To this person, thus encountered, I voluntarily gave myself, never considering  myself as any more bound to transgress the laws of moral purity, because the  will of my husband might be pleaded in my excuse, than to transgress those laws  to which [the policy of artificial society has] annexed [positive]  punishments.—While no command of a husband can prevent a woman from suffering  for certain crimes, she must be allowed to consult her conscience, and regulate  her conduct, in some degree, by her own sense of right. The respect I owe to  myself, demanded my strict adherence to my determination of never viewing Mr.  Venables in the light of a husband, nor could it forbid me from encouraging  another. If I am unfortunately united to an unprincipled man, am I for ever to  be shut out from fulfilling the duties of a wife and mother?—I wish my  country to approve of my conduct; but, if laws exist, made by the strong to  oppress the weak, I appeal to my own sense of justice, and declare that I will  not live with the individual, who has violated every moral obligation which  binds man to man. "I protest equally against any charge being brought to criminate the man, whom  I consider as my husband. I was six-and-twenty when I left Mr. Venables' roof;  if ever I am to be supposed to arrive at an age to direct my own actions, I  must by that time have arrived at it.—I acted with deliberation.—Mr.  Darnford found me a forlorn and oppressed woman, and promised the protection  women in the present state of society want.—But the man who now claims  me—was he deprived of my society by this conduct? The question is an insult  to common sense, considering where Mr. Darnford met me.—Mr. Venables' door  was indeed open to me—nay, threats and intreaties were used to induce me to  return; but why? Was affection or honour the motive?—I cannot, it is true,  dive into the recesses of the human heart—yet I presume to assert, [borne out  as I am by a variety of circumstances,] that he was merely influenced by the  most rapacious avarice. "I claim then a divorce, and the liberty of enjoying, free from molestation,  the fortune left to me by a relation, who was well aware of the character of  the man with whom I had to contend.—I appeal to the justice and humanity of  the jury—a body of men, whose private judgment must be allowed to modify  laws, that must be unjust, because definite rules can never apply to indefinite  circumstances—and I deprecate punishment upon the man of my choice, freeing  him, as I solemnly do, from the charge of seduction. "I did not put myself into a situation to justify a charge of adultery, till I  had, from conviction, shaken off the fetters which bound me to Mr.  Venables.—While I lived with him, I defy the voice of calumny to sully what  is termed the fair fame of woman.—Neglected by my husband, I never encouraged  a lover; and preserved with scrupulous care, what is termed my honour, at the  expence of my peace, till he, who should have been its guardian, laid traps to  ensnare me. From that moment I believed myself, in the sight of heaven,  free—and no power on earth shall force me to renounce my resolution." The judge, in summing up the evidence, alluded to "the fallacy of letting women  plead their feelings, as an excuse for the violation of the marriage-vow. For  his part, he had always determined to oppose all innovation, and the newfangled  notions which incroached on the good old rules of conduct. We did not want  French principles in public or private life—and, if women were allowed to  plead their feelings, as an excuse or palliation of infidelity, it was opening  a flood-gate for immorality. What virtuous woman thought of her feelings?—It  was her duty to love and obey the man chosen by her parents and relations, who  were qualified by their experience to judge better for her, than she could for  herself. As to the charges brought against the husband, they were vague,  supported by no witnesses, excepting that of imprisonment in a private  madhouse. The proofs of an insanity in the family, might render that however a  prudent measure; and indeed the conduct of the lady did not appear that of a  person of sane mind. Still such a mode of proceeding could not be justified,  and might perhaps entitle the lady [in another court] to a sentence of  separation from bed and board, during the joint lives of the parties; but he  hoped that no Englishman would legalize adultery, by enabling the adulteress to  enrich her seducer. Too many restrictions could not be thrown in the way of  divorces, if we wished to maintain the sanctity of marriage; and, though they  might bear a little hard on a few, very few individuals, it was evidently for  the good of the whole."     CONCLUSION  BY THE EDITOR *       * i.e., Godwin [Publisher's note]. VERY FEW hints exist respecting the plan of the remainder of the work. I find  only two detached sentences, and some scattered heads for the continuation of  the story. I transcribe the whole. I. "Darnford's letters were affectionate; but circumstances occasioned delays,  and the miscarriage of some letters rendered the reception of wished-for  answers doubtful: his return was necessary to calm Maria's mind." II. "As Darnford had informed her that his business was settled, his delaying  to return seemed extraordinary; but love to excess, excludes fear or suspicion." The scattered heads for the continuation of the story, are as follow. *      * To understand these minutes, it is necessary the reader      should consider each of them as setting out from the same      point in the story, viz. the point to which it is brought      down in the preceding chapter. [Godwin's note] I. "Trial for adultery—Maria defends herself—A separation from bed and  board is the consequence—Her fortune is thrown into chancery—Darnford  obtains a part of his property—Maria goes into the country." II. "A prosecution for adultery commenced—Trial—Darnford sets out for  France—Letters—Once more pregnant—He returns—Mysterious  behaviour—Visit—Expectation—Discovery—Interview—Consequence." III. "Sued by her husband—Damages awarded to him—Separation from bed and  board—Darnford goes abroad—Maria into the country—Provides for her  father—Is shunned—Returns to London—Expects to see her lover—The rack  of expectation—Finds herself again with child—Delighted—A discovery—A  visit—A miscarriage—Conclusion." IV. "Divorced by her husband—Her lover  unfaithful—Pregnancy—Miscarriage—Suicide." [The following passage appears in some respects to deviate from the preceding  hints. It is superscribed] "THE END. "She swallowed the laudanum; her soul was calm—the tempest had subsided—and  nothing remained but an eager longing to forget herself—to fly from the  anguish she endured to escape from thought—from this hell of disappointment. "Still her eyes closed not—one remembrance with frightful velocity followed  another—All the incidents of her life were in arms, embodied to assail her,  and prevent her sinking into the sleep of death.—Her murdered child again  appeared to her, mourning for the babe of which she was the tomb.—'And could  it have a nobler?—Surely it is better to die with me, than to enter on life  without a mother's care!—I cannot live!—but could I have deserted my child  the moment it was born?—thrown it on the troubled wave of life, without a  hand to support it?'—She looked up: 'What have I not suffered!—may I find a  father where I am going!—Her head turned; a stupor ensued; a  faintness—'Have a little patience,' said Maria, holding her swimming head  (she thought of her mother), 'this cannot last long; and what is a little  bodily pain to the pangs I have endured?' "A new vision swam before her. Jemima seemed to enter—leading a little  creature, that, with tottering footsteps, approached the bed. The voice of  Jemima sounding as at a distance, called her—she tried to listen, to speak,  to look! "'Behold your child!' exclaimed Jemima. Maria started off the bed, and  fainted.—Violent vomiting followed. "When she was restored to life, Jemima addressed her with great solemnity:  '——- led me to suspect, that your husband and brother had deceived you, and  secreted the child. I would not torment you with doubtful hopes, and I left you  (at a fatal moment) to search for the child!—I snatched her from misery—and  (now she is alive again) would you leave her alone in the world, to endure what  I have endured?' "Maria gazed wildly at her, her whole frame was convulsed with emotion; when  the child, whom Jemima had been tutoring all the journey, uttered the word  'Mamma!' She caught her to her bosom, and burst into a passion of tears—then,  resting the child gently on the bed, as if afraid of killing it,—she put her  hand to her eyes, to conceal as it were the agonizing struggle of her soul. She  remained silent for five minutes, crossing her arms over her bosom, and  reclining her head,—then exclaimed: 'The conflict is over!—I will live for  my child!'" A few readers perhaps, in looking over these hints, will wonder how it could  have been practicable, without tediousness, or remitting in any degree the  interest of the story, to have filled, from these slight sketches, a number of  pages, more considerable than those which have been already presented. But, in  reality, these hints, simple as they are, are pregnant with passion and  distress. It is the refuge of barren authors only, to crowd their fictions with  so great a number of events, as to suffer no one of them to sink into the  reader's mind. It is the province of true genius to develop events, to discover  their capabilities, to ascertain the different passions and sentiments with  which they are fraught, and to diversify them with incidents, that give reality  to the picture, and take a hold upon the mind of a reader of taste, from which  they can never be loosened. It was particularly the design of the author, in  the present instance, to make her story subordinate to a great moral purpose,  that "of exhibiting the misery and oppression, peculiar to women, that arise  out of the partial laws and customs of society.—This view restrained her  fancy."* It was necessary for her, to place in a striking point of view, evils  that are too frequently overlooked, and to drag into light those details of  oppression, of which the grosser and more insensible part of mankind make  little account.      * See author's preface.
