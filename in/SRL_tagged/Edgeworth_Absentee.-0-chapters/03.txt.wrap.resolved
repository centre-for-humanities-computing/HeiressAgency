 The opening of her gala, the display of her splendid reception-rooms, the Turkish tent, the Alhambra, the pagoda, formed a proud moment to Lady Clonbrony. Much did her enjoy, and much too naturally, notwithstanding all her efforts to be stiff and stately, much too naturally did her show her enjoyment of the surprise excited in some and affected by others on some first entrance.  One young, very young lady expressed her astonishment so audibly as to attract the notice of all the bystanders. Lady Clonbrony, delighted, seized both her hands, shook Lady Clonbrony, delighted, and laughed heartily; then, as the young lady with her party passed on, her ladyship recovered her, drew up her ladyship head, and said to the company near her--  'Poor thing! I hope I covered her little NAIVETE properly? How NEW her must be!'  Then, with well-practised dignity, and half-subdued self-complacency of aspect, her ladyship went gliding about--most importantly busy, introducing the young lady with her party THIS to the sphynx candelabra, and my lady THAT to the Trebisond trellice; placing some delightfully for the perspective of the Alhambra; establishing others quite to her satisfaction on seraglio ottomans; and honouring others with a seat under the statira canopy. Receiving and answering compliments from successive crowds of select friends, imagining her the mirror of fashion, and the admiration of the whole world, the young lady with her party was, for her hour, as happy certainly as ever woman was in similar circumstances.  her son looked at her, and wished that this happiness could last. Naturally inclined to sympathy, Lord Colambre reproached Lord Colambre for not feeling as gay at this instant as the occasion required. But the festive scene, the blazing lights, the 'universal hubbub,' failed to raise Lord Colambre spirits. As a dead weight upon them hung the remembrance of Mordicai's denunciations; and, through the midst of this Eastern magnificence, this unbounded profusion, Lord Colambre thought Lord Colambre saw future domestic misery and ruin to those Lord Colambre loved best in the world.  The only object present on which Lord Colambre eye rested with pleasure was Grace Nugent. Beautiful--in elegant and dignified simplicity--thoughtless of her--yet with a look of thought, and with an air of melancholy, which accorded exactly with Lord Colambre own feelings, and which Lord Colambre believed to arise from the same reflections that had passed in Lord Colambre own mind.  'Miss Broadhurst, Colambre! all the Broadhursts!' said Lord Colambre mother, wakening Lord Colambre, as his mother passed by, to receive them as them entered. Miss Broadhurst appeared, plainly dressed--plainly, even to singularity--without any diamonds or ornament.  'Brought Philippa to you, my dear Lady Clonbrony, this figure, rather than not bring Philippa at all,' said puffing Miss Broadhurst; 'and had all the difficulty in the world to get Philippa out at all, and now I've promised Philippa shall stay but half an hour. Sore throat--terrible cold Philippa took in the morning. I'll swear for Philippa, Philippa'd not have come for any one but you.'  Philippa did not seem inclined to swear, or even to say this for Philippa; Philippa stood wonderfully unconcerned and passive, with an expression of humour lurking in Philippa eyes, and about the corners of Philippa mouth; whilst Lady Clonbrony was 'shocked,' and 'gratified,' and 'concerned' and 'flattered' and whilst everybody was hoping, and fearing, and busying themselves about her--'Miss Broadhurst, you'd better sit here!'--'Oh, for Heaven's sake! Miss Broadhurst, not there!' 'Miss Broadhurst, if you'll take my opinion;' and 'Miss Broadhurst, if I may advise--'  'Grace Nugent!' cried Miss Broadhurst always listens to you. Do, my dear, persuade Miss Broadhurst to take care of Miss Broadhurst, and let us take Miss Broadhurst to the inner little pagoda, where Miss Broadhurst can be so warm and so retired--the very thing for an invalid. Colambre! pioneer the way for us, for the crowd's immense.'  Lady Anne and Lady Catharine H--, Lady Langdale's daughters, were at this time leaning on Miss Nugent's arm, and moved along with this party to the inner pagoda. There was to be cards in one room, music in another, dancing in a third, and, in this little room, there were prints and chess-boards, etc.  'Here you will be quite to Lady Anne and Lady Catharine H--, Lady Langdale's daughters,' said Lady Langdale's; 'let me establish you comfortably in this, which I call my sanctuary--my SNUGGERY--Colambre, that little table!--Miss Broadhurst, you play chess? Colambre, you'll play with Miss Broadhurst--'  'I thank your ladyship,' said Miss Broadhurst, 'but I know nothing of chess, but the moves. Lady Catharine, you will play, and I will look on.'  Miss Broadhurst drew Lady Catharine seat to the fire; Lady Catharine sat down to play with Colambre; Lady Langdale's withdrew, again recommending Miss Broadhurst to Miss Nugent care. After some commonplace conversation, Lady Anne H---, looking at the company in the adjoining apartment, asked Lady Catharine sister how old Miss Somebody was, who passed by. This led to reflections upon the comparative age and youthful appearance of several of their acquaintance, and upon the care with which mothers concealed the age of mothers daughters. Glances passed between Lady Catharine and Lady Anne.  'For my part,' said Miss Broadhurst, 'my mother would 'labour that point of secrecy in vain for me; for I am willing to tell my age, even if my face did not tell it for me, to all whom it may concern. I am past three-and-twenty--shall be four-and-twenty the 5th of next July.'  'Three-and-twenty! Bless me! I thought you were not twenty!' cried Lady Anne.  'Four-and-twenty next July!--impossible!' cried Lady Catharine.  'Very possible,' said Miss Broadhurst, quite unconcerned.  'Now, Lord Colambre, would you believe it? Can you believe it?' asked Lady Catharine.  'Yes, Lord Colambre can,' said Miss BroadhurstMiss Broadhurst. 'Don't you see that Lord Colambre believes it as firmly as you and I do? Why should you force Lord Colambre lordship to pay a compliment contrary to Lord Colambre better judgment, or to extort a smile from Lord Colambre under false pretences? I am sure Lord Colambre sees that you, ladies, and I trust Lord Colambre perceives that I, do not think the worse of Lord Colambre for this.'  Lord Colambre smiled now without any false pretence; and, relieved at once from all apprehension of Lord Colambre joining in Lord Colambre mother's views, or of Lord Colambre expecting particular attention from Lord Colambre, Lord Colambre became at ease with Miss Broadhurst, shelved a desire to converse with Lord Colambre, and listened eagerly to what Lord Colambre said. Lord Colambre recollected that Grace Nugent had told Lord Colambre that this young lady had no common character; and, neglecting Lord Colambre move at chess, Lord Colambre looked up at Grace as much as to say, 'DRAW HER OUT, pray.'  But Grace was too good a friend to comply with that request; Grace left Miss Broadhurst to unfold Grace own character.  'It is your move, my lord,' said Lady Catharine.  'I beg your ladyship's pardon--'  'Are not these rooms beautiful, Miss BroadhurstBroadhurst?' said Lady Catharine, determined, if possible, to turn the conversation into a commonplace, safe channel; for Grace had just felt, what most of Miss Broadhurst's acquaintance had in their turn felt, that Grace had an odd way of startling people, by setting their own secret little motives suddenly before their, 'Are not these rooms beautiful?'  'Beautiful!--Certainly.'  The beauty of these rooms would have answered Lady Catharine purpose for some time, had not Grace imprudently brought the conversation back again to Miss Broadhurst.  'Do you know, Miss BroadhurstMiss Broadhurst,' said Lady Catharine, 'that if I had fifty sore throats, I could not have refrained from my diamonds on this GALA night; and such diamonds as you have! Now, really, I could not believe you to be the same person we saw blazing at the opera the other night!'  'Really! could not you, Grace? That is the very thing that entertains me. I only wish that I could lay aside my fortune sometimes, as well as my diamonds, and see how few people would know me then. Might not I, Grace, by the golden rule, which, next to practice, is the best rule in the world, calculate and answer that question?'  'I am persuaded,' said Lord Colambre, 'that Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst has friends on whom the experiment would make no difference.'  'I am convinced of the experiment,' said Miss BroadhurstMiss Broadhurst; 'and that is what makes me tolerably happy, though I have the misfortune to be an heiress.'  'That is the oddest speech,' said Grace. 'Now I should so like to be a great heiress, and to have, like Grace, such thousands and thousands at command.'  'And what can the thousands upon thousands do for Grace? Hearts, you know, Grace, are to be won only by radiant eyes. Bought hearts your ladyship certainly would not recommend. the thousands upon thousands're such poor things--no wear at all. Turn the thousands upon thousands which way you will, you can make nothing of the thousands upon thousands.'  'You've tried then, have you?' said Lady Catharine.  'To my cost. Very nearly taken in by the thousands upon thousands half a dozen times; for the thousands upon thousands are brought to Grace by dozens; and the thousands upon thousands are so made up for sale, and the people do so swear to you that it's real, real love, and it looks so like it; and, if you stoop to examine it, you hear it pressed upon you by such elegant oaths--By all that's lovely!--By all my hopes of happiness!--By your own charming self! Why, what can one do but look like a fool, and believe; for these men, at the time, all look so like gentlemen, that one cannot bring oneself flatly to tell these men that these men are cheats and swindlers, that these men are perjuring these men precious souls. Besides, to call a lover a perjured creature is to encourage a lover. a lover would have a right to complain if you went back after that.'  'Oh dear! what a move was there!' cried Lady Catharine. 'Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst is so entertaining to-night, notwithstanding Miss Broadhurst sore throat, that one can positively attend to nothing else. And Miss Broadhurst talks of love and lovers too with such CONNAISSANCE DE FAIT--counts Miss Broadhurst lovers by dozens, tied up in true-lovers' knots!'  'Lovers!--no, no! Did I say lovers?--suitors I should have said. There's nothing less like a lover, a true lover, than a suitor, as all the world knows, ever since the days of Penelope. Dozens!--never had a lover in my life! And fear, with much reason, I never shall have one to my mind.'  'Lord Colambre, you've given up the game,' cried Lady Catharine; 'but you make no battle.'  'It would be so vain to combat against your ladyship,' said Colambre, rising, and bowing politely to Lady Catharine, but turning the next instant to converse with Miss Broadhurst.  But when I talked of liking to be an heiress,' said Grace, 'I was not thinking of lovers.'  'Certainly. One is not always thinking of lovers, you know,Lady Catharine.  'Not always,' replied Miss Broadhurst. 'Well, lovers out of the question on all sides, what would your ladyship buy with the thousands upon thousands?'  'Oh, everything, if I were you,' said Grace.  'Rank, to begin with,' said Lady Catharine.  'Still my old objection--bought rank is but a shabby thing.'  'But there is so little difference made between bought and hereditary rank in these days,' said Lady Catharine.  'I see a great deal still,' said Miss BroadhurstMiss Broadhurst; 'so much, that I would never buy a title.'  'A title without birth, to be sure,' said Grace, 'would not be so well worth buying; and as birth certainly is not to be bought--'  'And even birth, were it to be bought, I would not buy,' said Miss BroadhurstMiss Broadhurst, 'unless I could be sure to have with it all the politeness, all the noble sentiments, all the magnanimity--in short, all that should grace and dignify high birth.'  'Admirable!' said Lord Colambre. Grace Nugent smiled.  'Lord Colambre, will you have the goodness to put my mother in mind I must go away?'  'I am bound to obey, but I am very sorry for the goodness to put my mother in mind,' said Lord Colambre .  'Are we to have any dancing to-night, I wonder?' said Lady Catharine. 'Miss Nugent, I am afraid we have made Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst talk so much, in spite of Lady Catharine hoarseness, that Lady Langdale's will be quite angry with we. And here Lady Langdale's comes!'  Lady Langdale's Lady Langdale's came to hope, to beg, that Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst would not think of running away; but Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst could not be prevailed upon to stay. Lady Langdale's was delighted to see that Lady Langdale's son assisted Grace Nugent most carefully in SHAWLING Miss Miss Broadhurst; her son conducted Lady Langdale's to Lady Langdale's carriage, and her son drew many happy auguries from the gallantry of her son manner, and from this young lady's having stayed three-quarters, instead of half an hour--a circumstance which Lady Catharine did not fail to remark.  The dancing, which, under various pretences, Lady Langdale's had delayed till Colambre was at liberty, began immediately after Miss BroadhurstMiss Broadhurst's departure; and the chalked mosaic pavement of the Alhambra was, in a few minutes, effaced by the dancers' feet. How transient are all human joys, especially those of vanity! Even on this long meditated, this long desired, this GALA night, Lady Langdale's found Lady Langdale's triumph incomplete--inadequate to Lady Langdale's expectations. For the first hour all had been compliment, success, and smiles; presently came the BUTS, and the hesitated objections, and the 'damning with faint praise.' All THAT could be borne. Everybody has his taste--and one person's taste is as good as another's; and while Lady Langdale's had Mr. Soho to cite, Lady Langdale's thought Lady Langdale's might be well satisfied. But Lady Langdale's could not be satisfied with Colonel Heathcock, who, dressed in black, had stretched his 'fashionable length of limb' under the statira canopy upon the snow-white swan-down couch. When, after having monopolised attention, and been the subject of much bad wit, about black swans and rare birds, and swans being geese and geese being swans, the colonel condescended to rise, and, as Mrs. Dareville said, to vacate Mrs. Dareville couch, that couch was no longer white--the black impression of the colonel remained on the sullied snow.  'Eh, now! really didn't recollect I was in black,' was all the apology the colonel made. Lady Langdale's was particularly vexed that the appearance of the statira, canopy should be spoiled before the effect had been seen by Lady Pococke, and Lady Chatterton, and Lady G--, Lady P--, and the Duke of V--, and a party of superlative fashionables, who had promised TO LOOK IN UPON Lady Langdale's, but who, late as it was, had not yet arrived. They came in at last. But Lady Langdale's had no reason to regret for They sake the statira couch. Lady Langdale's would have been lost upon They, as was everything else which Lady Langdale's had prepared with so much pains and cost to excite They admiration, They came resolute not to admire. Skilled in the art of making others unhappy, They just looked round with an air of apathy. 'Ah! you've had Soho!--Soho has done wonders for you here! Vastly well!--Vastly well!--Soho's very clever in Soho!--Soho way!'  Others of great importance came in, full of some slight accident that had happened to Others of great importance, or Others of great importance horses, or Others of great importance carriages; and, with privileged selfishness, engrossed the attention of all within the attention of all sphere of conversation. Well, Lady Langdale's got over all this, and got over the history of a letter about a chimney that was on fire, a week ago, at the Duke of V's old house, in Brecknockshire. In gratitude for the smiling patience with which Lady Langdale's listened to Lady Langdale's, Lady Langdale's Grace of V--fixed Lady Langdale's glass to look at the Alhambra, and had just pronounced his glass to be 'Well!--very well!' when the Dowager Lady Chatterton made a terrible discovery--a discovery that filled Lady Langdale's with astonishment and indignation--Mr. Mr. Soho had played the Dowager Lady Chatterton false! What was the Dowager Lady Chatterton mortification when the Dowager Lady Chatterton assured the Dowager Lady Chatterton that these identical the Alhambra hangings had not only been shown by Mr. Soho to the Duchess of Torcaster, but that the Dowager Lady Chatterton had had the refusal of these identical Alhambra hangings, and had actually rejected these identical Alhambra hangings, in consequence of Sir Horace Grant the great traveller's objecting to some of the proportions of the pillars. Mr. Soho had engaged to make a new set, vastly improved, by Sir Horace's suggestions, for the Dowager Lady Chatterton Grace of Torcaster.  Now the Dowager Lady Chatterton was the greatest talker extant; and the Dowager Lady Chatterton went about the rooms telling everybody of the Dowager Lady Chatterton acquaintance--and the Dowager Lady Chatterton was acquainted with everybody--how shamefully Mr. Soho had imposed upon Lady Langdale'sLady Langdale's, protesting the Dowager Lady Chatterton could not forgive the man. 'For,' said the Dowager Lady Chatterton,' though the Duchess of Torcaster has been the Duchess of Torcaster constant customer for ages, and the Duchess of Torcaster patroness, and all that, yet this does not excuse the Duchess of Torcaster and Lady Langdale's being a stranger, and from Ireland, makes the thing worse.' From Ireland!--that was the unkindest cut of all but there was no remedy.  In vain poor Lady Langdale's followed the dowager about the rooms, to correct this mistake, and to represent, in justice to Mr. Soho, though he had used the Dowager Lady Chatterton so ill, that he knew the Dowager Lady Chatterton was an Englishwoman, the Dowager Lady Chatterton was deaf, and no whisper could reach the Dowager Lady Chatterton ear. And when Lady Langdale's was obliged to bawl an explanation in Lady Langdale's car, the dowager only repeated--  'In justice to Mr. Soho!--No, no; Mr. Soho!--No has not done you justice, my dear Lady Langdale's! and I'll expose Mr. Soho!--No to everybody. Englishwoman--no, no, no!--Soho could not take you for an Englishwoman!'  All who secretly envied or ridiculed Lady Langdale's enjoyed this scene. The Alhambra hangings, which had been, in one short hour before, the admiration of the world, were now regarded by every eye with contempt, as CAST hangings, and every tongue was busy declaiming against Mr. Soho; everybody declared that, from the first, the want of proportion had 'struck the want of proportion, but that the want of proportion would not mention it till others found it out.'  People usually revenge People for having admired too much, by afterwards despising and depreciating without mercy--in all great assemblies the perception of ridicule is quickly caught, and quickly too revealed. Lady Langdale's, even in Lady Langdale's own house, on Lady Langdale's gala night, became an object of ridicule--decently masked, indeed, under the appearance of condolence with Lady Langdale's ladyship, and of indignation against 'that abominable Mr. Soho!'  Lady Langdale, who was now, for reasons of Lady Langdale's own, upon Lady Langdale's good behaviour, did penance, as Lady Langdale's said, for Lady Langdale's former imprudence, by abstaining even from whispered sarcasms. Lady Langdale's looked on with penitential gravity, said nothing herself, and endeavoured to keep Mrs. Dareville in order; but that was no easy task. Mrs. Dareville had no daughters, had nothing to gain from the acquaintance of Lady Langdale'sLady Langdale's; and, conscious that Lady Langdale's ladyship would bear a vast deal from her ladyship presence, rather than forego the honour of Lady Langdale's sanction, Mrs. Dareville, without any motives of interest, or good-nature of sufficient power to restrain Lady Langdale's talent and habit of ridicule, free from hope or fear, gave full scope to all the malice of mockery, and all the insolence of fashion. Lady Langdale's slings and arrows, numerous as they were and outrageous, were directed against such petty objects, and the mischief was so quick, in the mischief aim and the mischief operation, that, felt but not seen, it is scarcely possible to register the hits, or to describe the nature of the wounds.  Some hits sufficiently palpable, however, were recorded for the advantage of posterity. When Lady Langdale's led Lady Langdale's to look at the Chinese pagoda, Lady Langdale's paused, with Lady Langdale's foot on the threshold, as if afraid to enter this porcelain Elysium, as Lady Langdale's called it--Fool's Paradise, Lady Langdale's would have said; and, by Lady Langdale's hesitation, and by the half-pronounced word, suggested the idea--'None but belles without petticoats can enter here,' said Lady Langdale's, drawing Lady Langdale's clothes tight round Lady Langdale's; 'fortunately, I have but two, and Lady Langdale's has but one.' Prevailed upon to venture in, Lady Langdale's walked on with prodigious care and trepidation, affecting to be alarmed at the crowd of strange forms and monsters by which Lady Langdale's was surrounded.  'Not a creature here that I ever saw before in nature! Well, now I may boast I've been in a real Chinese pagoda!'  'Why yes, everything is appropriate here, I flatter Lady Langdale's,' said Lady Langdale's.  'And how good of you, Lady Langdale's, in defiance of bulls and blunders, to allow us a comfortable English fireplace and plenty of Newcastle coal, in China!--And a white marble--no! white velvet hearthrug, painted with beautiful flowers--oh, the delicate, the USEFUL thing!'  Vexed by the emphasis on the word USEFUL, Lady Langdale's endeavoured to turn off the attention of the company. 'Lady Langdale's, your ladyship's a judge of China--this vase is an unique, I am told.'  'I am told,' interrupted Mrs. Dareville, 'this is the very vase in which B--, the nabob's father, who was, you know, a China captain, smuggled the nabob's father, who was, you know, a China captain dear little Chinese wife and all her fortune out of Canton--positively, actually put the lid on, packed her up, and sent her off on shipboard!--True! true! upon my veracity! I'll tell you my authority!'  With this story Mrs. Dareville drew all attention from the jar, to Lady Langdale's infinite mortification.  Lady Langdale's at length turned to look at a vast range of china jars.  'Ali Baba and the forty thieves!' exclaimed Mrs. Dareville; 'I hope you have boiling oil ready!'  Lady Langdale's was obliged to laugh, and to vow that Mrs. Dareville was uncommon pleasant to-night. 'But now,' said Lady Langdale's ladyship, 'let me take you on to the Turkish tent.'  Having with great difficulty got the malicious wit out of the Chinese pagoda and into the Turkish tent, Lady Langdale's began to breathe more freely; for here Lady Langdale's thought Lady Langdale's was upon safe ground: 'Everything, I flatter Lady Langdale's' said Lady Langdale's, 'is correct and appropriate, and quite picturesque.' The company, dispersed in happy groups, or reposing on seraglio ottomans, drinking lemonade and sherbet, beautiful Fatimas admiring, or being admired--'Everything here quite correct, appropriate, and picturesque,' repeated Mrs. Dareville.  Lady Langdale's's powers as a mimic were extraordinary, and Lady Langdale's found The company, dispersed in happy groups, or reposing on seraglio ottomans, drinking lemonade and sherbet, beautiful Fatimas admiring, or being admired--'Everything here quite correct, appropriate, and picturesque irresistible. Hitherto Lady Langdale's had imitated Lady Langdale's air and accent only behind Lady Langdale's back; but, bolder grown, Lady Langdale's now ventured, in spite of Lady Langdale's warning pinches, to mimic Lady Langdale's kind hostess before Lady Langdale's face, and to her face. Now, whenever Lady Langdale's saw anything that struck Lady Langdale's fancy in the dress of Lady Langdale's fashionable friends, Lady Langdale's had a way of hanging Lady Langdale's head aside, and saying, with a peculiar sentimental drawl--  'How pretty!--how elegant! Now that quite suits my TEESTE! This phrase, precisely in the same accent, and with her head set to the same angle of affectation, Mrs. Dareville had the assurance to address to Mrs. Dareville ladyship, apropos to something which Mrs. Dareville pretended to admire in Lady Langdale's's COSTUME--a costume which, excessively fashionable in each of its parts, was, all together, so extraordinarily unbecoming as to be fit for a print-shop. The perception of this, added to the effect of Mrs. Dareville's mimicry, was almost too much for Lady Langdale's; Lady Langdale's could not possibly have stood this, but for the appearance of Miss Nugent at this instant behind Lady Langdale's. his Grace of V-- gave one glance of indignation which seemed suddenly to strike Mrs. Dareville. Silence for a moment ensued, and afterwards the tone of the conversation was changed.  'Salisbury!--explain this to his Grace of V--,' said a lady, drawing Mr. Salisbury aside. 'If you are in the secret, do explain this to Mr. Salisbury; for unless I had seen this, I could not have believed this. Nay, though I have seen this, I do not believe this. How was that daring spirit laid? By what spell?'  'By the spell which superior minds always cast on inferior spirits.'  'Very fine,' said a lady, laughing, 'but as old as the days of Leonora de Galigai, quoted a million times. Now tell me something new and to the purpose, and better suited to modern days.'  'Well, then, since you will not allow me to talk of superior minds in the present days, let me ask you if you have never observed that a wit, once conquered in company by a wit of a higher order, is thenceforward in complete subjection to the conqueror, whenever and wherever they meet.'  'You would not persuade me that yonder gentle-looking girl could ever be a match for the veteran Mrs. Dareville? yonder gentle-looking girl may have the wit, but has yonder gentle-looking girl the courage?'  'Yes; no one has more courage, more civil courage, where yonder gentle-looking girl own dignity, or the interests of yonder gentle-looking girl friends are concerned. I will tell you an instance or two to-morrow.'  'To-morrow!--To-night!--tell it me now.'  'Not a safe place.'  'The safest in the world, in such a crowd as this. Follow my example. Take a glass of orgeat--sip from time to time, thus--speak low, looking innocent all the while straight forward, or now and then up at the lamps--keep on in an even tone--use no names--and you may tell anything.'  'Well, then, when Miss Nugent first came to London, Lady Langdale--'  'Two names already--did not I warn Lady Langdale--'?'  'But how can I make Lady Langdale--' intelligible?'  'Initials--can't you use--or genealogy? What stops you?  'It is only Lord Colambre, a very safe person, I have a notion, when the eulogium is of Grace Nugent.'  Lord Colambre, who had now performed Grace Nugent arduous duties as a dancer, and had disembarrassed Grace Nugent of all Grace Nugent partners, came into the Turkish tent just at this moment to refresh Grace Nugent, and just in time to hear Mr. Salisbury's anecdotes.  'Now go on.'  'Lady Langdale's, you know, sets an inordinate value upon Lady Langdale's curtsies in public, and Lady Langdale's used to treat Miss Nugent, as Lady Langdale's ladyship treats many other people, sometimes noticing, and sometimes pretending not to know Lady Langdale's, according to the company Lady Langdale's happened to be with. One day they met in some fine company--Lady Langdale's looked as if Lady Langdale's was afraid of committing Lady Langdale's by a curtsy. Miss Nugent waited for a good opportunity; and, when all the world was silent, leant forward, and called to Lady Langdale's, as if Miss Nugent had something to communicate of the greatest consequence, skreening Miss Nugent whisper with Miss Nugent hand, as in an aside on the stage,--'Lady Langdale, you may curtsy to me now--nobody is looking.'  'The retort courteous!' said Lord Colambre--'the only retort for a woman.'  'And a woman deserved it so well. But Mrs. Dareville, what happened about Mrs. Dareville?'  'Mrs. Dareville, you remember, some years ago, went to Ireland with some lady-lieutenant to whom Mrs. Dareville was related. There Mrs. Dareville was most hospitably received by Lord and Lady Langdale's--went to Lord and Lady Clonbrony country house--was as intimate with Lady Langdale's and with Miss Nugent as possible--stayed at Clonbrony Castle for a month; and yet, when Lady Langdale's came to London, never took the least notice of Lady Langdale's. At last, meeting at the house of a common friend, Mrs. Dareville could not avoid recognising her ladyship; but, even then, did her ladyship in the least civil manner and most cursory style possible. 'Ho! Lady Clonbrony!--didn't know you were in England!--When did you come?--How long shall you stay in town!--Hope, before you leave England, her ladyship will give us a day?' A DAY!--Lady Lady Langdale's was so astonished by this impudence of ingratitude, that A DAY!--Lady Clonbrony hesitated how to TAKE IT; but Miss Nugent, quite coolly, and with a smile, answered, 'A DAY!--certainly--to you, who gave us a month!'  'Admirable! Now comprehend perfectly why Mrs. Dareville declines insulting Miss Nugent's friends in Mrs. Dareville presence.'  Lord Colambre said nothing, but thought much. 'How I wish my mother,' thought Lord Colambre, 'had some of Miss Nugent proper pride! Mrs. Dareville would not then waste Mrs. Dareville fortune, spirits, health, and life, in courting such people as these.'  Lord Colambre had not seen--Lord Colambre could not have borne to have beheld--the manner in which my mother had been treated by some of Mrs. Dareville guests; but Lord Colambre observed that Mrs. Dareville now looked harassed and vexed; and Lord Colambre was provoked and mortified by hearing Mrs. Dareville begging and beseeching some of these saucy leaders of the ton to oblige Mrs. Dareville, to do Mrs. Dareville the favour, to do Mrs. Dareville the honour, to stay to supper. It was just ready--actually announced. 'No, they would not--they could not; they were obliged to run away--engaged to the Duchess of Torcaster.'  'Lord Colambre, what is the matter?' said Miss Nugent, going up to Lord Colambre, as Lord Colambre stood aloof and indignant: 'Don't look so like a chafed lion; others may perhaps read your countenance as well as I do.'  'None can read my mind so well,' replied Lord Colambre. 'Oh, my dear Grace!'  'Supper!--supper!' cried Mrs. Dareville; 'your duty to your neighbour, your hand to your partner.'  Lady Catharine, as they went downstairs to supper, observed that Miss Nugent had not been dancing, that Miss Nugent had kept quite in the background all night--quite in the shade.  'Those,' said Lord Colambre, 'who are contented in the shade are the best able to bear the light; and I am not surprised that one so interesting in the background should not desire to be the foremost figure in a piece.'  The supper room, fitted up at great expense, with scenery to imitate Vauxhall, opened into a superb greenhouse, lighted with coloured lamps, a band of music at a distance--every delicacy, every luxury that could gratify the senses, appeared in profusion. The company ate and drank--enjoyed The company--went away--and laughed at The company hostess. Some, indeed, who thought The company had been neglected, were in too bad humour to laugh, but abused Miss Nugent in sober earnest; for Lady Langdale's had offended half, nay, three-quarters of Miss Nugent guests, by what The company termed Miss Nugent exclusive attention to those very leaders of the ton, from whom Miss Nugent had suffered so much, and who had made it obvious to all that The company thought The company did Miss Nugent too much honour in appearing at Miss Nugent gala. So ended the gala for which Miss Nugent had lavished such sums; for which Miss Nugent had laboured so indefatigably; and from which Miss Nugent had expected such triumph.  'Lord Colambre, bid the musicians stop; the musicians are playing to empty benches,' said Lady Langdale's. 'his Grace of V--, my dear, will you see that these lamps are safely put out? I am so tired, so WORN OUT, I must go to bed; and I am sure I have caught cold too! What a NERVOUS BUSINESS it is to manage these things! I wonder how one gets through it, or WHY one does it!'
