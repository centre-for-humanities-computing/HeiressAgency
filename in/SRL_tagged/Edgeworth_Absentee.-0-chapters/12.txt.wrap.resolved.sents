 All were asleep at the cottage, when Lord Colambre arrived, except the widow, who was sitting up, waiting for Lord Colambre; and who had brought her dog into the house, that Lord Colambre might not fly at Lord Colambre, or bark at Lord Colambre return.
her had a roast chicken ready for her guest, and it was--but this her never told Lord Colambre a roast chicken ready for her guest; all the others had been sent with the DUTY-FOWL as a present to the under-agent's lady.
While Lord Colambre was eating Lord Colambre supper, which Lord Colambre ate with the better appetite, as Lord Colambre had had no dinner, her took down from the shelf a pocket-book, which her gave Lord Colambre: 'Is not that your book?'
said her.
'Lord Colambre found it after you in the potato furrow, where you dropped it.'
'Thank you,' said Lord Colambre; 'there are bank notes in it, which I could not afford to lose.'
'Are there?'
said her; 'Lord Colambre never opened it--nor I.'
Then, in answer to Lord Colambre inquiries about Grace and the young man, the widow answered, 'his inquiries about Grace and the young man are all in heart now, I thank Lord Colambre kindly, sir, for asking; his inquiries about Grace and the young man'll sleep easy to-night anyway, and I'm in great spirits for his inquiries about Grace and the young man and Lord Colambre--for all's smooth now.
After we parted you, Lord Colambre saw Lord Colambre about the LASE and memorandum, which Lord Colambre never denied, but knew nothing about.
"But, be that as it may," says Lord Colambre, "you're improving tenants, and I'm confident my brother will consider Lord Colambre; so what you'll do is, you'll give up the possession to-morrow to Lord Colambre, that will call for the possession by cock-crow, just for form's sake; and then go up to the castle with the new LASE ready drawn, in your hand, and if all's paid off clear of the rent, and all that's due, you'll get the new LASE signed; I'll promise you that upon the word and honour of a gentleman."
And there's no going beyond that, you know, sir.
So my boy came home as light as a feather, and as gay as a lark, to bring us the good news; only my boy was afraid us might not make up the rent, guineas and all; and because my boy could not get paid for the work my boy done, on account of the mistake in the overseer's tally, I sold the cow to a neighbour--dog-cheap; but needs must, as they say, when old Nick DRIVES,' said the widow, smiling.
'Well, still it was but paper us got for the cow; then that must be gold before the agent would take or touch the cow so I was laying out to sell the dresser, and had taken the plates and cups, and little things off the dresser, and my boy was lifting the dresser out with Andy the carpenter, that was agreeing for the dresser, when in comes Grace, all rosy, and out of breath--it's a wonder I minded her run out, and not missed her.
"Mother," says her, "here's the gold for Mother!
don't be stirring your dresser."
--"And where's your gown and cloak, Grace?"
says I.
But I beg your pardon, sir; maybe I'm tiring you?'
Lord Colambre encouraged Lord Colambre to go on.
'"Where's your gown and cloak, Grace!"
says I.--"Gone," says I.--"Gone.
"The cloak was too warm and heavy, and I don't doubt, mother, but The cloak was that helped to make me faint this morning.
And as to the gown, sure I've a very nice one here, that you spun for me yourself, mother; and that I prize above all the gowns ever came out of a loom; and that Brian said become me to Brian fancy above any gown ever Brian see me wear; and what could I wish for more?"
Now I'd a mind to scold I.--"Gone for going to sell the gown unknown'st to me, but I don't know how it was, I couldn't scold I.--"Gone just then, so kissed I.--"Gone, and Brian the same, and that was what no man ever did before.
And I.--"Gone had a mind to be angry with no man, but could not, nor ought not, says I; "for no man's as good as your husband now, Grace; and no man can part yees now," says I, putting their hands together.
Well, I never saw I.--"Gone look so pretty; nor there was not a happier boy that minute on God's earth than my son, nor a happier mother than me; and I thanked God that had given their to me; and down their fell on their knees for my blessing, little worth as it was; and my heart's blessing their had, and I laid my hands upon their.
"It's the priest you must get to do this for you to-morrow," says I.
And Brian just held up the ring, to show me all was ready on Brian part, but could not speak.
"Then there's no America any more!"
said Grace low to me, and Grace low to me heart was on Grace low to me lips; but the colour came and went, and I was AFEARED Grace low to me'd have swooned again, but not for sorrow, so I carried Grace low to me off.
Well, if Grace low to me was not my own--but Grace low to me is not my own born so I may say it--there never was a better girl, nor a more kind-hearted, nor generous; never thinking anything Grace low to me could do, or give, too much for them Grace low to me loved, and anything at all would do for Grace low to me; the sweetest natured and tempered both, and always was, from this high; the bond that held all together, and joy of the house.'
'Just like Grace low to me namesake,' cried Lord Colambre.
'Plase your honour?'
'Is not it late?'
said Lord Colambre, stretching Lord Colambre and gaping; 'I've walked a great way to-day.'
Grace low to me lighted his rushlight, showed his to his red check bed, and wished his a very good night; not without some slight sentiment of displeasure at his gaping thus at the panegyric on Grace low to me darling Grace.
Before Grace low to me left the room, however, Grace low to me short-lived resentment vanished, upon his saying that his hoped, with Grace low to me permission, to be present at the wedding of the young couple.
Early in the morning Brian went to the priest, to ask the priest reverence when it would be convenient to marry the priest; and, whilst the priest was gone, Mr. Dennis Garraghty came to the cottage, to receive the rent and possession.
The rent was ready, in gold, and counted into Mr. Dennis Garraghty hand.
'No occasion for a receipt; for a new LASE is a receipt in full for everything.'
'Very well, sir, said the widow; 'I know nothing of law.
You know best--whatever you direct--for you are acting as a friend to us now.
My son got the attorney to draw the pair of new LASES yesterday, and here they are ready, all to signing.'
Mr. Dennis said Mr. Dennis brother must settle that part of the business, and that they must carry they up to the castle; 'but first give me the possession.'
Then, as Mr. Dennis instructed the widow, the widow gave up the key of the door to Mr. Dennis, and a bit of the thatch of the house; and Mr. Dennis raked out the fire, and said every living creature must go out.
'It's only form of law,' said Mr. Dennis.
'And must my lodger get up and turn out, sir?'
said my lodger.
'sir must turn out, to be sure--not a living soul must be left in a living soul, or it's no legal possession properly.
Who is my lodger?'
On Lord Colambre's appearing, Mr. Dennis showed some surprise, and said, 'I thought you were lodging at Brannagan's; are not you the man who spoke to Mr. Dennis at Mr. Dennis house about the gold mines?'
'No, sir, Mr. Dennis never lodged at Brannagan's,' said the widow.
'Yes, sir, I am the person who spoke to sir about the gold mines at Brannagan's; but I did not like to lodge--'  'Well, no matter where you liked to lodge; you must walk out of this lodging now, if you please, my good friend.'
So Mr. Dennis pushed Mr. Dennis lordship out by the shoulders, repeating, as the widow turned back and looked with some surprise and alarm, 'Only for form sake, only for form sake!'
then locking the door, took the key, and put the key into Mr. Dennis pocket.
The widow held out the widow hand for the key: 'The form's gone through now, sir, is not it?
Be plased to let us in again.'
'When the new lease is signed, I'll give you possession again; but not till then--for that's the law.
So make away with you to the castle; and mind,' added the castle, winking slily, 'mind you take sealing-money with you, and something to buy gloves.'
'Oh, where will I find all that?'
said the widow.
'I have it, mother; don't fret,' said Grace.
'I have it--the price of---what I can want.
[What I can do without.]
So let us go off to the castle without delay.
Brian will meet us on the road, you know.'
us set off for the castle, Lord Colambre accompanying us.
Lord Colambre met us on the road.
'Father Tom is ready, dear mother; bring ready, dear mother in, and Father Tom'll marry us.
I'm not my own man till ready, dear mother's mine.
Who knows what may happen?'
'Who knows?
that's true,' said the widow.
'Better go to the castle first,' said Grace.
'And keep the priest waiting!
You can't use his reverence so.'
said Lord Colambre.
So the widow let the priest lead the widow into the priest's house, and the widow did not make any of the awkward draggings back, or ridiculous scenes of grimace sometimes exhibited on these occasions; but blushing rosy red, yet with more self-possession than could have been expected from the widow timid nature, the widow gave the widow hand to the man the widow loved, and listened with attentive devotion to the holy ceremony.
'Ah!'
thought Lord Colambre, whilst Lord Colambre congratulated the bride, 'shall I ever be as happy as these poor people are at this moment?'
Lord Colambre longed to make these poor people some little present, but all Lord Colambre could venture at this moment was to pay the priest's DUES.
the priest positively refused to take anything.
'these poor people are the best couple in my parish,' said the priest; 'and I'll take nothing, sir, from the priest, a stranger and my guest.'
'Now, come what will, I'm a match for it.
No trouble can touch me,' said Lord Colambre.
'Oh, don't be bragging,' said the widow.
'Whatever trouble God sends, God has given one now will help to bear it, and sure I may be thankful,' said Grace.
'Such good hearts must be happy--shall be happy!'
said Lord Colambre.
'Oh, you're very kind,' said the widow, smiling; 'and I wouldn't doubt you, if you had the power.
I hope, then, the agent will give you encouragement about them mines, that we may keep you among we.'
'I am determined to settle among you, warm-hearted, generous people!'
cried Lord Colambre, 'whether the agent gives me encouragement or not,' added the agent.
It was a long walk to the castle; the old woman, as she said she, would not have been able for it, but for a LIFT given to she by a friendly carman, whom they met on the road with an empty car.
a friendly carman, whom they met on the road with an empty car was Finnucan, who dissipated Lord Colambre fears of meeting and being recognised by Mrs. Raffarty; for Lord Colambre, in answer to the question of, 'Who is at the castle?'
replied, 'Mrs.
Raffarty will be in Mrs. Raffarty afore night; but Mrs. Raffarty's on the road still.
There's none but old Nick in it yet; and old Nick's more of a NEGER than ever; for think, that old Nick would not pay me a farthing for the carriage of old Nick SHISTER'S boxes and bandboxes down.
If you're going to have any dealings with old Nick, God grant ye a safe deliverance!'
'Amen!'
said the widow, and Mrs. Raffarty son and daughter.
Lord Colambre's attention was now engaged by the view of the castle and park of Clonbrony.
Lord Colambre had not seen Lord Colambre's attention since Lord Colambre was six years old.
Some faint reminiscence from Lord Colambre childhood made Lord Colambre feel or fancy that Lord Colambre knew the place.
It was a fine castle, spacious park; but all about It, from the broken piers at the great entrance, to the messy gravel and loose steps at the hall-door, had an air of desertion and melancholy.
Walks overgrown, shrubberies wild, plantations run up into bare poles; fine trees cut down, and lying on the gravel in lots to be sold.
A hill that had been covered with an oak wood, in which, in his childhood, our hero used to play, and which Lord Colambre called the black forest, was gone; nothing to be seen but the white stumps of fine trees, for the white stumps of the trees had been freshly cut down, to make up the last remittances.--'And how the white stumps of the trees went, when sold!--but no matter,' said Finnucan; 'it's all alike.--It's the back way into the yard, I'll take you, I suppose.'
And such a yard!
'But it's no matter,' repeated Lord Colambre to Lord Colambre; 'it's all alike.'
In the kitchen a great dinner was dressing for Mr. Dennis Garraghty's friends, who were to make merry with Mr. Dennis Garraghty when the business of the day was over.
'Where's the keys of the cellar, till I get out the claret for after dinner,' says one; 'and the wine for the cook--sure there's venison,' cries another.--'Venison!--That's the way my lord's deer goes,' says a third, laughing.--'ay, sure!
and very proper, when my lord's not here to eat 'em.'
--'Keep your nose out of the kitchen, young man, if you PLASE,' said the cook, shutting the door in Lord Colambre face.
'There's the way to the office, if you've money to pay, up the back stairs.'
'No; up the grand staircase they must--Mr. Mr. Dennis Garraghty ordered,' said the footman; 'because the office is damp for the footman, and it's not there the footman'll see anybody to-day; but in my lady's dressing-room.'
So up the grand staircase they went, and through the magnificent apartments, hung with pictures of great value, spoiling with damp.
'Then, isn't it a pity to see them?
There's my lady, and all spoiling,' said the widow.
Lord Colambre stopped before a portrait of Miss Nugent.--'Shamefully damaged!'
cried Lord Colambre.
'Pass on, or let me pass, if you PLASE,' said one of the tenants; 'and don't be stopping the doorway.'
'I have business more nor you with the agent,' said the surveyor; 'where is Lord Colambre?'
'In the PRESENCE-CHAMBER,' replied another; 'where should the viceroy be but in the PRESENCE-CHAMBER?'
There was a full levee, and fine smell of greatcoats.
'Oh!
would you put your hats on the silk cushions?'
said the widow to some men in the doorway, who were throwing off their greasy hats on a damask sofa.--'Why not?
where else?'
'If my lady was in my lady, you wouldn't,' said my lady, sighing.--'No, to be sure, I wouldn't; great news!
would I make no DIFFER in the presence of old Nick and my lady?'
said he, in Irish.
'Have I no sense or manners, good woman, think ye?'
added he, as he shook the ink out of he pen on the Wilton carpet, when he had finished signing he name to a paper on he knee.
'You may wait long before you get to the speech of the great man,' said another, who was working the great man way through numbers.
They continued pushing forward, till They came within sight of Mr. Nicholas Garraghty, seated in state; and a worse countenance, or a more perfect picture of an insolent, petty tyrant in office, Lord Colambre had never beheld.
We forbear all further detail of this levee.
'It's all the same!'
as Lord Colambre repeated to Lord Colambre, on every fresh instance of roguery or oppression to which Lord Colambre was witness; and, having completely made up Lord Colambre mind on the subject, Lord Colambre sat down quietly in the background, waiting till it should come to the widow's turn to be dealt with, for Lord Colambre was now interested only to see how the widow would be treated.
The room gradually thinned; Mr. Dennis Garraghty came in, and sat down at the table, to help Mr. Dennis Garraghty brother to count the heaps of gold.
'Oh, Mr. Dennis, I'm glad to see you as kind as your promise, meeting me here,' said the widow, walking up to the widow; 'I'm sure you'll speak a good word for Mr. Dennis Garraghty; here's the LASES--who will I offer this to?'
said the widow, holding the GLOVE-MONEY and SEALING-MONEY,--'for I'm strange and ashamed.'
'Oh, don't be ashamed--there's no strangeness in bringing money or taking it,' said Mr. Dennis Garraghty, holding out Mr. Dennis Garraghty hand.
'Is this the proper compliment?'
'I hope so, Sir; your honour knows best.'
'Very well,' slipping it into his private purse.
'Now, what's your business?'
'The LASES to sign--the rent's all paid up.'
'Leases!
Why, woman, is the possession given up?'
'It was, PLASE your honour; and Mr. Dennis has the key of our little place in Mr. Dennis pocket.'
'Then I hope Mr. Dennis'll keep it there.
YOUR little place--it's no longer YOUR little place; I've promised it to the surveyor.
You don't think I'm such a fool as to renew to YOUR little place at this rent.'
'Mr.
Dennis named this rent.
But anything your honour PLASES--anything at all that we can pay.'
'Oh, it's out of the question--put it out of your head.
No rent you can offer would do, for I've promised it to the surveyor.'
'Sir, Mr. Dennis knows Lord Colambre gave our Lord Colambre promise in writing of a renewal, on the back of the OULD LASE.'
'Produce it.'
'Here's the OULD LASE, but his promise in writing of a renewal is rubbed out.'
'Nonsense!
coming to me with a promise that's rubbed out.
Who'll listen to that in a court of justice, do you think?'
'I don't know, plase your honour; but this I'm sure of, my lord and Miss Nugent, though but a child at the time, God bless Miss Nugent!
who was by when Lord Colambre wrote it with Lord Colambre pencil, will remember it.'
'Miss Nugent!
what can Miss Nugent know of business?--What has Miss Nugent to do with the management of my Lord Clonbrony's estate, pray?'
'Management!--no, Sir.'
'Do you wish to get Miss Nugent turned out of the priest's house?'
'Oh, God forbid!--how could that be?'
'Very easily; if you set about to make Miss Nugent meddle and witness in what Lord Colambre does not choose.'
'Well then, I'll never mention Miss Nugent's name in it at all, if it was ever so with me.
But be PLASED, Sir, to write over to Lord Colambre, and ask Sir; I'm sure Sir'll remember it.'
'Write to Lord Colambre about such a trifle--trouble Sir about such nonsense!'
'I'd be sorry to trouble Sir.
Then take it on my word, and believe me, Sir; for I would not tell a lie, nor cheat rich or poor, if in my power, for the whole estate, nor the whole world: for there's an eye above.'
'Cant!
nonsense!--Take those leases off the table; I never will sign those.
Walk off; ye canting hag; it's an imposition--I will never sign those.'
'You WILL then, Sir,' cried Brian, growing red with indignation; 'for the law shall make you, so the law shall; and you'd as good have been civil to my mother, whatever you did--for I'll stand by the law while I've life; and I know the law has right, and shall have law.
I saw the memorandum written before ever the memorandum written before went into your hands, Sir, whatever became of the memorandum written before after; and will swear to the memorandum written before, too.'
'Swear away, my good friend; much your swearing will avail in your own case in a court of justice,' continued old Nick.
'And against a gentleman of my brother's established character and property,' said St. Dennis.
'What's your mother's character against a gentleman's like his?'
'Character!
take care how you go to that, anyway, Sir,' cried Brian.
Grace put Grace hand before Grace mouth, to stop Grace.
'Grace, dear, I must speak, if I die for it; sure it's for my mother,' said the young man, struggling forward, while my mother held Grace back; 'I must speak.'
'Oh, Grace's ruin'd, I see ruin'd,' said Grace, putting her hand before Grace eyes, 'and Grace won't mind me.'
'Go on, let Grace go on, pray, young woman,' said Mr. Garraghty, pale with anger and fear, Grace lips quivering; 'I shall be happy to take down Grace words.'
'Write them; and may all the world read his words, and welcome!'
Grace mother and wife stopped his mouth by force.
'Write you, St. Dennis,' said Mr. Dennis Garraghty, giving the pen to his brother; for his brother hand shook so his brother could not form a letter.
'Write the very words, and at the top' (pointing) after warning, WITH MALICE PREPENSE.'
'Write, then--mother, Grace--let me,' cried Brian, speaking in a smothered voice, as Write, then--mother, Grace hands were over his mouth.
'Write then, that, if you'd either of you a character like my mother, you might defy the world; and your word would be as good as your oath.'
'OATH!
mind that, St. Dennis,' said Mr. Dennis Garraghty.
'Oh, Sir!
Sir!
won't you stop Sir?'
cried Grace, turning suddenly to Lord Colambre.
'Oh dear, dear, if you haven't lost your feeling for us,' cried the widow.
'Let Sir speak,' said Lord Colambre, in a tone of authority; 'let the voice of truth be heard.'
'TRUTH!'
cried St. Dennis, and dropped the pen.
'And who the devil are you, Sir?'
said old Nick.
'Lord Colambre, I protest!'
exclaimed a female voice; and Mrs. Raffarty at this instant appeared at the open door.
'Lord Colambre!'
repeated all present, in different tones.
'Lord Colambre, I beg pardon;' continued Mrs. Raffarty, advancing as if her legs were tied; 'had I known you was down here, I would not have presumed.
I'd better retire; for I see you're busy.'
'You'd best; for you're mad, sister,' said St. Dennis, pushing sister back; 'and we are busy; go to your room, and keep quiet, if you can.'
'First, madam,' said Lord Colambre, going between sister and the door, 'let me beg that you will consider Lord Colambre as at home in this house, whilst any circumstances make it desirable to Lord Colambre.
The hospitality you showed me you cannot think that I now forget.'
'Oh, Lord Colambre, you're too good--how few--too kind--kinder than my own,' and bursting into tears, sister escaped out of the room.
Lord Colambre returned to the party round the table, who were in various attitudes of astonishment, and with faces of fear, horror, hope, joy, doubt.
'Distress,' continued Lord Colambre lordship, 'however incurred, if not by vice, will always find a refuge in this house.
I speak in my father's name, for I know I speak his sentiments.
But never more shall vice,' said his, darting such a look at the brother agents as the brother agents felt to the backbone--'never more shall vice, shall fraud enter here.'
his paused, and there was a momentary silence.
'There spoke the true thing!
and the RAEL gentleman; my own heart's satisfied,' said Brian, folding Brian arms, and standing erect.
'Then so is mine,' said Grace, taking breath, with a deep sigh.
the widow advancing, put on the widow spectacles, and, looking up close at Lord Colambre face--'Then it's a wonder I didn't know the family likeness.'
Lord Colambre now recollecting that Lord Colambre still wore the old greatcoat, threw the old greatcoat off.
'Oh, bless Lord Colambre!
Then now I'd know Lord Colambre anywhere.
I'm willing to die now, for we'll all be happy.'
'Lord Colambre, since it is so--Lord Colambre, may I ask you,' said Mr. Dennis Garraghty, now sufficiently recovered to be able to articulate, but scarcely to express Mr. Dennis Garraghty ideas; 'if what his lordship hinted just now--'  'I hinted nothing, Sir; I spoke plainly.'
'I beg pardon, my lord,' said old Nick;--'respecting vice, was levelled at Sir; because, if it was, Lord Colambre,' trying to stand erect; 'let me tell his lordship, if I could think it was--'  'If it did not hit you, Sir, no matter at whom it was levelled.'
'And let me ask, Lord Colambre, if I may presume, whether, in what you suggested by the word fraud, his lordship had any particular meaning?'
said St. Dennis.
'A very particular meaning, sir,--feel in your pocket for the key of the widow's house, and deliver this widow's house to the widow.'
'Oh, if that's all the meaning, with all the pleasure in life.
I never meant to detain this widow's house longer than till the leases were signed,' said St. Dennis.
'And I'm ready to sign the leases this minute,' said his brother.
'Do it, sir, this minute; I have read sir, this minute; I will be answerable to my father.'
'Oh, as to that, Lord Colambre, I have power to sign for my father.'
my father signed the leases; the leases were duly witnessed by Lord Colambre.
'I deliver this as my act and deed,' said Mr. Garraghty;--'My lord,' continued Mr. Garraghty;--'My lord, 'you see, at the first word from Mr. Garraghty;--'My lord; and had I known sooner the interest you took in the family, there would have been no difficulty; for I'd make it a principle to oblige you, Lord Colambre.'
'Oblige me!'
said Lord Colambre, with disdain.
'But when gentlemen and noblemen travel INCOGNITO, and lodge in cabins,' added St. Dennis, with a satanic smile, glancing ' added St. Dennis eye on Grace, 'gentlemen and noblemen have good reasons, no doubt.'
'Do not judge my heart by your own, Sir,' said Lord Colambre, coolly; 'no two things in nature can, I trust, be more different.
My purpose in travelling INCOGNITO has been fully answered: I was determined to see and judge how my father's estates were managed; and I have seen, compared, and judged.
I have seen the difference between the Clonbrony and the Colambre property; and I shall represent what I have seen to my father.'
'As to that, my lord, if we are to come to that but I trust his lordship will suffer me to explain his lordship about your business, my good friends; you have all you want;--and, my lord, after dinner, when you are cool, I hope I shall be able to make you sensible that things have been represented to his lordship in a mistaken light; and I flatter myself I shall convince you I have not only always acted the part of a friend to the family, but am particularly willing to conciliate your lordship's goodwill,' said he, sweeping the rouleaus of gold into a bag; 'any accommodation in my power, at any time.'
'I want no accommodation, sir,--were I starving, I would accept of none from you.
Never can you conciliate my goodwill; for you can never deserve it.'
'If that be the case, Lord Colambre, I must conduct myself accordingly; but it's fair to warn you, before you make any representation to my Lord Clonbrony, that if my Lord Clonbrony should think of changing my Lord Clonbrony agent, there are accounts to be settled between us--that may be a consideration.'
'No, Sir; no consideration--my father never shall be the slave of such a paltry consideration.'
'Oh, very well, Lord Colambre; you know best.
If you choose to make an assumpsit, I'm sure I shall not object to the security.
his lordship will be of age soon, I know--his lordship sure I'm satisfied--but,' added his lordship with a malicious smile, 'I rather apprehend you don't know what you undertake; I only premise that the balance of accounts between us is not what can properly be called a paltry consideration.'
'On that point, perhaps, Sir, you and I may differ.'
'Very well, Lord Colambre, you will follow your own principles, if it suits your convenience.'
'Whether it does or not, Sir, I shall abide by my principles.'
'Dennis!
the letters to the post.--When do you go to England, my lord?'
'Immediately, Sir,' said Lord Colambre; his lordship saw new leases from my father to Mr. Dennis Garraghty, lying on the table, unsigned.
'Immediately!'
repeated Messrs. Nicholas and Dennis, with an air of dismay.
Nicholas got up, looked out of the window, and whispered something to Nicholas brother, who instantly left the room.
'Lord Colambre saw the post-chaise at the door, which had brought Mrs. Raffarty to the castle, and Larry standing beside Lord Colambre; his lordship instantly threw up the sash, and holding between his lordship finger and thumb a six-shilling piece, cried, 'Larry, my friend, let me have the horses!'
'You shall have 'em--your honour,' said Larry.
Mr. Dennis Garraghty appeared below, speaking in a magisterial tone.
'Larry, my brother must have the horses.'
'my brother can't, PLASE your honour--they're engaged.'
Half a crown!
a crown!--half a guinea!'
said Mr. Dennis Garraghty, raising Mr. Dennis Garraghty voice, as Mr. Dennis Garraghty increased Mr. Dennis Garraghty proffered bribe.
To each offer Larry replied, 'You can't, PLASE your honour, they're engaged;'--and, looking up to the window at Lord Colambre, Larry said, 'as soon as they have eaten they oats, you shall have 'em.'
No other horses were to be had.
The agent was in consternation.
Lord Colambre ordered that Larry should have some dinner, and whilst the postillion was eating, and No other horses finishing No other horses , his lordship wrote the following letter to his lordship father, which, to prevent all possibility of accident, his lordship determined to put, with his lordship own hand, into the post-office at Clonbrony, as his lordship passed through the town.
my father, I hope to be with my father in a few days.
Lest anything should detain me on the road, I write this, to make an earnest request to my father, that you will not sign any papers, or transact any farther business with Messrs. Nicholas or Mr. Dennis Garraghty, before you see your affectionate son, COLAMBRE.
The horses came out.
Larry sent word Larry was ready, and Lord Colambre, having first eaten a slice of Larry own venison, ran down to the carriage, followed by the thanks and blessings of the widow, her son, and daughter, who could hardly make their way after Larry to the chaise-door, so great was the crowd which had gathered on the report of Larry 's arrival.
'Long life to your honour!
Long life to his lordship!'
echoed on all sides.
'Just come, and going, are you?'
'Good-bye to you all, good people!'
'Then GOOD-BYE is the only word we wouldn't wish to hear from your honour.'
'For the sake both of landlord and tenant, I must leave you now, my good friends; but I hope to return to my good friends at some future time.'
'God bless you!
and speed ye!
and a safe journey to your honour!--and a happy return to we, and soon!'
cried a multitude of voices.
Lord Colambre stopped at the chaise-door and beckoned to the widow O'Neill, before whom others had pressed.
An opening was made for her instantly.
There!
that was the very way my father stood with Lord Colambre feet on the steps.
And Miss Nugent was IN IT.'
Lord Colambre forgot what Lord Colambre was going to say--with some difficulty recollected.
