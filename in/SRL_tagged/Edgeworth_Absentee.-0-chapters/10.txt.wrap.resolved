 Towards the evening of the second day's journey, the driver of Lord Colambre's hackney chaise stopped, and jumping off the wooden bar, on which the driver of Lord Colambre's hackney chaise had been seated, exclaimed--  'We're come to the bad step, now. The bad road's beginning upon We, please your honour.'  'Bad road! that is very uncommon in this country. I never saw such fine roads as you have in Ireland.'  'That's true; and God bless your honour, that's sensible of that same, for it's not what all the foreign quality I drive have the manners to notice. God bless your honour! I heard you're a Welshman, but whether or no, I am sure you are a gentleman, anyway, Welsh or other.'  Notwithstanding the shabby greatcoat, the shrewd postillion perceived, by our hero's language, that the shrewd postillion was a gentleman. After much dragging at the horses' heads, and pushing and lifting, the carriage was got over what the shrewd postillion said was the worst part of the bad step; but as the road 'was not yet to say good,' the shrewd postillion continued walking beside the carriage.  'It's only bad just hereabouts, and that by accident,' said the shrewd postillion, 'on account of there being no jantleman resident in it, nor near; but only a bit of an under-agent, a great little rogue, who gets the shrewd postillion own turn out of the roads, and of everything else in life. I, Larry Brady, that am telling your honour, have a good right to know, for myself, and my father, and my brother. Pat Brady, the wheelwright, had once a farm under my brother; but was ruined, horse and foot, all along with my brother, and cast out, and my brother forced to fly the country, and is now working in some coachmaker's yard, in London; banished my brother is!--and here am I, forced to be what I am--and now that I'm reduced to drive a hack, the agent's a curse to myself still, with these bad roads, killing my horses and wheels and a shame to the country, which I think more of--Bad luck to my brother!'  'I know your brother; your brother lives with Mr. Mordicai, in Long Acre, in London.'  'Oh, God bless you for that!'  They came at this time within view of a range of about four-and-twenty men and boys, sitting astride on four-and-twenty heaps of broken stones, on each side of the road; They were all armed with hammers, with which They began to pound with great diligence and noise as soon as They saw the carriage. The chaise passed between these batteries, the stones flying on all sides.  'How are you, Jem?--How are you, Phil?' said Larry. 'But hold your hand, can't ye, while I stop and get the stones flying on all sides out of the horses' FEET. So you're making up the rent, are you, for St. Dennis?'  'Whoosh!' said one of the pounders, coming close to the postillion, and pointing St. Dennis thumb back towards The chaise. 'Who have you in it?'  'Oh, you need not scruple, St. Dennis's a very honest man; St. Dennis's only a man from North Wales, one Mr. Evans, an innocent jantleman, that's sent over to travel up and down the country, to find is there any copper mines in it.'  'How do you know, Larry?'  'Because I know very well, from one that was tould, and I SEEN St. Dennis tax the man of the King's Head, with a copper half-crown, at first sight, which was only lead to look at, you'd think, to them that was not skilful in copper. So lend me a knife, till I cut a linch-pin out of the hedge, for this one won't go far.'  Whilst Larry was making the linch-pin, all scruple being removed, Larry question about St. Dennis and the rent was answered.  'Ay, it's the rint, sure enough, we're pounding out for Larry; for Larry sent the driver round last-night-was-eight days, to warn we old Nick would be down a'-Monday, to take a sweep among we; and there's only six clear days, Saturday night, before the assizes, sure; so we must see and get the assizes finished anyway, to clear the presentment again' the swearing day, for the presentment and Paddy Hart is the overseers themselves, and Paddy is to swear to it.'  'St. Dennis, is it? Then you've one great comfort and security--that St. Dennis won't be PARTICULAR about the swearing; for since ever St. Dennis had St. Dennis head on St. Dennis shoulders, an oath never stuck in St. Dennis throat, more than in St. Dennis own brother, old Nick's.'  'St. Dennis head upon St. Dennis shoulders!' repeated Lord Colambre. 'Pray, did you ever hear that St. Dennis head was off St. Dennis's head ?'  'St. Dennis's head was off his shoulders never was, plase your honour, to my knowledge.'  'Did you never, among your saints, hear of St. Dennis carrying his head in St. Dennis hand?' said Lord Colambre.  'The RAEL saint!' said the postillion, suddenly changing St. Dennis tone, and looking shocked. 'Oh, don't be talking that way of your saints, plase your honour.'  'Then of what St, St. Dennis were you talking just now?--Whom do you mean by St. Dennis, and whom do you call old Nick?'  'Old Nick,' answered the postillion, coming close to the side of the carriage, and whispering--'Old Nick, plase your honour, is our nickname for one Nicholas Garraghty, Esq., of College Green, Dublin, and St. Dennis is his brother Dennis, who is old Nick's brother in all things, and would fain be a saint, only he is a sinner. he lives just by here, in the country, under-agent to Lord Clonbrony, as old Nick is upper-agent--it's only a joke among the people, that are not fond of the people at all. Lord Clonbrony is a very good jantleman, if Lord Clonbrony was not an absentee, resident in London, leaving us and everything to the likes of us and everything.'  Lord Clonbrony listened with all possible composure and attention; but the postillion having now made Lord Clonbrony linch-pin of wood, and FIXED Lord Clonbrony; Lord Clonbrony mounted Lord Clonbrony bar, and drove on, saying to Lord Clonbrony, as Lord Clonbrony looked at the road-makers--  'Poor CRATURES! Poor CRATURES couldn't keep Poor CRATURES cattle out of pound, or Poor CRATURES out of jail, but by making this road.'  'Is road-making, then, a very profitable business?--Have road-makers higher wages than other men in this part of the country?'  'It is, and it is not--Poor CRATURES have, and Poor CRATURES have not--plase your honour.'  'I don't understand you.'  'No, becaase you're an Englishman--that is, a Welshman--I beg your honour's pardon. But I'll tell you how that is, and I'll go slow over these broken stones for I can't go fast: it is where there's no jantleman over these under-agents, as here, they do as they plase; and when they have set the land they get rasonable from the head landlords, to poor cratures at a rack-rent, that they can't live and pay the rent, they say--'  'Who says?'  'Them under-agents, that have no conscience at all. Not all--but SOME, like Dennis, says, says Dennis, "I'll get you a road to make up the rent:" that is, plase your honour, the agent gets SOME, like Dennis a presentment for so many perches of road from the grand jury, at twice the price that would make the road. And tenants are, by this means, as tenants take the road by contract, at the price given by the county, able to pay all tenants get by the job, over and above potatoes and salt, back again to the agent, for the arrear on the land. Do I make your honour SENSIBLE?' [Do I make you understand?]  'You make me much more sensible than I ever was before,' said Lord Colambre; 'but is not this cheating the county?'  'Well, and suppose,' replied Larry, 'is not it all for my good, and Lord Colambre too, plase your honour?' said Larry, looking very shrewdly.  'My good!' said Lord Colambre, startled. 'What have I to do with it?'  'Haven't you to do with the roads as well as me, when you're travelling upon the roads as well as me, plase your honour? And sure, the roads as well as me'd never be got made at all, if the roads as well as me weren't made this ways; and it's the best way in the wide world, and the finest roads we have. And when the RAEL jantlemen's resident in the country, there's no jobbing can be, because the RAEL jantlemen's resident in the country, there's no jobbing're then the leading men on the grand jury; and these journeymen jantlemen are then kept in order, and all's right.'  Lord Colambre was much surprised at Larry's knowledge of the manner in which county business is managed, as well as by Lord Colambre shrewd good sense: Lord Colambre did not know that this is not uncommon in Lord Colambre rank of life in Ireland.  Whilst Larry was speaking, Lord Colambre was looking from side to side at the desolation of the prospect.  'So this is Lord Clonbrony estate, is it?'  'Ay, all you see, and as far and farther than you can see. Lord Colambre wrote, and ordered plantations here, time back; and enough was paid to labourers for ditching and planting. And, what next?--Why, what did the under-agent do, but let the goats in through gaps, left o' purpose, to bark the trees, and then the trees was all banished. And next, the cattle was let in trespassing, and winked at, till the land was all poached; and then the land was waste, and cried down; and St. Dennis wrote up to Dublin to old Nick, and St. Dennis over to the landlord, how none would take it, or bid anything at all for it; so then it fell to St. Dennis a cheap bargain. Oh, the tricks of them! who knows 'em, if I don't?'  Presently, Lord Colambre attention was roused again, by seeing a man running, as if for a man life, across a bog, near the roadside; a man leaped over the ditch, and was upon the road in an instant. a man seemed startled at first, at the sight of the carriage; but, looking at the postillion, Larry nodded, and Larry smiled and said--  'All's safe!'  'Pray, my good friend, may I ask what that is you have on your shoulder?' said Lord Clonbrony.  PLASE your honour, it is only a private still, which I've just caught out yonder in the bog; and I'm carrying it in with all speed to the gauger, to make a discovery, that the JANTLEMAN may benefit by the reward; I expect a man'll make me a compliment.'  'Get up behind, and I'll give you a lift,' said the postillion.  'Thank you kindly--but better my legs!' said a man; and turning down a lane, off a man ran again as fast as possible.  'Expect a man'll make me a compliment,' repeated Lord Colambre, 'to make a discovery!'  Ay, plase your honour; for the law is,' said Larry, 'that, if an unlawful still, that is, a still without license for whisky, is found, half the benefit of the fine that's put upon the parish goes to Lord Colambre that made the discovery; that's what a man is after, for a man's an informer.'  'I should not have thought, from what I see of you,' said Lord Clonbrony, smiling, 'that you, Larry, would have offered an informer a lift.'  'Oh, plase your honour!' said Larry, smiling archly, 'would not I give the laws a lift, when in my power?'  Scarcely had Larry uttered these words, and scarcely was an informer out of sight, when across the same bog, and over the ditch, came another man, a half kind of gentleman, with a red silk handkerchief about Larry neck, and a silver-handled whip in Larry hand.  'Did you see any man pass the road, friend?' said any man to the postillion.  'Oh! who would I see? or why would I tell?' replied Larry, in a sulky tone.  'Came, come, be smart!' said the man with the silver whip, offering to put half a crown into the postillion's hand; 'point me which way he took.'  'I'll have none a' your silver! don't touch me with it!' said Larry. 'But, if you'll take my advice, you'll strike across back, and follow the fields, out to Killogenesawee.'  The exciseman set out again immediately, in an opposite direction to that which the man who carried the still had taken. Lord Colambre now perceived that an informer had been running off to conceal a still of Lord Colambre own.  'The gauger, plase your honour,' said Larry, looking back at Lord Colambre; 'The gauger is a STILL-HUNTING!'  'And you put The gauger on a wrong scent!' said Lord Colambre.  'Sure, I told The gauger no lie; I only said, "If you'll take my advice." And why was The gauger such a fool as to take my advice, when I wouldn't take The gauger fee?'  'So this is the way, Larry, you give a lift to the laws!'  'If the laws would give a lift to me, plase your honour, maybe I'd do as much by the laws would give a lift to me. But it's only these revenue laws I mean; for me never, to my knowledge, broke another commandment; but it's what no honest poor man among his neighbours would scruple to take--a glass of POTSHEEN.'  'A glass of what, in the name of Heaven?' said Lord Colambre.  POTSHEEN, plase your honour;--becaase it's the little whisky that's made in the private still or pot; and SHEEN, becaase it's a fond word for whatsoever we'd like, and for what we have little of, and would make much of: after taking the glass of it, no man could go and inform to ruin the CRATURES, for they all shelter on that estate under favour of they all that go shares, and make rent of 'em--but I'd never inform again' 'em. And, after all, if the truth was known, and Lord Colambre Lord Colambre should be informed against, and presented, for it's Lord Colambre neglect is the bottom of the nuisance--'  'I find all the blame is thrown upon Lord ColambreLord Colambre,' said Lord Clonbrony.  'Becaase Becaase is absent,' said Larry. 'It would not be so was Becaase PRISINT. But your honour was talking to me about the laws. your honour's a stranger in the country, and astray about them things. Sure, why would I mind the laws, more than the quality, or the judge on the bench?'  'What do you mean?'  'Why! was not I PRISINT in the court-house me, when the JIDGE on the bench judging a still, and across the court came in one with a sly jug of POTSHEEN for the JIDGE himself, who prefarred it, when the right thing, to claret; and when I SEEN that, by the laws! a man might talk a man dumb to a man after again' potsheen, or in favour of the revenue, or revenue-officers. And there they may go on, with they gaugers, and they surveyors, and they supervisors, and they WATCHING-OFFICERS, and they coursing-officers, setting 'em one after another, or one over the head of another, or what way they will--we can baffle and laugh at 'em. Didn't I know, next door to we inn, last year, ten WATCHING-OFFICERS set upon one distiller, and one distiller was too cunning for ten WATCHING-OFFICERS; and it will always be so, while ever the people think it no sin. No, till then, not all ten WATCHING-OFFICERS dockets and permits signify a rush, or a turf. And the gauging rod even! who fears it? not all their dockets and permits may spare the gauging rod even! who fears it, for the gauging rod even! who fears it will never mend the child.'  How much longer Larry's dissertation on the distillery laws would have continued, had not Larry's dissertation on the distillery laws ideas been interrupted, we cannot guess; but Larry's dissertation on the distillery laws saw Larry's dissertation on the distillery laws was coming to This TOWN, and Larry's dissertation on the distillery laws gathered up the reins, and plied the whip, ambitious to make a figure in the eyes of the whip inhabitants.  This TOWN consisted of one row of miserable huts, sunk beneath the side of the road, the mud walls crooked in every direction; some of the mud walls opening in wide cracks, or zigzag fissures, from top to bottom, as if there had just been an earthquake--all the roofs sunk in various places--thatch off, or overgrown with grass--no chimneys, the smoke making its way through a hole in the roof, or rising in clouds from the top of the open door--dunghills before the doors, and green standing puddles--squalid children, with scarcely rags to cover green standing puddles--squalid children, gazing at the carriage.  'This TOWN,' said the postillion, 'once a snug place, when Lord Colambre Lord Colambre was at home to whitewash it, and the like.'  As they drove by, some men and women put some men and women heads through the smoke out of the cabins; pale women with long, black, or yellow locks--men with countenances and figures bereft of hope and energy.  'Wretched, wretched people!' said Lord Colambre.  'Then it's not 'Wretched, wretched people fault neither,' said Larry; 'for my own uncle's one of 'Wretched, wretched people, and as thriving and hard a working man as could be in all Ireland, Larry was, AFORE Larry was tramped under foot, and Larry heart broke. I was at Larry funeral, this time last year; and for it, may the agent's own heart, if Larry has any, burn--'  Lord Colambre interrupted this denunciation by touching Larry's shoulder, and asking some question, which, as Larry did not distinctly comprehend, Lord Colambre pulled up the reins, and the various noises of the vehicle stopped suddenly.  I did not hear well, plase your honour.'  'What are those people?' pointing to a man and woman, curious figures, who had come out of a cabin, the door of which the woman, who came out last, locked, and carefully hiding the key in the thatch, turned her back upon the man, and those people walked away in different directions: the woman bending under a huge bundle on her back, covered by a yellow petticoat turned over her shoulders; from the top of this bundle the head of an infant appeared; a little boy, almost naked, followed her with a kettle, and two girls, one of whom could but just walk, held her hand and clung to her ragged petticoat; forming, altogether, a complete group of beggars. her stopped, and looked back after the man.  the man was a Spanish-looking figure, with gray hair; a wallet hung at the end of a stick over one shoulder, a reaping-hook in the other hand; the man walked off stoutly, without ever casting a look behind the man.  'A kind harvest to you, John Dolan,' cried the postillion, 'and success to ye, Winny, with the quality. There's a luck-penny for the child to begin with,' added the child, throwing the child a penny. 'your honour, they're only poor CRATURES going up the country to beg, while the man goes over to reap the harvest in England. Nor this would not be, neither, if Lord Colambre was in this to give 'em EMPLOY. the man, now, was a good and a willing SLAVE in the man day: I mind the man working with the man in the shrubberies at Clonbrony Castle, when I was a boy--but I'll not be detaining your honour, now the road's better.'  the postillion drove on at a good rate for some time, till the postillion came to a piece of the road freshly covered with broken stones, where the postillion was obliged again to go slowly.  They overtook a string of cars, on which were piled up high, beds, tables, chairs, trunks, boxes, bandboxes.  'How are you, Finnucan? you've fine loading there--from Dublin, are you?'  'From Bray.'  'And what news?'  'GREAT news and bad, for old Nick, or some belonging to him, thanks be to Heaven! for the man hates him.'  'What's happened him?'  'him sister's husband that's failed, the great grocer that was, the man that had the wife that OW'D [Owned] the fine house near Bray, that they got that time the Parliament FLITTED, and that I seen in FLITTED carriage flaming--well, it's all out; they're all DONE UP.  'Tut! is that all? then they'll thrive, and set up again grander than ever, I'll engage; have not they old Nick for an attorney at they back? a good warrant!'  'Oh, trust a good warrant!'   for that! a good warrant!'   won't go security nor pay a farthing for a good warrant!'   SHISTER, nor wouldn't was his SHISTER a good warrant!'   father; I heard a good warrant!'   telling his SHISTER so, which I could not have done in his father place at that time, and his SHISTER crying as if his SHISTER heart would break, and I standing by in the parlour.'  'The NEGER! [NEGER, quasi negro; meo periculo, NIGGARD] And did a good warrant!'   speak that way, and you by?'  'Ay did a good warrant!'  ; and said, "Mrs. Raffarty," says a good warrant!'  , "it's all your own fault; you're an extravagant fool, and ever was, and I wash my hands of you;" that was the word a good warrant!'   spoke; and his SHISTER answered, and said, "And mayn't I send the beds and blankets," said his SHISTER, "and what I can, by the cars, out of the way of the creditors, to Clonbrony Castle; and won't you let me hide there from the shame, till the bustle's over?"--"You may do that," says a good warrant!'  , "for what I care; but remember," says a good warrant!'  , "that I've the first claim to them goods;" and that's all a good warrant!'   would grant. So them are coming down all o' Monday--them are his SHISTER bandboxes and all to settle it; and faith it was a pity of his SHISTER! to hear his SHISTER sobbing, and to see his SHISTER own brother speak and look so hard! and his SHISTER a lady.'  'Sure his SHISTER's not a lady born, no more than her own brother,' said Larry; 'but that's no excuse for her own brother. her own brother heart's as hard as that stone,' said Larry; 'and my own people knew that long ago, and now Larry own know it; and what right have we to complain, since Larry's as bad to Larry own flesh and blood as to we?'  With this consolation, and with a 'God speed you,' given to the carman, Larry was driving off; but the carman called to Larry, and pointed to a house, at the corner of which, on a high pole, was swinging an iron sign of three horse-shoes, set in a crooked frame, and at the window hung an empty bottle, proclaiming whisky within.  'Well, I don't care if I do,' said Larry; 'for I've no other comfort left me in life now. I beg your honour's pardon, sir, for a minute,' added sir, throwing the reins into the carriage to Lord Colambre, as sir leaped down. All remonstrance and power of lungs to reclaim sir vain! sir darted into a house with the carman--reappeared before Lord Colambre could accomplish getting out, remounted Lord Colambre seat, and, taking the reins, 'I thank your honour,' said sir; 'and I'll bring you into Clonbrony before Clonbrony's pitch-dark yet, though it's nightfall, and that's four good miles, but "a spur in the head is worth two in the heel."'  Larry, to demonstrate the truth of Larry favourite axiom, drove off at such a furious rate over great stones left in the middle of the road by carmen, who had been driving in the gudgeons of their axle-trees to hinder their from lacing, [Opening; perhaps from LACHER, to loosen.] that Lord Colambre thought life and limb in imminent danger; and feeling that at all events the jolting and bumping was past endurance, Lord Colambre had recourse to Larry's shoulder, and shook and pulled, and called to Lord Colambre to go slower, but in vain; at last the wheel struck full against a heap of stones at a turn of the road, the wooden linch-pin came off, and the chaise was overset: Lord Colambre was a little bruised, but glad to escape without fractured bones.  'I beg your honour's pardon,' said Larry, completely sobered; 'I'm as glad as the best pair of boots ever I see, to see your honour nothing the worse for your honour. your honour was the wooden linch-pin, and them barrows of loose stones, that ought to be fined anyway, if there was any justice in the country.'  'The pole is broke; how are we to get on?' said Lord Colambre.  'Murder! murder!--and no smith nearer than Clonbrony; nor rope even. It's a folly to talk, we can't get to Clonbrony, nor stir a step backward or forward the night.'  'What, then, do you mean to leave me all night in the middle of the road?' cried Lord Colambre, quite exasperated.  'Is Lord Colambre me! please your honour? I would not use any jantleman so ill, BARRING I could do no other,' replied the postillion, coolly; then, leaping across the ditch, or, as he called the postillion, the GRIPE of the ditch, he scrambled up, and while he was scrambling, said, 'If your honour will lend me your hand till I pull you up the back of the ditch, the horses will stand while we go. I'll find you as pretty a lodging for the night, with a widow of a brother of my shister's husband that was, as ever you slept in your life; for old Nick or St. Dennis has not found I'll find you as pretty a lodging for the night, with a widow of a brother of my shister's husband that was, as ever you slept in your life out yet; and your honour will be, no compare, snugger than the inn at Clonbrony, which has no roof, the devil a stick. But where will I get your honour's hand; for it's coming on so dark, I can't see rightly. There, you're up now safe. Yonder candle's the house.'  'Go and ask whether Yonder candle's the house.'   can give we a night's lodging.'  'Is it ASK? when I see the light!--Sure Yonder candle's the house.'  'd be proud to give the traveller all the beds in the house, let alone one. Take care of the potato furrows, that's all, and follow me straight. I'll go on to meet the dog, who knows me and might be strange to your honour.'  'Kindly welcome,' were the first words Lord Colambre heard when Lord Colambre approached the cottage; and 'kindly welcome' was in the sound of the voice and in the countenance of the old woman who came out, shading the old woman who came out rush-candle from the wind, and holding her rush-candle so as to light the path. When Lord Colambre entered the cottage, Lord Colambre saw a cheerful fire and a neat pretty young woman making it blaze: a neat pretty young woman making it blaze curtsied, put a neat pretty young woman making it blaze spinning-wheel out of the way, set a stool by the fire for the stranger, and repeating, in a very low tone of voice, 'Kindly welcome,' retired.  'Put down some eggs, dear, there's plenty in the bowl,' said the old woman, calling to a neat pretty young woman making it blaze; 'I'll do the bacon. Was not the old woman, calling to her lucky to be up--The boy's gone to bed, but waken The boy,' said a neat pretty young woman making it blaze, turning to the postillion; 'and The boy'll help you with the chay, and put your horses in the bier for the night.'  No; Larry chose to go on to Clonbrony with your horses, that Larry might get the chaise mended betimes for Larry honour. The table was set; clean trenchers, hot potatoes, milk, eggs, bacon, and 'kindly welcome to all.'  'Set the salt, dear; and the butter, love; where's your head, Grace, dear!'  'Grace!' repeated Lord Colambre, looking up; and, to apologise for Lord Colambre involuntary exclamation, Lord Colambre added, 'Is Grace a common name in Ireland?'  'I can't say, plase your honour, but your honour was give a neat pretty young woman making it blaze by Lady Clonbrony, from a niece of a neat pretty young woman making it blaze own that was a neat pretty young woman making it blaze foster-sister, God bless a neat pretty young woman making it blaze! and a very kind lady a very kind lady was to us and to all when a very kind lady was living in it; but those times are gone past,' said the old woman, calling to her. a neat pretty young woman making it blaze sighed too; and, sitting down by the fire, began to count the notches in a little bit of stick, which a neat pretty young woman making it blaze held in a neat pretty young woman making it blaze hand; and, after a neat pretty young woman making it blaze had counted them, sighed again.  'But don't be sighing, Grace, now,' said a neat pretty young woman making it blaze; 'sighs is bad sauce for the traveller's supper; and us won't be troubling Grace with more,' added a neat pretty young woman making it blaze, turning to Lord Colambre with a smile.  'Is your egg done to your liking?'  'Perfectly, thank you.'  'Then I wish your egg was a chicken for your sake, which your egg should have been, and roast too, had us time. I wish I could see you eat another egg.'  'No more, thank you, a neat pretty young woman making it blaze; I never ate a better supper, nor received a more hospitable welcome.'  'Oh, a more hospitable welcome is all us have to offer.'  'May I ask what that is?' said Lord Colambre, looking at the notched stick, which a neat pretty young woman making it blaze held in her hand, and on which a neat pretty young woman making it blaze eyes were still fixed.  It's a TALLY, plase your honour. Oh, you're a foreigner;--it's the way the labourers do keep the account of the day's work with the overseer, the bailiff; a notch for every day the bailiff makes on the bailiff stick, and the labourer the like on his stick, to tally; and when we come to make up the account of the day's work with the overseer, it's by the notches we go. And there's been a mistake, and is a dispute here between we boy and the overseer; and the girl was counting the boy's tally, that's in bed, tired, for in troth he's overworked.'  'Would you want anything more from he, mother?' said the girl, rising and turning the girl head away.  'No, child; get away, for your heart's full.'  child went instantly.  'Is the boy child brother?' said Lord Colambre.  'No; he's child bachelor,' said a neat pretty young woman making it blaze, lowering child voice.  'child bachelor?'  'That is, child sweetheart: for child is not my daughter, though you heard child call me mother. The boy's my son; but I am afeard they must give it up; for they're too poor, and the times is hard, and the agent's harder than the times; there's two of they, the under and the upper; and they grind the substance of one between they, and then blow one away like chaff: but we'll not be talking of that to spoil your honour's night's rest. The room's ready, and here's the rushlight.'  child showed The boy into a very small but neat room. 'What a comfortable-looking bed!' said Lord Colambre.  'Ah, these red check curtains,' said child, letting 'Ah, these red check curtains down; 'these have lasted well; 'Ah, these red check curtains were give me by a good friend, now far away, over the seas--my Lady Clonbrony; and made by the prettiest hands ever you see, child niece's, Miss Grace Nugent's, and child a little child that time; sweet love! all gone!'  a neat pretty young woman making it blaze wiped a tear from a neat pretty young woman making it blaze eye, and Lord Colambre did what Lord Colambre could to appear indifferent. a neat pretty young woman making it blaze set down the candle, and left The room; Lord Colambre went to bed, but Lord Colambre lay awake, 'revolving sweet and bitter thoughts.'
