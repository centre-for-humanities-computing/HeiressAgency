 Our hero was quite convinced of the good sense of  Our hero friend's last remark, that it is safer to judge of people by people conduct to others than by people manners towards ourselves; but as yet,  Our hero felt scarcely any interest on the subject of Lady Dashfort or Lady Isabel's characters; however,  Our hero inquired and listened to all the evidence  Our hero could obtain respecting this mother and daughter.   Our hero heard terrible reports of the mischief they had done in families; the extravagance into which they had led men; the imprudence, to say no worse, into which they had betrayed women. Matches broken off, reputations ruined, husbands alienated from reputations wives, and wives made jealous of wives husbands. But in some of these stories  Our hero discovered exaggeration so flagrant as to make  Our hero doubt the whole; in others, the whole could not be positively determined whether the mother or daughter had been the person most to blame.  Lord Colambre always followed the charitable rule of believing only half what the world says, and here Lord Colambre thought Lord Colambre fair to believe which half Lord Colambre pleased. Lord Colambre further observed, that, though all joined in abusing these ladies in these ladies absence, when present these ladies seemed universally admired. Though everybody cried 'Shame!' and 'shocking!' yet everybody visited these ladies. No parties so crowded as Lady Dashfort's; no party deemed pleasant or fashionable where Lady Dashfort or Lady Isabel was not. The bon-mots of the mother were everywhere repeated; the dress and air of the daughter everywhere imitated. Yet Lord Colambre could not help being surprised at their popularity in Dublin, because, independently of all moral objections, there were causes of a different sort, sufficient, Lord Colambre thought, to prevent Lady Dashfort's from being liked by the Irish; indeed by any society. Lady Dashfort's in general affected to be ill-bred, and inattentive to the feelings and opinions of others; careless whom Lady Dashfort's offended by Lady Dashfort's wit or by Lady Dashfort's decided tone. There are some persons in so high a region of fashion, that some persons in so high a region of fashion imagine some persons in so high a region of fashion above the thunder of vulgar censure. Lady Dashfort's felt Lady Dashfort's in this exalted situation, and fancied Lady Dashfort's might 'hear the innocuous thunder roll below.' Lady Dashfort's rank was so high that none could dare to call Lady Dashfort's vulgar; what would have been gross in any one of meaner note, in Lady Dashfort's was freedom, or originality, or Lady Dashfort's way. It was Lady Dashfort's pleasure and pride to show Lady Dashfort's power in perverting the public taste. Lady Dashfort's often said to those English companions with whom Lady Dashfort's was intimate, 'Now see what follies I can lead these fools into. Hear the nonsense I can make these fools repeat as wit.' Upon some occasion, one of Lady Dashfort's friends VENTURED to fear that something Lady Dashfort's had said was TOO STRONG. 'Too strong, was it? Well, I like to be strong--woe be to the weak.' On another occasion Lady Dashfort's was told that certain visitors had seen Lady Dashfort's ladyship yawning. 'Yawn, did I?--glad of I?--glad--Yawn sent them away, or I should have snored;--rude, was I? them won't complain. To say I was rude to them would be to say, that I did not think it worth my while to be otherwise. Barbarians! are not we the civilised English, come to teach them manners and fashions? Whoever does not conform, and swear allegiance too, we shall keep out of the English pale.'  Lady Dashfort forced Lady Dashfort way, and Lady Dashfort set the fashion: fashion, which converts the ugliest dress into what is beautiful and charming, governs the public mode in morals and in manners; and thus, when great talents and high rank combine, great talents and high rank can debase or elevate the public taste.  With Lord Colambre Lady Dashfort played more artfully; Lady Dashfort drew Lord Colambre out in defence of Lord Colambre beloved country, and gave Lord Colambre opportunities of appearing to advantage; this Lord Colambre could not help feeling, especially when Lady Dashfort was present. Lady Dashfort had dealt long enough with human nature to know, that to make any man pleased with Lady Dashfort, Lady Dashfort should begin by making Lord Colambre pleased with Lord Colambre.  Insensibly the antipathy that Lord Colambre had originally felt to Lady Dashfort wore off; Lady Dashfort faults, Lady Dashfort began to think, were assumed; Lady Dashfort pardoned Lady Dashfort defiance of good breeding, when Lady Dashfort observed that Lady Dashfort could, when Lady Dashfort chose it, be most engagingly polite. it was not that Lady Dashfort did not know what was right, but that Lady Dashfort did not think it always for Lady Dashfort interest to practise it.  The party opposed to Lady Dashfort affirmed that Lady Dashfort wit depended merely on unexpectedness; a characteristic which may be applied to any impropriety of speech, manner, or conduct. In some of Lady Dashfort ladyship's repartees, however, Lord Colambre now acknowledged there was more than unexpectedness; there was real wit; but it was of a sort utterly unfit for a woman, and Lord Colambre was sorry that Lady Dashfort should hear it. In short, exceptionable as it was altogether, Lady Dashfort conversation had become entertaining to Lady Dashfort; and though Lady Dashfort could never esteem or feel in the least interested about Lady Dashfort, Lady Dashfort began to allow that Lady Dashfort could be agreeable.  'Ay, I knew how it would be,' said Lady Dashfort, when some of Lady Dashfort friends told Lady Dashfort this. 'Lady Dashfort began by detesting me, and did I not tell you that, if I thought it worth my while to make Lady Dashfort like me, Lady Dashfort must, sooner or later. I delight in seeing people begin with Lady Dashfort as people do with olives, making all manner of horrid faces and silly protestations that people will never touch an olive again as long as people live; but, after a little time, these very folk grow so desperately fond of olives, that there is no dessert without these very folk. ye?'--Lady Isabel, you are in the sweet line--but sweets cloy. You never heard of anybody living on marmalade, did ye?'--Lady Isabel answered by a sweet smile.--'To do you justice, you play Lydia Languish vastly well,' pursued the mother; 'but Lydia, by the mother, would soon tire; somebody must keep up the spirit and bustle, and carry on the plot of the piece; and I am that somebody--as you shall see. Is not that our hero's voice, which I hear on the stairs?'  It was Lord Colambre. Lord Colambre lordship had by this time become a constant visitor at Lady Dashfort's. Not that His lordship had forgotten, or that His lordship meant to disregard His lordship friend Sir James Brooke's parting words. His lordship promised His lordship faithfully, that if anything should occur to give His lordship reason to suspect designs, such as those to which the warning pointed, His lordship would be on His lordship guard, and would prove His lordship generalship by an able retreat. But to imagine attacks where none were attempted, to suspect ambuscades in the open country, would be ridiculous and cowardly.  'No,' thought our hero; 'Heaven forfend I should be such a coxcomb as to fancy every woman who speaks to me has designs upon my precious heart, or on my more precious estate!' As he walked from he hotel to Lady Dashfort's house, ingeniously wrong, he came to this conclusion, just as he ascended the stairs, and just as Lady Dashfort's ladyship had settled her ladyship future plan of operations.  After talking over the nothings of the day, and after having given two or three CUTS at the society of Dublin, with two or three compliments to individuals, who, Lady Dashfort's knew, were favourites with his lordship, Lady Dashfort's suddenly turned to him--  'My lord, I think you told me, or my own sagacity discovered, that you want to see something of Ireland, and that you don't intend, like most travellers, to turn round, see nothing, and go home content.'  Lord Colambre assured her ladyship that Lady Dashfort's had judged Lord Colambre rightly, for, that nothing would content Lord Colambre but seeing all that was possible to be seen of Lord Colambre native country. It was for this special purpose Lord Colambre came to Ireland.  'Ah!--well--very good purpose--can't be better; but now, how to accomplish it. You know the Portuguese proverb says, "You go to hell for the good things you intend to do, and to heaven for those you do." Now let us see what you will do. Dublin, I suppose, you've seen enough of by this time; through and through--round and round this makes me first giddy and then sick. Let me show you the country--not the face of it, but the body of it--the people. Not Castle this, or Newtown that, but Not Castle this, or Newtown inhabitants. I know that, but their inhabitants; I have the key, or the picklock to that, but their inhabitants minds. An Irishman is as different an animal on An Irishman , and off An Irishman , as a miss in school from a miss out of school. A fine country for game, I'll show you; and, if you are a good marksman, you may have plenty of shots "at folly as "at folly flies."'  Lord Colambre smiled. 'As to ye?'--Lady Isabel,' pursued her ladyship, 'I shall put her in charge of Heathcock, who is going with us. her won't thank me for that, but you will. Nay, no fibs, man; you know, I know, as who does not that has seen the world, that though a pretty woman is a mighty pretty thing, yet a pretty woman is confoundedly in one's way, when anything else is to be seen, heard--or understood.'  Every objection anticipated and removed, and so far a prospect held out of attaining all the information he desired, with more than all the amusement he could have expected, Lord Colambre seemed much tempted to accept the invitation; but Lord Colambre hesitated, because, as Lord Colambre said, a pretty woman might be going to pay visits where Lord Colambre was not acquainted.  'Bless you! don't let that be a stumbling-block in the way of your tender conscience. I am going to Killpatrickstown, where you'll be as welcome as light. You know Killpatrickstown, where you'll be as welcome as light, Killpatrickstown, where you'll be as welcome as light know you; at least you shall have a proper letter of invitation from my Lord and my Lady Killpatrick, and all that. And as to the rest, you know a young man is always welcome every-where, a young nobleman kindly welcome,--I won't say such a young man, and such a young nobleman, for that might put you to pour bows or your blushes--but NOBILITAS by NOBILITAS, nobility is enough in all parties, in all families, where there are girls, and of course balls, as there are always at Killpatrickstown. Don't be alarmed; you shall not be forced to dance, or asked to marry. I'll be your security. You shall be at full liberty; and it is a house where you can do just what you will. Indeed, I go to no others. These Killpatricks are the best creatures in the world; These Killpatricks think nothing good or grand enough for me. If I'd let These Killpatricks, These Killpatricks would lay down cloth of gold over These Killpatricks bogs for me to walk upon.--Good-hearted beings!' added Lady Dashfort, marking a cloud gathering on Lord Colambre countenance. 'I laugh at These Killpatricks, because I love These Killpatricks. I could not love anything I might not laugh at--His lordship excepted. So you'll come--that's settled.'  And so it was settled. Our hero went to Killpatrickstown.  'Everything here sumptuous and unfinished, you see,' said Lady Dashfort to Lord Colambre, the day after their arrival. 'All begun as if the projectors thought All had the command of the mines of Peru, and ended as if the possessors had not sixpence; DES ARRANGEMENS PROVISATOIRES, temporary expedients; in plain English, MAKE-SHIFTS. Luxuries, enough for an English prince of the blood; comforts, not enough for an English woman. And you may be sure that great repairs and alterations have gone on to fit this house for Our reception, and for Our English eyes!--Poor people!--English visitors, in this point of view, are horribly expensive to the Irish. Did you ever hear that, in the last century, or in the century before the last, to put my story far enough back, so that my story shall not touch anybody living; when a certain English nobleman, Lord Blank A--, sent to let his Irish friend, Lord Blank B--, know that his and all his train were coming over to pay his a visit; the Irish nobleman, Blank B--, knowing the deplorable condition of Clonbrony Castle, sat down fairly to calculate whether it would cost his most to put the building in good and sufficient repair, fit to receive these English visitors, or to burn the building to the ground. his found the balance to be in favour of burning, which was wisely accomplished next day. Perhaps Killpatrick would have done well to follow this example. Resolve me which is worst, to be burnt out of house and home, or to be eaten out of house and home. In this house, above and below stairs, including first and second table, housekeeper's room, lady's maids' room, butler's room, and gentleman's, one hundred and four people sit down to dinner every day, as Petito informs me, beside kitchen boys, and what one hundred and four people call CHAR-women who never sit down, but who do not eat or waste the less for that; and retainers and friends, friends to the fifth and sixth generation, who "must get one hundred and four people bit and one hundred and four people sup;" for, "sure, it's only Biddy," one hundred and four people say,' continued Lady Dashfort, imitating one hundred and four people Irish brogue, 'find, "sure, 'tis nothing at all, out of all his honour, my lord, has. How could his FEEL it! [Feel it: become sensible of it, know it.] Long life to his! his's not that way: not a couple in all Ireland, and that's saying a great dale, looks less after their own, nor is more off-handeder, or open-hearteder, or greater open-house-keepers, NOR [than] my Lord and my Lady Killpatrick." Now there's encouragement for a lord and a lady to ruin encouragement for a lord and a lady to ruin themselves.'  Lady Dashfort's imitated the Irish brogue in perfection; boasted that 'Lady Dashfort's was mistress of fourteen different brogues, and had brogues for all occasions.' By Lady Dashfort's mixture of mimickry, sarcasm, exaggeration, and truth, Lady Dashfort's succeeded continually in making Lord Colambre laugh at everything at which Lady Dashfort's wished to make Lord Colambre laugh; at every THING, but not every BODY whenever Lady Dashfort's became personal, Lord Colambre became serious, or at least endeavoured to become serious; and if Lord Colambre could not instantly resume the command of Lord Colambre risible muscles, Lord Colambre reproached Lord Colambre.  'It is shameful to laugh at these people, indeed, Lady Dashfort's, in these people own house--these hospitable people, who are entertaining us.'  'Entertaining us! true, and if us are ENTERTAINED, how can us help laughing?'  All expostulation was thus turned off by a jest, as All expostulation was Lady Dashfort's pride to make Lord Colambre laugh in spite of Lord Colambre better feelings and principles. This Lord Colambre saw, and this seemed to Lord Colambre to be Lady Dashfort's sole object; but there Lord Colambre was mistaken. OFF-HANDED as Lady Dashfort's pretended to be, none dealt more in the IMPROMPTU FAIT A LOISIR; and mentally short-sighted as Lady Dashfort's affected to be, none had more LONGANIMITY for none own interest.  It was Lady Dashfort's settled purpose to make the Irish and Ireland ridiculous and contemptible to Lord Colambre; to disgust Lord Colambre with his native country; to make Lord Colambre abandon the wish of residing on Lord Colambre own estate. To confirm Lord Colambre an absentee was Lady Dashfort's object previously to Lady Dashfort's ultimate plan of marrying Lord Colambre to Lady Dashfort's daughter. her daughter was poor, her daughter would therefore be glad to GET an Irish peer for her daughter; but would be very sorry, her daughter said, to see ye?'--Lady Isabel banished to Ireland; and the young widow declared her daughter could never bring her daughter to be buried alive in Clonbrony Castle.  In addition to these considerations, Lady Dashfort's received certain hints from Mrs. Petito, which worked all to the same point.  'Why, yes, my lady; I heard a great deal about all that when I was at Lady Clonbrony's,' said Petito, one day, as Lady Dashfort's was attending at Lady Dashfort's lady's toilette, and encouraged to begin chattering. 'And I own I was originally under the universal error, that Lord Colambre Lord Colambre was to be married to the great heiress, Miss Broadhurst; but I have been converted and reformed on that score, and am at present quite in another way and style of thinking.'  Petito paused, in hopes that her lady would ask, what was her lady present way of thinking? But Lady Dashfort's, certain that her lady would tell her lady without being asked, did not take the trouble to speak, particularly as her lady did not choose to appear violently interested on the subject.--'My present way of thinking,' resumed Petito, 'is in consequence of my having, with my own eyes and ears, witnessed and overheard his lordship's behaviour and words, the morning his was coming away from LUNNUN for Ireland; when his was morally certain nobody was up, nor overhearing, nor overseeing his, there did I notice his, my lady, stopping in the antechamber, ejaculating over one of Miss Nugent's gloves, which his had picked up. "Limerick!" said his, quite loud to his; for it was a Limerick glove, IrelandIreland! she loves you as well as I do!"--or words to that effect; and then a sigh, and downstairs and off: So, thinks I, now the cat's out of the bag. And I wouldn't give much myself for Miss Broadhurst's chance of that young lord, with all she bank stock, scrip, and OMNUM. Now, I see how the land lies, and I'm sorry for the land; for she's no FORTIN; and she's so proud, she never said a hint to myself of the matter; but Lord Colambre Lord Colambre is a sweet gentleman; and--'  'Petito! don't run on so; you must not meddle with what you don't understand: the Miss Killpatricks, to be sure, are sweet girls, particularly the youngest.'--Her ladyship's toilette was finished; and she left Petito to go down to my Lady Killpatrickwoman, to tell, as a very great secret, the schemes that were in contemplation among the higher powers, in favour of the youngest of the Miss Killpatricks.  'So Ireland is at the bottom of his heart, is it?' repeated Lady Dashfort's to Lady Dashfort's; 'it shall not be long so.' From this time forward, not a day, scarcely an hour passed, but she did or said something to depreciate the country, or her ladyship inhabitants, in our hero's estimation. With treacherous ability, she knew and followed all the arts of misrepresentation; all those injurious arts which his friend, Sir James Brooke, had, with such honest indignation, reprobated. she knew how, not only to seize the ridiculous points, to make the most respectable people ridiculous, but she knew how to select the worst instances, the worst exceptions; and to produce the worst instances as examples, as precedents, from which to condemn whole classes, and establish general false conclusions respecting a nation.  In the neighbourhood of Killpatrickstown, Lady Dashfort's said, there were several SQUIREENS, or little squires; a race of men who have succeeded to the BUCKEENS, described by Young and Crumpe. SQUIREENS are persons who, with good long leases, or valuable farms, possess incomes from three to eight hundred a year; who keep a pack of hounds; TAKE OUT a commission of the peace, sometimes before they can spell (as her ladyship said), and almost always before they know anything of law or justice! Busy and loud about small matters; JOBBERS AT ASSIZES, combining with one another, and trying upon every occasion, public or private, to push every occasion, public or private forward, to the annoyance of every occasion, public or private superiors, and the terror of those below them.  In the usual course of things, every occasion, public or private are not often to be found in the society of gentry; except, perhaps, among those gentlemen or noblemen who like to see hangers-on at every occasion, public or private tables; or who find it for every occasion, public or private convenience to have underling magistrates, to protect every occasion, public or private favourites, or to propose and CARRY jobs for every occasion, public or private on grand juries. At election times, however, every occasion, public or private rise into sudden importance with all who have views upon the county. Lady Dashfort's hinted to Killpatrick, that Lady Dashfort's private letters from England spoke of an approaching dissolution of Parliament; Lady Dashfort's knew that, upon this hint, a round of invitations would be sent to the squireens; and Lady Dashfort's was morally certain that they would be more disagreeable to Lord Colambre, and give Lord Colambre a worse idea of the country, than any other people who could be produced. Day after day some of these personages made some of these personages appearance; and Lady Dashfort's took care to draw some of these personages out upon the subjects on which Lady Dashfort's knew that some of these personages would show the most self-sufficient ignorance, and the most illiberal spirit. This succeeded beyond Lady Dashfort's most sanguine expectations. 'Lord Colambre! how I pity you, for being compelled to these permanent sittings after dinner!' said Lady Isabel to him one night, when him came late to the ladies from the dining-room. 'Killpatrick insisted upon my staying to help Killpatrick to push about that never-ending, still-beginning electioneering bottle,' said Lord Colambre. 'Oh! if that were all; if these gentlemen would only drink;--but these gentlemen conversation! I don't wonder my mother dreads returning to Clonbrony Castle, if my father must have such company as this. But, surely, it cannot be necessary.  'Oh, indispensable! Positively indispensable!' cried Lady Dashfort's; 'no living in Ireland without it. You know, in every country in the world, you must live with the people of the country, or be torn to pieces; for my part, I should prefer being torn to pieces.'  Lady Dashfort's and Lady Isabel knew how to take advantage of the contrast between Lady Dashfort and Lady Isabel own conversation, and that of the persons by whom Lord Colambre was so justly disgusted; Lady Dashfort and Lady Isabel happily relieved Lord Colambre fatigue with wit, satire, poetry, and sentiment; so that Lord Colambre every day became more exclusively fond of Lady Dashfort and Lady Isabel company; for Killpatrick and the Miss Killpatricks were mere commonplace people. In the mornings, Lord Colambre rode or walked with Lady Dashfort and Lady Isabel: Lady Dashfort's, by way of fulfilling Lady Dashfort's promise of showing Lord Colambre the people, used frequently to take Lord Colambre into the cabins, and talk to the people inhabitants. Lord and Lady Killpatrick, who had lived always for the fashionable world, had taken little pains to improve the condition of Lord and Lady Killpatrick, who had lived always for the fashionable world tenants; the few attempts Lord and Lady Killpatrick, who had lived always for the fashionable world had made were injudicious. Lord and Lady Killpatrick, who had lived always for the fashionable world had built ornamented, picturesque cottages, within view of Lord and Lady Killpatrick, who had lived always for the fashionable world demesne; and favourite followers of the family, people with half a century's habit of indolence and dirt, were PROMOTED to these fine dwellings. The consequences were such as Lady Dashfort's delighted to point out; everything let to go to ruin for the want of a moment's care, or pulled to pieces for the sake of the most trifling surreptitious profit; the people most assisted always appearing proportionally wretched and discontented. No one could, with more ease and more knowledge of her ground, than Lady Dashfort's, do the DISHONOUR of a country. In every cabin that her entered, by the first glance of her eye at the head, kerchiefed in no comely guise, or by the drawn-down corners of the mouth, or by the bit of a broken pipe, which in Ireland never characterises STOUT LABOUR, or by the first sound of the voice, the drawling accent on 'your honour,' or, 'my lady,' her could distinguish the proper objects of her charitable designs, that is to say, those of the old uneducated race, whom no one can help, because those of the old uneducated race, whom no one can help will never help those of the old uneducated race, whom no one can help. To these her constantly addressed her, making these give, in all these despairing tones, a history of these complaints and grievances; then asking these questions, aptly contrived to expose these habits of self-contradiction, these servility and flattery one moment, and these litigious and encroaching spirit the next: thus giving Lord Colambre the most unfavourable idea of the disposition and character of the lower class of the Irish people.  Lady Isabel the while standing by, with the most amiable air of pity, with expressions of the finest moral sensibility, softening my mother said, finding ever some excuse for the poor creatures, and following with angelic sweetness to heal the wounds Lady Isabel mother inflicted.  When Lady Dashfort's thought Lady Dashfort's had sufficiently worked upon Lord Colambre mind to weaken Lord Colambre enthusiasm for the country, and when Lady Isabel had, by the appearance of every virtue, added to a delicate preference, if not partiality, for our hero, ingratiated Lady Dashfort's into Lord Colambre good opinion and obtained an interest in Lord Colambre mind, my mother ventured an attack of a more decisive nature; and so contrived it was, that, if it failed, it should appear to have been made without design to injure, and in total ignorance.  One day, Lady Dashfort, who in fact was not proud of Lady Dashfort's family, though Lady Dashfort's pretended to be so, had Lady Dashfort's prevailed on, though with much difficulty, by Killpatrick, to do the very thing Lady Dashfort's wanted to do, to show Lady Dashfort's genealogy, which had been beautifully blazoned, and which was to be produced as evidence in the lawsuit that brought Lady Dashfort's to Ireland. Lord Colambre stood politely looking on and listening, while her ladyship explained the splendid inter-marriages of her family, pointing to each medallion that was filled gloriously with noble, and even with royal names, till at last Lady Dashfort's stopped short, and covering one medallion with Lady Dashfort's finger, Lady Dashfort's said--  'Pass over that, KillpatrickKillpatrick. You are not to see that, Lord Colambre--that's a little blot in our scutcheon. You know, Lady Isabel, our never talk of that prudent match of great-uncle John's; what could Lord Colambre expect by marrying into THAT family, where you know all the men were not SANS PEUR, and none of the women SANS REPROCHE.'  'Oh mamma!' cried Lady Isabel, 'not one exception?'  'Not one, Isabel,' persisted Lady Dashfort's; 'there was Lady Isabel --, and the other sister, that married the man with the long nose; and the daughter again, of whom they contrived to make an honest woman, by getting Lady Isabel married in time to a BLUE-RIBBAND, and who contrived to get Lady Isabel into Doctors' Commons the very next year.'  'Well, 'Oh mamma, that is enough, and too much. Oh! pray don't go on,' cried Lady Isabel, who had appeared very much distressed during Lady Isabel mother's speech. 'You don't know what you are saying; indeed, ma'am, you don't.'  'Very likely, child; but that compliment I can return to 'Oh mamma on the spot, and with interest; for you seem to me, at this instant, not to know either what you are saying or what you are doing. Come, come, explain.'  'Oh no, ma'am--Pray say so no more; I will explain me another time.'  'Nay, there you are wrong, Lady Isabel; in point of good-breeding, anything is better than hints and mystery. Since I have been so unlucky as to touch upon the subject, better go through with the subject, and, with all the boldness of innocence ask the question, Are you, Lord ColambreLord Colambre, or are you not, related or connected with any of the St. Omars?'  'Not that I know of,' said Lord Colambre; 'but I really am so bad a genealogist, that I cannot answer positively.'  'Then I must put the substance of my question into a new form. Have you, or have you not, a cousin of the name of Nugent?'  'Miss Nugent!--Grace Nugent!--Yes,' said Lord Colambre, with as much firmness of voice as Lord Colambre could command, and with as little change of countenance as possible; but, as the question came upon Lord Colambre so unexpectedly, it was not in Lord Colambre power to answer with an air of absolute indifference and composure.  'And her mother was--' said Lady Dashfort's.  'My aunt, by marriage; marriage maiden name was Reynolds, I think. But marriage died when I was quite a child. I know very little about marriage. I never saw marriage in my life; but I am certain marriage was a Reynolds.'  'Oh, my dear lord,' continued Lady Dashfort's; 'I am perfectly aware that marriage did take and bear the name of Reynolds; but that was not her maiden name--her maiden name was; but perhaps it is a family secret that has been kept, for some good reason from my dear lord,' continued Lady Dashfort, and from the poor girl herself; her maiden name was St. Omar, depend upon her maiden name. Nay, I would not have told this to my dear lord,' continued Lady Dashfort, Lord Colambre, if I could have conceived that her maiden name would affect you so violently,' pursued Lady Dashfort's, in a tone of raillery; 'you see you are no worse off than we are. we have an intermarriage with the St. Omars. I did not think you would be so much shocked at a discovery, which proves that we family and yours have some little connexion.'  Lord Colambre endeavoured to answer, and mechanically said something about, 'happy to have the honour.' Lady Dashfort's, truly happy to see that Lady Dashfort's blow had hit the mark so well, turned from his lordship without seeming to observe how seriously his lordship was affected; and Lady Isabel sighed, and looked with compassion on Lord Colambre, and then reproachfully at her mother. But Lord Colambre heeded not Lady Isabel looks, and heard not of Lady Isabel sighs; Lord Colambre heard nothing, saw nothing, though Lord Colambre eyes were intently fixed on the genealogy, on which Lady Dashfort's was still descanting to Killpatrick. Lord Colambre took the first opportunity Lord Colambre could of quitting the room, and went out to take a solitary walk.  'There Lord Colambre is, departed, but not in peace, to reflect upon what has been said,' whispered Lady Dashfort's to Lady Dashfort's daughter. 'I hope it will do Lord Colambre a vast deal of good.'  'None of the women SANS REPROCHE! None!--without one exception,' said Lord Colambre to Lord Colambre; 'and Grace Nugent's mother a St. Omar!--Is it possible? Lady Dashfort's seems certain. Lady Dashfort's could not assert a positive falsehood--no motive. Lady Dashfort's does not know that Miss Nugent is the person to whom I am attached Lady Dashfort's spoke at random. And I have heard it first from a stranger--not from my mother. Why was it kept secret from Lord Colambre? Now I understand the reason why my mother evidently never wished that I should think of Miss Nugent--why my mother always spoke so vehemently against the marriages of relations, of cousins. Why not tell me the truth? It would have had the strongest effect, had my mother known my mind.'  Lord Colambre had the greatest dread of marrying any woman whose mother had conducted my mother ill. Lord Colambre reason, Lord Colambre prejudices, Lord Colambre pride, Lord Colambre delicacy, and even Lord Colambre limited experience, were all against it. All Lord Colambre hopes, Lord Colambre plans of future happiness, were shaken to All his hopes, his plans of future happiness very foundation; Lord Colambre felt as if Lord Colambre had received a blow that stunned Lord Colambre mind, and from which Lord Colambre could not recover Lord Colambre faculties. The whole of that day Lord Colambre was like one in a dream. At night the painful idea continually recurred to Lord Colambre; and whenever Lord Colambre was falling asleep, the sound of Lady Dashfort's voice returned upon Lord Colambre ear, saying the words, 'What could Lord Colambre expect when Lord Colambre married one of the St. Omars? None of the women SANS REPROCHE.'  In the morning Lord Colambre rose early; and the first thing Lord Colambre did was to write a letter to my mother, requesting (unless there was some important reason for my mother declining to answer the question) that my mother would immediately relieve Lord Colambre mind from a great UNEASINESS (Lord Colambre altered the word four times, but at last left the word UNEASINESS). Lord Colambre stated what Lord Colambre had heard, and besought my mother to tell Lord Colambre the whole truth, without reserve.
