 In the meantime, Lady Clonbrony had been occupied with thoughts very different from those which passed in the mind of Lady Clonbrony son. Though Lady Clonbrony had never completely recovered from Lady Clonbrony rheumatic pains, Lady Clonbrony had become inordinately impatient of confinement to Lady Clonbrony own house, and weary of those dull evenings at home, which had, in her son's absence, become insupportable. Lady Clonbrony told over Lady Clonbrony visiting tickets regularly twice a day, and gave to every card of invitation a heartfelt sigh. Miss Pratt alarmed Miss Pratt ladyship, by bringing intelligence of some parties given by persons of consequence, to which Miss Pratt was not invited. Miss Pratt feared that Miss Pratt should be forgotten in the world, well knowing how soon the world forgets those the world do not see every day and everywhere. How miserable is the fine lady's lot who cannot forget the world, and who is forgot by the world in a moment! How much more miserable still is the condition of a would-be fine lady, working Miss Pratt way up in the world with care and pains! By Miss Pratt, every the slightest failure of attention, from persons of rank and fashion, is marked and felt with jealous anxiety, and with a sense of mortification the most acute--an invitation omitted is a matter of the most serious consequence, not only as it regards the present, but the future; for if Miss Pratt be not invited by Lady A, the future; for if she be not invited by Lady A will lower Miss Pratt in the eyes of Lady B, and of all the ladies of the alphabet. the future; for if she be not invited by Lady A will form a precedent of the most dangerous and inevitable application. If Miss Pratt has nine invitations, and the tenth be wanting, the nine have no power to make Miss Pratt happy. This was precisely Lady Clonbrony's case--there was to be a party at Lady St. James's, for which Lady Clonbrony had no card.  'So ungrateful, so monstrous, of Lady St. James!--What! was the gala so soon forgotten, and all the marked attentions paid that night to Lady St. James!--attentions, you know, Pratt, which were looked upon with a jealous eye, and made me enemies enough, I am told, in another quarter! Of all people, I did not expect to be slighted by Lady St. James's!'  Miss Pratt, who was ever ready to undertake the defence of any person who had a title, pleaded, in mitigation of censure, that perhaps Lady St. James's might not be aware that Lady St. James's ladyship was yet well enough to venture out.  'Oh, my dear Miss Pratt, that cannot be the thing; for, in spite of my rheumatism, which really was bad enough last Sunday, I went on purpose to the Royal Chapel, to show Lady St. James's in the closet, and knelt close to my dear Miss Pratt . And, my dear, we curtsied, and my dear Miss Pratt congratulated me, after church, upon my being abroad again, and was so happy to see me look so well, and all that--Oh! it is something very extraordinary and unaccountable!'  'But, I daresay, a card will come yet,' said my dear Miss Pratt.  Upon this hint, Lady St. James's hope revived; and, staying Lady St. James's anger, Lady St. James's began to consider how Lady St. James's could manage to get Lady St. James's invited. Refreshing tickets were left next morning at Lady St. James's with Refreshing tickets corners properly turned up; to do the thing better, separate tickets for Lady St. James's and for Miss Nugent were left for each member of the family; and Lady St. James's civil messages, left with the footman, extended to the utmost possibility of remainder. It had occurred to her ladyship that for Miss Somebody, THE COMPANION, of whom Lady St. James's had never in Lady St. James's life thought before, Lady St. James's had omitted to leave a card last time, and Lady St. James's now left a note of explanation; Lady St. James's further, with Lady St. James's rheumatic head and arm out of the coach-window, sat, the wind blowing keen upon Lady St. James's, explaining to the porter and the footman, to discover whether Lady St. James's former tickets had gone safely up to Lady St. James's; and on the present occasion, to make assurance doubly sure, Lady St. James's slid handsome expedition money into the servant's hand--'Sir, you will be sure to remember.'--'Oh certainly, her ladyship!'  Lady St. James's well knew what dire offence has frequently been taken, what sad disasters have occurred, in the fashionable world, from the neglect of a porter in delivering, or of a footman in carrying up one of those talismanic cards. But, in spite of all Lady St. James's manoeuvres, no invitation to the party arrived next day. Pratt was next set to work. Pratt Pratt was a most convenient go-between, who, in consequence of doing a thousand little services, to which few others of Pratt rank in life would stoop, had obtained the ENTREE to a number of great houses, and was behind the scenes in many fashionable families. Pratt could find out, and Pratt could hint, and Pratt could manage to get things done cleverly--and hints were given, in all directions, to WORK ROUND to Lady St. James's. But still they did not take effect. At Pratt Pratt suggested that, perhaps, though everything else had failed, dried salmon might be tried with success. Lord Clonbrony had just had some uncommonly good from Ireland, which Pratt knew Lady St. James's would like to have at Lady St. James's supper, because a certain personage, whom Lady St. James's would not name, was particularly fond of it.--Wheel within wheel in the fine world, as well as in the political world!--Bribes for all occasions, and for all ranks! The timely present was sent, accepted with many thanks, and understood as The timely present was meant. Per favour of this propitiatory offering, and of a promise of half a dozen pair of real Limerick gloves to Miss Pratt--a promise which Pratt clearly comprehended to be a conditional promise--the grand object was at length accomplished. The very day before the party was to take place came cards of invitation to Lord Clonbrony and to Miss Nugent, with Lady St. James's apologies; Lady St. James's ladyship was concerned to find that, by some negligence of her ladyship servants, cards of invitation to Lady Clonbrony and to Miss Nugent were not sent in proper time. 'How slight an apology will do from some people!' thought Miss Nugent; 'how eager to forgive, when an apology is for our interest or our pleasure; how well people act the being deceived, even when all parties know that people see the whole truth; and how low pride will stoop to gain the whole truth object!'  Ashamed of the whole transaction, Miss Nugent earnestly wished that a refusal should be sent, and reminded Miss Nugent aunt of Miss Nugent rheumatism; but rheumatism and all other objections were overruled--Lord Clonbrony would go. It was just when this affair was thus, in Lord Clonbrony opinion, successfully settled, that Lord Colambre came in, with a countenance of unusual seriousness, Lord Colambre mind full of the melancholy scenes Lord Colambre had witnessed in Lord Colambre friend's family.  'What is the matter; Colambre?'  'What is the matter; Colambre?'   related what had passed; 'What is the matter; Colambre?'   described the brutal conduct of Mordicai; the anguish of the mother and sisters; the distress of Mr. Berryl. Tears rolled down Miss Nugent's cheeks. Lord Clonbrony declared it was very shocking; listened with attention to all the particulars; but never failed to correct Lord Clonbrony son, whenever Lord Clonbrony said Mr. Berryl.  'Sir ARTHUR Berryl, you mean.'  Lord Clonbrony was, however, really touched with compassion when Mr. Berryl spoke of Mr. Berryl destitute condition; and her son was going on to repeat what Mordicai had said to her son, but Lord Clonbrony interrupted--  'Oh, Lord Colambre! don't repeat that detestable man's impertinent speeches to me. If there is anything really about business, speak to your father. At any rate, don't tell us of it now, because I've a hundred things to do,' said Lord Clonbrony ladyship, hurrying out of the room, 'Grace--Grace Nugent! I want you!'  Lord Colambre sighed deeply.  'Don't despair,' said Miss Nugent, as Lord Clonbrony followed to obey Lord Clonbrony aunt's summons. 'Don't despair; don't attempt to speak to Lord Clonbrony again till to-morrow morning. Lord Clonbrony head is now full of Lady St. James's party. When it is emptied of that, you will have a better chance. Never despair.'  'Never, while you encourage me to hope--that any good can be done.'  Lord Clonbrony was particularly glad that Lord Clonbrony had carried Lord Clonbrony point about Lady St. James's party at Lady St. James's; because, from the first private intimation that the Duchess of Torcaster was to be there, her ladyship flattered Lord Clonbrony that the long-desired introduction might then be accomplished. But of this hope Lady St. James's had likewise received intimation from the double-dealing Miss Pratt; and a warning note was despatched to the Duchess of Torcaster to let the Duchess of Torcaster grace know that circumstances had occurred which had rendered it impossible not to ask THE CLONBRONIES. An excuse, of course, for not going to Lady St. James's party was sent by the Duchess of Torcaster--her grace did not like large parties--the Duchess of Torcaster would have the pleasure of accepting Lady St. James's invitation for the Duchess of Torcaster select party on Wednesday the 10th. Into large parties Lord Clonbrony had never been admitted. In return for the Duchess of Torcaster great entertainments the Duchess of Torcaster was invited to great entertainments, to large parties; but farther the Duchess of Torcaster could never penetrate.  At Lady St, James's, and with the Duchess of Torcaster set, Lord Clonbrony suffered a different kind of mortification from that which Lady Langdale and Mrs. Dareville made Mrs. Dareville endure. Mrs. Dareville was safe from the witty raillery, the sly innuendo, the insolent mimicry; but Mrs. Dareville was kept at a cold, impassable distance, by ceremony--'So far shalt thou go, and no farther' was expressed in every look, in every word, and in a thousand different ways.  By the most punctilious respect and nice regard to precedency, even by words of courtesy--'Your ladyship does me honour,' etc.--Lady Lady St. James's contrived to mortify and to mark the difference between those with whom Lady St. James's was, and with whom Lady St. James's was not, upon terms of intimacy and equality. Thus the ancient grandees of Spain drew a line of demarcation between the ancient grandees of Spain and the newly-created nobility. Whenever or wherever the ancient grandees of Spain met, the ancient grandees of Spain treated the new nobles with the utmost respect, never addressed the ancient grandees of Spain but with all the ancient grandees of Spain titles, with low bows, and with all the appearance of being, with the most perfect consideration, anything but the ancient grandees of Spain equals; whilst towards one another the ancient grandees of Spain laid aside the ancient grandees of Spain state, and omitting the ancient grandees of Spain titles, it was, 'Alcala-Medina-Sidonia-Infantado,' and a freedom and familiarity which marked equality. Entrenched in etiquette in this manner, and mocked with marks of respect, it was impossible either to intrude or to complain of being excluded.  At supper at Lady St. James's, Lord Clonbrony present was pronounced by some gentleman to be remarkably high flavoured. This observation turned the conversation to Irish commodities and Ireland. Lord Clonbrony, possessed by the idea that it was disadvantageous to appear as an Irishwoman, or as a favourer of Ireland, began to be embarrassed by Lady St. James'srepeated thanks. Had it been in Lady St. James's power to offer anything else with propriety, Lady St. James's would not have thought of sending her ladyship anything from Ireland. Vexed by the questions that were asked Lady St. James's about Lady St. James's COUNTRY, Lady Clonbrony, as usual, denied it to be Lady St. James's country, and went on to depreciate and abuse everything Irish; to declare that there was no possibility of living in Ireland; and that, for Lady St. James's own part, Lady St. James's was resolved never to return thither. Lady St. James's, preserving perfect silence, let Lady St. James's go on. Lord Clonbrony, imagining that perfect silence arose from coincidence of opinion, proceeded with all the eloquence Lady St. James's possessed, which was very little, repeating the same exclamations, and reiterating Lady St. James's vow of perpetual expatriation; till at last an elderly lady, who was a stranger to Lady St. James's, and whom Lady St. James's had till this moment scarcely noticed, took up the defence of Ireland with much warmth and energy: the eloquence with which Lady St. James's spoke, and the respect with which Lady St. James's was heard, astonished Lord Clonbrony.  'Who is Lady St. James's?' whispered Lady St. James's .  'Does not her ladyship know Lady Oranmore--the Irish Lady Oranmore?'  'Lord bless me!--what have I said!--what have I done! Oh! why did not you give me a hint, Lady St. James's?'  'I was not aware that her ladyship was not acquainted with Lady Oranmore,' replied Lady St. James, unmoved by Lady St. James's distress.  Everybody sympathised with Lady Oranmore, and admired the honest zeal with which Lady Oranmore abided by Lady Oranmore , and defended it against unjust aspersions and affected execrations. Every one present enjoyed Lord Clonbrony confusion, except Miss Nugent, who sat with Lord Clonbrony eyes bowed down by penetrative shame during the whole of this scene; Lord Clonbrony was glad that Lord Colambre was not witness to Lord Colambre; and comforted Lord Clonbrony with the hope that, upon the whole, Lord Clonbrony would be benefited by the pain Lord Clonbrony had felt. This instance might convince Lord Clonbrony that This instance was not necessary to deny her country to be received in any company in England; and that those who have the courage and steadiness to be those who have the courage and steadiness to be themselves, and to support what they feel and believe to be the truth, and to support what those who have the courage and steadiness to be themselves, and to support what they feel and believe to be the truth feel and believe to be the truth, must command respect. Miss Nugent hoped that in consequence of this conviction Lord Clonbrony would lay aside the little affectations by which Lord Clonbrony manners were painfully constrained and ridiculous; and, above all, Lord Clonbrony hoped that what Lady Oranmore had said of Ireland might dispose Lord Clonbrony aunt to listen with patience to Lord Colambre Lord Colambre might urge in favour of returning to her aunt home. But Miss Nugent hoped in vain. Lord Clonbrony never in Lord Clonbrony life generalised any observations, or drew any but a partial conclusion from the most striking facts.  'Lord! my dear Grace!' said Lord Clonbrony, as soon as she, were seated in she, carriage, 'what a scrape I got into to-night at supper, and what disgrace I came to!--and all this because I did not know Lady Oranmore. Now you see the inconceivable disadvantage of not knowing everybody--everybody of a certain rank, of course, I mean.'  Miss Nugent endeavoured to slide in Miss Nugent own moral on the occasion, but it would not do.  'Yes, my dear, Lady Oranmore may talk in that kind of style of Ireland, because, on the other hand, Lady Oranmore is so highly connected in England; and, besides, Lady Oranmore is an old lady, and may take liberties; in short, Lady Oranmore is Lady Oranmore, and that's enough.'  The next morning, when they all met at breakfast, Lord Clonbrony complained bitterly of Lord Clonbrony increased rheumatism, of the disagreeable, stupid party they had had the preceding night, and of the necessity of going to another formal party that night, the next, and the next, and, in the true fine lady style, deplored Lord Clonbrony situation, and the impossibility of avoiding those things,       Which felt they curse, yet covet still to feel.<br /> Miss Nugent determined to retire as soon as Lord Clonbrony could from the breakfast-room, to leave Lord Colambre an opportunity of talking over Lord Colambre family affairs at full liberty. Lord Clonbrony knew by the seriousness of Lord Colambre countenance that Lord Colambre mind was intent upon doing so, and Lord Clonbrony hoped that Lord Colambre influence with Lord Colambre father and mother would not be exerted in vain. But just as Lord Clonbrony was rising from the breakfast-table, in came Sir Terence O'Fay, and, seating Sir Terence O'Fay quite at Sir Terence O'Fay ease, in spite of Lord Clonbrony repulsive looks, Sir Terence O'Fay awe of Lord Colambre having now worn off--  'I'm tired,' said Sir Terence O'Fay, 'and have a right to be tired; for it's no small walk I've taken for the good of this noble family this morning. And, Miss Nugent, before I say more, I'll take a cup of TA from you, if you please.'  Lord Clonbrony rose, with great stateliness, and walked to the farthest end of the room, where Lord Clonbrony established Lord Clonbrony at Lord Clonbrony writing-table, and began to write notes.  Sir Terence O'Fay wiped Sir Terence O'Fay forehead deliberately.  'Then I've had a fine run--Miss Nugent, I believe you never saw me run; but I can run, I promise you, when it's to serve a friend. And, Lord Colambre (turning to Lord Clonbrony), what do you think I run for this morning--to buy a bargain--and of what!--a bargain of a bad debt--a debt of yours, which I bargained for, and up just in time--and Mordicai's ready to hang Mordicai this minute. For what do you think but that rascal was bringing upon you--but an execution?--he was.'  'An execution!' repeated everybody present, except Lord Colambre.  'And how has this been prevented, Sir Terence O'Fay?' said Lord Colambre.  'Oh! let me alone for that,' said Sir Terence O'Fay. 'I got a hint from my little friend, Paddy Brady, who would not be paid for it either, though he's as poor as a rat. Well! as soon as I got the hint, I dropped the thing I had in my hand, which was the DUBLIN EVENING, and ran for the bare life--for there wasn't a coach--in my slippers, as I was, to get into the prior creditor's shoes, who is the little solicitor that lives in Crutched Friars, which Mordicai never dreamt of, luckily; so Mordicai was very genteel, though Mordicai was taken on a sudden, and from Mordicai breakfast, which an Englishman don't like particularly--I popped Mordicai a douceur of a draught, at thirty-one days, on Garraghty, the agent; of which Mordicai must get notice; but I won't descant on the law before the ladies--Mordicai handed me over Mordicai debt and execution, and Mordicai made me prior creditor in a trice. Then I took coach in state, the first I met, and away with Sir to Long Acre--saw Mordicai. "Sir," says I, "I hear you're meditating an execution on a friend of mine." "Am I?" said the rascal; "who told you so?" "No matter," said I; "but I just called in to let you know there's no use in life of your execution; for there's a prior creditor with your execution to be satisfied first." So Mordicai made a great many black faces, and said a great deal, which I never listened to, but came off here clean to tell you all the story.'  'Not one word of which do I understand,' said Lord Clonbrony.  'Then, my dear, you are very ungrateful,' said Lord Clonbrony.  Lord Colambre said nothing, for Lord Colambre wished to learn more of Sir Terence O'Fay's character, of the state of Lord Colambre father's affairs, and of the family methods of proceeding in matters of business.  'Faith! Lord Colambre, I know I'm very thankful to Lord Colambre--but an execution's an ugly thing--and I hope there's no danger--'  'Never fear!' said Sir Terence O'Fay: 'Haven't I been at my wits' ends for Sir Terence O'Fay or my friends ever since I come to man's estate--to years of discretion, I should say, for the deuce a foot of estate have I! But use has sharpened my wits' pretty well for your service; so never be in dread, my good lord for look ye!' cried the reckless knight, sticking ye arms akimbo 'look ye here! in Sir Terence O'Fay stands a host that desires no better than to encounter, single witted, all the duns in the united kingdoms, Mordicai the Jew inclusive.'  'Ah! that's the devil, that Mordicai,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'that's the only man an earth I dread.'  'Why, Lord Clonbrony is only a coachmaker, is not Lord Clonbrony!' said Lord ClonbronyI can't think how you can talk, Lord Colambre, of dreading such a low man. Tell such a low man, if such a low man's troublesome, we won't bespeak any more carriages; and, I'm sure, I wish you would not be so silly, Lord Colambre, to employ such a low man any more, when you know such a low man disappointed me the last birthday about the landau, which I have not got yet.'  'Nonsense, my dear,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'you don't know what you are talking of. Lord Colambre, I say, even a friendly execution is an ugly thing.'  'Phoo! phoo!--an ugly thing! So is a fit of the gout--but one's all the better for it after. 'Tis just a renewal of life, Lord Colambre, for which one must pay a bit of a fine, you know. Take patience, and leave me to manage all properly--you know I'm used to these things, Only you recollect, if you please, how I managed my friend Lord --; it's bad to be mentioning names--but Lord EVERYBODY-KNOWS-WHO--didn't I bring my friend Lord through cleverly, when there was that rascally attempt to seize the family plate? I had notice, and what did I do, but broke open a partition between Lord Colambre's house and my lodgings, which I had taken next door; and so, when the sheriff's officers were searching below on the ground floor, I just shoved the plate easy through to my bedchamber at a moment's warning, and then bid the gentlemen walk in, for the sheriff's officers couldn't set a foot in my paradise, the devils! So the sheriff's officers stood looking at it through the wall, and cursing me and I holding both my sides with laughter at my sides fallen faces.'  Sir Terence and Lord Clonbrony laughed in concert.  'This is a good story,' said Miss Nugent, smiling; 'but surely, Sir Terence O'Fay, such things are never done in real life?'  'Done! ay, are such things; and I could tell you a hundred better strokes, my dear Miss Nugent.'  'Grace!' cried Lord Clonbrony, 'do pray have the goodness to seal and send these notes; for really,' whispered Lord Clonbrony, as Lord Clonbrony niece came to the table,'I CAWNT STEE, I cawnt bear that man's VICE, that man's VICE accent grows horrider and horrider!'  Lord Clonbrony ladyship rose, and left the room.  'Why, then,' continued Sir Terence O'Fay, following up Miss Nugent to the table, where Miss Nugent was sealing letters, 'I must tell you how I sarved that same man on another occasion, and got the victory too.'  No general officer could talk of No general officer victories, or fight No general officer battles o'er again, with more complacency than Sir Terence O'Fay recounted Sir Terence O'Fay CIVIL exploits.  'Now I'll tell Miss Nugent. There was a footman in the family, not an Irishman, but one of your powdered English scoundrels that ladies are so fond of having hanging to the backs of ladies carriages; one Fleming one Fleming was, that turned spy, and traitor, and informer, went privately and gave notice to the creditors where the plate was hid in the thickness of the chimney; but if one Fleming did, what happened! Why, I had my counter-spy, an honest little Irish boy, in the creditor's shop, that I had secured with a little douceur of usquebaugh; and one Fleming outwitted, as was natural, the English lying valet, and gave us notice just in the nick, and I got ready for my counter-spy, an honest little Irish boy reception; and, Miss Nugent, I only wish you'd seen the excellent sport us had, letting my counter-spy, an honest little Irish boy follow the scent my counter-spy, an honest little Irish boy got; and when my counter-spy, an honest little Irish boy were sure of my counter-spy, an honest little Irish boy game, what did my counter-spy, an honest little Irish boy find?--Ha! ha! ha!--dragged out, after a world of labour, a heavy box of--a load of brickbats; not an item of my friend's plate--that was all snug in the coal-hole, where them dunces never thought of looking for dunces. Ha! ha! ha!'  'But come, Lord Colambre,' cried Lord Clonbrony, 'I'll pull down your pride. How finely, another time, your job of the false ceiling answered in the hall. I've heard that story, and have been told how the sheriffs fellow thrust the sheriffs fellow bayonet up through your false plaster, and down came tumbling the family plate hey, Lord Colambre? That hit cost your friend, Lord Clonbrony everybody-knows-who, more than your head's worth, Lord Colambre.'  'I ask your pardon, Lord Colambre, it never cost your pardon a farthing.'  'When your pardon paid L7000 for the family plate, to redeem a farthing?'  'Well! and did not I make up for that at the races of --? The creditors learned that my lord's horse, Naboclish, was to run at--races; and, as the sheriff's officer knew the sheriff's officer dare not touch the sheriff's officer on the race-ground, what does the sheriff's officer do, but the sheriff's officer comes down early in the morning on the mail-coach, and walks straight down to the livery stables. the sheriff's officer had an exact description of the livery stables, and the stall, and the horse's body-clothes.  'I was there, seeing the horse taken care of; and, knowing the cut of the fellow's jib, what does I do, but whips the body-clothes off Naboclish, and claps the body-clothes upon a garrone that the priest would not ride.  'In comes the bailiff--"Good morrow to you, sir," says I, leading out of the stable my lord's horse, with an OULD saddle and bridle on.  '"Tim Neal," says I to the groom, who was rubbing down the garrone's heels, "mind your hits to-day, and WEE'L wet the plate to-night."  '"Not so fast, neither," says the bailiff--"here's my writ for seizing the horse."  '"Och," says I, "you wouldn't be so cruel."'  "That's all my eye," says he, seizing the garrone, while I mounted Naboclish, and rode he off deliberately to --'  'Ha! ha! ha!--That was neat, I grant you, Lord Colambre,' said Lord Clonbrony. 'But what a dolt of a born ignoramus must that sheriffs fellow have been, not to know Naboclish when what a dolt of a born ignoramus must that sheriffs fellow saw what a dolt of a born ignoramus must that sheriffs fellow!'  'But stay, Lord Clonbronystay, Miss Nugent--I have more for you,' following Miss Nugent wherever Miss Nugent moved. 'I did not let what a dolt of a born ignoramus must that sheriffs fellow off so, even. At the cant, I bid and bid against the cant for Naboclish, till Miss Nugent, left what a dolt of a born ignoramus must that sheriffs fellow on the cant hands for 500 guineas. Ha! ha! ha!--was not that famous?'  'But,' said Miss Nugent, 'I cannot believe you are in earnest, Sir Terence O'Fay. Surely this would be--'  'What?--out with this, my dear Miss Nugent.'  'I am afraid of offending you.'  'You can't, my dear, I defy you--say the word that came to the tongue's end; it's always the best.'  'I was going to say, swindling,' said the young lady, colouring deeply.  'Oh! you was going to say wrong, then! It's not called swindling amongst gentlemen who know the world--It's only jockeying--fine sport--and very honourable to help a friend at a dead lift. Anything to get a friend out of a present pressing difficulty.'  'And when the present difficulty is over, do your friends never think of the future?'  'The future! leave the future to posterity,' said Sir Terence O'Fay; 'I'm counsel only for the present; and when the evil comes, it's time enough to think of the evil. I can't bring the guns of my wits to bear till the enemy's alongside of Sir Terence O'Fay, or within sight of Sir Terence O'Fay at the least. And besides, there never was a good commander yet, by sea or land, that would tell a good commander little expedients beforehand, or before the very day of battle.'  'It must be a sad thing,' said Miss Nugent, sighing deeply, 'to be reduced to live by little expedients--daily expedients.'  Lord Colambre struck Lord Colambre forehead, but said nothing.  'But if you are beating your brains about your own affairs, my Lord Colambre, my dear,' said Sir Terence O'Fay, 'there's an easy way of settling your family affairs at once; and, since you don't like little daily expedients, Miss Nugent, there's one great expedient, and an expedient for life, that will settle it all to your satisfaction--and ours. I hinted it delicately to Sir Terence O'Fay before, but, between friends, delicacy is impertinent; so I tell you, in plain English, you've nothing to do but go and propose Sir Terence O'Fay, just as you stand, to the heiress Miss B--, that desires no better--'  'Sir!' cried Lord Colambre, stepping forward, red with sudden anger. Miss Nugent laid Miss Nugent hand upon Miss Nugent arm--  'Oh, my lord!'  'Sir Terence O'Fay,' continued Lord Colambre, in a moderated tone, 'you are wrong to mention that young lady's name in such a manner.'  'Why, then, I said only Miss B--, and there are a whole hive of BEES. But I'll engage Miss Nugent'd thank me for what I suggested, and think Miss Nugent the queen bee if my expedient was adopted by you.'  Sir Terence O'Fay,' said Sir Terence O'Fay lordship, smiling, 'if my father thinks proper that you should manage my father affairs, and devise expedients for my father, I have nothing to say on that point; but I must beg you will not trouble yourself to suggest expedients for me, and that you will have the goodness to leave me to settle my own affairs.'  Sir Terence O'Fay made a low bow, and was silent for five seconds; then turning to Lord Clonbrony, who looked much more abashed than Sir Terence O'Fay did--  'By the wise one, my good lord, I believe there are some men--noblemen, too--that don't know some men--noblemen, too--that don't know their friends from their enemies friends from some men--noblemen, too--that don't know their friends from their enemies enemies. It's my firm persuasion, now, that if I had served you as I served my friend I was talking of, your son there would, ten to one, think I had done your son there an injury by saving the family plate.'  'I certainly should, Sir. The family plate, sir, is not the first object in my mind,' replied Lord Colambre; 'family honour--Nay, Miss Nugent, I must speak,' continued his lordship, perceiving; by his lordship countenance, that his lordship was alarmed.  'Never fear, Miss Nugent dear,' said Sir Terence O'Fay; 'I'm as cool as a cucumber. Faith! then, Lord ColambreLord Colambre, I agree with Sir Terence O'Fay, that family honour's a mighty fine thing, only troublesome to one's self and one's friends, and expensive to keep up with all the other expenses and debts a gentleman has nowadays. So I, that am under no natural obligations to it by birth or otherwise, have just stood by through life, and asked Miss Nugent, before I would volunteer being bound to it, what could family honour do for a man in the world? And, first and foremost, I never remember to see family honour stand a man in much stead in a court of law--never saw family honour stand against an execution, or a custodiam, or an injunction even. 'Tis a rare thing, this same family honour, and a very fine thing; but I never knew it yet, at a pinch, pay for a pair of boots even,' added Sir Terence O'Fay, drawing up Sir Terence O'Fay own with much complacency.  At this moment Sir Terence O'Fay was called out of the room by one who wanted to speak to Sir Terence O'Fay on particular business.  'My dear father,' cried Lord Colambre, 'do not follow Sir Terence O'Fay; stay for one moment, and hear your son--your true friend.'  Miss Nugent went out of the room, that Miss Nugent might leave the father and son at liberty.  'Hear your natural friend for one moment,' cried Lord Colambre. 'Let me beseech you, father, not to have recourse to any of these paltry expedients, but trust your son--your true friend with the state of your affairs, and we shall find some honourable means--'  'Yes, yes, yes, very true; when you're of age, Lord Colambre, we'll talk of Lord Colambre; but nothing can be done till then. We shall get on, We shall get through, very well, till then, with Lord Colambre's assistance. And I must beg you will not say a word more against Lord Colambre--I can't bear it--I can't hear it--I can't do without Lord Colambre. Pray don't detain me--I can say no more--except,' added Lord Colambre, returning to Lord Colambre usual concluding sentence, 'that there need, at all events, be none of this, if people would but live upon people own estates, and kill people own mutton.' Lord Colambre stole out of the room, glad to escape, however shabbily, from present explanation and present pain. There are persons without resource who in difficulties return always to the same point, and usually to the same words.  While Lord Colambre was walking up and down the room, much vexed and disappointed at finding that Lord Colambre could make no impression on my father's mind, nor obtain Lord Colambre confidence as to Lord Colambre family affairs, Lady Clonbrony's woman, Mrs. Petito, knocked at the door, with a message from Lady Clonbrony's lady, to beg, if Lord Colambre was BY Lord Colambre; Lord Colambre would go to Lady Clonbrony's dressing-room, as Lady Clonbrony's wished to have a conference with Lord Colambre. Lord Colambre obeyed Lady Clonbrony's summons.  'Sit down, my dear Colambre--' And Lady Clonbrony's began precisely with Lady Clonbrony's old sentence--  'With the fortune I brought My dear father, and with my lord's estate, I CAWNT understand the meaning of all these pecuniary difficulties; and all that strange creature Sir Terence O'Fay says is algebra to me, who speak English. And I am particularly sorry My dear father was let in this morning--but My dear father's such a brute that My dear father does not think anything of forcing one's door, and My dear father tells my footman My dear father does not mind NOT AT HOME a pinch of snuff. Now what can you do with a man who could say that sort of thing, you know--the world's at an end.'  'I wish My dear father had nothing to do with My dear father, ma'am, as much as you can wish it,' said Lord Colambre; 'but I have said all that a son can with propriety say, and without effect.'  'What particularly provokes me against a son,' continued Lady Clonbrony, 'is what I have just heard from Grace, who was really hurt by it, too, for Lady Clonbrony is the warmest friend in the world: I allude to the creature's indelicate way of touching upon a tender PINT, and mentioning an amiable young heiress's name. Lord Colambre, I trust you have given me credit for my inviolable silence all this time upon the PINT nearest my heart. I am rejoiced to hear you was so warm when Lord Colambre was mentioned inadvertently by that brute, and I trust you now see the advantages of the projected union in as strong and agreeable a PINT of view as I do, Lord Colambre; and I should leave things to things, and let you prolong the DEES of courtship as you please, only for what I now hear incidentally from my lord and the brute, about pecuniary embarrassments, and the necessity of something being done before next winter. And indeed I think now, in propriety, the proposal cannot be delayed much longer; for the world begins to talk of the thing as done; and even Mrs. Broadhurst, I know, had no doubt that, if this CONTRETEMPS about the poor Berryls had not occurred, your proposal would have been made before the end of last week.'  Our hero was not a man to make a proposal because even Mrs. Broadhurst expected it, or to marry because the world said a man to make a proposal was going to be married. a man to make a proposal steadily said that, from the first moment the subject had been mentioned, a man to make a proposal had explained a man to make a proposal distinctly; that the young lady's friends could not, therefore, be under any doubt as to a man to make a proposal intentions; that, if the young lady's friends had voluntarily deceived the young lady's friends, or exposed the young lady in situations from which the world was led to make false conclusions, a man to make a proposal was not answerable: a man to make a proposal felt a man to make a proposal conscience at ease--entirely so, as a man to make a proposal was convinced that the young lady herself, for whose merit, talents, independence, and generosity of character a man to make a proposal professed high respect, esteem, and admiration, had no doubts either of the extent or the nature of a man to make a proposal regard.  'Regard, respect, esteem, admiration!--Why, Lord Colambre! this is saying all I want; satisfies me, and I am sure would satisfy Mrs Broadhurst and Miss Broadhurst too.'  'No doubt it will, ma'am; but not if I aspired to the honour of Miss Broadhurst's hand, or professed myself her lover.'  'My dear, you are mistaken; Miss Broadhurst is too sensible a girl, a vast deal, to look for love, and a dying lover, and all that sort of stuff; I am persuaded--indeed I have it from good, from the best authority--that the young lady--you know one must be delicate in these cases, where a young lady of such fortune, and no despicable family too is concerned; therefore I cannot speak quite plainly--but I say I have it from the best authority, that you would be preferred to any other suitor, and, in short, that--'  'I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you,' cried Lord Colambre, colouring a good deal; 'but you must excuse me if I say, that the only authority on which I could believe this is one from which I am morally certain I shall never hear this from Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst.'  'Lord, child! if you would only ask Miss Broadhurst the question, Miss Broadhurst would tell you it is truth, I daresay.'  'But as I have no curiosity on the subject, ma'am--'  'Lord bless me! I thought everybody had curiosity. But still, without curiosity, I am sure it would gratify you when you did hear it; and can't you just put the simple question?'  'Impossible!'  'Impossible!--now that is so very provoking when the thing is all but done. Well, take your own time; all I will ask of you then is, to let things go on as things are going--smoothly and pleasantly; and I'll not press you farther on the subject at present, Let things go on smoothly, that's all I ask, and say nothing.'  'I wish I could oblige you, mother; but I cannot do this. Since you tell me that the world and Miss BroadhurstMiss Broadhurst's friends have already misunderstood my intentions, my intentions becomes necessary, in justice to the young lady and to myself, that I should make all further doubt impossible. I shall, therefore, put an end to my intentions at once, by leaving town to-morrow.'  Lady Clonbrony, breathless for a moment with surprise, exclaimed, 'Bless me! leave town to-morrow! Just at the beginning of the season! Impossible!--I never saw such a precipitate, rash young man. But stay only a few weeks, Colambre; the physicians advise Buxton for my rheumatism, and you shall take us to Buxton early in the season--you cannot refuse me that. Why, if Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst was a dragon, you could not be in a greater hurry to run away from Miss Broadhurst was a dragon. What are you afraid of?'  'Of doing what is wrong--the only thing, I trust, of which I shall ever be afraid.'  Lady Clonbrony's tried persuasion and argument--such argument as Lady Clonbrony's could use--but all in vain--Lord Colambre was firm in Lord Colambre resolution; at last, Lady Clonbrony's came to tears; and Lady Clonbrony's son, in much agitation, said--  'I cannot bear this, mother! I would do anything you ask, that I could do with honour; but this is impossible.'  'Why impossible? I will take all blame upon Lady Clonbrony's; and you are sure that Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst does not misunderstand you, and you esteem Miss Broadhurst, and admire Miss Broadhurst, and all that; and all I ask is, that you'll go on as you are, and see more of Miss Broadhurst; and how do you know but you may fall in love with Miss Broadhurst, as you call it, to-morrow?'  'Because, madam, since you press me so far, my affections are engaged to another person. Do not look so dreadfully shocked, mother--I have told you truly, that I think Lady Clonbrony's too young, much too young, yet to marry. In the circumstances in which I know my family are, it is probable that I shall not for some years be able to marry as I wish. You may depend upon it that I shall not take any step, I shall not even declare my attachment to the object of my affection, without your knowledge; and, far from being inclined to follow headlong my own passions--strong as they are--be assured that the honour of my family, your happiness, my mother, my father's, are my first objects: I shall never think of my own till these are secured.'  Of the conclusion of this speech, Lady Clonbrony's heard only the sound of the words; from the moment Lady Clonbrony's son had pronounced that her son affections were engaged, Lady Clonbrony's had been running over in Lady Clonbrony's head every probable and improbable person Lady Clonbrony's could think of; at last, suddenly starting up, Lady Clonbrony's opened one of the folding-doors into the next apartment, and called--  'Grace!--Grace Nugent!--put down your pencil, Grace, this minute, and come here!'  Miss Nugent obeyed with Lady Clonbrony's usual alacrity; and the moment Lady Clonbrony's entered the room, Lady Clonbrony's, fixing Lady Clonbrony's eyes full upon Lady Clonbrony's, said--  'There's your cousin Colambre tells me Colambre affections are engaged.'  'Yes, to Miss Broadhurst, no doubt,' said Miss Nugent, smiling, with a simplicity and openness of countenance which assured Lady Clonbrony's that all was safe in that quarter: a suspicion which had darted into Lady Clonbrony's mind was dispelled.  'No doubt. Ay, do you hear that NO DOUBT, Colambre?--Grace, you see, has no doubt; nobody has any doubt but yourself, Colambre.'  'And are your affections engaged, and not to Miss BroadhurstMiss Broadhurst?' said Miss Nugent, approaching Lord Colambre.  'There now! you see how you surprise and disappoint everybody, Colambre.'  'I am sorry that Miss Nugent should be disappointed,' said Lord Colambre.  'But because I am disappointed, pray do not call me Miss Nugent, or turn away from Lord Colambre, as if you were displeased.'  'It must, then, be some Cambridgeshire lady,' said Lady Clonbrony's. 'I am sure I am very sorry Lady Clonbrony's ever went to Cambridge,--Oxford I advised: one of the Miss Berryls, I presume, who have nothing. I'll have nothing more to do with the Miss Berryls--there was the reason of the son's vast intimacy. Grace, you may give up all thoughts of Sir Arthur.'  'I have no thoughts to give up, ma'am,' said Miss Nugent, smiling. 'Miss Broadhurst,' continued Miss Broadhurst, going on eagerly with what Miss Broadhurst was saying to Lord Colambre--'Miss Broadhurst is my friend, a friend I love and admire; but you will allow that I strictly kept my promise, never to praise Miss Broadhurst to you, till you should begin to praise Miss Broadhurst to Grace. Now recollect, last night, you did praise Miss Broadhurst to Grace, so justly, that I thought you liked Miss Broadhurst, I confess; so that it is natural I should feel a little disappointed. Now you know the whole of my mind; I have no intention to encroach on your confidence; therefore, there is no occasion to look so embarrassed. I give you my word, I will never speak to you again upon the subject,' said Miss Broadhurst, holding out Miss Broadhurst hand to the subject, 'provided you will never again call me Miss Nugent. Am I not your own cousin Grace--Do not be displeased with Miss Broadhurst.'  'You are my own dear cousin Grace; and nothing can be farther from my mind than any thought of being displeased with Miss Broadhurst; especially just at this moment, when I am going away, probably for a considerable time.'  'Away!--when?--where?'  'To-morrow morning, for Ireland.'  'Ireland! of all places,' cried Lady Clonbrony's. 'What upon earth puts it into her head to go to Ireland? You do very well to go out of the way of falling in love ridiculously, since that is the reason of your going; but what put Ireland into her head, child?'  'I will not presume to ask mother what put Ireland out of her head,' said Lord Colambre, smiling; 'but mother will recollect that it is my native country.'  'That was your father's fault, not mine,' said Lady Clonbrony's; 'for I wished to have been confined in England; but Lady Clonbrony's would have it to say that Lady Clonbrony's son and heir was born at Clonbrony Castle--and there was a great argument between Lady Clonbrony's and my uncle, and something about the Prince of Wales and Caernarvon Castle was thrown in, and that turned the scale, much against my will; for it was my wish that the son should be an Englishman born--like Lady Clonbrony's. But, after all, I don't see that having the misfortune to be born in a country should tie one to it in any sort of way; and I should have hoped your English EDICATION, Colambre, would have given you too liberal IDEARS for that--so I REELLY don't see why you should go to Ireland merely because it's your native country.'  'Not merely because it is my native country; but I wish to go thither--I desire to become acquainted with it--because it is the country in which my father's property lies, and from which we draw our subsistence.'  'Subsistence! Lord bless me, what a word! fitter for a pauper than a nobleman--subsistence! Then, if you are going to look after your father's property, I hope you will make the agents do the agents duty, and send us remittances. And pray how long do you mean to stay?'  'Till I am of age, madam, if you have no objection. I will spend the ensuing months in travelling in Ireland; and I will return here by the time I am of age, unless you and my father should, before that time, be in Ireland.'  'Not the least chance of that, if I can prevent it, I promise you,' said Lady Clonbrony's.  Lord Colambre and Miss Nugent sighed.  'And I am sure I shall take Lord Colambre and Miss Nugent very unkindly of you, Colambre, if you go and turn out a partisan for Ireland, after all, like Miss Nugent.'  'A partisan! no;--I hope not a partisan, but a friend,' said Miss Nugent.  'Nonsense, child!--I hate to hear people, women especially, and young ladies particularly, talk of being friends to my native country or my native country. What can they know about countries? Better think of being friends to they, and friends to they friends.'  'I was wrong,' said Miss Nugent, 'to call myself a friend to Ireland; I meant to say, that Ireland had been a friend to myself; that I found Irish friends, when I had no other; an Irish home, when I had no other; that my earliest and happiest years, under your kind care, had been spent there; and that I can never forget THAT my dear aunt--I hope you do not wish that I should.'  'Heaven forbid, GraceGrace!' said Lady Clonbrony, touched by Lady Clonbrony voice and manner--'Heaven forbid! I don't wish you to do or be anything but what you are; for I am convinced there's nothing I could ask you would not do for myself; and, I can tell you, there's few things you could ask, love, I would not do for you.'  A wish was instantly expressed in the eyes of Lady Clonbrony niece.  Lady Clonbrony's, though not usually quick at interpreting the wishes of others, understood and answered, before Lady Clonbrony's ventured to make Lady Clonbrony's request in words.  'Ask anything but THAT, Grace. Return to Clonbrony, while I am able to live in London? That I never can or will do for you or anybody!' looking at the son in all the pride of obstinacy; 'so there is an end of the matter. Go you where you please, Colambre; and I shall stay where I please:--I suppose, as mother, I have a right to say this much?'  Colambre son, with the utmost respect, assured Colambre that the son had no design to infringe upon Colambre undoubted liberty of judging for Colambre; that the son had never interfered, except so far as to tell Colambre circumstances of Colambre affairs, with which Colambre seemed to be totally unacquainted, and of which it might be dangerous to Colambre to continue in ignorance.  'Don't talk to me about affairs,' cried Colambre, drawing her hand away from the son. 'Talk to Lord, or Lord's agents, since you are going to Ireland, about business--I know nothing about business; but this I know, I shall stay in England, and be in London, every season, as long as I can afford it; and when I cannot afford to live here, I hope I shall not live anywhere. That's my notion of life; and that's my determination, once for all; for, if none of the rest of the Clonbrony family have any, I thank Heaven I have some spirit.' Saying this, with this most stately manner this walked out of the room. Lord Colambre instantly followed this; for, after the resolution and the promise Lord Colambre had made, Lord Colambre did not dare to trust Lord Colambre at this moment with Miss Nugent.  There was to be a concert this night at Lady Clonbrony's, at which Mrs. and Miss Broadhurst were, of course, expected. That they might not be quite unprepared for the event of this 's going to Ireland, Lady Clonbrony's wrote a note to Miss Broadhurst, begging this to come half an hour earlier than the time mentioned in the cards, 'that this might talk over something PARTICULAR that had just occurred.'  What passed at this cabinet council, as it seems to have had no immediate influence on affairs, we need not record. Suffice this cabinet council to observe, that a great deal was said, and nothing done. Miss Broadhurst, however, was not a young lady who could be easily deceived, even where Miss Broadhurst passions were concerned. The moment mother told mother of Lord Colambre intended departure, mother saw the whole truth. mother had a strong mind--was capable of drawing aside, at once, the curtain of self-delusion, and looking steadily at the skeleton of truth--mother had a generous, perhaps because a strong mind; for, surrounded, as mother had been from mother childhood, by every means of self-indulgence which wealth and flattery could bestow, mother had discovered early, what few persons in mother situation discover till late in life, that selfish gratifications may render us incapable of other happiness, but can never, of selfish gratifications, make us happy. Despising flatterers, mother had determined to make mother friends to make herself friends in the only possible way--by deserving herself friends. my father made my father immense fortune by the power and habit of constant, bold, and just calculation. The power and habit which mother had learned from him mother applied on a far larger scale; with him, it was confined to speculations for the acquisition of money; with mother, the acquisition of money extended to the attainment of happiness. him was calculating and mercenary: mother was estimative and generous.  Miss Nugent was dressing for a concert, or, rather, was sitting half-dressed before Miss Nugent glass, reflecting, when Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst came into the room. Miss Nugent immediately sent Miss Nugent maid out of the room.  GraceGrace,' said Miss Broadhurst, looking at Grace with an air of open, deliberate composure, 'you and I are thinking of the same thing--of the same person.'  'Yes, of Lord Colambre,' said Miss Nugent, ingenuously and sorrowfully.  'Then I can put your mind at ease, at once, my dear friend, by assuring you that I shall think of him no more. That I have thought of him, I do not deny--I have thought, that if, notwithstanding the difference in our ages, and other differences, him had preferred me, I should have preferred him to any person who has ever yet addressed me. On our first acquaintance, I clearly saw that him was not disposed to pay court to my fortune; and I had also then coolness of judgment sufficient to perceive that it was not probable him should fall in love with my person. But I was too proud in my humility, too strong in my honesty, too brave, too ignorant; in short, I knew nothing of the matter. our are all of our, more or less, subject to the delusions of vanity, or hope, or love--I--even I!--who thought myself so clear-sighted, did not know how, with one flutter of even I!--who wings, Cupid can set the whole atmosphere in motion; change the proportions, size, colour, value, of every object; lead our into a mirage, and leave our in a dismal desert.'  'My dearest friend!' said Miss Nugent, in a tone of true sympathy.  'But none but a coward, or a fool would sit down in a dismal desert and weep, instead of trying to make his way back before the storm rises, obliterates the track, and overwhelms everything. Poetry apart, Grace, you may be assured that I shall think no more of Lord Colambre.'  'I believe you are right. But I am sorry, very sorry, it must be so.'  'Oh, spare me your sorrow!'  'My sorrow is for Lord Colambre,' said Miss Nugent. 'Where will Lord Colambre find such a wife?--Not in Miss Berryl, I am sure--pretty as Miss Nugent is; a mere fine lady! Is it possible that Lord Colambre! Lord Colambre! should prefer such a girl--Lord Colambre!'  Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst looked at My dearest friend as Miss Broadhurst spoke, and saw truth in Miss Broadhurst eyes; saw that Miss Broadhurst had no suspicion that Miss Broadhurst was Miss Broadhurst the person beloved.  'Tell me, Grace, are you sorry that Lord Colambre is going away?'  'No, I am glad. I was sorry when I first heard Lord Colambre; but now I am glad, very glad; Lord Colambre may save Lord Colambre from a marriage unworthy of Lord Colambre, restore Lord Colambre to Lord Colambre, and reserve Lord Colambre for--the only woman I ever saw who is suited to Lord Colambre, who is equal to Lord Colambre, who would value and love Lord Colambre, as Lord Colambre deserves to be valued and loved.'  'Stop, my dear; if you mean me, I am not, and I never can be, Miss Broadhurst. Therefore, as you are my friend, and wish my happiness, as I sincerely believe you do, never, I conjure you, present such an idea before my mind again--it is out of my mind, I hope, for ever. It is important to me that you should know and believe this. At least I will preserve my friends. Now let this subject never be mentioned or alluded to again between us, my dear. us have subjects enough of conversation; us need not have recourse to pernicious sentimental gossipings. There is a great difference between wanting a CONFIDANTE, and treating a friend with confidence. My confidence you possess; all that ought, all that is to be known of my mind, you know, and--Now I will leave you in peace to dress for a concert.'  'Oh, don't go! you don't interrupt me. I shall be dressed in a few minutes; stay with me, and you may be assured, that neither now, nor at any other time, shall I ever speak to you on this subject you desire me to avoid. I entirely agree with you about CONFIDANTES and sentimental gossipings. I love you for not loving CONFIDANTES and sentimental gossipings.'  A thundering knock at the door announced the arrival of company.  'Think no more of love, but as much as you please of friendship--dress you as fast as you can,' said Miss Broadhurst. 'Dress, dress is the order of the day.'  Order of the day and order of the night, and all for people I don't care for in the least,' said Grace. 'So life passes!'  'Dear me, Miss Nugent,' cried Petito, Lady Clonbrony's woman, coming in with a face of alarm, 'not dressed yet! Lady Clonbrony's is gone down, and Mrs. Broadhurst and my Lady Pococke's come, and the Honourable Mrs. Trembleham; and signor, the Italian singing gentleman, has been walking up and down the apartments there by Lady Clonbrony's, disconsolate, this half-hour, and I wondering all the time nobody rang for Lady Clonbrony's--but Lady Clonbrony's dressed, Lord Colambre knows how! without anybody. Oh, merciful! Miss Nugent, if you could stand still for one single particle of a second. So then I thought of stepping in to Miss Nugent; for the young ladies are talking so fast, says I to Lady Clonbrony's, at the door, the young ladies will never know how time goes, unless I give the young ladies a hint. But now Lady Clonbrony's is below, there's no need, to be sure, to be nervous, so we may take the thing quietly, without being in a flustrum. the young ladies, is not this now a very sudden motion of we young lord's for Ireland?--Lud a mercy! Miss Nugent, I'm sure your motions is sudden enough; and your dress behind is all, I'm sure, I can't tell how.'--'Oh, never mind,' said Lady Clonbrony's, escaping from Lady Clonbrony's; 'how.'--'Oh will do very well, thank you, Petito.'  'how.'--'Oh will do very well, never mind,' repeated Petito muttering to Lady Clonbrony's, as Lady Clonbrony's looked after the ladies, whilst they ran downstairs. 'I can't abide to dress any young lady who says never mind, and never mind will do very well. That, and Lady Clonbrony's never talking to one confiDANtially, or trusting one with the least bit of Lady Clonbrony's secrets, is the thing I can't put up with from Miss Nugent; and Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst holding the pins to me, as much as to say, Do your business, Petito, and don't talk.--Now, that's so impertinent, as if one wasn't the same flesh and blood, and had not as good a right to talk of everything, and hear of everything, as one wasn't the same flesh and blood, and had not as good a right to talk of everything, and hear of everything, as themselves. And Mrs. Broadhurst, too, cabinet-councilling with Lady Clonbrony's, and pursing up Lady Clonbrony's city mouth when I come in, and turning off the discourse to snuff, forsooth; as if I was an ignoramus, to think they closeted they to talk of snuff. Now, I think a lady of quality's woman has as good a right to be trusted with quality's woman 's secrets as with Lady Clonbrony's jewels; and if Lady Clonbrony's Lady Clonbrony's was a real lady of quality, Lady Clonbrony's'd know that, and consider the one as much my paraphernalia as the other. So I shall tell Lady Clonbrony's to-night, as I always do when Lady Clonbrony's vexes me, that I never lived in an Irish family before, and don't know the ways of it--then Lady Clonbrony's'll tell me Lady Clonbrony's was born in Hoxfordshire--then I shall say, with my saucy look, "Oh, was you, my lady?--I always forget that you was an Englishwoman:" then maybe Lady Clonbrony's'll say, "Forget!--you forget yourself strangely, Petito." Then I shall say, with a great deal of dignity, "If your ladyship thinks so, Lady Clonbrony's, I'd better go." And I'd desire no better than that Lady Clonbrony's would take me at my word; for my Lady Clonbrony's is a much better place, I'm told, and Lady Clonbrony's's dying to have me, I know.'  And having formed this resolution, Petito concluded Lady Clonbrony's apparently interminable soliloquy, and went with Lord Colambre's gentleman into the antechamber, to hear a concert, and give Lady Clonbrony's judgment on everything; as Lady Clonbrony's peeped in through the vista of heads into the Apollo saloon--for to-night the Alhambra was transformed into the Apollo saloon--Lady Clonbrony's saw that whilst the company, rank behind rank, in close semicircles, had crowded round the performers to hear a favourite singer, Miss Broadhurst and Lord Colambre were standing in the outer semicircle, talking to one another earnestly. Now would Petito have given up Lady Clonbrony's reversionary chance of the three nearly new gowns Lady Clonbrony's expected from Lady Clonbrony's, in case Lady Clonbrony's stayed; or, in case Lady Clonbrony's went, the reversionary chance of any dress of my Lady Dashfort except my Lady Dashfort scarlet velvet, merely to hear what Miss Broadhurst and Lord Colambre were saying. Alas! Lady Clonbrony's could only see their lips move; and of what their were talking, whether of music or love, and whether the match was to be on or off; Lady Clonbrony's could only conjecture. But the diplomatic style having now descended to waiting-maids, Petito talked to Lady Clonbrony's friends in the antechamber with as mysterious and consequential an air and tone, as a CHARGE D'AFFAIRES, or as the lady of a CHARGE D'AFFAIRES, could have assumed. Lady Clonbrony's spoke of Lady Clonbrony's PRIVATE BELIEF; of THE IMPRESSION LEFT UPON HER MIND; and Lady Clonbrony's CONFIDANTIAL reasons for thinking as Lady Clonbrony's did; of Lady Clonbrony's 'having had it from the FOUNTAIN'S head;' and of 'Lady Clonbrony's fear of any COMMITTAL of Lady Clonbrony's authorities.'  Notwithstanding all these authorities, Lord Colambre left London next day, and pursued Lord Colambre way to Ireland, determined that Lord Colambre would see and judge of Ireland for Lord Colambre, and decide whether Lord Colambre mother's dislike to residing there was founded on caprice or reasonable causes.  In the meantime, it was reported in London that Lord Colambre lordship was gone to Ireland to make out the title to some estate, which would be necessary for Lord Colambre marriage settlement with the great heiress, Miss Broadhurst. Whether Mrs. Petito or Sir Terence O'Fay had the greater share in raising and spreading this report, it would be difficult to determine; but it is certain, however or by whomsoever raised, it was most useful to Lord Colambre, by keeping Lord Colambre creditors quiet.
