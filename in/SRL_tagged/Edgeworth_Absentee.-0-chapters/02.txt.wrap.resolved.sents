 Full of what he had heard, and impatient to obtain further information respecting the state of he father's affairs, Lord Colambre hastened home; but his father was out, and he mother was engaged with Mr. Soho, directing, or rather being directed, how his mother apartments should be fitted up for his mother gala.
As Lord Colambre entered the room, Lord Colambre saw Lord Colambre mother, Miss Nugent, and Mr. Soho, standing at a large table, which was covered with rolls of paper, patterns, and drawings of furniture: Mr. Soho was speaking in a conceited dictatorial tone, asserting that there was no 'colour in nature for that room equal to THE BELLY-O'-THE FAWN;' which BELLY-O'-THE FAWN Lord Colambre so pronounced that Lady Clonbrony understood it to be LA BELLE UNIFORME, and, under this mistake, repeated and assented to the assertion till it was set to rights, with condescending superiority, by the upholsterer.
This first architectural upholsterer of the age, as he styled he, and was universally admitted to be by all the world of fashion, then, with full powers given to he, spoke EN MAITRE.
The whole face of things must be changed--there must be new hangings, new draperies, new cornices, new candelabras, new everything!
The upholsterer's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,<br />      Glances from ceiling to floor, from floor to ceiling;<br />      And, as imagination bodies forth<br />      The form of things unknown, th' upholsterer's pencil<br />      Turns to shape and gives to airy nothing<br />      A local habitation and a NAME.<br /> Of the value of a NAME no one could be more sensible than Mr. Soho.
'Your la'ship sees--this is merely a scratch of my pencil--your la'ship's sensible--just to give you an idea of the shape, the form of the thing.
You fill up your angles here with ECOINIERES--round your walls with the TURKISH TENT DRAPERY--a fancy of my own--in apricot cloth, or crimson velvet, suppose, or EN FLUTE, in crimson satin draperies, fanned and riched with gold fringes, EN SUITE--intermediate spaces, Apollo's heads with gold rays--and here, ma'am, you place four CHANCELIERES, with chimeras at the corners, covered with blue silk and silver fringe, elegantly fanciful--with my STATIRA CANOPY here--light blue silk draperies--aerial tint, with silver balls--and for seats here, the SERAGLIO OTTOMANS, superfine scarlet--your paws--griffin--golden--and golden tripods, here, with antique cranes--and oriental alabaster tables here and there--quite appropriate, your la'ship feels.
'And--let me reflect.
For the next apartment, it strikes me--as your la'ship don't value expense--THE ALHAMBRA HANGINGS--my own thought entirely.
Now, before I unroll --THE ALHAMBRA HANGINGS--my own thought entirely, Lady Clonbrony, I must beg you'll not mention I've shown --THE ALHAMBRA HANGINGS--my own thought entirely.
I give you my sacred honour, not a soul has set eye upon the Alhambra hangings, except Mrs. Dareville, who stole a peep; I refused, absolutely refused, the Duchess of Torcaster--but I can't refuse your la'ship.
So see, ma'am--(unrolling them)--scagliola porphyry columns supporting the grand dome--entablature, silvered and decorated with imitative bronze ornaments; under the entablature, A VALANCE IN PELMETS, of puffed scarlet silk, would have an unparalleled grand effect, seen through the arches--with the TREBISOND TRELLICE PAPER, would make a TOUT ENSEMBLE, novel beyond example.
On that Trebisond trellice paper, I confess, ladies, I do pique myself.
'Then, for the little room, I recommend turning the little room temporarily into a Chinese pagoda, with this CHINESE PAGODA PAPER, with the PORCELAIN border, and josses, and jars, and beakers to match; and I can venture to promise one vase of pre-eminent size and beauty.
Oh, indubitably!
if your la'ship prefers your la'ship, you can have the EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHIC PAPER, with the IBIS BORDER to match!
The only objection is, one sees your la'ship everywhere--quite antediluvian--gone to the hotels even; but, to be sure, if your la'ship has a fancy--At all events, I humbly recommend, what your la'ship Grace of Torcaster longs to patronise, my MOON CURTAINS, with candlelight draperies.
A demisaison elegance this--I hit off yesterday--and--true, your la'ship's quite correct--out of the common, completely.
And, of course, you'd have the SPHYNX CANDELABRAS, and the Phoenix argands.
Oh!
nothing else lights now, ma'am!
Expense!
Expense of the whole!
Impossible to calculate here on the spot!--but nothing at all worth your ladyship's consideration!'
At another moment, Lord Colambre might have been amused with all this rhodomontade, and with the airs and voluble conceit of the orator; but, after what Lord Colambre had heard at Mr. Mordicai's, this whole scene struck Mr. Mordicai more with melancholy than with mirth.
Mr. Mordicai was alarmed by the prospect of new and unbounded expense; provoked, almost past enduring, by the jargon and impertinence of this upholsterer; mortified and vexed to the heart to see Mr. Mordicai mother the dupe, the sport of such a coxcomb.
'Prince of puppies!--insufferable!--My own mother!'
Lord Colambre repeated to Lord Colambre, as Lord Colambre walked hastily up and down the room.
'Lord Colambre, won't you let us have your judgment--your TEESTE' said Lord Colambre mother.
'Excuse me, ma'am.
I have no taste, no judgment, in these things.'
Lord Colambre sometimes paused, and looked at Mr. Soho with a strong inclination to--But knowing that Lord Colambre should say too much, if Lord Colambre said anything, Lord Colambre was silent never dared to approach the council table--but continued walking up and down the room, till Lord Colambre heard a voice, which at once arrested Lord Colambre attention, and soothed Lord Colambre ire.
Lord Colambre approached the council table instantly, and listened, whilst Grace Nugent said everything Lord Colambre wished to have said, and with all the propriety and delicacy with which Lord Colambre thought Lord Colambre could not have spoken.
Lord Colambre leaned on the council table, and fixed Lord Colambre eyes upon Mr. Soho--years ago, Lord Colambre had seen Lord Colambre cousin--last night, Lord Colambre had thought Mr. Soho handsome, pleasing, graceful--but now, Lord Colambre saw a new person, or Lord Colambre saw Mr. Soho in a new light.
Lord Colambre marked the superior intelligence, the animation, the eloquence of Mr. Soho countenance, its variety, whilst alternately, with arch raillery or grave humour, Mr. Soho played off Mr. Soho, and made Lord Colambre magnify the ridicule, till it was apparent even to Lady Clonbrony.
Lord Colambre observed the anxiety, lest Lord Colambre mother should expose his mother own foibles--Lord Colambre was touched by the respectful, earnest kindness--the soft tones of persuasion, with which his mother addressed Lord Colambre mother--the care not to presume upon his mother own influence--the good sense, the taste his mother showed, yet not displaying his mother superiority--the address, temper, and patience, with which his mother at last accomplished his mother purpose, and prevented Lady Clonbrony from doing anything preposterously absurd, or exorbitantly extravagant.
Lord Colambre was actually sorry when the business was ended--when Mr. Soho departed--for Grace Nugent was then silent; and the business was necessary to remove Grace Nugent eyes from that countenance, on which Grace Nugent had gazed unobserved.
Beautiful and graceful, yet so unconscious was his mother of his mother charms, that the eye of admiration could rest upon his mother without his mother perceiving it--his mother seemed so intent upon others as totally to forget his mother.
The whole train of Lord Colambre thoughts was so completely deranged that, although Lord Colambre was sensible there was something of importance Lord Colambre had to say to Lord Colambre mother, yet, when Mr. Soho's departure left Lord Colambre opportunity to speak, Lord Colambre stood silent, unable to recollect anything but--Grace Nugent.
When Grace Nugent left the room, after some minutes' silence, and some effort, Lord Colambre said to his mother, 'Pray, madam, do you know anything of Sir Terence O'Fay?'
'I!'
Said Lady Clonbrony, drawing up Lady Clonbrony head proudly; 'I know her head is a person I cannot endure.
her head is no friend of mine, I can assure you--nor any such sort of person.'
'I thought it was impossible!'
cried Lord Colambre, with exultation.
'I only wish your father, Colambre, could say as much,' added Lady Clonbrony.
Lord Colambre's countenance fell again; and again Lord Colambre was silent for some time.
'Does my father dine at home, ma'am?'
'I suppose not; Lord Colambre seldom dines at home.'
'Perhaps, ma'am, my father may have some cause to be uneasy about--'  'About?'
said Lady Clonbrony, in a tone, and with a look of curiosity which convinced her head that her knew nothing of Lord Colambre debts or distresses, if Lord Colambre had any.
'About what?'
repeated her ladyship.
Here was no receding, and Lord Colambre never had recourse to artifice.
'About Lord Colambre affairs, I was going to say, madam.
But, since you know nothing of any difficulties or embarrassments, I am persuaded that none exist.'
Nay, I CAWNT tell you that, Lord Colambre.
There are difficulties for ready money, I confess, when I ask for it, which surprise me often.
I know nothing of affairs--ladies of a certain rank seldom do, you know.
But, considering your father's estate, and the fortune I brought your father's estate,' added your father's estate , proudly, 'CAWNT CAWNT conceive it at all.
Grace Nugent, indeed, often talks to CAWNT of embarrassments and economy; but that, poor thing, is very natural for her, because her fortune is not particularly large, and her has left it all, or almost all, in her uncle and guardian's hands.
I know her's often distressed for odd money to lend me, and that makes her anxious.'
'Is not Grace Nugent very much admired, ma'am, in London?'
'Of course--in the company her is in, you know, her has every advantage.
And her has a natural family air of fashion--not but what her would have got on much better, if, when her first appeared in Lon'on, her had taken my advice, and wrote her on her cards Miss de Nogent, which would have taken off the prejudice against the IRICISM of Grace Nugent, you know; and there is a Count de Nogent.'
'I did not know there was any such prejudice, ma'am.
There may be among a certain set; but, I should think, not among well-informed, well-bred people.'
'I BIG your PAWDON, Colambre; surely I, that was born in England, an Henglish-woman BAWN!
must be well INFAWMED on this PINT, anyway.'
Lord Colambre was respectfully silent.
'Mother,' resumed Lord Colambre, 'I wonder that Grace Nugent is not married!'
'That is Miss Nugent is not married own fau't, entirely; Miss Nugent is not married has refused very good offers--establishments that, I own, I think, as Lady Langdale says, I was to blame to allow Miss Nugent is not married to let pass; but young LEDIES till they are twenty, always think they can do better.
Mr. Martingale, of Martingale, proposed for Miss Nugent is not married, but Miss Nugent is not married objected to Martingale on account of Martingale's being on the turf; and Mr. St. Albans' L7000 a year--because--I REELLY forget what--I believe only because Miss Nugent is not married did not like Martingale--and something about principles.
Now there is Colonel Heathcock, one of the most fashionable young men you see, always with the Duchess of Torcaster and that set--Heathcock takes a vast deal of notice of Miss Nugent is not married, for Martingale; and yet, I'm persuaded, Miss Nugent is not married would not have Martingale to-morrow, if Martingale came to the PINT, and for no reason, REELLY now, that Miss Nugent is not married can give me, but because Miss Nugent is not married says Martingale's a coxcomb.
Grace Nugent has a tincture of Irish pride.
But, for my part, I rejoice that Grace Nugent is so difficult, for I don't know what I should do without Grace Nugent.'
'Grace Nugent is indeed--very much attached to you, mother, I am convinced,' said Lord Colambre, beginning Lord Colambre sentence with great enthusiasm, and ending it with great sobriety.
'Indeed then, mother's a sweet girl, and I am very partial to mother, there's the truth,' cried Lady Clonbrony, in an undisguised Irish accent, and with mother natural warm manner.
But a moment afterwards mother features and whole form resumed their constrained stillness and stiffness, and, in mother English accent, mother continued--  'Before you put my IDEES out of my head, Colambre, I had something to say to you--Oh!
I know what it was--we were talking of embarrassments--and I wished to do my father the justice to mention to you that my father has been UNCOMMON LIBERAL to me about this gala, and has REELLY given me carte-blanche; and I've a notion--indeed I know--that it is you, Lord Colambre, I am to thank for this.'
'Me!--ma'am!'
'Yes!
Did not my father give you any hint?'
'No, ma'am; I have seen my father but for half an hour since I came to town, and in that time my father said nothing to me--of his affairs.'
'But what I allude to is more your affair.'
'my father did not speak to me of any affairs, ma'am--my father spoke only of my horses.'
'Then I suppose my father leaves it to me to open the matter to you.
I have the pleasure to tell you, that we have in view for you--and I think I may say with more than the approbation of all her family--an alliance--'  'Oh!
my dear mother!
you cannot be serious,' cried Lord Colambre; 'you know I am not of years of discretion yet--I shall not think of marrying these ten years, at least.'
'Why not?
Nay, Lord Colambre, don't go, I beg--I am serious, I assure you--and, to convince you of it, I shall tell you candidly, at once, my father told me: that now you've done with Cambridge, and are come to Lon'on, my father agrees with me in wishing that you should make the figure you ought to make, Colambre, as sole heir-apparent to the Clonbrony estate, and all that sort of thing.
But, on the other hand, living in Lon'on, and making you the handsome allowance you ought to have, are, both together, more than my father can afford, without inconvenience, my father tells me.'
'I assure you, mother, I shall be content--'  'No, no; you must not be content, child, and you must hear me.
You must live in a becoming style, and make a proper appearance.
I could not present you to my friends here, nor be happy, if you did not, Colambre.
Now the way is clear before my friends here: you have birth and title, here is fortune ready made; you will have a noble estate of your own when old Quin dies, and you will not be any encumbrance or inconvenience to your father or anybody.
Marrying an heiress accomplishes all this at once; and the young lady is everything we could wish, besides--you will meet again at this gala.
Indeed, between we, the young lady is the grand object of this gala; all the young lady friends will come EN MASSE, and one should wish that all her friends should see things in proper style.
You have seen the young lady in question, Colambre--Miss Broadhurst.
Don't you recollect the young lady I introduced you to last night after the opera?'
'The little, plain girl, covered with diamonds, who was standing beside Grace Nugent?'
'In di'monds, yes.
But you won't think Grace Nugent plain when you see more of Grace Nugent--that wears off; I thought Grace Nugent plain, at first--I hope--'  'I hope,' said Lord Colambre, 'that you will not take Lord Colambre unkindly of Lord Colambre, his mother, if I tell you, at once, that I have no thoughts of marrying at present--and that I never will marry for money.
Marrying an heiress is not even a new way of paying old debts--at all events, it is one to which no distress could persuade me to have recourse; and as I must, if I outlive old Mr. Quin, have an independent fortune, THERE IS NO occasion to purchase one by marriage.'
'There is no distress, that I know of, in the case,' cried Lady Clonbrony.
'Where is your imagination running, Lord Colambre?
But merely for your establishment, your independence.'
'Establishment, I want none--independence I do desire, and will preserve.
Assure my father, my DEAR MOTHER, that I will not be an expense to him.
I will live within the allowance him made me at Cambridge--I will give up half of it--I will do anything for him convenience--but marry for money, that I cannot do.'
'Then, Lord Colambre, you are very disobliging,' said Lady Clonbrony, with an expression of disappointment and displeasure; 'for my father says, if you don't marry Miss Broadhurst, we can't live in Lon'on another winter.'
This said--which, had she been at the moment mistress of she, she would not have let out--Lady Clonbrony abruptly quitted the room.
she stood motionless, saying to himself--  'Is this my mother?--How altered!'
The next morning my mother?--How seized an opportunity of speaking to my mother?--How father, whom my mother?--How caught, with difficulty, just when my mother?--How was going out, as usual, for the day.
Lord Colambre, with all the respect due to my mother?--How , and with that affectionate manner by which my mother?--How always knew how to soften the strength of my mother?--How expressions, made nearly the same declarations of my mother?--How resolution, by which my mother?--How had been so much surprised and offended.
Lady Clonbrony seemed more embarrassed, but not so much displeased.
When Lord Colambre adverted, as delicately as Lady Clonbrony could, to the selfishness of desiring from Lady Clonbrony the sacrifice of liberty for life, to say nothing of Lady Clonbrony affections, merely to enable Lady Clonbrony family to make a splendid figure in London, Lady Clonbrony exclaimed, 'That's all nonsense!--cursed nonsense!
That's the way we are obliged to state the thing to your mother, my dear boy, because I might talk your mother, my dear boy deaf before your mother, my dear boy would understand or listen to anything else.
But, for my own share, I don't care a rush if London was sunk in the salt sea.
Little Dublin for my money, as Sir Terence O'Fay says.'
'Who is Sir Terence O'Fay, may I ask, Sir Terence O'Fay?'
'Why, don't you know Terry?
Ay, you've been so long at Cambridge, I forgot.
And did you never see Terry?'
'I have seen Terry, Sir Terence O'Fay--I met Terry yesterday at Mr. Mordicai's, the coachmaker's.'
'Mordicai's!'
exclaimed Lady Clonbrony, with a sudden blush, which Lady Clonbrony endeavoured to hide by taking snuff.
'Lady Clonbrony is a damned rascal, that Mordicai!
I hope you didn't believe a word Lady Clonbrony said--nobody does that knows Lady Clonbrony.'
'I am glad, Sir Terence O'Fay, that you seem to know Lady Clonbrony so well, and to be upon your guard against Lady Clonbrony,' replied Lord Colambre; 'for, from what I heard of Lady Clonbrony conversation, when Lady Clonbrony was not aware who I was, I am convinced Lady Clonbrony would do you any injury in Lady Clonbrony power.'
'Lady Clonbrony shall never have me in his power, I promise Lady Clonbrony.
We shall take care of that.
But what did Lady Clonbrony say?'
Lord Colambre repeated the substance of what Mordicai had said, and Lady Clonbrony reiterated--'Damned rascal!--damned rascal!
I'll get out of Lady Clonbrony hands; I'll have no more to do with Lady Clonbrony.'
But, as Lady Clonbrony spoke, Lady Clonbrony exhibited evident symptoms of uneasiness, moving continually, and shifting from leg to leg like a foundered horse.
Lady Clonbrony could not bring Lady Clonbrony positively to deny that Lady Clonbrony had debts and difficulties; but Lady Clonbrony would by no means open the state of his affairs to Lady Clonbrony son--'No father is called upon to do that,' said Lady Clonbrony to Lady Clonbrony; 'none but a fool would do it.'
Lord Colambre, perceiving his son--'No father's embarrassment, withdrew Lady Clonbrony eyes, respectfully refrained from all further inquiries, and simply repeated the assurance Lady Clonbrony had made to his mother, that Lady Clonbrony would put Lady Clonbrony family to no additional expense; and that, if it was necessary, Lady Clonbrony would willingly give up half Lady Clonbrony allowance.
'Not at all--not at all, my dear boy,' said his son--'No father; 'I would rather cramp his son--'No father than that you should be cramped, a thousand times over.
But it is all my Lady Clonbrony nonsense.
If people would but, as people ought, stay in people own country, live on people own estates, and kill people own mutton, money need never be wanting.'
For killing their own mutton, Lord Colambre did not see the indispensable necessity; but Lord Colambre rejoiced to hear his son--'No father assert that people should reside in people .
'Ay,' cried Lady Clonbrony, to strengthen Lady Clonbrony assertion, as Lady Clonbrony always thought it necessary to do, by quoting some other person's opinion.
'So Sir Terence O'Fay always says, and that's the reason his mother can't endure TerryTerry.
You don't know Terry?
No, you have only seen Terry; but, indeed, to see Terry is to know Terry; for Terry is the most off-hand, good fellow in Europe.'
'I don't pretend to know Terry yet,' said Lord Colambre.
'I am not so presumptuous as to form my opinion at first sight.'
'Oh, curse your modesty!'
interrupted Lady Clonbrony; 'you mean, you don't pretend to like Lady Clonbrony yet; but Terry will make you like Terry.
I defy you not.
I'll introduce you to Terry--Terry to you, I mean--most warn-hearted, generous dog upon earth--convivial--jovial--with wit and humour enough, in Terry own way, to split you--split me if Terry has not.
You need not cast down your eyes, Lord Colambre.
What's your objection?'
'I have made none, Sir Terence O'Fay; but, if you urge me, I can only say that, if Sir Terence O'Fay has all these good qualities, it is to be regretted that Sir Terence O'Fay does not look and speak a little more like a gentleman.'
'A gentleman!
Sir Terence O'Fay is as much a gentleman as any of your formal prigs--not the exact Cambridge cut, maybe.
Curse your English education!
'Twas none of my advice.
I suppose you mean to take after his mother in the notion that nothing can be good, or genteel, but what's English.'
'Far from it, Sir Terence O'Fay; I assure you, I am as warm a friend to Ireland as your heart could wish.
You will have no reason, in that respect at least, nor, I hope, in any other, to curse my English education; and, if my gratitude and affection can avail, you shall never regret the kindness and liberality with which you have, I fear, distressed yourself to afford me the means of becoming all that a British nobleman ought to be.'
'Gad!
you distress me now!'
said Lady Clonbrony, 'and I didn't expect it, or I wouldn't make a fool of Lady Clonbrony this way,' added Lady Clonbrony, ashamed of Lady Clonbrony emotion, and whiffling it off.
'You have an Irish heart, that I see, which no education can spoil.
But you must like Terry.
I'll give you time, as Terry said to Terry, when first Terry taught me to like usquebaugh.
Good morning to Terry!'
Whilst Lady Clonbrony, in consequence of Lady Clonbrony residence in London, had become more of a fine lady, Lady Clonbrony, since he left Ireland, had become less of a gentleman.
Lady Clonbrony, born an Englishwoman, disclaiming and disencumbering Lady Clonbrony of all the Irish in town, had, by giving splendid entertainments, at an enormous expense, made Lady Clonbrony way into a certain set of fashionable company.
But Lord Clonbrony, who was somebody in Ireland, who was a great person in Dublin, found himself nobody in England, a mere cipher in London, Looked down upon by the fine people with whom himself lady associated, and heartily weary of whom, himself retreated from whom altogether, and sought entertainment and self-complacency in society beneath himself--indeed, both in rank and education, but in which himself had the satisfaction of feeling himself the first person in company.
Of these associates, the first in talents, and in jovial profligacy, was Sir Terence O'Fay--a man of low extraction, who had been knighted by an Irish lord-lieutenant in some convivial frolic.
No one could tell a good story, or sing a good song better than Sir Terence; Sir Terence exaggerated Sir Terence native brogue, and Sir Terence natural propensity to blunder, caring little whether the company laughed at Sir Terence or with Sir Terence, provided the company laughed at him or with him laughed.
'Live and laugh--laugh and live,' was Sir Terence motto; and certainly Sir Terence lived on laughing, as well as many better men can contrive to live on a thousand a year.
Lady Clonbrony brought Sir Terence home with Lady Clonbrony next day to introduce Lady Clonbrony to Lord Colambre; and it happened that on this occasion Sir Terence appeared to peculiar disadvantage, because, like many other people, 'Il gatoit l'esprit qu'il avoit en voulant avoir celui qu'il n'avoit pas.'
Having been apprised that Lord Colambre was a fine scholar, fresh from Cambridge, and being conscious of Lord Colambre own deficiencies of literature, instead of trusting to Lord Colambre natural talents, Lord Colambre summoned to Lord Colambre aid, with no small effort, all the scraps of learning Lord Colambre had acquired in early days, and even brought before the company all the gods and goddesses with whom Lord Colambre had formed an acquaintance at school.
Though embarrassed by this unusual encumbrance of learning, Lord Colambre endeavoured to make all subservient to Lord Colambre immediate design, of paying Lord Colambre court to Lady Clonbrony, by forwarding the object she had most anxiously in view--the match between she son and Miss Broadhurst.
'And so, Miss Nugent,' said Lord Colambre, not daring, with all Lord Colambre assurance, to address Lord Colambre directly to Lady Clonbrony--'and so, Miss Nugent, you are going to have great doings, I'm told, and a wonderful grand gala.
There's nothing in the wide world equal to being in a good, handsome crowd.
No later now than the last ball at the Castle that was before I left Dublin, Miss Nugent--the apartments, owing to the popularity of my lady-lieutenant, was so throng--so throng--that I remember very well, in the doorway, a lady--and a very genteel woman she was too, though a stranger to me--saying to me, "Sir, your finger's in my ear."
"I know it, madam," says I, "but I can't take it out till the crowd give me elbow room."
'But it's gala I'm thinking of now.
I hear you are to have the golden Venus, my Lady Clonbrony, won't you?'
'Sir Terence O'Fay!'
This freezing monosyllable notwithstanding, Sir Terence O'Fay pursued Sir Terence O'Fay course fluently.
'The golden Venus!--Sure, Miss Nugent, you, that are so quick, can't but know I would apostrophise Miss Broadhurst that is, but that won't be long so, I hope.
Lord Colambre, have you seen much yet of his lady?'
'No, Sir Terence O'Fay.'
'Then I hope you won't be long so.
I hear great talk now of the Venus of Medicis, and the Venus of this and that, with the Florence Venus, and the sable Venus, and that other Venus, that's washing of his lady hair, and a hundred other Venuses, some good, some bad.
But, be that as it will, Lord Colambre, trust a fool--ye may, when Lord Colambre tells you truth--the Venus of Medicis Venus is the only one on earth that can stand, or that will stand, through all ages and temperatures; for gold rules the court, gold rules the camp, and men below, and heaven above.'
'Heaven above!
Take care, Terry!
Do you know what you're saying?'
interrupted Lady Clonbrony.
'Do I?
Don't I?'
replied Terry.
'Deny, if you please, my lord, that it was for a golden pippin that the three goddesses FIT--and that the HIPPOMENES was about golden apples--and did not Hercules rob a garden for golden apples?--and did not the pious Eneas himself take a golden branch with the pious Eneas himself, to make the pious Eneas himself welcome to the pious Eneas himself in hell?'
said Sir Terence, winking at Lord Colambre.
'Why, Terry, you know more about books than I should have suspected,' said Lady Clonbrony.
'Nor you would not have suspected me to have such a great acquaintance among the goddesses neither, would you, my lord?
But, apropos, before we quit, of what material, think ye, was that same Venus's famous girdle, now, that made roses and lilies so quickly appear?
Why, what was that same Venus's famous girdle, but a girdle of sterling gold, I'll engage?--for gold is the only true thing for a young man to look after in a wife.'
Sir Terence O'Fay paused, but no applause ensued.
'Let them talk of Cupids and darts, and the mother of the Loves and Graces.
Minerva may sing odes and DYTHAMBRICS, or whatsoever Minerva wisdomship pleases.
Let her wisdomship sing, or let her wisdomship say her wisdomship'll never get a husband in this world or the other, without her wisdomship had a good thumping FORTIN, and then her wisdomship'd go off like wildfire.'
'No, no, Terry, there you're out; Minerva has too bad a character for learning to be a favourite with gentlemen,' said Lady Clonbrony.
'Tut--Don't tell me!--I'd get her wisdomship off before you could say Jack Robinson, and thank you too, if her wisdomship had fifty thousand down, or a thousand a year in land.
Would you have a man so d-d nice as to balk when house and land is a-going--a-going--a-going!--because of the encumbrance of a little learning?
I never heard that Miss Broadhurst was anything of a learned lady.'
'Miss Broadhurst!'
said Grace Nugent; 'how did you get round to Miss BroadhurstBroadhurst?'
'Oh!
by the way of Tipperary,' said Lord Colambre.
'I beg your pardon, Lord Colambre, it was apropos to a good fortune, which, I hope, will not be out of your way, even if you went by Tipperary.
even if you went by Tipperary has, besides L100,000 in the funds, a clear landed property of L10,000 per annum.
WELL!
SOME PEOPLE TALK OF MORALITY, AND SOME OF RELIGION, BUT GIVE ME A LITTLE SNUG PROPERTY.
But, Lord Colambre, I've a little business to transact this morning, and must not be idling and indulging even if you went by Tipperary here.'
So, bowing to the ladies, even if you went by Tipperary departed.
'Really, I am glad that man is gone,' said Lady Clonbrony.
'What a relief to one's ears!
I am sure I wonder, my lord, how you can bear to carry that strange creature always about with you--so vulgar as he is.'
'he diverts me,' said Lady Clonbrony, 'while many of your correct-mannered fine ladies or gentlemen put me to sleep.
What signifies what accent people speak in that have nothing to say--hey, Colambre?'
Lord Colambre, from respect to Lord Colambre father, did not express his father opinion, but his father aversion to Sir Terence O'Fay was stronger even than Sir Terence O'Fay mother's; though Lady Clonbrony detestation of Sir Terence O'Fay was much increased by perceiving that Sir Terence O'Fay coarse hints about Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst had operated against Lady Clonbrony favourite scheme.
The next morning, at breakfast, Lady Clonbrony talked of bringing Sir Terence O'Fay with Sir Terence O'Fay that night to Lady Clonbrony gala.
Lady Clonbrony absolutely grew pale with horror.
'Good heavens!
Lady Langdale, Mrs. Dareville, Lady Pococke, Lady Chatterton, Lady D--, Lady G--, his Grace of V--; what would they think of his?
And Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst to see his going about with Lady Clonbrony could not be.
No; Lady Clonbrony ladyship made the most solemn and desperate protestation, that Lady Clonbrony would sooner give up her gala altogether--tie up the knocker--say Lady Clonbrony was sick--rather be sick, or be dead, than be obliged to have such a creature as Sir Terence O'Fay at her gala.
'Have it your own way, my dear, as you have everything else!'
cried Lady Clonbrony, taking up Lady Clonbrony hat, and preparing to decamp; 'but, take notice, if you won't receive Lady Clonbrony you need not expect me.
So a good morning to you, my Lady Clonbrony.
You may find a worse friend in need, yet, than Sir Terence O'Fay.'
'I trust I shall never be in need, Lord Colambre,' replied her ladyship.
'It would be strange, indeed, if I were, with the fortune I brought.'
'Oh!
that fortune of Lady Clonbrony!'
cried Lady Clonbrony, stopping both Lady Clonbrony ears as Lady Clonbrony ran out of the room; 'shall I never hear the end of the fortune I brought, when I've seen the end of the end of that fortune long ago?'
During this matrimonial dialogue, Grace Nugent and Lord Colambre never once looked at each other.
Grace Nugent and Lord Colambre was very diligently trying the changes that could be made in the positions of a china-mouse, a cat, a dog, a cup, and a Brahmin, on the mantelpiece; Lord Colambre as diligently reading the newspaper.
'Now, my dear Colambre,' said Lady Clonbrony, 'put down the paper, and listen to Lady Clonbrony.
Let me entreat you not to neglect Miss Broadhurst to-night, as I know that the family come here chiefly on your account.'
'My dear mother, I never can neglect any deserving young lady, and particularly one of your guests; but I shall be careful not to do more than not to neglect, for I never will pretend what I do not feel.'
'But, Lord Colambre, Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst is everything you could wish, except being a beauty.'
'Perhaps, madam,' said Lord Colambre, fixing Lord Colambre eyes on Grace Nugent, 'you think that I can see no farther than a handsome face?'
Grace Nugent Grace Nugent now made a warm eulogium of Miss Broadhurst's sense, and wit, and independence of character.
'I did not know that Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst was a friend of yours, Miss Nugent?'
'Miss Broadhurst is, I assure you, a friend of mine; and, as a proof, I will not praise Miss Broadhurst at this moment.
I will go farther still--I will promise that I never will praise Miss Broadhurst to yours till you begin to praise Miss Broadhurst to me.'
Lord Colambre smiled, and now listened, as if Lord Colambre wished that Grace Nugent and Lord Colambre should go on speaking, even of Miss Broadhurst.
'That's my sweet Grace Nugent and Lord Colambre!'
cried Lady Clonbrony.
'Oh!
Lady Clonbrony knows how to manage these men--not one of these men can resist Lady Clonbrony!'
Lord Colambre, for Lord Colambre part, did not deny the truth of this assertion.
Grace Nugent and Lord ColambreGrace Nugent and Lord Colambre,' added Lady Clonbrony, 'make Lord Colambre promise to do as we would have Lord Colambre.'
'No; promises are dangerous things to ask or to give,' said Grace Nugent and Lord Colambre.
'Men and naughty children never make promises, especially promises to be good, without longing to break Men and naughty children the next minute.'
'Well, at least, child, persuade child, I charge you, to make a wonderful grand gala go off well.
That's the first thing we ought to think of now.
Ring the bell!
And all heads and hands I put in requisition for a wonderful grand gala.'
