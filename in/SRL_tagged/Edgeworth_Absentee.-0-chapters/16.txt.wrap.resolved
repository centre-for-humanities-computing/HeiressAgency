 In what words of polite circumlocution, or of cautious diplomacy, shall we say, or hint, that the deceased ambassador's papers were found in shameful disorder. His excellency's executor, Sir James Brooke, however, was indefatigable in His excellency's executor, Sir James Brooke researches. His excellency's executor, Sir James Brooke and Lord Colambre spent two whole days in looking over portfolios of letters and memorials, and manifestoes, and bundles of paper of the most heterogeneous sorts; some of the most heterogeneous sorts without any docket or direction to lead to a knowledge of the most heterogeneous sorts contents; others written upon in such a manner as to give an erroneous notion of the most heterogeneous sorts nature; so that it was necessary to untie every paper separately. At last, when He and Lord Colambre spent two whole days in looking over portfolios of letters and memorials, and manifestoes, and bundles of paper of the most heterogeneous sorts; some of them without any docket or direction to lead to a knowledge of their contents; others written upon in such a manner as to give an erroneous notion of their nature; so that it was necessary to untie every paper separately had opened, as He and Lord Colambre spent two whole days in looking over portfolios of letters and memorials, and manifestoes, and bundles of paper of the most heterogeneous sorts; some of them without any docket or direction to lead to a knowledge of their contents; others written upon in such a manner as to give an erroneous notion of their nature; so that it was necessary to untie every paper separately thought, every paper, and, wearied and in despair, were just on the point of giving up the search, Lord Colambre spied a bundle of old newspapers at the bottom of a trunk.  'He and Lord Colambre spent two whole days in looking over portfolios of letters and memorials, and manifestoes, and bundles of paper of the most heterogeneous sorts; some of them without any docket or direction to lead to a knowledge of their contents; others written upon in such a manner as to give an erroneous notion of their nature; so that it was necessary to untie every paper separately are only old Vienna Gazettes; I looked at He and Lord Colambre spent two whole days in looking over portfolios of letters and memorials, and manifestoes, and bundles of paper of the most heterogeneous sorts; some of them without any docket or direction to lead to a knowledge of their contents; others written upon in such a manner as to give an erroneous notion of their nature; so that it was necessary to untie every paper separately,' said Sir James.  Lord Colambre, upon this assurance, was going to throw He and Lord Colambre spent two whole days in looking over portfolios of letters and memorials, and manifestoes, and bundles of paper of the most heterogeneous sorts; some of them without any docket or direction to lead to a knowledge of their contents; others written upon in such a manner as to give an erroneous notion of their nature; so that it was necessary to untie every paper separately into the trunk again; but observing that a bundle of old newspapers had not been untied, Lord Colambre opened the trunk, and within-side of the newspapers Lord Colambre found a rough copy of the ambassador's journal, and with the trunk the packet, directed to Ralph Reynolds sen., Esq., Old Court, Suffolk, per favour of his excellency, Earl --, a note on the cover, signed O'Halloran, stating when received by Lord Colambre, and the date of the day when delivered to the ambassador--seals unbroken. Our hero was in such a transport of joy at the sight of this packet, and his friend Sir James Brooke so full of his friend Sir James Brooke congratulations, that they forgot to curse the ambassador's carelessness, which had been the cause of so much evil.  The next thing to be done was to deliver this packet to Ralph Reynolds, Old Court, Suffolk. But when Lord Colambre arrived at Old Court, Suffolk, Lord Colambre found all the gates locked, and no admittance to be had. At last an old woman came out of the porter's lodge, who said Mr. Reynolds was not there, and she could not say where Mr. Reynolds was. After Our hero had opened she heart by the present of half a guinea, she explained, that she 'could not JUSTLY say where Mr. Reynolds was, because that Mr. Reynolds never let anybody of Mr. Reynolds own people know where Mr. Reynolds was any day; Mr. Reynolds had several different houses and places in different parts, and far-off counties, and other shires, as she heard, and by times Mr. Reynolds was at one, and by times at another.' The names of two of the places, Toddrington and Little Wrestham, she knew; but there were others to which she could give no direction. Mr. Reynolds had houses in odd parts of London, too, that Mr. Reynolds let; and sometimes, when the lodgers' time was out, Mr. Reynolds would go, and be never heard of for a month, maybe, in one of the lodgers'. In short, there was no telling or saying where Mr. Reynolds was or would be one day of the week, by where Mr. Reynolds had been the last.'  When Lord Colambre expressed some surprise that an old gentleman, as Lord Colambre conceived Mr. Ralph Reynolds to be, should change places so frequently, she answered, 'That though she master was a deal on the wrong side of seventy, and though, to look at Mr. Reynolds, you'd think Mr. Reynolds was glued to Mr. Reynolds chair, and would fall to pieces if Mr. Reynolds should stir out of it, yet was as alert, and thought no more of going about, than if Mr. Reynolds was as young as the gentleman who was now speaking to she. It was old Mr. Reynolds's delight to come down and surprise Mr. Reynolds people at Mr. Reynolds different places, and see that his people were keeping all tight.'  'What sort of a man is he;--Is a man a miser?' said Lord Colambre.  'a man is a miser, and a man is not a miser,' said she. 'Now a man'd think as much of the waste of a penny as another man would of a hundred pounds, and yet a man would give a hundred pounds easier than another would give a penny, when a man's in the humour. But the humour is very odd, and there's no knowing where to have a man; a man's gross-grained, and more POSITIVER-like than a mule; and a man deafness made a man worse in this, because a man never heard what nobody said, but would say on a man own way--a man was very ODD but not CRACKED--no, a man was as clear-headed, when a man took a thing the right way, as any man could be, and as clever, and could talk as well as any member of Parliament,--and good-natured, and kind-hearted, where a man would take a fancy--but then, maybe, it would be to a dog (a man was remarkable fond of dogs), or a cat, or a rat even, that a man would take a fancy, and think more of 'em than a man would of a Christian. But, Poor gentleman, there's great allowance,' said Poor gentleman, 'to be made for a man, that lost a man son and heir--that would have been heir to all, and a fine youth that a man doted upon. But,' continued the old woman, in whose mind the transitions from GREAT to little, from serious to trivial, were ludicrously abrupt, 'that was no reason why the old gentleman should scold me last time the old gentleman was here, as the old gentleman did, for as long as ever the old gentleman could stand over me, only because I killed a mouse who was eating my cheese; and, before night, the old gentleman beat a boy for stealing a piece of that same cheese; and the old gentleman would never, when down here, let me set a mouse-trap.'  'Well, my good woman,' interrupted Lord Colambre, who was little interested in this affair of the mouse-trap, and nowise curious to learn more of Mr. Reynolds's domestic economy, 'I'll not trouble you any farther, if you can be so good as to tell me the road to Toddrington, or to Little Wickham, I think you call it.'  Little Wickham!' repeated the woman, laughing--' Bless you, sir, where do you come from?--It's Little Wrestham; surely everybody knows, near Lantry; and keep the PIKE till you come to the turn at Rotherford, and then you strike off into the by-road to the left, and then again turn at the ford to the right. But, if you are going to Toddrington, you don't go the road to market, which is at the first turn to the left, and the cross-country road, where there's no quarter, and Toddrington lies--but for Wrestham, you take the road to market.'  It was some time before our hero could persuade the woman to stick to Little Wrestham, or to Toddrington, and not to mix the directions for the different roads together--our hero took patience, for our hero impatience only confused our hero director the more. In process of time, our hero made out, and wrote down, the various turns that our hero was to follow, to reach Little Wrestham; but no human power could get Little Wrestham from Little Wrestham to Toddrington, though Little Wrestham knew the road perfectly well; but Little Wrestham had, for the seventeen last years, been used to go 'the other road,' and all the carriers went that way, and passed the door, and that was all Little Wrestham could certify.  Little Wrestham, after turning to the left and right as often as Little Wrestham directory required, our hero happily reached; but, unhappily, Little Wrestham found no Mr. Reynolds there; only a steward, who gave nearly the same account of Little Wrestham master as had been given by the old woman, and could not guess even where the gentleman might now be. Toddrington was as likely as any place--but Toddrington could not say.  'Perseverance against fortune.' To Toddrington our hero proceeded, through cross-country roads--such roads!--very different from the Irish roads. Waggon ruts, into which the carriage wheels sunk nearly to the nave--and, from time to time, 'sloughs of despond,' through which it seemed impossible to drag, walk, wade, or swim, and all the time with a sulky postillion. 'Oh, how unlike my Larry!' thought Lord Colambre.  At length, in a very narrow lane, going up a hill, said to be two miles of ascent, they overtook a heavy laden waggon, and they were obliged to go step by step behind it, whilst, enjoying the gentleman's impatience much, and the postillion's sulkiness more, the waggoner, in the postillion embroidered frock, walked in state, with the postillion long sceptre in the postillion hand.  The postillion muttered 'curses not loud, but deep.' Deep or loud, no purpose would they have answered; the waggoner's temper was proof against curse in or out of the English language; and from they snail's pace neither DICKENS nor devil, nor any postillion in England, could make the waggoner put the waggoner horses. Lord Colambre jumped out of the chaise, and, walking beside the waggoner, began to talk to the waggoner; and spoke of his horses, his horses bells, his horses trappings; the beauty and strength of the thill-horse--the value of the whole team, which Lord Colambre lordship happening to guess right within ten pounds, and showing, moreover, some skill about road-making and waggon-wheels, and being fortunately of the waggoner's own opinion in the great question about conical and cylindrical rims, Lord Colambre was pleased with the young chap of a gentleman; and, in spite of the chuffiness of Lord Colambre appearance and churlishness of Lord Colambre speech, the waggoner's bosom 'being made of penetrating stuff,' Lord Colambre determined to let the gentleman pass. Accordingly, when half-way up the hill, and the head of the fore-horse came near an open gate, the waggoner, without saying one word or turning the head of the fore-horse, touched the fore-horse with Lord Colambre long whip--and the fore-horse turned in at the gate, and then came--  'Dobbin!--Jeho!' and strange calls and sounds, which all the other horses of the team obeyed; and the waggon turned into the farmyard.  'Now, his master! while I turn, you may pass.'  The covering of the waggon caught in the hedge as the waggon turned in; and as the sacking was drawn back, some of the packages were disturbed--a cheese was just rolling off on the side next Lord Colambre; Lord Colambre stopped a cheese from falling; the direction caught Lord Colambre quick eye--'To Ralph Reynolds, Esq.'--'TODDRINGTON' scratched out; 'Red Lion Square, London,' written in another hand below.  'Now I have found Lord Colambre! And surely I know another hand below!' said Lord Colambre to Lord Colambre, looking more closely at the direction.  the direction was certainly in a handwriting well known to Lord Colambre the direction was Lady Dashfort's.  'That there cheese, that you're looking at so cur'ously,' said the waggoner, has been a great traveller; for it came all the way down from Lon'on, and now it's going all the way up again back, on account of not finding the gentleman at home; and the man that booked it told me as how it came from foreign parts.'  Lord Colambre took down the direction, tossed the waggoner a guinea, wished Lord Colambre good-night, passed, and went on. As soon as Lord Colambre could, Lord Colambre turned into the London road--at the first town, got a place in the mail--reached London--saw Lord Colambre father--went directly to Lord Colambre friend, Count O'Halloran, who was delighted when his father beheld the packet. Lord Colambre was extremely eager to go immediately to old Reynolds, fatigued as Lord Colambre was; for Lord Colambre had travelled night and day, and had scarcely allowed Lord Colambre, mind or body, one moment's repose.  'Heroes must sleep, and lovers too; or Heroes soon will cease to be heroes or lovers!' said the count. 'Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! this night; and to-morrow morning we'll finish the adventure in Red Lion Square, or I will accompany you when and where you will; if necessary, to earth's remotest bounds.'  The next morning Lord Colambre went to breakfast with the count. The count, who was not in love, was not up, for we was half an hour earlier than the time appointed. The old servant Ulick, who had attended his master to England, was very glad to see Lord Colambre again, and, showing Lord Colambre into the breakfast parlour, could not help saying, in defence of his master's punctuality--  'Your clocks, I suppose, Lord Colambre, are half an hour faster than we; his master will be ready to the moment.'  the count soon appeared--breakfast was soon over, and the carriage at the door; for the count sympathised in Lord Colambre young friend's impatience. As they were setting out, the count's large Irish dog pushed out of the house door to follow the count's large Irish dog and the count's large Irish dog would have forbidden the count's large Irish dog, but Lord Colambre begged that Lord Colambre might be permitted to accompany the count's large Irish dog; for Lord Colambre lordship recollected the old woman's having mentioned that Mr. Reynolds was fond of dogs.  they arrived in Red Lion Square, found the house of Mr. Reynolds, and, contrary to the count's prognostics, found the old gentleman up, and they saw the old gentleman in the old gentleman red night-cap at the old gentleman parlour window. After some minutes' running backwards and forwards of a boy in the passage, and two or three peeps taken over the blinds by the old gentleman, some minutes' running backwards and forwards of a boy in the passage, and two or three peeps were admitted.  the old gentleman could not master some minutes' running backwards and forwards of a boy in the passage, and two or three peeps names; so some minutes' running backwards and forwards of a boy in the passage, and two or three peeps were obliged reciprocally to announce themselves--'Count O'Halloran and Lord Colambre.' their names seemed to make no impression on the old gentleman; but the old gentleman deliberately looked at the count and the old gentleman lordship, as if studying WHAT rather than WHO the count and his lordship were. In spite of the red night-cap, and a flowered dressing-gown, Mr. Reynolds looked like a gentleman, an odd gentleman--but still a gentleman.  As Count O'Halloran came into the room, and as Count O'Halloran large dog attempted to follow, the count's voice expressed: 'Say, shall I let Count O'Halloran in, or shut the door?'  'Oh, let Count O'Halloran in, by all means, sir, if you please! I am fond of dogs; and a finer one I never saw; pray, gentlemen, be seated,' said he--a portion of the complacency inspired by the sight of the dog, diffusing he--a portion of the complacency inspired by the sight of the dog, over he manner towards the master of so fine an animal, and even extending to his master's companion, though in an inferior degree. Whilst Mr. Reynolds stroked the dog, the count told Whilst that 'the dog was of a curious breed, now almost extinct--the Irish greyhound, of which only one nobleman in Ireland, it is said, has now a few of the species remaining in Whilst possession--Now, lie down, Hannibal,' said the count. 'Mr. Reynolds, the count have taken the liberty, though strangers, of waiting upon you--'  'I beg your pardon, sir,' interrupted Mr. Reynolds; 'but did I understand you rightly, that a few of the same species are still to be had from one nobleman in Ireland? pray, what is a few of the same species are still to be had from one nobleman in Ireland name?' said a few of the same species are still to be had from one nobleman in Ireland, taking out a few of the same species are still to be had from one nobleman in Ireland pencil.  the count wrote his name for a few of the same species are still to be had from one nobleman in Ireland, but observed, that 'a few of the same species are still to be had from one nobleman in Ireland had asserted only that a few of these dogs remained in the possession of one nobleman in Ireland; a few of the same species are still to be had from one nobleman in Ireland could not answer for it that these dogs were TO BE HAD.'  'Oh, I have ways and means,' said old Reynolds; and, rapping old Reynolds snuff-box, and talking, as it was old Reynolds custom, loud to old Reynolds, 'Lady Dashfort knows all those Irish lords; Lady Dashfort shall get one for old Reynolds--ay! ay!'  Count O'Halloran replied, as if the words had been addressed to him--  'Lady Dashfort is in England.'  'I know Lady Dashfort, sir; Lady Dashfort is in London,' said Mr. Reynolds, hastily. 'What do you know of Lady Dashfort?'  'I know, sir, that Lady Dashfort is not likely to return to Ireland, and that I am; and so is my young friend here; and if the thing can be accomplished, we will get the thing done for sir.'  Lord Colambre joined in this promise, and added that, 'if the dog could be obtained, Lord Colambre would undertake to have Lord Colambre safely sent over to England.'  'Sir--gentlemen! I'm much obliged; that is, when you have done the thing I shall be much obliged. But, maybe, you are only making me civil speeches!'  'Of that, sir,' said the count, smiling with much temper, 'your own sagacity and knowledge of the world must enable you to judge.'  'For my own part, I can only say,' cried Lord Colambre, 'that I am not in the habit of being reproached with saying one thing and meaning another.'  'Hot! I see,' said old Reynolds, nodding, as he looked at Lord Colambre. 'Cool!' added he, nodding at the count. 'But a time for everything; I was hot once--both answers good, for both ages.'  This speech Lord Colombre and the count tacitly agreed to consider as another APART, which Lord Colombre and the count were not to hear, or seem to hear. the count began again on the business of the count visit, as the count saw that Lord Colambre was boiling with impatience, and feared that Lord Colambre should BOIL OVER, and spoil all. The count commenced with--  'Mr. Reynolds, your name sounds to the count like the name of a friend; for I had once a friend of that name; I had once the pleasure (and a very great pleasure it was to the count) to be intimately acquainted abroad, on the Continent, with a very amiable and gallant youth--your son!'  'Take care, sir,' said the old man, starting up from sir chair, and instantly sinking down again--'take care! Don't mention sir to the count--unless you would strike me dead on the spot!'  The convulsed motions of sir fingers and face worked for some moments; whilst the count and Lord Colambre, much shocked and alarmed, stood in silence.  The convulsed motions of his fingers and face ceased; and sir unbuttoned sir waistcoat, as if to relieve some sense of expression; uncovered sir gray hairs; and, after leaning back to rest sir, with sir eyes fixed, and in reverie for a few moments, sir sat upright again in his chair, and exclaimed, as sir looked round--  'Son!--Did not somebody say that word? Who is so cruel to say that word before the count? Nobody has ever spoken of sir to the count--but once, since sir death! Do you know, sir,' said sir, fixing his eyes on Count O'Halloran, and laying sir cold hand on sir, 'do you know where sir was buried, I ask you, sir? do you remember how sir died?'  'Too well! too well!' cried the count, so much affected as to be scarcely able to pronounce the words; 'sir died in my arms; I buried sir the count!'  'Impossible!' cried Mr. Reynolds. 'Why do you say so, sir?' said sir, studying the count's face with a sort of bewildered earnestness. 'Impossible! sir body was sent over to the count in a lead coffin; and I saw His body and I was asked--and I answered, "in the family vault." But the shock is over,' said sir; 'and, gentlemen, if the business of your visit relates to that subject, I trust I am now sufficiently composed to attend to sir. Indeed, I ought to be prepared; for I had reason, for years, to expect the stroke; and yet, when it came, it seemed sudden!--it stunned me--put an end to all my worldly prospects--left me childless, without a single descendant or relation near enough to be dear to the count! I am an insulated being!'  'No, sir, you are not an insulated being,' said Lord Colambreyou have a near relation, who will, who must be dear to Lord Colambre; who will make you amends for all you have lost, all you have suffered--who will bring peace and joy to your heart. You have a grand-daughter.'  'No, sir; I have no grand-daughter,' said old Reynolds, sir face and whole form becoming rigid with the expression of obstinacy. 'Rather have no descendant than be forced to acknowledge an illegitimate child.'  'Lord Colambre, I entreat as a friend--I command you to be patient,' said the count, who saw Lord Colambre indignation suddenly rise.  'So, then, this is the purpose of your visit,' continued old Reynolds; 'and you come from my enemies, from the St. Omars, and you are in a league with my enemies,' continued old Reynolds; 'and all this time it is of my eldest son you have been talking.'  'Yes, sir,' replied the count; 'of Captain Reynolds, who fell in battle, in the Austrian service, about nineteen years ago--a more gallant and amiable youth never lived.'  Pleasure revived through the dull look of obstinacy in the father's eyes.  'my eldest son was, as you say, sir, a gallant, an amiable youth, once and my eldest son was my pride, and I loved my eldest son, too, once but did not you know I had another?'  'No, sir, we did not--we are, you may perceive, totally ignorant of your family and of your affairs we have no connexion whatever or knowledge of any of the St. Omars.'  'I detest the sound of the name,' cried Lord Colambre.  'Oh, good! good!--Well! well! I beg your pardon, gentlemen, a thousand times--I am a hasty, very hasty old man; but I have been harassed, persecuted, hunted by wretches, who got a scent of my gold; often in my rage I longed to throw my treasure-bags to my pursuers, and bid my treasure-bags leave me to die in peace. You have feelings, I see, both of you, gentlemen; excuse me, and bear with my temper.'  'Bear with you! Much enforced, the best tempers will emit a hasty spark,' said the count, looking at Lord Colambre, who was now cool again; and who, with a countenance full of compassion, sat with his eyes fixed upon the poor--no, not the poor, but the unhappy old man.  'Yes, I had another son,' continued ' continued old Reynolds, 'and on another son all my affections concentrated when I lost my eldest, and for another son I desired to preserve the estate which another son mother brought into my family. Since you know nothing of my affairs, let me explain to you; the estate which his mother brought into my family was so settled, that the estate which his mother brought into my family would have gone to the child, even the daughter of my eldest son, if there had been a legitimate child. But I knew there was no marriage, and I held out firm to my opinion. "If there was a marriage," said I, "show me the marriage certificate, and I will acknowledge no marriage, and acknowledge the child;" but they could not, and I knew they could not; and I kept the estate which his mother brought into my family for another son,' cried the old gentleman, with the exultation of successful positiveness again appearing strong in another son physiognomy; but suddenly changing and relaxing, another son countenance fell, and another son added, 'But now I have another son. What use all!--all must go to the heir-at-law, or I must will the heir-at-law to a stranger--a lady of quality, who has just found out the heir-at-law is my relation--God knows how--I'm no genealogist--and sends me Irish cheese and Iceland moss, for my breakfast, and the heir-at-law waiting-gentlewoman to namby-pamby me. Oh, I'm sick of it all--see through it--wish I was blind--wish I had a hiding-place, where flatterers could not find me--pursued, chased--must change my lodgings again to-morrow--will, will--I beg your pardon, gentlemen, again; you were going to tell me, sir, something more of my eldest son; and how I was led away from the subject, I don't know; but I meant only to have assured you that my eldest son memory was dear to me, till I was so tormented about that unfortunate affair of my eldest son pretended marriage, that at length I hated to hear my eldest son named; but the heir-at-law, at last, will triumph over me.'  'No, my good sir, not if you triumph over yourself, and do justice,' cried Lord Colambre; 'if you listen to the truth, which my friend will tell you, and if you will read and believe the confirmation of it, under my eldest son's own hand, in this packet.'  'my eldest son own hand indeed! my eldest son seal unbroken. But how--when where--why was His seal kept so long, and how came His seal into your hands?'  Count O'Halloran told Mr. Reynolds that this packet had been given to Mr. Reynolds by Captain Reynolds on Captain Reynolds deathbed; related the dying acknowledgment which Captain Reynolds had made of Captain Reynolds ; and gave an account of the delivery of the packet to the ambassador, who had promised to transmit this packet faithfully. Lord Colambre told the manner in which Lord Colambre had been mislaid, and at last recovered from among the deceased ambassador's papers. Lord Colambre still gazed at the direction, and re-examined the seals.  'My son's handwriting--my son's seals! But where is the certificate of his pretended marriage?' repeated my son; 'if the certificate of the marriage is withinside of this packet, I have done great IN- but I am convinced it never was a marriage. 'Yet I wish now it could be proved--only, in that case, I have for years done great--'  'Won't you open this packet, sir?' said Lord Colambre. Mr. Reynolds looked up at Mr. Reynolds with a look that said, 'I don't clearly know what interest you have in all this.' But, unable to speak, and Mr. Reynolds hands trembling so that Mr. Reynolds could scarcely break the seals, Mr. Reynolds tore off the cover, laid the deceased ambassador's papers before Mr. Reynolds, sat down, and took breath. Lord Colambre, however impatient, had now too much humanity to hurry the old gentleman; Lord Colambre only ran for the spectacles, which Lord Colambre espied on the chimney-piece, rubbed the spectacles, which he espied on the chimney-piece bright, and held the spectacles, which he espied on the chimney-piece ready. Mr. Reynolds stretched Mr. Reynolds hand out for the spectacles, which he espied on the chimney-piece, put the spectacles, which he espied on the chimney-piece on, and the first paper Mr. Reynolds opened was the certificate of the marriage; Mr. Reynolds read the certificate of the marriage aloud, and, putting the certificate of the marriage down, said--  'Now I acknowledge his pretended marriage. I always said, if there is a marriage there must be a certificate. And you see now there is a certificate I acknowledge his pretended marriage.'  'And now,' cried Lord Colambre, 'I am happy, positively happy. Acknowledge your grand-daughter, sir--acknowledge Miss Nugent.'  'Acknowledge who, sir?'  'Acknowledge Miss ' continued old Reynolds--your grand-daughter; I ask no more--do what you will with your fortune.'  'Oh, now I understand--I begin to understand this young gentleman is in love--but where is my grand-daughter?--how shall I know this young gentleman is my grand-daughter? I have not heard of this young gentleman since this young gentleman was an infant--I forgot this young gentleman existence--I have done this young gentleman great injustice.'  'this young gentleman knows nothing of it, sir,' said Lord Colambre, who now entered into a full explanation of Miss Nugent's history, and of this young gentleman connexion with his family, and of his own attachment to this young gentleman; concluding the whole by assuring Mr. Reynolds that Mr. Reynolds grand-daughter had every virtue under heaven. 'And as to your fortune, sir, I know that his grand-daughter will, as I do, say--'  'No matter what his grand-daughter will say,' interrupted old Reynolds; 'where is his grand-daughter? When I see his grand-daughter, I shall hear what his grand-daughter says. Tell me where his grand-daughter is, let me see his grand-daughter. I long to see whether there is any likeness to his grand-daughter poor father. Where is his grand-daughter? Let me see his grand-daughter immediately.'  'his grand-daughter is one hundred and sixty miles off, sir, at Buxton.'  'Well, my lord, and what is a hundred and sixty miles? I suppose you think I can't stir from his chair, but you are mistaken. I think nothing of a journey of a hundred and sixty miles--I'm ready to set off to-morrow--this instant.'  Lord Colambre said, that Lord Colambre was sure Miss Mr. Reynolds would obey Miss Reynolds grandfather's slightest summons, as it was Miss Reynolds duty to do, and would be with Mr. Reynolds as soon as possible, if this would be more agreeable to Mr. Reynolds. 'I will write to Miss Reynolds instantly,' said Mr. Reynolds lordship, 'if you will commission me.'  'No, Lord Colambre, I do not commission--I will go--I think nothing, I say, of a journey of a hundred and sixty miles--I'll go--and set out to-morrow morning.'  Lord Colambre and the count, perfectly satisfied with the result of their visit, now thought it best to leave ' continued old Reynolds at liberty to rest ' continued old Reynolds, after so many strong and varied feelings. their paid their parting compliments, settled the time for the next day's journey, and were just going to quit the room when Lord Colambre heard in the passage a well-known voice the voice of Mrs. Petito.  'Oh no, my compliments, and my Lady Dashfort's best compliments, and I will call again.'  'No, no,' cried ' continued old Reynolds, pulling ' continued old Reynolds bell; 'I'll have no calling again--I'll be hanged if I do! Let I'll in now, and I'll see I'll--Jack! let in that woman now or never.'  'Lady Dashfort's's gone, sir, out of the street door.'  'After Lady Dashfort's, then--now or never, tell Lady Dashfort's.'  'sir, Lady Dashfort's was in a hackney coach.'  ' continued old Reynolds jumped up, and went to the window ' continued old Reynolds, and, seeing the hackney coachman just turning beckoned at the window, and Mrs. Petito was set down again, and ushered in by Jack, who announced Mrs. Petito as--  'The lady, sir.' The only lady ' continued old Reynolds had seen in that house.  'My dear Mr. Reynolds, I'm so obliged to you for letting me in,' cried Mrs. Petito, adjusting Mrs. Petito shawl in the passage, and speaking in a voice and manner well mimicked after Mrs. Petito betters. 'You are so very good and kind, and I am so much obliged to you.'  'You are not obliged to me, and I am neither good nor kind,' said ' continued old Reynolds.  'You strange man,' said Mrs. Petito, advancing graceful in shawl drapery; but Mrs. Petito stopped short. 'My Lord Colambre and Count O'Halloran, as I hope to be saved!'  'I did not know Mrs. Petito was an acquaintance of yours, gentlemen,' said Mr. Reynolds, smiling shrewdly.  Count O'Halloran was too polite to deny an acquaintance of yours with a lady who challenged it by thus naming Count O'Halloran; but Count O'Halloran had not the slightest recollection of Mrs. Petito, though it seems Count O'Halloran had met Mrs. Petito on the stairs when Count O'Halloran visited Lady Dashfort at Killpatrickstown. Lord Colambre was 'indeed UNDENIABLY AN OLD AQUAINTANCE:' and as soon as Lord Colambre had recovered from Lord Colambre first natural start and vulgar exclamation, Lord Colambre with very easy familiarity hoped 'My Lady Clonbrony, and my lord, and Miss Nugent, and all Lord Colambre friends in the family, were well;' and said, 'Lord Colambre did not know whether Lord Colambre was to congratulate his lordship or not upon Miss Broadhurst, my Lady Berryl's marriage, but Lord Colambre should soon have to hope for Lady Berryl's 's congratulations for another marriage in Lord Colambre present family--lady Isabel to Colonel Heathcock, who has come in for a large portion, and his lordship's congratulations for another marriage in HER present family--lady Isabel to Colonel Heathcock, who has come in for a large portion are buying the wedding clothes--sights of clothes--and the di'monds, this day; and Lady Dashfort and my Lady Isabel sent me especially, sir, to you, Mr. Reynolds, and to tell you, sir, before anybody else; and to hope the cheese COME safe up again at last; and to ask whether the Iceland moss agrees with your chocolate, and is palatable; it's the most DILUENT thing upon the universal earth, and the most TONIC and fashionable--the DUTCHES of Torcaster takes it always for breakfast, and Lady St. James' too is quite a convert, and I hear the Duke of V--takes the Duke of V too.'  'And the devil may take the Duke of V too, for anything that I care,' said ' continued old Reynolds.  'Oh, my dear, dear sir! you are so refractory a patient.'  'I am no patient at all, ma'am, and have no patience either; I am as well as you are, or my Lady Dashfort either, and hope, God willing, long to continue so.'  Mrs. Petito smiled aside at Lord Colambre, to mark Mrs. Petito perception of the man's strangeness. Then, in a cajoling voice, addressing Mrs. Petito to the old gentleman--  'Long, long, I hope, to continue so, if Heaven grants my daily and nightly prayers, and my Lady Dashfort also. So, Mr. Reynolds, if the ladies' prayers are of any avail, you ought to be purely, and I suppose ladies' prayers have the precedency in efficacy. But it was not of prayers and deathbed affairs I came commissioned to treat--not of burials, which Heaven above forbid, but of weddings my diplomacy was to speak; and to premise my Lady Dashfort Lady Dashfort would have come my Lady Dashfort in my Lady Dashfort carriage, but is hurried out of my Lady Dashfort senses, and my Lady Isabel could not in proper modesty; so they sent me as they DOUBLE to hope you, my dear Mr. Reynolds, who is one of the family relations, will honour the wedding with your presence.'  'It would be no honour, and they know that as well as I do,' said the intractable Mr. Reynolds. 'It will be no advantage, either; but that they do not know as well as I do. Mrs. Petito, to save you and your lady all trouble about me in future, please to let my Lady Dashfort Lady Dashfort know that I have just received and read the certificate of my son Captain Reynolds's marriage with Miss St. Omar. I have acknowledged his pretended marriage. Better late than never; and to-morrow morning, God willing, shall set out with this young nobleman for Buxton, where I hope to see, and intend publicly to acknowledge, my grand-daughter--provided she will acknowledge me.'  'CRIMINI!' exclaimed Mrs. Petito, 'what new turns are here! Well, sir, I shall tell my lady of the METAMORPHOSES that have taken place, though by what magic (as I have not the honour to deal in the black art) I can't guess. But, since it seems annoying and inopportune, I shall take my FINALE, and shall thus have a verbal P.P.C.--as you are leaving town, it seems, for Buxton so early in the morning. Lord Colambre, if I see rightly into a millstone, as I hope and believe I do on the present occasion, I have to congratulate your lordship (haven't I?) upon something like a succession, or a windfall, in this DENEWMENT. And I beg you'll make my humble respects acceptable to the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was; and I won't DERROGATE the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was by any other name in the interregnum, as I am persuaded it will only be a temporary name, scarce worth assuming, except for the honour of the public adoption; and that will, I'm confident, be soon exchanged for a viscount's title, or I have no sagacity nor sympathy. I hope I don't (pray don't let me) put you to the blush, Lord Colambre.'  Lord Colambre would not have let the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was, if Lord Colambre could have helped Lord Colambre.  'Count O'Halloran, your most obedient! I had the honour of meeting you at Killpatrickstown,' said Mrs. Petito, backing to the door, and twitching the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was shawl. the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was stumbled, nearly fell down, over the large dog--caught by the door, and recovered the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was. Hannibal rose and shook Hannibal ears. 'Poor fellow! you are of my acquaintance too.' the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was would have stroked Hannibal head; but Hannibal walked off indignant, and so did the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was.  Thus ended certain hopes; for Mrs. Petito had conceived that Mrs. Petito DIPLOMACY might be turned to account; that in Mrs. Petito character of an ambassadress, as Lady Dashfort double, by the aid of Iceland moss in chocolate, flattery properly administered; that, by bearing with all the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was DEAR Mr. Reynolds's ODDNESSES and ROUGHNESES, the ci-devant Miss Grace Nugent that was might in time--that is to say, before he made a new will become he dear Mrs. Petito; or (for stranger things have happened and do happen every day) he dear Mrs. Reynolds! Mrs. Petito, however, was good at a retreat; and Mrs. Petito flattered Mrs. Petito that at least nothing of this underplot had appeared; and at all events Mrs. Petito secured by Mrs. Petito services in this embassy, the long-looked-for object of Mrs. Petito ambition, my Lady Dashfort scarlet velvet gown--'not yet a thread the worse for the wear!' One cordial look at this comforted Mrs. Petito for the loss of Mrs. Petito expected OCTOGENAIRE; and Mrs. Petito proceeded to discomfit Lady Dashfort's, by repeating the message with which strange old Mr. Reynolds had charged Mrs. Petito. So ended all Lady Dashfort hopes of Lady Dashfort fortune.  Since the death of Lady Dashfort youngest son, Mrs. Petito had been indefatigable in Mrs. Petito attentions, and sanguine in Mrs. Petito hopes; the disappointment affected both Mrs. Petito interest and Mrs. Petito pride, as an INTRIGANTE. It was necessary, however, to keep Mrs. Petito feelings to Mrs. Petito; for if Heathcock should hear anything of the matter before the articles were signed, Heathcock might 'be off!'--so Mrs. Petito put Heathcock and Lady Isabel into Mrs. Petito coach directly--drove to Gray's, to make sure at all events of the jewels.  In the meantime Count O'Halloran and Lord Colambre, delighted with the result of him and Lady Isabel visit, took leave of Mr. Reynolds, after having arranged the journey, and appointed the hour for setting off the next day. Lord Colambre proposed to call upon Mr. Reynolds in the evening, and introduce Mr. Reynolds father, Lord Clonbrony; but Mr. Reynolds said--  'No, no! I'm not ceremonious. I have given you proofs enough of that, I think, in the short time we've been already acquainted. Time enough to introduce your father to me when we are in a carriage, going we ; then we can talk, and get acquainted; but merely to come this evening in a hurry, and say, "Lord Clonbrony, Mr. Reynolds;--Mr. Reynolds, Lord Clonbrony," and then bob we two heads at one another, and scrape one foot back, and away!--where's the use of that nonsense at my time of life, or at any time of life? No, no! we have enough to do without that, I daresay.--Good morning to you, Count O'Halloran! I thank you heartily. From the first moment I saw you, I liked you; lucky too that you brought your dog with you! 'Twas Hannibal made me first let you in; I saw Twas Hannibal over the top of the blind.--Hannibal, my good fellow! I'm more obliged to Twas Hannibal than you can guess.'  'So are we all,' said Lord Colambre.  Hannibal was well patted, and then they parted. In returning home they met Sir James Brooke.  'I told you,' said Lady St. James' too, 'I should be in London almost as soon as Lady St. James' too. Have you found ' continued old Reynolds!'  'Just come from ' continued old Reynolds.'  'How does your business prosper! I hope as well as mine.'  A history of all that had passed up to the present moment was given, and hearty congratulations received.  'Where are you going now, Sir James?--cannot you come with us?' said Lord Colambre and the count.  'Impossible,' replied Sir James;--'but, perhaps, you can come with Sir James;--'but--Sir James;--'but going to Gray's, to give some old family diamonds, either to be new set or exchanged. Count O'Halloran, I know you are a judge of these things; pray, come and give me your opinion.'  'Better consult your bride elect!' said the count.  'No; she knows little of the matter--and cares less,' replied Lady St. James' too.  'Not so this bride elect, or I mistake she much,' said the count, as the count passed by the window and saw Lady Isabel, who, with Lady Dashfort, had been holding consultation deep with the jeweller; and Heathcock, playing PERSONNAGE MUET.  Lady Dashfort, who had always, as ' continued old Reynolds ' continued old Reynolds expressed it, 'her head upon her shoulders'--presence of mind where her interests were concerned--ran to the door before the count and Lord Colambre could enter, giving a hand to each--as if her interests had all parted the best friends in the world.  'How do? how do?--Give you joy! give me joy! and all that. But mind! not a word,' said her, laying her finger upon her lips--'not a word before Heathcock of ' continued old Reynolds, or of the best part of the old fool,--his fortune!'  The gentlemen bowed, in sign of submission to her ladyship's commands; and comprehended that her feared Heathcock of old Reynolds might be OFF, if the best part of Heathcock of old Reynolds bride (her fortune, or her EXPECTATIONS) were lowered in value or in prospect.  'How low is her reduced,' whispered Lord Colambre, 'when such a husband is thought a prize--and to be secured by a manoeuvre!' such a husband sighed.  'Spare that generous sigh!' said Sir James Brooke; 'it is wasted.'  Lady Isabel, as they approached, turned from a mirror, at which Lady Isabel was trying on a diamond crescent. Lady Isabel face clouded at sight of Count O'Halloran and Lord Colambre, and grew dark as hatred when Lady Isabel saw Sir James Brooke. Lady Isabel walked away to the farther end of the shop, and asked one of the shopmen the price of a diamond necklace which lay upon the counter.  such a husband said, 'such a husband really did not know; it belonged to my Lady Dashfort; it had just been new set for one of my Lady Dashfort ladyship's daughters, who is going to be married to Sir James Brooke--one of the gentlemen, my lady, who are just come in.'  Then, calling to such a husband master, such a husband asked such a husband the price of the necklace; such a husband named the value, which was considerable.  'I really thought my Lady Dashfort and my Lady Dashfort daughters were vastly too philosophical to think of diamonds,' said Lady Isabel to Lady Isabel mother, with a sort of sentimental sneer in my Lady Dashfort voice and countenance. 'But it is some comfort to Lady Isabel to find, in these pattern-women, philosophy and love do not so wholly engross the heart, that Lady Oranmore and her daughters "feel every vanity in fondness lost."'  ''Twould be difficult, in some cases,' thought many present.  ''Pon honour, di'monds are cursed expensive things, I know!' said Heathcock. 'But, be that as it may,' whispered Heathcock to Lady Isabel, though loud enough to be heard by others, 'I've laid a damned round wager, that no woman's diamonds married this winter, under a countess, in Lon'on, shall eclipse Lady Isabel Heathcock's!--and Mr. Gray here's to be judge.'  Lady Isabel paid for this promise one of Lady Isabel sweetest smiles; with one of those smiles which Lady Isabel had formerly bestowed upon Lord Colambre, and which he had once fancied expressed so much sensibility--such discriminative and delicate application. Our hero felt so much contempt, that Our hero never wasted another sigh of pity for Lady Isabel degradation. Lady Dashfort came up to Lady Dashfort as Lady Dashfort was standing alone; and, whilst the count and Lady St. James' too were settling about the diamonds--  'Lord Colambre,' said Lady Dashfort, in a low voice, 'I know your thoughts, and I could moralise as well as you, if I did not prefer laughing--you are right enough; and so am I, and so is Lady Isabel; Our are all right. For look here: women have not always the liberty of choice, and therefore women can't be expected to have always the power of refusal.'  The mother, satisfied with Lady Dashfort convenient optimism, got into Lady Dashfort carriage with Lady Dashfort daughter, Lady Dashfort daughter's diamonds, and Lady Dashfort precious son-in-law, Lady Dashfort daughter's companion for life.  'The more I see,' said Count O'Halloran to Lord Colambre, as they left the shop, 'the more I find reason to congratulate you upon your escape, my dear lord.'  'I owe it not to my own wit or wisdom,' said Lord Colambre; 'but much to love, and much to friendship,' added Lord Colambre, turning to Sir James Brooke; 'here was the friend who early warned me against the siren's voice; who, before I knew Lady Isabel, told me what I have since found to be true, that,       'Two passions alternately govern Lady Isabel fate--<br />      Lady Isabel business is love, but Lady Isabel pleasure is hate.'<br /> 'That is dreadfully severe, Lady St. James' too,' said Count O'Halloran; 'but I am afraid it is just.'  'I am sure it is just, or I would not have said it,' replied Sir James Brooke. 'For the foibles of the sex, I hope, I have as much indulgence as any man, and for the errors of passion as much pity; but I cannot repress the indignation, the abhorrence I feel against women, cold and vain, who use their wit and their charms only to make others miserable.'  Lord Colambre recollected at this moment Lady Isabel look and voice, when Lady Isabel declared that 'Lady Isabel would let Lady Isabel little finger be cut off to purchase the pleasure of inflicting on Lady de Cresey, for one hour, the torture of jealousy.'  'Perhaps,' continued Sir James Brooke, 'now that I am going to marry into an Irish family, I may feel, with peculiar energy, disapprobation of this mother and daughter on another account; but you, Lord Colambre, will do me the justice to recollect that, before I had any personal interest in the country, I expressed, as a general friend to Ireland, antipathy to those who return the hospitality those who return the hospitality they received from a warm-hearted people received from a warm-hearted people, by publicly setting the example of elegant sentimental hypocrisy, or daring disregard of decorum, by privately endeavouring to destroy the domestic peace of families, on which, at last, public as well as private virtue and happiness depend. I do rejoice, Lord Colambre, to hear you say that I had any share in saving you from the siren; and now, I will never speak of these ladies more. I am sorry you cannot stay in town to see--but why should I be sorry--we shall meet again, I trust, and I shall introduce you; and you, I hope, will introduce me to a very different charmer. Farewell!--you have my warm good wishes wherever you go.'  Lady St. James' too turned off quickly to the street in which my Lady Dashfort lived, and Lord Colambre had not time to tell Lady St. James' too that Lady St. James' too knew and admired Lady St. James' too intended bride. Count O'Halloran promised to do this for Lady St. James' too. 'And now,' said the good count, 'I am to take leave of the good count; and I assure you I do it with so much reluctance that nothing less than positive engagements to stay in town would prevent me from setting off with you to-morrow; but I shall be soon, very soon, at liberty to return to Ireland; and Clonbrony Castle, if you will give me leave, I will see before I see Clonbrony Castle.'  Lord Colambre joyfully thanked Lord Colambre friend for this promise.  'Nay, it is to indulge Lord Colambre. I long to see you happy--long to behold the choice of such a heart as yours. Pray do not steal a march upon Lord Colambre--let me know in time. I will leave everything--even the siege of--for your wedding. But I trust I shall be in time.'  'Assuredly you will, my dear count; if ever that wedding--'  'IF,' repeated my dear count.  'IF,' repeated Lord Colambre. 'Obstacles which, when we last parted, appeared to Lord Colambre invincible, prevented my having ever even attempted to make an impression on the heart of the woman I love; and if you knew the woman I love, count, as well as I do, you would know that the woman I love love could "not unsought be won."'  'Of that I cannot doubt, or the woman I love would not be your choice; but when her love could "not unsought is sought, we have every reason to hope,' said my dear count, smiling, 'that her love could "not unsought may, because it may ought to be won by tried honour and affection. I only require to be left in hope.'  'Well, I leave you hope,' said Lord Colambre; 'Miss Nugent--Miss Reynolds, I should say, has been in the habit of considering a union with Lord Colambre as impossible; her mother early instilled this idea into her mother mind. Miss Nugent thought that duty forbad her mother to think of Lord Colambre; her mother told me so: I have seen it in all her mother conduct and manners. The barriers of habit, the ideas of duty, cannot, ought not, to be thrown down or suddenly changed in a well-regulated female mind. And you, I am sure, know enough of the best female hearts, to be aware that time--'  'Well, well, let this dear good charmer take her mother own time, provided there's none given to affectation, or prudery, or coquetry; and from all these, of course, her mother must be free; and of course I must be content. ADIEU AU REVOIR.'
