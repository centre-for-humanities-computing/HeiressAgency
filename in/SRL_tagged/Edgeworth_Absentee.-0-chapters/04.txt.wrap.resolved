 Lady Clonbrony was taken ill the day after  Lady Clonbrony gala;  Lady Clonbrony had caught cold by standing, when much overheated, in a violent draught of wind, paying  Lady Clonbrony parting compliments to the Duke of V--, who thought  Lady Clonbrony a bore, and wished  Lady Clonbrony in heaven all the time for keeping  Lady Clonbrony horses standing.  Lady Clonbrony ladyship's illness was severe and long;  Lady Clonbrony was confined to  Lady Clonbrony room for some weeks by a rheumatic fever, and an inflammation in  Lady Clonbrony eyes. Every day, when Lord Colambre went to see Lord Colambre mother, Lord Colambre found Miss Nugent in  Lady Clonbrony apartment, and every hour Lord Colambre found fresh reason to admire  Lady Clonbrony. The affectionate tenderness, the indefatigable patience, the strong attachment  Lady Clonbrony showed for  Lady Clonbrony aunt, actually raised  Lady Clonbrony in  Lady Clonbrony son's opinion. Lord Colambre was persuaded  Lady Clonbrony must surely have some good or great qualities, or  Lady Clonbrony could not have excited such strong affection. A few foibles out of the question, such as  Lady Clonbrony love of fine people,  Lady Clonbrony affectation of being English, and other affectations too tedious to mention,  Lady Clonbrony was really a good woman, had good principles, moral and religious, and, selfishness not immediately interfering,  Lady Clonbrony was good-natured; and though  Lady Clonbrony soul and attention were so completely absorbed in the duties of acquaintanceship that  Lady Clonbrony did not know it,  Lady Clonbrony really had affections--affections were concentrated upon a few near relations.  Lady Clonbrony was extremely fond and extremely proud of her son. Next to her son,  Lady Clonbrony was fonder of  Lady Clonbrony niece than of any other creature.  Lady Clonbrony had received her son into  Lady Clonbrony family when  Lady Clonbrony was left an orphan, and deserted by some of  Lady Clonbrony other relations.  Lady Clonbrony had bred  Lady Clonbrony up, and had treated  Lady Clonbrony with constant kindness. This kindness and these obligations had raised the warmest gratitude in Miss Nugent's heart; and it was the strong principle of gratitude which rendered  Lady Clonbrony capable of endurance and exertions seemingly far above  Lady Clonbrony strength.  Lady Clonbrony was not of a robust appearance, though  Lady Clonbrony now underwent extraordinary fatigue.  Lady Clonbrony aunt could scarcely bear that  Lady Clonbrony should leave  Lady Clonbrony for a moment:  Lady Clonbrony could not close  Lady Clonbrony eyes unless Grace sat up with  Lady Clonbrony many hours every night. Night after night  Lady Clonbrony bore this fatigue; and yet, with little sleep or rest,  Lady Clonbrony preserved  Lady Clonbrony health, at least supported  Lady Clonbrony spirits; and every morning, when Lord Colambre came into Lord Colambre mother's room, Lord Colambre saw Miss Nugent look as blooming as if  Lady Clonbrony had enjoyed the most refreshing sleep. The bloom was, as Lord Colambre observed, not permanent; The bloom came and went, with every emotion of  Lady Clonbrony feeling heart; and Lord Colambre soon learned to fancy  Lady Clonbrony almost as handsome when  Lady Clonbrony was pale as when  Lady Clonbrony had a colour. Lord Colambre had thought  Lady Clonbrony beautiful when Lord Colambre beheld  Lady Clonbrony in all the radiance of light, and with all the advantages of dress at the gala, but Lord Colambre found  Lady Clonbrony infinitely more lovely and interesting now, when Lord Colambre saw  Lady Clonbrony in a sick-room--a half-darkened chamber--where often Lord Colambre could but just discern  Lady Clonbrony form, or distinguish  Lady Clonbrony, except by  Lady Clonbrony graceful motion as  Lady Clonbrony passed, or when, but for a moment, a window-curtain drawn aside let the sun shine upon  Lady Clonbrony face, or on the unadorned ringlets of  Lady Clonbrony hair.  Much must be allowed for an inflammation in the eyes, and something for a rheumatic fever; yet it may seem strange that Lady Clonbrony should be so blind and deaf as neither to see nor hear all this time; that, having lived so long in the world, it should never occur to  Lady Clonbrony that it was rather imprudent to have a young lady, not eighteen, nursing  Lady Clonbrony--and such a young lady!--when  Lady Clonbrony son, not one-and-twenty--and such a son!--came to visit  Lady Clonbrony daily. But, so it was. Lady Clonbrony knew nothing of love--Lady Clonbrony had read of nothing of love, indeed, in novels, which sometimes for fashion's sake Lady Clonbrony had looked at, and over which Lady Clonbrony had been obliged to doze; but this was only love in books--love in real life Lady Clonbrony had never met with--in the life Lady Clonbrony led, how should Lady Clonbrony? Lady Clonbrony had heard of its making young people, and old people even, do foolish things; but those were foolish people; and if those were worse than foolish, why it was shocking, and nobody visited those. But Lady Clonbrony had not, for Lady Clonbrony own part, the slightest, notion how people could be brought to this pass, nor how anybody out of Bedlam could prefer to a good house, a decent equipage, and a proper establishment, what is called love in a cottage. As to Colambre, Lady Clonbrony had too good an opinion of Colambre understanding--to say nothing of Colambre duty to Colambre family, Colambre pride, Colambre rank, and Colambre being Lady Clonbrony son--to let such an idea cross Lady Clonbrony imagination. As to Lady Clonbrony niece; in the first place, Lady Clonbrony was her niece, and first cousins should never marry, because first cousins form no new connexions to strengthen the family interest, or raise its consequence. This doctrine Lady Clonbrony ladyship had repeated for years so often and so dogmatically, that Lady Clonbrony conceived her ladyship to be incontrovertible, and of as full force as any law of the land, or as any moral or religious obligation. Lady Clonbrony would as soon have suspected Lady Clonbrony niece of an intention of stealing Lady Clonbrony diamond necklace as of purloining Colambre's heart, or marrying this heir of the house of Clonbrony.  Miss Nugent was so well apprised, and so thoroughly convinced of all this, that Miss Nugent never for one moment allowed Miss Nugent to think of Lord Colambre as a lover. Duty, honour, and gratitude--gratitude, the strong feeling and principle of Miss Nugent mind--forbade her mind; Miss Nugent had so prepared and habituated Miss Nugent to consider him as a person with whom Miss Nugent could not possibly be united that, with perfect ease and simplicity, Miss Nugent behaved towards him exactly as if him was Miss Nugent brother--not in the equivocating sentimental romance style in which ladies talk of treating men as men brothers, whom men are all the time secretly thinking of and endeavouring to please as lovers--not using this phrase as a convenient pretence, a safe mode of securing Miss Nugent from suspicion or scandal, and of enjoying the advantages of confidence and the intimacy of friendship, till the propitious moment, when it should be time to declare or avow THE SECRET OF THE HEART. No; Miss Nugent was quite above all double-dealing; Miss Nugent had no mental reservation--no metaphysical subtleties--but, with plain, unsophisticated morality, in good faith and simple truth, acted as Miss Nugent professed, thought what Miss Nugent said, and was that which Miss Nugent seemed to be.  As soon as Lady Clonbrony was able to see anybody, Miss Nugent niece sent to Mrs. Broadhurst, who was very intimate with the family; her niece used to come frequently, almost every evening, to sit with the invalid. Miss Broadhurst accompanied her niece mother, for her niece did not like to go out with any other chaperon--it was disagreeable to spend her niece time alone at home, and most agreeable to spend it with her niece friend Miss Nugent. In this her niece had no design, no coquetry; Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst had too lofty and independent a spirit to stoop to coquetry: her niece thought that, in their interview at the gala, her niece understood Lord Colambre, and that Lord Colambre understood her niece--that Lord Colambre was not inclined to court her niece for her niece fortune--that her niece would not be content with any suitor who was not a lover. her niece was two or three years older than Lord Colambre, perfectly aware of her niece want of beauty, yet with a just sense of her niece own merit, and of what was becoming and due to the dignity of her niece sex. This, her niece trusted, was visible in her niece manners, and established in Lord Colambre mind; so that her niece ran no risk of being misunderstood by Lord Colambre; and as to what the rest of the world thought, her niece was so well used to hear weekly and daily reports of her niece going to be married to fifty different people, that her niece cared little for what was said on this subject. Indeed, conscious of rectitude, and with an utter contempt for mean and commonplace gossiping, her niece was, for a woman, and a young woman, rather too disdainful of the opinion of the world. Miss Broadhurst, though her niece daughter had fully explained her daughter respecting Lord Colambre, before her daughter began this course of visiting, yet rejoiced that, even on this footing, there should be constant intercourse between her daughter had fully explained herself respecting Lord Colambre, before she began this course of visiting. It was Mrs. Broadhurst's warmest wish that her daughter should obtain rank, and connect her daughter with an ancient family: her daughter was sensible that  Lady Clonbrony's being older than the gentleman might be an obstacle; and very sorry her daughter was to find that her daughter had so imprudently, so unnecessarily, declared her daughter age; but still this little obstacle might be overcome; much greater difficulties in the marriage of inferior heiresses were every day got over, and thought nothing of. Then, as to  Lady Clonbrony's own sentiments, her daughter knew the young lady's own sentiments better than her mother did her mother; her mother understood her mother daughter's pride, that her mother dreaded to be made an object of bargain and sale; but Mrs. Broadhurst, who, with all her mother coarseness of mind, had rather a better notion of love matters than Lady Clonbrony, perceived, through her daughter's horror of being offered to Lord Colambre, through her mother anxiety that nothing approaching to an advance on the part of her mother should be made, that if Lord Colambre should Lord Colambre advance, Lord Colambre would stand a better chance of being accepted than any other of the numerous persons who had yet aspired to the favour of this heiress. The very circumstance of Lord Colambre having paid no court to her mother at first, operated in Lord Colambre favour; for it proved that Lord Colambre was not mercenary, and that, whatever attention Lord Colambre might afterwards show, her mother must be sure would be sincere and disinterested.  'And now, let them but see one another in this easy, intimate kind of way, and you will find, Lady Clonbrony, things will go on of them own accord, all the better for our--minding our cards--and never minding anything else. I remember, when I was young--but let that pass--let the young people see one another, and manage the young people own affairs the young people own way--let the young people be together--that's all I say. Ask half the men you are acquainted with why the young people married, and the young people answer, if the young people speak truth, will be: "Because I met Miss Nugent such-a-one at such a place, and our were continually together." Propinquity! propinquity!--as my father used to say--and my father was married five times, and twice to heiresses.'  In consequence of this plan of leaving things to things, every evening Lady Clonbrony made out Lady Clonbrony own little card-table with Miss Broadhurst, and a Mr. and Miss Pratt, a brother and sister, who were the most obliging, convenient neighbours imaginable. From time to time, as Lady Clonbrony gathered up Lady Clonbrony cards, Lady Clonbrony would direct an inquiring glance to the group of young people at the other table; whilst the more prudent Mrs. Broadhurst sat plump with Lady Clonbrony back to the group of young people at the other table, pursing up Lady Clonbrony lips, and contracting Lady Clonbrony brows in token of deep calculation, looking down impenetrable at Lady Clonbrony cards, never even noticing Lady Clonbrony glances, but inquiring from Lady Clonbrony partner, 'How many the group of young people at the other table were by honours?'  The young party generally consisted of Miss Broadhurst, Lord Colambre, Miss Nugent, and Mr. Salisbury. Mr. Salisbury was a middle-aged gentleman, very agreeable, and well informed; Mr. Salisbury had travelled; had seen a great deal of the world; had lived in the best company; had acquired what is called good TACT; was full of anecdote, not mere gossiping anecdotes that lead to nothing, but anecdotes characteristic of national manners, of human nature in general, or of those illustrious individuals who excite public curiosity and interest. Miss Nugent had seen Miss Nugent always in large companies, where Miss Nugent was admired for Miss Nugent SCAVOIR-VIVRE, and for Miss Nugent entertaining anecdotes, but where Miss Nugent had no opportunity of producing any of the higher powers of Miss Nugent understanding, or showing character. Miss Nugent found that Mr. Salisbury appeared to Miss Nugent quite a different person when conversing with Lord Colambre. Lord Colambre, with that ardent thirst for knowledge which it is always agreeable to gratify, had an air of openness and generosity, a frankness, a warmth of manner, which, with good breeding, but with something beyond it and superior to it established forms, irresistibly won the confidence and attracted the affection of those with whom Lord Colambre conversed. Lord Colambre manners were peculiarly agreeable to a person like Mr. Salisbury, tired of the sameness and egotism of men of the world.  Miss Nugent had seldom till now had the advantage of hearing much conversation on literary subjects. In the life Miss Nugent had been compelled to lead Miss Nugent had acquired accomplishments, had exercised Miss Nugent understanding upon everything that passed before Miss Nugent, and from circumstances had formed Miss Nugent judgment and Miss Nugent taste by observations on real life; but the ample page of knowledge had never been unrolled to Miss Nugent eyes. Miss Nugent had never had opportunities of acquiring literature Miss Nugent, but Miss Nugent admired it in others, particularly in Miss Nugent friend Miss Broadhurst. Miss Broadhurst Miss Broadhurst had received all the advantages of education which money could procure, and had profited by all the advantages of education which money could procure in a manner uncommon among those for whom all the advantages of education which money could procure are purchased in such abundance; Miss Nugent not only had had many masters, and read many books, but had thought of what Miss Nugent read, and had supplied, by the strength and energy of Miss Nugent own mind, what cannot be acquired by the assistance of masters. Miss Nugent, perhaps overvaluing the information that Miss Nugent did not possess, and free from all idea of envy, looked up to her friend Miss Broadhurst as to a superior being, with a sort of enthusiastic admiration; and now, with 'charmed attention,' listened, by turns, to Miss Nugent, to Mr. Salisbury, and to Lord Colambre, whilst they conversed on literary subjects--listened, with a countenance so full of intelligence, of animation so expressive of every good and kind affection, that the gentlemen did not always know what the gentlemen were saying.  'Pray go on,' said Miss Nugent, once, to Mr. Salisbury; 'you stop, perhaps, from politeness to me--from compassion to my ignorance; but, though I am ignorant, you do not tire me, I assure you. Did you ever condescend to read the Arabian tales? Like Mr. Salisbury whose eyes were touched by the magical application from the dervise, I am enabled at once to see the riches of a new world--Oh! how unlike, how superior to that in which I have lived!--the GREAT world, as it is called.'  Lord Colambre brought down a beautiful edition of the Arabian tales, looked for the story to which Miss Nugent had alluded, and showed Lord Colambre to Miss Broadhurst, who was also searching for Lord Colambre in another volume.  Lady Clonbrony, from Lady Clonbrony card-table, saw the young people thus engaged.  'I profess not to understand these things so well as you say you do, my dear Mrs. Broadhurst,' whispered my dear Mrs. Broadhurst; 'but look there now; these things are at these things books! What do you expect can come of that sort of thing? So ill-bred, and downright rude of Lord Colambre, I must give Lord Colambre a hint.'  'No, no, for mercy's sake! my dear Lady Clonbrony, no hints, no hints, no remarks! What would you have!--she reading, and my lord at the back of have!--she chair, leaning over--and allowed, mind, to lean over to read the same thing. Can't be better! Never saw any man yet allowed to come so near have!--she! Now, Lady Clonbrony, not a word, not a look, I beseech.'  'Well, well!--but if they had a little music.'  'My daughter's tired of music. How much do I owe your ladyship now?--three rubbers, I think. Now, though you would not believe it of a young girl,' continued Mrs. Broadhurst, 'I can assure your ladyship, My daughter would often rather go to a book than a ball.'  'Well, now, that's very extraordinary, in the style in which My daughter has been brought up; yet books and all that are so fashionable now, that it's very natural,' said Lady Clonbrony.  About this time, Mr. Berryl, Lord Colambre Cambridge friend, for whom Lord Colambre lordship had fought the battle of the curricle with Mordicai, came to town. Lord Colambre introduced him to Lord Colambre mother, by whom Lord Colambre was graciously received; for Mr. Berryl was a young gentleman of good figure, good address, good family, heir to a good fortune, and in every respect a fit match for Miss Nugent. Lady Clonbrony thought that it would be wise to secure Lady Clonbrony for Lady Clonbrony niece before Lady Clonbrony should make Lady Clonbrony appearance in the London world, where mothers and daughters would soon make Lady Clonbrony feel Lady Clonbrony own consequence. Mr. Berryl, as Lord Colambre intimate friend, was admitted to the private evening parties at Lady Clonbrony, and Mr. Berryl contributed to render them still more agreeable. Mr. Berryl information, Mr. Berryl habits of thinking, and Mr. Berryl views, were all totally different from Mr. Salisbury's; and His information, his habits of thinking, and his views collision continually struck out that sparkling novelty which pleases peculiarly in conversation. Mr. Berryl's education, disposition, and tastes, fitted Mr. Berryl exactly for the station which Mr. Berryl was destined to fill in society--that of a COUNTRY GENTLEMAN; not meaning by that expression a mere eating, drinking, hunting, shooting, ignorant country squire of the old race, which is now nearly extinct; but a cultivated, enlightened, independent English country gentleman--the happiest, perhaps, of human beings. On the comparative felicity of the town and country life; on the dignity, utility, elegance, and interesting nature of utility, elegance, and interesting nature different occupations, and general scheme of passing utility, elegance, and interesting nature time, Mr. Berryl and Mr. Salisbury had one evening a playful, entertaining, and, perhaps, instructive conversation; each party, at the end, remaining, as frequently happens, of the comparative felicity of the town and country life; on the dignity, utility, elegance, and interesting nature of their different occupations, and general scheme of passing their time, Mr. Berryl and Mr. Salisbury had one evening a playful, entertaining, and, perhaps, instructive conversation; each party, at the end, remaining, as frequently happens, of their own opinion own opinion. It was observed that Miss Miss Broadhurst ably and warmly defended Mr. Berryl's side of the question; and in their views, plans, and estimates of life, there appeared a remarkable, and as Lord Colambre thought, a happy coincidence. When she was at last called upon to give she decisive judgment between a town and a country life, she declared that 'if she were condemned to the extremes of either, she should prefer a country life, as much as she should prefer Robinson Crusoe's diary to the journal of the idle man in the SPECTATOR.'  'Lord bless me! Miss Broadhurst, do you hear what My daughter is saying?' cried Lady Clonbrony, who, from the card-table, lent an attentive ear to all that was going forward. 'Is it possible that Miss Broadhurst, with she fortune, and pretensions, and sense, can really be serious in saying she would be content to live in the country?'  'What's that you say, child, about living in the country?' said Miss Broadhurst.  Miss Broadhurst repeated what Miss Broadhurst had said.  'Girls always think so who have lived in town,' said Miss Broadhurst. 'Girls are always dreaming of sheep and sheephooks; but the first winter the country cures Girls; a shepherdess, in winter, is a sad and sorry sort of personage, except at a masquerade.'  'Colambre,' said Lady Clonbrony, 'I am sure Miss Broadhurst's sentiments about town life, and all that, must delight you; for do you know, ma'am, he is always trying to persuade me to give up living in town? Colambre and Miss Broadhurst perfectly agree.'  'Mind your cards, Lady Clonbrony,' interrupted Mrs. Broadhurst, 'in pity to your partner. Mr. Pratt has certainly the patience of Job--your ladyship has revoked twice this hand.'  Lady Clonbrony begged a thousand pardons, fixed Lady Clonbrony eyes and endeavoured to fix Lady Clonbrony mind on the cards; but there was something said at the other end of the room, about an estate in Cambridgeshire, which soon distracted Lady Clonbrony attention again. Mr. Pratt certainly had the patience of JobJob. Mr. Pratt revoked, and lost the game, though they had four by honours.  As soon as Mr. Pratt rose from the card-table, and could speak to Miss Broadhurst apart, Mr. Pratt communicated Mr. Pratt apprehensions.  'Seriously, my dear madam,' said Mr. Pratt, 'I believe I have done very wrong to admit Mr. Berryl just now, though it was on Grace's account I did it was on Grace's account. But, ma'am, I did not know Miss Broadhurst had an estate in Cambridgeshire; their two estates just close to one another, I heard their say. Lord bless me, ma'am! there's the danger of propinquity indeed!'  'No danger, no danger,' persisted Miss Broadhurst. 'I know my girl better than you do, begging your ladyship's pardon. No one thinks less of estates than my girl does.'  'Well, I only know I heard my girl talking of them, and earnestly too.'  'Yes, very likely; but don't you know that girls never think of what them are talking about, or rather never talk of what them are thinking about? And them have always ten times more to say to the man them don't care for, than to the man they don't care them do.'  'Very extraordinary!' said Lady Clonbrony. 'I only hope you are right.'  'I am sure of it,' said Miss Broadhurst. 'Only let things go on, and mind your cards, I beseech you, to-morrow night better than you did to-night; and you will see that things will turn out just as I prophesied. Lord Colambre will come to a point-blank proposal before the end of the week, and will be accepted, or my name's not Broadhurst. Why, in plain English, I am clear my girl likes Lord Colambre; and when that's the case, you know, can you doubt how the thing will end?'  Miss Broadhurst was perfectly right in every point of Miss Broadhurst reasoning but one. From long habit of seeing and considering that such an heiress as My daughter might marry whom My daughter pleased--from constantly seeing that My daughter was the person to decide and to reject--Mrs. Miss Broadhurst had literally taken it for granted that everything was to depend upon My daughter daughter's inclinations: My daughter was not mistaken, in the present case, in opining that the young lady would not be averse to Lord Colambre, if Lord Colambre came to what My daughter called a point-blank proposal. It really never occurred to Miss Broadhurst that any man, whom My daughter was the least inclined to favour, could think of anybody else. Quick-sighted in these affairs as the matron thought the matron, the matron saw but one side of the question: blind and dull of comprehension as the matron thought Lady Clonbrony on this subject, the matron was the matron so completely blinded by the matron own prejudices, as to be incapable of discerning the plain thing that was before the matron eyes; VIDELICET, that Lord Colambre preferred Grace Nugent. Lord Colambre made no proposal before the end of the weekthe week, but Miss Broadhurst attributed to an unexpected occurrence, which prevented things from going on in the train in which they had been proceeding so smoothly. Sir John Berryl, Mr. Berryl's father, was suddenly seized with a dangerous illness. The news was brought to Mr. Berryl one evening whilst Mr. Berryl was at Lady Clonbrony. The circumstances of domestic distress, which afterwards occurred in the family of Mr. Berryl friend, entirely occupied Lord Colambre time and attention. All thoughts of love were suspended, and Mr. Berryl whole mind was given up to the active services of friendship. a dangerous illness spread an alarm among Mr. Berryl creditors which brought to light at once the disorder of Mr. Berryl affairs, of which Mr. Berryl son had no knowledge or suspicion. Mr. Berryl had been a very expensive woman, especially in equipages; and Mordicai, the coachmaker, appeared at this time the foremost and the most inexorable of their creditors. Conscious that the charges in his son account were exorbitant, and that they would not be allowed if examined by a court of justice; that it was a debt which only ignorance and extravagance could have in the first instance incurred, swelled afterwards to an amazing amount by interest, and interest upon interest; Mordicai was impatient to obtain payment whilst Sir John yet lived, or at least to obtain legal security for the whole sum from the heir. Mr. Berryl offered Mr. Berryl bond for the amount of the reasonable charges in his account; but Mordicai Mordicai absolutely refused, declaring that now Mr. Berryl had the power in Mr. Berryl own hands, Mr. Berryl would use Mordicai to obtain the utmost penny of Mr. Berryl debt; that Mr. Berryl would not let the thing slip through Mr. Berryl fingers; that a debtor never yet escaped Mr. Berryl, and never should; that a man's lying upon Mr. Berryl deathbed was no excuse to a creditor; that Mr. Berryl was not a whiffler, to stand upon ceremony about disturbing a gentleman in Mr. Berryl last moments; that Mr. Berryl was not to be cheated out of Mr. Berryl due by such niceties; that Mr. Berryl was prepared to go all lengths the law would allow; for that, as to what people said of Mr. Berryl, Mr. Berryl did not care a doit--'Cover your face with your hands, if you like it, Mr. Berryl; you may be ashamed for Mr. Berryl, but I feel no shame for Mr. Berryl--I am not so weak.' Mordicai's countenance said more than Mordicai words; livid with malice, and with atrocious determination in Mordicai eyes, Mordicai stood. 'Yes, Mordicai,' said Mordicai, 'you may look at Mordicai as you please--it is possible I am in earnest. Consult what you'll do now, behind my back or before my face, it comes to the same thing; for nothing will do but my money or your bond, Mr. Berryl. The arrest is made on the person of your father, luckily made while the breath is still in the body. Yes--start forward to strike me, if you dare--your father, Sir John Berryl, sick or well, is my prisoner.'  Mr. Berryl and Mr. Berryl's sisters, in an agony of grief, rushed into the room.  'It's all useless,' cried Mordicai, turning Mordicai back upon the ladies; 'these tricks upon creditors won't do with Mordicai; I'm used to these scenes; I'm not made of such stuff as you think. Leave a gentleman in peace in Mordicai last moments. No! Mordicai ought not, nor shan't die in peace, if Mordicai don't pay Mordicai debts; and if you are all so mighty sorry, ladies, there's the gentleman you may kneel to; if tenderness is the order of the day, it's for his son to show it, not me. Ay, now, Mr. Berryl,' cried his son, as Mr. Berryl took up the bond to sign the bond, 'you're beginning to know I'm not a fool to be trifled with. Stop your hand, if you choose your hand, Mordicai--it's all the same to Mordicai; the person, or the money, I'll carry with Mordicai out of this house.'  Mr. Beryl signed the bond, and threw the bond to Mr. Beryl.  'There, monster!--quit the house!'  'Monster is not actionable--I wish you had called me rascal,' said Mordicai, grinning a horrible smile; and taking up the bond deliberately, returned the bond to Mr. Berryl. 'This paper is worth nothing to Mr. Berryl, Mordicai--This paper is not witnessed.'  Mr. Berryl hastily left the room, and returned with Lord Colambre. Mordicai changed countenance and grew pale, for a moment, at sight of Lord Colambre.  'Well, Lord Colambre, since it so happens, I am not sorry that you should be witness to This paper,' said, Lord Colambre; 'and indeed not sorry that you should witness the whole proceeding; for I trust I shall be able to explain to you my conduct.'  'I do not come here, Mordicai,' interrupted Lord Colambre, 'to listen to any explanations of your conduct, which I perfectly understand;--I come to witness a bond for my friend Mr. Berryl, if you think proper to extort from my friend Mr. Berryl such a bond.'  'I extort nothing, Lord Colambre. Mr. Berryl, it is quite a voluntary act, take notice, on your part; sign or not, witness or not, as you please, gentlemen,' said Mordicai, sticking Mr. Berryl hands in Mr. Berryl pockets, and recovering Mr. Berryl look of black and fixed determination.  'Witness it, witness it, Lord Colambre,' said Mr. Berryl, looking at Mr. Berryl mother and weeping sisters; 'witness it, quick!'  'Mr. Berryl must just run over Mr. Berryl name again in your presence, Lord Colambre, with a dry pen,' said Mordicai, putting a dry pen into Mr. Berryl's hand.  'No, Mordicai,' said Lord Colambre, 'my friend Mr. Berryl shall never sign Lord Colambre.'  'As you please, my lord--the bond or the body, before I quit this house,' said Mordicai.  'Neither, Mordicai, shall you have; and you quit this house directly.'  'How! how!--my lord, how's this?'  'Mordicai, the arrest you have made is as illegal as it is inhuman.'  'Illegal, my lord!' said Mordicai, startled.  'Illegal, sir. I came into this house at the moment when your bailiff asked and was refused admittance. Afterwards, in the confusion of the family above stairs, your bailiff forced open the house door with an iron bar--I saw your bailiff--I am ready to give evidence of the fact. Now proceed at your peril.'  Mordicai, without reply snatched up your bailiff hat, and walked towards the house door; but Lord Colambre held the house door open--the house door was immediately at the head of the stairs--and Mordicai, seeing Lord Colambre indignant look and proud form, hesitated to pass; for Lord Colambre had always heard that Irishmen are 'quick in the executive part of justice.'  'Pass on, Mordicai,' repeated Lord Colambre, with an air of ineffable contempt; 'I am a gentleman--you have nothing to fear.'  Mordicai ran downstairs; Lord Colambre, before Mordicai went back into the room, waited to see Mordicai and your bailiff out of this house. When Mordicai was fairly at the bottom of the stairs, Mordicai turned, and, white with rage, looked up at Lord Colambre.  'Charity begins at home, Lord Colambre,' said Lord Colambre. 'Look at home--you shall pay for this,' added Lord Colambre, standing half-shielded by the house door, for Lord Colambre moved forward as Lord Colambre spoke the last words; 'and I give you this warning, because I know this warning will be of no use to you--Your most obedient, my lord.'  the house door closed after Mordicai.  'Thank Heaven!' thought Lord Colambre, 'that I did not horsewhip that mean wretch! this warning shall be of use to Lord Colambre. But this warning is not time to think of that yet.'  Lord Colambre turned from Lord Colambre own affairs to those of Lord Colambre friend, to offer all the assistance and consolation in Lord Colambre power. Mr. Berryl died that night. Mr. Berryl daughters, who had lived in the highest style in London, were left totally unprovided for. Mr. Berryl widow had mortgaged His widow jointure. Mr. Berryl had an estate now left to Mr. Berryl, but without any income. Mr. Berryl could not be so dishonest as to refuse to pay Mr. Berryl father's just debts; Mr. Berryl could not let Mr. Berryl mother and sisters starve. The scene of distress to which Lord Colambre was witness in this family made a still greater impression upon Mr. Berryl than had been made by the warning or the threats of Mordicai. The similarity between the circumstances of Mr. Berryl friend's family and of Mr. Berryl own struck Mr. Berryl forcibly.  All this evil had arisen from Mr. Berryl passion for living in London and at watering-places. Mr. Berryl had made Mr. Berryl husband an ABSENTEE--an absentee from her husband home, her husband affairs, her husband duties, and her husband estate. The sea, the Irish Channel, did not, indeed, flow between her husband and his estate; but it was of little importance whether the separation was effected by land or water--the consequences, the negligence, the extravagance, were the same.  Of the few people of his age who are capable of profiting by the experience of others, Lord Colambre was one. 'Experience,' as an elegant writer has observed, 'is an article that may be borrowed with safety, and is often dearly bought.'
