 As Lord Colambre was returning home, Lord Colambre was overtaken by Sir Terence O'Fay.
'Well, my lord,' cried Sir Terence, out of breath, 'you have led me a pretty dance all over the town; here's a letter somewhere down in my safe pocket for you, which has cost me trouble enough.
Phoo!
where is it now?--it's from Miss Nugent,' said Sir Terence, holding up a letter somewhere down in my safe pocket for you, which has cost me trouble enough.
The direction to Grosvenor Square, London, had been scratched out; and it had been re-directed by Sir Terence to Lord Colambre, at Sir James Brooke's, Bart., Brookwood, Huntingdonshire, or elsewhere, with speed.
'But the more haste the worse speed; for away the worse speed went to Brookwood, Huntingdonshire, where I knew, if anywhere, you was to be found; but, as fate and the post would have it, there a letter somewhere down in my safe pocket for you, which has cost me trouble enough went coursing after you, while you were running round, and back and forwards, and everywhere, I understand, to Toddrington and Wrestham, and where not, through all them English places, where there's no cross-post; so I took it for granted that it found it way to the dead-letter office, or was sticking up across a pane in the d--d postmaster's window at Huntingdon, for the whole town to see, and it a love-letter, and some puppy to claim it, under false pretence; and you all the time without it, and it might breed a coolness betwixt you and Miss Nugent.'
'But, my dear Sir Terence, give me a letter somewhere down in my safe pocket for you, which has cost me trouble enough now you have me.'
'Oh, my dear lord, if you knew what a race I have had, missing you here by five minutes, and there by five seconds--but I have you at last, and you have it--and I'm paid this minute for all I liquidated of my substance, by the pleasure I have in seeing you crack the seal and read the seal.
But take care you don't tumble over the orange woman--orange barrows are a great nuisance, when one's studying a letter in the streets of London, or the metropolis.
But never heed; stick to my arm, and I'll guide you, like a blind man, safe through the thick of them.'
Miss Nugent's letter, which Lord Colambre read in spite of the jostling of passengers, and the incessant talking of my dear Sir Terence, was as follows:--  Let me not be the cause of banishing you from your home and your country, where you would do so much good, and make so many happy.
Let me not be the cause of your breaking your promise to your mother; of your disappointing my dear aunt, so cruelly, who has complied with all our wishes, and who sacrifices, to oblige our, your mother favourite tastes.
How could your mother ever be happy in Ireland--how could Clonbrony Castle be a home to your mother, without your mother son?
if you take away all your mother had of amusement and PLEASURE, as it is called, are not you bound to give your mother, in their stead, that domestic happiness, which your mother can enjoy only with you, and by your means?
If, instead of living with your mother, you go into the army, your mother will be in daily, nightly anxiety and alarm about you; and her son will, instead of being a comfort, be a source of torment to your mother.
I will hope that you will do now, as you have always hitherto done, on every occasion where I have seen you act, what is right, and just, and kind.
Come here on the day you promised my aunt you would; before that time I shall be in Cambridgeshire, with my friend Lady Berryl; my aunt is so good as to come to Buxton for my aunt--I shall remain with my aunt, instead of returning to Ireland.
I have explained my reasons to my aunt--Could I have any concealment from my aunt, to whom, from my earliest childhood, I owe everything that kindness and affection could give?
my aunt is satisfied--my aunt consents to my living henceforward with Lady Berryl.
Let me have the pleasure of seeing, by your conduct, that you approve of mine.--Your affectionate cousin and friend, GRACE NUGENT.
This letter, as may be imagined by those who, like him, are capable of feeling honourable and generous conduct, gave our hero exquisite pleasure.
Poor, good-natured Sir Terence O'Fay enjoyed good-natured Sir Terence O'Fay lordship's delight; and forgot good-natured Sir Terence O'Fay so completely, that good-natured Sir Terence O'Fay never even inquired whether Lord Colambre had thought of an affair on which good-natured Sir Terence O'Fay had spoken to good-natured Sir Terence O'Fay some time before, and which materially concerned Sir Terence's interest.
The next morning, when the carriage was at the door, and Sir Terence was just taking leave of Sir Terence friend Lord Clonbrony, and actually in tears, wishing them all manner of happiness, though Sir Terence said there was none left now in London, or the wide world, even, for Sir Terence--Lord Colambre went up to Sir Terence, and said, 'Sir Terence, you have never inquired whether I have done your business?'
'Oh, my dear, I'm not thinking of that now--time enough by the post--I can write after Sir Terence; but my thoughts won't turn for me to business now no matter.'
'your business is done,' replied Lord Colambre.
'Then I wonder how you could think of your business, with all you had upon your mind and heart.
When anything's upon my heart, good morning to my head, it's not worth a lemon.
Good-bye to you, and thank you kindly, and all happiness attend you.'
'Good-bye to you, Sir Terence O'Fay,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'and, since it's so ordered, I must live without Lord Clonbrony.'
'Oh!
you'll live better without Lord Clonbrony!
Lord Clonbrony; I am not a good liver, I know, nor the best of all companions for a nobleman, young or old; and now you'll be rich, and not put to your shifts and your wits, what would I have to do for you?--Sir Terence O'Fay, you know, was only THE POOR NOBLEMAN'S FRIEND, and you'll never want to call upon only THE POOR NOBLEMAN'S FRIEND again, thanks to your jewel, your Pitt's-di'mond of a son there.
So we part here, and depend upon it you're better without Lord Clonbrony--that's all my comfort, or my heart would break.
The carriage is waiting this long time, and this young lover's itching to be off.
God bless you both!--that's my last word.'
They called in Red Lion Square, punctual to the moment, on old Mr. Reynolds, but old Mr. Reynolds window-shutters were shut; old Mr. Reynolds had been seized in the night with a violent fit of the gout, which, as old Mr. Reynolds said, held old Mr. Reynolds fast by the leg.
'But here,' said old Mr. Reynolds, giving Lord Clonbrony a letter, 'here's what will do your business without old Mr. Reynolds.
Take this written acknowledgment I have penned for you, and give my grand-daughter her father's letter to read--my grand-daughter her father's letter to read would touch a heart of stone--touched mine--wish I could drag the mother back out of the mother grave, to do the mother justice--all one now.
You see at last I'm not a suspicious rascal, however, for I don't suspect you of palming a false grand-daughter upon me.'
'Will you,' said Lord Clonbrony, 'give your grand-daughter leave to come up to town to Lord Clonbrony, Lord Clonbrony?
You would satisfy Lord Clonbrony, at least, as to what resemblance the mother may bear to the mother father; old Mr. Reynolds will come instantly, and the mother will nurse you.'
'No, no; I won't have the mother come.
If the mother comes, I won't see the mother--shan't begin by nursing me--not selfish.
As soon as I get rid of this gout, I shall be my own man, and young again, and I'll soon be after Lord Clonbrony across the sea, that shan't stop me; I'll come to--what's the name of your place in Ireland?
and see what likeness I can find to her father in your grand-daughter, that you puffed so finely yesterday.
And let me see whether the mother will wheedle me as finely as Mrs. Petito would.
Don't get ready your marriage settlements, do you hear, till you have seen my will, which I shall sign at--what's the name of your place in Ireland?
Write it down there; there's pen and ink; and leave me, for the twinge is coming, and I shall roar.'
'Will you permit me, Lord Clonbrony, to leave my own servant with Lord Clonbrony to take care of Lord Clonbrony?
I can answer for Lord Clonbrony attention and fidelity.'
'Let me see Lord Clonbrony face, and I'll tell you.'
Lord Colambre's servant was summoned.
'Yes, I like his face.
God bless you!--Leave me.'
Lord Colambre's gave Lord Colambre's servant a charge to bear with Mr. Reynolds's rough manner and temper, and to pay the poor old gentleman every possible attention.
Then our hero proceeded with Mr. Reynolds on Mr. Reynolds journey, and on his journey nothing happened worthy of note.
On Mr. Reynolds first perusal of the letter from Lord Colambre's Lord Colambre's had feared that Lord Colambre's would have left Buxton with Lady Berryl before Lord Colambre's could reach it; but, upon recollection, Lord Colambre's hoped that the few lines Lord Colambre's had written, addressed to Lord Colambre's mother AND Miss Nugent, with the assurance that Lord Colambre's should be with his mother AND Miss Nugent on Wednesday, would be sufficient to show Lord Colambre's that some great change had happened, and consequently sufficient to prevent Lord Colambre's from quitting Lord Colambre's aunt, till Lord Colambre's could know whether such a separation would be necessary.
Lord Colambre's argued wisely, more wisely than Grace had reasoned; for, notwithstanding this note, Lord Colambre's would have left Buxton before Lord Colambre's arrival, but for Lady Berryl strength of mind, and positive determination not to set out with Lord Colambre's till Lord Colambre's should arrive to explain.
In the interval, Grace Grace was, indeed, in an anxious state of suspense; and Grace uncertainty, whether Grace was doing right or wrong, by staying to see Lord Clonbrony, tormented Grace most.
'My dear, you cannot help yourself; be quiet,' said Lady Berryl; 'I will take the whole upon my conscience; and I hope my conscience may never have anything worse to answer for.'
Grace was the first person who, from Grace window, saw Lord Colambre, the instant the carriage drove to the door.
Grace ran to Grace friend Lady Berryl apartment--'He is come!--Now, take me away!'
'Not yet, her friend Lady Berryl!
Lie down upon this sofa, if you please; and keep yourself tranquil, whilst I go and see what you ought to do; and depend upon Grace for a true friend, in whose mind, as in your own, duty is the first object.'
'I depend on yourself entirely,' said Grace, sinking down on this sofa; 'and you see I obey you!'
'Many thanks to yourself for lying down, when you can't stand.'
Lady Berryl went to Lady Clonbrony's apartment; Lady Berryl was met by Sir Arthur.
'Come, my love!
come Lord Clonbrony is arrived.'
'I know Lord Clonbrony; and does Lord Clonbrony go to Ireland?
Speak instantly, that I may tell Grace.'
'You can tell Lady Berryl nothing yet, my love; for we know nothing.
Lord Colambre's will not say a word till you come; but I know, by Lord Colambre's countenance, that Lord Colambre's has good and extraordinary news.'
his countenance, that he has good and extraordinary news passed rapidly along the passage to Lady Clonbrony's room.
'Oh, my dear, dear Lady Berryl, come!
or I shall die with impatience,' cried Lady Clonbrony, in a voice and manner between laughing and crying.
'There, now you have congratulated, are very happy, and very glad, and all that--now, for mercy's sake, sit down, Lady Clonbrony's!
for Heaven's sake, sit down--beside me here--or anywhere!
Now, Lord Colambre's, begin; and tell us all at once!'
But as nothing is so tedious as a twice-told tale, Lord Colambre's narrative need not here be repeated.
Lord Colambre's began with Count O'Halloran's visit, immediately after Lady Clonbrony had left London; and went through the history of the discovery that Captain Reynolds was the husband of Miss St. Omar, and the father of Grace; the dying acknowledgment of Captain Reynolds marriage; the packet delivered by Count O'Halloran to the careless ambassador--how recovered, by the assistance of Captain Reynolds executor, Sir James Brooke; the travels from Wrestham to Toddrington, and thence to Red Lion Square; the interview with old Mr. Reynolds, and its final result; all was related as succinctly as the impatient curiosity of Lord Colambre's auditors could desire.
'Oh, wonder upon wonder!
and joy upon joy!'
cried Lady Clonbrony.
'So Grace Grace is as legitimate as I am, and an heiress after all.
Where is Grace?
where is Grace?
In your room, Lady Berryl?--Oh, Colambre!
why wouldn't you let Grace be by?--Lady Berryl, do you know, Berryl would not let me send for Grace, though Grace was the person of all others most concerned!'
'For that very reason, ma'am; and that Lord Colambre's was quite right, I am sure you must be sensible, when you recollect, that Grace has no idea that Grace is not the daughter of Mr. Nugent; Grace has no suspicion that the breath of blame ever lighted upon Grace mother.
This part of the story cannot be announced to Grace with too much caution; and, indeed, Grace mind has been so much harassed and agitated, and Grace is at present so far from strong, that great delicacy--'  'True!
very true, Lady Berryl,' interrupted Lady Clonbrony; 'and I'll be as delicate as you please about it afterwards; but, in the first and foremost place, I must tell Grace the best part of the story--that Grace's an heiress, madam, never killed anybody!'
So, darting through all opposition, Lady Clonbrony made Lady Clonbrony way into the room where Grace was lying--'Yes, get up!
get up!
my own Grace, and be surprised--well you may!--you are an heiress, after all.'
'Am I, my dear aunt?'
said Grace.
'True, as I'm Lady Clonbrony--and a very great heiress--and no more Colambre's cousin than Lady Berryl here.
So now begin and love Lady Berryl as fast as you please--I give my consent--and here Lady Berryl is.'
Lady Clonbrony turned to Lady Clonbrony son, who just appeared at the door.
'Oh, mother!
what have you done?'
'What have I done?'
cried Lady Clonbrony, following Lady Clonbrony son's eyes:--'Lord bless me!--Grace fainted dead--Lady Berryl?
Oh, what have I done?
Lady Berryl, what shall we do?'
'There!
her colour's coming again,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'come away, Lady Clonbrony, for the present, and so will I--though I long to talk to the darling girl myself; but the darling girl myself is not equal to the present yet.'
When Grace came to the darling girl myself, the darling girl myself first saw Lady Berryl leaning over the darling girl myself, and, raising the darling girl myself a little, the darling girl myself said--  'What has happened?--I don't know yet--I don't know whether I am happy or not.'
Then seeing Lord Colambre's, the darling girl myself sat quite upright.
'You received my letter, cousin, I hope?--Do you go to Ireland with my aunt?'
'Yes; and with you, I hope, my beloved friend,' said Lord Colambre's; 'you once assured me that I had such a share of your esteem and affection, that the idea of my accompanying you to Ireland was not disagreeable to you; you flattered me that I formed part of your agreeable associations with home.'
'Yes--sit down by Grace, won't you, Lady Berryl--but then I considered you as my cousin, Lord Colambre's, and I thought you felt the same towards Grace; but now--'  'But now, GraceGrace,' said Lord Colambre's, kneeling beside Grace, and taking Grace hand, 'no invincible obstacle opposes my passion--no INVINCIBLE obstacle, did I say?
let me hope that I may say no obstacle, but what depends on the change in the nature of your sentiments.
You heard my mother's consent; you saw my mother joy.'
'I scarcely knew what I heard or saw,' said Grace, blushing deeply, 'or what I now see and hear; but of this I feel secure, before I comprehend the mystery, before you explain to Grace the causes of you--change of conduct, that you have never been actuated by caprice, but governed by wise and honourable motives.
As to my going to Ireland, or remaining with Lady Berryl, Grace has heard all the circumstances--Grace is my friend and yours--a better friend cannot be; to Grace I appeal--Grace will decide for Grace what I OUGHT to do; Grace promised to take me from hence instantly, if I ought to go.'
'I did; and I would do so without hesitation, if any duty or any prudence required it.
But, after having heard all the circumstances, I can only tell you that I willingly resign the pleasure of your company.'
'But tell Grace, Lady Berryl,' said Lord Colambre, 'excellent friend as you are--explain to Grace you can, better than any of us, all that is to be known; let Grace know my whole conduct, and then let Grace decide for Grace, and I shall submit to Grace decision.
It is difficult, Grace, to restrain the expression of love, of passion, such as I feel; but I have some power over Grace--you know some power over myself--and this I can promise you, that your affections shall be free as air--that: no wishes of friends, no interference, nothing but your own unbiassed choice will I allow, if my life depended upon my life, to operate in my favour.
Be assured, Grace,' added Grace, smiling as Grace retired, 'you shall have time to know whether you are happy or not.'
The moment Grace had left the room, Grace threw Grace into the arms of Grace friend, and Grace heart, oppressed with various feelings, was relieved by tears--a species of relief to which Grace was not habituated.
'I am happy,' said Grace; 'but what was the INVINCIBLE OBSTACLE?--what was the meaning of my aunt's words?--and what was the cause of her joy?
Explain all this to Grace, my dear friend; for I am still as if I were in a dream.'
With all the delicacy which Lady Clonbrony deemed superfluous Lady Berryl explained.
Nothing could surpass the astonishment of Grace, on first learning that Mr. Nugent was not Grace father.
When Grace was told of the stigma that had been cast on Grace birth; the suspicions, the disgrace, to which my mother had been subjected for so many years--that mother, whom Grace had so loved and respected; who had, with such care, instilled into the mind of Grace daughter the principles of virtue and religion; that mother whom Grace had always seen the example of every virtue Grace taught; on whom her daughter never suspected that the touch of blame, the breath of scandal, could rest--Grace could express Grace sensations only by repeating, in tones of astonishment, pathos, indignation--'My mother!--my mother!--my mother!'
For some time her daughter was incapable of attending to any other idea, or of feeling any other sensations.
When her daughter mind was able to admit the thought, her daughter soothed her daughter, by recalling the expressions of Lord Colambre's love--the struggle by which Lord Colambre's had been agitated, when Lord Colambre's fancied a union with her daughter opposed by an invincible obstacle.
Grace sighed, and acknowledged that, in prudence, it ought to have been an INVINCIBLE obstacle--her daughter admired the firmness of her decision, the honour with which Grace had acted towards her daughter.
One moment her daughter exclaimed, 'Then, if I had been the daughter of a mother who had conducted her daughter ill, Grace never would have trusted me!'
The next moment her daughter recollected, with pleasure, the joy her daughter had just seen in Grace eyes--the affection, the passion, that spoke in every word and look; then dwelt upon the sober certainty, that all obstacles were removed.
'And no duty opposes my loving Grace!
And my aunt wishes it!
my aunt!
And I may think of him.--You, my best friend, would not assure me of this if you were not certain of the truth.--Oh, how can I thank you for all your kindness, and for that best of all kindness, sympathy.
You see, your calmness, your strength of mind supports and tranquillises me.
I would rather have heard all I have just learnt from you than from any other person living.
I could not have borne it from any one else.
No one else knows my mind so perfectly--yet my aunt is very good,--and my dear uncle!
should not I go to him?--But him?--But is not my dear uncle, my dear uncle is not my aunt.
I cannot bring you to think that they are not my relations, and that I am nothing to they.'
'You may be everything to they, Grace,' said Lady Berryl; 'whenever you please, you may be they daughter.'
Grace blushed, and smiled, and sighed, and was consoled.
But then Lady Berryl recollected Lady Berryl new relation.
Mr. Reynolds, Lady Berryl grandfather, whom Lady Berryl had never seen, who had for years disowned Lady Berryl--treated my mother with injustice.
Lady Berryl could scarcely think of Mr. Reynolds, her grandfather, whom she had never seen, who had for years disowned her-- with complaisancy; yet, when Mr. Reynolds, her grandfather, whom she had never seen, who had for years disowned her-- age, Mr. Reynolds, her grandfather, whom she had never seen, who had for years disowned her-- sufferings, Mr. Reynolds, her grandfather, whom she had never seen, who had for years disowned her-- desolate state, were represented, Lady Berryl pitied Mr. Reynolds, her grandfather, whom she had never seen, who had for years disowned her--; and, faithful to Lady Berryl strong sense of duty, would have gone instantly to offer Mr. Reynolds, her grandfather, whom she had never seen, who had for years disowned her-- every assistance and attention in Lady Berryl power.
Lady Berryl assured Lady Berryl that Captain Reynolds had positively forbidden Lady Berryl going to Captain Reynolds; and that Captain Reynolds had assured Lord Colambre's Lord Colambre's would not see Lady Berryl if Lady Berryl went to Lord Colambre's.
After such rapid and varied emotions, Grace Grace desired repose, and my dear friend took care that care should be secured to my dear friend for the remainder of the day.
In the meantime, Lady Clonbrony had kindly and judiciously employed Lady Clonbrony in a discussion about certain velvet furniture, which Grace had painted for the drawing-room at Clonbrony Castle.
In Lady Clonbrony mind, as in some bad paintings, there was no KEEPING; all objects, great and small, were upon the same level.
The moment Lady Clonbrony son entered the room, Lady Clonbrony ladyship exclaimed--  'Everything pleasant at once!
Here's her father tells me, Grace's velvet furniture's all packed; really, Soho's the best man in the world of her father kind, and the cleverest--and so, after all, Lord Colambre's, as I always hoped and prophesied, at last you will marry an heiress.'
'And Terry,' said Lady Clonbrony, 'will win Lady Clonbrony wager from Mordicai.'
'Terry!'
repeated Lady Clonbrony, 'that odious Terry!--I hope, my lord, that he is not to be one of my comforts in Ireland.'
'No, my dear mother; he is much better provided for than we could have expected.
One of her father's first objects was to prevent he from being any encumbrance to you.
we consulted he as to the means of making he happy; and the knight acknowledged that he had long been casting a sheep's eye at a little snug place, that will soon be open, in he native country--the chair of assistant barrister at the sessions.
"assistant barrister!"
said her father; "but, '  'Terry, you have all your life been evading the laws, and very frequently breaking the peace; do you think this has qualified you peculiarly for being a guardian of the laws?"
Sir Terence replied, "Yes, sure; set a thief to catch a thief is no bad maxim.
And did not Mr. Colquhoun, the Scotchman, get Sir Terence made a great justice, by Sir Terence making all the world as wise as Sir Terence, about thieves of all sorts, by land and by water, and in the air too, where Sir Terence detected the mud-larks?--And is not Barrington chief-justice of Botany Bay?"
'her father now began to be seriously alarmed, lest Sir Terence should insist upon her father using her father interest to make her father an assistant barrister.
her father was not aware that five years' practice at the bar was a necessary accomplishment for this office; when, fortunately for all parties, my good friend, Count O'Halloran, helped us out of the difficulty, by starting an idea full of practical justice.
A literary friend of the count's had been for some time promised a lucrative situation under Government; but, unfortunately, her father was a man of so much merit and ability, that a man of so much merit and ability could not find employment for her father at home, and a man of so much merit and ability gave her father a commission, I should rather say a contract, abroad, for supplying the army with Hungarian horses.
Now the gentleman had not the slightest skill in horseflesh; and, as Sir Terence is a complete jockey, the count observed that the gentleman would be the best possible deputy for the gentleman literary friend.
us warranted the gentleman to be a thoroughgoing friend; and I do think the coalition will be well for both parties.
the count has settled it all, and I left Sir Terence comfortably provided for, out of your way, my dear mother, and as happy as Sir Terence could be, when parting from her father.'
Lord Colambre's was assiduous in engaging my dear mother's attention upon any subject which could for the present draw my dear mother thoughts away from my dear mother young friend; but, at every pause in the conversation, my dear mother ladyship repeated, 'So Grace is an heiress, after all--so, after all, they know they are not cousins!
Well!
I prefer Grace, a thousand times over, to any other heiress in England.
No obstacle, no objection.
Grace, a thousand times over have my consent.
I always prophesied Lord Colambre's would marry an heiress; but why not marry directly?'
an heiress ardour and impatience to hurry things forward seemed now likely to retard the accomplishment of an heiress own wishes; and Lord Clonbrony, who understood rather more of the passion of love than Lady Clonbrony ever had felt or understood, saw the agony into which an heiress threw an heiress , and felt for his Grace.
With a degree of delicacy and address of which few would have supposed Lady Clonbrony capable, Lady Clonbrony lordship co-operated with her son in endeavours to keep Lady Clonbrony quiet, and to suppress the hourly thanksgivings of Grace TURNING OUT AN HEIRESS.
On one point, however, Lady Clonbrony vowed Lady Clonbrony would not be overruled--Lady Clonbrony would have a splendid wedding at Clonbrony Castle, such as should become an heir and heiress; and a splendid wedding at Clonbrony Castle, Lady Clonbrony hoped, would be immediately on an heir and heiress return to Ireland; Lady Clonbrony should announce the thing to Lady Clonbrony friends directly on Lady Clonbrony arrival at Clonbrony Castle.
'My dear,' said Lady Clonbrony, 'we must wait, in the first place, the pleasure of old Mr. Reynolds's fit of the gout.'
'Why, that's true, because of his will,' said her ladyship; 'but a will's soon made, is not it?
That can't be much delay.'
'And then there must be settlements,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'they take time.
Lovers, like all the rest of mankind, must submit to the law's delay.
In the meantime, My dear, as these Buxton baths agree with you so well, and as Grace does not seem to be over and above strong for travelling a long journey, and as there are many curious and beautiful scenes of nature here in Derbyshire--Matlock, and the wonders of the Peak, and so on--which the young people would be glad to see together, and may not have another opportunity soon--why not rest ourselves a little?
For another reason, too,' continued his lordship, bringing together as many arguments as his could--for his had often found, that though Lady Clonbrony was a match for any single argument, Lady Clonbrony understanding could be easily overpowered by a number, of whatever sort--'besides, my dear, here's Sir Arthur and Lady Berryl come to Buxton on purpose to meet us; and us owe Sir Arthur and Lady Berryl some compliment, and something more than compliment, I think; so I don't see why us should be in a hurry to leave Sir Arthur and Lady Berryl, or quit Buxtona few weeks sooner or later can't signify--and Clonbrony Castle will be getting all the while into better order for us.
Burke is gone down there; and if us stay here quietly, there will be time for the velvet furniture to get there before us, and to be unpacked, and up in the drawing-room.'
'That's true, Lord Colambre's,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'and there is a great deal of reason in all you say--so I second that motion, as Colambre, I see, subscribes to it.'
They stayed some time in Derbyshire, and every day Lady Clonbrony proposed some pleasant excursion, and contrived that the young people should be left to They, as Mrs. Broadhurst used so strenuously to advise; the recollection of whose authoritative maxims fortunately still operated upon Lady Clonbrony, to the great ease and advantage of the lovers.
Happy as a lover, a friend, a son; happy in the consciousness of having restored a father to respectability, and persuaded a mother to quit the feverish joys of fashion for the pleasures of domestic life; happy in the hope of winning the whole heart of the woman he loved, and whose esteem, he knew, he possessed and deserved; happy in developing every day, every hour, fresh charm in he destined bride--we leave we hero, returning to he .
And we leave he with the reasonable expectation that he will support through life the promise of he early character; that he patriotic views will extend with he power to carry wishes into action; that he attachment to he warm-hearted countrymen will still increase upon further acquaintance; and that he will long diffuse happiness through the wide circle, which is peculiarly subject to the influence and example of a great resident Irish proprietor.
LETTER FROM LARRY TO LARRY BROTHER, PAT BRADY, AT MR. MORDICAI'S, COACHMAKER, LONDON.
HIS BROTHER, PAT BRADY, AT MR, came safe to hand Monday last; and with her father thanks and blessing to HIS BROTHER, PAT BRADY, AT MR, her father commends it to HIS BROTHER, PAT BRADY, AT MR herewith inclosed back again, on account of her father being in no immediate necessity, nor likelihood to want in future, as you shall hear forthwith; but wants you over with all speed, and the note will answer for travelling charges; for we can't enjoy the luck it has pleased God to give we without YEES: put the rest in your pocket, and read it when you've time.
Old Nick's gone, and St. Dennis along with Old Nick, to the place Old Nick come from--praise be to God!
Lord Colambre's has found Lord Colambre's out in Lord Colambre's tricks; and I helped Lord Colambre's to that, through the young lord that I driv, as I informed you in my last, when Lord Colambre's was a Welchman, which was the best turn ever I did, though I did not know it no more than Adam that time.
So Old Nick's turned out of the agency clean and clear; and the day after it was known, there was surprising great joy through his native country; not surprising either, but just what you might, knowing Old Nick, rasonably expect.
Old Nick (that is, old Nick and St. Dennis) would have been burnt that night--I MANE, in EFFIGY, through the town of Clonbrony, but that the new man, Mr. Burke, come down that day too soon to stop it, and said, 'it was not becoming to trample on the fallen,' or something that way, that put an end to it; and though it was a great disappointment to many, and to me in particular, I could not but like the jantleman the better for the jantleman anyhow.
They say, he is a very good jantleman, and as unlike old Old Nick or the saint as can be; and takes no duty fowl, nor glove, nor sealing-money; nor asks duty work nor duty turf.
Well, when I was disappointed of EFFIGY, I comforted myself by making a bonfire of Old Nick's big rick of duty turf, which, by great luck, was out in the road, away from all dwelling-house, or thatch, or yards, to take fire; so no danger in life or objection.
And such another blaze!
I wished you'd seed it--and all the men, women, and children in the town and country, far and near, gathered round it, shouting and dancing like mad!--and it was light as day quite across the bog, as far as Bartley Finnigan's house.
And I heard after, they seen Bartley Finnigan's house from all parts of the three counties, and they thought Bartley Finnigan's house was St. John's Eve in a mistake--or couldn't make out what Bartley Finnigan's house was; but all took Bartley Finnigan's house in good part, for a good sign, and were in great joy.
As for St. Dennis and OULD Nick, an attorney had an attorney foot upon his foot, with an habere a latitat, and three executions hanging over 'em; and there's the end of rogues!
and a great example in his native country.
And--no more about it; for I can't be wasting more ink upon them that don't desarve it at my hands, when I want it for them that do, you shall see.
So some weeks past, and there was great cleaning at Clonbrony Castle, and in the town of Clonbrony; and the new agent's smart and clever; and he had the glaziers, and the painters, and the slaters up and down in the town of Clonbrony wherever wanted; and you wouldn't know the slaters again.
Thinks I, this is no bad sign!
Now, cock up your ears, Pat!
for the great news is coming, and the good.
The master's come home--long life to him!--and family come home yesterday, all entirely!
The OULD lord and the young lord (ay, there's the man, Paddy!
), and my lady, and Miss Nugent.
And I driv Miss Nugent's maid, that maid that was, and another; so I had the luck to be in it along WID 'em, and see all, from first to last.
And first, I must tell you, Lady Clonbrony remembered and noticed me the minute Lady Clonbrony lit at our inn, and condescended to beckon at Lady Clonbrony out of the yard to Lady Clonbrony, and axed me--'Friend Larry,' says Lady Clonbrony, 'did you keep your promise?'
--'My oath again' the whisky, is the whisky?'
says I.
'Lord Colambre's, I surely did,' said I; which was true, as all the country knows I never tasted a drop since.
'And I'm proud to see your honour, my lord, as good as your word too, and back again among our.
So then there was a call for the horses; and no more at that time passed betwix' my young lord and me, but that Lord Colambre's pointed me out to the OULD one, as I went off.
I noticed and thanked Lord Colambre's for the OULD one in my heart, though I did not know all the good was to come of the OULD one.
Well, no more of Lady Clonbrony, for the present.
Ogh, it's I driv 'em well; and we all got to the great gate of the park before sunset, and as fine an evening as ever you see; with the sun shining on the tops of the trees, as the ladies noticed; the leaves changed, but not dropped, though so late in the season.
I believe the leaves knew what they were about, and kept on, on purpose to welcome they; and the birds were singing, and I stopped whistling, that the birds might hear they; but sorrow bit could they hear when they got to the park gate, for there was such a crowd, and such a shout, as you never see--and they had the horses off every carriage entirely, and drew'em home, with, blessings, through the park.
And, God bless 'em!
when they got out, they didn't go shut they up in the great drawing-room, but went straight out to the TIRrass, to satisfy the eyes and hearts that followed they.
My lady LANING on Lord Colambre's, and Miss Grace Nugent that was, the beautifullest angel that ever you set eyes on, with the finest complexion and sweetest of smiles, LANING upon Lord Colambre's's arm, who had Lord Colambre's hat off, bowing to all, and noticing the old tenants as Lord Colambre's passed by name.
Oh, there was great gladness and tears in the midst; for joy I could scarce keep from Lord Colambre's.
After a turn or two upon the TIRrass, Lord Colambre QUIT Lord Colambre mother's arm for a minute, and Lord Colambre come to the edge of the slope, and looked down and through all the crowd for some one.
'Is it the widow O'Neill, my lord?'
says I; 'the widow O'Neill, my lord's yonder, with the spectacles on the widow O'Neill, my lord nose, betwixt the widow O'Neill, my lord son and daughter, as usual.'
Then Lord Colambre's beckoned, and her son and daughter did not know which of the TREE would stir; and then Lord Colambre's gave TREE beckons with Lord Colambre's own finger, and they all TREE came fast enough to the bottom of the slope forenent Lord Colambre's; and Lord Colambre's went down and helped the widow O'Neill, my lord up (Oh, Lord Colambre's's the true jantleman), and brought 'em the TREE up on the TIRrass, to my lady and Miss Nugent; and I was up close after, that I might hear, which wasn't manners, but I couldn't help the TREE.
So what Lord Colambre's said I don't well know, for I could not get near enough, after all.
But I saw My lady smile very kind, and take the widow O'Neill, my lord by the hand, and then Lord ColambreTRODUCED Grace to Miss Nugent, and there was the word NAMESAKE, and something about a check curtains; but, whatever It was, they was all greatly pleased; then Lord Colambre turned and looked for Brian, who had fell back, and took Lady Clonbrony with some commendation to my lord Lady Clonbrony father.
And my lord his father said, which I didn't know till after, that they should have they house and farm at the OULD rent; and at the surprise, the widow O'Neill, my lord dropped down dead; and there was a cry as for ten BERRINGS.
'Be qui'te,' says I, 'the widow O'Neill, my lord's only kilt for joy;' and I went and lift the widow O'Neill, my lord up, for the widow O'Neill, my lord son had no more strength that minute than the child new born; and Grace trembled like a leaf, as white as the sheet, but not long, for his mother came to, and was as well as ever when I brought some water, which Miss Nugent handed to the widow O'Neill, my lord with the widow O'Neill, my lord own hand.
'That was always pretty and good, said the widow O'Neill, my lord, laying the widow O'Neill, my lord hand upon Miss Nugent, 'and kind and good to me and mine.'
That minute there was music from below.
The blind harper, O'Neill, with O'Neill harp, that struck up 'Gracey Nugent.'
And that finished, and Lord Colambre smiling, with the tears standing in Lord Colambre eyes too, and Lord Colambre's quite wiping Lord Colambre's, I ran to the TIRrass brink to bid O'Neill play the TIRrass brink again; but as I run, I thought I heard a voice call Larry.
'Who calls Larry?'
says I.
'Lord Colambre calls you, Larry,' says all at once; and four takes me by the shoulders and spins me round.
'There's my young lord calling you, Larry--run for your life.'
So I run back for your life, and walked respectful, with his hat, when I got near.
'Put on his hat, her father desires his hat, says Lord Colambre.
Lord Colambre's made a sign to that purpose, but was too full to speak.
'Where's her father?'
continues my young lord.--' Lord Colambre's's very ould, Lord Colambre's,' says I.
'I didn't ask you how ould Lord Colambre's was,' says Lord Colambre's; 'but where is he?'
--'He's behind the crowd below, on account of Lord Colambre's infirmities; Lord Colambre's couldn't walk so fast as the rest, Lord Colambre's,' says I; 'but Lord Colambre's heart is with you, if not Lord Colambre's body.
'I must have his body too, so bring Lord Colambre's bodily before us; and this shall be your warrant for so doing,' said Lord Colambre's, joking; for Lord Colambre's knows the NATUR of us, Paddy, and how us love a joke in us hearts, as well as if Lord Colambre's had lived all Lord Colambre's life in Ireland; and by the same token will, for that rason, do what Lord Colambre's pleases with us, and more maybe than a man twice as good, that never would smile on us.
But I'm telling you of her father.
'I've a warrant for you, father,' says I; 'and must have you bodily before the justice, and my lord chief-justice.'
So my lord chief-justice changed colour a bit at first; but my lord chief-justice saw me smile.
'And I've done no sin,' said my lord chief-justice; 'and, Larry, you may lead me now, as you led me all my life.'
And up the slope my lord chief-justice went with me as light as fifteen; and, when us got up, Lord Colambre said, 'I am sorry an old tenant, and a good old tenant, as I hear you were, should have been turned out of your farm.'
'Don't fret, it's no great matter, Lord Colambre's,' said her father.
'I shall be soon out of the way; but if you would be so kind to speak a word for my boy here, and that I could afford, while the life is in me, bring my boy here back out of banishment--'  'Then,' says Lord Colambre, 'I'll give you and your sons three lives, or thirty-one years, from this day, of your farm.
Return to it when you please.'
'And,' added Lord Colambre, 'the flaggers, I hope, will be soon banished.'
Oh, how could I thank Lord Colambre--not a word could I proffer--but I know I clasped my two hands, and prayed for Lord Colambre inwardly.
And her father was dropping down on Lord Colambre knees, but the master would not let Lord Colambre; and OBSARVED, that posture should only be for Lord Colambre God.
And, sure enough, in that posture, when Lord Colambre was out of sight, us did pray for Lord Colambre that night, and will all us days.
But, before us quit Lord Colambre presence, Lord Colambre called me back, and bid me write to my brother, and bring you back, if you've no objections, to your own country.
So come, my dear Pat, and make no delay, for joy's not joy complAte till you're in it--her father sends her father blessing, and Peggy Peggy love.
The family entirely is to settle for good in Ireland, and there was in the castle yard last night a bonfire made by Lord Colambre's's orders of the ould yellow damask furniture, to plase My lady, Lord Colambre's says.
And the drawing-room, the butler was telling me, is new hung; and the chairs with velvet as white as snow, and shaded over with natural flowers, by Miss Nugent.
Oh!
how I hope what I guess will come true, and I've rason to believe it will, for I dreamt in my bed last night it did.
But keep yourself to yourself--that Miss Nugent (who is no more Miss Nugent, they say, but Miss Reynolds, and has a new-found grandfather, and is a big heiress, which she did not want in my eyes, nor in Lord Colambre's, I've a notion will be sometime, and maybe sooner than is expected, Lord Colambre--so haste to the wedding.
And there's another thing: they say the rich ould grandfather's coming over;--and another thing, my dear Pat, you would not be out of the fashion--and you see the fashion's growing the fashion not to be an Absentee.--  Your loving brother,  LARRY BRADY.
