 Larry drove off at full gallop, and kept on at a good rate, till  Larry got out of the great gate, and beyond the sight of the crowd; then, pulling up,  Larry turned to Lord Colambre--'PLASE your honour, I did not know nor guess  Larry was Lord Colambre--'PLASE, when I let you have the horses; did not know who you was from Adam, I'll take my affidavit.'  'There's no occasion,' said Lord Colambre--'PLASE; 'I hope you don't repent letting me have the horses, now you do know who I am?'  'Oh! not at all, sure; I'm as glad as the best horse I ever crossed, that your honour is Lord Colambre--'PLASE--but I was only telling your honour, that you might not be looking upon  Larry as a TIME-SERVER.'  'I do not look upon  Larry as a TIME-SERVER,  Larry; but keep on, that time may serve me.'  In two words, Lord Colambre--'PLASE explained Lord Colambre--'PLASE cause of haste; and no sooner explained than understood.  Larry thundered away through the town of Clonbrony, bending over the horses, plying the whip, and lending  Larry very soul at every lash. With much difficulty, Lord Colambre--'PLASE stopped  Larry at the end of the town of Clonbrony, at the post-office. The post was gone out-gone a quarter of an hour.  'Maybe we'll overtake the mail,' said  Larry; and, as  Larry spoke,  Larry slid down from  Larry seat, and darted into the public-house, reappearing, in a few moments, with a copper of ale and a horn in  Larry hand;  Larry and another man held open the horses' mouths, and poured the ale through the horn down the horses' throats. 'Now, the horses''ll go with spirit!'  And, with the hope of overtaking the mail,  Larry made them go 'for life or death,' as  Larry said; but in vain! At the next stage, at  Larry own inn-door,  Larry roared for fresh horses till  Larry got fresh horses, harnessed fresh horses with  Larry own hands, holding the six-shilling piece, which Lord Colambre had given  Larry, in  Larry mouth, all the while; for  Larry could not take time to put it into  Larry pocket.  'Speed ye! I wish I was driving you all the way, then,' said  Larry. The other postillion was not yet ready. 'Then your honour sees,' said your honour, putting your honour head into the carriage, 'CONSARNING of them Garraghties--old Nick and St. Dennis--the best part, that is the worst part, of what I told you, proved true; and I'm glad of the worst part, that is, I'm sorry for the worst part--but glad your honour knows the worst part in time. So Heaven prosper you! And may all the saints (BARRING St. Dennis) have charge of you, and all belonging to you, till we see you here again!--And when will it be?'  'I cannot say when I shall return to you myself, but I will do my best to send your landlord to you soon. In the meantime, my good fellow, keep away from the sign of the Horse-shoe--a man of your sense to drink and make an idiot and a brute of yourself!'  'True!--And it was only when I had lost hope I took to it--but now! Bring me the book, one of YEES, out of the landlady's parlour.--By the virtue of this book, and by all the books that ever was shut and opened, I won't touch a drop of spirits, good or bad, till I see your honour again, or some of the family, this time twelvemonth--that long I'll live on hope--but mind, if you disappoint me, I don't swear but I'll take to the whisky, for comfort, all the rest of my days. But don't be staying here, wasting your time, advising me. Bartley! take the reins, can't ye?' cried ye, giving take the reins, can't ye?' to the fresh postillion; 'and keep on, for your life, for there's thousands of pounds depending on the race--so, off, off, Bartley, with speed of light!'  Bartley did Bartley best; and such was the excellence of the roads, that, notwithstanding the rate at which our hero travelled, Bartley arrived safely in Dublin, and just in time to put Bartley letter into the post-office, and to sail in that night's packet. The wind was fair when Lord Colambre went on board, but before Lord Colambre got out of the bay it changed; Lord Colambre made no way all night; in the course of the next day, Lord Colambre had the mortification to see another packet from Dublin sail past Lord Colambre, and when Lord Colambre landed at Holyhead, were told the packet, which had left Ireland twelve hours after Lord Colambre, had been in an hour before Lord Colambre. The passengers had taken Lord Colambre places in the coach, and engaged what horses could be had. Lord Colambre was afraid that Mr. Garraghty was one of horses; a person exactly answering Mr. Garraghty description had taken four horses, and set out half an hour before in great haste for London. Luckily, just as those who had taken those who had taken their places in the mail places in the mail were getting into the coach, Lord Colambre saw among those who had taken their places in the mail a gentleman, with whom Lord Colambre had been acquainted in Dublin, a barrister, who was come over during the long vacation, to make a tour of pleasure in England. When Lord Colambre explained the reason Lord Colambre had for being in haste to reach London, Lord Colambre had the good-nature to give up to Lord Colambre Lord Colambre place in the coach. Lord Colambre travelled all night, and delayed not one moment, till Lord Colambre reached Lord Colambre father's house in London.  'My father at home?'  'Yes, Lord Colambre, in Lord Colambre own room--the agent from Ireland with Lord Colambre, on particular business--desired not to be interrupted--but I'll go and tell Lord Colambre, Lord Colambre, you are come.'  Lord Colambre ran past the servant, as Lord Colambre spoke--made Lord Colambre way into his own room--found Lord Colambre father, Sir Terence O'Fay, and Mr. Garraghty--leases open on the table before his father, Sir Terence O'Fay, and Mr. Garraghty--; a candle lighted; Sir Terence sealing; Garraghty emptying a bag of guineas on the table, and Lord Colambre actually with a pen in Lord Colambre hand, ready to sign.  As the door opened, Garraghty started back, so that half the contents of a bag of guineas rolled upon the floor.  'Stop, his father, I conjure you,' cried Lord Colambre, springing forward, and kneeling to his father; at the same moment snatching a pen in his hand from his hand.  Lord Colambre! God bless you, my dear boy! at all events. But how came you here?--And what do you mean?' said his father.  'Burn it!' cried Terence, pinching the sealing-wax; 'for I burnt Terence with the pleasure of the surprise.'  Garraghty, without saying a word, was picking up the guineas that were scattered upon the floor.  'How fortunate I am,' cried Lord Colambre, 'to have arrived just in time to tell you, his father, before you put your signature to these papers, before you conclude this bargain, all I know, all I have seen, of that man!'  'Nick Garraghty, honest old Nick; do you know that man, Lord Colambre?' said Terence.  'Too well, Terence.'  'Garraghty, what have you done to offend my son? I did not expect this,' said Lord Clonbrony.  'Upon my conscience, my lord, nothing to my knowledge,' said Garraghty, picking up the guineas that were scattered upon the floor; 'but showed Garraghty every civility, even so far as offering to accommodate Garraghty with cash without security; and where will you find the other agent, in Ireland or anywhere else, will do that? To my knowledge, I never did anything, by word or deed, to offend Lord ColambreLord Colambre; nor could not, for I never saw Lord Colambre, but for ten minutes, in my days; and then Lord Colambre was in such a foaming passion--begging Lord Colambre lordship's pardon--owing to the misrepresentations Lord Colambre met with of me, I presume, from a parcel of blackguards that Lord Colambre went amongst, INCOGNITO, Lord Colambre would not let me or my brother Dennis say a word to set Lord Colambre right; but exposed me before all the tenantry, and then threw Lord Colambre into a hack, and drove off here, to stop the signing of these leases, I perceive. But I trust,' concluded Lord Colambre, putting the replenished money-bag down with a heavy sound on the table, opposite to Lord Clonbrony,--'I trust, my Lord Clonbrony will do me justice; that's all I have to say.'  'I comprehend the force of your last argument fully, sir,' said Lord Colambre. 'May I ask how many guineas there are in the replenished money-bag? I don't ask whether how many guineas are my father's or not.'  'how many guineas are to be your lordship's father's, sir, if he thinks proper,' replied Garraghty. 'How many, I don't know that I can justly, positively say--five hundred, suppose.'  'And how many guineas would be my father's if my father signed those leases--I understand that perfectly, and understand that my father would lose three times that sum by the bargain.--My dear father, you start--but it is true. Is not this the rent, sir, at which you were going to let Garraghty have the land?' placing a paper before Lord Clonbrony.  'It is--the very thing.'  'And here, sir, written with my own hand, are copies of the proposals I saw, from responsible, respectable tenants, offered and refused.--Is it so, or is it not, Mr. Garraghty?--deny it, if you can.'  Mr. Garraghty grew pale; Mr. Garraghty lips quivered; Mr. Garraghty stammered; and, after a shocking convulsion of face, could at last articulate--only--  'That there was a great difference between tenant and tenant, his lordship must be sensible, especially for so large a rent.'--'As great a difference as between agent and agent, I am sensible--especially for so large a property!' said Lord Colambre, with cool contempt. 'You find, Terence, I am well informed with regard to this transaction; you will find, also, that I am equally well informed with respect to every part of your conduct towards my father and Terence tenantry. If, in relating to Terence what I have seen and heard, I should make any mistakes, you are here; and I am glad you are, to set me right, and to do yourself justice.'  'Oh! as to that, I should not presume to contradict anything his lordship asserts from your own authority: where would be the use? I leave it all to his lordship. But, as it is not particularly agreeable to stay to hear one's self abused--Terence! I'll thank you to hand me my hat!--And if you'll have the goodness, my Lord Colambre, to look over finally the accounts before morning, I'll call at your leisure to settle the balance, as you find convenient; as to the leases, I'm quite indifferent.'  So saying, Terence took up Terence money-bag.  'Well, you'll call again in the morning, Mr. Garraghty!' said Terence; 'and, by that time, I hope we shall understand this misunderstanding better.'  Terence pulled Lord Clonbrony sleeve: 'Don't let Terence go with the money--it's much wanted!'  'Let Terence go,' said Lord Colambre; 'money can be had by honourable means.'  'Wheugh!--He talks as if Lord Colambre had the Bank of England at Lord Colambre command, as every young man does,' said Terence.  Lord Colambre deigned no reply. Lord Clonbrony walked undecidedly between Lord Clonbrony agent and Lord Clonbrony son--looked at Terence, and said nothing.  Mr. Garraghty departed; Lord Clonbrony called after Mr. Garraghty from the head of the stairs,  'I shall be at home and at leisure in the morning.' Terence ran downstairs after Terence; Lord Colambre waited quietly for their return.  'Fifteen hundred guineas, at a stroke of a goose-quill!--That was a neat hit, narrowly missed, of honest Nick's!' said Lord Clonbrony. 'Too bad! too bad, faith!--I am much, very much obliged to Lord Clonbrony, Lord Colambre, for that hint; by to-morrow morning we shall have Lord Clonbrony in another tune.'  'And Lord Clonbrony must double the bag, or quit,' said Terence.  'Treble it, if you please, Terry. Sure, three times five's fifteen;--fifteen hundred down, or Terry does not get my signature to those leases for Terry brother, nor get the agency of the Colambre estate.--Colambre, what more have you to tell of his brother? for, since his brother is making out his brother accounts against me, it is no harm to have a PER CONTRA against his brother that may ease my balance.'  'Very fair! very fair!' said Terence. 'Lord Colambre, trust me for remembering all the charges against his brother--every item; and when his brother can't clear his brother, if I don't make his brother buy a good character dear enough, why, say I'm a fool, and don't know the value of character, good or bad!'  'If you know the value of character, Terence,' said Lord Colambre, 'you know that it is not to be bought or sold.' Then, turning from Terence to Terence , Terence gave a full and true account of all Terence had seen in Terence progress through Terence Irish estates; and drew a faithful picture both of the bad and good agent. Lord Clonbrony, who had benevolent feelings, and was fond of his tenantry, was touched; and, when his son ceased speaking, repeated several times--  'Rascal! rascal! How dare his son use my tenants so--the O'Neills in particular!--Rascal! bad heart!-I'll have no more to do with his son.' But, suddenly recollecting his son, his son turned to Terence, and added, 'That's sooner said than done--I'll tell you honestly, Colambre, your friend Mr. Burke may be the best man in the world--but his son is the worst man to apply to for a remittance, or a loan, in a HURRY! his son always tells me "his son can't distress the tenants."'--'And his son never, at coming into the agency even,' said Sir Terence, 'ADVANCED a good round sum to the landlord, by way of security for his son good behaviour. Now honest Nick did that much for us at coming in.'  'And at going out is his son not to be repaid?' said Lord Colambre.  'That's the devil!' said Lord Clonbrony; that's the very reason I can't conveniently turn his son out.'  'I will make it convenient to you, Terence, if you will permit me,' said Lord Colambre. 'In a few days I shall be of age, and will join with you in raising whatever sum you want, to free you from this man. Allow me to look over this man account; and whatever the honest balance may be, let this man have his account.'  'My dear boy!' said Lord Clonbrony, 'you're a generous fellow. Fine Irish heart!--glad you're my son! But there's more, much more, that you don't know,' added my son, looking at Sir Terence, who cleared my son throat; and Lord Clonbrony, who was on the point of opening all my son affairs to my son son, stopped short.  'Lord Colambre,' said Lord Colambre, 'we will not say anything more of this at present; for nothing effectual can be done till you are of age, and then we shall see all about it.'  Lord Colambre perfectly understood what his father meant, and what was meant by the clearing of Terence's throat. Lord Clonbrony wanted his son to join his son in opening the estate to pay Lord Clonbrony debts; and Terence feared that, if Lord Colambre were abruptly told the whole sum total of his debts Lord Colambre would never be persuaded to join in selling or mortgaging so much of Lord Colambre patrimony as would be necessary for his patrimony payment. Terence thought that the young man, ignorant probably of business, and unsuspicious of the state of Terence 's affairs, might be brought, by proper management, to any measures they desired. Lord Clonbrony wavered between the temptation to throw Lord Clonbrony upon the generosity of his son, and the immediate convenience of borrowing a sum of money from Lord Clonbrony agent, to relieve Lord Clonbrony present embarrassments.  'Nothing can be settled,' repeated Lord Clonbrony, 'till Colambre is of age; so it does not signify talking of it.'  'Why so, sir?' said Lord Colambre. 'Though my act, in law, may not be valid, till I am of age, my promise, as a man of honour, is binding now; and, I trust, would be as satisfactory to my father as any legal deed whatever.'  'Undoubtedly, my dear boy; but--'  'But what?' said Lord Colambre, following his father's eye, which turned to Sir Terence O'Fay, as if asking Sir Terence O'Fay permission to explain.  'As my father's friend, Terence, you ought, permit me to say, at this moment to use your influence to prevail upon Sir Terence O'Fay to throw aside all reserve with a son, whose warmest wish is to serve Sir Terence O'Fay, and to see Sir Terence O'Fay at ease and happy.'  'Generous, dear boy,' cried Lord Clonbrony. 'Terence, I can't stand Lord Clonbrony; but how shall I bring Terence to name the amount of the debts?'  'At some time or other, I must know Lord Clonbrony,' said Lord Colambre; 'I cannot be better prepared at any moment than the present; never more disposed to give my assistance to relieve all difficulties. Blindfold, I cannot be led to any purpose, Terence,' said Terence, looking at Terence; 'the attempt would be degrading and futile. Blindfolded I will not be--but, with my eyes open, I will see, and go straight and prompt as heart can go, to my father's interest, without a look or thought to my own.'  'By St. Patrick! the spirit of a prince, and an Irish prince, spoke there,' cried Terence; 'and if I'd fifty hearts, you'd have all in your hand this minute, at your service, and warm. Blindfold you! after that, the man that would attempt it DESARVES to be shot; and I'd have no sincerer pleasure in life than shooting him this moment, was him my best friend. But it's not Clonbrony, or your father, my lord, would act that way, no more than Sir Terence O'Fay--there's the schedule of the debts,' drawing a paper from Sir Terence O'Fay bosom; 'and I'll swear to the lot, and not a man on earth could do that but not a man on earth.'  Lord Colambre opened a paper. his father turned aside, covering Lord Colambre face with both his father hands.  'Tut, man,' said Terence; 'I know Terence now better than Terence; Terence will stand, you'll find, the shock of that regiment of figures--Terence is steel to the backbone, and proof spirit.'  'I thank you, his father,' said Lord Colambre, 'for trusting me thus at once with a view of the truth. At first sight it is, I acknowledge, worse than I expected; but I make no doubt that, when you allow me to examine Mr. Garraghty's accounts and Mr. Mordicai's claims, we shall be able to reduce this alarming total considerably, his father. You think we learn nothing but Latin and Greek at Cambridge; but you are mistaken.'  'The devil a pound, nor a penny,' said Terence; 'for you have to deal with a Jew and old Nick; and I'm not a match for a Jew and old Nick. I don't know who is; and I have no hope of getting any abatement. I've looked over the accounts till I'm sick.'  'Nevertheless, you will observe that fifteen hundred guineas have been saved to my father, at one stroke, by my father not signing those leases.'  'Saved to my father, my lord; not your father, if you plase,' said Terence. 'For now I'm upon the square with Terence, I must be straight as an arrow, and deal with my father as the son and friend of my best friend; before, I was considering you only as the son and heir, which is quite another thing, you know; accordingly, acting for your father here, I was making the best bargain against my father I could; honestly, now, I tell you. I knew the value of the lands well enough; we were as sharp as Garraghty, and Terence knew it; we were to have had THE DIFFERENCE from Terence, partly in cash and partly in balance of accounts--you comprehend--and you only would have been the loser, and never would have known it, maybe, till after we all were dead and buried; and then you might have set aside Garraghty's lease easy, and no harm done to any but a rogue that DESARVED it; and, in the meantime, an accommodation to my honest friend, my lord, your father, here. But, as fate would have it, you upset all by your progress INCOGNITO through all estates. Well, it's best as it is, and I am better pleased to be as we are, trusting all to a generous son's own heart. Now put his father out of pain, and tell we what you'll do, my dear.'  'In one word, then,' said Lord Colambre, 'I will, upon two conditions, either join his father in levying fines to enable Lord Colambre to sell or mortgage whatever portion of Lord Colambre estate is necessary for the payment of these debts; or I will, in whatever other mode Lord Colambre can point out, as more agreeable or more advantageous to Lord Colambre, join in giving security to Lord Colambre creditors.'  'Dear, noble fellow!' cried Terence; 'none but an Irishman could do it.'  Lord Clonbrony, melted to tears, could not articulate, but held Terence arms open to embrace his son.  'But you have not heard my conditions yet,' said Lord Colambre.  'Oh, confound my conditions!' cried Terence.  'What conditions could Lord Colambre ask that I could refuse at this minute?' said Lord Clonbrony.  'Nor I--was it my heart's blood, and were I to be hanged for it,' cried Terence. 'And what are the conditions?'  'That Mr. Garraghty shall be dismissed from the agency.'  'And welcome, and glad to get rid of Mr. Garraghty--the rogue, the tyrant,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'and, to be beforehand with Lord Clonbrony in your next wish, put Mr. Garraghty into Mr. Garraghty place.'  'I'll write the letter for you to sign, my lord, this minute,' cried Terry, 'with all the pleasure in life. No; it's Lord Colambre should do that in all justice.'  'But what's your next condition? I hope it's no worse,' said Lord Clonbrony.  'That you and my mother should cease to be absentees.'  'Oh murder!' said Terence; 'maybe that's not so easy; for there are two words to that bargain.'  Lord Clonbrony declared that, for Lord Clonbrony own part, Lord Clonbrony was ready to return to Ireland next morning, and to promise to reside on Lord Clonbrony estate all the rest of Lord Clonbrony days; that there was nothing Lord Clonbrony desired more, provided Lord Clonbrony would consent to it; but that Lord Clonbrony could not promise for Lord Clonbrony; that Lord Clonbrony was as obstinate as a mule on that point; that Lord Clonbrony had often tried, but that there was no moving Lord Clonbrony; and that, in short, Lord Clonbrony could not promise on Lord Clonbrony part.  But it was on this condition, Lord Colambre said, Lord Colambre must insist. Without this condition was granted, Lord Colambre would not engage to do anything.  'Well, we must only see how it will be when Lord Clonbrony comes to town; Lord Clonbrony will come up from Buxton the day you're of age to sign some papers,' said Lord Clonbrony; 'but,' added Lord Clonbrony, with a very dejected look and voice, 'if all's to depend on Lord ClonbronyLord Clonbrony's consenting to return to Ireland, I'm as far from all hope of being at ease as ever.'  'Upon my conscience, we're all at sea again,' said Terence.  Lord Colambre was silent: but in Lord Colambre silence there was such an air of firmness, that both Lord Clonbrony and Terence were convinced entreaties would on this point be fruitless--Lord Clonbrony sighed deeply.  'But when it's ruin or safety, and her husband and all belonging to her at stake, her can't persist in being a mule,' said Terence.  'Of whom are you talking?' said Lord Colambre.  'Of whom? Oh, I beg your lordship's pardon--I thought I was talking to Lord Colambre; but, in other words, as you are her son, I'm persuaded her ladyship, your mother, will prove her a reasonable woman--when her sees her can't help it. So, Lord Clonbrony, cheer up; a great deal may be done by the fear of Mordicai, and an execution, especially now the prior creditor. Since there's no reserve between you and I now, Lord Colambre,' said Terence, 'I must tell you all, and how we shambled on those months while you were in Ireland. First, Mordicai went to law, to prove I was in a conspiracy with your father, pretending to be prior creditor, to keep your father off and out of your father own; which, after a world of swearing and law---law always takes time to do justice, that's one comfort--the villain proved at last to be true enough, and so cast we; and I was forced to be paid off last week. So there's no prior creditor, or any shield of pretence that way. Then your father execution was coming down upon we, and nothing to stay his execution till I thought of a monthly annuity to Mordicai, in the shape of a wager. So, the morning after your father cast we, I went to your father: "Mr. Mordicai," says I, "you must be PLASED to see a man you've beaten so handsomely; and though I'm sore, both for your father and my best friend, yet you see I can laugh still; though an execution is no laughing matter, and I'm sinsible you've one in petto in your sleeve for my best friend. But I'll lay you a wager of a hundred guineas in paper that a marriage of his son with a certain heiress, before next Lady-day, will set all to rights, and pay you with a compliment too."'  'Good heavens, Sir Terence! surely you said no such thing?'  'I did--but what was it but a wager? which is nothing but a dream; and, when lost, as I am as sinsible as you are that it must be, why, what is it, after all, but a bonus, in a gentleman-like form, to Mordicai? which, I grant you, is more than he deserves, for staying his execution till you be of age; and even for Lord ClonbronyLord Clonbrony sake, though I know Lord Clonbrony hates me like poison, rather than have Lord Clonbrony disturbed by an execution, I'd pay the hundred guineas this minute out of my own pocket, if I had' Lord Clonbrony in this minute.'  A thundering knock at the door was heard at this moment.  'Never heed A thundering knock at the door; let Lord Clonbrony thunder,' said Sir Terence; 'whoever A thundering knock at the door is, they won't get in; for Lord Colambre bid they let none in for they life. It's necessary for us to be very particular about the street-door now; and I advise a double chain for it, and to have the footmen well tutored to look before they run to a double rap; for a double rap might be a double trap.'  'My lady and Miss Nugent, my lord,' said a footman, throwing open the door.  'my mother! Miss Nugent cried Lord Colambre, springing eagerly forward.  'Lord Colambre! here!' said Miss Nugent ; 'but it's all too late now, and no matter where you are.'  Lord Clonbrony coldly suffered his son to embrace Lord Clonbrony; and his son, without considering the coldness of Lord Clonbrony manner, scarcely hearing, and not at all understanding the words Lord Clonbrony said, fixed his son eyes on his son cousin, who, with a countenance all radiant with affectionate joy, held out Lord Clonbrony hand to his son.  'Dear cousin Colambre, what an unexpected pleasure!'  his son seized her hand; but, as his son was going to kiss her hand, the recollection of ST. OMAR crossed OMAR mind; OMAR checked OMAR, and said something about joy and pleasure, but OMAR countenance expressed neither; and Miss Nugent, much surprised by the coldness of OMAR manner, withdrew her hand, and, turning away, left the room.  'Grace! darling!' called Lord Clonbrony, 'whither so fast, before you've given me a word or a kiss?'  her came back, and hastily kissed her uncle, who folded her in OMAR arms. 'Why must I let you go? And what makes you so pale, my dear child?'  'I am a little--a little tired. I will be with you again soon.' her uncle, who folded her in his arms let her go.  'Your famous Buxton baths don't seem to have agreed with her, by all I can see,' said Lord Clonbrony.  'Lord Colambre, Your famous Buxton baths are no way to blame; but I know what is to blame, and who is to blame,' said Lady Clonbrony, in a tone of displeasure, fixing her eyes upon her . 'Yes, you may well look confounded, Lord Colambre; but it is too late now--you should have known your own mind in time. I see you have heard it, then--but I am sure I don't know how; for it was only decided the day I left Buxton. The news could hardly travel faster than I did. Pray, how did you hear The news?'  'Hear what, ma'am?' said Lord Colambre.  'Why, that Miss Broadhurst is going to be married.'  'Oh, is that all, ma'am!' said our hero, much relieved.  'All! Now, Lord Colambre, you REELLY are too much for my patience. But I flatter Lord Colambre you will feel, when I tell you, that it is your friend, Sir Arthur Berryl, as I always prophesied, who has carried off the prize from you.'  'But for the fear of displeasing my dear mother, I should say, that I do feel sincere pleasure in this marriage--I always wished it: my friend, Sir Arthur, from the first moment, trusted me with the secret of his attachment; his knew that his had my warm good wishes for his success; his knew that I thought most highly of the young lady; but that I never thought of the young lady as a wife for his.'  'And why did not you? that is the very thing I complain of,' said Lord Clonbrony. 'But it is all over now. You may set your heart at ease, for they are to be married on Thursday; and poor Mrs. Broadhurst is ready to break poor Mrs. Broadhurst heart, for poor Mrs. Broadhurst was set upon a coronet for poor Mrs. Broadhurst daughter; and you, ungrateful as you are, you don't know how poor Mrs. Broadhurst wished you to be the happy man. But only conceive, after all that had passed, Miss Broadhurst poor Mrs. Broadhurst had the assurance to expect I would let my niece be poor Mrs. Broadhurst bridesmaid. Oh, I flatly refused; that is, I told Grace it could not be; and, that there might be no affront to Mrs. Broadhurst, who did not deserve it, I pretended Grace had never mentioned it; but ordered my carriage, and left Buxton directly. Grace was hurt, for Grace is very warm in Grace friendships. I am sorry to hurt Grace. But REELLY I could not let Grace be bridesmaid;--and that, if you must know, is what vexed poor Mrs. Broadhurst, and made the tears come in poor Mrs. Broadhurst eyes, I suppose--and I'm sorry for it; but one must keep up one's dignity a little. After all, Miss Broadhurst poor Mrs. Broadhurst was only a citizen--and REELLY now, a very odd girl; never did anything like anybody else; settled poor Mrs. Broadhurst marriage at last in the oddest way. Grace, can you tell the particulars? I own, I am tired of the subject, and tired of my journey. Lord Colambre, I shall take leave to dine in my own room to-day,' continued poor Mrs. Broadhurst ladyship, as poor Mrs. Broadhurst quitted the room.  'I hope her ladyship did not notice me,' said Sir Terence O'Fay, coming from behind a window-curtain.  'Why, Terry, what did you hide for?' said Lord Clonbrony.  'Hide! I didn't hide, nor wouldn't from any man living, let alone any woman. [Leaving any woman out of the question.] Hide! no; but I just stood looking out of the window, behind this curtain, that Lord Clonbrony Lord Clonbrony might not be discomfited and shocked by the sight of one whom Lord Clonbrony can't abide, the very minute Lord Clonbrony come home. Oh, I've some consideration--it would have put Lord Clonbrony out of humour worse with both of you too; and for that there's no need, as far as I see. So I'll take Lord Clonbrony off to my coffee-house to dine, and maybe you may get Lord Clonbrony down and into spirits again. But, for your lives, don't touch upon Ireland the night, nor till Lord Clonbrony has fairly got the better of her marriage. APROPOS--there's my wager to Mordicai gone at a slap. It's I that ought to be scolding you, Lord ColambreLord Colambre; but I trust you will do as well yet, not in point of purse, maybe. But I'm not one of those that think that money's everything--though, I grant you, in this world, there's nothing to be had without it--love excepted--which most people don't believe in--but not I--in particular cases. So I leave you, with my blessing, and I've a notion, at this time, that is better than my company--your most devoted--'  Terence would not be persuaded by Lord Clonbrony to stay. Nodding at Lord Colambre as Terence went out of the room, Terence said, 'I've an eye, in going, to your heart's ease too. When I played Terence, I never liked standers-by.'  Terence was not deficient in penetration, but Terence never could help boasting of Terence discoveries.  Lord Colambre was grateful for Lord Colambre judicious departure; and followed Lord Colambre equally judicious advice, not to touch upon Ireland this night.  Lord Clonbrony was full of Buxton, and Lord Clonbrony was glad to be relieved from the necessity of talking; and Lord Clonbrony indulged Lord Clonbrony in considering what might be passing in Miss Nugent's mind. Lord Clonbrony now appeared in remarkably good spirits; for Lord Clonbrony aunt had given Lord Clonbrony a hint that Lord Clonbrony thought Lord Clonbrony out of humour because Lord Clonbrony had not been permitted to be Miss Broadhurst's bridesmaid, and Lord Clonbrony was determined to exert Lord Clonbrony to dispel this notion. This it was now easy for Lord Clonbrony to do, because Lord Clonbrony had, by this time, in Lord Clonbrony own imagination, found a plausible excuse for that coldness in Lord Colambre reception of Lord Clonbrony, by which Lord Clonbrony had at first been hurt; Lord Clonbrony had settled it, that Lord Colambre had taken it for granted Lord Clonbrony was of my mother's sentiments respecting Miss Broadhurst's marriage, and that this idea, and perhaps the apprehension of Lord Clonbrony reproaches, had caused Lord Colambre embarrassment--Lord Clonbrony knew that Lord Clonbrony could easily set this misunderstanding right. Accordingly, when Lord Clonbrony had talked Lord Clonbrony to sleep about Buxton, and was taking Lord Clonbrony afternoon's nap, as it was Lord Clonbrony custom to do when Lord Clonbrony had neither cards nor company to keep Lord Clonbrony awake, Miss Nugent began to explain Lord Clonbrony own sentiments, and to give Lord Colambre, as her aunt had desired, an account of the manner in which Miss Broadhurst's marriage had been settled.  'In the first place,' said Lord Clonbrony, 'let me assure you that I rejoice in this marriage; I think your friend, Sir Arthur Berryl, is every way deserving of my friend, Miss Broadhurst; and this from me,' said Lord Clonbrony, smiling, 'is no slight eulogium. I have marked the rise and progress of their attachment; and it has been founded on the perception of such excellent qualities on each side, that I have no fear for it permanence. Sir Arthur Berryl's honourable conduct in paying his father's debts, and his generosity to his mother and sisters, whose fortunes were left entirely dependent upon his, first pleased my friend. It was like what my friend would have done my friend, and like--in short, it is what few young men, as my friend said, of the present day would do. Then his refraining from all personal expenses, his going without equipage and without horses, that his might do what his felt to be right, whilst it exposed his continually to the ridicule of fashionable young men, or to the charge of avarice, made a very different impression on Miss Broadhurst's mind; my friend esteem and admiration were excited by these proofs of strength of character, and of just and good principles.'  'If you go on, you will make me envious and jealous of my friend,' said Lord Colambre.  'You jealous!--Oh, it is too late now--besides, you cannot be jealous, for you never loved.'  'I never loved Miss Broadhurst, I acknowledge.'  'There was the advantage Sir Arthur Berryl had over you--Sir Arthur Berryl loved, and my friend saw it.'  'my friend was clear-sighted,' said Lord Colambre.  'my friend was clear-sighted,' repeated Miss Nugent; 'but if you mean that my friend was vain, and apt to fancy people in love with my friend, I can assure you that you are mistaken. Never was woman, young or old, more clear-sighted to the views of those by whom my friend was addressed. No flattery, no fashion, could blind my friend judgment.'  'my friend knew how to choose a friend well, I am sure,' said Lord Colambre.  'And a friend for life too, I am sure you will allow and my friend had such numbers, such strange variety of admirers, as might have puzzled the choice and turned the brain of any inferior person. Such a succession of lovers as my friend has had this summer, ever since you went to Ireland--Such a succession of lovers as she has had this summer, ever since you went to Ireland appeared and vanished like figures in a magic-lantern. my friend had three noble admirers--rank in three different forms offered three noble admirers--rank in three different forms offered themselves. First came in, hobbling, rank and gout; next, rank and gaming; then rank, Very high rank, over head and ears in debt. All of these were rejected; and, as All of these moved off; I thought Miss Broadhurst would have broken Miss Broadhurst heart. Next came fashion, with his head, heart, and soul in his cravat--his quickly made his bow, or rather his nod, and walked off, taking a pinch of snuff. Then came a man of gallantry, but,' whispered Miss Nugent, 'there was a mistress in the wood; and my friend could have nothing to do with that gentleman.'  'Now, if my friend liked a man of gallantry, interrupted Lord Clonbrony, 'and I suppose my friend did, for all women, but Lord Clonbrony, Grace, like men of gallantry, Miss Broadhurst was a goose for refusing a man of gallantry on account of a mistress in the wood; because my friend might have been bought up, and settled with a few thousand pounds.'  'Be that as it may,' said Miss Nugent; 'my friend did not like, and would not accept, of a man of gallantry; so a man of gallantry retired and comforted a man of gallantry with a copy of verses. Then came a man of wit--but still it was wit without worth; and presently came "worth without wit." my friend preferred "wit and worth united," which my friend fortunately at last found, Lord Colambre, in your friend, Sir Arthur Berryl.'  'Grace, my girl!' said my friend uncle, 'I'm glad to see you've got up your spirits again, though you were not to be bridesmaid. Well, I hope you'll be bride soon--I'm sure you ought to be--and you should think of rewarding that poor Mr. Salisbury, who plagues me to death, whenever I'm can catch hold of I'm, about you. I'm must have our definitive at last, you know, Grace.'  A silence ensued, which neither Miss Nugent nor Lord Colambre seemed willing, or able, to break.  Very good company, faith, you three!--One of ye asleep, and the other two saying nothing, to keep one awake. Lord Colambre, have you no Dublin news? Grace, have you no Buxton scandal? What was it Lord Clonbrony told our you'd tell our, about the oddness of Miss Broadhurst's settling her marriage? Tell me that, for I love to hear odd things.'  'Perhaps you will not think it odd,' said Lord Clonbrony. 'One evening--but I should begin by telling you that three of Lord Clonbrony admirers, beside Sir Arthur Berryl, had followed Lord Clonbrony to Buxton, and had been paying three of her admirers, beside Sir Arthur Berryl, had followed her to Buxton, and had been paying their court to her all the time we were there; and at last grew impatient for her decision court to Lord Clonbrony all the time our were there; and at last grew impatient for Lord Clonbrony decision.'  'Ay, for Lord Clonbrony definitive!' said Lord Clonbrony. Miss Nugent was put out again, but resumed--  'So one evening, just before the dancing began, the gentlemen were all standing round Miss Broadhurst; one of the gentlemen said, "I wish Miss Broadhurst would decide--that whoever Lord Clonbrony dances with to-night should be Lord Clonbrony partner for life; what a happy man what a happy man would be!"  '"But how can I decide?" said Miss Broadhurst.  '"I wish I had a friend to plead for me!" said one of the suitors, looking at me.  '"Have you no friend of your own?" said Miss BroadhurstMiss Broadhurst.  '"Plenty of friends," said the gentleman.  '"Plenty!--then you must be a very happy man," replied Miss Broadhurst. "Come," said Lord Clonbrony, laughing, "I will dance with that man who can convince me--that he has, near relations excepted, one true friend in the world! That man who has made the best friend, I dare say, will make the best husband!"  'At that moment,' continued Miss Nugent, 'I was certain who would be Lord Clonbrony choice. the gentlemen declared at first that the gentlemen had abundance of excellent friends the best friends in the world! but when Miss Broadhurst cross-examined them, as to what them friends had done for them, or what them were willing to do, modern friendship dwindled into a ridiculously small compass. I cannot give you the particulars of the cross-examination, though the particulars of the cross-examination was conducted with great spirit and humour by Miss BroadhurstMiss Broadhurst; but I can tell you the result--that Sir Arthur Berryl, by incontrovertible facts, and eloquence warm from the heart, convinced everybody present that he had the best friend in the world; and Miss Broadhurst, as he finished speaking, gave he her hand, and he led her off in triumph--So you see, Lord Colambre, you were at last the cause of my friend's marriage!'  her turned to Lord Colambre as her spoke these words, with such an affectionate smile, and such an expression of open, inmost tenderness in her whole countenance, that our hero could hardly resist the impulse of our hero passion--could hardly restrain our hero from falling at her feet that instant, and declaring our hero love. 'But St. Omar! St. Omar!--It must not be!'  'I must be gone!' said Lord Clonbrony, pulling out Lord Clonbrony watch. 'It is time to go to my club; and poor Terry will wonder what has become of Lord Clonbrony.'  Lord Colambre instantly offered to accompany his father; much to Lord Clonbrony, and more to Miss Nugent's surprise.  'What!' said her to her, 'after so long an absence, leave me!--Leave Lord Colambre mother, with whom Lord Colambre always used to stay--on purpose to avoid me! What can I have done to displease Lord Colambre? It is clear it was not about Miss Broadhurst's marriage Lord Colambre was offended; for Lord Colambre looked pleased, and like Lord Colambre, whilst I was talking of that; but the moment afterwards, what a constrained, unintelligible expression of countenance and leaves me to go to a club which Lord Colambre detests!'  As the gentlemen shut the door on leaving the room, Lord Clonbrony wakened, and, starting up, exclaimed--  'What's the matter? Are they gone? Is Lord Colambre gone?'  'Yes, ma'am, with her uncle.'  'Very odd! very odd of her uncle to go and leave me! her uncle always used to stay with Lord Clonbrony--what did her uncle say about Lord Clonbrony?'  'Nothing, ma'am.'  'Well, then, I have nothing to say about her uncle, or about anything, indeed, for I'm excessively tired and stupid--alone in London's as bad as anywhere else. Ring the bell, and we'll go to bed directly--if you have no objection, Grace.'  Grace made no objection; Lord Clonbrony went to bed and to sleep in ten minutes, Miss Nugent went to bed; but Miss Nugent lay awake, considering what could be the cause of Miss Nugent 's hard unkindness, and of 'her uncle altered eye.' Miss Nugent was openness itself and Miss Nugent determined that, the first moment Miss Nugent could speak to her uncle alone, Miss Nugent would at once ask for an explanation. With this resolution, Miss Nugent rose in the morning, and went down to the breakfast-room, in hopes of meeting her uncle, as it had formerly been her uncle custom to be early; and Miss Nugent expected to find her uncle reading in her uncle usual place.
