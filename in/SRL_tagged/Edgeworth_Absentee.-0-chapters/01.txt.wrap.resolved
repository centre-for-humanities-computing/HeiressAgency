  'Are you to be at Lady Clonbrony's gala next week?' said Lady Langdale to Mrs. Dareville, whilst they were waiting for they carriages in the crush-room of the opera house.  'Oh yes! everybody's to be there, I hear,' replied Mrs. Dareville. 'Your ladyship, of course?'  'Why, I don't know--if I possibly can. Lady Clonbrony makes it such a point with Lady Clonbrony, that I believe I must look in upon Lady Clonbrony for a few minutes. They are going to a prodigious expense on this occasion. Soho tells me the reception rooms are all to be new furnished, and in the most magnificent style.'  'At what a famous rate those Clonbronies are dashing on,' said Colonel Heathcock. 'Up to anything.'  'Who are they?--these Clonbronies, that one hears of so much of late' said Lady Clonbrony Grace of Torcaster. 'Irish absentees I know. But how do Irish absentees support all this enormous expense?'  'The son WILL have a prodigiously fine estate when some Mr. Quin dies,' said Mrs. Dareville.  'Yes, everybody who comes from Ireland WILL have a fine estate when somebody dies,' said her Grace of Torcaster. 'But what have everybody who comes from Ireland at present?'  'Twenty thousand a year, everybody who comes from Ireland say,' replied Mrs. Dareville.  'Ten thousand, I believe,' cried Lady Langdale. 'Make it a rule, you know, to believe only half the world says.'  'Ten thousand, have they?--possibly,' said Lady Langdale . 'I know nothing about them--have no acquaintance among the Irish. Torcaster knows something of Lady Clonbrony; Torcaster has fastened Torcaster, by some means, upon him: but I charge him not to COMMIT me. Positively, I could not for anybody--and much less for that sort of person--extend the circle of my acquaintance.'  'Now that is so cruel of her Grace of Torcaster,' said Mrs. Dareville, laughing, 'when Lady Clonbrony Lady Clonbrony works so hard, and pays so high, to get into certain circles.'  'If you knew all Lady Clonbrony endures, to look, speak, move, breathe like an Englishwoman, you would pity Lady Clonbrony,' said Lady Langdale.  'Yes, and you CAWNT conceive the PEENS Lady Langdale TEEKES to talk of the TEEBLES and CHEERS, and to thank Q, and, with so much TEESTE, to speak pure English,' said Mrs. Dareville.  'Pure cockney, you mean,' said Lady Langdale.  'But why does Lady Clonbrony want to pass for English?' said the duchess.  'Oh! because Lady Clonbrony is not quite Irish. BRED AND BORN--only bred, not born,' said Mrs. Dareville. 'And Mrs. Dareville could not be five minutes in your grace's company before Mrs. Dareville would tell you, that Mrs. Dareville was HENGLISH, born in HOXFORDSHIRE.'  'Mrs. Dareville must be a vastly amusing personage. I should like to meet Mrs. Dareville, if one could see and hear Mrs. Dareville incog.,' said the duchess. 'And Lady Clonbrony, what is Lady Clonbrony?'  'Nothing, nobody,' said Mrs. Dareville; 'one never even hears of Lady Clonbrony.'  'A tribe of daughters, too, I suppose?'  'No, no,' said Lady Langdale, 'daughters would be past all endurance.'  'There's a cousin, though, a Grace Nugent,' said Mrs. Dareville, 'that Lady Clonbrony has with Lady Clonbrony.'  'Best part of Lady Clonbrony, too,' said Colonel Heathcock; 'd-d fine girl!--never saw -d look better than at the opera to-night!'  'Fine COMPLEXION! as Lady Clonbrony says, when Lady Clonbrony means a high colour,' said Lady Langdale.  'a Grace Nugent is not a lady's beauty,' said Mrs. Dareville. 'Has Mrs. Dareville any fortune, colonel?'  ''Pon honour, don't know,' said the colonel.  'There's a son, somewhere, is not there?' said Lady Langdale.  'Don't know, 'pon honour,' replied the colonel.  'Yes--at Cambridge--not of age yet,' said Mrs. Dareville. 'Bless me! here is Lady Clonbrony come back. I thought Lady Clonbrony was gone half an hour ago!'  'Mamma,' whispered one of Lady Langdale daughters, leaning between Lady Clonbrony mother and Mrs. Dareville, 'who is that gentleman that passed us just now?'  'Which way?'  'Towards the door. There now, 'Mamma, you can see a son. a son is speaking to Lady Clonbrony--to a Grace Nugent. Now Lady Clonbrony is introducing a son to Miss Broadhurst.'  'I see a son now,' said Lady Langdale, examining a son through Lady Langdale glass; 'a very gentlemanlike-looking young man, indeed.'  'Not an Irishman, I am sure, by a son manner,' said Lady Langdale grace.  'Heathcock!' said Lady Langdale, 'who is Miss Broadhurst talking to?'  'Eh! now really--'pon honour--don't know,' replied Heathcock.  'And yet a son certainly looks like somebody one certainly should know,' pursued Lady Langdale, 'though I don't recollect seeing a son anywhere before.'  'Really now!' was all the satisfaction Lady Langdale could gain from the insensible, immovable colonel. However, Lady Langdale ladyship, after sending a whisper along the line, gained the desired information, that the young gentleman was Lord Colambre, son, only son, of Lord and Lady Clonbrony--that a son was just come from Cambridge--that a son was not yet of age--that a son would be of age within a year--that a son would then, after the death of somebody, come into possession of a fine estate, by the mother's side 'and therefore, Cat'rine, my dear,' said the mother, turning round to the daughter, who had first pointed a son out, 'you understand, we should never talk about other people's affairs.'  'No, mamma, never. I hope to goodness, mamma, Lord Colambre did not hear what you and Mrs. Dareville were saying!'  'How could Mrs. Dareville, child? Mrs. Dareville was quite at the other end of the world.'  'I beg your pardon, ma'am, your pardon was at my elbow, close behind we; but I never thought about your pardon till I heard somebody say, "My lord--"'  'Good heavens! I hope your pardon didn't hear.'  'But, for my part, I said nothing,' cried Lady Langdale.  'And for my part, I said nothing but what everybody knows!' cried Mrs. Dareville.  'And for my part, I am guilty only of hearing,' said the duchess. 'Do, pray, Colonel Heathcock, have the goodness to see what my people are about, and what chance my people have of getting away to-night.'  'The Duchess of Torcaster's carriage stops the way!'--a joyful sound to Colonel Heathcock and to The Duchess of Torcaster's carriage grace, and not less agreeable, at this instant, to Lady Langdale, who, the moment The Duchess of Torcaster's carriage was disembarrassed of The Duchess of Torcaster's carriage, pressed through the crowd to Lady Clonbrony, and, addressing The Duchess of Torcaster's carriage with smiles and complacency, was 'charmed to have a little moment to speak to The Duchess of Torcaster's carriage--could NOT sooner get through the crowd--would certainly do The Duchess of Torcaster's carriage the honour to be at The Duchess of Torcaster's carriage ladyship's gala on Wednesday.' While Lady Langdale spoke, Lady Langdale never seemed to see or think of anybody but Lady Clonbrony, though, all the time, Lady Langdale was intent upon every motion of Lord Colambre, and, whilst Lady Langdale was obliged to listen with a face of sympathy to a long complaint of Lady Clonbrony, about Mr. Soho's want of taste in ottomans, Lady Langdale was vexed to perceive that his lordship showed no desire to be introduced to Lady Langdale, or to Lady Langdale daughters; but, on the contrary, was standing talking to Miss Nugent. his lordship mother, at the end of His mother speech, looked round for Lord Colambre called his lordship twice before his lordship heard--introduced his lordship to Lady Langdale, and to Lady Cat'rine, and Lady Anne--, and to Mrs. Dareville; to all of whom his lordship bowed with an air of proud coldness, which gave them reason to regret that them remarks upon his lordship mother and his lordship family had not been made SOTTO VOCE.  'Lady Langdale carriage stops the way!' Lord Colambre made no offer of Lord Colambre services, notwithstanding a look from His mother. Incapable of the meanness of voluntarily listening to a conversation not intended for Lord Colambre to hear, Lord Colambre had, however, been compelled, by the pressure of the crowd, to remain a few minutes stationary, where Lord Colambre could not avoid hearing the remarks of the fashionable friends. Disdaining dissimulation, Lord Colambre made no attempt to conceal Lord Colambre displeasure. Perhaps Lord Colambre vexation was increased by Lord Colambre consciousness that there was some mixture of truth in their sarcasms. Lord Colambre was sensible that His mother, in some points--His mother manners, for instance--was oblivious to ridicule and satire. In Lady Clonbrony's address there was a mixture of constraint, affectation, and indecision, unusual in a person of Lady Clonbrony's birth, rank, and knowledge of the world. A natural and unnatural manner seemed struggling in all Lady Clonbrony's gestures, and in every syllable that Lady Clonbrony's articulated--a naturally free, familiar, good-natured, precipitate, Irish manner, had been schooled, and schooled late in life, into a sober, cold, still, stiff deportment, which Lady Clonbrony's mistook for English. A strong, Hibernian accent, Lady Clonbrony's had, with infinite difficulty, changed into an English tone. Mistaking reverse of wrong for right, Lady Clonbrony's caricatured the English pronunciation; and the extraordinary precision of Lady Clonbrony's London phraseology betrayed Lady Clonbrony's not to be a Londoner, as the man, who strove to pass for an Athenian, was detected by his Attic dialect. Not aware of Lady Clonbrony's real danger, Lady Clonbrony was, on the opposite side, in continual apprehension, every time Lady Clonbrony opened Lady Clonbrony lips, lest some treacherous A or E, some strong R, some puzzling aspirate, or non-aspirate, some unguarded note, interrogative or expostulatory, should betray Lady Clonbrony to be an Irishwoman. Mrs. Dareville had, in Mrs. Dareville mimickry, perhaps a little exaggerated as to the TEEBLES and CHEERS, but still the general likeness of the representation of Lady Clonbrony was strong enough to strike and vex Lady Clonbrony son. her son had now, for the first time, an opportunity of judging of the estimation in which her son her son were held by certain leaders of the ton, of whom, in her letters, her had spoken so much, and into whose society, or rather into whose parties, her had been admitted. her son saw that the renegade cowardice, with which her denied, abjured, and reviled her own country, gained nothing but ridicule and contempt. her son loved her son ; and, whilst her son endeavoured to conceal her faults and foibles as much as possible from her son own heart, her son could not endure those who dragged them to light and ridicule. The next morning the first thing that occurred to Lord Colambre remembrance when Lord Colambre awoke was the sound of the contemptuous emphasis which had been laid on the words IRISH ABSENTEES! This led to recollections of Lord Colambre native country, to comparisons of past and present scenes, to future plans of life. Young and careless as Lord Colambre seemed, Lord Colambre was capable of serious reflection. Of naturally quick and strong capacity, ardent affections, impetuous temper, the early years of Lord Colambre childhood passed at Lord Colambre father's castle in Ireland, where, from the lowest servant to the well-dressed dependant of the family, everybody had conspired to wait upon, to fondle, to flatter, to worship, this darling of everybody lord. Yet Lord Colambre was not spoiled--not rendered selfish. For, in the midst of this flattery and servility, some strokes of genuine generous affection had gone home to Lord Colambre little heart; and, though unqualified submission had increased the natural impetuosity of Lord Colambre temper, and though visions of Lord Colambre future grandeur had touched Lord Colambre infant thought, yet, fortunately, before Lord Colambre acquired any fixed habits of insolence or tyranny, Lord Colambre was carried far away from all that were bound or willing to submit to Lord Colambre commands, far away from all signs of hereditary grandeur--plunged into one of our great public schools--into a new world. Forced to struggle, mind and body, with Lord Colambre equals, Lord Colambre rivals, Lord Colambre became a spirited schoolboy, and, in time, a man. Fortunately for Lord Colambre, science and literature happened to be the fashion among a set of clever young men with whom Lord Colambre was at Cambridge. Lord Colambre ambition for intellectual superiority was raised, Lord Colambre views were enlarged, Lord Colambre tastes and Lord Colambre manners formed. The sobriety of English good sense mixed most advantageously with Irish vivacity; English prudence governed, but did not extinguish Lord Colambre Irish enthusiasm. But, in fact, English and Irish had not been invidiously contrasted in Lord Colambre mind: Lord Colambre had been so long resident in England, and so intimately connected with Englishmen, that Lord Colambre was not oblivious to any of the commonplace ridicule thrown upon Hibernians; and Lord Colambre had lived with men who were too well informed and liberal to misjudge or depreciate a sister country. Lord Colambre had found, from experience, that, however reserved the English may be in manner, they are warm at heart; that, however averse they may be from forming new acquaintance, they esteem and confidence once gained, they make the fashionable friends. Lord Colambre had formed friendships in England; Lord Colambre was fully sensible of the superior comforts, refinement, and information, of English society; but his native country was endeared to Lord Colambre by early association, and a sense of duty and patriotism attached Lord Colambre to Ireland. And shall I too be an absentee? was a question which resulted from these reflections--a question which Lord Colambre was not yet prepared to answer decidedly. In the meantime, the first business of the morning was to execute a commission for a Cambridge friend. Mr. Berryl had bought from Mr. Mordicai, a famous London coachmaker, a curricle, WARRANTED SOUND, for which Mr. Berryl had paid a sound price, upon express condition that Mr. Mordicai, BARRING ACCIDENTS, should be answerable for all repairs of the curricle for six months. In three, both the carriage and body were found to be good for nothing--the curricle had been returned to Mr. Mordicai--nothing had since been heard of the curricle, or from him--and Lord Colambre had undertaken to pay him and the curricle a visit, and to make all proper inquiries. Accordingly, him went to the coachmaker's, and, obtaining no satisfaction from the underlings, desired to see the head of the house. him was answered, that Mr. Mordicai was not at home. Mr. Mordicai had never seen Mr. Mordicai; but, just then, Mr. Mordicai saw, walking across the yard, a man, who looked something like a Bond Street coxcomb, but not the least like a gentleman, who called, in the tone of a master, for 'Mr. Mordicai's barouche!' It appeared; and Mr. Mordicai was stepping into It when Lord Colambre took the liberty of stopping Lord Colambre; and, pointing to the wreck of Mr. Berryl's curricle, now standing in the yard, began a statement of Mr. Mordicai friend's grievances, and an appeal to common justice and conscience, which Mr. Mordicai, unknowing the nature of the man with whom Mr. Mordicai had to deal, imagined must be irresistible. Mr. Mordicai stood without moving a muscle of Mr. Mordicai dark wooden face. Indeed, in his dark wooden face there appeared to be no muscles, or none which could move; so that, though Mr. Mordicai had what are generally called handsome features, there was, all together, something unnatural and shocking in Mr. Mordicai countenance. When, at last, Mr. Mordicai eyes turned, and Mr. Mordicai lips opened, this seemed to be done by machinery, and not by the will of a living creature, or from the impulse of a rational soul. Lord Colambre was so much struck with this strange physiognomy, that Lord Colambre actually forgot much Lord Colambre had to say of springs and wheels. But it was no matter. Whatever Lord Colambre had said, it would have come to the same thing; and Mr. Mordicai would have answered as Lord Colambre now did--  'Lord Colambre, it was my partner made that bargain, not myself; and I don't hold Lord Colambre bound by it, for my partner is the sleeping-partner only, and not empowered to act in the way of business. Had Mr. Berryl bargained with Lord Colambre, I should have told Mr. Berryl that Mr. Berryl should have looked to these things before Mr. Berryl carriage went out of our yard.'  The indignation of Lord Colambre kindled at these words--but in vain. To all that indignation could by word or look urge against Mr. Mordicai, Lord Colambre replied--  'Maybe so, Lord Colambre; the law is open to your friend--the law is open to all men who can pay for the law.'  Lord Colambre turned in despair from the callous coach-maker, and listened to one of Lord Colambre more compassionate-looking workmen, who was reviewing the disabled curricle; and, whilst Lord Colambre was waiting to know the sum of his friend's misfortune, a fat, jolly, Falstaff looking personage came into the yard, accosted Mr. Mordicai with a degree of familiarity, which, from a gentleman, appeared to Lord Colambre to be almost impossible.  'How are you, Mr. Mordicai, my good fellow?' cried Lord Colambre, speaking with a strong Irish accent.  'Who is this?' whispered Lord Colambre to the foreman, who was examining the curricle.  'Sir Terence O'Fay, sir. There must be entire new wheels.'  'Now tell me, my tight fellow,' continued Sir Terence, holding Mr. Mordicai fast, 'when, in the name of all the saints, good or bad, in the calendar, do you reckon to let us sport the SUICIDE?'  Mr. Mordicai forcibly drew Mr. Mordicai mouth into what Mr. Mordicai meant for a smile, and answered, 'As soon as possible, ' continued Sir Terence.'  ' continued Sir Terence, in a tone of jocose, wheedling expostulation, entreated ' continued Sir Terence to have his carriage finished OUT OF HAND. 'Ah, now! Mordy, my precious! let us have it by the birthday, and come and dine with us o' Monday, at the Hibernian Hotel--there's a rare one--will you?'  Mr. Mordicai accepted the invitation, and promised faithfully that the SUICIDE should be finished by the birthday. ' continued Sir Terence shook hands upon this promise, and, after telling a good story, which made one of the workmen in the yard--an Irishman--grin with delight, walked off. Mordicai, first waiting till the knight was out of hearing, called aloud--  'You grinning rascal! mind, at your peril, and don't let that there carriage be touched, d'ye see, till further orders.'  One of Mr. Mordicai's clerks, with a huge long-feathered pen behind Mr. Mordicai ear, observed that Mr. Mordicai was right in that caution, for that, to the best of Mr. Mordicai comprehension, Sir Terence O'Fay and Mr. Mordicai principal, too, were over head and ears in debt.  Mr. Mordicai coolly answered that Mr. Mordicai was well aware of that; but that the estate could afford to dip further; that, for Mr. Mordicai part, Mr. Mordicai was under no apprehension; Mr. Mordicai knew how to look sharp, and to bite before Mr. Mordicai was bit. That Mr. Mordicai knew Sir Terence and Mr. Mordicai principal were leagued together to give the creditors THE GO BY, but that, clever as they both were at that work, Mr. Mordicai trusted Mr. Mordicai was they match.  'Will you be so good, Lord Colambre, to finish making out this estimate for Lord Colambre?Lord ColambreLord Colambre.  'Immediately, Lord Colambre. Sixty-nine pound four, and the perch. Let us see--Mr. Mr. Mordicai, ask Mr, ask Paddy, about ' continued Sir Terence,' said the foreman, pointing back over Mr shoulder to the Irish workman, who was at this moment pretending to be wondrous hard at work. However, when Mr. Mordicai defied Mr. Mordicai to tell Mr. Mordicai anything Mr. Mordicai did not know, Paddy, parting with an untasted bit of tobacco, began, and recounted some of Sir Terence O'Fay's exploits in evading duns, replevying cattle, fighting sheriffs, bribing SUBS, managing cants, tricking CUSTODEES, in language so strange, and with a countenance and gestures so full of enjoyment of the jest, that, whilst Mr. Mordicai stood for a moment aghast with astonishment, Lord Colambre could not help laughing, partly at, and partly with, Lord Colambre countryman. All the yard were in a roar of laughter, though However, when Mr. Mordicai defied him to tell him anything he did not know, Paddy, parting with an untasted bit of tobacco, began, and recounted some of Sir Terence O'Fay's exploits in evading duns, replevying cattle, fighting sheriffs, bribing SUBS, managing cants, tricking CUSTODEES, in language so strange, and with a countenance and gestures so full of enjoyment of the jest, that, whilst Mordicai stood for a moment aghast with astonishment did not understand half of what However, when Mr. Mordicai defied him to tell him anything he did not know, Paddy, parting with an untasted bit of tobacco, began, and recounted some of Sir Terence O'Fay's exploits in evading duns, replevying cattle, fighting sheriffs, bribing SUBS, managing cants, tricking CUSTODEES, in language so strange, and with a countenance and gestures so full of enjoyment of the jest, that, whilst Mordicai stood for a moment aghast with astonishment heard; but However, when Mr. Mordicai defied him to tell him anything he did not know, Paddy, parting with an untasted bit of tobacco, began, and recounted some of Sir Terence O'Fay's exploits in evading duns, replevying cattle, fighting sheriffs, bribing SUBS, managing cants, tricking CUSTODEES, in language so strange, and with a countenance and gestures so full of enjoyment of the jest, that, whilst Mordicai stood for a moment aghast with astonishment risible muscles were acted upon mechanically, or maliciously, merely by the sound of the Irish brogue.  Mr. Mordicai, waiting till the laugh was over, dryly observed that 'the law is executed in another guess sort of way in England from what it is in Ireland'; therefore, for 'the law is executed in another guess sort of way in England from what it is in Ireland' part, 'the law is executed in another guess sort of way in England from what it is in Ireland' desired nothing better than to set 'the law is executed in another guess sort of way in England from what it is in Ireland' wits fairly against such SHARKS. That there was a pleasure in doing up a debtor which none but a creditor could know.  'In a moment, Lord Colambre; if you'll have a moment's patience, Lord Colambre, if you please,' said the slow foreman to Lord Colambre; 'I must go down the pounds once more, and then I'll let you have the pounds.'  'I'll tell you what, Smithfield,' continued Mr. Mordicai, coming close beside the slow foreman to Lord Colambre, and speaking very low, but with a voice trembling with anger, for Mr. Mordicai was piqued by the slow foreman to Lord Colambre's doubts of Mr. Mordicai capacity to cope with Sir Terence O'Fay; 'I'll tell you what, Smithfield, I'll be cursed, if I don't get every inch of Smithfield into my power. You know how?'  'You are the best judge, sir,' replied the slow foreman to Lord Colambre; 'but I would not undertake ' continued Sir Terence; and the question is, whether the estate will answer the LOT of the debts, and whether you know them all for certain?'  'I do, Lord Colambre, I tell you. There's Green there's Blancham--there's Gray--there's Soho--naming several more--and, to my knowledge, Lord Clonbrony--'  'Stop, Lord Colambre,' cried Lord Colambre in a voice which made Mordicai, and everybody present, start--'I am Lord Colambre son--'  'The devil!' said Mordicai.  'God bless every bone in God body, then! God's an Irishman,' cried Paddy; 'and there was the RASON my heart warmed to God from the first minute God come into the yard, though I did not know it till now.'  'What, Lord Colambre! are you Lord Colambre?' said Mr. Mordicai, recovering, but not clearly recovering, Lord Colambre intellects. 'I beg pardon, but I did not know you WAS Lord Colambre. I thought you told me you was the friend of Mr. Berryl.'  'I do not see the incompatibility of the assertion, sir,' replied Lord Colambre, taking from the bewildered foreman's unresisting hand the account, which Lord Colambre had been so long FURNISHING.  'Give me leave, Lord Colambre,' said Mr. Mordicai. 'I beg your pardon, Lord Colambre, perhaps we can compromise that business for the friend of Mr. Berryl; since the friend of Mr. Berryl is your lordship's friend, perhaps we can contrive to COMPROMISE and SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.'  TO COMPROMISE and SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE, Mr. Mordicai thought were favourite phrases, and approved Hibernian modes of doing business, which would conciliate this young Irish nobleman, and dissipate the proud tempest which had gathered and now swelled in this young Irish nobleman breast.  'No, Lord Colambre, no!' cried Lord Colambre, holding firm the paper. 'I want no favour from Lord Colambre. I will accept of none for the friend of Mr. Berryl or for Lord Colambre.'  'Favour! No, Lord Colambre, I should not presume to offer--But I should wish, if you'll allow me, to do your friend justice.'  Lord Colambre recollecting that Lord Colambre had no right, in Lord Colambre pride, to ding away Lord Colambre friend's money, let Mr. Mordicai look at the account; and, Mr. Mordicai impetuous temper in a few moments recovered by good sense, Mr. Mordicai considered that, as Mr. Mordicai person was utterly unknown to Mr. Mordicai, no offence could have been intended to Mr. Mordicai, and that, perhaps, in what had been said of Mr. Mordicai father's debts and distress, there might be more truth than Mr. Mordicai was aware of. Prudently, therefore, controlling Mr. Mordicai feelings, and commanding Mr. Mordicai, Mr. Mordicai suffered Mr. Mordicai to show Mr. Mordicai into a parlour, to SETTLE the friend of Mr. Berryl's business. In a few minutes the account was reduced to a reasonable form, and, in consideration of the partner's having made the bargain, by which Mr. Mordicai felt Mr. Mordicai influenced in honour, though not bound in law, Mr. Mordicai undertook to have the curricle made better than new again, for Mr. Berryl, for twenty guineas. Then came awkward apologies to Lord Colambre, which Mr. Mordicai ill endured. 'Between ourselves, Lord Colambre,' continued Mordicai--  But the familiarity of the phrase, 'Between ourselves'--this implication of equality--Lord Colambre could not admit; Lord Colambre moved hastily towards the door and departed.
