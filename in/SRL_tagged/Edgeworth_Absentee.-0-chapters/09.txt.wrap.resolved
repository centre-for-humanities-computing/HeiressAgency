 Lord Colambre had waited with great impatience for an answer to the letter of inquiry which  Lord Colambre had written about Miss Nugent's mother. A letter from Lady Clonbrony arrived;  Lord Colambre opened A letter from Lady Clonbrony with the greatest eagerness--passed over 'Rheumatism warm weather--warm bath--Buxton balls--Miss Broadhurst--your FRIEND, Sir Arthur Berryl, very assiduous!' The name of Grace Nugent  Lord Colambre found at last, and read as follows:  Her mother's maiden name was ST. OMAR; and there was a FAUX PAS, certainly. Her was, I am told (for it was before my time), educated at a convent abroad; and there was an affair with a Captain Reynolds, a young officer, which Her friends were obliged to hush up. Her brought an infant to England with Her, and took the name of Reynolds--but none of that family would acknowledge Her; and Her lived in great obscurity, till your uncle Nugent saw, fell in love with Her, and (knowing Her whole history) married Her. He adopted the child, gave Her He name, and, after some years, the whole story was forgotten. Nothing could be more disadvantageous to Grace than to have the whole story revived: this is the reason we kept the whole story secret.  Lord Colambre tore the letter to bits.  From the perturbation which Lady Dashfort saw in Lord Colambre countenance, Lady Dashfort guessed the nature of the letter which Lord Colambre had been reading, and for the arrival of which Lord Colambre had been so impatient.  'It has worked!' said Lady Dashfort to Lady Dashfort. 'POUR LE COUP PHILIPPE JE TE TIENS!'  Lord Colambre appeared this day more sensible, than Lord Colambre had ever yet seemed, to the charms of the fair Isabel.  'Many a tennis-ball, and many a heart is caught at the rebound,' said Lady Dashfort. 'the fair Isabel! now is your time!'  And so it was--or so, perhaps, it would have been, but for a circumstance which Lady Dashfort ladyship, with all Lady Dashfort genius for intrigue, had never taken into Lady Dashfort consideration. Count O'Halloran came to return the visit which had been paid to Count O'Halloran; and, in the course of conversation, Count O'Halloran spoke of the officers who had been introduced to Count O'Halloran, and told Lady Dashfort that Count O'Halloran had heard a report which shocked Count O'Halloran much--Count O'Halloran hoped it could not be true--that one of the officers who had been introduced to him had introduced Count O'Halloran mistress as Count O'Halloran wife to Lady Oranmore, who lived in the neighbourhood. Count O'Halloran, it was said, had let Lady Oranmore send Lady Oranmore carriage for this woman; and that this woman had dined at Lady Oranmore with this woman ladyship and this woman daughters. [Fact.] 'But I cannot believe it! I cannot believe it to be possible, that any gentleman, that any officer, could do such a thing!' said the count.  'And is this all?' exclaimed Lady Dashfort. 'Is this all the terrible affair, my good count, which has brought your face to this prodigious length?'  the count looked at Lady Dashfort with astonishment.  'Such a look of virtuous indignation,' continued Lady Dashfort, 'did I never behold, on or off the stage. Forgive me for laughing, count; but, believe me, comedy goes through the world better than tragedy, and, take it all in all, does rather less mischief. As to the thing in question, I know nothing about it: I dare say, it is not true; but, now, suppose it was--it is only a silly QUIZ, of a raw young officer, upon a prudish old dowager. I know nothing about it, for my part; but, after all, what irreparable mischief has been done? Laugh at the thing, and then it is a jest--a bad one, perhaps, but still only a jest--and there's an end of it; but take it seriously, and there is no knowing where it might end--in half a dozen duels, maybe.'  'Of that, madam,' said the count, 'Lady Dashfort prudence and presence of mind have prevented all danger. Lady Dashfort ladyship WOULD not understand the insult. Lady Dashfort said, or Lady Dashfort acted as if Lady Dashfort said, "JE NE VEUX RIEN VOIR, RIEN ECOUTER, RIEN SAVOIR." Lady Dashfort is one of the most respectable--'  'Count, I beg your pardon!' interrupted Lady Dashfort; 'but I must tell you that your favourite, Lady Dashfort, has behaved very ill to me; purposely omitted to invite Isabel to Isabel ball; offended and insulted me:--her praises, therefore, cannot be the most agreeable subject of conversation you can choose for my amusement; and as to the rest, you, who have such variety and so much politeness, will, I am sure, have the goodness to indulge my caprice in this instance.'  I shall obey your ladyship, and be silent, whatever pleasure your ladyship might give me to speak on the most agreeable subject of conversation you can choose for my amusement,' said Count; 'and I trust Lady Dashfort will reward me by the assurance that, however playfully Lady Dashfort may have just now spoken, Lady Dashfort seriously disapproves and is shocked.'  'Oh, shocked! shocked to death! if that will satisfy you, my dear count.'  Count, obviously, was not satisfied; Count had civil, as well as military courage, and Count sense of right and wrong could stand against the raillery and ridicule of a fine lady.  The conversation ended: Lady Dashfort thought it would have no further consequences; and Lady Dashfort did not regret the loss of a man like Count O'Halloran, who lived retired in Lady Dashfort castle, and who could not have any influence upon the opinion of the fashionable world. However, upon turning from Count to Lord Colambre, who Lady Dashfort thought had been occupied with Lady Isabel, and to whom Lady Dashfort imagined all this dispute was uninteresting, Lady Dashfort perceived, by his countenance, that Lady Dashfort had made a great mistake. Still Lady Dashfort trusted that Lady Dashfort power over Lord Colambre was sufficient easily to efface whatever unfavourable impression The conversation had made upon Lord Colambre mind. Lord Colambre had no personal interest in the affair; and Lady Dashfort had generally found that people are easily satisfied about any wrong or insult, public or private, in which people have no immediate concern. But all the charms of Lady Dashfort conversation were now tried in vain to reclaim Lord Colambre from the reverie into which Lord Colambre had fallen.  Lord Colambre friend Sir James Brooke's parting advice occurred to our hero; His friend Sir James Brooke's parting advice eyes began to open to Lady Dashfort's character; and His friend Sir James Brooke's parting advice was, from this moment, freed from Lady Dashfort's power. Lady Isabel, however, had taken no part in all this--Lady Isabel was blameless; and, independently of Lady Isabel mother, and in pretended opposition of sentiment, Lady Isabel might have continued to retain the influence Lady Isabel had gained over Lord Colambre, but that a slight accident revealed to Lord Colambre Lady Isabel real disposition.  It happened, on the evening of this day, that Lady Isabel came into the library with one of the young ladies of the house, talking very eagerly, without perceiving Lord Colambre, who was sitting in one of the recesses reading.  'My dear creature, you are quite mistaken,' said Lady Isabel, 'My dear creature was never a favourite of mine; I always detested My dear creature; I only flirted with My dear creature to plague My dear creature wife. Oh that wife, my dear Elizabeth, I do hate!' cried Lady Isabel, clasping Lady Isabel hands, and expressing hatred with all Lady Isabel soul and with all Lady Isabel strength. 'I detest that Lady de Cresey to such a degree, that, to purchase the pleasure of making Lady Isabel feel the pangs of jealousy for one hour, look, I would this moment lay down this finger and let this finger be cut off.'  The face, the whole figure of Lady Isabel at this moment appeared to Lord Colambre suddenly metamorphosed; instead of the soft, gentle, amiable female, all sweet charity and tender sympathy, formed to love and to be loved, Lord Colambre beheld one possessed and convulsed by an evil spirit--Lady Isabel beauty, if beauty Lord Colambre could be called, the beauty of a fiend. Some ejaculation, which Lord Colambre unconsciously uttered, made Lady Isabel start. Lady Isabel saw Lord Colambre--saw the expression of Lord Colambre countenance, and knew that all was over.  Lord Colambre, to the utter astonishment and disappointment of Lady Dashfort, and to the still greater mortification of Lady Isabel, announced this night that it was necessary Lord Colambre should immediately pursue Lord Colambre tour in Ireland. We pass over all the castles in the air which the young ladies of the family had built, and which now fell to the ground. We pass all the civil speeches of Lord and Lady Killpatrick; all the vehement remonstrances of Lady Dashfort; and the vain sighs of Lady Isabel, To the last moment Lady Dashfort said--  'the last moment Lady Dashfort said--  ' will not go.'  But the last moment Lady Dashfort said--  ' went; and, when the last moment Lady Dashfort said--  ' was gone, Lady Dashfort exclaimed, 'the last moment Lady Dashfort said--  ' has escaped from Lady Dashfort.' And after a pause, turning to Lady Dashfort daughter, she, in the most taunting and contemptuous terms, reproached Lady Dashfort as the cause of this failure, concluding by a declaration that Lady Dashfort must in future manage Lady Dashfort own affairs, and had best settle Lady Dashfort mind to marry Heathcock, since every one else was too wise to think of Lady Dashfort.  Lady Isabel of course retorted. But We leave this amiable mother and daughter to recriminate in appropriate terms, and We follow We hero, rejoiced that he has been disentangled from this amiable mother and daughter snares. Those who have never been in similar peril will wonder much that he did not escape sooner; those who have ever been in like danger will wonder more that he escaped at all. Those who are best acquainted with the heart or imagination of man will be most ready to acknowledge that the combined charms of wit, beauty, and flattery, may, for a time, suspend the action of right reason in the mind of the greatest philosopher, or operate against the resolutions of the greatest of heroes.  Lord Colambre pursued Lord Colambre way to Castle Halloran, desirous, before Lord Colambre quitted this part of the country, to take leave of the count, who had shown Lord Colambre much civility, and for whose honourable conduct, and generous character, Lord Colambre had conceived a high esteem, which no little peculiarities of antiquated dress or manner could diminish. Indeed, the old-fashioned politeness of what was formerly called a well-bred gentleman pleased Lord Colambre better than the indolent or insolent selfishness of modern men of the ton. Perhaps, notwithstanding our hero's determination to turn Lord Colambre mind from everything connected with the idea of Miss Nugent, some latent curiosity about the burial-place of the Nugents might have operated to make Lord Colambre call upon the count. In this hope Lord Colambre was disappointed; for a cross miller to whom the abbey-ground was set, on which the burial-place was found, had taken the burial-place into Lord Colambre head to refuse admittance, and none could enter the abbey-ground.  Count O'Halloran was much pleased by Lord Colambrevisit. The very day of Lord Colambre arrival at Halloran Castle, the count was going to Lady Oranmore; the count was dressed, and the count carriage was waiting; therefore Lord Colambre begged that Lord Colambre might not detain Lord Colambre, and the count requested Lord Colambre lordship to accompany Lord Colambre.  'Let me have the honour of introducing you, my lord, to a family, with whom, I am persuaded, you will be pleased; by whom you will be appreciated; and at whose house you will have an opportunity of seeing the best manner of living of the Irish nobility.' Lord Colambre accepted the invitation, and was introduced at Lady Oranmore. The dignified appearance and respectable character of Lady Oranmore; the charming unaffected manners of Lady Oranmore daughters; the air of domestic happiness and comfort in Lady Oranmore family; the becoming magnificence, free from ostentation, in Lady Oranmore whole establishment; the respect and affection with which Lady Oranmore was treated by all who approached Lady Oranmore, delighted and touched Lord Colambre; the more, perhaps, because Lord Colambre had heard her family so unjustly abused; and because Lord Colambre saw Lady Dashfort and Lady Dashfort daughter, in immediate contrast to Lady Dashfort and Lady Isabel.  A little circumstance which occurred during Lord Colambre's visit increased Lord Colambre interest for her family. When Lady de Cresey little boys came in after dinner, one of Lady de Cresey's little boys was playing with a seal, which had just been torn from a letter. The child showed The child to Lord Colambre, and asked The child to read the motto. the motto was, 'Deeds, not words'--his friend Sir James Brooke's motto, and his arms. Lord Colambre eagerly inquired if her family was acquainted with Sir James, and Lord Colambre soon perceived that her family were not only acquainted with Lord Colambre, but that her family were particularly interested about Lord Colambre.  Lady Dashfort's second daughter, Lady Harriet, appeared particularly pleased by the manner in which Lord Colambre spoke of Sir James. And the child, who had now established Sir James on Sir James 's knee, turned round, and whispered in Sir James ear, ''Twas Aunt Harriet gave me the seal; Sir James is to be married to Twas Aunt Harriet, and then Sir James will be my uncle.'  Some of the principal gentry of this part of the country the country happened to dine at Lady Oranmore one of the days Lord Colambre was there. Lord Colambre was surprised at the discovery, that there were so many agreeable, well-informed, and well-bred people, of whom, while Lord Colambre was at Killpatrickstown, Lord Colambre had seen nothing. Lord Colambre now discerned how far Lord Colambre had been deceived by Lady Dashfort.  Both the count, and Lord and Lady Oranmore, who were warmly attached to Lord and Lady Oranmore , exhorted Lord Colambre to make Lord Colambre amends for the time Lord Colambre had lost, by seeing with Lord Colambre own eyes, and judging with Lord Colambre own understanding, of the country and its own inhabitants, during the remainder of the time Lord Colambre was to stay in Ireland. The higher classes, in most countries, most countries observed were generally similar; but, in the lower class, Lord Colambre would find many characteristic differences.  When Lord Colambre first came to Ireland, Lord Colambre had been very eager to go and see Lord Colambre father's estate, and to judge of the conduct of Lord Colambre agents, and the condition of Lord Colambre tenantry; but this eagerness had subsided, and the design had almost faded from Lord Colambre mind, whilst under the influence of Lady Dashfort misrepresentations. A mistake, relative to some remittance from Lord Colambre banker in Dublin, obliged Lord Colambre to delay Lord Colambre journey a few days, and during that time Lord and Lady Dashfort showed Lord Colambre the neat cottages, the well-attended schools, in Lord and Lady Oranmore neighbourhood. Lord and Lady Oranmore showed Lord Colambre not only what could be done, but what had been done, by the influence of great proprietors residing on Lord and Lady Oranmore own estates, and encouraging the people by judicious kindness.  Lord Colambre saw, Lord Colambre acknowledged the truth of this; but this did not come home to Lord Colambre feelings now as this would have done a little while ago. Lord Colambre views and plans were altered; Lord Colambre looked forward to the idea of marrying and settling in Ireland, and then everything in the country was interesting to Lord Colambre; but since Lord Colambre had forbidden Lord Colambre to think of a union with Miss Nugent, Lord Colambre mind had lost his mind object and his mind spring; Lord Colambre was not sufficiently calm to think of the public good; Lord Colambre thoughts were absorbed by Lord Colambre private concern. Lord Colambre knew, and repeated to Lord Colambre, that Lord Colambre ought to visit Lord Colambre own and Lord Colambre father's estates, and to see the condition of his tenantryhis tenantry; Lord Colambre desired to fulfil Lord Colambre duties, but he ought to visit his own and his father's estates, and to see the condition of his tenantry ceased to appear to Lord Colambre easy and pleasurable, for hope and love no longer brightened Lord Colambre prospects.  That Lord Colambre might see and hear more than Lord Colambre could as heir-apparent to the estate, Lord Colambre sent Lord Colambre servant to Dublin to wait for Lord Colambre there. Lord Colambre travelled INCOGNITO, wrapped Lord Colambre in a shabby greatcoat, and took the name of Evans. Lord Colambre arrived at a village, or, as it was called, a town, which bore the name of Colambre. Lord Colambre was agreeably surprised by the air of neatness and finish in the houses and in the street, which had a nicely-swept paved footway. Lord Colambre slept at a small but excellent inn--excellent, perhaps, because it was small, and proportioned to the situation and business of the place. Good supper, good bed, good attendance; nothing out of repair; no things pressed into services for what they were never intended by nature or art; none of what are vulgarly called MAKE-SHIFTS. No chambermaid slipshod, or waiter smelling of whisky; but all tight and right, and everybody doing their own business, and doing it as if it was their everyday occupation, not as if it was done by particular desire, for first or last time this season. The landlord came in at supper to inquire whether anything was wanted. Lord Colambre took this opportunity of entering into conversation with Lord Colambre, and asked Lord Colambre to whom the town belonged, and who were the proprietors of the neighbouring estates.  'the town belongs to an absentee lord--one Lord Clonbrony, who lives always beyond the seas, in London; and never seen the town since the town was a town, to call a town.'  'And does the land in the neighbourhood belong to Lord Colambre?'  'Lord Colambre does, sir; sir's a great proprietor, but knows nothing of sir property, nor of us. Never set foot among us, to my knowledge, since I was as high as the table. sir might as well be a West India planter, and we negroes, for anything sir knows to the contrary--has no more care, nor thought about us, than if sir were in Jamaica, or the other world. Shame for him!--But there's too many to keep sir in countenance.'  Lord Colambre asked sir what wine sir could have; and then inquired who managed the estate for this absentee.  'Mr. Burke, sir. And I don't know why God was so kind to give so good an agent to an absentee like Lord Colambre, except it was for the sake of us, who is under sir, and knows the blessing, and is thankful for the same.'  'Very good cutlets,' said Lord Colambre.  'I am happy to hear it, sir. They have a right to be good, for Mrs. Burke sent Mrs. Burke own cook to teach my wife to dress cutlets.'  'So the agent is a good agent, is the agent?'  'the agent is, thanks be to Heaven! And that's what few can boast, especially when The landlord's living over the seas: we have the luck to have got a good agent over we, in Mr. Burke, who is a right bred gentleman; a snug little property of the agent own, honestly made; with the good will and good wishes, and respect of all.'  'Does the agent live in the neighbourhood?'  'Just CONVANIENT [CONVENIENT: near.] At the end of the town; in the house on the hill, as you passed, sir; to the left, with the trees about it, all of sir planting, finely grown too--for there's a blessing on all sir does, and sir has done a deal.--There's salad, sir, if you are partial to it. Very fine lettuce. Mrs. Burke sent us the plants Mrs. Burke.'  'Excellent salad! So Mrs. Burke has done a great deal, has Mrs. Burke? In what way!'  'In every way, sir--sure was not it sir that had improved, and fostered, and made the town of Colambre?--no thanks to the proprietor, nor to the young man whose name it bears, neither!'  'Have you any porter, pray, sir?'  'us have, sir, as good, I hope, as you'd drink in London, for it's the same you get there, I understand, from Cork. And I have some of my own brewing, which, they say, you could not tell the difference between it and Cork quality--if you'd be pleased to try. Harry, the corkscrew.'  The porter of Harry own brewing was pronounced to be extremely good; and The landlord observed it was Mrs. Burke encouraged Mrs. Burke to learn to brew, and lent Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke own brewer for a time to teach Mrs. Burke.  'Mrs. Burke, I find, is APROPOS to porter, APROPOS to salad, APROPOS to cutlets, APROPOS to everything,' said Lord Colambre, smiling; 'Lord Colambre seems to be a NON-PAREIL of an agent. I suppose you are a great favourite of Lord Colambre, and you do what you please with Lord Colambre?'  'Oh no, sir, I could not say that; Mrs. Burke does not have favourites anyway; but according to my deserts, I trust, I stand well enough with Mrs. Burke, for, in truth, Mrs. Burke is a right good agent.'  Lord Colambre still pressed for particulars; Lord Colambre was an Englishman, and a stranger, Lord Colambre said, and did not exactly know what was meant in Ireland by a good agent.  'Why, Lord Colambre is the man that will encourage the improving tenant; and show no favour or affection, but justice, which comes even to all, and does best for all at the long run; and, residing always in the country, like Mrs. Burke, and understanding country business, and going about continually among the tenantry, Lord Colambre knows when to press for the rent, and when to leave the money to lay out upon the land; and, according as they would want the money, can give a tenant a help or a check properly. Then no duty-work called for, no presents, nor GLOVE-MONEY, nor SEALING-MONEY even, taken or offered; no underhand hints about proposals, when land would be out of lease, but a considerable preference, if desArved, to a tenant, and if not, a fair advertisement, and the best offer and tenant accepted; no screwing of the land to the highest penny, just to please the head landlord for the minute, and ruin him at the end, by a tenant's racking the land, and running off with the year's rent; nor no bargains to him own relations or friends did Mrs. Burke ever give or grant, but all fair between landlord and tenant; and that's the thing that will last; and that's what I call the good agent.'  Lord Colambre poured out a glass of wine, and begged the innkeeper to drink the good agent's health, in which Lord Colambre was heartily pledged. 'I thank your honour;--Mr. Mrs. Burke's health! and long may Lord Colambre live over and amongst us; Lord Colambre saved me from drink and ruin, when I was once inclined to it, and made a man of Lord Colambre and all my family.'  The particulars we cannot stay to detail: Lord Colambre, however, took pleasure in sounding the praises of Lord Colambre benefactor, and in raising Lord Colambre in the opinion of the traveller.  'As you've time, and are curious about such things, sir, perhaps you'd walk up to the school that Mrs. Burke has for the poor children; and look at the market-house, and see how clean Lord Colambre takes a pride to keep the town; and any house in the town, from the priest to the parson's, that you'd go into, will give you the same character as I do of Mrs. Burke: from the brogue to the boot, all speak the same of Lord Colambre, and can say no other. God for ever bless and keep Lord Colambre over we!'  Upon making further inquiries, everything the innkeeper had said was confirmed by different inhabitants of the village. Lord Colambre conversed with the shopkeepers, with the cottagers; and, without making any alarming inquiries, Lord Colambre obtained all the information Lord Colambre wanted. Lord Colambre went to the village school--a pretty, cheerful house, with a neat garden and a play-green; met Mrs. Burke; introduced Lord Colambre to Mrs. Burke as a traveller. the village school--a pretty, cheerful house was shown to Lord Colambre: it was just what the village school--a pretty, cheerful house ought to be--neither too much nor too little had been attempted; there was neither too much interference nor too little attention. Nothing for exhibition; care to teach well, without any vain attempt to teach in a wonderfully short time. All that experience proves to be useful, in both Dr. Bell's and Mr. Lancaster's modes of teaching, Mrs. Burke had adopted; leaving it to 'graceless zealots' to fight about the rest. That no attempts at proselytism had been made, and that no illiberal distinctions had been made in the village school--a pretty, cheerful house, Lord Colambre was convinced, in the best manner possible, by seeing the children of Protestants and Catholics sitting on the same benches, learning from the same books, and speaking to one another with the same cordial familiarity. Mrs. Burke was an unaffected, sensible woman, free from all party prejudices, and, without ostentation, desirous and capable of doing good. Lord Colambre was much pleased with Mrs. Burke, and very glad that Mrs. Burke invited Lord Colambre to dinner.  Mrs. Burke did not come in till late; for Mrs. Burke had been detained portioning out some meadows, which were of great consequence to the inhabitants of the town. Mrs. Burke brought home to dine with Mrs. Burke the clergyman and the priest of the parish, both of whom Mrs. Burke had taken successful pains to accommodate with the land which suited both of whom respective convenience. The good terms on which both of whom seemed to be with each other, and with Mrs. Burke, appeared to Lord Colambre to do honour to Mrs. Burke. All the favourable accounts Mrs. Burke lordship had received of GENTLEMAN were confirmed by what his lordship saw and heard. After the clergyman and priest had taken leave, upon Lord Colambre expressing some surprise, mixed with satisfaction, at seeing the harmony which subsisted between the clergyman and priest, Mrs. Burke assured Mrs. Burke that this was the same in many parts of Ireland. Mrs. Burke observed, that 'as the suspicion of ill-will never fails to produce it,' so Mrs. Burke had often found, that taking it for granted that no ill-will exists has the most conciliating effect. Mrs. Burke said, to please opposite parties, Mrs. Burke used no arts; but Mrs. Burke tried to make all Mrs. Burke neighbours live comfortably together, by making opposite parties acquainted with each other's good qualities; by giving opposite parties opportunities of meeting sociably, and, from time to time, of doing each other little services and good offices. 'Fortunately, Mrs. Burke had so much to do,' Mrs. Burke said, 'that Mrs. Burke had no time for controversy. Mrs. Burke was a plain man, made it a rule not to meddle with speculative points, and to avoid all irritating discussions; Mrs. Burke was not to rule the country, but to live in it, and make others live as happily as Mrs. Burke could.'  Having nothing to conceal in Mrs. Burke character, opinions, or circumstances, Mrs. Burke was perfectly open and unreserved in Mrs. Burke manner and conversation; freely answered all the traveller's inquiries, and took pains to show Mrs. Burke everything Mrs. Burke desired to see. Lord Colambre said Lord Colambre had thoughts of settling in Ireland; and declared, with truth, that Lord Colambre had not seen any part of the country Lord Colambre should like better to live in than this neighbourhood. Lord Colambre went over most of the estate with Mrs. Burke, and had ample opportunities of convincing Lord Colambre that GENTLEMAN was indeed, as the innkeeper had described Lord Colambre, 'a right good gentleman, and a right good agent.'  Lord Colambre paid Mrs. Burke some just compliments on the state of the tenantry, and the neat and flourishing appearance of the town of Lord Colambre.  'What pleasure some just compliments on the state of the tenantry, and the neat and flourishing appearance of the town of Colambre will give the proprietor when the proprietor sees all you have done!' said Lord Colambre.  'Oh, sir, don't speak of it!--that breaks my heart, sir never has shown the least interest in anything I have done; sir is quite dissatisfied with Mrs. Burke, because I have not ruined sir tenantry, by forcing them to pay more than the land is worth; because I have not squeezed money from them by fining down rents; and--but all this, as an Englishman, sir, must be unintelligible to you. The end of the matter is, that, attached as I am to this place and the people about Mrs. Burke, and, as I hope, his tenantry are to Mrs. Burke--I fear I shall be obliged to give up the agency.'  'Give up the agency! How so?--you must not,' cried Lord Colambre, and, for the moment, so?--you forgot so?--you; but Mrs. Burke took this only for an expression of good-will.  'I must, I am afraid,' continued Mrs. Burke. 'My employer, Lord Clonbrony, is displeased with Mrs. Burke--continual calls for money come upon Mrs. Burke from England, and complaints of my slow remittances.'  'Perhaps Lord Clonbrony is in embarrassed circumstances said Lord Colambre.  'I never speak of my employer's affairs, sir,' replied Mrs. Burke; now for the first time assuming an air of reserve.  'I beg pardon, sir--I seem to have asked an indiscreet question.' Mrs. Burke was silent.  'Lest reserve should give you a false impression, I will add, sir,' resumed Mrs. Burke, 'that I really am not acquainted with the state of his lordship's affairs in general. I know only what belongs to the estate under my own management. The principal part of his lordship's property, the Clonbrony estate, is under another agent, Mr. Garraghty.'  'Garraghty!' Lord ColambreLord Colambre; 'what sort of a person is a person? But I may take Lord Colambre for granted, that Lord Colambre cannot fall to the lot of one and the same absentee to have two such agents as Mrs. Burke.'  Mrs. Burke bowed, and seemed pleased by the compliment, which Mrs. Burke knew Mrs. Burke deserved--but not a word did Mrs. Burke say of Mr. Garraghty; and Lord Colambre, afraid of betraying Mrs. Burke by some other indiscreet question, changed the conversation.  That very night the post brought a letter to Mrs. Burke, from Lord Clonbrony, which Mrs. Burke gave to Mrs. Burke wife as soon as Mrs. Burke had read a letter, saying--  'See the reward of all my services!'  Mrs. Burke glanced Mrs. Burke eye over a letter, and, being extremely fond of Mrs. Burke husband, and sensible of her husband deserving far different treatment, burst into indignant exclamations--  'See the reward of all your services, indeed!--What an unreasonable, ungrateful man!--So, this is the thanks for all you have done for Lord Clonbrony!'  'her husband does not know what I have done, my dear. her husband never has seen what I have done.'  'More shame for her husband!'  'her husband never, I suppose, looks over her husband accounts, or understands his accounts.'  'More shame for her husband!'  her husband listens to foolish reports, or misrepresentations, perhaps. her husband is at a distance, and cannot find out the truth.'  'More shame for her husband!'  'Take it quietly, my dear; we have the comfort of a good conscience. the agency may be taken from me by Lord Clonbrony; but the sense of having done my duty, no lord or man upon earth can give or take away.'  'Such a letter!' said Mrs. Burke, taking Such a letter up again. 'Not even the civility to write with Mrs. Burke own hand!--only Mrs. Burke signature to the scrawl--looks as if it was written by a drunken man, does not it was written by a drunken man, Mr. Evans?' said Mrs. Burke, showing the letter to Lord Colambre, who immediately recognised the writing of Sir Terence O'Fay.  'It does not look like the hand of a gentleman, indeed,' said Lord Colambre.  'It has Lord Clonbrony own signature, let It be what It will,' said Mrs. Burke, looking closely at It; 'Lord Clonbrony own writing Lord Clonbrony's own signature is, I am clear of that.'  Lord Clonbrony's son was clear of Lord Clonbrony also; but Lord Clonbrony's son took care not to give any opinion on that point.  'Oh, pray, read it, sir, read it,' said Mrs. Burke, pleased by sir tone of indignation; 'read it, pray; no GENTLEMAN may write a bad hand, but no GENTLEMAN could write such a letter as that to Mrs. Burke--pray read it, sir; you who have seen something of what Mrs. Burke has done for the town of Colambre, and what Mrs. Burke has made of the tenantry and the estate of Lord Clonbrony.'  Lord Colambre read, and was convinced that Lord Colambre father had never written or read a letter, but had signed a letter, trusting to Sir Terence O'Fay's having expressed Sir Terence O'Fay sentiments properly.  sir, As I have no further occasion for your services, you will take notice, that I hereby request you will forthwith hand over, on or before the 1st of November next, your accounts, with the balance due of the HANGING-GALE (which, I understand, is more than ought to be at this season) to Nicholas O'Garraghty, Esq., College Green, Dublin, who in future will act as agent, and shall get, by post, immediately, a power of attorney for the same, entitling him to receive and manage the Colambre as well as the Clonbrony estate, for, Sir, your obedient humble servant, CLONBRONY.  'GROSVENOR SQUARE.'  Though misrepresentation, caprice, or interest, might have induced Lord Clonbrony to desire to change Lord Clonbrony agent, yet Lord Colambre knew that his father never could have announced his father wishes in such a style; and, as his father returned the letter to Mrs. Burke, Lord Colambre repeated, Lord Colambre was convinced that it was impossible that any nobleman could have written such a letter; that it was impossible that any nobleman could have written such a letter must have been written by some inferior person; and that any nobleman had signed it was impossible that any nobleman could have written such a letter without reading it was impossible that any nobleman could have written such a letter.  'my dear, I'm sorry you showed the letter to Mrs. Burke to Mr. Evans,' said Mrs. Burke; 'I don't like to expose Lord Clonbrony; Lord Clonbrony is a well-meaning gentleman, misled by ignorant or designing people; at all events, it is not for us to expose Lord Clonbrony.'  'Lord Clonbrony has exposed Lord Clonbrony,' said Mrs. Burke; 'and the world should know it.'  'Lord Clonbrony was very kind to Mr. Evans when I was a young man,' said Mrs. Burke; 'we must not forget that now, because we are angry, my love.'  'Why, no, my love, to be sure we should not; but who could have recollected it just at this minute but yourself?--And now, sir,' turning to Lord Colambre, 'you see what kind of a man this is: now is it not difficult for me to bear patiently to see a man this is ill-treated?'  'Not only difficult, but impossible, I should think, madam,' said Lord Colambre; 'I know, even I, who am a stranger, cannot help feeling for both of Lord Colambre, as you must see I do.'  'And half the world, who don't know Lord Colambre,' continued Mrs. Burke, 'when half the world, who don't know him,' continued Mrs. Burke, ' hear that Lord Clonbrony agency is taken from Lord Clonbrony, will think, perhaps, that Lord Clonbrony is to blame.'  'No, madam,' said Lord Colambre; 'that you need not fear; Mrs. Burke may safely trust to Mrs. Burke character; from what I have within these two days seen and heard, I am convinced that such is the respect Mrs. Burke has deserved and acquired, that no blame can touch Mrs. Burke.'  'sir, I thank you,' said Mrs. Burke, the tears coming into her eyes; 'you can judge--you do sir justice; but there are so many who don't know sir, and who will decide without knowing any of the facts.'  'That, my dear, happens about everything to everybody,' said Mrs. Burke; 'but we must have patience; time sets all judgments right, sooner or later.'  'But the sooner the better,' said Mrs. Burke. 'Mr. Evans, I hope you will be so kind, if ever you hear this business talked of--'  'Mr. Evans lives in Wales, my dear.'  But Mr. Evans is travelling through Ireland, my dear, and Mr. Evans said Mr. Evans should return to Dublin, and, you know, there Mr. Evans certainly will hear it talked of; and I hope Mr. Evans will do me the favour to state what Mr. Evans has seen and knows to be the truth.'  'Be assured that I will do Mr. Burke justice--as far as it is in my power,' said Lord Colambre, restraining Lord Colambre much, that Lord Colambre might not say more than became Lord Colambre assumed character. Lord Colambre took leave of this worthy family that night, and, early the next morning, departed.  'Ah!' thought Lord Colambre, as Lord Colambre drove away from this well-regulated and flourishing place, 'how happy I might be, settled here with such a wife as--her of whom I must think no more.'  Lord Colambre pursued Lord Colambre way to Clonbrony, Lord Colambre father's other estate, which was at a considerable distance from Lord Colambre; Lord Colambre was resolved to know what kind of agent Mr. Garraghty might be, who was to supersede Mrs. Burke, and by power of attorney to be immediately entitled to receive and manage the Colambre as well as the Clonbrony estate.
