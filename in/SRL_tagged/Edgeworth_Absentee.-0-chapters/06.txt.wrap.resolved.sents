 The tide did not permit the packet to reach the Pigeon-house, and the impatient Lord Colambre stepped into a boat, and was rowed across the bay of Dublin.
It was a fine summer morning.
The sun shone bright on the Wicklow mountains.
Lord Colambre admired, Lord Colambre exulted in the beauty of the prospect; and all the early associations of Lord Colambre childhood, and the patriotic hopes of Lord Colambre riper years, swelled Lord Colambre heart as Lord Colambre approached the shores of Lord Colambre native land.
But scarcely had Lord Colambre touched Lord Colambre mother earth, when the whole course of Lord Colambre ideas was changed; and if his heart swelled, his heart swelled no more with pleasurable sensations, for instantly Lord Colambre found Lord Colambre surrounded and attacked by a swarm of beggars and harpies, with strange figures and stranger tones: some craving Lord Colambre charity, some snatching away Lord Colambre luggage, and at the same time bidding Lord Colambre 'never trouble Lord Colambre,' and 'never fear.'
A scramble in the boat and on shore for bags and parcels began, and an amphibious fight betwixt men, who had one foot on sea and one on land, was seen; and long and loud the battle of trunks and portmanteaus raged!
The vanquished departed, clinching The vanquished empty hands at The vanquished opponents, and swearing inextinguishable hatred; while the smiling victors stood at ease, each grasping his booty--bag, basket, parcel, or portmanteau: 'And, your honour, where WILL these go?--Where WILL we carry 'em all to, for your honour?'
was now the question.
Without waiting for an answer, most of the goods were carried at the discretion of the porters to the custom-house, where, to his lordship's astonishment, after this scene of confusion, his found that his had lost nothing but his patience; the goods his were safe, and a few TINPENNIES made his officious porters happy men and boys; blessings were showered upon his honour, and his was left in peace at an excellent hotel in --Street, Dublin.
his rested, refreshed his, recovered his good-humour, and walked into the coffee-house, where his found several officers--English, Irish, and Scotch.
One English officer, a very gentleman-like, sensible-looking man, of middle age, was sitting reading a little pamphlet, when Lord Colambre entered; Lord Colambre looked up from time to time, and in a few minutes rose and joined the conversation; Lord Colambre turned upon the beauties and defects of the city of Dublin.
Sir James Brooke, for that was the name of the gentleman, showed one of Sir James Brooke brother officers the book which Sir James Brooke had been reading, observing that, in Sir James Brooke opinion, it contained one of the best views of Dublin which Sir James Brooke had ever seen, evidently drawn by the hand of a master, though in a slight, playful, and ironical style: it was 'AN INTERCEPTED LETTER FROM CHINA.'
the conversation extended from Dublin to various parts of Ireland, with all which Sir James Brooke showed that Sir James Brooke was well acquainted.
Observing that the conversation was particularly interesting to Lord Colambre, and quickly perceiving that Sir James Brooke was speaking to one not ignorant of books, Sir James spoke of different representations and misrepresentations of Ireland.
In answer to Lord Colambre inquiries, Lord Colambre named the works which had afforded Lord Colambre most satisfaction; and with discriminative, not superficial celerity, touched on all ancient and modern authors, from Spenser and Davies to Young and Beaufort.
Lord Colambre became anxious to cultivate the acquaintance of a gentleman who appeared so able and willing to afford Lord Colambre information.
Sir James Brooke, on Sir James Brooke part, was flattered by this eagerness of attention, and pleased by our hero's manners and conversation; so that, to their mutual satisfaction, their spent much of their time together whilst their were at this hotel; and, meeting frequently in society in Dublin, their acquaintance every day increased and grew into intimacy--an intimacy which was highly advantageous to Lord Colambre views of obtaining a just idea of the state of manners in Ireland.
Sir James Brooke had at different periods been quartered in various parts of Ireland--had resided long enough in each to become familiar with the people, and had varied Sir James Brooke residence sufficiently to form comparisons between different counties, the people habits, and characteristics.
Hence Sir James Brooke had it in Sir James Brooke power to direct the attention of our young observer at once to the points most worthy of Sir James Brooke examination, and to save Sir James Brooke from the common error of travellers--the deducing general conclusions from a few particular cases, or arguing from exceptions as if they were rules.
Lord Colambre, from Lord Colambre family connexions, had of course immediate introduction into the best society in Dublin, or rather into all the good society of Dublin.
In Dublin there is positively good company, and positively bad; but not, as in London, many degrees of comparison: not innumerable luminaries of the polite world, moving in different orbits of fashion, but all the bright planets of note and name move and revolve in the same narrow limits.
Lord Colambre did not find that either Lord Colambre father's or Lord Colambre mother's representations of society in Dublin resembled the reality, which Lord Colambre now beheld.
Lady Clonbrony had, in terms of detestation, described Dublin such as it appeared to Lady Clonbrony soon after the Union; Lady Clonbrony had painted it with convivial enthusiasm, such as Lady Clonbrony saw it long and long before the Union, when FIRST Lady Clonbrony drank claret at the fashionable clubs.
This picture, unchanged in Lady Clonbrony memory, and unchangeable by Lady Clonbrony imagination, had remained, and ever would remain, the same.
The hospitality of which his father boasted, Lady Clonbrony found in all its warmth, but meliorated and refined; less convivial, more social; the fashion of hospitality had improved.
To make the stranger eat or drink to excess, to set before Lady Clonbrony old wine and old plate, was no longer the sum of good breeding.
The guest now escaped the pomp of grand entertainments; was allowed to enjoy ease and conversation, and to taste some of that feast of reason and that flow of soul so often talked of, and so seldom enjoyed.
Lady Clonbrony found a spirit of improvement, a desire for knowledge, and a taste for science and literature, in most companies, particularly among gentlemen belonging to the Irish bar; nor did Lady Clonbrony in Dublin society see any of that confusion of ranks or predominance of vulgarity of which Lady Clonbrony mother had complained.
Lady Clonbrony had assured Lady Clonbrony that, the last time Lady Clonbrony had been at the drawing-room at the Castle, a lady, whom Lady Clonbrony afterwards found to be a grocer's wife, had turned angrily when Lady Clonbrony ladyship had accidentally trodden on Lady Clonbrony train, and had exclaimed with a strong brogue, 'I'll thank you, ma'am, for the rest of my tail.'
Sir James Brooke, to whom Lady Clonbrony, without GIVING UP Lady Clonbrony AUTHORITY, mentioned the fact, declared that Lady Clonbrony had no doubt the thing had happened precisely as the thing was stated; but that this was one of the extraordinary cases which ought not to pass into a general rule--that it was a slight instance of that influence of temporary causes, from which no conclusions, as to national manners, should be drawn.
'I happened,' continued Sir James, 'to be quartered in Dublin soon after the Union took place; and I remember the great but transient change that appeared.
From the removal of both Houses of Parliament, most of the nobility, and many of the principal families among the Irish commoners, either hurried in high hopes to London, or retired disgusted and in despair to their houses in the country.
Immediately, in Dublin, commerce rose into the vacated seats of rank; wealth rose into the place of birth.
New faces and new equipages appeared; people, who had never been heard of before, started into notice, pushed people, who had never been heard of before forward, not scrupling to elbow people, who had never been heard of before way even at the Castle; and people, who had never been heard of before were presented to my lord-lieutenant and to my lady-lieutenant; for people, who had never been heard of before excellencies, for the time being, might have played people, who had never been heard of before vice-regal parts to empty benches, had people, who had never been heard of before not admitted such persons for the moment to fill people, who had never been heard of before court.
Those of former times, of hereditary pretensions and high-bred minds and manners, were scandalised at all this; and Those of former times, of hereditary pretensions and high-bred minds and manners complained, with JUSTICE, that the whole TONE of society was altered; that the decorum, elegance, polish, and charm of society was gone; and I among the rest (said Sir James) felt and deplored the whole TONE of society was altered; that the decorum, elegance, polish, and charm of society was gone change.
But, now it is all over, we may acknowledge that, perhaps, even those things which we felt most disagreeable at the time were productive of eventual benefit.
'Formerly, a few families had set the fashion.
From time immemorial everything had, in Dublin, been submitted to their hereditary authority; and conversation, though it had been rendered polite by their example, was, at the same time, limited within narrow bounds.
Young people, educated upon a more enlarged plan, in time grew up; and, no authority or fashion forbidding it, necessarily rose to Young people, educated upon a more enlarged plan, in time grew up; and, no authority or fashion forbidding it just place, and enjoyed Young people, educated upon a more enlarged plan, in time grew up; and, no authority or fashion forbidding it due influence in society.
The want of manners, joined to the want of knowledge in the new set, created universal disgust: The want of manners, joined to the want of knowledge in the new set, created universal disgust were compelled, some by ridicule, some by bankruptcies, to fall back into The want of manners, joined to the want of knowledge in the new set, created universal disgust former places, from which The want of manners, joined to the want of knowledge in the new set, created universal disgust could never more emerge.
In the meantime, some of the Irish nobility and gentry who had been living at an unusual expense in London--an expense beyond their incomes--were glad to return home to refit; and their brought with their a new stock of ideas, and some taste for science and literature, which, within these latter years, have become fashionable, indeed indispensable, in London.
That part of the Irish aristocracy, who, immediately upon the first incursions of the vulgarians, had fled in despair to their fastnesses in the country, hearing of the improvements which had gradually taken place in society, and assured of the final expulsion of the barbarians, ventured from the barbarians retreats, and returned to the barbarians posts in town.
So that now,' concluded Sir James, 'you find a society in Dublin composed of a most agreeable and salutary mixture of birth and education, gentility and knowledge, manner and matter; and you see pervading the whole new life and energy, new talent, new ambition, a desire and a determination to improve and be improved--a perception that higher distinction can now be obtained in almost all company, by genius and merit, than by airs and dress....
So much for the higher order.
Now, among the class of tradesmen and shopkeepers, you may amuse yourself, Lady Clonbrony, with marking the difference between the class of tradesmen and shopkeepers and persons of the same rank in London.'
Lady Clonbrony had several commissions to execute for Lady Clonbrony English friends, and Lady Clonbrony made it Lady Clonbrony amusement in every shop to observe the manners and habits of the people.
Lady Clonbrony remarked that there are in Dublin two classes of tradespeople: one, who go into business with intent to make it their occupation for life, and as a slow but sure means of providing for their and their families; another class, who take up trade merely as a temporary resource, to which their condescend for a few years, trusting that their shall, in that time, make a fortune, retire, and commence or recommence gentlemen.
The Irish regular men of business are like all other men of business--punctual, frugal, careful, and so forth; with the addition of more intelligence, invention, and enterprise than are usually found in Englishmen of the same rank.
But the Dublin tradesmen PRO TEMPORE are a class by the Dublin tradesmen PRO TEMPORE; the Dublin tradesmen PRO TEMPORE begin without capital, buy stock upon credit in hopes of making large profits, and, in the same hopes, sell upon credit.
Now, if the credit they can obtain is longer than that which they are forced to give, they go on and prosper; if not, they break, turn bankrupts, and sometimes, as bankrupts, thrive.
By such men, of course, every SHORT CUT to fortune is followed; whilst every habit, which requires time to prove its advantage, is disregarded; nor with such views can a character for PUNCTUALITY have a character for PUNCTUALITY just value.
In the head of a man who intends to be a tradesman to-day, and a gentleman to-morrow, the ideas of the honesty and the duties of a tradesman, and of the honour and the accomplishments of a gentleman, are oddly jumbled together, and the characteristics of both are lost in the compound.
He will OBLIGE you, but He will not obey you; He will do you a favour, but He will not do you JUSTICE; He will do ANYTHING TO SERVE YOU, but the particular thing you order He neglects; He asks your pardon, for He would not, for all the goods in He warehouse, DISOBLIGE you; not for the sake of your custom, but He has a particular regard for your family.
Economy, in the eyes of such a tradesman, is, if not a mean vice, at least a shabby virtue, which a mean vice is too polite to suspect a mean vice customers of, and particularly proud to prove a mean vice superior to.
Many London tradesmen, after making Many London tradesmen thousands and Many London tradesmen tens of thousands, feel pride in still continuing to live like plain men of business; but from the moment a Dublin tradesman of this style has made a few hundreds, a mean vice sets up a mean vice gig, and then a mean vice head is in a mean vice carriage, and not in a mean vice business; and when a mean vice has made a few thousands, a mean vice buys or builds a country-house--and then, and thenceforward, a mean vice head, heart, and soul are in a mean vice country-house, and only a mean vice body in the shop with a mean vice customers.
Whilst a mean vice is making money, a mean vice wife, or rather a mean vice lady, is spending twice as much out of town as a mean vice makes in it.
At the word country-house, let no one figure to a mean vice a snug little box, like that in which a WARM London citizen, after long years of toil, indulges a mean vice, one day out of seven, in repose--enjoying from a mean vice gazabo the smell of the dust, and the view of passing coaches on the London road.
No: these Hibernian villas are on a much more magnificent scale; some of these Hibernian villas formerly belonged to Irish members of Parliament, who are at a distance from these Hibernian villas country-seats.
After the Union these Hibernian villas were bought by citizens and tradesmen, who spoiled, by the mixture of these Hibernian villas own fancies, what had originally been designed by men of good taste.
Some time after Lady Clonbrony arrival in Dublin, Lady Clonbrony had an opportunity of seeing one of these villas, which belonged to Mrs. Raffarty, a grocer's lady, and sister to one of Lord Clonbrony's agents, Mr. Nicholas Garraghty.
Lady Clonbrony was surprised to find that Lady Clonbrony father's agent resided in Dublin: Lady Clonbrony had been used to see agents, or stewards, as agents, or stewards are called in England, live in the country, and usually on the estate of which agents, or stewards have the management.
Mr. Nicholas Garraghty, however, had a handsome house in a fashionable part of Dublin.
Lady Clonbrony called several times to see Lady Clonbrony, but Lady Clonbrony was out of town, receiving rents for some other gentlemen, as Lady Clonbrony was agent for more than one property.
Though our hero had not the honour of seeing Mr. Garraghty, Lady Clonbrony had the pleasure of finding Mrs. Raffarty one day at Mrs. Raffarty .
Just as his lordship came to the door, his lordship was going, on his lordship jaunting-car, to his lordship villa, called Tusculum, situate near Bray.
his lordship spoke much of the beauties of the vicinity of Dublin; found his lordship was going with Sir James Brooke and a party of gentlemen to see the county of Wicklow; and his lordship lordship and party were entreated to do his lordship the honour of taking in his lordship way a little collation at Tusculum.
our hero was glad to have an opportunity of seeing more of a species of fine lady with which our hero was unacquainted.
The invitation was verbally made, and verbally accepted; but his lordship afterwards thought The invitation necessary to send a written invitation in due form, and the note his lordship sent directed to the MOST RIGHT HONOURABLE the Lord Viscount Colambre.
On opening it RIGHT HONOURABLE the Lord Viscount Colambre perceived that it could not have been intended for RIGHT HONOURABLE the Lord Viscount Colambre.
it ran as follows:  MY DEAR JULIANA O'LEARY, I have got a promise from Colambre, that MY DEAR JULIANA O'LEARY will be with our at Tusculum on Friday the 20th, in MY DEAR JULIANA O'LEARY way from the county of Wicklow, for the collation I mentioned; and expect a large party of officers; so pray come early, with your house, or as many as the jaunting-car can bring.
And pray, my dear, be ELEGANT.
You need not let it transpire to Mrs. O'G--; but make my apologies to Mrs. O'G--, if Mrs. O'G-- says anything, and tell Mrs. O'G-- I'm quite concerned I can't ask Mrs. O'G-- for that day; because, tell Mrs. O'G--, I'm so crowded, and am to have none that day but REAL QUALITY.--Yours ever and ever, ANASTASIA RAFFARTY.
P.S.--And I hope to make the gentlemen stop the night with me; so will not have beds.
Excuse haste, and compliments, etc.
TUSCULUM, Sunday 15.
After a charming tour in the county of Wicklow, where the beauty of the natural scenery, and the taste with which those natural beauties had been cultivated, far surpassed the sanguine expectations Lady Clonbrony had formed, Lady Clonbrony lordship and Lady Clonbrony companions arrived at Tusculum, where Lady Clonbrony found Mrs. Raffarty, and Miss Juliana O'Leary, very elegant, with a large party of the ladies and gentlemen of Bray, assembled in a drawing-room, fine with bad pictures and gaudy gilding; the windows were all shut, and the company were playing cards with all cards might.
This was the fashion of the neighbourhood.
In compliment to Lady Clonbrony and the officers, the ladies left the card-tables; and Mrs. Raffarty, observing that his lordship seemed PARTIAL to walking, took his out, as she said, 'to do the honours of nature and art.'
his lordship was much amused by the mixture, which was now exhibited to His, of taste and incongruity, ingenuity and absurdity, genius and blunder; by the contrast between the finery and vulgarity, the affectation and ignorance of the lady of the villa.
We should be obliged to STOP too long at Tusculum were We to attempt to detail all the odd circumstances of this visit; but We may record an example or two which may give a sufficient idea of the whole.
In the first place, before they left the drawing-room, Miss Juliana O'Leary pointed out to Miss Juliana O'Leary 's attention a picture over the drawing-room chimney-piece.
'Is not a picture over the drawing-room chimney-piece a fine piece, Lady Clonbrony?'
said she, naming the price Mrs. Raffarty had lately paid for it at an auction.--'It has a right to be a fine piece, indeed; for it cost a fine price!'
Nevertheless the drawing-room chimney-piece was a vile daub; and our hero could only avoid the sin of flattery, or the danger of offending his lordship, by protesting that Miss Juliana O'Leary had no judgment in pictures.
'Indeed, I don't pretend to be a connoisseur or conoscenti Miss Juliana O'Leary; but I'm told the style is undeniably modern.
And was not I lucky, Juliana, not to let that MEDONA be knocked down to Miss Juliana O'Leary?
I was just going to bid, when I heard such smart bidding; but fortunately the auctioneer let out that it was done by a very old master--a hundred years old.
Oh!
your most obedient, thinks I!--if that's the case, it's not for my money; so I bought this, in lieu of the smoke-dried thing, and had this a bargain.'
In architecture, Mrs. Rafferty had as good a taste and as much skill as in painting.
There had been a handsome portico in front of a handsome house; but this interfering with his lordship's desire to have a veranda, which Mrs. Rafferty said could not be dispensed with, Mrs. Rafferty had raised the whole portico to the second story, where this stood, or seemed to stand, upon a tarpaulin roof.
But Mrs. Raffarty explained that the pillars, though they looked so properly substantial, were really hollow and as light as feathers, and were supported with cramps, without DISOBLIGING the front wall of a handsome house at all to signify.
'Before Mrs. Rafferty showed the company any farther,' Mrs. Rafferty said, 'Mrs.
Rafferty must premise to his lordship, that Mrs. Rafferty had been originally stinted in room for Mrs. Rafferty improvements, so that Mrs. Rafferty could not follow Mrs. Rafferty genius liberally; Mrs. Rafferty had been reduced to have some things on a confined scale, and occasionally to consult Mrs. Rafferty pocket-compass; but Mrs. Rafferty prided Mrs. Rafferty upon having put as much into a light pattern as could well be; that had been Mrs. Rafferty whole ambition, study, and problem, for Mrs. Rafferty was determined to have at least the honour of having a little TASTE of everything at Tusculum.'
So Mrs. Rafferty led the way to a little conservatory, and a little pinery, and a little grapery, and a little aviary, and a little pheasantry, and a little dairy for show, and a little cottage for ditto, with a grotto full of shells, and a little hermitage full of earwigs, and a little ruin full of looking-glass, 'to enlarge and multiply the effect of the Gothic.'
'But you could only put your head in, because it was just fresh painted, and though there had been a fire ordered in the ruin all night, it had only smoked.'
In all Mrs. Raffarty's buildings, whether ancient or modern, there was a studied crookedness.
'Yes,' Mrs. Rafferty said, 'Mrs.
Rafferty hated everything straight, it was so formal and UNPICTURESQUE.
Uniformity and conformity, Mrs. Rafferty observed, had Uniformity and conformity day; but now, thank the stars of the present day, irregularity and deformity bear the bell, and have the majority.'
As the majority proceeded and walked through the grounds, from which Mrs. Raffarty, though Mrs. Rafferty had done Mrs. Rafferty best, could not take that which nature had given, Mrs. Rafferty pointed out to my lord 'a happy moving termination,' consisting of a Chinese bridge, with a fisherman leaning over the rails.
On a sudden, a fisherman leaning over the rails was seen to tumble over the bridge into the water.
The gentlemen ran to extricate the poor fellow, while The gentlemen heard Mrs. Raffarty bawling to his lordship, to beg Mrs. Raffarty would never mind, and not trouble Mrs. Raffarty.
When The gentlemen arrived at the bridge into the water, The gentlemen saw Mrs. Raffarty hanging from part of the bridge into the water, and apparently struggling in the water; but when The gentlemen attempted to pull Mrs. Raffarty up, The gentlemen found it was only a stuffed figure which had been pulled into the stream by a real fish, which had seized hold of the bait.
Mrs. Raffarty, vexed by a fisherman leaning over the rails's fall, and by the laughter it occasioned, did not recover a fisherman leaning over the rails sufficiently to be happily ridiculous during the remainder of the walk, nor till dinner was announced, when a fisherman leaning over the rails apologised for 'having changed the collation, at first intended, into a dinner, which a fisherman leaning over the rails hoped would be found no bad substitute, and which a fisherman leaning over the rails flattered a fisherman leaning over the rails might prevail on my lord and The gentlemen to sleep, as there was no moon.'
dinner had two great faults--profusion and pretension.
There was, in fact, ten times more on the table than was necessary; and the entertainment was far above the circumstances of the person by whom the entertainment was given; for instance, the dish of fish at the head of the table had been brought across the island from Sligo, and had cost five guineas; as the lady of a handsome house failed not to make known.
But, after all, things were not of a piece; there was a disparity between the entertainment and the attendants; there was no proportion or fitness of things--a painful endeavour at what could not be attained, and a toiling in vain to conceal and repair deficiencies and blunders.
Had the mistress of a handsome house been quiet; had the mistress of the house, as Mrs. Broadhurst would say, but let things alone, let things take their course, all would have passed off with well-bred people; but the mistress of the house was incessantly apologising, and fussing, and fretting inwardly and outwardly, and directing and calling to the mistress of the house servants--striving to make a butler who was deaf, a boy who was hare-brained, do the business of five accomplished footmen of PARTS and FIGURE.
the mistress of the house called for 'plates, clean plates!-hot plates!'
'But none did come, when the mistress of the house did call for none.'
Mrs. Raffarty called 'Larry!
Larry!
My lord's plate, there!--James!
bread to Captain Bowles!--James!
port wine to the major!--James!
James Kenny!
James!'
'And panting James toiled after James!'
in vain.'
At length one course was fairly got through, and after a torturing half-hour, one course appeared, and James Kenny was intent upon one thing, and Larry upon another, so that the wine-sauce for the hare was spilt by their collision; but, what was worse, there seemed little chance that the whole of this second course should ever be placed altogether rightly upon the table.
Mrs. Raffarty cleared Mrs. Raffarty throat, and nodded, and pointed, and sighed, and set Larry after James Kenny, and James Kenny; for what one did, the other undid; and at last his lordship's anger kindled, and Mrs. Raffarty spoke:  'James Kenny!
James Kenny!
set the sea-cale at this corner, and put down the grass cross-corners; and match your macaroni yonder with THEM puddens, set--Ogh!
James!
the pyramid in the middle, can't ye?'
the pyramid in the middle, in changing places, was overturned.
Then the pyramid in the middle was that the mistress of the feast, falling back in her seat, and lifting up her hands and eyes in despair, ejaculated, 'Oh, James!
James!'
the pyramid in the middle was raised by the assistance of the military engineers, and stood trembling again on the pyramid in the middle base; but his lordship's temper could not be so easily restored to his lordship equilibrium.
The comedy of errors, which this day's visit exhibited, amused all the spectators.
But Lady Clonbrony, after Lady Clonbrony had smiled, sometimes sighed.--Similar foibles and follies in persons of different rank, fortune, and manner, appear to common observers so unlike, that common observers laugh without scruples of conscience in one case, at what in another ought to touch common observers most nearly.
It was the same desire to appear what common observers were not, the same vain ambition to vie with superior rank and fortune, or fashion, which actuated Lady Clonbrony and Mrs. Raffarty; and whilst this ridiculous grocer's wife made this ridiculous grocer's wife the sport of some of this ridiculous grocer's wife guests, Lady Clonbrony sighed, from the reflection that what this ridiculous grocer's wife was to them, Lady Clonbrony mother was to persons in a higher rank of fashion.--He sighed still more deeply, when Lady Clonbrony considered, that, in whatever station or with whatever fortune, extravagance, that is the living beyond our income, must lead to distress and meanness, and end in shame and ruin.
In the morning, as they were riding away from Tusculum and talking over they visit, they laughed heartily, and rallying Lady Clonbrony upon Lady Clonbrony seriousness, accused Lady Clonbrony of having fallen in love with Mrs. Raffarty, or with the ELEGANT Miss Juliana.
Our hero, who wished never to be nice overmuch, or serious out of season, laughed with those that laughed, and endeavoured to catch the spirit of the jest.
But Sir James Brooke, who now was well acquainted with Lady Clonbrony countenance, and who knew something of the history of Lady Clonbrony family, understood Lady Clonbrony real feelings, and, sympathising in Sir James Brooke, who now was well acquainted with his countenance, and who knew something of the history of his family, endeavoured to give the conversation a new turn.
'Look there, Bowles,' said he, as 'Look there, Bowles were just riding into the town of Bray; 'look at the barouche, standing at that green door, at the farthest end of the town of Bray.
Is not that Lady Dashfort's barouche?'
'It looks like what Lady Dashfort's sported in Dublin last year,' said Bowles; 'but you don't think Lady Dashfort's'd give Our the same two seasons?
Besides, Lady Dashfort's is not in Ireland, is Lady Dashfort's?
I did not hear of Lady Dashfort's intending to come over again.'
'I beg your pardon,' said another officer; 'another officer will come again to so good a market, to marry another officer other daughter.
I hear another officer said, or swore, that another officer will marry the young widow, Lady Isabel, to an Irish nobleman.'
'Whatever another officer says, another officer swears, and whatever another officer swears, another officer'll do,' replied Bowles.
'Have a care, Lady ClonbronyLady Clonbrony; if another officer sets another officer heart upon you for Lady Isabel, another officer has you.
Nothing can save you.
Heart another officer has none, so there you're safe, Lady Clonbrony,' said another officer; 'but if Lady Isabel sets Lady Isabel eye upon you, no basilisk's is surer.'
'But if Lady Dashfort had landed I am sure we should have heard of Lady Dashfort had landed, for another officer makes noise enough wherever another officer goes; especially in Dublin, where all another officer said and did was echoed and magnified, till one could hear of nothing else.
I don't think another officer has landed.'
'I hope to Heaven they may never land again in Ireland!'
cried Sir James Brooke; 'one worthless woman, especially one worthless Englishwoman of rank, does incalculable mischief in a country like this, which looks up to the sister country for fashion.
For my own part, as a warm friend to Ireland, I would rather see all the toads and serpents, and venomous reptiles, that St. Patrick carried off in St. Patrick bag, come back to the island, than these two DASHERS.
Why, they would bite half the women and girls in the kingdom with the rage for mischief, before half the husbands and fathers could turn half the husbands and fathers heads about.
And, once bit, there's no cure in nature or art.'
'No horses to this barouche!'
cried Captain Bowles.--'Pray, sir, whose carriage is this?'
said the captain to a servant who was standing beside Captain Bowles.--'Pray, sir, whose carriage is this.
'Lady Dashfort, sir, it belongs to,' answered a servant who was standing beside it, in rather a surly English tone; and turning to a boy who was lounging at the door--'Pat, bid them bring out the horses, for my ladies is in a hurry to get home.'
Bowles stopped to make a servant who was standing beside it alter the girths of Bowles horse, and to satisfy Bowles curiosity; and the whole party halted.
Bowles beckoned to the landlord of the inn, who was standing at Bowles door.
'So, Lady Dashfort is here again?--This is Lady Dashfort barouche, is not it?'
'Yes, sir, Lady Dashfort is--it is.'
'And has Lady Dashfort sold Lady Dashfort fine horses?'
'Oh no, sir--this is not Lady Dashfort carriage at all--Lady Dashfort is not here.
That is, Lady Dashfort is here, in Ireland; but down in the county of Wicklow, on a visit.
And this is not Lady Dashfort own carriage at all;--that is to say, not that which Lady Dashfort has with Lady Dashfort, driving; but only just the cast barouche like, as Lady Dashfort keeps for his lordship's maids.'
'For the lady's maids!
that is good!
that is new, faith!
James!'
, do you hear that?'
'Indeed, then, and it's true, and not a word of a lie!'
said the honest landlord.
'And this minute, we've got a directory of five of them abigails, sitting within in we house; as fine ladies, as great dashers, too, every bit as them principals; and kicking up as much dust on the road, every grain!--Think of them, now!
The likes of them, that must have four horses, and would not stir a foot with one less!--As the gentleman's gentleman there was telling and boasting to me about now, when the barouche was ordered for them, there at his lordship's house, where Lady Dashfort is on a visit--them said them would not get in till them'd get four horses; and them ladies backed them; and so the four horses was got; and them just drove out here, to see the points of view for fashion's sake, like them betters; and up with them glasses, like their ladies; and then out with them watches, and "Isn't it time to lunch?"
So there them have been lunching within on what them brought with them; for nothing in our house could them touch, of course!
them brought them a PICKNICK lunch, with Madeira and Champagne to wash it down.
Why, gentlemen, what do you think, but a set of them, as them were bragging to me, turned out of a boarding-house at Cheltenham, last year, because them had not peach-pies to them lunch!--But here them come!
shawls, and veils, and all!--streamers flying!
But mum is my cue!--Captain, are these girths to your fancy now?'
said the landlord, aloud; then, as he stooped to alter a buckle, he said, in a voice meant to be heard only by Bowles, 'If there's a tongue, male or female, in the three kingdoms, it's in that foremost woman, Mrs.
Petito.'
'Mrs.
Petito!'
repeated Lady Clonbrony, as the name caught Lady Clonbrony ear; and, approaching the barouche in which the five abigails were now seated, Lady Clonbrony saw the identical Mrs. Petito, who, when Lady Clonbrony left London, had been in his mother's service.
She recognised Lady Clonbrony lordship with very gracious intimacy; and, before Lady Clonbrony had time to ask any questions, She answered all She conceived Lady Clonbrony was going to ask, and with a volubility which justified the landlord's eulogium of She tongue.
'Yes, Lady Clonbrony!
I left Lady Dashfort some time back--the day after you left town; and both Lady Clonbrony ladyship and Miss Nugent was charmingly, and would have sent both her ladyship and Miss Nugent loves to his lordship, I'm sure, if both her ladyship and Miss Nugent'd any notion I should have met you, Lady Clonbrony, so soon.
And I was very sorry to part with both her ladyship and Miss Nugent; but the fact was, Lady Clonbrony,' said Mrs. Petito, laying a detaining hand upon Lady Clonbrony whip, one end of which Lady Clonbrony unwittingly trusted within Lady Clonbrony reach,--'I and his lordship had a little difference, which the best friends, you know, sometimes have; so Lady Dashfort Lady Clonbrony was so condescending to give me up to Lady DashfortLady Dashfort--and I knew no more than the child unborn that Lady Dashfort ladyship had her ladyship in contemplation to cross the seas.
But, to oblige his lordship, and as Colonel Heathcock, with Colonel Heathcock regiment of militia, was coming for purtection in the packet at the same time, and we to have the government-yacht, I waived my objections to Ireland.
And, indeed, though I was greatly frighted at first, having heard all we've heard, you know, Lady Clonbrony, from Lady Clonbrony, of there being no living in Ireland, and expecting to see no trees nor accommodation, nor anything but bogs all along; yet I declare, I was very agreeably surprised; for, as far as I've seen at Dublin and in the vicinity, the accommodations, and everything of that nature, now is vastly put-up-able with!'
--'My lord,' said Sir James Brooke, 'we shall be late.'
Lady Clonbrony, shortly withdrawing Lady Clonbrony whip from '  'Mrs.
Petito, turned Lady Clonbrony horse away. '
'Mrs.
Petito, stretching over the back of the barouche as Lady Clonbrony rode off, bawled to him--  'Lady Clonbrony, we're at Stephen's Green, when we're at Dublin.'
But as Lady Clonbrony did not choose to hear, '  'Mrs.
Petito raised '  'Mrs.
Petito voice to its highest pitch, adding--  'And where are you, Lady Clonbrony, to be found!--as I have a parcel of Miss Nugent's for you.'
Lady Clonbrony instantly turned back, and gave Lady Clonbrony direction.
'Cleverly done, faith!'
said the major.
'I did not hear '  'Mrs.
Petito say when Lady Dashfort is to be in town,' said Bowles.
'What, Bowles!
have you a mind to lose more of your guineas to Lady Dashfort, and to be jockied out of another horse by Lady Isabel?'
'Oh!
confound it--no!
I'll keep out of the way of that--I have had enough,' said Bowles; 'it is Lady ClonbronyLady Clonbrony turn now; you hear that Lady Dashfort would be very PROUD to see Lady Dashfort.
his lordship is in for his lordship, and with such an auxiliary as '  'Mrs.
Petito, Lady Dashfort has Lady Dashfort for Lady Isabel, as sure as Lady Dashfort has a heart or hand.'
'My compliments to the ladies, but my heart is engaged,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'and my hand shall go with my heart, or not at all.'
'Engaged!
engaged to a very amiable, charming woman, no doubt,' said Sir James Brooke.
'I have an excellent opinion of your taste; and if you can return the compliment to my judgment, take my advice: don't trust to your heart's being engaged, much less plead that engagement; for it would be Lady Dashfort sport, and Lady Isabel joy, to make you break your engagement, and break your mistress's heart; the fairer, the more amiable, the more beloved, the greater the triumph, the greater the delight in giving pain.
All the time love would be out of the question; neither mother nor daughter would care if you were hanged, or, as Lady Dashfort would Lady Dashfort have expressed it, if you were d-d.'  'With such women, I should think a man's heart could be in no great danger,' said Lady Clonbrony.
'There you might be mistaken, Lady Clonbrony; there's a way to every man's heart, which no man in his own case is aware of, but which every woman knows right well, and none better than these ladies--by his vanity.'
'True,' said Bowles.
'I am not so vain as to think Bowles without vanity,' said Lady Clonbrony; 'but love, I should imagine, is a stronger passion than vanity.'
'You should imagine!
Stay till you are tried, Lady Clonbrony.
Excuse me,' said Bowles, laughing.
Lady Clonbrony felt the good sense of this, and determined to have nothing to do with these ladies; indeed, though Lady Clonbrony had talked, Lady Clonbrony had scarcely yet thought of these ladies; for Lady Clonbrony imagination was intent upon that packet from Miss Nugent, which '  'Mrs.
Petito said '  'Mrs.
Petito had for Lady Clonbrony.
Lady Clonbrony heard nothing of it, or of '  'Mrs.
Petito, for some days.
Lady Clonbrony sent a servant who was standing beside it every day to Stephen's Green to inquire if Lady Dashfort had returned to town.
Lady Dashfort ladyship at last returned; but '  'Mrs.
Petito could not deliver the parcel to any hand but Lady Clonbrony own, and Lady Dashfort would not stir out, because Lady Dashfort was indisposed.
No longer able to restrain Lady Clonbrony impatience, Lady Clonbrony went Lady Clonbrony--knocked at Lady Dashfort door--inquired for '  'Mrs.
Petito--was shown into '  'Mrs.
Petito parlour.
the parcel was delivered to Lady Clonbrony; but to Lady Clonbrony utter disappointment, the parcel was a parcel FOR, not FROM Miss Nugent.
the parcel contained merely an odd volume of some book of Miss Nugent which '  'Mrs.
Petito said '  'Mrs.
Petito had put up along with '  'Mrs.
Petito things IN A MISTAKE, and '  'Mrs.
Petito thought it '  'Mrs.
Petito duty to return it by the next opportunity of a safe conveyance.
Whilst Lady Clonbrony, to comfort Lady Clonbrony for Lady Clonbrony disappointment, was fixing Lady Clonbrony eyes upon Miss Nugent's name, written by '  'Mrs.
Petito own hand, in the first leaf of the book, Lady Dashfort's door opened, and the figure of an interesting-looking woman, in deep mourning, appeared--appeared for one moment, and retired.
'Only my Lord Colambre, about a parcel I was bringing for Lady Clonbrony from England, my lady--my Lady Isabel, my lord,' said '  'Mrs.
Petito.
Whilst '  'Mrs.
Petito was saying this, the entrance and retreat had been made, and made with such dignity, grace, and modesty; with such innocence, dove-like eyes had been raised upon Lady Clonbrony, fixed and withdrawn; with such a gracious bend Lady Isabel had bowed to Lady Clonbrony as Lady Isabel retired; with such a smile, and with so soft a voice, had repeated 'Lady Clonbrony!'
that his lordship, though well aware that all this was mere acting, could not help saying to Lady Clonbrony as Lady Clonbrony left the house:  'It is a pity It is only acting.
There is certainly something very engaging in Lady Isabel.
It is a pity Lady Isabel is an actress.
And so young!
A much younger woman than I expected.
A widow before most women are wives.
So young, surely Lady Isabel cannot be such a fiend as A widow before most women are wives described Lady Isabel to be!'
A few nights afterwards Lady Clonbrony was with some of Lady Clonbrony acquaintance at the theatre, when Lady Isabel and Lady Isabel mother came into the box, where seats had been reserved for Lady Isabel and her mother, and where Lady Isabel and her mother appearance instantly made that sensation which is usually created by the entrance of persons of the first notoriety in the fashionable world.
Lady Clonbrony was not a man to be dazzled by fashion, or to mistake notoriety for deference paid to merit, and for the admiration commanded by beauty or talents.
Lady Dashfort coarse person, loud voice, daring manners, and indelicate wit, disgusted Lady Clonbrony almost past endurance, Lady Clonbrony saw Sir James Brooke in the box opposite to Sir James Brooke; and twice determined to go round to Sir James Brooke.
his lordship had crossed the benches, and once Sir James Brooke hand was upon the lock of Lady Dashfort's door; but attracted as much by the daughter as repelled by her mother, Sir James Brooke could move no farther.
her mother's masculine boldness heightened, by contrast, the charms of the daughter's soft sentimentality.
Lady Isabel seemed to shrink from the indelicacy of her mother's manners, and seemed peculiarly distressed by the strange efforts Lady Dashfort made, from time to time, to drag Lady Isabel forward, and to fix upon Lady Isabel the attention of gentlemen.
Colonel Heathcock, who, as '  'Mrs.
Petito had informed Lady Clonbrony, had come over with Lady Clonbrony regiment to Ireland, was beckoned into Colonel Heathcock, who, as Mrs. Petito had informed Lord Colambre box by Lady Dashfort, by Lady Isabel squeezed into a seat next to Lady Isabel; but Lady Isabel seemed to feel sovereign contempt, properly repressed by politeness, for what, in a low whisper to a female friend on the other side of Lady Isabel, Lady Isabel called, 'the self-sufficient inanity of this sad coxcomb.'
Other coxcombs, of a more vivacious style, who stationed themselves round her mother, or to whom her mother stretched from box to box to talk, seemed to engage no more of Lady Isabel attention than just what Lady Isabel was compelled to give by Lady Dashfort repeated calls of--  'Lady Isabel!
Lady Isabel!
Lady Isabel!
Lady Clonbrony bowing to Lady Isabel, Belie!
Belie!
Sir Harry B-- Isabel, child, with your eyes on the stage?
Did you never see a play before?
Novice!
Major P--waiting to catch your eye this quarter of an hour; and now Lady Isabel eyes gone down to Lady Isabel play-bill!
Sir Harry, do take it from Lady Isabel.
'Were eyes so radiant only made to read?'
Lady Isabel appeared to suffer so exquisitely and so naturally from this persecution, that Lady Clonbrony said to himself--  'If this be acting, it is the best acting I ever saw.
If this be art, this deserves to be nature.'
And with this sentiment Lady Clonbrony did Lady Clonbrony the honour of handing Lady Isabel to Lady Isabel carriage this night, and with this sentiment Lady Clonbrony awoke next morning; and by the time Lady Clonbrony had dressed and breakfasted Lady Clonbrony determined that it was impossible all that Lady Clonbrony had seen could be acting.
'No woman, no young woman, could have such art.
Sir James Brooke had been unwarrantably severe; Sir James Brooke would go and tell Sir James Brooke so.'
But Sir James Brooke this day received orders for Sir James Brooke regiment to march to quarters in a distant part of Ireland.
Sir James Brooke head was full of arms, and ammunition, and knapsacks, and billets, and routes; and there was no possibility, even in the present chivalrous disposition of our hero, to enter upon the defence of Lady Isabel.
Indeed, in the regret Sir James Brooke felt for the approaching and unexpected departure of Sir James Brooke friend, Lady Clonbrony forgot the fair lady.
But just when Sir James had Sir James foot in the stirrup, Sir James stopped.
'By the bye, Lady Clonbrony, I saw you at the play last night.
You seemed to be much interested.
Don't think me impertinent, if I remind you of our conversation when our were riding home from Tusculum; and if I warn you,' said Sir James, mounting Sir James horse, 'to beware of counterfeits--for such are abroad.'
Reining in Sir James impatient steed, Sir James turned again and added, 'DEEDS NOT WORDS, is my motto.
Remember, we can judge better by the conduct of people towards others than by people towards others manner towards we.'
