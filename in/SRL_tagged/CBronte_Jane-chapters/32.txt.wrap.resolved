I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully as I could. It was truly hard work at first. Some time elapsed before, with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and all my efforts nature. Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, all my efforts seemed to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst all my efforts as amongst the educated; and when I got to know all my efforts, and all my efforts me, a difference amongst them as amongst the educated rapidly developed a difference amongst them as amongst the educated. all my efforts amazement at me, my language, my rules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed some of these heavy-looking, gaping rustics obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst some of these heavy-looking, gaping rustics not a few examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration. These soon took a pleasure in doing These work well, in keeping These persons neat, in learning their persons tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners. The rapidity of some of these heavy-looking, gaping rustics progress, in some instances, was even surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began personally to like some of the best girls; and some of the best girls liked me. I had amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown, almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to young women I taught the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of needlework. I found estimable characters amongst young women -- characters desirous of information and disposed for improvement -- with whom I passed many a pleasant evening hour in whom own homes. whom parents then (the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions. There was an enjoyment in accepting Their parents then (the farmer and his wife) simple kindness, and in repaying it by a consideration -- a scrupulous regard to Their parents then (the farmer and his wife) feelings -- to which Their parents then (the farmer and his wife) were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and benefited Their parents then (the farmer and his wife); because, while it elevated Their parents then (the farmer and his wife) in Their parents then (the farmer and his wife) own eyes, it made Their parents then (the farmer and his wife) emulous to merit the deferential treatment Their parents then (the farmer and his wife) received. I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went out, I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly smiles. To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray. At this period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful existence -- after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone -- I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy -- dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of being in Mr. Rochester arms, hearing Mr. Rochester voice, meeting Mr. Rochester eye, touching Mr. Rochester hand and cheek, loving Mr. Rochester, being loved by Mr. Rochester -- the hope of passing a lifetime at Mr. Rochester side, would be renewed, with all his side first force and fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how situated. Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the burst of passion. By nine o'clock the next morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day. Rosamond Oliver kept Rosamond Oliver word in coming to visit me. Rosamond Oliver call at the school was generally made in the course of Rosamond Oliver morning ride. Rosamond Oliver would canter up to the door on Rosamond Oliver pony, followed by a mounted livery servant. Anything more exquisite than Rosamond Oliver appearance, in Rosamond Oliver purple habit, with Rosamond Oliver Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls that kissed Rosamond Oliver cheek and floated to Rosamond Oliver shoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus Rosamond Oliver would enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children. Rosamond Oliver generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving Mr. Rivers daily catechising lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young pastor's heart. A sort of instinct seemed to warn Mr. Rivers of Rosamond Oliver entrance, even when Mr. Rivers did not see it; and when Mr. Rivers was looking quite away from the door on her pony, if Rosamond Oliver appeared at it, Mr. Rivers cheek would glow, and Mr. Rivers marble- seeming features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in they very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or darting glance could indicate. Of course, Rosamond Oliver knew Rosamond Oliver power: indeed, Mr. Rivers did not, because Mr. Rivers could not, conceal her power from Rosamond Oliver. In spite of Mr. Rivers Christian stoicism, when Rosamond Oliver went up and addressed Mr. Rivers, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in Mr. Rivers face, Mr. Rivers hand would tremble and Mr. Rivers eye burn. Mr. Rivers seemed to say, with Mr. Rivers sad and resolute look, if Mr. Rivers did not say it with Mr. Rivers lips, "I love you, and I know you prefer me. it is not despair of success that keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept I offered my heart. But my heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round my heart. my heart will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed." And then Rosamond Oliver would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would soften Rosamond Oliver radiant vivacity; Rosamond Oliver would withdraw Rosamond Oliver hand hastily from a disappointed child, and turn in transient petulance from a disappointed child aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr-like. St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to follow, recall, retain Rosamond Oliver, when Rosamond Oliver thus left a disappointed child; but a disappointed child would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of Rosamond Oliver love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides, a disappointed child could not bind all that a disappointed child had in a disappointed child nature -- the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest -- in the limits of a single passion. a disappointed child could not -- a disappointed child would not -- renounce a disappointed child wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale Hall. I learnt so much from a disappointed child in an inroad I once, despite a disappointed child reserve, had the daring to make on a disappointed child confidence. Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage. I had learnt Miss Oliver whole character, which was without mystery or disguise: Miss Oliver was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly selfish. Miss Oliver had been indulged from Miss Oliver birth, but was not absolutely spoilt. Miss Oliver was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (Miss Oliver could not help it, when every glance in the glass showed Miss Oliver such a flush of loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: Miss Oliver was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of Miss Oliver own sex like me; but Miss Oliver was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked Miss Oliver almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance. Miss Oliver had taken an amiable caprice to me. Miss Oliver said I was like Mr. Rivers, only, certainly, Miss Oliver allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but Mr. Rivers was an angel." I was, however, good, clever, composed, and firm, like Mr. Rivers. I was a lusus naturae, Miss Oliver affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: Miss Oliver was sure my previous history, if known, would make a delightful romance. One evening, while, with Miss Oliver usual child-like activity, and thoughtless yet not offensive inquisitiveness, Miss Oliver was rummaging the cupboard and the table-drawer of my little kitchen, Miss Oliver discovered first two French books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors. Miss Oliver was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight. "Had I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What a love -- what a miracle I was! I drew better than Miss Oliver master in the first school in S-. Would I sketch a portrait of Miss Oliver, to show to papa?" "With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. Miss Oliver had then on a dark-blue silk dress; Miss Oliver arms and Miss Oliver neck were bare; Miss Oliver only ornament was Miss Oliver chestnut tresses, which waved over Miss Oliver shoulders with all the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew a careful outline. I promised Miss Oliver the pleasure of colouring a sheet of fine card-board; and, as a sheet of fine card-board was getting late then, I told Miss Oliver Miss Oliver must come and sit another day. Miss Oliver made such a report of Miss Oliver to Miss Oliver father, that Rosamond Oliver accompanied Miss Oliver next evening -- a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and grey-headed man, at whose side Rosamond Oliver lovely daughter looked like a bright flower near a hoary turret. Rosamond Oliver appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud personage; but Rosamond Oliver was very kind to Miss Oliver. The sketch of Rosamond's portrait pleased Rosamond Oliver highly: Rosamond Oliver said I must make a finished picture of it. Rosamond Oliver insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale Hall. I went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant evidences of wealth in the proprietor. Rosamond was full of glee and pleasure all the time I stayed. Rosamond was affable; and when her father entered into conversation with Miss Oliver after tea, her father expressed in strong terms her father approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said her father only feared, from what her father saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and would soon quit the place for one more suitable. "Indeed," cried Rosamond, "Rosamond is clever enough to be a governess in a high family, papa." I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the land. Rosamond Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers -- of the Rivers family -- with great respect. Rosamond Oliver said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to the ancestors of the house; that even now Rosamond Oliver considered the representative of the house might, if Rosamond Oliver liked, make an alliance with the best. Rosamond Oliver accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away. it appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of Rosamond's union with St. John. Rosamond Oliver evidently regarded the young clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune. It was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant, after helping me to clean the house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a penny for her aid. All about me was spotless and bright -- scoured floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made Rosamond Oliver neat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would. The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature. The head was finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips -- a soft curl here and there to the tresses -- a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John Rivers. "I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said. "Not, I hope, in thought? No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel lonely. You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up wonderfully so far. I have brought you a book for evening solace," and he laid on the table a new publication -- a poem: one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days -- the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the readers of our era are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or repine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power over either, to bind or slay: either will both assert either existence, either presence, either liberty and strength again one day. Powerful angels, safe in heaven! Powerful angels, safe in heaven smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over Powerful angels, safe in heaven destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought. No; envy not only live, but reign and redeem: and without envy divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell -- the hell of your own meanness. While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for "Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. St. John tall figure sprang erect again with a start: St. John said nothing. I looked up at St. John: St. John shunned my eye. I knew St. John thoughts well, and could read St. John heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than St. John: I had then temporarily the advantage of St. John, and I conceived an inclination to do St. John some good, if I could. "With all St. John firmness and self-control," thought I, "St. John tasks St. John too far: locks every feeling and pang within -- expresses, confesses, imparts nothing. I am sure it would benefit St. John to talk a little about this sweet Rosamond, whom St. John thinks St. John ought not to marry: I will make St. John talk." I said first, "Take a chair, St. John Rivers." But St. John answered, as St. John always did, that St. John could not stay. "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for St. John. I'll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy." "Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly. "Like! Like whom? I did not observe this portrait closely." "You did, St. John Rivers." St. John Rivers almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: St. John Rivers looked at St. John Rivers astonished. "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within. "I don't mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to considerable lengths." I continued, "You observed it closely and distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I rose and placed it in St. John Rivers hand. "A well-executed picture," St. John Rivers said; "very soft, clear colouring; very graceful and correct drawing." "Yes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance? Who is it like?" Mastering some hesitation, St. John Rivers answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume." "Of course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you. I don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would deem worthless." St. John Rivers continued to gaze at the picture: the longer St. John Rivers looked, the firmer St. John Rivers held it, the more St. John Rivers seemed to covet it. "It is like!" St. John Rivers murmured; "the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect. It smiles!" "Would It comfort, or would It wound you to have a similar painting? Tell me that. When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?" St. John Rivers now furtively raised St. John Rivers eyes: St. John Rivers glanced at St. John Rivers, irresolute, disturbed: St. John Rivers again surveyed the picture. "That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious or wise is another question." Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred St. John Rivers, and that Rosamond was not likely to oppose the match, I -- less exalted in my views than St. John -- had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate Rosamond really preferred him, and that her father was not likely to oppose the match, I -- less exalted in my views than St. John -- union. It seemed to St. John Rivers that, should St. John Rivers become the possessor of Rosamond Oliver's large fortune, St. John Rivers might do as much good with it as if St. John Rivers went and laid St. John Rivers genius out to wither, and St. John Rivers strength to waste, under a tropical sun. With this persuasion I now answered - "As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to take to yourself the original at once." By this time St. John Rivers had sat down: St. John Rivers had laid the picture on the table before St. John Rivers, and with St. John Rivers brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over the picture. I discerned St. John Rivers was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity. I saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject St. John Rivers had deemed unapproachable -- to hear a subject he had deemed unapproachable -- thus freely handled -- was beginning to be felt by St. John Rivers as a new pleasure -- an unhoped-for relief. Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of Reserved people sentiments and griefs more than the expansive. The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to "burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls is often to confer on their the first of obligations. "She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind St. John Rivers chair, "and She respects you. Moreover, She is a sweet girl -- rather thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and She. You ought to marry She." "DOES She like me?" St. John Rivers asked. "Certainly; better than She likes any one else. She talks of you continually: there is no subject She enjoys so much or touches upon so often." "It is very pleasant to hear this," St. John Rivers said -- "very: go on for another quarter of an hour." And St. John Rivers actually took out St. John Rivers watch and laid his watch upon the table to measure the time. "But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to fetter your heart?" "Don't imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and with such labour prepared -- so assiduously sown with the seeds of good intentions, of self-denying plans. And now it is deluged with a nectarous flood -- the young germs swamped -- delicious poison cankering them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: myself is talking to myself with myself sweet voice -- gazing down on myself with those eyes your skilful hand has copied so well -- smiling at myself with these coral lips. myself is mine -- I am hers -- this present life and passing world suffice to myself. Hush! say nothing -- my heart is full of delight -- my senses are entranced -- let the time I marked pass in peace." I humoured him: his watch ticked on: him breathed fast and low: I stood silent. Amidst this hush the quartet sped; him replaced his watch, laid the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth. "Now," said him, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion. I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck voluntarily under her yoke of flowers. I tasted myself cup. The pillow was burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: myself promises are hollow -- myself offers false: I see and know all this." I gazed at him in wonder. "It is strange," pursued him, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver's so wildly -- with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating -- I experience at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that myself would not make me a good wife; that myself is not the partner suited to me; that I should discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months' rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret. This I know." "Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating. "While something in me," him went on, "is acutely sensible to myself charms, something else is as deeply impressed with myself defects: her defects are such that myself could sympathise in nothing I aspired to -- co- operate in nothing I undertook. Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle? Rosamond a missionary's wife? No!" "But you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish that scheme." "Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race -- of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance -- of substituting peace for war -- freedom for bondage -- religion for superstition -- the hope of heaven for the fear of hell? Must I relinquish that? It is dearer than the blood in my veins. It is what I have to look forward to, and to live for." After a considerable pause, I said -- "And Miss Oliver? Are her disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?" "Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a month, my image will be effaced from Miss Oliver heart. Miss Oliver will forget me; and will marry, probably, some one who will make Miss Oliver far happier than I should do." "You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict. You are wasting away." "No. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet unsettled -- my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this morning, I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six." "You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the schoolroom." Again the surprised expression crossed Miss Oliver face. Miss Oliver had not imagined that a woman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I felt at home in this sort of discourse. I could never rest in communication with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone. "You are original," said Miss Oliver, "and not timid. There is something brave in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions. You think them more profound and potent than them are. You give me a larger allowance of sympathy than I have a just claim to. When I colour, and when I shade before Miss Oliver, I do not pity me. I scorn the weakness. I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion of the soul. THAT is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am -- a cold hard man." I smiled incredulously. "You have taken my confidence by storm," me continued, "and now it is much at your service. I am simply, in my original state -- stripped of that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity -- a cold, hard, ambitious man. Natural affection only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over me. Reason, and not feeling, is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more than others, insatiable. I honour endurance, perseverance, industry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your career with interest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you still suffer." "You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said. "No. There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I believe; and I believe the Gospel. You missed your epithet. I am not a pagan, but a Christian philosopher -- a follower of the sect of Jesus. As a Christian philosopher -- a follower of the sect of Jesus disciple I adopt a Christian philosopher -- a follower of the sect of Jesus pure, a Christian philosopher -- a follower of the sect of Jesus merciful, a Christian philosopher -- a follower of the sect of Jesus benignant doctrines. I advocate His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines: I am sworn to spread His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines. Won in youth to religion, religion has cultivated my original qualities thus:- From the minute germ, natural affection, religion has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human uprightness, religion has reared a due sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power and renown for my wretched self, religion has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross. So much has religion done for religion; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning and training nature. But religion could not eradicate nature: nor will it be eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'" Having said this, he took he hat, which lay on the table beside my palette. Once more he looked at the portrait. "religion IS lovely," he murmured. "religion is well named the Rose of the World, indeed!" "And may I not paint one like it for you?" "CUI BONO? No." he drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was impossible for me to tell; but something had caught he eye. he took his eye up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me, inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. he lips parted, as if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever the coming sentence was. "What is the matter?" I asked. "Nothing in the World," was the reply; and, replacing this blank paper, I saw him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. this blank paper disappeared in him glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," him vanished. "Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the globe, however!" I, in my turn, scrutinised this blank paper; but saw nothing on this blank paper save a few dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil. I pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding the mystery insolvable, and being certain the mystery could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon forgot the mystery.
