My home, then, when I at last find a home, -- is a cottage; a little room with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of tea-things in delf.
Above, a chamber of the same dimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such things as are necessary.
It is evening.
I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little orphan who serves me as a handmaid.
I am sitting alone on the hearth.
This morning, the village school opened.
I had twenty scholars.
But three of the number can read: none write or cipher.
Several knit, and a few sew a little.
Several knit, and a few speak with the broadest accent of the district.
At present, Several knit, and a few and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's language.
Some of they and I are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a disposition that pleases me.
I must not forget that these coarsely-clad little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement, intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in these coarsely-clad little peasants hearts as in those of the best-born.
My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I shall find some happiness in discharging that office.
Much enjoyment I do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live on from day to day.
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?
Not to deceive me, I must reply -- No: I felt desolate to a degree.
I felt -- yes, idiot that I am -- I felt degraded.
I doubted I had taken a step which sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.
I was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I heard and saw round me.
But let me not hate and despise me too much for these feelings; I know these feelings to be wrong -- that is a great step gained; I shall strive to overcome these feelings.
To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the better of these feelings partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, these feelings will be quite subdued.
In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute gratification for disgust.
Meantime, let me ask me one question -- Which is better?
-- To have surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort -- no struggle; -- but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr. Rochester's mistress; delirious with Mr. Rochester's mistress love half my time -- for Mr. Rochester's mistress would -- oh, yes, Mr. Rochester's mistress would have loved me well for a while.
Mr. Rochester's mistress DID love me -- no one will ever love me so again.
I shall never more know the sweet homage given to beauty, youth, and grace -- for never to any one else shall I seem to possess these charms.
Mr. Rochester's mistress was fond and proud of me -- it is what no man besides will ever be.
-- But where am I wandering, and what am I saying, and above all, feeling?
Whether is it better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles -- fevered with delusive bliss one hour -- suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the next -- or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.
God directed me to a correct choice: I thank God providence for the guidance!
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from the village.
The birds were singing The birds last strains - "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
While I looked, I thought me happy, and was surprised to find me ere long weeping -- and why?
For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my master: for my master I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal fury -- consequences of my departure -- which might now, perhaps, be dragging my master from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither.
At this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton -- I say LONELY, for in that bend of my face visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.
I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up.
A dog -- old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer, as I saw in a moment -- was pushing the gate with Mr. Rivers' nose, and St. John himself leant upon the gate with folded arms; Mr. Rivers' brow knit, Mr. Rivers' gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me.
I asked Mr. Rivers' to come in.
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters left for you.
I think a little parcel my sisters left for you contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
I approached to take a little parcel my sisters left for you: a welcome gift a welcome gift was.
Mr. Rivers' examined my face, I thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were doubtless very visible upon austerity.
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?"
Mr. Rivers' asked.
"Oh, no!
On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my scholars very well."
"But perhaps your accommodations -- your cottage -- your furniture -- have disappointed your expectations?
perhaps your accommodations -- your cottage -- your furniture -- are, in truth, scanty enough; but -- " I interrupted - "My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and commodious.
All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.
I am not absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing -- I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a business.
I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot.
I do not repine."
"But you feel solitude an oppression?
The little house there behind you is dark and empty."
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the vacillating fears of Lot's wife.
What you had left before I saw you, of course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career steadily, for some months at least."
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.
St. John continued - "It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.
God has given us, in a measure, the power to make us own fate; and when us energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get -- when us will strains after a path us may not follow -- us need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: us have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste -- and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to death.
I burnt for the more active life of the world -- for the more exciting toils of a literary career -- for the destiny of an artist, author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.
I considered; my life was so wretched, my life must be changed, or I must die.
After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds -- my powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread their wings, and mount beyond ken.
God had an errand for me; to bear which afar, to deliver an errand for me well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator, were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
"A missionary I resolved to be.
From that moment my state of mind changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its galling soreness -- which time only can heal.
My father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since My father death, I have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder -- a last conflict with human weakness, in which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I WILL overcome -- and I leave Europe for the East."
He said this, in He peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when He had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I looked too.
Both He and I had Both he and I backs towards the path leading up the field to the wicket.
Both he and I had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene; Both he and I might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed - "Good evening, Mr. Rivers.
And good evening, old Carlo.
Your dog is quicker to recognise Your dog friends than you are, Your dog; Your dog pricked Your dog ears and wagged Your dog tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have your back towards Your dog now."
It was true.
Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over Mr. Rivers head, Mr. Rivers stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the speaker had surprised Mr. Rivers -- Mr. Rivers arm resting on the gate, Mr. Rivers face directed towards the west.
Mr. Rivers turned at last, with measured deliberation.
A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at Mr. Rivers side.
There appeared, within three feet of Mr. Rivers, a form clad in pure white -- a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo, his side lifted up his side head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under Mr. Rivers glance a face of perfect beauty.
Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify Perfect beauty: as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term.
No charm was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses -- all advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers.
I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired this fair creature with my whole heart.
Nature had surely formed this fair creature in a partial mood; and, forgetting this fair creature usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, this fair creature darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?
I naturally asked myself that question as I saw this earthly angel turn to this fair creature and look at this fair creature; and, as naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in this earthly angel countenance.
this earthly angel had already withdrawn this earthly angel eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," this earthly angel said, as this earthly angel crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with this earthly angel foot.
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (Papa mentioned the name of a large town some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.
Papa told me you had opened your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see Papa: this is Papa?"
pointing to myself.
"It is," said St. John.
"Do you think you shall like Morton?"
Papa asked of myself, with a direct and naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
"I hope I shall.
I have many inducements to do so."
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
"Quite."
"Do you like your house?"
"Very much."
"Have I furnished your house nicely?"
"Very nicely, indeed."
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
"You have indeed.
Papa is teachable and handy."
(This then, I thought, is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune, as well as in those of nature!
What happy combination of the planets presided over Papa birth, I wonder?)
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," Papa added.
"It will be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.
St. John Rivers, I have been SO gay during my stay at S-.
Last night, or rather this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.
The -th regiment are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable men in the world: the officers put all our young knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame."
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and Mr. St. John's under lip upper lip curled a moment.
Mr. St. John's under lip mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed, and the lower part of Mr. St. John's under lip face unusually stern and square, as the laughing girl gave Mr. St. John's under lip this information.
Mr. St. John's under lip lifted Mr. St. John's under lip gaze, too, from the daisies, and turned his gaze on the laughing girl.
An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning gaze his gaze was.
the laughing girl answered his gaze with a second laugh, and laughter well became the laughing girl youth, the laughing girl roses, the laughing girl dimples, the laughing girl bright eyes.
As Mr. St. John's under lip stood, mute and grave, the laughing girl again fell to caressing Carlo.
"Carlo loves me," said the laughing girl.
"Carlo is not stern and distant to Carlo friends; and if Carlo could speak, Carlo would not be silent."
As the laughing girl patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before Carlo young and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.
I saw Carlo melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
Flushed and kindled thus, Carlo looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she for a woman.
Carlo chest heaved once, as if Carlo large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.
But Carlo curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.
Carlo responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made Carlo.
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking up.
"You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.
Carlo is alone this evening, and not very well: will you return with Carlo and visit Carlo?"
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Miss Oliver," answered St. John.
"Not a seasonable hour!
But I declare it is.
It is just the hour when papa most wants company: when the works are closed and Carlo has no business to occupy Carlo.
Now, St. John Rivers, DO come.
Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?"
She filled up the hiatus Carlo silence left by a reply of She own.
"I forgot!"
She exclaimed, shaking She beautiful curled head, as if shocked at She.
"I am so giddy and thoughtless!
DO excuse me.
It had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter.
Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely.
I am sure I pity you.
Do come and see Papa."
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
St. John spoke almost like an automaton: St. John only knew the effort it cost St. John thus to refuse.
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any longer: the dew begins to fall.
Good evening!"
She held out She hand.
St. John just touched her hand.
"Good evening!"
St. John repeated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo.
She turned, but in a moment returned.
"Are you well?"
She asked.
Well might She put the question: his face was blanched as She gown.
"Quite well," St. John enunciated; and, with a bow, St. John left the gate.
She went one way; St. John another.
She turned twice to gaze after St. John as She tripped fairy-like down the field; St. John, as St. John strode firmly across, never turned at all.
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from exclusive meditation on my own.
St. John Rivers had designated St. John Rivers brother "inexorable as death."
St. John Rivers had not exaggerated.
