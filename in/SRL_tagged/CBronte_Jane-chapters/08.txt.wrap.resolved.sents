Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and all were gone into the refectory to tea.
I now ventured to descend: it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.
The spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I sank prostrate with my face to the ground.
Now I wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to Helen Burns I abandoned Helen Burns, and my tears watered the boards.
I had meant to be so good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had smiled approbation; Miss Miller had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.
While sobbing out this wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up -- again Helen Burns was near Helen Burns; the fading fires just showed Helen Burns coming up the long, vacant room; Helen Burns brought my coffee and bread.
"Come, eat something," Helen Burns said; but I put both away from Helen Burns, feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.
Helen Burns regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.
Helen Burns sat down on the ground near Helen Burns, embraced Helen Burns knees with Helen Burns arms, and rested Helen Burns head upon them; in that attitude Helen Burns remained silent as an Indian.
I was the first who spoke - "Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar?"
"Everybody, Jane?
Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
"But what have I to do with millions?
The eighty, I know, despise me."
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is Mr. Brocklehurst even a great and admired man: Mr. Brocklehurst is little liked here; Mr. Brocklehurst never took steps to make Mr. Brocklehurst liked.
Had Mr. Brocklehurst treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies, declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if sympathy dared.
Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in Teachers and pupils hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, friendly feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for friendly feelings temporary suppression.
Besides, Jane" -- Jane paused.
"Well, Helen?"
said I, putting my hand into hers: Helen chafed my fingers gently to warm them, and went on - "If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends."
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if others don't love me I would rather die than live -- I cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen.
Look here; to gain some real affection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let the bone of my arm dash a bull hoof at my chest -- " "Hush, Jane!
you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and put life into the sovereign hand that created your frame, has provided you with other resources than your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you.
Besides this earth, and besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us, for those spirits are commissioned to guard us; and if us were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see us tortures, recognise us innocence (if innocent us be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.
Why, then, should us ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness -- to glory?"
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity Helen imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.
I felt the impression of woe as Helen spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having done speaking, Helen breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for Helen.
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round Helen waist; Helen drew me to Helen, and we reposed in silence.
we had not sat long thus, when another person came in.
Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and Helen light, streaming in through a window near, shone full both on we and on the approaching figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said Jane Eyre; "I want you in my room; and as Helen Burns is with you, Helen Burns may come too."
we went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached Helen Burns apartment; the superintendent's guidance contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.
Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth, and Helen Burns taking another, Helen Burns called me to Helen Burns side.
"Is it all over?"
Helen Burns asked, looking down at my face.
"Have you cried your grief away?"
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
"Why?"
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else, will now think me wicked."
"We shall think you what you prove you to be, my child.
Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy We."
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
"You will," said Helen Burns, passing Helen Burns arm round Helen Burns.
"And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.
My uncle is dead, and My uncle left me to My uncle care."
"Did My uncle not, then, adopt you of My uncle own accord?"
"No, ma'am; My uncle was sorry to have to do it: but My uncle, as I have often heard the servants say, got My uncle to promise before My uncle died that My uncle would always keep me."
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a criminal is accused, a criminal is always allowed to speak in a criminal own defence.
You have been charged with falsehood; defend Jane, you know to me as well as you can.
Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing."
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate -- most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say, I told My uncle all the story of my sad childhood.
Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than my language generally was when my language developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.
Thus restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss Temple fully believed me.
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; Mrs. Reed then said - "I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to Mr. Lloyd; if Mr. Lloyd reply agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation; to Mrs. Reed, Mrs. Reed, you are clear now."
Mrs. Reed kissed me, and still keeping me at Mrs. Reed side (where I was well contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the contemplation of Mrs. Reed face, Mrs. Reed dress, Mrs. Reed one or two ornaments, Mrs. Reed white forehead, Mrs. Reed clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), Mrs. Reed proceeded to address Helen Burns.
"How are you to-night, Helen?
Have you coughed much to-day?"
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
"And the pain in your chest?"
"It is a little better."
Miss Temple Miss Temple got up, took Miss Temple hand and examined Miss Temple pulse; then Miss Temple returned to Miss Temple own seat: as Miss Temple resumed it, I heard Miss Temple sigh low.
Miss Temple was pensive a few minutes, then rousing Miss Temple, Miss Temple said cheerfully - "But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."
Miss Temple rang Miss Temple bell.
"Barbara," Barbara said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
And a tray was soon brought.
How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry) discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple Miss Temple discerned it too.
"Barbara," said Barbara, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
There is not enough for three."
Barbara went out: Barbara returned soon - "Madam, Mrs. Harden says Barbara has sent up the usual quantity."
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr. Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
"Oh, very well!"
returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I suppose."
And as Barbara withdrew Barbara added, smiling, "Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
Having invited Helen Burns and me to approach the table, and placed before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, Helen Burns got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from a drawer a parcel wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to us eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
"I meant to give each of Barbara some of this to take with Barbara," said Helen Burns, "but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and Helen Burns proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
us feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which us hostess regarded us, as us satisfied us famished appetites on the delicate fare Helen Burns liberally supplied.
Tea over and a tray removed, Helen Burns again summoned us to the fire; us sat one on each side of Helen Burns, and now a conversation followed between Helen Burns and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
Miss Temple Miss Temple had always something of serenity in Miss Temple air, of state in Miss Temple mien, of refined propriety in Miss Temple language, which precluded deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the pleasure of those who looked on Helen Burns and listened to Helen Burns, by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of Helen Burns beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in Helen Burns own unique mind, had roused Helen Burns powers within Helen Burns.
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these woke, The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these kindled: first, The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these glowed in the bright tint of Helen Burns cheek, which till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these shone in the liquid lustre of Helen Burns eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple's -- a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance.
Then Helen Burns soul sat on Helen Burns lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell.
Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?
Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; Helen Burns spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at: They spoke of books: how many They had read!
What stores of knowledge They possessed!
Then They seemed so familiar with French names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple Miss Temple asked Helen if Helen sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin Helen father had taught Helen, and taking a book from a shelf, bade Helen read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line.
Helen had scarcely finished ere her bell announced bedtime!
no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as Helen drew us to Helen heart - "God bless you, my children!"
Helen Helen held a little longer than Helen: Helen let Helen go more reluctantly; it was Helen Helen eye followed to the door; her eye was for Helen Helen a second time breathed a sad sigh; for Helen Helen wiped a tear from Helen cheek.
On reaching the bedroom, us heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: Helen was examining drawers; Helen had just pulled out Helen Burns, and when us entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow Helen Burns should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to Helen shoulder.
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to Helen, in a low voice: "I intended to have arranged My things, but I forgot."
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign- looking forehead.
Helen wore it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment.
The moment Miss Scatcherd Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which Helen was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and large, had continually been scalding her cheek; for the spectacle of Helen sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received Mr. Lloyd answer: it appeared that what Mr. Lloyd said went to corroborate my account.
Miss Temple, having assembled afternoon school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that Jane Eyre was most happy to be able to pronounce Jane Eyre completely cleared from every imputation.
The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing.
I learned the first two tenses of the verb ETRE, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the same day.
That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays.
I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
