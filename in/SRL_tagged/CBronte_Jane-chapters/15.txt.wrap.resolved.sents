Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.
it was one afternoon, when Mr. Rochester chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while she played with Pilot and she shuttlecock, Mr. Rochester asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within sight of she.
Mr. Rochester then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine Varens, towards whom Mr. Rochester had once cherished what Mr. Rochester called a "grande passion."
a "grande passion she had professed to return with even superior ardour.
Mr. Rochester thought Mr. Rochester she idol, ugly as Mr. Rochester was: Mr. Rochester believed, as Mr. Rochester said, that she preferred Mr. Rochester "taille d'athlete" to the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph for she British gnome, that I installed she in an hotel; gave she a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, &c. In short, I began the process of ruining she in the received style, like any other spoony.
I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre.
I had -- as I deserved to have -- the fate of all other spoonies.
Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I found Celine out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in Celine boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by Celine presence.
No, -- I exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about Celine: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume Celine had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity.
I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought she to open the window and step out on to the balcony.
It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene.
the balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar, -- I will take one now, if you will excuse me."
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar; having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on the freezing and sunless air, his went on - "I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was croquant -- (overlook the barbarism) -- croquant chocolate comfits, and smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I had given Celine.
Celine was returning: of course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.
an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak -- an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening -- I knew Celine instantly by Celine little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of Celine dress, as Celine skipped from the carriage-step.
Bending over the balcony, I was about to murmur 'Mon ange' -- in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the ear of love alone -- when a figure jumped from an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses after Celine; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched porte cochere of the hotel.
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?
Of course not: I need not ask you; because you never felt love.
You have both sentiments yet to experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall waken the shock.
You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in which your youth has hitherto slid away.
Floating on with closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at the rocks base.
But I tell you -- and you may mark my words -- you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer current -- as I am now.
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and stillness of the world under this frost.
I like Thornfield, Thornfield antiquity, Thornfield retirement, Thornfield old crow-trees and thorn-trees, Thornfield grey facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet how long have I abhorred the very thought of Thornfield, shunned Thornfield like a great plague-house?
How I do still abhor -" He ground He teeth and was silent: He arrested He step and struck He boot against the hard ground.
Some hated thought seemed to have He in Thornfield grip, and to hold He so tightly that He could not advance.
We were ascending the avenue when He thus paused; the hall was before We.
Lifting He eye to the hall battlements, He cast over them a glare such as I never saw before or since.
Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust, detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large pupil dilating under He ebon eyebrow.
Wild was the wrestle which should be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and cynical: self-willed and resolute: Wild settled his passion and petrified his countenance: his went on - "During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with my destiny.
Miss Eyre stood there, by that beech-trunk -- a hag like one of those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.
'You like Thornfield?'
Miss Eyre said, lifting Miss Eyre finger; and then Miss Eyre wrote in the air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!
Like it if you dare!'
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily) "I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness -- yes, goodness.
I wish to be a better man than I have been, than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem but straw and rotten wood."
Adele here ran before him with Adele here shuttlecock.
"Away!"
him cried harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"
Continuing then to pursue him walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point whence him had abruptly diverged - "Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle.
Varens entered?"
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on the contrary, waking out of him scowling abstraction, him turned him eyes towards him, and the shade seemed to clear off him brow.
"Oh, I had forgotten Celine!
Well, to resume.
When I saw my charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate my waistcoat way in two minutes to my heart's core.
Strange!"
he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.
"Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady; passing strange that you should listen to he quietly, as if it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like he to tell stories of a man like me opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!
But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets.
Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.
Happily I do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from he.
The more you and I converse, The better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
After this digression he proceeded - "I remained in the balcony.
'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,' thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'
So putting my hand in through the open window, I drew the curtain over my hand, leaving only an opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.
My eye was quickly at the aperture.
Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left a lamp on the table, and withdrew.
The couple were thus revealed to he clearly: The couple removed The couple cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,' shining in satin and jewels, -- my gifts of course, -- and there was Celine companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew her companion in an officer's uniform for a young roue of a vicomte -- a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I despised her companion in an officer's uniform so absolutely.
On recognising her companion in an officer's uniform, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank under an extinguisher.
A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; A woman who could betray me for such a rival deserved only scorn; less, however, than I, who had been A woman who could betray me for such a rival dupe.
"They began to talk; They conversation eased me completely: frivolous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary than enrage a listener.
A card of mine lay on the table; this being perceived, brought my name under discussion.
Neither of They possessed energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but They insulted me as coarsely as They could in They little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal defects -- deformities Celine termed They.
Now it had been Celine custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what Celine called my 'beaute male:' wherein Celine differed diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think me handsome.
The contrast struck me at the time and -- " Adele here here came running up again.
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to see you."
"Ah!
in that case I must abridge.
Opening the window, I walked in upon them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave Celine notice to vacate Celine hotel; offered Celine a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.
Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of him poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew.
But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in she countenance: Pilot is more like me than Pilot.
Some years after I had broken with the mother, Pilot abandoned Pilot child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.
I acknowledged no natural claim on Adele here's part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not Pilot father; but hearing that Pilot was quite destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted the poor thing here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden.
Mrs. Fairfax found you to train the poor thing; but now you know that the poor thing is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera- girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place -- that you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c. -- Eh?"
"No: Adele here is not answerable for either Adele here mother's faults or yours: I have a regard for Adele here; and now that I know Adele here is, in a sense, parentless -- forsaken by her mother and disowned by Adele here, sir -- I shall cling closer to Adele here than before.
How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate Adele here governess as a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards Adele here as a friend?"
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!
Well, I must go in now; and you too: it darkens."
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele here and Pilot -- ran a race with Adele here, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.
When we went in, and I had removed Adele here bonnet and coat, I took Adele here on my knee; kept Adele here there an hour, allowing Adele here to prattle as Adele here liked: not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which Adele here was apt to stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in Adele here a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an English mind.
Still Adele here had Adele here merits; and I was disposed to appreciate all that was good in Adele here to the utmost.
I sought in Adele here countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn of expression announced relationship.
It was a pity: if Adele here could but have been proved to resemble him, him would have thought more of Adele here.
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.
As Mr. Rochester had said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer, and Adele here treachery to Mr. Rochester, were everyday matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized Mr. Rochester when Mr. Rochester was in the act of expressing the present contentment of Mr. Rochester mood, and Mr. Rochester newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs.
I meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting wonderingly on this incident, as I found wonderingly on this incident for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to Mr. Rochester.
The confidence he had thought fit to repose in Mr. Rochester seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted wonderingly on this incident as such.
he deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards Mr. Rochester than at the first.
I never seemed in he way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for Mr. Rochester: when summoned by formal invitation to he presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse he, and that these evening conferences were sought as much for he pleasure as for my benefit.
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard he talk with relish.
It was he nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived its corrupt scenes and wicked ways interest from the great scale on which its corrupt scenes and wicked ways were acted, the strange novelty by which its corrupt scenes and wicked ways were characterised); and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he portrayed, and following he in thought through the new regions he disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
The ease of he manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to he.
I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master: yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it was he way.
So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?
No, reader: gratitude, and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made he face the object I best liked to see; he presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire.
Yet I had not forgotten he faults; indeed, I could not, for he brought them frequently before me.
he was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that he great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.
he was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read to he, found he sitting in he library alone, with he head bent on he folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened he features.
But I believed that he moodiness, he harshness, and he former faults of morality (I say FORMER, for now he seemed corrected of them) had them source in some cruel cross of fate.
I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny encouraged.
I thought there were excellent materials in he; though for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled.
I cannot deny that I grieved for he grief, whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could not sleep for thinking of he look when he paused in the avenue, and told how my thin crescent-destiny had risen up before he, and dared he to be happy at Thornfield.
"Why not?"
I asked he.
"What alienates he from the house?
Will he leave the house again soon?
Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.
If he does go, the change will be doleful.
Suppose he should be absent spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me.
I wished I had kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.
I rose and sat up in bed, listening.
The sound was hushed.
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward tranquillity was broken.
The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.
I said, "Who is there?"
Nothing answered.
I was chilled with fear.
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when my chamber-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found he way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen he lying there he in the mornings.
The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.
Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.
But it was not fated that I should sleep that night.
A dream had scarcely approached my ear, when my ear fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident enough.
This was a demoniac laugh -- low, suppressed, and deep -- uttered, as it seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber-door.
The head of my bed was near my chamber-door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside -- or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was reiterated: and I knew the goblin-laugher came from behind the panels.
My first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is there?"
Something gurgled and moaned.
Ere long, steps retreated up the dark gallery outside towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut in the third-storey staircase; I heard a door open and close, and all was still.
"Was that Grace Poole?
and is she possessed with a devil?"
thought I.
Impossible now to remain longer by I.
Impossible: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.
I hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened a door with a trembling hand.
There was a candle burning just outside, and on the matting in the dark gallery outside.
I was surprised at this circumstance: but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to a trembling hand and left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of burning.
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and a door was Mr. Rochester's, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.
I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I was within Mr. Rochester's chamber.
Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire.
In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
"Wake!
wake!"
I cried.
I shook Mr. Rochester, but Mr. Rochester only murmured and turned: the smoke had stupefied Mr. Rochester.
Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets were kindling, I rushed to Mr. Rochester basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water.
I heaved both up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring my own water-jug.
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung from a trembling hand when I had emptied my own water-jug, and, above all, the splash of the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
Though it was now dark, I knew Mr. Rochester was awake; because I heard Mr. Rochester fulminating strange anathemas at finding Mr. Rochester lying in a pool of water.
"Is there a flood?"
Mr. Rochester cried.
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?"
Mr. Rochester demanded.
"What have you done with Mr. Rochester, witch, sorceress?
Who is in my own room besides Mr. Rochester?
Have you plotted to drown me?"
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.
Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
"There!
I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be -- yes, here is my dressing-gown.
Now run!"
I did run; I brought a candle.
Mr. Rochester took a candle from a trembling hand, held a candle up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and scorched, the very sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
"What is it?
and who did it?"
Mr. Rochester asked.
I briefly related to Mr. Rochester what had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the dark gallery outside: the step ascending to the third storey; the smoke, -- the smell of fire which had conducted me to Mr. Rochester room; in what state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged Mr. Rochester with all the water I could lay hands on.
Mr. Rochester listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern than astonishment; Mr. Rochester did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
"Shall I call Mrs.
Fairfax?"
I asked.
"Mrs. Fairfax?
No; what the deuce would you call Mrs. Fairfax for?
What can Mrs. Fairfax do?
Let Mrs. Fairfax sleep unmolested."
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and John wife."
"Not at all: just be still.
You have a shawl on.
If you are not warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap my cloak yonder about you, and sit down in the arm-chair: there, -- I will put my cloak yonder on.
Now place your feet on the stool, to keep them out of the wet.
I am going to leave you a few minutes.
I shall take a candle.
Remain where you are till I return; be as still as a mouse.
I must pay a visit to the second storey.
Don't move, remember, or call any one."
Mr. Rochester went: I watched the light withdraw.
Mr. Rochester passed up the dark gallery outside very softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible, shut the staircase door after Mr. Rochester, and the last ray vanished.
I was left in total darkness.
I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.
A very long time elapsed.
I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.
I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying Mr. Rochester orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I heard Mr. Rochester unshod feet tread the matting.
"I hope his unshod feet is Mr. Rochester," thought I, "and not something worse."
Mr. Rochester re-entered, pale and very gloomy.
"I have found it all out," said Mr. Rochester, setting Mr. Rochester candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
"How, sir?"
sir made no reply, but stood with sir arms folded, looking on the ground.
At the end of a few minutes sir inquired in rather a peculiar tone - "I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber door."
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
"But you heard an odd laugh?
You have heard an odd laugh, I should think, or something like an odd laugh?"
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole, -- a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole laughs in that way.
a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole is a singular person."
"Just so.
Grace Poole -- you have guessed it.
a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole is, as you say, singular -- very.
Well, I shall reflect on the subject.
Meantime, I am glad that you are the only person, besides Grace Poole, acquainted with the precise details of to-night's incident.
You are no talking fool: say nothing about it.
I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to the bed): "and now return to your own room.
I shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night.
It is near four:- in two hours the servants will be up."
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
sir seemed surprised -- very inconsistently so, as sir had just told me to go.
"What!"
sir exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
"You said I might go, sir."
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
Why, you have saved my life!
-- snatched me from a horrible and excruciating death!
and you walk past Grace Poole as if we were mutual strangers!
At least shake hands."
sir held out sir hand; I gave sir mine: sir took his hand first in one, them in both sir own.
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt.
I cannot say more.
Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to Grace Poole in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but you: it is different; -- I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
sir paused; gazed at Grace Poole: words almost visible trembled on sir lips,- -but sir voice was checked.
"Good-night again, sir.
There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation, in the case."
"I knew," sir continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some time; -- I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression and smile did not" -- (again sir stopped) -- "did not" (sir proceeded hastily) "strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.
People talk of natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth in the wildest fable.
My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in sir look.
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
"What!
you WILL go?"
"I am cold, sir."
"Cold?
Yes, -- and standing in a pool!
Go, then, Jane; go!"
But sir still retained my hand, and I could not free my hand.
I bethought Grace Poole of an expedient.
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
"Well, leave me:" sir relaxed sir fingers, and I was gone.
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.
Till morning dawned I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled under surges of joy.
I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I could not reach the bourne, even in fancy -- a counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back.
Sense would resist delirium: judgment would warn passion.
Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
