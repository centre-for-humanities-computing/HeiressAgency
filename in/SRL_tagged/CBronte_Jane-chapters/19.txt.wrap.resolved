The library looked tranquil enough as I entered The library, and the Sibyl -- if Sibyl Sibyl were -- was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-corner. Sibyl had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under Sibyl chin. An extinguished candle stood on the table; Sibyl was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: Sibyl muttered the words to Sibyl, as most old women do, while Sibyl read; Sibyl did not desist immediately on my entrance: it appeared Sibyl wished to finish a paragraph. I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's appearance to trouble one's calm. Sibyl shut a little black book and slowly looked up; Sibyl hat-brim partially shaded Sibyl face, yet I could see, as Sibyl raised a little black book, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown and black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under Sibyl chin, and came half over Sibyl cheeks, or rather jaws: Sibyl eye confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze. "Well, and you want your fortune told?" Sibyl said, in a voice as decided as Sibyl glance, as harsh as Sibyl features. "I don't care about it, mother; you may please mother: but I ought to warn you, I have no faith." "It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in your step as you crossed the threshold." "Did you? You've a quick ear." "I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain." "You need them all in your trade." "I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with. Why don't you tremble?" "I'm not cold." "Why don't you turn pale?" "I am not sick." "Why don't you consult my art?" "I'm not silly." The old crone "nichered" a laugh under The old crone " bonnet and bandage; The old crone " then drew out a short black pipe, and lighting a short black pipe began to smoke. Having indulged a while in this sedative, The old crone " raised The old crone " bent body, took a short black pipe from The old crone " lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very deliberately -- "You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly." "Prove it," I rejoined. "I will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone: no contact strikes the fire from you are alone that is in you. You are sick; because the best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away from man. You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits you." The old crone " again put The old crone " short black pipe to her lips, and renewed The old crone " smoking with vigour. "You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a solitary dependent in a great house." "I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any one?" "In my circumstances." "Yes; just so, in YOUR circumstances: but find me another precisely placed as you are." "It would be easy to find you thousands." "You could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are peculiarly situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The materials are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine The materials. Chance laid The materials somewhat apart; let The materials be once approached and bliss results." "I don't understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle in my life." "If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm." "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?" "To be sure." I gave The old crone " a shilling: The old crone " put a shilling into an old stocking-foot which The old crone " took out of The old crone " pocket, and having tied a shilling round and returned a shilling, The old crone " told me to hold out my hand. I did. The old crone " arched The old crone " face to your palm, and pored over her face without touching her face. "It is too fine," said The old crone ". "I can make nothing of such a hand as that; almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not written there." "I believe you," said I. "No," The old crone " continued, "it is in her face: on the forehead, about the eyes, in the lines of the mouth. Kneel, and lift up your head." "Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed The old crone ". "I shall begin to put some faith in you presently." I knelt within half a yard of The old crone ". The old crone " stirred the fire, so that a ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as The old crone " sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, her face illumined. "I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," The old crone " said, when The old crone " had examined me a while. "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic communion passing between you and the fine people as if the fine people were really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance." "I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad." "Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the future?" "Not I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to set up a school some day in a little house rented by me." "A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-seat (you see I know your habits ) -- " "You have learned your habits from the servants." "Ah! you think me sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I have an acquaintance with one of your habits, Mrs. Poole -- " I started to my feet when I heard the name. "You have -- have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business after all, then!" "Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in she. But, as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but your future school? Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? Is there not one face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?" "I like to observe all the faces and all the figures." "But do you never single one from the rest -- or it may be, two?" "I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a tale: it amuses me to watch them." "What tale do you like best to hear?" "Oh, I have not much choice! them generally run on the same theme -- courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe -- marriage." "And do you like that monotonous theme?" "Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me." "Nothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and health, charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you -- " "I what?" "You know -- and perhaps think well of." "I don't know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged a syllable with one of the gentlemen; and as to thinking well of the gentlemen, I consider some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young, dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly the gentlemen are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles the gentlemen please, without my feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me." "You don't know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged a syllable with one of the gentlemen? Will you say that of the master of the house!" "the master of the house is not at home." "A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! the master of the house went to Millcote this morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that circumstance exclude the master of the house from the list of your acquaintance -- blot the master of the house, as it were, out of existence?" "No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme you had introduced." "I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?" "Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of Mr. Rochester guests." "No question about a right to enjoy the society of his guests: but have you never observed that, of all the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with the most lively and the most continuous?" "The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator." I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice, manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream. One unexpected sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for weeks by my heart watching unseen spirit workings and taking record of every pulse. "Eagerness of a listener!" repeated her: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by the hour, Mr. Rochester ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given Mr. Rochester; you have noticed this?" "Grateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in Mr. Rochester face." "Detecting! You have analysed, then. And what did you detect, if not gratitude?" I said nothing. "You have seen love: have you not? -- and, looking forward, you have seen Mr. Rochester married, and beheld Mr. Rochester bride happy?" "Humph! Not exactly. Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes." "What the devil have you seen, then?" "Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that Mr. Rochester is to be married?" "Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram." "Shortly?" "Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question no doubt (), they will be a superlatively happy pair. Mr. Rochester must love such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves Mr. Rochester, or, if not Mr. Rochester person, at least Mr. Rochester purse. I know she considers the Mr. Rochester estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told she something on that point about an hour ago which made she look wondrous grave: the corners of she mouth fell half an inch. I would advise she blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or clearer rent-roll, -- another's dished -- " "But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to hear my own; and you have told me nothing of Mr. Rochester's fortune." "Mr. Rochester's fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait contradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that I know. I knew it before I came here this evening. she has laid it carefully on one side for mother. I saw she do it. it depends on yourself to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is the problem I study. Kneel again on the rug." "Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me." I knelt. she did not stoop towards mother, but only gazed, leaning back in she chair. she began muttering, - "The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; the eye looks soft and full of feeling; the eye smiles at my jargon: the eye is susceptible; impression follows impression through the eye clear sphere; where the eye ceases to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness. It turns from me; It will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made, -- to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion. The eye is favourable. "As to the mouth, the mouth delights at times in laughter; the mouth is disposed to impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay the brain would be silent on much the heart experiences. Mobile and flexible, the brain was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: the brain is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection for the brain interlocutor. That feature too is propitious. "I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow professes to say, -- 'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.' The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and Reason will not let the feelings burst away and hurry Reason to wild chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as The passions are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in every decision. Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of conscience.' "Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I have formed my plans -- right plans I deem them -- and in them I have attended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I know how soon youth would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution -- such is not my taste. I wish to foster, not to blight -- to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood -- no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet -- That will do. I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium. I should wish now to protract this moment ad infinitum; but I dare not. So far I have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as I inwardly swore I would act; but further might try me beyond my strength. Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; the play is played out'." Where was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming? Did I dream still? The old woman's voice had changed: The old woman accent, The old woman gesture, and all were familiar to myself as my own face in a glass -- as the speech of my own tongue. I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred the fire, and I looked again: but The old woman drew The old woman bonnet and The old woman bandage closer about The old woman face, and again beckoned me to depart. The flame illuminated The old woman hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once noticed her hand. her hand was no more the withered limb of eld than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before. Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from myself -- on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced. "Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice. "Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then -- " "But the string is in a knot -- help me." "Break it, sir." "There, then -- 'Off, ye lendings!'" And Mr. Rochester stepped out of Mr. Rochester disguise. "Now, sir, what a strange idea!" "But well carried out, eh? Don't you think so?" "With the ladies you must have managed well." "But not with you?" "You did not act the character of a gipsy with myself." "What character did I act? My own?" "No; some unaccountable one. In short, I believe you have been trying to draw me out -- or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense. It is scarcely fair, sir." "Do you forgive me, Jane?" "I cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on reflection, I find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you; but it was not right." "Oh, you have been very correct -- very careful, very sensible." I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a comfort; but, indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the interview. Something of masquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and fortune-tellers did not express gipsies and fortune-tellers as this seeming old woman had expressed this seeming old woman; besides I had noted this seeming old woman feigned voice, this seeming old woman anxiety to conceal this seeming old woman features. But my mind had been running on Grace Poole -- that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered this seeming old woman. I had never thought of Mr. Rochester. "Well," said Mr. Rochester, "what are you musing about? What does that grave smile signify?" "Wonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission to retire now, I suppose?" "No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room yonder are doing." "Discussing the gipsy, I daresay." "Sit down! -- Let me hear what the people in the drawing-room yonder said about me." "I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock. Oh, are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you left this morning?" "A stranger! -- no; who can it be? I expected no one; is Mr. Rochester gone?" "No; Mr. Rochester said Mr. Rochester had known you long, and that Mr. Rochester could take the liberty of installing Mr. Rochester here till you returned." "the devil Mr. Rochester did! Did Mr. Rochester give Mr. Rochester name?" "his name is Mason, sir; and Mr. Rochester comes from the West Indies; from Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think." Mr. Rochester was standing near Mr. Rochester; Mr. Rochester had taken my hand, as if to lead me to a chair. As I spoke Mr. Rochester gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile on Mr. Rochester lips froze: apparently a spasm caught Mr. Rochester breath. "Mason! -- the West Indies!" Mr. Rochester said, in the tone one might fancy a speaking automaton to enounce a speaking automaton single words; "Mason! -- the West Indies!" Mr. Rochester reiterated; and Mr. Rochester went over the syllables three times, growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: Mr. Rochester hardly seemed to know what Mr. Rochester was doing. "Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired. "Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!" Mr. Rochester staggered. "Oh, lean on Mr. Rochester, sir." "Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have your shoulder now." "Yes, sir, yes; and my arm." sir sat down, and made me sit beside sir. Holding my hand in both sir own, sir chafed his own; gazing on Mr. Rochester, at the same time, with the most troubled and dreary look. "My little friend!" said sir, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from My little friend." "Can I help you, sir? -- I'd give my life to serve you." "Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that." "Thank you, sir. Tell me what to do, -- I'll try, at least, to do it." "Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room will be at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room, and what Mason is doing." I went. I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr. Rochester had said; all the party in the dining-room were not seated at table, -- supper was arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what Mr. Rochester chose, and all the party in the dining-room stood about here and there in groups, all the party in the dining-room plates and glasses in all the party in the dining-room hands. Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and animated. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of Colonel and Mrs. Dent. I filled a wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: Miss Ingram thought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library. Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and Mr. Rochester looked once more firm and stern. Mr. Rochester took a wine-glass from my hand. "Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" Mr. Rochester said. Mr. Rochester swallowed the contents and returned the contents to Mr. Rochester. "What are they doing, Jane?" "Laughing and talking, sir." "they don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?" "Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety." "And Mason?" "Mr. Rochester was laughing too." "If all these people came in a body and spat at Mr. Rochester, what would you do, Jane?" "Turn all these people came in a body and spat at me out of the room, sir, if I could." Mr. Rochester half smiled. "But if I were to go to all these people came in a body and spat at me, and all these people came in a body and spat at me only looked at Mr. Rochester coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off and left me one by one, what then? Would you go with all these people came in a body and spat at me?" "I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with sir." "To comfort me?" "Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could." "And if all these people came in a body and spat at me laid you under a ban for adhering to Mr. Rochester?" "I, probably, should know nothing about all these people came in a body and spat at me ban; and if I did, I should care nothing about it." "Then, you could dare censure for my sake?" "I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as you, I am sure, do." "Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in Mason ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see Mason: show Mason in here and then leave me." "Yes, sir." I did Mason behest. The company all stared at Mr. Rochester as I passed straight among The company all. I sought Mason, delivered the message, and preceded Mason from the room: I ushered Mason into the library, and then I went upstairs. At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors repair to the visitors chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and heard Mason say, "This way, Mason; this is the room." Mason spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease. I was soon asleep.
