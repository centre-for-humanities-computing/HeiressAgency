A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still Mr. Rochester did not come.
Mrs. Fairfax said Mrs. Fairfax should not be surprised if Mr. Rochester were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show Mr. Rochester face again at Thornfield for a year to come; Mr. Rochester had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.
When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the heart.
I was actually permitting Mrs. Fairfax to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder -- how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital interest.
Not that I humbled Mrs. Fairfax by a slavish notion of inferiority: on the contrary, I just said - "You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to receive the salary the master of Thornfield gives you for teaching the master of Thornfield protegee, and to be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty, you have a right to expect at the master of Thornfield hands.
Be sure that is the only tie the master of Thornfield seriously acknowledges between you and the master of Thornfield; so don't make the master of Thornfield the object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.
the master of Thornfield is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised."
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check; advertisements might germinate and bear fruit if advertisements could.
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
"It is from the master," said Mrs. Fairfax, as Mrs. Fairfax looked at the direction.
"Now I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect Mr. Rochester return or not."
And while Mrs. Fairfax broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.
Why my hand shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my saucer, I did not choose to consider.
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still holding the note before Mrs. Fairfax spectacles.
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped Mrs. Fairfax also to another bun and refilled Mrs. Fairfax mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly - "Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
"Indeed he is -- in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and not alone either.
I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with he: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring the ladies maids and the gentlemen the ladies valets: so we shall have a full house of their valets."
And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed Mrs. Fairfax breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
The three days were, as Mrs. Fairfax had foretold, busy enough.
I had thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but all the rooms at Thornfield appears I was mistaken.
Three women were got to help; and such scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets, such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and the prospect of Three women arrival, seemed to throw Adele into ecstasies.
Adele would have Adele to look over all Adele "toilettes," as Adele called frocks; to furbish up any that were "passees," and to air and arrange the new.
For Adele, Adele did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.
From school duties Adele was exonerated: Adele had pressed me into Adele service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) Adele and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for dinner at six.
During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody -- Adele excepted.
Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.
This was when I chanced to see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched Adele glide along the gallery, Adele quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw Adele look into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms, -- just say a word, perhaps, to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.
Adele would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat Adele dinner, smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying Adele pot of porter with Adele, for Adele private solace, in Adele own gloomy, upper haunt.
Only one hour in the twenty-four did Adele pass with Adele fellow-servants below; all the rest of Adele time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there Adele sat and sewed -- and probably laughed drearily to Adele, -- as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except Adele, noticed Adele habits, or seemed to marvel at her habits: no one discussed Adele position or employment; no one pitied Adele solitude or isolation.
I once, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.
Leah had been saying something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked - "Leah gets good wages, I guess?"
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain of, -- there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives.
And Leah is laying by: Leah goes every quarter to the bank at Millcote.
I should not wonder but Leah has saved enough to keep Leah independent if Leah liked to leave; but I suppose Leah's got used to the place; and then Leah's not forty yet, and strong and able for anything.
It is too soon for Leah to give up business."
"Leah is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
"Ah!
-- Leah understands what Leah has to do, -- nobody better," rejoined Leah significantly; "and it is not every one could fill Leah shoes -- not for all the money Leah gets."
"That it is not!"
was the reply.
"I wonder whether the master -- " The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and Leah instantly gave Leah companion a nudge.
"Doesn't Leah know?"
I heard Leah whisper.
Leah shook Leah head, and the conversation was of course dropped.
All I had gathered from it amounted to this, -- that there was a mystery at Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely excluded.
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make hands.
The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all sides.
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed Mrs. Fairfax best black satin gown, Mrs. Fairfax gloves, and Mrs. Fairfax gold watch; for it was Mrs. Fairfax part to receive the company, -- to conduct the ladies to the ladies rooms, &c. Adele, too, would be dressed: though I thought c. Adele had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least.
However, to please c. Adele, I allowed Adele to apparel c. Adele in one of c. Adele short, full muslin frocks.
For c. Adele, I had no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum my sanctum of the schoolroom was now become to c. Adele, -- "a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
It had been a mild, serene spring day -- one of those days which, towards the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth as heralds of summer.
It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.
"I am glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for it is past six now.
I have sent John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote."
Mrs. Fairfax went to the window.
"Here John is!"
said Mrs. Fairfax.
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.
"They'll be here in ten minutes."
c. Adele flew to the window.
I followed, taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after four equestrians came two open carriages.
Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on Mr. Rochester black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before Mr. Rochester; at Mr. Rochester side rode a lady, and Mr. Rochester and a lady were the first of The party.
a lady purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, a lady veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with her veil transparent folds, and gleaming through four equestrians, shone rich raven ringlets.
"Miss Ingram!"
exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away Mrs. Fairfax hurried to Mrs. Fairfax post below.
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle of the house, and I lost sight of the house.
c. Adele now petitioned to go down; but I took c. Adele on my knee, and gave c. Adele to understand that c. Adele must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be very angry, &c. "Some natural tears c. Adele shed" on being told this; but as I began to look very grave, c. Adele consented at last to wipe them.
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming Mr. Rochester fair and gallant guests under the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall roof.
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement; and she sighed.
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais partout, au salon et e leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela on apprend."
"Don't you feel hungry, c.
Adele?"
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voile cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas mange."
"Well now, while the ladies are in the ladies rooms, I will venture down and get you something to eat."
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which conducted directly to the kitchen.
All in that region was fire and commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and the cook hung over the cook crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening spontaneous combustion.
In the servants' hall two coachmen and three gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.
Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.
I had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from the ladies chambers.
I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of the schoolroom doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
Presently their chambers gave up their chambers fair tenants one after another: each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk.
For a moment their chambers stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: their chambers then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill.
their chambers collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before received.
I found c. Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which c. Adele held ajar.
"What beautiful ladies!"
cried c. Adele in English.
"Oh, I wish I might go to What beautiful ladies!
Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for What beautiful ladies by-and-bye, after dinner?"
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
Never mind What beautiful ladies to-night; perhaps you will see What beautiful ladies to-morrow: here is your dinner."
c. Adele was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert c. Adele attention for a time.
It was well I secured this forage, or both c. Adele, I, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of What beautiful ladies repast, would have run a chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of What beautiful ladies.
The dessert was not carried out till after nine and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-cups.
I allowed c. Adele to sit up much later than usual; for c. Adele declared c. Adele could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and shutting below, and people bustling about.
Besides, c. Adele added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when c. Adele was undressed; "et alors quel dommage!"
I told c. Adele stories as long as c. Adele would listen to her stories; and then for a change I took c. Adele out into the gallery.
The hall lamp was now lit, and The hall lamp amused c. Adele to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards.
When the evening was far advanced, a sound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed; c. Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.
Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet c. Adele notes were.
The solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.
I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught those of Mr. Rochester, which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered by distance inarticulate, into words.
The clock struck eleven.
I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my shoulder; c. Adele eyes were waxing heavy, so I took c. Adele up in my arms and carried c. Adele off to bed.
It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought the gentlemen and ladies chambers.
The next day was as fine as The next day predecessor: The next day was devoted by The party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.
The party set out early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both the departure and the return.
Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at Mr. Rochester side; the two rode a little apart from the rest.
I pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me - "You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I, "but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers Mr. Rochester to any of the other ladies."
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt Mr. Rochester admires Mr.
Rochester."
"And Mr. Rochester him," I added; "look how Mr. Rochester leans Mr. Rochester head towards Mr. Rochester as if Mr. Rochester were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see Mr. Rochester face; I have never had a glimpse of her face yet."
"You will see Mr. Rochester this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.
"I happened to remark to Mr. Rochester how much c. Adele wished to be introduced to the ladies, and Mr. Rochester said: 'Oh!
let Mr. Rochester come into the drawing-room after dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany Mr.
Rochester.'"
"Yes; Mr. Rochester said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I answered.
"Well, I observed to Mr. Rochester that as you were unused to company, I did not think you would like appearing before so gay a party -- all strangers; and Mr. Rochester replied, in Mr. Rochester quick way -- 'Nonsense!
If Mr. Rochester objects, tell Mr. Rochester she objects is my particular wish; and if Mr. Rochester resists, say I shall come and fetch Mr. Rochester in case of contumacy.'"
"I will not give Mr. Rochester that trouble," I answered.
"I will go, if no better may be; but I don't like it.
Shall you be there, Mrs.
Fairfax?"
"No; I pleaded off, and Mr. Rochester admitted my plea.
I'll tell you how to manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is the most disagreeable part of the business.
You must go into the drawing-room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away -- nobody will notice you."
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.
After the Easter recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany Mr. Rochester: it surprises me that Mr. Rochester has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield."
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.
c. Adele had been in a state of ecstasy all day, after hearing c. Adele was to be presented to the ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation of dressing Sophie that Sophie sobered down.
Then the importance of the process quickly steadied Sophie, and by the time Sophie had Sophie curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, Sophie pink satin frock put on, Sophie long sash tied, and Sophie lace mittens adjusted, Sophie looked as grave as any judge.
No need to warn Sophie not to disarrange Sophie attire: when Sophie was dressed, Sophie sat demurely down in Sophie little chair, taking care previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear Sophie should crease the satin skirt, and assured me Sophie would not stir thence till I was ready.
This I quickly was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.
We descended.
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.
We found the apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned.
The crimson curtain hung before the arch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from The party in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of they conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to her.
I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near, endeavoured to read.
c. Adele brought c. Adele stool to my feet; ere long c. Adele touched my knee.
"What is it, c.
Adele?"
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques, mademoiselle?
Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' c. Adele: but you may have a flower."
And I took a rose from a vase and fastened a rose from a vase in her long sash.
c. Adele sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if c. Adele cup of happiness were now full.
I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
A soft sound of rising now became audible; The crimson curtain was swept back from the arch; through The crimson curtain appeared the dining-room, with The crimson curtain lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the opening; a band of ladies entered, and The crimson curtain fell behind a band of ladies.
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as a band of ladies flocked in, a band of ladies gave the impression of a much larger number.
Some of a band of ladies were very tall; many were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify Some of them persons as a mist magnifies the moon.
I rose and curtseyed to Some of them: one or two bent Some of them heads in return, the others only stared at me.
the others dispersed about the dining-room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of the others movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.
Some of the others threw Some of them in half-reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books: the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to Some of them.
I knew Some of them names afterwards, and may as well mention Some of them now.
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.
her had evidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.
Of her daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well.
The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term minois chiffone: both sisters were fair as lilies.
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect, very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen: Lady Lynn dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and within the circlet of a band of gems.
Mrs.
Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.
Mrs.
Colonel Dent had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.
Mrs.
Colonel Dent black satin dress, Mrs.
Colonel Dent scarf of rich foreign lace, and Mrs.
Colonel Dent pearl ornaments, pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
But the three most distinguished -- partly, perhaps, because the tallest figures of a band of gems -- were the Dowager Lady Ingram and Lady Ingram daughters, Blanche and Mary.
the tallest figures of the band -- were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, Blanche and Mary were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: The Dowager shape was still fine; The Dowager hair (by candle-light at least) still black; The Dowager teeth, too, were still apparently perfect.
Most people would have termed The Dowager a splendid woman of The Dowager age: and so The Dowager was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in The Dowager bearing and countenance.
The Dowager had Roman features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: Roman features and a double chin appeared to The Dowager not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost preternatural erectness.
The Dowager had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; The Dowager mouthed The Dowager words in speaking; The Dowager voice was deep, her voice inflections very pompous, very dogmatical, -- very intolerable, in short.
A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested The Dowager (I suppose The Dowager thought) with a truly imperial dignity.
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature, -- straight and tall as poplars.
Mary was too slim for Mary height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.
I regarded The Dowager, of course, with special interest.
First, I wished to see whether The Dowager appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description; secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted of The Dowager; and thirdly -- it will out!
-- whether it were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
As far as person went, Mary answered point for point, both to my picture and Mrs. Fairfax's description.
The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there; -- but Mary face?
her face was like Mary mother's; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.
It was not, however, so saturnine a pride!
Mary laughed continually; Mary laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of Mary arched and haughty lip.
Genius is said to be self-conscious.
I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram was a genius, but Miss Ingram was self-conscious -- remarkably self- conscious indeed.
Miss Ingram entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs. Dent.
It seemed Mrs.
Colonel Dent had not studied that science: though, as Miss Ingram said, Miss Ingram liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and Miss Ingram ran over its vocabulary with an air.
I presently perceived Miss Ingram was (what is vernacularly termed) TRAILING Mrs.
Colonel Dent; that is, playing on Miss Ingram ignorance -- Miss Ingram TRAIL might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-natured.
Miss Ingram played: Miss Ingram execution was brilliant; Miss Ingram sang: Miss Ingram was fine; Miss Ingram talked French apart to Miss Ingram mamma; and Miss Ingram talked it well, with fluency and with a good accent.
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram Ingram was dark as a Spaniard) -- but Mary was deficient in life: Mary face lacked expression, Mary eye lustre; Mary had nothing to say, and having once taken Mary seat, remained fixed like a statue in her seat niche.
The sisters were both attired in spotless white.
And did I now think Miss Ingram Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be likely to make?
I could not tell -- I did not know Mr. Rochester taste in female beauty.
If Mr. Rochester liked the majestic, Miss Ingram was the very type of majesty: then Miss Ingram was accomplished, sprightly.
Most gentlemen would admire Miss Ingram, I thought; and that Mr. Rochester DID admire Miss Ingram, I already seemed to have obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see proof together.
You are not to suppose, reader, that c. Adele has all this time been sitting motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, Miss Ingram rose, advanced to meet the ladies, made a stately reverence, and said with gravity - "Bon jour, mesdames."
And Miss Ingram Ingram had looked down at Miss Ingram with a mocking air, and exclaimed, "Oh, what a little puppet!"
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose -- the little French girl Mr. Rochester's ward was speaking of."
Mrs.
Colonel Dent had kindly taken Mrs.
Colonel Dent hand, and given Mrs.
Colonel Dent a kiss.
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously -- "What a love of a child!"
And then they had called Mrs.
Colonel Dent to a sofa, where Mrs.
Colonel Dent now sat, ensconced between they, chattering alternately in French and broken English; absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to Mrs.
Colonel Dent heart's content.
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.
I sit in the shade -- if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the window-curtain half hides me.
Again the arch yawns; they come.
The collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of they are tall, some young.
Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and Mrs.
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.
Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which gives his something of the appearance of a "pere noble de theatre."
Miss Ingram, like The sisters, is very tall; like The sisters, also, Miss Ingram is handsome; but Miss Ingram shares Mary's apathetic and listless look: Miss Ingram seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain.
And where is Mr. Rochester?
Mr. Rochester comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see Mr. Rochester enter.
I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes of the purse I am forming -- I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold Mr. Rochester figure, and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw his figure; just after I had rendered Mr. Rochester, what Mr. Rochester deemed, an essential service, and Mr. Rochester, holding my hand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.
How near had I approached Mr. Rochester at that moment!
What had occurred since, calculated to change Mr. Rochester and my relative positions?
Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!
So far estranged, that I did not expect Mr. Rochester to come and speak to me.
I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, Mr. Rochester took a seat at the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
No sooner did I see that Mr. Rochester attention was riveted on some of the ladies, and that I might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily to Mr. Rochester face; I could not keep some of the ladies lids under control: some of the ladies would rise, and the irids would fix on Mr. Rochester.
I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking, -- a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which the thirst-perishing man has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."
My master's colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth, -- all energy, decision, will, -- were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me, -- that took my feelings from my own power and fettered they in his.
I had not intended to love his; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of his, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong!
his made me love his without looking at me.
I compared his with his guests.
What was the gallant grace of the Lynns, the languid elegance of Miss Ingram, -- even the military distinction of Mrs.
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
I had no sympathy in no sympathy appearance, no sympathy expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call most observers attractive, handsome, imposing; while most observers would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking.
I saw most observers smile, laugh -- it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as most observers smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as most observers laugh.
I saw Mr. Rochester smile:- Mr. Rochester smile:- stern features softened; Mr. Rochester smile:- eye grew both brilliant and gentle, Mr. Rochester smile:- ray both searching and sweet.
Mr. Rochester smile:- was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton.
I wondered to see Louisa and Amy Eshton receive with calm that look which seemed to Mr. Rochester smile:- so penetrating: I expected Louisa and Amy Eshton eyes to fall, Louisa and Amy Eshton colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found Louisa and Amy Eshton were in no sense moved.
"Mr. Rochester smile:- is not to Louisa and Amy Eshton what Mr. Rochester smile:- is to Mr. Rochester smile:-," I thought: "Mr. Rochester smile:- is not of Louisa and Amy Eshton kind.
I believe Mr. Rochester smile:- is of mine; -- I am sure Mr. Rochester smile:- is -- I feel akin to Mr. Rochester smile:- -- I understand the language of Mr. Rochester smile:- countenance and movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to Mr. Rochester smile:-.
Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with Mr. Rochester smile:- but to receive my salary at Mr. Rochester smile:- hands?
Did I forbid Mr. Rochester smile:- to think of Mr. Rochester smile:- in any other light than as a paymaster?
Blasphemy against nature!
Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round Mr. Rochester smile:-.
I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that Mr. Rochester smile:- cannot care much for Mr. Rochester smile:-.
For when I say that I am of Mr. Rochester smile:- kind, I do not mean that I have Mr. Rochester smile:- force to influence, and Mr. Rochester smile:- spell to attract; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with Mr. Rochester smile:-.
I must, then, repeat continually that us are for ever sundered:- and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love Mr. Rochester smile:-."
Coffee is handed.
The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.
Colonel Dent and Amy Eshton argue on politics; Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton wives listen.
The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.
Sir George -- whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe, -- a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before Sir George -- whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe, -- a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman sofa, coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.
Lady Lynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing Lady Lynn the engravings of a splendid volume: Lady Lynn looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says little.
The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; Lady Lynn glances up at Lady Lynn, and chatters like a wren: Lady Lynn likes Lady Lynn better than Lady Lynn does Mr. Rochester.
Lady Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of Louisa: c. Adele shares it with Lady Lynn: Lady Lynn is trying to talk French with c. Adele, and Louisa laughs at Lady Lynn blunders.
With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
c. Adele is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.
c. Adele seems waiting to be sought; but c. Adele will not wait too long: c. Adele selects a mate.
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as solitary as c. Adele stands by the table: c. Adele confronts Mr. Rochester, taking c. Adele station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
"Nor am I."
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
(pointing to c. Adele).
"Where did you pick c. Adele up?"
"I did not pick c. Adele up; c. Adele was left on my hands."
"You should have sent c. Adele to school."
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for c. Adele: I saw a person with c. Adele just now -- is c. Adele gone?
Oh, no!
there c. Adele is still, behind the window-curtain.
You pay c. Adele, of course; I should think it quite as expensive, -- more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
I feared -- or should I say, hoped?
-- the allusion to me would make Mr. Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the shade: but Mr. Rochester never turned Mr. Rochester eyes.
"I have not considered the subject," said Mr. Rochester indifferently, looking straight before Mr. Rochester.
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.
You should hear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think, a dozen at least in Mary and I day; half of Mary and I detestable and the rest ridiculous, and all incubi -- were Mary and I not, mama?"
"Did you speak, my own?"
Mr. Rochester thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated Mr. Rochester question with an explanation.
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.
I have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.
I thank Heaven I have now done with their!"
Mrs. Dent here bent over to Mr. Rochester and whispered something in Mr. Rochester ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of the anathematised race was present.
"Tant pis!"
said Mr. Rochester Ladyship, "I hope her Ladyship may do Mr. Rochester good!"
Then, in a lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed Mr. Rochester; I am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of Mr. Rochester class."
"What are they, madam?"
inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied Mr. Rochester, wagging Mr. Rochester turban three times with portentous significancy.
"But my curiosity will be past my curiosity appetite; my curiosity craves food now."
"Ask Blanche; Ask Blanche is nearer you than I."
"Oh, don't refer Ask Blanche to me, mama!
I have just one word to say of the whole tribe; just one word to say of the whole tribe are a nuisance.
Not that I ever suffered much from just one word to say of the whole tribe; I took care to turn the tables.
What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!
Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.
The best fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on Mrs. Grey.
But Madame JoubertMadame Joubert!
I see Miss Wilson yet in Miss Wilson raging passions, when our had driven Miss Wilson to extremities -- spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons.
Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Miss Ingram; "and the poor old stick used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'
-- and then our sermonised Miss Wilson on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as our were, when Miss Wilson was Miss Wilson so ignorant."
"our did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining -- the parson in the pip, as our used to call him.
him and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other -- at least Tedo and I thought so; our surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which our interpreted as tokens of 'la belle passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our discovery; our employed the public as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights from the house.
Dear mama, there, as soon as Dear mama got an inkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.
Did you not, my lady-mother?"
"Certainly, my best.
And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly -- " "Oh, gracious, mama!
Spare us the enumeration!
Au reste, we all know Au reste: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached -- mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting -- insolence accompanying -- mutiny and general blow-up.
Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with Amy Eshton soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but Louisa was such a good creature, Louisa would bear anything: nothing put Louisa out.
Louisa was never cross with our; was Louisa, Louisa?"
"No, never: our might do what our pleased; ransack Louisa desk and Louisa workbox, and turn Louisa drawers inside out; and Louisa was so good- natured, Louisa would give our anything our asked for."
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling Louisa lip sarcastically, "we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new topic.
Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
"Louisa, I support you on this point, as on every other."
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.
Signior Eduardo, are you in voice to-night?"
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
"Then, signior, I lay on "Donna Bianca my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs and other vocal organs, as other vocal organs will be wanted on my royal service."
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
"A fig for Rizzio!"
cried a Mary, tossing a Mary head with all a Mary curls, as a Mary moved to the piano.
"It is my opinion the fiddler David must have been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in a man; and history may say what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, a man was just the sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my hand."
"Gentlemen, you hear!
Now which of "Donna Bianca most resembles black Bothwell?"
cried Mr. Rochester.
"I should say the preference lies with "Donna Bianca," responded Colonel Dent.
"On my honour, I am much obliged to "Donna Bianca," was the reply.
Miss Ingram, who had now seated a Mary with proud grace at the piano, spreading out a Mary snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant prelude; talking meantime.
a Mary appeared to be on a Mary high horse to-night; both a Mary words and a Mary air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration, but the amazement of a Mary auditors: a Mary was evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!"
exclaimed a Mary, rattling away at the instrument.
"Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's permission and guardianship!
Creatures so absorbed in care about Creatures pretty faces, and Creatures white hands, and Creatures small feet; as if a man had anything to do with beauty!
As if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman -- woman legitimate appanage and heritage!
I grant an ugly WOMAN is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the GENTLEMEN, let the GENTLEMEN be solicitous to possess only strength and valour: let the GENTLEMEN motto be:- Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a fillip.
Such should be my device, were I a man."
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted, "I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.
I will suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage: the throne devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape the throne sees in the throne mirror.
Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for Mr.
Rochester."
"I am all obedience," was the response.
"Here then is a Corsair-song.
Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that reason, sing a Corsair-song con spirito."
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and water."
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how such things SHOULD be done."
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to fail."
"Gardez-vous en bien!
If you err wilfully, I shall devise a proportionate punishment."
"Miss Ingram Ingram ought to be clement, for Miss Ingram has it in Miss Ingram power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
"Ha!
explain!"
commanded Mr. Rochester.
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital punishment."
"Sing!"
said Miss Ingram, and again touching the piano, Miss Ingram commenced an accompaniment in spirited style.
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed the air arrested me.
Miss Ingram had said Mr. Rochester possessed a fine voice: Mr. Rochester did -- a mellow, powerful bass, into which Mr. Rochester threw Mr. Rochester own feeling, Mr. Rochester own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and there waking sensation strangely.
I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired -- till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had resumed an instant flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near.
Thence a narrow passage led into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the staircase.
I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with a gentleman: it was Mr. Rochester.
"How do you do?"
Mr. Rochester asked.
"I am very well, sir."
"Why did you not come and speak to Mr. Rochester in the room?"
I thought I might have retorted the question on Mr. Rochester who put it: but I would not take that freedom.
I answered - "I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
"And getting a good deal paler than you were -- as I saw at first sight.
What is the matter?"
"Nothing at all, sir."
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
"Not the least."
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
"I am tired, sir."
sir looked at Mr. Rochester for a minute.
"And a little depressed," sir said.
"What about?
Tell me."
"Nothing -- nothing, sir.
I am not depressed."
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would bring tears to your eyes -- indeed, you are are there now, shining and swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a servant passing, I would know what all this means.
Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect it.
Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.
Good-night, my -- " He stopped, bit He lip, and abruptly left me.
