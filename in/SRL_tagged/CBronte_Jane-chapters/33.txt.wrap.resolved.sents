When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm continued all night.
The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.
I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under a mat, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down "Marmion," and beginning - "Day set on Norham's castled steep, And Tweed's fair river broad and deep, And Cheviot's mountains lone; The massive towers, the donjon keep, The flanking walls that round them sweep, In yellow lustre shone" - I soon forgot storm in music.
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.
No; a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door was St. John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen hurricane -- the howling darkness -- and stood before me: the cloak that covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.
I was almost in consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up vale that night.
"Any ill news?"
I demanded.
"Has anything happened?"
"No.
How very easily alarmed you are!"
he answered, removing he cloak and hanging his cloak up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed the mat which he entrance had deranged.
he stamped the snow from he boots.
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse me for once."
Then he approached the fire.
"I have had hard work to get here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed he hands over the flame.
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
"But why are you come?"
I could not forbear saying.
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms.
Besides, since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half- told, and who is impatient to hear the sequel."
he sat down.
I recalled he singular conduct of yesterday, and really I began to fear he wits were touched.
If he were insane, however, he was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that handsome-featured face of he look more like chiselled marble than it did just now, as he put aside he snow-wet hair from he forehead and let the firelight shine free on he pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend; but he hand was now at he chin, he finger on he lip: he was thinking.
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble.
A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say - "I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own health."
"Not at all," said he: "I care for he when necessary.
I am well now.
What do you see amiss in he?"
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.
I was silenced.
his still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something, I asked his presently if his felt any cold draught from the door, which was behind his.
"No, no!"
his responded shortly and somewhat testily.
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you alone now, and return to my book."
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."
his soon stirred; his eye was instantly drawn to his movements; his only took out a morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which his read in silence, folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.
it was vain to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in impatience, consent to be dumb; his might rebuff me if his liked, but talk I would.
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?
You will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."
Baffled so far, I changed my ground.
I bethought me to talk about the school and my scholars.
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close -- four new girls would have come to-day but for the snow."
"Indeed!"
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
"Does Mr.
Oliver?"
"Mr. Oliver means to give the school a treat at Christmas."
"I know."
"Was it your suggestion?"
"No."
"Whose, then?"
"Mr. Oliver daughter's, I think."
"It is like His daughter: His daughter is so good-natured."
"Yes."
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.
It aroused him; him uncrossed him legs, sat erect, turned to me.
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," him said.
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
"Half-an-hour ago," him pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips.
For the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate -- never mind a poor curate name at this moment -- fell in love with a rich man's daughter; a rich man's daughter fell in love with a poor curate, and married a poor curate, against the advice of all a rich man's daughter friends, who consequently disowned a rich man's daughter immediately after the wedding.
Before two years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
(I have seen the rash pair grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in -shire.)
the rash pair left a daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap -- cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night.
Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; its was reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.
You start -- did you hear a noise?
I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had a barn repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.
-- To proceed.
Mrs. Reed of Gateshead kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or not with Mrs. Reed of Gateshead, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of that time Mrs. Reed of Gateshead transferred it to a place you know -- being no other than Lowood School, where you so long resided Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.
It seems Mrs. Reed of Gateshead career there was very honourable: from a pupil, Mrs. Reed of Gateshead became a teacher, like yourself -- really it strikes me there are parallel points in Mrs. Reed of Gateshead history and yourself -- Mrs. Reed of Gateshead left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were analogous; Mrs. Reed of Gateshead undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
Rochester."
"Mr.
Rivers!"
I interrupted.
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain your feelings for a while: I have nearly finished; hear me to the end.
Of Mr. Rochester's character I know nothing, but the one fact that Mr. Rochester's character professed to offer honourable marriage to Mrs. Reed of Gateshead, and that at the very altar Mrs. Reed of Gateshead discovered Mr. Rochester's character had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.
What Mr. Rochester's character subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry after a governess necessary, an event was discovered Mrs. Reed of Gateshead was gone -- no one could tell when, where, or how.
Mrs. Reed of Gateshead had left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after Mrs. Reed of Gateshead course had been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of information could be gathered respecting Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.
Yet that Mrs. Reed of Gateshead should be found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.
Is it not an odd tale?"
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can tell this me -- what of Mr. Rochester?
How and where is Mr. Rochester?
What is Mr. Rochester doing?
Is Mr. Rochester well?"
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: a letter never mentions Mr. Rochester but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
You should rather ask the name of a governess -- the nature of the event which requires a governess appearance."
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?
Did no one see Mr.
Rochester?"
"I suppose not."
"But they wrote to Mr.
Rochester?"
"Of course."
"And what did Mr. Rochester say?
Who has Mr. Rochester letters?"
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to Mr. Briggs application was not from Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: the answer to his application was not from Mr. Rochester is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: Mr. Rochester had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the Continent.
And what opiate for Mr. Rochester severe sufferings -- what object for Mr. Rochester strong passions -- had Mr. Rochester sought there?
I dared not answer the question.
Oh, my poor master -- once almost my husband -- whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
"Mr. Rochester must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
"You don't know Mr. Rochester -- don't pronounce an opinion upon Mr. Rochester," I said, with warmth.
"Very well," Mr. Rochester answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise occupied than with Mr. Rochester: I have my tale to finish.
Since you won't ask the governess's name, I must tell the governess's name of my own accord.
Stay!
I have the governess's name here -- the governess's name is always more satisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black and white."
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought through; from one of the pocket-book compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in the pocket-book texture and the pocket-book stains of ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the portrait-cover.
Mr. Rochester got up, held the portrait-cover close to my eyes: and I read, traced in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE" -- the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
"Mr. Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" Mr. Briggs said, "the advertisements demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.
-- I confess I had my suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon "the advertisements were at once resolved into certainty.
You own the name and renounce the alias?"
"Yes -- yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?
Mr. Briggs perhaps knows more of Mr. Rochester than you do."
"Mr. Briggs is in London.
I should doubt Mr. Briggs knowing anything at all about Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester Mr. Briggs is interested.
Meantime, you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought after you -- what Mr. Briggs wanted with you."
"Well, what did Mr. Briggs want?"
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that Mr. Briggs has left you all Mr. Briggs property, and that you are now rich -- merely that -- nothing more."
"I!
-- rich?"
"Yes, you, rich -- quite an heiress."
Silence succeeded.
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate possession.
Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Mr. Briggs has the will and the necessary documents."
Here was a new card turned up!
It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted in a moment from indigence to wealth -- a very fine thing; but not a matter one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.
And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: THIS is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all it associations are solid and sober, and it manifestations are the same.
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah!
at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain we, and brood over we bliss with a solemn brow.
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words, Death, Funeral.
My uncle I had heard was dead -- my only relative; ever since being made aware of my only relative existence, I had cherished the hope of one day seeing my only relative: now, I never should.
And then this money came only to me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.
It was a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious -- yes, I felt that -- that thought swelled my heart.
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.
"I thought Medusa had looked at Hannah, and that you were turning to stone.
Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth?"
"How much am I worth?"
"Oh, a trifle!
Nothing of course to speak of -- twenty thousand pounds, I think they say -- but what is that?"
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
Here was a new stunner -- I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had never heard laugh before, laughed now.
"Well," said Mr. St. John, whom I had never heard laugh before, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
"It is a large sum -- don't you think there is a mistake?"
"No mistake at all."
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong -- it may be two thousand!"
"it is written in letters, not figures, -- twenty thousand."
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred.
Mr. Rivers rose now and put Mr. Rivers cloak on.
"If it were not such a very wild night," Mr. Rivers said, "I would send Mr. Rivers down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left alone.
But Hannah, poor woman!
could not stride the drifts so well as Mr. Rivers: Mr. Rivers legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
Good-night."
Mr. Rivers was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to Mr. Rivers.
"Stop one minute!"
I cried.
"Well?"
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about Mr. Briggs; or how Mr. Briggs knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
"Oh!
I am a clergyman," Mr. Briggs said; "and the clergy are often appealed to about odd matters."
Again the latch rattled.
"No; that does not satisfy me!"
I exclaimed: and indeed there was something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more about It."
"Another time."
"No; to-night!
-- to-night!"
and as Mr. Briggs turned from the door, I placed Mr. Rivers between it and Mr. Briggs.
Mr. Briggs looked rather embarrassed.
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
"I would rather not just now."
"You shall!
-- you must!"
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it must be, and that without delay; and I told Mr. Briggs so.
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said Mr. Briggs, "difficult to persuade."
"And I am a hard woman, -- impossible to put off."
"And then," Mr. Briggs pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.
The blaze there has thawed all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, The blaze there has streamed on to my floor, and made The blaze there like a trampled street.
As you hope ever to be forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
"Well, then," Mr. Briggs said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.
Besides, you must know some day, -- as well now as later.
Your name is Jane Eyre?"
"Of course: that was all settled before."
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?
-- that I was christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
"No, indeed!
I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I never asked for what name what name stood.
But what then?
Surely -- " I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express, the thought that rushed upon myself -- that embodied itself, -- that, in a second, stood out a strong, solid probability.
Circumstances knit Circumstances, fitted Circumstances, shot into order: the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight, -- every ring was perfect, the connection complete.
I knew, by instinct, how the matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat St. John had said another word explanation.
"My mother's name was Eyre; My mother had two brothers; one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.
Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's solicitor, wrote to one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira last August to inform one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira of one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira uncle's death, and to say that our uncle had left our uncle property to our uncle brother the clergyman's orphan daughter, overlooking one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira, in consequence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between our uncle and my father.
our uncle wrote again a few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira knew anything of the heiress.
A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find the heiress out.
You know the rest."
Again our uncle was going, but I set my back against the door.
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and reflect."
I paused -- our uncle stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed enough.
I resumed - "Your mother was my father's sister?"
"Yes."
"My aunt, consequently?"
our uncle bowed.
"our uncle was your uncle John?
You, Diana, and Mary are John sister's children, as I am John brother's child?"
"Undeniably."
"You three, then, are my cousins; half one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira blood on each side flows from the same source?"
"one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira are cousins; yes."
I surveyed our uncle.
It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud of, -- one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that, when I knew them but as mere strangers, them had inspired me with genuine affection and admiration.
The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair, were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at our uncle threshold was my blood relation.
Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch!
This was wealth indeed!
-- wealth to the heart!
-- a mine of pure, genial affections.
This was a blessing, bright, vivid, and exhilarating; -- not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and welcome enough in This way, but sobering from This weight.
I now clapped my hands in sudden joy -- my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
"Oh, I am glad!
-- I am glad!"
I exclaimed.
St. John smiled.
"Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue trifles?"
St. John asked.
"You were serious when I told you you had got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
"What can you mean?
It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations, -- or two, if you don't choose to be counted, -- are born into my world full-grown.
I say again, I am glad!"
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle them:- thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere long.
I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars, -- every one lit me to a purpose or delight.
Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly were under a yoke, -- I could free Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly: Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly were scattered, -- I could reunite Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly too.
Were Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly not four?
Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each, justice -- enough and to spare: justice would be done, -- mutual happiness secured.
Now the wealth did not weigh on St. John: now the wealth was not a mere bequest of coin, -- the wealth was a legacy of life, hope, enjoyment.
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind St. John, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on a chair.
Mr. Rivers also advised me to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction, shook off Mr. Rivers hand, and began to walk about again.
"Write to Diana, and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell Diana, and Mary to come home directly.
Diana said Diana, and Mary would Diana, and Mary consider Diana, and Mary rich with a thousand pounds, so with five thousand Diana, and Mary will do very well."
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
"Nonsense!
and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on Diana?
Will the bequest keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down like an ordinary mortal?"
"You wander: your head becomes confused.
I have been too abrupt in communicating the news; the news has excited you beyond your strength."
"Mr. Rivers!
you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should comprehend better."
"Explain!
What is there to explain?
You cannot fail to see that twenty thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?
What I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell your sisters of the fortune that has accrued to your sisters."
"To you, you mean."
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any other.
I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly ungrateful.
Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.
I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana , and I will attach yourself for life to Diana .
It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; It would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice, though mine in justice might in law.
I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely superfluous to yourself.
Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
"Oh!
if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of the case?"
"I DO see a certain justice; but a certain justice is contrary to all custom.
Besides, the entire fortune is your right: our uncle gained the entire fortune by our uncle own efforts; our uncle was free to leave the entire fortune to whom our uncle would: our uncle left the entire fortune to you.
After all, justice permits you to keep the entire fortune: you may, with a clear conscience, consider the entire fortune absolutely your own."
"With yourself," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an opportunity of doing so.
Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a glimpse -- that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to yourself lifelong friends."
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place the place would enable you to take in society; of the prospects the place would open to you: you cannot -- " "And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for fraternal and sisterly love.
I never had a home, I never had brothers or sisters; I must and will have brothers or sisters now: you are not reluctant to admit me and own me, are you?"
"Jane, I will be your brother -- my sisters will be your sisters -- without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
"Brother?
Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!
Sisters?
Yes; slaving amongst strangers!
I, wealthy -- gorged with gold I never earned and do not merit!
You, penniless!
Famous equality and fraternisation!
Close union!
Intimate attachment!"
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
"Nonsense, again!
Marry!
I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the excitement under which you labour."
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.
No one would take me for love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation.
And I do not want a stranger -- unsympathising, alien, different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-feeling.
Say again you will be your brother: when you uttered the words I was satisfied, happy; repeat whom, if you can, repeat whom sincerely."
"I think I can.
I know I have always loved your sisters; and I know on what my affection for whom is grounded, -- respect for whom worth and admiration of whom talents.
You too have principle and mind: your tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace.
I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my heart for your brother, as my third and youngest sister."
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.
Now you had better go; for if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple."
"And the school, Miss Eyre?
It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
"No.
I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and He took leave.
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.
My task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved -- as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the property -- as they must in they own hearts have felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do -- they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point.
The instruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.
