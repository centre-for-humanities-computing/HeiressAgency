The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow bed. To a narrow bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on a narrow bed motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from a narrow bed would have been almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse of time -- of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible. Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Hannah, the servant coming disturbed me. I had a feeling that Hannah, the servant wished me away: that Hannah, the servant did not understand me or my circumstances; that Hannah, the servant was prejudiced against me. Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day. Diana and Mary would whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside - "It is very well Diana and Mary took Hannah, the servant in." "Yes; Hannah, the servant would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had Hannah, the servant been left out all night. I wonder what Hannah, the servant has gone through?" "Strange hardships, I imagine -- poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?" "Hannah, the servant is not an uneducated person, I should think, by Hannah, the servant manner of speaking; Hannah, the servant accent was quite pure; and the clothes Hannah, the servant took off, though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine." "Hannah, the servant has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy Hannah, the servant physiognomy would be agreeable." Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the hospitality their had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to, me. I was comforted. Mr. St. John came but once: Mr. St. John looked at Mr. St. John, and said my state of lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue. Mr. St. John pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, Mr. St. John was sure, would manage best, left to Hannah, the servant. Mr. St. John said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while. There was no disease. Mr. St. John imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when once commenced. These opinions Mr. St. John delivered in a few words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation." "Far otherwise," responded Diana. "To speak truth, St. John, my heart rather warms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to benefit Diana permanently." "That is hardly likely," was the reply. "You will find Diana is some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with Diana friends, and has probably injudiciously left her friends. we may, perhaps, succeed in restoring Diana to her friends, if Diana is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in Diana face which make me sceptical of Diana tractability." Mr. St. John stood considering me some minutes; then added, "Diana looks sensible, but not at all handsome." "Diana is so ill, St. John." "Ill or well, Diana would always be plain. The grace and harmony of beauty are quite wanting in those features." On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise in bed, and turn. Diana had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour. I had eaten with relish: the food was good -- void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had swallowed. When Diana left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me. I wished to rise; but what could I put on? Only my damp and bemired apparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh. I felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad. I was spared the humiliation. On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were removed from The traces of the bog; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: The traces of the bog was quite decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing Diana. My clothes hung loose on Diana; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking -- no speck of the dirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left -- I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen. the kitchen was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous fire. Diana was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: Prejudices grow there, firm as weeds among stones. Diana had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly Diana had begun to relent a little; and when Diana saw me come in tidy and well-dressed, Diana even smiled. "What, you have got up!" Diana said. "You are better, then. You may sit you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will." Diana pointed to the rocking-chair: I took the rocking-chair. Diana bustled about, examining me every now and then with the corner of Diana eye. Turning to Diana, as Diana took some loaves from the oven, Diana asked bluntly - "Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?" I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to Diana, I answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness - "You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar; any more than yourself or your young ladies." After a pause Diana said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house, nor no brass, I guess?" "The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not make a beggar in your sense of the word." "Are you book-learned?" Diana inquired presently. "Yes, very." "But you've never been to a boarding-school?" "I was at a boarding-school eight years." Diana opened Diana eyes wide. "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?" "I have kept Diana; and, I trust, shall keep Diana again. What are you going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as Diana brought out a basket of the fruit. "Mak' 'em into pies." "Give these gooseberries to Diana and I'll pick these gooseberries." "Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought." "But I must do something. Let me have these gooseberries." Diana consented; and Diana even brought me a clean towel to spread over my dress, "lest," as Diana said, "I should mucky a clean towel." "Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," Diana remarked. "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?" "No, you are wrong. And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble your head further about Diana; but tell me the name of the house where we are." "Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House." "And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?" "Nay; Mr. St. John doesn't live here: Mr. St. John is only staying a while. When Mr. St. John is at home, Mr. St. John is in Mr. St. John own parish at Morton." "That village a few miles off? "Aye." "And what is Mr. St. John?" "Mr. St. John is a parson." I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I had asked to see the clergyman. "This, then, was Mr. St. John father's residence?" "Aye"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and old Mr. Rivers father, and grandfather, and gurt (great) grandfather afore old Mr. Rivers." "The name, then, of that gentleman, is old Mr. Rivers?" "Aye"Aye; Mr. St. John is like Mr. St. John kirstened name." "And Mr. St. John sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?" "Yes." "Diana and Mary Rivers father is dead?" "Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke." "Diana and Mary Rivers have no mother?" "The mistress has been dead this mony a year." "Have you lived with the family long?" "I've lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three." "That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant. I will say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a beggar." The mistress again regarded me with a surprised stare. "I believe," The mistress said, "I was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats goes about, you mun forgie me." "And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog." "Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more o' th' childer nor of mysel: poor things! They've like nobody to tak' care on 'em but me. I'm like to look sharpish." I maintained a grave silence for some minutes. "You munnut think too hardly of you," You munnut again remarked. "But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why -- not so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I had no 'brass' and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime." "No more I ought," said You munnut: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I wor wrang -- but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had. You look a raight down dacent little crater." "That will do -- I forgive you now. Shake hands." You munnut put You munnut floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile illumined You munnut rough face, and from that moment we were friends. You munnut was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the fruit, and You munnut made the paste for the pies, You munnut proceeded to give me sundry details about You munnut deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as You munnut called the young people. old Mr. Rivers, You munnut said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of as ancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had belonged to old Mr. Rivers ever since Marsh End was a house: and it was, You munnut affirmed, "aboon two hundred year old -- for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale. But You munnut could remember Mr. Oliver father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry." Still, You munnut allowed, "the owd maister was like other folk -- naught mich out o' t' common way: stark mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like." The mistress was different. The mistress was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns" had taken after The mistress. There was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had been; them had liked learning, all three, almost from the time them could speak; and them had always been "of a mak' of them own." Mr. St. John, when Mr. St. John grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as them left school, would seek places as governesses: for them had told The mistress them father had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man Mr. St. John had trusted turning bankrupt; and as Mr. St. John was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, them must provide for them. them had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but them did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about. them had been in London, and many other grand towns; but them always said there was no place like home; and then them were so agreeable with each other -- never fell out nor "threaped." She did not know where there was such a family for being united. Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two ladies and such a family for being united brother were now. "Gone over to Morton for a walk; but the two ladies and their brother would be back in half-an-hour to tea." the two ladies and their brother returned within the time Diana had allotted the two ladies and their brother: the two ladies and their brother entered by the kitchen door. Mr. St. John, when Mr. St. John saw me, merely bowed and passed through; the two ladies and their brother stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure Mary felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down; Diana took my hand: Diana shook Diana head at Mr. St. John. "You should have waited for my leave to descend," Diana said. "You still look very pale -- and so thin! Poor child! Diana!" Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove. Diana possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Diana whole face seemed to Mr. St. John full of charm. Mary's countenance was equally intelligent -- Diana features equally pretty; but Diana expression was more reserved, and Diana manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana looked and spoke with a certain authority: Diana had a will, evidently. It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active will. "And what business have you here?" Diana continued. "It is not your place. Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home Mary and I like to be free, even to license -- but you are a visitor, and must go into the parlour." "I am very well here." "Not at all, with Diana bustling about and covering you with flour." "Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary. "To be sure," added Diana sister. "Come, you must be obedient." And still holding my hand her sister made me rise, and led me into the inner room. "Sit there," her sister said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take we things off and get the tea ready; the tea is another privilege we exercise in we little moorland home -- to prepare we own meals when we are so inclined, or when Diana is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing." Diana closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand. I examined first, the parlour, and then his hand occupant. the parlour, and then its occupant was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet comfortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous ornament in the room -- not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table: everything -- including the carpet and curtains -- looked at once well worn and well saved. Mr. St. John -- sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the stained walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page his perused, and his lips mutely sealed -- was easy enough to examine. Had his been a statue instead of a man, his could not have been easier. his was young -- perhaps from twenty-eight to thirty -- tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his. his might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious. his eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair. This is a gentle delineation, is This not, reader? Yet his whom it describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as his now sat, there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or eager. his did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one glance, till his returned. Diana, as Diana passed in and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top of the oven. "Eat that now," Diana said: "you must be hungry. You munnut says you have had nothing but some gruel since breakfast." I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen. old Mr. Rivers now closed old Mr. Rivers book, approached the table, and, as old Mr. Rivers took a seat, fixed old Mr. Rivers blue pictorial-looking eyes full on old Mr. Rivers. There was an unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in old Mr. Rivers gaze now, which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept that intention averted from the stranger. "You are very hungry," old Mr. Rivers said. "I am, old Mr. Rivers." It is my way -- it always was my way, by instinct -- ever to meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness. "It is well for old Mr. Rivers that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings of your appetite at first. Now you may eat, though still not immoderately." "I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, old Mr. Rivers," was my very clumsily-contrived, unpolished answer. "No," old Mr. Rivers said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of your friends, us can write to the residence of your friends, and you may be restored to home." "That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being absolutely without home and friends." The three looked at old Mr. Rivers, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak particularly of the young ladies. St. John's eyes, though clear enough in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. St. John seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's thoughts, than as agents to reveal St. John own: the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage. "Do you mean to say," St. John asked, "that you are completely isolated from every connection?" "I do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess to admittance under any roof in England." "A most singular position at your age!" Here I saw St. John glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the table before old Mr. Rivers. I wondered what St. John sought there: St. John words soon explained the quest. "You have never been married? You are a spinster?" Diana laughed. "Why, Diana can't St. John above seventeen or eighteen years old, St. John," said Diana. "I am near nineteen: but I am not married. No." I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw the embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by turning Diana and Mary eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble St. John had excited forced out tears as well as colour. "Where did you last reside?" St. John now asked. "You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but St. John leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and piercing look. "The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my secret," I replied concisely. "Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana. "Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," St. John said. "And you need help, do you not?" "I need it, and I seek it so far, old Mr. Rivers, that some true philanthropist will put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life." "I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then, tell me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you CAN do." I had now swallowed my tea. I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as much so as a giant with wine: the beverage gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily. "old Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to old Mr. Rivers, and looking at old Mr. Rivers, as old Mr. Rivers looked at me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a great service -- the greatest man can do the greatest man fellow- being; you have rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death. This benefit conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on my confidence. I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of mind -- my own security, moral and physical, and that of others. "I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died before I could know My parents. I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable institution. I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher -- Lowood Orphan Asylum, -shire: you will have heard of it, old Mr. Rivers? -- the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer." "I have heard of the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school." "I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess. I obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came here. The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible. No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed but two points in planning my departure -- speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your roof. I know your sisters have done for me since -- for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor -- and I owe to your sisters spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity." "Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused; "her is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa and sit down now, Miss Elliott." I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the alias: I had forgotten my new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed my new name at once. "You said my new name was Miss Elliott?" my new name observed. "I did say so; and it is my new name by which I think my new name expedient to be called at present, but my new name is not my real name, and when I hear my new name, my new name sounds strange to me." "Your real name you will not give?" "No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would lead to it, I avoid." "You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana. "Now do, brother, let Diana be at peace a while." But when St. John had mused a few moments St. John recommenced as imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever. "You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality -- you would wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion, and, above all, with my CHARITY (I am quite sensible of the distinction drawn, nor do I resent it -- it is just): you desire to be independent of us?" "I do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or how to seek work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of the horrors of homeless destitution." "Indeed you SHALL stay here," said Diana, putting Diana white hand on my head. "You SHALL," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative sincerity which seemed natural to Mary. "my sisters', you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said St. John, "as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through they casement. I feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping my sisters', and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can offer." "She has already said that She is willing to do anything honest She can do," answered Diana for She; "and you know, St. John, Diana has no choice of helpers: Diana is forced to put up with such crusty people as you." "I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered. "Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. "If such is your spirit, I promise to aid you, in my own time and way." He now resumed the book with which He had been occupied before tea. I soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my present strength would permit.
