The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, The better I liked the inmates of Moor House.
In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day, and walk out sometimes.
I could join with Diana and Mary in all Diana and Mary occupations; converse with Diana and Mary as much as Diana and Mary wished, and aid Diana and Mary when and where Diana and Mary would allow me.
There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time -- the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me; what they approved, I reverenced.
they loved they sequestered home.
I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with the grey low roof, the grey latticed casements, the grey mouldering walls, the grey avenue of aged firs -- all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; the grey garden, dark with yew and holly -- and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom -- found a charm both potent and permanent.
yew and holly clung to the purple moors behind and around yew and holly dwelling -- to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path leading from yew and holly gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with a flock of grey moorland sheep little mossy-faced lambs:- a flock of grey moorland sheep clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment.
I could comprehend the feeling, and share both the feeling strength and truth.
I saw the fascination of the locality.
I felt the consecration of the fascination of the locality loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep -- on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow granite crag.
These details were just to me what they were to they -- so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.
The strong blast and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions, the same attraction as for these regions -- wound round my faculties the same spell that entranced these regions.
Indoors we agreed equally well.
these regions were both more accomplished and better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of knowledge these regions had trodden before me.
I devoured the books these regions lent me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with these regions in the evening what I had perused during the day.
Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.
If in we trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
Physically, Diana far excelled me: Diana was handsome; Diana was vigorous.
In Diana animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.
I could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest my head on Diana knee, and listen alternately to Diana and Mary, while her and Mary sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.
Diana offered to teach me German.
I liked to learn of Diana: I saw the part of instructress pleased and suited Diana; that of scholar pleased and suited me no less.
Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection -- of the strongest kind -- was the result.
Our natures discovered I could draw: Our natures pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my service.
My skill, greater in this one point than Our natures, surprised and charmed Our natures.
Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together: then Mary would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil Mary made.
Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to his.
One reason of the distance yet observed between us was, that his was comparatively seldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
No weather seemed to hinder his in these pastoral excursions: rain or fair, his would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat, and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission of love or duty -- I scarcely know in which light his regarded which light.
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would expostulate.
his would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than cheerful -- "And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I propose to his?"
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to friendship with his: his seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of a brooding nature.
Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his life and habits, his yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist.
Often, of an evening, when his sat at the window, his desk and papers before his, his would cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver his up to I know not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to his that treasury of delight it was to his sisters.
his expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection for the dark roof and hoary walls his called his home; but there was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was manifested; and never did his seem to roam the moors for the sake of their soothing silence -- never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights their could yield.
Incommunicative as his was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity of gauging his mind.
I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard his preach in his own church at Morton.
I wish I could describe that sermon: but that sermon is past my power.
I cannot even render faithfully the effect that sermon produced on me.
that sermon began calm -- and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
This grew to force -- compressed, condensed, controlled.
The heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were softened.
Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic doctrines -- election, predestination, reprobation -- were frequent; and each reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by he discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to me -- I know not whether equally so to others -- that the eloquence to which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of disappointment -- where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and disquieting aspirations.
I was sure St. John Rivers -- pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was -- had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found no, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium -- regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
Meantime a month was gone.
Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited Diana and Mary, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members whose wealthy and haughty members were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought out whose wealthy and haughty members innate excellences, and appreciated only whose wealthy and haughty members acquired accomplishments as whose wealthy and haughty members appreciated the skill of whose wealthy and haughty members cook or the taste of whose wealthy and haughty members waiting-woman.
Mr. St. John had said nothing to Mr. St. John yet about the employment Mr. St. John had promised to obtain for Mr. St. John; yet the employment he had promised to obtain for me became urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind.
One morning, being left alone with Mr. St. John a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the window-recess -- which Mr. St. John table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study -- and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what words to frame my inquiry -- for my inquiry is at all times difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as Mr. St. John -- when Mr. St. John saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
Looking up as I drew near -- "You have a question to ask of Mr. St.
John?"
Mr. St. John said.
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer Mr. St. John to undertake?"
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed both useful and happy here -- as my sisters had evidently become attached to Hannah, and your society gave them unusual pleasure -- I deemed it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till them approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
"And they will go in three days now?"
I said.
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah will accompany me; and Moor House will be shut up."
I waited a few moments, expecting Hannah would go on with the subject first broached: but Hannah seemed to have entered another train of reflection: Hannah look denoted abstraction from me and my business.
I was obliged to recall Hannah to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to me.
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?
I hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing this delay."
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to accept."
Hannah again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.
I grew impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance fastened on Hannah face, conveyed the feeling to Hannah as effectually as words could have done, and with less trouble.
"You need be in no hurry to hear," Hannah said: "let me frankly tell you, I have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.
Before I explain, recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it must be as the blind man would help the lame.
I am poor; for I find that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.
I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from himself native country -- not only for life, but in death.
Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on himself shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members himself is one, shall give the word, 'Rise, follow Me!'"
Mr. St. John said these words as Mr. St. John pronounced Mr. St. John sermons, with a quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance.
Mr. St. John resumed - "And since I am Mr. St. John poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of poverty and obscurity.
YOU may even think it degrading -- for I see now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but I consider that no service degrades which can better our race.
I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer's task of tillage is appointed him -- the scantier the meed him toil brings -- the higher the honour.
him, under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles -- the Apostles captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
"Well?"
I said, as him again paused -- "proceed."
him looked at Mr. St. John before him proceeded: indeed, him seemed leisurely to read my face, as if my face features and lines were characters on a page.
The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny him partially expressed in him succeeding observations.
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said him, "and hold the post I offer you for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing -- the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
"Do explain," I urged, when him halted once more.
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is, -- how trivial -- how cramping.
I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead, and that I am my own master.
I shall leave the place probably in the course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert Mr. St. John to the utmost for the utmost improvement.
Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of progress.
I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school for girls.
I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to a building for the purpose for the mistress's house.
the mistress salary will be thirty pounds a year: the mistress's house is already furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish -- Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley.
the mistress pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that the mistress shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with the mistress own house and the school as the mistress occupation of teaching will prevent the mistress having time to discharge in person.
Will you be this mistress?"
this mistress put the question rather hurriedly; this mistress seemed half to expect an indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, this mistress could not tell in what light the lot would appear to this mistress.
In truth it was humble -- but then it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding -- but then, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it was not ignoble -- not unworthy -- not mentally degrading, I made my decision.
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept my decision with all my heart."
"But you comprehend me?"
this mistress said.
"It is a village school: your scholars will be only poor girls -- cottagers' children -- at the best, farmers' daughters.
Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all you will have to teach.
What will you do with your accomplishments?
What, with the largest portion of your mind -- sentiments -- tastes?"
"Save What, with the largest portion of your mind -- sentiments -- tastes?"
till What, with the largest portion of your mind -- sentiments -- tastes?"
are wanted.
What, with the largest portion of your mind -- sentiments -- tastes?"
will keep."
"You know what you undertake, then?"
"I do."
this mistress now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and deeply gratified.
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open no school, if you like, next week."
"Very well: so be it."
this mistress rose and walked through the room.
Standing still, this mistress again looked at me.
this mistress shook this mistress head.
"What do you disapprove of, Mr.
Rivers?"
I asked.
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
"Why?
What is your reason for saying so?"
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the maintenance of an even tenor in life."
"I am not ambitious."
this mistress started at the word "ambitious."
this mistress repeated, "No.
What made you think of ambition?
Who is ambitious?
I know I am: but how did you find it out?"
"I was speaking of me."
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are -- " this mistress paused.
"What?"
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have misunderstood the word, and been displeased.
I mean, that human affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.
I am sure you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus: any more than I can be content," this mistress added, with emphasis, "to live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains -- my nature, that God gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed -- made useless.
You hear now how I contradict me.
I, who preached contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers of water in God's service -- I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my restlessness.
Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by some means."
His left the room.
In this brief hour I had learnt more of His than in the whole previous month: yet still His puzzled me.
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for leaving Diana and Mary Rivers brother and Diana and Mary Rivers home.
Diana and Mary Rivers tried to appear as usual; but the sorrow Diana and Mary Rivers had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed.
Diana intimated that this would be a different parting from any Diana and Mary Rivers had ever yet known.
this would probably, as far as Mr. St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a parting for life.
"He will sacrifice all to He long-framed resolves," Diana said: "natural affection and feelings more potent still.
Mr. St. John looks quiet, Jane; but Mr. St. John hides a fever in Mr. St. John vitals.
You would think Mr. St. John gentle, yet in some things Mr. St. John is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade Mr. St. John from Mr. St. John severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame Mr. St. John for his severe decision.
It is right, noble, Christian: yet his severe decision breaks my heart!"
And the tears gushed to Jane fine eyes.
Mary bent Mary head low over Mary work.
"We are now without father: We shall soon be without home and brother," Jane murmured, At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come singly," and to add to fate purposely distresses the vexing one of the slip between the cup and the lip.
Mr. St. John passed the window reading a letter.
Mr. St. John entered.
"Our uncle John is dead," said Our uncle John.
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings appeared in the sisters eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
"Dead?"
repeated Diana.
"Yes."
Mary riveted a searching gaze on Mary brother's face.
"And what then?"
Mary demanded, in a low voice.
"What then, Die?"
he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
"What then?
Why -- nothing.
Read."
he threw a letter into Mary lap.
Mary glanced over a letter, and handed a letter to Mary.
Mary perused a letter in silence, and returned a letter to her brother.
All three looked at each other, and all three smiled -- a dreary, pensive smile enough.
"Amen!
We can yet live," said Diana at last.
"At any rate, it makes We no worse off than We were before," remarked Mary.
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what MIGHT HAVE BEEN," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with what IS."
Mr. Rivers folded a letter, locked a letter in Mr. Rivers desk, and again went out.
For some minutes no one spoke.
Diana then turned to me.
"Jane, you will wonder at We and We mysteries," Jane said, "and think us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a relation as an uncle; but We have never seen an uncle or known an uncle.
an uncle was her brother.
My father and an uncle quarrelled long ago.
It was by an uncle advice that my father risked most of an uncle property in the speculation that ruined an uncle.
Mutual recrimination passed between Mutual recrimination: Mutual recrimination parted in anger, and were never reconciled.
Our uncle John engaged afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears Our uncle John realised a fortune of twenty thousand pounds.
Our uncle John was never married, and had no near kindred but We and one other person, not more closely related than We.
my father always cherished the idea that my father would atone for my father error by leaving my father possessions to We; a letter informs We that my father has bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between Mr. St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings.
my father had a right, of course, to do as my father pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news.
Mary would have esteemed We rich with a thousand pounds each; and to Mr. St. John such a sum would have been valuable, for the good the good would have enabled my father to do."
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference made to the subject by either Mr. Rivers or the subject sisters.
The next day I left Marsh End for Morton.
The day after, Diana and Mary Rivers Mary quitted it for distant B-.
In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.
