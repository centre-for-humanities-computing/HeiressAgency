Two days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me down at a place called Whitcross; the coachman could take me no farther for the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach, where I had placed my parcel for safety; there my parcel remains, there my parcel must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute. Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; my parcel is but a stone pillar set up where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a distance and in darkness. Four arms spring from my parcel summit: the nearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads: The population here stretch out east, west, north, and south -- white, broad, lonely; The population here are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to The population here very verge. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment -- not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are -- none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me. I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek a good wish for me breast and ask repose. I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in the brown moorside dark growth; I turned with the brown moorside turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat down under a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle. High banks of moor were about me; a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle protected my head: the sky was over that. Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might discover me. If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing a gust of wind swept the waste was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined a plover a man. Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection. What was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I could do nothing and go nowhere! -- when a long way must yet be measured by my weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation -- when cold charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved! I touched the heath, the heath was dry, and yet warm with the beat of the summer day. I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze whispered. Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to she with filial fondness. To-night, at least, I would be she guest, as I was she child: my mother would lodge me without money and without price. I had one morsel of bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny -- my last coin. I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate a handful with one morsel of bread. My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by this hermit's meal. I said my evening prayers at this hermit's meal conclusion, and then chose my couch. Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were buried in the crag; rising high on each side, the crag left only a narrow space for the night-air to invade. I folded my shawl double, and spread my shawl over me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was not, at least -- at the commencement of the night, cold. My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke My rest. My rest plained of My rest gaping wounds, My rest inward bleeding, My rest riven chords. My rest trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; My rest bemoaned his with bitter pity; My rest demanded his with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird with both wings broken, My rest still quivered My rest shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek his. Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but certainly We feel God presence most when God works are on the grandest scale spread before We; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where God worlds wheel their silent course, that We read clearest God infinitude, God omnipotence, God omnipresence. I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-way. Remembering what it was -- what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light -- I felt the might and strength of God. Sure was I of God efficiency to save what God had made: convinced I grew that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls neither earth treasured. I turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe; Mr. Rochester was God's, and by God would Mr. Rochester be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow. But next day, Want came to me pale and bare. Long after the little birds had left the little birds nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried -- when the long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky -- I got up, and I looked round me. What a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading moor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries. I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But I was a human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there was nothing to supply I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this -- that my Maker had that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness. Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all Life requirements, and pains, and responsibilities. The burden must be carried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled. I set out. Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent and high. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice. I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered me -- might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb -- I heard a bell chime -- a church bell. I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a spire. All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea. Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and a heavily-laden waggon drover. Human life and human labour were near. I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil like the rest. About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village. At the bottom of the village one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window. I coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a degree of energy: without a degree of energy, it would be difficult to proceed. The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings. I felt it would be degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls? I considered. I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves. I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded. I did not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they would not; but I must try. I entered a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed person, a lady as a woman supposed, a woman came forward with civility. How could a woman serve me? I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter the request I had prepared. I dared not offer a woman the half-worn gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd. I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired. Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, a woman coolly acceded to the request I had prepared. a woman pointed to a seat; I sank into a seat. I felt sorely urged to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained a seat. Soon I asked a woman "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in the village?" "Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for." I reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought face to face with Necessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource, without a friend, without a coin. I must do something. What? I must apply somewhere. Where? "Did a woman know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?" "Nay; a woman couldn't say." "What was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people do?" "Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's needle-factory, and at the foundry." "Did Mr. Oliver employ women?" "Nay; it was men's work." "And what do the women do?" "I knawn't," was the answer. "Some does one thing, and some another. Poor folk mun get on as Some can." a woman seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to importune a woman? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently wanted. I took leave. I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an inducement to enter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more. Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many minutes had elapsed, I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something -- a resource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at the top of a lane, with a garden before A pretty little house, exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming. I stopped at A pretty little house. What business had I to approach the white door or touch the glittering knocker? In what way could it possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me? Yet I drew near and knocked. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the white door. In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame -- a voice wretchedly low and faltering -- I asked if a servant was wanted here? "No," said she; "we do not keep a servant." "Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued. "I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want some work: no matter what." But it was not she business to think for me, or to seek a place for me: besides, in she eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character, position, tale. she shook she head, she "was sorry she could give me no information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but no information shut me out. If she had held no information open a little longer, I believe I should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low. I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no prospect of aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate to a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance of food. Solitude would be no solitude -- rest no rest -- while the vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side. I drew near houses; I left houses, and came back again, and again I wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask -- no right to expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime, the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened towards the church spire. Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman's function to help -- at least with advice -- those who wished to help least with advice. I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I reached the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman opened: I asked was this the parsonage? "Yes." "Was the clergyman in?" "No." "Would the clergyman be in soon?" "No, the clergyman was gone from home." "To a distance?" "Not so far -- happen three mile. the clergyman had been called away by the sudden death of the clergyman father: the clergyman was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay there a fortnight longer." "Was there any lady of the house?" "Nay, there was naught but An old woman, and An old woman was housekeeper;" and of An old woman, reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away. Once more I took off my handkerchief -- once more I thought of the cakes of bread in the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned my face again to the village; I found the little shop again, and I went in; and though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request -- "Would the woman I ventured the request give me a roll for my handkerchief?" the woman I ventured the request looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, the woman I ventured the request never sold stuff i' that way." Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; the woman I ventured the request again refused. "How could the woman I ventured the request tell where I had got my handkerchief?" the woman I ventured the request said. "Would the woman I ventured the request take my gloves?" "No! what could the woman I ventured the request do with my gloves?" Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who repulsed me. I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be sure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was whose business to provide me with employment? Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for the woman I ventured the request bread, why, the woman I ventured the request was right, if the offer appeared to the woman I ventured the request sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me condense now. I am sick of the subject. A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the farmer was sitting, eating the farmer supper of bread and cheese. I stopped and said - "Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry." the farmer cast on me a glance of surprise; but without answering, the farmer cut a thick slice from the farmer loaf, and gave a thick slice to me. I imagine the farmer did not think I was a beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to the farmer brown loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of the farmer , I sat down and ate a farm-house. I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought a farm-house in the wood I have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me. Towards morning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet. Do not ask me, reader, to give a minute account of the following day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough. "Will you give me that?" I asked. a little girl stared at me. "Mother!" a little girl exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to give a woman these porridge." "Well lass," replied a voice within, "give a voice a little girl if a little girl's a beggar. T' pig doesn't want a voice." a little girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured the stiffened mould ravenously. As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which I had been pursuing an hour or more. "My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy. "I feel I cannot go much farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night? While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation -- this total prostration of hope. In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile me to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! sustain me a little longer! Aid! -- direct me!" My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight. The very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. I had, by cross-ways and by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill. "Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road," I reflected. "And far better that crows and ravens -- if any ravens there be in these regions -- should pick my flesh from my bones, than that these regions should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's grave." To the dusky hill, then, I turned. I reached it. it remained now only to find a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure. But all the surface of the waste looked level. all the surface of the waste showed no variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was getting, I could still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the daylight. My glazed eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge, vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. "That is an ignis fatuus," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish. it burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. "Is it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned. I watched to see whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not enlarge. "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if so, I can never reach a candle in a house. It is much too far away: and were a candle in a house within a yard of me, what would a candle in a house avail? I should but knock at the door to have a candle in a house shut in my face." And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground. I lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the dusky hill and over me, and died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the skin. Could I but have stiffened to the still frost -- the friendly numbness of death -- the still frost -- the friendly numbness of death might have pelted on; I should not have felt the still frost -- the friendly numbness of death; but my yet living flesh shuddered at the still frost -- the friendly numbness of death chilling influence. I rose ere long. a light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards a light. a light led me aslant over the dusky hill, through a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties. a light was my forlorn hope: I must gain a light. Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor. I approached a trace of white over the moor; a trace of white over the moor was a road or a track: a trace of white over the moor led straight up to the light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees -- firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of a clump of trees -- firs, apparently forms and foliage through the gloom. My star vanished as I drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it. I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before My star: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall -- above it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before My star: a whitish object was a gate -- a wicket; a whitish object moved on a whitish object hinges as I touched a whitish object. On each side stood a sable bush-holly or yew. Entering a gate -- a wicket and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but a light shone nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set. The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over The aperture, I could see all within. I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by my beacon light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about an elderly woman, was knitting a stocking. I noticed these objects cursorily only -- in these objects there was nothing extraordinary. A group of more interest appeared near the hearth, sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing A group of more interest. Two young, graceful women -- ladies in every point -- sat, one in a low rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; Two young, graceful women -- ladies in every point -- wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces: a large old pointer dog rested a large old pointer dog massive head on the knee of one girl -- in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat. A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants! Who were such occupants? such occupants could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table; for she looked like a rustic, and such occupants were all delicacy and cultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as such occupants: and yet, as I gazed on such occupants, I seemed intimate with every lineament. I cannot call such occupants handsome -- such occupants were too pale and grave for the word: as such occupants each bent over a book, such occupants looked thoughtful almost to severity. A stand between such occupants supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which such occupants frequently referred, comparing such occupants, seemingly, with the smaller books such occupants held in such occupants hands, like people consulting a dictionary to aid people in the task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman's knitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice broke the strange stillness at last, a voice was audible enough to me. "Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which Franz has awakened in terror -- listen!" And in a low voice Diana read something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an unknown tongue -- neither French nor Latin. Whether it were Greek or German I could not tell. "That is strong," Diana said, when Diana had finished: "I relish it." The other girl, who had lifted Diana head to listen to Diana sister, repeated, while Diana gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read. At a later day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote a line of what had been read: though, when I first heard a line of what had been read, a line of what had been read was only like a stroke on sounding brass to me -- conveying no meaning:- "'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.' Good! good!" she exclaimed, while she dark and deep eye sparkled. "There you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! a line of what had been read is worth a hundred pages of fustian. 'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.' I like it!" Both were again silent. "Is there ony country where Both talk i' that way?" asked she, looking up from she knitting. "Yes, Hannah -- a far larger country than England, where they talk in no other way." "Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other: and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what either o' ye went there said, I guess?" "either o' ye went there could probably tell something of what either o' ye went there said, but not all -- for either o' ye went there are not as clever as you think either o' ye went there, Hannah. either o' ye went there don't speak German, and either o' ye went there cannot read it without a dictionary to help either o' ye went there." "And what good does it do you?" "either o' ye went there mean to teach it some time -- or at least the elements, as they say; and then we shall get more money than either o' ye went there do now." "Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night." "I think either o' ye went there have: at least I'm tired. Mary, are you?" "Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon." "It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home." "Surely St. John will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold watch St. John drew from St. John girdle). It rains fast, Hannah: will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?" St. John rose: St. John opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage: soon I heard St. John stir a fire in an inner room; St. John presently came back. "Ah, childer!" said St. John, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now: it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner." St. John wiped St. John eyes with St. John apron: the two girls, grave before, looked sad now. "But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish he here again. And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had." "You say he never mentioned we?" inquired one of the ladies. "he hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father. he had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when St. John asked if St. John would like either o' ye to be sent for, St. John fair laughed at St. John. St. John began again with a bit of a heaviness in St. John head the next day -- that is, a fortnight sin' -- and St. John went to sleep and niver wakened: St. John wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and fand St. John. Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock -- for ye and St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned. She wor the pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father." I thought more like your father so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for such I now concluded Diana to be) saw the difference. more like your father were fair complexioned and slenderly made; more like your father possessed faces full of distinction and intelligence. One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the other, and there was a difference in hair style of wearing it; Mary's pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses covered Diana neck with thick curls. The clock struck ten. "Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will St. John when St. John comes in." And Diana proceeded to prepare the meal. the ladies rose; the ladies seemed about to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching the ladies, the ladies appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make the inmates of this house believe in the truth of my wants and woes -- to induce the inmates of this house to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and knocked at the door hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera. Hannah opened. "What do you want?" Hannah inquired, in a voice of surprise, as Hannah surveyed me by the light of the candle Hannah held. "May I speak to your mistresses?" I said. "You had better tell me what you have to say to them. Where do you come from?" "I am a stranger." "What is your business here at this hour?" "I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of bread to eat." Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face. "I'll give you a piece of bread," Hannah said, after a pause; "but we can't take in a vagrant to lodge. It isn't likely." "Do let me speak to your mistresses." "No, not I. What can they do for your mistresses? You should not be roving about now; it looks very ill." "But where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall I do?" "Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you don't do wrong, that's all. Here is a penny; now go -- " "A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther. Don't shut the door:- oh, don't, for God's sake!" "I must; the rain is driving in -- " "Tell the young ladies. Let me see them- " "Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't make such a noise. Move off." "But I must die if I am turned away." "Not you. I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about folk's houses at this time o' night. If you've any followers -- housebreakers or such like -- anywhere near, you may tell you've any followers -- housebreakers or such like -- anywhere near we are not by we in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and guns." Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and bolted the door within. This was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering -- a throe of true despair -- rent and heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not another step could I stir. I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned -- I wrung my hands -- I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death! Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this isolation -- this banishment from my kind! Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of fortitude was gone -- at least for a moment; but the last I soon endeavoured to regain. "I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God. Let me try to wait God will in silence." These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there -- dumb and still. "All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be if you perished here of want." "Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A form was near -- what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented me from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed to the door. "Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah. "Yes -- yes; open quickly." "Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is! Come in -- your sisters are quite uneasy about yours, and I believe there are bad folks about. There has been a beggar-woman -- I declare a beggar-woman is not gone yet! -- laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off, I say!" "Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to St. John. You have done your duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting a beggar-woman. I was near, and listened to both you and a beggar-woman. I think this is a peculiar case -- I must at least examine into a peculiar case. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the house." With difficulty I obeyed this. Presently I stood within that clean, bright kitchen -- on the very hearth -- trembling, sickening; conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. The two ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at me. "St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask. "I cannot tell: I found a beggar-woman at the door," was the reply. "a beggar-woman does look white," said Hannah. "As white as clay or death," was responded. "a beggar-woman will fall: let a beggar-woman sit." And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me. I still possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak. "Perhaps a little water would restore a beggar-woman. Hannah, fetch some. But Hannah is worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!" "A mere spectre!" "Is Hannah ill, or only famished?" "Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give milk me, and a piece of bread." Diana (I knew Diana by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as Diana bent over me) broke some bread, dipped some bread in milk, and put some bread to my lips. Diana face was near mine: I saw there was pity in Her face, and I felt sympathy in Diana hurried breathing. In Diana simple words, too, the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat." "Yes -- try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden bonnet and lifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at first, eagerly soon. "Not too much at first -- restrain Diana," said your brother; "Diana has had enough." And your brother withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread. "A little more, St. John -- look at the avidity in Diana eyes." "No more at present, sister. Try if Diana can speak now -- ask Diana Diana name." I felt I could speak, and I answered -- "My name is Jane Elliott." Anxious as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an ALIAS. "And where do you live? Where are your friends?" I was silent. "Can we send for any one you know?" I shook my head. "What account can you give of yourself?" Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and once was brought face to face with this house owners, I felt no longer outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. I dared to put off the mendicant -- to resume my natural manner and character. I began once more to know myself; and when St. John demanded an account -- which at present I was far too weak to render -- I said after a brief pause - "Sir, I can give you no details to-night." "But what, then," said St. John, "do you expect me to do for you?" "Nothing," I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers. Diana took the word - "Do you mean," Diana asked, "that we have now given you what aid you require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?" I looked at Diana. Diana had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct both with power and goodness. I took sudden courage. Answering Diana compassionate gaze with a smile, I said -- "I will trust you. If I were a masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear. Do with me and for myself as you like; but excuse me from much discourse -- my breath is short -- I feel a spasm when I speak." All three surveyed me, and all three were silent. "Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let Hannah sit there at present, and ask Hannah no questions; in ten minutes more, give Hannah the remainder of that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let Mary and Diana go into the parlour and talk the matter over." Mary and Diana withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned -- I could not tell which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over myself as I sat by the genial fire. In an undertone Diana gave some directions to Hannah. Ere long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I thanked God -- experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful joy -- and slept.
