My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either; My first quarter at Lowood comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks.
The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits our had to pass an hour every day in the open air.
our clothing was insufficient to protect our from the severe cold: our had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning.
Then the scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, our had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.
From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, the famished great girls would coax or menace the little ones out of the famished great girls portion.
Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.
our had to walk two miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.
our set out cold, our arrived at church colder: during the morning service our became almost paralysed.
It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.
At the close of the afternoon service our returned by an exposed and hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line, Miss Temple plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close about Miss Temple, and encouraging our, by precept and example, to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as Miss Temple said, "like stalwart soldiers."
The other teachers, poor things, were generally The other teachers, poor things too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.
How our longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when our got back!
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind great girls the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping the younger children starved arms in the younger children pinafores.
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of bread -- a whole, instead of a half, slice -- with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.
I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness.
A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.
The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.
Sometimes them feet failed them, and them sank together in a heap; them were then propped up with the monitors' high stools.
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my arrival; perhaps prolonging Mr. Brocklehurst stay with Mr. Brocklehurst friend the archdeacon: Mr. Brocklehurst absence was a relief to me.
I need not say that I had my own reasons for dreading Mr. Brocklehurst coming: but come Mr. Brocklehurst did at last.
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose en masse, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted.
A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.
I now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.
Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition, &c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature.
All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise, -- I had been looking out daily for the "Coming Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
he stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see her eye dark orb turn on he a glance of repugnance and contempt.
I listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what he said: her eye import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; her eye struck me that her eye would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match.
You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but Miss Smith shall have some papers sent in next week; and Miss Smith is not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be careless and lose they have more.
And, O ma'am!
I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to!
-- when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in the woollen stockings I was sure the woollen stockings had not been well mended from time to time."
He paused.
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
"And, ma'am," He continued, Mr. Brocklehurst tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit some of the girls to one."
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.
Agnes and Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave Agnes and Catherine Johnstone leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion."
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur too often.
And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight.
How is this?
I looked over the regulations, and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned.
Who introduced this innovation?
and by what authority?"
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple: "the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat the pupils; and I dared not allow the pupils to remain fasting till dinner-time."
"Madam, allow me an instant.
You are aware that my plan in bringing up the girls is, not to accustom the girls to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render the girls hardy, patient, self-denying.
Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging the pupils to evince fortitude under temporary privation.
A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon our blessed Lord Himself disciples to take up their cross and follow our blessed Lord Himself; to our blessed Lord Himself warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to that man divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye."
Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed these children's mouths vile bodies, but you little think how you starve these children's mouths immortal souls!"
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused -- perhaps overcome by " Mr. Brocklehurst feelings.
Miss Temple had looked down when " Mr. Brocklehurst first began to speak to Miss Temple; but Miss Temple now gazed straight before Miss Temple, and Miss Temple face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material; especially Miss Temple mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's chisel to open a sculptor, and Miss Temple brow settled gradually into petrified severity.
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with " Mr. Brocklehurst hands behind " Mr. Brocklehurst back, majestically surveyed the whole school.
Suddenly " Mr. Brocklehurst gave a blink, as if her eye had met something that either dazzled or shocked her eye pupil; turning, " Mr. Brocklehurst said in more rapid accents than " Mr. Brocklehurst had hitherto used - "Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what -- WHAT is that girl with curled hair?
Red hair, ma'am, curled -- curled all over?"
And extending " Mr. Brocklehurst cane " Mr. Brocklehurst pointed to the awful object, " Mr. Brocklehurst hand shaking as " Mr. Brocklehurst did so.
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss TempleMiss Temple, very quietly.
"Julia Severn, ma'am!
And why has Julia Severn, or any other, curled hair?
Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does Julia Severn conform to the world so openly -- here in an evangelical, charitable establishment -- as to wear Julia Severn hair one mass of curls?"
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
"Naturally!
Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?
I have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly.
Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the excrescence -- that tall girl, tell girl to turn round.
Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
Miss Temple Miss Temple passed Miss Temple handkerchief over Miss Temple lips, as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; Miss Temple gave the order, however, and when the first class could take in what was required of them, them obeyed.
Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which them commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity " Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; " Mr. Brocklehurst would perhaps have felt that, whatever " Mr. Brocklehurst might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond " Mr. Brocklehurst interference than " Mr. Brocklehurst imagined. "
Mr. Brocklehurst scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then pronounced sentence.
These words fell like the knell of doom - "All those top-knots must be cut off."
Miss Temple Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
"Madam," " Mr. Brocklehurst pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of the world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh; to teach these girls to clothe these girls with shame-facedness and sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the time wasted, of -- " Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now entered the room.
these girls ought to have come a little sooner to have heard " Mr. Brocklehurst lecture on dress, for these girls were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs.
The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and the elder lady wore a false front of French curls.
three other visitors, ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and " Mr. Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room.
It seems three other visitors, ladies had come in the carriage with three other visitors, ladies reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.
three other visitors, ladies now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what three other visitors, ladies said; other matters called off and enchanted my attention.
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation.
To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst.
It came.
"A careless girl!"
said " Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after -- "It is the new pupil, I perceive."
And before I could draw breath, "I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her."
Then aloud: how loud it seemed to me!
"Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple Miss Temple gently assisted me to the dread judge very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel - "Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be punished."
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
"Another minute, and Jane will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction.
I was no Helen Burns.
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen: a monitor was brought.
"Place the child upon a monitor."
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that Mr. Brocklehurst was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
"Ladies," said Mr. Brocklehurst, turning to Mr. Brocklehurst family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see this girl?"
Of course they did; for I felt they eyes directed like burning-glasses against my scorched skin.
"You see this girl is yet young; you observe this girl possesses the ordinary form of childhood; God has graciously given this girl the shape that God has given to all of us; no signal deformity points this girl out as a marked character.
Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in this girl?
Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
A pause -- in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, "this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien.
You must be on your guard against this girl; you must shun this girl example; if necessary, avoid this girl company, exclude this girl from your sports, and shut this girl out from your converse.
Teachers, you must watch this girl: keep your eyes on this girl movements, weigh well this girl words, scrutinise this girl actions, punish this girl body to save this girl soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says it prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut -- this girl is -- a liar!"
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply their to their optics, while the elder lady swayed the elder lady to and fro, and the two younger ones whispered, "How shocking!"
Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
"This I learned from the elder lady benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted the elder lady in the elder lady orphan state, reared the elder lady as the elder lady own daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity this girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last the elder lady excellent patroness was obliged to separate the elder lady from the elder lady own young ones, fearful lest the elder lady vicious example should contaminate whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious example purity: the elder lady has sent the elder lady here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious example diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of teachers, superintendent not to allow the waters to stagnate round the elder lady."
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of Mr. Brocklehurst surtout, muttered something to Mr. Brocklehurst family, who rose, bowed to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
Turning at the door, my judge said - "Let my judge stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to my judge during the remainder of the day."
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.
What my sensations were no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, a girl lifted a girl eyes.
What a strange light inspired them!
What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through teachers, superintendent!
How the new feeling bore me up!
It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit.
I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.
no Helen Burns asked some slight question about no Helen Burns work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to no Helen Burns place, and smiled at no Helen Burns as no Helen Burns again went by.
What a smile!
I remember it now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up no Helen Burns marked lineaments, no Helen Burns thin face, no Helen Burns sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an angel.
Yet at that moment no Helen Burns wore on no Helen Burns arm "the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard no Helen Burns condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because no Helen Burns had blotted an exercise in copying it out.
Such is the imperfect nature of man!
such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.
