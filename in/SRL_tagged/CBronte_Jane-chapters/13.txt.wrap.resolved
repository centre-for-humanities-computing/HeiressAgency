Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that night; nor did the surgeon rise soon next morning. When the surgeon did come down, it was to attend to business: the surgeon agent and some of the surgeon tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with the surgeon. Adele and I had now to vacate the library: the library would be in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried Adele and I books, and arranged A fire for the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, Thornfield Hall echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through a rill from the outer world; a rill from the outer world had a master: for my part, I liked a rill from the outer world better. Adele was not easy to teach that day; Adele could not apply: Adele kept running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if Adele could get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then Adele coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew Adele was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and made Adele sit still, Adele continued to talk incessantly of Adele "ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax DE Rochester," as Adele dubbed him (I had not before heard him prenomens), and to conjecture what presents him had brought Adele: for it appears him had intimated the night before, that when him luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst his luggage a little box in whose contents Adele had an interest. "Et cela doit signifier," said Adele, "qu'il y aura le dedans un cadeau pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle. Monsieur a parle de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale. J'ai dit qu'oui: car c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?" I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark I allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty. Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the fireside. In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by Mrs. Fairfax entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude. "Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with Mr. Rochester in the drawing-room this evening," said Mrs. Fairfax: "Mr. Rochester has been so much engaged all day that Mr. Rochester could not ask to see you before." "When is Mr. Rochester tea-time?" I inquired. "Oh, at six o'clock: Mr. Rochester keeps early hours in the country. You had better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten your frock. Here is a candle." "Is it necessary to change your frock?" "Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here." This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions. "You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake on, and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in Mrs. Fairfax shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond. Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot -- Adele knelt near him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, Mr. Rochester foot supported by the cushion; Mr. Rochester was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire shone full on Mr. Rochester face. I knew my traveller with Mr. Rochester broad and jetty eyebrows; Mr. Rochester square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of Mr. Rochester black hair. I recognised Mr. Rochester decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; Mr. Rochester full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; Mr. Rochester grim mouth, chin, and jaw -- yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake. Mr. Rochester shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness with Mr. Rochester physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term -- broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor graceful. Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and myself; but it appeared Mr. Rochester was not in the mood to notice us, for Mr. Rochester never lifted Mr. Rochester head as us approached. "Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in Mrs. Fairfax quiet way. Mr. Rochester bowed, still not taking Mr. Rochester eyes from the group of the dog and child. "Let Miss Eyre be seated," said Mr. Rochester: and there was something in the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express, "What the deuce is it to myself whether Miss Eyre Miss Eyre be there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost Miss Eyre." I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on. he went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and Mrs. Fairfax began to talk. Kindly, as usual -- and, as usual, rather trite -- Mrs. Fairfax condoled with he on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to he with that painful sprain: then Mrs. Fairfax commended he patience and perseverance in going through with it. "Mrs. Fairfax, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder Mrs. Fairfax got. Mrs. Fairfax hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, Mrs. Fairfax proceeded to arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and Adele went to the table; but the master did not leave the master couch. "Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele might perhaps spill Mr. Rochester's cup." I did as requested. As he took Mr. Rochester's cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out - "N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre?" "Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly. "Did you expect a present, Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?" and the master searched my face with eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing. "I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: them are generally thought pleasant things." "Generally thought? But what do YOU think?" "I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to a present, has a present not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to an opinion nature." "Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: Adele demands a 'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment Adele sees me: you beat about the bush." "Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: Adele can prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for Adele says you have always been in the habit of giving Adele playthings; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment." "Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adele, and find you have taken great pains with Adele: Adele is not bright, Adele has no talents; yet in a short time Adele has made much improvement." "Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to Sir: it is the meed teachers most covet -- praise of their pupils' progress." "Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and Mr. Rochester took Mr. Rochester tea in silence. "Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with Mrs. Fairfax knitting; while Adele was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres. We obeyed, as in duty bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but Adele was ordered to amuse Adele with Pilot. "You have been resident in my house three months?" "Yes, Sir." "And you came from -- ?" "From Lowood school, in -shire." "Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?" "Eight years." "Eight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the time in such a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder you have rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had got that sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet. Who are your parents?" "I have none." "Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember none?" "No." "I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that stile?" "For whom, sir?" "For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for the men in green. Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?" I shook his head. "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. "And not even in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them. I don't think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on them revels more." Mrs. Fairfax had dropped Mrs. Fairfax knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed wondering what sort of talk this was. "Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?" "No; none that I ever saw." "And your home?" "I have none." "Where do your brothers and sisters live?" "I have your brothers and sisters." "Who recommended you to come here?" "I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement." "Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make. Miss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to "Adele." "Don't trouble yourself to give Miss Eyre a character," returned Mr. Rochester: "eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for me. Miss Eyre began by felling my horse." "Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax. "I have to thank Miss Eyre for that painful sprain." The widow looked bewildered. "Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?" "No, "Sir." "Have you seen much society?" "None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of Thornfield." "Have you read much?" "Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or very learned." "You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in religious forms; -- Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a parson, is a parson not?" "Yes, Sir." "And you girls probably worshipped a parson, as a convent full of religieuses would worship girls director." "Oh, no." "You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship a novice priest! That sounds blasphemous." "I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. Mr. Brocklehurst is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; Mr. Brocklehurst cut off our hair; and for economy's sake bought our bad needles and thread, with which our could hardly sew." "That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again caught the drift of the dialogue. "And was that the head and front of Mr. Brocklehurst offending?" demanded Mr. Rochester. "Mr. Brocklehurst starved our when Mr. Brocklehurst had the sole superintendence of the provision department, before the committee was appointed; and Mr. Brocklehurst bored our with long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of Mr. Brocklehurst own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go to bed." "What age were you when you went to Lowood?" "About ten." "And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?" I assented. "Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without Lowood aid, I should hardly have been able to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case. And now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?" "A little." "Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the library -- I mean, if you please. -- (Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,' and this is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate.) -- Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune." I departed, obeying his directions. "Enough!" his called out in a few minutes. "You play A LITTLE, I see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not well." I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued -- "Adele showed me some sketches this morning, which Adele said were "Adele. I don't know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?" "No, indeed!" I interjected. "Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch for your portfolio contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are certain: I can recognise patchwork." "Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, Sir." I brought your portfolio from the library. "Approach the table," said Sir; and I wheeled your portfolio to Sir . "Adele and Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures. "No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I finish with the drawings; but don't push your faces up to mine." Mr. Rochester deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three Mr. Rochester laid aside; the others, when Mr. Rochester had examined each sketch and painting, Mr. Rochester swept from Mr. Rochester. "Take each sketch and painting off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said Mr. Rochester, "and look at each sketch and painting with Adele; -- you" (glancing at Mr. Rochester) "resume your seat, and answer my questions. I perceive the pictures were done by one hand: was one hand Adele?" "Yes." "And when did you find time to do the pictures? the pictures have taken much time, and some thought." "I did the pictures in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no other occupation." "Where did you get your copies?" "Out of his head." "his head I see now on your shoulders?" "Yes, Sir." "Has it other furniture of the same kind within?" "I should think it may have: I should hope -- better." Mr. Rochester spread the pictures before Mr. Rochester, and again surveyed the pictures alternately. While Mr. Rochester is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what the pictures are: and first, I must premise that the pictures are nothing wonderful. The subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw The subjects with the spiritual eye, before I attempted to embody The subjects, The subjects were striking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived. the pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land. One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; One gleam of light beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart. Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn. The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into sky was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with the Evening Star; the lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star. The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head, -- a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against the iceberg. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting the forehead, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in wreathed turban folds of black drapery character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly crown;" what This pale crescent diademed was "the shape which shape had none." "Were you happy when you painted the pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester presently. "I was absorbed, Sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint the pictures, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known." "That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at these strange tints long each day?" "I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at these strange tints from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply." "And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?" "Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise." "Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably. You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to the thoughts, the drawings are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make These eyes in the Evening Star look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells These eyes in the Evening Star rays. And what meaning is that in These eyes in the Evening Star solemn depth? And who taught you to paint wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There! put the drawings away!" I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his watch, his said abruptly - "It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up so long? Take Adele to bed." Adele went to kiss his before quitting the room: his endured the caress, but scarcely seemed to relish the caress more than Pilot would have done, nor so much. "I wish you all good-night, now," said his, making a movement of the hand towards the door, in token that his was tired of our company, and wished to dismiss our. Mrs. Fairfax folded up Mrs. Fairfax knitting: I took my portfolio: our curtseyed to my portfolio, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew. "You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I observed, when I rejoined Mrs. Fairfax in the room, after putting Adele to bed. "Well, is Mr. Rochester?" "I think so: Mr. Rochester is very changeful and abrupt." "True: no doubt Mr. Rochester may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to Mr. Rochester manner, I never think of his manner; and then, if Mr. Rochester has peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made." "Why?" "Partly because it is Mr. Rochester nature -- and we can none of we help we nature; and partly because Mr. Rochester has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass Mr. Rochester, and make Mr. Rochester spirits unequal." "What about?" "Family troubles, for one thing." "But Mr. Rochester has no family." "Not now, but Mr. Rochester has had -- or, at least, relatives. Mr. Rochester lost Mr. Rochester elder brother a few years since." "Mr. Rochester ELDER brother?" "Yes. Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the property; only about nine years." "Nine years is a tolerable time. Was Mr. Rochester so very fond of his elder brother as to be still inconsolable for his elder brother loss?" "Why, no -- perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings between no family. Mr. Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps Mr. Rochester prejudiced Mr. Rochester father against Mr. Rochester. The old gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. The old gentleman did not like to diminish the property by division, and yet The old gentleman was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after The old gentleman was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what Mr. Edward considered a painful position, for the sake of making Mr. Edward fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but Mr. Edward spirit could not brook what Mr. Edward had to suffer in his spirit. Mr. Edward is not very forgiving: Mr. Edward broke with Mr. Edward family, and now for many years Mr. Edward has led an unsettled kind of life. I don't think Mr. Edward has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of Mr. Edward without a will left Mr. Edward master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder Mr. Edward shuns the old place." "Why should Mr. Edward shun it?" "Perhaps Mr. Edward thinks it gloomy." The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials. Mrs. Fairfax averred they were a mystery to Mrs. Fairfax, and that what Mrs. Fairfax knew was chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that Mrs. Fairfax wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly.
