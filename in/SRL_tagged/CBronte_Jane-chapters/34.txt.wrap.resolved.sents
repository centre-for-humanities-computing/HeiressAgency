It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general holiday approached.
I now closed Morton school, taking care that the parting should not be barren on my side.
Good fortune opens the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations.
I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed: many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed manifested many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed affection plainly and strongly.
Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed unsophisticated hearts: I promised many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed that never a week should pass in future that I did not visit many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed, and give many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed an hour's teaching in many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed .
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty girls, file out before Mr. Rivers, and locked the door, I stood with the key in my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.
And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of the British peasantry seemed to Mr. Rivers ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls.
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
asked Mr. Rivers, when your reward were gone.
"Does not the consciousness of having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
"Doubtless."
"And you have only toiled a few months!
Would not a life devoted to the task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.
I must enjoy those of other people now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of body and disposed for full holiday."
that looked grave.
"What now?
What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
What are you going to do?"
"To be active: as active as I can.
And first I must beg you to set Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
"Do you want Hannah?"
"Yes, to go with Mr. Rivers to Moor House.
Diana and Mary will be at home in a week, and I want to have everything in order against Diana and Mary arrival."
"I understand.
I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.
It is better so: Hannah shall go with Hannah."
"Tell Hannah to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
He took it.
"You give it up very gleefully," said He; "I don't quite understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing.
What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?"
"My first aim will be to CLEAN DOWN (do you comprehend the full force of the expression?)
-- to CLEAN DOWN Moor House from chamber to cellar; my next to rub -- to CLEAN DOWN Moor House from chamber to cellar up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my ambition is to give Diana and Mary a beau-ideal of a welcome when Diana and Mary come."
St. John smiled slightly: still St. John was dissatisfied.
"It is all very well for the present," said St. John; "but seriously, I trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
"The best things the world has!"
I interrupted.
"No, Jane, no: the world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing Jane with this late-found charm of relationship; but THEN, I hope you will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.
I hope your energies will then once more trouble you with your energies strength."
I looked at St. John with surprise.
"St. John," I said, "I think you are almost wicked to talk so.
I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and you try to stir me up to restlessness!
To what end?"
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to your keeping; and of which God will surely one day demand a strict account.
Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously -- I warn you of that.
And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you throw Jane into commonplace home pleasures.
Don't cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste an adequate on trite transient objects.
Do you hear, Jane?"
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.
I feel I have adequate cause to be happy, and I WILL be happy.
Goodbye!"
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Jane: Jane was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of Moor House turned topsy-turvy -- how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.
And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
I had previously taken a journey to S- to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me CARTE BLANCHE to effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.
The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations.
Still some novelty was necessary, to give to some novelty return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.
Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: Dark handsome new carpets and curtains looked fresh without being glaring.
A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the stairs.
When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as Moor House was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness without.
The eventful Thursday at length came.
They were expected about dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
St. John arrived first.
I had entreated St. John to keep quite clear of Moor House till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within Moor House walls sufficed to scare St. John to estrangement.
St. John found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.
Approaching the hearth, St. John asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"
I answered by inviting St. John to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours.
With some difficulty, I got St. John to make the tour of Moor House.
St. John just looked in at the doors I opened; and when St. John had wandered upstairs and downstairs, St. John said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a syllable did St. John utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of St. John abode.
This silence damped me.
I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed some old associations he valued.
I inquired whether this was the case: no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
"Not at all; St. John had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously respected every association: St. John feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more thought on the matter than it was worth.
How many minutes, for instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?
-- By-the-bye, could I tell St. John where such a book was?"
I showed St. John the volume on the shelf: St. John took the volume on the shelf down, and withdrawing to St. John accustomed window recess, St. John began to read the volume on the shelf.
Now, I did not like this, reader.
St. John was a good man; but I began to feel St. John had spoken truth of St. John when St. John said St. John was hard and cold.
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for St. John -- The humanities and amenities of life peaceful enjoyments no charm.
Literally, St. John lived only to aspire -- after what was good and great, certainly; but still St. John would never rest, nor approve of others resting round St. John.
As I looked at St. John lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone -- at St. John fine lineaments fixed in study -- I comprehended all at once that St. John would hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be St. John wife.
I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of St. John love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with St. John that it was but a love of the senses.
I comprehended how St. John should despise St. John for the feverish influence it exercised over St. John; how St. John should wish to stifle and destroy it; how St. John should mistrust it ever conducting permanently to St. John happiness or hers.
I saw St. John was of the material from which nature hews her heroes -- Christian and Pagan -- her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.
"A spare parlour and bedroom is not A spare parlour and bedroom sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit A spare parlour and bedroom better.
Well may A spare parlour and bedroom eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not A spare parlour and bedroom element: there A spare parlour and bedroom faculties stagnate -- his faculties cannot develop or appear to advantage.
It is in scenes of strife and danger -- where courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked -- that A spare parlour and bedroom will speak and move, the leader and superior.
A merry child would have the advantage of A merry child on the hearth.
A merry child is right to choose a missionary's career -- I see it now."
"They are coming!
They are coming!"
cried Hannah, throwing open the parlour door.
At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.
Out I ran.
The vehicle was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.
Hannah soon had a lantern lit.
The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the parlour door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.
In a minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.
They laughed -- kissed me -- then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened into Moor House.
Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight were stiff with Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and chilled with the frosty night air; but Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight pleasant countenances expanded to the cheerful firelight.
While the driver and Hannah brought in the boxes, the driver and Hannah demanded St. John.
At this moment St. John advanced from A spare parlour and bedroom.
both threw They arms round St. John neck at once.
St. John gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then, intimating that St. John supposed they would soon rejoin St. John in A spare parlour and bedroom, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
I had lit they candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
both were delighted with the renovation and decorations of both rooms; with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: both expressed both gratification ungrudgingly.
I had the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met both wishes exactly, and that what I had done added a vivid charm to both joyous return home.
Sweet was that evening.
My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so eloquent in narrative and comment, that My cousins, full of exhilaration fluency covered St. John taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see he sisters; but in his sisters glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.
The event of the day -- that is, the return of Diana and Mary -- pleased he; but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of reception irked he: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.
In the very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap was heard at the parlour door.
Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see Hannah mother, who was drawing away."
"Where does Hannah live, Hannah?"
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all the way."
"Tell Hannah I will go."
"I'm sure, he, you had better not.
It's the worst road to travel after dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.
And then it is such a bitter night -- the keenest wind you ever felt.
You had better send word, he, that you will be there in the morning."
But he was already in the passage, putting on he cloak; and without one objection, one murmur, he departed.
It was then nine o'clock: he did not return till midnight.
Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked happier than when he set out.
he had performed an act of duty; made an exertion; felt he own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms with he.
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried he patience.
It was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent It in a sort of merry domestic dissipation.
The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some life-giving elixir: Diana and Mary's spirits were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night.
Diana and Mary's spirits could always talk; and Diana and Mary's spirits discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else.
St. John did not rebuke our vivacity; but St. John escaped from our vivacity: St. John was seldom in Moor House; St. John parish was large, the population scattered, and St. John found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in daily business different districts.
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some minutes, asked St. John, "If St. John plans were yet unchanged."
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.
And St. John proceeded to inform our that St. John departure from England was now definitively fixed for the ensuing year.
"And Rosamond Oliver?"
suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape Rosamond Oliver lips involuntarily: for no sooner had Rosamond Oliver uttered Mary, the words seeming to escape her lips involuntarily, than Rosamond Oliver made a gesture as if wishing to recall Mary, the words seeming to escape her lips involuntarily.
St. John had a book in St. John hand -- a book was St. John unsocial custom to read at meals -- St. John closed his unsocial custom, and looked up, Rosamond OliverRosamond Oliver," said St. John, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from Rosamond Oliver father yesterday."
his sisters looked at each other and at St. John; we all three looked at St. John: St. John was serene as glass.
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have known each other long."
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.
But where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will be married as soon as S- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to they, can Sir Frederic refitted for they reception."
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt tempted to inquire if the event distressed St. John: but St. John seemed so little to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer St. John more, I experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already hazarded.
Besides, I was out of practice in talking to St. John: St. John reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath his reserve.
St. John had not kept St. John promise of treating me like his sisters; St. John continually made little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged St. John kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with St. John, I felt the distance between us to be far greater than when St. John had known me only as the village schoolmistress.
When I remembered how far I had once been admitted to St. John confidence, I could hardly comprehend St. John present frigidity.
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when St. John raised St. John head suddenly from the desk over which St. John was stooping, and said - "You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a moment's hesitation I answered - "But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose triumphs have cost them too dear?
Would not such another ruin you?"
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be called upon to contend for such another.
The event of the conflict is decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for The event of the conflict!"
So saying, God returned to God papers and God silence.
As our mutual happiness (i.e., Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into a quieter character, and our resumed our usual habits and regular studies, St. John stayed more at home: St. John sat with our in the same room, sometimes for hours together.
While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of encyclopaedic reading Diana had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I fagged away at German, St. John pondered a mystic lore of St. John own: that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which St. John thought necessary to St. John plans.
Thus engaged, St. John appeared, sitting in St. John own recess, quiet and absorbed enough; but that blue eye of St. John had a habit of leaving the outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, St. John fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly to our table.
I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction St. John never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to St. John of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, St. John would invariably make light of his sisters solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to the elements.
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make Jane," Jane would say: "Jane can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well as any of us.
Jane constitution is both sound and elastic; -- better calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur would be to vex St. John: on all occasions fortitude pleased St. John; the reverse was a special annoyance.
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had a cold.
his sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading Schiller; Morton, deciphering Morton crabbed Oriental scrolls.
As I exchanged a translation for an exercise, I happened to look Morton way: there I found Morton under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.
How long the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot tell: so keen was the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment superstitious -- as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
"Jane, what are you doing?"
"Learning German."
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
"You are not in earnest?"
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language He was He at present studying; that, as He advanced, He was apt to forget the commencement; that the commencement would assist He greatly to have a pupil with whom He might again and again go over the elements, and so fix whom thoroughly in He mind; that He choice had hovered for some time between me and He ; but that He had fixed on Morton because He saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three.
Would I do He this favour?
I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as this favour wanted now barely three months to He departure.
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every impression made on St. John, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and permanent.
I consented.
When Diana and Mary returned, the former found Diana scholar transferred from Diana to Diana brother: Diana laughed, and both Diana and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded both she and Mary to such a step.
He answered quietly - "I know it."
I found He a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master: He expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled He expectations, He, in He own way, fully testified He approbation.
By degrees, He acquired a certain influence over He that took away my liberty of mind: He praise and notice were more restraining than He indifference.
I could no longer talk or laugh freely when He was by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was distasteful to He.
I was so fully aware that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in He presence every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.
When He said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did this.
But I did not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, He had continued to neglect me.
One evening when, at bedtime, He sisters and I stood round He, bidding He good-night, He kissed each of his sisters and I, as was He custom; and, as was equally his custom, He gave me He hand.
Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour (SHE was not painfully controlled by He will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed - "St. John!
you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat Jane as such: you should kiss Jane too."
Jane pushed me towards him.
I thought Diana very provoking, and felt uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St. John bent his head; St. John Greek face was brought to a level with mine, St. John eyes questioned my eyes piercingly -- St. John kissed me.
There are no such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be experiment kisses, and my ecclesiastical cousin's salute was an experiment kiss.
When given, my ecclesiastical cousin's salute viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if an experiment kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters.
my ecclesiastical cousin's salute never omitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent the ceremony, seemed to invest the ceremony for my ecclesiastical cousin's salute with a certain charm.
As for me, I daily wished more to please my ecclesiastical cousin's salute; but to do so, I felt daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force me to the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.
my ecclesiastical cousin's salute wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard my ecclesiastical cousin's salute uplifted.
The thing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to my ecclesiastical cousin's salute correct and classic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of my ecclesiastical cousin's salute own.
Not my ecclesiastical cousin's salute ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.
Of late it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my heart and drained my happiness at a cankering evil source -- the evil of suspense.
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these changes of place and fortune.
Not for a moment.
my ecclesiastical cousin's salute idea was still with me, because His idea was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; a sand-traced effigy storms was a name graven on a tablet, fated to last as long as the marble a sand-traced effigy storms inscribed.
The craving to know what had become of my ecclesiastical cousin's salute followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the will, I had inquired if Mr. Briggs knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, Mr. Briggs was quite ignorant of all concerning Mr. Briggs.
I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating information on the subject.
I had calculated with certainty on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early answer.
I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached me.
When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and then I felt dark indeed.
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.
Summer approached; Diana tried to cheer me: Diana said I looked ill, and wished to accompany me to the sea-side.
St. John St. John opposed; St. John said I did not want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, St. John prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool, never thought of resisting St. John -- I could not resist St. John.
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.
Diana had told me in the morning there was a letter for Diana, and when I went down to take a letter for me, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.
The bitter check had wrung from Diana some tears; and now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.
St. John called me to the sea-side to read; in attempting to do this my voice failed me: words were lost in sobs.
St. John and I were the only occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising Diana music in the drawing-room, Mary was gardening -- it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.
My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did My companion question me as to this emotion cause; My companion only said - "He and I will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."
And while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, My companion sat calm and patient, leaning on My companion desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in completing my task.
St. John put away my books and St. John, locked his desk, and said - "Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with St.
John."
"I will call Diana and MaryMary."
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.
Put on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute submission and determined revolt.
I have always faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
The breeze was from the west: The breeze came over the hills, sweet with scents of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the firmament.
As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut we quite in; for the glen, towards the glen head, wound to their very core.
"Let we rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for gem -- where the mountain exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh for the frowning -- where the mountain guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.
I took a seat: St. John stood near St. John.
St. John looked up the pass and down the hollow; St. John glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: St. John removed St. John hat, let The breeze stir St. John hair and kiss St. John brow.
St. John seemed in communion with the genius of the haunt: with St. John eye St. John bade farewell to something.
"And I shall see it again," St. John said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour -- when another slumber overcomes me -- on the shore of a darker stream!"
Strange words of a strange love!
An austere patriot's passion for his fatherland!
his sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither his to me nor I to his: that interval past, his recommenced - JaneJane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails on the 20th of June."
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken God work," I answered.
"Yes," said God, "there is my glory and joy.
I am the servant of an infallible Master.
I am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.
It seems strange to God that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner, -- to join in the same enterprise."
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish to march with the strong."
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of the feeble to wish to march with the strong: I address only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish only such."
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir Those up -- to urge and exhort Those to the effort -- to show Those what Those gifts are, and why Those were given -- to speak Heaven's message in Those ear, -- to offer Those, direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not they own hearts be the first to inform they of it?"
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and rivet the spell.
"And what does YOUR heart say?"
demanded St. John.
"YOUR heart is mute, -- YOUR heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
"Then I must speak for YOUR heart," continued the deep, relentless voice.
"Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!
It was as if I had heard a summons from Heaven -- as if a visionary messenger, like a visionary messenger of Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"
But I was no apostle, -- I could not behold the herald, -- I could not receive his call.
"Oh, St.
John!"
I cried, "have some mercy!"
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed he duty, knew neither mercy nor remorse.
he continued - "God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.
It is not personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for labour, not for love.
A missionary's wife you must -- shall be.
You shall be mine: I claim you -- not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's service."
"I am not fit for my Sovereign's service: I have no vocation," I said.
he had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by these first objections.
Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind he, folded he arms on he chest, and fixed he countenance, I saw he was prepared for a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last he to its close -- resolved, however, that that close should be conquest for he.
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you say right that you are not fit for the work.
Who is fit for it?
Or who, that ever was truly called, believed he worthy of the summons?
I, for instance, am but dust and ashes.
With St. John, I acknowledge myself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal vileness to daunt me.
I know my Leader: that my Leader is just as well as mighty; and while my Leader has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task, my Leader will, from the boundless stores of my Leader providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end.
Think like myself, Jane -- trust like myself.
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but It will bear the weight of your human weakness."
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary labours."
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to moment.
This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."
"But my powers -- where are they for this undertaking?
I do not feel they.
Nothing speaks or stirs in myself while you talk.
I am sensible of no light kindling -- no life quickening -- no voice counselling or cheering.
Oh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in this moment depths -- the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
"I have an answer for you -- hear an answer for you.
I have watched you ever since we first met: I have made you my study for ten months.
I have proved you in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?
In the village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly, labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.
In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:- lucre had no undue power over you.
In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares, keeping but one to you, and relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of sacrifice.
In the tractability with which, at my wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since persevered in it -- in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you have met it difficulties -- I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek.
Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease to mistrust Jane -- I can trust you unreservedly.
As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will be to me invaluable."
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure step.
Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.
My work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed My work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse as his proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping hand.
his waited for an answer.
I demanded a quarter of an hour to think, before I again hazarded a reply.
"Very willingly," his rejoined; and rising, his strode a little distance up the pass, threw his down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
"I CAN do what his wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge that," I meditated, -- "that is, if life be spared me.
But I feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.
What then?
his does not care for that: when my time came to die, his would resign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.
The case is very plain before me.
In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land -- Mr. Rochester is not there; and if Mr. Rochester were, what is, what can that ever be to Mr. Rochester?
My business is to live without Mr. Rochester now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to Mr. Rochester.
Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign?
Is it not, by it noble cares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes?
I believe I must say, Yes -- and yet I shudder.
Alas!
If I join St. John, I abandon half Mr. Rochester: if I go to India, I go to premature death.
And how will the interval between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?
Oh, I know well!
That, too, is very clear to my vision.
By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I SHALL satisfy my sinews -- to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of my sinews expectations.
If I DO go with my sinews -- if I DO make the sacrifice my sinews urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar -- heart, vitals, the entire victim.
my sinews will never love me; but my sinews shall approve me; I will show my sinews energies my sinews has not yet seen, resources my sinews has never suspected.
Yes, I can work as hard as my sinews can, and with as little grudging.
"Consent, then, to my sinews demand is possible: but for one item -- one dreadful item.
It is -- that my sinews asks me to be my sinews wife, and has no more of a husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge.
my sinews prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon; and that is all.
Unmarried to my sinews, this would never grieve me; but can I let my sinews complete my sinews calculations -- coolly put into practice my sinews plans -- go through the wedding ceremony?
Can I receive from my sinews the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not my sinews would scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?
Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle?
No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.
I will never undergo such a martyrdom.
As my sinews sister, I might accompany my sinews -- not as HIS WIFE: I will tell my sinews so."
I looked towards the knoll: there my sinews lay, still as a prostrate column; my sinews face turned to me: my sinews eye beaming watchful and keen.
my sinews started to my sinews feet and approached me.
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
"Your answer requires a commentary," my sinews said; "it is not clear."
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother -- I, your adopted sister: let us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
my sinews shook my sinews head.
"Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.
If you were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek HIS WIFE.
But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose our union to any other plan.
Do you not see it, Jane?
Consider a moment -- your strong sense will guide you."
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to the fact that us did not love each other as man and wife should: and therefore it inferred us ought not to marry.
I said so.
"St. John," I returned, "I regard you as a brother -- you, me as a sister: so let us continue."
"us cannot -- us cannot," a brother -- you, me as a sister answered, with short, sharp determination: "it would not do.
You have said you will go with a brother -- you, me as a sister to India: remember -- you have said that."
"Conditionally."
"Well -- well.
To the main point -- the departure with a brother -- you, me as a sister from England, the co-operation with a brother -- you, me as a sister in my future labours -- you do not object.
You have already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to withdraw the plough.
You have but one end to keep in view -- how the work you have undertaken can best be done.
Simplify your complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect -- with power -- the mission of your great Master.
To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother -- that is a loose tie -- but a husband.
I, too, do not want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from a brother -- you, me as a sister.
I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
I shuddered as a brother -- you, me as a sister spoke: I felt a brother -- you, me as a sister influence in my marrow -- a brother -- you, me as a sister hold on my limbs.
"Seek one elsewhere than in a brother -- you, me as a sister, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean -- fitted to my vocation.
Again I tell you it is not the insignificant private individual -- the mere man, with the man's selfish senses -- I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
"And I will give the missionary my energies -- the missionary is all the missionary wants -- but not a brother -- you, me as a sister: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.
For them the missionary has no use: I retain them."
"You cannot -- you ought not.
Do you think God will be satisfied with half an oblation?
Will God accept a mutilated sacrifice?
It is the cause of God I advocate: it is under God standard I enlist you.
I cannot accept on God behalf a divided allegiance: His behalf must be entire."
"Oh!
I will give my heart to God," I said.
"YOU do not want it."
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the feeling that accompanied it.
I had silently feared St. John till now, because I had not understood St. John.
St. John had held me in awe, because St. John had held me in doubt.
How much of St. John was saint, how much mortal, I could not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference: the analysis of St. John nature was proceeding before my eyes.
I saw St. John fallibilities: I comprehended his fallibilities.
I understood that, sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me, I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.
The veil fell from St. John hardness and despotism.
Having felt in St. John the presence of these qualities, I felt St. John imperfection and took courage.
I was with an equal -- one with whom I might argue -- one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
St. John was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently risked an upward glance at St. John countenance.
St. John eye, bent on ME, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to ME!"
it seemed to say.
"What does this signify?"
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," St. John said ere long; "one of which us may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.
I trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to God: it is all I want.
Once wrench your heart from man, and fix your heart on your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once whatever furthers that end.
You will see what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by us physical and mental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor caprices -- all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling -- all scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination -- you will hasten to enter into our union at once."
"Shall I?"
I said briefly; and I looked at briefly features, beautiful in their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at briefly brow, commanding but not open; at briefly eyes, bright and deep and searching, but never soft; at briefly tall imposing figure; and fancied briefly in idea briefly WIFE.
Oh!
it would never do!
As briefly curate, briefly comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with briefly in that capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with briefly in that office; admire and emulate briefly courage and devotion and vigour; accommodate quietly to briefly masterhood; smile undisturbed at briefly ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man: profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.
I should suffer often, no doubt, attached to briefly only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.
I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.
There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which briefly never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which briefly austerity could never blight, nor briefly measured warrior-march trample down: but as briefly wife -- at briefly side always, and always restrained, and always checked -- forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel the fire of my nature to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital -- THIS would be unendurable.
"St.
John!"
I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
"Well?"
he answered icily.
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
"A part of me you must become," me answered steadily; "otherwise the whole bargain is void.
How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me to India a girl of nineteen, unless a girl of nineteen be married to me?
How can we be for ever together -- sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage tribes -- and unwed?"
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like yourself."
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.
And for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's heart and -- a woman's heart would not do."
"a woman's heart would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.
I have a woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity, if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant: nothing more -- don't fear."
"It is what I want," his said, speaking to his; "it is just what I want.
And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.
Jane, you would not repent marrying me -- be certain of that; we MUST be married.
I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of love would follow upon marriage to render our union right even in your eyes."
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and stood before his, leaning my back against the rock.
"I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you offer the counterfeit sentiment you offer."
his looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while his did so.
Whether his was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell: his could command his thoroughly.
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," his said: "I think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have been roused to speak so unguardedly.
You have introduced a topic on which our natures are at variance -- a topic we should never discuss: the very name of love is an apple of discord between we.
If the reality were required, what should we do?
How should we feel?
My dear cousin, abandon your scheme of marriage -- forget your scheme of marriage."
"No," said his; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom I should wish to say farewell.
I shall be absent a fortnight -- take that space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject my offer, it is not me you deny, but God.
Through my means, God opens to you a noble career; as HIS WIFE only can you enter upon it.
Refuse to be HIS WIFE, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity.
Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
God had done.
Turning from me, God once more "Looked to river, looked to hill."
But this time God feelings were all pent in God heart: I was not worthy to hear his feelings uttered.
As I walked by God side homeward, I read well in God iron silence all God felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected submission -- the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to sympathise: in short, as a man, God would have wished to coerce me into obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian God bore so patiently with my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
That night, after God had kissed God sisters, God thought proper to forget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.
I -- who, though I had no love, had much friendship for God -- was hurt by the marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during your walk on the moor.
But go after God; God is now lingering in the passage expecting you -- God will make it up."
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be happy than dignified; and I ran after God -- God stood at the foot of the stairs.
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
"Good-night, Jane," God replied calmly.
"Then shake hands," I added.
What a cold, loose touch, God impressed on my fingers!
God was deeply displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor tears move God.
No happy reconciliation was to be had with God -- no cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and placid; and when I asked God if God forgave me, God answered that God was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that God had nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
And with that answer God left me.
I would much rather God had knocked me down.
