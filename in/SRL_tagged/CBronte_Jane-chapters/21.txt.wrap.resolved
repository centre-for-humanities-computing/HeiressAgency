Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because I have had strange ones of my own. Sympathies, I believe, exist (for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding wholly estranged relatives asserting alienation, the unity of the source to which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with man. When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that Bessie Leaven had been dreaming about a little child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either to one's self or one's kin. The saying might have worn out of my memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix my memory there. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of Bessie little sister. Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with this incident a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling this incident hands in running water. It was a wailing child a night, and a laughing one the next: now this incident nestled close to me, and now this incident ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition evinced, whatever aspect the apparition wore, the apparition failed not for seven successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber. I did not like this iteration of one idea -- this strange recurrence of one image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near. It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and this baby-phantom was on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room. On repairing thither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's servant: a man was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat a man held in a man hand was surrounded with a crape band. "I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," a man said, rising as I entered; "but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still." "Oh, Robert! how do you do? I remember you very well: you used to give me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony. And how is Bessie? You are married to Bessie?" "Yes, Miss: Bessie is very hearty, thank you; Bessie brought me another little one about two months since -- we have three now -- and both mother and child are thriving." "And are the family well at the house, Robert?" "I am sorry I can't give you better news of the family, Bessie: the family are very badly at present -- in great trouble." "I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at Robert black dress. Robert too looked down at the crape round Robert hat and replied - "Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at Robert chambers in London." "Mr. John?" "Yes." "And how does Robert mother bear it?" "Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been very wild: these last three years his gave his up to strange ways, and his death was shocking." "I heard from Bessie his was not doing well." "Doing well! his could not do worse: his ruined his health and his estate amongst the worst men and the worst women. his got into debt and into jail: his helped his out twice, but as soon as his was free his returned to his old companions and habits. his head was not strong: the knaves his lived amongst fooled his beyond anything I ever heard. his came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted Missis to give up all to his. Missis refused: Missis means have long been much reduced by his extravagance; so his went back again, and the next news was that his was dead. How his died, God knows! -- they say his killed his." I was silent: the things were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed - "Missis had been out of health Robert Leaven for some time: Robert Leaven had got very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite breaking Robert Leaven down. The information about Mr. John's death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke. Robert Leaven was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday Robert Leaven seemed rather better: Robert Leaven appeared as if Robert Leaven wanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood Bessie was pronouncing your name; and at last Bessie made out the words, 'Bring Jane -- fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to Jane Eyre.' Bessie is not sure whether Bessie is in Bessie right mind, or means anything by the words; but Bessie told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and advised Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana to send for Bessie. The young ladies put it off at first; but The young ladies mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times, that at last The young ladies consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow morning." "Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go." "I think so too, Bessie Bessie said Bessie was sure you would not refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?" "Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants' hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions of John, I went in search of Mr. Rochester. him was not in any of the lower rooms; him was not in the yard, the stables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if Mrs. Fairfax had seen him; -- yes: Mrs. Fairfax believed him was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not defer, so I approached the master where him stood at Miss Ingram's side. Mrs. Fairfax turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: Mrs. Fairfax eyes seemed to demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a low voice, "Mr. Rochester," Mrs. Fairfax made a movement as if tempted to order me away. I remember Mrs. Fairfax appearance at the moment -- it was very graceful and very striking: Mrs. Fairfax wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in Mrs. Fairfax hair. Mrs. Fairfax had been all animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of Mrs. Fairfax haughty lineaments. "Does that person want you?" Mrs. Fairfax inquired of "Mr. Rochester; and "Mr. Rochester turned to see who the "person" was. "Mr. Rochester made a curious grimace -- one of "Mr. Rochester strange and equivocal demonstrations -- threw down "Mr. Rochester cue and followed me from the room. "Well, Jane?" "Mr. Rochester said, as "Mr. Rochester rested "Mr. Rochester back against the schoolroom door, which "Mr. Rochester had shut. "If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two." "What to do? -- where to go?" "To see a sick lady who has sent for me." "What sick lady? -- where does " "What sick lady live?" "At Gateshead; in -shire." "-shire? That is a hundred miles off! Who may " "What sick lady be that sends for people to see " "What sick lady that distance?" "" "What sick lady name is Reed, sir -- Mrs. Reed." "Reed of Gateshead? There was Mr. Reed." "It is Mr. Reed widow, sir." "And what have you to do with " "What sick lady? How do you know " "What sick lady?" "Mr. Reed was my uncle -- my mother's brother." "The deuce Mr. Reed was! You never told me that before: you always said you had no relations." "None that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and Mr. Reed wife cast me off." "Why?" "Because I was poor, and burdensome, and his wife disliked me." "But Mr. Reed left children? -- you must have cousins? Sir George Lynn was talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, Sir George Lynn said, was one of the veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of the same place, who was much admired for " "What sick lady beauty a season or two ago in London." "a Reed of Gateshead is dead, too, sir: a Reed of Gateshead ruined a Reed of Gateshead and half-ruined a Reed of Gateshead family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked a Reed of Gateshead that The news brought on an apoplectic attack." "And what good can you do his mother? Nonsense, Jane! I would never think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead before you reach his mother: besides, you say his mother cast you off." "Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when his mother circumstances were very different: I could not be easy to neglect his mother wishes now." "How long will you stay?" "As short a time as possible, sir." "Promise me only to stay a week -- " "I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it." "At all events you WILL come back: you will not be induced under any pretext to take up a permanent residence with his mother?" "Oh, no! I shall certainly return if all be well." "And who goes with you? You don't travel a hundred miles alone." "No, sir, his mother has sent his mother coachman." "A person to be trusted?" "Yes, sir, A person to be trusted?" has lived ten years in the family." "Mr. Rochester meditated. "When do you wish to go?" "Early to-morrow morning, sir." "Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How much have you in the world, Jane?" "Mr. Rochester asked, smiling. I drew out my purse; a meagre thing my purse was. "Five shillings, sir." "Mr. Rochester took my purse, poured the hoard into "Mr. Rochester palm, and chuckled over my purse as if my purse scantiness amused "Mr. Rochester. Soon "Mr. Rochester produced "Mr. Rochester pocket- book: "Here," said "Mr. Rochester, offering me a note; his pocket- book was fifty pounds, and "Mr. Rochester owed me but fifteen. I told "Mr. Rochester I had no change. "I don't want change; you know that. Take your wages." I declined accepting more than was my due. "Mr. Rochester scowled at first; then, as if recollecting something, "Mr. Rochester said - "Right, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay away three months if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is it not plenty?" "Yes, sir, but now you owe me five." "Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds." "Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you while I have the opportunity." "Matter of business? I am curious to hear it." "You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?" "Yes; what then?" "In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will perceive the necessity of it." "To get Adele out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over Adele rather too emphatically? There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of the suggestion. Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march straight to -- the devil?" "I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere." "In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of features equally fantastic and ludicrous. he looked at me some minutes. "And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by Adele to seek a place, I suppose?" "No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in asking favours of my relatives -- but I shall advertise." "You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled. "At your peril you advertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten pounds. Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it." "And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind me. "I could not spare the money on any account." "Little niggard!" said "Little niggard, "refusing me a pecuniary request! Give me five pounds, Jane." "Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence." "Just let me look at five pounds, Jane." "No, sir; you are not to be trusted." "Jane!" "Sir?" "Promise me one thing." "I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform." "Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me. I'll find you one in time." "I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters the house." "Very well! very well! I'll pledge my word on my word. You go to-morrow, then?" "Yes, sir; early." "Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?" "No, sir, I must prepare for the journey." "Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?" "I suppose so, sir." "And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane? Teach me; I'm not quite up to it." "They say, Farewell, or any other form They prefer." "Then say it." "Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present." "What must I say?" "The same, if you like, sir." "Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?" "Yes?" "It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly. I should like something else: a little addition to the rite. If one shook hands, for instance; but no -- that would not content me either. So you'll do no more than say Farewell, Jane?" "It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word as in many." "Very likely; but it is blank and cool -- 'Farewell.'" "How long is sir going to stand with sir back against that door?" I asked sir; "I want to commence my packing." The dinner-bell rang, and suddenly away sir bolted, without another syllable: I saw sir no more during the day, and was off before sir had risen in the morning. I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. It was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing Bessie last-born, and Robert and Robert sister played quietly in a corner. "Bless you! -- I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered. "Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed Bessie; "and I trust I am not too late. How is Mr. Reed? -- Alive still, I hope." "Yes, Mr. Reed is alive; and more sensible and collected than Mr. Reed was. The doctor says Mr. Reed may linger a week or two yet; but The doctor hardly thinks Mr. Reed will finally recover." "Has Mr. Reed mentioned me lately?" "Mr. Reed was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come, but Mr. Reed is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the house. Mr. Reed generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and wakes up about six or seven. Will you rest you here an hour, Miss, and then I will go up with you?" Robert entered, and Bessie laid Bessie sleeping child in the cradle and went to welcome The doctor: afterwards Bessie insisted on my taking off my bonnet and having some tea; for Bessie said I looked pale and tired. I was glad to accept Bessie hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as passively as I used to let Bessie undress me when a child. Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched Bessie bustling about -- setting out the tea-tray with Bessie best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as Bessie used to give me in former days. Bessie had retained Bessie quick temper as well as Bessie light foot and good looks. Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but Tea desired me to sit still, quite in Tea old peremptory tones. I must be served at the fireside, Tea said; and Tea placed before Tea a little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as Tea used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and obeyed Tea as in bygone days. Tea wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a person the mistress was; and when I told the mistress there was only a master, whether only a master was a nice gentleman, and if I liked only a master. I told Tea only a master was rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that only a master treated me kindly, and I was content. Then I went on to describe to Tea the gay company that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie listened with interest: these details Bessie listened with interest were precisely of the kind Tea relished. In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to Tea my bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by Bessie, I quitted the lodge for the hall. It was also accompanied by Bessie that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked down the path I was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning in January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart -- a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation -- to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored. a hostile roof now again rose before Tea: my prospects were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a wanderer on the face of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in Tea and my own powers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping wound of my wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished. "You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as Bessie preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there." In another moment I was within that apartment. There was every article of furniture looking just as every article of furniture looking did on the morning I was first introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug Mr. Brocklehurst had stood upon still covered the hearth. Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying the two volumes of Bewick's British Birds old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered past recognition. Two young ladies appeared before Tea; one very tall, almost as tall as Miss Ingram -- very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There was something ascetic in Miss Ingram look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to Eliza former self in that elongated and colourless visage. The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered -- the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair. The hue of Eliza dress was black too; but The hue of her dress fashion was so different from Eliza sister's -- so much more flowing and becoming -- The hue of her dress looked as stylish as the other's looked puritanical. In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother -- and only one; the thin and pallid elder daughter had the mother parent's Cairngorm eye: the blooming and luxuriant younger girl had younger girl contour of jaw and chin -- perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom. Two young ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and Two young ladies addressed me by the name of "Miss Eyre." Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short, abrupt voice, without a smile; and then Eliza's greeting sat down again, fixed Eliza's greeting eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me. Georgiana added to Georgiana "How d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances that measured me from head to foot -- now traversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that Young ladies think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words. A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing their by any positive rudeness in word or deed. A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power over me power over me once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-sarcastic attentions of the other -- Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than any they could raise -- pains and pleasures so much more acute and exquisite had been excited than any it was in they power to inflict or bestow -- that they airs gave me no concern either for good or bad. "How is Mr. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected liberty. "Mr. Reed? Ah! mama, you mean; mama is extremely poorly: I doubt if you can see mama to-night." "If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell mama I am come, I should be much obliged to mama." Georgiana almost started, and Georgiana opened Georgiana blue eyes wild and wide. "I know Georgiana had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not defer attending to Georgiana desire longer than is absolutely necessary." "mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza. I soon rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would just step out to Bessie -- who was, I dared say, in the kitchen -- and ask Georgiana to ascertain whether Mr. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-night. I went, and having found Bessie and despatched Bessie on my errand, I proceeded to take further measures. It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, a year was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay with my aunt till my aunt was better -- or dead: as to my aunt daughters' pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make my aunt independent of it. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked the housekeeper to show me a room, told the housekeeper I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed my trunk thither my aunt: I met Bessie on the landing. "Missis is awake," said Bessie; "I have told Bessie you are here: come and let us see if Bessie will know you." I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days. I hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on the table, for a shaded light was now getting dark. There was the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by my aunt uncommitted. I looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I approached the great four-post bed with amber hangings; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows. Well did I remember Mr. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to this woman now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for this woman great sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries -- to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity. The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever -- there was that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, imperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had that peculiar eye which nothing could melt lowered on my aunt menace and hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived as I traced its harsh line now! And yet I stooped down and kissed this woman: this woman looked at my aunt. "Is this Jane Eyre?" this woman said. "Yes, Mr. Reed. How are you, my aunt?" I had once vowed that I would never call this woman again: I thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now. My fingers had fastened on this woman hand which lay outside the sheet: had this woman pressed My fingers kindly, I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated. Mr. Reed took her hand away, and, turning Mr. Reed face rather from me, Mr. Reed remarked that the night was warm. Again Mr. Reed regarded me so icily, I felt at once that Mr. Reed opinion of my aunt -- Mr. Reed feeling towards my aunt -- was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by Mr. Reed stony eye -- opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears -- that Mr. Reed was resolved to consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give Mr. Reed no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification. I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to subdue Mr. Reed -- to be Mr. Reed mistress in spite both of Mr. Reed nature and Mr. Reed will. My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to them source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over the pillow. "You sent for my aunt," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay till I see how you get on." "Oh, of course! You have seen my daughters?" "Yes." "Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a difficulty in recalling them. But there was something I wished to say -- let me see -- " The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in my daughters once vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, my daughters drew the bedclothes round my daughters; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed the bedclothes down: my daughters was at once irritated. "Sit up!" said my daughters; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast. Are you Jane Eyre?" "I am Jane Eyre." "I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe. Such a burden to be left on my hands -- and so much annoyance as my daughters caused me, daily and hourly, with my daughters incomprehensible disposition, and my daughters sudden starts of temper, and my daughters continual, unnatural watchings of one's movements! I declare my daughters talked to me once like something mad, or like a fiend -- no child ever spoke or looked as my daughters did; I was glad to get my daughters away from the house. What did they do with my daughters at Lowood? The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. my daughters, however, did not die: but I said my daughters did -- I wish my daughters had died!" "A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate my daughters so?" "I had a dislike to my daughters mother always; for my daughters was my husband's only sister, and a great favourite with my husband: my husband opposed the family's disowning my daughters when my daughters made my daughters low marriage; and when news came of my daughters death, my husband wept like a simpleton. my husband would send for the baby; though I entreated the baby rather to put the baby out to nurse and pay for the baby maintenance. I hated the baby the first time I set my eyes on the baby -- a sickly, whining, pining thing! the baby would wail in the baby cradle all night long -- not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning. Mr. Reed pitied it; and Mr. Reed used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been Mr. Reed own: more, indeed, than Mr. Reed ever noticed Mr. Reed own at that age. Mr. Reed would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and Mr. Reed was angry with my children when my children showed my children dislike. In Mr. Reed last illness, Mr. Reed had it brought continually to Mr. Reed bedside; and but an hour before Mr. Reed died, Mr. Reed bound me by vow to keep the creature. I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but Mr. Reed was weak, naturally weak. Mr. Reed does not at all resemble Mr. Reed father, and I am glad of it: Mr. Reed is like me and like my brothers -- Mr. Reed is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish Mr. Reed would cease tormenting me with letters for money? I have no more money to give Mr. Reed: we are getting poor. I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let half the servants off. I can never submit to do that -- yet how are we to get on? Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages. Mr. Reed gambles dreadfully, and always loses -- poor boy! Mr. Reed is beset by sharpers: Mr. Reed is sunk and degraded -- Mr. Reed look is frightful -- I feel ashamed for Mr. Reed when I see Mr. Reed." She was getting much excited. "I think I had better leave She now," said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed. "Perhaps you had, She: but She often talks in this way towards night -- in the morning She is calmer." I rose. "Stop!" exclaimed Mr. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to say. Mr. Reed threatens me -- Mr. Reed continually threatens me with Mr. Reed own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see Mr. Reed laid out with a great wound in Mr. Reed throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be done? How is the money to be had?" Bessie now endeavoured to persuade Bessie to take a sedative draught: Bessie succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mr. Reed grew more composed, and sank into a dozing state. I then left Bessie. More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with Bessie. Bessie continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade everything which could painfully excite Bessie. Meantime, I got on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza. Georgiana and Eliza were very cold, indeed, at first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or Eliza sister. Georgiana would chatter nonsense to Georgiana canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and both served me for both. Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take a seat apart from some sheets of paper, near the window, and busy me in sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape a seat in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing a seat disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of some sheets of paper; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom. One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave a soft black pencil a broad point, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill the paper with features. Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible- looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the eyes: I had left some black whiskers to the last, because some black whiskers required the most careful working. I drew some black whiskers large; I shaped some black whiskers well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large. "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I surveyed the effect: "some black whiskers want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly -- a happy touch or two secured success. There, I had a friend's face under my gaze; and what did a friend's face signify that those young ladies turned those young ladies backs on me? I looked at a friend's face; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content. "Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had approached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head, and hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But what was that to a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester, or to any one but me? Georgiana also advanced to look. The other drawings pleased Georgiana much, but Georgiana called that "an ugly man." The other drawings both seemed surprised at my skill. I offered to sketch The other drawings portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana produced Georgiana album. I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put Georgiana at once into good humour. Georgiana proposed a walk in the grounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: Georgiana had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter Georgiana had spent in London two seasons ago -- of the admiration Georgiana had there excited -- the attention Georgiana had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest Georgiana had made. In the course of the afternoon and evening hints of the titled conquest she had made were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by Georgiana for my benefit. The communications were renewed from day to day: The communications always ran on the same theme -- herself, Georgiana loves, and woes. It was strange Georgiana never once adverted either to her mother's illness, or Georgiana brother's death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects. Georgiana mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to come. Georgiana passed about five minutes each day in her mother's sick-room, and no more. Eliza still spoke little: Eliza had evidently no time to talk. I never saw a busier person than Eliza seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what Eliza did: or rather, to discover any result of Eliza diligence. Eliza had an alarm to call Eliza up early. I know not how Eliza occupied Eliza before breakfast, but after that meal Eliza divided Eliza time into regular portions, and each hour had its allotted task. Three times a day Eliza studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I asked Eliza once what was the great attraction of that volume, and Eliza said, "the Rubric." Three hours Eliza gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, Eliza informed me this article was a covering for the altar of Gateshead Church lately erected near Gateshead. Two hours Eliza devoted to Eliza diary; two to working by Eliza in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of Eliza accounts. Eliza seemed to want no company; no conversation. I believe Eliza was happy in Eliza way: this routine sufficed for Eliza; and nothing annoyed Eliza so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced Eliza to vary its clockwork regularity. Eliza told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than usual, that Mr. Reed's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had been a source of profound affliction to Eliza: but Eliza had now, Eliza said, settled Eliza mind, and formed Eliza resolution. Eliza own fortune Eliza had taken care to secure; and when Eliza died -- and it was wholly improbable, Eliza tranquilly remarked, that Eliza should either recover or linger long -- Eliza would execute a long-cherished project: seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance, and place safe barriers between Eliza and a frivolous world. I asked if Georgiana would accompany Georgiana. "Of course not. Georgiana and Georgiana had nothing in common: Georgiana and she never had had. Georgiana would not be burdened with Georgiana society for any consideration. Georgiana should take Georgiana own course; and Georgiana, Eliza, would take hers." Georgiana, when not unburdening Georgiana heart to Georgiana, spent most of Georgiana time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing over and over again that Georgiana aunt Gibson would send her aunt Gibson an invitation up to town. "It would be so much better," her aunt Gibson said, "if her aunt Gibson could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over." I did not ask what her aunt Gibson meant by "all being over," but I suppose her aunt Gibson referred to the expected decease of her aunt Gibson and the gloomy sequel of funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice of Eliza sister's indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had been before her aunt Gibson. One day, however, as Eliza put away Eliza account-book and unfolded Eliza embroidery, Eliza suddenly took Eliza up thus - "Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make no use of life. Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden no one or no one with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too, existence for yourself must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be flattered -- you must have music, dancing, and society -- or you languish, you die away. Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own? Take one day; share it into sections; to each section apportion it task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes -- include all; do each piece of business in it turn with method, with rigid regularity. The day will close almost before you are aware The day has begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may. Neglect it -- go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling -- and suffer the results of your idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be. I tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on this. After her mother's death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her mother coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known each other. You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this -- if the whole human race, we excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new." her mother closed her mother lips. "You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade," answered Georgiana. "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless creature in existence: and I know your spiteful hatred towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above yourself, to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever." Georgiana took out Georgiana handkerchief and blew Georgiana nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious. True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably savourless for the want of it. Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition. It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day service at the new church -- for in matters of religion Georgiana was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what Georgiana considered Georgiana devotional duties; fair or foul, Georgiana went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers. I bethought Georgiana to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid Georgiana but a remittent attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of the room whenever Georgiana could. Bessie was faithful; but Bessie had Bessie own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; Bessie livid face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on Bessie who could not now gaze on Georgiana, and then I moved away to the window. The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously: "One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements. Whither will that spirit -- now struggling to quit its material tenement -- flit when at length released?" In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled Helen Burns dying words -- Helen Burns faith -- Helen Burns doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls. I was still listening in thought to Helen Burns well-remembered tones -- still picturing Helen Burns pale and spiritual aspect, Helen Burns wasted face and sublime gaze, as Helen Burns lay on Helen Burns placid deathbed, and whispered Helen Burns longing to be restored to Helen Burns divine Father's bosom -- when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?" I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was Mrs. Reed reviving? I went up to Mrs. Reed. "It is I, Aunt Reed." "Who -- I?" was Mrs. Reed answer. "Who are you?" looking at Georgiana with surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. "You are quite a stranger to Georgiana -- where is Bessie?" "Mrs. Reed is at the lodge, aunt." "Aunt," Mrs. Reed repeated. "Who calls me aunt? You are not one of the Gibsons; and yet I know you -- that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to Georgiana: you are like -- why, you are like Jane Eyre!" I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my identity. "Yet," said Mrs. Reed, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me. I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists: besides, in eight years Mrs. Reed must be so changed." I now gently assured Mrs. Reed that I was the person Mrs. Reed supposed and desired me to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that Mrs. Reed senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent Bessie husband to fetch me from Thornfield. "I am very ill, I know," Bessie said ere long. "I was trying to turn Georgiana a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health, burdens we at such an hour as the present is to Georgiana. Is the nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?" I assured Bessie we were alone. "Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now. One was in breaking the promise which I gave her husband to bring you up as my own child; the other -- " Bessie stopped. "After all, it is of no great importance, perhaps," Bessie murmured to Bessie: "and then I may get better; and to humble Bessie so to Bessie is painful." Bessie made an effort to alter Bessie position, but failed: Bessie face changed; Bessie seemed to experience some inward sensation -- the precursor, perhaps, of the last pang. "Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before Bessie: I had better tell Bessie. -- Go to my dressing-case, open my dressing-case, and take out a letter you will see there." I obeyed Bessie directions. "Read a letter you will see there," Bessie said. a letter you will see there was short, and thus conceived:- "Bessie, -- Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how Bessie is? It is my intention to write shortly and desire Bessie to come to Bessie at Madeira. Providence has blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt Bessie during my life, and bequeath Bessie at my mother's death whatever I may have to leave. -- I am, Madam, &c., &c., "JOHN EYRE, Madeira." It was dated three years back. "Why did I never hear of this?" I asked. "Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in lifting you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct to Bessie, Jane -- the fury with which you once turned on Bessie; the tone in which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought of Bessie made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at Bessie with human eyes and cursed me in a man's voice. -- Bring me some water! Oh, make haste!" "Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered Mrs. Reed the draught Mrs. Reed required, "think no more of all this, let all this pass away from your mind. Forgive me for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have passed since that day." Mrs. Reed heeded nothing of what I said; but when Mrs. Reed had tasted some water and drawn breath, Mrs. Reed went on thus - "I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was what I could not endure. I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for him disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: Jane Eyre had died of typhus fever at Lowood. Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion -- expose my falsehood as soon as you like. You were born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to commit." "If you could but be persuaded to think no more of you could, aunt, and to regard me with kindness and forgiveness" "You have a very bad disposition," said aunt, "and one to that day I feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and violence, I can never comprehend." "My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not vindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt." I approached my cheek to aunt : aunt would not touch her lips. aunt said I oppressed aunt by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water. As I laid aunt down -- for I raised aunt and supported aunt on my arm while aunt drank -- I covered aunt ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble fingers shrank from my touch -- the glazing eyes shunned my gaze. "Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace." Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for aunt to make now the effort to change aunt habitual frame of mind: living, living had ever hated me -- dying, living must hate me still. The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered half-an-hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but living gave none. living was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did living mind again rally: at twelve o'clock that night living died. I was not present to close living eyes, nor were either of living daughters. They came to tell They the next morning that all was over. living was by that time laid out. Eliza and I went to look at living: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said living dared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame, rigid and still: living eye of flint was covered with her eye of flint cold lid; living brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of living inexorable soul. A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me. I gazed on that corpse to me with gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or subduing did that corpse to me inspire; only a grating anguish for living woes -- not MY loss -- and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form. Eliza surveyed Eliza parent calmly. After a silence of some minutes Eliza observed - "With Eliza constitution Eliza should have lived to a good old age: Eliza life was shortened by trouble." And then a spasm constricted Eliza mouth for an instant: as her mouth passed away Eliza turned and left the room, and so did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.
