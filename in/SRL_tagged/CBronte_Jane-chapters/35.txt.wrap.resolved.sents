He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as He had said He would.
He deferred He departure a whole week, and during that time He made me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended He.
Without one overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, He contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of He favour.
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness -- not that St. John would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in St. John power to do so.
Both by nature and principle, St. John was superior to the mean gratification of vengeance: St. John had forgiven me for saying I scorned St. John and St. John love, but St. John had not forgotten the words; and as long as St. John and I lived St. John never would forget he and I. I saw by St. John look, when St. John turned to me, that he and I were always written on the air between me and St. John; whenever I spoke, he and I sounded in my voice to St. John ear, and he and I echo toned every answer St. John gave me.
St. John did not abstain from conversing with me: St. John even called me as usual each morning to join St. John at St. John desk; and I fear the corrupt man within St. John had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in evincing with what skill St. John could, while acting and speaking apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere charm to St. John language and manner.
To me, St. John was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble; St. John eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; St. John tongue a speaking instrument -- nothing more.
All this was torture to me -- refined, lingering torture.
All this kept up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed and crushed me altogether.
I felt how -- if I were St. John wife, this good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on St. John own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime.
Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate St. John.
No ruth met my ruth.
No ruth experienced no suffering from estrangement -- no yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent, no yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent produced no more effect on No ruth than if No ruth heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.
To No ruth sisters, meantime, No ruth was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and banned, No ruth added the force of contrast; and this I am sure No ruth did not by force, but on principle.
The night before No ruth left home, happening to see No ruth walking in the garden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at No ruth, that this man, alienated as No ruth now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain No ruth friendship.
I went out and approached No ruth as No ruth stood leaning over the little gate; I spoke to the point at once.
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.
Let we be friends."
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while No ruth still watched the rising of the moon, which No ruth had been contemplating as I approached.
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.
You know that."
"Are we not?
That is wrong.
For my part, I wish you no ill and all good."
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere strangers."
"Of course," No ruth said.
"Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from regarding you as a stranger."
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling enough.
Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly than those feelings could.
I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and principle.
him friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me severely.
I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
"Must we part in this way, St. John?
And when you go to India, will you leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
him now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!
What!
do you not go to India?"
"You said I could not unless I married you."
"And you will not marry me!
You adhere to that resolution?"
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into the ice of those cold people questions?
How much of the fall of the avalanche is in those cold people anger?
of the breaking up of the frozen sea in those cold people displeasure?
"No.
St. John, I will not marry you.
I adhere to that resolution."
the avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but the avalanche did not yet crash down.
"Once more, why this refusal?"
he asked.
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply, because you almost hate me.
If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
You are killing me now."
he lips and cheeks turned white -- quite white.
"I SHOULD KILL YOU -- I AM KILLING YOU?
Your words are such as ought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.
those cold people betray an unfortunate state of mind: those cold people merit severe reproof: those cold people would seem inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive the duty of man fellow even until seventy-and-seven times."
I had finished the business now.
While earnestly wishing to erase from the duty of man mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt that tenacious surface in.
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.
"It is useless to attempt to conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because these words touched on the truth.
That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.
I knew the steely ire I had whetted.
I was heart-wrung.
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing the duty of man hand: "I have no intention to grieve or pain you -- indeed, I have not."
Most bitterly the duty of man smiled -- most decidedly the duty of man withdrew his hand from mine.
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume?"
said the duty of man, after a considerable pause.
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
A very long silence succeeded.
What struggle there was in the duty of man between Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams scintillated in the duty of man eyes, and strange shadows passed over the duty of man face.
the duty of man spoke at last.
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.
I proved it to you in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever again alluding to the plan.
That you have done so, I regret -- for your sake."
I interrupted the duty of man.
Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at once.
"Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.
You pretend to be shocked by what I have said.
You are not really shocked: for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.
I say again, I will be your curate, if you like, but never your wife."
Again the duty of man turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled the duty of man passion perfectly.
the duty of man answered emphatically but calmly - "A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.
With the duty of man, then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor.
Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and much too despotic for the occasion.
I replied - "There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.
I am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with strangers.
With you I would have ventured much, because I admire, confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
"Ah!
you are afraid of you," the duty of man said, curling the duty of man lip.
"I am.
God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it."
"What do you mean?"
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by some means that doubt is removed."
"I know where your heart turns and to what your heart clings.
The interest you cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.
Long since you ought to have crushed your heart: now you should blush to allude to your heart.
You think of Mr.
Rochester?"
It was true.
I confessed your heart by silence.
"Are you going to seek Mr.
Rochester?"
"I must find out what is become of Mr.
Rochester."
"It remains for the duty of man, then," Mr. Rochester said, "to remember you in my prayers, and to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed become a castaway.
I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
But God sees not as man sees: God will be done -- " God opened the gate, passed through the gate, and strayed away down the glen.
God was soon out of sight.
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking very thoughtful.
Diana was a great deal taller than the duty of man: Diana put Diana hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
"Jane," Jane said, "you are always agitated and pale now.
I am sure there is something the matter.
Tell me what business St. John and you have on hands.
I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly know what.
St. John is a strange being -- " Jane paused -- I did not speak: soon Jane resumed - "That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting you, I am sure: That brother of mine has long distinguished you by a notice and interest That brother of mine never showed to any one else -- to what end?
I wish That brother of mine loved you -- does That brother of mine, Jane?"
I put Jane cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
"Then why does That brother of mine follow you so with That brother of mine eyes, and get you so frequently alone with That brother of mine, and keep you so continually at That brother of mine side?
Mary and I had Mary and I concluded That brother of mine wished you to marry That brother of mine."
"That brother of mine does -- That brother of mine has asked me to be That brother of mine wife."
Diana clapped Diana hands.
"That is just what we hoped and thought!
And you will marry That brother of mine, Jane, won't you?
And then That brother of mine will stay in England."
"Far from that, Diana; That brother of mine sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a fitting fellow-labourer in a fitting fellow-labourer Indian toils."
"What!
That brother of mine wishes you to go to India?"
"Yes."
"Madness!"
Diana exclaimed.
"You would not live three months there, I am certain.
You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
"I have refused to marry a fitting fellow-labourer -- " "And have consequently displeased a fitting fellow-labourer?"
Diana suggested.
"Deeply: a fitting fellow-labourer will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany a fitting fellow-labourer as a fitting fellow-labourer sister."
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.
Think of the task you undertook -- one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong, and you are weak.
St. John -- you know St. John -- would urge you to impossibilities: with St. John there would be no permission to rest during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever St. John exacts, you force yourself to perform.
I am astonished you found courage to refuse St. John hand.
You do not love St. John then, Jane?"
"Not as a husband."
"Yet St. John is a handsome fellow."
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.
We should never suit."
"Plain!
You?
Not at all.
You are much too pretty, as well as too good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta."
And again Jane earnestly conjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with Jane brother.
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of serving St. John for a deacon, St. John expressed St. John shocked at my want of decency.
St. John seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany St. John unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find in St. John a brother, and habitually regarded St. John as such."
"What makes you say St. John does not love you, Jane?"
"You should hear St. John on the subject.
St. John has again and again explained that it is not St. John, but St. John office St. John wishes to mate.
St. John has told me I am formed for labour -- not for love: which is true, no doubt.
But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that I am not formed for marriage.
Would it not be strange, Die, to be chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
"Insupportable -- unnatural -- out of the question!"
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for a man who regarded one now, yet, if forced to be a man who regarded one wife, I can imagine the possibility of conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for a man who regarded one, because a man who regarded one is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur in a man who regarded one look, manner, and conversation.
In that case, my lot would become unspeakably wretched.
a man who regarded one would not want me to love a man who regarded one; and if I showed the feeling, a man who regarded one would make me sensible that it was a superfluity, unrequired by a man who regarded one, unbecoming in me.
I know a man who regarded one would."
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
"a man who regarded one is a good and a great man; but a man who regarded one forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing a man who regarded one own large views.
It is better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of a man who regarded one way, lest, in a man who regarded one progress, a man who regarded one should trample them down.
Here a man who regarded one comes!
I will leave you, Diana."
And I hastened upstairs as I saw a man who regarded one entering the garden.
But I was forced to meet a man who regarded one again at supper.
During that meal a man who regarded one appeared just as composed as usual.
I had thought a man who regarded one would hardly speak to me, and I was certain a man who regarded one had given up the pursuit of a man who regarded one matrimonial scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.
a man who regarded one addressed me precisely in a man who regarded one ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been a man who regarded one ordinary manner -- one scrupulously polite.
No doubt a man who regarded one had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in a man who regarded one, and now believed a man who regarded one had forgiven me once more.
For the evening reading before prayers, a man who regarded one selected the twenty-first chapter of Revelation.
It was at all times pleasant to listen while from a man who regarded one lips fell the words of the Bible: never did a man who regarded one fine voice sound at once so sweet and full -- never did a man who regarded one manner become so impressive in the Bible noble simplicity, as when a man who regarded one delivered the oracles of God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone -- that manner a more thrilling meaning -- as a man who regarded one sat in the midst of a man who regarded one household circle (the May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as a man who regarded one sat there, bending over the great old Bible, and described from the Bible page the vision of the new heaven and the new earth -- told how God would come to dwell with men, how a man who regarded one would wipe away all tears from men eyes, and promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as a man who regarded one spoke men: especially as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in uttering men, a man who regarded one eye had turned on me.
"a man who regarded one that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be a man who regarded one God, and a man who regarded one shall be my son.
But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have the unbelieving, &c. part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked St. John enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.
The reader believed St. John name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and St. John yearned after the hour which should admit St. John to the city to which the kings of the earth bring the kings of the earth glory and honour; which has no need of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens the glory of God, and the Lamb is the light thereof.
In the prayer following the chapter, all the Lamb energy gathered -- all the Lamb stern zeal woke: the Lamb was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved on a conquest.
the Lamb supplicated strength for the weak- hearted; guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from the narrow path.
the Lamb asked, the Lamb urged, the Lamb claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning.
Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as I listened to the prayer following the chapter, I wondered at the Lamb; then, when the prayer following the chapter continued and rose, I was touched by the prayer following the chapter, and at last awed.
the Lamb felt the greatness and goodness of the Lamb purpose so sincerely: others who heard the Lamb plead for it, could not but feel it too.
the prayer following the chapter, we took leave of the Lamb: the Lamb was to go at a very early hour in the morning.
Diana and Mary having kissed the Lamb, left the room -- in compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from the Lamb: I tendered my hand, and wished the Lamb a pleasant journey.
"Thank you, Jane.
As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.
If I listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim -- to do all things to the glory of God.
God was long-suffering: so will I be.
I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath: repent -- resolve, while there is yet time.
Remember, we are bid to work while it is day -- warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.
God give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!"
his laid his on my head as his uttered the last words.
his had spoken earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering sheep -- or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which his is responsible.
All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not; whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots -- provided only they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots -- be sincere -- have they sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.
I felt veneration for St. John -- veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long shunned.
I was tempted to cease struggling with his -- to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf of his existence, and there lose my own.
I was almost as hard beset by his now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.
I was a fool both times.
To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.
So I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.
My refusals were forgotten -- my fears overcome -- my wrestlings paralysed.
The Impossible -- I.E., my marriage with St. John -- was fast becoming the Possible.
All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.
Religion called -- Angels beckoned -- God commanded -- life rolled together like a scroll -- death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.
The dim room was full of visions.
"Could you decide now?"
asked the missionary.
The inquiry was put in gentle tones: he drew me to he as gently.
Oh, that gentleness!
how far more potent is it than force!
I could resist St. John wrath: I grew pliant as a reed under St. John kindness.
Yet I knew all the time, if I yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my former rebellion.
my former rebellion nature was not changed by one hour of solemn prayer: His nature was only elevated.
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here and now -- come afterwards what would!"
"My prayers are heard!"
ejaculated St. John.
my former rebellion pressed my former rebellion hand firmer on my head, as if my former rebellion claimed me: my former rebellion surrounded me with my former rebellion arm, ALMOST as if my former rebellion loved me (I say ALMOST -- I knew the difference -- for I had felt what it was to be loved; but, like my former rebellion, I had now put love out of the question, and thought only of duty).
I contended with my inward dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.
I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.
"Show me, show me the path!"
I entreated of Heaven.
I was excited more than I had ever been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader shall judge.
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself, were now retired to rest.
The one candle was dying out: The dim room was full of moonlight.
My heart beat fast and thick: I heard My heart throb.
Suddenly My heart stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled My heart through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.
an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities was not like an electric shock, but an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities was quite as sharp, as strange, as startling: an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which their were now summoned and forced to wake.
their rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my bones.
"What have you heard?
What do you see?"
asked St. John.
I saw nothing, but I heard a voice somewhere cry - "Jane!
Jane!
Jane!"
-- nothing more.
"O God!
what is it?"
I gasped.
I might have said, "Where is it?"
for it did not seem in The dim room nor in the house -- nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air -- nor from under the earth -- nor from overhead.
I had heard it -- where, or whence, for ever impossible to know!
And it was the voice of a human being -- a known, loved, well-remembered voice -- that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
"I am coming!"
I cried.
"Wait for "!
Oh, I will come!"
I flew to the door and looked into the passage: the door was dark.
I ran out into the garden: the door was void.
"Where are you?"
I exclaimed.
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back -- "Where are you?"
I listened.
The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland loneliness and midnight hush.
"Down superstition!"
I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the black yew at the gate.
"This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft: it is the work of nature.
She was roused, and did -- no miracle -- but She best."
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.
It was MY time to assume ascendency.
MY powers were in play and in force.
I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave me: I must and would be alone.
him obeyed at once.
Where there is energy to command well enough, obedience never fails.
I mounted to my chamber; locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way -- a different way to St. John, but effective in my chamber own fashion.
I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at my soul feet.
I rose from the thanksgiving -- took a resolve -- and lay down, unscared, enlightened -- eager but for the daylight.
