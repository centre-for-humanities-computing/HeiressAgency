Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and solitude I had passed beneath Thornfield Hall roof!
All sad feelings seemed now driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life everywhere, movement all day long.
You could not now traverse the gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called the servants' occupants out into the grounds.
Even when that weather was broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my ignorance I did not understand the term.
the servants' were called in, the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.
While Mr. Rochester directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for the ladies maids.
Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and certain wardrobes of the third storey contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room.
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round Mr. Rochester, and was selecting certain of the ladies number to be of Mr. Rochester party.
"Miss Ingram is mine, of course," said Miss Ingram: afterwards Miss Ingram named the two Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent.
Miss Ingram looked at Miss Ingram: I happened to be near Miss Ingram, as I had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
"Will you play?"
Miss Ingram asked.
I shook my head.
Miss Ingram did not insist, which I rather feared Miss Ingram would have done; Miss Ingram allowed me to return quietly to my usual seat.
Miss Ingram and Miss Ingram aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.
One of the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should be asked to join He and his aids; but Miss Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
"No," I heard Miss Ingram say: "Miss Ingram looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.
Within the arch, the bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before Mr. Rochester, on a table, lay open a large book; and at Mr. Rochester side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's cloak, and holding a book in Amy Eshton hand.
Somebody, unseen, rang a bell merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of Amy Eshton guardian's party), bounded forward, scattering round Amy Eshton the contents of a basket of flowers Amy Eshton carried on Amy Eshton arm.
Then appeared the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on Amy Eshton head, and a wreath of roses round Amy Eshton brow; by Amy Eshton walked Mr. Rochester, and together they drew near a table.
they knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white stations behind Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white.
A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage.
At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out - "Bride!"
Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
A considerable interval elapsed before Mr. Rochester again rose.
Mr. Rochester second rising displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.
The drawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within the dining-room, appeared a large marble basin -- which I recognised as an ornament of the conservatory -- where Mr. Rochester usually stood, surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish -- and whence Mr. Rochester must have been transported with some trouble, on account of Mr. Rochester size and weight.
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.
his dark eyes and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: his looked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.
She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about She temples; She beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of She, too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist upraised in the act of supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on She head.
Both She cast of form and feature, She complexion and She general air, suggested the idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the character She intended to represent.
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill She pitcher; She again lifted it to her head.
The personage on the well-brink now seemed to accost She; to make some request:- "She hasted, let down her pitcher on She hand, and gave her pitcher to drink."
From the bosom of her pitcher robe her pitcher then produced a casket, opened a casket and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; She acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, her pitcher laid the treasure at She feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by She looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on She arms and the rings in She ears.
It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were wanting.
The divining party again laid The divining party heads together: apparently The divining party could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.
Colonel Dent, The divining party spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the curtain again descended.
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse drapery.
The marble basin was removed; in The marble basin place, stood a deal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.
I knew Mr. Rochester; though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (Mr. Rochester coat hanging loose from one arm, as if his coat had been almost torn from Mr. Rochester back in a scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well have disguised Mr. Rochester.
As Mr. Rochester moved, a chain clanked; to Mr. Rochester wrists were attached fetters.
"Bridewell!"
exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume the performers ordinary costume, the performers re-entered the dining-room.
Mr. Rochester led in Miss Ingram; Mr. Rochester was complimenting Mr. Rochester on Mr. Rochester acting.
"Do you know," said Mr. Rochester, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in the last best?
Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
"Is all the soot washed from my face?"
Mr. Rochester asked, turning it towards Mr. Rochester.
"Alas!
yes: the more's the pity!
Nothing could be more becoming to your complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour since, in the presence of all these witnesses."
my wife giggled, and my wife colour rose.
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."
And as the other party withdrew, he and he band took the vacated seats.
Miss Ingram placed Miss Ingram at Miss Ingram leader's right hand; the other diviners filled the chairs on each side of he and Miss Ingram.
I did not now watch the actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.
What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word Colonel Dent and his party chose, how Colonel Dent and his party acquitted Colonel Dent and his party, I no longer remember; but I still see the consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to Mr. Rochester; I see Miss Ingram incline Miss Ingram towards Mr. Rochester, till the jetty curls almost touch Mr. Rochester shoulder and wave against Mr. Rochester cheek; I hear Colonel Dent and his party mutual whisperings; I recall Colonel Dent and his party interchanged glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment.
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not unlove Mr. Rochester now, merely because I found that Mr. Rochester had ceased to notice me -- because I might pass hours in Mr. Rochester presence, and Mr. Rochester would never once turn Mr. Rochester in my direction -- because I saw all Mr. Rochester attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of Miss Ingram robes as Miss Ingram passed; who, if ever Miss Ingram dark and imperious eye fell on Mr. Rochester by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation.
I could not unlove Mr. Rochester, because I felt sure Mr. Rochester would soon marry this very lady -- because I read daily in this very lady a proud security in Mr. Rochester intentions respecting this very lady -- because I witnessed hourly in Mr. Rochester a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair.
Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's.
But I was not jealous: or very rarely; -- the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.
Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: Miss Ingram was too inferior to excite the feeling.
Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.
Miss Ingram was very showy, but Miss Ingram was not genuine: Miss Ingram had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but Miss Ingram mind was poor, Miss Ingram heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness.
Miss Ingram was not good; Miss Ingram was not original: Miss Ingram used to repeat sounding phrases from books: Miss Ingram never offered, nor had, an opinion of Miss Ingram own.
Miss Ingram advocated a high tone of sentiment; but Miss Ingram did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in Miss Ingram.
Too often Miss Ingram betrayed this, by the undue vent Miss Ingram gave to a spiteful antipathy Miss Ingram had conceived against little Adele: pushing Miss Ingram away with some contumelious epithet if Miss Ingram happened to approach Miss Ingram; sometimes ordering Miss Ingram from the room, and always treating Miss Ingram with coldness and acrimony.
Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character -- watched Other eyes besides mine closely, keenly, shrewdly.
Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester, exercised over Mr. Rochester intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity -- this guardedness of Mr. Rochester -- this perfect, clear consciousness of Mr. Rochester fair one's defects -- this obvious absence of passion in Mr. Rochester sentiments towards Miss Ingram, that my ever-torturing pain arose.
I saw Mr. Rochester was going to marry Miss Ingram, for family, perhaps political reasons, because Miss Ingram rank and connections suited Mr. Rochester; I felt Mr. Rochester had not given Miss Ingram Mr. Rochester love, and that Miss Ingram qualifications were ill adapted to win from Mr. Rochester that treasure.
This was the point -- This was where the nerve was touched and teased -- This was where the fever was sustained and fed: Miss Ingram COULD NOT CHARM HIM.
If Miss Ingram had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely laid he heart at Miss Ingram , I should have covered my face, turned to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely laid his heart at her feet.
If Miss Ingram Miss Ingram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two tigers -- jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired Miss Ingram -- acknowledged Miss Ingram excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days: and the more absolute Miss Ingram superiority, the deeper would have been my admiration -- the more truly tranquil my quiescence.
But as matters really stood, to watch Miss IngramMiss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated failure -- herself unconscious that their did fail; vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming Miss Ingram on success, when Miss Ingram pride and self-complacency repelled further and further what Miss Ingram wished to allure -- to witness THIS, was to be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
Because, when Miss Ingram failed, I saw how Miss Ingram might have succeeded.
Arrows that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell harmless at Mr. Rochester , might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have quivered keen in Mr. Rochester proud heart -- have called love into Mr. Rochester stern eye, and softness into Mr. Rochester sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a silent conquest might have been won.
"Why can Miss Ingram not influence Mr. Rochester more, when Miss Ingram is privileged to draw so near to Mr.
Rochester?"
I asked myself.
"Surely Miss Ingram cannot truly like Mr. Rochester, or not like Mr. Rochester with true affection!
If Miss Ingram did, Miss Ingram need not coin Miss Ingram smiles so lavishly, flash Miss Ingram glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate, graces so multitudinous.
It seems to myself that Miss Ingram might, by merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get nigher his heart.
I have seen in his face a far different expression from that which hardens it now while Miss Ingram is so vivaciously accosting his; but then it came of it: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it -- to answer what his asked without pretension, to address his when needful without grimace -- and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam.
How will Miss Ingram manage to please his when they are married?
I do not think Miss Ingram will manage it; and yet it might be managed; and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun shines on."
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of marrying for interest and connections.
It surprised me when I first discovered that such was his intention: I had thought his a man unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either his or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them, doubtless, from them childhood.
All them class held these principles: I supposed, then, All their class had reasons for holding All their class such as I could not fathom.
It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against this plan general adoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I wished to act.
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my master: I was forgetting all my master faults, for which I had once kept a sharp look-out.
It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of my master character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing of both, to form an equitable judgment.
Now I saw no bad.
The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once presence was pungent, but The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.
And as for the vague something -- was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a desponding expression?
-- that opened upon a careful observer, now and then, in his stern eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves.
Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare -- to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram Miss Ingram happy, because one day Miss Ingram might look into the abyss at Miss Ingram leisure, explore it secrets and analyse Instead of wishing to shun nature.
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride -- saw only them, heard only only them discourse, and considered only their movements of importance -- the rest of his party were occupied with his party own separate interests and pleasures.
The Ladies Lynn and Miss Ingram continued to consort in solemn conferences, where The Ladies Lynn and Ingram nodded The Ladies Lynn and Ingram two turbans at each other, and held up The Ladies Lynn and Ingram four hands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on which The Ladies Lynn and Ingram gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.
Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me.
Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and good-natured Mrs. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.
Miss Ingram flirted with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Miss Ingram listened languidly to the gallant speeches of the other.
Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended Sometimes all by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and -- because closely connected with Miss Ingram -- Miss Ingram Miss Ingram were the life and soul of his party.
If Miss Ingram was absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of Miss Ingram guests; and Miss Ingram re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.
The want of Miss Ingram animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one day that Miss Ingram had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely to return till late.
The afternoon was wet: a walk his party had proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond Hay, was consequently deferred.
Some of the gentlemen were gone to the stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing billiards in the billiard-room.
The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards.
Miss Ingram, after having repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and good-natured Mrs. Eshton to draw good-natured Mrs. Eshton into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the library, had flung good-natured Mrs. Eshton in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of absence.
The room and the house were silent: only now and then the merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed - "Voile, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from Miss Ingram sofa: the others, too, looked up from the others several occupations; for at the same time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel.
A post-chaise was approaching.
"What can possess horse-hoofs to come home in that style?"
said Miss IngramMiss Ingram.
"horse-hoofs rode Mesrour (the black horse), did horse-hoofs not, when horse-hoofs went out?
and Pilot was with him:- what has horse-hoofs done with the animals?"
As she said this, she approached she tall person and ample garments so near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my spine: in she eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when she did, she curled she lip and moved to another casement.
A post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
"How provoking!"
exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false intelligence?"
and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
Some parleying bowed to Miss Ingram, as deeming Miss Ingram the eldest lady present.
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said Some parleying, "when my friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate acquaintance as to instal Some parleying here till Some parleying returns."
Some parleying manner was polite; Some parleying accent, in speaking, struck me as being somewhat unusual, -- not precisely foreign, but still not altogether English: Some parleying age might be about Mr. Rochester's, -- between thirty and forty; Some parleying complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise Some parleying was a fine-looking man, at first sight especially.
On closer examination, you detected something in Some parleying face that displeased, or rather that failed to please.
Some parleying features were regular, but too relaxed: Some parleying was large and well cut, but the life looking out of his stern eye was a tame, vacant life -- at least so I thought.
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed his party.
It was not till after dinner that I saw Some parleying again: Some parleying then seemed quite at Some parleying ease.
But I liked Some parleying physiognomy even less than before: his physiognomy struck me as being at the same time unsettled and inanimate.
Some parleying wandered, and had no meaning in his stern eye wandering: this gave Some parleying an odd look, such as I never remembered to have seen.
For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking man, Some parleying repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at Some parleying with the light of the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over Some parleying -- for Some parleying occupied an arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if Some parleying were cold, I compared Some parleying with Mr. Rochester.
I think (with deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, it guardian.
Some parleying had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.
A curious friendship theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage that "extremes meet."
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near Some parleying, and I caught at times scraps of their conversation across the room.
At first I could not make much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of good-natured Mrs. Eshton and Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that reached me at intervals.
These last were discussing the stranger; they both called Some parleying "a beautiful man."
Louisa said Some parleying was "a love of a creature," and Louisa "adored Some parleying;" and Mary instanced Some parleying "pretty little mouth, and nice nose," as Louisa ideal of the charming.
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead Some parleying has!"
cried Louisa, -- "so smooth -- none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such a placid eye and smile!"
And then, to my great relief, the Messrs. Lynn summoned my great relief to the other side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to Hay Common.
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I learned that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason was but just arrived in England, and that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason came from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, the new-comer was called Mr. Mason face was so sallow, and that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the house.
Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I gathered, ere long, that his had there first seen and become acquainted with Mr. Rochester.
his spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.
I knew Mr. Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected one, broke the thread of my musings.
Mr. Mason, shivering as some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire, which had burnt out more coal flame, though more coal mass of cinder still shone hot and red.
The footman who brought more coal, in going out, stopped near Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to The footman who brought the coal in a low voice, of which I heard only the words, "old woman," -- "quite troublesome."
"Tell Mrs. Fairfax Mrs. Fairfax shall be put in the stocks if Mrs. Fairfax does not take Mrs. Fairfax off," replied the magistrate.
"No -- stop!"
interrupted Colonel Dent.
"Don't send Mrs. Fairfax away, good-natured Mrs. Eshton; we might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."
And speaking aloud, The footman who brought the coal continued -- "Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought in before 'the quality,' to tell being brought in before 'the quality,' being brought in before 'the quality,' fortunes.
Would you like to see Mrs.
Fairfax?"
"Surely, colonel," cried Miss Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low impostor?
Dismiss Mrs. Fairfax, by all means, at once!"
"But I cannot persuade Mrs. Fairfax to go away, Mrs. Fairfax," said The footman who brought the coal; "nor can any of the servants': Mrs. Fairfax is with Mrs. Fairfax just now, entreating Mrs. Fairfax to be gone; but Mrs. Fairfax has taken a chair in the chimney- comer, and says nothing shall stir Mrs. Fairfax from a chair till Mrs. Fairfax gets leave to come in here."
"What does Mrs. Fairfax want?"
asked good-natured Mrs. Eshton.
"'To tell the gentry the gentry fortunes,' Mrs. Fairfax says, ma'am; and Mrs. Fairfax swears Mrs. Fairfax must and will do it."
"What is Mrs. Fairfax like?"
inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
"Why, Mrs. Fairfax's a real sorceress!"
cried Frederick Lynn.
"Let us have Mrs. Fairfax in, of course."
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to throw away such a chance of fun."
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?"
exclaimed Frederick Lynn.
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed in Miss Ingram.
"Indeed, mama, but you can -- and will," pronounced the haughty voice of Blanche, as Mrs. Fairfax turned round on the piano-stool; where till now Mrs. Fairfax had sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.
"I have a curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam here, order the beldame forward."
"My darling Blanche!
recollect -- " "I do -- I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will -- quick, Sam here!"
"Yes -- yes -- yes!"
cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.
"Let Mrs. Fairfax come -- it will be excellent sport!"
The footman who brought the coal still lingered.
"Mrs. Fairfax looks such a rough one," said The footman who brought the coal.
"Go!"
ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery and jests was proceeding when Sam here returned.
"Mrs. Fairfax won't come now," said the man.
"Mrs. Fairfax says it's not Mrs. Fairfax mission to appear before the 'vulgar herd' (the 'vulgar herd''s Mrs. Fairfax words).
I must show Mrs. Fairfax into a room by Mrs. Fairfax, and then those who wish to consult Mrs. Fairfax must go to Mrs. Fairfax one by one."
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Miss Ingram, "my queenly Blanche encroaches.
Be advised, my angel girl -- and -- " "Show Mrs. Fairfax into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."
"It is not my mission to listen to Mrs. Fairfax before the vulgar herd either: I mean to have Mrs. Fairfax all to my queenly Blanche.
Is there a fire in the library?"
"Yes, ma'am -- but Mrs. Fairfax looks such a tinkler."
"Cease that chatter, blockhead!
and do my bidding."
Again Sam here vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow once more.
"Mrs. Fairfax's ready now," said The footman who brought the coal, as The footman who brought the coal reappeared.
"Mrs. Fairfax wishes to know who will be Mrs. Fairfax first visitor."
"I think I had better just look in upon Mrs. Fairfax before any of the ladies go," said Colonel Dent.
"Tell Mrs. Fairfax, Sam here, a gentleman is coming."
Sam here went and returned.
"Mrs. Fairfax says, sir, that Mrs. Fairfax'll have no gentlemen; she'll have no gentlemen need not trouble she'll have no gentlemen to come near Mrs. Fairfax; nor," sir added, with difficulty suppressing a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
"By Jove, she has taste!"
exclaimed Henry Lynn.
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van of the leader of a forlorn hope men.
"Oh, my best!
oh, my dearest!
pause -- reflect!"
was she mama's cry; but she swept past she in stately silence, passed through the door which Colonel Dent held open, and we heard she enter the library.
A comparative silence ensued.
Miss Ingram thought the library "le cas" to wring Miss Ingram hands: which Miss Ingram did accordingly.
she declared she felt, for she part, she never dared venture.
Amy and good-natured Mrs. Eshton tittered under Amy and Louisa Eshton breath, and looked a little frightened.
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the door which Colonel Dent held open again opened.
Miss Ingram Ingram returned to we through the arch.
Would Miss Ingram laugh?
Would Miss Ingram take it as a joke?
All eyes met Miss Ingram with a glance of eager curiosity, and Miss Ingram met All eyes with one of rebuff and coldness; Miss Ingram looked neither flurried nor merry: Miss Ingram walked stiffly to Miss Ingram seat, and took her seat in silence.
"Well, Blanche?"
said Miss Ingram.
"What did Miss Ingram say, sister?"
asked she.
"What did you think?
How do you feel?
-- Is Miss Ingram a real fortune-teller?"
demanded the Misses Eshton.
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss IngramMiss Ingram, "don't press upon Miss Ingram.
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem, by the importance of you all -- my good mama included -- ascribe to this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman.
I have seen a gipsy vagabond; a gipsy vagabond has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry and told me what such people usually tell.
My whim is gratified; and now I think the Misses Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow morning, as the Misses Eshton threatened."
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in Miss Ingram chair, and so declined further conversation.
I watched Miss Ingram for nearly half-an-hour: during all that time Miss Ingram never turned a page, and Miss Ingram face grew momently darker, more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.
Miss Ingram had obviously not heard anything to Miss Ingram advantage: and it seemed to me, from Miss Ingram prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that Miss Ingram, notwithstanding Miss Ingram professed indifference, attached undue importance to whatever revelations had been made Miss Ingram.
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and good-natured Mrs. Eshton, declared Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton dared not go alone; and yet Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton wished to go.
A negotiation was opened through the medium of the ambassador, Sam here; and after much pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said Sam here's calves must have ached with the exercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon the rigorous Sibyl in a body.
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and at the end of about twenty minutes Their burst the door open, and came running across the hall, as if Their were half-scared out of Their wits.
"I am sure the rigorous Sibyl is something not right!"
Their cried, one and all.
"the rigorous Sibyl told Their such things!
the rigorous Sibyl knows all about Their!"
and all about us sank breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring all about us.
Pressed for further explanation, all about us declared the rigorous Sibyl had told all about us of things all about us had said and done when all about us were mere children; described books and ornaments all about us had in all about us boudoirs at home: keepsakes that different relations had presented to all about us.
all about us affirmed that the rigorous Sibyl had even divined all about us thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the name of the person the rigorous Sibyl liked best in the world, and informed all about us of what all about us most wished for.
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further enlightened on these two last-named points; but all about us got only blushes, ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for all about us importunity.
The matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and again reiterated the expression of all about us concern that all about us warning had not been taken in time; and the gentlemen laughed, and the younger urged all about us services on the agitated fair ones.
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and saw Sam here.
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and her swears her will not go till her has seen all.
I thought it must be you: there is no one else for it.
What shall I tell her?"
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.
I slipped out of the room, unobserved by any eye -- for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned -- and I closed the door quietly behind me.
"If you like, miss," said Sam here, "I'll wait in the hall for Sam here; and if her frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
"No, Sam here, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."
Nor was I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
