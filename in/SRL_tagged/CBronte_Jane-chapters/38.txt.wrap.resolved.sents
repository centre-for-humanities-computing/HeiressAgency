Reader, I married Reader.
A quiet wedding we had: Reader and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present.
When we got back from church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John cleaning the knives, and I said - "Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."
The housekeeper and Mr. Rochester husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment.
Mary did look up, and Mary did stare at Mary: the ladle with which Mary was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time the knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only - "Have you, Miss?
Well, for sure!"
A short time after Miss pursued -- "I seed you go out with the master, but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and Miss basted away.
John, when I turned to John, was grinning from ear to ear.
"I telled Mary how it would be," John said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John was an old servant, and had known the master when John was the cadet of the house, therefore, John often gave John John Christian name) -- "I knew what Mr. Edward would do; and I was certain Mr. Edward would not wait long neither: and Mr. Edward's done right, for aught I know.
I wish you joy, Miss!"
and Mr. Edward politely pulled Mr. Edward forelock.
"Thank you, John.
Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."
I put into Mr. Edward hand a five-pound note.
Without waiting to hear more, I left the kitchen.
In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I caught the words - "She'll happen do better for Mr. Edward nor ony o't' grand ladies."
And again, "If She ben't one o' th' handsomest, She's noan faal and varry good-natured; and i' his een She's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.
Diana and Mary approved the step unreservedly.
Diana announced that Diana would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then Diana would come and see me.
"Diana had better not wait till then, Diana," said Mr. Rochester, when I read Diana letter to him; "if Diana does, Diana will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your grave or mine."
How St. John received the news, I don't know: St. John never answered the letter in which I communicated the news: yet six months after St. John wrote to me, without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my marriage.
St. John was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.
St. John has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since: St. John hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?
I had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see little Adele at the school where St. John had placed little Adele.
little Adele frantic joy at beholding me again moved me much.
little Adele looked pale and thin: little Adele said little Adele was not happy.
I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, the establishment course of study too severe for a child of little Adele age: I took little Adele home with me.
I meant to become little Adele governess once more, but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another -- my husband needed them all.
So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting little Adele often, and bringing little Adele home sometimes.
I took care little Adele should never want for anything that could contribute to little Adele comfort: little Adele soon settled in little Adele new abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in little Adele studies.
As little Adele grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure little Adele French defects; and when little Adele left school, I found in little Adele a pleasing and obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.
By little Adele grateful attention to me and mine, little Adele has long since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer little Adele.
My tale draws to it close: one word respecting my experience of married life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
I have now been married ten years.
I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth.
I hold myself supremely blest -- blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's life as fully is my husband is mine.
No woman was ever nearer to No woman mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of my husband bone and flesh of my husband flesh.
I know no weariness of my Edward's society: my Edward's society knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in we separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.
To be together is for we to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.
we talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking.
All my confidence is bestowed on him, all him confidence is devoted to myself; we are precisely suited in character -- perfect concord is the result.
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps it was that circumstance that drew our so very near -- that knit our so very close: for I was then Mr. Rochester vision, as I am still Mr. Rochester right hand.
Literally, I was (what Mr. Rochester often called me) the apple of Mr. Rochester eye.
Mr. Rochester saw nature -- Mr. Rochester saw books through myself; and never did I weary of gazing for Mr. Rochester behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam -- of the landscape before us; of the weather round us -- and impressing by sound on Mr. Rochester ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye.
Never did I weary of reading to Mr. Rochester; never did I weary of conducting Mr. Rochester where Mr. Rochester wished to go: of doing for Mr. Rochester what Mr. Rochester wished to be done.
And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad -- because Mr. Rochester claimed my services without painful shame or damping humiliation.
Mr. Rochester loved me so truly, that Mr. Rochester knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: Mr. Rochester felt I loved Mr. Rochester so fondly, that to yield my attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to Mr. Rochester dictation, Mr. Rochester came and bent over me, and said -- "Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your neck?"
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
I had.
Mr. Rochester informed me then, that for some time Mr. Rochester had fancied the obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now Mr. Rochester was sure of one eye.
Mr. Rochester and I went up to London.
Mr. Rochester had the advice of an eminent oculist; and Mr. Rochester eventually recovered the sight of one eye.
Mr. Rochester cannot now see very distinctly: Mr. Rochester cannot read or write much; but Mr. Rochester can find Mr. Rochester way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to Mr. Rochester -- the earth no longer a void.
When Mr. Rochester first-born was put into Mr. Rochester arms, Mr. Rochester could see that the boy had inherited Mr. Rochester own eyes, as they once were -- large, brilliant, and black.
On that occasion, Mr. Rochester again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those My Edward and I most love are happy likewise.
Diana and Mary Rivers are Diana and Mary Rivers married: alternately, once every year, Diana and Mary Rivers come to see My Edward and I, and My Edward and I go to see Diana and Mary Rivers.
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man.
Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of Mary brother's, and, from Diana's husband attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.
Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton wives, and are loved by Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton.
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.
he entered on the path he had marked for he; he pursues it still.
A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for he race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.
he may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but he is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards he pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon.
he is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he says -- "Whosoever will come after he, let he deny he, and take up he cross and follow me."
he is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth -- who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
St. John is unmarried: St. John never will marry now.
St. John has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: St. John glorious sun hastens to its setting.
The last letter I received from St. John drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: St. John anticipated St. John sure reward, St. John incorruptible crown.
I know that a stranger's hand will write to he next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of the good and faithful servant Lord.
And why weep for this?
No fear of death will darken St. John last hour: St. John mind will be unclouded, St. John heart will be undaunted, St. John hope will be sure, St. John faith steadfast.
St. John own words are a pledge of this - "My Master," St. John says, "has forewarned me.
Daily St. John announces more distinctly, -- 'Surely I come quickly!'
and hourly I more eagerly respond, -- 'Amen; even so come, St.
John!'"
