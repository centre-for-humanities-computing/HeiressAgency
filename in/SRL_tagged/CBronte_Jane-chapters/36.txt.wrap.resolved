The daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein I should wish to leave my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe during a brief absence. Meantime, I heard St. John quit St. John room. St. John stopped at my door: I feared St. John would knock -- no, but a slip of paper was passed under my door. I took a slip of paper up. a slip of paper bore these words - "You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the angel's crown. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak. I shall pray for you hourly. -- Yours, ST. St. John." "the spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when once that will is distinctly known to St. John. At any rate, it shall be strong enough to search -- inquire -- to grope an outlet from this cloud of doubt, and find the open day of certainty." It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain beat fast on my casement. I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass out. Looking through the window, I saw St. John traverse the garden. St. John took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross -- there St. John would meet the coach. "In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross. I too have some to see and ask after in England, before I depart for ever." It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I had experienced: for I could recall it, with all it unspeakable strangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in ME -- not in the external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression -- a delusion? I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell and loosed the soul's cell bands -- it had wakened it out of it sleep, whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body. "Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters have proved of no avail -- personal inquiry shall replace Letters." At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey, and should be absent at least four days. "Alone, Jane?" Diana and Mary asked. "Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some time been uneasy." Diana and Mary might have said, as I have no doubt Diana and Mary thought, that Diana and Mary had believed me to be without any friends save Diana and Mary: for, indeed, I had often said so; but, with Diana and Mary true natural delicacy, Diana and Mary abstained from comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to travel. I looked very pale, Diana observed. I replied, that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate. It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no inquiries -- no surmises. Having once explained to Diana and Mary that I could not now be explicit about my plans, Diana and Mary kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silence with which I pursued Diana and Mary, according to me the privilege of free action I should under similar circumstances have accorded Diana and Mary. I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the silence of those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great distance. it was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot -- how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! it stopped as I beckoned. I entered -- not now obliged to part with my whole fortune as the price of it accommodation. Once more on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home. It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure we were near my bourne. "How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler. "Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields." "My journey is closed," I thought to myself. I got out of the coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield, gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for the ostler's charge; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The Rochester Arms." My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very lands. My heart fell again: the thought struck it:- "Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you know: and then, if "Your master himself is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten, who besides "Your master himself is there? "Your master himself lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do with "Your master himself: you dare not speak to "Your master himself or seek "Your master himself presence. You have lost your labour -- you had better go no farther," urged the monitor. "Ask information of the people at the inn; the people can give you all you seek: the people can solve your doubts at once. Go up to that man, and inquire if Mr. Rochester be at home." The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force Mr. Rochester to act on The suggestion. I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To prolong doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the ray of Mr. Rochester star. There was the stile before Mr. Rochester -- the very fields through which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes! How I looked forward to catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what feelings I welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between them! At last the well-known woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened. Another field crossed -- a lane threaded -- and there were the courtyard walls -- the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid. "My first view of the rookery shall be in front," I determined, "where the rookery bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out my master's very window: perhaps my master will be standing at my master's very window -- my master rises early: perhaps my master is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in front. Could I but see my master! -- but a moment! Surely, in that case, I should not be so mad as to run to my master? I cannot tell -- I am not certain. And if I did -- what then? God bless my master! What then? Who would be hurt by my once more tasting the life my master glance can give me? I rave: perhaps at this moment my master is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south." I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard -- turned its angle: there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls. From behind one pillar I could peep round quietly at the full front of the mansion. I advanced my head with precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long front -- all from this sheltered station were at my command. The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey. I wonder what crows thought. crows must have considered I was very careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it. "What affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded; "what stupid regardlessness now?" Hear an illustration, reader. A lover finds A lover mistress asleep on a mossy bank; A lover wishes to catch a glimpse of his mistress fair face without waking his mistress. A lover steals softly over the grass, careful to make no sound; A lover pauses -- fancying his mistress has stirred: A lover withdraws: not for worlds would A lover be seen. All is still: A lover again advances: A lover bends above his mistress; a light veil rests on his mistress features: A lover lifts a light veil, bends lower; now A lover eyes anticipate the vision of beauty -- warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried was their first glance! But how their fix! How A lover starts! How A lover suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form A lover dared not, a moment since, touch with A lover finger! How A lover calls aloud a name, and drops A lover burden, and gazes on a name wildly! A lover thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because A lover no longer fears to waken by any sound A lover can utter -- by any movement A lover can make. A lover thought A lover love slept sweetly: A lover finds his love is stone dead. I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened ruin. No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed! -- to peep up at chamber lattices, fearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for doors opening -- to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk! The lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void. The front was, as I had once seen The front in a dream, but a well-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof, no battlements, no chimneys -- all had crashed in. And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome wild. No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall under the ray of her star had fallen -- by conflagration: but how kindled? What story belonged to this disaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as property? If so, whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it -- not even dumb sign, mute token. In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late occurrence. Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters. And oh! where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck? In what land? Under what auspices? my eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower near the gates, and I asked, "Is my eye with Damer de Rochester, sharing the shelter of my eye narrow marble house?" Some answer must be had to these questions. I could find it nowhere but at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself brought my breakfast into the parlour. I requested The host himself to shut the door and sit down: I had some questions to ask The host himself. But when The host himself complied, I scarcely knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers. And yet the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for a tale of misery. The host himself was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man. "You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last. "Yes, ma'am; I lived there once." "Did you?" Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me. "I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," the late Mr. Rochester's butler added. The late! I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been trying to evade. "The late!" I gasped. "Is the late Mr. Rochester's butler dead?" "I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," the late Mr. Rochester's butler explained. I breathed again: my blood resumed its flow. Fully assured by these words that Mr. Edward him -- was at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman." Gladdening words! It seemed I could hear all that was to come -- whatever the disclosures might be -- with comparative tranquillity. Since he was not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the Antipodes. "Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the direct question as to where he really was. "No, ma'am -- oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last autumn, -- Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: Thornfield Hall was burnt down just about harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved. The fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame. It was a terrible spectacle: I witnessed It myself." "At dead of night!" I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality at Thornfield. "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded. "They guessed, ma'am: They guessed. Indeed, I should say it was ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware," myself continued, edging myself chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there was a lady -- a -- a lunatic, kept in the house?" "I have heard something of it." "She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some years was not absolutely certain of She existence. No one saw She: No one only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall under the ray of her star; and who or what She was it was difficult to conjecture. No one said Mr. Edward had brought She from abroad, and some believed She had been Mr. Edward . But a queer thing happened a year since -- a very queer thing." I feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall Mr. Edward to the main fact. "And this lady?" "This lady, ma'am," Mr. Edward answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest way. There was a young lady, a governess at the Hall under the ray of her star, that Mr. Rochester fell in -- " "But The fire," I suggested. "I'm coming to that, ma'am -- that Mr. Rochester fell in with. The servants say The servants never saw anybody so much in love as Mr. Edward was: Mr. Edward was after Mr. Rochester's wife continually. The servants used to watch Mr. Edward -- servants will, you know, ma'am -- and Mr. Edward set store on Mr. Rochester's wife past everything: for all, nobody but Mr. Edward thought Mr. Rochester's wife so very handsome. Mr. Rochester's wife was a little small thing, The servants say, almost like a child. I never saw Mr. Rochester's wife Mr. Edward; but I've heard Leah, the house-maid, tell of Mr. Rochester's wife. Mr. Rochester's wife liked Mr. Rochester's wife well enough. Mr. Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen of Mr. Rochester age fall in love with girls, girls are often like as if girls were bewitched. Well, Mr. Rochester would marry Mr. Rochester's wife." "You shall tell me this part of my own story another time," I said; "but now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about The fire. Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?" "You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was Mr. Rochester's wife, and nobody but Mr. Rochester's wife, that set it going. Mr. Rochester's wife had a woman to take care of Mr. Rochester's wife called Mrs. Poole -- an able woman in Mr. Rochester's wife line, and very trustworthy, but for one fault -- a fault common to a deal of a woman to take care of her called Mrs. Poole -- an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy nurses and matrons -- Mr. Rochester's wife KEPT A PRIVATE BOTTLE OF GIN BY Mr. Rochester's wife, and now and then took a drop over-much. It is excusable, for Mr. Rochester's wife had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous; for when Mr. Rochester's wife was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of Mr. Rochester's wife pocket, let Mr. Rochester's wife out of Mr. Rochester's wife chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into Mr. Rochester's wife head. They say Mr. Rochester's wife had nearly burnt Mr. Rochester's wife husband in her husband bed once: but I don't know about that. However, on this night, Mr. Rochester's wife set fire first to the hangings of the room next Mr. Rochester's wife own, and then Mr. Rochester's wife got down to a lower storey, and made Mr. Rochester's wife way to the chamber that had been the governess's -- (Mr. Rochester's wife was like as if Mr. Rochester's wife knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at Mr. Rochester's wife) -- and Mr. Rochester's wife kindled his bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in his bed, fortunately. the governess had run away two months before; and for Mr. Rochester sought the governess as if the governess had been the most precious thing the governess had in the world, the governess never could hear a word of the governess; and the governess grew savage -- quite savage on the governess disappointment: the governess never was a wild man, but the governess got dangerous after the governess lost the governess. the governess would be alone, too. the governess sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to the governess friends at a distance; but the governess did it handsomely, for the governess settled an annuity on the governess for life: and the governess deserved it -- the governess was a very good woman. Miss Adele, a ward the governess had, was put to school. the governess broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut the governess up like a hermit at the Hall under the ray of her star." "What! did the governess not leave England?" "Leave England? Bless you, no! the governess would not cross the door-stones of the house, except at night, when the governess walked just like a ghost about the grounds and in the orchard as if the governess had lost the governess senses -- which it is my opinion the governess had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than the governess was before that midge of a governess crossed the governess, you never saw, ma'am. the governess was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and the governess was not so very handsome; but the governess had a courage and a will of the governess own, if ever man had. I knew the governess from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before Miss Eyre came to Thornfield Hall." "Then Mr. Rochester was at home when The fire broke out?" "Yes, indeed was Mr. Rochester; and Mr. Rochester went up to the attics when all was burning above and below, and got The servants out of The servants beds and helped The servants down Mr. Rochester, and went back to get Mr. Rochester mad wife out of his mad wife cell. And then The servants called out to Mr. Rochester that his mad wife was on the roof, where his mad wife was standing, waving his mad wife arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till The servants could hear his mad wife a mile off: I saw his mad wife and heard his mad wife with my own eyes. his mad wife was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see long black hair streaming against the flames as his mad wife stood. I witnessed, and several more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we heard Mr. Rochester call 'Bertha!' we saw Mr. Rochester approach his mad wife; and then, ma'am, his mad wife yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute his mad wife lay smashed on the pavement." "Dead?" "Dead! Ay, dead as the stones on which his mad wife brains and blood were scattered." "Good God!" "You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!" Mr. Rochester shuddered. "And afterwards?" I urged. "Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are only some bits of walls standing now." "Were any other lives lost?" "No -- perhaps it would have been better if there had." "What do you mean?" "Poor Mr. Edward!" Mr. Rochester ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it! Some say it was a just judgment on Mr. Rochester for keeping Mr. Rochester first marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while Mr. Rochester had one living: but I pity Mr. Rochester, for my part." "You said Mr. Rochester was alive?" I exclaimed. "Yes, yes: Mr. Rochester is alive; but many think Mr. Rochester had better Mr. Rochester dead." "Why? How?" My blood was again running cold. "Where is Mr. Rochester?" I demanded. "Is Mr. Rochester in England?" "Ay -- ay -- Mr. Rochester's in England; Mr. Rochester can't get out of England, I fancy -- Mr. Rochester's a fixture now." What agony was this! And Mr. Rochester seemed resolved to protract it. "Mr. Rochester is stone-blind," Mr. Rochester said at last. "Yes, Mr. Rochester is stone-blind, is Mr. Edward." I had dreaded worse. I had dreaded Mr. Rochester was mad. I summoned strength to ask what had caused this calamity. "It was all Mr. Rochester own courage, and a body may say, Mr. Rochester kindness, in a way, ma'am: Mr. Rochester wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before Mr. Rochester. As Mr. Rochester came down the great staircase at last, after Mr. Rochester had flung Mr. Rochester from the battlements, there was a great crash -- all fell. Mr. Rochester was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect Mr. Rochester partly; but one eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to amputate one eye directly. one eye inflamed: Mr. Rochester lost the sight of that also. Mr. Rochester is now helpless, indeed -- blind and a cripple." "Where is Mr. Rochester? Where does Mr. Rochester now live?" "At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm Mr. Rochester has, about thirty miles off: quite a desolate spot." "Who is with Mr. Rochester?" "Old John and his mad wife: Mr. Rochester would have none else. Mr. Rochester is quite broken down, "Old John and his wife say." "Have you any sort of conveyance?" "We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise." "Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and your post-boy twice the hire you usually demand."
