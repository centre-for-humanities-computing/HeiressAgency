 It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe arraying  Joe in Joe Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss Havisham's. However, as  Joe thought Joe court-suit necessary to the occasion, his court-suit was not for me to tell  Joe that Joe looked far better in Joe working-dress; the rather, because I knew  Joe made Joe so dreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that  it was for me Joe pulled up Joe shirt-collar so very high behind, that his shirt-collar made  the hair on the crown of Joe head stand up like a tuft of feathers. At breakfast-time my sister declared my sister intention of going to town with us,  and being left at Uncle Pumblechook's and called for "when us had done with us  fine ladies"—a way of putting the case, from which Joe appeared inclined to  augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the day, and Joe inscribed in chalk  upon the door (as it was Joe custom to do on the very rare occasions when Joe  was not at work) the monosyllable HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow  supposed to be flying in the direction Joe had taken. us walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver bonnet, and  carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited Straw, a pair of  pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it was a fine bright day. I am  not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or  ostentatiously; but I rather think these articles were displayed as articles of  property,—much as Cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the Rampage might  exhibit my sister wealth in a pageant or procession. When us came to Pumblechook's, my sister bounced in and left us. As it was  almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham's house. Estella  opened the gate as usual, and, the moment Estella   appeared, Joe took Joe hat off  and stood weighing his hat by the brim in both Joe hands; as if Joe had some urgent  reason in Joe mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce. Estella   took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew so well.  I followed next to Estella  , and Joe came last. When I looked back at Joe in the  long passage, Joe was still weighing his hat with the greatest care, and was  coming after us in long strides on the tips of Joe toes. Estella   told me us were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff and  conducted Joe into Miss Havisham's presence. Estella   was seated at Estella    dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately. "Oh!" said Estella   to Joe. "You are the husband of the sister of Joe?" I could hardly have imagined Joe Joe looking so unlike Joe or so like  some extraordinary bird; standing as Joe did speechless, with Joe tuft of  feathers ruffled, and Joe mouth open as if Joe wanted a worm. "You are the husband," repeated Miss Havisham, "of the sister of this boy?" It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in  addressing Joe instead of Miss Havisham. "Which I meantersay, Pip," Joe now observed in a manner that was at once  expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great politeness,  "as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time what you might call  (if you was anyways inclined) a single man." "Well!" said Miss Havisham. "And you have reared Joe, with the intention of  taking Joe for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?" "You know, Pip," replied Joe, "as you and me were ever friends, and it were  looked for'ard to betwixt us, as being calc'lated to lead to larks. Not but  what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the business,—such as the business,—such being  open to black and sut, or such-like,—not but what they would have been  attended to, don't you see?" "Has Joe," said Miss Havisham, "ever made any objection? Does Joe like the  trade?" "Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip," returned Joe, strengthening Joe  former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, "that it were the  wish of your own hart." (I saw the idea suddenly break upon Joe that Joe would  adapt Joe epitaph to the occasion, before Joe went on to say) "And there weren't  no objection on your part, and Pip your part were the great wish of your hart!" It was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make Joe sensible that Joe ought to  speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures to Joe to do The, the  more confidential, argumentative, and polite, Joe persisted in being to Me. "Have you brought Joe indentures with Me?" asked Miss Havisham. "Well, Pip, you know," replied Joe, as if that were a little unreasonable, "you  yourself see me put 'em in Me 'at, and therefore you know as they are here."  With which Joe took they out, and gave they, not to Miss Havisham, but to Me. I  am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good fellow,—I know I was ashamed of  him,—when I saw that Estella stood at the back of Miss Havisham's chair, and  that Estella eyes laughed mischievously. I took his indentures out of his hand and  gave Estella stood at the back of Miss Havisham's chair, and  that her eyes laughed mischievously to Miss Havisham. "You expected," said Miss Havisham, as Miss Havisham looked Estella stood at the back of Miss Havisham's chair, and  that her eyes laughed mischievously over, "no premium with  the boy?" "Joe!" I remonstrated, for the boy made no reply at all. "Why don't you answer—" "Pip," returned Joe, cutting me short as if Joe were hurt, "which I meantersay  that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me, and which  you know the answer to be full well No. You know it to be No, Pip, and  wherefore should I say it?" Miss Havisham Miss Havisham glanced at Miss Havisham as if Miss Havisham understood what Miss Havisham really was better  than I had thought possible, seeing what Miss Havisham was there; and took up a little bag  from the table beside Miss Havisham. "Pip has earned a premium here," Miss Havisham said, "and here Pip is. There are  five-and-twenty guineas in a little bag  . Give Pip to your master, Pip." As if Miss Havisham were absolutely out of Miss Havisham mind with the wonder awakened in Miss Havisham by Miss Havisham  strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass, persisted in  addressing me. "This is wery liberal on your part, Pip," said Joe, "and it is as such received  and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near, nor nowheres. And  now, old chap," said Joe, conveying to me a sensation, first of burning and  then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar expression were applied to  Miss Havisham,—"and now, old chap, may we do we duty! May you and me do our duty, both on we, by one and another, and by both which your liberal  present—have-conweyed—to be—for the satisfaction of mind-of—both as  never—" here Joe showed that Joe felt Joe had fallen into frightful  difficulties, until Joe triumphantly rescued Joe with the words, "and from  Joe far be it!" These words had such a round and convincing sound for Joe  that Joe said These words twice. "Good by, Pip!" said Miss Havisham. "Let These words out, Estella." "Am I to come again, Miss HavishamMiss Havisham?" I asked. "No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!" Thus calling Joe back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe in a  distinct emphatic voice, "The boy has been a good boy here, and that is Joe  reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no other and no more." How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I know  that when Joe did get out Joe was steadily proceeding up stairs instead of coming  down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went after Joe and laid hold of  Joe. In another minute we were outside the gate, and the gate was locked, and Estella  was gone. When we stood in the daylight alone again, Joe backed up against a  wall, and said to me, "Astonishing!" And there Joe remained so long saying,  "Astonishing" at intervals, so often, that I began to think Joe senses were  never coming back. At length Joe prolonged Joe remark into "Pip, I do assure you  this is as-TON-ishing!" and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to  walk away. I have reason to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the encounter  Joe's intellects had passed through, and that on we way to Pumblechook's Joe invented a  subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in what took place in Mr.  Pumblechook's parlor: where, on our presenting our, my sister sat in  conference with that detested seedsman. "Well?" cried my sister, addressing our both at once. "And what's happened to  you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this, I am  sure I do!" "Miss Havisham," said Joe, with a fixed look at Joe, like an effort of  remembrance, "made it wery partick'ler that our should give my sister—were her—  compliments or respects, Pip?" "Compliments," I said. "Which that were my own belief," answered Joe; "her compliments to Mrs. J.  Gargery—" "Much good they'll do me!" observed my sister; but rather gratified too. "And wishing," pursued Joe, with another fixed look at Joe, like another effort  of remembrance, "that the state of Miss Havisham's elth were sitch as would  have—allowed, were it, Pip?" "Of my sister having the pleasure," I added. "Of ladies' company," said Joe. And drew a long breath. "Well!" cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook. "my sister might  have had the politeness to send that message at first, but that message's better late  than never. And what did my sister give young Rantipole here?" "my sister giv' him," said Joe, "nothing." Joe Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on. "What Joe giv'," said Joe, "Joe giv' to Joe friends. 'And by his friends,' were  Joe explanation, 'I mean into the hands of Joe sister Mrs. J. Gargery.' Them  were her words; 'Mrs. J. Gargery.' Mrs. J. Gargery mayn't have know'd," added Joe, with an  appearance of reflection, "whether it were Joe, or Jorge." my sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden  arm-chair, and nodded at my sister and at the fire, as if his had known all about it  beforehand. "And how much have you got?" asked my sister, laughing. Positively laughing! "What would present company say to ten pound?" demanded Joe. "present company'd say," returned my sister, curtly, "pretty well. Not too much, but  pretty well." "It's more than that, then," said Joe. That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as Joe rubbed  the arms of Joe chair, "It's more than that, Mum." "Why, you don't mean to say—" began my sister. "Yes I do, Mum," said Pumblechook; "but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good in Mum!  Go on!" "What would present company say," proceeded Joe, "to twenty pound?" "Handsome would be the word," returned my sister. "Well, then," said Joe, "It's more than twenty pound." That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a patronizing  laugh, "It's more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow Mum up, Joseph!" "Then to make an end of it," said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my  sister; "it's five-and-twenty pound." "It's five-and-twenty pound, Mum," echoed that basest of swindlers,  Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with Mum; "and it's no more than your merits  (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy of the money!" If the villain had stopped here, the villain case would have been sufficiently awful,  but the villain blackened the villain guilt by proceeding to take me into custody, with a right  of patronage that left all the villain former criminality far behind. "Now you see, Joseph and wife," said Pumblechook, as Pumblechook took me by the arm  above the elbow, "I am one of Joseph and wife that always go right through with what  Joseph and wife've begun. the villain must be bound, out of hand. That's my way. Bound out of  hand." "Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook," said my sister (grasping the money),  "we're deeply beholden to you." "Never mind me, Mum," returned that diabolical cornchandler. "A pleasure's a  pleasure all the world over. But the villain, you know; we must have the villain bound. I  said I'd see to it—to tell you the truth." The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at once went  over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial presence. I say we  went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook, exactly as if I had that  moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed, it was the general impression  in Court that I had been taken red-handed; for, as Pumblechook shoved me before  Pumblechook through the crowd, I heard some people say, "What's Pumblechook done?" and others,  "Pumblechook's a young 'un, too, but looks bad, don't Pumblechook?" One person of mild and  benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a  malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and  entitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL. the Town Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in the Town Hall than a  church,—and with people hanging over the pews looking on,—and with mighty  Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with folded arms,  or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading the  newspapers,—and with some shining black portraits on the walls, which my  unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and sticking-plaster.  Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested, and I was  "bound"; Pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on we  way to the scaffold, to have those little preliminaries disposed of. When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put into  great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured, and who were  much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me, we  went back to Pumblechook's. And there my sister became so excited by the  twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve my sister but we must have a dinner out  of that windfall at the Blue Boar, and that Pumblechook must go over in Pumblechook  chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle. It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, It  inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole company,  that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it worse, they all  asked me from time to time,—in short, whenever they all   had nothing else to  do,—why I didn't enjoy me? And what could I possibly do then, but say I  was enjoying myself,—when I wasn't! However, they all   were grown up and had they all   own way, and they all   made the most of  it. Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent contriver of the  whole occasion, actually took the top of the table; and, when Pumblechook addressed they all    on the subject of my being bound, and had fiendishly congratulated they all   on my  being liable to imprisonment if I played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept  late hours or bad company, or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable, Pumblechook placed me standing  on a chair beside Pumblechook to illustrate Pumblechook remarks. My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That My only other remembrances of the great festival wouldn't let me  go to sleep, but whenever My only other remembrances of the great festival saw me dropping off, woke me up and told me to  enjoy Pumblechook. That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins's  ode, and threw Mr. Wopsle bloodstained sword in thunder down, with such effect, that a  waiter came in and said, "The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments,  and it wasn't the Tumblers' Arms." That, they were all in excellent spirits on  the road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting  with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads  that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about  everybody's private affairs) that Mr. Wopsle was the man with Mr. Wopsle white locks flowing,  and that Mr. Wopsle was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going. Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly  wretched, and had a strong conviction on Mr. Wopsle that I should never like Joe's  trade. I had liked Joe's  trade once, but once was not now.
