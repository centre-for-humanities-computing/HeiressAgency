 As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to notice    effect upon myself and those around myself.   influence on my own  character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible, but I knew very  well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness  respecting my behavior to Joe. My conscience was not by any means comfortable  about Biddy. When I woke up in the night,—like Camilla,—I used to think,  with a weariness on my spirits, that I should have been happier and better if I  had never seen Miss Havisham's face, and had risen to manhood content to be  partners with Joe in the honest old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I  sat alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the  forge fire and the kitchen fire at home. Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind,  that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its  production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations, and yet had  had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my satisfaction that I should  have done much better. Now, concerning the influence of my position on others,  I was in no such difficulty, and so I perceived—though dimly enough  perhaps—that it was not beneficial to anybody, and, above all, that it was  not beneficial to Herbert. My lavish habits led Herbert easy nature into expenses  that Herbert could not afford, corrupted the simplicity of Herbert life, and disturbed  Herbert peace with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having  unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor arts those other branches of the Pocket family  practised; because such littlenesses were such littlenesses natural bent, and would have  been evoked by anybody else, if I had left such littlenesses slumbering. But Herbert's was a  very different case, and a  very different case often caused me a twinge to think that I had done  Herbert evil service in crowding Herbert sparely furnished chambers with incongruous  upholstery work, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at Herbert disposal. So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began to  contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert must begin too,  so Herbert soon followed. At Startop's suggestion, we put we down for  election into a club called The Finches of the Grove: the object of which  institution I have never divined, if it were not that the members should dine  expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel among the members as much as possible  after dinner, and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that  these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and  I understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the  society: which ran "Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good feeling ever  reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove." the Finches of the Grove spent the Finches of the Grove money foolishly (the Hotel the Finches of the Grove dined at was in Covent  Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of joining the Grove  was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about town in a cab of Bentley Drummle own,  and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners.  Occasionally, Bentley Drummle shot Bentley Drummle out of Bentley Drummle equipage headforemost over the apron;  and I saw Bentley Drummle on one occasion deliver Bentley Drummle at the door of the Grove in this  unintentional way—like coals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a  Finch, and could not be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I  came of age. In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken Herbert's  expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make no such proposal to  Herbert. So Herbert got into difficulties in every direction, and continued to look  about Herbert. When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company, I  noticed that Herbert looked about Herbert with a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that  Herbert began to look about Herbert more hopefully about mid-day; that Herbert drooped when  Herbert came into dinner; that Herbert seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather  clearly, after dinner; that Herbert all but realized Capital towards midnight; and  that at about two o'clock in the morning, Herbert became so deeply despondent again  as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general purpose of  compelling buffaloes to make Herbert fortune. I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at Hammersmith  I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert would often come to  Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those seasons Herbert father would  occasionally have some passing perception that the opening Herbert was looking for,  had not appeared yet. But in the general tumbling up of the family, Herbert  tumbling out in life somewhere, was a thing to transact his   somehow. In the  meantime Herbert grew grayer, and tried oftener to lift Herbert out of Herbert  perplexities by the hair. While Herbert tripped up the family with Herbert  footstool, read Herbert book of dignities, lost Herbert pocket-handkerchief, told us  about Herbert grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting her grandpapa  into bed whenever her grandpapa attracted Herbert notice. As I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing my way  before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the  description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard's Inn. our spent as much money as our could, and got as little for it as people could  make up people minds to give our. our were always more or less miserable, and most  of our acquaintance were in the same condition. There was a gay fiction among  our that our were constantly enjoying our, and a skeleton truth that our  never did. To the best of my belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather  common one. Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look about  Herbert. I often paid Herbert a visit in the dark back-room in which Herbert consorted with  an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an almanac, a desk and stool,  and a ruler; and I do not remember that I ever saw Herbert do anything else but  look about Herbert. If we all did what we all undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbertdid, we all might live in a Republic of the Virtues. Herbert had nothing else to do,  poor fellow, except at a certain hour of every afternoon to "go to  Lloyd's"—in observance of a ceremony of seeing Herbert principal, I think. Herbert  never did anything else in connection with Lloyd's that I could find out,  except come back again. When Herbert felt Herbert case unusually serious, and that Herbert  positively must find an opening, Herbert would go on 'Change at a busy time, and  walk in and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled  magnates. "For," says Herbert to Herbert, coming home to dinner on one of those  special occasions, "I find the truth to be, Handel, that an opening won't come  to one, but one must go to it,—so I have been." If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated one  another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond expression at  that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight of the Avenger's  livery; which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than  at any other time in the four-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into  debt, breakfast became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion  at breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, "not unwholly  unconnected," as my local paper might put it, "with jewelery," I went so far as  to seize the Avenger's   by his blue collar and shake his off his feet,—so that  his was actually in the air, like a booted Cupid,—for presuming to suppose  that we wanted a roll. At certain times—meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our  humor—I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,— "My dear Herbert, our are getting on badly." "My dear Handel," Herbert would say to My dear Handel, in all sincerity, "if you will  believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence." "Then, Herbert," I would respond, "let our look into our affairs." our always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this  purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to confront the  thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And I know Herbertthought so too. our ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of something  similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might be fortified for  the occasion, and our might come well up to the mark. Dinner over, our produced a  bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and a goodly show of writing and  blotting paper. For there was something very comfortable in having plenty of  stationery. I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of a sheet of paper, in a neat  hand, the heading, "Memorandum of Pip's debts"; with Barnard's Inn and the date  very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet of paper, and write  across a sheet of paper with similar formalities, "Memorandum of Pip's debts." Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at Herbert side, which had  been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half burnt in lighting  candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and otherwise damaged. The  sound of our pens going refreshed our exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes  found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and  actually paying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things  seemed about equal. When our had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how Herbert got on? Herbertprobably would have been scratching Herbert head in a most rueful manner at the  sight of Herbert accumulating figures. "They are mounting up, My dear Handel," Herbert would say; "upon my life, They are  mounting up." "Be firm, Herbert," I would retort, plying my own pen with great assiduity.  "Look the thing in the face. Look into our affairs. Stare They out of  countenance." "So I would, My dear Handel, only they are staring me out of countenance." However, my determined manner would have my determined manner effect, and Herbert would fall to  work again. After a time Herbert would give up once more, on the plea that Herbert had  not got Cobbs's bill, or Lobbs's, or Nobbs's, as the case might be. "Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it down." "What a fellow of resource you are!" my friend would reply, with admiration.  "Really your business powers are very remarkable." I thought so too. I established with my friend, on these occasions, the reputation  of a first-rate man of business,—prompt, decisive, energetic, clear,  cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities down upon my list, I  compared each with the bill, and ticked the bill off. My self-approval when I ticked  an entry was quite a luxurious sensation. When I had no more ticks to make, I  folded all my bills up uniformly, docketed each on the back, and tied the whole  into a symmetrical bundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said  he had not my administrative genius), and felt that I had brought he affairs  into a focus for he. My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called "leaving a  Margin." For example; supposing Herbert's debts to be one hundred and  sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, "Leave a margin, and put Herbert's debts  down at two hundred." Or, supposing my own to be four times as much, I would  leave a margin, and put Herbert's debts down at seven hundred. I had the highest opinion  of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound to acknowledge that on  looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive device. For, we always ran  into new debt immediately, to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in  the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another  margin. But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these examinations  of we that gave me, for the time, an admirable opinion of myself.  Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert's compliments, I would sit with  Herbert symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before myself among the stationary,  and feel like a Bank of some sort, rather than a private individual. we shut we outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might not be  interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when we heard a  letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on the ground. "It's  for you, Handel," said Herbert, going out and coming back with it, "and I hope  there is nothing the matter." This was in allusion to This heavy black seal and  border. a  letter was signed Trabb & Co., and Trabb & Co. contents were simply, that I was an  honored sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J. Gargery had  departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening,  and that my attendance was requested at the interment on Monday next at three  o'clock in the afternoon.
