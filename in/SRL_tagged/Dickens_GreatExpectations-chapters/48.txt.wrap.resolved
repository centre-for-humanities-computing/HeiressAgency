 The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a  week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf below Bridge; the  time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and, undecided where to dine, I had  strolled up into Cheapside, and was strolling along my boat, surely the most  unsettled person in all the busy concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my  shoulder by some one overtaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers's hand, and Mr. Jaggers passed Mr. Jaggers's hand  through my arm. "As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together. Where are  you bound for?" "For the Temple, I think," said I. "Don't you know?" said Mr. Jaggers. "Well," I returned, glad for once to get the better of Mr. Jaggers in  cross-examination, "I do not know, for I have not made up my mind." "You are going to dine?" said Mr. Jaggers. "You don't mind admitting that, I  suppose?" "No," I returned, "I don't mind admitting that." "And are not engaged?" "I don't mind admitting also that I am not engaged." "Then," said Mr. Jaggers, "come and dine with Mr. Jaggers." I was going to excuse Mr. Jaggers, when Mr. Jaggers added, "Wemmick's coming." So I changed  my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered, serving for the  beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little  Britain, while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows,  and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their  ladders on in the midst of the afternoon's bustle, were skipping up and down  and running in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my  rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall. At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,  hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the business of  the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers's fire, its rising and falling flame  made the two casts on the shelf look as if its rising and falling flame   were playing a diabolical game  at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse, fat office candles that dimly  lighted Mr. Jaggers as Mr. Jaggers wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty  winding-sheets, as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients. We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And, as soon  as We got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have thought of  making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much as a look to  Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no objection to catching  his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it was not to be done. his turned  his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever his raised them from the table, and was as dry  and distant to his as if there were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one. "Did you send that note of Miss Havisham's to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?" Mr. Jaggers  asked, soon after We began dinner. "No, sir," returned Wemmick; "it was going by post, when you brought Mr. Pip  into the office. Here it is." Mr. Pip   handed the office to Mr. Pip   principal instead of to his. "It's a note of two lines, Pip," said " Mr. Jaggers  , handing " Mr. Jaggers   on, "sent up to  me by Miss Havisham on account of Miss Havisham not being sure of your address. Miss Havisham tells  me that Miss Havisham wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to  Miss Havisham. You'll go down?" "Yes," said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those terms. "When do you think of going down?" "I have an impending engagement," said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was putting  fish into the post-office, "that renders me rather uncertain of my time. At  once, I think." "If Mr. Pip   has the intention of going at once," said Wemmick to " Mr. Jaggers  ,  "" Mr. Jaggers   needn't write an answer, you know." Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled that I  would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass of wine, and looked with  a grimly satisfied air at " Mr. Jaggers  , but not at me. "So, Mr. Pip  ! Our friend the Spider," said " Mr. Jaggers  , "has played " Mr. Jaggers   cards. " Mr. Jaggers    has won the pool." It was as much as I could do to assent. "Hah! " Mr. Jaggers   is a promising fellow—in " Mr. Jaggers   way—but " Mr. Jaggers   may not have it all " Mr. Jaggers    own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to be found out  first. If " Mr. Jaggers   should turn to, and beat her—" "Surely," I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, "you do not seriously  think that " Mr. Jaggers   is scoundrel enough for that, " Mr. Jaggers  ?" "I didn't say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and beat her,  he may possibly get the strength on he side; if it should be a question of  intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance work to give an opinion  how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances, because it's a  toss-up between two results." "May I ask what they are?" "A fellow like our friend the Spider," answered " Mr. Jaggers  , "either beats or  cringes. " Mr. Jaggers   may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but " Mr. Jaggers   either beats  or cringes. Ask Wemmick Wemmick opinion." "Either beats or cringes," said Wemmick, not at all addressing Wemmick to me. "So here's to Mrs. Bentley Drummle," said " Mr. Jaggers  , taking a decanter of  choicer wine from " Mr. Jaggers   dumb-waiter, and filling for each of our and for " Mr. Jaggers  ,  "and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady's satisfaction! To  the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly,  Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are to-day!" Molly was at " Mr. Jaggers   elbow when " Mr. Jaggers   addressed Molly, putting a dish upon the table. As  Molly withdrew Molly hands from her hands, Molly fell back a step or two, nervously  muttering some excuse. And a certain action of Molly fingers, as Molly spoke,  arrested my attention. "What's the matter?" said " Mr. Jaggers  . "Nothing. Only the subject our were speaking of," said I, "was rather painful to  me." The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. Molly stood looking at  Molly master, not understanding whether Molly was free to go, or whether he had  more to say to Molly and would call Molly back if Molly did go. Molly look was very  intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable  occasion very lately! he dismissed Molly, and Molly glided out of the room. But Molly remained before he as  plainly as if Molly were still there. I looked at her hands, I looked at those  eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I compared her hands with other hands,  other eyes, other hair, that I knew of, and with what those might be after  twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life. I looked again at those  hands and eyes of the housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that  had come over he when I last walked—not alone—in the ruined garden, and  through the deserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when  I saw a face looking at he, and a hand waving to he from a stage-coach window;  and how a face had come back again and had flashed about he like lightning, when I  had passed in a carriage—not alone—through a sudden glare of light in a  dark street. I thought how one link of association had helped that  identification in the theatre, and how such a link, wanting before, had been  riveted for he now, when I had passed by a chance swift from Estella's name to  the fingers with their knitting action, and the attentive eyes. And I felt  absolutely certain that this woman was Estella's mother. Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed the  sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. Mr. Jaggers nodded when I said the subject  was painful to he, clapped me on the back, put round the wine again, and went  on with Mr. Jaggers dinner. Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then this woman stay in the room was  very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with this woman. But this woman hands were Estella's  hands, and this woman eyes were Estella's eyes, and if this woman had reappeared a hundred  times I could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was  the truth. It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew Wemmick wine, when it came round, quite as  a matter of business,—just as Wemmick might have drawn Wemmick salary when that came  round,—and with Wemmick eyes on Wemmick chief, sat in a state of perpetual readiness  for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine, his post-office was as  indifferent and ready as any other post-office for his post-office quantity of letters.  From my point of view, his was the wrong twin all the time, and only externally  like the Wemmick of Walworth. We took We leave early, and left together. Even when We were groping among Mr.  Jaggers's stock of boots for We hats, I felt that the right twin was on his  way back; and We had not gone half a dozen yards down Gerrard Street in the  Walworth direction, before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right  twin, and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air. "Well!" said Wemmick, "that's over! Wemmick's a wonderful man, without Wemmick living  likeness; but I feel that I have to screw Wemmick up when I dine with him,—and  I dine more comfortably unscrewed." I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told Wemmick so. "Wouldn't say it to anybody but yourself," Wemmick answered. "I know that what is  said between you and me goes no further." I asked Wemmick if Wemmick had ever seen Miss Havisham's adopted daughter, Mrs. Bentley  Drummle. Wemmick said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of the Aged and of  Miss Skiffins. Wemmick looked rather sly when I mentioned Miss Skiffins, and stopped  in the street to blow Wemmick nose, with a roll of the head, and a flourish not  quite free from latent boastfulness. "Wemmick," said I, "do you remember telling me, before I first went to Mr.  Jaggers's private house, to notice that housekeeper?" "Did I?" Wemmick replied. "Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me," Wemmick added, suddenly,  "I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet." "A wild beast tamed, you called her." "And what do you call her?" "The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?" "That's Mr. Jaggers secret. her has been with Mr. Jaggers many a long year." "I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in being  acquainted with her story. You know that what is said between you and me goes no  further." "Well!" Wemmick replied, "I don't know Wemmick story,—that is, I don't know all  of it. But what I do know I'll tell you. We are in We private and personal  capacities, of course." "Of course." "A score or so of years ago, Wemmick was tried at the Old Bailey for murder,  and was acquitted. Wemmick was a very handsome young woman, and I believe had some  gypsy blood in Wemmick. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it was up, as you may  suppose." "But Wemmick was acquitted." "Mr. Jaggers was for Wemmick," pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning, "and  worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a desperate case, and It was  comparatively early days with Mr. Jaggers then, and Mr. Jaggers worked It to general admiration;  in fact, It may almost be said to have made Mr. Jaggers. Mr. Jaggers worked it Mr. Jaggers at the  police-office, day after day for many days, contending against even a  committal; and at the trial where Mr. Jaggers couldn't work it Mr. Jaggers, sat under  counsel, and—every one knew—put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered  person was a woman,—a woman a good ten years older, very much larger, and  very much stronger. It was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives,  and this woman in Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the  broomstick (as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of  jealousy. The murdered woman,—more a match for a tramping man, certainly, in point  of years—was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had been a  violent struggle, perhaps a fight. this woman was bruised and scratched and torn, and  had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now, there was no reasonable  evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and on the improbabilities of  this woman having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers principally rested Mr. Jaggers case. You may  be sure," said Wemmick, touching me on the sleeve, "that Wemmick never dwelt upon  the strength of this woman hands then, though Wemmick sometimes does now." I had told Wemmick of Wemmick showing us Wemmick wrists, that day of the dinner party. "Well, sir!" Wemmick went on; "it happened—happened, don't you see?—that  Wemmick was so very artfully dressed from the time of Wemmick apprehension, that  Wemmick looked much slighter than Wemmick really was; in particular, Wemmick sleeves are  always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that Wemmick arms had quite a  delicate look. Wemmick had only a bruise or two about her,—nothing for a  tramp,—but the backs of her hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was  tramp,—but with finger-nails? Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that Mr. Jaggers had struggled through a  great lot of brambles which were not as high as Mr. Jaggers face; but which Mr. Jaggers could  not have got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles were  actually found in Mr. Jaggers skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that the  brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through, and  to have little shreds of Mr. Jaggers dress and little spots of blood upon her dress and little spots of blood here and  there. But the boldest point Mr. Jaggers made was this: the boldest point he made was attempted to be set up,  in proof of Mr. Jaggers jealousy, that Mr. Jaggers was under strong suspicion of having, at  about the time of the murder, frantically destroyed Mr. Jaggers child by this  man—some three years old—to revenge Mr. Jaggers upon this  man. Mr. Jaggers worked  that in this way: "We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of  brambles, and We show you the brambles. You say these are marks of finger-nails,  and you set up the hypothesis that Mr. Jaggers destroyed her child. You must accept all  consequences of the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. For anything we know, Mr. Jaggers may have destroyed  her child, and the child in clinging to Mr. Jaggers may have scratched her hands. What  then? You are not trying Mr. Jaggers for the murder of her child; why don't you? As to  this case, if you will have scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you  may have accounted for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have  not invented them?" "To sum up, sir," said Wemmick, "Mr. Jaggers was altogether  too many for the jury, and they gave in." "Has Mr. Jaggers been in "Mr. Jaggers service ever since?" "Yes; but not only that," said Wemmick, "Mr. Jaggers went into his service immediately  after Mr. Jaggers acquittal, tamed as Mr. Jaggers is now. Mr. Jaggers has since been taught one thing  and another in the way of Mr. Jaggers duties, but Mr. Jaggers was tamed from the beginning." "Do you remember the sex of the child in clinging to her?" "Said to have been a girl." "You have nothing more to say to me to-night?" "Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed your letter. Nothing." We exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for my  thoughts, though with no relief from the old.
