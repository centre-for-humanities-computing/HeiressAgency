 Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what Mr. Wemmick was like in the  light of day, I found Mr. Wemmick to be a dry man, rather short in stature, with a  square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped  out with a dull-edged chisel.
There were some marks in it that might have been  dimples, if the material had been softer and the instrument finer, but which,  as it was, were only dints.
a dull-edged chisel had made three or four of these attempts  at embellishment over Mr. Wemmick nose, but had given these attempts   up without an effort to  smooth these attempts   off.
I judged Mr. Wemmick to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of Mr. Wemmick  linen, and Mr. Wemmick appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for Mr. Wemmick wore  at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a  weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on a tomb.
I noticed, too, that several rings  and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if his were quite laden with remembrances  of departed friends.
his had glittering eyes,—small, keen, and black,—and  thin wide mottled lips.
his had had eyes,—small, keen, and black,—and  thin wide mottled lips, to the best of my belief, from forty  to fifty years.
"So you were never in London before?"
said Mr. Wemmick to Mr. Wemmick.
"No," said I.
"I was new here once," said Mr. Wemmick.
"Rum to think of now!"
"You are well acquainted with it now?"
"Why, yes," said Mr. Wemmick.
"I know the moves of it."
"Is it a very wicked place?"
I asked, more for the sake of saying something  than for information.
"You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London.
But there are plenty of  people anywhere, who'll do that for you."
"If there is bad blood between you and them," said I, to soften it off a little.
"O!
I don't know about bad blood," returned Mr. Wemmick; "there's not much bad  blood about.
them'll do it, if there's anything to be got by it."
"That makes it worse."
"You think so?"
returned Mr. Wemmick.
"Much about the same, I should say."
Mr. Wemmick wore Mr. Wemmick hat on the back of Mr. Wemmick head, and looked straight before Mr. Wemmick:  walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to  claim Mr. Wemmick attention.
Mr. Wemmick mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that Mr. Wemmick had a  mechanical appearance of smiling.
We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before  I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance, and that Mr. Wemmick was not smiling  at all.
"Do you know where Mr. Wemmick lives?"
I asked Mr. Wemmick.
"Yes," said Mr. Wemmick, nodding in the direction.
"At Hammersmith, west of London."
"Is that far?"
"Well!
Say five miles."
"Do you know Mr.
Wemmick?"
"Why, you're a regular cross-examiner!"
said Mr. Wemmick, looking at Mr. Wemmick with an  approving air.
"Yes, I know Mr. Wemmick.
I know Mr.
Wemmick!"
There was an air of toleration or depreciation about Mr. Wemmick utterance of these  words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways at Mr. Wemmick block  of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text, when Mr. Wemmick said here we  were at Barnard's Inn.
My depression was not alleviated by the announcement,  for, I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to  which the Blue Boar in our town was a mere public-house.
Whereas I now found  Mr. Barnard to be a disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and Mr. Barnard the dingiest  collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a  club for Tom-cats.
we entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an  introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to Mr. Wemmick like a  flat burying-ground.
I thought it had the most dismal trees in it, and the most  dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most dismal houses (in  number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen.
I thought the windows of the  sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of  dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay,  and miserable makeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at Mr. Wemmick from empty  rooms, as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of  Mr. Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present  occupants and the gradual suicide of the present  occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel unholy interment under the gravel.
A frowzy mourning of  soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Mr. Barnard, and this forlorn creation of Barnard had strewn  ashes on this forlorn creation of Barnard head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere  dust-hole.
Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all the  silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,—rot of rat and mouse and  bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides—addressed dry rot and wet rot and all the  silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,—rot of rat and mouse and  bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides— faintly to  my sense of smell, and moaned, "Try Barnard's Mixture."
So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations, that I  looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick.
"Ah!"
said Mr. Wemmick, mistaking me; "the retirement  reminds you of the country.
So it does me."
Mr. Wemmick led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,—which  appeared to Mr. Wemmick to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of those days  the upper lodgers would look out at those days   doors and find those days   without the  means of coming down,—to a set of chambers on the top floor.
MR. POCKET,  JUN., was painted on the door, and there was a label on the letter-box, "Return  shortly."
"JUN hardly thought you'd come so soon," Mr. Wemmick explained.
"You don't want  me any more?"
"No, thank you," said I.
"As I keep the cash," " Mr. Wemmick observed, "we shall most likely meet pretty  often.
Good day."
"Good day."
I put out my hand, and " Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if " Mr. Wemmick thought I  wanted something.
Then " Mr. Wemmick looked at Mr. Wemmick, and said, correcting himself,— "To be sure!
Yes.
You're in the habit of shaking hands?"
I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion, but said  yes.
"I have got so out of it!"
said Mr. Wemmick,—"except at last.
Very glad, I'm  sure, to make your acquaintance.
Good day!"
When we had shaken hands and " Mr. Wemmick was gone, I opened the staircase window and had  nearly beheaded " Mr. Wemmick, for, the lines had rotted away, and the staircase window came down like  the guillotine.
Happily the staircase window was so quick that I had not put my head out.
After  this escape, I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window's  encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully looking out, saying to " Mr. Wemmick that  London was decidedly overrated.
Mr. Pocket, Junior's, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly maddened  " Mr. Wemmick with looking out for half an hour, and had written my name with my  finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the staircase window, before I heard  footsteps on the stairs.
Gradually there arose before " Mr. Wemmick the hat, head,  neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a member of society of about my own  standing.
the hat, head,  neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a member of society of about my own  standing had a paper-bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one  hand, and was out of breath.
"Mr.
Pip?"
said Mr. Pip.
"the hat, head,  neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a member of society of about my own  standing?"
said I.
"Dear me!"
the hat, head,  neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a member of society of about my own  standing exclaimed.
"I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a coach  from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would come by that  one.
The fact is, I have been out on your account,—not that that is any  excuse,—for I thought, coming from the country, you might like a little fruit  after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden Market to get a little fruit   good."
For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head.
I  acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think this was a dream.
"Dear me!"
said Mr. Pocket, Junior.
"This door sticks so!"
As his was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with This door while the  paper-bags were under his arms, I begged his to allow me to hold the  paper-bags were under his arms.
his  relinquished the  paper-bags were under his arms with an agreeable smile, and combated with This door as if This door  were a wild beast.
This door yielded so suddenly at last, that his staggered back upon  me, and I staggered back upon the opposite door, and we both laughed.
But still  I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head, and as if this must be a dream.
"Pray come in," said Mr. Pocket, Junior.
"Allow me to lead the way.
I am rather  bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably well till Monday.
My  father thought you would get on more agreeably through to-morrow with My  father than  with My  father, and might like to take a walk about London.
I am sure I shall be very  happy to show London to My  father.
As to our table, you won't find that bad, I hope,  for it will be supplied from our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I  should add) at your expense, such being Mr. Jaggers's directions.
As to our  lodging, it's not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn,  and My  father hasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take  it, if My  father had.
This is our sitting-room,—just such chairs and tables and  carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home.
You mustn't give  me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors come for you  from the coffee-house.
This is my little bedroom; rather musty, but Mr. Barnardis musty.
This is your bedroom; the furniture's hired for the occasion, but I  trust the occasion will answer the purpose; if you should want anything, I'll go and  fetch the occasion.
The chambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we  shan't fight, I dare say.
But dear me, I beg your pardon, you're holding the  fruit all this time.
Pray let me take these bags from you  .
I am quite ashamed."
As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags, One, Two, I  saw the starting appearance come into him own eyes that I knew to be in mine,  and him said, falling back,— "Lord bless me, you're the prowling boy!"
"And you," said I, "are the pale young gentleman!"
