 After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar in the  morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick's being the right  sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham's.
"Why of course he is  not the right sort of man, Pip," said my guardian, comfortably satisfied  beforehand on the general head, "because the man who fills the post of trust  never is the right sort of man."
It seemed quite to put the man who fills the post of trust   into spirits to  find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of  man, and the man who fills the post of trust   listened in a satisfied manner while I told the man who fills the post of trust   what knowledge I  had of Orlick.
"Very good, Pip," the man who fills the post of trust   observed, when I had concluded, "I'll go  round presently, and pay our friend off."
Rather alarmed by this summary  action, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend might  be difficult to deal with.
"Oh no the man who fills the post of trust   won't," said my guardian, making the man who fills the post of trust    pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence; "I should like to see the man who fills the post of trust    argue the question with me."
As our were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I  breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold my  cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and that I  would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied, if Mr. Jaggers would  let the coachman know that I would get into my place when overtaken.
I was thus  enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately after breakfast.
By then making a  loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of  Pumblechook's premises, I got round into the High Street again, a little beyond  that pitfall, and felt me in comparative security.
It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not  disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after.
One or  two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way  down the High Street before me, that their might turn, as if their had forgotten  something, and pass me face to face,—on which occasions I don't know whether  their or I made the worse pretence; their of not doing it, or I of not seeing it.
Still my position was a distinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied  with my position, until Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb's  boy.
Casting my eyes along the High Street at a certain point of my progress, I beheld  Trabb's  boy approaching, lashing Trabb's  boy with an empty blue bag.
Deeming that a  serene and unconscious contemplation of Trabb's  boy would best beseem me, and would be  most likely to quell Trabb's  boy evil mind, I advanced with that expression of  countenance, and was rather congratulating me on my success, when suddenly  the knees of Trabb's boy smote together, Trabb's  boy hair uprose, Trabb's  boy cap fell off, Trabb's  boy  trembled violently in every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to  the populace, "Hold me!
I'm so frightened!"
feigned to be in a paroxysm of  terror and contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance.
As I passed  Trabb's  boy, Trabb's  boy teeth loudly chattered in Trabb's  boy head, and with every mark of extreme  humiliation, Trabb's  boy prostrated Trabb's  boy in the dust.
This was a hard thing to bear, but This was nothing.
I had not advanced another  two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement, and indignation,  I again beheld Trabb's boy approaching.
Trabb's boy was coming round a narrow corner.
Trabb's boy blue bag was slung over Trabb's boy shoulder, honest industry beamed in Trabb's boy eyes, a  determination to proceed to Trabb's with cheerful briskness was indicated in  Trabb's boy gait.
With a shock Trabb's boy became aware of me, and was severely visited as  before; but this time Trabb's boy motion was rotatory, and Trabb's boy staggered round and round  me with knees more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for  mercy.
Trabb's boy sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of  spectators, and I felt utterly confounded.
I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when I again  beheld Trabb's boy shooting round by a back way.
This time, Trabb's boy was entirely  changed.
Trabb's boy wore His blue bag in the manner of my great-coat, and was strutting  along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street, attended by a  company of delighted young friends to whom Trabb's boy from time to time exclaimed, with  a wave of Trabb's boy hand, "Don't know yah!"
Words cannot state the amount of  aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb's boy, when passing abreast of  me, Trabb's boy pulled up Trabb's boy shirt-collar, twined Trabb's boy side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo,  and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling Trabb's boy elbows and body, and drawling to  Trabb's boy attendants, "Don't know yah, don't know yah, 'pon my soul don't know yah!"
The disgrace attendant on Trabb's boy immediately afterwards taking to crowing and  pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl  who had known me when I was a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I  left the town, and was, so to speak, ejected by the town into the open country.
But unless I had taken the life of Trabb's boy on that occasion, I really do  not even now see what I could have done save endure.
To have struggled with Trabb's boy  in the street, or to have exacted any lower recompense from Trabb's boy than Trabb's boy  heart's best blood, would have been futile and degrading.
Moreover, Trabb's boy was a  boy whom no man could hurt; an invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when  chased into a corner, flew out again between Trabb's boy captor's legs, scornfully  yelping.
I wrote, however, to Mr. Trabb by next day's post, to say that Mr. Pip  must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what Mr. Trabb owed to  the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited Loathing in every  respectable mind.
The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my box-seat  again, and arrived in London safe,—but not sound, for my heart was gone.
As  soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe  (as reparation for not having gone Mr. Jaggers), and then went on to Barnard's Inn.
I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.
Having  despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to Dinner, I  felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum.
As  confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the hall, which could  merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to the keyhole, I sent Herbert to  the Play.
A better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could  scarcely be afforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly  driven to find Herbert employment.
So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent Herbert  to Hyde Park corner to see what o'clock it was.
Dinner done and we sitting with we feet upon the fender, I said to Herbert,  "My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell you."
"My dear Handel," My dear Handel returned, "I shall esteem and respect your confidence."
"It concerns myself, Herbert," said I, "and one other person."
Herbert crossed our feet, looked at the fire with Herbert head on one side, and  having looked at one side in vain for some time, looked at myself because I didn't go on.
"Herbert," said I, laying my hand upon Herbert knee, "I love—I adore—Estella."
Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matter-of-course way,  "Exactly.
Well?"
"Well, Herbert?
Is that all you say?
Well?"
"What next, I mean?"
said Herbert.
"Of course I know that."
"How do you know it?"
said I.
"How do I know it, My dear Handel?
Why, from My dear Handel."
"I never told you."
"Told me!
You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I have  had senses to perceive your hair.
You have always adored her, ever since I have known  you.
You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together.
Told me!
Why, you have always told me all day long.
When you told me your own story, you  told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her, when you  were very young indeed."
"Very well, then," said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light, "I  have never left off adoring her.
And her has come back, a most beautiful and  most elegant creature.
And I saw her yesterday.
And if I adored her before, I  now doubly adore her."
"Lucky for you then, My dear Handel," said Herbert, "that you are picked out for her  and allotted to her.
Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we may venture to  say that there can be no doubt between we of that fact.
Have you any  idea yet, of Estella's views on the adoration question?"
I shook my head gloomily.
"Oh!
her is thousands of miles away, from you," said I.
"Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough.
But you have something  more to say?"
"I am ashamed to say it," I returned, "and yet it's no worse to say it than to  think it.
You call me a lucky fellow.
Of course, I am.
I was a blacksmith's boy  but yesterday; I am—what shall I say I am—to-day?"
"Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase," returned Herbert, smiling, and  clapping a good fellow hand on the back of mine—"a good fellow, with impetuosity and  hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and dreaming, curiously mixed in  a good fellow."
I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my  character.
On the whole, I by no means recognized the analysis, but thought the analysis  not worth disputing.
"When I ask what I am to call you to-day, Herbert," I went on, "I suggest  what I have in my thoughts.
You say I am lucky.
I know I have done nothing to  raise you in life, and that Fortune alone has raised me; that is being very  lucky.
And yet, when I think of Estella—" ("And when don't you, you know?"
Herbert threw in, with Herbert eyes on the fire;  which I thought kind and sympathetic of Herbert.)
"—Then, Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain I  feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances.
Avoiding forbidden ground, as you  did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of one person (naming no  person) all my expectations depend.
And at the best, how indefinite and  unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what they are!"
In saying this, I  relieved my mind of what had always been there, more or less, though no doubt  most since yesterday.
"Now, My dear Handel," Herbert replied, in Herbert gay, hopeful way, "it seems to you that  in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into we gift-horse's  mouth with a magnifying-glass.
Likewise, it seems to you that, concentrating we  attention on the examination, we altogether overlook one of the best points of  the animal.
Didn't you tell me that your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the  beginning, that you were not endowed with expectations only?
And even if your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the  beginning, that you were not endowed with expectations only had  not told you so,—though that is a very large If, I grant,—could you believe  that of all men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold Mr. Jaggers present relations  towards you unless Mr. Jaggers were sure of Mr. Jaggers ground?"
I said I could not deny that this was a strong point.
I said this was a strong point (people often  do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth and  justice;—as if I wanted to deny this was a strong point!
"I should think it was a strong point," said Herbert, "and I should think you  would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you must bide your  guardian's time, and Herbert must bide Herbert client's time.
You'll be one-and-twenty  before you know where you are, and then perhaps you'll get some further  enlightenment.
At all events, you'll be nearer getting it, for it must come at  last."
"What a hopeful disposition you have!"
said I, gratefully admiring his cheery  ways.
"I ought to have," said Herbert, "for I have not much else.
I must acknowledge,  by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is not my own, but my  father's.
The only remark I ever heard his make on your story, was the final  one, "The thing is settled and done, or Mr. Jaggers would not be in "The thing."
And  now before I say anything more about my  father, or my father's son, and repay  confidence with confidence, I want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you  for a moment,—positively repulsive."
"You won't succeed," said I.
"O yes I shall!"
said he.
"One, two, three, and now I am in for it.
Handel, my  good fellow;"—though he spoke in this light tone, he was very much in  earnest,—"I have been thinking since we have been talking with we feet on  this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition of your inheritance, if  Estella was never referred to by your guardian.
Am I right in so understanding what  you have told me, as that he never referred to Estella, directly or indirectly, in  any way?
Never even hinted, for instance, that your patron might have views as  to your marriage ultimately?"
"Never."
"Now, My dear Handel, I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes, upon my soul and  honor!
Not being bound to Estella, can you not detach My dear Handel from her?—I told  you I should be disagreeable."
I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh winds  coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning  when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly rising, and when I laid my  hand upon the village finger-post, smote upon my heart again.
There was silence  between us for a little while.
"Yes; but My dear Handel," Herbert went on, as if us had been talking, instead  of silent, "its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom  nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders its very serious.
Think of  her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham.
Think of what her is her (now  I am repulsive and you abominate me).
This may lead to miserable things."
"I know it, Herbert," said I, with my head still turned away, "but I can't help  it."
"You can't detach yourself?"
"No.
Impossible!"
"You can't try, My dear Handel?"
"No.
Impossible!"
"Well!"
said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if Herbert had been asleep,  and stirring the fire, "now I'll endeavor to make Herbert agreeable again!"
So Herbert went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in the curtains  places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about, looked into the  hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and came back to Herbert chair by  the fire: where Herbert sat down, nursing Herbert left leg in both arms.
"I was going to say a word or two, My dear Handel, concerning my father and my father's  son.
I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father's  's son to remark that my  father's establishment is not particularly brilliant in my  father's establishment housekeeping."
"There is always plenty, Herbert," said I, to say something encouraging.
"O yes!
and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest approval, and so  does the marine-store shop in the back street.
Gravely, My dear Handel, for the subject  is grave enough, you know how the subject   is as well as I do.
I suppose there was a time  once when my father's   had not given matters up; but if ever there was, the time  is gone.
May I ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down  in your part of the country, that the children of not exactly suitable  marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married?"
This was such a singular question, that I asked my father's   in return, "Is it so?"
"I don't know," said Herbert, "that's what I want to know.
Because it is  decidedly the case with us.
My poor sister Charlotte, who was next me and died  before Little Jane was fourteen, was a striking example.
Little Jane is the same.
In  Little Jane desire to be matrimonially established, you might suppose Little Jane to have  passed Little Jane short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss.
Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for Little Alick in a frock union with a  suitable young person at Kew.
And indeed, I think we are all engaged, except  the baby."
"Then you are?"
said I.
"I am," said Herbert; "but it's a secret."
I assured Little Alick in a frock of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favored with further  particulars.
Little Alick in a frock had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I  wanted to know something about Little Alick in a frock strength.
"May I ask the name?"
I said.
"Name of Clara," said Herbert.
"Live in London?"
"Yes, perhaps I ought to mention," said Herbert, who had become curiously  crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting theme, "that she is  rather below my mother's nonsensical family notions.
she father had to do with  the victualling of passenger-ships.
I think Her father was a species of purser."
"What is Her father now?"
said I.
"Her father's an invalid now," replied Herbert.
"Living on—?"
"On the first floor," said Herbert.
Which was not at all what I meant, for I  had intended my question to apply to Herbert means.
"I have never seen Herbert, for Herbert  has always kept Herbert room overhead, since I have known Clara.
But I have heard  Herbert constantly.
Herbert makes tremendous rows,—roars, and pegs at the first floor with  some frightful instrument."
In looking at me and then laughing heartily,  Herbert for the time recovered Herbert usual lively manner.
"Don't you expect to see Herbert?"
said I.
"O yes, I constantly expect to see Herbert," returned Herbert, "because I never  hear Herbert, without expecting Herbert to come tumbling through the ceiling.
But I  don't know how long the rafters may hold."
When Herbert had once more laughed heartily, Herbert became meek again, and told me that  the moment Herbert began to realize Capital, it was Herbert intention to marry this  young lady.
Herbert added as a self-evident proposition, engendering low spirits,  "But you can't marry, you know, while you're looking about you."
As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision to  realize this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my pockets.
A folded  piece of paper in one of my pockets attracting my attention, I opened it and found it  to be the play-bill I had received from Joe, relative to the celebrated  provincial amateur of Roscian renown.
"And bless my heart," I involuntarily  added aloud, "it's to-night!"
This changed the subject in an instant, and made we hurriedly resolve to go to  the play.
So, when I had pledged you to comfort and abet Herbert in the  affair of Herbert heart by all practicable and impracticable means, and when  Herbert had told me that Herbert affianced already knew me by reputation and that I  should be presented to her, and when we had warmly shaken hands upon we mutual  confidence, we blew out we candles, made up we fire, locked we door, and  issued forth in quest of Mr. Wopsle and Denmark.
