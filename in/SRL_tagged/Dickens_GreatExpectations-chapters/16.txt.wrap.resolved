 With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe that I  must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister, or at all events that as  my sister near relation, popularly known to be under obligations to my sister, I was a more  legitimate object of suspicion than any one else. But when, in the clearer  light of next morning, I began to reconsider the matter and to hear the matter  discussed around Joe on all sides, I took another view of the case, which was  more reasonable. Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking Joe pipe, from a quarter  after eight o'clock to a quarter before ten. While Joe was there, my sister had  been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged Good Night with a  farm-laborer going home. Joe could not be more particular as to the time at  which Joe saw my sister (Joe got into dense confusion when Joe tried to be), than that  it must have been before nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten,  Joe found my sister struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The  fire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle very  long; the candle, however, had been blown out. Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond the  blowing out of the candle,—which stood on a table between the door and my  sister, and was behind my sister when my sister stood facing The  fire and was struck,—was  there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such as my sister herself had  made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one remarkable piece of evidence  on the spot. my sister had been struck with something blunt and heavy, on the head  and spine; after the blows were dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at  my sister with considerable violence, as my sister lay on my sister face. And on the ground  beside my sister, when Joe picked my sister up, was a convict's leg-iron which had been  filed asunder. Now, Joe, examining a convict's leg-iron which had been  filed asunder with a smith's eye, declared a convict's leg-iron which had been  filed asunder to have been  filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the Hulks, and people  coming thence to examine a convict's leg-iron which had been  filed asunder, Joe's opinion was corroborated. The hue and cry going off to the Hulks, and people   did not  undertake to say when Joe's opinion had left the prison-ships to which Joe's opinion undoubtedly had  once belonged; but The hue and cry going off to the Hulks, and people   claimed to know for certain that that particular  manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last  night. Further, one of The hue and cry going off to the Hulks, and people   was already retaken, and had not freed himself  of himself . Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed a convict's leg-iron which had been  filed asunderto be my convict's iron,—the iron I had seen and heard himself filing at, on the  marshes,—but my mind did not accuse himself of having put it to it latest use.  For I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it, and to  have turned it to this cruel account. Either Orlick, or the strange man who had  shown me the file. Now, as to Orlick; Orlick had gone to town exactly as Orlick told us when us picked Orlick  up at the turnpike, Orlick had been seen about town all the evening, Orlick had been in  divers companies in several public-houses, and Orlick had come back with Orlick and  Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against Mr. Wopsle, save the quarrel; and my sister had  quarrelled with Mr. Wopsle, and with everybody else about my sister, ten thousand times. As  to the strange man; if the strange man had come back for the strange man two bank-notes there could have  been no dispute about he had come back for his two bank-notes, because my sister was fully prepared to restore  he had come back for his two bank-notes. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so  silently and suddenly, that my sister had been felled before my sister could look round. It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however undesignedly,  but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered unspeakable trouble while I  considered and reconsidered whether I should at last dissolve that spell of my  childhood and tell Joe all the story. For months afterwards, I every day  settled the question finally in the negative, and reopened and reargued the question next  morning. The contention came, after all, to this;—the secret was such an old  one now, had so grown into Orlick and become a part of Orlick, that I could not  tear the question away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much mischief,  it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from Orlick if Joe believed  it, I had a further restraining dread that Joe would not believe it, but would  assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a monstrous invention.  However, I temporized with Orlick, of course—for, was I not wavering between  right and wrong, when the thing is always done?—and resolved to make a full  disclosure if I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in  the discovery of the assailant. The Constables and the Bow Street men from London—for, this happened in the  days of the extinct red-waistcoated police—were about the house for a week or  two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like authorities doing  in other such cases. authorities doing  in other such cases took up several obviously wrong people, and authorities doing  in other such cases ran  authorities doing  in other such cases heads very hard against wrong ideas, and persisted in trying to fit the  circumstances to the ideas, instead of trying to extract ideas from the  circumstances. Also, authorities doing  in other such cases stood about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with  knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration;  and authorities doing  in other such cases had a mysterious manner of taking authorities doing  in other such cases drink, that was almost as good  as taking the culprit. But not quite, for authorities doing  in other such cases never did it. Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very ill in  bed. my sister sight was disturbed, so that my sister saw objects multiplied, and grasped  at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities; my sister hearing was  greatly impaired; my sister memory also; and my sister speech was unintelligible. When, at  last, my sister came round so far as to be helped down stairs, it was still necessary  to keep my slate always by my sister, that my sister might indicate in writing what my sister  could not indicate in speech. As my sister was (very bad handwriting apart) a more  than indifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,  extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always called in to  solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of  Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own mistakes. However, my sister temper was greatly improved, and my sister was patient. A tremulous  uncertainty of the action of all my sister limbs soon became a part of my sister regular  state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three months, my sister would often put  my sister hands to my sister head, and would then remain for about a week at a time in some  gloomy aberration of mind. We were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for  my sister, until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve We. Mr. Wopsle's  great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which Mr. Wopsle's  great-aunt had fallen, and  Biddy became a part of We establishment. It may have been about a month after my sister's reappearance in the kitchen,  when Biddy came to We with a small speckled box containing the whole of Biddy  worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household. Above all, Biddy was a  blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant  contemplation of the wreck of the dear old fellow wife, and had been accustomed, while  attending on his wife of an evening, to turn to Biddy every now and then and say, with  the dear old fellow blue eyes moistened, "Such a fine figure of a woman as a woman once were, Pip!"  Biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of Biddy as though Biddy had studied  Biddy from infancy; Joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet  of Joe life, and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change  that did Joe good. It was characteristic of the police people that the police people had all  more or less suspected poor Joe (though Joe never knew it), and that the police people had to  a man concurred in regarding Joe as one of the deepest spirits the police people had ever  encountered. Biddy's first triumph in Biddy new office, was to solve a difficulty that had  completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made nothing of it.  Thus it was:— Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a character  that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost eagerness had called our  attention to it as something my sister particularly wanted. I had in vain tried  everything producible that began with a T, from tar to toast and tub. At length  it had come into her head that the sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily  calling that word in my sister's ear, my sister had begun to hammer on the table and  had expressed a qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers,  one after another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the  shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed the  shape  to my sister with considerable confidence. But my sister shook my sister to that  extent when my sister was shown that  extent, that we were terrified lest in my sister weak and  shattered state my sister should dislocate my sister neck. When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand my sister, the sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully at the sign, heard  my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked thoughtfully at Joe  (who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter), and ran into  the forge, followed by Joe and me. "Why, of course!" cried Biddy, with an exultant face. "Don't you see? It's him!" Orlick, without a doubt! my sister had lost his name, and could only signify his by  his hammer. We told his why We wanted his to come into the kitchen, and his  slowly laid down  his hammer, wiped his brow with his arm, took another wipe at  another wipe with his apron, and came slouching out, with a curious loose vagabond bend  in the knees that strongly distinguished his. I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce his, and that I was  disappointed by the different result. my sister manifested the greatest anxiety to be  on good terms with his, was evidently much pleased by his being at length  produced, and motioned that my sister would have his given something to drink. my sister  watched his countenance as if my sister were particularly wishful to be assured that  his took kindly to his reception, my sister showed every possible desire to conciliate  his, and there was an air of humble propitiation in all my sister did, such as I have  seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master. After that day, a  day rarely passed without my sister drawing the hammer on my sister slate, and without  Orlick's slouching in and standing doggedly before my sister, as if Orlick knew no more  than I did what to make of no.
