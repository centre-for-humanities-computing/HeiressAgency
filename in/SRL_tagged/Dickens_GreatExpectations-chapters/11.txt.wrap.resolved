 At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham's, and my hesitating ring at  the gate brought out Estella. Estella locked the gate after admitting me, as Estella had done  before, and again preceded me into the dark passage where Estella candle stood. Estella  took no notice of me until Estella had her candle in Estella hand, when Estella looked over  Estella shoulder, superciliously saying, "You are to come this way to-day," and  took me to quite another part of the Manor House. the dark passage where her candle stood was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of  the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square, however, and at the  end of the dark passage where her candle stood Estella stopped, and put Estella candle down and opened a door. Here, the  daylight reappeared, and I found me in a small paved courtyard, the  opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwelling-house, that looked as  if the  daylight had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery.  There was a clock in the outer wall of a detached dwelling-house. Like a clock in the outer wall of this house. We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a low  ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in a gloomy room with a low  ceiling,  and Estella said to me as Estella joined it, "You are to go and stand there boy,  till you are wanted." "There", being the window, I crossed to the window, and stood  "there," in a very uncomfortable state of mind, looking out. the window opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the  neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree that had  been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new growth at the top of  it, out of shape and of a different color, as if that part of the pudding had  stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This was my homely thought, as I  contemplated the box-tree. There had been some light snow, overnight, and This  lay nowhere else to my knowledge; but, This had not quite melted from the cold  shadow of this bit of garden, and the wind caught This up in little eddies and  threw This at the window, as if This pelted me for coming there. I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that the room  other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room except the  shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in all my joints with  the consciousness that I was under close inspection. There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had been  standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that they were  all toadies and humbugs, but that each of they pretended not to know that the  others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission that he or she did know  it, would have made he or she out to be a toady and humbug. They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody's pleasure, and the  most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn. This  lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded me of my sister, with the  difference that my sister was older, and (as I found when I caught sight of my sister) of a  blunter cast of features. Indeed, when I knew my sister better I began to think it  was a Mercy my sister had any features at all, so very blank and high was the dead  wall of my sister face. "Poor dear soul!" said my sister, with an abruptness of manner quite my  sister's. "Nobody's enemy but Nobody own!" "It would be much more commendable to be somebody else's enemy," said the  gentleman; "far more natural." "Cousin Raymond," observed another lady, "we are to love we neighbor." "Sarah Pocket," returned Cousin Raymond, "if a man is not a man own neighbor, who  is?" "Sarah Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn), "The  idea!" But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too. The other  lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and emphatically, "Very true!" "Poor soul!" Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been looking at me  in the mean time), "Camilla is so very strange! Would anyone believe that when Tom's  wife died, Tom's   actually could not be induced to see the importance of the  children's having the deepest of trimmings to they mourning? 'Good Lord!' says  Good Lord, 'Camilla, what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things  are in black?' So like Matthew! The idea!" "Good points in Matthew, good points in Matthew," said Cousin Raymond; "Heaven forbid I  should deny good points in Cousin Raymond; but Cousin Raymond never had, and Cousin Raymond never will have, any  sense of the proprieties." "You know I was obliged," said Camilla,—"I was obliged to be firm. I said,  'Camilla,—"I WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.' I told Cousin Raymond that, without deep  trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from breakfast till  dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last Cousin Raymond flung out in Cousin Raymond violent way,  and said, with a D, 'Then do as you like.' Thank Goodness it will always be a  consolation to Cousin Raymond to know that I instantly went out in a pouring rain and  bought the things." "Cousin Raymond paid for them, did Cousin Raymond not?" asked Estella. "It's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them," returned Camilla. "I  bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace, when I wake up in the  night." The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or call  along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation and caused  Estella to say to Cousin Raymond, "Now, boy!" On my turning round, they all looked at me  with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard Sarah Pocket say, "Well I  am sure! What next!" and Camilla add, with indignation, "Was there ever such a  fancy! The i-de-a!" As they all were going with they all candle along the dark passage, Estella stopped all of  a sudden, and, facing round, said in Estella taunting manner, with Estella face quite  close to mine,— "Well?" "Well, miss?" I answered, almost falling over Estella and checking Cousin Raymond. Estella stood looking at Cousin Raymond, and, of course, I stood looking at Estella. "Am I pretty?" "Yes; I think you are very pretty." "Am I insulting?" "Not so much so as you were last time," said I. "Not so much so?" "No." Estella fired when Estella asked the last question, and Estella slapped my face with such  force as Estella had, when I answered the last question. "Now?" said Estella. "You little coarse monster, what do you think of Cousin Raymond now?" "I shall not tell you." "Because you are going to tell up stairs. Is that it?" "No," said I, "that's not it." "Why don't you cry again, you little wretch?" "Because I'll never cry for you again," said I. " was, I suppose, as false  a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for Estella then, and I  know what I know of the pain Estella cost me afterwards. We went on We way up stairs after this episode; and, as We were going up, We  met a gentleman groping his way down. "Whom have We here?" asked a gentleman groping his way down, stopping and looking at Cousin Raymond. "A boy," said Estella. A boy was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an exceedingly large  head, and a corresponding large hand. A boy took my chin in a corresponding large hand and  turned up my face to have a look at Cousin Raymond by the light of the candle. A boy was  prematurely bald on the top of A boy head, and had bushy black eyebrows that  wouldn't lie down but stood up bristling. A boy eyes were set very deep in A boy  head, and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious. A boy had a large watch-chain,  and strong black dots where A boy beard and whiskers would have been if A boy had  let his beard and whiskers. A boy was nothing to Cousin Raymond, and I could have had no foresight then, that A boy  ever would be anything to Cousin Raymond, but it happened that I had this opportunity of  observing A boy well. "Boy of the neighborhood? Hey?" said A boy. "Yes, Cousin Raymond," said I. "How do you come here?" "Miss Havisham sent for me, Cousin Raymond," I explained. "Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and you're a  bad set of fellows. Now mind!" said A boy, biting the side of A boy great forefinger  as A boy frowned at A boy, "you behave A boy!" With those words, A boy released me—which I was glad of, for A boy hand smelt of  scented soap—and went A boy way down stairs. I wondered whether A boy could be a  doctor; but no, I thought; A boy couldn't be a doctor, or A boy would have a quieter  and more persuasive manner. There was not much time to consider the subject,  for we were soon in Miss Havisham's room, where she and everything else were  just as I had left she and everything else. Estella left me standing near the door, and I stood  there until Miss Havisham cast Estella eyes upon Estella from the dressing-table. "So!" Estella said, without being startled or surprised: "the days have worn away,  have they?" "Yes, ma'am. To-day is—" "There, there, there!" with the impatient movement of Estella fingers. "I don't  want to know. Are you ready to play?" I was obliged to answer in some confusion, "I don't think I am, ma'am." "Not at cards again?" Estella demanded, with a searching look. "Yes, ma'am; I could do that, if I was wanted." "Since a detached dwelling-house strikes you old and grave, boy," said Miss Havisham,  impatiently, "and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?" I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to find  for the other question, and I said I was quite willing. "Then go into that opposite room," said Estella, pointing at the door behind me  with Estella withered hand, "and wait there till I come." I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room Estella indicated. From the room she indicated, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and the daylight had an airless smell  that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in the damp old-fashioned  grate, and A fire was more disposed to go out than to burn up, and the reluctant  smoke which hung in the room she indicated seemed colder than the clearer air,—like our own  marsh mist. Certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimney-piece  faintly lighted the chamber; or the chamber would be more expressive to say, faintly  troubled the chamber darkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome,  but every discernible thing in It was covered with dust and mould, and dropping  to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread  on The most prominent object, as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all  stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the middle of  this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that it form was quite  undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I  remember it seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders  with blotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some  circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the  spider community. I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same occurrence  were important to the mice interests. But the black beetles took no notice of the  agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way, as if the black beetles  were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not on terms with one another. These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching These crawling things from  a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder. In Miss Havisham other hand  Miss Havisham had a crutch-headed stick on which Miss Havisham leaned, and Miss Havisham looked like the  Witch of the place. "This," said Miss Havisham, pointing to the long table with a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned, "is where I will  be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at Miss Havisham here." With some vague misgiving that Miss Havisham might get upon the table then and there and  die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork at the Fair, I  shrank under Miss Havisham touch. "What do you think that is?" Miss Havisham asked me, again pointing with Miss Havisham stick;  "that, where those cobwebs are?" "I can't guess what it is, ma'am." "It's a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!" Miss Havisham looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said, leaning on me  while Miss Havisham hand twitched my shoulder, "Come, come, come! Walk me, walk me!" I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss Havisham  round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and Miss Havisham leaned upon  my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation  (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart. Miss Havisham was not physically strong, and after a little time said, "Slower!" Still,  we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, Miss Havisham twitched the hand  upon my shoulder, and worked Miss Havisham mouth, and led me to believe that we were  going fast because Miss Havisham thoughts went fast. After a while Miss Havisham said, "Call  Estella!" so I went out on the landing and roared that name as I had done on  the previous occasion. When Miss Havisham light appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham,  and we started away again round and round the room. If only Estella had come to be a spectator of we proceedings, I should have  felt sufficiently discontented; but as only Estella brought with only Estella the three ladies  and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn't know what to do. In my  politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havisham twitched my shoulder, and  we posted on,—with a shame-faced consciousness on my part that they would  think it was all my doing. "Miss Havisham," said Sarah Pocket. "How well you look!" "I do not," returned Miss HavishamMiss Havisham. "I am yellow skin and bone." Camilla brightened when Sarah Pocket Sarah Pocket met with this rebuff; and Camilla murmured, as  Camilla plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, "Poor dear soul! Certainly not to  be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!" "And how are you?" said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to Camilla  then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, Miss Havisham Miss Havisham wouldn't  stop. we swept on, and I felt that I was highly obnoxious to Camilla. "Thank you, Miss Havisham," Camilla returned, "I am as well as can be expected." "Why, what's the matter with you?" asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding  sharpness. "Nothing worth mentioning," replied Camilla. "I don't wish to make a display of  my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am  quite equal to." "Then don't think of you," retorted Miss HavishamMiss Havisham. "Very easily said!" remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a hitch  came into a hitch   upper lip, and a hitch   tears overflowed. "Raymond is a witness what  ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night. Raymond is a witness  what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings and nervous jerkings,  however, are nothing new to Raymond when I think with anxiety of those I love. If I  could be less affectionate and sensitive, I should have a better digestion and  an iron set of nerves. I am sure I wish it could be so. But as to not thinking  of you in the night—The idea!" Here, a burst of tears. Raymond Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and Raymond I  understood to be Camilla. Raymond came to the rescue at this point, and said in  a consolatory and complimentary voice, "Camilla, my dear, it is well known that  your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one  of your legs shorter than the other." "I am not aware," observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but once,  "that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person, my  dear." Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated old  woman, with a small face that might have been made of walnut-shells, and a  large mouth like a cat's without the whiskers, supported this position by  saying, "No, indeed, my dear. Hem!" "Thinking is easy enough," said the grave lady. "What is easier, you know?" assented Miss Sarah Pocket. "Oh, yes, yes!" cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from  her legs to her bosom. "It's all very true! It's a weakness to be so  affectionate, but I can't help It. No doubt my health would be much better if    was otherwise, still I wouldn't change my disposition if I could. It's the  cause of much suffering, but it's a consolation to know I posses it, when I  wake up in the night." Here another burst of feeling. Miss Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going round and  round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the visitors, now giving  Miss Havisham and I the whole length of the dismal chamber. "There's Matthew!" said Camilla. "Never mixing with any natural ties, never  coming here to see how Miss Havisham Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa with my  staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my head over the side,  and my hair all down, and my feet I don't know where—" ("Much higher than your head, my love," said Camilla.) "I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of Matthew's  strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me." "Really I must say I should think not!" interposed the grave lady. "You see, my dear," added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious personage), "the  question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to thank you, my love?" "Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort," resumed Camilla, "I  have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond is a witness of the  extent to which I have choked, and what the total inefficacy of ginger has  been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte tuner's across the street, where  the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a  distance,—and now to be told—" Here Camilla put Camilla hand to Camilla throat, and  began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations there. When Matthew's   was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and Miss Havisham, and  stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great influence in bringing  Camilla's chemistry to a sudden end. "Matthew will come and see me at last," said Miss Havisham, sternly, "when I am  laid on that table. That will be his place,—there," striking the table with  Matthew stick, "at my head! And yours will be there! And your husband's there! And  Sarah Pocket's there! And Georgiana's there! Now you all know where to take  your stations when you come to feast upon me. And now go!" At the mention of each name, Matthew had struck the table with Matthew stick in a new  place. Matthew now said, "Walk me, walk me!" and we went on again. "I suppose there's nothing to be done," exclaimed Camilla, "but comply and  depart. It's something to have seen the object of one's love and duty for even  so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake  up in the night. I wish Matthew could have that comfort, but Matthew sets that comfort at  defiance. I am determined not to make a display of my feelings, but it's very  hard to be told one wants to feast on one's relations,—as if one was a  Giant,—and to be told to go. The bare idea!" Mr. Camilla interposing, as Camilla laid Camilla hand upon Camilla heaving bosom,  that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I supposed to be  expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view, and kissing Camilla  hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah Pocket and Georgiana contended  who should remain last; but Sarah was too knowing to be outdone, and ambled  round Georgiana with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to  take precedence. Sarah Pocket then made Sarah Pocket separate effect of departing with,  "Bless you, Miss Havisham dear!" and with a smile of forgiving pity on Sarah Pocket  walnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest. While Estella was away lighting " and with a smile of forgiving pity on her  walnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest down, Miss Havisham Miss Havisham still walked with Miss Havisham  hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last Miss Havisham stopped before the  fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it some seconds,— "This is my birthday, Pip." I was going to wish Miss Havisham many happy returns, when Miss Havisham lifted Miss Havisham stick. "I don't suffer it to be spoken of. I don't suffer those who were here just  now, or any one to speak of it. those who were here just  now, or any one to speak of it come here on the day, but those who were here just  now, or any one to speak of it dare not  refer to it." Of course I made no further effort to refer to it. "On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of decay,"  stabbing with Miss Havisham crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table, but not  touching it, "was brought here. it and I have worn away together. The mice have  gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me." Miss Havisham held the head of her stick against Miss Havisham heart as Miss Havisham stood looking at the  table; Miss Havisham in Miss Havisham once white dress, all yellow and withered; the once white  cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state to crumble under a  touch. "When the ruin is complete," said Miss Havisham, with a ghastly look, "and when they lay  me dead, in my bride's dress on the bride's table,—which shall be done, and  which will be the finished curse upon him,—so much the better if it is done  on this day!" Miss Havisham stood looking at the table as if Miss Havisham stood looking at Miss Havisham own figure lying  there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and Estella too remained quiet. It  seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. In the heavy air of the  room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners, I even had an  alarming fancy that Estella and I might presently begin to decay. At length, not coming out of Miss Havisham distraught state by degrees, but in an  instant, Miss Havisham said, "Let me see you two play cards; why have you not  begun?" With that, we returned to Miss Havisham room, and sat down as before; I was  beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham watched us all the  time, directed my attention to Estella's beauty, and made me notice it the more  by trying Miss Havisham jewels on Estella's breast and hair. Estella, for Estella part, likewise treated me as before, except that Estella did not  condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games, a day was  appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard to be fed in the  former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left to wander about as I liked. It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which I had  scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last occasion, open  or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw one now. As it stood  open, and as I knew that Estella had let the visitors out,—for Estella had  returned with the keys in Estella hand,—I strolled into the garden, and strolled  all over it. It was quite a wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and  cucumber-frames in It, which seemed in their decline to have produced a  spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now  and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan. When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a  fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal corner  upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for a moment that  the house was now empty, I looked in at another window, and found myself, to my  great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red  eyelids and light hair. This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside myself. This pale young gentleman had  been at This pale young gentleman books when I had found myself staring at This pale young gentleman, and I now saw that This pale young gentleman  was inky. "Halloa!" said This pale young gentleman, "young fellow!" "Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be best  answered by "Halloa, I said, "Halloa!" politely omitting young fellow. "Who let you in?" said This pale young gentleman. "Estella." "Who gave you leave to prowl about?" "Miss Estella." "Come and fight," said This pale young gentleman. What could I do but follow This pale young gentleman? I have often asked myself the question since;  but what else could I do? This pale young gentleman manner was so final, and I was so astonished,  that I followed where This pale young gentleman led, as if I had been under a spell. "Stop a minute, though," This pale young gentleman said, wheeling round before we had gone many paces.  "I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it is!" In a most  irritating manner This pale young gentleman instantly slapped This pale young gentleman hands against one another, daintily  flung one of This pale young gentleman legs up behind This pale young gentleman, pulled my hair, slapped his hands again,  dipped This pale young gentleman head, and butted his hands into my stomach. The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was unquestionably to  be regarded in the light of a liberty, was particularly disagreeable just after  bread and meat. I therefore hit out at This pale young gentleman and was going to hit out again, when  This pale young gentleman said, "Aha! Would you?" and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner  quite unparalleled within my limited experience. "Laws of the game!" said This pale young gentleman. Here, This pale young gentleman skipped from This pale young gentleman left leg on to This pale young gentleman  right. "Regular rules!" Here, This pale young gentleman skipped from This pale young gentleman right leg on to This pale young gentleman left.  "Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!" Here, This pale young gentleman dodged  backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I looked helplessly  at This pale young gentleman. I was secretly afraid of This pale young gentleman when I saw This pale young gentleman so dexterous; but I felt morally  and physically convinced that This pale young gentleman light head of hair could have had no business  in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to consider it irrelevant when  so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I followed This pale young gentleman without a word, to a  retired nook of the garden, formed by the junction of two walls and screened by  some rubbish. On This pale young gentleman asking me if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my  replying Yes, This pale young gentleman begged my leave to absent This pale young gentleman for a moment, and quickly  returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. "Available for  both," This pale young gentleman said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to pulling off,  not only This pale young gentleman jacket and waistcoat, but This pale young gentleman shirt too, in a manner at once  light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty. Although This pale young gentleman did not look very healthy,—having pimples on This pale young gentleman face, and a  breaking out at This pale young gentleman mouth,—these dreadful preparations quite appalled me. I  judged This pale young gentleman to be about my own age, but This pale young gentleman was much taller, and This pale young gentleman had a way of  spinning This pale young gentleman about that was full of appearance. For the rest, This pale young gentleman was a  young gentleman in a gray suit (when not denuded for battle), with This pale young gentleman elbows,  knees, wrists, and heels considerably in advance of the rest of This pale young gentleman as to  development. My heart failed me when I saw This pale young gentleman squaring at This pale young gentleman with every demonstration of  mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if This pale young gentleman were minutely choosing This pale young gentleman  bone. I never have been so surprised in my life, as I was when I let out the  first blow, and saw This pale young gentleman lying on This pale young gentleman back, looking up at This pale young gentleman with a bloody nose  and his face exceedingly fore-shortened. But, This pale young gentleman was on This pale young gentleman feet directly, and after sponging This pale young gentleman with a great show  of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest surprise I have ever had  in my life was seeing This pale young gentleman on his back again, looking up at This pale young gentleman out of a black  eye. This pale young gentleman spirit inspired me with great respect. This pale young gentleman seemed to have no strength, and  This pale young gentleman never once hit me hard, and This pale young gentleman was always knocked down; but This pale young gentleman would be up  again in a moment, sponging This pale young gentleman or drinking out of the water-bottle, with  the greatest satisfaction in seconding This pale young gentleman according to form, and then came  at This pale young gentleman with an air and a show that made me believe This pale young gentleman really was going to do for  me at last. This pale young gentleman got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I  hit This pale young gentleman, the harder I hit This pale young gentleman; but This pale young gentleman came up again and again and again, until  at last This pale young gentleman got a bad fall with the back of This pale young gentleman head against the wall. Even  after that crisis in our affairs, This pale young gentleman got up and turned round and round  confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was; but finally went on This pale young gentleman knees  to This pale young gentleman sponge and threw his sponge up: at the same time panting out, "That means you  have won." This pale young gentleman seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the contest,  I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go so far as to hope  that I regarded This pale young gentleman while dressing as a species of savage young wolf or  other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly wiping my sanguinary face at  intervals, and I said, "Can I help you?" and This pale young gentleman said "No thankee," and I said  "Good afternoon," and This pale young gentleman said "Same to you." When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys. But Estella  neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept Estella waiting; and there  was a bright flush upon Estella face, as though something had happened to delight  Estella. Instead of going straight to the gate, too, Estella stepped back into the  passage, and beckoned me. "Come here! You may kiss me, if you like." I kissed Estella cheek as Estella turned her cheek to you. I think I would have gone through a  great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse  common boy as a piece of money might have been, and that the kiss was worth nothing. What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with the  fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light on the  spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black  night-sky, and Joe's furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road.
