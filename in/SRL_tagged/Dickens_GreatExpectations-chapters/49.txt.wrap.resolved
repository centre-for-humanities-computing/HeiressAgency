 Putting Miss Havisham's note in my pocket, that it might serve as my  credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her waywardness  should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I went down again by the  coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway House, and breakfasted there, and  walked the rest of the distance; for I sought to get into the town quietly by  the unfrequented ways, and to leave it in the same manner. The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing courts  behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old monks had once had  the old monks refectories and gardens, and where the strong walls were now pressed into  the service of humble sheds and stables, were almost as silent as the old monks  in The nooks of ruin where the old monks had once had  their refectories and gardens, and where the strong walls were now pressed into  the service of humble sheds and stables graves. The cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote  sound to me, as I hurried on avoiding observation, than The cathedral chimes had ever had  before; so, the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music;  and the rooks, as The cathedral chimes hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high  trees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was changed,  and that Estella was gone out of the place for ever. An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who lived in  the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the gate. The lighted  candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old, and I took The lighted  candle up and  ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was not in Miss Havisham own room, but was in  the larger room across the landing. Looking in at the door, after knocking in  vain, I saw Miss Havisham sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost  in the contemplation of, the ashy fire. Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old chimney-piece,  where Miss Havisham could see me when Miss Havisham raised Miss Havisham eyes. There was an air of utter  loneliness upon Miss Havisham, that would have moved me to pity though Miss Havisham had wilfully  done me a deeper injury than I could charge Miss Havisham with. As I stood  compassionating Miss Havisham, and thinking how, in the progress of time, I too had come  to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me. Miss Havisham  stared, and said in a low voice, "Is it real?" "It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost no  time." "Thank you. Thank you." As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I  remarked a new expression on Miss Havisham face, as if Miss Havisham were afraid of me. "I want," Miss Havisham said, "to pursue that subject you mentioned to Miss Havisham when you were  last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But perhaps you can never  believe, now, that there is anything human in my heart?" When I said some reassuring words, Miss Havisham stretched out Miss Havisham tremulous right hand,  as though Miss Havisham was going to touch me; but Miss Havisham recalled it again before I  understood the action, or knew how to receive it. "You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do something  useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it not?" "Something that I would like done very much." "What is it?" I began explaining to Miss Havisham that secret history of the partnership. I had not got  far into it, when I judged from Miss Havisham looks that Miss Havisham was thinking in a discursive  way of Miss Havisham, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be so; for, when I stopped  speaking, many moments passed before Miss Havisham showed that Miss Havisham was conscious of the  fact. "Do you break off," Miss Havisham asked then, with Miss Havisham former air of being afraid of Miss Havisham,  "because you hate me too much to bear to speak to Miss Havisham?" "No, no," I answered, "how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped because I  thought you were not following what I said." "Perhaps I was not," Miss Havisham answered, putting a hand to Miss Havisham head. "Begin again,  and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me." Miss Havisham set Miss Havisham hand upon Miss Havisham stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual  to Miss Havisham, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing Miss Havisham to  attend. I went on with my explanation, and told Miss Havisham how I had hoped to complete  the transaction out of my means, but how in this I was disappointed. That part  of the subject (I reminded Miss Havisham) involved matters which could form no part of my  explanation, for they were the weighty secrets of another. "So!" said Miss Havisham, assenting with her head, but not looking at Miss Havisham. "And how much  money is wanting to complete the purchase?" I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. "Nine hundred  pounds." "If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as you have  kept your own?" "Quite as faithfully." "And your mind will be more at rest?" "Much more at rest." "Are you very unhappy now?" She asked this question, still without looking at Miss Havisham, but in an unwonted tone  of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my voice failed me. She put  She left arm across the head of She stick, and softly laid She forehead on her left arm. "I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of disquiet than  any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned." After a little while, She raised She , and looked at the fire again. "It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness, Is it  true?" "Too true." "Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as done, is  there nothing I can do for you you?" "Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the tone of  the question. But there is nothing." She presently rose from She seat, and looked about the blighted room for the  means of writing. There were none there, and She took from She pocket a yellow  set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and wrote upon them with a  pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from She neck. "You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?" "Quite. I dined with Mr. Jaggers yesterday." "This is an authority to Mr. Jaggers to pay you that money, to lay out at your  irresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if you  would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send no money to Mr. Jaggers." "Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving no money from  him." Miss Havisham read me what Miss Havisham had written; and it was direct and clear, and evidently  intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the  money. I took the tablets from Miss Havisham hand, and the tablets trembled again, and the tablets trembled  more as Miss Havisham took off the chain to which the pencil was attached, and put the pencil in  mine. All this Miss Havisham did without looking at me. "My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under My name, "I forgive  Miss Havisham," though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do it!" "O Miss Havisham," said I, "I can do it now. There have been sore mistakes; and  my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want forgiveness and  direction far too much, to be bitter with you." Miss Havisham turned Miss Havisham face to me for the first time since Miss Havisham had averted her face, and, to  my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on Miss Havisham knees at my feet;  with Miss Havisham folded hands raised to me in the manner in which, when Miss Havisham poor heart  was young and fresh and whole, they must often have been raised to heaven from  Miss Havisham mother's side. To see Miss Havisham with Miss Havisham white hair and Miss Havisham worn face kneeling at my feet gave me a  shock through all my frame. I entreated Miss Havisham to rise, and got my arms about Miss Havisham  to help Miss Havisham up; but Miss Havisham only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to Miss Havisham  grasp, and hung Miss Havisham head over her head and wept. I had never seen Miss Havisham shed a tear  before, and, in the hope that the relief might do Miss Havisham good, I bent over Miss Havisham  without speaking. Miss Havisham was not kneeling now, but was down upon the ground. "O!" Miss Havisham cried, despairingly. "What have I done! What have I done!" "If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me answer.  Very little. I should have loved Miss Havisham under any circumstances. Is Miss Havisham married?" "Yes." It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house had told  me so. "What have I done! What have I done!" Miss Havisham wrung Miss Havisham hands, and crushed her white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. "What have I done!" I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort Miss Havisham. That Miss Havisham had done a grievous  thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that Miss Havisham wild  resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found vengeance in, I knew  full well. But that, in shutting out the light of day, Miss Havisham had shut out  infinitely more; that, in seclusion, Miss Havisham had secluded Miss Havisham from a thousand  natural and healing influences; that, Miss Havisham mind, brooding solitary, had grown  diseased, as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of  their Maker, I knew equally well. And could I look upon Miss Havisham without compassion,  seeing Miss Havisham punishment in the ruin Miss Havisham was, in Miss Havisham profound unfitness for this  earth on which Miss Havisham was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become a  master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse, the vanity  of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this  world? "Until you spoke to Miss Havisham the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass  that showed me what I once felt you, I did not know what I had done. What  have I done! What have I done!" And so again, twenty, fifty times over, What  had Miss Havisham done! "Miss Havisham," I said, when Miss Havisham cry had died away, "you may dismiss me from  your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and if you can ever  undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of Miss Havisham right  nature away from Miss Havisham, it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past  through a hundred years." "Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip—my dear!" There was an earnest womanly  compassion for me in Miss Havisham new affection. "My dear! Believe this: when Miss Havisham first  came to me, I meant to save Miss Havisham from misery like my own. At first, I meant no  more." "Well, well!" said I. "I hope so." "But as Miss Havisham grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did worse, and  with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings, and with this  figure of me always before Miss Havisham, a warning to back and point my lessons, I  stole Miss Havisham heart away, and put ice in her heart place." "Better," I could not help saying, "to have left Miss Havisham a natural heart, even to  be bruised or broken." With that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and then burst  out again, What had Miss Havisham done! "If you knew all my story," Miss Havisham pleaded, "you would have some compassion for me  and a better understanding of me." "Miss Havisham," I answered, as delicately as I could, "I believe I may say  that I do know your story, and have known your story ever since I first left this  neighborhood. your story has inspired me with great commiseration, and I hope I  understand your story and your story influences. Does what has passed between us give me any  excuse for asking you a question relative to Estella? Not as Estella is, but as Estella  was when Estella first came here?" Estella was seated on the ground, with Estella arms on the ragged chair, and Estella head  leaning on them. Estella looked full at me when I said this, and replied, "Go on." "Whose child was Estella?" Estella shook her head  . "You don't know?" Estella shook her head   again. "But Mr. Jaggers brought Estella here, or sent Estella here?" "Brought Estella here." "Will you tell me how that came about?" Estella answered in a low whisper and with caution: "I had been shut up in these  rooms a long time (I don't know how long; you know what time the clocks keep  here), when I told Mr. Jaggers that I wanted a little girl to rear and love, and save  from my fate. I had first seen Mr. Jaggers when I sent for Mr. Jaggers to lay this place waste  for me; having read of Mr. Jaggers in the newspapers, before I and the world parted. Mr. Jaggers  told me that Mr. Jaggers would look about Mr. Jaggers for such an orphan child. One night Mr. Jaggers  brought Estella here asleep, and I called Estella Estella." "Might I ask Estella age then?" "Two or three. Estella herself knows nothing, but that Estella was left an orphan and I  adopted Estella." So convinced I was of that woman's being that woman mother, that I wanted no evidence  to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I thought, the  connection here was clear and straight. What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had succeeded on  behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew of Estella, I had  said and done what I could to ease she mind. No matter with what other words we  parted; we parted. Twilight was closing in when I went down stairs into the natural air. I called  to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I would not trouble  she just yet, but would walk round the place before leaving. For I had a  presentiment that I should never be there again, and I felt that the dying  light was suited to my last view of the dying  light. By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which the rain  of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and leaving miniature  swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on end, I made my way to the  ruined garden. I went all round it; round by the corner where Herbert and I had  fought our battle; round by the paths where Estella and I had walked. So cold,  so lonely, so dreary all! Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little door at  the garden end of the brewery, and walked through. I was going out at the opposite  door,—not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started and swelled, and  the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of  fungus,—when I turned her head   to look back. A childish association revived  with wonderful force in the moment of the slight action, and I fancied that I  saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam. So strong was the impression, that I  stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a  fancy,—though to be sure I was there in an instant. The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this illusion,  though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an indescribable awe as I came  out between the open wooden gates where I had once wrung my hair after Estella  had wrung my broken heart. Passing on into the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to  call that woman to let me out at the locked gate of which that woman had the key, or  first to go up stairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well  as I had left that woman. I took the latter course and went up. I looked into the room where I had left that woman, and I saw that woman seated in the ragged  chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with that woman back towards myself. In the  moment when I was withdrawing her head   to go quietly away, I saw a great flaming  light spring up. In the same moment I saw that woman running at myself, shrieking, with a  whirl of fire blazing all about that woman, and soaring at least as many feet above  that woman as that woman was high. I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat. That I  got them off, closed with that woman, threw that woman down, and got them over that woman; that I  dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose, and with the great cloth  dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and all the ugly things that  sheltered there; that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies,  and that the closer I covered that woman, the more wildly that woman shrieked and tried to  free herself,—that this occurred I knew through the result, but not through  anything I felt, or thought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we  were on the floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight  were floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been that woman faded bridal  dress. Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away  over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door. I  still held that woman forcibly down with all my strength, like a prisoner who might  escape; and I doubt if I knew that we  were on the floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight  were floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded bridal  dress. that woman was insensible, and I was afraid to have that woman moved, or even touched.  Assistance was sent for, and I held that woman until it came, as if I unreasonably  fancied (I think I did) that, if I let that woman go, the fire would break out again  and consume that woman. When I got up, on the surgeon's coming to that woman with other aid,  I was astonished to see that both my hands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge  of it through the sense of feeling. On examination it was pronounced that that woman had received serious hurts, but that  they of they were far from hopeless; the danger lay mainly in the nervous  shock. By the surgeon's directions, that woman bed was carried into the room where I had left her and laid  upon the great table, which happened to be well suited to the dressing of that woman  injuries. When I saw that woman again, an hour afterwards, that woman lay, indeed, where I  had seen that woman strike that woman stick, and had heard that woman say that that woman would lie one day. Though every vestige of that woman dress was burnt, as they told me, that woman still had  something of that woman old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had covered that woman to  the throat with white cotton-wool, and as that woman lay with a white sheet loosely  overlying that, the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was  still upon that woman. I found, on questioning the servants, that Estella   was in Paris, and I got a  promise from the surgeon that he would write to that woman by the next post. Miss  Havisham's family I took upon Miss  Havisham's family; intending to communicate with Mr. Matthew  Pocket only, and leave Mr. Matthew   to do as Mr. Matthew   liked about informing the rest. This I  did next day, through Herbert, as soon as I returned to town. There was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had  happened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she began  to wander in she speech; and after that it gradually set in that she said  innumerable times in a low solemn voice, "What have I done!" And then, "When  she first came, I meant to save she from misery like mine." And then, "Take the  pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive she!'" she never changed the order  of these three sentences, but she sometimes left out a word in one or other of  them; never putting in another word, but always leaving a blank and going on to  a word. As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that pressing reason  for anxiety and fear which even she wanderings could not drive out of my mind,  I decided, in the course of the night that I would return by the early morning  coach, walking on a mile or so, and being taken up clear of town. At about  six o'clock of the morning, therefore, I leaned over she and touched she lips  with mine, just as they said, not stopping for being touched, "Take the pencil  and write under my name, 'I forgive she.'"
