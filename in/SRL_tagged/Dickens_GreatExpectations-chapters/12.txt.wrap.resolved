 My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman. The more I  thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman on the pale young gentleman back in  various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the more certain it  appeared that something would be done to me. I felt that the pale young  gentleman's blood was on my head, and that the Law would avenge the Law. Without  having any definite idea of the penalties I had incurred, it was clear to me  that village boys could not go stalking about the country, ravaging the houses  of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of England, without laying  village boys open to severe punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home,  and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation  before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce  upon me. the pale young gentleman's nose had stained my trousers, and I tried  to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night. I had cut my  knuckles against the pale young gentleman's teeth, and I twisted my imagination  into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of accounting for that  damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before the Judges. When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of violence, my  terrors reached violence height. Whether myrmidons of Justice, specially sent down  from London, would be lying in ambush behind the gate;—whether Miss Havisham,  preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to her house, might  rise in those grave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me  dead:—whether suborned boys—a numerous band of mercenaries—might be  engaged to fall upon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;—it  was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman,  that I never imagined him accessory to these retaliations; they always came  into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of him, goaded on by the  state of him visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features. However, go to Miss Havisham's I must, and go I did. And behold! nothing came  of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale young  gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I found the same gate open, and  I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows of the detached house;  but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within, and all was  lifeless. Only in the corner where the combat had taken place could I detect  any evidence of the young gentleman's existence. There were traces of his gore  in that spot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man. On the broad landing between Miss Havisham's own room and that other room in  which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,—a light chair on  wheels, that you pushed from behind. a garden-chair,—a light chair on  wheels had been placed there since my last  visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular occupation of pushing Miss  Havisham in a garden-chair,—a light chair on  wheels (when Miss   was tired of walking with Miss   hand upon my  shoulder) round Miss   own room, and across the landing, and round the other room.  Over and over and over again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes these journeys  would last as long as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a  general mention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled  that I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes, and  because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months. As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me,  and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be? I  told Miss Havisham I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I believed; and I enlarged upon  my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that Miss Havisham might  offer some help towards that desirable end. But Miss Havisham did not; on the contrary,  Miss Havisham seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither did Miss Havisham ever give me any  money,—or anything but my daily dinner,—nor ever stipulate that I should be  paid for my services. Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me I  might kiss Estella again. Sometimes, Estella would coldly tolerate me; sometimes, Estella  would condescend to me; sometimes, Estella would be quite familiar with me;  sometimes, Estella would tell me energetically that Estella hated me. Miss Havishamwould often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, "Does Estella grow prettier  and prettier, Pip?" And when I said yes (for indeed Estella did), would seem to  enjoy indeed she did) greedily. Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham Miss Havisham would look on,  with a miserly relish of Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes,  when Estella moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was  puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace Miss Havisham with lavish  fondness, murmuring something in Miss Havisham ear that sounded like "Break their hearts  my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!" There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the burden  was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering homage to a  patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation towards smiths. It  was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron, and was a mere  lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem respected name. Thus, you  were to hammer boys round—Old Clem! With a thump and a sound—Old Clem! Beat  it out, beat it out—Old Clem! With a clink for the stout—Old Clem! Blow the  fire, blow the fire—Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher—Old Clem! One  day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to  me, with the impatient movement of Miss Havisham fingers, "There, there, there! Sing!" I  was surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed Miss Havisham over the floor. It  happened so to catch Miss Havisham fancy that Miss Havisham took it up in a low brooding voice as  if Miss Havisham were singing in Miss Havisham sleep. After that, it became customary with us to  have it as us moved about, and Estella would often join in; though the whole  strain was so subdued, even when there were three of us, that the whole  strain made less  noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind. What could I become with these surroundings? How could my character fail to be  influenced by these surroundings? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed, as my  eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms? Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had not  previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I had  confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly fail to  discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger to be put into  the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of Joe. Besides, that  shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed, which had come upon  me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time went on. I reposed complete  confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came  natural to me to do so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told  Biddy, I did not know then, though I think I know now. Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost  insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass, Pumblechook, used  often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my prospects with  my sister; and I really do believe (to this hour with less penitence than I  ought to feel), that if these hands could have taken a linchpin out of his  chaise-cart, these hands would have done it. The miserable man was a man of that  confined stolidity of mind, that The miserable man could not discuss my prospects without  having me before him,—as it were, to operate upon,—and The miserable man would drag me up  from my stool (usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and,  putting me before the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by  saying, "Now, Mum, here is The miserable man! Here is this boy which you brought up by  hand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which so did  do. Now, Mum, with respections to The miserable man!" And then The miserable man would rumple my hair  the wrong way,—which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted, I have  in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do,—and would hold me  before The miserable man by the sleeve,—a spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by  The miserable man. Then, The miserable man and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations about  Miss Havisham, and about what my sister would do with me and for me, that I used to  want—quite painfully—to burst into spiteful tears, fly at Pumblechook, and  pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister spoke to my sister as if my sister were  morally wrenching one of my teeth out at every reference; while Pumblechook  himself, self-constituted my patron, would sit supervising me with a  depreciatory eye, like the architect of my fortunes who thought himself engaged  on a very unremunerative job. In these discussions, Joe bore no part. But Joe was often talked at, while they  were in progress, by reason of Joe's perceiving that Joe was not favorable  to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old enough now to be apprenticed  to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on Joe knees thoughtfully raking out  the ashes between the lower bars, my sister would so distinctly construe that  innocent action into opposition on Joe part, that my sister would dive at Joe, take  the poker out of Joe hands, shake Joe, and put the poker away. There was a most  irritating end to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to  lead up to it, my sister would stop my sister in a yawn, and catching sight of me  as it were incidentally, would swoop upon my sister with, "Come! there's enough of  you! You get along to bed; you've given trouble enough for one night, I hope!"  As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out. We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that We should  continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss Havisham  stopped short as my sister and I were walking, my sister leaning on my shoulder; and said  with some displeasure,— "You are growing tall, Pip!" I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that this  might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control. my sister said no more at the time; but my sister presently stopped and looked at my sister again;  and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and moody. On the next day  of my attendance, when We usual exercise was over, and I had landed my sister at my sister  dressing-table, my sister stayed me with a movement of my sister impatient fingers:— "Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours." "Joe Gargery, ma'am." "Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?" "Yes, Miss Havisham." "You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with you, and  bring your indentures, do you think?" I signified that I had no doubt Gargery would take it as an honor to be asked. "Then let Gargery come." "At any particular time, Miss Havisham?" "There, there! I know nothing about times. Let Gargery come soon, and come along  with you." When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister "went  on the Rampage," in a more alarming degree than at any previous period. She  asked me and Joe whether we supposed She was door-mats under we feet, and how  we dared to use She so, and what company we graciously thought She was fit for?  When She had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries, She threw a candlestick at  Joe, burst into a loud sobbing, got out the dustpan,—which was always a very  bad sign,—put on She coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible  extent. Not satisfied with a dry cleaning, She took to a pail and  scrubbing-brush, and cleaned we out of house and home, so that we stood  shivering in the back-yard. It was ten o'clock at night before we ventured to  creep in again, and then She asked Joe why Joe hadn't married a Negress Slave at  once? Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling Joe whisker and  looking dejectedly at Joe, as if Joe thought it really might have been a better  speculation.
