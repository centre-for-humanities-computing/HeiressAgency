 In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of Herbert,  when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I recounted the whole of  the secret.
Enough, that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herbert's face, and  not least among them, my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for he.
What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there had been  no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.
Saving his  troublesome sense of having been "low" on one occasion since his return,—on  which point his began to hold forth to Herbert, the moment my revelation was  finished,—he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault  with my good fortune.
his boast that his had made me a gentleman, and that his  had come to see me support the character on the character ample resources, was made for  me quite as much as for the character.
And that it was a highly agreeable boast to  both of us, and that us must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite  established in the character own mind.
"Though, look'ee here, Pip's comrade," his said to Herbert, after having  discoursed for some time, "I know very well that once since I come back—for  half a minute—I've been low.
I said to Pip, I knowed as I had been low.
But  don't you fret yourself on that score.
I ain't made Pip a gentleman, and Pip  ain't a going to make you a gentleman, not fur me not to know what's due to ye  both.
Dear boy, and Pip's comrade, you two may count upon me always having a  gen-teel muzzle on.
Muzzled I have been since that half a minute when I was  betrayed into lowness, muzzled I am at the present time, muzzled I ever will  be."
Herbert said, "Certainly," but looked as if there were no specific consolation  in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed.
We were anxious for the time when  Herbert would go to Herbert lodging and leave We together, but Herbert was evidently jealous  of leaving We together, and sat late.
It was midnight before I took Herbert round  to Essex Street, and saw Herbert safely in at Herbert own dark door.
When his own dark door closed  upon Herbert, I experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night  of Herbert arrival.
Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs, I had  always looked about yourself in taking my guest out after dark, and in bringing my guest  back; and I looked about yourself now.
Difficult as it is in a large city to avoid  the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is conscious of danger in that  regard, I could not persuade yourself that any of the people within sight cared  about my movements.
The few who were passing passed on any of the people within sight cared  about my movements several ways, and  the street was empty when I turned back into the Temple.
Nobody had come out at  the gate with us, nobody went in at the gate with us with yourself.
As I crossed by the  fountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and, when I  stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before  going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase  was when I ascended Garden Court.
Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so blessedly  what it is to have a friend.
When Herbert had spoken some sound words of sympathy  and encouragement, we sat down to consider the question, What was to be done?
The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where The chair that Provis had occupied had stood,—for Provis  had a barrack way with Provis of hanging about one spot, in one unsettled manner,  and going through one round of observances with Provis pipe and Provis negro-head and  Provis jackknife and Provis pack of cards, and what not, as if it were all put down  for Provis on a slate,—I say Provis remaining where it had stood, Herbertunconsciously took it, but next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and  took another.
Herbert had no occasion to say after that that Herbert had conceived an  aversion for my patron, neither had I occasion to confess my own.
We  interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable.
"What," said I to Herbert, when Herbert was safe in another chair,—"what is to be  done?"
"My poor dear Handel," Herbert replied, holding Herbert head, "I am too stunned to  think."
"So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell.
Still, something must be done.
Herbert  is intent upon various new expenses,—horses, and carriages, and lavish  appearances of all kinds.
Herbert must be stopped somehow."
"You mean that you can't accept—" "How can I?"
I interposed, as Herbert paused.
"Think of Herbert!
Look at Herbert!"
An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.
"Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that Herbert is attached to me,  strongly attached to me.
Was there ever such a fate!"
"My poor dear Handel," Herbert repeated.
"Then," said I, "after all, stopping short here, never taking another penny  from Herbert, think what I owe Herbert already!
Then again: I am heavily in  debt,—very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,—and I have been  bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing."
"Well, well, well!"
Herbert remonstrated.
"Don't say fit for nothing."
"What am I fit for?
I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that is, to go  for a soldier.
And I might have gone, Herbert, but for the prospect of  taking counsel with your friendship and affection."
Of course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a warm grip  of my hand, pretended not to know it.
"Anyhow, my dear Handel," said he presently, "soldiering won't do.
If you were  to renounce this patronage and these favors, I suppose you would do so with  some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had.
Not very strong,  that hope, if you went soldiering!
Besides, it's absurd.
You would be  infinitely better in Clarriker's house, small as it is.
I am working up towards  a partnership, you know."
Poor fellow!
Poor fellow little suspected with whose money.
"But there is another question," said Herbert.
"This is an ignorant, determined  man, who has long had one fixed idea.
More than that, Poor fellow seems to Herbert (I may  misjudge Poor fellow) to be a man of a desperate and fierce character."
"I know Poor fellow is," I returned.
"Let me tell you what evidence I have seen of what evidence."
And I told Poor fellow what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of that encounter with  the other convict.
"See, then," said Herbert; "think of this!
Herbert comes here at the peril of Herbert  life, for the realization of Herbert fixed idea.
In the moment of realization,  after all Herbert toil and waiting, you cut the ground from under Herbert feet, destroy  Herbert idea, and make Herbert gains worthless to Herbert.
Do you see nothing that Herbert might  do, under the disappointment?"
"I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night of Herbert  arrival.
Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as Herbert putting Herbert  in the way of being taken."
"Then you may rely upon it," said Herbert, "that there would be great danger of  Herbert doing it.
That is Herbert power over you as long as Herbert remains in England, and  that would be Herbert reckless course if you forsook Herbert."
I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me from the  first, and the working out of which would make me regard me, in some sort,  as Herbert murderer, that I could not rest in my chair, but began pacing to and  fro.
I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that even if Provis were recognized and  taken, in spite of Herbert, I should be wretched as the cause, however  innocently.
Yes; even though I was so wretched in having Herbert at large and near  me, and even though I would far rather have worked at the forge all the days of  my life than I would ever have come to this!
But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?
"The first and the main thing to be done," said Herbert, "is to get Herbert out of  England.
You will have to go with Herbert, and then Herbert may be induced to go."
"But get Herbert where I will, could I prevent Herbert coming back?"
"My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street, there  must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to Herbert and making Herbert  reckless, here, than elsewhere.
If a pretext to get Herbert away could be made out  of that other convict, or out of anything else in Herbert life, now."
"There, again!"
said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands held out,  as if they contained the desperation of the case.
"I know nothing of Herbert life.
It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see Herbert before me, so  bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so unknown to me, except as  the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood!"
Herbert got up, and linked Herbert arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and fro  together, studying the carpet.
"My poor dear Handel," said Herbert, stopping, "you feel convinced that you can take no  further benefits from Herbert; do you?"
"Fully.
Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?"
"And you feel convinced that you must break with Herbert?"
"Herbert, can you ask me?"
"And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life Herbert has  risked on your account, that you must save Herbert, if possible, from throwing it  away.
Then you must get Herbert out of England before you stir a finger to  extricate yourself.
That done, extricate yourself, in Heaven's name, and we'll  see it out together, dear old boy."
It was a comfort to shake hands upon It, and walk up and down again, with only  that done.
"Now, Herbert," said I, "with reference to gaining some knowledge of Herbert  history.
There is but one way that I know of.
I must ask Herbert point blank."
"Yes.
Ask Herbert," said Herbert, "when we sit at breakfast in the morning."
For Herbert  had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that Herbert would come to breakfast with we.
With this project formed, we went to bed.
I had the wildest dreams concerning  him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear which I had lost in  the night, of him being found out as a returned transport.
Waking, I never lost  the fear which I had lost in  the night.
him came round at the appointed time, took out him jackknife, and sat down to  him meal.
him was full of plans "for him gentleman's coming out strong, and like  a gentleman," and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocket-book which him had  left in my possession.
him considered the chambers and him own lodging as  temporary residences, and advised me to look out at once for a "fashionable  crib" near Hyde Park, in which him could have "a shake-down."
When him had made  an end of him breakfast, and was wiping him knife on him leg, I said to him,  without a word of preface,— "After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that the  soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up.
You remember?"
"Remember!"
said him.
"I think so!"
"we want to know something about that man—and about you.
It is strange to  know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to tell last  night.
Is not this as good a time as another for we knowing more?"
"Well!"
him said, after consideration.
"You're on your oath, you know, Pip's  comrade?"
"Assuredly," replied Herbert.
"As to anything I say, you know," Herbert insisted.
"your oath applies to all."
"I understand it to do so."
"And look'ee here!
Wotever I done is worked out and paid for," Wotever I done insisted  again.
"So be it."
Wotever I done took out Wotever I done black pipe and was going to fill his black pipe with negro-head, when,  looking at the tangle of tobacco in Wotever I done hand, Wotever I done seemed to think his black pipe might  perplex the thread of Wotever I done narrative.
Wotever I done put his black pipe back again, stuck his black pipe in a  button-hole of Wotever I done coat, spread a hand on each knee, and after turning an angry  eye on the fire for a few silent moments, looked round at us and said what  follows.
