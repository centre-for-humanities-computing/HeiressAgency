 My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so unexpectedly  exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I hope frank disclosure had some dregs  of good at the bottom of frank disclosure.
I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to Mrs.  Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me.
But I loved  Joe,—perhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear  fellow let me love him,—and, as to the dear  fellow, my inner self was not so easily  composed.
It was much upon my mind (particularly when I first saw the dear  fellow looking  about for the dear  fellow file) that I ought to tell Joe the whole truth.
Yet I did not,  and for the reason that I mistrusted that if I did, Joe would think me worse  than I was.
The fear of losing Joe's confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in  the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and  friend, tied up my tongue.
I morbidly represented to me that if Joe knew  it, I never afterwards could see Joe at the fireside feeling Joe fair whisker,  without thinking that Joe was meditating on it.
That, if Joe knew it, I never  afterwards could see Joe glance, however casually, at yesterday's meat or  pudding when it came on to-day's table, without thinking that Joe was debating  whether I had been in the pantry.
That, if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent  period of our joint domestic life remarked that Joe beer was flat or thick, the  conviction that Joe suspected Tar in his beer, would bring a rush of blood to my face.
In a word, I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too  cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong.
I had had no intercourse with  the world at that time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in  this manner.
Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of  action for myself.
As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took me on  Joe back again and carried me home.
Joe must have had a tiresome journey of it,  for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad temper that if the  Church had been thrown open, Joe would probably have excommunicated the whole  expedition, beginning with Joe and myself.
In Joe lay capacity, Joe persisted in  sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent, that when Joe coat was taken  off to be dried at the kitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on Joe  trousers would have hanged Joe, if it had been a capital offence.
By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard,  through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having been fast  asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of tongues.
As I  came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders, and the  restorative exclamation "Yah!
Was there ever such a boy as this!"
from my  sister,) I found Joe telling them about the convict's confession, and all the  visitors suggesting different ways by which Joe had got into the pantry.
Mr.  Pumblechook made out, after carefully surveying the premises, that Pumblechook had first  got upon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the house,  and had then let Pumblechook down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of Pumblechook bedding  cut into strips; and as Pumblechook was very positive and drove Pumblechook own  chaise-cart—over Everybody—it was agreed that it must be so.
Mr. Wopsle,  indeed, wildly cried out, "No!"
with the feeble malice of a tired man; but, as  Mr. Wopsle had no theory, and no coat on, Mr. Wopsle was unanimously set at naught,—not to  mention Mr. Wopsle smoking hard behind, as Mr. Wopsle stood with Mr. Wopsle back to the kitchen fire  to draw the damp out: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.
This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a slumberous  offence to the company's eyesight, and assisted me up to bed with such a strong  hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be dangling fifty boots on against  the edges of the stairs.
My state of mind, as I have described it, began before  I was up in the morning, and lasted long after the subject had died out, and  had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasions.
