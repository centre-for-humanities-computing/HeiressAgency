 The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke, that the  best step I could take towards making me uncommon was to get out of Biddy  everything Biddy   knew.
In pursuance of this luminous conception I mentioned to  Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's at night, that I had a  particular reason for wishing to get on in life, and that I should feel very  much obliged to Biddy   if Biddy   would impart all Biddy   learning to me.
Biddy, who was  the most obliging of girls, immediately said Biddy   would, and indeed began to  carry out Biddy   promise within five minutes.
The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt may be  resolved into the following synopsis.
The pupils ate apples and put straws down  one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt collected Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt energies, and  made an indiscriminate totter at indiscriminate with a birch-rod.
After receiving the  charge with every mark of derision, the pupils formed in line and buzzingly  passed a ragged book from hand to hand.
a ragged book had an alphabet in a ragged book, some  figures and tables, and a little spelling,—that is to say, a ragged book had had once.
As soon as this volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a  state of coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm.
The pupilsthen entered among The pupils upon a competitive examination on the subject of  Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose  toes.
This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at them and  distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if them had been unskilfully cut  off the chump end of something), more illegibly printed at the best than any  curiosities of literature I have since met with, speckled all over with  ironmould, and having various specimens of the insect world smashed between  various specimens of the insect world leaves.
This part of the Course was usually lightened by several single  combats between Biddy and refractory students.
When the fights were over, Biddygave out the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we all could,—or  what we all couldn't—in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high, shrill,  monotonous voice, and none of we all having the least notion of, or reverence for,  what we all were reading about.
When this horrible din had lasted a certain time,  this horrible din mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, who staggered at a boy  fortuitously, and pulled Mr. Wopsle ears.
This was understood to terminate the Course  for the evening, and we all emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual  victory.
It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition against any pupil's  entertaining any pupil's   with a slate or even with the ink (when there was any),  but that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season,  on account of the little general shop in which the classes were holden—and  which was also Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's sitting-room and bedchamber—being  but faintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and  no snuffers.
It appeared to me that It would take time to become uncommon, under these  circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try these  , and that very evening Biddy  entered on our special agreement, by imparting some information from Biddy   little  catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist sugar, and lending me, to copy at  home, a large old English D which Biddy   had imitated from the heading of some  newspaper, and which I supposed, until Biddy   told me what it was, to be a design  for a buckle.
Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe liked  sometimes to smoke Joe pipe there.
I had received strict orders from my sister  to call for Joe at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that evening, on my way from  school, and bring Joe home at my peril.
To the Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore,  I directed my steps.
There was a bar at the Three Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk scores  in a bar at the Jolly Bargemen on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to be never paid  off.
some alarmingly long chalk scores  in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to be never paid  off had been there ever since I could remember, and had grown more than I  had.
But there was a quantity of chalk about our country, and perhaps the  people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account.
it being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at these  records; but as my business was with Joe and not with Joe, I merely wished Joe  good evening, and passed into the common room at the end of the passage, where  there was a bright large kitchen fire, and where Joe was smoking Joe pipe in  company with Mr. Wopsle and a stranger.
Joe greeted me as usual with "Halloa,  Pip, old chap!"
and the moment Joe said that, a stranger turned Joe head and  looked at Joe.
Joe was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before.
his head was all on  one side, and one of Joe eyes was half shut up, as if Joe were taking aim at  something with an invisible gun.
Joe had a pipe in Joe mouth, and Joe took a pipe  out, and, after slowly blowing all Joe smoke away and looking hard at me all  the time, nodded.
So, I nodded, and then Joe nodded again, and made room on the  settle beside Joe that I might sit down there.
But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of resort, I  said "No, thank you, sir," and fell into the space Joe made for me on the  opposite settle.
a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before, after glancing at Joe, and seeing that a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before  attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again when I had taken my seat,  and then rubbed a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before leg—in a very odd way, as my seat struck me.
"You was saying," said a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before, turning to Joe, "that you was a  blacksmith."
"Yes.
I said it, you know," said Joe.
"What'll you drink, Mr.—?
You didn't mention your name, by the bye."
Joe mentioned your name now, and a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before called Joe by your name.
"What'll you drink,  Mr. Gargery?
At my expense?
To top up with?"
"Well," said Joe, "to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of drinking  at anybody's expense but my own."
"Habit?
No," returned the stranger, "but once and away, and on a Saturday night  too.
Come!
Put a name to a name, Mr.
Gargery."
"I wouldn't wish to be stiff company," said Joe.
"Rum."
"Rum," repeated the stranger.
"And will the other gentleman originate a  sentiment."
"Rum," said Mr. Wopsle.
"Three Rums!"
cried the stranger, calling to the landlord.
"Glasses round!"
"This other gentleman," observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle, "is a  gentleman that you would like to hear give it out.
Our clerk at church."
"Aha!"
said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me.
"The lonely  church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!"
"That's it," said Joe.
The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over Joe pipe, put Joe legs up  on the settle that Joe had to Joe.
Joe wore a flapping broad-brimmed  traveller's hat, and under a flapping broad-brimmed  traveller's hat a handkerchief tied over Joe head in the manner  of a cap: so that Joe showed no hair.
As Joe looked at the fire, I thought I saw  a cunning expression, followed by a half-laugh, come into Joe face.
"I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a solitary  country towards the river."
"Most marshes is solitary," said Joe.
"No doubt, no doubt.
Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or vagrants of  any sort, out there?"
"No," said Joe; "none but a runaway convict now and then.
And we don't find  "none but a runaway convict now and then, easy.
Eh, Mr.
Wopsle?"
Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented; but not  warmly.
"Seems you have been out after such?"
asked the stranger.
"Once," returned Joe.
"Not that we wanted to take them, you understand; we went  out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip.
Didn't we, Pip?"
"Yes, Joe."
the stranger looked at Joe again,—still cocking the stranger eye, as if the stranger were  expressly taking aim at Joe with the stranger invisible gun,—and said, "the stranger's a likely  young parcel of bones that.
What is it you call the stranger?"
"Pip," said Joe.
"Christened Pip?"
"No, not christened Pip."
"Surname Pip?"
"No," said Joe, "it's a kind of family name what Joe gave Joe when a infant,  and is called by."
"Son of yours?"
"Well," said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in anywise  necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at the Three Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over  pipes,—"well—no.
No, the Three Jolly Bargemen ain't."
"Nevvy?"
said the Three Jolly Bargemen.
"Well," said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, "Joe is  not—no, not to deceive you, Joe is not—my nevvy."
"What the Blue Blazes is Joe?"
asked the stranger.
Which appeared to me to be an  inquiry of unnecessary strength.
Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships, having  professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man might not  marry; and expounded the ties between me and Joe.
Having Mr. Wopsle hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from Richard the  Third, and seemed to think Mr. Wopsle had done quite enough to account for Mr. Wopsle when Mr. Wopsleadded, "—as the poet says."
And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, Mr. Wopsle considered it a  necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eyes.
I  cannot conceive why everybody of Mr. Wopsle standing who visited at our house should  always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar  circumstances.
Yet I do not call to mind that I was ever in my earlier youth  the subject of remark in our social family circle, but some large-handed person  took some such ophthalmic steps to patronize me.
All this while, a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before looked at nobody but me, and looked at a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before as if  a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before were determined to have a shot at a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before at last, and bring me down.
But a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before said  nothing after offering a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before Blue Blazes observation, until the glasses of rum  and water were brought; and then a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before made a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before shot, and a most extraordinary  shot it was.
It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was pointedly  addressed to a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before.
a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before stirred a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before rum and water pointedly at a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before, and a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before tasted  a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before rum and water pointedly at a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before.
And a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before stirred it and a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before tasted it; not with  a spoon that was brought to a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before, but with a file.
a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before did this so that nobody but I saw a file; and when a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before had done a file a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before wiped  a file and put a file in a breast-pocket.
I knew a file to be Joe's file, and I knew  that a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before knew my convict, the moment I saw the instrument.
I sat gazing at a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before,  spell-bound.
But a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before now reclined on a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before settle, taking very little notice of  me, and talking principally about turnips.
There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause before  going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which stimulated  Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays than at other times.
The half-hour and the rum and water running out together, Joe got up to go, and  took me by the hand.
"Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery," said a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before.
"I think I've got a  bright new shilling somewhere in a breast-pocket, and if I have, the boy shall have  a  bright new shilling."
the boy looked a  bright new shilling out from a handful of small change, folded a  bright new shilling in some crumpled  paper, and gave a  bright new shilling to the boy.
"the boy!"
said the boy.
"Mind!
Your own."
I thanked the boy, staring at the boy far beyond the bounds of good manners, and  holding tight to Joe.
Joe gave Joe good-night, and Joe gave Mr. Wopsle good-night  (who went out with us), and Joe gave me only a look with Joe aiming eye,—no,  not a look, for Joe shut it up, but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it.
On the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must have been  all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of the Three Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with Mr. Wopsle mouth wide open, to rinse the  rum out with as much air as possible.
But I was in a manner stupefied by this  turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance, and could think of nothing  else.
My sister was not in a very bad temper when us presented us in the  kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell My sister about  the bright shilling.
"A bad un, I'll be bound," said Joe Joe triumphantly, "or  Joe wouldn't have given it to the boy!
Let's look at it."
I took it out of some crumpled  paper, and it proved to be a good one.
"But what's this?"
said Joe, throwing down the bright shilling and catching up some crumpled  paper.
"Two  One-Pound notes?"
Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have been  on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets in the county.
Joecaught up Joe hat again, and ran with them to the Three Jolly Bargemen to restore  them to them owner.
While Joe was gone, I sat down on my usual stool and looked  vacantly at My sister, feeling pretty sure that Joe would not be there.
Presently, Joe came back, saying that Joe was gone, but that Joe, Joe, had  left word at the Three the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.
Then My sistersealed he, Joe up in a piece of paper, and put he, Joe under some dried rose-leaves  in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in the state parlor.
There he, Joe  remained, a nightmare to me, many and many a night and day.
I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the strange man  taking aim at me with the strange man   invisible gun, and of the guiltily coarse and common  thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts,—a feature in  my low career that I had previously forgotten.
I was haunted by the file too.
A  dread possessed me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear.
I  coaxed me to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham's, next Wednesday; and in  my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held the file,  and I screamed me awake.
