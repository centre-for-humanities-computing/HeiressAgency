 What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving Estella's  parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the question was not  before me in a distinct shape until it was put before me by a wiser head than  my own. But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized with a  feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down,—that I ought not to  let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers, and come at the bare truth. I  really do not know whether I felt that I did this for Estella's sake, or  whether I was glad to transfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much  concerned some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me.  Perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth. Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street that  night. Herbert's representations that, if I did, I should probably be laid up  and stricken useless, when our fugitive's safety would depend upon me, alone  restrained my impatience. On the understanding, again and again reiterated,  that, come what would, I was to go to Mr. Jaggers to-morrow, I at length  submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts looked after, and to stay at  home. Early next morning Herbert and I went out together, and at the corner of Giltspur  Street by Smithfield, I left Herbert to go Herbert way into the City, and took my  way to Little Britain. There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over the  office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things straight. On  these occasions, Wemmick took Wemmick books and papers into Mr. Jaggers's room, and  one of the up-stairs clerks came down into the outer office. Finding such clerk  on Wemmick's post that morning, I knew what was going on; but I was not sorry  to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick together, as Wemmick would then hear for  himself that I said nothing to compromise himself. My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders,  favored my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief account of the  accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give Mr. Jaggers all the  details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry  and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence, than the  accident had  been before. While I described the disaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to  Mr. Jaggers wont, before the fire. Wemmick leaned back in Mr. Jaggers chair, staring at Mr. Jaggers,  with Wemmick hands in the pockets of Wemmick trousers, and Wemmick pen put horizontally  into the post. The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the  official proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether The two brutal casts didn't  smell fire at the present moment. My narrative finished, and The two brutal casts questions exhausted, I then produced Miss  Havisham's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for Herbert. Mr.  Jaggers's eyes retired a little deeper into Jaggers head when I handed Jaggers the  tablets, but Jaggers presently handed The two brutal casts over to Wemmick, with instructions to  draw the check for Jaggers signature. While that was in course of being done, I  looked on at Wemmick as Wemmick wrote, and Mr. Jaggers, poising and swaying Wemmick  on Wemmick well-polished boots, looked on at Wemmick. "I am sorry, Pip," said Wemmick, as I  put the check in my pocket, when Wemmick had signed it, "that we do nothing for Wemmick." "Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me," I returned, "whether Miss Havisham could do  nothing for Wemmick, and I told Miss Havisham No." "Everybody should know his own business," said Jaggers. And I saw Wemmick's  lips form the words "portable property." "I should not have told Miss Havisham No, if I had been you," said Jaggers; "but every  man ought to know his own business best." "Every man's business," said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me, "is  portable property." As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at heart, I  said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:— "I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked Miss Havisham to give me  some information relative to Miss Havisham adopted daughter, and Miss Havisham gave me all Miss Havisham  possessed." "Did Miss Havisham?" said Jaggers, bending forward to look at Jaggers boots and then  straightening Jaggers. "Hah! I don't think I should have done so, if I had been  Miss Havisham. But Miss Havisham ought to know Miss Havisham own business best." "I know more of the history of Miss Havisham's adopted child than Miss Havisham  herself does, sir. I know "Mother." Jaggers looked at Jaggers inquiringly, and repeated "Mother?" "I have seen "Mother within these three days." "Yes?" said Jaggers. "And so have you, sir. And you have seen Miss Havisham still more recently." "Yes?" said Jaggers. "Perhaps I know more of Estella's history than even you do," said I. "I know  Miss Havisham father too." A certain stop that Jaggers came to in Jaggers manner—Jaggers was too  self-possessed to change his manner, but Jaggers could not help his manner being brought to  an indefinably attentive stop—assured me that Jaggers did not know who her father  was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis's account (as Herbert had  repeated it) of Herbert having kept Herbert dark; which I pieced on to the fact  that Herbert himself was not Jaggers's client until some four years later, and  when Herbert could have no reason for claiming Herbert identity. But, I could not be  sure of this unconsciousness on Jaggers's part before, though I was quite  sure of Mr. Jaggers's part now. "So! You know the young lady's father, Pip?" said Jaggers. "Yes," I replied, "and Jaggers name is Provis—from New South Wales." Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest start  that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked,  but Jaggers did start, though Jaggers made it a part of the action of taking out Jaggers  pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the announcement I am unable to say;  for I was afraid to look at Jaggers just then, lest Jaggers's sharpness should  detect that there had been some communication unknown to Jaggers between us. "And on what evidence, Pip," asked Jaggers, very coolly, as Jaggers paused with  Jaggers handkerchief half way to Jaggers nose, "does Provis make this claim?" "Jaggers does not make it," said I, "and has never made it, and has no knowledge or  belief that Jaggers daughter is in existence." For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so Unexpected,  that Jaggers put the handkerchief back into Jaggers pocket without completing  the usual performance, folded Jaggers arms, and looked with stern attention at me,  though with an immovable face. Then I told Jaggers all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation that I  left Jaggers to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact knew from  Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look towards Wemmickuntil I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for some time silently  meeting Mr. Jaggers's look. When I did at last turn my eyes in Wemmickdirection, I found that he had unposted he pen, and was intent upon the table  before he. "Hah!" said Jaggers at last, as Jaggers moved towards the papers on the table.  "What item was What item you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?" But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a passionate,  almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and manly with me. I  reminded him of the false hopes into which I had lapsed, the length of time  they had lasted, and the discovery I had made: and I hinted at the danger that  weighed upon my spirits. I represented myself as being surely worthy of some  little confidence from him, in return for the confidence I had just now  imparted. I said that I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but  I wanted assurance of the truth from him. And if him asked me why I wanted it,  and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as him cared  for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long, and that  although I had lost Estella, and must live a bereaved life, whatever concerned Estella  was still nearer and dearer to myself than anything else in the world. And seeing  that Jaggers stood quite still and silent, and apparently quite obdurate,  under this appeal, I turned to Wemmick, and said, "Wemmick, I know you to be a  man with a gentle heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father,  and all the innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your  business life. And I entreat you to say a word for myself to Mr. Jaggers, and to  represent to Mr. Jaggers that, all circumstances considered, Mr. Jaggers ought to be more open  with myself!" I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr. Jaggers and  Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving crossed me that  Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from Wemmick employment; but Wemmick melted as I  saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder. "What's all this?" said Jaggers. "You with an old father, and you with  pleasant and playful ways?" "Well!" returned Wemmick. "If I don't bring 'em here, what does it matter?" "Pip," said Jaggers, laying Jaggers hand upon my arm, and smiling openly, "this  man must be the most cunning impostor in all London." "Not a bit of it," returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. "I think you're  another." Again they exchanged they former odd looks, each apparently still distrustful  that the other was taking him in. "You with a pleasant home?" said Jaggers. "Since it don't interfere with business," returned Wemmick, "let it be so. Now,  I look at you, sir, I shouldn't wonder if you might be planning and contriving  to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days, when you're tired of all  this work." Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and actually  drew a sigh. "Pip," said Jaggers, "we won't talk about 'poor dreams;' you know more  about such things than Jaggers, having much fresher experience of that kind. But now  about this other matter. I'll put a case to you. Mind! I admit nothing." Jaggers waited for me to declare that I quite understood that Jaggers expressly said that  Jaggers admitted nothing. "Now, Pip," said Jaggers, "put a case. Put the case that a woman, under  such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child concealed, and was  obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser, on her legal adviser representing to  her that her legal adviser must know, with an eye to the latitude of her legal adviser defence, how the fact  stood about her child. Put the case that, at the same time her legal adviser held a trust to  find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up." "I follow you, sir." "Put the case that sir lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all sir saw of  children was  children being generated in great numbers for certain destruction.  Put the case that sir often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar, where  children were held up to be seen; put the case that sir habitually knew of children  being imprisoned, whipped, transported, neglected, cast out, qualified in all  ways for the hangman, and growing up to be hanged. Put the case that pretty  nigh all the children sir saw in sir daily business life sir had reason to look  upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to sir  net,—to be prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow." "I follow you, sir." "Put the case that pretty  nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look  upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his  net,—to, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who  could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make no stir about; as  to whom, over "Mother, the legal adviser had this power: "I know what you  did, and how you did this power. You came so and so, you did such and such things to  divert suspicion. I have tracked you through it all, and I tell it you all.  Part with one pretty little child, unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you,  and then it shall be produced. Give one pretty little child into my hands, and I will do my  best to bring you off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are  lost, your child is still saved." Put the case that this was done, and that the  woman was cleared." "I understand you perfectly." "But that I make no admissions?" "That you make no admissions." And Wemmick repeated, "No admissions." "Put the case that pretty  nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look  upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his  net,—to, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken  the  woman's intellects, and that when the  woman was set at liberty, the  woman was scared  out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be sheltered. Put the case that pretty  nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look  upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his  net,—tothat him took the  woman in, and that him kept down the old, wild, violent nature  whenever him saw an inkling of its breaking out, by asserting him power over the  woman  in the old way. Do you comprehend the case that pretty  nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look  upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his  net,—to?" "Quite." "Put the case that one pretty little child grew up, and was married for money. That the  mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the mother and  father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many miles, furlongs,  yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was still a secret, except  that you had got wind of it. Put the case that pretty  nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look  upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his  net,—to to yourself very carefully." "I do." "I ask Wemmick to put the case that pretty  nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look  upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his  net,—to to Wemmick very carefully." And Wemmick said, "I do." "For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father's? I think Wemmick would  not be much the better for the  mother. For the  mother's? I think if the  mother had  done such a deed the  mother would be safer where the  mother was. For his daughter's? I think  it would hardly serve his daughter to establish his daughter parentage for the information of his daughter  husband, and to drag his daughter back to disgrace, after an escape of twenty years,  pretty secure to last for life. But add the case that you had loved his daughter, Pip,  and had made his daughter the subject of those 'poor dreams' which have, at one time or  another, been in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you  that you had better—and would much sooner when you had thought well of  it—chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand,  and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick, to cut that off too." I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched He lips  with He forefinger. I did the same. Jaggers did the same. "Now, Wemmick,"  said the latter then, resuming Jaggers usual manner, "what item was it you were at  when Mr. Pip came in?" Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the odd  looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with this  difference now, that each of they seemed suspicious, not to say conscious, of  having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other. For this  reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one another; Jaggers being  highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately justifying Jaggers whenever there  was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen they on such  ill terms; for generally they got on very well indeed together. But they were they happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike, the  client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping himself nose on himself sleeve, whom I  had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls. This  individual, who, either in himself own person or in that of some member of himself  family, seemed to be always in trouble (which in that place meant Newgate),  called to announce that himself was taken up on suspicion of  shoplifting. As himself imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the  proceedings, Mike's eye happened to twinkle with a tear. "What are you about?" demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation. "What do  you come snivelling here for?" "I didn't go to do it, Wemmick." "You did," said Wemmick. "How dare you? You're not in a fit state to come here,  if you can't come here without spluttering like a bad pen. What do you mean by  it?" "A man can't help A man feelings, Mr. Wemmick," pleaded Mike. "A man what?" demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. "Say that again!" "Now look here A man," said Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing to the  door. "Get out of this office. I'll have no feelings here. Get out." "It serves you right," said Wemmick, "Get out." So, Mike Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick  appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and went to work  again with an air of refreshment upon their as if their had just had lunch.
