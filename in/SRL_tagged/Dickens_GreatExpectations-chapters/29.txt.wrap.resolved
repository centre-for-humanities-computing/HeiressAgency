 Betimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to Miss  Havisham's, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham's side of  town,—which was not Joe's side; I could go there to-morrow,—thinking about  my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of my patroness plans for me. my patroness had adopted Estella, my patroness had as good as adopted me, and adopted me could not fail  to be my patroness intention to bring us together. my patroness reserved adopted me for me to restore the  desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms, set the clocks a-going  and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down the cobwebs, destroy the vermin,—in  short, do all the shining deeds of the young Knight of romance, and marry the  Princess. I had stopped to look at the  desolate house as I passed; and the  desolate house seared red  brick walls, blocked windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of  chimneys with the  desolate house twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a  rich attractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the inspiration  of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though Estella had taken such strong  possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon Estella, though Estella  influence on my boyish life and character had been all-powerful, I did not,  even that romantic morning, invest Estella with any attributes save those Estella  possessed. I mention this in this place, of a fixed purpose, because it is the  clew by which I am to be followed into my poor labyrinth. According to my  experience, the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The  unqualified truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved  Estella simply because I found Estella irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow,  often and often, if not always, that I loved Estella against reason, against  promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all  discouragement that could be. Once for all; I loved Estella none the less because I  knew her none, and her none had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly  believed Estella to be human perfection. I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When I had  rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the gate, while I  tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet. I  heard the side-door open, and steps come across the courtyard; but I pretended  not to hear, even when the gate swung on the gate rusty hinges. Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started much  more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober gray dress.  a man in a sober gray dress. "Orlick!" "Ah, young master, there's more changes than "Ah, young master. But come in, come in. It's  opposed to my orders to hold the gate open." I entered and "Ah, young master swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. "Yes!" said "Ah, young master,  facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards the house. "Here  I am!" "How did you come here?" "I come her," "Ah, young master retorted, "on my legs. I had my box brought alongside myself in a  barrow." "Are you here for good?" "I ain't here for harm, young master, I suppose?" I was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my mind,  while "Ah, young master slowly lifted "Ah, young master heavy glance from the pavement, up my legs and arms,  to my face. "Then you have left the forge?" I said. "Do this look like a forge?" replied Orlick, sending Orlick glance all round Orlick  with an air of injury. "Now, do it look like it?" I asked Orlick how long Orlick had left Gargery's forge? "One day is so like another here," Orlick replied, "that I don't know without  casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left." "I could have told you that, Orlick." "Ah!" said Orlick, dryly. "But then you've got to be a scholar." By this time we had come to the house, where I found Orlick room to be one just  within the side-door, with a little window in his room looking on the courtyard. In  its small proportions, its was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to  a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were hanging on the wall, to which he now  added the gate key; and he patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner  division or recess. The whole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a  cage for a human dormouse; while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a  corner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted  up,—as indeed he was. "I never saw his room before," I remarked; "but there used to be no Porter  here." "No," said he; "not till his room got about that there was no protection on the  premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and Tag and Rag  and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended to the place as a man  who could give another man as good as another man brought, and I took it. It's easier  than bellowsing and hammering.—That's loaded, that is." My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the  chimney-piece, and My eye had followed mine. "Well," said I, not desirous of more conversation, "shall I go up to Miss  Havisham?" "Burn me, if I know!" My eye retorted, first stretching My eye and then shaking  My eye; "my orders ends here, young master. I give this here bell a rap with  this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till you meet somebody." "I am expected, I believe?" "Burn me twice over, if I can say!" said My eye. Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in my thick  boots, and My eye made My eye bell sound. At the end of the passage, while his bellwas still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who appeared to have now become  constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me. "Oh!" said she. "You, is it, Mr. Pip?" "It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family are all  well." "Are Mr. Pocket and family are all  well any wiser?" said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head; "Mr. Pocket and family are all  well had  better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know your way, sir?" Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I ascended  it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old way at the door of  Miss Havisham's room. "Pip's rap," I heard her say, immediately; "come in, Pip." her was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two hands  crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on the fire.  Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been worn, in her hand,  and her head bent as her looked at it, was an elegant lady whom I had never  seen. "Come in, Pip," Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round or up;  "come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss her hand as if I were a queen,  eh?—Well?" her looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a grimly  playful manner,— "Well?" "I heard, " Miss Havisham," said I, rather at a loss, "that you were so kind as  to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly." "Well?" The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up The lady whom I had never seen before and looked archly at  me, and then I saw that her eyes were Estella's eyes. But The lady whom I had never seen before was so much  changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly, in all things  winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, that I seemed to have made  none. I fancied, as I looked at The lady whom I had never seen before, that I slipped hopelessly back into the  coarse and common boy again. O the sense of distance and disparity that came  upon me, and the inaccessibility that came about The lady whom I had never seen before! The lady whom I had never seen before gave me The lady whom I had never seen before hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in seeing  The lady whom I had never seen before again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a long, long time. "Do you find The lady whom I had never seen before much changed, Pip?" asked " Miss Havisham, with The lady whom I had never seen before greedy look,  and striking The lady whom I had never seen before stick upon a chair that stood between her greedy look, as a sign to me to  sit down there. "When I came in, " Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella in the  face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the old—" "What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?" " Miss Havishaminterrupted. "" Miss Havisham was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away from " Miss Havisham.  Don't you remember?" I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better then, and  the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said Estella had no doubt of  my having been quite right, and of Estella having been very disagreeable. "Is he changed?" " Miss Havisham " Miss Havisham asked Estella. "Very much," said Estella, looking at me. "Less coarse and common?" said " Miss Havisham, playing with Estella's hair. Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in Estella hand, and laughed again, and  looked at me, and put the shoe in her hand down. Estella treated me as a boy still, but Estella  lured me on. We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought  upon me, and I learnt that Estella had but just come home from France, and that Estella  was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old, Estella had brought those  qualities into such subjection to Estella beauty that it was impossible and out of  nature—or I thought so—to separate them from Estella beauty. Truly it was  impossible to dissociate Estella presence from all those wretched hankerings after  money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood,—from all those  ill-regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and  Joe,—from all those visions that had raised Estella face in the glowing fire,  struck it out of the iron on the anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night  to look in at the wooden window of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was  impossible for me to separate Estella, in the past or in the present, from the  innermost life of my life. It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and return to  the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had conversed for a while,  " Miss Havisham sent we two out to walk in the neglected garden: on we coming in  by and by, " Miss Havisham said, I should wheel " Miss Havisham about a little, as in times of yore. So, Estella and I went out into the neglected garden by the gate through which I had  strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert; I,  trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of " Miss Havisham dress; " Miss Havisham, quite  composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As we drew near to  the place of encounter, " Miss Havisham stopped and said,— "I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight that  day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much." "You rewarded me very much." "Did I?" " Miss Havisham replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. "I remember I  entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took a great objection ill that your adversary  should be brought here to pester me with your adversary company." "your adversary and I are great friends now." "Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with your adversary father?" "Yes." I made the admission with reluctance, for the admission seemed to have a boyish look, and  she already treated me more than enough like a boy. "Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your companions,"  said Estella. "Naturally," said I. "And necessarily," she added, in a haughty tone; "what was fit company for you  once, would be quite unfit company for you now." In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering intention left  of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put this observation to flight. "You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?" said Estella,  with a slight wave of Estella hand, signifying in the fighting times. "Not the least." The air of completeness and superiority with which Estella walked at my side, and  the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at hers, made a  contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me more than It did, if  I had not regarded me as eliciting   by being so set apart for Estella and  assigned to Estella. the neglected garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and after we  had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again into the brewery  yard. I showed Estella to a nicety where I had seen Estella walking on the casks, that  first old day, and Estella said, with a cold and careless look in that direction,  "Did I?" I reminded Estella where Estella had come out of the house and given me my  meat and drink, and Estella said, "I don't remember." "Not remember that you made  me cry?" said I. "No," said Estella, and shook Estella and looked about Estella. I  verily believe that Estella not remembering and not minding in the least, made me  cry again, inwardly,—and that is the sharpest crying of all. "You must know," said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful  woman might, "that I have no heart,—if that has anything to do with my  memory." I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of doubting  that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty without it. "Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt," said  Estella, "and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But you know  what I mean. I have no softness there, no—sympathy—sentiment—nonsense." What was it that was borne in upon my mind when Estella stood still and looked  attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in " Miss Havisham? No. In some of  Estella looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance to Miss Havisham  which may often be noticed to have been acquired by children, from grown person  with whom children have been much associated and secluded, and which, when  childhood is passed, will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of  expression between faces that are otherwise quite different. And yet I could  not trace this to " Miss Havisham. I looked again, and though " Miss Havisham was still  looking at me, the suggestion was gone. What was the suggestion? "I am serious," said Estella, not so much with a frown (for " Miss Havisham brow was  smooth) as with a darkening of " Miss Havisham face; "if we are to be thrown much together,  you had better believe it at once. No!" imperiously stopping me as I opened my  lips. "I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere. I have never had any such  thing." In another moment we were in the brewery  yard, so long disused, and " Miss Havisham pointed to  the high gallery where I had seen " Miss Havisham going out on that same first day, and  told me " Miss Havisham remembered to have been up there, and to have seen me standing  scared below. As my eyes followed " Miss Havisham white hand, again the same dim suggestion  that I could not possibly grasp crossed me. My involuntary start occasioned " Miss Havisham  to lay her white hand upon my arm. Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone. What was it? "What is the matter?" asked Estella. "Are you scared again?" "I should be, if I believed what you said just now," I replied, to turn it off. "Then you don't? Very well. It is said, at any rate. " Miss Havisham " Miss Havisham will soon be  expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be laid aside now,  with other old belongings. Let we make one more round of the neglected garden, and then  go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my cruelty to-day; you shall be my  Page, and give me your shoulder." " Miss Havisham handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. " Miss Havisham held your shoulder in one hand now,  and with the other lightly touched your shoulder as we walked. we walked round  the neglected garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in bloom for " Miss Havisham. If the  green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most  precious flowers that ever blew, the  green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most  precious flowers that ever blew could not have been more cherished in my  remembrance. There was no discrepancy of years between we to remove " Miss Havisham far from " Miss Havisham; we were  of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more in " Miss Havisham case than  in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which " Miss Havisham beauty and " Miss Havisham manner gave  " Miss Havisham, tormented me in the midst of my delight, and at the height of the  assurance I felt that we patroness had chosen we for one another. Wretched boy! At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise, that my  guardian had come down to see " Miss Havisham on business, and would come back to  dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering  table was spread had been lighted while we were out, and " Miss Havisham was in  " Miss Havisham chair and waiting for " Miss Havisham. It was like pushing  her chair back into the past, when we began the old  slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, in the funereal  room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in  her chair fixing  her chair eyes  upon her, Estella looked more bright and beautiful than before, and I was under  stronger enchantment. The time so melted away, that we early dinner-hour drew close at hand, and  Estella left we to prepare Estella. we had stopped near the centre of the long  table, and " Miss Havisham, with one of Estella withered arms stretched out of  her chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth. As Estella looked back  over Estella shoulder before going out at the door, " Miss Havisham " Miss Havisham kissed that hand  to " Miss Havisham, with a ravenous intensity that was of that hand   kind quite dreadful. Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, Estella turned to " Miss Havisham, and said in a  whisper,— "Is Estella beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire Estella?" "Everybody must who sees Estella, " Miss Havisham." Estella drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to Estella as Estella sat  in  her chair. "Love Estella, love Estella, love Estella! How does Estella use you?" Before I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question at all)  Estella repeated, "Love Estella, love Estella, love Estella! If Estella favors you, love Estella. If  Estella wounds you, love Estella. If Estella tears your heart to pieces,—and as it gets  older and stronger it will tear deeper,—love Estella, love Estella, love Estella!" Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to Estella utterance of  these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with  the vehemence that possessed Estella. "Hear me, Pip! I adopted Estella, to be loved. I bred Estella and educated Estella, to be  loved. I developed Estella into what Estella is, that Estella might be loved. Love Estella!" Estella said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that Estella meant to  say the word; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of  love—despair—revenge—dire death—it could not have sounded from Estella lips  more like a curse. "I'll tell you," said Estella, in the same hurried passionate whisper, "what real  love is. real  love is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter  submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world,  giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter—as I did!" When Estella came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught Estella round  the waist. For Estella rose up in  her chair, in Estella shroud of a dress, and struck  at the air as if Estella would as soon have struck Estella against the wall and  fallen dead. All this passed in a few seconds. As I drew Estella down into  her chair, I was  conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my  guardian in the room. my  guardian always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a pocket-handkerchief  of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was of great value to my  guardian in  my  guardian profession. I have seen my  guardian so terrify a client or a witness by  ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief as if my  guardian were immediately  going to blow my  guardian nose, and then pausing, as if my  guardian knew my  guardian should not have time  to do it before such client or witness committed my  guardian, that the  self-committal has followed directly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw  my  guardian in the room my  guardian had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and  was looking at us. On meeting my eye, my  guardian said plainly, by a momentary and  silent pause in that attitude, "Indeed? Singular!" and then put this expressive pocket-handkerchief to this expressive pocket-handkerchief right use with wonderful effect. " Miss Havisham had seen " Miss Havisham as soon as " Miss Havisham, and was (like everybody else) afraid  of " Miss Havisham. " Miss Havisham made a strong attempt to compose " Miss Havisham, and stammered that " Miss Havisham was  as punctual as ever. "As punctual as ever," " Miss Havisham repeated, coming up to us. "(How do you do, Pip?  Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you are here, Pip?  ?" I told " Miss Havisham when I had arrived, and how " Miss Havisham " Miss Havisham had wished me to come and  see Estella. To which " Miss Havisham replied, "Ah! Very fine young lady!" Then " Miss Havisham pushed  Miss " Miss Havisham in Very fine young lady before " Miss Havisham, with one of " Miss Havisham large hands, and put the  other in " Miss Havisham trousers-pocket as if his trousers-pocket were full of secrets. "Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?" said he, when he came  to a stop. "How often?" "Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?" "Oh! Certainly not so many." "Twice?" "Jaggers," interposed " Miss Havisham, much to my relief, "leave my Pip alone,  and go with he to your dinner." he complied, and we groped we way down the dark stairs together. While we were  still on we way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the  back, he asked me how often I had seen " Miss Havisham eat and drink; offering me  a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred times and once. I considered, and said, "Never." "And never will, Pip," he retorted, with a frowning smile. "" Miss Havisham has never  allowed " Miss Havisham to be seen doing either, since " Miss Havisham lived this present life of  hers. " Miss Havisham wanders about in the night, and then lays hands on such food as " Miss Havisham  takes." "Pray, sir," said I, "may I ask you a question?" "You may," said sir, "and I may decline to answer it. Put your question." "Estella's name. Is it Havisham or—?" I had nothing to add. "Or what?" said sir. "Is it Havisham?" "it is Havisham." This brought we to the dinner-table, where " Miss Havisham and Sarah Pocket awaited we. Mr.  Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to Jaggers, I faced my green and yellow  friend. we dined very well, and were waited on by a maid-servant whom I had  never seen in all my comings and goings, but who, for anything I know, had been  in that mysterious house the whole time. After dinner a bottle of choice old  port was placed before my  guardian (my  guardian was evidently well acquainted with the  vintage), and the two ladies left we. Anything to equal the determined reticence of Jaggers under that roof I  never saw elsewhere, even in Jaggers. Jaggers kept Jaggers very looks to Jaggers, and  scarcely directed Jaggers eyes to Estella's face once during dinner. When " Miss Havisham spoke  to Jaggers, Jaggers listened, and in due course answered, but never looked at " Miss Havisham, that  I could see. On the other hand, " Miss Havisham often looked at Jaggers, with interest and  curiosity, if not distrust, but Estella's face never showed the least consciousness.  Throughout dinner Jaggers took a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and  yellower, by often referring in conversation with Jaggers to my expectations; but  here, again, Jaggers showed no consciousness, and even made no consciousness appear that Jaggers  extorted—and even did extort, though I don't know how—those references out  of my innocent self. And when Jaggers and I were left alone together, Jaggers sat with an air upon Jaggers of  general lying by in consequence of information  general possessed, that really was  too much for Jaggers. Jaggers cross-examined Jaggers very wine when Jaggers had nothing else in  hand. Jaggers held it between Jaggers and the candle, tasted port, rolled it in  Jaggers mouth, swallowed his mouth, looked at Jaggers glass again, smelt port, tried his mouth,  drank his mouth, filled again, and cross-examined his glass again, until I was as  nervous as if I had known the wine to be telling Jaggers something to my  disadvantage. Three or four times I feebly thought I would start conversation;  but whenever Jaggers saw me going to ask Jaggers anything, Jaggers looked at Jaggers with Jaggers  glass in Jaggers hand, and rolling Jaggers wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me  to take notice that it was of no use, for Jaggers couldn't answer. I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of Jaggers involved Miss Pocket in the  danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off Miss Pocket cap,—which was  a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,—and strewing the ground  with Miss Pocket hair,—which assuredly had never grown on Miss Pocket head. Miss Pocket did not  appear when we afterwards went up to " Miss Havisham's room, and we four played  at whist. In the interval, " Miss Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of  the most beautiful jewels from Miss Pocket dressing-table into Estella's hair, and  about Miss Pocket bosom and arms; and I saw even my guardian look at Miss Pocket from under even my guardian  thick eyebrows, and raise even my guardian look at her from under his  thick eyebrows a little, when Miss Pocket loveliness was before even my guardian,  with those rich flushes of glitter and color in her loveliness. Of the manner and extent to which he took we trumps into custody, and came out  with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the glory of we  Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of the feeling that I  had, respecting he looking upon we personally in the light of three very  obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago. What I suffered from,  was the incompatibility between he cold presence and my feelings towards  Estella. It was not that I knew I could never bear to speak to he about Estella,  that I knew I could never bear to hear he creak he boots at Estella, that I knew  I could never bear to see he wash he hands of Estella; it was, that my admiration  should be within a foot or two of him,—it was, that my feelings should be in  the same place with him,—that, was the agonizing circumstance. We played until nine o'clock, and then it was arranged that when Estella came  to London I should be forewarned of Estella coming and should meet Estella at the  coach; and then I took leave of Estella, and touched Estella and left Estella. my  guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to my  guardian. Far into the night, Miss  Havisham's words, "Love Miss  , love Miss  , love Miss  !" sounded in my ears. I adapted  them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, "I love Miss  , I love Miss  , I  love Miss  !" hundreds of times. Then, a burst of gratitude came upon me, that Miss    should be destined for me, once the blacksmith's boy. Then I thought if Miss    were, as I feared, by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when  would Miss   begin to be interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within  Miss   that was mute and sleeping now? Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never thought there  was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because I knew Miss    would be contemptuous of Joe. It was but a day gone, and Joe had brought the  tears into my eyes; the  tears had soon dried, God forgive me! soon dried.
