 One day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note by the  post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter; for, though I  had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed, I divined whose hand  it was. it had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip, or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or  Dear Anything, but ran thus:— "I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. I believe  it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham has that  impression, and I write in obedience to it. Miss Havisham sends you Miss Havisham regard. "Yours, ESTELLA." If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes  for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be content with those I  had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew no peace or rest until the day  arrived. Not that its arrival brought me either; for, then I was worse than  ever, and began haunting the coach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the midday coach had left the Blue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly  well, I still felt as if this were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my  sight longer than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I  had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when  Wemmick ran against me. "Halloa, Mr. Pip," said me; "how do you do? I should hardly have thought this  was your beat." I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach, and  I inquired after the Castle and the Aged. "Both flourishing thankye," said Wemmick, "and particularly the Aged. Wemmick's in  wonderful feather. Wemmick'll be eighty-two next birthday. I have a notion of firing  eighty-two times, if the neighborhood shouldn't complain, and that cannon of  mine should prove equal to the pressure. However, this is not London talk.  Where do you think I am going to?" "To the coach-office?" said I, for Wemmick was tending in that direction. "Next thing to it," returned Wemmick, "I am going to Newgate. We are in a  banker's-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road taking a  squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word or two with We  client." "Did our  client commit the robbery?" I asked. "Bless your soul and body, no," answered Wemmick, very drily. "But our  client is  accused of Wemmick. So might you or I be. Either of We might be accused of Wemmick, you  know." "Only neither of We is," I remarked. "Yah!" said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with Wemmick forefinger; "you're a  deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate? Have you time to  spare?" I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,  notwithstanding the proposal irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on  the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether I had time to  walk with him, I went into the coach-office, and ascertained from the clerk with the  nicest precision and much to the trying of him temper, the earliest moment at  which the coach could be expected,—which I knew beforehand, quite as well as  he. I then rejoined Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be  surprised by the information I had received, accepted Wemmick offer. We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and We passed through the lodge where some  fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules, into the  interior of the jail. At that time jails were much neglected, and the period of  exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoing—and which is always  all public wrongdoing— heaviest and longest punishment—was still far off. So felons were not  lodged and fed better than soldiers, (to say nothing of paupers,) and seldom  set fire to felons prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of  felons soup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was  going Wemmick rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were  buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing  scene it was. it struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might  walk among a gardener plants. This was first put into my head by a gardener seeing a shoot  that had come up in the night, and saying, "What, Captain Tom? Are you there?  Ah, indeed!" and also, "Is that Black Bill behind the cistern? Why I didn't  look for you these two months; how do you find you?" Equally in his  stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers,—always  singly,—Wemmick with his post-office in an immovable state, looked at them  while in conference, as if his were taking particular notice of the advance them  had made, since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at them trial. his was highly popular, and I found that his took the familiar department of Mr.  Jaggers's business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers hung about his  too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. his personal recognition of  each successive client was comprised in a nod, and in his settling his hat a  little easier on his head with both hands, and then tightening the post-office,  and putting both hands in his pockets. In one or two instances there was a  difficulty respecting the raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far  as possible from the insufficient money produced, said, "it's no use, my boy.  I'm only a subordinate. I can't take it. Don't go on in that way with a  subordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had better  address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals in the  profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may be worth the  while of another; that's my recommendation to you, speaking as a subordinate.  Don't try on useless measures. Why should you? Now, who's next?" Thus, we walked through Wemmick's greenhouse, until he turned to me and said,  "Notice the man I shall shake hands with." I should have done so, without the  preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet. Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see now, as I  write) in a well-worn olive-colored frock-coat, with a peculiar pallor  overspreading the red in he complexion, and eyes that went wandering about  when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of the bars, and put he hand to  he hat—which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth—with a  half-serious and half-jocose military salute. "Colonel, to you!" said Wemmick; "how are you, Colonel?" "All right, Wemmick." "Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong for  us, Colonel." "Yes, it was too strong, sir,—but I don't care." "No, no," said Wemmick, coolly, "you don't care." Then, turning to me, "Served  His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge." I said, "Indeed?" and the man's eyes looked at me, and then looked over my  head, and then looked all round me, and then the man drew the man across the man lips  and laughed. "I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir," the man said to Wemmick. "Perhaps," returned my friend, "but there's no knowing." "I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good by, Mr. Wemmick," said the  man, stretching out the  man between two bars. "Thankye," said Wemmick, shaking hands with Wemmick. "Same to you, Wemmick." "If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick," said the man,  unwilling to let Mr. Wemmick go, "I should have asked the favor of your wearing  another ring—in acknowledgment of your attentions." "I'll accept the will for the deed," said Wemmick. "By the by; you were quite a  pigeon-fancier." the man looked up at the sky. "I am told you had a remarkable  breed of tumblers. Could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair,  of you've no further use for 'em?" "It shall be done, sir?" "All right," said Wemmick, "they shall be taken care of. Good afternoon,  Colonel. Good by!" They shook hands again, and as They walked away Wemmick said  to me, "A Coiner, a very good workman. The Recorder's report is made to-day,  and he is sure to be executed on Monday. Still you see, as far as The Recorder's report goes, a  pair of pigeons are portable property all the same." With that, he looked back,  and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast he eyes about he in walking out  of the yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in this dead plant  place. As They came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great  importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less than by  those whom they held in charge. "Well, Wemmick," said the turnkey, who kept  They between the two studded and spiked lodge gates, and who carefully locked one  before Wemmick unlocked the other, "what's Mr. Jaggers going to do with that  water-side murder? Is Wemmick going to make it manslaughter, or what's Wemmick going to  make of it?" "Why don't you ask Wemmick?" returned Wemmick. "O yes, I dare say!" said the turnkey. "Now, that's the way with them here, Mr. Pip," remarked Wemmick, turning to me  with Wemmick post-office elongated. "They don't mind what They ask of me, the  subordinate; but you'll never catch 'em asking any questions of my principal." "Is this young gentleman one of the 'prentices or articled ones of your  office?" asked the turnkey, with a grin at Wemmick's humor. "There Wemmick goes again, you see!" cried Wemmick, "I told you so! Asks another  question of the subordinate before Wemmick first is dry! Well, supposing Mr. Pip is  one of them?" "Why then," said the turnkey, grinning again, "Mr. Pip knows what Mr. Jaggers is." "Yah!" cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way,  "you're dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal, you  know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I'll get you old fox to bring an action  against you old fox for false imprisonment." the turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over the  spikes of the wicket when us descended the steps into the street. "Mind you, Mr. Pip," said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as Wemmick took my arm to be  more confidential; "I don't know that Mr. Jaggers does a better thing than the  way in which Mr. Jaggers keeps Mr. Jaggers so high. Mr. Jaggers's always so high. Mr. Jaggers constant height  is of a piece with Mr. Jaggers immense abilities. That Colonel durst no more take leave  of Mr. Jaggers, than that turnkey durst ask Mr. Jaggers Mr. Jaggers intentions respecting a case. Then,  between Mr. Jaggers height and them, Mr. Jaggers slips in Mr. Jaggers subordinate,—don't you  see?—and so Mr. Jaggers has 'em, soul and body." I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian's  subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the first  time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities. Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where suppliants for  Mr. Jaggers's notice were lingering about as usual, and I returned to my watch  in the street of the coach-office, with some three hours on hand. I consumed  the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by  all this taint of prison and crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely  marshes on a winter evening, I should have first encountered it; that, it  should have reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was  faded but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and  advancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young  Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute  abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her. I wished that Wemmick had  not met me, or that I had not yielded to Wemmick and gone with Wemmick, so that, of all  days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on  my clothes. I beat the prison dust off my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I  shook the prison dust out of my dress, and I exhaled the prison dust air from my lungs. So contaminated  did I feel, remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all,  and I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick's  conservatory, when I saw Mr. Wemmick's   face at the coach window and Mr. Wemmick's   hand waving to me. What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?
