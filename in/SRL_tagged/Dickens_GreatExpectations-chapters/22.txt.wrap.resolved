 The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in Barnard's  Inn, until we both burst out laughing. "The idea of its being you!" said The idea of its being you.  "The idea of its being youits !" said I. And then we contemplated one another  afresh, and laughed again. "Well!" said the pale young gentleman, reaching out  the pale young gentleman hand good-humoredly, "it's all over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous  in you if you'll forgive me for having knocked you about so." I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the pale  young gentleman's name) still rather confounded Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the pale  young gentleman's name) intention with Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the pale  young gentleman's name)execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly. "You hadn't come into your good fortune at that time?" said Herbert Pocket. "No," said I. "No," Herbert Pocket acquiesced: "I heard it had happened very lately. I was rather on the  lookout for good fortune then." "Indeed?" "Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if Miss Havisham could take a fancy to me.  But Miss Havisham couldn't,—at all events, Miss Havisham didn't." I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that. "Bad taste," said Herbert, laughing, "but a fact. Yes, Miss Havisham had sent for me on a  trial visit, and if I had come out of a  trial visit successfully, I suppose I should have  been provided for; perhaps I should have been what-you-may-called a  trial visit to  Estella." "What's that?" I asked, with sudden gravity. He was arranging He fruit in plates while we talked, which divided He  attention, and was the cause of He having made this lapse of a word.  "Affianced," He explained, still busy with his fruit. "Betrothed. Engaged.  What's-his-named. Any word of that sort." "How did you bear your disappointment?" I asked. "Pooh!" said He, "I didn't care much for it. That girl's a Tartar." "Miss Havisham?" "I don't say no to that, but I meant  Estella. That girl's hard and haughty and  capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by Miss Havisham to  wreak revenge on all the male sex." "What relation is That girl to Miss Havisham?" "None," said he. "Only adopted." "Why should That girl wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?" "Lord, Mr. Pip!" said "Lord, Mr. Pip. "Don't you know?" "No," said I. "Dear me! It's quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And now let  me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come there, that day?" I told him, and him was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out  laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn't ask him if him  was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established. "Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?" Mr. Jaggers went on. "Yes." "You know Mr. Jaggers is Miss Havisham's man of business and solicitor, and has That girl  confidence when nobody else has?" This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with a  constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers in Miss  Havisham's house on the very day of our combat, but never at any other time,  and that I believed Mr. Jaggers had no recollection of having ever seen me there. "Mr. Jaggers was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and Mr. Jaggers called on my father to propose it. Of course Mr. Jaggers knew about my father from Mr. Jaggers connection  with Miss Havisham. my father is Miss Havisham's cousin; not that that implies  familiar intercourse between them, for my father is a bad courtier and will not  propitiate her." Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with Herbert Pocket that was very taking. I had  never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly  expressed to Herbert Pocket, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything  secret and mean. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air,  and something that at the same time whispered to Herbert Pocket his would never be very  successful or rich. I don't know how this was. I became imbued with the notion  on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by  what means. his was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor about  his in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did not seem indicative of  natural strength. his had not a handsome face, but it was better than handsome:  being extremely amiable and cheerful. his figure was a little ungainly, as in  the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with His figure, but His figure looked as if  His figure would always be light and young. Whether Mr. Trabb's local work would have  sat more gracefully on Mr. Trabb than on Herbert Pocket, may be a question; but I am conscious  that Mr. Trabb carried off Mr. Trabb rather old clothes much better than I carried off my  new suit. As Mr. Trabb was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad  return unsuited to our years. I therefore told Mr. Trabb my small story, and laid  stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was. I further  mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place, and  knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would take it as a great kindness  in Mr. Trabb if Mr. Trabb would give me a hint whenever Mr. Trabb saw me at a loss or going wrong. "With pleasure," said Mr. Trabb, "though I venture to prophesy that you'll want very  few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like to banish  any needless restraint between we. Will you do me the favour to begin at once  to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?" I thanked Herbert and said I would. I informed Herbert in Philip. "I don't take to Philip," said Philip, smiling, "for it sounds like a moral boy out  of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that Philip fell into a pond, or so fat that  Philip couldn't see out of Philip eyes, or so avaricious that Philip locked up Philip cake  till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a bird's-nesting that Philip got  Philip eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighborhood. I tell you what I  should like. We are so harmonious, and you have been a blacksmith,—-would you  mind it?" "I shouldn't mind anything that you propose," I answered, "but I don't  understand you." "Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's a charming piece of music  by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith." "I should like it very much." "Then, Handel," said Philip, turning round as the door opened, "here is the  dinner, and I must beg of Handel to take the top of the table, because the dinner  is of your providing." This I would not hear of, so Philip took the top, and I faced Philip. It was a nice  little dinner,—seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,—and Lord Mayor acquired  additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with  no old people by, and with London all around us. This again was heightened by a  certain gypsy character that set the banquet off; for while the table was, as  Mr. Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury,—being entirely furnished  forth from the coffee-house,—the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a  comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter the  wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where Mr. Pumblechook fell over them),  the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in  the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room,—where I  found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired  for the night. All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not  there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy. We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of Herbert promise  to tell me about Miss Havisham. "True," Herbert replied. "I'll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic,  Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in  the mouth,—for fear of accidents,—and that while the fork is reserved for  that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It is scarcely worth  mentioning, only it's as well to do as other people do. Also, the spoon is not  generally used over-hand, but under. This has two advantages. You get at your  mouth better (which after all is the object), and you save a good deal of the  attitude of opening oysters, on the part of the right elbow." He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both  laughed and I scarcely blushed. "Now," He pursued, "concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must know, was  a spoilt child. a spoilt child mother died when Her mother was a baby, and Her mother father denied Her mother  nothing. her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world, and  was a brewer. I don't know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer; but  it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may  be as genteel as never was and brew. You see it every day." "Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may a gentleman?" said I. "Not on any account," returned Herbert; "but a public-house may keep a  gentleman. Well! Miss Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was Miss Havisham  daughter." "Miss Havisham was an only child?" I hazarded. "Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, his  daughter was not an only child; his  daughter had a  half-brother. his  daughter privately married again—his cook, I rather think." "I thought his was proud," said I. " "My good Handel, so his was. his married his second wife privately, because his  was proud, and in course of time his second wife died. When his second wife was dead, I apprehend his  first told his what his had done, and then his became a part of the  family, residing in the house you are acquainted with. As his grew a young  man, his turned out riotous, extravagant, undutiful,—altogether bad. At last  his disinherited his; but his softened when his was dying, and left his  well off, though not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.—Take another glass  of wine, and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to  be so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn one's glass bottom  upwards with the rim on one's nose." I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I thanked his,  and apologized. his said, "Not at all," and resumed. "Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after as a  great match. Miss Havisham half-brother had now ample means again, but what with debts  and what with new madness wasted debts   most fearfully again. There were stronger  differences between his and Miss Havisham than there had been between his and his father,  and it is suspected that his cherished a deep and mortal grudge against Miss Havisham as  having influenced her father's anger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the  story,—merely breaking off, my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin  will not go into a tumbler." Why I was trying to pack mine into a tumbler, I am wholly unable to say. I  only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a much better  cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits.  Again I thanked his and apologized, and again his said in the cheerfullest  manner, "Not at all, I am sure!" and resumed. "There appeared upon the scene—say at the races, or the public balls, or  anywhere else you like—a certain man, who made love to Miss Havisham. I never  saw his (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago, before you and I were,  Handel), but I have heard my father mention that my father was a showy man, and the  kind of man for the purpose. But that my father was not to be, without ignorance or  prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates;  because it is a principle of my father that no man who was not a true gentleman at  heart ever was, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. my father says, no  varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on,  the more the grain will express the grain. Well! my father pursued Miss Havishamclosely, and professed to be devoted to Miss Havisham. I believe Miss Havisham had not shown much  susceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility Miss Havisham possessed  certainly came out then, and Miss Havisham passionately loved my father. There is no doubt that  Miss Havisham perfectly idolized my father. my father practised on Miss Havisham affection in that systematic  way, that my father got great sums of money from Miss Havisham, and my father induced Miss Havisham to buy Miss Havisham  brother out of a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left my father by my father  father) at an immense price, on the plea that when my father was Miss Havisham husband my father must  hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham's  counsels, and Your guardian was too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any  one. Your guardian relations were poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; my father  was poor enough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only independent one  among them, my father warned Your guardian that Your guardian was doing too much for my father, and was  placing Your guardian too unreservedly in my father power. Your guardian took the first opportunity  of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in my father presence, and my fatherhas never seen Your guardian since." I thought of Your guardian having said, "Matthew will come and see me at last when I am  laid dead upon that table;" and I asked Herbert whether Herbert was so  inveterate against Your guardian? "It's not that," said Herbert, "but Your guardian charged Herbert, in the presence of Your guardian intended  husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon Your guardian for Herbert own  advancement, and, if Herbert were to go to Your guardian now, it would look true—even to  Herbert—and even to Your guardian. To return to my father and make an end of my father. The  marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were bought, the wedding tour was  planned out, the wedding guests were invited. The  marriage day came, but not the  bridegroom. not the  bridegroom wrote not the  bridegroom a letter—" "Which not the  bridegroom received," I struck in, "when not the  bridegroom was dressing for not the  bridegroom marriage? At  twenty minutes to nine?" "At the hour and minute," said Herbert, nodding, "at which not the  bridegroom afterwards  stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it most heartlessly  broke her marriage off, I can't tell you, because I don't know. When not the  bridegroom  recovered from a bad illness that not the  bridegroom had, not the  bridegroom laid the whole place waste, as  you have seen the whole place waste, and not the  bridegroom has never since looked upon the light of day." "Is that all the story?" I asked, after considering the whole place waste. "All I know of the whole place waste; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing the whole place waste out for  myself; for my father always avoids the whole place waste, and, even when Miss Havisham invited me  to go there, told me no more of the whole place waste than the whole place waste was absolutely requisite I should  understand. But I have forgotten one thing. the whole place waste has been supposed that the man  to whom not the  bridegroom gave not the  bridegroom misplaced confidence acted throughout in concert with not the  bridegroom  half-brother; that it was a conspiracy between them; and that them shared the  profits." "I wonder he didn't marry not the  bridegroom and get all the property," said I. "he may have been married already, and not the  bridegroom cruel mortification may have been a  part of not the  bridegroom half-brother's scheme," said Herbert. "Mind! I don't know that." "What became of the two men?" I asked, after again considering the subject. "the two men fell into deeper shame and degradation—if there can be deeper—and  ruin." "Are the two men alive now?" "I don't know." "You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but adopted.  When adopted?" Herbert shrugged Herbert shoulders. "There has always been an Estella, since I have  heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now, Handel," said Handel, finally  throwing off the story as the story were, "there is a perfectly open understanding  between us. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you know." "And all that I know," I retorted, "you know." "I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity between you  and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in  life,—namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe  it,—you may be very sure that it,—you will never be encroached upon, or even  approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me." In truth, me said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject done  with, even though I should be under me father's roof for years and years to  come. Yet me said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt me as perfectly  understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I understood the fact me. It had not occurred to me before, that me had led up to the theme for the  purpose of clearing It out of our way; but our were so much the lighter and  easier for having broached It, that I now perceived this to be the case. our  were very gay and sociable, and I asked me, in the course of conversation,  what me was? me replied, "A capitalist,—an Insurer of Ships." I suppose me  saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping, or  capital, for me added, "In the City." I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the  City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer on his back,  blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible head open. But again  there came upon his, for my relief, that odd impression that Herbert Pocket  would never be very successful or rich. "I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships.  I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the Direction. I  shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these things will interfere  with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account. I think I shall  trade," said his, leaning back in his chair, "to the East Indies, for silks,  shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious woods. It's an interesting trade." "And the profits are large?" said I. "Tremendous!" said I. ". I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than my own. "I think I shall trade, also," said I. ", putting I. " thumbs in I. " waist-coat  pockets, "to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum. Also to Ceylon,  specially for elephants' tusks." "You will want a good many ships," said I. "A perfect fleet," said I. ". Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked I. " where  the ships I. " insured mostly traded to at present? "I haven't begun insuring yet," I. " replied. "I am looking about I. "." Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard's Inn. I said (in a  tone of conviction), "Ah-h!" "Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about I. "." "Is a counting-house profitable?" I asked. "To—do you mean to the young fellow who's in it?" I. " asked, in reply. "Yes; to I. "." "Why, n-no; not to me." I. " said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up  and striking a balance. "Not directly profitable. That is, it doesn't pay me  anything, and I have to—keep I. "." This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook his responsible head as if I  would imply that This would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from  such a source of income. "But the thing is," said Herbert Pocket  , "that you look about Herbert Pocket  . That's the  grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you look about Herbert Pocket  ." It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn't be out of a  counting-house, you know, and look about Herbert Pocket  ; but I silently deferred to his  experience. "Then the time comes," said Herbert, "when you see your opening. And you go in,  and you swoop upon your opening and you make your capital, and then there you are! When  you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do but employ your opening." This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden; very  like. his manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded to his  manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that his took all blows and  buffets now with just the same air as his had taken mine then. It was evident  that his had nothing around his but the simplest necessaries, for everything  that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the  coffee-house or somewhere else. Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, his was so unassuming with  it that I felt quite grateful to his for not being puffed up. It was a pleasant  addition to his naturally pleasant ways, and we got on famously. In the evening  we went out for a walk in the streets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and  next day we went to church at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked  in the Parks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did. On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had left  Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and Joe and Biddy partook of that  expansion, and we marshes were any distance off. That I could have been at we  old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very last Sunday that ever  was, seemed a combination of impossibilities, geographical and social, solar  and lunar. Yet in the London streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly  lighted in the dusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for  that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of  night, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about  Barnard's Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart. On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the  counting-house to report himself,—to look about Herbert, too, I suppose,—and I  bore Herbert company. Herbert was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to  Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for Herbert. It appeared to me that the eggs  from which young Insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat, like  the eggs of ostriches, judging from the places to which those incipient giants  repaired on a Monday morning. Nor did the counting-house where Herbertassisted, show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second  floor up a yard, of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into  another back second floor, rather than a look out. I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon 'Change, and I saw fluey men  sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to be great  merchants, though I couldn't understand why fluey men   should all be out of spirits.  When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then  quite venerated, but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in  Europe, and where I could not help noticing, even then, that there was much  more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters' clothes, than in the  steaks. This collation disposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease,  which was not charged for), we went back to Barnard's Inn and got my little  portmanteau, and then took coach for  Hammersmith. we arrived there at two or  three o'clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Herbert Pocket  house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden  overlooking the river, where Herbert Pocket  's children were playing about. And  unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are  certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Herbert Pocket  's children were not  growing up or being brought up, but were tumbling up. Herbert Pocket   was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with Herbert Pocket   legs  upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket's two nurse-maids were looking about  Mrs. Pocket's two nurse-maids while the children played. "Mamma," said Herbert, "this is young Mr. Pip."  Upon which Herbert Pocket   received me with an appearance of amiable dignity. "Master Alick and Miss Jane," cried one of the nurses to two of the children,  "if you go a bouncing up against the nurses bushes you'll fall over into the river  and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then?" At the same time this nurse picked up Herbert Pocket  's handkerchief, and said, "If  that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!" Upon which Herbert Pocket  laughed and said, "Thank you, Flopson," and settling Herbert Pocket   in one chair only,  resumed Herbert Pocket   book. Herbert Pocket   countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent  expression as if Herbert Pocket   had been reading for a week, but before Herbert Pocket   could have  read half a dozen lines, Herbert Pocket   fixed Herbert Pocket   eyes upon me, and said, "I hope your  mamma is quite well?" This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty  that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person  I had no doubt Herbert Pocket   would have been quite well and would have been very much  obliged and would have sent Herbert Pocket   compliments, when this nurse came to my rescue. "Well!" Herbert Pocket   cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, "if that don't make  seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!" Herbert Pocket   received  Herbert Pocket   property, at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if Herbert Pocket   had never  seen it before, and then with a laugh of recognition, and said, "Thank you,  Flopson," and forgot me, and went on reading. I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than six  little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had scarcely  arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region of air, wailing  dolefully. "If there ain't Baby!" said Flopson, appearing to think it most surprising.  "Make haste up, Millers." Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees the  child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young ventriloquist  with something in a young ventriloquist   mouth. Herbert Pocket   read all the time, and I was curious  to know what her book could be. We were waiting, I supposed, for Herbert Pocket   to come out to We; at any rate We  waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family  phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Herbert Pocket   in the children  play, the children always tripped the children up and tumbled over her,—always very  much to her momentary astonishment, and the children own more enduring lamentation. I  was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance, and could not help  giving my mind to speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with  the baby, which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing which baby to  Mrs. Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby and  all, and was caught by Herbert and myself. "Gracious me, Flopson!" said Herbert Pocket  , looking off her book for a moment,  "everybody's tumbling!" "Gracious you, indeed, Mum!" returned Flopson, very red in the face; "what have  you got there?" "I got here, Flopson?" asked Herbert Pocket  . "Why, if it ain't your footstool!" cried Flopson. "And if you keep it under  your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling? Here! Take which baby, Mum, and  give me her book." Herbert Pocket   acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a little in  Herbert Pocket   lap, while the other children played about it. This had lasted but a very  short time, when Herbert Pocket   issued summary orders that they were all to be  taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the second discovery on that first  occasion, that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately  tumbling up and lying down. Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the other children into  the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Herbert Pocket   came out of it to make  my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Herbert Pocket   was a  gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and with Herbert Pocket   very gray  hair disordered on Herbert Pocket   head, as if Herbert Pocket   didn't quite see Herbert Pocket   way to putting  anything straight.
