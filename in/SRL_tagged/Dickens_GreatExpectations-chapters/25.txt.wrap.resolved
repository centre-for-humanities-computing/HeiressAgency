 Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that a fellow even took up a book as if  a book writer had done a fellow an injury, did not take up an acquaintance in a more  agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement, and comprehension,—in the  sluggish complexion of a fellow face, and in the large, awkward tongue that seemed  to loll about in a fellow mouth as a fellow himself lolled about in a room,—he was idle,  proud, niggardly, reserved, and suspicious. a fellow came of rich people down in  Somersetshire, who had nursed this combination of qualities until rich people made the  discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley Drummle had  come to Mr. Pocket when Mr. Pocket was a head taller than that gentleman, and half a  dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen. Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when Startop ought to have  been at school, but Startop was devotedly attached to Startop, and admired Startop beyond  measure. Startop had a woman's delicacy of feature, and was—"as you may see,  though you never saw Startop," said Herbert to me—"exactly like Herbert mother." It  was but natural that I should take to Startop much more kindly than to Drummle, and  that, even in the earliest evenings of our boating, Startop and I should pull  homeward abreast of one another, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley  Bentley Drummle came up in our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the  rushes. Bentley Drummle would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious  creature, even when the tide would have sent Bentley Drummle fast upon Bentley Drummle way; and I  always think of Bentley Drummle as coming after our in the dark or by the back-water, when  our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid-stream. Herbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented Herbert with a half-share  in my boat, which was the occasion of Herbert often coming down to Hammersmith; and  my possession of a half-share in Herbert chambers often took me up to London. We  used to walk between the two places at all hours. I have an affection for the  road yet (though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then), formed in the  impressibility of untried youth and hope. When I had been in Mr. Pocket's family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs. Camilla  turned up. Mrs. Camilla   was Mr. Pocket's sister. Georgiana, whom I had seen at Miss  Havisham's on the same occasion, also turned up. Mrs. Camilla   was a cousin,—an  indigestive single woman, who called Mrs. Camilla   rigidity religion, and Mrs. Camilla   liver love.  These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment. As a  matter of course, These people fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest  meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as a grown-up infant with no notion of his own  interests, These people showed the complacent forbearance I had heard These people express.  Mrs. Pocket These people held in contempt; but These people allowed the poor soul to have been  heavily disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon  These people. These people were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied me to  my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began to spend an amount  of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous;  but through good and evil I stuck to my books. There was no other merit in  this, than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket  and Herbert I got on fast; and, with one or the other always at my elbow to  give me the start I wanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have  been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less. I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write Mr. Wemmick a  note and propose to go home with Mr. Wemmick on a certain evening. Mr. Wemmick replied that it  would give Mr. Wemmick much pleasure, and that Mr. Wemmick would expect me at the office at six  o'clock. Thither I went, and there I found Mr. Wemmick, putting the key of Mr. Wemmick safe  down Mr. Wemmick back as the clock struck. "Did you think of walking down to Walworth?" said Mr. Wemmick. "Certainly," said I, "if you approve." "Very much," was Wemmick's reply, "for I have had my legs under the desk all  day, and shall be glad to stretch all  . Now, I'll tell you what I have got for  supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,—which is of home  preparation,—and a cold roast fowl,—which is from the cook's-shop. I think  it's tender, because the master of the cook's-shop was a Juryman in some cases of ours  the other day, and we let Mr. Wemmick down easy. I reminded Mr. Wemmick of it when I bought the  fowl, and I said, "Pick we out a good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen  to keep you in the box another day or two, we could easily have done it." Mr. Wemmick  said to that, "Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the cook's-shop." I let  Mr. Wemmick, of course. As far as it goes, it's property and portable. You don't object  to an aged parent, I hope?" I really thought Mr. Wemmick was still speaking of the  fowl, until Mr. Wemmick added, "Because I  have got an aged parent at my place." I then said what politeness required. "So, you haven't dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?" Mr. Wemmick pursued, as we walked along. "Not yet." "Mr. Wemmick told me so this afternoon when Mr. Wemmick heard you were coming. I expect you'll  have an invitation to-morrow. Mr. Wemmick's going to ask your pals, too. Three of your pals;  ain't there?" Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my intimate  associates, I answered, "Yes." "Well, Mr. Wemmick's going to ask the whole gang,"—I hardly felt complimented by the  word,—"and whatever Mr. Wemmick gives you, Mr. Wemmick'll give you good. Don't look forward to  variety, but you'll have excellence. And there's another rum thing in Mr. Wemmick  house," proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if the remark followed on  the housekeeper understood; "the housekeeper never lets a door or window be fastened at  night." "Is Mr. Wemmick never robbed?" "That's it!" returned Wemmick. "Mr. Wemmick says, and gives it out publicly, "I want to  see the man who'll rob me." Lord bless you, I have heard the man who'll rob me, a hundred times,  if I have heard the man who'll rob me once, say to regular cracksmen in our front office, "You  know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there; why don't you do a stroke  of business with the man who'll rob me? Come; can't I tempt you?" Not a man of them, sir, would be  bold enough to try it on, for love or money." "them dread sir so much?" said I. "Dread sir," said Wemmick. "I believe you them dread sir. Not but what sir's  artful, even in sir defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia metal, every  spoon." "So them wouldn't have much," I observed, "even if they—" "Ah! But sir would have much," said Wemmick, cutting me short, "and them know  Wemmick. sir'd have them lives, and the lives of scores of 'em. sir'd have all sir  could get. And it's impossible to say what sir couldn't get, if sir gave sir mind  to it." I was falling into meditation on my guardian's greatness, when Wemmick  remarked:— "As to the absence of plate, that's only his natural depth, you know. A river's  A river's   natural depth, and his's his natural depth. Look at his watch-chain. That's  real enough." "It's very massive," said I. "Massive?" repeated Wemmick. "I think so. And his watch is a gold repeater, and  worth a hundred pound if it's worth a penny. Mr. Pip, there are about seven  hundred thieves in this town who know all about his watch; there's not a man,  a woman, or a child, among about seven  hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch, who wouldn't identify the smallest link in  his watch-chain, and drop it as if it was red hot, if inveigled into touching it." At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more  general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road, until he  gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth. we had arrived in the district of Walworth appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little gardens, and  to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement. Wemmick's house was a little  wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden, and the top of Wemmick's house was cut out  and painted like a battery mounted with guns. "My own doing," said Wemmick. "Looks pretty; don't it?" I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw; with the  queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of the smallest house I ever saw sham), and a gothic  door almost too small to get in at. "That's a real flagstaff, you see," said Wemmick, "and on Sundays I run up a  real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I hoist this bridge  up-so—and cut off the communication." this bridge was a plank, and this bridge crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two  deep. But this bridge was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted this bridge up and  made this bridge fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and not merely mechanically. "At nine o'clock every night, Greenwich time," said Wemmick, "the gun fires.  There he is, you see! And when you hear he go, I think you'll say he's a  Stinger." The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,  constructed of lattice-work. The piece of ordnance referred was protected from the weather by an ingenious  little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella. "Then, at the back," said Wemmick, "out of sight, so as not to impede the idea  of fortifications,—for it's a principle with me, if you have an idea, carry  an idea out and keep an idea up,—I don't know whether that's your opinion—" I said, decidedly. "—At the back, there's a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I knock  together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and you'll judge at  supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir," said Wemmick, smiling again,  but seriously too, as sir shook sir head, "if you can suppose the little place  besieged, the little place   would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions." Then, sir conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was  approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to  get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth. our punch was  cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin a bower about a dozen yards off was raised. This piece  of water (with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for  supper) was of a circular form, and he had constructed a fountain in a fountain, which,  when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that  powerful extent that a cork made the back of your hand quite wet. "I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my own  gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades," said Wemmick, in acknowledging my  compliments. "Well; it's a good thing, you know. it brushes the Newgate cobwebs  away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn't mind being at once introduced to the  Aged, would you? It wouldn't put you out?" I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the Castle. There we found,  sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean, cheerful,  comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf. "Well aged parent," said Wemmick, shaking hands with Wemmick in a cordial and  jocose way, "how am you?" "All right, John; all right!" replied Wemmick. "Here's Mr. Pip, aged parent," said Wemmick, "and I wish you could hear Wemmick  name. Nod away at Wemmick, Mr. Pip; that's what Mr. Pip likes. Nod away at Mr. Pip, if you  please, like winking!" "This is a fine place of my son's, sir," cried Wemmick, while I nodded as  hard as I possibly could. "This is a pretty pleasure-ground, sir. This spot and  these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation, after my  son's time, for the people's enjoyment." "You're as proud of it as Punch; ain't you, Aged?" said Wemmick, contemplating  Wemmick, with Wemmick hard face really softened; "there's a nod for you;"  giving Wemmick a tremendous one; "there's another for you;" giving Wemmick a still more  tremendous one; "you like that, don't you? If you're not tired, Mr.  Pip—though I know it's tiring to strangers—will you tip Wemmick one more? You  can't think how it pleases Wemmick." I tipped Wemmick several more, and Wemmick was in great spirits. We left Wemmick bestirring  Wemmick to feed the fowls, and We sat down to We punch in the arbor; where  Wemmick told me, as Wemmick smoked a pipe, that a pipe had taken Wemmick a good many years  to bring the property up to the property present pitch of perfection. "Is it your own, Wemmick?" "O yes," said Wemmick, "I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. it's a  freehold, by George!" "Is it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?" "Never seen it," said Wemmick. "Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged. Never  heard of the Aged. No; the office is one thing, and private life is another. When I  go into the office, I leave the Castle behind the Aged, and when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind the Aged. If it's not in any way disagreeable to  you, you'll oblige me by doing the same. I don't wish it's not in any way disagreeable to  you professionally spoken  about." Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request. The  punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it's not in any way disagreeable to  you and talking, until it's not in any way disagreeable to  you was  almost nine o'clock. "Getting near gun-fire," said Wemmick then, as Wemmick laid  down Wemmick pipe; "it's the Aged's treat." Proceeding into the Castle the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker, with  expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly  ceremony. Wemmick stood with Wemmick watch in Wemmick hand until the moment was come  for Wemmick to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and repair to the battery. Wemmicktook it, and went out, and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that  shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if the Stinger must fall to pieces, and made  every glass and teacup in the Stinger ring. Upon this, the Aged—who I believe would  have been blown out of Wemmick arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows—cried  out exultingly, "Wemmick's fired! I heerd Wemmick!" and I nodded at the old gentleman  until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see Wemmick. The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me Wemmickcollection of curiosities. The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me his  collection of curiosities were mostly of a felonious character;  comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed, a  distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several manuscript  confessions written under condemnation,—upon which Wemmick set particular  value as being, to use Wemmick own words, "every one of 'em Lies, sir." These were  agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass, various neat  trifles made by the proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved  by the Aged. various neat  trifles made by the proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved  by the Aged were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I  had been first inducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room  but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and a  brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting-jack. There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged in the  day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to give she  means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper was excellent; and  though the Castle the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch that the Castle tasted like a  bad nut, and though the pig might have been farther off, I was heartily pleased  with my whole entertainment. Nor was there any drawback on my little turret  bedroom, beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the  flagstaff, that when I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to  balance that pole on my forehead all night. Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard Wemmick cleaning my  boots. After that, Wemmick fell to gardening, and I saw Wemmick from my gothic window  pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at Wemmick in a most devoted manner. Our  breakfast was as good as The supper, and at half-past eight precisely Our  started for Little Britain. By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and harder as Our went  along, and Wemmick mouth tightened into a post-office again. At last, when Our got  to Wemmick place of business and Wemmick pulled out Wemmick key from Wemmick coat-collar, Wemmick  looked as unconscious of Wemmick Walworth property as if the Castle and the  drawbridge and the arbor and an ornamental lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all  been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.
