 He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been immediately  committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer  of the prison-ship from which He had once escaped, to speak to He identity.
Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had meant to depose to it, was tumbling  on the tides, dead, and it happened that there was not at that time any prison  officer in London who could give the required evidence.
I had gone direct to  Mr. Jaggers at his private house, on my arrival over night, to retain his  assistance, and Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing.
It  was the sole resource; for Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf told me that the case must be over in five  minutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent  no power on earth going against us.
I imparted to Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf my design of keeping Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf in ignorance of the fate of  Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf wealth.
Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf was querulous and angry with Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf for having "let it slip  through my fingers," and said we must memorialize by and by, and try at all  events for some of it.
But Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf did not conceal from Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf that, although there  might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no  circumstances in the case to make the case one of no  circumstances.
I understood that very well.
I was not related to the outlaw, or connected with Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf by any recognizable tie;  Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf had put Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf  apprehension, and to do so now would be idle.
I had no claim, and I finally  resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my heart should  never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one.
There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped  for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some accurate knowledge  of Magwitch's affairs.
When his body was found, many miles from the scene of  his death, and so horribly disfigured that his was only recognizable by the  contents of his pockets, notes were still legible, folded in a case his carried.
Among he was only recognizable by the  contents of his pockets were the name of a banking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of  money was, and the designation of certain lands of considerable value.
Both  these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave  to Mr. Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit.
he ignorance,  poor fellow, at last served he; he never mistrusted but that my inheritance  was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers's aid.
After three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over for the  production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness from the prison-ship came, and completed  the easy case.
the witness from the prison-ship was committed to take the witness from the prison-ship trial at the next Sessions, which  would come on in a month.
It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one evening, a  good deal cast down, and said,— "My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you."
the witness from the prison-ship partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than the witness from the prison-ship thought.
"We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am very  much afraid I must go, "My dear Handel, when you most need me."
"Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but my need  is no greater now than at another time."
"You will be so lonely."
"I have not leisure to think of that," said I.
"You know that I am always with  the witness from the prison-ship to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I should be with the witness from the prison-ship all  day long, if I could.
And when I come away from the witness from the prison-ship, you know that my thoughts  are with the witness from the prison-ship."
The dreadful condition to which the witness from the prison-ship was brought, was so appalling to both of us,  that us could not refer to it in plainer words.
"My dear fellow," said Herbert, "let the near prospect of us separation—for,  it is very near—be my justification for troubling you about yourself.
Have  you thought of your future?"
"No, for I have been afraid to think of any future."
"But yourself cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not be  dismissed.
I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly words go,  with me."
"I will," said I.
"In this branch house of us, my dear dear Handel, us must have a—" I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, "A clerk."
"A clerk.
And I hope it is not at all unlikely that " "A clerk may expand (as a clerk  of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner.
Now, Handel,—in short, my  dear boy, will you come to me?"
There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which  after saying "Now, my dear dear Handel," as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous  business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone, stretched out he honest  hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.
"Clara and I have talked about it again and again," Herbert pursued, "and the  dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in Clara eyes, to say  to my dear dear Handel that, if you will live with us when us come together, Clara will do Clara  best to make you happy, and to convince Clara husband's friend that her husband is Clara  friend too.
us should get on so well, my dear dear Handel!"
I thanked Clara heartily, and I thanked her husband heartily, but said I could not yet  make sure of joining her husband as her husband so kindly offered.
Firstly, my mind was too  preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.
Secondly,—Yes!
Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come  out very near the end of this slight narrative.
"But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury to your  business, leave the question open for a little while—" "For any while," cried Herbert.
"Six months, a year!"
"Not so long as that," said I.
"Two or three months at most."
Herbert was highly delighted when us shook hands on this arrangement, and said  Herbert could now take courage to tell me that Herbert believed Herbert must go away at the  end of the week.
"And Clara?"
said I.
"The dear little thing," returned Herbert, "holds dutifully to Clara father as  long as her father lasts; but her father won't last long.
Mrs. Whimple confides to Mrs. Whimple that Mrs. Whimple  is certainly going."
"Not to say an unfeeling thing," said I, "her father cannot do better than go."
"I am afraid that must be admitted," said Herbert; "and then I shall come back  for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I will walk quietly  into the nearest church.
Remember!
The blessed darling comes of no family, my  dear Handel, and never looked into the red book, and hasn't a notion about Clara  grandpapa.
What a fortune for the son of my mother!"
On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,—full of bright  hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,—as Herbert,—full sat on one of the seaport mail  coaches.
I went into a coffee-house to write a little note to Clara, telling  Clara Herbert,—full had gone off, sending Herbert,—full love to Clara over and over again, and then went  to my lonely home,—if it deserved the name; for it was now no home to me, and  I had no home anywhere.
On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an unsuccessful  application of Herbert,—full knuckles to my door.
I had not seen Herbert,—full alone since the  disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and Herbert,—full had come, in Herbert,—full private and  personal capacity, to say a few words of explanation in reference to that  failure.
"The late Compeyson," said Wemmick, "had by little and little got at the bottom  of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was from the talk of  some of   people in trouble (some of his people being always in trouble) that  I heard what I did.
I kept my ears open, seeming to have his people shut, until I  heard that he was absent, and I thought that would be the best time for making  the attempt.
I can only suppose now, that it was a part of he policy, as a  very clever man, habitually to deceive he own instruments.
You don't blame me,  I hope, Mr. Pip?
I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart."
"I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most earnestly  for all your interest and friendship."
"Thank you, thank you very much.
It's a bad job," said Wemmick, scratching Wemmick  head, "and I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a long time.
What I look  at is the sacrifice of so much portable property.
Dear me!"
"What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property."
"Yes, to be sure," said Wemmick.
"Of course, there can be no objection to your  being sorry for Wemmick, and I'd put down a five-pound note myself to get Wemmick out  of it.
But what I look at is this.
The late Compeyson having been beforehand  with Wemmick in intelligence of Wemmick return, and being so determined to bring Wemmick to  book, I do not think Wemmick could have been saved.
Whereas, the portable property  certainly could have been saved.
That's the difference between the property and  the owner, don't you see?"
I invited Wemmick to come up stairs, and refresh Wemmick with a glass of grog  before walking to Walworth.
Wemmick accepted the invitation.
While Wemmick was drinking  Wemmick moderate allowance, Wemmick said, with nothing to lead up to it, and after  having appeared rather fidgety,— "What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr.
Pip?"
"Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months."
"These twelve years, more likely," said Wemmick.
"Yes.
I'm going to take a  holiday.
More than that; I'm going to take a walk.
More than that; I'm going to  ask you to take a walk with me."
I was about to excuse me, as being but a bad companion just then, when  Wemmick anticipated me.
"I know your engagements," said me, "and I know you are out of sorts, Mr. Pip.
But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.
it ain't a long  walk, and it's an early one.
Say it might occupy you (including breakfast on  the walk) from eight to twelve.
Couldn't you stretch a point and manage it?"
me had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little to do  for me.
I said I could manage it,—would manage it,—and me was so very much  pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too.
At me particular request,  I appointed to call for me at the Castle at half past eight on Monday morning,  and so we parted for the time.
Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the the Castle gate on the Monday morning,  and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking tighter than  usual, and having a sleeker hat on.
Within, there were two glasses of rum and  milk prepared, and two biscuits.
The Aged must have been stirring with the  lark, for, glancing into the perspective of me bedroom, I observed that me  bed was empty.
When we had fortified we with the rum and milk and biscuits, and were  going out for the walk with that training preparation on we, I was considerably  surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put a fishing-rod over me shoulder.
"Why, we are not going fishing!"
said I.
"No," returned Wemmick, "but I like to  walk with one."
I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off.
we went towards  Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said suddenly,— "Halloa!
Here's a church!"
There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather surprised,  when Wemmick said, as if Wemmick were animated by a brilliant idea,— "Let's go in!"
we went in, Wemmick leaving Wemmick fishing-rod in the porch, and looked all round.
In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into Wemmick coat-pockets, and getting  something out of paper there.
"Halloa!"
said Wemmick.
"Here's a couple of pair of gloves!
Let's put 'em on!"
As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened to the post-office  utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions.
my strong suspicions were strengthened  into certainty when I beheld The Aged enter at a side door, escorting a lady.
"Halloa!"
said Wemmick.
"Here's Miss Skiffins!
Let's have a wedding."
That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that That discreet damsel was now engaged in  substituting for That discreet damsel green kid gloves a pair of white.
The Aged was likewise  occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of Hymen.
The old  gentleman, however, experienced so much difficulty in getting The old  gentleman gloves on,  that Wemmick found it necessary to put The old  gentleman with The old  gentleman back against a pillar, and  then to get behind the pillar The old  gentleman and pull away at them, while I for my  part held the old gentleman round the waist, that The old  gentleman might present an equal and  safe resistance.
By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to  perfection.
The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at those fatal  rails.
True to The old  gentleman notion of seeming to do it all without preparation, I heard  Wemmick say to Wemmick, as Wemmick took something out of Wemmick waistcoat-pocket before  the service began, "Halloa!
Here's a ring!"
I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; while a  little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a feint of being  the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins.
The responsibility of giving a lady away  devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergyman's being unintentionally  scandalized, and it happened thus.
When he said, "Who giveth this woman to be  married to this man?"
the old gentlemen, not in the least knowing what point of  the ceremony we had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten  commandments.
Upon which, the clergyman said again, "WHO giveth this woman to  be married to this man?"
The old gentleman being still in a state of most  estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in the bridegroom accustomed voice,  "Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?"
To which The Aged replied with great  briskness, before saying that he gave, "All right, John, all right, my boy!"
And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the  moment whether we should get completely married that day.
It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of Wemmicktook the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in the font, and put the cover  on again.
Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put his white gloves in her  pocket and assumed her green.
"Now, Mr. Pip," said Wemmick, triumphantly  shouldering the fishing-rod as we came out, "let me ask you whether anybody  would suppose this to be a wedding-party!"
Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so away upon  the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle board in the  room, in case we should desire to unbend we minds after the solemnity.
It was  pleasant to observe that Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick's arm when Wemmick's arm  adapted Wemmick's arm to Wemmick figure, but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall,  like a violoncello in Wemmick's arm case, and submitted to be embraced as that melodious  instrument might have done.
we had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on table,  Wemmick said, "Provided by contract, you know; don't be afraid of contract!"
I drank  to the new couple, drank to The Aged, drank to the Castle, saluted the bride at  parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could.
Wemmick came down to the door with myself, and I again shook hands with Wemmick, and  wished Wemmick joy.
"Thankee!"
said Wemmick, rubbing hands.
"She's such a manager of fowls, you  have no idea.
You shall have some eggs, and judge for yourself.
I say, Mr.
Pip!"
calling me back, and speaking low.
"This is altogether a Walworth  sentiment, please."
"I understand.
Not to be mentioned in Little Britain," said Wemmick nodded.
"After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may as well  not know of Mr. Jaggers.
Mr. Jaggers might think my brain was softening, or something of the  kind."
