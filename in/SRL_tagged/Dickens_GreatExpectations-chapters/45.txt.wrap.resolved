 Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made the best  of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to  the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed was always to be got there  at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain, letting me in at the chamberlain ready  wicket, lighted the candle next in order on the chamberlain shelf, and showed me straight  into the bedroom next in order on the chamberlain list. It was a sort of vault on the  ground floor at the back, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in  it, straddling over the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the  fireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little  washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner. As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in, before the chamberlain  left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous days.—an  object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which instantly broke the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous days.—an   back if the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous days.—an    were touched, which nothing could ever be lighted at, and which was placed in  solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round  holes that made a staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got  into bed, and lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no  more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus. And  thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one another. What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an  inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I looked up  into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a number of  blue-bottle flies from the butchers', and earwigs from the market, and grubs  from the country, must be holding on up there, lying by for next summer. This  led me to speculate whether any of earwigs from the market, and grubs  from the country ever tumbled down, and then I fancied  that I felt light falls on my face,—a disagreeable turn of thought,  suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back. When I had lain  awake a little while, those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began  to make those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began  to make themselves audible audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the  little washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the  chest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired a new  expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw written, DON'T GO  HOME. Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never warded off  this DON'T GO HOME. this DON'T GO HOME plaited this DON'T GO HOME into whatever I thought of, as a bodily  pain would have done. Not long before, I had read in the newspapers, how a  gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the night, and had gone to bed,  and had destroyed how a  gentleman unknown, and had been found in the morning weltering in  blood. It came into my head that how a  gentleman unknown must have occupied this very vault of mine,  and I got out of bed to assure me that there were no red marks about; then  opened the door to look out into the passages, and cheer me with the  companionship of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be  dozing. But all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at  home, and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were  questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed there could  be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I thought of Estella, and  how we had parted that day forever, and when I recalled all the circumstances  of we parting, and all Estella looks and tones, and the action of Estella fingers  while Estella knitted,—even then I was pursuing, here and there and everywhere,  the caution, Don't go home. When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind  and body, body became a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative  mood, present tense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let we not go  home, do not ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may  not and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should not  go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over on the  pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again. I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain that I  must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain that this was a  case in which Wemmick Walworth sentiments only could be taken. It was a relief to  get out of the room where the night had been so miserable, and I needed no  second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed. The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o'clock. The little servant  happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I passed through the  postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company, and so came without  announcement into the presence of Wemmick as The little servant   was making tea for The little servant   and  the Aged. An open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed. "Halloa, Mr. Pip!" said Wemmick. "You did come home, then?" "Yes," I returned; "but I didn't go home." "That's all right," said The little servant  , rubbing The little servant   hands. "I left a note for you at each  of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come to?" I told The little servant  . "I'll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes,"  said Wemmick; "it's a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can  help it, because you don't know when it may be put in. I'm going to take a  liberty with you. Would you mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P.?" I said I should be delighted to do this sausage. "Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne," said Wemmick to the little  servant; "which leaves us to us, don't you see, Mr. Pip?" Mr. Pip added,  winking, as Mary Anne disappeared. I thanked Mr. Pip for Mr. Pip friendship and caution, and us discourse proceeded in a  low tone, while I toasted this sausage and Mr. Pip buttered the crumb of the  Aged's roll. "Now, Mr. Pip, you know," said Wemmick, "you and I understand one another. us  are in us private and personal capacities, and us have been engaged in a  confidential transaction before to-day. Official sentiments are one thing. us  are extra official." I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted the  Aged's sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out. "I accidentally heard, yesterday morning," said Wemmick, "being in a certain  place where I once took you,—even between you and me, it's as well not to  mention names when avoidable—" "Much better not," said I. "I understand you." "I heard there by chance, yesterday morning," said Wemmick, "that a certain  person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not unpossessed of portable  property,—I don't know who it may really be,—we won't name this person—" "Not necessary," said I.—Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many  people go, not always in gratification of a good many  people own inclinations, and not quite  irrespective of the government expense—" In watching the government expense— face, I made quite a firework of the Aged's sausage, and  greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick's; for which I apologized. "—By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of thereabouts.  From which," said Wemmick, "conjectures had been raised and theories formed. I  also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court, Temple, had been watched,  and might be watched again." "By whom?" said I.I wouldn't go into that," said Wemmick, evasively, "it might clash with  official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard other curious  things in the same place. I don't tell it you on information received. I heard  it." He took the toasting-fork and sausage from He as He spoke, and set forth the  Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray before He, He  went into the Aged's room with a clean white cloth, and tied the same under the  old gentleman's chin, and propped He up, and put He nightcap on one side, and  gave He quite a rakish air. Then He placed Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray before He with great  care, and said, "All right, ain't you, Aged P.?" To which the cheerful Aged  replied, "All right, John, my boy, all right!" As there seemed to be a tacit  understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore  to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of  these proceedings. "This watching of He at my chambers (which I have once had reason to suspect),"  I said to Wemmick when Wemmick came back, "is inseparable from the person to whom  you have adverted; is it?" Wemmick looked very serious. "I couldn't undertake to say that, of my own  knowledge. I mean, I couldn't undertake to say it was at first. But it either  is, or it will be, or it's in great danger of being." As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying as much  as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to he how far out of he way he  went to say what he did, I could not press he. But I told he, after a little  meditation over the fire, that I would like to ask he a question, subject to  he answering or not answering, as he deemed right, and sure that he course  would be right. he paused in he , and crossing he arms, and pinching  he shirt-sleeves (he notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat),  he nodded to he once, to put my question. "You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is Compeyson?" he answered with one other nod. "Is he living?" One other nod. "Is he in London?" he gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave me one  last nod, and went on with he . "Now," said Wemmick, "questioning being over," which Wemmick emphasized and repeated  for my guidance, "I come to what I did, after hearing what I heard. I went to  Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to Clarriker's to find Mr.  Herbert." "And he you found?" said I, with great anxiety. "And he I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any details, I  gave he to understand that if he was aware of anybody—Tom, Jack, or  Richard—being about the chambers, or about the immediate neighborhood, he had  better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way while you were out of the way." "he would be greatly puzzled what to do?" "he was puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave he my opinion that it  was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too far out of the way at  present. Mr. Pip, I'll tell you something. Under existing circumstances, there  is no place like a great city when you are once in no place like a great city. Don't break cover too  soon. Lie close. Wait till things slacken, before you try the open, even for  foreign air." I thanked he for he valuable advice, and asked he what Herbert had done? "Mr. Herbert," said Wemmick, "after being all of a heap for half an hour,  struck out a plan. he mentioned to me as a secret, that he is courting a young  lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden Pa. Which Pa, having been  in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a bow-window where he can see the  ships sail up and down the river. You are acquainted with the young lady, most  probably?" "Not personally," said I. The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did  Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to present me to  she, she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth, that Herberthad felt Herbert obliged to confide the state of the case to me, with a view to  the lapse of a little time before I made she acquaintance. When I had begun to  advance Herbert's prospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with  cheerful philosophy: Herbert and Herbert affianced, for he and his part, had naturally not  been very anxious to introduce a third person into he and his interviews; and thus,  although I was assured that I had risen in Clara's esteem, and although the  young lady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by  Herbert, I had never seen she. However, I did not trouble Wemmick with these  particulars. "The house with the bow-window," said Wemmick, "being by the river-side, down  the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it seems, by a  very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let, Herbert put  it to Herbert, what did I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or  Richard? Now, I thought very well of it, for three reasons I'll give you. That  is to say: Firstly. That  's altogether out of all your beats, and is well away  from the usual heap of streets great and small. Secondly. Without going near it  yourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, through HerbertHerbert. Thirdly. After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should  want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a foreign packet-boat, there he  is—ready." Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and again, and  begged he to proceed. "Well, sir! Herbert threw Herbert into the business with a will, and by  nine o'clock last night Herbert housed Tom, Jack, or Richard,—whichever it may  be,—you and I don't want to know,—quite successfully. At the old lodgings  it was understood that Herbert was summoned to Dover, and, in fact, Herbert was taken  down the Dover road and cornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all  this is, that it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning  himself about your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off  and quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it; and for  the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last night, you  should not go home. It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion." Wemmick, having finished Wemmick , here looked at Wemmick watch, and began to  get Wemmick coat on. "And now, Mr. Pip," said Mr. Pip, with Mr. Pip hands still in the sleeves, "I have  probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,—from a Walworth  point of view, and in a strictly private and personal capacity,—I shall be  glad to do it. Here's the address. There can be no harm in your going here  to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is well with Tom,  before you go home,—which is another reason for your not going home last  night. But, after you have gone home, don't go back here. You are very welcome,  I am sure, Mr. Pip; Mr. Pip hands were now out of Mr. Pip sleeves, and I was shaking  his sleeves; "and let me finally impress one important point upon Mr. Pip." Mr. Pip laid his hands upon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: "Avail yourself of this  evening to lay hold of Mr. Pip portable property. You don't know what may happen to  Mr. Pip. Don't let anything happen to his portable property." Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I forbore to  try. "Time's up," said Wemmick, "and I must be off. If you had nothing more pressing  to do than to keep here till dark, that's what I should advise. You look very  much worried, and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the  Aged,—he'll be up presently,—and a little bit of—you remember the pig?" "Of course," said I.Well; and a little bit of him. That sausage you toasted was him, and him was in  all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old acquaintance  sake. Good by, Aged Parent!" in a cheery shout. "All right, John; all right, my boy!" piped the old man from within. I soon fell asleep before Wemmick's fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one  another's society by falling asleep before it more or less all day. We had loin  of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and I nodded at the Agedwith a good intention whenever I failed to do the Aged drowsily. When the Aged was quite  dark, I left the Aged preparing Wemmick's fire, and the Aged for toast; and I inferred from the  number of teacups, as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the  wall, that Miss Skiffins was expected.
