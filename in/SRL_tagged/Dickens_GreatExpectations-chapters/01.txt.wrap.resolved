 My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant  tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. So, I  called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of Pirrip tombstone and  my sister,—Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my  father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith (for Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith  days were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what  Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith were like were unreasonably derived from Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith tombstones. The shape of  the letters on  My father's, gave me an odd idea that  My father was a square, stout,  dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the  inscription, "Also Georgiana Wife of the Above," I drew a childish conclusion  that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each  about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their  grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine,—who  gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal  struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that five little brothers of mine,—who   had  all been born on five little brothers of mine,—who   backs with five little brothers of mine,—who   hands in five little brothers of mine,—who   trousers-pockets, and  had never taken five little brothers of mine,—who   out in this state of existence. Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound,  twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of the  identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon  towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place  overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this  parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that  Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the  aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond  the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered  cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was  the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was  the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and  beginning to cry, was Pip. "Hold your noise!" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the  graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep still, you little devil, or I'll  cut your throat!" A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on a man leg. A man with no  hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round A man with no  hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head head. A man who  had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by  flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and  glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as A man with no  hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head seized me by  the chin. "Oh! Don't cut my throat, sir," I pleaded in terror. "Pray don't do it, sir." "Tell us your name!" said sir. "Quick!" "Pip, sir." "Once more," said the man, staring at me. "Give your name mouth!" "Pip. Pip, sir." "Show us where you live," said sir. "Pint out the place!" I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees  and pollards, a mile or more from the church. sir, after looking at sir for a moment, turned me upside down, and emptied  my pockets. There was nothing in my pockets but a piece of bread. When the churchcame to itself,—for itself,—for was so sudden and strong that itself,—for made a piece of bread go head over  heels before sir, and I saw the steeple under my feet,—when the church came to  the church, I say, I was seated on a high tombstone, trembling while itself,—for ate a piece of bread ravenously. "You young dog," said sir, licking sir lips, "what fat cheeks you ha' got." I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my years, and  not strong. "Darn me if I couldn't eat em," said the man, with a threatening shake of em  head, "and if I han't half a mind to't!" I earnestly expressed my hope that em wouldn't, and held tighter to the  tombstone on which em had put me; partly, to keep sir upon it; partly, to  keep sir from crying. "Now lookee here!" said sir. "Where's your mother?" "There, sir!" said sir sir started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over sir shoulder. "There, sir!" I timidly explained. "Also Georgiana. That's your mother." "Oh!" said sir, coming back. "And is that your father alonger your mother?" "Yes, sir," said I; "sir too; late of this parish." "Ha!" sir muttered then, considering. "Who d'ye live with,—supposin' you're  kindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?" "My sister, sir,—Mrs. Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,  sir." "Blacksmith, eh?" said Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,  sir.". And looked down at Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,  sir." leg. After darkly looking at Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,  sir." leg and me several times, Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,  sir." came closer to my  tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,  sir." could hold me;  so that Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,  sir." eyes looked most powerfully down into mine, and mine looked most  helplessly up into Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,  sir.". "Now lookee here," Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,  sir." said, "the question being whether you're to be let to  live. You know what a file is?" "Yes, sir." "And you know what wittles is?" "Yes, sir." After each question sir tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a greater  sense of helplessness and danger. "You get me a file." sir tilted me again. "And you get what wittles." sir tilted me  again. "You bring 'em both to me." sir tilted me again. "Or I'll have your heart  and liver out." sir tilted me again. I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to sir with both hands,  and said, "If you would kindly please to let me keep upright, sir, perhaps I  shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more." sir gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped over the church  own weathercock. Then, sir held me by both arms, in an upright position on the  top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:— "You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and these fearful terms:— wittles. You bring  the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and you never dare  to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person  as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to live. You fail, or you go  from my words in any partickler, no matter how small it is, and your heart and  your liver shall be tore out, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may  think I am. There's a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man  I am a Angel. young man   hears the words I speak. young man   has a  secret way pecooliar to young man  , of getting at a boy, and at young man   heart, and at  young man   liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide a boy from that young  man. A boy may lock A boy door, may be warm in bed, may tuck A boy up, may draw  the clothes over A boy head, may think A boy comfortable and safe, but that  young man   will softly creep and creep A boy way to A boy and tear young man   open. I am a  keeping young man   from harming of you at the present moment, with great  difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold young man   off of your inside. Now,  what do you say?" I said that I would get young man   the file, and I would get young man   what broken bits of  food I could, and I would come to young man   at the Battery, early in the morning. "Say Lord strike you dead if you don't!" said young man  . I said so, and young man   took me down. "Now," young man   pursued, "you remember what you've undertook, and you remember that young man  , and you get home!" "Goo-good night, sir," I faltered. "Much of that!" said young man  , glancing about young man   over the cold wet flat. "I wish I  was a frog. Or a eel!" At the same time, young man   hugged young man   shuddering body in both young man   arms,—clasping  young man  , as if to hold young man   together,—and limped towards the low church  wall. As I saw young man   go, picking young man   way among the nettles, and among the  brambles that bound the green mounds, young man   looked in my young eyes as if young man   were  eluding the hands of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out of the dead people  graves, to get a twist upon young man   ankle and pull young man   in. When young man   came to the low church wall, young man   got over the low church wall, like a man whose legs were  numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for young man  . When I saw young man   turning,  I set my face towards home, and made the best use of my legs. But presently I  looked over my shoulder, and saw young man   going on again towards the river, still  hugging young man   in both arms, and picking young man   way with young man   sore feet among the  great stones dropped into the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when  the rains were heavy or the tide was in. the marshes here were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped to look  after young man  ; and the river was just another horizontal line, not nearly so broad  nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense  black lines intermixed. On the edge of the river I could faintly make out the  only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright;  one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped  cask upon a pole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet,  with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. young man   was  limping on towards this latter, as if young man   were a pirate come to life, and come  down, and going back to hook young man   up again. It gave me a terrible turn when  I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting the cattle heads to gaze after young man  , I  wondered whether the cattle thought so too. I looked all round for the horrible young  man, and could see no signs of the horrible young  man. But now I was frightened again, and ran  home without stopping.
