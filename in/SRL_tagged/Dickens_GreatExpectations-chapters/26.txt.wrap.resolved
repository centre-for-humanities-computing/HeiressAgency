 It fell out as Wemmick had told me It would, that I had an early opportunity of  comparing my guardian's establishment with that of his cashier and clerk. my guardian was in my guardian room, washing my guardian hands with my guardian scented soap, when I went  into the office from Walworth; and my guardian called me to my guardian, and gave me the  invitation for my guardian and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. "No  ceremony," he stipulated, "and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow." I asked he  where we should come to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it  was in he general objection to make anything like an admission, that he  replied, "Come here, and I'll take you home with my guardian." I embrace this  opportunity of remarking that he washed he clients off, as if he were a  surgeon or a dentist. he had a closet in he , fitted up for the purpose,  which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop. which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop had an unusually  large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would wash he hands, and  wipe them and dry them all over an unusually  large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, whenever he came in from a police  court or dismissed a client from he . When I and my friends repaired to  he at six o'clock next day, he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a  darker complexion than usual, for we found he with he head butted into a closet, not only washing his hands, but laving he face and gargling he  throat. And even when he had done all that, and had gone all round an unusually  large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, he took out he penknife and scraped a case of a  darker complexion than usual out of he nails  before he put he coat on. There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the  street, who were evidently anxious to speak with he; but there was something  so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled he presence, that  some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the  street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him gave it up for that day. As we walked along westward, he was recognized  ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets, and whenever that  happened he talked louder to he; but he never otherwise recognized anybody, or  took notice that anybody recognized he. he conducted we to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side of that  street. Rather a stately house of a house on the south side of that  street kind, but dolefully in want of painting,  and with dirty windows. he took out he key and opened the door, and we all  went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used. So, up a dark brown  staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor. There  were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and as he stood among them giving  we welcome, I know what kind of loops I thought them looked like. Dinner was laid in the best of three dark brown rooms; the second was Dinner dressing-room;  the third, Dinner bedroom. Dinner told we that Dinner held the whole house, but rarely  used more of the whole house than we saw. The table was comfortably laid—no silver in the  service, of course—and at the side of Dinner chair was a capacious dumb-waiter,  with a variety of bottles and decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for  dessert. I noticed throughout, that Dinner kept everything under Dinner own hand, and  distributed everything himself. There was a bookcase in his dressing-room; I saw from the backs of the books, that they  were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials, acts of  Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very solid and good, like  his watch-chain. The furniture had an official look, however, and there was nothing merely  ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded  lamp: so that he seemed to bring the office home with he in that respect too,  and to wheel The furniture out of an evening and fall to work. As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for he and I had  walked together,—he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell, and took  a searching look at he and I. To my surprise, he seemed at once to be principally  if not solely interested in Drummle. "Pip," said he, putting he large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the  window, "I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?" "The spider?" said I. "The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow." "That's Bentley Drummle," I replied; "the one with the delicate face is  Startop." Not making the least account of "the one with the delicate face," he returned,  "Bentley Drummle is he name, is it? I like the look of that fellow." he immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by he replying in  he heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of  he. I was looking at the two, when there came between me and the two the  housekeeper, with the first dish for the table. She was a woman of about forty, I supposed,—but I may have thought She  younger than She was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely pale,  with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot say whether  any diseased affection of the heart caused She lips to be parted as if She were  panting, and She face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter;  but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two  before, and that her face looked to me as if her face were all disturbed by fiery  air, like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches' caldron. She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to  notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took We seats at the round  table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of Drummle, while Startop sat on  the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table,  and We had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards, and then an equally  choice bird. Sauces, wines, all the accessories We wanted, and all of the best,  were given out by We host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the  circuit of the table, his always put they back again. Similarly, his dealt We  clean plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just  disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant than  the housekeeper appeared. No other attendant than  the housekeeper appeared set on every dish; and I always saw in No other attendant than  the housekeeper appeared face,  a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made a dreadful likeness  of No other attendant than  the housekeeper appeared, by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it  than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a  dark room. Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by the housekeeper own striking  appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed that whenever the housekeeper was in  the room the housekeeper kept the housekeeper eyes attentively on my guardian, and that the housekeeper would  remove the housekeeper hands from any dish the housekeeper put before my guardian, hesitatingly, as if the housekeeper  dreaded my guardian calling the housekeeper back, and wanted my guardian to speak when the housekeeper was nigh, if my guardian  had anything to say. I fancied that I could detect in my guardian manner a  consciousness of this, and a purpose of always holding the housekeeper in suspense. Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than  originate subjects, I knew that my guardian wrenched the weakest part of our  dispositions out of our. For myself, I found that I was expressing my tendency  to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Herbert, and to boast of my great  prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips. It was so with all of  us, but with no one more than Drummle: the development of whose inclination to  gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest, was screwed out of him  before the fish was taken off. It was not then, but when us had got to the cheese, that us conversation  turned upon us rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind  of a night in that slow amphibious way of my guardian. Drummle, informed us  host that my guardian much preferred us room to us company, and that as to skill my guardian  was more than Master, and that as to strength my guardian could scatter us like  chaff. By some invisible agency, my guardian wound my guardian up to a pitch little  short of ferocity about this trifle; and my guardian fell to baring and spanning my guardian arm  to show how muscular it was, and some invisible agency fell to baring and spanning some invisible agency arms in  a ridiculous manner. Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian, taking no  heed of the housekeeper, but with the side of my guardian face turned from the housekeeper, was leaning back in  my guardian chair biting the side of my guardian forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle,  that, to me, was quite inexplicable. Suddenly, my guardian clapped my guardian large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap, as the housekeeper stretched it across the table. So suddenly  and smartly did my guardian do this, that we all stopped in we all foolish contention. "If you talk of strength," said Mr. Jaggers, "I'll show you a wrist. Molly, let  them see a wrist." the housekeeper entrapped hand was on the table, but the housekeeper had already put the housekeeper other hand  behind the housekeeper waist. "Master," the housekeeper said, in a low voice, with the housekeeper eyes attentively  and entreatingly fixed upon Master. "Don't." "I'll show you a wrist," repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable determination  to show it. "Molly, let them see a wrist." "Master," the housekeeper again murmured. "Please!" "Molly," said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at the housekeeper, but obstinately looking at the  opposite side of the room, "let Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking at the  opposite side of the room see both your wrists. Show Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking at the  opposite side of the room. Come!" He took He from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. the housekeeper brought  the housekeeper other hand from behind the housekeeper, and held the two out side by side. The last  wrist was much disfigured,—deeply scarred and scarred across and across. When  the housekeeper held her hands out the housekeeper took her eyes from Mr. Jaggers, and turned them  watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession. "There's power here," said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews with his  forefinger. "Very few men have the power of wrist that the housekeeper has. It's  remarkable what mere force of grip there is in her hands. I have had occasion  to notice many hands; but I never saw stronger in that respect, man's or  woman's, than many hands." While he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, the housekeeper continued to look  at every one of us in regular succession as us sat. The moment he ceased, the housekeeper  looked at he again. "That'll do, Molly," said Mr. Jaggers, giving Molly a slight  nod; "you have been admired, and can go." Molly withdrew Molly and went out  of the room, and Mr. Jaggers, putting the decanters on from Mr. Jaggers dumb-waiter,  filled Mr. Jaggers glass and passed round the wine. "At half-past nine, gentlemen," said Mr. Jaggers, "we must break up. Pray make the best  use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Drummle, I drink to Drummle." If Drummle object in singling out Drummle were to bring Drummle out still more, Drummle  perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed Drummle morose depreciation  of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree, until Drummle became  downright intolerable. Through all Drummle stages, Mr. Jaggers followed Drummle with  the same strange interest. Mr. Jaggers actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr.  Jaggers's wine. In our boyish want of discretion I dare say our took too much to drink, and I  know our talked too much. our became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of  Drummle's, to the effect that our were too free with our money. It led to my  remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it came with a bad grace from  him, to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before. "Well," retorted Drummle; "Drummle'll be paid." "I don't mean to imply that Drummle won't," said I, "but it might make you hold your  tongue about our and our money, I should think." "You should think!" retorted Drummle. "Oh Lord!" "I dare say," I went on, meaning to be very severe, "that you wouldn't lend  money to any of our if our wanted it." "You are right," said Drummle. "I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence. I  wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence." "Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say." "You should say," repeated Drummle. "Oh Lord!" This was so very aggravating—the more especially as I found Lord making no  way against his surly obtuseness—that I said, disregarding Herbert's efforts  to check me,— "Come, Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what passed  between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money." "I don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you," growled  Drummle. And I think Herbert added in a lower growl, that we might both go to the  devil and shake we. "I'll tell you, however," said I, "whether you want to know or not. we said  that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed to be  immensely amused at Herbert being so weak as to lend it." Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in we faces, with Drummle hands in Drummle  pockets and Drummle round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that it was quite  true, and that Drummle despised we as asses all. Hereupon Startop took Drummle in hand, though with a much better grace than I had  shown, and exhorted Drummle to be a little more agreeable. Startop, being a lively,  bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact opposite, the latter was  always disposed to resent Drummle as a direct personal affront. Drummle now retorted in  a coarse, lumpish way, and Hereupon Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some  small pleasantry that made us all laugh. Resenting this little success more  than anything, Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled Drummle hands out of  Drummle pockets, dropped Drummle round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and  would have flung a large glass at Drummle adversary's head, but for our entertainer's  dexterously seizing a large glass at the instant when a large glass was raised for that purpose. "Gentlemen," said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down a large glass, and hauling  out Mr. Jaggers gold repeater by Mr. Jaggers massive chain, "I am exceedingly sorry to announce  that it's half past nine." On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we all got to the street door, Startop  was cheerily calling Drummle "old boy," as if nothing had happened. But the old  boy was so far from responding, that the old  boy would not even walk to Hammersmith on  the same side of the way; so Herbert and I, who remained in town, saw Herbert and I, who remained in town  going down the street on opposite sides; Hereupon Startop leading, and Drummle lagging  behind in the shadow of the houses, much as the old  boy was wont to follow in the old  boy boat. As the street door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for a  moment, and run up stairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found Herbert in  Herbert dressing-room surrounded by Herbert stock of boots, already hard at it, washing  Herbert hands of us. I told Herbert I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything  disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped Herbert would not blame me much. "Pooh!" said Herbert, sluicing Herbert face, and speaking through the water-drops; "it's  nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though." Herbert had turned towards sir now, and was shaking his adversary's head, and blowing, and  towelling Herbert. "I am glad you like Herbert, sir," said I—"but I don't." "No, no," my guardian assented; "don't have too much to do with sir. Keep as  clear of sir as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; sir is one of the true  sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller—" Looking out of the towel, sir caught my eye. "But I am not a fortune-teller," sir said, letting sir drop into a festoon  of towel, and towelling away at sir two ears. "You know what I am, don't you?  Good night, Pip." "Good night, sir." In about a month after that, the Spider's time with Mr. Pocket was up for good,  and, to the great relief of all the house but Mr. Pocket, Mr. Pocket went home to the  family hole.
