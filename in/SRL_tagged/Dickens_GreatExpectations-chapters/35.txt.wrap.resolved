 It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and the gap  a grave made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my sister in my sister  chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That the place could  possibly be, without my sister, was something my mind seemed unable to compass; and  whereas my sister had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late, I had now the  strangest ideas that my sister was coming towards me in the street, or that my sister would  presently knock at the door. In my rooms too, with which my sister had never been at  all associated, there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual  suggestion of the sound of my sister voice or the turn of my sister face or figure, as if  my sister were still alive and had been often there. Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my sisterwith much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist  without much tenderness. Under its influence (and perhaps to make up for the  want of the softer feeling) I was seized with a violent indignation against the  assailant from whom my sister had suffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient  proof I could have revengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last  extremity. Having written to Joe, to offer Joe consolation, and to assure Joe that I would  come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the curious state of  mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the morning, and alighted at the  Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the forge. It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times when I was  a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me, vividly returned.  But they returned with a gentle tone upon they that softened even the edge of  Tickler. For now, the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart  that the day must come when the day would be well for my memory that others walking  in the sunshine should be softened as others walking  in the sunshine thought of me. At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had put in  a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd persons, each  ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage,—as if that  instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody,—were posted at  the front door; and in one of that  instrument could possibly communicate any comfort I recognized a postboy discharged from the  Boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on that  instrument could possibly communicate any comfort bridal morning, in  consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride him horse  clasped round the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and  most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of  the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy)  knocked at the door,—implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief to  have strength remaining to knock for myself. Mr. Trabbopened the door, and showed me into the best parlor. Here, Mr. Trabb had taken  unto Mr. Trabb the best table, and had got all the leaves up, and was holding a  kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity of black pins. At the moment  of my arrival, Mr. Trabb had just finished putting somebody's hat into black  long-clothes, like an African baby; so Mr. Trabb held out Mr. Trabb hand for an African baby. But I,  misled by the action, and confused by the occasion, shook hands with Mr. Trabb with  every testimony of warm affection. Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under Poor dear Joe  chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where, as chief mourner,  Poor dear Joe had evidently been stationed by Mr. Trabb. When I bent down and said to Poor dear Joe,  "Poor dear Joe, how are you?" Poor dear Joe said, "Pip, old chap, you knowed her when her were  a fine figure of a—" and clasped his hand and said no more. Biddy, looking very neat and modest in Biddy black dress, went quietly here and  there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as I thought it not a  time for talking I went and sat down near Poor dear Joe, and there began to wonder in  what part of the house it—her—my sister—was. The air of the parlor being  faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I looked about for the table of  refreshments; it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the  gloom, but there was a cut-up plum cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges,  and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as  ornaments, but had never seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of  sherry. Standing at the table of  refreshments, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook  in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing  himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my attention. The moment himself  succeeded, himself came over to himself (breathing sherry and crumbs), and said in a  subdued voice, "May I, dear sir?" and did. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble;  the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going  to "follow," and were all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into  ridiculous bundles. "Which I meantersay, Pip," Joe whispered me, as We were being what Mr. Trabb  called "formed" in the parlor, two and two,—and it was dreadfully like a  preparation for some grim kind of dance; "which I meantersay, sir, as I would  in preference have carried her to the church myself, along with three or four  friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms, but it were  considered wot the neighbors would look down on such and would be of opinions  as wot were wanting in respect." "Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!" cried Mr. Trabb   at this point, in a depressed  business-like voice. "Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are ready!" So We put We pocket-handkerchiefs to We faces, as if We noses were  bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and Pumblechook; Mr. and  Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the  kitchen door, and, The remains of my poor sister being a point of Undertaking ceremony that the six  bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with  a white border, the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs,  shuffling and blundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,—the  postboy and his comrade. The neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we were  much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and vigorous  part of the community making dashes now and then to cut we off, and lying in  wait to intercept we at points of vantage. At such times the more exuberant  among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner  of expectancy, "Here them come!" "Here them are!" and we were all but cheered.  In this progress I was much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being  behind me, persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my  streaming hatband, and smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted  by the excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited  and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession. And now the range of marshes lay clear before we, with the sails of the ships  on the river growing out of the sails of the ships  on the river; and we went into the churchyard, close to the  graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and Also  Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was laid quietly in the  earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the light wind strewed it with  beautiful shadows of clouds and trees. Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing, I desire  to say no more than no was all addressed to me; and that even when those noble  passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world  and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth  long in one stay, I heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young  gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property. When we got back, him had  the hardihood to tell me that him wished my sister could have known I had done  my sister so much honor, and to hint that my sister would have considered it reasonably  purchased at the price of my sister death. After that, him drank all the rest of the  sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked (which I have since  observed to be customary in such cases) as if they were of quite another race  from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal. Finally, him went away with  Mr. and Mrs. Hubble,—to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the  Jolly Bargemen that him was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest  benefactor. When Mr. and Mrs. Hubble,—to were all gone, and when Mr. Trabb and Mr. Trabb men—but not Mr. Trabb Boy; I looked  for Mr. Trabb—had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too, the house  felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a cold dinner  together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old kitchen, and Joe was  so exceedingly particular what Joe did with Joe knife and fork and the  saltcellar and what not, that there was great restraint upon we. But after  dinner, when I made Joe take Joe pipe, and when I had loitered with Joe about  the forge, and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside  his pipe, we got on better. I noticed that after the funeral Joe changed Joe clothes  so far, as to make a compromise between Joe Sunday dress and working dress; in  which the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man the Man was. the Man was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little room,  and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great thing in  making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing in, I took an  opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk. "Biddy," said I, "I think you might have written to me about these sad matters." "Do you, Mr. Pip?" said Biddy. "I should have written if I had thought that." "Don't suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider that you  ought to have thought that." "Do you, Mr. Pip?" Biddy was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with Biddy, that  I did not like the thought of making Biddy cry again. After looking a little at  Biddy downcast eyes as Biddy walked beside me, I gave up that point. "I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?" "Oh! I can't do so, me," said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still of  quiet conviction. "I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am going to Mrs. Hubble  to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr. Gargery, together,  until Mr. Gargery settles down." "How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo—" "How am I going to live?" repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary flush  upon Biddy face. "I'll tell you, me. I am going to try to get the place of  mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be well recommended by  all the neighbors, and I hope I can be industrious and patient, and teach  me while I teach others. You know, me," pursued Biddy, with a smile,  as Biddy raised Biddy eyes to my face, "the new schools are not like the old, but I  learnt a good deal from Biddy after that time, and have had time since then to  improve." "I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances." "Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature," murmured Biddy. It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well! I  thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further with  Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes. "I have not heard the particulars of my sister's death, Biddy." "They are very slight, poor thing. my sister had been in one of my sister bad  states—though they had got better of late, rather than worse—for four days,  when my sister came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and said quite  plainly, 'Joe.' As my sister had never said any word for a long while, I ran and  fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. my sister made signs to me that my sister wanted Mr. Gargery  to sit down close to my sister, and wanted me to put my sister arms round Mr. Gargery neck. So I  put she wanted him  to sit down close to her, and wanted me to put her arms round his neck round his neck, and my sister laid my sister head down on Mr. Gargery shoulder quite  content and satisfied. And so my sister presently said 'Joe' again, and once  'Pardon,' and once 'Pip.' And so my sister never lifted her head up any more, and her head  was just an hour later when we laid her head down on my sister own bed, because we found  my sister was gone." Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were coming  out, were blurred in my own sight. "Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?" "Nothing." "Do you know what is become of Orlick?" "I should think from the color of his clothes that his is working in the  quarries." "Of course you have seen his then?—Why are you looking at that dark tree in  the lane?" "I saw his there, on the night my sister died." "That was not the last time either, Biddy?" "No; I have seen his there, since we have been walking here.—It is of no  use," said Biddy, laying Biddy hand upon my arm, as I was for running out, "you  know I would not deceive you; his was not there a minute, and his is gone." It revived my utmost indignation to find that Biddy was still pursued by this  fellow, and I felt inveterate against she was still pursued by this  fellow. I told Biddy so, and told Biddy that I  would spend any money or take any pains to drive his out of that country. By  degrees Biddy led me into more temperate talk, and Biddy told me how Joe loved me,  and how Joe never complained of anything,—she didn't say, of me; Biddy had no  need; I knew what Biddy meant,—but ever did Joe duty in Joe way of life, with a  strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a gentle heart. "Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for Joe," said I; "and Biddy, we must  often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down here now. I am  not going to leave Joe Joe alone." Biddy said never a single word. "Biddy, don't you hear me?" "Yes, me." "Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,—which appears to me to be in bad  taste, Biddy,—what do you mean?" "What do I mean?" asked Biddy, timidly. "Biddy," said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, "I must request to know  what you mean by this?" "By this?" said Biddy. "Now, don't echo," I retorted. "You used not to echo, Biddy." "Used not!" said Biddy. "O me! Used!" Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another silent  turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position. "Biddy," said I, "I made a remark respecting my coming down here often, to see  Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the goodness, Biddy, to  tell me why." "Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?" asked Biddy,  stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the stars with a  clear and honest eye. "O dear me!" said I, as if I found me compelled to give up Biddy in  despair. "This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don't say any more,  if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much." For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and when I  went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of Biddy as I could,  in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of  the day. As often as I was restless in the night, and that was every quarter of  an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what an injury, what an injustice,  Biddy had done me. Early in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and looking  in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There I stood, for  minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of health and strength  upon Joe face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for  Joe were shining on it. "Good by, dear Joe!—No, don't wipe it off—for God's sake, give me your  blackened hand!—I shall be down soon and often." "Never too soon, sir," said Joe, "and never too often, Pip!" Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and a  crust of bread. "Biddy," said I, when I gave Biddy my hand at parting, "I am not  angry, but I am hurt." "No, don't be hurt," Biddy pleaded quite pathetically; "let only me be hurt, if I  have been ungenerous." Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to me, as  I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy was quite  right, all I can say is,—they were quite right too.
