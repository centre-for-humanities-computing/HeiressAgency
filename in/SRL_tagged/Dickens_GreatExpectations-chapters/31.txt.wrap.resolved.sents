 On our arrival in Denmark, our found the king and queen of that country elevated  in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court.
The whole of the Danish  nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble boy in the wash-leather  boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer with a dirty face who seemed to  have risen from the people late in life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in  its hair and a pair of white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine  appearance.
My gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I  could have wished that My gifted townsman curls and forehead had been more probable.
Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded.
The  late king of that country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough  at the time of The  late king of the country decease, but to have taken a cough   with The  late king of the country to the tomb, and to  have brought a cough   back.
The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round  The royal phantom truncheon, to which The royal phantom had the appearance of occasionally referring, and  that too, with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference  which were suggestive of a state of mortality.
It was this, I conceive, which  led to the Shade's being advised by the gallery to "turn over!
"—a  recommendation which it took extremely ill.
It was likewise to be noted of this  majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out  a long time and walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely  contiguous wall.
This occasioned This terrors to be received derisively.
The  Queen of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically brazen, was  considered by the public to have too much brass about The  Queen; The  Queen chin being  attached to The  Queen diadem by a broad band of that metal (as if The  Queen had a gorgeous  toothache), The  Queen waist being encircled by another, and each of The  Queen arms by  another, so that The  Queen was openly mentioned as "the kettle-drum."
The noble boy  in the ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing The noble boy  in the ancestral boots, as The noble boy  in the ancestral boots were in  one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a clergyman,  and a person of the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match, on the  authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes  were judged.
This gradually led to a want of toleration for The noble boy  in the ancestral boots, and even—on  The noble boy  in the ancestral boots being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral  service—to the general indignation taking the form of nuts.
Lastly, Ophelia  was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, Ophelia   had  taken off Ophelia   white muslin scarf, folded her white muslin scarf up, and buried her white muslin scarf, a sulky man who  had been long cooling The noble boy  in the ancestral boots impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row  of the gallery, growled, "Now the baby's put to bed let's have supper!"
Which,  to say the least of it, was out of keeping.
Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful  effect.
Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or state a doubt,  the public helped undecided Prince out with the public.
As for example; on a question or state whether  'twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes, and some no, and some  inclining to both opinions said "Toss up for it;" and quite a Debating Society  arose.
When undecided Prince asked what should such fellows as undecided Prince do crawling between earth  and heaven, undecided Prince was encouraged with loud cries of "Hear, hear!"
When undecided Prince appeared  with undecided Prince stocking disordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by  one very neat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat  iron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of undecided Prince  leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given undecided Prince.
On undecided Prince  taking the recorders,—very like a little black flute that had just been  played in the orchestra and handed out at the door,—he was called upon  unanimously for Rule Britannia.
When undecided Prince recommended the player not to saw the  air thus, undecided Prince said, "And don't you do the  air, neither; you're a deal  worse than undecided Prince!"
And I grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle  on every one of these occasions.
But undecided Prince greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the appearance of a  primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house on one side,  and a turnpike gate on the other.
Mr. Wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak,  being descried entering at turnpike, the gravedigger was admonished in a  friendly way, "Look out!
Here's the undertaker a coming, to see how you're a  getting on with your work!"
I believe it is well known in a constitutional  country that Mr. Wopsle   could not possibly have returned the skull, after  moralizing over the skull, without dusting Mr. Wopsle   fingers on a white napkin taken from  Mr. Wopsle   breast; but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass  without the comment, "Wai-ter!"
The arrival of the body for interment (in an  empty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a general joy,  which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of an individual  obnoxious to identification.
The joy attended Mr. Wopsle   through Mr. Wopsle   struggle  with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave, and slackened no more  until Mr. Wopsle   had tumbled the king off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches  from the ankles upward.
We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle  ; but they  were too hopeless to be persisted in.
Therefore We had sat, feeling keenly for  Mr. Wopsle  , but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear.
I laughed in spite of myself  all the time, the whole thing was so droll; and yet I had a latent impression  that there was something decidedly fine in Mr. Wopsle  's elocution,—not for  old associations' sake, I am afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary,  very up-hill and down-hill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any  natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.
When the tragedy was over, and himself had been called for and hooted, I said to  Herbert, "Let us go at once, or perhaps us shall meet himself."
us made all the haste us could down stairs, but us were not quick enough  either.
Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of  eyebrow, who caught my eyes as us advanced, and said, when us came up with  him,— "Mr. Pip and friend?"
Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.
"Mr. Waldengarver," said the man, "would be glad to have the honor."
"Waldengarver?"
I repeated—when Herbert murmured in my ear, "Probably Wopsle."
"Oh!"
said I.
"Yes.
Shall we follow you?"
"A few steps, please."
When us were in a side alley, Herbert turned and asked, "How  did you think Herbert looked?—I dressed Herbert."
I don't know what Herbert had looked like, except a funeral; with the addition of a  large Danish sun or star hanging round Herbert neck by a blue ribbon, that had  given Herbert the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office.
But I said Herbert had looked very nice.
"When Herbert come to the grave," said our conductor, "Herbert showed Herbert cloak  beautiful.
But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when Herbert see the  ghost in the queen's apartment, Herbert might have made more of Herbert stockings."
I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door, into a  sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it.
Here Mr. Wopsle was divesting  Mr. Wopsle of Mr. Wopsle Danish garments, and here there was just room for us to look at  Mr. Wopsle over one another's shoulders, by keeping the packing-case door, or lid,  wide open.
"Gentlemen," said Mr. Wopsle, "I am proud to see you.
I hope, Mr. Pip, you will  excuse my sending round.
I had the happiness to know you in former times, and  the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged, on the noble  and the affluent."
Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to get  Mr. Waldengarver out of Mr. Waldengarver princely sables.
"Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver," said the owner of that property, "or  you'll bust 'em.
Bust 'em, and you'll bust five-and-thirty shillings.
Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair.
Keep quiet in your chair  now, and leave 'em to me."
With that, Mr. Waldengarver went upon Mr. Waldengarver knees, and began to flay Mr. Waldengarver victim; who, on the  first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward with your chair  , but for there being no room to fall anyhow.
I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play.
But then, Mr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,— "Gentlemen, how did it seem to Gentlemen, to go, in front?"
Herbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), "Capitally."
So I said  "Capitally."
"How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?"
said Mr.  Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.
Herbert said from behind (again poking me), "Massive and concrete."
So I said  boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it, "Massive and  concrete."
"I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen," said Mr. Waldengarver, with an  air of dignity, in spite of Mr. Waldengarver being ground against the wall at the time, and  holding on by the seat of your chair  .
"But I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver," said the man who was on Mr. Waldengarver  knees, "in which you're out in your reading.
Now mind!
I don't care who says  contrairy; I tell you so.
You're out in your reading of Hamlet when you get  your legs in profile.
The last Hamlet as I dressed, made the same mistakes in  his reading at rehearsal, till I got his to put a large red wafer on each of  his shins, and then at that rehearsal (which was the last) I went in front,  sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever sir brought sir into profile,  I called out "I don't see no wafers!"
And at night sir was lovely."
Mr. Waldengarver smiled at Mr. Waldengarver, as much as to say "a faithful Dependent—I  overlook Mr. Waldengarver folly;" and then said aloud, "My view is a little classic and  thoughtful for them here; but them will improve, them will improve."
Herbert and I said together, O, no doubt them would improve.
"Did you observe, gentlemen," said Mr. Waldengarver, "that there was a man in  the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service,—I mean, the  representation?"
Herbert and I basely replied that Herbert and I rather thought Herbert and I had noticed such a man.
I added,  "He was drunk, no doubt."
"O dear no, sir," said Mr. Wopsle  , "not drunk.
Mr. Wopsle   employer would see to that,  sir.
His employer would not allow Mr. Wopsle   to be drunk."
"You know His employer?"
said Mr. Wopsle   shut Mr. Wopsle   eyes, and opened His employer again; performing both ceremonies  very slowly.
"You must have observed, gentlemen," said Mr. Wopsle  , "an ignorant and a  blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low  malignity, who went through—I will not say sustained—the rôle (if I may  use a French expression) of Claudius, King of Denmark.
That is his employer,  gentlemen.
Such is the profession!"
Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr. Wopsle  if Mr. Wopsle   had been in despair, I was so sorry for Mr. Wopsle   as it was, that I took the  opportunity of Mr. Wopsle   turning round to have Mr. Wopsle   braces put on,—which jostled us  out at the doorway,—to ask Herbert what Herbert thought of having Herbert home to  supper?
Herbert said Herbert thought it would be kind to do so; therefore I invited  Herbert, and Herbert went to Barnard's with us, wrapped up to the eyes, and us did us  best for Herbert, and Herbert sat until two o'clock in the morning, reviewing Herbert  success and developing Herbert plans.
I forget in detail what they were, but I have  a general recollection that Herbert was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end  with crushing it; inasmuch as Herbert decease would leave his decease utterly bereft and  without a chance or hope.
Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella, and  miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I had to  give my hand in marriage to Herbert's Clara, or play Hamlet to Miss Havisham's  Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing twenty words of it.
