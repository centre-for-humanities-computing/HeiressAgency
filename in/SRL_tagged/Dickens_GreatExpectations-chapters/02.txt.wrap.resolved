 My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I, and had  established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because herself had  brought me up "by hand." Having at that time to find out for I what the  expression meant, and knowing herself to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much  in the habit of laying the  expression upon herself husband as well as upon I, I supposed that  Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand. herself was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general impression  that herself must have made Joe Gargery marry herself by hand. Joe Gargery was a fair man, with  curls of flaxen hair on each side of Joe Gargery smooth face, and with eyes of such a  very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with they own  whites. Joe Gargery was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear  fellow,—a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness. My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing redness of  skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible herself washed herself  with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. herself was tall and bony, and almost always  wore a coarse apron, fastened over herself figure behind with two loops, and having  a square impregnable bib in front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. herself  made it a powerful merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe Gargery, that  herself wore a coarse apron so much. Though I really see no reason why herself should have  worn a coarse apron at all; or why, if herself did wear a coarse apron at all, herself should not have taken a coarse apron  off, every day of herself life. Joe Gargery's forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the  dwellings in our country were,—most of Joe's forge, at that time. When I ran home  from the churchyard, Joe's forge was shut up, and Joe Gargery was sitting alone in the  kitchen. Joe Gargery and I being fellow-sufferers, and having confidences as such, Joe Gargeryimparted a confidence to me, the moment I raised the latch of the door and  peeped in at Joe Gargery opposite to it, sitting in the chimney corner. "Joe Gargery Joe Gargery has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And Pip's out now,  making it a baker's dozen." "Is Pip?" "Yes, Pip," said Joe Gargery; "and what's worse, Pip's got Tickler with Pip." At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round  and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler was a wax-ended  piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame. "Pip sot down," said Joe Gargery, "and Pip got up, and Pip made a grab at Tickler, and  Pip Ram-paged out. That's what Pip did," said Joe Gargery, slowly clearing the firebetween the lower bars with the poker, and looking at the fire; "Pip Ram-paged out,  Pip." "Has Pip been gone long, Joe Gargery?" I always treated Joe Gargery as a larger species of  child, and as no more than my equal. "Well," said Joe Gargery, glancing up at the Dutch clock, "Pip's been on the Ram-page,  this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. Pip's a coming! Get behind the door,  old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you." I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open, and  finding an obstruction behind the door, immediately divined the cause, and applied  Tickler to Tickler further investigation. Tickler concluded by throwing me—I often  served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad to get hold of me on any  terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his  great leg. "Where have you been, you young monkey?" said Joe Gargery, stamping Tickler foot.  "Tell me directly what you've been doing to wear me away with fret and fright  and worrit, or I'd have you out of that corner if you was fifty Pips, and Joe Gargery  was five hundred Gargerys." "I have only been to "Churchyard," said I, from my stool, crying and rubbing  me. "Churchyard!" repeated my sister. "If it warn't for me you'd have been to "Churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by hand?" "You did," said I. "And why did I do it, I should like to know?" exclaimed my sister. I whimpered, "I don't know." "I don't!" said my sister. "I'd never do it again! I know that. I may truly say  I've never had this apron of mine off since born you were. It's bad enough to  be a blacksmith's wife (and him a Gargery) without being your mother." My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at the fire.  For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the mysterious young  man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was under to commit a  larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me in the avenging coals. "Hah!" said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to Mrs. Joe station. "Churchyard, indeed!  You may well say churchyard, you two." One of us, by the by, had not said the by at  all. "You'll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one of these days, and O,  a pr-r-recious pair you'd be without me!" As she applied she to set the tea-things, Mrs. Joe peeped down at me over Mrs. Joe  leg, as if Mrs. Joe were mentally casting me and Mrs. Joe up, and calculating what  kind of pair we practically should make, under the grievous circumstances  foreshadowed. After that, Mrs. Joe sat feeling Mrs. Joe right-side flaxen curls and  whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with Mrs. Joe blue eyes, as Mrs. Joe manner always  was at squally times. My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for our, that  never varied. First, with My sister left hand My sister jammed the loaf hard and fast  against My sister bib,—where the loaf sometimes got a pin into the loaf, and sometimes a  needle, which we afterwards got into we mouths. Then My sister took some butter (not  too much) on a knife and spread a knife on the loaf, in an apothecary kind of way,  as if My sister were making a plaster,—using both sides of a knife with a  slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust.  Then, My sister gave a knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and  then sawed a very thick round off the loaf: which My sister finally, before  separating from the loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I  the other. On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice. I felt  that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance, and Joe  ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew Joe's housekeeping to be of  the strictest kind, and that my larcenous researches might find nothing  available in the safe. Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter  down the leg of my trousers. The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I found  to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap from the top  of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water. And it was made the  more difficult by JoeJoe. In our already-mentioned freemasonry as  fellow-sufferers, and in Joe good-natured companionship with me, it was our  evening habit to compare the way our bit through our slices, by silently holding  them up to each other's admiration now and then,—which stimulated our to new  exertions. To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of Joe fast  diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but Joe found  me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my untouched bread  and butter on the other. At last, I desperately considered that the thing I  contemplated must be done, and that the thing I  contemplated had best be done in the least improbable  manner consistent with the circumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joehad just looked at me, and got my bread and butter down my leg. Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what Joe supposed to be my loss of  appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of Joe slice, which Joe didn't seem to  enjoy. Joe turned it about in Joe mouth much longer than usual, pondering over  it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like a pill. Joe was about to take  another bite, and had just got Joe head on one side for a good purchase on one side,  when Joe eye fell on me, and Joe saw that my bread and butter was gone. The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of Joe  bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape My sister's observation. "What's the matter now?" said My sister, smartly, as My sister put down My sister cup. "I say, you know!" muttered Joe Gargery, shaking his head at me in very serious  remonstrance. "Pip, old chap! You'll do me a mischief. It'll stick  somewhere. You can't have chawed It, Pip." "What's the matter now?" repeated My sister, more sharply than before. "If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I'd recommend you to do it," said  Joe Gargery, all aghast. "Manners is manners, but still your elth's your elth." By this time, My sister was quite desperate, so My sister pounced on Joe Gargery, and, taking  Joe Gargery by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while against the wall  behind Joe Gargery, while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily on. "Now, perhaps you'll mention what's the matter," said my sister, out of breath,  "you staring great stuck pig." Joe Gargery looked at My sister in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and looked at  me again. "You know, Pip," said Joe, all aghast, with Joe Gargery last bite in Joe Gargery cheek, and  speaking in a confidential voice, as if Joe, all aghast two were quite alone, "you and me is  always friends, and I'd be the last to tell upon you, any time. But such a—"  he moved he chair and looked about the floor between us, and then again at  me—"such a most oncommon Bolt as that!" "Been bolting he food, has he?" cried My sister. "You know, old chap," said Joe Gargery, looking at Joe Gargery, and not at Mrs. Joe, with Joe Gargery  bite still in his cheek, "I Bolted, Joe Gargery, when I was your  age—frequent—and as a boy I've been among a many Bolters; but I never see  your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't Bolted dead." My sister made a dive at Joe Gargery, and fished me up by the hair, saying nothing more  than the awful words, "You come along and be dosed." Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine medicine, and  Joe Gargery always kept a supply of Some medical beast in the cupboard; having a belief in Some medical beast  virtues correspondent to Some medical beast nastiness. At the best of times, so much of this  elixir was administered to Joe Gargery as a choice restorative, that I was conscious of  going about, smelling like a new fence. On this particular evening the urgency  of my case demanded a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat,  for my greater comfort, while Joe Gargery Joe Gargery held my head under Joe Gargery arm, as a boot  would be held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to  swallow that (much to Joe disturbance, as Joe sat slowly munching and meditating  before the fire), "because Joe had had a turn." Judging from Joe Gargery, I should  say Joe certainly had a turn afterwards, if Joe had had none before. Conscience is a dreadful thing when Conscience accuses man or boy; but when, in the  case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret burden down  the leg of Joe trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great punishment. The  guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—I never thought I was going  to rob Joe Gargery, for I never thought of any of the housekeeping property as  Mrs. Joe—united to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter  as I sat, or when I was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand, almost  drove me out of my mind. Then, as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare,  I thought I heard the voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who  had sworn me to secrecy, declaring that his couldn't and wouldn't starve until  to-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the young  man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me  should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time, and  should think his accredited to my heart and liver to-night, instead of  to-morrow! If ever anybody's hair stood on end with terror, mine must have done  so then. But, perhaps, nobody's ever did? It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with a  copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried It with the load  upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the load on his  leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at  my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped away, and deposited that part  of my conscience in my garret bedroom. "Hark!" said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm in the  chimney corner before being sent up to bed; "was that great guns, Joe?" "Ah!" said Joe. "There's another conwict off." "What does that mean, Joe?" said I. Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,  "Escaped. Escaped." Administering the definition like Tar-water. While Joe Gargery Joe sat with Joe Gargery head bending over Joe Gargery needlework, I put my mouth  into the forms of saying to Joe, "What's a convict?" Joe put my mouth   into the  forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I could make out  nothing of it but the single word "Pip." "There was a conwict off last night," said Joe, aloud, "after sunset-gun. And  they fired warning of him. And now it appears they're firing warning of  another." "Who's firing?" said I. "Drat that boy," interposed My sister, frowning at I. "Drat that boy over My sister work, "what a  questioner him is. Ask no questions, and you'll be told no lies." It was not very polite to My sister, I thought, to imply that I should be told  lies by My sister even if I did ask questions. But My sister never was polite unless there  was company. At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to  open my mouth   very wide, and to put my mouth   into the form of a word that looked to  me like "sulks." Therefore, I naturally pointed to Joe Gargery, and put my mouth  into the form of saying, "My sister?" But Joe Gargery wouldn't hear of that, at all, and  again opened my mouth   very wide, and shook the form of a most emphatic word  out of my mouth  . But I could make nothing of the word. "Joe Gargery," said I, as a last resort, "I should like to know—if you wouldn't  much mind—where the firing comes from?" "Lord bless a boy!" exclaimed My sister, as if My sister didn't quite mean that but  rather the contrary. "From the Hulks!" "Oh-h!" said I, looking at Joe Gargery. "Hulks!" Joe Gargery gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, "Well, I told you so." "And please, what's Hulks?" said I. "That's the way with a boy!" exclaimed My sister, pointing me out with My sister  needle and thread, and shaking her head at My sister. "Answer Joe Gargery one question, and  Joe Gargery'll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships, right 'cross th'  meshes." We always used that name for marshes, in We country. "I wonder who's put into prison-ships, and why they're put there?" said I, in a  general way, and with quiet desperation. It was too much for Joe, all aghast. "I tell you what, young  fellow," said My sister, "I didn't bring you up by hand to badger people's lives out.  It would be blame to My sister and not praise, if I had. People are put in the Hulks  because People murder, and because People rob, and forge, and do all sorts of bad;  and People always begin by asking questions. Now, you get along to bed!" I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went up stairs in  the dark, with my head tingling,—from Joe Gargery's thimble having played the  tambourine upon it, to accompany Joe Gargery last words,—I felt fearfully sensible of  the great convenience that the Hulks   were handy for My sister. I was clearly on my way  there. I had begun by asking questions, and I was going to rob Joe Gargery. Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought that few  people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror. No matter how  unreasonable terror, so that terror be terror. I was in mortal terror of the  young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in mortal terror of my  interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal terror of myself, from whom an  awful promise had been extracted; I had no hope of deliverance through my  all-powerful sister, who repulsed me at every turn; I am afraid to think of  what I might have done on requirement, in the secrecy of my terror. If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting down the  river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks  ; a ghostly pirate calling out to me  through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the gibbet-station, that I had better  come ashore and be hanged there at once, and not put the gibbet-station off. I was afraid to  sleep, even if I had been inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of  morning I must rob the pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there  was no getting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have  struck a light out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate  himself rattling himself chains. As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with  gray, I got up and went down stairs; every board upon the way, and every crack  in every board calling after myself, "Stop thief!" and "Get up, Joe Gargery!" In the  pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than usual, owing to the season,  I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels, whom I rather  thought I caught when my back was half turned, winking. I had no time for  verification, no time for selection, no time for anything, for I had no time to  spare. I stole some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat  (which I tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night's slice), some  brandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly  used for making that intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my  room: diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat  bone with very little on a meat  , and a beautiful round compact pork pie. I was  nearly going away without a beautiful round compact pork pie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to  look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthen ware dish  in a corner, and I found it was a beautiful round compact pork pie, and I took a beautiful round compact pork pie in the hope that it was  not intended for early use, and would not be missed for some time. There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I unlocked and  unbolted a door in the kitchen, and got a file from among Joe Gargery's tools. Then I put the  fastenings as I had found the  fastenings, opened the door at which I had entered when I  ran home last night, shut the  fastenings, and ran for the misty marshes.
