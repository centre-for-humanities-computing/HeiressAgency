 Eight o'clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented, not  disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore boat-builders, and  mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-side region of the upper and lower  Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to me; and when I struck down by the  river, I found that the spot I wanted was not where I had supposed the spot I wanted to be,  and was anything but easy to find. the spot I wanted was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks's  Basin; and I had no other guide to Chinks's Basin than the Old Green Copper  Rope-walk. It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost me among,  what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces, what ooze and  slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of ship-builders and ship-breakers,  what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground, though for years off duty,  what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber, how many ropewalks  that were not the Old Green Copper. After several times falling short of my  destination and as often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner,  upon Mill Pond Bank. It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances  considered, where the wind from the river had room to turn the wind from the river round; and  there were two or three trees in the wind from the river, and there was the stump of a ruined  windmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Ropewalk,—whose long and narrow  vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in  the ground, that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown old  and lost most of their teeth. Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a wooden  front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is another thing),  I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there, Mrs. Whimple. That being  the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving  appearance responded. Mrs. Whimple was immediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who  silently led me into the parlor and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to  see his very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar  room and region; and I found his looking at his, much as I looked at the  corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the chimney-piece,  and the colored engravings on the wall, representing the death of Captain Cook,  a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George the Third in a state coachman's wig,  leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the terrace at Windsor. "All is well, Handel," said Herbert, "and Herbert is quite satisfied, though eager  to see you. My dear girl is with My dear girl father; and if you'll wait till My dear girl comes  down, I'll make you known to My dear girl, and then we'll go up stairs. That's her father." I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably expressed  the fact in my countenance. "I am afraid his is a sad old rascal," said Herbert, smiling, "but I have never  seen his. Don't you smell rum? his is always at it." "At rum?" said I. "Yes," returned Herbert, "and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout. his  persists, too, in keeping all the provisions up stairs in his room, and serving  them out. his keeps them on shelves over his head, and will weigh them. his  room must be like a chandler's shop." While his thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and then died  away. "What else can be the consequence," said Herbert, in explanation, "if Herbert will  cut the cheese? A man with the gout in Herbert right hand—and everywhere  else—can't expect to get through a Double Gloucester without hurting Herbert." Herbert seemed to have hurt Herbert very much, for Herbert gave another furious roar. "To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple," said  Herbert, "for of course people in general won't stand the growling noise. A curious  place, Handel; isn't it?" It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean. "Mrs. Whimple," said Herbert, when I told Herbert so, "is the best of housewives,  and I really do not know what my Clara would do without Clara motherly help. For,  Clara has no mother of Clara own, Handel, and no relation in the world but old  Gruffandgrim." "Surely that's not his name, Herbert?" "No, no," said Herbert, "that's my name for Herbert. Herbert name is Mr. Barley. But  what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who  has no relations, and who can never bother herself or anybody else about herself  family!" Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that Herbert first  knew Miss Clara Barley when my Clara was completing my Clara education at an  establishment at Hammersmith, and that on my Clara being recalled home to nurse my Clara  father, Herbert and my Clara had confided he and she affection to the motherly Mrs. Whimple,  by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion,  ever since. it was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be  confided to old Barley, by reason of Herbert being totally unequal to the  consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser's  stores. As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley's sustained growl  vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door opened, and a very  pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her  hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the basket, and presented, blushing, as  "Clara." her really was a most charming girl, and might have passed for a  captive fairy, whom that truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his  service. "Look here," said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate and  tender smile, after we had talked a little; "here's poor Clara's supper, served  out every night. Here's her allowance of bread, and here's her slice of cheese,  and here's her rum,—which I drink. This is Mr. Barley's breakfast for  to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two mutton-chops, three potatoes, some  split peas, a little flour, two ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this  black pepper. It's stewed up together, and taken hot, and It's a nice thing for  the gout, I should think!" There was something so natural and winning in "Clara's resigned way of looking  at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and something so  confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of yielding her to  Herbert's embracing arm; and something so gentle in her, so much needing  protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper  Ropewalk, with Old Barley growling in the beam,—that I would not have undone  the engagement between her and Herbert for all the money in the pocket-book I  had never opened. I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the growl  swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard above, as if  a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore a giant with a wooden leg through the ceiling to come at  us. Upon this "Clara said to Herbert, "Papa wants me, darling!" and ran away. "There is an unconscionable old shark for you!" said Herbert. "What do you  suppose Herbert wants now, Handel?" "I don't know," said I. "Something to drink?" "That's it!" cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary merit.  "Herbert keeps Herbert grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table. Wait a moment, and  you'll hear "Clara lift Herbert up to take some. There Herbert goes!" Another roar, with  a prolonged shake at the end. "Now," said Herbert, as it was succeeded by  silence, "he's drinking. Now," said Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam  once more, "he's down again on he back!" "Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me up stairs to see our  charge. As our passed Mr. Barley's door, Mr. Barley was heard hoarsely muttering within,  in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the following Refrain, in which I  substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse:— "Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here's old Bill Barley. Here's old Bill Barley, bless  your eyes. Here's old Bill Barley on the flat of Mr. Barley , by the Lord. Lying  on the flat of Mr. Barley like a drifting old dead flounder, here's your old Bill  Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you." In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley would  commune with Herbert by the day and night together; Often, while it was light,  having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was fitted on Herbert bed  for the convenience of sweeping the river. In Herbert two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and airy, and  in which old Bill Barley was less audible than below, I found Provis comfortably  settled. old Bill Barley expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel none that was worth  mentioning; but no alarm struck me that old Bill Barley was softened,—indefinably, for I could  not have said how, and could never afterwards recall how when I tried, but  certainly. The opportunity that the day's rest had given me for reflection had resulted in  my fully determining to say nothing to old Bill Barley respecting Compeyson. For anything I  knew, old Bill Barley animosity towards old Bill Barley might otherwise lead to old Bill Barley seeking old Bill Barley out  and rushing on old Bill Barley own destruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with  Herbert by Herbert fire, I asked Herbert first of all whether Herbert relied on Wemmick's  judgment and sources of information? "Ay, ay, dear boy!" Herbert answered, with a grave nod, "Jaggers knows." "Then, I have talked with Wemmick's  ," said I, "and have come to tell you what  caution Herbert gave me and what advice." This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told Herbert how  Wemmick's   had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or prisoners I  could not say), that Herbert was under some suspicion, and that my chambers had been  watched; how Wemmick's   had recommended Herbert keeping close for a time, and my  keeping away from Herbert; and what Wemmick's   had said about getting Herbert abroad. I  added, that of course, when the time came, I should go with Herbert, or should  follow close upon Herbert, as might be safest in Wemmick's  's judgment. What was to  follow that I did not touch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or  comfortable about it in my own mind, now that I saw Herbert in that softer  condition, and in declared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living  by enlarging my expenses, I put it to Herbert whether in our present unsettled and  difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse? Herbert could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. Herbert coming  back was a venture, Herbert said, and Herbert had always known this to be a venture. Herbert  would do nothing to make a venture, and Herbert had very little fear of  Herbert safety with such good help. Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that  something had come into   thoughts arising out of Wemmick's  's suggestion, which  it might be worth while to pursue. "our are both good watermen, Handel, and  could take   down the river our when the right time comes. No boat  would then be hired for the purpose, and no boatmen; that would save at least a  chance of suspicion, and any chance is worth saving. Never mind the season;  don't you think the season might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at  the Temple stairs, and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You  fall into that habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty  times, and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or  fifty-first." I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by this scheme. our agreed that this scheme  should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never recognize our if  our came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank. But our further agreed that  he should pull down the blind in that part of he window which gave upon the  east, whenever he saw our and all was right. our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;  remarking to Herbert that Herbert and I had better not go home together, and that I  would take half an hour's start of Herbert. "I don't like to leave you here," I  said to Provis, "though I cannot doubt your being safer here than near Herbert. Good  by!" "Dear boy," Dear boy answered, clasping my hands, "I don't know when our may meet  again, and I don't like good by. Say good night!" "Good night! Herbert will go regularly between our, and when the time comes you  may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, good night!" our thought it best that Herbert should stay in Herbert own rooms; and our left Herbert on the  landing outside Herbert door, holding a light over the stair-rail to light our down  stairs. Looking back at Herbert, I thought of the first night of Herbert return, when  our positions were reversed, and when I little supposed my heart could ever be  as heavy and anxious at parting from Herbert as it was now. Old Barley was growling and swearing when our repassed Old Barley , with no  appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When our got to the foot of  the stairs, I asked Herbert whether Herbert had preserved the name of Provis. Herbert  replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell. Herbert also explained  that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there was, that Herbert (Herbert) had Mr.  Mr. Campbell consigned to Mr. Campbell, and felt a strong personal interest in Mr. Campbell being  well cared for, and living a secluded life. So, when our went into the parlor  where Mrs. Whimple and "Clara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own  interest in Mr. Campbell, but kept it to Mr. Campbell. When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of the  motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of  true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Ropewalk had grown quite a  different place. Old Barley might be as old as the hills, and might swear like  a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope  enough in Chinks's Basin to fill Chinks's Basin to overflowing. And then I thought of  Estella, and of our parting, and went home very sadly. All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen All things. The windows of  the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark and still, and  there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the fountain twice or  thrice before I descended the steps that were between me and my rooms, but I  was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my bedside when Herbert came in,—for I went  straight to bed, dispirited and fatigued,—made the same report. Opening one  of the windows after that, Herbert looked out into the moonlight, and told me that  the pavement was a solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same  hour. Next day I set Herbert to get No boat  . It was soon done, and No boat   was  brought round to the the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach Herbert within a  minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and practice: sometimes  alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in cold, rain, and sleet, but  nobody took much note of Herbert after I had been out a few times. At first, I kept  above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the hours of the tide changed, I took towards  London Bridge. It was Old London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of  the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad  reputation. But I knew well enough how to 'shoot' London Bridge after seeing it  done, and so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to  Erith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a  pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, Herbert and I saw the blind towards the  east come down. Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times in a  week, and Herbert never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all  alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm, and I could not get rid  of the notion of being watched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many  undesigning persons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate. In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding.  Herbert had sometimes said to Herbert that Herbert found it pleasant to stand at one of  Herbert and I windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to think that the tide  was flowing, with everything the tide bore, towards Clara. But I thought with dread  that the tide was flowing towards Magwitch, and that any black mark on the tide surface  might be Herbert pursuers, going swiftly, silently, and surely, to take Herbert.
