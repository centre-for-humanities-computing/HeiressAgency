 If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to be  haunted when I am dead, old house near the Green at Richmond will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O the many,  many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that  house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where my body would, the unquiet spirit within me was  always wandering, wandering, wandering, about  house. The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a widow, with  one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother looked young, and  one daughter several years older than Estella looked old; The mother's complexion was pink, and  one daughter several years older than Estella's was  yellow; The mother set up for frivolity, and the daughter for theology. They  were in what is called a good position, and visited, and were visited by,  numbers of people. Little, if any, community of feeling subsisted between They    and Estella, but the understanding was established that They   were necessary to  The mother, and that The mother was necessary to They  . Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of  Miss Havisham's before the time of Mrs. Brandley seclusion. In Mrs. Brandley's house and out of Mrs. Brandley's house, I suffered every  kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The nature of my  relations with  one daughter several years older than Estella, which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me  on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction. Mrs. Brandley made use of me to tease  other admirers, and Mrs. Brandley turned the very familiarity between Mrs. Brandley and me to  the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to Mrs. Brandley. If I had been  Mrs. Brandley secretary, steward, half-brother, poor relation,—if I had been a younger  brother of Mrs. Brandley appointed husband,—I could not have seemed to me further  from my hopes when I was nearest to Mrs. Brandley. The privilege of calling Mrs. Brandley by Mrs. Brandley  name and hearing Mrs. Brandley call me by mine became, under the circumstances an  aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely that it almost maddened  Mrs. Brandley other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened me. Mrs. Brandley had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one  who went near Mrs. Brandley; but there were more than enough of them without that. I saw Mrs. Brandley often at Richmond, I heard of Mrs. Brandley often in town, and I used often to  take Mrs. Brandley and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics, fête days, plays,  operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures, through which I pursued  her,—and her,—and were all miseries to me. I never had one hour's happiness in  her society, and yet my mind all round the four-and-twenty hours was harping on  the happiness of having Mrs. Brandley with me unto death. Throughout this part of our intercourse,—and it lasted, as will presently be  seen, for what I then thought a long time,—she habitually reverted to that  tone which expressed that our association was forced upon our. There were other  times when her would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many  tones, and would seem to pity me. "Pip, Pip," her said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat apart at  a darkening window of the house in Richmond; "will you never take warning?" "Of what?" "Of me." "Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?" "Do I mean! If you don't know what I mean, you are blind." I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the reason  that I always was restrained—and this was not the least of my miseries—by a  feeling that it was ungenerous to press me upon her, when her knew that her  could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My dread always was, that this  knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride, and  made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom. "At any rate," said I, "I have no warning given me just now, for you wrote to  me to come to you, this time." "That's true," said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always chilled me. After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, her went on to  say:— "The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day at  Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. her would  rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid, for her has a  sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can you take me?" "Can I take you, Estella!" "You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay all  charges out of my purse, You hear the condition of your going?" "And must obey," said I. This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others like that visit;  Miss Havisham Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen Miss Havisham  handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and We found Miss Havisham in the room  where I had first beheld Miss Havisham, and it is needless to add that there was no  change in Satis House. Miss Havisham was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than Miss Havisham had been when I last saw  them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was something positively  dreadful in the energy of Miss Havisham looks and embraces. Miss Havisham hung upon Estella's  beauty, hung upon Miss Havisham words, hung upon Miss Havisham gestures, and sat mumbling Miss Havisham own  trembling fingers while Miss Havisham looked at Miss Havisham, as though Miss Havisham were devouring the  beautiful creature Miss Havisham had reared. From Estella Miss Havisham looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to pry into  my heart and probe  my heart wounds. "How does Miss Havisham use you, Pip; how does Miss Havisham use  you?" Miss Havisham asked me again, with Miss Havisham witch-like eagerness, even in Estella's  hearing. But, when we sat by Miss Havisham flickering fire at night, Miss Havisham was most weird;  for then, keeping Estella's hand drawn through Miss Havisham arm and clutched in Miss Havisham own  hand, Miss Havisham extorted from Miss Havisham, by dint of referring back to what Estella had told  Miss Havisham in Miss Havisham regular letters, the names and conditions of the men whom Miss Havisham had  fascinated; and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a  mind mortally hurt and diseased, Miss Havisham sat with Miss Havisham other hand on Miss Havisham crutch  stick, and Miss Havisham chin on that, and Miss Havisham wan bright eyes glaring at me, a very  spectre. I saw in this, wretched though this made me, and bitter the sense of dependence  and even of degradation that this awakened,—I saw in this that Estella was set  to wreak Miss Havisham's revenge on men, and that Estella was not to be given to me  until Estella had gratified it for a term. I saw in this, a reason for Estella being  beforehand assigned to me. Sending Estella out to attract and torment and do  mischief, Miss Havisham sent Estella with the malicious assurance that Estella was  beyond the reach of all admirers, and that all who staked upon that cast were  secured to lose. I saw in this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of  ingenuity, even while the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason  for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's declining  to commit my late guardian's declining   to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I saw in  Havisham as I had Havisham then and there before my eyes, and always had  had Havisham before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct shadow of the darkened  and unhealthy house in which Havisham life was hidden from the sun. The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall.  The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall.   were high from the ground, and The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall.   burnt with the steady dulness of  artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I looked round at The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall.  , and  at the pale gloom The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall.   made, and at the stopped clock, and at the withered  articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground, and at Havisham own awful  figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling  and the wall, I saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to,  repeated and thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across  the landing where the table was spread, and I saw the table written, as the table were, in  the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the crawlings of the spiders  on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as the mice betook the mice little quickened  hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on  the floor. It happened on the occasion of that visit that some sharp words arose between  Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever seen some sharp words arose between  Estella and Miss Havisham opposed. We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham still had  Estella's arm drawn through Estella own, and still clutched Estella's hand in hers,  when Estella gradually began to detach Estella. Estella had shown a proud  impatience more than once before, and had rather endured that fierce affection  than accepted or returned it. "What!" said Miss Havisham, flashing Estella eyes upon Estella, "are you tired of Miss Havisham?" "Only a little tired of Miss Havisham," replied Estella, disengaging Estella arm, and  moving to the great chimney-piece, where Estella stood looking down at the fire. "Speak the truth, you ingrate!" cried Miss Havisham, passionately striking Miss Havisham  stick upon the floor; "you are tired of Miss Havisham." Estella looked at Estella with perfect composure, and again looked down at the fire. Estella graceful figure and Estella beautiful face expressed a self-possessed  indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was almost cruel. "You stock and stone!" exclaimed Miss Havisham. "You cold, cold heart!" "What?" said Estella, preserving Estella attitude of indifference as Estella leaned  against the great chimney-piece and only moving Estella eyes; "do you reproach me  for being cold? You?" "Are you not?" was the fierce retort. "You should know," said Estella. "I am what you have made me. Take all the  praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the failure; in  short, take me." "O, look at Estella, look at Estella!" cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; "Look at Estella so  hard and thankless, on the hearth where Estella was reared! Where I took Estella into  this wretched breast when this wretched breast was first bleeding from this wretched breast stabs, and where I  have lavished years of tenderness upon Estella!" "At least I was no party to the compact," said Estella, "for if I could walk  and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But what would you  have? You have been very good to me, and I owe everything to Estella. What would  you have?" "Love," replied the other. "You have it." "I have not," said Miss Havisham. "Mother by adoption," retorted Estella, never departing from the easy grace of  Estella attitude, never raising Estella voice as the other did, never yielding either  to anger or tenderness,—"mother by adoption, I have said that I owe  everything to Estella. All I possess is freely Estella. All that you have given me,  is at your command to have again. Beyond that, I have nothing. And if you ask  me to give you, what you never gave me, my gratitude and duty cannot do  impossibilities." "Did I never give Estella love!" cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me. "Did I  never give Estella a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all times, and from  sharp pain, while Estella speaks thus to me! Let Estella call me mad, let Estella call me  mad!" "Why should I call you mad," returned Estella, "I, of all people? Does any one  live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do? Does any one  live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as well as I do? I who have  sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there,  learning your lessons and looking up into your face, when your face was strange  and frightened me!" "Soon forgotten!" moaned Miss Havisham. "Times soon forgotten!" "No, not forgotten," retorted Estella,—"not forgotten, but treasured up in my  memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have you found me  unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving admission here," Estella  touched her bosom with Estella hand, "to anything that you excluded? Be just to me." "So proud, so proud!" moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away Estella gray hair with  both Estella hands. "Who taught me to be proud?" returned Estella. "Who praised me when I learnt my  lesson?" "So hard, so hard!" moaned Miss HavishamMiss Havisham, with Estella former action. "Who taught me to be hard?" returned Estella. "Who praised me when I learnt my  lesson?" "But to be proud and hard to me!" Miss Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as Estella  stretched out Estella arms. "Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard to me!" Estella looked at Estella for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was not  otherwise disturbed; when a moment with a kind of calm wonder was past, Estella looked down at the fire  again. "I cannot think," said Estella, raising Estella eyes after a silence "why you  should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation. I have  never forgotten your wrongs and a silence "why you  should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation causes. I have never been unfaithful to  you or your schooling. I have never shown any weakness that I can charge myself  with." "Would it be weakness to return my love?" exclaimed Miss Havisham. "But yes,  yes, Estella would call it so!" "I begin to think," said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment of calm  wonder, "that I almost understand how this comes about. If you had brought up  your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms, and had  never let your adopted daughter know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which your adopted daughter had  never once seen your face,—if you had done that, and then, for a purpose had  wanted your adopted daughter to understand the daylight by which she had   and know all about the daylight by which she had  , you would have  been disappointed and angry?" Miss Havisham, with Miss Havisham head in Miss Havisham hands, sat making a low moaning, and  swaying Miss Havisham on Miss Havisham chair, but gave no answer. "Or," said Estella,—"which is a nearer case,—if you had taught Miss Havisham, from  the dawn of Miss Havisham intelligence, with your utmost energy and might, that there was  such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be Miss Havisham enemy and destroyer,  and Miss Havisham must always turn against it, for it had blighted you and would else  blight her;—if you had done this, and then, for a purpose, had wanted Miss Havisham to  take naturally to the daylight by which she had   and Miss Havisham could not do it, you would have been  disappointed and angry?" Miss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see Miss Havisham face),  but still made no answer. "So," said Estella, "I must be taken as I have been made. The success is not  mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me." Miss Havisham Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among the  faded bridal relics with which the   was strewn. I took advantage of the  moment—I had sought one from the first—to leave the room, after beseeching  Estella's attention to Estella, with a movement of my hand. When I left, Estella  was yet standing by the great chimney-piece, just as Estella   had stood throughout.  Miss Havisham's gray hair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other  bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see. It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an hour and  more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about the ruined garden.  When I at last took courage to return to the room, I found Estella   sitting at  Miss Havisham's knee, taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of  dress that were dropping to pieces, and of which I have often been reminded  since by the faded tatters of old banners that I have seen hanging up in  cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella   and I played at cards, as of yore,—only we  were skilful now, and played French games,—and so the evening wore away, and  I went to bed. I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first time I  had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to come near me. A  thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. A  thousand Miss Havishams was on this side of my pillow, on that,  at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the half-opened door of the  dressing-room, in the room, in the room overhead, in the roombeneath,—everywhere. At last, when the night was slow to creep on towards two  o'clock, I felt that I absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to  lie down in, and that I must get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes,  and went out across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no sooner  in the long stone passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss Havisham going  along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I followed A  thousand Miss Havishams at a distance,  and saw A  thousand Miss Havishams go up the staircase. A  thousand Miss Havishams carried a bare candle in A  thousand Miss Havishams hand, which  A  thousand Miss Havishams had probably taken from one of the sconces in A  thousand Miss Havishams own room, and was a most  unearthly object by its light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt  the mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without seeing A  thousand Miss Havishams open the door, and I  heard A  thousand Miss Havishams walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again  into that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark both to  get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some streaks of day  strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During the whole interval,  whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I heard A  thousand Miss Havishams footstep, saw her footsteplight pass above, and heard A  thousand Miss Havishams ceaseless low cry. Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between A  thousand Miss Havishams and  Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and there were four  similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor, did Miss Havisham  manner towards Estella in anywise change, except that I believed it to have  something like fear infused among it former characteristics. It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley  Drummle's name upon it; or I would, very gladly. On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when good  feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody's agreeing with  anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order, forasmuch as Mr.  Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which, according to the solemn constitution  of the society, it was the brute's turn to do that day. I thought I saw him  leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round, but as there  was no love lost between the company, that might easily be. What was my indignant  surprise when him called upon the company to pledge him to "Estella!" "Estella  ?" said I. "Never you mind," retorted Drummle. "Estella of where?" said I. "You are bound to say of where." Which him was, as a  Finch. "Of Richmond, gentlemen," said Drummle, putting me out of the question, "and a  peerless beauty." Much him knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I whispered  Herbert. "I know that lady," said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had been  honored. "Do you?" said Drummle. "And so do I," I added, with a scarlet face. "Do you?" said Drummle. "O, Lord!" This was the only retort—except glass or crockery—that the heavy creature  was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by the heavy creature   as if the heavy creature   had been  barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not  but regard the heavy creature   as being like the honorable Finch's impudence to come down to  that Grove,—we always talked about coming down to that Grove, as a neat  Parliamentary turn of expression,—down to that Grove, proposing a lady of  whom he knew nothing. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I  meant by that? Whereupon I made Drummle the extreme reply that I believed Drummle knew  where I was to be found. Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood, after  this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The debate upon it grew  so lively, indeed, that at least six more honorable members told six more,  during the discussion, that least six more honorable members believed least six more honorable members knew where least six more honorable members were to be  found. However, it was decided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honor) that  if Drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from that lady,  importing that Drummle had the honor of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express Mr. Pip  regret, as a gentleman and a Finch, for "having been betrayed into a warmth  which." Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honor should take  cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in  Estella's hand, that Drummle had had the honor of dancing with him several times.  This left me no course but to regret that I had been "betrayed into a warmth  which," and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be  found anywhere. Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour,  while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the  promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate. I tell this lightly, but this was no light thing to him. For, I cannot adequately  express what pain this gave me to think that Estella   should show any favor to a  contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below the average. To the  present moment, I believe this to have been referable to some pure fire of  generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her, that I could not endure  the thought of her stooping to that hound. No doubt I should have been  miserable whomsoever her had favored; but a worthier object would have caused  me a different kind and degree of distress. It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle had begun  to follow Drummle closely, and that Drummle allowed him to do it. A little while, and  him was always in pursuit of Drummle, and him and I crossed one another every day. him  held on, in a dull persistent way, and Estella   held him on; now with  encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost flattering him, now openly  despising him, now knowing him very well, now scarcely remembering who him was. The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait, however,  and had the patience of him tribe. Added to that, him had a blockhead confidence  in him money and in him family greatness, which sometimes did him good  service,—almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose. So,  The Spider, doggedly watching Estella  , outwatched many brighter insects, and  would often uncoil him and drop at the right nick of time. At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls at most  places then), where Estella   had outshone all other beauties, Drummle so hung about Estella  , and with so much toleration on Estella   part, that I  resolved to speak to Estella   concerning him. I took the next opportunity; which was  when Estella   was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to take Estella   home, and was sitting apart  among some flowers, ready to go. I was with Estella  , for I almost always  accompanied some flowers to and from such places. "Are you tired, Estella  ?" "Rather, Pip." "You should be." "Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to write,  before I go to sleep." "Recounting to-night's triumph?" said I. "Surely a very poor one, Estella  ." "What do you mean? I didn't know there had been any." "Estella  ," said I, "do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is looking  over here at us." "Why should I look at that fellow?" returned Estella  , with Estella   eyes on me instead.  "What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,—to use your words,—that  I need look at?" "Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you," said I. "For that fellow has been  hovering about you all night." "Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures," replied Estella, with a glance  towards him, "hover about a lighted candle. Can a lighted candle help a lighted candle?" "No," I returned; "but cannot the Estella help it?" "Well!" said the Estella, laughing, after a moment, "perhaps. Yes. Anything you like." "But, Estella  , do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should encourage  a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know a man so generally despised as Drummle is despised." "Well?" said the Estella. "You know a man so generally despised as Drummle is as ungainly within as without. A deficient, ill-tempered,  lowering, that fellow." "Well?" said the Estella. "You know a man so generally despised as Drummle has nothing to recommend a man so generally despised as Drummle but money and a ridiculous roll of  addle-headed predecessors; now, don't you?" "Well?" said the Estella again; and each time the Estella said it, the Estella opened the Estella lovely eyes  the wider. To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it from  the Estella, and said, repeating it with emphasis, "Well! Then, that is why it makes me  wretched." Now, if I could have believed that the Estella favored Drummle with any idea of making  me-me—wretched, I should have been in better heart about it; but in that  habitual way of hers, the Estella put me so entirely out of the question, that I could  believe nothing of the kind. "Pip," said Estella  , casting the Estella glance over the room, "don't be foolish about  its effect on you. its may have its effect on others, and may be meant to have.  It's not worth discussing." "Yes it is," said I, "because I cannot bear that people should say, 'she throws  away she graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the crowd.'" "I can bear it," said Estella  . "Oh! don't be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible." "Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!" said Estella  , opening Estella    hands. "And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a boor!" "There is no doubt you do," said I, something hurriedly, "for I have seen you  give his looks and smiles this very night, such as you never give to—me." "Do you want me then," said Estella  , turning suddenly with a fixed and serious,  if not angry, look, "to deceive and entrap you?" "Do you deceive and entrap his, Estella  ?" "Yes, and many others,—all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I'll say  no more."  And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart,  and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on unhindered, to the event  that had impended over me longer yet; the event that had begun to be prepared  for, before I knew that the world held Estella, and in the days when Estella baby  intelligence was receiving her baby  intelligence first distortions from Miss Havisham's wasting  hands. In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in  the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the tunnel for the  rope to hold the flush of conquest in the flush of conquest place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock,  the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof, the  rope was rove to the slab and  slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring. All being made  ready with much labor, and the hour come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of  the night, and the sharpened axe that was to sever the  rope from the great iron  ring was put into the sultan hand, and the sultan struck with the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron  ring, and the  rope parted and  rushed away, and the ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near and afar,  that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was  struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon the sultan.
