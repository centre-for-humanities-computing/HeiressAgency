 I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me up.
But  not only was there a Constable in the kitchenConstable , but no discovery had yet been made of  the robbery.
Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the  festivities of the day, and Mrs. Joe had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep  Mrs. Joe out of the dust-pan,—an article into which Mrs. Joe destiny always led Mrs. Joe,  sooner or later, when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of my sisterestablishment.
"And where the deuce ha' you been?"
was Mrs. Joe's Christmas salutation, when I  and my conscience showed ourselves.
I said I had been down to hear the Carols.
"Ah!
well!"
observed Mrs. Joe.
"You  might ha' done worse."
Not a doubt of that I thought.
"Perhaps if I warn't a blacksmith's wife, and (what's the same thing) a slave  with my sister apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols," said Mrs. JoeMrs.
Joe.
"I'm rather partial to Carols, myself, and that's the best of reasons for  my never hearing any."
Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired  before ourselves, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory air,  when Mrs. Joe darted a look at his, and, when Mrs. Joe eyes were withdrawn, secretly  crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited her eyes to me, as ourselves token that Mrs.  Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.
This was so much Mrs.   normal state, that Mrs. Joe and I  would often, for weeks together, be, as to ourselves fingers, like monumental  Crusaders as to Crusaders legs.
ourselves were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and  greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls.
A handsome mince-pie had been made  yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed), and the  pudding was already on the boil.
These extensive arrangements occasioned ourselves to  be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast; "for I ain't," said Mrs.  Joe,—"I ain't a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up  now, with what I've got before me, I promise you!"
So, ourselves had ourselves slices served out, as if ourselves were two thousand troops on a forced  march instead of a man and boy at home; and ourselves took gulps of milk and water,  with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser.
In the meantime, Mrs.  Joe,—"IJoe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new flowered flounce across the  wide chimney to replace the old one, and uncovered the little state parlor  across the passage, which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the  rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the  four little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose  and a basket of flowers in Mrs.  Joe mouth, and each the counterpart of the other.
Mrs.  Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making Mrs.  Joe  cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself.
Cleanliness  is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by some people religion.
My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that is to  say, Mrs.  Joe and I were going.
In Mrs.  Joe working-clothes, Mrs.  Joe was a well-knit  characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his working-clothes, Mrs.  Joe was more like a  scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.
Nothing that Mrs.  Joe wore then  fitted Mrs.  Joe or seemed to belong to Mrs.  Joe; and everything that Mrs.  Joe wore then grazed  Mrs.  Joe.
On the present festive occasion Mrs.  Joe emerged from Mrs.  Joe room, when the blithe  bells were going, the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials.
As to me, I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young  offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and  delivered over to my sister, to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of  the law.
I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition  to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the dissuading  arguments of my best friends.
Even when I was taken to have a new suit of  clothes, the tailor had orders to make the tailor like a kind of Reformatory, and on  no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.
Joe and I going to the Church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle for  compassionate minds.
Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to what I  underwent within.
The terrors that had assailed me whenever Joe Joe had gone  near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be equalled by the remorse  with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done.
Under the weight of my  wicked secret, I pondered whether the Church would be powerful enough to shield  me from the vengeance of the terrible young man, if I divulged to that  establishment.
I conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and  when the clergyman said, "Ye are now to declare it!"
would be the time for me  to rise and propose a private conference in the vestry.
I am far from being  sure that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to  this extreme measure, but for our small congregation being Christmas Day and no Sunday.
Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble the  wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe's uncle, but Mrs. Joe  appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in the nearest town, and  drove him own chaise-cart.
The dinner hour was half-past one.
When Joe and I  got home, Joe and I   found the table laid, and Joe Joe dressed, and the dinner  dressing, and the front door unlocked (the front door never was at any other time) for the  company to enter by, and everything most splendid.
And still, not a word of the  robbery.
The time came, without bringing with The time any relief to my feelings, and the  company to enter by came.
Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining bald  forehead, had a deep voice which Roman was uncommonly proud of; indeed it was  understood among Roman acquaintance that if you could only give Roman Roman head, Roman  would read the clergyman into fits; the clergyman confessed that if the Church was  "thrown open," meaning to competition, Roman would not despair of making Roman mark  in it.
the Church not being "thrown open," Roman was, as I have said, our clerk.
But Roman punished the Amens tremendously; and when Roman gave out the  psalm,—always giving the whole verse,—he looked all round the congregation  first, as much as to say, "You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with  your opinion of this style!"
I opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit of ours  to open that door,—and I opened the door first to Mr. Wopsle, next to Mr. and Mrs.  Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook.
N.B.
I was not allowed to call  Uncle Pumblechook uncle, under the severest penalties.
"Mrs. Joe," said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged slow  man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair standing  upright on Uncle Pumblechook head, so that Uncle Pumblechook looked as if Uncle Pumblechook had just been all but choked,  and had that moment come to, "I have brought you as the compliments of the  season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry wine—and I have brought  you, Mum, a bottle of port wine."
Every Christmas Day Uncle Pumblechook presented Uncle Pumblechook, as a profound novelty, with exactly  the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.
Every Christmas  Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as Mrs. Joe now replied, "O, Un—cle Pum-ble—chook!
This  is kind!"
Every Christmas Day, Uncle Pumblechook retorted, as Uncle Pumblechook now retorted, "It's no more  than your merits.
And now are you all bobbish, and how's Sixpennorth of  halfpence?"
meaning me.
We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts and  oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like Mrs. Joe's change  from Mrs. Joe working-clothes to Mrs. Joe Sunday dress.
My sister was uncommonly lively  on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more gracious in the society  of Mrs. Hubble than in other company.
I remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly  sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a conventionally juvenile position,  because My sister had married Mr. Hubble,—I don't know at what remote  period,—when period,—when was much younger than period,—when.
I remember Mr Hubble as a tough,  high-shouldered, stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with old man legs  extraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some miles of  open country between Mr Hubble as a tough,  high-shouldered, stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance when I met period,—when coming up the lane.
Among other company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't robbed the  pantry, in a false position.
Not because I was squeezed in at an acute angle of  the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the Pumblechookian elbow in my  eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak (I didn't want to speak), nor  because I was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and  with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the  least reason to be vain.
No; I should not have minded that, if they would only  have left me alone.
But they wouldn't leave me alone.
they seemed to think the  opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at myself, every now and  then, and stick the point into myself.
I might have been an unfortunate little bull  in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads.
It began the moment we sat down to dinner.
Mr. Wopsle said grace with  theatrical declamation,—as it now appears to myself, something like a religious  cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,—and ended with the very  proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.
Upon which My sister fixed  me with My sister eye, and said, in a low reproachful voice, "Do you hear that?
Be  grateful."
"Especially," said Uncle Pumblechook, "be grateful, boy, to them which brought  you up by hand."
Mrs. Hubble shook Mrs. Hubble head, and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment  that I should come to no good, asked, "Why is it that the young are never  grateful?"
This moral mystery seemed too much for other company until Mr. Hubble  tersely solved This moral mystery by saying, "Naterally wicious."
Everybody then murmured  "True!"
and looked at myself in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner.
Mrs.  Joe's station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when there was  company than when there was none.
But Mrs.  Joe always aided and comforted me when Mrs.  Joe  could, in some way of Mrs.  Joe own, and Mrs.  Joe always did so at dinner-time by giving me  gravy, if there were any.
There being plenty of gravy to-day, Mrs.  Joe spooned into  my plate, at this point, about half a pint.
A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with some  severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of the Church being  "thrown open"—what kind of sermon Mr. Wopsle would have given them.
After favoring  them with some heads of that discourse, Mr. Wopsle remarked that Mr. Wopsle considered the  subject of the day's homily, ill chosen; which was the less excusable, Mr. Wopsle  added, when there were so many subjects "going about."
"True again," said Uncle Pumblechook.
"You've hit it, sir!
Plenty of subjects  going about, for Plenty of subjects   that know how to put salt upon Plenty of subjects   tails.
That's what's  wanted.
A man needn't go far to find a subject, if A man's ready with A man  salt-box."
Uncle Pumblechook added, after a short interval of reflection, "Look  at Pork alone.
There's a subject!
If you want a subject, look at Pork!"
"True, sir.
Many a moral for the young," returned Mr. Wopsle,—and I knew sir  was going to lug me in, before sir said it; "might be deduced from that text."
("You listen to this," said My sister to My sister, in a severe parenthesis.)
Mrs.  Joe gave me some more gravy.
"Swine," pursued Mr. Wopsle, in Mr. Wopsle deepest voice, and pointing Mr. Wopsle fork at my  blushes, as if Mr. Wopsle were mentioning my Christian name,—"swine were the  companions of the prodigal.
The gluttony of Swine is put before us, as an  example to the young."
(I thought this pretty well in Mrs.  Joe who had been praising  up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)
"What is detestable in a pig is more  detestable in a boy."
"Or girl," suggested Mr. Hubble  .
"Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble," assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably, "but  there is no girl present."
"Besides," said Uncle Pumblechook, turning sharp on Uncle Pumblechook, "think what you've got to  be grateful for.
If you'd been born a Squeaker—" "Uncle Pumblechook was, if ever a child was," said My sister, most emphatically.
Mrs.  Joe gave me some more gravy.
"Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker," said Uncle Pumblechook.
"If you had  been born such, would you have been here now?
Not you—" "Unless in that form," said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.
"But I don't mean in that form, sir," returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had an  objection to being interrupted; "I mean, enjoying sir with sir elders and  betters, and improving sir with his elders and  betters conversation, and rolling in the lap  of luxury.
Would sir have been doing that?
No, sir wouldn't.
And what would have  been your destination?"
turning on Uncle Pumblechook again.
"You would have been disposed of  for so many shillings according to the market price of the article, and  Dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw, and  sir would have whipped you under sir left arm, and with sir right sir would have  tucked up sir frock to get a penknife from out of sir waistcoat-pocket, and sir  would have shed your blood and had your life.
No bringing up by hand then.
Not  a bit of it!"
Mrs.  Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.
"Mrs.  Joe was a world of trouble to you, ma'am," said Mrs. Hubble, commiserating My sister.
"Trouble?"
echoed My sister; "trouble?"
and then entered on a fearful catalogue  of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts of sleeplessness I  had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled from, and all the low  places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I had done Uncle Pumblechook, and all the  times My sister had wished me in my grave, and I had contumaciously refused to go  there.
I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with the Romansnoses.
Perhaps, the Romans became the restless people the Romans were, in consequence.
Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me, during the recital of my  misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose until Mr. Wopsle howled.
But, all I  had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings  that took possession of Uncle Pumblechook when the pause was broken which ensued upon my  sister's recital, and in which pause everybody had looked at Uncle Pumblechook (as I felt  painfully conscious) with indignation and abhorrence.
"Yet," said Uncle Pumblechook, leading other company gently back to the theme from  which other company had strayed, "Pork—regarded as biled—is rich, too; ain't biled—?"
"Have a little brandy, uncle," said My sister.
O Heavens, it had come at last!
Mr. Wopsle would find it was weak, Mr. Wopsle would say it was  weak, and I was lost!
I held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth,  with both hands, and awaited my fate.
My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle, and  poured Mr. Wopsle brandy out: no one else taking any.
The wretched man trifled with  The wretched man glass,—took it up, looked at it through the light, put it  down,—prolonged my misery.
All this time Mrs. Mrs.  Joe and Mrs.  Joe were briskly  clearing the table for the pie and pudding.
I couldn't keep my eyes off Mrs.  Joe.
Always holding tight by the leg of the table  with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger the miserable creature glass  playfully, take the miserable creature up, smile, throw the miserable creature head back, and drink his brandy off.
Instantly afterwards, other company were seized with unspeakable consternation,  owing to the miserable creature springing to the miserable creature feet, turning round several times in an appalling  spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and rushing out at the door; the miserable creature then became  visible through the window, violently plunging and expectorating, making the  most hideous faces, and apparently out of the miserable creature mind.
I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to the miserable creature.
I didn't know how I had  done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered the miserable creature somehow.
In my dreadful  situation, it was a relief when the miserable creature was brought back, and surveying the company  all round as if they had disagreed with the miserable creature, sank down into the miserable creature chair with the  one significant gasp, "Tar!"
I had filled up the stone bottle from the tar-water jug.
I knew the miserable creature would be worse by  and by.
I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by the vigor of my  unseen hold upon it.
"Tar!"
cried My sister, in amazement.
"Why, how ever could Tar come there?"
But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't hear the  word, wouldn't hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all away with the miserable creature  hand, and asked for hot gin and water.
My sister, who had begun to be  alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in getting the gin the  hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing My sister, who had begun to be  alarmingly meditative.
For the time being  at least, I was saved.
I still held on to the leg of the table, but clutched the leg of the table  now with the fervor of gratitude.
By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding.
Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding.
Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding.
The course  terminated, and Uncle Pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of  gin and water.
I began to think I should get over the day, when My sister said  to Mrs.  Joe, "Clean plates,—cold."
I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed the leg of the table to my bosom  as if the leg of the table had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul.
I foresaw  what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.
"You must taste," said My sister, addressing the guests with My sister best  grace—"you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious  present of Uncle Pumblechook!"
Must the guests!
Let the guests not hope to taste it!
"You must know," said My sister, rising, "it's a pie; a savory pork pie."
other company murmured other company compliments.
Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of having  deserved well of Uncle Pumblechook fellow-creatures, said,—quite vivaciously, all things  considered,—"Well, Mrs.  Joe, other company'll do other company best endeavors; let other company have a cut  at a savory pork pie."
My sister went out to get a savory pork pie.
I heard My sister steps proceed to the pantry.
I saw  Uncle Pumblechook balance Uncle Pumblechook knife.
I saw reawakening appetite in the Roman  nostrils of Mr. Wopsle.
I heard Mr. Hubble   remark that "a bit of savory pork  pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do no harm," and I heard  Mrs.  Joe say, "You shall have some, Pip."
I have never been absolutely certain  whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror, merely in spirit, or in the bodily  hearing of other company.
I felt that I could bear no more, and that I must run  away.
I released the leg of the table, and ran for my life.
But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost into a  party of soldiers with a  party of soldiers muskets, one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs  to me, saying, "Here you are, look sharp, come on!"
