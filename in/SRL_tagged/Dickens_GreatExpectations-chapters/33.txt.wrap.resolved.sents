 In her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful than  Estella had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes.
Estella manner was more winning than Estella  had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I saw Miss Havisham's  influence in the change.
We stood in the Inn Yard while Estella pointed out Estella luggage to me, and when her luggage to me  was all collected I remembered—having forgotten everything but Estella in the  meanwhile—that I knew nothing of Estella destination.
"I am going to Richmond," Estella told me.
"We lesson is, that there are two  Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the Surrey  Richmond.
The distance is ten miles.
I am to have a carriage, and you are to  take me.
This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out of my charges.
O, you must  take my purse!
We have no choice, you and I, but to obey We instructions.
We  are not free to follow We own devices, you and I."
As Estella looked at me in giving me my purse, I hoped there was an inner meaning  in Estella words.
Estella said them slightingly, but not with displeasure.
"A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella.
Will you rest here a little?"
"Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you are to  take care of me the while."
Estella drew Estella arm through Estella, as if her arm must be done, and I requested a waiter  who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in  his life, to show We a private sitting-room.
Upon that, his pulled out a napkin,  as if a napkin were a magic clew without which his couldn't find the way up stairs,  and led We to the black hole of the establishment, fitted up with a diminishing  mirror (quite a superfluous article, considering the hole's proportions), an  anchovy sauce-cruet, and somebody's pattens.
On my objecting to this retreat,  his took We into another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a  scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust.
Having looked at this  extinct conflagration and shaken his head, his took my order; which, proving to  be merely, "Some tea for the lady," sent his out of another room with a dinner-table in a very low  state of mind.
I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in this chamber strong  combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that the  coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising proprietor  was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.
Yet another room with a dinner-table was  all in all to me, Estella being in another room with a dinner-table.
I thought that with Estella I could have  been happy there for life.
(I was not at all happy there at the time, observe,  and I knew it well.)
"Where are you going to, at Richmond?"
I asked Estella.
"I am going to live," said Estella, "at a great expense, with a lady there, who has  the power—or says Estella has—of taking me about, and introducing me, and  showing people to me and showing me to people."
"I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?"
"Yes, I suppose so."
Estella answered so carelessly, that I said, "You speak of yourself as if you were  some one else."
"Where did you learn how I speak of others?
Come, come," said Estella, smiling  delightfully, "you must not expect me to go to school to yourself; I must talk in my  own way.
How do you thrive with Mr.
Pocket?"
"I live quite pleasantly there; at least—" It appeared to me that I was  losing a chance.
"At least?"
repeated Estella.
"As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from yourself."
"You silly boy," said Estella, quite composedly, "how can you talk such  nonsense?
Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of Your friend Mr. Matthew  family?"
"Very superior indeed.
Your friend Mr. Matthew is nobody's enemy—" —"Don't add but Your friend Mr. Matthew own,"  interposed Estella, "for I hate that class of man.
But Your friend Mr. Matthew really is  disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?"
"I am sure I have every reason to say so."
"You have not every reason to say so of the rest of Your friend Mr. Matthew people," said Estella,  nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying,  "for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and insinuations to your  disadvantage.
they watch you, misrepresent you, write letters about you  (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment and the occupation of they  lives.
You can scarcely realize to yourself the hatred those people feel for  you."
"those people do me no harm, I hope?"
Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing.
This was very singular to me,  and I looked at Estella in considerable perplexity.
When Estella left off—and Estella had  not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment—I said, in my diffident way  with her,— "I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm."
"No, no you may be sure of that," said Estella.
"You may be certain that I  laugh because they fail.
O, those people with Miss Havisham, and the tortures  those people with Miss Havisham, and the tortures   undergo!"
Estella laughed again, and even now when Estella had told me why, Estella  laughter was very singular to me, for I could not doubt her  laughter being genuine, and  yet it seemed too much for the occasion.
I thought there must really be  something more here than I knew; Estella saw the thought in my mind, and answered  the thought in my mind.
"It is not easy for even you."
said Estella, "to know what satisfaction it  gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of the  ridiculous I have when those people are made ridiculous.
For you were not brought up in  that strange house from a mere baby.
I was.
You had not your little wits  sharpened by your little wits   intriguing against you, suppressed and defenceless, under  the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing.
I had.
You did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the  discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates Estella stores of peace of  mind for when Estella wakes up in the night.
I did."
It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was Estella summoning these  remembrances from any shallow place.
I would not have been the cause of that  look of Estella for all my expectations in a heap.
"Two things I can tell you," said Estella.
"First, notwithstanding the proverb  that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your mind at rest  that these people never will—never would, in hundred years—impair your  ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great or small.
Second, I am  beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain, and  there is my hand upon it."
As Estella gave it to me playfully,—for Estella darker mood had been but  Momentary,—I held it and put it to my lips.
"You ridiculous boy," said  Estella, "will you never take warning?
Or do you kiss my hand in the same  spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?"
"the same  spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek was that?"
said I.
"I must think a moment.
A spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters."
"If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?"
"You should have asked before you touched the hand.
But, yes, if you like."
I leaned down, and Estella calm face was like a statue's.
"Now," said Estella,  gliding away the instant I touched Estella cheek, "you are to take care that I have  some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond."
Estella reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon our, and our  were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our intercourse did give me  pain.
Whatever Estella tone with me happened to be, I could put no trust in no trust, and  build no hope on no trust; and yet I went on against trust and against hope.
Why  repeat no trust a thousand times?
So no trust always was.
I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clew, brought in  by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of tea not a glimpse.
A  teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and forks (including carvers),  spoons (various), saltcellars, a meek little muffin confined with the utmost  precaution under a strong iron cover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft  bit of butter in a quantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two  proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of  bread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in with,  expressing in the waiter countenance burden and suffering.
After a prolonged absence  at this stage of the entertainment, the waiter at length came back with a casket of  precious appearance containing twigs.
These I steeped in hot water, and so from  the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of the waiter don't know what for  Estella.
The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten, and the  chambermaid taken into consideration,—in a word, the whole house bribed into  a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella's purse much lightened,—we got  into our post-coach and drove away.
Turning into Cheapside and rattling up  Newgate Street, our were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed.
"What place is that?"
Estella asked me.
I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it, and then told Estella.
As  Estella looked at it, and drew in Estella head again, murmuring, "Wretches!"
I would  not have confessed to my visit for any consideration.
"Mr. Jaggers," said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else, "has the  reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in  London."
"He is more in the secrets of every place, I think," said Estella, in a low  voice.
"You have been accustomed to see He often, I suppose?"
"I have been accustomed to see He at uncertain intervals, ever since I can  remember.
But I know He no better now, than I did before I could speak  plainly.
What is your own experience of He?
Do you advance with He?"
"Once habituated to He distrustful manner," said I, "I have done very well."
"Are you intimate?"
"I have dined with He at He private house."
"I fancy," said Estella, shrinking "that must be a curious place."
"It is a curious place."
I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with my guardian;  but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in  Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas.
It seemed,  while it lasted, to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I  had had before; and when we were out of it, I was as much dazed for a few  moments as if I had been in lightning.
So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by which we  were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this side of it, and  what on that.
London was almost new to London, London told me, for London had  never left Miss Havisham's neighborhood until London had gone to France, and London  had merely passed through London then in going and returning.
I asked London if my guardian had any charge of London while London remained here?
To that London  emphatically said "God forbid!"
and no more.
It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that London cared to attract me; that London  made London winning, and would have won me even if the task had needed pains.
Yet this made me none the happier, for even if London had not taken that tone of  our being disposed of by others, I should have felt that London held my heart in  London hand because London wilfully chose to do it, and not because it would have  wrung any tenderness in London to crush it and throw it away.
When our passed through Hammersmith, I showed London where Mr. Pocketlived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I hoped I should  see London sometimes.
"O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you are to be  mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned."
I inquired was it a large household London was going to be a member of?
"No; there are only two; mother and daughter.
London is a lady of some  station, though not averse to increasing London income."
"I wonder Miss Havisham Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon."
"It is a part of Miss Havisham's plans for me, Pip," said Estella, with a sigh,  as if Estella were tired; "I am to write to Estella constantly and see Estella regularly  and report how I go on,—I and the jewels,—for they are nearly all mine now."
It was the first time Estella had ever called me by my name.
Of course Estella did so  purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.
We came to Richmond all too soon, and We destination there was a house by the  green,—a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches, embroidered  coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their court days many a  time.
Some ancient trees before a house were still cut into fashions as  formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts; but Some ancient trees own  allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off, and Some ancient trees  would soon drop into Some ancient trees and go the silent way of the rest.
A bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said to a house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted sword, Here  are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire—sounded gravely in the  moonlight, and two cherry-colored maids came fluttering out to receive Estella.
The doorway soon absorbed The doorway boxes, and The doorway gave me The doorway hand and a smile, and  said good night, and was absorbed likewise.
And still I stood looking at a house, thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with The doorway, and knowing  that I never was happy with The doorway, but always miserable.
I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in with a  bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache.
At our own door, I found  little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party escorted by little Jane Pocket little  lover; and I envied little Jane Pocket little lover, in spite of her little lover being subject to Flopson.
little Jane Pocket was out lecturing; for, little Jane Pocket was a most delightful lecturer on  domestic economy, and little Jane Pocket treatises on the management of children and servants  were considered the very best text-books on those themes.
But little Jane Pocket was  at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of the baby's having been  accommodated with a needle-case to keep little Jane Pocket quiet during the unaccountable  absence (with a relative in the Foot Guards) of Millers.
And more needles were  missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such  tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic.
little Jane Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice,  and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious  mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging little Jane Pocket to accept my  confidence.
But happening to look up at little Jane Pocket as little Jane Pocket sat reading little Jane Pocket book  of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign remedy for baby, I  thought—Well—No, I wouldn't.
