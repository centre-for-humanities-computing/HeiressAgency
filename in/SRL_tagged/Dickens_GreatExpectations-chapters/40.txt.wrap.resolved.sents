 It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so far as I  could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought pressing on me when  I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance.
The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self-evident.
It  could not be done, and the attempt to do It would inevitably engender  suspicion.
True, I had no Avenger in my service now, but I was looked after by  an inflammatory old female, assisted by an animated rag-bag whom she called she  niece, and to keep a room secret from an inflammatory old female, assisted by an animated rag-bag whom she called her  niece, and to keep a room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and  exaggeration.
an inflammatory old female, assisted by an animated rag-bag whom she called her  niece, and to keep a room secret from them had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to an inflammatory old female, assisted by an animated rag-bag whom she called her  niece, and to keep a room secret from them  chronically looking in at keyholes, and an inflammatory old female, assisted by an animated rag-bag whom she called her  niece, and to keep a room secret from them were always at hand when not  wanted; indeed that was an inflammatory old female, assisted by an animated rag-bag whom she called her  niece, and to keep a room secret from them only reliable quality besides larceny.
Not to get  up a mystery with an inflammatory old female, assisted by an animated rag-bag whom she called her  niece, and to keep a room secret from them, I resolved to announce in the morning that my  uncle had unexpectedly come from the country.
This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness for the  means of getting a light.
Not stumbling on the  means of getting a light after all, I was fain to  go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his  lantern.
Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I fell over something,  and that something was a man crouching in a corner.
As a man crouching in a corner made no answer when I asked a man crouching in a corner what a man crouching in a corner did there, but eluded my  touch in silence, I ran to the adjacent Lodge the adjacent Lodge and urged the watchman there to come quickly;  telling a man crouching in a corner of the incident on the way back.
The wind being as fierce as ever,  we did not care to endanger the light in his  lantern by rekindling the  extinguished lamps on the black staircase, but we examined the black staircase from the  bottom to the top and found no one there.
no one there then occurred to me as possible  that a man crouching in a corner might have slipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman there's, and leaving a man crouching in a corner standing at the door, I examined the watchman there carefully,  including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep.
All was quiet, and  assuredly no other man was in those chambers.
It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on that  night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman there, on the chance of  eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed a man crouching in a corner a dram at the door, whether  a man crouching in a corner had admitted at a man crouching in a corner gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out?
Yes, a man crouching in a corner said; at different times of the night, three.
One lived in Fountain  Court, and the other two lived in the Lane, and a man crouching in a corner had seen them all go home.
Again, the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a  part had been in the country for some weeks, and a man crouching in a corner certainly had not returned  in the night, because them all had seen the door with a man crouching in a corner seal on the door as them all came  up-stairs.
"the night being so bad, sir," said the watchman there, as sir gave me back my glass,  "uncommon few have come in at his gate.
Besides them three gentlemen that I have  named, I don't call to mind another since about eleven o'clock, when a stranger  asked for you."
"My uncle," I muttered.
"Yes."
"You saw a stranger  , sir?"
"Yes.
Oh yes."
"Likewise the person with sir?"
"Person with sir!"
I repeated.
"I judged the person to be with the person," returned the watchman there.
"the personstopped, when the person stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person took this way  when the person took this way  ."
"What sort of person?"
the watchman there had not particularly noticed; the watchman there should say a working person; to  the best of the watchman there belief, the watchman there had a dust-colored kind of clothes on, under a dark  coat.
the watchman there made more light of the matter than I did, and naturally; not  having my reason for attaching weight to the watchman there.
When I had got rid of the watchman there, which I thought it well to do without prolonging  explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken  together.
Whereas these two circumstances taken  together were easy of innocent solution apart,—as, for  instance, some diner out or diner at home, who had not gone near this  watchman's gate, might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep  there,—and my nameless visitor might have brought some one with the watchman there to show  the watchman there the way,—still, joined, they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust  and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me.
I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the  morning, and fell into a doze before a doze.
I seemed to have been dozing a whole  night when the clocks struck six.
As there was full an hour and a half between  me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily, with prolix  conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder of the wind in the  chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight  woke me with a start.
All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor could I  do so yet.
I had not the power to attend to it.
I was greatly dejected and  distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.
As to forming any plan  for the future, I could as soon have formed an elephant.
When I opened the  shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning, all of a leaden hue; when I  walked from room to room; when I sat down again shivering, before the fire,  waiting for my laundress to appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly  knew why, or how long I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the  reflection, or even who I was that made the  reflection.
At last, the old woman and the niece came in,—the latter with a head not  easily distinguishable from the niece dusty broom,—and testified surprise at sight  of me and the fire.
To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in the night and  was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified  accordingly.
Then I washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about  and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream or sleep-waking, I found myself  sitting by the fire again, waiting for—Him—to come to breakfast.
By and by, Him door opened and Him came out.
I could not bring myself to bear  the sight of Him, and I thought Him had a worse look by daylight.
"I do not even know," said I, speaking low as Him took Him seat at the table,  "by what name to call you.
I have given out that you are my uncle."
"That's it, dear boy!
Call me uncle."
"You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?"
"Yes, dear boy.
I took some name."
"Do you mean to keep some name?"
"Why, yes, dear boy, it's as good as another,—unless you'd like another."
"What is your real name?"
I asked Him in a whisper.
"Magwitch," Him answered, in the same tone; "chrisen'd Abel."
"What were you brought up to be?"
"A warmint, dear boy."
Him answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some profession.
"When you came into the Temple last night—" said I, pausing to wonder whether  that could really have been last night, which seemed so long ago.
"Yes, dear boy?"
"When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had you any  one with you?"
"With me?
No, dear boy."
"But there was some one there?"
"I didn't take particular notice," Him said, dubiously, "not knowing the ways of  the place.
But I think there was a person, too, come in alonger me."
"Are you known in London?"
"I hope not!"
said Him, giving Him neck a jerk with Him forefinger that made me  turn hot and sick.
"Were you known in London, once?"
"Not over and above, dear boy.
I was in the provinces mostly."
"Were you—tried—in London?"
"Which time?"
said Him, with a sharp look.
"The last time."
Him nodded.
"First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way.
Mr. Jaggers was for Him."
It was on my lips to ask Him what Him was tried for, but Him took up a knife,  gave a knife a flourish, and with the words, "And what I done is worked out and paid  for!"
fell to at Him breakfast.
Him ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all Him actions were  uncouth, noisy, and greedy.
Some of Him teeth had failed Him since I saw Him  eat on the marshes, and as Him turned Him food in Him mouth, and turned Him head  sideways to bring Him strongest fangs to bear upon it, Him looked terribly like  a hungry old dog.
If I had begun with any appetite, Him would have taken it  away, and I should have sat much as I did,—repelled from Him by an  insurmountable aversion, and gloomily looking at the cloth.
"I'm a heavy grubber, dear boy," Him said, as a polite kind of apology when Him  made an end of Him meal, "but I always was.
If it had been in my constitution  to be a lighter grubber, I might ha' got into lighter trouble.
Similarly, I  must have my smoke.
When I was first hired out as shepherd t'other side the  world, it's my belief I should ha' turned into a molloncolly-mad sheep myself,  if I hadn't a had my smoke."
As he said so, he got up from table, and putting he hand into the breast of  the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a handful of loose  tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head.
Having filled a short black pipe, he put  the surplus tobacco back again, as if he pocket were a drawer.
Then, he took a  live coal from the fire with the tongs, and lighted a short black pipe at a short black pipe, and then  turned round on the hearth-rug with he back to the fire with the tongs, and went through he  favorite action of holding out both he hands for mine.
"And this," said he, dandling my hands up and down in he, as he puffed at he  pipe,—"and this is the gentleman what I made!
The real genuine One!
It does  me good fur to look at you, Pip.
All I stip'late, is, to stand by and look at  you, dear boy!"
I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning slowly  to settle down to the contemplation of my condition.
What I was chained to, and  how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard he hoarse voice, and sat  looking up at he with its iron gray hair at the sides.
"I mustn't see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets; there  mustn't be no mud on he boots.
my gentleman must have horses, Pip!
Horses to  ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant to ride and drive as  well.
Shall colonists have Shall colonists horses (and blood 'uns, if you please, good  Lord!)
and not my London gentleman?
No, no.
We'll show 'em another pair of  shoes than that, Pip; won't We?"
He took out of He a great thick pocket-book, bursting with papers, and  tossed his pocket on the table.
"There's something worth spending in that there book, dear boy.
It's yourn.
All  I've got ain't mine; it's yourn.
Don't you be afeerd on it.
There's more where  that come from.
I've come to the old country fur to see my gentleman spend my gentleman  money like a gentleman.
That'll be my pleasure.
My pleasure 'ull be fur to see  my gentleman do My pleasure 'ull.
And blast you all!"
my gentleman wound up, looking round the room and snapping  my gentleman fingers once with a loud snap, "blast you every one, from the judge in my gentleman  wig, to the colonist a stirring up the dust, I'll show a better gentleman than  the whole kit on you put together!"
"Stop!"
said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, "I want to speak to  you.
I want to know what is to be done.
I want to know how you are to be kept  out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what projects you have."
"Look'ee here, Pip," said he, laying he hand on my arm in a suddenly altered  and subdued manner; "first of all, look'ee here.
I forgot he half a minute  ago.
What I said was low; that's what it was; low.
Look'ee here, Pip.
Look over  it.
I ain't a going to be low."
"First," I resumed, half groaning, "what precautions can be taken against your  being recognized and seized?"
"No, dear boy," dear boy said, in the same tone as before, "that don't go first.
Lowness goes first.
I ain't took so many year to make a gentleman, not without  knowing what's due to a gentleman.
Look'ee here, Pip.
I was low; that's what I was;  low.
Look over it, dear boy."
Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I replied,  "I have looked over it.
In Heaven's name, don't harp upon it!"
"Yes, but look'ee here," look'ee persisted.
"dear boy, I ain't come so fur, not fur  to be low.
Now, go on, dear boy.
You was a saying—" "How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?"
"Well, dear boy, the danger ain't so great.
Without I was informed agen, the  danger ain't so much to signify.
There's Jaggers, and there's Wemmick, and  there's you.
Who else is there to inform?"
"Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?"
said I.
"Well," no chance person who might identify you in the street returned, "there ain't many.
Nor yet I don't intend to advertise  no chance person who might identify you in the street in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from Botany Bay; and  years have rolled away, and who's to gain by it?
Still, look'ee here, Pip.
If  the danger had been fifty times as great, I should ha' come to see you, mind  you, just the same."
"And how long do you remain?"
"How long?"
said no chance person who might identify you in the street, taking no chance person who might identify you in the street black pipe from no chance person who might identify you in the street , and dropping no chance person who might identify you in the street jaw  as no chance person who might identify you in the street stared at no chance person who might identify you in the street.
"I'm not a going back.
I've come for good."
"Where are you to live?"
said I.
"What is to be done with you?
Where will you  be safe?"
"Dear boy," he returned, "there's disguising wigs can be bought for money, and  there's hair powder, and spectacles, and black clothes,—shorts and what not.
Others has done it safe afore, and what others has done afore, others can do  agen.
As to the where and how of living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on  it."
"You take it smoothly now," said I, "but you were very serious last night, when  you swore it was Death."
"And so I swear it is Death," said he, putting he back in he , "and  Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and it's serious that  you should fully understand it to be so.
What then, when that's once done?
Here  I am.
To go back now 'ud be as bad as to stand ground—worse.
Besides, Pip,  I'm here, because I've meant it by you, years and years.
As to what I dare, I'm  a old bird now, as has dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged,  and I'm not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow.
If there's Death hid inside of  there's Death, there is, and let he come out, and I'll face he, and then I'll believe in  he and not afore.
And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen."
Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring  proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.
It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure he some quiet lodging  hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert returned: whom I  expected in two or three days.
That the secret must be confided to Herbert as a  matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I could have put the immense relief I  should derive from sharing it with Herbert out of the question, was plain to me.
But it was by no means so plain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call Mr. Provis by that  name), who reserved Mr. Provis consent to Herbert's participation until Mr. Provis should have  seen Mr. Provis and formed a favorable judgment of Mr. Provis physiognomy.
"And even then,  dear boy," said Mr. Provis, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of Mr. Provis  pocket, "we'll have Mr. Provis on Mr. Provis oath."
To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world  solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to state what I never  quite established; but this I can say, that I never knew Mr. Provis put it to any  other use.
this little black book about the world   had the appearance of having been stolen from some  court of justice, and perhaps Mr. Provis knowledge of this little black book about the world   antecedents, combined with  Mr. Provis own experience in that wise, gave Mr. Provis a reliance on this little black book about the world   powers as a sort of  legal spell or charm.
On this first occasion of Mr. Provis producing it, I recalled  how Mr. Provis had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how Mr. Provis had  described Mr. Provis last night as always swearing to Mr. Provis resolutions in Mr. Provis  solitude.
As Mr. Provis was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which Mr. Provis looked as if  Mr. Provis had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next discussed with Mr. Provis what  dress Mr. Provis should wear.
Mr. Provis cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of  "shorts" as a disguise, and had in Mr. Provis own mind sketched a dress for Mr. Provis  that would have made Mr. Provis something between a dean and a dentist.
It was with  considerable difficulty that I won Mr. Provis over to the assumption of a dress more  like a prosperous farmer's; and we arranged that Mr. Provis should cut Mr. Provis hair close,  and wear a little powder.
Lastly, as Mr. Provis had not yet been seen by the laundress  or her niece, Mr. Provis was to keep Mr. Provis out of the laundress  or her niece view until Mr. Provis change of  dress was made.
It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my dazed,  not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not get out to  further my dazed,   until two or three in the afternoon.
Mr. Provis was to remain shut up in  the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account to open the door.
There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex Street, the  back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of my windows,  I first of all repaired to a respectable lodging-house in Essex Street, and was so fortunate as to secure the  second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis.
I then went from shop to shop, making  such purchases as were necessary to the change in his appearance.
This business  transacted, I turned my face, on no account, to Little Britain.
Mr. Jaggers  was at Mr. Jaggers   desk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before Mr. Jaggers  fire.
"Now, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers  , "be careful."
"I will, sir," I returned.
For, coming along I had thought well of what I was  going to say.
"Don't commit yourself," said Mr. Jaggers  , "and don't commit any one.
You  understand—any one.
Don't tell me anything: I don't want to know anything; I  am not curious."
Of course I saw that he knew the man was come.
"I merely want, Mr. Jaggers  ," said I, "to assure Mr. Jaggers   that what I have been  told is true.
I have no hope of what I have been  told is true being untrue, but at least I may verify what I have been  told is true."
Mr. Jaggers   nodded.
"But did you say 'told' or 'informed'?"
Mr. Jaggers   asked me, with  Mr. Jaggers   head on one side, and not looking at Mr. Jaggers  , but looking in a listening way at  the floor.
"Mr. Jaggers   would seem to imply verbal communication.
You can't have  verbal communication with a man in New South Wales, you know."
"I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers  ."
"Good."
"I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the  benefactor so long unknown to Mr. Jaggers  ."
"That is the man," said Mr. Jaggers, "in New South Wales."
"And only he?"
said I.
"And only he," said Mr. Jaggers  .
"I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for my  mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss Havisham."
"As you say, Pip," returned Mr. Jaggers  , turning Mr. Jaggers   eyes upon Mr. Jaggers   coolly, and  taking a bite at Mr. Jaggers   forefinger, "I am not at all responsible for that."
"And yet it looked so like it, sir," I pleaded with a downcast heart.
"Not a particle of evidence, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers  , shaking Mr. Jaggers   head and  gathering up Mr. Jaggers   skirts.
"Take nothing on its looks; take everything on  evidence.
There's no better rule."
"I have no more to say," said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for a  little while.
"I have verified my information, and there's an end."
"And Magwitch—in New South Wales—having at last disclosed himself," said  Mr. Jaggers  , "you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout my communication  with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of fact.
There has never  been the least departure from the strict line of fact.
You are quite aware of  that?"
"Quite, sir."
"I communicated to Magwitch—in New South Wales—New South Wales—when sir first wrote to  me—from New South Wales—the caution that sir must not expect me ever to  deviate from the strict line of fact.
I also communicated to sir another  caution.
sir appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in sir letter at some  distant idea sir had of seeing you in England here.
I cautioned sir that I must  hear no more of that; that sir was not at all likely to obtain a pardon; that sir  was expatriated for the term of sir natural life; and that sir presenting  sir in this country would be an act of felony, rendering sir liable to the  extreme penalty of the law.
I gave Magwitch that caution," said Mr. Jaggers,  looking hard at me; "I wrote Magwitch to New South Wales.
sir guided sir by Magwitch, no  doubt."
"No doubt," said I.
"I have been informed by Wemmick," pursued Mr. Jaggers  , still looking hard at  me, "that Mr. Jaggers   has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist of  the name of Purvis, or—" "Or Provis," I suggested.
"Or Provis—thank you, Pip.
Perhaps it is Provis?
Perhaps you know it's  Provis?"
"Yes," said I.
"You know it's Provis.
A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist of the  name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on behalf of Magwitch.
Wemmick sent Wemmick the particulars of your address, I understand, by return of post.
Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of  Magwitch—in New South Wales?"
"the explanation of  Magwitch—in New South Wales came through Provis," I replied.
"Good day, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers  , offering Mr. Jaggers   hand; "glad to have seen you.
In writing by post to Magwitchor in communicating with  Mr. Jaggers   through Provis, have the goodness to mention that the particulars and  vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you, together with the balance;  for there is still a balance remaining.
Good day, Pip!"
We shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me.
I turned  at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two vile casts on  the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open, and to force out of  their swollen throats, "O, what a man he is!"
Wemmick was out, and though Wemmick had been at Wemmick Wemmick could have done nothing  for me.
I went straight back to the Temple, where I found the terrible Provis  drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in safety.
Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and Wemmick put the clothes I had ordered all on.
Whatever  Wemmick put on, became Wemmick less (it dismally seemed to me) than what Wemmick had worn  before.
To my thinking, there was something in Wemmick that made it hopeless to  attempt to disguise Wemmick.
The more I dressed Wemmick and the better I dressed Wemmick,  The more Wemmick looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes.
This effect on  my anxious fancy was partly referable, no doubt, to Wemmick old face and manner  growing more familiar to me; but I believe too that Wemmick dragged one of Wemmick legs  as if there were still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there  was Convict in the very grain of the man.
The influences of Wemmick solitary hut-life were upon Wemmick besides, and gave Wemmick a  savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the influences of Wemmick  subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all, Wemmick consciousness that Wemmick  was dodging and hiding now.
In all Wemmick ways of sitting and standing, and eating  and drinking,—of brooding about in a high-shouldered reluctant style,—of  taking out Wemmick great horn-handled jackknife and wiping his great horn-handled jackknife on Wemmick legs and  cutting Wemmick food,—of lifting light glasses and cups to Wemmick lips, as if they  were clumsy pannikins,—of chopping a wedge off pannikins,—of bread, and soaking up with  his bread the last fragments of gravy round and round pannikins,—of plate, as if to make the  most of an allowance, and then drying pannikins,—of finger-ends on it, and then  swallowing it,—in these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances  arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon, Bondsman, plain as  plain could be.
It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had conceded the  powder after overcoming the shorts.
But I can compare the effect of it, when  on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead; so awful was the  manner in which everything in his that it was most desirable to repress,  started through that thin layer of pretence, and seemed to come blazing out at  the crown of his head.
It was abandoned as soon as tried, and his wore his  grizzled hair cut short.
Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful mystery  that his was to me.
When his fell asleep of an evening, with his knotted hands  clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head tattooed with deep  wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit and look at his, wondering  what his had done, and loading his with all the crimes in the Calendar, until  the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from his.
Every hour so  increased my abhorrence of his, that I even think I might have yielded to this  impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all his had  done for me and the risk his ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon  come back.
Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and begin to  dress me in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave his there with  everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier.
I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those lonely  rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the rain always  rushing by.
A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account, and the  consideration that A ghost could be, and the dread that A ghost would be, were no small  addition to my horrors.
When A ghost was not asleep, or playing a complicated kind  of Patience with a ragged pack of cards of A ghost own,—a game that I never saw  before or since, and in which A ghost recorded A ghost winnings by sticking A ghost  jackknife into the table,—when A ghost was not engaged in either of these  pursuits, A ghost would ask me to read to him,—"Foreign language, dear boy!"
While  I complied, A ghost, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire  surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see A ghost, between the  fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to the  furniture to take notice of my proficiency.
The imaginary student pursued by  the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was not more wretched than I,  pursued by the creature who had made me, and recoiling from he with a stronger  repulsion, the more he admired me and the fonder he was of I.
This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year.
it lasted about  five days.
Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go out, except when I  took Provis for an airing after dark.
At length, one evening when dinner was  over and I had dropped into a slumber quite worn out,—for my nights had been  agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreams,—I was roused by the welcome  footstep on the staircase.
Provis, who had been asleep too, staggered up at the  noise I made, and in an instant I saw he shining in he hand.
"Quiet!
It's Herbert!"
I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the airy  freshness of six hundred miles of France upon Herbert.
"Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again how are  you?
I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth!
Why, so I must have been, for you  have grown quite thin and pale!
Handel, my—Halloa!
I beg your pardon."
Herbert was stopped in Herbert running on and in Herbert shaking hands with me, by seeing  Provis.
Provis, regarding Herbert with a fixed attention, was slowly putting up Provis, and groping in another pocket for something else.
"Herbert, my dear friend," said I, shutting the double doors, while Herbertstood staring and wondering, "something very strange has happened.
This is—a  visitor of mine."
"It's all right, dear boy!"
said Provis coming forward, with dear boy little clasped  black book, and then addressing dear boy to Herbert.
"Take it in your right  hand.
Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in any way sumever!
Kiss it!"
"Do so, as he wishes it," I said to Herbert.
So, Herbert, looking at Herbert with a  friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis immediately shaking  hands with Herbert, said, "Now you're on your oath, you know.
And never believe me  on mine, if Pip shan't make a gentleman on you!"
