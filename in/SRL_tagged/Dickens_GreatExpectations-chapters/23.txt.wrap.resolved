 Mr. Pocket said  Mr. Pocket was glad to see me, and  Mr. Pocket hoped I was not sorry to see  Mr. Pocket.  "For, I really am not,"  Mr. Pocket added, with  Mr. Pocket son's smile, "an alarming  personage." his son was a young-looking man, in spite of his son perplexities and his son  very gray hair, and his son manner seemed quite natural. I use the word natural, in  the sense of the word being unaffected; there was something comic in his son distraught  way, as though the word would have been downright ludicrous but for his son own  perception that it was very near being so. When his son had talked with me a little,  his son said to  Mr. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his son eyebrows,  which were black and handsome, "Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?" And   Mr. Pocket looked up from  Mr. Pocket book, and said, "Yes."  Mr. Pocket then smiled upon me in an  absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower water?  As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone or subsequent  transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like  Mr. Pocket previous  approaches, in general conversational condescension. I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that  Mr. Pocket was  the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased Knight, who had  invented for himself a conviction that himself deceased father would have been made  a Baronet but for somebody's determined opposition arising out of entirely  personal motives,—I forget whose, if I ever knew,—the Sovereign's, the  Prime Minister's, the Lord Chancellor's, the Archbishop of Canterbury's,  anybody's,—and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of  this quite supposititious fact. I believe himself had been knighted himself for  storming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate address  engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some  building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage either the trowel or  the mortar. Be that as it may, himself had directed  Mr. Pocket to be brought up  from  Mr. Pocket cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title, and who  was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge. So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this  judicious parent, that the young lady had grown up highly ornamental, but perfectly  helpless and useless. With the young lady character thus happily formed, in the first  bloom of the young lady youth the young lady had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was also in the first  bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount to the Woolsack, or to  roof   in with a mitre. As   doing the one or the other was a mere  question of time,   and  Mr. Pocket had taken Time by the forelock (when, to  judge from   length, it would seem to have wanted cutting), and had married  without the knowledge of this  judicious parent. The judicious parent, having  nothing to bestow or withhold but   blessing, had handsomely settled that  dower upon The judicious parent, having  nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing after a short struggle, and had informed  Mr. Pocket that  Mr. Pocket  wife was "a treasure for a Prince."  Mr. Pocket had invested a Princetreasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have  brought  Mr. Pocket in but indifferent interest. Still,  Mr. Pocket was in general the  object of a queer sort of respectful pity, because  Mr. Pocket had not married a title;  while  Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because   Mr. Pocket had never got one.  Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a pleasant  one, and so furnished as that I could use the house with comfort for my own private  sitting-room.  Mr. Pocket then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms, and  introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle and Startop. Drummle, an  old-looking young man of a heavy order of architecture, was whistling. Startop,  younger in years and appearance, was reading and holding  Mr. Pocket head, as if  Mr. Pocket  thought  Mr. Pocket in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge. Both Mr. and  Mr. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else's  hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house and let Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket  live there, until I found this unknown power to be the servants. It was a  smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving trouble; but It had the  appearance of being expensive, for the servants felt It a duty the servants owed to  the servants to be nice in the servants eating and drinking, and to keep a deal of  company down stairs. the servants allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket,  yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have  boarded in would have been the kitchen,—always supposing the boarder capable  of self-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighboring lady with  whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that a neighboring lady with  whom the family were personally unacquainted had seen  Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into  tears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing that  the neighbors couldn't mind the neighbors own business. By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been  educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where Mr. Pocket had distinguished Mr. Pocket; but  that when Mr. Pocket had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life,  Mr. Pocket had impaired Mr. Pocket prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder. After  grinding a number of dull blades,—of whom it was remarkable that their  fathers, when influential, were always going to help Mr. Pocket to preferment, but  always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone,—he had  wearied of that poor work and had come to London. Here, after gradually failing  in loftier hopes, Mr. Pocket had "read" with divers who had lacked opportunities or  neglected them, and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and  had turned Mr. Pocket acquirements to the account of literary compilation and  correction, and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources,  still maintained the house I saw. Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of that highly  sympathetic nature that Mrs. Pocket agreed with everybody, blessed everybody, and shed  smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances. This lady's name was  Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking This lady down to dinner on the day of my  installation. This lady gave me to understand on the stairs, that it was a blow to  dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket should be under the necessity of  receiving gentlemen to read with dear Mr. Pocket. That did not extend to me, This lady told me in  a gush of love and confidence (at that time, I had known This lady something less  than five minutes); if they were all like me, it would be quite another thing. "But dear Mr. Pocket," said Mrs. Coiler, "after Mrs. Coiler early disappointment (not  that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that), requires so much luxury and  elegance—" "Yes, ma'am," I said, to stop This lady, for I was afraid This lady was going to cry. "And This lady is of so aristocratic a disposition—" "Yes, ma'am," I said again, with the same object as before. "—That it is hard," said Mrs. Coiler, "to have dear dear Mr. Pocket's time and  attention diverted from dear Mr. Pocket." I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher's time and  attention were diverted from dear Mr. Pocket; but I said nothing, and indeed  had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manners. It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and Drummle  while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and other  instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian name was  Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It further appeared  that the book I had seen dear Mr. Pocket reading in the garden was all about  titles, and that dear Mr. Pocket knew the exact date at which dear Mr. Pocket grandpapa would have come  into her book, if her grandpapa ever had come at all. Drummle   didn't say much, but in her grandpapa limited way (her grandpapa struck me as a sulky kind of fellow) her grandpapa spoke as one of the  elect, and recognized  Mr. Pocket as a woman and a sister. No one but  No one but  themselves and Mrs. Coiler and Mrs. Coiler the toady neighbor showed any interest in this part  of the conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but  it was painful to Herbert promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the announcement of  a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef.  To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw  Mr. Pocket relieve   Mr. Pocket mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary,  but which made no impression on anybody else, and with which I soon became as  familiar as the rest.  Mr. Pocket laid down the carving-knife and fork,—being engaged  in carving, at the moment,—put  Mr. Pocket two hands into  Mr. Pocket disturbed hair, and  appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift  Mr. Pocket up by it. When  Mr. Pocket had  done this, and had not lifted  Mr. Pocket up at all,  Mr. Pocket quietly went on with what   Mr. Pocket was about. Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked the subject for a  few moments, but Mrs. Coiler flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon  over. Mrs. Coiler had a serpentine way of coming close at me when Mrs. Coiler pretended to be  vitally interested in the friends and localities I had left, which was  altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and when Mrs. Coiler made an occasional bounce upon  Startop (who said very little to Mrs. Coiler), or upon Drummle (who said less), I  rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table. After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring  comments on the children eyes, noses, and legs,—a sagacious way of improving the children  minds. There were four little girls, and two little boys, besides the baby who  might have been either, and the baby's next successor who was as yet neither.  four little girls, and two little boys were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as though those two  non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had  enlisted these, while  Mr. Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have  been as if  Mr. Pocket rather thought  Mr. Pocket had had the pleasure of inspecting those two  non-commissioned officers  before, but didn't quite know what to make of those two  non-commissioned officers. "Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby," said Flopson. "Don't take it  that way, or you'll get it head under the table." Thus advised,  Mr. Pocket took it the other way, and got it upon the  table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion. "Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum," said Flopson; "and Miss Jane, come and  dance to baby, do!" One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon   Mr. Pocket some charge of the others, stepped out of  Mr. Pocket place by me, and danced  to and from the baby until the baby left off crying, and laughed. Then, all the  children laughed, and  Mr. Pocket  Mr. Pocket laughed, and we all laughed and were glad. Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll, then got  the baby safely into  Mr. Pocket's lap, and gave the baby the nut-crackers to play with; at  the same time recommending  Mr. Pocket to take notice that the handles of that  instrument were not likely to agree with the baby eyes, and sharply charging Miss  Jane to look after the same. Then, the two nurses left the room, and had a  lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at  dinner, and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gaming-table. I was made very uneasy in my mind by  Mr. Pocket's falling into a discussion  with Drummle   respecting two baronetcies, while  Mr. Pocket ate a sliced orange steeped  in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the baby on  Mr. Pocket lap, who did most  appalling things with the nut-crackers. At length little Jane, perceiving its  young brains to be imperilled, softly left her place, and with many small  artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away.  Mr. Pocket finishing  Mr. Pocket orange at  about the same time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,— "You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!" "Mamma dear," lisped the little girl, "baby ood have put hith eyeth out." "How dare you tell me so?" retorted  Mr. Pocket. "Go and sit down in your chair  this moment!"  Mr. Pocket's dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if I  myself had done something to rouse it. "Belinda," remonstrated  Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table, "how can  you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the protection of baby." "I will not allow anybody to interfere," said  Mr. Pocket. "I am surprised,  Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of interference." "Good God!" cried  Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation. "Are  infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save their?" "I will not be interfered with by Jane," said  Mr. Pocket, with a majestic  glance at that innocent little offender. "I hope I know my poor grandpapa's  position. Jane, indeed!"  Mr. Pocket got  Mr. Pocket hands in  Mr. Pocket hair again, and this time really did lift   Mr. Pocket some inches out of your chair  . "Hear this!"  Mr. Pocket helplessly exclaimed to  the elements. "Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for people's poor  grandpapa's positions!" Then  Mr. Pocket let  Mr. Pocket down again, and became silent. We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A pause  succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of  leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the only member of the  family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had any decided acquaintance. "Drummle  ," said  Mr. Pocket, "will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you  undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with ma!" baby darling was the soul of honor, and protested with all baby darling might. baby darling doubled  baby darling up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket's arm, exhibited a pair of knitted  shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of the company soft face, and was  carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And baby darling gained baby darling point after all,  for I saw baby darling through the window within a few minutes, being nursed by little  Jane. It happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinner-table,  through Flopson's having some private engagement, and the other five children not being anybody  else's business. I thus became aware of the mutual relations between the other five children and  Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in the following manner.  Mr. Pocket, with  the normal perplexity of  Mr. Pocket face heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at  them for some minutes, as if  Mr. Pocket couldn't make out how them came to be boarding  and lodging in that establishment, and why them hadn't been billeted by Nature  on somebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way  Mr. Pocket asked them certain  questions,—as why little Joe had that hole in Joe frill, who said, Pa,  Flopson was going to mend Flopson when Flopson had time,—and how little Fanny came by  that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice Flopson when Flopson didn't  forget. Then, little Joe melted into parental tenderness, and gave that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it when she didn't  forget a shilling  apiece and told that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it when she didn't  forget to go and play; and then as that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it when she didn't  forget went out, with one very  strong effort to lift little Joe up by the hair little Joe dismissed the hopeless subject. In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop had each a  boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I was pretty good at  most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but as I was conscious of  wanting elegance of style for the Thames,—not to say for other waters,—I at  once engaged to place little Joe under the tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry  who plied at our stairs, and to whom I was introduced by my new allies. This  practical authority confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a  blacksmith. If the arm of a  blacksmith could have known how nearly the compliment lost the arm of a  blacksmith the arm of a  blacksmith  pupil, I doubt if the arm of a  blacksmith would have paid it. There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we should all  have enjoyed we, but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence. Mr.   Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said, "If you please,  sir, I should wish to speak to sir." "Speak to your master?" said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused again. "How  can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or speak to little Joe—at  some other time." "Begging your pardon, ma'am," returned a housemaid, "I should wish to speak  at once, and to speak to master." Hereupon,  Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of we  until  Mr. Pocket came back. "This is a pretty thing, Belinda!" said  Mr. Pocket, returning with a  countenance expressive of grief and despair. "Here's the cook lying insensibly  drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh butter made up in the  cupboard ready to sell for grease!"  Mr. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, "This is that  odious Sophia's doing!" "What do you mean, Belinda?" demanded  Mr. Pocket. "Sophia has told you," said  Mr. Pocket. "Did I not see Sophia with my own eyes  and hear Sophia with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask to speak to  you?" "But has Sophia not taken me down stairs, Belinda," returned  Mr. Pocket, "and  shown me Sophia, and the bundle too?" "And do you defend Sophia, Matthew," said  Mr. Pocket, "for making mischief?"  Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan. "Am I, grandpapa's granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?" said  Mr. Pocket. "Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman, and  said in the most natural manner when the cook came to look after the situation, that  the cook felt I was born to be a Duchess." There was a sofa where  Mr. Pocket stood, and  Mr. Pocket dropped upon it in the attitude  of the Dying Gladiator. Still in the attitude  of the Dying Gladiator  Mr. Pocket said, with a hollow voice,  "Good night, Mr. Pip," when I deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave  Mr. Pocket.
