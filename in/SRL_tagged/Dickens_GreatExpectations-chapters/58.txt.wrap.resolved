 The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to my  native place and  The tidings of my high fortunes neighborhood before I got there. I found the Blue Boar in  possession of the intelligence, and I found that the Blue Boar made a great change in the  Boar's demeanour. Whereas the Blue Boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm  assiduity when I was coming into property, the Blue Boar was exceedingly cool on the  subject now that I was going out of property. It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so often made  so easily. the Blue Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom, which was engaged  (probably by some one who had expectations), and could only assign me a very  indifferent chamber among the pigeons and post-chaises up the yard. But I had  as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the Blue Boarcould have given me, and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the  best bedroom. Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled round by  Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging  out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of the Household Furniture and  Effects, next week.  Satis House was to be sold as old building materials,  and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew  house; LOT 2 on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up.  Other lots were marked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had  been torn down to make room for the inscriptions, and much of the ivy trailed low in  the dust and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the gate,  and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no  business there, I saw the auctioneer's clerk walking on the casks and telling  the casks off for the information of a catalogue-compiler, pen in hand, who made a  temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often pushed along to the tune of  Old Clem. When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar's coffee-room, I found Mr.  Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord (not improved in  appearance by Pumblechook conversing with the landlord late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and addressed  me in the following terms:— "Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be expected!  what else could be expected!" As Pumblechook conversing with the landlord extended Pumblechook conversing with the landlord hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I was broken  by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took his hand. "William," said Pumblechook conversing with the landlord to the waiter, "put a muffin on table. And has  it come to this! Has it come to this!" I frowningly sat down to my breakfast in the Boar's coffee-room. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord stood over Pumblechook conversing with the landlord and poured  out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of a benefactor who  was resolved to be true to the last. "William," said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, "put the salt on. In happier  times," addressing me, "I think you took sugar? And did you take milk? You did.  Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress." "Thank you," said I, shortly, "but I don't eat watercresses." "You don't eat 'em," returned Pumblechook conversing with the landlord, sighing and nodding Pumblechook conversing with the landlord head  several times, as if Pumblechook conversing with the landlord might have expected that, and as if abstinence from  watercresses were consistent with my downfall. "True. The simple fruits of the  earth. No. You needn't bring any, William." I went on with my breakfast in the Boar's coffee-room, and Pumblechook conversing with the landlord continued to stand over Pumblechook conversing with the landlord,  staring fishily and breathing noisily, as Pumblechook conversing with the landlord always did. "Little more than skin and bone!" mused Pumblechook conversing with the landlord, aloud. "And yet when  William went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread afore William my  humble store, like the Bee, William was as plump as a Peach!" This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in  which William had offered William hand in my new prosperity, saying, "May I?" and the  ostentatious clemency with which William had just now exhibited the same fat five  fingers. "Hah!" William went on, handing me the bread and butter. "And air you a going to  Joseph?" "In heaven's name," said I, firing in spite of Pumblechook conversing with the landlord, "what does it matter to  you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone." It was the worst course I could have taken, because It gave Pumblechook conversing with the landlord the  opportunity Pumblechook conversing with the landlord wanted. "Yes, young man," said young man, releasing the handle of the article in question,  retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the behoof of the  landlord and waiter at the door, "I will leave that teapot alone alone. You are  right, young man. For once you are right. I forgit Pumblechook conversing with the landlord when I take such an  interest in your breakfast, as to wish your frame, exhausted by the  debilitating effects of prodigygality, to be stimilated by the 'olesome  nourishment of your forefathers. And yet," said Pumblechook, turning to the  landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at arm's length, "this is Pumblechook as I  ever sported with in Pumblechook days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I  tell you this is Pumblechook!" A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be particularly  affected. "This is The waiter," said Pumblechook, "as I have rode in my shay-cart. This is The waiter  as I have seen brought up by hand. This is The waiter untoe the sister of which I was  uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M'ria from Georgiana M'ria own mother, let The waiter  deny it if The waiter can!" The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave the case  a black look. "Young man," said Pumblechook, screwing Young man head at Young man in the old fashion, "you  air a going to Joseph. What does it matter to Young man, you ask me, where you air a  going? I say to you, Young man, you air a going to Joseph." The waiter coughed, as if The waiter modestly invited me to get over that. "Now," said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in  the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive, "I will tell  you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of the Boar present, known and  respected in this town, and here is William, which Joseph father's name was  Potkins if I do not deceive Young man." "You do not, Young man," said William. "In their presence," pursued Pumblechook, "I will tell you, young man, what to  say to Joseph. Says you, JosephJoseph, I have this day seen my earliest benefactor  and the founder of my fortun's. I will name no names, Joseph, but so no names, Joseph are  pleased to call Joseph up town, and I have seen Joseph." "I swear I don't see Joseph here," said I. "Say that likewise," retorted Pumblechook. "Say you said that, and Josephwill probably betray surprise." "There you quite mistake Joseph," said I. "I know better." "Says you," Pumblechook went on, "'Joseph, I have seen Joseph, and Josephbears you no malice and bears me no malice. Joseph knows your character, Joseph,  and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and ignorance; and Joseph knows your character, Joseph,  , and Joseph knows my want of gratitoode. Yes, Joseph,' says you,"  here " Pumblechook shook Joseph head and hand at Joseph, "'Joseph knows my total deficiency  of common human gratitoode. Joseph knows my total deficiency  of common human gratitoode, Joseph, as none can. You do not know  my total deficiency  of common human gratitoode, Joseph, having no call to know my total deficiency  of common human gratitoode, but Joseph do.'" Windy donkey as Joseph was, it really amazed me that Joseph could have the face to talk  thus to mine. "Says you, 'Joseph, Joseph gave me a little message, which I will now repeat. It  was that, in my being brought low, Joseph saw the finger of Providence. Joseph knowed  the finger of Providence when Joseph saw Joseph, and Joseph saw the finger of Providence plain. the finger of Providence pinted out this  writing, Joseph. Reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor, and founder  of fortun's. But Joseph said Joseph did not repent of what Joseph had done, Joseph.  Not at all. It was right to do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to  do it, and he would do it again.'" "It's pity," said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast, "that  Joseph did not say what Joseph had done and would do again." "Squires of the Boar!" Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord, "and  William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town or down town,  if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do it, kind to do it,  benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again." With those words the Impostor shook those words both by the hand, with an air, and  left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues  of that same indefinite "it." I was not long after Joseph in leaving the housetoo, and when I went down the High Street I saw Joseph holding forth (no doubt to  the same effect) at Joseph shop door to a select group, who honored me with very  unfavorable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the way. But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose great  forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be, contrasted with  this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for my limbs were weak, but  with a sense of increasing relief as I drew nearer to them, and a sense of  leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind. The June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were soaring high  over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful  by far than I had ever known The sky to be yet. Many pleasant pictures of the life  that I would lead there, and of the change for the better that would come over  my character when I had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and  clear home wisdom I had proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion  in me; for my heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to  pass, that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel,  and whose wanderings had lasted many years. The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the little  roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness' sake, took me  past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday; no children  were there, and Biddy's house was closed. Some hopeful notion of seeing her,  busily engaged in her daily duties, before her saw me, had been in my mind and  was defeated. But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards the forge under the  sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's hammer. Long after I ought  to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it and found it but a  fancy, all was still. the  sweet green limes were there, and the white thorns were there,  and the chestnut-trees were there, and the  sweet green limes leaves rustled harmoniously when I  stopped to listen; but, the clink of Joe's hammer Joe's hammer was not in the midsummer wind. Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I saw it at  last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no glittering shower of  sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still. But Biddy's house was not deserted, and the best parlor seemed to be in use, for  there were white curtains fluttering in   window, and its window was open and  gay with flowers. I went softly towards its window, meaning to peep over the flowers,  when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in arm. At first Biddy gave a cry, as if Biddy thought it was my apparition, but in  another moment Biddy was in my embrace. I wept to see Biddy, and Biddy wept to see  me; I, because Biddy looked so fresh and pleasant; she, because I looked so worn  and white. "But Biddy, how smart you are!" "Yes, dear Pip." "And Joe, how smart you are!" "Yes, dear old Pip, old chap." I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then— "It's my wedding-day!" cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, "and I am married  to Joe!" both of them had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on the old deal  table. Biddy held one of my hands to Biddy lips, and Joe's restoring touch was on  my shoulder. "Which he warn't strong enough, my dear, fur to be surprised,"  said Joe. And Biddy said, "I ought to have thought of it, JoeJoe, but I was  too happy." They were both so overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so  touched by my coming to They, so delighted that I should have come by accident  to make They day complete! My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed this  last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while Joe was with me in my illness, had he was with me in my illness  risen to her lips! How irrevocable would have been Joe knowledge of he was with me in my illness, if Joe  had remained with me but another hour! "Biddy," said I, "you have the best husband in the whole world, and if you  could have seen Joe by my bed you would have—But no, you couldn't love Joe  better than you do." "No, I couldn't indeed," said Biddy. "And, JoeJoe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and Biddy will make  you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble Joe!" Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put Joe sleeve before Joe  eyes. "And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in charity  and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you have done for  me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I am going away within  the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I shall never rest until I have  worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison, and have sent  it to you, don't think, Joe and Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand  times over, I suppose I could cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that  I would do so if I could!" Joe and Biddy were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no more. "But I must say more. Joe, I hope you will have children to love, and that  some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter night, who may  remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever. Don't tell another little fellow,  Joe, that I was thankless; don't tell Joe, Biddy, that I was ungenerous and  unjust; only tell Joe that I honored you both, because you were both so good  and true, and that, as your child, I said it would be natural to Joe to grow up  a much better man than I did." "I ain't a going," said Joe, from behind Joe sleeve, "to tell Joe nothink o'  that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one ain't." "And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind hearts, pray  tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you say the words, that I  may carry the sound of both away with me, and then I shall be able to believe  that you can trust me, and think better of me, in the time to come!" "O dear old Pip, old chap," said Joe. "God knows as I forgive you, if I have  anythink to forgive!" "Amen! And God knows I do!" echoed Biddy. "Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few minutes  by me. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with Biddy, go with me as far as  the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say good by!"  I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition with my  creditors,—who gave me ample time to pay them in full,—and I went out and  joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England, and within two months I  was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four months I assumed my first  undivided responsibility. For the beam across the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond  Bank had then ceased to tremble under old Bill Barley's growls and was at  peace, and Herbert had gone away to marry Clara, and I was left in sole charge  of the Eastern Branch until Herbert brought Clara back. Many a year went round before I was a partner in Biddy's house; but I lived happily  with Herbert and Herbert wife, and lived frugally, and paid my debts, and  maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy . It was not until I  became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to Herbert; but Herbert then  declared that the secret of Herbert's partnership had been long enough upon Herbert  conscience, and Herbert must tell the secret of Herbert's partnership. So Herbert told the secret of Herbert's partnership, and Herbert was as much moved  as amazed, and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long  concealment. I must not leave the secret of Herbert's partnership to be supposed that we were ever a great  House, or that we made mints of money. we were not in a grand way of business,  but we had a good name, and worked for we profits, and did very well. we owed  so much to Herbert's ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often  wondered how I had conceived that old idea of Herbert inaptitude, until I was one  day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps his inaptitude had never been  in Herbert at all, but had been in me.
