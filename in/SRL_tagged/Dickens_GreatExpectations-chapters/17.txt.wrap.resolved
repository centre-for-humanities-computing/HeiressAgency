 I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was varied  beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more remarkable  circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to  Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty at the gate; I found  Miss Havisham just as I had left Miss Havisham, and Miss Havisham spoke of Estella in the very same  way, if not in the very same words. The interview lasted but a few minutes, and  Miss Havisham gave me a guinea when I was going, and told me to come again on my birthday. I may mention at once that this became an annual custom. I tried to  decline taking a guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than  causing Miss Havisham to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after that, I  took it. So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened room,  the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that I felt as if  the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that mysterious place, and,  while I and everything else outside it grew older, it stood still. Daylight  never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of the house, any more than  as to the actual fact. the house bewildered me, and under the house influence I continued at  heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home. Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Miss Havisham shoes came  up at the heel, Miss Havisham hair grew bright and neat, Miss Havisham hands were always clean. Miss Havisham  was not She   was common, and could not be like Estella,—but She  was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered. Miss Havisham had not been with us more  than a year (I remember Miss Havisham being newly out of mourning at the time it struck  me), when I observed to myself one evening that Miss Havisham had curiously thoughtful  and attentive eyes; eyes that were very pretty and very good. It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring at—writing some  passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of  stratagem—and seeing Biddy observant of what I was about. I laid down my pen,  and Biddy stopped in Biddy needlework without laying my pen down. "Biddy," said I, "how do you manage my pen? Either I am very stupid, or you are  very clever." "What is it that I manage? I don't know," returned Biddy, smiling. Biddy managed us whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not mean  that, though that made what I did mean more surprising. "How do you manage, Biddy," said I, "to learn everything that I learn, and  always to keep up with myself?" I was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge,  for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the greater part of my  pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no doubt, now, that the  little I knew was extremely dear at the price. "I might as well ask you," said Biddy, "how you manage?" "No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see me  turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy." "I suppose I must catch it like a cough," said Biddy, quietly; and went on with  Biddy sewing. Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at Biddysewing away with Biddy head on one side, I began to think Biddy rather an  extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that Biddy was equally accomplished  in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different sorts of work, and  our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, Biddy  was already as good a blacksmith as I, or better. "You are one of those, Biddy," said I, "who make the most of every chance. You  never had a chance before you came here, and see how improved you are!" Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with Biddy sewing. "I was your  first teacher though; wasn't I?" said Biddy, as Biddy sewed. "Biddy!" I exclaimed, in amazement. "Why, you are crying!" "No I am not," said Biddy, looking up and laughing. "What put that in your  head?" What could have put that in your  head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on  Biddy work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge Biddy had been until Mr. Wopsle's  great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living, so highly desirable  to be got rid of by some people. I recalled the hopeless circumstances by which  Biddy had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little  noisy evening school, with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to  be dragged and shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there  must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first  uneasiness and discontent I had turned to Biddy for help, as a matter of course.  Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I looked at Biddy and  thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been  sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too reserved, and should have  patronized Biddy more (though I did not use that precise word in my meditations)  with my confidence. "Yes, Biddy," I observed, when I had done turning it over, "you were my first  teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like  this, in this kitchen." "Ah, poor thing!" replied Biddy. It was like Biddy self-forgetfulness to transfer  the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about Biddy, making Biddy more  comfortable; "that's sadly true!" "Well!" said I, "we must talk together a little more, as we used to do. And I  must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let we have a quiet walk on  the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat." my sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook the  care of my sister on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out together. It was  summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed the village and the church  and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of  the ships as the ships sailed on, I began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with  the prospect, in my usual way. When we came to the river-side and sat down on  the bank, with the water rippling at we feet, making it all more quiet than the bank  would have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and  place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence. "Biddy," said I, after binding Biddy to secrecy, "I want to be a gentleman." "O, I wouldn't, if I was you!" Biddy returned. "I don't think it would answer." "Biddy," said I, with some severity, "I have particular reasons for wanting to  be a gentleman." "You know best, Pip; but don't you think you are happier as you are?" "Biddy," I exclaimed, impatiently, "I am not at all happy as I am. I am  disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to either, since  I was bound. Don't be absurd." "Was I absurd?" said Biddy, quietly raising Biddy eyebrows; "I am sorry for that;  I didn't mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be comfortable." "Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be  comfortable—or anything but miserable—there, Biddy!—unless I can lead a  very different sort of life from the life I lead now." "That's a pity!" said Biddy, shaking Biddy head with a sorrowful air. Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of  quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined to shed  tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to Biddy sentiment and  my own. I told Biddy Biddy was right, and I knew it was much to be regretted, but  still it was not to be helped. "If I could have settled down," I said to Biddy, plucking up the short grass  within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair  and kicked my feelings into the brewery wall,—"if I could have settled down and been  but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was little, I know it would have  been much better for myself. You and I and Joe would have wanted nothing then, and  Joe and I would perhaps have gone partners when I was out of my time, and I  might even have grown up to keep company with Biddy, and Joe and I might have sat on  this very bank on a fine Sunday, quite different people. I should have been  good enough for Biddy; shouldn't I, Biddy?" Biddy sighed as Biddy looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for answer,  "Yes; I am not over-particular." It scarcely sounded flattering, but I knew Biddy  meant well. "Instead of that," said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two,  "see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and—what would it  signify to myself, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me so!" Biddy turned Biddy face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more attentively at  me than Biddy had looked at the sailing ships. "It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say," Biddy remarked,  directing Biddy eyes to the sailing ships again. "Who said it?" I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was  going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I answered, "The  beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's, and Biddy's more beautiful than anybody  ever was, and I admire Biddy dreadfully, and I want to be a gentleman on Biddy  account." Having made this lunatic confession, I began to throw my torn-up  grass into the river, as if I had some thoughts of following this lunatic confession. "Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite Biddy or to gain Biddy over?" Biddyquietly asked me, after a pause. "I don't know," I moodily answered. "Because, if it is to spite Biddy," Biddy pursued, "I should think—but you know  best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for  Biddy words. And if it is to gain Biddy over, I should think—but you know  best—Biddy was not worth gaining over." Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was perfectly  manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid  that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every  day? "It may be all quite true," said I to Biddy, "but I admire Biddy dreadfully." In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good grasp on  the hair on each side of your  head, and wrenched it well. All the while knowing  the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced, that I was quite  conscious it would have served my face right, if I had lifted it up by my hair,  and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an  idiot. Biddy was the wisest of girls, and Biddy tried to reason no more with me. Biddy put  Biddy hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work, upon my hands,  one after another, and gently took them out of my hair. Then Biddy softly patted  my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face upon my sleeve I cried a  little,—exactly as I had done in the brewery yard,—and felt vaguely  convinced that I was very much ill-used by somebody, or by everybody; I can't  say which. "I am glad of one thing," said Biddy, "and that is, that you have felt you  could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing, and that  is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far  deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a poor one, and so much in need  of being taught Biddy!) had been your teacher at the present time, Biddy thinks  Biddy knows what lesson Biddy would set. But it would be a hard one to learn, and  you have got beyond Biddy, and it's of no use now." So, with a quiet sigh for me,  Biddy rose from the bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice,  "Shall we walk a little farther, or go home?" "Biddy," I cried, getting up, putting my arm round Biddy neck, and giving Biddy a  kiss, "I shall always tell you everything." "Till you're a gentleman," said Biddy. "You know I never shall be, so that's always. Not that I have any occasion to  tell you anything, for you know everything I know,—as I told you at home the  other night." "Ah!" said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the sailing ships. And then  repeated, with she former pleasant change, "shall we walk a little farther, or  go home?" I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the summer  afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very beautiful. I  began to consider whether I was not more naturally and wholesomely situated,  after all, in these circumstances, than playing beggar my neighbor by  candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks, and being despised by  Estella. I thought it would be very good for me if I could get she out of my  head, with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies, and could go to work  determined to relish what I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of  it. I asked me the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella  were beside me at that moment instead of Biddy, Estella   would make me miserable? I  was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to me,  "Pip, what a fool you are!" We talked a good deal as We walked, and all that Biddy said seemed right. Biddywas never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and somebody else  to-morrow; Biddy would have derived only pain, and no pleasure, from giving me  pain; Biddy would far rather have wounded Biddy own breast than mine. How could it  be, then, that I did not like Biddy much the better of the two? "Biddy," said I, when We were walking homeward, "I wish you could put me right." "I wish I could!" said Biddy. "If I could only get me to fall in love with you,—you don't mind my  speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?" "Oh dear, not at all!" said Biddy. "Don't mind me." "If I could only get me to do it, that would be the thing for me." "But you never will, you see," said Biddy. It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as It would have done  if We had discussed It a few hours before. I therefore observed I was not quite  sure of that. But Biddy said Biddy was, and Biddy said it decisively. In my heart I  believed Biddy to be right; and yet I took it rather ill, too, that Biddy should be  so positive on the point. When We came near the churchyard, We had to cross an embankment, and get over a  stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate, or from the rushes,  or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant way), Old Orlick. "Halloa!" his growled, "where are you two going?" "Where should We be going, but home?" "Well, then," said his, "I'm jiggered if I don't see you home!" This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of his. his  attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but used This penalty of being jiggered, like  his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and convey an idea of  something savagely damaging. When I was younger, I had had a general belief  that if his had jiggered me personally, his would have done it with a sharp and  twisted hook. Biddy was much against his going with We, and said to me in a whisper, "Don't  let his come; I don't like his." As I did not like his either, I took the  liberty of saying that We thanked his, but We didn't want seeing home. his  received that piece of information with a yell of laughter, and dropped back,  but came slouching after We at a little distance. Curious to know whether Biddy suspected his of having had a hand in that  murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account, I  asked my sister why my sister did not like his. "Oh!" my sister replied, glancing over my sister shoulder as his slouched after We, "because  I—I am afraid his likes me." "Did his ever tell you his liked you?" I asked indignantly. "No," said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, "his never told me so; but  his dances at me, whenever his can catch my eye." However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not doubt the  accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon Old Orlick's daring  to admire Biddy; as hot as if it were an outrage on me. "But it makes no difference to you, you know," said Biddy, calmly. "No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don't like it; I don't approve  of it." "Nor I neither," said Biddy. "Though that makes no difference to Biddy." "Exactly," said I; "but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you, Biddy,  if he danced at Biddy with your own consent." I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances were  favorable to he dancing at Biddy, got before he to obscure that  demonstration. he had struck root in Joe's establishment, by reason of my  sister's sudden fancy for he, or I should have tried to get he dismissed. he  quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I had reason to know  thereafter. And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated my mind was  confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I was clear  that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the plain honest  working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of, but  offered me sufficient means of self-respect and happiness. At those times, I  would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge  was gone, and that I was growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and  to keep company with Biddy,—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance  of the Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter  my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often before I  had got Scattered wits well together, Scattered wits would be dispersed in all directions by one  stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss Havisham was going to make my  fortune when my time was out. If my time had run out, my time would have left me still at the height of my  perplexities, I dare say. my time never did run out, however, but was brought to a  premature end, as I proceed to relate.
